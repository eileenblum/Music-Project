[Lyrics: Zhema &amp; Carli Cooper]
[Music: Passamani &amp; Vulcano]

IT RISES THE SHADE OF FEAR
FUNERAL AND DESPAIR,
THE DAMNED HORROR
WEEPS THE POPULATION;
THE PLAGUE!
THE BELLS OF DEATH
DON'T CEASE
IN PANIC, ON THE STREETS
THE ALIVE ONES STILL
HOLD ON IN THE COACHES
TO BE BURIED
WITH THE DEAD

THEY ONLY WANT TO DIE!
THEY ONLY WANT TO DIE!

PATIENTS TUMBLE WITHOUT CURE
THE POTIONS HAVE NO EFFECT
A BRUTAL ASSAULT,
DAMNED HORROR
SWEEPS THE POPULATION
DYING SUPPLICATIONS
THE BELLS DON'T STOP RINGING
DOORS AND WINDOWS ALWAYS CLOSED
SCREAMS FOR MERCY
CHILLS AND PALPITATIONS
WHY DID HE ABANDON THOSE HE CALL SONS?

THEY ONLY WANT TO DIE!
THEY ONLY WANT TO DIE!

WHERE DOES THE PAGAN GOD WALK?
THEY ONLY WANT TO DIE!
WHY DID HE ABANDON THOSE HE CALL SONS?
THEY ONLY WANT TO DIE!
