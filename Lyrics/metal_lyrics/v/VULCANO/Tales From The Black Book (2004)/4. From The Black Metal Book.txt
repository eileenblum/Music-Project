[Lyrics: Zhema &amp; Carli Cooper]
[Music: Zhema &amp; Vulcano]

WE'LL SET ALTARS ON FIRE
WE'LL RAPE THE BELTS OF FALSE CHASTITY
WE'LL PROFANE ALL THE BOOKS
GLORY TO THE EMPERORS! DEATH TO THE GENERALS!

WE'LL RENOUNCE ALL OF THE SERVITUDE
WE'LL RENOUNCE ALL OF THE CROSSES
WE'LL BUILT OUR LAND
TO THE AXES THOSE WHO MAKE USE OF THEM

HERE THEREâS A WORLD
IN WHICH THE MAGICIAN CAN TREAD,
BUT FOR DOING SO, IT'S NECESSARY
TO BE DRESSED IN A SHINING ARMOR,
A DREADFUL SWORD AND A STRONG FIST

THESE WEAPONS ARE STRONG,
...BUT EASILY RUSTED DURING LONG PERIODS
IN THE ATMOSPHERES OF THESE PLACES...

WITH OUR BLADES WEÂ´LL CUT YOUR THROAT
WITH THE WISDOM OF OUR ANCESTORS
WE'LL BUILD STRONGS WALL
WE'LL BUILD OUR OWN RULES

TO THE ASHES THE ALL FALSES GODS
COS' THE ALIVE GODS GODS WILL CELEBRATE THIS DAY
THE VICTORY OF THE BLACK METAL
THE VICTORY OF THE BLACK METAL
