[Lyrics: Zhema &amp; Fabiano Barroso]
[Music: Passamani &amp; Vulcano]

... AND THERE WERE SIGNS CARVED IN THE DOOR
BUT I WASN'T ABLE TO DECIPHER THEM
NIGHT LAMENTS ARISING FROM THE WOODS
THE SOLITARY TOWER ERECTING ON THE HILL

NAKED TREES POINTING UP THE ROAD
AND THE BOATMAN AWAITS TO CROSS THE FILTHY RIVER

DISTURBING WAILINGS CRUSH THE SPIRIT
A BLACK PLAGUE THREATS MEN WITH FURY
PAGAN GOD WRAITH PROJECTING THE SLOW DEATH
THE RED RAIN ROLLING DOW MY FACE

BORN A MONSTER IN THE DARKNESS
NOW THE SIGNS AT THE DOOR BECOME CLEAR

... AND IT SAYS:
LEAVE, OH YE, AND LET ALL HOPE ASIDE

... AND THERE WERE SIGNS CARVED IN THE DOOR
BUT I WASN'T ABLE TO DECIPHER THEM
NOW THE SIGNS AT THE DOOR BECOME CLEAR
LEAVE, OH YE, AND LET ALL HOPE ASIDE
