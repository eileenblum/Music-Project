[Lyrics: Zhema &amp; Carli Cooper]
[Music: Passamani &amp; Vulcano]

I SEE THE MAN'S ANGUISH
ABRUPTLY DISTURBED BY THE DEEP SILENCE
THERE HE IS VANISHED AFTER HAVING CONTEMPLATED
FACE-TO-FACE THE RESTLESSNESS OF THE WORLD
BEFORE WHATâS LYING BEYOND

THE SMELL OF WHITE ROSES FILLS THE AIR
CALM AND SWEET IS ITS PERFUME
OF TERRIFYING AND CHAOTIC MANNER

NEITHER THE PRINCE
NOR HIS SIBLINGS GOT DRESSED
THIS WAY,
IN MEMORY TO A PERISHED BROTHER

WITH THE FACE PALE AS SILVER
DOWN THERE IS THE LAST INHABITANT
OF THE FRATERNAL CHAIN
MASTER OF THE DESOLATION
IN THE TEMPLE THAT ONE DAY HAD THE SACRED WORD
AND NOW JUST
THIS FRATERNAL KISS
UNDER LUTE SOUNDS
WILL FOLLOW HIS FINAL LEGACY
