Evil is rising, the prophecy will be fulfilled
Crawling demon covered by shadows
The messenger of anger release the army
Destroy the enemies to get the devil's crown

Only the darkness could bring back again
The ancient damn fear once more it flies
Without mercy it raises its hand
Warped decayed wings shinning bloody eyes

And throw a deadly spell
Only shadows and pain
The evil always return
Evil's sons do not change

They don't know you chose them
In velvet darkness
Of the blackest night
Give him your soul
Never look back

Only the darkness could bring back again
The ancient damn fear once more it flies
Without mercy it raises its hand
Warped decayed wings shinning bloody eyes
Your destination is violent death
Eternal pain os a satanic gambler
You have already lost your life
Don't be stubborn, there's no way back
