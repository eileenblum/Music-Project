Shining on the air
In the deepest nightmare
Sharp pain
Feeling of death

Chapel burning
In the night
Dust in the heat
Wrinting in pain

The black bible laws
Evil instead of man
Cries loud enough
Kept hearing thje noise

In blackest night
Over the hills
Waiting the instant near
To open hell's door
