The most terrible scene of blood
Blind followers shocked the world
Limitless cruelty sadistic

Dazed brains, dealy virulence
They gave them a sentence to death
Never any mercy showed their victims

Butchered by their innocence
Defenced with bloody scrawlings
The scariest of the bloody minded

Nor the anguished entreaty was heard
Stabbed bodies strewn on the floor
Multiple stab wounds neck

Blood on the doors and walls
Tortured till death with extremely brutality
Flesh of wombs, drips away

Sickening smell of death
Spreaded terror and crulty
They were to do the devil's business

Stab wounds around
Corpses falling the ground
Souls all eternety
Take all to their dstiny
