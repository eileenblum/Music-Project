Tap your fists
And come running
In front of the stage
Banging heads

Our sharp riffsYour blood boiling
Jumping, diving
Sharking the venue

Blast beats sounding
Bending your necks
Deafening noise
Terror metal choise

Broken bones
Mind fueled
Before the show ends
All false metal
Will have to pay

Come to the carnege!
