I'm falling,
I'm screaming,
Screaming for my life
Monsters, worms, horrible creatures

Chewingvoraciously
My breathing is so vague
My inert body
Asking to go back

I need air,
I can not escape
I feel cold
Will it be here the eternity?

The entrance is so narrow
Is very cold here
Concrete, woodand worms
How long I'll stay here?
