When the human will close the end
He will br there waiting for
Among the heaven and hell
Will do the choose

Riding his black crow
Screaming bad rules
Doing the christians
Run to the black angels arms

Evil spirits
In the form of crows
Without fear of the dark
Over the flesh burned

Over the bloodshed
Calling their warriors
War in heaven
Commanding to death

The blackness has come again
He revenged his putrid angels
With blood spilled
Cries of agony and pain

When the batlle finishes
A flood of fear will take place
The sons of prophet
Will be struck down
And thrown the ground...
