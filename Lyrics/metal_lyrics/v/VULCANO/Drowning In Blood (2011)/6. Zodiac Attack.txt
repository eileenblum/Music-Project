Stabbed the flesh
Threee bodies, six times
Before he tied up
The hooded man
Black hood man
Cross-circle symbol
Drawn with blood
Disguised, but unwilling to die
Scaped through the swamp
Dragged by the branch
Leaves behind
An awful scene
Blood, despair and pain

Bleed the throat
Three bodies, three times
He dug before their hands

The hooded man
Black man hood
Cross-circle symbol
Drawn with blood
Let that corpse
For the meal ravens
He fled across the desert
Leave behind
A horrible silence,
Blood, dust and flies

Hammer hears
Three bodies, many times
Before empaled the bodies
The hooded man
Black hood man
Cross-circle symbol

Drawn with blood
Scape through the night
Run by the lanes
Leave behind
Entrails bowels womb
