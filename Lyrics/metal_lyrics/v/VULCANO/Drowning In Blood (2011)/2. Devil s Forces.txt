Red sky
Thunder Lightning
Rain and blood
The evil advises

Death and dispair
The faith will be destroyed
Invisible battles
Of angels and demons

Angels cryin
Demons flying

Wheels of fire
Satan lashes
The first angels fall
Without mercy
Blades cut
The false saviors
It had to do it
Devil's forces!
