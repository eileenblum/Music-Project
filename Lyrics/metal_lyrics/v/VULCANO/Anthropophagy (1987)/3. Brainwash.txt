In that dark room
You'll remain alone
During a long time
They'll tell you
That this will be necessary
To free you of sin
They'll ask you
To renounce the delight of flesh
On behalf of flower power
They'll tell you
That metal is bad
And very harmful

Don't believe them
Don't surrender to them

You'll pray together
And you'll spend long tears
Thinking over life's mystery
They'll tell you
That all truth
Is written on gita
At the end they'll convince you
That your life is obsolete
And life's secrets
Are on death

Don't believe them
Don't surrender to them
