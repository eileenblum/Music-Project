The smell of death
Exhales through the pores
From the savage warriors of death

That seek on to enemies corpses
The goal to placate their fury
And flesh to satiate their hunger

Pieces of flesh
Spreaded on the ground
Show the brutality
Of that bloody carnage
Like ferocious dogs
Search more and more bodies
Like zombies hungry for flesh
That is death and destruction

The enormous savagery
In last consequences
Bordering the abyss
Of insanity and reason
Anthropophagy

Total bestiality
On the warrior of deathâs body
Anxiety and the fury of pain
And agony in their minds
Kill and kill never stop
Till their bodies fall on the ground
Prostrated by the rage from others
That'll survive forever in an anthropophagy

Pieces of flesh
Spreaded on the ground
Show the brutality
Of that bloody carnage
Like ferocious dogs
Search more and more bodies
Like zombies hungry for flesh
That is death and destruction

The enormous savagery
In last consequences
Bordering the abyss
Of insanity and reason
Anthropophagy
