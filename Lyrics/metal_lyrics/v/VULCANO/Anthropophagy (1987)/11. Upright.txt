His hate is big as his vengeance thirsty
That rational would be terror
In his mind change to exciting fantasies
His fate was bloodstained

During the night he looks for the enemies
As a wild dog after his prey
Everyone that had dirt his name are enemies
And he'll annihilate all of them (one by one)

Justice! Made by his own hands
None of them will remain unpunished

His eyes bright as his victim's blood falls
He feels pleasure as his blade cuts the S.O.B.'s flesh
He destroys all of them pitiless
His justice is himself

Justice! Made by his own hands
None of them will remain unpunished

He kills! Kill them in his own name
He brings eternal pain to this victims
He doesn't have name
He's known as upright!
