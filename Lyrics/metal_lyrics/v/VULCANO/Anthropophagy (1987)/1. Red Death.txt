The red death had killed thousands of people
No disease had ever been so terrible
Blood was its god and its distinguishing mark
There were sharp pains, sudden faintness

And much bleeding through the skin
Death came in few hours
Red stains upon the body and specially in the face
Separated the sufferer from all help

And as soon as these signs appeared
All hope was lost
Dead body and panic spreaded for all lands
People ran hopeless through the lanes

Terrible pain screams were listened among the trees
The stains of death spreaded around quickly
And darkness and decay and the red death
Held power over all
