Black bible laws!
Metal fuckin' chains!
Death Angel's armies!

At the outbreak of the war
Demolish all the churches of the world

Christians don't have time
For living now in this world
You'll die, die by my sword

The darkness return!
Close light's door!
And evil warriors attack!

But God don't help you
And your soul don't break loose

Christians don't have time
For living now in this world
You'll die, die by my sword

My jail had an end now
And that spirit of darkness
Listen to my call
To the return of blackness rules
Your flame wasn't eternal
But I ever was around you
Becoming always stronger
And powerful to destroy you
To destroy you
