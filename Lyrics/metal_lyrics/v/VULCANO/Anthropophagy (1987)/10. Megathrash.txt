In the outskirts of a big city
Their way of life is to thrash
Rottenness and violence
It's inside their mind
For them, life's dream
Doesn't exist anymore

There is just
The nightmare of death
Benumbed by pollution
In metal
Find their way out

On the street
In the suburb
Living wild
To kill all posers

Megathrash
Into gangs they assemble
And celebrate their rituals
They appear in shows
And bestiality takes it all

Blood is their food
Black is their color
Night is their day
Debris their houses
And mosh their dance

There is just
The nightmare of death
Benumbed by pollution
In metal
Find their way out

On the street
In the suburb
Living wild
To kill all posers
Megathrash
