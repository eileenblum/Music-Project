Inside the house
I see dead boys 
Should I leave 'em
Or die with 'em

I used to stay 
When I saw my brother pray
That's not the thing for me 
I just want to play
...and just to sing

They got some girls
But don't make sex 
They see ahead 
But don't around

I used to say 
When i saw my brother pray 
That's not the thing for me 
I just want to play
...and just to sing

Once I was there
Put down the meat 
But was so much
Got out to be free

I used to stay 
When I saw my brother pray 
That's not the thing for me 
I just want to play
...and just to sing

Maybe I'm an angel 
Maybe I'm a devil
Angel...devil...
