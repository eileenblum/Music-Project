The armistice is a utopy
And today it is no more possible
Nuts, maniacs and psychos
Infest and rule the power on earth

Fuck!
War!
Fuck the war!

They negotiate the peace
While brutalities of war
Like a wound creating feel
All over the earth

Fuck!
War!
Fuck the war!

The war is a good thing
For whom that sells or buys the pain
Become the great vesture in this century
The war is a fucked thing
And when a new generation
Can see this it will be so late
Because the sentence of death
Even now is sealed by them
Now, they control no life neither death anymore
