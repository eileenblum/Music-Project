At our first riff strains
Run too close the stage
You and us will be just one
There's no difference between us
There's no discrimination
Between punks and bangers
Just the true ones must stay
There's no mercy to the falses
We'll show it to you
Blow with the fist on the stage
And feel the delight of metal
Feel the powerful metal let fly by us
Mixed with total volume of our strings
Thrash your minds with
The drums ring and pray
For total noise with
Your soul full of hate
This is the energy detached by us
Let it to posses your body
Shout by refrain of our songs
Blow with the fist on the stage
And feel the delight of metal
Banging your heads till break your necks
While your strength persists in
Climb the stage and jump into the audience
Till you get your metallic orgasm
Don't hurry! The show is not over!
Scatter you all!
And get ready to the next!
(Stay Hard)
