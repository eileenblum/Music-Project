I am the evil
I live on evil

I am the death
I bring the death

I sip the blood
I feel the blood

I smell of fear
I breathe the fear

I am the evil alive
I am the hate alive

Living in darkness
Dying in darkness

I do not fear anybody
I do not obey anybodyI will take my Vengeance 
I will bring the hate
I will give my sentence
I will use you like bait
