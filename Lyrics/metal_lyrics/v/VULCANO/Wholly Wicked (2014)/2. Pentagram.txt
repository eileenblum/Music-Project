Immerse your soul
In the abyss of the colossal ages
In splendid depth of blackness
Any deviation is considered fatal

If you return, then you will be commander
Of yourselves and of the weak servers
But does not face Satan
Â´Cause, he is your master

If you do this, you will experience
The fire that tears the flesh
The pain that calls for the death
Suffering for eternity

The man soul's hunter is on the heat
Not in old and dusty book
Ignorance is more than you can bear
However, is a perfect target

Dip once, dip twice
You can't swear
Not even entice
Not to become unfair
