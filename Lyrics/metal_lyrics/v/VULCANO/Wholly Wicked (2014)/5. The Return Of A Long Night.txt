Spirits who rebel
With dismal howl in wasted valley
A cursed road where is possible
Disentomb rotting corpses

The stench that begins in death
And sprawls across the edge of chaos
And then lasts no more than a waltz
The watcher of light is dead in the basement

Before the dark gloomy
The dark is the return of a long night
Of voracious and stormy thoughts
That creeps through the empty streets

Echoing in the vastness of eternity of the abyss
Conspiracy in the trenches of the dawn
Raise of the revolution of the unfortunate souls
Who wants, follow, who do not want, die!

The return of a long night
It takes your mind away
Toward in the time sight
That you left for behind
