His hate is big as his thirsty for vengeance 
If rational would be terror
In his mind pass exciting fantasies
His fate was bloodstained

During the night he looks for the enemies
As a wild dog after his prey
Everyone outlaw are enemies
And heâll annihilate all of them

Justice! Made by his own hands
None of them will remain unpunished

His eyes bright as victimâs blood falls
He feels pleasure when cuts the flesh
He destroys all of them pitiless
His justice is proclaimed by himself

He kills! kill them in his own name
He brings eternal pain to his victims
He doesnât have name
He's known as vigilante
