If the battle is in the desert
He's there on the killer bullet
If hunger goes so far
Heâs there on the rotting fruit
If the judge give the sentence
He'll be the lethal gas

Who is he?
Everybody knows his name

Always protecting your trail
Always covering his face with veil
And even sleeping his shadow cover your face
He clean your tracks,
For no enemy to follow you

If the disease spreads
He will separate the children to die first
If a shot is lost in the night
He directs the bullet to an innocent
If disgrace is imminent
He will arrange for a unfortunate son

Who is he?
Everybody knows his name

Always requiring your submission
He asks you full obedience
He's evil, demands the sacrifice of the son
He's evil, allows the killing of innocent
