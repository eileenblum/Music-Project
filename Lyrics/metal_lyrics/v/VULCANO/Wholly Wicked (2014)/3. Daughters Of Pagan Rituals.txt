Shadows oozes out from between the forest
The clearing is chosen
All smells spread in the air
Among the shade of the trees
Arises the mask of perpetuity

Blue eyes of the Virgin of gilded hair,
Witness the deep blue of equinox
The original sin is a magical act
In the purity of the sixteen

Remove the mask from the eyes
No questions, only silence 
Who brought it?
Who gave permission?
Master, Master

Come, come, come to the proof
Come, Come, the knowledge is there

Heat waves growing on pentagram
On sacred soil she exclaims once
All are here, to the celebration
Red wine oozes in nude bust

Come, come, come to the proof
Come, Come, the knowledge is there
