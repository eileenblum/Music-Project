There is a key
That opens all doors

There are many doors
However, only one is the path

There are so many paths
But, only one reaches the ridge

There are so many ridges
But only one shows the infinite

Exist, only one infinite
On the skyline of the future

However, the present
Not part of the future

There is a key
That opens only one door
But, it closes as soon as I pass

No one can stop, which I did not start
And no one can't start, which I did not
