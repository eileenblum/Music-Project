The fog now is wasted
I can to see barbarian troops coming
The death smell fills all places
Massacre thatÂ´s all now I see

They are using no more blades
ThatÂ´s the price of new technology
Kill each time faster
And more bodies drop front me

Pieces of bodies
Floating on blood
They are using no more blades

Now IÂ´m fighting for my life
But they are much more than me
I drive my bayonet in them bodies
And I see them souls past to me

I use my arms as friend
ItÂ´s keep me alert and make me see
That now is o late, the attack is eminent
I feel the acid blowing in me
