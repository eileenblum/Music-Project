TV, disturbing your mind
The laws give to them the legal way
Behind its message
A hidden and obscure proposing
Waiting a right time
To show its face

Alone in your room
Youâre felling so disturbing
A mix in an evil and innocence
Nobody to hate

The limit between insanity and reality
Is a fine line when your mind turns
Corrupted in a discriminating world

Psycho movements
They kill anyone that teases them
TV is a fatal cancer
It will kill you, if nobody kills you before
