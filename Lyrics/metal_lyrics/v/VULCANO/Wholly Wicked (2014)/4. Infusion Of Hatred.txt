Total bestiality
On the squad of insanity
Move forward to the fight
Jump over the enemy to slaughter them 

Hate in their minds
Kill and kill never stops
Till their bodies fall on the ground
Anxiety and the fury for pain

Screams angry to kill 
Attacking among the cross fire
Face to face with the lethal steel  
And devastation by the blades

Pieces of flesh
On all sides of the battlefield
Show the brutality
Of that bloody carnage

Like ferocious dogs
Without any pity
Bad omen to face to death 
Going towards to the devil 

Leaping the trenches
Stepping corpses
Sprawled on the ground
Torn flesh and bowels
