TAKE A LOOK AT THIS WORLD
TRY TO SEE THE TRUTH
YOU'VE GOT TO CHANGE
YOU'VE GOT TO FIGHT
YOU'VE GOT TO BREAK THE RULES
THE WORLD IS FULL OF NOBODY
YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND
THEY DO WHAT THEY WANT
AND WHERE ARE YOU, MAN ?

NEVER MORE INJUSTICE [2x]
NEVER MORE TIRANY

YOU'RE LIKE A TOY
THEY'RE PLAYING WITH ALL YOUR LIVES
YOU'VE GOT TO SHOUT! STOP !
BEFORE YOU DIE

YOU'RE GONNA SHOUT! STOP ! [4x]

SOMEBODY HAS SAID TO YOU
YOU HAVE TO STUDY NOW
SOMEBODY HAS SAID TO YOU
YOU HAVE TO CUT YOUR HAIR BOY

BUT NOBODY HAS SAID TO YOU ! FIGHT [2x]
YOU HAVE TO KNOW

ENOUGHT SAID
NEVER MORE [2x]
