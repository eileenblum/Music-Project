WHILE EVERYBODY SAY
WE HAVE COME TO AN END AND THERE'S NO FUTURE TO US 
WE ARE FLYING AROUND THE SHIT LIKE FLIES LOOLISHLY

WHILE FEW POWERFUL MADMEN
RULES THE WORLD WITH SILLY CAPITALISM AND A MILLION GUNS 
WHILE THEY DON'T DESTROY THE THIRD WORLD

DISSIDENT FORCES WILL EVER FIGHT
REBELS WILL SACK
TERRORISTS WILL APREAD FEAR 
MERCENARIES WILL TO SABOTAGE 
ANARCHISTS WILL CONTEST

WHILE THE RICH ONES KEEP OPPRESSING THE POOR
STEALING THEIR PRODUCTION AND EXTERMINATING WITH THEM AFTER ALL
GOVERNMENTS STEALING IN THE TEETH OF THE PEOPLE
GENERALS FULL OF GUNS FROM TOP TO TOE
THE POWER BY THE FORCE DOING THE APOCALYPSE'S ARMY

DISSIDENT FORCES WILL EVER FIGHT
REBELS WILL SACK
TERRORISTS WILL APREAD FEAR 
MERCENARIES WILL TO SABOTAGE 
ANARCHISTS WILL CONTEST
