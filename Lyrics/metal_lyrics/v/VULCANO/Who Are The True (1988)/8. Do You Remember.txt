DO YOU REMEMBER THAT RADICAL GUY
HATING PAINTED HAIRS AND COLOURS WEARS 
THINKING SKATE IS ASSHOLE'S THINGS? 
ROCK'N'ROLL IS FOR THE ASSHOLES
THINKING HE IS SUPERIOR, HAVING A DEMO OF AN
UNKNOWN BAND, HE HAS CLOSED HIS EYES TO REALITY
SO WHAT HE WAS TAKEN IN HIS OWN ACT 
NOWADAYS, HE COMBS HIS HAIR AND
WEAR GOOD CLOTHES AND YOU CAN SEE HIM 
SKATING ON THE STREETS, WHERE IS THE ASSHOLE ?
IN HIS SHOWS, HE PLAYS COVERS FROM BANDS
HE HATED AND SPEAKS TO EVERYBODY THAT HE WAS 
NEVER A RADICAL GUY
