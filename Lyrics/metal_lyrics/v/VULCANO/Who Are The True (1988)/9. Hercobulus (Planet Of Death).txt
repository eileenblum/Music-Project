IT'S NEAR FROM OUR PLANET, A FORCE, AN EVIL
SLOWLY IN YOUR ORBIT HERE HE COMES
BRINGS DEATH AND DESTRUCTION WITH HIM

IN HIS CENTURIAS NOSTRADAMUS SAID:
IN THE END HE'LL APPEAR LIKE A SECOND SUN
WILL CHANGE IHE POWER OF ATRACTION HE'LL DO

COMING FROM ORION'S CONSTELATION
WHERE EPSLON IS THE CENTRAL STAR AND
NEAR TYLAR (THE SUN) HE ORBITS, HERCOLUBUS

THE LEMURES AND THE ATLANTS KNEW IT
IT WAS HIM WHO EXTERMINATED THESE CIVILIZATIONS
AND NOW HE COMES TO COMPLETE ITS ZODIACAL CYCLE
KILLING OUR ARIAN RACE

SCIENTISTS HAVE ALREADY SEEM HIM
BUT THEY LIE ABOUT HIS EXISTENCE 
NUCLEAR BOMBS AND STAR WARS PROJECT EXIST
TO CHANGE YOUR WAY AND SAVE US FROM THE EVIL

BUT MEN KNOW
THEIR DESTINE IS SCALED
NO WAT TO RUN
IT'S SIGNED IN PROFECIES
HERCOBULUS WILL BE THE DESTRUCTION
