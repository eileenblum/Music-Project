THE MOON IS FULL, THE HOUR IS NEAR 
THE WITCHE'S ARE COMING 
WITH SCREAMINGS FILLING THE AIR 
IN DARK UP STAIRS 

SKELETONS BRIGHT, ALCHIMISTS, 
HERMITS AND MANIACS 
ALL ARE HERE, THE CELEBRATION 
IS UP TO BEGIN 

WITCHE'S SABBATH 

ALL THE FOREST IS BEWITCHED 
WITH BLACK MAGIC AROUND 
ALL THE DEAD AND THE DAMNED 
GET UP FROM THE GROUND 

THE BATS FLEW, BLOOD SPILLS 
FIRE IN THE TREES 
AXE PREPARED, A VIRGIN TIED 
HER HEAD ROLLS AT MY FEET 

WITCHE'S SABBATH
