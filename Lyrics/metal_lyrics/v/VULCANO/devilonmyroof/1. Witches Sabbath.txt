The moon is full, the hour is near
The witche's are coming
With screamings filling the air
In dark up stairs
Skeletons bright, alchimists,
Hermits and maniacs
All are here, the celebration
Is up to begin
Chorus: witche's sabbath (3x)
All the forest is bewitched
With black magic around
All the dead and the damned
Get up from the ground
The bats flew, blood spills
Fire in the trees
Axe prepared, a virgin tied
Her head rolls at my feet
