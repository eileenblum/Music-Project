We're all prisoners
In a strange world
There's no return and we
Got any chance to escape

The fly and fly on through the night
Searchin' more and more
For those damned pack
To fill their damned guys

They made fear to creatures
Of the night, turnin' dreams
Into visions of horror
Cutting our their breath

So terrible and horrible
It's the appearing
Black and cold creep
It's the torture of the soul
