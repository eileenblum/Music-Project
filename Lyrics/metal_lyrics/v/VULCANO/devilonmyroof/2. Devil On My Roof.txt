Last night I saw a devil on my roof
The night was throw out in the darkness
Swords sing in the air
I hear tropel 'n' tropels and phantoms
Even if wasnt there
Maybe I'd run to other house
But then the fire was turned off
I through was so dark into my roof
There's a devil out side
All the ghost wer screaming
I hear the tropels in the air tropels
