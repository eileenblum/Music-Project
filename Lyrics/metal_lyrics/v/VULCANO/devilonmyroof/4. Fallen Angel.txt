Inside the house, I see dead boys
Should I leave 'em or die, with 'em 

I used to say
When I saw my brother pray
That's not the thing for me
I just want to play... and just to sing.

They got some girls but don't make sex
They see ahead but don't around.

Once I was there, put down the meat
But was so much, got out to be free.

Maybe I'm an angel
Maybe I'm a devil.
Maybe I'm an angel,
Maybe I'm a devil.

Angel... devil!
