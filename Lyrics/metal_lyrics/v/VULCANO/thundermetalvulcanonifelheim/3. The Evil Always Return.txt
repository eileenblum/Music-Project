[performed by Vulcano]The evil always return / evil rising 

Evil is rising, the prophecy will be fulfilled
Crawling demon covered by shadows
The messenger of anger release the army
Destroy the enemies to get the devilÂ´s crown

Only the darkness could bring back again
The ancient damn fear once more it flies
Without mercy it raises its hand
Warped decayed wings shining bloody eyes

And throw a deadly spell
Only shadows and pain
The evil always return
Evilâs sons do not change

They donât know you chose them
In velvet darkness
Of the blackest night
Give him your soul
Never look back

Your destination is violent death
Eternal pain of a satanic gambler
You have already lost your life
Donât be stubborn, thereâs no way back
