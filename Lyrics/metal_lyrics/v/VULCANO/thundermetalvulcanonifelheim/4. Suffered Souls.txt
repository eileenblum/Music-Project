[performed by Vulcano]From the darkness profound
The hellÂ´s portals will open
Rides warriors of satan 
Accomplish your destination

Roam suffered souls
While the damned profanes
Write their torture
Recite cursed prayers

Bend your knee
Lower your heads
Your blood will 
Drop in my hands

Kneel damned christian
And pray metallic prayers
Deliver their souls to the sin
And finally to the perdition

Darkness to the death shadow
Prisoner in affliction
They scream in the anguish 
The combat will take place

Bend your knee
Lower your heads
Your blood will 
Drop in my hands 

The death smell fill all place
Pieces of bodies floating on blood
Massacre and slaughter
The limit of insanity
Signs of blood are spread over the places
