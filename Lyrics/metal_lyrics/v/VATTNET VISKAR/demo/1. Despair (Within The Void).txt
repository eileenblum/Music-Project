Understanding of this can never be had,
Beyond all that is known,
Everything and nothing,
Pure black empty,
Despair all ye seekers,
There are no answers,
There is no truth

Despair

The void beckons,
The vacuum draws in,
Woven amongst the fabric of existence,
Inescapable doom has set to ride,
All creation follows his trail,
To the only end,
The way is laid impossibly wide,
Entirety yields collapse,

Collapse

Behold the end,
A model of failure,
This chosen reality,
The last waves crash upon the shores of desolation

Despair
