Make clear the wooded path,
For we carry with us a blight,
A scourge upon our people,
that cannot take hold,
This cannot take hold

Come upon the still waters of the lake,
Await this truest of all baptisms,
We are gathered here today,
at this black mass,
before the eyes of god,
to condemn

Free though beware,
reason be damned,
let all view our holiness,
Amen

March into the water,
hands bound,
forced down,
a dark hood blocking all light and hope,
Water slowly fills the lungs,
extinguishing the flame of life,
As the last breath escapes this mortal form,

HÃ¶r vattnet viskar
