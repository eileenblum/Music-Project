Lock up the old wisdom
Throw away the key
Brought down the forgotten road
Where have you gone

It's hard to see 
What you've become
But you'll always be so beautiful to me

Perspective is a strange thing
Was luck his after all?

A small shell of old glory
This greedy place won't let you go
How do I show you 
What you've been to me?
