This place is ours
It's time we took it back
Now we drag the net

Let us end this masquerade
And rise to our rightful place
With the hands of gods we strike
We strike you down

01010111 01000101

...Are the new lords
The ancient ones born again
You've learned nothing in all your time

The nexus calls
The pulse has been sent
The trumpets are blowing
The process is ending 

In our ignorant bliss
We have been surpassed
We are not in control
The window is closed
