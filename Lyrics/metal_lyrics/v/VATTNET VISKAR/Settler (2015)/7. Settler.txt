The air sings a song of disharmony
She's been looking for a safe place
But it isn't me

When you think that your wounds have healed
Here I am to make them fresh
It was only a matter of time
I fell onto my own sharp tongue

Sentenced to bleed eternally
I died for my own sins
But there is no forgiveness here
Keep searching for that peace you need
Because it isn't me

I am passion
I am disease
I am the weight that brings you to your knees

I am fire
Burning through the trees
When I left I took the colors of the leaves
