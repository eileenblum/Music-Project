A sharp fragment of a thought 
Pierced my mind
Right and wrong have no place here
And I bleed an infinite palette of grey

A light is shining
Illuminator
Show me the way
String me up from the aluminum trees

Tear my bruised and beaten flesh away

There is no end in sight
To this war I wage on myself
