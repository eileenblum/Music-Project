I stood upon the ground with legs of fire
And I leapt (sic) into the sky
A life of burning desire
Carry me into the night

On this cold morning
I fly into the arms of god
I really do not want to say goodbye

Light the fuse
And let me go
I'm off to touch the future
It's time for a new world view

Seven
Three
Eternity
I sleep when I reach the sea

A child unaware
A family standing in awe
I look back and wonder
What happened here

Now I rain upon you
Now I rest upon a pillar of smoke
