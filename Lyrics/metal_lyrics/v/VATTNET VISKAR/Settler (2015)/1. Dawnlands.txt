It's hard to imagine 
What this place was like before
When the land was sovereign
When the houses lined the streets

Those days have gone
A vulgar future is coming
The child of greed has built his house
In the place that I call home

And I wonder, 
Will it ever change
All my ill-fated memories die with the past

So lay down your roads
The heat boils the pavement
And pick clean the bones
Leave the bodies by the wayside
