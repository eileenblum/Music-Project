Something has gone horribly wrong
This was never the plan
We've followed this tangent to it's (sic) bitter end
Now there's no escape
God help us all

We shouldn't be here
We should not speak
We are the remnants of an error
We should not speak

True evil was born that day
In the toxic water

Take me back to the beginning
Pull the cord 
On this dying machine

I want a front row seat when the sun explodes
Let's not take this ride again
Let's let it end
