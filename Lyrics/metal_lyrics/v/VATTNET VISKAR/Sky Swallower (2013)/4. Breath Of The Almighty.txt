there is no silence in this place
my my is slowly being crushed
by a thousand invisible waves
i long for stillness
hollow white-amber light
leaking into my bones
turns them to dust
retreat from the harrowing sound
take solace
and collapse under the weight
of the faintest whisper
cut deep
watch the signal rise
collapse under the weight of silence
