drift
carried on the thick dead air
to the hollowed place
where the lights swallow the sky
empty vessels roam splintered grounds
driven by a distant pulse
blood fed through jagged veins
driven by echoes
and here i stand
the last heirs of deception
have rusted away
and here i stand
monolith of indulgence
a beacon of failure
