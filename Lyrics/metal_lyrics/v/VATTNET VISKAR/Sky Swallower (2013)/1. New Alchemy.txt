the air ignites
with a stroke of my hand
embers rain upon your home
watch as i plant the seed
and take root
deep into the ground
feel, the earth shakes
i spread
erupt from shifting sands
erupt into child of man
i spread like flame
setting your hearts ablaze
i take hold
and bloom into frail lungs
draw ragged breaths
i am inside these week-old weary eyes
