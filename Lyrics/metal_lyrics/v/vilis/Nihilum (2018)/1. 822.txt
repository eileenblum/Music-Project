Before there was light
Before there was God and the Archangels
There wasnât nothing, there was the Darkness
A horribly destructive, amoral force that was beaten back by God and his Archangels in a terrible war
God locked the Darkness away where it could do no harm and he created a Mark that would serve as both lock and key which he entrusted to his most valued lieutenant, Lucifer
But the Mark began to exert its own will, revealed itself as a curse and began to corrupt
Lucifer became jealous of man
God banished Lucifer to Hell
And the Darkness remained locked away until now
