[God]
I cannot allow this to continue
I have failed you by letting the darkness consume
Too far beyond reach

[Lucifer]
Wait a minute
You think I'm who's lost?
And that I need saving?
That I'm the one who chose to be blind?
Where was your sight when we searched for a guide?

[God]
Look how far you've strayed, just brimming with pride
Renouncing your loyalty to all of mankind

[Lucifer]
Mankind? Mankind?!
A stillbirth forced into existence
Yet you always held them above us
Your own children!

[God]
Your jealousy has festered to rot
A victim of your own consciousness
You willing forsake yourself
So deaf to the truth

[Lucifer]
Yet you-

[God]
What!?

[Lucifer]
You just-

[God]
There is no one to blame
Not me, not humans, just you

[Lucifer]
You feign innocence when you know well
It was you who sealed this fate

[God]
Just tell me why you gave up on yourself
After all that we've done was it all vein?
Has the darkness taken hold of your soul
Or has your arrogance flourished within?

[Lucifer]
You would watch your kingdom burn
And see your sons be bled dry
Before even thinking to intervene
Yet I'm accused of self-indulgence?

[God]
You know not of the torment I endure
As you wallow in self-pity and misery
I see through your facade
You lack the resolve to face your demons

[Lucifer]
I know not of your torment?
Ha ha ha
Bathing in ignorance as if it were bliss

[God]
You crave the touch of the darkness
Abandoned your grace for the void's embrace

Truly I believed you to be the one
The one to purge the darkness and bring transcendence
Fell prey to self-indulgence
Prepare yourself for judgement

[Lucifer]
You are not God of mine
The falsest of idols, a mockery to the divine
There is nothing to fear
Now behold your salvation is here

[chanting]
A sinister moon looms over Earth
As the darkness has given birth
To the most vile curse
Within its will you shall be immersed

[God]
You have bestowed a feeling far worse
As my hands are forced to be your hearse
Choose your last words wisely

[Lucifer]
Tell me how it feels to be eclipsed
Left to decompose upon the crucifix
I'll feast on the screams of the insolent
Their futility ended deliberately

[God]
In the end they will say I have won
While I alone mourn the death of my son
