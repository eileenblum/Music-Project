Abel wasnât talking to God, he was talking to Lucifer
Lucifer was going to make my brother into his pet
I couldnât bear to watch him be corrupted
So I offered a deal
Abelâs soul in Heaven for my soul in Hell
Lucifer accepted as long as I was the one who sent Abel to Heaven
So I killed him, became a soldier of Hell
A knight
