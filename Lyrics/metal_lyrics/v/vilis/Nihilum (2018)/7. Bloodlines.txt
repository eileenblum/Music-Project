Seduction of the first born
To my allegiance he has been sworn
Seduction of the first born
And limb from limb I shall watch him be torn

Cast into perdition as a victim
An outcome Fate had already written
And still Iâve been damned for refusing to bend my knee
To the swine that canât even gaze upon the divine
They were given everything and reduced it all to nothing

But just as they think theyâve lost it all
I will prove that there is always something more to be taken

Tell me can you say that you even try to save me
Forced to accept Iâm just a reject
Tell me did you think that I just might need saving
Left me drowning as the calm turned to storm

I find myself praying, not out of despair
But with the hope that youâre listening
To the cries of your children
As I contort them into beings more fitting of their nature
Those who once worshiped the light
Now curse your name in the dark

Spineless, faithless, helpless insects
To my every whim youâll all be subjected
The blood of the innocent forever tainted in His name
The gateway to the void sealed with the Mark of Cain

Tell me can you say that you even try to save me
Forced to accept Iâm just a reject
Tell me did you think that I just might need saving
Left me drowning as the calm turned to storm

Seduction of the first born
To my allegiance he has been sworn
Seduction of the first born
And for his brother he will soon need to mourn

Tell me can you say that you even try to save me
Forced to accept Iâm just a reject
Tell me did you think that I just might need saving
Left me drowning as the calm turned to storm
