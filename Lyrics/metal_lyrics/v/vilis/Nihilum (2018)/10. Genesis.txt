Consciousness is a disease
And Iâll purge, Iâll rid it from the world
Disassociate the living from the dead
A walking manifestation of sin
I am the harbinger of the end

I feel the hands of the damned clawing at my neck
Eradicated by the need to speak but never to be heard
Because nothing can compare to giving up everything you have
Only to find thereâs always something more to lose

I confess, I confess, I confess
Itâs slowly killing me
Yet I feel so alive
I plead guilty
I found this all to be the only thing that satisfies me

Not a savior
Not their guardian
But I cannot deny thatâ¦

I am the devilâs advocate
Nothing more than a pathetic surrogate
But I will play by part because I canât suppress the Mark
I am the answer to every unheard prayer
Iâve passed the end of my rope but Death just wonât let me choke

This is the beginning of their misery
Not a single living being will be left breathing
My presence corrupting, infecting and tainting the mind of the weak
Begging for salvation at the hands of damnation
Letting them survive to watch the faith leave from their eyes

I bear the curse
I bear the curse of the fallen

The final pages of history shall be written in the blood of humanity
As I sever the wires connecting their false reality
No hesitation to cease all creation
And yet from Fate there is no deviation

Not a savior
Not their guardian
And I am nothing more than...
Not a savior
Not their guardian
But I cannot deny thatâ¦

I am the devilâs advocate
Nothing more than a pathetic surrogate
But I will play by part because I canât suppress the Mark
I am the answer to every unheard prayer
Iâve passed the end of my rope but Death just wonât let me choke

My patience wasted waiting for mankind to awaken
But instead they forced themselves into extinction

Your God is dead
I am the usurper
And you are all beneath me
Bow down, bow down to me
Bow down before the absolute
