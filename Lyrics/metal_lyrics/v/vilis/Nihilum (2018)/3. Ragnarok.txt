Iâve been enslaved by this affliction
And at first I felt the thirst overcome by addiction
Twisting my grace as my consciousness was slowly erased
Every day I fought against an entity that began to convince me that we were one in the same
Could it be?

Upon my soul I felt a sinister stain
Consciousness all but erased as if it had been engraved
But this burden was mine alone
As he sat on his throne
By my hand he will atone

To a sensation of temptation left with no explanation
As the Darkness festered within
And it constantly whispersâ¦

I canât hold my tongue any longer
While this filth breeds and conquers
And Iâm weighed down by their failures
Begging and praying to their so-called savior
I must be the one to end it
While this filth breeds and conquers
And I wonât waste another second
Begging and praying to this so-called savior

Idly witnessing my plunge into the depths
As I descended alone reaping all that he had sown
Yet I swallowed this obsession
Only to have him question my intentions
Never will I seek redemption

Now the Mark has spread beyond my restraint
The light that was left has begun to feel so faint
And I am torn from everything except the void
This plague has found every doubt in me to exploit

Humanity has no place in our reality
Corrupting his kingdom, and Iâm the symptom
To a sensation of temptation left with no explanation
As the Darkness festered within
And it constantly whispersâ¦

I canât hold my tongue any longer
While this filth breeds and conquers
And Iâm weighed down by their failures
Begging and praying to their so-called savior
I must be the one to end it
While this filth breeds and conquers
And I wonât waste another second
Begging and praying to this so-called savior

Asphyxiate on your words or regurgitate mine

Alone I lead the purge of mankind
Though containing the Dark has left my kingdom blind
I am the dusk, the dawn, the beginning and the end
All who oppose will meet Death
