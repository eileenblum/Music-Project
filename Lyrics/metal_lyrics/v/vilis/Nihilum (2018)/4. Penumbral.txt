You could never fathom the chasm inside my mind
Or all of the pieces of myself that Iâve had to leave behind

Though the Darkness is confined I fear light suspends on borrowed time
I pray and I pray that the chain of fate shall unbind
Instead you only focus on what I couldnât do for you
As you continue to bear thoughts to the whispers it will spew

The one I thought could restain the Darkness and bear the Mark
Depraved hands extend from the Void to rip you apart
And yet you only complain and canât accept the blame

No way to justify as much as you try to deny
You were meant to be their savior
You were meant to be their guardian
Meant to protect everyone and everything from what lies within
Now I just canât believeâ¦

In you I placed my faith
With you no life is safe as the Darkness engraves
So with heavy hands and a heavier heart
I must cast you down, clip your wings and put up the shroud

You are the reminder of my greatest failure
One day I pray you see it clearer and forgive me for this, for everything
To forsake my blood, my son
For the greater good nothing there is nothing else to be done

This is a fight you cannot win
Yet alone I wonât be able to wage war against the Darkness again
With no other choice I condemn you to Hell
And spend milenia deciding how to live with myself
But I must, I must do this to preserve all Iâve built

No way to justify as much as you try to deny
You were meant to be their savior
You were meant to be their guardian
Meant to protect everyone and everything from what lies within
Now I just canât believeâ¦


In you I placed my faith
With you no life is safe as the Darkness engraves
So with heavy hands and a heavier heart
I must cast you down, clip your wings and put up the shroud

Consumed by Darkness, given in to this false idol
From your exile there will be no reprisal
This shall be an example for all to see
Betray your God and there will be nowhere to flee

Slam the gates of Heaven
Split your soul in seven
Bear the weight of your failure

Parasitic corruption when will you at last discover
Your pride alone is the reason youâll forever suffer
A hollow throne veiled in sulfur
Now let Hell be born
Hail the King of scorn

This will be an example for all to see
Betray your God there will be nowhere to flee
