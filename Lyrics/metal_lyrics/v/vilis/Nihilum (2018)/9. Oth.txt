Passing down the line a reminder that theyâre running out of time
A curse that evolves, consciousness dissolves
Absolving all of thought, light is no longer sought
Branded like cattle creeping towards slaughter
Silently observed by the Darkstalker

A conjoined human and demon, the unholiest of unions
There is no hope left, revoked, blasphemy in matrimony
An eternal gaze from a formless face
Fixed upon him the veil wears so thin
The abyss seeping through his skinâ¦

Slave in chains
Foreign thoughts he canât explain
Now ingrained
Too much sustain
Yet he only has a single goal to attain
Release me to assert claim on my domain

Watch the sun fade, silently invade into the mind
Feigning whispers from the divine
Contorting the soul of man beyond its limitations
Preparing their vessels for mass assimilation
In the absence of air, despair
A glimpse into the void

The disparity in morality, plague of mortality
Pure blood runneth dry, looming from the blackened sky
Surrender, pretender, tormenter
Behold the cusp of rebirth
Eager to pull all into the Earth

Slave in chains
Foreign thoughts he canât explain
Now ingrained
Too much sustain
Yet he only has a single goal to attain
Release me to assert claim on my domain

Streets littered with shrieking sacks of meat
Pitifully pleading for my replete
Insaitably reaping their life force
Gluttony resonates from its true source

Slave in chains
Foreign thoughts he canât explain
Now ingrained
Too much sustain
Yet he only has a single goal to attain
Release me to assert claim on my domain
