In the beginning it was just you and me
Meant to be the only ones that existence would need
For you it was never enough
I hated you for needing something else
Something that wasnât me
HA

The void lives inside yourself
Endlessly creating hoping that something will satisfy
But nothing could
Victim of your own mind
Trapped inside and thereâs nothing left to hide

Now upon this heresy
Through an incarnation of jealousy
I emerge as a being of infinite insight
How clear it is that the sun shines upon all with false light
Preying on the children you have forsaken

A pathetic excuse for a diety
Buried beneath self induced futility
As the Darkness was born of failure to bring balance to creation
Endowed with sentience bearing a single objective
To consume all light
Bringing forth eternal night

Witness the end of all there is and was
Accept this fate for destiny wonât change
This is your last glimpse upon all thatâs known
All life proven worthless
