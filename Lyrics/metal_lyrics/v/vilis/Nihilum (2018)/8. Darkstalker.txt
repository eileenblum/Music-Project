Preparations for our infiltration and subsequent manipulations nearing completion
I may be confined to this cell, festering in my personal Hell
Concealing their black eyes behind a familiar disguise
Twisting his children into my covetous servants

Manipulated by the tongue of the serpent
All to willing to decimate this reality that youâve constructed
Held together through falsifications
I shall strip his false sovereignty and make my claim

Using his descendants to reap repentance
With an accursed legion the exiled son shall return
Being the conviction that I will witness Heaven burn

Collective hivemind
An army of puppets
Sworn from his children I herd them from the light because...

We will be those who tear apart the barrier
Between this world and the Darkness
Feed the void within, this world will meet its end
There I reign, king of nothing

Though this fate will leave you desperate, there is no alternate
I am malevolence incarnate
The bloodshot eyes petrified behind the guise noxious with lies
This shall be the last time light shines upon the Earth
For dawn will only bring us further into the Dark

My wretched apostles will masquerade as the vile offspring of the recreant
Permeating the mass population
Left to write in their filth but when the time finally comesâ¦

We will be those who tear apart the barrier
Between this world and the Darkness
Feed the void within, this world will meet its end
There I reign, king of nothing

For in their final moments all will be clear
A savior was never going to appear

Die as you lived, alone and unknown
As rivers run red with blood from the pure
The ground fissures under the strength of my commands
Realising at last we all suffer in vain
Itâs meaningless, you cannot resist
Feast your eyes on all that youâve known
Tell me can you fathom your God does not exist
