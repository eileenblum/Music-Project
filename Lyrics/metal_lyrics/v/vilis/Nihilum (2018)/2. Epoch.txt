Before creation I stood encompassing all that was
Until a hollow deity sought to fill the void
And in his light omens arose from the abyss
Bearing the universal truth
âDarkness shall reign eternallyâ

I was the beginning and Iâll be the end
I will be all that there is
There was none before me and none shall surpass
When the light fades from existence still I will remain
And that light shall be ingested by the Dark
For I am the primordial entity, a being of infinite density

As the vermin bred in his image were once granted their own paradise
Yet they would rather ravage and pillage
Desecrating the holy land they walked upon, ignorant of their sins
Although I warned him of their fate all he cared to do was create
My concern answered with betrayal

I predate Life
I predate Death
I predate your God

Eons have passed and my presence forgotten as his sons insides slowly turn rotten
As retribution for his transgressions
Time and space are boundaries I reside outside
As he covets sovereignty through worship from those monstrosities
Long ago I awoke to the prison Iâm in
Shackled to the rotting skin of his closest kin
Subtlety drawing him into the abyss
To bring about an era in which Darkness holds dominion

The sun will be extinguished by my hand
The torment I withstand will pale in comparison
He has blindly forsaken his offspring
To the anguish Iâll inflict due to his blasphemy
The dark will subtlety creep over all as I envelop his whole domain
Until I can finally force him to see
That which heâs conceived means absolutely nothing to me

Upon the souls of his children I will consume
Until at last I am exhumed from my tomb
My rise shall by witnessed soon
As the embodiment of destruction
This fate cannot be changed for denied
Their lungs constrict devoid of air
The Earth becomes a grave for his family
Can you feel the approach of the coming Dark
Bearing down upon life with unforeseen might, born of spite
I exist beyond your comprehension
What he has done proves to be a mockery
Soon I shall be set free from purgatory
