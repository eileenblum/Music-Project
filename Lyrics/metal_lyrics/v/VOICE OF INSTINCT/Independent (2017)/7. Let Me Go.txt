Let me go alone
Let me go explore beyond
And taste it all
Witness all that is waiting to be
Future's there for me
And the past reduced
To just a grain of sand
I will go and you will not stop me

Seeing = believing
And hope is deceiving
Bars in all windows
And locks on all doors
Bow to the ignorance
Mother of conflict
Open up
Just let me go
Alone

Let me go alone
Let me have my chance
At having tiny fragment
Of the eden that you were born to
Eyes of longing
Future is reduced
To just a grain of sand
Will there ever be chance for us all?

Seeing = believing
And hope is deceiving
Bars in all windows
And locks on all doors
Bow to the ignorance
Follow your leader
You just know better
Now open up
Just let me go
Alone

Let me go alone
Let me leave this cage of gold
This place of falsehood
Cruel intentions behind greedy eyes
Oh the irony
Place of unlimited power
Lacking the one thing
That every man's heart truly needs

Seeing = believing
And hope is deceiving
Bars in all windows
And locks on all doors
Bow to the ignorance
Follow your leader
You just know better
Now open up
Just let me go
Alone

Seeing = believing
And hope is deceiving
Bars in all windows
And locks on all doors
Bow to the ignorance
Mother of conflict
Open up
Just let me go
Alone
