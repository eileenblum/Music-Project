Just because my look is different
And because our colors don't match
Because my features look distant
And my background you don't trust

That does not mean I am a thief and
My passion is to relish mayhem
Doesn't that seem little painful
Can we just agree that you don't know me

Scratch my name
Scratch my soul
Labelize
Dehumanize me
But the truth still remains
You don't know me

Just because my preferences
Are so different from your own taste
Alienated my love seems
Perverted my passion looks

That does not mean I do this on my
Own volition to make you sick
This is just how I was born
This is who I am but you don't know me

Scratch my name
Scratch my soul
Labelize
Dehumanize me
But the truth still remains
You don't know me

Is this the top of our game
Is this where our path leads
Collective guilt reigns supreme
Stronger
Injustice is redefined

And so you simplify
Your world your
Reality
Twist this hard complex life
To fairytale

Just give in and become
One of those who close their eyes

Just because I am from far a-
Way and you don't comprehend me
My beliefs and my customs
My worries and my fears

That does not mean
I am the same as
Few of the real
True monsters around
You know that we mean no harm
You know that but you don't give a damn

Scratch my name
Scratch my soul
Labelize
Dehumanize me
But the truth still remains
You don't know me
