Where is the end of our universe?
Who can tell
What is real
What we can reveal
Isn't it way to hell?

Too many ways and possibilities
Now decide
Make your choice!
Or listen our voice
Encourages suicide

Voice of instinct is dying
He's almost gone

I would believe that
People are not so bad
But I realize
Vision of paradise
Makes a chaos in head

I don't understand
Why the things we planned
Have to come to an end

Voice of instinct vanished
You're on your own
Because

We are asking too much
All gifts of nature
Are killed by our touch
Price of being too high

And death is still standing by
