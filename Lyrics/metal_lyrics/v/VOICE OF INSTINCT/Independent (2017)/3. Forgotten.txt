Following the endless road
To better days ahead
No other way
Following your train of thought
I begin to see

Misguided crusaders of our times
Minds confused
Blinded by this fear
That needs to be justified

Hearts divided
Souls forgotten in time and space
Until the end
They don't have a say in this conflict of
Hearts divided
Thoughts corroded
Manipulated, exploited, abused

Can you see
Can you see what we left behind our backs
Yes you can
What is it
That you're afraid of
Isn't it obscure

Jumping-jack deceived into campaign
Into this quest
For his definitive deep decline

Hearts divided
Souls forgotten in time and space
Until the end
They don't have a say in this conflict of
Hearts divided
Thoughts corroded
Manipulated, exploited, abused

Hearts divided
Souls forgotten in time and space
Until the end
Hearts divided
Thoughts corroded
Manipulated, exploited, abused

You are not above the others
You just put yourself beneath
There is not much difference between you
And what you think is your nightmare

And there is not much difference
Between us
No, we are not that different
You and me
