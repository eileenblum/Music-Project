Never mind
Never mind
All the pain
It is done
It is gone
In the past
Standing here
On two feet
Proves that I
Can get stronger

Part of me
Part of you
All the hurt
Shapes my mind
Forms my heart
Makes my life
Manifold
Completed
Colorful
Independent

Hear the song composed by life
How it's beautiful
Makes you feel you never know what's next
Every tone makes me feel the fire
That can burn me no more
That can hurt me no more

Never mind
Never mind
All the grief
There is a
Meaning in
Every harm
All of it
Makes you feel
Wiser now
Makes you stronger

Part of me
Part of you
All the fears
They are gone
And with them
All the tears
Now you stand
High and proud
You are now
Independent

Hear the song composed by life
How it's beautiful
Makes you feel you never know what's next
Every tone makes me feel the fire
That can burn me no more
That can hurt me no more

Every note
Every chord
Every singing voice
They reflect the pain
Add to your experience

Without them
You would be
Just an empty shell
They make you who you are
They paint all the colors of your life

Hear the song composed by life
How it's beautiful
Makes you feel you never know what's next
Every tone makes me feel the fire
That can burn me

Hear the song composed by life
(Hear the song that is written by life)
How it's beautiful
(Hear the tune)
Makes you feel you never know what's next
(That made you who you are)
Every tone makes me feel the fire
(Every tone is like fire)
That can burn me no more
(That burns me no more)
That can hurt me no more
(Hurts me no more)
