Do you feel ugly?
Do you feel fat?
It's not gonna change, until your death

Do you feel needed?
Do you feel wise?
Don't let me waiting, I'm not offering twice

Here I am, I'll set you free,
It takes a while, not eternity
Close your eyes
And give me your soul
Well you're anyway useless

When your weakening heart
Poisoned your eyes
There is no way out
Say your last goodbyes

When you hate yourself
For a way that you are

(Your) doubts and pain keeps me alive

You say you're stupid,
You say you're fool,
There is no way how you could be cool

You have no power,
You have no will
It would be best if you stay silent still

Here I am, I'll set you free,
It takes a while, not eternity
Close your eyes
And give me your soul
Well you're anyway useless

When your weakening heart
Poisoned your eyes
There is no way out
Say your last goodbyes

When you hate yourself
For a way that you are

(Your) doubts and pain keeps me alive

Hiding,
Searching and loosing,
Heart beating
And drowning
In my own sadness
Now brought me my madness

Yes I need to be accepted
My life was neglected
I don't want it anymore!

When my weakening heart
Poisoned my eyes
Yes there is a way
Say my last goodbyes

To my doubts and pain
To inferiority

I believe I'm strong enough!

When my confidence
Showed me value of my live
Yes I took a chance
And I have to strive

When you love yourself
For the way just you are

Inner strength and peace keeps me alive
