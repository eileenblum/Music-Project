Hear me now my dear child
Hear me now if you will
Can you see the changes?
Did they happen so fast?

Reaching even higher
Stronger limbs, rampant leaves
And the world seems smaller
Getting distant and strange

'Cause the slower we rise
Then the faster we fall
And the sooner we realize who we are
Then the later arrives our demise

Hear me now my dear child
Hear what I have to say
Can you see them rise?
Those who close their eyes

And the slower we rise
Then the faster we fall
And the more we strive for us standing aside
Then the fewer of them will see
Light of the day before it's too late

Many of your close ones
Many are turning round
All the best intentions
Dire deeds they can bring

When the slower we rise
Then the faster we fall
We will have to face the facts of who we are
That the more that divides us
The more we must look for the common ground
