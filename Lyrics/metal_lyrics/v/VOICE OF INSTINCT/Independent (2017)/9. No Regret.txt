In the land
Where the shadows of present
Cover dark past
In the time
When the disregard
Became widespread norm

Fortune is by my side
I will show no regret
With you or those that support you
No there is no regret

Sophisticated
Civilized are our deeds
On this high ground
We see nothing but ourselves
We need no one else

Keep in mind
We are more and more proud
Of those that were before
Well, because without struggle
Without a fight
How can we be proud?

Fortune is by my side
I will show no regret
With you or those that support you
No there is no regret

Sophisticated
Civilized are our deeds
On this high ground
We see nothing but ourselves
We need no one else

Solitude, isolation
For those who close their eyes
But how far
Can you ever get
When you're on your own?

Fortune is by my side
I will show no regret
With you or those that support you
No there is no regret

Sophisticated
Civilized are our deeds
On this high ground
We see nothing but ourselves
We need no one else
