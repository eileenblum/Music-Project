Woken to a world
Brave new universe of
Unexplored adventures
Look around yourself
Taste the innocence but
It's not gonna last for long

Everything went so fast
This is the end of innocence and therefore
It seems like the end of all

We moved on, got rid of
All of the features of a young mind but this
Selfishness prevails in us
Forever

We have learned to build these walls in us
We have learned to camouflage and hide
This inconsideration but still
It is here
It will wake

Everything went so fast
This is the end of innocence and therefore
It seems like the end of all

We moved on, got rid of
All of the features of a young mind but this
Selfishness prevails in us
Forever

Woken to a world
Fading universe that
Slowly forms a new one
You advanced today
Progress unchained but
Something here still feels not right

Everything went so fast
This is the end of innocence and therefore
It seems like the end of all

We moved on, got rid of
All of the features of a young mind but this
Selfishness prevails in us
It is here
It will wake
One day
