Deep in your green but blue eyes
I can decipher what you hide
Behind your iron mask
Built with fear and distant sights
Please don't be afraid, I'm just like you
Hear my voice and feel my bleeding heart

Come to me
Lie me down and tight my knees
Close my eyes and love me
Until my tears hit the ground

Buried inside of the pride
Lies a soul that earns to try
Learn all the mysteries
That live on the tips of your fingers
Show me, teach me, please me
Together we can reach the gates of hell
