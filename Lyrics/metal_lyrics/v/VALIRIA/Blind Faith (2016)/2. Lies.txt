Pretty faces everywhere
Perfect bodies just for sale
I don't longer wanna know
What the mirror has to tell

And it's so hard to fight
All the images all the time
Soon you'll realise
You want it all

Even when I didn't want it a second ago

I love to consume the lies
And all the beauty inside
They make me feel so alive
For just some time

Even though I know it's not
I can't help it get to me
Sometimes it's so frustrating
How I can't control my needs

And it's so hard to fight
All the images all the time
Soon you'll realise
You want it all

Even when I didn't want it a second ago
