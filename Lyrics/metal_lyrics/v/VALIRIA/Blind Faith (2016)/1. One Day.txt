No, we'll never bow down
To your twisted standards
Don't even think that we will
Let the world forget all your sins
We can still hear them screaming
Crying out for help
Why, why am I burning
While staring at your smile

One day this will be over
Then you'll play my game
Feel my pain
I'll make sure to be the one
Holding the flame

One day this will be over
Then you'll play our game
Feel our pain
We'll make sure to be the ones
Holding the flames

How can you call yourself
A place of love and respect
When your hands are full of
Innocent blood, innocent children
We will never forgive how
Lives are so worthless
To those who claim to follow
A god of love, he's made of lies

I'll make you, I'll make you suffer
