When will I really heal?
I'm sick of these memories rotting in me
They keep coming and going like ghosts of a dead past
Fighting to relive

She told me this turn it was my own choice to make
What will it be?
To keep living in yesterday or embrace today

I'm starting to forget your face
Then someday I will erase you from my pain
This is the final move of our dance
I'll rip apart my heart so nothing can remain

I'm climbing this mountain day after day
And I'm leaving our grave behind
Now you're are where you really deserve
Buried six feet under my real life

I heard her, she was right
You can't hurt me anymore
Now that I know
Who you really are, you're worth of my pity and nothing more
