So naive, I could never know your thoughts behind your mask of love
How could I know what love was when you weren't ever real?

You shot me down
Cut my wings like you did to
My dreams and caged me inside your insecurities

I'll never forget nor ever forgive, Christ is so far away from me
You don't deserve any second thoughts about your cruel sins

You'll forever be in my worst memories
