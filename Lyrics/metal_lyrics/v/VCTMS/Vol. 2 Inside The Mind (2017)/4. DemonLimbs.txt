Inability to cope with life effectively
Can't pinpoint why I'm worrying excessively 
Overthinking was the death of me
Checked out, forgotten all about rationality
Nothing makes sense in my head anymore
It's all flooded with guilt and remorse
Even with the most honorable intentions
I always make a shitty impression

I have a love/hate relationship with everything
Conflicted with the way I feel, it's unsettling
Feeling like dirt,
Feeling like that's even more than I'm worth,
Feeling like this life isn't more than I deserve

Bitter//relief, bitter//relief
Rid me of this unease
Bitter//relief, bitter//relief
Tell me that it gets easy

The carousel never stops
Exhaustion clings onto every bone that I've got

I'm to damaged to love, to broken to care
Emptiness is all that's there [2x]

I have a love/hate relationship with everything
Conflicted with the way I feel, it's unsettling
Feeling like dirt,
Feeling like that's even more than I'm worth,
Feeling like this life isn't more than I deserve
