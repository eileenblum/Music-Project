I don't understand anybody 
And nobody will ever understand me 
And I'm tired of trying to explain myself 
Because I don't see the point anymore 

I've come to terms that I will never amount to anything 
All the effort I put forth is always for nothing 
So fuck it 

Here's to giving in and giving up 
Hating who you've become 
Here's to giving in and giving up 
And never being good enough to anyone 

I hate that I don't belong 
I hate that I'm just strung along 
And I hate that I care for those who don't care at all 

I'm the one they know and loathe 
It's not fair, but that's just how life goes 
I'm the one they all know and loathe 
It's not fair, but that's just how life goes 
Here's to giving in and giving up 
Hating who you've come
And never being good enough to anyone 

I'm the one they all know and loathe 
It's not fair, but that's just how life goes 
I'm the one they all know and loathe 
And I hate that it's all that it'll ever know 
I'm always gonna be the odd man out 
Three cheers for feeling sorry for our fucking selves
