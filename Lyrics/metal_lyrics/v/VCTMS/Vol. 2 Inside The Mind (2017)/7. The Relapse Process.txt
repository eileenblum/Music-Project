Incomplete, you complete me
But who am I kidding, in reality you ruined me
I miss my innocence, I wish I could fix this
Gone beyond repair, desperation is all that's there

Incomplete, you complete me, uh

I still think of you often, even if you left me here to rot
And I'm trembling, caught up in the worst days
I forgot why I'm here in the first place
I'm trembling, caught up in the worst days
I forgot why I even fucking chose to stay

I'm in pieces, can't keep myself together so I'll forget about myself
I should I make an effort?
I'm coming undone

Use me as you will
Pull my strings until my self-esteem rebuilds
The guilt, the guilt, oh I know the drill
I'll apologize for everything until time stands still
Use me as you will

I still think of you often, even if you left me here to rot
And I'm trembling, caught up in the worst days
I forgot why I'm here in the first place
I'm trembling, caught up in the worst days
I forgot why I even fucking chose to stay

Scathing takes shape in my brain
Fathoming the senseless and the insane
We fall back to its place, rationality does feel the same

Psychotic break, desperation is all that I know
Holding on to hoping I can even truly let go [2x]

[Darius Tehrani of SPITE]
Spite cvlt motherfucker

I'm stressing over all the things that I can't control
Bend over backwards, attempting to feel whole
My mind just wondered off tonight, my thoughts they decompose
This vacancy's to comfortable for me to let go
