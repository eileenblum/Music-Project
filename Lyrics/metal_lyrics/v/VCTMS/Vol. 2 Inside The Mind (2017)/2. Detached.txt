Hollow, I'm dead behind the eyes 
Barely breathing, I'm hardly alive 
My pain is constant, I'm addicted to the hurt 

Should I get my hopes up? Should I not? 
Sometimes the doubt in my mind is all that I've got 
I always think the worst, jumping to conclusions 
I can't help, but to expect disappointment 

I want to turn it all off, I wish I didn't feel at all 
Welcome in what gets under my skin and I know it's all my fault 
Fuck my flaws I know that this is all wrong 
I condescend my confidence 
And I can't help that I'm a walking contradiction 
Downing my prescriptions, undermining my condition 

So what? 

I'm sick, deluded, nothing but a burden 
To my family, my friends, I'm not a good person 

And I can't say that I fit in 
And I can't say that I do anything right 
And I can't say that I'm doing fine 
(And I can't say that I'm doing fine) 

Hollow, I'm dead behind the eyes 
Barely breathing, I'm hardly alive 
My pain is constant, I'm addicted to the hurt 
Set aside my emotions, they never come first
