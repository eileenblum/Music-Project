Time stands still while all our days fade
Watch life pass you by, I bet your heart breaks
You tell me that you're okay
Heart overshadowed by greed and disdain

I'll forever pity the living
Putting faith into a world that's less than giving
You and me, we don't mean anything
The good die young cause pain just leads to suffering

I'll forever pity the living
Putting faith into a world that's less than giving
You and me, we don't mean a God damned thing
Because the good die young and pain just leads to suffering

I'm suffocating with every breathe
Wishing that every moment wasn't spent
Hoping that one day I can be that person again
But I'm turning into everything I'm against

I'm contorted, overwhelmed, by guilt and grief
One by one my friends becoming one with the deceased
Numb to the feeling of losing everything
Pain is all I feel please take away this suffering

Death take me, myok

Someone you once knew, lifeless
Buried down deep below in a casket
Asking yourself what had happened
Another tragic accident
Anesthesia, I need you
Save me from this mental abuse
Save me from all the time I'll spend thinking of you

Put me to sleep I never want to wake up
Let me take your place
Sew my eyes shut
I'll never be at peace, just leave me to grieve
I know I'll spend the rest of my days feeling this unease
