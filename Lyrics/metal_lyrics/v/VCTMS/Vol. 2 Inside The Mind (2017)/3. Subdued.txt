The last thing that went through my head
Was a bullet I carved your name in.
And I didn't get into heaven
But I thought I'd let you know I wish I never let you in

Love, oh, we'll never get enough
The insubstantial feeling that sustains you like a drug
Love, yeah, it's never enough
It's the chaos that controls you and goes off like a loaded gun

Damaged goods, but still one of a kind
Deception lies within deceit, you're the poison that resides
Inside my mind, I think about it all the time
How I'm mentally destroyed
I deserve that, right?

Getting used to the abuse I can never be the same
Will you ever understand what you took away
Love, that's something I thought I could trust
But I guess I'm the one that wasn't enough

I just doesn't make sense
The people closest to you hurt you in ways you never thought that they would do
Someone you thought you knew, someone you put your faith into,
Become nothing more than a toxic presence that fills the room
Ha!

A stranger now, like everyone else
That took a piece of me just for their selve
Another person comfortable with wearing my out
I never gained the strength to move on
Why couldn't I just walk out?

Settle for less, second best
Something I should have expected
Settle for less, settle for less
Salt in the wound, I'm such a mess
Settle for less, second best
Oh, look who guessed it
Settle for less, one last request,
Tell me you love me, rip my heart out of my chest
