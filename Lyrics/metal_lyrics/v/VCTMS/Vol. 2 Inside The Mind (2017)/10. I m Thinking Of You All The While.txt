I'm thinking of you all the while

Take me, make me feel nothing
Take me, here I lay empty

Mr. Sandman, still sick of being alone
My uncontrolled emotions still the only thing that makes me feel at home
Without you, I'm miserable at best
A chronic liar, a has been that won't give it a rest

Take me, make me feel nothing
Take me, here I lay empty

Mr. Sandman, what don't I know?
Still at rock bottom with nowhere to go
I'm hitting the bottle, I'm cutting it close
Transparent and reckless, you know how this goes
Please oh please can this be something else

Take me, make me feel like nothing

Mr. Sandman, please please end my dream
Rid me from this wishful thinking
Wash away this empty feeling

Held my breath until I couldn't breathe
Sewed my eyes shut and now I can't see 
Cut my circulation until for years I've been numb
Pulled the trigger back and then I became someone!

Make me complete, yeah make me complete

The reaper reeled me in and I tried so hard to drown him out 
But my sins seeped through my skin
And sitting here wondering
Will you save me from this hell I am in?

Take me, make me feel like nothing

Mr. Sandman, please please end my dream
Take me here I lay empty, my thoughts are always so tempting.
