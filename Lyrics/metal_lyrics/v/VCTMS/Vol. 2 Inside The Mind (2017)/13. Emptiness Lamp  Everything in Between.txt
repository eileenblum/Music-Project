Resentment, it knows me best
Give into it to easily, it's a feeling I can't repress
Constricted lungs and lurching gut
Latching on to this vacancy, it's become my crutch

You can say I'm still built on mistakes
Day by day still swallowing more than I can take
You can say I'm still built on mistakes
Day by day still swallowing more than I can take

Sickness worked it's way in
I'm right back to where I began
Praying to these demons within
I hate that they always win [2x]

Bad days and disappointment, all that becomes relevant
Time is moving on and I just can't keep up with it
I'm a nobody, I'm nothing special
I second guess myself
I'm overwhelmed by the pressure 
Trapped in this place of uncertainty

Here I am empty and everything in between

Sedate this feeling that's wasting me away
Absent of light, I'm losing faith
Unwanted and still unloved
I'll always be convinced that I'm not good enough

All the days are starting to feel the same
And I'm afraid this is something that I'll never shake
I'm continuing to split at the seems
All I have is emptiness and everything in between
