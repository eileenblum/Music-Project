Bury me in the deep six
Deep breathes let it set in
Tear my mind into pieces
Just watch me fall apart [2x]

Clawing out I can feel it in my finger tips
Let me inflict pain on others just like you did
We all suffer in one way or another
And I know I haven't really recovered
Rotting from the inside out still torn from the way that you let me down
Again and again, I'm sick and tired of it
You antic and how you're so found of abandonment

Darkness, my old friend, what welcomes you here again? [2x]

Bury me in the deep six
Deep breathes let it set in
Tear my mind into pieces
Just watch me fall apart [2x]

I'm displaced in this moment cemented in time
Trying to find beauty behind these hollow lies
I don't know what I want anymore, or what I'm looking for
Nothing helps not even when the high takes it's course.

Even when the high takes its course, I'm still torn from all the fucked up things I felt before
Blegh!

No expression, just going through the motions
Through the motions
I dance with death just to keep my relevance.

[Jay from Unity TX rap:]
Cut through, cut through
Erase all the things I do

Bury me in the deep six
Deep breathes let it set in
Tear my mind into pieces
Just watch me fall apart

Bury me in the deep six
Just watch me fall apart
