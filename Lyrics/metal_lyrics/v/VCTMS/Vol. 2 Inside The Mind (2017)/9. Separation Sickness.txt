Loss, loss it's all we've got
Convince me you're sorry when I know that you're not
Damage is dealt, life loses its cause
The will to move on comes at a cost

It comes at a cost, life comes at a cost

Loss, loss it's all we've got
Convince me you're sorry when I know that you're not
Those moments spent just between me and you, 
We both know they'll never lose there value

[Hunter Young of Culture Killer:]
I always seem to fixate on the things I can't change
I've been stuck in the past for quit some time
Eternal sunshine of this spotless mind 
Splitting my brain to pass the time
Wiping the slate clean, lobotomy will this fix me?

I always seem to fixate on the things I can't change
I've been stuck in the past for quit some time
I remember the days when life was easy
Now those days are just a feeling
That is slipping away, it hurts to just move on
Now the people you love, now the people you miss
All I can do is reminisce
And sadness is revisited, it's ironic isn't it?

Loss, loss
It's all that we've got
Convince me you're sorry when I know that you're not
The damage is dealt
