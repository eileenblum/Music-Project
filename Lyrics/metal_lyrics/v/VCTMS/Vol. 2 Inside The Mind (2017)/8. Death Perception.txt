I've about had it with my antics
Over dramatic and manic, I'm unbalanced
Bitter romantic, might as well kill me while you're at it

Defeated and hopeless,
I'm sure most of you know this
Sedate me then maybe I wont feel so empty
Progressing so that I could feel something

Defeated and hopeless
Tragedy at your service
Anxiety and anger, you make me nervous
Come with out warning and leave when you feel like it

[John Robert C. of The Last Ten Seconds of Life:]
Killing my mood, killed off the smile
Please oh why wont you take me away for a while
I can't resist to feel hopelessness
Mental demons, hard to dismiss
Flirting with disaster, I'm still born bastard, I don't matter
With nothing to show 
A loser, a head case with a head space still sinking below

Still sinking below, I'm sinking below, sinking alone...

[Cade Armstrong of Peacekeeper:]
I wanna be somebody else
Sinking below, replace me this mess I am
I wanna be somebody else
Somebody else
I wanna feel something inside me, rebuilding

I wanna be somebody else
I wanna feel something other than guilt 
Am I gone? I can't tell
Doing all the things to lose myself

Mental demons hard to dismiss
Troubled senses, we co-exist
It's raining, it's pouring, the reaper is calling
And here I am still fucking drowning
Needles and pins, needles and pins
Insecurity builds, over thinking beings
Tell me when all of this end
Dealing with the devils hand again
Dealing with the devils hand again
