My head is a prison that nobody visits
I'm stuck in this hell and I can't find an exit
I wish things were different, I wish I could help it,
Stress keeps building
I can't fucking fix this

I'm a VCTM of my own mind
Anxious all the damn time
Not to far from the edge
I'm hanging by a fine line
Stranger in my own skin
Unhinged emotions
What's it like to feel real?
I've lost it again

I'm obsessed with doing the wrong thing
I'll never learn from my mistakes, it's a routine
I'll always be second best
It's something that I've learned to live with
I am a train wreck (I guess I am who I am)
I don't expect you to understand
I can't move on, I can't progress
Stuck at a stand still
I'm here stagnant

[Devin MacGillivary of Yuth Forever:]
Relapsing on the aftermath of the old me
My old ways composed of demon/limbs and a rope swing
Can't snap out of it
This is the reality
Of a lost mind with a destructive personality

Useless and irrelevant
Worthless and incompetent
Intolerable and belligerent
I can't even make sense of it
I'm sick of everything [3x]
