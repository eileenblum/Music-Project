I'm better off hanging from that ceiling
When I found everything a little less appealing
Now I'm dulled out and the worst has yet to come
My bitterness and self loathing has finally won
I'm better off hanging from that ceiling
When I found everything a little less appealing
Now I'm dulled out and the worst has yet to come
My bitterness and self loathing has finally won

We are all victims of our own minds

My youth may it rest in peace
It's not the same, nor will it ever be
At the centerfold hoping these thoughts cease
I'm sick of all the things I know I'll never achieve
Feeling pretty low, warranted to decompose
Bent backwards, why can't I let this go?
Desperation tears up my insides
If you love me I can love myself right?

Desperation tears up my insides
If you love me I can love myself right?
A people pleaser, an addiction to run its course
I'm still flooded with that guilt and remorse
Desperation tears up my insides
If you love me I can love myself right?

I'm better off hanging from that ceiling
When I found everything a little less appealing
Now I'm dulled out and the worst has yet to come
My bitterness and self loathing has finally won
Expended myself for the sake of others
Now my mental state lies within the gutter

Volume III of this collection, here's your introduction
Just someone who's obsessed with my own self destruction
Crippling stress and impulsion
A downer that's filled with unease, who wears their heart on their sleeve

And I've done all that I could but I can't resist hopelessness
I can't stop being a nervous wreck
I'll chew my nails to the bone
And grind my teeth till my mouth stays closed

Still irrelevant and useless

Fuck
