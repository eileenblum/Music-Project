The anesthetic never set in and I'm wondering what the hell I'm doing here

My body's giving out on me
Despite the pills and all this fucking therapy

The anesthetic never set in and I'm wondering if I'll ever feel alive again
I'm sick, I'm spent and I'm wearing thin
But I don't want this, why is this the life I live

My body's giving out on me
Despite the pills and all this fucking therapy

As I sit here in my hospital bed, it smells of alcohol and dead skin, my mind is rotting with each passing second
As I riddle with my depression, all under my discretion

The anesthetic never set in and I'm wondering if I'll ever feel alive again
I'm sick, I'm spent and I'm wearing thin
But I don't want this, why is this the life I live

The anesthetic never set in and I'm wondering if I'll ever feel alive again
I'm sick, I'm spent and I'm wearing thin
But I don't want this, why is this the life I live

My mind is rotting with each passing second
As I riddle with my depression

I've given life to this grief that I couldn't understand
Slumped heavy and dug my line in the sand
Lamentation that's all that could grow
The doubt you planted I've made it my home
Like the flowers outside my spirit is dead
Took out the dirt and I made this my bed
The anesthetic never set in and I'm wondering if I'll ever feel alive again
