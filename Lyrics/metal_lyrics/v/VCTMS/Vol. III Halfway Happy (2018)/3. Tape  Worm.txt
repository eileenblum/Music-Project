I aged each day while stress weighed heavy on my psyche
Night brings a hearse and I've felt fucking dead lately

My disposition is intrusive and I've been having difficulty
Accepting the fact I'm the reason for my misery
Overwhelmed by this debris of doubt, but disregard
Everyone left me to fall apart

Always on the edge and I don't know
Whether I want to keep above or sink below

Spending all the days biting my tongue
Holding my breath until I empty my lungs
Been wishing I meant something to someone
Look what you've done

Do you ever think about when you weren't so grey
When everything you did wasn't a mistake

Spending all the days biting my tongue
Holding my breath until I empty my lungs
Been wishing I meant something to someone
Look what you've done

You killed the light and laughed with malice so eager
We took delight in evil twisting our features
Repeater
Still the same and it burns everyday but the question remains
Were the weapon loaded?
If only hope had held on closer
La Haine still the same but the end grows closer

Spending all the days biting my tongue
Holding my breath until I empty my lungs
Been wishing I meant something to someone
Look what you've done
