Clinging to self depreciation and dissociation
I've dug holes so deep relying on self medication
Even with separation from the world, I'm losing to this sickness

My coping mechanisms became destructive
And counter productive, every day I'm exhausted
A ghost of who I used to be, when I look back nostalgia always seems to kill me
Is that it? Repression only goes so far until the layers of your skin peel
And the wounds left untreated, never learn to heal

Hindsight is a pathetic thing, who cares if you understand, when it's already too late
I don't care where I've been, if where I am is why I'm sinking
Is why I'm sinking

Will I ever enjoy my moments here anymore, or will time always escape me?
Sometimes I think I've felt everything, everything I'll ever feel
Nothing will be new, just lesser versions of what I've already felt

Just a ghost of who I used to be

Hindsight is a pathetic thing, who cares if you understand, when it's already too late
I don't care where I've been, if where I am is why I'm sinking
Clinging to self depreciation and dissociation
I've dug holes so deep relying on self medication
Repression only went so far until my skin peeled
These wounds left untreated, never learned to heal
