Stuck in a rut
I'm existing in the in between
Still empty and splitting at the seams
Misery, so good at killing my self esteem
The one of my dreams, still lucky you love me

Even when I don't love myself
You make me feel important
Almost like I'm someone else
Self loathing and self pity
Thanks for extending your help
You never made things easy
Taught me love is never enough
Showed me all I have is my bad luck

Subdued, I am broken at the thought of you
You're not the person that I fucking thought I knew

Motionless I've become undone
Overwhelmed by self disgust
Crippling form, forced to adjust
Vacancy still acts as my crutch
Vacancy still acts as my crutch

My doubt was all that bloomed
Fear was all that moved
And this pain inside my chest
Reminds me what I've been through
Reminds me what I've been through

Stuck in a rut
I'm existing in the in between
Forever empty, splitting at the seams
Misery, gave into you like nicotine
You're the devil in my bloodstream, the one thing I could never leave

Exhaustion fills the hole you left
These senseless sentiments I've tried hard to forget
I'm so fucking worn out the devil always wins
These demons on my back keep pulling me in
