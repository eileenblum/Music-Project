Still hollow and dead behind the eyes
I know I'm barely breathing, struggling to stay alive
My pain remains constant, I've always been addicted to the hurt
Set aside these emotions, they've never come first

Brittle and frail
So lay me restless
As I slowly derail

Silence never helped me sleep
Sadness only made me weak
I'm all but a memory

Brittle and frail
So lay me restless
As I slowly derail
Ache rips though my bones
Still stressing over things I can't control
Attempted to let go, this vacancy never made me feel whole

I was doomed to finish last

Still hollow and dead behind the eyes
I know I'm barely breathing, struggling to stay alive
My pain remains constant, I've always been addicted to the hurt
Set aside these emotions, they've never come first
