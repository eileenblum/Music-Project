Nothing's ever been beautiful
I thought that for quite some time
Everything ends and everyone dies
Death is a constant that I think about all the time
Where do I place these thoughts
Who can understand
How alone I feel
How alone I am

Still a victim of my own mind
Still can't do anything right
I'm composed of demon limbs
And I'm still anxious all the time
Bad days and disappointment
Will always be relevant
Ask yourself
Will anything ever be worth it?
