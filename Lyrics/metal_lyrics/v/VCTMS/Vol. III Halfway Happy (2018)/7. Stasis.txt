Clocks ticking and I'm losing myself to my mind
Bed of nails scraping by on borrowed time
I guess every rose has it's thorn right?
I guess everyone's gotta die sometime

The people closest to you, hurt you
In ways you never thought they would do
Just a stranger that you once knew
We're all toxic people that fill up the room
I've lost most faith in myself and even more in everyone else
Let's just be honest and admit we don't deserve to live

Haze drifted over and replaced the sun
Self esteem dissolved I lame legged and hung
Swallowed my guilt and accepted defeat
Here I lay hollow still face down on the concrete
I'm broken beneath the sting of heartbreak
Morphine to help with the pain
Intoxicate me so I can waste away

Clocks ticking and I'm losing myself to my mind
Bed of nails scraping by on borrowed time
I guess every rose has it's thorn right?
I guess everyone's gotta die sometime

Here's to feeling sorry for yourself

Still the one you know and loathe
Still the one you loathe
Life's fucked and that's just how the story goes
Three cheers to giving in, yeah I gave up
I've always hated the person I've become
Three cheers to giving in, yeah I gave up
I was never good enough to anyone
