Here I decay with all that I am
Isolate me, everyone come take a stab
Red at both corners of my eyes
Convulsion in my veins, watch me fucking snap

Hate is what brought me here
Blood thirst devours all my peers
The venom seeps into my head
Pulsing through, vision runs red
I walk alone in this washed out place
Just another person that can't be saved

Hold me under, drown my fear
Squeeze until I disappear
Hold me under, drown my fear
Squeeze until I disappear

I saw the light vacate my eyes
Misery bloomed and swallowed me alive
Innocence dimmed as my spirit died
Still mentally destroyed, all thanks to you right?
Heartache I'm sorry I made the same mistake twice

Hate is what brought me here
Blood thirst devours all my peers
The venom seeps into my head
Pulsing through, seeing red again
I walk alone in this washed out place
Just another person that can't be saved

Blade to my neck
Let me feel the disconnect
Let me feel all the wasted time that I spent
Remind me of all my failed attempts
I'll black out once again

Hold me under, drown my fear
Squeeze until I disappear
I'll decay under my own hands
One bad day changed who I am
