Behold, the DECAY
Of everything
As we wither away

Nothing will ever be the same
When we are torn from each others arms
And cast away
Light years in between, no WHERE near to be seen
Eventually no one can stay, we all FADE away

NOTHING will stay the same
As we are built to fade away
Like falling leaves we shall be
One day, as we all fade away
