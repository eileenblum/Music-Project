Within me, a DYING sun revolves
Helplessly, through the dark
HOPELESSNESS, the slowing pace
The falling apart, knowing
Never touched your heart

I can never have
Your heart in my hands
I will never feel
Your heart next to mine

The chaos, inner nothingness
Suffocates me entirely
The war, within myself
Comes to a bitter END

I will never have
Your heart in my hands
I will NEVER feel
Your heart next to mine
