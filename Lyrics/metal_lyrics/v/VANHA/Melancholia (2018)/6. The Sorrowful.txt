Something DARK in search of prey
Lurks about as I'm astray
Waiting for the moment of weakness
That open window to my soul

When space is given, that cold creeps in
Makes a nest in the warmth within
Then slowly spreads that heavy chill
Without me knowing its intention, about to kill

Sorrow grips my heart
With its timeworn hands, tears apart
Eyes blacken, all goes COLD
Until there's nothing, forevermore

The sense of emptiness, the loss of all
Surrendering to grief, a spiritual fall
Frozen, FORLORN
Helpless since the sorrowful was born

FROZEN, forlorn, helpless
And the sorrowful is born
