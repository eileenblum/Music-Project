Dark clouds are moving in
From tortured depths, from within
Tell me, is it worth it all
Life, the time of suffering, the dying

With a darkened soul I stand
At the edge of a FUNERAL
Something you will never understand
You're blinded with lies

In this storm of grief
This tornado of sorrow
I persist with a bleeding heart
With the endless question WHY
Why must I suffer, til the end of my time

ISOLATION, further into the dark
The beginning of the spiral down
Tell me, why death is such a sin
Why can't I rest forever

In this storm of grief
This tornado of sorrow
I persist with a bleeding heart
With the endless question Why
Why must I SUFFER, til the end of my time

Freezing, from the twisting wind
Blistered, tortured and beaten
Wounds ripping in the blasts of DARKNESS
Yet still my heart beats
