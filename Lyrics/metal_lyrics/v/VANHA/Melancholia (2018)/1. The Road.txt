Everything points to one road
The only way to get out
The moon brings light to my path
As I take my heavy steps
Along the way, the crooked road
Memories HAUNT my senses
Shadows pass in my periphery
... And the discrete smell of lilacs...

My hands still remember
The scars, and the pain
And as my body moves forward
MY SOUL DRAGS along

Screams surrounding me
Tears, falling for the tormented
Unwillingly ignored for my cause
I'm sorry, I must carry on

As I make my way, through the fog
The horizon grows darker and darker
Still I have to carry on
To find the end of the road

It doesn't matter, what you want for me
It was my hell, this is my wish
Seeing an end to everything
Into the dark, watch as I DESCEND
(As I descend)

I must carry on
