There comes a time for us all
When light no longer exists
Embrace the darkness

Old and grey is my heart
After years of being torn apart
This time, I leave with nothing behind
No farewell

And as the night turned dim
Something weary grew within
This time, this heart

Sorrow set sails
Old heart fails

Sorrow set sails
Old heart fails
