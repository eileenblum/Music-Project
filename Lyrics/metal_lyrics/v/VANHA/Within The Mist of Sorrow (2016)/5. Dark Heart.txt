Do you know how hard it is to be here
Without you
Do you know how wrong it feels to be here
Without you

I'm sorry that it's true
But it isn't something new

I know what it is
I know what is wrong
It's inside of you
The love has gone dark

It clouds my head
It tears me up inside
I know how to breathe
It's when I die

Do you know how hard it is to be here alone
Do you know how wrong it is to bleed out alone

I'm sorry that it's true
And it's all because of you

I know what it is
I know what is wrong
It's inside of you
The love has gone dark

It clouds my head
It tears me up inside
I know how to breathe
It's when I die

Do you know how hard it is
Do you know how wrong it is

I know what it is
I know what is wrong
It's inside of you
The love has gone dark

It clouds my head
It tears me up inside
I know how to breathe
It's when I die
