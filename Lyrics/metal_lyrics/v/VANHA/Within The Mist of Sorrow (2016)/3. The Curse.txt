All I want, is for you to understand
The constant pain I go through
And how it feels, to bear this sorrow
And the darkness within

To live with this curse
The weight of it all
Brings me down
On my knees
(Please)

Can you see what I see, all is death
Do you know what it's like, fighting every breath
Unwilling to stay, yet forced to
If I had a choice, I would walk right out

Into the dark, into the cold night
Where tears are left behind
And I can rest forever

Into infinity, into forever
Where shadows embrace me
Where I'm no longer in pain

Into the dark, into the cold night
Where tears are left behind
And I can rest forever

Into infinity, into forever
Where shadows embrace me
Where I'm no longer in pain
