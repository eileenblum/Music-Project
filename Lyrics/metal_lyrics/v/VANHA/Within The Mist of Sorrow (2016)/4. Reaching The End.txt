Suffocation, strangulation, my heart, my all
The blackening is here

When cold within, and torn apart
As the last wind chills my heart

Awaiting death, and my last breath
All alone, in the cold
Soon, reaching the end

Slowly, I give in
I feel the darkness reaching in
Embrace me
Releasing me from these chains

As I shall wither away
So shall the memories of me
With time
They all become pale

And disappear
Forever gone
No one will ever know
Of my existence

Awaiting death, and my last breath
All alone, in the cold
Soon, reaching the end

Slowly, I give in
I feel the darkness reaching in
Embrace me
Releasing me from these chains
