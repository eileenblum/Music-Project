All for nothing
Suffering, before eternal darkness
All creations, in vain
In the end, not worth the pain

Pointless, endless, misery
Enslaved, 'til grave, bitterly

All I was
All I am
What I will become
In the end

As the shadows grow darker within
And the light fades away, all goes cold
All I was, it was all in vain
Now I drown in misery and pain

As the shadows grow darker within
And the light fades away, all goes cold
All I was, it was all in vain
Now I drown in misery and pain

All I want, is this to be the end
The end of all, the end of ends
I am done, done with it all
Into the cold light, into the cold light
