You know my tongue bleeds sometimes 
From biting down for a good reason 
I just can't go silent any longer 
When those great pretenders 
Fake what they know 
About my life 
Or any trials I've been through 
So quick to judge another 
And never looking at yourselves 
You just sit around 
Open mouthed 
While filler words 
Are falling out of your faces 
When the only thing 
You truly know about me is my name 
All of the words you've been chewing on for years 
Are just a bunch of jealous lies 
And if you chew too much 
You could end up choking 
You took what was mine 
Straight fucking stole it from my hands 
Twisted it and tried to ruin it 
(Choked all of the life from it) 
Put a bad fucking name on it 
But what I hold in my heart 
IS REAL 
So I'm sticking to my guns 
I NEVER SAID A FUCKING WORD
