I can't accept what's been done 
I'll question the motives 
Of all things under the sun 
There's something wrong 
When a man is kept down 
By another man's hand with a gun 
We need to start a fire 
To act consciously 
To save us from our own defeat 
Because there is still a war 
That we must eliminate 
And save ourselves 
From this conscious state 
When you just can't take anymore 
And you're being kept down 
START A FIRE 
We've gotta cut our ties 
To a life lived in denial 
I wish I could strike a match 
And set fire to this fucked up empire 
I'll never let myself become 
Just another apathetic motherfucker 
Who knows what we could do 
If we would only try 
If we turn our heads and walk away 
This fire won't survive 
START A FIRE
