I've spent my life questioning everything 
Sometimes what is placed right in front of us 
I find so hard to believe 
It can crush us so hard 
That it becomes difficult to breathe 
"Give it some time" 
Is just not enough 
I've gotta dig deeper than that 
To find so comfort 
We sit and pretend 
That we're content 
But I feel we've covered up 
Our rage that keeps us driven 
SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING MORE 
Living in a cold world 
But it doesn't have to be that way 
We're keeping ourselves down 
We don't bite the oppressive hand 
That's feeding us all lies 
Yes denial feels so good 
But we are marching ourselves 
To an untimely grave 
Simply by our actions 
WE HAVE BECOME 
OUR OWN WORST ENEMIES 
And I feel we've covered up our rage 
That keeps us driven 
SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING MORE 
The hand that feeds 
Is the hand that's keeping you down
