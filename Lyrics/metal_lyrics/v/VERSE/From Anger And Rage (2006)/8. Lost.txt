Everything is insane 
Young man walked into the end of everything 
Took a few out with him 
He was never molded 
Quite like the rest of those lucky ones 
It was understood early on 
That life was unforgiving 
"It wasn't out of hate now was it son?" 
"I'm not your fucking son" 
Keep on searching for the answers motherfucker 
Cus' I'm sure there will be another one just like him 
It could have been me 
It could have been you 
Young man longing for that affection 
Coming up short 
And only receiving leftovers of his father's addictions 
Tossed aside with nowhere to go 
He falls flat on his face 
In his quest for a place to call home 
Live a lifetime in just 17 years 
Tortured and neglected 
He searches for solid ground 
But still comes up short 
Without his mother's affection 
He walks an empty street of insanity 
It could have been me 
It could have been you
