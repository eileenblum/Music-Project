Clenched fist I'm in a rage 
I can't control my anger now 
The more they lie to us 
The more I want to bring them down 
Everywhere we turn 
We're being told how we should be 
I feel like I'm being forced into a mold 
That just doesn't fit me 
FROM ANGER AND RAGE 
Comes rebellion 
These money hungry men 
Control our sight 
And distort the truth that we so desperately seek 
Telling us that we're wrong 
For the way we live our lives 
I know there are far too many 
Who feel just like us 
From anger and rage 
COMES REBELLION 
Your billboard's temptation 
Just a hangman's noose 
A constant campaign 
To sell us your "truth" 
Can't live life on our knees 
Or believe lies we're fed 
Won't let them get to us 
The movement's not dead
