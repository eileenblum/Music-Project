The season's changing 
And I'm feeling left behind 
It's getting so much colder now 
But my heart's still stuck in that Summertime 
Simple conversations 
Running through my mind 
Reminding me of how much this time meant 
So I gotta let all of you know 
That every moment we shared 
And every helping hand 
Meant so much more 
Than any outsider could ever understand 
Eleven kids in a van 
Made me understand 
Sacrifice and commitment to a movement 
Based on reaching out your hand 
We buried memories on 39th and Glisan 
That said "WE WERE HERE"
