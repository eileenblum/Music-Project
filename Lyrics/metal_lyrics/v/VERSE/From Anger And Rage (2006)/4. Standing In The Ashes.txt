You left us all for dead 
Standing in the ashes 
Of a world you've destroyed 
All we want is a chance to grow 
A chance to be something more 
CRUSHED 
BLEEDING 
Left to die 
You can try to take us all 
But we still survive 
Fueled by our anger 
And our strong minds 
You can try to stop us 
But we won't back down 
We won't follow suit 
AND FALL IN LINE
