The reasons that I live 
The way that I live 
Are building up 
And they'll continue to grow 
I will never run 
From where I stand 
Even if it means 
I'm standing here alone 
I've seen the best of 'em fall away 
I've come to learn 
That even words written in stone 
Can be eroded with TIME
