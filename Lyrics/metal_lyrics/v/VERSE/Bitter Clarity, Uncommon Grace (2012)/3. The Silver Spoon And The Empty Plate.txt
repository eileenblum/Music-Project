We are the epitome of monetary wealth.
We are also the definition of the bottom of the barrel.
We speak both the language of the rich and the poor
because we are, in many ways, one in the same.
The great divide we face is compassion for the book we judged by its cover.

Printed words of inspiration became her unconditional lover.
Stories in black and white helped shape some form of relating to something...
someone... anything... everything... nothing.

"Police are pigs, justice is blind,
greedy men in suits only serve to divide."
