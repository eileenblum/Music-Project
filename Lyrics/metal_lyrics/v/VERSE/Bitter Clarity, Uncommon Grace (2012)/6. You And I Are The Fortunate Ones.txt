When you speak of her, speak of her well.
We've been teaching lessons to ourselves and other's stories of hell-
Relating to that situation can give you salvation in every aspect of loving.
The telling of what lies ahead is something we cannot know.

"Be prepared for the worst,
and hang on to the last strand of thread that holds best."
A true test of compassion and humility on the final tier of a sun that sets west;
and, for a moment, casts a shadow that hides my love for you;
all of your understanding in me and my patience for you.

Where were you when you arrived to destroy life?
Where will you be when you lose light?

"Be prepared for the worst,
and hang on to the last strand of thread that holds best."
A true test of compassion and humility on the final tier of a sun that sets west.

Fall to your knees, open your arms.
Embrace; relate.

"The easiest thing you can do in life is to hate."
I must admit that speaks volumes for me
but I still stay chained to every ounce of hostility.
The teacher that we've found in a mother that has abandoned.
The re-gifted dullness of a knife that can't cut,
only scratch and sadden.
It's a burden strong enough to make our minds right or wrong;
a loss of grey area when all of your loved ones are gone.
Living in fear of a cross that we bear,
most buried enough for more than a lifetime here.
