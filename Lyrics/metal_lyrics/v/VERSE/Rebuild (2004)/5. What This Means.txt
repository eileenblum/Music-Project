Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one 
Who doesn't give up on what this means 
I know I will stay this course of path 
No matter how hard I'm pushed away 
This means so much more to me 
than just a shallow promise 
This means the fucking world 
This is something I believe in I BELIEVE 
This is something that won't change 
THAT WON'T CHANGE 
No matter what gets in my way IN MY WAY 
I'm staying on this road I've paved 
I see kids marching a fashion parade 
Trying to impress us all with empty moves 
Folded arms in your tough guy stance 
Completely missing what all this means 
WE WANT MORE to me this is a movement 
WE WANT MORE not just a social scene 
WE WANT MORE 
WE WANT MORE 
TO me this is a movement not just a social scene
