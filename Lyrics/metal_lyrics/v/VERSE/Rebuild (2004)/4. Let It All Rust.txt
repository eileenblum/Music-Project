How could I have known it would come to this? 
Turning backs and giving up BECAUSE OF THE RISK 
Cheapening a way of life that I choose to live 
I gave this my heart and soul 
what the fuck did you give? 
Sell out your soul....let it all rust.... 
I've never seen a person fucking change this much 
NOW WHO GAVE UP? 
Sell out your soul....let it all rust.... 
I've never seen a person fucking change this much 
NOW WHO GAVE UP ON HEART AND SOUL
