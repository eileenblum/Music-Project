I REFUSE 
To believe in blind traditions 
or buy into this fake world 
I will not ignore the truth 
I won't follow the sheep and be fooled 
I refuse to forget all that I've learned 
I see the truth that most choose to fight 
Because that is not what I have in mind 
as a perfect life 
I REFUSE 
To believe in blind traditions 
or buy into this fake world 
I will not ignore the truth 
I won't follow the sheep and be fooled 
I refuse to forget all that I've learned 
I see the truth that most choose to fight 
Because that is not what I have in mind 
as a perfect life 
I REFUSE when this world tries to poison me 
I REFUSE 
...I REFUSE... 
when this world tries to poison me 
I REFUSE to forget all that I've learned 
In a world force feeding so many lies 
All the confusion of CHOOSING SIDES 
I have searched and found what is best for me 
And this world will never that that from me
