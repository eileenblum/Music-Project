So it still goes on 
We're all fighting for truth 
and searching for a way 
To lift ourselves FROM THIS HATE 
Sometimes we rise just to fall back down 
Our Confidence in compassion 
gets knocked to the ground 
While the ones who try so hard to live 
of a world Soaking wet with anguish 
open up their hearts and reach out so far 
But still fall short because we still have wars 
YOU AGAINST ME 
me against....you 
Just because of our differences 
WE ARE BEATEN AND BRUISED 
But in the end WE WILL ALL LOSE 
Just because of our differences 
WE ARE BEATEN AND BRUISED 
But in the end WE WILL ALL LOSE 
In the end WE ALL LOSE 
in the end WE ALL LOSE 
Unless we stop this now 
So it still goes on 
We're all fighting for truth 
and searching for a way 
We lift ourselves FROM THIS HATE 
Sometimes we rise just to fall back down 
Just to fall...just to fall...just to fall...
