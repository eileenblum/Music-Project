Leaving all that we've been taught wrong behind 
Smashing ignorance and uncovering 
all that lies within ourselves 
WE MUST! WE MUST! WE MUST CHANGE OUR WAYS! 
I give a fuck about the world 
so why the fuck don't you? 
WE MUST! WE MUST! WE MUST CHANGE OUR WAYS! 
I give a fuck about the world 
so why the fuck don't you? 
Leaving all that we been taught wrong behind 
Smashing ignorance and uncovering 
all that lies within ourselves 
Let the sun bring a new day and open up our eyes 
Begin to put back what we have taken away 
WE MUST! WE MUST! WE MUST CHANGE OUR WAYS! 
I give a fuck about the world 
so why the fuck don't you? 
WE MUST! WE MUST! WE MUST CHANGE OUR WAYS! 
I give a fuck about the world 
so why the fuck don't you? 
OUR NUMBERS MIGHT BE DOWN 
but they still fucking count 
Why do we spend OUR LIVES GIVING UP? 
WE MUST CHANGE...WE MUST CHANGE 
We must change... 
why do we spend our lives GIVING UP?
