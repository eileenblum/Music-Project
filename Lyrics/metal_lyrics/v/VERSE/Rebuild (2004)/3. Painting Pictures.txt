The sun is setting on my back ON MY BACK 
As I run from the problems 
I just can't face today 
Just can't face today 
Overwhelmed I'm so distraught 
I'm left reaching for the faith FOR THE FAITH 
I felt so strong 
just yesterday 
just yesterday 
I'm painting a picture of a world 
Where no one has to struggle 
and everyone gets along 
Judged by our hearts 
judged by our minds 
AND WHAT WE ARE 
But the rain always come to wash the paint away 
Reminding us that sometimes in life WE ALL BLEED
