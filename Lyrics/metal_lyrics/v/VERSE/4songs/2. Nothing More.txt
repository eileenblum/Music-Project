Your words are shit 
and I can see right through you 
Writing songs to please 
so kids fall to their knees 
and worship what you do 
Your words are shit 
and I can see right through you 
Writing songs to please 
so kids fall to their knees 
and worship WHAT YOU DO 
Songs about nothing 
just meaningless words 
When your time to shine has passed 
What the fuck were your words worth? 
NOTHING 
NOTHING.... 
Just WORDS WORDS WORDS and nothing more 
WORDS WORDS WORDS and nothing more 
And nothing more... 
and nothing... 
nothing more 
Foolish words spoken 
that people hold up in the light 
Savory to the ears of ones who follow your life 
WORDS WORDS WORDS and nothing more 
WORDS WORDS WORDS and nothing 
...nothing 
...nothing more 
NOTHING MORE 
WORDS WORDS WORDS and nothing more 
WORDS WORDS WORDS and nothing more 
WORDS WORDS WORDS and nothing more
