We are destroying everything 
We are leaving nothing unscarred 
We kill. 
We take. 
We rape. 
We bleed. 
We are destroying everything 
We are asshole brigades 
Marching a selfish parade 
Taking advantage of ourselves 
We don't even realize our time is running out 
Why do we take blood when there is none left to bleed? 
Have we forgot what taking to much means? 
No consideration 
A lost generation 
We sell out our hearts to greed 
Now our time is running out 
It's running out
