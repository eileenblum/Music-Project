So much more than just a shell 
But you cant fucking see 
You love whats fucking cool 
More than the air that you breathe 
You could change the hair 
You could change the clothes 
But this is more than fucking style 
Its the ideals that we hold 
I don't need a gimmick to set my self apart 
I know true revolution only starts when its within your heart 
I've watched so many go, I've watched so many change 
Falling victim of a trend and going back on everything 
Everything that you were 
Now you just pretend, that you had never been 
A part of this at all 
So many change 
I'll still remain!
