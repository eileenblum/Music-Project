Thirsting for the absolute left you drunk on a quest for the truth.
A newfound sense of salvation, empty in the eyes, mind on vacation.
They got their ravenous claws in your skin, they know the power of 
infecting the youth.

Such a fine young boy. Join them where the water is black and you 
can make your own rules.

No wrath of god, just the wrath of man. A legacy of genocide and 
stolen lands in the name of "good books" that have been twisted 
for imperialistic plans. Ignore the dark history of slavery and 
misery. Turn out the lights and hide the current state.

You've been "saved" but you still wait: Arms open, heart open, God
fearing. Still Nothing.
