A concrete bed, a weathered awning made of cardboard that keeps the 
morning sun from his eyes. He never knew much about why his life became
so hard. Sleep one night under this bridge in this man's shoes, and you'll
learn there is no god. Lets go back to the early days. When life read just
like a blissful page, in a book with a happy ending, even if that means
were just pretending. Before everything this kid knew as unbroken. Became
nothing but a state of insecurity. In the early days he lived life with his
eyes un-open, conditioned to always go quietly. One day his father went
off to war. To fight a war for something that's not worth fighting for.
A forceful pry at his eyes to see a beautiful world has been taken from you and me.
"This is killing me," he said to his mother. "Is this the true face of humanity?"
he said to his mother. "The weight of this has got me on my knees," he said
with no response from his mother. The boy was scared now. He got the silent
treatment from a person he confided in. No longer sure where to turn, he jumps
right into a new life of uncontrolled rage and depression. He embraces 
addiction to numb his new affliction. 

"I miss my father," He thought to himself.
