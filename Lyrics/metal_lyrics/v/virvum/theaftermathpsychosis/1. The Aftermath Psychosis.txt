My will be done 
To detain gods tongue 
To reveal the true cryptic path of the deviate 
Both our birth and death attest equivalency

A servant born in the midst of the filth of corrupt society
Tributary bound to the wolves who had his tribe massacred

Reproduction / Monotonous 

To detain gods tongue 
To reveal the true cryptic path of the deviate 
As circling vultures pounce on the corpse of the prey for the septic Nourishment 

Purging the Enemy 
I am the Enemy

Dissociation from the ordinary
I relocate myself into bizarre oblivion
White noise is deafening me and i cannot (stop) 
The voice inside my head it is distracting my sight

And as we bleed out, we reveal the lights 

To detain gods tongue 
To reveal the true cryptic path of the deviate
Both our birth and death attest equivalency 

Devolution / Forever free
