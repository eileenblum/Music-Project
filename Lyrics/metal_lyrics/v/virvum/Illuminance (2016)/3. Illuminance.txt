The seminal spreading of light reveals
A rebirth of elder once left behind knowledge
Elucidating of all prosperous
Coercing the revivalism of
Inanimate oceans divergently surging
Vast inverted cascades rush heavenwards
Elucidation of the universe

And its integral seed
As two ends to align forever
The shed light wanders
Across the canvas of oblivion
The two ends come to align forevermore

Inverted cascades bore into the heavens
As if glimmering stardust hit the awoken cerebrum
Transparent and born into eternal gleam
Forthcoming embodiment of terrestrial germination

Erode earth until darkness unfurls across the surface of dystopia
The worlds eyes put to sleep forevermore

Helpless final glimpse at the disappearing sun
