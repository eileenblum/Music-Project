A crack in the well of pervasive conversion
Incepts the disintegration of thoughts
Asleep in utter heavenly silence
Trepidations of death
A liquefaction of human horizons
Convergence beyond clarity
A noctilucent portal
A colour unknown

Awaken us from slumber
Concuss our thoughts with a downpour of warmth
With the arms stretched out wide open
Expect this fate to be our last
As shrill light beams off mouth and eyes

Awaken us from slumber
Concuss our thoughts with a downpour
For we are all stranded and begotten
In this architecture twisted apart
For in a place where the reasoner fails to reason
Is where step by step we wander
Into darkness

Ad Rigorem

Falling into the void
Intermitting the mortal divergence
Convergence beyond apogee

We wonât forget
The sight of her creation
Reborn in the chasm
Expulsed from lucidness

A crack in the well of pervasive conversion
Incepts the disintegration of thoughts
Asleep in utter heavenly silence

Reborn and thrown

Into the sand
Into the sand
Reborn and thrown
Into the sand
Into the sand
Into the sand
And on we march
Into the sand
Into darkness

Into the sand
Into dust
We march
Into darkness

The elders have spoken though nothings been learnt
The tables have turned
Now we march into dust

Awaken us from slumber
Concuss our thoughts with a downpour
For we are all stranded and begotten
In this architecture twisted apart
For in a place where the reasoner fails to reason
Is where step by step we wander
Into darkness

Ad Rigorem
