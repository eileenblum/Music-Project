Inaptly striving to grasp the effects
Of casual conception beyond all sensorium
Mythic energies of a power so unavowed
Concealing the shape of subsumable soil

Focus being torn into spectral dimensions
Iniquitous offering feeding the mind
Unparalleled biotic conceptional design
An inner spiritual earthwork in timelessness

Incarnation of the sacrilegious seed
Onset of infinite exhaustlessness

Torn from within the carcass construct
Where the convolutions are mirroring their thousandfold
Unfolds this ancient reformative realm
A phenomenon inscrutable to humanly known doctrines
A face-off between imperceptible worlds
Discloses the apparent resemblance of boon and bane

Where flora and fauna fuse to the shapelessly whirring radiants
The ancient cycle sets forth

Incarnation of the sacrilegious seed
