The collusive foreseeable passing
Of terrestrial inhabitation at the peak of our creation
The spherical left drifting into dismal cold
No solstice, just darkness
No solace, just darkness and cold

Slowly it'll all fade away and not one will recall the blood of the innocent
Fate â it never was alterable
One single curse form onset to our instant grave

A forging of last rational ways to outlive
Exuding premature cryonic mechanism germs â the final bleak failure
A convulsive helpless last fierce resistance
Outnumbered we crawl back and collapse back upon ourselves

A reversal of fortune in our time of need
The finding of truth in spiritual escape
With omniscient cognizance
The cognition that existence was not meant to be

Horus, give us the certainty and cognition our earthly life never did
Bring lucid perception upon our obscurity
Indifferently witnessing the sweeping terrene ruination

Coldly we'll all rot away and not one will recall the souls of the wicked ones
Fate â it'll never be alterable
All things'll be dead and not one single heart left to mourn

[Undecipherable female voice]

Undam ourselves
Our frail bodies levitate
To leave our dermal shells
Leave off to a higher place
Begone

Trespass the incorporeal realms in their darkness
Overthrow our own gods
Trespass to cease the aching
Transcend into afterlife

Slowly it'll all fade away and not one will recall the blood of the innocent
Fate â it'll never be alterable
No solstice, just darkness
No solace, just darkness and cold

Reversal of fortune
In our time of need
The finding of truth in spiritual escape
With omniscient cognizance
The cognition that existence was not meant to be
Before the extinguishment
Bear hormic certainty
Sear her smile into your heart
Cherish her final kiss
Eternal embrace
A final warming shine
