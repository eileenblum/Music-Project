The scourge appears as formless occurrence
An occult duskfall laid upon the mind
Its concept is the art of all god's purpose and coercions
An incarceration engulfing the men we were
Corroborating pale progress
Consuming the thoughts from the captive earth
The words start interweaving
We're deafened unconscious
With no words left to whisper in the win
The pace of progress tied a blindfold to our palsied faces
Yet again, it's concept is the art of all god's purpose and coercions
Engulfing the men we were

Dark earth beyond
Oh, Elohim descend!
As you see us rot in the glow of his primal deceptive light

Dark earth beyond
Oh, Elohim descend!
As you see us hurt ourselves in the treacherous shine of his foul miscreation

Elohim descend!

Dark earth beyond
Take this falsehood from us
And deliver us from the tentacles of the sun

Corroborating pale progress
Consuming the thoughts from the captive earth
The words start interweaving
We're deafened unconscious
The pale eyes flickering sickness-fed

The pace of progress tied a blindfold to our palsied faces
Yet again, it's concept is the art of all god's purpose and coercions
Engulfing the men we were

Engulfing the men we were
