This rife
And decadent decay
Despise the fools
That triumph from our pain

A thousand martyrs
Will never know the grief that I feel

Amidst the crowd
Baying for my blood
One day the tide will turn
The doomed rise
The flock will burn

A thousand martyrs
Will never know the grief
That I feel
