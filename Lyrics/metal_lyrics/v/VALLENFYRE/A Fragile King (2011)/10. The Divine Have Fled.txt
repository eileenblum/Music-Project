Abominations lure us to their side
Infuse the venom of my spite

Flogging the brute sun
Drown in a mirage of agony
Gorge the tyrant
Accept defeat

The divine have fled

Oh foul magnificence
Sublime disgrace
His monstrous last desire I have to face

At my side the demon writhes forever
Only when we drink poison are we well
As I breathe he burns my lungs like fever
You suffered these defilements silently
As you fell
