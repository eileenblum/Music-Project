Dreams of a former lifetime
Scattered by the flame
No eye from heaven
And nothing but a name

Resign my heart
Poor beast sleep sound
For the seeds have spread
The blackest of days
Farewell my king
You must rest your head

I face an eternal winter
Without you I will cease
You were my idol
I am your priest

Resign my heart
Poor beast sleep sound
For the seeds have spread
The blackest of days
Farewell my king
You must rest your head
