Ignorance breeds
Prey on the week
Crushes the will
Tortured beneath

Sacrificed to a world too blind to care

Born to decay
Devoid of grace
Blind to the truth
Total disdain

Sacrificed to a world too blind to care

Blacken the earth
Venomous greed
Rivers of blood
Twisted belief
Oblivion nears
Endless abyss
Humanity wept for the ones left behind

Sacrificed in a world beyond repair

Humanity wept for the ones left behind
As the world buns to death
The flames caress the sky
