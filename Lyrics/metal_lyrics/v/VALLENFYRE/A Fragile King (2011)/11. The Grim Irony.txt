Cast out by the vile horde
Raped and brutalised
A stain on humanity
Stripped of all my pride
For all those who died
From this grim irony

A chorus of discordant cries
Degraded by the misery

These fools yearn for extinction
The rapturous halls of death
The exiled will rise together
To punish the wickedness of man

Condemned to a living hell
Flogged and crucified
A mindless society
Extinction of mankind
For the ones who cried
Accept this the grim irony

An angel with murderous eyes
Eviscerate my legacy

Destroy this reign of obscenity
Bring the righteous to their knees
The desolate shall have their vengeance
Seas of blood will cleanse their greed

The corpse of a frozen Sun
Wept in solitude forever
The war has only just begun
Global genocide
Forget heaven

Monumental tragedy
The grim irony
Sent to punish me
The grim irony
