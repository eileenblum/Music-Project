As the world collapses
Flames rage in desolate eyes
Go join the masses
The broken bones
From a past disease can't lie

Kill the innocents
The whispers of immolation
Burn the witches
Hear my plea
To stop the abomination

The Sun bore down
On this fathomless despair
A fallen crown
The stench of evil fills the air

To the abhorred

The stinging hail
Of the treacherous reign
With scars so deep
Living a life flogged
And bound in chains
