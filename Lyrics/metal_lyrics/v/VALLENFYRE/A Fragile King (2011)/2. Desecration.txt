Tormented cries
Like nails
Driven into flesh
Cast out the beast
Quench the fire
Within his breast

A fragile king
Pouring bliss into my pain

The mighty leave us
In an ocean of despair
The void between us
Becomes a cross I cannot bear

Crushed by grief
I seek the void,
The black,
The bare
A desecration
A burden I can't share
