I see endless destruction
It's killed more than any world war
And I don't think I can take this any more
I spit on your doctrine
The tyranny on which you depend
What will you do when it all comes to an end

Such pious displays
Breathe life into the corpse of God
A mindless parade
Victims of the grand deception

The horror of reality
Cathedrals of dread

A morbid delusion
Threatened by the pits of hell
Abandon confusion
And surrender to your own free will

Your Christ has betrayed us here
And even death himself has lied
And even though eternity betide
Alas we have again to fear
