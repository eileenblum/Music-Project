The river dies
Into rapture

All will suffer this foul shame
This ultimate infection
A carrion snuffs the inner flame
Ravages with passion
Oh the hellish procession of pain
Hearts filled with gloom
Until the shell of man remains

Grim remorse and bitter cries
Consume my blackened core
Stare into the clouded eyes
And save this poor wretch before
The hellish procession of pain
Hearts filled with gloom
Until the shell of man remains

Rather than conceive this human mockery
With fists clenched in horror
Curse the blind avenging treachery
Eternally haunted
