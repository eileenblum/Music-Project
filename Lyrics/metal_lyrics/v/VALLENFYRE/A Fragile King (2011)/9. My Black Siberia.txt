Annihilation of wretched lives
Avarice grips a world too weak to care
The culmination of mankind's vice
A holocaust while people stand and stare

My black Siberia
The spawn of a ravaged domain

Thirsting for tyrants blood
Conquered liberty betrayed
Dead bodies stem the flood
A wasteland again

The dismal cries of wolves resound
The nameless crowd are trampled to their doom
Systematic genocide
Kill the pigs and all that they consume

My black Siberia
A thousand years left to decay

Save the dispossessed
Destroying the grotesque
