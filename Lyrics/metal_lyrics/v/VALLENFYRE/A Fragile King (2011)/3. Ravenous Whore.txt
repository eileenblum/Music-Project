Thorn in my side
Bane of my life
Constant descent into misery
Taken my pride
Tortured my mind
Take what's left of my dignity

I'd rather suffer
The leaping flames of hell
Imprisoned for all time
And endless hell

Trapped by a lie
Death by my side
Grotesque and vile impurity
Mercy denied
Bitter divide
As I suffer
This human indignity

The air is black,
I tear at my lungs and vain
No tears can ever wash away this pain

A ravenous whore
