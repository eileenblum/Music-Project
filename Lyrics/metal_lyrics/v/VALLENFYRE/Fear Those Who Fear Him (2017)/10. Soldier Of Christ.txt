Rewarding horror
With sanctuary
Covet the bodies
To choke on the seed
Innocence dies
Twisted wrath
The white serpents rise
Breathless body
Dragging its head
Devoid of purpose
A deteriorating vessel
The nameless drown
Arrogance feeds
Lambs to the slaughter
No rest for the meek
Soldier of Christ
Sins absolved
Your god given right
The screams of the suicidal
Ride on a vicious wind
Cowering like wounded deer
Grace turns to horror
Abused by the protectors
Baptised in the filth of mankind
Behind the glorious curtain
Maggots feast
On the blood divine
