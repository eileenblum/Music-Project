Suffer the chains
Pour out in vain
Ignorance reigns
Violate without remorse
This is the day
These are the masses
The whole human race
Kill all your masters
The slaves of today
The tyrants of tomorrow
Humanities shame
Authors of our own demise
Process the waste
Slaughtered in their sleep
The priests and the kings
Kill all your masters
