Lust and shame
Justified
Bow your head
Dead inside
Like kings and queens
With blinded eyes
Temple of rats
Dig through the filth
On your knees
Down the darkened maze
To ruins goal
Those once trusted
Now have been betrayed
The truth is nothing
But an ashen cinder
The vanities of mankind
Have been weighed
Slave to the system
Head of the victim
Wrath and tears
Selfish cries
Silent dread
Fractured lives
Your pointless Gods
Empty inside
Temple of rats
Dig through the filth
On your knees
I see humans
But no humanity
