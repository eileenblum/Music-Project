Amongst the filth
A human mire
Demons celebrate
This circle of vice
Sleep in oblivion
The descent of remorse
We the repulsive
Of sinful breast
Savage yet feeble
A worthless procession
Devils feign horror
A clandestine return
Beyond the chains
Reflected fear
Impostors and slaves
The hostile blood
It pours

The damned rise and obey
Surging vile aggression
The ruthless swallow decay
Rejecting violent
Oppression [2x]
