Tormented still and stripped to the bone
Your blood the wine that I drink all alone

I play a dismal game
To suffer them again
The words pour out in vain
An apathetic grave
I play a dismal game
To suffer them again
The words pour out in vain
An apathetic grave

Colours fade, life in monochrome
The end I seek, all seeds are sown

I play a dismal game
To suffer them again
The words pour out in vain
An apathetic grave
I play a dismal game
To suffer them again
The words pour out in vain
An apathetic grave

Years have passed and still I drift
My body decays, no anchor to cast

I play a dismal game
To suffer them again
The words pour out in vain
An apathetic grave
I play a dismal game
To suffer them again
The words pour out in vain
An apathetic grave
