Amongst The Vermin Pantomime Of Vice
Asphyxiated The Progress Of Our Minds
Give Rise To The Abhorrent Church Of Christ

The Wolves Of Sin

These Paragons Of Ignorance And Hate
Parasite Defenders Of Their Faith
Leave Centuries Of Servitude And Rape

With Innocent Blood
These Hallowed Alters Are Stained
Fiends Bore Holes
This Anguished Wretch
The Wolf Already Flays
