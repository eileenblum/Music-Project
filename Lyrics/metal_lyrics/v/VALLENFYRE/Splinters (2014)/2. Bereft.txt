Throughout His Plight
The Cries In Vain
Ring Out In Twisted Symphonies
In All The Days
I've Earned The Right
To Walk A Path Of Blasphemy

In An Empty Gloom
The Platitudes Of Grief
Four Stages Through
And No Acceptance

Oh Christ Our Savior
Taken From This Place
Show Us Your Mercy 
Or Fall From Grace
Oh Lord Our Father
Thy Will Be Done
Save Us This Suffering
Or Cut Out  Our Tongues
