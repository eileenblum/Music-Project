A Lowly Mortal Sits
Before The Great Unknown
Enter A Vast Abyss
Exile The World Below

Dragged To Gehenna

Looking To Distant Skies
My Fate Confines Me
Throw Off The Flesh Disguise
Expand Into Infinity

Gaze At Tarnished Mirrors
Saliva Mixed With Cinders Black

A Temple Of Glorious Rot
The Sun In It's On Blood Coagulates
And Through All This Sickness And Death
My Soul Upon The Tears You Shed Is Slaked
