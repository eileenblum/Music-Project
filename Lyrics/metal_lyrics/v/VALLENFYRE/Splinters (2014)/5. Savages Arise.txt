Like Pitiful Dogs, They Are Drunk On Neglect
And Procreate Vacuous, Violent Threats

Rise From The Ashes Of Unspeakable Filth
A Suffocating Urge To Kill
The Entire Human Race

A Billion Maggots Incessantly Breed
Relentless And Mindless, A Cancerous Greed

Torn From Cadavers
Of Avaricious Souls
An Unfathomable Servitude
A Total Fall From Grace

The Throne Ablaze
Admonished Mortal Eyes
An Endless Maze
Where Savages Arise
