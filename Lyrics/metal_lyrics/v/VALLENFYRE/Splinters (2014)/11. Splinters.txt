Tears Flow
Vast Sorrow

Weep To Behold Him
Bask In His Sublime Light
Strong Hands Fade 
My Life Torn Asunder

It's All Reaction To Grief
It's Even A Struggle To Breathe
A Life Left In Splinters Beneath
My Soul Is A Tomb Bereaved

Slowly Murdered Day By Day
The Solemn Light In A Dying Gaze
Say Your Prayers To The God Reviled
And Tear The Father From His Child
