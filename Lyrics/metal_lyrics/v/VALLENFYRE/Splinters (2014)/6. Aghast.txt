Hoar Frost
An Endless Winter
The Sun Sets Ablaze
Seasons Of Mist
Dashed On The Shores Of Doom

Like Some Misborn, Monstrous Child
Slake My Dreams And Quench My Cries
A God Who Feeds On Carnage And Death
Our Blood Escapes From Every Single Pore

The Rancid Milk Of A Withered Breast
Inhale The Deadly Flower
Wrench The Crimson From His Chest
The Blackened River Descends Into Our Core

I Am Aghast

Forced To Walk On Seas of Corpses
Like Maggots, The Remorse Devours My Flesh
Toward A Darkened Abyss Of Human Pollution
Hellwards Each Day Down One More Step
