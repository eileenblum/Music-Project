I Had A Paranoid, I'm Lookin' For A Place I'm Gonna Be Alone
But Since That Misty Night I'm Doubtin' Everything Which Brings My Brain Spite
Fallin' Down On The Ground I Hurt Myself. Bats Appearing Out Of The Night
Subtle Teeth Are Around My Neck, Feelin' Cold Waves Over Me

She's A Vampyr Of A Rock'N'Roll Band. She's As A Bat, Bad As A Bat
Come On, Bite Mr, Suck My Blood! Come On Vampyr, Lead Me The Way

Blood Streams Into Her Mouth, Suckin' Ev'ry Drop She's Laughing Out Loud 
But She's Not Really Dead, She Actions Just The Way A Women Use To Do
Tellin' Tales About Her Gloomy Life, I'd Be The King Of The Night
Flying Through The Empty Streets Of Townm Together We're Really Free

She's A Vampyr Of A Rock'N'Roll Band. She's As A Bat, Bad As A Bat
Come On, Bite Mr, Suck My Blood! Come On Vampyr, Bite Me Tonight
