Can you see my anger, can you see my fuckin pain
I would like to kill every day, every fuckin man
Never coming back, this is what I swear
Everybody has to die, nobody will be there

Feed the extermination, let us go to the front
All the blood of foreign people, there s nothing wrong
Never seen before, but it's happening again
Open your eyes you will remember my name

You have to die â Listen to me

Every people around the world; has done the same
When it came into power, it killed and destroyed
You can look at every continent and all countries
Every nation has ruled an era, and others, they had to die
