Carzinova burning, everywhere deep in your blood
In your body in your mind, everywhere you can not stop

A tumour in your head, proliferation in your veins
Endgame in your system, what remains

What time is left to do the things you want to do
To correct mistakes man, it's up to you

Don't forget to fight, look in the mirror every day
Close your eyes, he'll listen to, what you say

Metastasis killing you
Shout at your cancer â "you're dying too"

No more time to live and the ending s getting near
Fight against that enemy, that you don't have to fear

If you re getting weak, it makes no difference to you
100 000 people had Ito walk1the same way too

You have to be brave, an example around you
Wake them up, they have to fuckin' walk on through

Don't forget to fight, look in the mirror every day
Close your eyes, he'll listen to, what you say

Metastasis killing you
Shout at your cancer â " you re dying too"
