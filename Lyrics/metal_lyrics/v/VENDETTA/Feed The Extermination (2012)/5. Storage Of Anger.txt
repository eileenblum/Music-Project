Yeah brutality, is inside me,
No way out, I can t explain
My whole life, I m looking weakly
I was treated every time

I'm afraid, it's beginning,
I want to fight against everyone
The whole past, I remember, here
I am â now it will be done

Cowardly, you are alone now,
Majority it is the past
You called me fool, fuckin silly ass
No one helps you, like me before

Smashing teeth, your flying head,
Broken bones, now you regret
I am evil, it's too late,
My reparation, is your fate

Can you see my storage of anger,
can you feel my strength in the ir
Can you see my storage of anger,
can you feel my fist everywhere

Your twisted face is looking up to me,
No compassion, no way
So much grief, I had inside me
Sheer envy on the floor

To encourage, everyone
Down there where you are right now
No one s laughing anymore,
they will meet you down on the floor
