My whole life someone wants to tell me
What I fuckin have to do
Their meaning for me it's not existing
I don't want to change it Till I'm dead

Ignore those fools
Be proud of yourself
Live your life
Till you're dead

The younger years jeans and black leather
Long hairs listening to Rock'n'roll
Everybody turning back
But I will never change it till I'm dead

Honesty in friendship and loyalty
I have my own rules every part of life
Falseness and lies, I need trust
I will never change it till I'm dead

Till I'm dead
