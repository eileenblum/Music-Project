They steal them from their safe
Often someone from the acquaintance
They use up their trust
The kids have no chance

The worst crime, everybody knows the worst crime
Do you know what is really sick, people who need that kick

They are tormenting little bodies, infanticide
What is the highest level
The judges are afraid
They are talking about the offender, and the victims â nothing at all
The worst crime, everybody knows the worst crime

You have to listen â what they have to say
To handle with care is more than fair
You have to publish guilty names right now
You can shout it out loud

Is your son in safety, is your daughter all right
Abuse is around you, keep your kids in sight
