You are living in dishonesty
No staying power in your mind
You are jealous of everything
Of success and luck in any kind

You are an unforgiving fool
A man I do not respect
A traitor with no second chance
A nobody I don t even react

In your eyes I can see it
In your lies I can hear it
From my heart I tell you
Fuck you...

Can you remember how it has begun
You were a special friend of mine
A winner is the envy of
All you fuckin guys
Friendship you don t really know
Embarrassing moment â I can not talk any longer
But my mind will be stronger
