Body, they want, to sell the core
From human beings they've never seen before
All around you hear the screams, enjoy that sound

In the slums they take the Scum
No missing people, metal ripped
Blood everywhere, watch out we need all â take care

Dedicate it all, who needs a liver
Replacement, parts, slaughtering
Disgusting, where is the pancreas

People, no time, but money, possibility
Corruption, it's a fact, indifference
Now close your eyes, bribery

Grab some intestines, organic money
Skin, bones and eyes â be in a hurry
De-Organ-izer is waiting for

Man who's paying for it, can you tell me that â De-organ-izer
Making money with it, I hope you re the fuckm next, De-organ-izer
