Suckers be careful, idiots watch out
Expose your mistress, everything is allowed
They destroy your freedom, they destroy your life
Look for the truth your independence dies

10% are not from you, you have to check it out
Can you remember if you've ever had a doubt
Ovulation bitch is full of lies and intrigue
Think about my words, they re definitely for you

Believe my words, they're true

Suckers be careful, idiots watch out
Expose your mistress, everything is allowed
Destroying your good nature, they kick your trust
Find out the truth, man, it is a must

You've just to be proud of your fuckin paternity
I've got to take some hair and skin, that is the key
Ovulation bitch is full of lies and intrigue
Think about my words, stupid man, they are for you

Believe my words, they're true
