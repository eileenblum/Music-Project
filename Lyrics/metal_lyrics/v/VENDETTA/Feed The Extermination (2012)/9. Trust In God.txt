Every Sunday they walk like robots
To our father the holy ghost
To be seen is the reason for
On their way with a halo

I hate Hypocrisy
Is religion in or out
A sermon from a preacher
A prayer from an old

And the pope and all the cardinals
They are blessing for salvation
For the world's biggest company you're
spending money for a collection campaign

Unlawful things and hunger
War and different Pain
Have some things changed around you
Are you sure on your way

Do you think he's still up there
Was he ever down on earth
Have you ever read the bible
Promises have been made

Do you believe
Do you trust in God
Do you believe
