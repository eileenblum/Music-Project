Look at me, what I can do
Is impossible brutality
A bully since, I was a teen,
I was cruelty in my face,
I have the scars, of a fight race

I feel no pain, no fuckin where, they have no fuckin chance
Once a time, I've heard a bone, broken
From that point, every struggle, devastation

Look at me, what I can do
Is impossible brutality
Someone s defenseless, motionless, helpless
I'm going on like an animal, insanity

I don't care, look at me
I am tremendous brutality
