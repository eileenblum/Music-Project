Warfare with a buck and a gun and a strong will
The centre and the order of a lifetime is fighting
No motion the system is static unfair soul destroying
Wonât kill just a man with a heart but the grinders
Our time is now

Standing one by one in the front and as we are fighting
Have a row keep the trust in yourself, and the gun is by your side
The elite keeps ruling
Thatâs the point of my anger
There is only one damn word
Just one arm against the blind

Call me extreme, call me a brutal mind
Iâm not stupid Iâm telling no lies
Call me insane, but I know my headâs intact
My rage is burning till I will die

Fight the war for your bro
Keep the gun by your side
The machineryâs got to die
