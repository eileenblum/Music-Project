Hardcore what is wrong and what about that fucking thing
Billions you spend all your money and you are dreaming
I have seen every film sheâs doing everything
I feel like a thief stealing from TV screens
A fluffer is all right, satisfy me all night
A hardcore queen would be great, just one take

Hardcore nobodyâs watching and nobody buys
Millions looking to your neighbours look into your eyes
Itâs the dream of the masses every social classes
No one knows anyone nobody asked for that fun
Whores what a disease you are necessary, please
Lying society is disgusting me
