Now itâs done â they sucked me out
And I have nothing, nothing is left
Mt friend, yeah, my best friend
First time I need help
I needed somebody
And my fucking whore
Anyway, itâs better she is gone
Bitch â that fucking bitch
But I know what you want
Iâve got an operation on my knee
Not on my head
I give you what you want
Fucking asswipe
I know what you deserve

All the lies I have to hear
Sicken my mind, they creep into my ears
Politician you suck me out
You let us bleed, weâre the dying crowd
Fucking lady you broke my heart
Betrayed my soul, tearinâ it apart
Sold my life for a smile not more
Now I kick you back like you did before

You want hate? Call my number
I got hate, I got hate for you
You want hate? Call my number
So much hate, for this goddamned whore

Had a friend who turned to foe
I needed help, but he said âNoâ
Now I have lost my faith in you
I turned around, thereâs nothing more to do
Donate your heart and lose it all
Seems we climb the mountain just to fall
There was a time so full of trust
But all this gold was turning into dust

I remember your face, smilinâ at mine
But behind your holy mask thereâs an evil mind
In your heart in your guts thereâs no more honesty
Your egoism your cruel lies stole my energy
