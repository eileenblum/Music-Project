Do not trust in anybody not in anyone
Keep your fucking mind free and the pluckiness strong
Life is in your own hand the place for the gun
If you are in trouble, shit, Bro better have one

Punch the face of your enemy
Check this man, this is reality
Youâre a ball, thatâs kicked around in here
And prepare yourself for hostility

Pack your traveling easy to be said
But the laws of the street gonna cut your freedom
Money is a brute thing, people even bad
Kill if itâs not done, what they said
