There was more work than we could handle with our man
Help was needed from the Turks and other foreign hands
Dirty jobs - trash disposal - beneath our dignity
And prosperity returned to good old Germany
Go and live...Stay and die
"Turks go home" you see the writing on the walls today
Unemployment has increased, now deport those who stay
There's to many problems, too many wait for work
Thoughts about the frantic 30's, fear of danger lurks
Go and live...stay and die
It's too mad, it's like a nightmare, must not become true
But some radicals may bacome quiet dangerous to you
Agitation, rage and anger, escalation's near
Hate and violence tomorrow make you live in fear
Go and live or stay and die
