You are chosen, searchin' for you, you will feel the pain
We're sadistic brains of malice, we're the men insane
Mad invasion, bestiality, you are doomed to die
We'll kill your wife, haunt your children, this is for your lie

[Pre-chorus:]
Metal warriors with crashing iron
Screams of vengeance - like a nightmare

Feel the power of our legion, we will break your soul
We'll fight 'til death's arrival, kidnap, oppress and roll
Nuclear attack and fire, now your end is near
We are dark horrific Lunatics, make you cry in fear

[Pre-chorus:]
Metal warriors with crashing iron
Screams of vengeance - like a nightmare

[Chorus:]
Crushed down to the pits of darkness you will be destroyed
by us, ready to die this night, cry: "Traitor's Fate!"

Immortals spread the pestilence, don't know fear and grace
Merciless voracious warriors crush the human race
You betrayed us fuckin' liar, bloody bastard die
Life and soul of you are lost now, that's what we'll destory

[Pre-chorus:]
Metal warriors with crashing iron
Screams of vengeance - like a nightmare

[Chorus:]
Crushed down to the pits of darkness you will be destroyed
by us, ready to die this night, cry: "Traitor's Fate!"
