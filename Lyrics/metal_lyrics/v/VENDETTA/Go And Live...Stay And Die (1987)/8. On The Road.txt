On the run we kill to eat, we fight to survive
Never going backwards - speed, powerdive
Headin' for disaster, ride hard and fast
Ferocious warriors, mighty and vast
Boost the power until your eardrums explode
Your desire will fire this rough heavy load
Rush and tremble, come on speed up on the road
Shattering your heads, deadly speed we'll play
All you can do is to get out of our way
Leviathanic metal, pure and loud
You will feel hotter than hell in this crowd
Boost the power until your eardrums explode
Your desire will fire this rough heavy load
Rush and tremble, come on speed up on the road
We run, rip and race full speed ahead
Accelerate on the line to the dead
Still turning faster - ecstasy drive
No speed indicator, we need - powerdive
Boost the power until your eardrums explode
Your desire will fire this rough heavy load
