A new injection's over, watch each step you take
This is a dangerous day
You fired a bomb again, your body starts to ache
Your mind is blown away.
Your eyes are starin' mad, you feel the drug inside
You fly away again now
Will leave this world behind, will reach the blackened sky
But there's no way to find

[Pre-chorus:]
Running, dragging, lying
Living, breathing, trembling, crashing, smash your brain
Drugging, staring, falling, fading, prick your vein

You fuckin' asshole, death must this race
You were just 19 now
How did you live in hell, what a scared old face,
Who was the fiend, you bowed to?
Fuck this illusion, you betrayed yourself,
You couldn't win this game
You were the loser before you began to play
The end for you is this day

[Pre-chorus:]
Running, dragging, lying
Living, breathing, trembling, crashing, smash your brain
Drugging, staring, falling, fading, prick your vein

[Chorus:]
Suicide
It's suicidal lunacy, lunacy!
A fuckin' fool you were,
now murdered by these men.
Lunacy!
They're rich and fit and clean,
will send this shit again.
Lunacy!
Will kill another one, another fool like you.
Lunacy!
You died in dust on drugs and so he will die too.
Lunacy!

[Chorus:]
Suicide [4 times]
