Charging'em tonight - the ordinary man's eternal fight
Leave the loser's road, for power we must strive
And you know you're fuckin' right
Exploitation never stops, you fool why d'you shut up?
Disbeliever die, unscrupulously you'll be crushed tonight,
The axe will fall

[Chorus:]
Force yourself, it's time for breakin' out
Charge, protest and demonstrate, they must hear us shout:

Revolution command

Fighting for the basic right of every man: Equality!
Beat and bite, dethrone the men that suck you out,
Scream and shout: No Loyality!
Revolution for this world, we have to change this mad society.
Abolition of this class consciousness, that they pray,
Fight stupidity!

[Chorus:]
Force yourself, it's time for breakin' out
Charge, protest and demonstrate, they must hear us shout:

Raaaaage!

The conservatists betray the people of this world, make us bleed
Killin' and destroyin' the love between the people
And success is all they need
You're the ones to smash this structure of corruption, crime and hate
You're the ones to bring a future down to earth,
where no one will be betrayed.

[Chorus:]
Force yourself, it's time for breakin' out
Charge, protest and demonstrate, they must hear us shout:

Raaaaage!
