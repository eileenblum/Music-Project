[Vocals: Micky/Daxx]

Tell me who's the Lord of justice, tell me who is right.
Who's to say that I am wrong, who is on whose side?
You condemn me, prejudice and your ego blurs your eyes.
You don't want to hear me speak, you think you are wise.

We were quiet far too long
We were weak and you were strong
We don't believe in...don't belong to you.

I don't want the state in this form: am I just insane?
This is no democracy, you're the ones I blame.
You can call me "Anarchist", call me what you want.
I can call you "damned fascist", but this is not the point

What I want is only justice, what I want is only peace.
What we need is conversation, but do you really care 'bout
what we need.
What I want is only justice, what I want is only peace.
What we need is conversation, but you don't give a damn
what we need.

Sometimes I do ask myself: "Shit, what can I do?
Shall I really fight with weapons?" But that's not what I want to do.
I implore you, can't you see that it's a dead-end road.
Some just stopped talking, so the bomb will soon explode.
What I want is only justice, what I want is only peace.
What we need is conversation, but you don't give a damn we need.

Who is right, who is wrong?
We were quiet, you were strong
We don't believe in...don't belong to you.
'Cause of this should we be wrong.
