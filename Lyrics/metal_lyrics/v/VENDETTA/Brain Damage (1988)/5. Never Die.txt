[Vocals: Micky]

What is in my brain, am I just the same, is it just imagination?
Question in my mind: can I ever find the way on the look-out for my soul?
Who can tell the truth, can you tell me who?
Did they find the right religion?
What's eternal life? Who has got the right answer to the question of a fool?

Why do you need the feeling that something of you will never die?
NEVER DIE?

Why do you need the feeling that something of you will never die?
Is it just anxiety, is it only death you deny?

Tell me where's the place, is there a trace, where I can find the great redemption.
Living without time, agony or crime in a land of the immortal souls.
Wish I could believe in living without grief, could believe in revelation.
Could believe in God, could pray for your Lord, wish I would be taught to unfold myself.

Why do you need the feeling that something of me will never die?
NEVER DIE?
Why do you need the feeling that something of me will never die?
Is it just anxiety, is it only death I deny?
NEVER DIE - NEVER DIE
