[Vocals: Daxx]

War - hey mother, do you want war, hey mother?
War - murdered love, aggression, war, brutality.
War - black, white, red, yellow mother do you want the war?
War - unborn love, aggression, war, malevolence, war.

War - in your country, atomic killers in your country.
War - arms and weapons are the ones, who killed your father in the Second World War
War - in the Thrid Reich or in Vietnam, pain's still the consequence.
War - made'em die in Iraq and Hiroshima. - War!

[Chorus:]
Many people lost their lives.
Noone gave them a chance for SURVIVAL
Who can tell me why.
Let's have a better world and a beter time. -
Need a better time!

[Solo: Micky]

NO MORE BOMBS, NO MORE WAR, no more battles, no more.
No more killing, NO MORE WAR, no more weapons, no more
(God damned, damned war). SAND UP FOR LOVE!

[Solo: Micky]

So people stand up now. It's your duty to stop the military triumph.
Bring the peace back to us so we can forget our bloody history.
Give'em reason, give'em brains. NEED A HAPPY END to this infernal horror story.
Live in fear never more. WANT TO LIVE my life in harmony -
Not in war.

[Chorus:]
Many people lost their lives.
Noone gave them a chance for SURVIVAL
Who can tell me why.
Let's have a better world and a beter time. -
Need a better time!
