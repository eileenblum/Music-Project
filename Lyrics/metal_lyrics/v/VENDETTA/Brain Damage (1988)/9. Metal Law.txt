[Vocals: Micky]

Power, destruction, mayhem and death, hot violation.
Flashing our swords, killing all that we can, we will attack you.
Feeling the power of our inner soul, (you) can't stop the fighters.
March of the maniacs, battle and war, frenzied assassins.

Thunder and lightning, legions rise in the night.
Don't look behind you, warriors are ready to fight.

Now we will burn you, your bodies surrender. Your minds are possessed.
Crushing cold feelings will conquer your soul. Noone defends you.
Power invasion - the message of war. "Hail Heavey Metal".
Fighting on stage for the metal command. The war has begun now.

Thunder and lightning, legions rise in the night.
Don't look behiind you, warriors are ready to fight.

[Solo: Micky-Daxx-Micky-Daxx]

Cry at war, fight until the end.
Break the law, join the mighty band.
Look around, killers everywhere.
Maniacs shout: "We will dare!"
