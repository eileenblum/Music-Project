There was a race, beings of mystic nature, born for living, going on dying.
There's a planet out in space that looks like the distorted face of a dying man

Imperfection, slow reaction to a demolition course.
An appearance of constructed misunderstandings.

These creatures had some words with meaning. They called'em love, peace
and brotherhood. Simple theory - simple feelings? - So trivial that they
misunderstood them.

Imperfection, slow reaction to a demolition course.
An appearance of constructed misunderstandings.

Life on earth had been so simple to live.
The only thing they had to give was a little love and cooperation.
Time has told the sense of community.
but God forgot to make them see, forgot to give'em more feelings.

An appearance of constructed misunderstandings.

Man was intelligent, imperfect, ignorant. This made him live, this made him die.
There was no distinction in science between life and suicide.
Irrutation, violation of his nature, of his mother, destroying each other -
fuckin' mad like a conflict between the sun and sunlight.

LIFE AND LOVE GAVE WAY TO LUXURY.
CREATION REDUCED TO ABSURDITY!
