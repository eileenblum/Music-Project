A winter sun is rising on a pale horizon
A fell chill is in the air
As the embrace of rime-frost descends upon the valley
A war-wind howls down from the north

So draw your sword and look your foe straight in the eye
His blood will run red down your steel this day

Oh, sing a song for the fallen
Oh, sing a song for the lost
Oh, sing a song for the fallen
Oh, sing a song for the lost

The war-horn's call ignites the raging flames of battle
Two armies meet their fates this day
I hear my brothers fall to a song of splitting chain-mail
A death-cry chorus ringing loud

So sheathe your blade and watch your foe now as he dies
His blood has run red down your steel this day

Oh, sing a song for the fallen
Oh, sing a song for the lost
Oh, sing a song for the fallen
Oh, sing a song for the lost

Here beneath a winter sky
Into glorious battle ride
Hear the wargod's mighty call
Heroes rise and heroes fall
Steel is drawn and sheathed in blood
Warriors crushed by the iron flood
Every man fought brave and bold
Our story will be told
For all eternity

Oh, sing a song for the fallen
Oh, sing a song for the lost
Oh, sing a song for the fallen
Oh, sing a song for the lost
