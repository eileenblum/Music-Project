Riding through the night
With the devil on our tails
Cities change but the songs remain
And it's time to rock again

We left our mountain home
We watched the Salt Lake lights
Disappear in the rear-view mirror
And damn it feels so right

We ride the stars we hit the road
It may not be much but it's the life we chose
We watch the city lights
They're flying by like comets in the night

Amps roaring
A storm is coming
We feel the lightning in our veins

Wheels burning
The road is calling
Unleash the thunder in our hearts

Saxon, Dio, and Priest
On the stereo
Cities change but the songs remain
And it's time to hit the road

We left our mountain home
We watched the Salt Lake lights
Disappear in the rear-view mirror
And damn it feels so right

We ride the stars we hit the road
It may not be much but it's the life we chose
We watch the city lights
They're flying by like comets in the night
