Two brothers young and bright
Plunged into the black of night
When power twisted through their hearts

Bonds of fraternity
Severed by antiquity
Cut by a thirst for Thran machines

You now this battle can't end well
So cast your final spell

Now we behold
The Brothers' War
So we behold
The Brothers' War

Titanic war machines
Sword and steel and sorcery
Terisiare engulfed in flames

As Gix and Mishra's force
Were met with Urza's last resort
Invoke the Sylex, end the war

You now this battle can't end well
So cast your final spell

Now we behold
The Brothers' War
So we behold
The Brothers' War

As smoke takes wing unto the sky
We watch as armies fight and die
As battle-engines cleave dread pathways through the
Fallen where they lie
An ancient artifact invoked
Argoth is torn apart and so
Dominaria is thrust into a barren age of ice

Now we behold
The Brothers' War
So we behold
The Brothers' War
