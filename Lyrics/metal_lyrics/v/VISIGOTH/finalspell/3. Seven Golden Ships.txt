Seven ships of gold are sailing
To the end of the world
Winds of destiny's pull are howling
As their great sails unfurl

We will face unknown perils
Of the ocean's expanse
On our search for immortality
Take our fate in our hands

So we defy all the tales of gods and men
As we write our own destiny

We stand and fight
And we won't die
We stand and fight
We are immortal and unbound

Feel the wrath of the ocean god now
Defiant still we sail forth
The thousand heads of the hydra striking
It will fall to our swords

We stand victorious and undaunted
Approaching mythical land
Far beyond wild waves uncharted
Our voyage comes to an end

So we defy all the tales of gods and men
As we write our own destiny

We stand and fight
And we won't die
We stand and fight
We are immortal and unbound

So we will ride deep into the starlit night
Carving through raging waves of death and fate
We defy all the tales of gods and men
As we write our own destiny

We stand and fight
And we won't die
We stand and fight
We are immortal and unbound
