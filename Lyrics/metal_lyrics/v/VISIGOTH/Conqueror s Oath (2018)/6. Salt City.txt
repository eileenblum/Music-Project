Shadows are banished form the
Darkened thrones they took above our valley city
Slain by a shimmering midnight dawn of neon lights
Revel in the warmth of summer nights
Don't think of sorrows that we left behind
We it the sidewalk and we hold our heads up high

Salt City livin', this is the place that we call home
Salt City livin', we ride beneath the mountain thrones
Salt City livin', this town is ours to take tonight
Salt City livin', we won't rest until the morning's light

Now driving high across the 80
I can see beyond the setting sun
The city lights below a sea of burning stars
So grab a Wasatch, knock it back
And don't forget to grab a few for us
The night is young and so are we and that's enough

Salt City livin', this is the place that we call home
Salt City livin', we ride beneath the mountain thrones
Salt City livin', this town is ours to take tonight
Salt City livin', we won't rest until the morning's light

[Lead: Campana]

Salt City livin', this is the place that we call home
Salt City livin', we ride beneath the mountain thrones
Salt City livin', this town is ours to take tonight
Salt City livin', we won't rest until the morning's light
