Cold is the crown of death
Fear in its chilling breath
Howls like wraiths upon the wind

Watch with weeping eyes
Flames on a bleeding sky
I have seen true betrayal

Sorrow fills my soul
Reforged by the cold flames of hate
Past the point off no return

Vengeance guide my hand
Brothers no more, in single combat we stand
So draw your final breath
Bitter is the end

Fly through the traitors' gate
I am the raver that rides on the cold winds of hate
So fear my return

Stars, be my blazing guide
Lighting my way like torches that murders the night
Fear my return

Betrayer, deceiver
My words are a sword of cleansing flame
Betrayer, deceiver
I vomit a course upon your name

Open the Traitors' Gate
So fear my return, I am the hammer of fate

Blood like a ruby curse
Stab wounds ensconced in my spine like a diadem's jewels
Dread crown upon my brow

Die now like the dog you are
Slain by my hand but the doing was no-one's but yours
I am the face of all that you've done

Betrayer, deceiver
My words are a sword of cleansing flame
Betrayer, deceiver
I vomit a course upon your name

Open the Traitor's Gate
So fear my return, I am the hammer of fate

By spite and thunder
Torn asunder
No tomorrow
Now that I've seen what you are I can only bring
Spite and thunder
Feral hunter
Death shall stalk you
No mercy left in my heart and I'll never back down

Silent I stand, grim as the winter night's jaws
Thus I descend, ironclad in my resolve
So make your peace
With every god that abandoned you on your last night
Reap now what you've sown
I am the scythe, I am the revenant blade
Weep now, welcome death

[Lead: Campana]

Betrayer, deceiver
My words are a sword of cleansing flame
Betrayer, deceiver
I vomit a course upon your name

Open the Traitor's Gate
So fear my return, I am the hammer of fate

Die, traitor, die
Look me in the eye
Die, coward, die
As I take your life
