I did not choose this life but here I stand
With tempered steel I will repay their betrayals this night
Into the reaches of the shadow land
With demon-fire burning deep in my heart I will fight

From darkness I rise, a wraith in the black
In cover of night, prepare for attack

Blades in the night
The darkness I ride, in the shadows I fight
Blades in the night
The darkness I ride, in the shadows I fight

[Lead: Campana]

I'm never seen unless I wish to be
So fear the twilight fall for I am the fist of the moon
I have no time to dwell on sorrows now
This is my path, by fury cursed
And by vengeance consumed

From darkness I rise, a wraith in the black
In cover of night, prepare for attack

Blades in the night
The darkness I ride, in the shadows I fight
Blades in the night
The darkness I ride, in the shadows I fight

I am the razor wind that whispers through the trees
With this ancestral blade, I'll conquer any foe
My vengeance will be swift and silent, my judgement deft

From darkness I rise, a wraith in the black
In cover of night, prepare for attack

[Lead: Palmer]

[Lead: Campana]

[Lead: Campana]

Blades in the night
The darkness I ride, in the shadows I fight
Blades in the night
The darkness I ride, in the shadows I fight
