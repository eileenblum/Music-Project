She feels the frost and the fire
She feels the roar of desire
Feed her blazing will to live

She'll never fall, never falter
She spills her blood on the altar
Sacrifice for victory
War and destiny

Above a winter battlefield
Thunder sings her name
Warrior queen, forged in steel
Tempered in the flames of war
Fierce and free, fearless conqueror
Goddess of the metal storm

She is the throat of the lion
She is the teeth of defiance
Bared against the skeins of fate

She is the wings of the raven
Against the winds of enslavement
On the field she stands alone
She's come to claim the throne

Across a winter battlefield
She rides with swords and chains

Warrior queen, forged in steel
Tempered in the flames of war
Fierce and free, fearless conqueror
Goddess of the metal storm
Warrior queen

[Lead: Campana]

Cold silence rolls across
The field like a parting kiss
And sorrow fills her aching heart
She marches through the fog
All hope and glory lost
But she came all this way
And she raises a fist to the sky

Hail the coming of the conqueror
Hail the forging of the warrior
She stands alone

Warrior queen, forged in steel
Tempered in the flames of war
Fierce and free, fearless conqueror
Goddess of the metal storm
Warrior queen
