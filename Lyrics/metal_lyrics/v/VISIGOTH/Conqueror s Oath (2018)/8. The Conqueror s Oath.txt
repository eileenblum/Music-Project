Do you ever feel
That your life was meant to be so much more
As if your soul is lost and far from home
Dashed like a wayward ship
An the rocks of a distant shore

Be still our hearts
And come the flood
Sing through our souls
Like thunder and blood

Stand and swear the conqueror's oath
May your name and deeds live on
Stand and swear the conqueror's oath
Let the ancient fire burn

Are you content
With the life that you lead
Or does a yearning for glory and conquest
Haunt you in fitful sleep

Nothing will change
If you don't take up your arms
And ride unfettered into the unknown
With pride in your heart

Be still our hearts
And come the flood
Sing through our souls
Like thunder and blood

Thrones on the mountains calling your name
Thundering hammers forging you fate
Cut your own path to victory's gates
Never let go of the flame
Purpose and passion, metal and might
Out of the darkness, into the light
Never again will despair take your life
Ride with fire, conquering the night

[Lead: Campana]

Aging warrior, looking back at the life that you've led
Can you say with confidence that you would do it again?
For one day you'll be gone, and all that lives on
Is the honour of thy name and the deeds that you've done

Be still our hearts
And come the flood
Sing through our souls
Like thunder and blood
