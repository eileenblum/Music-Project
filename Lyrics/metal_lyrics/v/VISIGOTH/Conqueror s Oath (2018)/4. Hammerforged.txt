Out from the slave pits
By combat's savage rite
You'll claim your destiny
On iron wings you'll fly

Heralded by
The thunder of hooves
Galloping hard through the rain
Fight for your life as battle arrives
You won't give in to the pain

Never to worship
Never to kneel
It's time now to sunder the chains
Never to bow for you won't pledge fealty
Never to live as a slave

Hear our voices
War leader lead us to war
Feel the fire
The power to fight ever more
Hear our voices
War leader lead us to war
Feel the fire
The power to fight evermore

You're hammer-forged
You are the anvil
You are the blade
You'll ride and you'll fight to the end
Nothing can stand in your way but yourself
Conquer your doubt and ascend

Never to worship
Never to kneel
It's time now to sunder the chains
Never to bow for you won't pledge fealty
You will not live as a slave

Hear our voices
War leader lead us to war
Feel the fire
The power to fight ever more
Hear our voices
War leader lead us to war
Feel the fire
The power to fight evermore

Heat the steel
Feed the flames
Forge your fate
Break the chains

[Lead: Campana]

Hear our voices
War leader lead us to war
Feel the fire
The power to fight ever more
Hear our voices
War leader lead us to war
Feel the fire
The power to fight evermore
You're hammer-forged
