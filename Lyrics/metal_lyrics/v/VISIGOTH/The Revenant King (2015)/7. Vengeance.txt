This woodland village is the only home I've ever known
Through burning tears I watch it all consumed by flames

From the south
They came
With iron and fire

I take my father's blade and shield into my vengeful hands
My sword won't rest until the day they've all been slain

From the north
I will come
With cold, hateful judgment

This tale of vengeance
Will be told
As written in the blood of my foes
This tale of vengeance
Will unfold
Before the night is done they will fall

The blood upon my hands avenges all that I have lost
But still the battle-rage is coursing through my veins

From the south they came
With iron and fire

I stand victorious above the final treacherous dog
The world becomes and empty shell now as he dies

From the north I have come
With cold, hateful judgment

This tale of vengeance
Will be told
As written in the blood of my foes
This tale of vengeance
Will unfold
Before the night is done they will fall

I've been wandering for so long
Only starlight guides my way
The steel at my side has become so heavy
But still I carry on

Leaves have fallen
Winter comes
The gods have left me on my own
And when the flames have turned to ashes
Still I will carry on

This tale of vengeance
Will be told
As written in the blood of my foes
This tale of vengeance
Will unfold
Before the night is done they will fall
