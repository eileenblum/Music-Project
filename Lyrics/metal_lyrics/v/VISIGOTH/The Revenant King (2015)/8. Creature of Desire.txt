For a long time I have roamed
These barren, heartless streets alone
Where the burning stars seemed far away

But in the dark of night I've seen
The moon arising in my dreams
She is here and we'll set the world ablaze

Fire and steel
Smoke and burning wheels
She's my goddess of the night

Leather and spikes
I wanna treat her right
This warrior queen here at my side

Two wheels are burning down the road and she's on fire
And we are riding like the wind
I'm free at last and she's a creature of desire
Oh we will never kneel again

We are the rulers of the street
No submission, no retreat
We are star fire in the blazing sky

On a metal beast we ride
As we tear on through the night
We have tasted freedom and we won't die

Fire and steel
Smoke and burning wheels
She's my goddess of the night

Leather and spikes
I wanna treat her right
This warrior queen here at my side

Two wheels are burning down the road and she's on fire
And we are riding like the wind
I'm free at last and she's a creature of desire
Oh we will never kneel again
