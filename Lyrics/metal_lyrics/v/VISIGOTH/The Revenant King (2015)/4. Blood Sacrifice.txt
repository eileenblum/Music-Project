[Solo: Jamison]

The late October moon rises through the fog
Alabaster witness to the rite
Hooded figures bowed deep within the trees
Thirteen gathered for the sacrifice

Deep in the forest thirteen hooded figures stand
The hour of the ritual is now at hand
They've gathered for the sacrifice
A gnarled hand extends above the altar stone
An incantation rises from its hoary throat
A spell invoked to claim the night

Incantation, evil magick rise

Blood sacrifice, an ancient rite
Blood sacrifice upon the altar stone
Blood sacrifice, an ancient rite
Blood sacrifice unto the pentagram

The pale moon bathes the virgin's skin in pallid light
Entranced by verses tolled from forms deep in the night
Her final breath is drawn in blood
As crimson creeps across the cracked and ancient stone
Five-pointed star ignites and belches forth black smoke
Demonic forces summoned forth

Incantation, evil magick rise

Blood sacrifice, an ancient rite
Blood sacrifice upon the altar stone
Blood sacrifice, an ancient rite
Blood sacrifice unto the pentagram

With human offal offering, we gaze into the great abyss
We summon thee, oh Antichrist
This virgin's blood so red and pure will bind your will unto our own
Bow before the horned god

[Solo: Leeland, Jamison, Leeland, Jamison]

Rise on wings as black as night
Summoned by the sacrifice
Chaos reigns and death is come
Twisted horns eclipse the sun

The late October sky streaked with blood and fire
Yawning gateway to the underworld
From the altar the young girl rises with cold black haunted eyes
Chosen queen of a brimstone kingdom come
The reborn empress of hell

[Solo: Leeland]

Incantation, evil magick rise

Blood sacrifice, an ancient rite
Blood sacrifice upon the altar stone
Blood sacrifice, an ancient rite
Blood sacrifice unto the pentagram
