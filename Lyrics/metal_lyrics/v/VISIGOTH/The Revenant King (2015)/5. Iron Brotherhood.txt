Leather black in the night
Hammers, chains, and spikes
No fear or weakness

This is the path we chose
Always true to the code
Stand beside each other

Raise your fist beside your brothers
Stand eternally proud
We are the true and the brave
Forever one with the sound
We are the iron brotherhood

Falsehood crushed by our will
We cannot be killed
Strength and honour immortal

Anthems rise to the sky
Brothers in arms unite
Our voices unified

Raise your fist beside your brothers
Stand eternally proud
We are the true and the brave
Forever one with the sound
We are the iron brotherhood

We walk the streets with heads held high
Eternally we march with armoured hearts full of pride
We're standing strong against the world
And we will hold our ground and fight until we die

Raise your fist beside your brothers
Stand eternally proud
We are the true and the brave
Forever one with the sound
We are the iron brotherhood
