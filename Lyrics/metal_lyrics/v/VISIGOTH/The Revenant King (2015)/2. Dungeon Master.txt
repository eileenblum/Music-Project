Far beyond the mountains and tresses of the sea
Dark horizons black will rumble with the voice of prophecy
We are standing steadfast against a gathering dark
As our battle-iron flashes countless foul beasts will fall

Take a chance, roll the dice
Is this hell or paradise?
In this land of high adventure carve your fate
Forgotten realms, magick spells
Hallowed halls beneath the fells
He's the master of the evil in deep

He's the dungeon master

Master of evil, lord of the dark
In catacombs and blackened tomes is where is foul will is wrought
But on the field of battle, see our legions ride
Thunderous hooves like raging storms will sound across the azure sky

Take a chance, roll the dice
Is this hell or paradise?
In this land of high adventure carve your fate
Forgotten realms, magick spells
Hallowed halls beneath the fells
He's the master of the evil in deep

He's the dungeon master

We've traveled long, we've traveled far
With shining steel and morning star
We call upon the gods of old
In ancient texts it was foretold

We are the legions who will ride into the dawn
The war will take its toll but we will carry on
So raise your banners to the sky and let us hear your battle cries
Now let the horns resound and call for victory
The hordes advance but we are fierce and we are free
So loose your arrows to the sky and raise your magick steel on high

[Solo: Jamison, Leeland]

We are the pathfinders, we are the travelers
We are the voices of steel in the night
We are the warriors, we are the sorcerers
And our magick will light up the sky

Take a chance, roll the dice
Is this hell or paradise?
In this land of high adventure carve your fate
Forgotten realms, magick spells
Hallowed halls beneath the fells
He's the master of the evil in deep

He's the dungeon master
