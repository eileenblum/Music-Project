[Lead: Campana]

Beware the dark, for it may take you
When silence comes, don't let it break you

Draconic days, a distant age
Shiftless in their endless gray
Trees like towers standing sentinel and cold
Then from the dark, like blazing scythes
Came fire cutting through the night
An age of lords was forged in warfare and disparity of light

Ashen one, this world is dying
Embrace the sun, the time has come, your flame is rising
Ashen one, the dark is howling
Push ever on, raise your sword, become the bane of the abyss

Death will come in endless waves
As distant fire guides your way
It is your curse to seek its light until the end
The fear of gods has always been
The sentencing of doom for men
And so the pillars of this tragedy are set in hollow stone

Ashen one, this world is dying
Embrace the sun, the time has come, your flame is rising
Ashen one, the dark is howling
Push ever on, raise your sword, become the bane of the abyss

Go forth, awaken now
Strike the ancient bells
Your soul will shape this world
You are the tolling knell
So claim the souls of lords
Throned and fire-crowned
Rage with humanity
Once hollow, now unbound

Ashen one, this world is dying
Embrace the sun, the time has come, your flame is rising
Ashen one, the dark is howling
Push ever on, raise your sword, become the bane of the abyss
