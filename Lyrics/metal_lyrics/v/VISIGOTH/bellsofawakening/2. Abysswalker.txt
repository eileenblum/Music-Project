In the dark there lurks a shadowed truth
Far beneath the ancient stones
The soul of primeval man has been profaned
No fiend or foe could ever match my skill
My blade is feared throughout the land
The black heart of the abyss will die by my hand

It is my solemn charge to guard the flame
Into aphotic depths I ride to meet my fate

Ancient fire, fill my raging heart
As I charge into the endless dark
Steel my will against what hell may come
I will not turn back, I know what must be done

With a battle-wolf proudly at my side
And a great sword in my hand
We know what our duty demands
But nothing could have prepared us for this
The primal force that lurks within the dark
Is twisted by sorrow and rage
I know it will cost me my life, but I must help my companion escape

It is my solemn charge to guard the flame
In those aphotic depths I met my storied fate
Ancient fire, fill my raging heart
As I charge into the endless dark
Steel my will against what hell may come
I will not turn back, I know what must be done

[Lead: Palmer]

I feel the claws of darkness sink into my soul
And as they begin to change me, I know that I must let go
Ashen one, in combat come and take my life from me
Forgive me, all of you, for I have availed you nothing

Ancient fire, fill my raging heart
As I charge into the endless dark
Steel my will against what hell may come
I will not turn back, I know what must be done

Dying fire filled my anguished heart
As I fought against the endless dark
I broke my will against the hell that came
Relieve me of my charge
Carry on the flame
