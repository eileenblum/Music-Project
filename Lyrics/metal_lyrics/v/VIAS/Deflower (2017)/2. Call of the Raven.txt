The Sun awakes and shines on thee
Enlightening the blackened me
The smell of cold returns to ice
To colonize the ground of white
And wrapped in suede with wooden spears
To hark the days of snow and fear
The trembling of earth below
With common voices barking low
The colony awaiting their turn
Civilization trenching and burn
Become and waste of a reason to live
To live and die and never forgive
Voices of the present and past
The luck of which and whom it will last
Partition with the side that will give
To end their lives and lets us to live

Raising daggers
Harking power
Time and reason
Marching louder
Fleeing empty
Die with just cause
Rise and conquer
Heathen

Turn around the Will and face yourself into the trees
Flee into the forest, hide inside the hallowing breeze
Strike upon submission and harvest to the hide or freeze
End all of their lives with passion and reign supreme

Wrap yourself with hide and cloth
Chameleon and don't get caught
Grinding with a scalding flame
Decease and remain your tame
Withering the blade of might
Melee with band of spite
To step along the soil floor
With the head of his truly gore
The rain between winds shines to answer the call
Of the one who's in charge of the radial hall
For he, who seeks vengeance in the name of their land
With the army of disposable fighters at hand
And the will to earn victory and sharpen their words
As the tongues of young men barrel no reserve
That until the once lost and forgotten haven
Was bludgeoned and impaled by the call of the raven

Freezing
Dying
Four words
Lying
Comes to prospect
Give and reject

For the lives of ones that are waiting
Death to the beings of wry and hatred
Free to give all or sacrifice unto the gods
Bound upon ice with on the cold on the lashes of frost

On the ice that's still strong
With the weight of the world on us
We fight to the death
Fearing nothing to lose at all
To defeat the unseen
As for we do not believe
That the one's who exist
Are all right in front of me

Pray for life unto being
As the wounds of war will never heal
They void the will of being home
For the time that comes, the cuts will seal
Breathe the air and smell of death
And accept the water of bloody breath
Forget the mind the once was brave
And focus on the mind of hate.
Pace...

Battle still ensues in the North
Waving axes, impaling swords
Weakened by the ice and the snow
In the mountains far beyond through.
The game of life and death is dealt
For the odds will favour no one else
The chime of wrath has begun
To fight until the morning sun
Voices of the suffering ones
Will be silenced by the warriors tongues
With the medic has been frozen in air
And the cryogenic life that's despaired
Energy has risen in flames
Conjuring the dark spell of dismay
Feeding off the slaughtered fiends
And laughing to commander regime

Raising daggers
Harking power
Time and reason
Marching louder
Fleeing empty
Die with just cause
Rise and conquer
Heathen

Turn around the Will and face yourself into the trees
Flee into the forest, hide inside the hallowing breeze
Strike upon submission and harvest to the hide or freeze
End all of their lives
Execute the free
End all of their lives
Jarring woe is me
Take command of sheppard
Willful as the go
Take command of treason
Wrath the god of me
For me
