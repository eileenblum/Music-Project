I stare in wonder
At the eye of the storm
I'm stripped and hungered
For the loss that I mourn
So hold these shackles
That saddle me down
As I wait for the entrance for this water I drown
Wreathed with fear
From the ones who dealt life
I walk the path that's been guided by light
Avoid the darkness
That lingers at me
And receive the uprising that ensnares me to be

My heart's contempt as we walk through the darkness
With help from the wise and assist all the others
We walk this path to our destination
Along the road with the depths below us

The path has narrowed
To abreast that we walk
Shoulder to Shoulder
And our soles on the rocks
Ascend the spiral
And walk on the clouds
As the weight of the world is standing below our ground
The call of thunder
The cry of the grey
Lightning has struck us
In the midst of the rain
This poison water
Is dissolving our sins
Circle of life
Reset to begin

Awaken from the dream
And rise
Into
Determination

My heart's contempt as we walk through the darkness
With help from the wise and assist all the others
We walk this path to our destination
Along the road with the depths below us
Above the sky and beyond the stars
The leaders of life and desire
Controlled by living and cater to death
The confusion at last is denied

Blown away from Earth
The soul of our rebirth
As the chosen one
Was born before the sun
