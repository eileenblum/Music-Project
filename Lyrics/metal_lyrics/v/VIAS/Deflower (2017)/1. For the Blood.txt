On this this cold, brisk night
I mourn the loss which I became
Fear the rest of the harmless one
Rain falls from the sky,
Thick fog and howling winds:
Creating mist, blurring visions

Kneel down to the gods
Submit to suffering
Suffering from my sins

Forgive me father
For I had no knowledge
Knowledge for the blood

Fought for power, wealth, family
Now I stand weak, rich,
And my blood staining my pelt
Where is my reward?
I've lost it all. Mankind grows weak
The gods grow in ignorance

Kneel down to the gods
Submit to suffering
Suffering from my sins

Oh my mother, forgive me knowledge
My vengeance holds no boundaries

Take the blood from our bodies,
Push us further just to drown your lies
Health meter of casualties
Drain the bar for your demise

Thy love and hate is brutal
Fill my heart with soil and grieve
Plant seeds decayed with oil
Cry from the hands that feed

This void of emptiness
Is the one that's overflowed
To avoid the death and soulless
Become who's wanted most!
