In morning light is red
With cold steel at my bed
That pierces fading hearts
Disables body parts
The dawn has come and gone
The horsemen to be drawn
The beam of rising snow
And horror to be shown
March forth and be prepared
Waft the surrounding air
Breathe out the toxic hate
And stir the pot of luck and life's dismay

Fighting the ways of our doom
Climbing the mountains and moon
Desire bleeds from our side
Ending all of new life
Wheezing and drowning with oil
Insides exposed on the soil
Forgiving is least of concerns
Dying as time slowly turns

It starts with blasphemy
And all the light can see
When rain comes pouring down
It layers our new ground
By night, the howling grows
The sounds, nobody knows
And gods up in the sky
Who help us by our side
It turns the mist of the reason
To drown its ways content
This fight that is its season
Will be battled out of tent
The forge of iron and steel
And the clanging metal sounds
With might, and strength
The time will come and conquer all surround

Die! Destroy the light the and sound
Conquering worlds of ground
Design the face of the night
Sacrifice into the the light
Concern the works of the gods
Pray to the ones tied in locks
Serpents that slither and prey
Caring demise, dismay!
