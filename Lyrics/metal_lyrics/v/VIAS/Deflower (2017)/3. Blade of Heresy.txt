Lock the door as the wind grow strong
When death is at your doorstep
Taste the air and feed on the salt
From the anger of your foes
Lay in suede with your fellow man
In armour that you protect
With every aching hour passing
The rising tension grows

Untie these coils
And every rope that succeeds
Unleash the wolves
And sink its teeth into thee

We are the chant that makes us be
To slay the tyrant killing me
Inject us from the veins of smite
Eradicate the intern might
The eye of gods who take them down
Will rip their throats and make them drown
Assist us supernatural
As shielded our view is cull

Bloody is the blade of heresy
Watching the clouds form, darkening
Fuming the candle burning bright
Whickering winds to enable flight
Constructing the towers of blasphemy
Raping and pillaging communities
Decapitate thought, rationality
Dismembering, quarters, mortality

Overview of the combat station
Is watching (in) disregard
Order in the fermented bloodbath
And march with who's in charge
Stream of fluids freezes in contact
Of the bare and icy snow
Entrails colour the sands and leaves
As natural returns the hold

We mind the sore
Cold wind and gore
For sensible formality
Consumed by steel
Wounds never heal
The uncontrolled

Charging into final battle
Ripping, flying limbs of cattle
Enter execution movement
Disembowel ends in torment
I am the one who slays
For action
Churning the cauldron
Life
Death
Crush all the skulls and hands
For power
Leading the ways content
I am the one who slays
For action
Churning the bowl of
Hatred
Making
Pounding the joints of my enemies
As the white ground turns red

Bloody is the blade of heresy
Watching the clouds form, darkening
Fuming the candle burning bright
Whickering winds to enable flight
Constructing the towers of blasphemy
Raping and pillaging communities
Decapitate thought, rationality
Dismembering, quarters, mortality
