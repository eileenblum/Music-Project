Eye for an eye
The words still sound the same
Realize
Survive the shot or die
This is your revolution

Every day
Is a reminder
Of how far we have come
Why should we just accept
Another dissolution

SISTER REVOLUTION
Enemies will face defeat - indeed!
SISTER REVOLUTION

Join the revolution
Sister of your grief
Disgruntled with the thing I see:
Internal enemies!

[Chorus:]
I WARN YOU!
PISTOLS DON'T ARGUE!
THEY WILL DO
ANYTHING YOU ASK

I BEG YOU!
YOU CAN'T STOP THE CROWD
THEY WILL SOON
DEMAND A BELT WITH GUNS

Firebrand
Is in your hand
Your rights they must defend
Against conspiracy
You'll change the constitution

Army of one
Trying to force the rest
To accept
No other law
Revenge inside your head

SISTER REVOLUTION
Enemies will face defeat - indeed!
SISTER REVOLUTION

I know your reputation
It's not another lie
Have no intention of working out a compromise

[Chorus]
