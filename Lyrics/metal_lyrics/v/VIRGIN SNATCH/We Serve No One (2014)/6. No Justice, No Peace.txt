Determination - here we go!
Now this is your sword, this is your revolt
Demand for the right
Right to vote
So put your mind low
To the proper war

NO JUSTICE, NO PEACE
INCREASE POLICE

Imagination this is our fire
Justice is an ideal
To which we aspire
That's why we must fight
We need oversight!
Our exclusion is unjustified!

[Chorus:]
TIME AND TIME AGAIN
YOU MAKE THE ARGUMENT
THAT JUSTICE CAN'T BE ATTAINED
UNTIL YOU DOMINATE

The victim is still dead
The family is devastated
The killer clenches his teeth
Only has his one life to give

NO JUSTICE, NO PEACE
ONE LIFE TO GIVE

There is no contradiction in this phrase
"No justice, no peace' in any case
Until we see fairness
We will not remain silent

Determination - here we go!
Now this is your sword, this is your revolt
Demand for the right
Right to vote
So put your mind low
To the proper war

NO JUSTICE, NO PEACE
