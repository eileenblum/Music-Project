I paid my dues
I have every right to be here now
Through the hard work of mine...
What does it mean?
Only suffering!
A small price to
Dream about you
Raise my hand to the promised land
So I look in the sky
I don't want to comprimise
Let me fly to the stars

If somebody up there likes me
I'm going to find a place to live
You've got to understand me
I've cried so many tears
I'd like to fly
Fly away
Give me help, give me strenght
I believe in this land
Give me hope, give me peace
Deliver promises
Let me find the way...

[Chorus:]
TAKE ME FAR AWAY
RUN AWAY
TO MY PROMISED LAND

I WILL PAY THE PRICE
EVEN TWICE
FOR MY PARADISE

FREEDOM IS EVERYTHING TO ME
I DO NOT HAVE TIME TO THINK
LET ME FIND, FIND THE WAY
TO BE FREE
