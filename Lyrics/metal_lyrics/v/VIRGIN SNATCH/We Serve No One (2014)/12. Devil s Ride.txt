Thousands of years ago
I was created by God
I had a glorious future
Above the heights of the clouds

I was the seal of perfection
But for a short time
My power, wisdom and glory
Became a thorn in the side of Christ!

[Chorus:]
WHY DO YOU STILL CONSPIRE AGAINST ME?
THE UNIVERSE WILL BE SECURE FROM SIN
WHY DO YOU ALLOW PAIN AND SUFFERING?
YOU'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND MY INFINITY!

I am a walking disaster
I am an arsenal of doom
My kingdom must come down!
I'll back into heaven soon!

I'll hear every lie
And I will understand the pain
I'll see when the loved one dies
Hey God, bring back my reign!

[Chorus:]
FINITE BEINGS CAN'T UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING
YOU COULD NO LONGER INFLUENCE ME
THE FREEDOM TO MAKE CHOICES IS AMAZING!
WE SERVE THE GOD'S SQUAD WHO KNOW NOTHING!

WHY DO YOU STILL CONSPIRE AGAINST ME?
THE UNIVERSE WILL BE SECURE FROM SIN
WHY DO YOU ALLOW PAIN AND SUFFERING?
YOU'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND MY INFINITY!
