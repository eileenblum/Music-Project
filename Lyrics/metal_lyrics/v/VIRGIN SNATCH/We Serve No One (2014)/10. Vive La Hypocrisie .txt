Get him out of the country!
Put her in the jail!
Tread their grave!
You will be safe

LIBERTY
EQUALITY
BROTHERHOOD

Entrust authority
To complex crazy false patriots
And other liberators
Throwing the nation
From the shackles

GO ON SAGES
COME ON!

[Chorus:]
YOU WILL DIVIDE AND RULE
DESTROYING EVERYTHING LIKE A BEAST
YOU'VE GOT THE FOOLS READY FOR ALL
RIGHT-LEFT WING POPULISTS

YOU WILL DIVIDE AND RULE
YOUR OWN ATHENIAN DEMOCRACY
JUST A DIFFERENT NAME OF BITCH!
LONG LIVE HYPOCRISY

To win the next election
Use mob psychology
Your voters are damn fools
SUBJUGATE
DESIGNATE
You hold all master keys!

Looking for a scapegoat
Hiding us from the truth
The ministry of mockery
Erasing fucking proof

WE DON'T NEED RED HERRING

[Chorus]
