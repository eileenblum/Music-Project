You, who taught me the truth
The honor value
Under the rules

Integrity
Respect and Duty
Such beautiful words

You can ease the pain
Taking what you don't deserve
Drive a hard bargain
Never!
Anymore!

[Chorus:]
ONE DAY WE WILL SING OUR FREEDOM, OUR JOY
IDEAS SET IN STONE IN THEIR MOST POTENT FORMS
ESCAPE FROM YOUR LEAD I NEED
THE FINAL CHAPTER HAS BEEN READ
GOING TO HAVE YOUR SIGN ON IT
SO DON'T CALL MY NAME IN VAIN

It is so wonderful
Enlighten the fools
The people like you

Sure, it is all the game
The price of the fame
Always the same!

You can ease the pain
Taking what you don't deserve
Drive a hard bargain
Never
Ever again!

[Chorus 2:]
ONE DAY WE WILL SING OUR FREEDOM BUILT FROM BRICKS
ONE DAY WE'LL REJOICE IN THE TRUMPH FOR POLITICS
ESCAPE FROM YOUR LEAD I NEED
THE FINAL CHAPTER HAS BEEN READ
GOING TO HAVE YOUR SIGN ON IT
SO DON'T CALL MY NAME IN VAIN
AGAIN...
