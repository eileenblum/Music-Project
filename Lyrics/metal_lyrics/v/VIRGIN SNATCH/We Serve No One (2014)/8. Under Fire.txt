Let's get something very clear
Before you ask about another deal
I am the liar
I'm under fire
You ask me if I believe in God
It's God that has no faith in us
This is my power

I never said that!
Strife in my head!
Just to stay alive
Sentenced to endless lies

So we are under fire
Justified
I'm the fucking liar!

So we are under fire
Don't be afraid
I don't debate until they pay

[Chorus:]
SO TELL ME HOW IT FEELS
IF YOU CANNOT GIVE
WHAT IS REAL
SO MANY LANGUAGES
THE SAME DISTORTED REALITY

I never said that!
Strife in my head
Just to stay alive
Sentenced to endless lies

WE'VE HEARED IT ALL BEFORE
YOU ARE JUST ANOTHER WHORE
WE WILL NOT BELIEVE ANYMORE
WE SERVE NO ONE, FUCK YOU ALL!

So we are under fire
Justified
I'm the fucking liar!

So we are under fire
Don't be afraid
I don't debate until they pay

[Chorus]
