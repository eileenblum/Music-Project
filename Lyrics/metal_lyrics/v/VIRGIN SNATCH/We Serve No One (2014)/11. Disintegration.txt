I am the last casualty of your game
My land is ruled by people who will disintegrate it!

No time for
Healing my soul
The goal is get over you
Soon we'll say
It's time to pay
For the years of dictators' rule

[Chorus:]
WHO CARES IF WE LIVE OR DIE
WE SERVE NO MORE, NO ONE!
I SEND THE S.O.S. ALARM
KEEP US IN LINE
TOO OLD TO HEAR THE BATTLE CALL
WAR CRY: COLLAPSE, DECLINE
WE ASK FOR HELP EVERYONE
WE SERVE NO MORE, NO ONE

We know that something has to break
So why do you stand like shit and make the next mistakes

You have to
Tell the truth
Revolt has soon to die!
This war in time
Of peace is crime
You cannot justify

[Chorus 2:]
WHO CARES IF WE LIVE OR DIE
WE ARE TOO SHY, TOO BLIND
I SEND THE S.O.S. ALARM
KEEP US IN LINE
TOO OLD TO HEAR THE BATTLE CALL
WAR CRY: COLLAPSE, DECLINE
WE ASK FOR HELP EVERYONE
WE SERVE NO MORE, NO ONE
