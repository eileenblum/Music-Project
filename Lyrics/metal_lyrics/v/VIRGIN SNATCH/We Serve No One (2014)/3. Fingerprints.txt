Political pressure
The unseemly haste
Deliver and measure
The fingerprints of many hands

Evidence neccesary
To identify
The invisible to the naked eye
You try to hold me down

[Chorus:]
ARCH!
LOOP!
TRAIL!
THE ONLY WAY TO LEARN!

LOSE YOUR TAIL!
FAIL!
UNDER THE GREY SURFACE

You're an investigator
My blame is what you need
Your hate is the energy
To wear the cup of liberty

You are talking head who
Occupies the TV screen
Sacrifice deficit
Requires security

[Chorus]

My fingerprints
Erase my fingerprints

[Chorus 2:]
TAKE MY FINGERPRINTS
IF YOU ARE ABLE TO
GIVE THE TRUTH

International commission
To investigate
The tragedy that you play
A face to place the blame

Life is a bitter pill
So make the deal
The motivation is clear
The rule of legal equality

[Chorus:]
ARCH!
LOOP!
TRAIL!
THE ONLY WAY TO LEARN!

LOSE YOUR TAIL
FAIL!
PROCLAIM THE RIGHTS OF MAN

[Chorus 2]
