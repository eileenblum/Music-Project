Every time you've spoken
You've spoken to me
I have never spoken back
No positive feedback

But you can't
Blame me for
The silent abhorrence
Perhaps you are speaking to the
Wrong audience

THIS IS THE MESSAGE FOR ALL:
NEVER NO MORE!

I know your promises:
Whole-life insurance
We will not bind ourselves
To them in advance

Making plans,
Thinking - deep,
Very little sleep
We will not stop fighting till
Justice is achieved

[Chorus:]
WE SERVE NO ONE!
UTOPIANS!
YOU CANNOT BUY
OUR LOYALTY

IT IS NOT A CALL
NO PROTEST SONG
NOT THE SORT WE HAVE IN MIND

Look at that ovation
Feel the ignorance
If you want to deal with me
Fuck the abundance

For some, it is a simple bid:
The size of the chair
That's the best way to show your gratitude

[Chorus]
