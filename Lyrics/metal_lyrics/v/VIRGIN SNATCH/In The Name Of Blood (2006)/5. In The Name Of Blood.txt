[I]
The time is not right
my enemies are too strong
Let's try to use the past
I will tell you when the evidence is clear
Can play with their blood

Through wires and broken past
each wilder and more extreme !
I need your forgiveness
still draining your blood

IN THE NAME OF
BLOOD
IN THE NAME OF
CRIME IS THE NAME OF GOD

The world is going straight down into absurdality
My private gates to hell
Brainwashing everywhere
excellent quality
What is left to sell ?

Why Should They Vote and Be Involved Politically ?
Why are they haunting me
scattering everywhere blood ?

IN THE NAME OF
BLOOD
IN THE NAME OF
CRIME IS THE NAME OD GOD
The time is not right
my enemies are too strong
Let's try to use the past
I will tell you when the evidence is clear
Can play with Your blood
