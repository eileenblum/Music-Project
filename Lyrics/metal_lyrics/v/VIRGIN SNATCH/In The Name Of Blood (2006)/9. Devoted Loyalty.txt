[I]
Awaken to triumph again
in the face of yet
another day, another step in our unified march
into the unwavering purpose...
Move ahead together
into the certainty of our collective destiny

Devoted loyalty
A men without a mind
They do not want to see
They do not want to hear

Collective destiny
Affecting everyone
Void of mentality
why can't these people see ?

[II]
Madness
Starting to infect
I cannot treat you like a friend
Invade in trust, ideals unjust
Do you know what you represent ?

Now only victory
Emptiness in your eyes
Collective destiny
Affecting everyone

Repression misery
of purest liberty
Devoted loyalty
This shit is not for Me !!!
