[I]
Pay Strict attention
to what I say !
Because I choose my words carefully
and I never repeat myself.
I've told you my name
That's who I Am !
We gotta take the power back
So Purge My Stain Again

Purge !
Purge My Stain
From my veins
Don't Give Up !
Don't Let Me Down !
Purge !
Purge My Stain !
Self-Defense
To repaint

IDEALS FOR TRADE !
ARE YOU SCARED YET ?

Judge everyone
Afraid to speak
No need to make me understand
There is one thing that I
I can't explain
Still seeking another revenge

[II]
The clock is ticking
To wipe your blood
to dissolve itself and hold a new
National election

Straight to the devil
Pull harder strings !
Does anyone need to say the truth ?
For - stay away from me !
