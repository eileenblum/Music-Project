[I]
Emotional injury
there is a disease in the heart of man
You cannot change the way you feel
highs of human emotion

No way to end that misery
Your Disease... is : human being
It's symptom is - feel :
HATE, ANGER, RAGE &amp; WAR

What Do You Feel ?
What Do You Need To Kill ?
ALL THOSE THINGS THAT MIGHT
TEMPT US TO FEEL ALMIGHTY

Look At Yourself
Your warships arrive for drill
Spread You dreams on me
Dreams of immorality

High authority
satisfies your greed
Hatred - all you feel
Bred To Kill

[II]
Trying To get
under Your Skin
To sense how an offender
how an enemy thinks

I come to take you down.
I come to take you down.
Pump the blood on the ground
LOST ARE THOSE WHO TRUST YOU !

Look At Yourself
Your warships arrive for drill
Spread Your dreams on me
Dreams of immorality

High authority
satisfies your greed
Hatred - all you feel
Bred To Kill

We come to take you down.
We come to take you down.
LOST ARE THOSE WHO TRUST YOU !
