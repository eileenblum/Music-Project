[I]
Still I don't know why you're dying
Long before your time has come
Who will take you to - you-know-where
...I want to be

Now You're sleeping, left alone
In the last remaining glow
I am trying to understand

Find the key, open the door and you step inside
You will free from what what you want
Trying to remember where it all began
I will keep you in the corner of my eyes

Now You're sleeping, no more pain
And the last breath that you take
I am trying to understand

I will scream
At Your demise
It's always start again
Minutes seem like eternity

Graze the skin
At your demise
Memories
What used to be

[II]
Keep this going and step forward,
through the black door of my head
I don't want to see what I'll need to forget
Purest hatred aimed at You God, Let it be
Let Me show You How I Hate You

Now You sleeping, time has come
In the last remaining shine
I am trying to understand

I will scream
At Your demise
It's always start again
Minutes seem like eternity

Graze the skin
At your demise
Memories
What used to be
