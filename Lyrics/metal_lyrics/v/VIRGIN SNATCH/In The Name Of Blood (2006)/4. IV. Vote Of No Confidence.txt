[I]
Pay For Lies
Pray for mercy !!
I don't want anything for You !!
Desperate
Self create
That's what we all begin to learn

Tall stories, enemies delights your soul
Disrespect we don't deserve
Suckin' up, mannierism: Republic IV
Who caused your hatred and pain

Don't try to reach absolute domination
Incriminating with no sense
The situation is infected by Lour Lies
Supporting the cultural decay

[II]
Punishment,
For All You Sins
Say At least : I Repent
Absolute
Government
Burned is the ground, dried is the land

FOUR
Vote Of No Confidence !!!

[III]
Sacrifice
And Motivate
Possession of you laws
Liberty
Good TV
Two sides of the same coin

Voters keep on fighting, We're living in
infant democrazy
it seems there's a lot of profit to be
Ready to do anything
