[I]
Hey Mr "all knowing" !
You did not know my name
I let myself down again
Down the drain
Down the drain

Hey Mr "all knowing" !
Your soul must b insane
False sense of pride, satisfies
All your lies
All your lies

Now Die !
Lies another day
You take all the blame

Don't trust smile !
Don't compromise !
Climb up my broken spine
No More Time To Fool Around !
Who Are You to know everything !

Flowing Corruption
Endless Pain
Solidarity - Lost Remain

[II]
Hey Mr "all knowing"
new power flows in me
no reason for suicide
I will fight !
Fight For my rights !

Hey Mr "all knowing" !!
Put bullet in your brain
You broke the rules before
someone else trust You

Don't trust smile !
Don't compromise !
Climb up my broken Spine
No More Time For Stupid Games !
No More Words Left Into Say !
