[I]
Mentally divergent
in that I am escaping certain
Unnamed realities
that plague my whole life !

To reduce my sentence
you play an important role in
another government
Don't mock me, Prime Head !

You can't change anything
I am major sacrifice
Do you see Me ?
My State Of Fear...

[II]
I Am disorientated
I'm feeling like ward of court
Totally manipulated
You forced me to become so weak

United by power
My mouth shaped to scream
prophecies of crazed fanatics
could be a real mistake

Emotions Screaming In Me [x2]
Too High Velocity
Unending State Of Fear
Fills My Minds
