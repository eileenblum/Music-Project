[I]
Don't blame me - for what you do again
Why can't You listen to community
Contempt and hatred all you feel
All what you want is always good only for You

Feel My eyes burning holes in Your head
then you will listen to what I say
Justified, illegal, Paralyzed
Legal defence to lies

Breeding your deception
Losing faith again
I don't see more chances
Lost Are Those Who Trust You

HATRED IN YOUR EYES
Nowhere to Run... Nowhere To Hide...
CROSSES IN YOUR HANDS
Burning inside...
Diminished mind...

[II]
Why do we waste time on new hope
Your Personal Responsibility
the feelings you can't hide
Our ignorance means collapse

Protectors of blindness anyway
I don't want to be a part of decay
Organised self defence, play the fool
Simulate, golden rules, interviews

Breeding you deception
Losing faith again
I don't see more chances
Lost Are Those Who Trust You

SOMEONE WILL BE PROUD
Prison Fall all... No one pushed out...
STOP THE WAVES OF LIES
I'll Suck Your Blood
