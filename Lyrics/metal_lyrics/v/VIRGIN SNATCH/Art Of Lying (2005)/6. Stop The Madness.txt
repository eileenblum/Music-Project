Why don't you stop the madness
Pervasive sadness
Demonstrating your resistance
Drop! Morals and orders
Embrace this disorder or die

Fools! Waiting for the prize
Forget all lies
Forsake what you believed
Change your name
Funny how we celebrate
The innocent slain

I don't believe what you say
Lies and the blame
I don't believe what you say
Unspoken name
I don't believe what you say
War and the fame
I don't believe what you say
Stop the madness, fear -- pain

No one is safe now
Everyone's broken down
I can't take it anymore
Who can stop this shit
You cant
You are not my god
Killing the worthless
You murder yourself
Our weakness is the last hope
Stop the madness
We must pull the plug

Fools! Stop waving your flag
That is an incorrect inference
Fools! Stop waving your flag
To calm and quiet the masses
Fools! Stop waving your flag
Freedom of speech exists
But why you cannot say anything

We don't believe what you say
Lies and the blame
I don't believe what you say
Unspoken name
I don't believe what you say
War and the fame
I don't believe what you say
Stop the madness, fear -- pain
