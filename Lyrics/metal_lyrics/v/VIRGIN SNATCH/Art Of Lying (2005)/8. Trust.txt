[this song is dedicated to m.m.]

Ignorance
You hear my voice and try to run
No more time
The friend you've never, never been

All I need my integrity
These are things you cannot take away
Watch you bleed your lies are crawling
Promises not kept as always -- face adversity
All the things I planned

Time to stop, to blame myself is my disgrace
Try to mend, try to grant
Why should we live within a haze

All I need my integrity
These are things you cannot take away
Watch you bleed your lies are crawling
Promises not kept as always -- face adversity

No matter what you say
No weeping, no more prayer
My life is just a fragment you and me
So helpless and withering
Your future I'm fearing
How can I trust you one more time

Wounded severely
Maybe I am blaming me
But I'm still in disbelief form what I've seen
I don't need your hand
Because all I need is one
One more reason to fail you as you failed me

No matter what you say
No weeping, no more prayer
My life is just a fragment you and me
So helpless and withering
Your future I'm fearing
How can I trust you one more time
