Show me your blind face
No one knows the nameless power
For the law a hatred born
Living in a dying age

Trans for mansions
Dance for the crowds -- burn in hell
Self creation total generosity
Screams behind the shadows
Greed betrays your neck
For your own existence
Avoid every step

Sins of my past are returning
Trans is passing over me
Can't I see it's a never-ending
Vote given to you

Further chase the prize
The ceremony's now coming
But the truth must die
Haunting past that fill your mind

Trans for mansions
Clear of charges -- take away
Invitation royal lives
Screams behind the shadows
Greed betrays your step
For your own existence
Avoid every choice

Sins of my past
Are returning
Consequences we have paid
Trans right form
The new beginning
Forget it
And you'll be free
