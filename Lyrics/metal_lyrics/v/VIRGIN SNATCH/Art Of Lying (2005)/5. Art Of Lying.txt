Fill out the questionnaire
Prepare for a quite new life
So make yourself comfortable
Let us start feeding you lies

For the bustling crowds
For the concealed dreams
What we can design for you
We have a perfect lie
Of majority
Unquestioning authority

Your new brain won't know the difference
Always the same old you
My art of lying is the business
Why would you need the truth

Ecstasy arise
Sinner without a name
We guarantee, no way back
Will be what do you want
You can see your proud
Never will the old lies return

Lies
Tell me lies
Why
Tell me why
