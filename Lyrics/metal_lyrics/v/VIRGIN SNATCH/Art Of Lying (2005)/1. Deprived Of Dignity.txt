You can't back down in misery
Like a bird in a storm still suffering
Open your mind, your memory
Say what you called taking the crown

Through out your speech
My promised land
No crime, no lies
Still purifies
Now try to bite
Now try to kill
Now I can see the destiny you deal

Let me ask you who is the highest
Ain't no difference
How can you lie conspiracy
Fighting is useless
Let me say: deprived of dignity

Find it, absorb to bride the beast
To catch, release
I don't believe
You choose the way
Laughter and tears
Where is the god you justify

Like a spark in the dark
Obscurity
Ideas, new plans
Morality
Clean hands
You dignified
Where is the god you justify

Deprived of dignity
Promise land -- for your false purity
Where is the god you justify

Let me ask you did you ever die
Ain't no difference
How can you lie celibacy
New morality
Let me say: for your false purity
