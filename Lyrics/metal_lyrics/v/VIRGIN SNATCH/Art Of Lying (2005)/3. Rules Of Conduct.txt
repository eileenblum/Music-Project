I represent you
Under the provisions
My rules define
Detailed principles of board

Keep, blow, collaborate!!!
Looking down on heads of poverty
Marching crowds in perfect lines
Telling new order -- new celebration
Supervise my performance

Deep in your tragedy
I am your remedy
Once, maybe twice
Kill yourself for my rules for conduct

Personal authorities
Offer you protection
But first on your knees prick!
Now I am your command

Obey, honor apathy!!!

How long can you live by declarations
How long can you hide the truth
Now everyone can see that you are not
What you pretend to be

Deep in your tragedy
I am your remedy
Once, maybe twice
Kill yourself for my rules for conduct
Say what I said
Give up your fears
It is my way supreme
Don't you think that you're better than me
