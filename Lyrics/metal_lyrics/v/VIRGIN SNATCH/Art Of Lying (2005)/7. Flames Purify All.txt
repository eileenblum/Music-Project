Through death my life won't be
Displayed as a deep nightmare
One day we all shall die
What do you see?
What do you see?
A pale!!!
This feeds me,
Makes me who I am
Still keeps me alive
Keep it away from the gas
What does it mean
What does it mean
Flames!!!

Flames purify all
Purify my soul
Only way to go

Born to be thrown in hell
Argumentative choice
Born to the live on the side
What's the price
What's the price
Me!!
Law bent to other needs
Believe in something, but what?
No difference, you lose control
Genocide suicide crime!!!

Lies after lies
Burning! This is my passion
Crime after crime
Daemon! Bless the accession

I don't care what you got
You give nothing for granted
You must know who I am
Concentrated hate
This feeds me, makes me who I am
Still keeps me alive
Keep it away from gas
What does it mean
What does it mean
Flames!!!
