Who is the deuce, paranoid deuce
Ominous deuce all day
All what I see -- the personal deal
I realize what they pay for
Fortune and the fame
Civil disorder
Military rules
Everybody are fool

Ominous deuce, paranoid deuce
Is what I read in the news
Aliens kill us, or was it aborigines?
Political lies you choose
All the hopes -- no promises
Wrong way -- don't believe what you see
My name -- my paranoia
Your blindness -- they having a good time

No more time for fucking sentiment

Die tyranny
Life for money
My litany -- stays a lonely way
On fire sky
Legal lies
Disaster I'm ready for...
No trust
My race has been run
You are the spy
Not funny paranoia

Who is the deuce, paranoid deuce
No more hope for me alone
Joined together, stronger than ever
Fight with me and kill the king

Your needs -- to satisfy
Kill dreams -- shattered existence
Just keep --my paranoia
Don't know -- what is truth -- what is false

Die tyranny
Life for money
My litany -- stays a lonely way
On fire sky
Legal lies
Disaster I'm ready for...
No trust
My race has been run
You are the spy
Not funny paranoia
