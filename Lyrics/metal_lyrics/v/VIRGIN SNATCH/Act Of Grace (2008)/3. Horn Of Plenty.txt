Don't want to hear about the history you are faking
It's something you can't refuse
Watching while legend dies

Another miracle: genuine horn of plenty
Never believe benefactor
All the prize
For your lies
What the fuck?
Wake up!

SO CHANT YOUR SLOGAN LOUD
AND WAVE YOUR PARTY FLAGS
ANOTHER COUNTRY TOUR
PICK UP THE SEVERAL BUCKS

Plenty of power
'Forever' is the name
All goods for us!
Profusion drivers you mad
Running through my brain
It's easy to achieve.
You play a public servant
Remember This before we vote
Of course We vote!
Memory of it fades
Abuse of competence!
Forever claim to fame

Don't want to think about
The Power You are taking
How long will You keep it
Another re-union.
Nothing has changed!

Give me more plenty words
I feel I know lust from greed
It's something I can't get rid
Take a bid
Plenty is no plague

PLENTY IN ALL OF ITS FORMS
FOR LIFE. FOR MONEY. FOR KNOWLEDGE. FOR LOVE
I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU RICH
THAT YOU CAN AFFORD EVERYTHING

One day the money's going to stop
No budget for your crap
I will wait for this day!
You say the Plenty in no plague!
