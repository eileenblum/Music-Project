Help Us ever day
For as little as just some bucks
a  day you can help
save us - abusing power
Affected living in clover
Elected by people loving mad
Securing power - play policy!

If you pay
You can say
That's the way
Money makes man*!
Existence
makes the sense
Only then to affirmative vote!
Reverence
What We said
In the name of ... blood?
Donate ALL FOR ANOTHER LYING GOD

BLESSED ARE ONLY RICH.
BRAZEN LIKE A BITCH.
GENEROUS NEW GIFT FROM US OUR BROTHERS

May change someone else's life
Wanna help? - gimmie five
Find the ways to support!
How long? Time goes by!

Greed is stronger me.
Stronger than justice
Ask me. What I need
Pure. Neverending greed!

PAY THE PENALTY
IF YOU STILL BELIEVE THE POWER OF MERCENARY COWARDS
CAN YOU DONATE ALL WHAT YOU BELIEVE?
DONATION WILL BE PROCESSED BY ME

PAY THE PENALTY
IF YOU STILL BELIEVE THE POWER OF FUCKIN' LIARS
YOU COULD BE ME IN ANOTHER LIFE
