Welcome to the bad new world
as mad as the liquid gold. yeah!
I taste the fuckin' metal every day
holding  the whiskey bottle in my hand!
Like a hawk looking for the prey.
the way to the another shot
So drink with Me
All and more
You will not see the day You saw before

So if you wake up with splitting headache
Don't say we didn't warn you!
So if you fake
addicted. convicted for whiskey

DANIEL THE JACK. GRAND JIM AND JOHNIE
TO MANY WHISKEY. SO MANY STORIES
POPULAR BRANDS - THE WAY TO SATISFY ME

Come in to the dark world where i dwell
Get carried way with red-head  taste!
Put nose as close to the Jack as you can
Let it warm up a bit - the best liquid
Like the night waiting for the day
I want to tell you We are far from base
No escape these boozer walls
Sit back. Get a drink. Enjoy We fall

FEEL THE WARMTH OF LIQUID JOY
YES. I KNOW I HAVE TO GO
SOME OLD WHISKIES TASTE LIKE FUCK
SO DANIEL ONLY. ONLY JACK!
JACK!
JUST JACK!
SHE'S GOT THE FUCKIN' JACK!

TILT THE GLASS AND WATCH IT RUN

SWALLOW NEXT JACK AND HAVE FUN
