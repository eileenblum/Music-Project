Conducted by nation's fears
over several hundred years
Two thousand eight /2009/
Still Pay the bill
I am sick of hearing this!

Election, Rejection
Painful memories we recall
Defending liberty
license to practice another war!

SACRIFICE IN THE FIGHT!
SAY WE HAVE TO STAND UP TO DIE!
WIDE-EYED LIBERALS
NOW YOU SEE. WHAT THIS ALL MEANS TO ME
RIGHT NOW!
NEED MORE TROOPS IN THE SOUTHERN PART
ALL AROUND HEAR YOUR LIES
DESERVE TO EXILE
YOU THINK WE'RE PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU?

Time to face your fucking lies
Through our blood. the beast shall rise
Compromise it's all I seek
Left to Right
Strong. Weak &amp; prick!!!

Same stories about glory
Reality is breaking loose
Devoid of emotion
Waiting for a day that never comes!

All I can remember.
Mercy in your eyes/Gesture of your claw
hidden scars
Till you come and take. all is fake
You Motherfucker!

Just keep on pretending
One way to survive
Beautiful, Powerful giant who take the fools
No need You!
