The road ahead is far away
Wasted years distance our revolution
I won't support this system anymore
Mercy is gone!
I'd lost the faith in your TV
I'd lost belief in unity
UNHOLY WAR!
THROUGH FIGHT WE GROW!

We were made to defend
The resistance does not have the sense
Our pain will never die
Stay to fight on my command!

UNHOLY WAR!
THROUGH FIGHT WE GROW!

THIS IS NOT THE GAME
RESIGN NOBILITY
PROMISES THAT YOU BREAK
A SIMPLE ACT OF GRACE

PERMANENT IGNORANCE
WHEN THE WORD IS RUNNING DOWN
SILENCE IS CONSENT
DECLARE: NO INDEPENDENCE

[1st &amp; 2nd solo: Hiro]

The road ahead is far away
But we can lead us back to stay
I need your hate and violent dreams
It's price of our liberty!
It's just another race to be run
It's just another fight to begun
NO FLAGS OF TRUCE
YOU KNOW THAT YOU'LL LOSE!
