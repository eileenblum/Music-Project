Bracing the lands
From raiding seas
Riparian treasures lost
From the oceans breeze

Supreme piracy
Routes this tempered time
The sacrifice in hand
For their tragic crimes

Shadows of despair
Ravage the waves
Galleons of deceptive front
Conquer its knaves

The summerâs night
Embedded at its will

Luring to the islands
With treasures untouched
Sandy graves risen
By deceptive clutch
