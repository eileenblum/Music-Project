All aboard the Gallion
All scoundrels, thieves and wives
They loaded on at the rise of dawn
Prepared to lose their lives

The crewmen guard the anchor
As its hoisted from the wave
The dock recedes as the Captain leads
His Voyage in deprave

"This is me scourge", the Captain roared.
In which this grand ship be waiting
With crews of sworn

YO HO HO

They rowed out bold and free
Voyages build the blood of men
To scavenge every sea

A merry life to you savage men
Who stand by freedom's right
Fueling rum to arm our drive
And raid this ship in sight
