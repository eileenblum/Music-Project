Buried in the worlds of snow and ice
Where the cold rules our lives

Sailing across the seas of mist
Into the lands of our foes
The waves of our northern shores
Rise from kingdoms bestowed

Crying winds of eternal hate
Reflect the powers of the Norse
Frostbitten storms of our time
Whisper the chants of no remorse

Rivers of pain run red
Villagers lie amongst the dead
Scorched trees light up the sky
Torched souls flicker and die

Dragons upon the boats that wait
Guard the riches and the enslaved

Sounds of a thousand cheering men
Echo through out the lands of time
The tides and the winds have changed
For the better of the mankind

Rivers of pain run red
Villagers lie amongst the dead
Scorched trees light up the sky
Torched souls flicker and die
