Walking through the halls of ancient times
Through the souls which do not exist

Gazing through the walls
Falling down to the ground
Iâm foreshadowing my own destiny

The atmosphere is spinning
My lifeâs revealing
That my life is in jeopardy

Forever lost in the halls of illusion
Slowly sinking into the sands of time
Forever lost in the halls of illusion
My tortured screams and unheard cries

Magic within the halls of despair
Generate the souls which appear
Past times slowly slip from my mind
My thoughts become those frozen in time

Remember your forgotten past
From the ages dead
In the halls of the lost
Our lives unthread

Forever lost in the halls of illusion
Slowly sinking into the sands of time
Forever lost in the halls of illusion
Our lives flash before our eyes
