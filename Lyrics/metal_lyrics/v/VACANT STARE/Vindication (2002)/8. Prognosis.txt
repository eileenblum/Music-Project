Up to now Gods been good to me 
Sad to see 
Born into a place I don't want to be 
As I grow so does disgust 
When I die its long after my trust 

With the demons on my back 
You gotta take the line, you gotta feel the slack 
Cause no ones ever perfect in this fucked up world 
You either choose to last or end up on your arse 

Well God knows that I wish for world piece 
Life deceased 
How did it ever come to this 
With nothing ventured and nothing gained 
Fuck me man it was done in vain 

Well all my life I've been fed, fed, fed, fed 
With everything my mother said, said, said, said 
So who the fuck where the fuck are we lead 
I'll tell you where, in different directions 
Oh correction 

Above all I'm alive I'm sane 
With a cross hair eye I will try to aim 

Well now there's questions that need to be answered 
Hatred passed you stupid little bastard 
Another body chucked with a hundred 
Another leader has blundered 

With all the evol in control 
You got to take the reigns you got to show them all 
Listen to the heartbeat of an unborn baby and you will see 
Just maybe 

That as a person you are totally unaffected 
By all the things that seem to get connected 
And oh fuck when everything has gone 
Some motherfucker should see that he was wrong 

Well all my life I've been fed, fed, fed, fed 
With everything my mother said, said, said, said 
So who the fuck where the fuck are we lead 
I'll tell you where, in different directions 
Oh corrections 

Above all I'm alive I'm sain 
With a cross hair eye I will try to aim 

Stupid motherfucker could have been my fucking bother 
Then I'd have to fucking love you and you'd fucking love you back 
Will you ever notice just a little grain of sugar 
Dissolve in sandy water when you should have notice sooner 

I hate you 
For all the hate 
That you fed 
That's now led 
What the fuck 
have you done 
to yourself 
GOD? 

What God? 
What God? 
What God? 
Fuck gods! 

Above all I'm alive I'm sain 
With a cross hair eye I will try to aim 
Demons come in familiar forms and tastes 
Why so sad? We're all on the same track, track, track, track
