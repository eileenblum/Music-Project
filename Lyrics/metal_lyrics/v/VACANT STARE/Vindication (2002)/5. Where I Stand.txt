Before you say things I like 
Try to read between the lines 
Cause we've fallen down 
To many times 

And now I'm leaving don't you stand in front of me 
Or where I want to be 
Where I wanna be 

Before you say 
I'd like to know where I stand 
I'm on my way 
I'd like to say my goodbyes 

Before you waste your breath 
Think back to the rest 
Cause we've fallen apart 
So many times 
You start to realize that we're not as strong as we 
Might of thought we'd be 
Might of thought we'd be 

Before you say 
I'd like to know where I stand 
I'm on my way 
I'd like to say my goodbyes 
Before you say 
This is where I stand 
I'd like to know where I stand 
This is where I stand 
I'm on my way 
This is where I stand 
And I'd like the time to say my goodbyes 

Excuse me this my life your messing with 
And I'm tired of telling you 
This is what I want to do 
And I'm asking you 
Don't stand in my way 

Before you'd stand in front of me 
Before you would stand in front of me 

Before you say 
I'd like to know where I stand 
I'm on my way 
I'd like to say my goodbyes 
Before you say 
This is where I stand 
I'd like to know where I stand 
This is where I stand 
I'm on my way 
This is where I stand 
And I'd like the time to say my goodbyes 

Excuse me please 
This is my life you're messing with 
And I'm tired of telling you 
But I guess 
You'll never understand
