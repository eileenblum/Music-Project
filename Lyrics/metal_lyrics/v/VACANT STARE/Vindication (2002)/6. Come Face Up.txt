Well you may think that this is it 
But I've got to tell it aint shit 
I haven't got nothing new to say 
But I'm gonna say it in a different way 
Cause this is a story I could dreamt 
Its not word for word but I'm gonna attempt 
To rap this bitch like I fuckin meant 
And you're all exempt 

Well you may think that this is it 
But I gotta tell you it aint shit 
My whole life I've been treated a fool 
Never understood what it was to be cool 
Cause cools for idiots and I aint that 
To change my life would be fuckin crap 
Its not for me now, so what can I do 
Its not for me 

Coming down on you 

WHAT 
Come on get up don't tread 
WHAT 
Yeah its purified hatred 
WHAT 
Come on get up it's true 
WHAT

WHAT 
Come on get up don't tread 
WHAT 
Yeah its purified hatred 
WHAT 
Come on get up it's true 
WHAT 
That we're coming down on you 

Well you may think that this is it 
But you haven't heard the half of it 
Jealousy created a lot of two faced friends 
Fucking us off, then trying to make amends 
I ain't got time for people who cause us grief 
I'm looking at those arseholes in disbelief 
So when you hear this and you know who are 
You'd better step back cause you took it to far 

Well now listen up you piece of shit 
You made me feel like I didn't fit 
There's no going back on what you've done 
Come n' face up and we'll watch you run 
Finding it hard to handle the pain 
Knowing all you did was all-insane 
And as you're sinking lower than low 
We all know 

Coming down on you 

WHAT 
Come on get up don't tread 
WHAT 
Yeah its purified hatred 
WHAT 
Come on get up it's true 
WHAT 
That we're coming down on you 
WHAT 
Come on get up don't tread 
WHAT 
Yeah its purified hatred 
WHAT 
Come on get up it's true 
WHAT 
That we're coming down on you 

Come on, come on, face up, come on, I cant fuckin wait 

Come on, Face up, Yeah, I cant fuckin wait 

What the fuck did I say to you 
You lippy little arshole gonna get it soon 
Cause I've had it right up to here 
I know you fuckin know that I can smell your fear 
I'm gonna rip your face off along with that grin 
Redemption day has come I'm gonna take your sins 
By repeatedly hitting you into submission 
Like a mother fuckin train collision 

WHAT 
Come on get up don't tread 
WHAT 
Yeah its purified hatred 
WHAT 
Come on get up it's true 
WHAT 
That we're coming down on you 
WHAT 
Come on get up don't tread 
WHAT 
Yeah its purified hatred 
WHAT 
Come on get up it's true 
WHAT 
That we're coming down on you 

I'm not a fighter 
But yeah, I'll fuckin well hit you like a heavy weight 
Cause I never wait for the ten count 
Always back in five for the next bout 
And that's right 
If you're looking for danger 
You're lucky day cause I'll fuckin rearrange yer 
By the way, this is the last bout 
Cause I'm gonna'knock you'out
