I'm at the point of no return 
I am always on the run 
This has always been a sign 
To get a little bit of save me 
Get away from me 

Wait and see what you get 
Wait and see what you get 
Wait and see what you get 
Wait and see what you get 

Trust not fear should come before that 
Look and see what you've got 

Trust not fear should come before that 
Look and see what you've got 

Will you take to save your fate 
This is all we've got lose 

Beyond the point of where I've gone 
Greater men have reached the sun 
This is not without its price 
So to get a little bit of save me 
Get away from me 

Wait and see what you get 
Wait and see what you get 
Wait and see what you get 
Wait and see what you get 

Trust not fear should come before that 
Look and see what you've got 

Trust not fear should come before that 
Look and see what you've got 

Will you take to save your fate 
This is all we've got lose 

Now 
Before you wake 

I want to use you and then abuse you 
And then we're playing round and round and? 

Trust not fear should come before that 
Look and see what you've got 

Trust not fear should come before that 
Look and see what you've got 

Will you take to save your fate 
This is all we've got loose 

Will you take to save your fate 

Will you take to save your fate 

Will you take to save your fate 
This is all we've got lose 

LOSE
