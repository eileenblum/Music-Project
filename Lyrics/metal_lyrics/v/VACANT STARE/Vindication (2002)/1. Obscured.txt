This is all that it takes 
And if I was to make you 
What would you say? 
it finally read 
We were the only two people in the room 
And couldn't hear a word you said 

You wanna tell me but you wont say 
You wanna tell me but you wont say 
You wanna feel it to see how I do 
You wanna go where you can see it too 

However you make the breaks 
I'm not even listening 
So what did you say? 
And finally said 
We were the only two people in the room 
And I couldn't hear a word you said 

You wanna tell me but you wont say 
You wanna tell me but you wont say 
You wanna feel it to see how I do 
You wanna go where you can see it too 

When you see it will you find it? 
When you see it will you find it? 

When you see it will you find it? 
Find it 
When you see it will you find it? 
Find it 
When you see it will you find it? 
Find it 
When you see it will you find it? 
Find me 

We were only two people 
When you see it will you find it? 
When you see what? 
Will you get saved from it all? 
I wanna see you saved from this world 
You see me where you want to go 
And you wanna see some respect 
Show some respect 
Tell me 

You wanna tell me but you wont say 
You wanna tell me but you wont say 
You wanna feel it to see I do 
You wanna go where you can see it too
