Now fallen to my knees 
Do you want to save me or not 
Sound made it to my head 
Screaming 

Nothing else is right to me so maybe 
We will fail to never see 
The future has an end 
And it's forever (and) ever 
With the key to see forever 
With the key to see forever 
It's all-fake then you break, then you'll go 

Reform 
Remake 
Have regret 
Recreate 

Found fallen to my knees 
Do you want to face me or not 
Bound, captured by my pleads 
I'm begging 

Nothing else is right to me so maybe 
We will fail to never see 
The future has an end 
And it's forever (and) ever 
With the key to see forever 
With the key to see forever 
It's all-fake then you'll break, then you'll go 

Reform 
Remake 
Have regret 
Recreate 

And die create 

Now fallen to my knees 
Do I have to plead? 
Do I have to plead? 
Begging on my knees 

Is this what you wanted? 
Cause this is what you got 
This is what you wished for 
So die with it 

Now fallen to my knees 
Do you have to plead? 
Begging on your knees 
Are you gonna save me? 

Forever and ever 
Nothing else is right to me 
Nothing else is right to me 

So maybe 
We will fail to see 
We will fail to never see 
The future has an end 
And it's forever (and) ever 
With the key to see forever 
With the key to see forever 
It's all-fake then you'll break, then you'll go 

Reform 
Remake 
Have regret 
Recreate 

With the key to see forever 
With the key to see forever 
It's all-fake then you'll break, then you'll go 

Die create 
Now regret 
Die create
