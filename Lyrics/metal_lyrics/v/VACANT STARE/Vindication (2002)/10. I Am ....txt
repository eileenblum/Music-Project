Wonder back to where you were at, you'll find me 
You fucking idiot what you got see 
Wasn't really me just a shadow of what I could've been 
And then multiply 
Into a ruthless, an over bad, another sad 
Then I cut myself out the way 
Of conflicting views (that were) stirring up truth 
I can't get it right 

Turning back on myself is the hardest thing 
I could have possibly done 
With the will to change I've got no one to blame and I'm telling you this is? 

Why, do we always try? 
Do we always try? 
To cover up our mistakes 
To try and be what they'd expect 

As I wonder back myself I get full of wealth 
Knowing I am right out of sight 
Feeling calmer, don't know how to use this 
Too busy trying to fucking well abuse this 
That I find myself flipping a coin 
On my personality whom I gonna join 
This is what's wrong this not strong 
I can't explain it 
So who you gonna blame it on 

Turning back on myself is the hardest thing 
I could have possibly done 
With the will to change I've got no one to blame and I'm telling you this is? 

Why, do we always try? 
Do we always try? 
To cover up our mistakes 
To try and be what they'd expect 

Find a way to find yourself 
And mind you don't fall 
I'm not sure I like what I found so 
Be careful of your height and say I'm all I am 

Cause the fact of the matter is what you see and you get 
Isn't always true for me 
I lie to the back of my teeth and your never gonna see me 
Cause I cover it up with expression 
Would you call me a fool cause I'm questioned? 
And you never gonna break this 
Cause the face who takes this space is under pressure 
Everyone shows a gesture 
By changing the mask I wear am I a lesser? 
Oh, and when I get low 
I can not stay this way why cant you see? 
Its easy to delude yourself in thinking this is who I am 

Get 
Get back 
Get 
Get back further 

Get 
Get back 
Get 
Get back further 

To cover up are mistakes 
To try and be what they'd expect 

Expect to see and find 
Expect to see and hear 
Expect to be and do 
But know one said it be easy 

But no one said it be easy 
No one said it be easy 
No one said it be easy 
No one said it be easy 

No one said it be easy 
No one said it be easy 
No one said it be easy 
No one said it be easy
