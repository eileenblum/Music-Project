If I was falling for another 
If I was falling for you now 
And if I descend without desire 
I'd say the words that break my fall 

And if I was falling somehow 
And not caught before the ground 

Cause you love it intently 
Doesn't mean that you'll get it right 
Cause you love it intently 
Doesn't mean that you'll find 

If I was lying for another 
If I was lying next to you 
And if I lost all faith in emotion 
I'd stay here till the sea arrives 

And if I was lying listless 
With this thought before I drown 

Cause you love it intently 
Doesn't mean that you'll get it right 
Cause you love it intently 
Doesn't mean that you'll fly 
Cause your fighting it cleanly 
Doesn't mean that you'll win the fight 
Cause you love it intently 
Doesn't mean that you'll win 

And if I was lying listless 
With this thought before I drown 

Cause you love it intently 
Doesn't mean that you'll get it right 
Cause you love it intently 
Doesn't mean that you'll fly 
Cause your fighting it cleanly 
Doesn't mean that you'll win the fight 
Cause you love it intently 
Doesn't mean that you'll fight 

If I was falling for another 
If I was falling for you now 
And if I was lying for another 
If I was falling for you now
