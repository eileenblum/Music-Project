In hard times we feel safe close to the sea 
And now we need to be somewhere else but here 
And I don't want to see your face again 

We're waiting here 
We're waiting here 
We wait in baited breath 
Cause everything you do seems to fall short 

With you by my side 
We're killing time now 
Sometimes it's like halving the fuse 

This night left me cold, sick with all I see 
And now we need to be somewhere else but here 
And I don't want to see your face again 

We're waiting here 
We're waiting here 
We wait in baited breath 
Cause everything you do seems to fall short 

With you by my side 
We're killing time now 
Sometimes it's like halving the fuse 

With you by my side 
We're killing time 

When will we feel freedom? 
When will I know I'm alive? 
When will we hold reason? 
Where's self-control? 
Where's are life? 

When will we feel freedom? 
When will I know I'm alive? 
Yeah, and don't you fucking lie to me 
I'll find my own way to be 

With you by my side 
We're killing time now 
Sometimes it's like halving the fuse 
Sometimes it's like halving the fuse
