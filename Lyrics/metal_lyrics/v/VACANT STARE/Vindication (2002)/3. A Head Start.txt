I see no end to my life 
When it goes will you be on the other side? 

We were close together 
To see forever 
But that's not meant to be 

I feel the end to my life 
Cant you see that its hurt that feels your loss? 

We were close together 
Then detached from each other 
If that's your choice so be it 

So here we are 
All your promises broken 
What are we searching for? 
So it's my fault I'm left hurting 
You've got a head start 

So you've got a head start 
And you left me here for dead 
We were so close 
And you hardly gave this thing a chance 
So it's my fault 
You don't need me 
Well that's what you said 

This is the end because today 

We were close together 
Detached from each other 
And this is not helping so please 

So here we are 
All your promises broken 
What are we searching for? 
So it's my fault I'm left hurting 
You've got a head start 
So here we are 
All our promise broken 
What were we searching for? 
So its no ones fault I'm left hurting 
But you've got a head start
