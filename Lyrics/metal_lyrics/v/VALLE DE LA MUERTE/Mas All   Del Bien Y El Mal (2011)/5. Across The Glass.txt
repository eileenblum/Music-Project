Light goes dimmer and you fade
I beg to care away

Donât care about what you feel
We can live now a dream
Trust in me, only in me
In my words please belive

Desire wraps the warmth of your skin
Something pulls me toward you
Wish to unravel the riddle chasing me
Dragging me strongly to the rif

I need to cross the line
I have to be inside
Pushing against across the glass

In breath I feel drowned
By black shadows weâre surrounded
Tonight is gonna be the night
Take me across the glass

You would not see thoug you try
The air traps me inside
Have to be more than close
To become one with us

Captivated by those lips
Iâve tried to feel their touch
But this is always like an endless course
Your breath is all Iâve got

Iâm going beyond the glass
Iâm starving to touch
Iâm crossing the line
Across the glass
