â¦and for my own sake
I had to cut the smile from my own face: free

Goodbye is a new hello
To all the shit you refuse to know
Every day there's a lesson
But nobody listens until they're forced to let go

So when does life begin?
Penny dropped and spent back into the debt
Dissolved in the nature that breaks down the being
(The sun that you soak in feels like a burn to me)
It's all old data in a dead machine
I will not deny what I cannot delete

Please. Re.write.me.

In this pool of time and blood,
We occupy the deep 'til' our feet hit the ground
These tears have cured the cancer of never knowing how to feel or be
Death is the answer to knowing we are temporary
I quit infinity
For as long as I stay awake,
I will not fear what the future brings:
What's now mine to take.
