("Fine" has expired)
I'm your life crashing pilot
Board the most loving defect
Guard down, enter absence:

What medicine could bring the end
To means drenched in abstinence?
I cannot accept cannot eject what I've let in
I grab the thorns and turn the world red
Blood on my hands, your tired eyes stare

You should run far from home

Every killer has their motives
I keep mine locked up in black boxes
All the keys dissolved in my gut with

The ret that you'll never see

All I feel I've ignored to keep things safe for you
Now all I fell I've explored
Now nothings safe for you

So pure
So infantile
Cut my hands clearing tears off your smile

Goodbye, now we live
