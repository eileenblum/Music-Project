"Words create lies. Pain can be trusted."

Eyes glued to the window pane
'Til the sun comes up to say
"Worry, fixate and then repeat"

Do you imagine their blood inside your head?
As far as I know they're all already dead,
Caught up in a comfortable lie
So why aren't you alive yet?

Take your own advice before you take theirs

All you wanted was something
That something is nothing
Well ain't thatâ¦ something
