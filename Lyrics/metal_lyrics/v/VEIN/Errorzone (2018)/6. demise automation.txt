Skin stitched to the bed,
Windows left wide open

Itch as I
Paralyze
Beg for "now"
All the time

Separate
"I" from "I"
Automate
My demise

I don't wanna be like this;
Staring at the cracks in the wall

Strangled by the hands of a clock
Spin
Faster
Time is up, let me go

Serotonin discontinued
Nostalgia running out
Another classic case of "got to kick this shit out"
Time is up
Let me go
I'll be waiting for the pipe dream bombs to burst

I got soul, so what (I got soul 'til it stops)
Turn the ins out
Let the bombs burst
