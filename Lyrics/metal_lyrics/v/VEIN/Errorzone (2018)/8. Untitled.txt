Free and radical
Shrapnel in the blood
20 seconds: 20 hours
Calculate my consciousness
I see my reflection in the stain of every hardwood floor
When I'm too tired to look it up

Alive by midnight, and dead by the morning star
This is all I know
Do you know who you are?

The more that I bleed, the more it takes the pain away
