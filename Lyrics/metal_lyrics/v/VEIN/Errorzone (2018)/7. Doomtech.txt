Enter umbra:
Smoke and mirrors
Lungs fill up while I look in
Get your licks up on the surface,
There's no sugar down and under
Circuitry so complex it only works itself
I caged my head in the clouds
And my feet underground

Every time I close my eyes I crash a thousand cars
And all my loved one dies
Surging with the urges to mutilate and all of the guilt of
Every unwanted thought it brings
How did it get like this?
Psychosomatic ticks keeping the feeble conscious
Stuck inside a broken stereo
No control on the dial of deathfmradio

All I've seen now I see despised
Don't you get it?
I didn't expect a thing

You sing to wage war
You sing to build this cage
Violent opera, sing me to death

How'd it get like this?
