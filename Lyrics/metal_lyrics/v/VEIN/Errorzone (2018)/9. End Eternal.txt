Numb again.
Walking between morphine walls.
(My insides match the sky) my instincts inflicts I and all
Leper to idle lives
That rinse repeat in days end sighs
Catch a chill in freeze frame life,
Burn this vessel out of time

The end:
Eternal
I breathe better in fog.
I see clearer underwater.

My end will be eternal
My insides match the sky

The more you speak the less you say
The blood we share doesn't bleed the same
Rain go away, rain go awayâ¦
Please stay,
Wash the blood away
