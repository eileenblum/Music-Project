Reclaim the land and rebuild the fallen, for the weak shall inherit the earth.
A reformation in the eyes of our mother, for we are your god and we are your shepherd.
A law and the will of mankind kept from the life (death) of those that we left behind.
We will fear this death to live our lives and we will tear down the walls of the unforgiven.
We are the forsaken, we are the damned, we are the beginning, and we are an end
To indifference in the hearts of our fathers, our sons and our spirits shall be as one.
Arise! Our light shines upon this land, for we have risen from the dead.
We are the beginning and we are the end.
