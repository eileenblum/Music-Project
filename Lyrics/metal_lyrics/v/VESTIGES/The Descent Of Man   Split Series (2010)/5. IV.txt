An era of balance in the throes of man, blessed with a mind but without conscience.
Bred to worship man, miracle, and the life beyond this life, beyond the here and now.
An answer sought but none to question; how long can we scourge this earth?
How long will we burn the land, bludgeon the living, bleed the seas, and blacken the skies?
A Holocaust worth its weight in death of those she bore and will no longer bear.
There is no question, we have brought this on ourselves.
