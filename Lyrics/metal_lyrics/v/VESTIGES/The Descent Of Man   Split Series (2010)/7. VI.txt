We have found solace in death, for the lives we have spared are gathered here today. Be free!
Rejoice! Let the earth rise, let the seas swell, and let the winds carry our ashes away.
We shed our blood, we gave our lives, we kept our promise to see another day (to breathe again).
We have found peace in the death of those we sheltered.
And we are gathered here today to never forgive.
Never forget the horrors that separated one from another.
Let the heavens turn black and the gods crumble. Be free!
Let the skies rain down and wash away our blood. Be free!
