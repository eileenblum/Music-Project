Born unto the masses; faith, a testament to mankindâs ignorance.
A fear forced upon the fearing, and one more than the other.
His will, his reason purist. His grace, his order unforgivable, inescapable.
An institution, a chain of being erected to predicate the notion of dominion over our brothers.
A farce to imprison nature, a promise to restrain free will, and a challenge to oppress the weak.
No longer responsible to the creator, but the created.
There will be hell to pay, there will be hell on earth.
