Born unto the earth; mankind, a testament to natureâs benevolence.
A life bestowed upon lives, but none more than the other.
Her will, her reason pure. Her grace, her order unforgiving.
A birthright not without precedent; let us never forsake our brother.
A law worth its weight in gold for those she bore, for those to bear.
Covenant in blood, the earth, the beast, and man but one.
Communal in life (death), the flesh, the bone, and breath or none.
Let us never forsake our brother, let us never forsake our mother.
