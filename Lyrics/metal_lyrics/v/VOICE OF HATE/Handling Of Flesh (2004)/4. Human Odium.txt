A brood of unleashed hatreds
Spawned from loins of aggression
The foul taste of bitterness has grown strong

Odium of humanity is born
The mother of war
Steel encased children shot from phallic cannon
Inferior species with superior ideas

The last vestige of life
Bloodbath in the scorched earth
Feeding ground of serial murder
Hollow remnants in which the writhing maggots dwell

The human odium surrounds us all to the core.
A filthy race of worms swarming the earth
Deepest unholyness born in the hearts of war
