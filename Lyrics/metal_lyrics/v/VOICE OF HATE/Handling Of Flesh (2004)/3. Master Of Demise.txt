Master of demise, father Of Release
Scientists invoke the end, steel chariots descend
Shaking loose it's parasite, the mankind filth

Degenerate the flesh by theory
applied sciences of death
Unleash the Corps of Doom
Insanity inside... Grows

Poison snakes surrounds a sickened body
A sarcastic laugh smiles to me.
It's the master of demise with a reptile tongue.
Crawling, slithering along the earth.
