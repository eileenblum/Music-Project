The gates are now open
Perverse winds are blowing
The hands of death undench

Releasing the air of gods
Burrowing in skin digging in flesh
Agonizing attack
Air is a maggot covered in worms

The gates are now open
Perverse winds are blowing
The hands of death undench
Stormworm

Panic is in the air
In the mouth and nose the crawl
Feeding on the membranes devoured in minutes
Skeletal remains with an empty stare
Stormworm
