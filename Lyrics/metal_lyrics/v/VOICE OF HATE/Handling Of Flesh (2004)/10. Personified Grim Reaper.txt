Gods of fear
The doomsday is coming from above
Orange punishment
Unleashing their wrath strafing the land
Bullet wounds bleeding flesh
The skies are turning color
Shadows pug late in the searing heat

Shining steel
Blinding speed descends
Shattering buildings
Collapsing rubble onto the screaming masses

Turrets swing with skeleton smiles
The reapers glance a running death
Meat meltdown, screams drowned with fire.

Phoenix shadow looming
Consumed in that final pain
A rain of bombs on desecrated earth
With scattering ants to be crushed in the inferno
Lost in that second where
The steel wings fill the skies where all hope had died
