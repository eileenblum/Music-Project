Handling meat like tattered shred
Left behind by the violence
Tossed in piles
Next to bullet shells
Mounting higher
To feed the flames

The science of war deform our flesh
To their way to dehumanization
Manipulation and oppression
The science of deaths perfection

Handling of Flesh - Plastic and leather parts.
Handling of Flesh - Internal surgery
