Envisioning the superior under strife
Feeding frenzy to lay the blame
To torture subjects in horrid ways

Survivors remain in cruel space
Carving the enemy alive
Old apocalypse speaks through the peeling
Paint and abandoned rooms
The rusted devices of hatred

Visions beyond hate
Seeing the horizon burning
The rising sun
Nails driven through flesh
Skin peeled in the burning red
