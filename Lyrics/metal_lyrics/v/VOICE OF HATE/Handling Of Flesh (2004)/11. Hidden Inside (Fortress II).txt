The stones, they shall remain
Ruins of an ancient past
Yet the screams still echo
Through time and dust

Reclaiming the throne of time
Walled in old damp stone
A skeletal face peers at me
Through a hole in space

Fortress
Hidden inside
Fortress
Among spectral shadows
Fortress
Hidden inside

Inebriated on enemy blood
What once was, shall reign
Crawling through the earth
Crepitating from the grave
