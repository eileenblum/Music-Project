Invading phosphorescent liquid
Permeating our veins
Tight controlled death
It's stage your domain

Face to face with domination
Oppressor a meeting in the dark
The words exchanged peering into insanity
Cold fingers, eyes of eyes, lock in perdition
Company at horrific territory

Secluded, outstretched arms reach from the dark
Broken words, a man ripped apart

Horror territories drenched in rain
The devil dwells in the last threshold in hell
