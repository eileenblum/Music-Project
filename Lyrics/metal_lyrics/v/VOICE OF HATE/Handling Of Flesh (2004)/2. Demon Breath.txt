Drowned in the bowels of oppression
Power growing, power seething
Microcosm fireborn steel raised by a bloody fist
Only to be slammed hard on slabs of flesh
Infernational war
Born to power, sworn to the internal lord

On the throne thorns, breathing scorpions
Spiraled serpents, Poised in history, action of hatred
