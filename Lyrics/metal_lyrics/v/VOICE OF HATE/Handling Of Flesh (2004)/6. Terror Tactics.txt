Twisting screws of pain
Slowly through steel into skull
Movement concealed in agony
Positioned, immobile

A torture grand suffering
Slowly roasted in metal casket
Stiff whitened meat
Steams... the screams... the screams
Terror tactics

A victim of mine, my prey absorbed
To serve me in death, a collection of soul

My guilt and satisfaction complete
These terrified visions
My blade is truth the only pleasure
In the shadows I lurk

A torture grand suffering
Slowly roasted in metal casket

This gift you've been given
The only truth, the only hate
To feel that truth with pain and fear
Terror Tactics
