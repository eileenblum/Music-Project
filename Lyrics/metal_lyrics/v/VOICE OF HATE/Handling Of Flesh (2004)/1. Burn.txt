Burn to the core
Brood of hatred
Writhing spawn fueled with flames of anger
Scaly arms tear at you the black embrace of anger
A thousand painful infants born penetrating flesh
Breath of bullets detonating on wet blood

The spawn being the bullet
and the vomiting reptile the weapon
Shaking puppets in the distance
touched by the hand of damnation

Pierced and destroyed by the might and will of war
Opening gates in tracer fire explosions sound the call

Bought to its knees with lead
Dehumanization through thousand munitions

Burn - Flesh is hewn
Burn - A timeless cycle in aftermath
Burn - the agony of man
Burn

Reaching with bloodied hands
At your master aggressor of dismal fate
The cannon fires detonate the sound
Of ten thousand deaths erupts like a symphony
