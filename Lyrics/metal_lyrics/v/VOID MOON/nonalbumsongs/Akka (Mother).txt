[2010 "Void Moon" demo track]Leave me now with the shadow of a dream 
A light caress that barely touched my mind 
Only a whisper yet it screamed in my ear 
Never to return but I'll never forget

The mistress of death holds you dear 
It's hard to believe but you've known her for years 
All is done and thereâs no more to say 
An unspoken promise  takes you away

Touch me once and then never again 
With the midnight air hanging upon your breath 
Wrapped in dreams and safe from the world 
In silent peace your wings unfurl

The mistress of death holds you dear 
It's hard to believe but you've known her for years 
All is done and thereâs no more to say 
An unspoken promise  takes you away

Leave me now with the shadow of a dream...
