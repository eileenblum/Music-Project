[Svensson, Gustavsson, Hedlund, Wallberg]

Why am I cursed with this vision?
To see what no one else can see
An uncanny premonition
Of the things that have to be

A bargain with the beast - a pact of arcane powers
One eye given for the gift of second sight
Yet all that we received - for the foolishness of our greed
Was the unwanted vision of the day that we must die

Why am I blessed with this vision?
The gift to know what lies ahead
But still my plans of right decisions
End in constructions of the dead

All I know - All I see
The end that lies ahead of me
Hear our woe - Hear our plea
Save us from a fate brought by our greed

The prophecy Iâve seen, Iâll live to see it fulfilled
How can I mourn the inevitable?

All that I know, all that I see
The end ahead of me
All that I show, all that I feel
The prophecyâs now real.

No one else could perceive
No one else would believe
With what I know I can no longer pretend
Another chapter ends here
My visionâs made it so clear
For now I know that this too must end

I see it now, I see it now, I see it now

Now weâre no more

Let it be known - truth lies in death
What has been shown - will now forever be
Iâve seen beyond - nothing will change
All sins atoned - as we embrace eternityâ¦
