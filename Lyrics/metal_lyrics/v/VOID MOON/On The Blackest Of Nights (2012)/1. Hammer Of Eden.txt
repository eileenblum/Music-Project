[Svensson, Gustavsson, Hedlund, Wallberg]

In a heartbeat, we all understood
At the brink of the final hour
The age of innocence gone forever
Lost in the madness of misused power

Our blissful ignorance gave us shelter
But now our downfall is evident
The lunacy we accepted as truth caused
An irreversible detriment

We are the Hammer of Eden
We are the bringers of doom
Striking the Hammer of Eden
Sealing the earth as our tomb

Stupidity far beyond belief
Only matched by our arrogance
We dug our grave in the name of progress
And killed the last of our innocence

We are the Hammer of Eden
Bringing our doom
Crushing the last voice of reason
Sealing our tomb
