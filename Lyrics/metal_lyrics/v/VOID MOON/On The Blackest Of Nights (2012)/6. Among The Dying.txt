[Svensson, Gustavsson, Hedlund, Wallberg]

The silence is deafening
The roar of life has died
Facing the emptiness
The bitter cold inside

The void is calling me...

Gripped by disgust I wake up
To this unrelenting reality
I've tasted her lips, felt her embrace
The price was my mortality

I find myself, caught in the grey
Among the dying, the dying to be dead
Breathing death, spirits decay
Among the dying

The air of youth has left me now
I feel my core is crumbling
Downed by the force of age
A mockery quite humbling

Give my condolences to
The naive lover of living
His dream is shattered, torn to shreds
The prize for the years he has given

I find myself, caught in the grey
Among the dying, the dying to be dead
Breathing death, fading away
Among the dying

Among the dying
Among the dying
Among the dying
Among the dying

This is it
There will be no more
From now on I will just await my death
