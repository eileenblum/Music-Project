[Svensson, Gustavsson, Hedlund]

Cast into the dark
Leave you hanging there
Do you know the Word?
Do you know the Abyss?

Scrutinize your heart
Do you feel or care?
Have you known the Word?
Have you felt the Abyss?

Break the shell of your mortal form
Cast your life into the void
Clarity leads through the storm
Your soul transcends while your flesh is destroyed

Branded with the mark
That will lead you there
Can you speak the Word?
Can you cross the Abyss?

Break the shell of your mortal form
Cast your life into the void
Clarity leads through the storm
Your soul transcends while your flesh is destroyed

Across the gap
Face the demon
Summoned by your fear
A faithful step
Abandon reason
Reality is near
