[Svensson, Gustavsson, Wallberg, Hedlund]

On the Blackest of Nights
The unseen stars align
Guided by darkness
The Messenger shall arrive
Called by the ancient stone
The Wisdom of the Stars
Perpetual shadows feed
The Haunter of the Dark

On the Blackest of Nights
The unseen stars align
Guided by darkness
The Messenger shall arrive
Upon the shunned church hill
The blackened walls hold sway
To keep the crystal safe
From sunlight's thwarting rays

Summoned to the talisman â a pathway from beyond
A call of shadows sent through space to form the astral bond sent
Bringing arcane knowledge to the game war-mongers play
His will be done when fools in power blow Earth's dust away

On the Blackest of Nights
The unseen stars align
Guided by darkness
The Messenger has arrived!
