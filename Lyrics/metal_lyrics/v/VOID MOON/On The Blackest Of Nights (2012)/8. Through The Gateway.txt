[Svensson, Gustavsson, Hedlund]

âEnter the darkness
Let it take you in
Mystified, by the night
Free from guilt and sinâ

So spoke the shadow of the huntress to me
As she guided me through the fields
Ancient fires and carnal desires
How could I anything but yield?

Under the full moon
By the light of stars
Live this night, live your life
As who you really are

Deny the lies of monotheistic religion
Embrace the majesty of creation
Suffer no guilt for the patriarchal burden
Grant your flesh the true Holy sensation

Passing through the gateway
Leaving all my morals behind
The demons embrace me
And greet me as one of their kind
