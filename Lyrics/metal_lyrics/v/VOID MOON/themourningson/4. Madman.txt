They call me mad, but it's not wise to do so 
To seek to turn a madman into a foe 
And I don't care, just what others may bid 
'Cause I'm the only one I have to live with

Through these shattered eyes I see 
Someone's looking back at me 
Climb aboard and join me in my world of misery

Your voice flows through me and it beckons me to burn 
To leave safe ground and never to return 
Against all gods on the wings of will we rise 
Shattering the chains of celestial lies

We wayward spirits ('re) driven onward 
Fire by fire lights the soul 
Our reason here remains yet unknown 
As does our journeyâs path and goal

Our faces shine for we know not fear or shame 
We kill our demons just by speaking their names 
Face the Paine, in this age, reason is a must 
When your sense is the only thing that you can trust
