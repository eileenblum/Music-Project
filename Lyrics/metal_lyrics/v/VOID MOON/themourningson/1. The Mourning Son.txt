Darkness falls, as Light dies 
I face the storm with open eyes

Another day is over, another night's begun 
And finding me cold sober: The Desolation

Ravaged by the spirits, demons of the low 
The sorrows and the secrets, only I can know 

Still I rise again, and I know 
The reason to go on is the will to not let go 
Still I rise again, and I know 
The reason to go on is the will to not let go

I've touched the mountain highs, and unspeakable depths below 
I've listened close inside, to hear the river flow

Still I rise again, and I know 
The reason to go on is the will to not let go 
Still I rise again, and I know 
The reason to go on is the will to not let go
