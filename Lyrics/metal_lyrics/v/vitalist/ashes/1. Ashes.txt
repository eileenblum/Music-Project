Trapped in the illusions of your mind
Caught in this painful wheel of life
You see no escape
At all you're lost and all alone

The problems that you've had
Have lead you to this fate
Where only true redemption
Can be the one who saves

Fire, your only desire
To be burned away
And from your own
Ashes be born again

Fire, your only desire
To be burned away
And from your own
Ashes be born again

And from your own ashes
Be born again

And from your own ashes
Be born again, be born again

Six feet under, you wish you were
Where the cold soil holds you still
Away from every harmful thing
In a meaningless effort some...
Six feet under, you wish you were
Where the cold soil holds you still
Away from every harmful thing
In a meaningless effort to some peace

You scratch the walls of the casket
The fire slowly consumes you
You scratch once again
It's late, there's no coming back

Coming back

Trapped in the illusions of your mind
Caught in this painful wheel of life
You see no escape
At all you're lost and all alone

Fire, your only desire
To be burned away
And from your own
Ashes be born again

Fire, your only desire
To be burned away
And from your own
Ashes be born again

Ashes be born again
Ashes be born again

Uh
