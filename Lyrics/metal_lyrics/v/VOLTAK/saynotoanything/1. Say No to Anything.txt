Was it the stairway, far too steep
Was it her blue glance of steel
That turned on a child heart's beat

Roamed around the moonlit walls
Had a sudden sense of loss
Or a sense of lust, were I in love

Say no to anything that bounds
Say no, unfold your soul
Say no to anything that bounds, unfold your soul

She replied the sun must shine
Over the sea-washed barren mounts
With the storming wind she's gone

Only once, aeons ago
Saw the idol, saw the muse
A blonde fairy of the shores

Infected with the one adored
In fact it is just me enrobed

How selfish to be stuck into my woe
How disgusting to be stuck into my woe
Woven and torn
Unbroken vow

Say no to anything that bounds
Say no, unfold your soul
Say no to anything that bounds, unfold your soul
Unfold your soul
