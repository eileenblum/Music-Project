Deepest regrets - forbidden is to fade away
Keep fillin' gaps - for speeding up my age
Deepest regrets - forbidden is to fade

I watch our towers grow
From here down they almost wrap the sky
I can't wait when they finally get done
But we know it will never ever come

The old town...
The order...

I doubt our worn-out roads
Could the battling of cracks and patches end?
I was eager to find as the unfailing runs out
As disgust bloomed out of my heart

The old town - oh it never gets done
The patience - in the lingering of time
The order - shall be only without us
Of these four I'll be the first to leave off

Deepest regrets - forbidden is to fade away
Keep fillin' gaps - for speeding up my age
Deepest regrets - forbidden is to fade

The old town...
The patience...
The order...
Of these four I'll be the first to leave off
