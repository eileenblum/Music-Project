Secret artifacts, all hail the soulside
Seen only at night time, now they meet the daylight
To bring on Blackness straight from a dreamland
Where I just returned from, they followed me back

Hide the sunbeams for a deathlike state
Retreat into oversleep

Gift is each and every day
Gift is each and every day
Awaken out from here
When childhood turns to funereally open grave
Childhood turns to funereally open grave

Secret artifacts of overflowing unreal
Representing the subconscious last will
Slumber holds my hand, slumber takes me there
In fever of zero, in fever to fulfill

Hide the sunbeams for a deathlike state
Retreat into oversleep

Gift is each and every day
Gift is each and every day
Awaken out from here

Awaken out from here
Among the passed away
Awaken out from here
Among the passed away

Gift is each and every day
Awaken out from here
Gift is each and every day
Awaken out from here
When childhood turns to funereally open grave
Childhood turns to funereally open grave
