Railway is losing, so do my dreams
A lake sends that sound from the other side
I gaze in the black, the unfolding black
Shapes flashing for my open eyes

Come and go astray
In wonders' stream

Into Stormclouds of a shaded horizon
Wasted away by Vanishing Slow
Stormclouds of a shaded horizon
Wasted away by Vanishing Slow

Sink back to silence, it's finally gone
Terrified screams of iron lines
The sleepless on seats were blinded alike
I just imagined their gliding lights

Come and go astray
In wonders' stream
Far beyond the trench
Arcane togetherness
Of Ancient Ones
Of Ancient Ones

Into Stormclouds of a shaded horizon
Wasted away by Vanishing Slow
Stormclouds of a shaded horizon
Wasted away by Vanishing Slow
Wasted away by Vanishing Slow
