To halls of knowledge we've been taken in
For learning motions of naming eternity
Bells were ringing, we've done it thru
We're all ignorant, can never get the truth

How easy to draw an Infinity Sign
But to handle, it's beyond our mind
An Infinity Sign

What we've summoned is greater than we take
Close and open symbolic spheres again
I feel the narrowness of grids I'm in
Upon command I keep straightening

How easy to draw an Infinity Sign
But to handle, it's beyond our mind
A-a-ah

Newborn things they reach me late
I've departured, still staring at that lonesome place
I turn my back against tomorrow's gates

How easy to draw an Infinity Sign
But to handle, it's beyond our mind
An Infinity Sign
It's beyond our mind
An Infinity Sign
