Oh I'm starving for a sleep sempiternal
Narcotize me in the way I mean now

And when every single turn of highway Eighty Five's
Behind my feet, on my own I arrived
To the building where I've been
It's abandoned and empty as always
in summertime. But where's the key
It's registered as usual for my stay
Opening a room, all door's the same
Majestic Place of Saturday

Oh I'm starving for a sleep sempiternal
Narcotize me in the way I mean now
Sleep sempiternal

Take the list eventually, check it over once again
Clear conscience, fragrant lilies stand in line
In perfect order, a full chamber
I won't rest in peace without
They're on the wane, a pillow calls my name
A final yawn to celebrate
Calm and still I'll be
To lay down on Nothing, oh... dreams are for the living

Sleep sempiternal
Sleep sempiternal

Oh I'm starving for a sleep sempiternal
Narcotize me in the way I mean now
Sleep sempiternal
Sleep sempiternal
