I recall the past we walked the road countless times
Now you're overgrown, for me they're the same old miles
Recall the landings, I fell on the battleground
I'm made to stand it, not to cry

Wars are over, are over now
No more aging, ever resting, my work is done
Wars are over, are over now
So abandoned in the drawer, my work is done

In the backyard I've been ordinary dead
And resurrected with new roles to play them
In the heat of their game I broke my hand
How I miss, how I miss to be on demand

Wars are over, are over now
No more aging, ever resting, my work is done
Wars are over, are over now
So abandoned in the drawer, my work is done
My fate has come

It should end here before he finds my heart
It should end here before he finds my heart
It should end here before he finds my heart
It should end here before he finds my heart

Wars are over, are over now
No more aging, ever resting, my work is done
Wars are over, are over now
So abandoned in the drawer, my work is done
