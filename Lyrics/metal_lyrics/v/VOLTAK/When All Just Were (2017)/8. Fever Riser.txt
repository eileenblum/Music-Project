Why am I going round and round?
Grant me a pond to calm it down
Shivering shudders, we meet again
Relieve the therm of thirty nine

Waving on my mind
Waving on my mind
Fever riser blanket strings are conquering me infinitely
And it seems I've lost the fight

I shut my eyes and raise in flight
A bitter fragrance welcomes the Cold
Am I really shrinking, where are my senses?
For an instance the world appears in bold

Waving on my mind
Waving on my mind
Fever riser blanket strings are conquering me infinitely

Behold the final aim
Defeat those burning flames
Mercury is towering so high
A waterfall to enter
Shall ease the heat inside
A waterfall to enter
It seems I've lost the fight

Waving on my mind
Waving on my mind
Fever riser blanket strings
It seems I've lost the fight
Waving on my mind
Waving on my mind
Fever riser blanket strings
It seems I've lost the fight
