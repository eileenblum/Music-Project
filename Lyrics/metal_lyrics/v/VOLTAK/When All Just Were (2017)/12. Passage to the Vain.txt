Behold the walls went way too cold
No one stayed, this castle's filled with pains untold
Behold the footprints of the stray
Followin' an astral sign led him to betray

Passage to the Vain

Broken out of nowhere
A mystic only one
A leader through the icefield
Shining up in the sky

When no strength left to march
It descended to make him warm
Was it a guardian angel
Or a demon born to harm?

Towards the Mist, no horizon apperars
To keep on goin', it's insane
Whereabout now? They're so far
On a Passage to the Vain

It was a tale I heard
'n after all I see
Whispering of that night
Been true, came real

Passage to the Vain
Passage to the Vain
