See that feeble shine slowly glowin' up
Cross the evening sky
Once we called it 'Home' when we walked the Earth
But I moved behind

Now it's far enough
To feel safe under a weaker Sun
Now it's far enough
To die down n' be an only one

Too much time I spent, too many bites I got
In the mouth of time
Avoid misleading turns and foresee unknown ways
I searched for hills to climb

Now it's far enough
To feel safe under a weaker Sun
Now it's far enough
To die down n' be an only one

Desolated imaginary land
Tomorrow means the incoming of Lack
Will the desert find my self alive?
Rusted plains hear the farewell prays to None
Desolated imaginary land
Tomorrow means the incoming of Lack
Will the desert find my self alive?
Rusted plains hear the farewell prays to None

Venus - a view in blur
Remains of plans held up for ever
Awake to the morning when all just were
Venus - a view in blur
Remains of plans held up for ever
Awake to the morning when all just were
