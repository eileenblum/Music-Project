To the land of frost on a drifting flake of ice
With shattered heart and seeming smiles
Can't stop the meltdown, escape on hurtling waves
Can't hold the Spring back, weeping carbon tears

'See me out' he told
Alone you shall retrace
See me out, I step on the Winterway
'See me out' he told
Alone you shall retrace
See me out, I step on the Winterway

I step on the Winterway

Don't let the searing Sun kill me drop by drop
Where to hide anymore? (anymore)
To the river, to the roaring flood
Instead of holdin' on
Vacated just as he lied at us
So proudly he's gone

'See me out' he told
Alone you shall retrace
See me out, I step on the Winterway
'See me out' he told
Alone you shall retrace
See me out, I step on the Winterway
