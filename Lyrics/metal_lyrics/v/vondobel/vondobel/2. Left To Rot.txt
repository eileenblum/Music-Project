Left To Rot!

You, will suffer, by my hand,
You will get hurt, by my will,
You will, trust in your god,
but you will be betrayed!

[Chorus:]
You'll suffer, you're hurting,
you're all within my grasp!
You're dead, you're buried,
You will be left to rot!

You'll suffer, you're hurting,
you're all within my grasp!
You're dead, you're buried,
You will be left to rot!

I, must pay, for my sins,
but, not to, your god,
i will pay, to MY gods,
and i, will be, rewarded!

[Chorus:]
You'll suffer, you're hurting,
you're all within my grasp!
You're dead, you're buried,
You will be left to rot!

You'll suffer, you're hurting,
you're all within my grasp!
You're dead, you're buried,
You will be left to rot!

now, we're both dead, and silent,
both of our debts, are now paid
and now, the end is here,
and, my job is, complete!

[Chorus:]
You'll suffer, you're hurting,
you're all within my grasp!
You're dead, you're buried,
You will be left to rot!

You'll suffer, you're hurting,
you're all within my grasp!
You're dead, you're buried,
You will be left to rot!
