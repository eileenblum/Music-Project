Was there ever a time?

Was there ever a time, everything was alright?
Was there ever a time, you weren't dead inside?
Was there ever a time, you didn't need to lie?
Will there ever be a time, everything is alright?

[Chorus:]
Time passes by...
(The ultimate battle, we're destined to lose,
Gods laughed at your plans as you hang from the noose...)

The end is always nigh...
(...And all our dreams are in vain.)

Was there ever a time, there was a light in your eyes?
Was there ever a time, you weren't cold and blind?
Was there ever a time, you believed in this life?
Will there ever be a time, everything is alright?

[Chorus:]
Time passes by...
(The ultimate battle, we're destined to lose,
Gods laughed at your plans as you hang from the noose...)
The end is always nigh...
(...And all our dreams are in vain.)

[Repeat 1st verse:]
Was there ever a time, everything was alright?
Was there ever a time, you weren't dead inside?
Was there ever a time, you didn't need to lie?
Will there ever be a time, everything is alright?

[Chorus:]
Time passes by...
(The ultimate battle, we're destined to lose,
Gods laughed at your plans as you hang from the noose...)

The end is always nigh...
(...And all our dreams are in vain.)
