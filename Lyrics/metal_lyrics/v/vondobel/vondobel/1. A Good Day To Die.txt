If the world was perfect / we wouldn't have to scream.
If there was no sorrow / we wouldn't need to dream.
But the sun doesn't shine / and the birds don't sing.
There's only the hell / we find ourselves in!

[Pre-chorus:]
Today's a new version / of the days before.
even more full of shit / and petty scorn.
to outrun the pain / there is just no way.
and if you step out of line / there'll be a hell to pay.

[Chorus:]
So light up / your hate!
Feel free / to be enraged!
Being nice / never helped / anyone / anyway!
So scream your / WARCRY!
Blame the gods / up high!
'Cause today / is a good / a good day to die!

If death wasn't certain / we wouldn't have to fear!
If life was an option / there would be no tears!
Hope is just a drug / for those weak at heart!
Refusing to see / life tears us apart!

[Pre-chorus:]
Today's a new version / of the days before.
even more full of shit / and petty scorn.
to outrun the pain / there is just no way.
and if you step out of line / there'll be a hell to pay.

[Chorus:]
So light up / your hate!
Feel free / to be enraged!
Being nice / never helped / anyone / anyway!
So scream your / WARCRY!
Blame the gods / up high!
'Cause today / is a good / a good day to die!

There's no light / at the end of the tunnel!
No redemption / in your faith!
Just another way / to end your days!
Just another hell / we find ourselves in!

[Pre-chorus:]
Today's a new version / of the days before.
even more full of shit / and petty scorn.
to outrun the pain / there is just no way.
and if you step out of line / there'll be a hell to pay.

[Chorus:]
So light up / your hate!
Feel free / to be enraged!
Being nice / never helped / anyone / anyway!
So scream your / WARCRY!
Blame the gods / up high!
'Cause today / is a good / a good day to die!
