Sharpening up the axe
Need to have it sharp and shiny
Envisioning his death
Absolute mayhem
Gonna open up this bastard
Invicerate his body
Hold him down to the ground tie him up
Anger rising
So vicious is my being
I cannot control my hatred

Rip the clothing off his body
Piece by piece I strip him naked
He's gonna suffer explosive surgery
Violently eviscerated
Body pierced with sticks
Nailed down to the ground
Head cracked open by the stone
Smashing, pounding
His face unrecognizable due to the severe beating

Cracking bones with every blow, I enjoy the slaughter
Blood is pumping
I stand and watch him spastic twitching
It makes my juices flow
I can't help but smile as I start separating skin from tissue
I'm obsessed by the thought of removing every vital organ
Leave him in a pool of blood

The ribcage now I see
Furiously I bend it open with my crowbar
The bones are shattered
I know this fucker is still breathing
Suffering my treatment
Working down in his bowels with my axe
Slice in random
This autopsy is for exposure
Soon his body holds no organs

Messy bloody pile of gore
He's empty now my work is done
He has suffered my explosive surgery
