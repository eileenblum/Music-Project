Journey towards total humiliation starts up
No warning, nothing to indicate the wicked degradation soon to be
As they deliver themselves to the land of inbreeds
Submit to hillbilly law

Stranded, separated and dislocated
From the woods approaching, two men
They grin their black tooth grins, gleam with empty staring beady eyes
Mountain men with sick one-tracked minds
Without grasp of reality
Rednecks, 12 gauge rifle, farmer outfit
Drunken by homemade whiskey

The yokels of perversion attacking
Taken by surprise they're captured
They stood no chance, taken off guard
Overpowered, unprepared
The strongest, most defensive camper tied up with a belt
Force him to a tree

Now they turn their focus to the shorter fat man
Slowly backing, trying to get away
Panic makes him tumble, fall down
Soon his screams will echo

They start to slowly move in on their target
Crawling backwards, grins expanding soon to cover their dirty faces
"Won't you give us a ride boy?"
The panic then becomes total, when he hears a voice
"Drop them pants son"

Paralyzed from the fear he is thrown to the ground
Getting set, from behind, tear his messy mud-stained panties
Give the sick command - NOW SQUEAL
"Suck with that pretty mouth of yours"

Dirty deprivation of pride, raped by the rotten Crocker
"Squeal like a pig"
Captured, degraded and sodomized
Submit to perverse treatment
