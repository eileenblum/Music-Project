Mountains of bodies entangled, endless, entwined in barbed wire
Deep cuts in their flesh, ruthless, gruesome obliteration
Bodies of the women lay naked, spreading legs from violent rape
From pain deformed expressions on their faces
Robbed of life still screaming loud

Remnant of a mass extinction, deprivation of life
Erased to breed a new existence, brought forth by a lust for purity
Vile stench of death fills the air, the bodies start to decompose
Maggots dwell on rotting flesh, deterioration spreads a stench
Stings the eye, regurgitate the gut, suffocate, repulsive scenery

Remnants of deprivation, bleeding faces
Staring empty over land of mass destruction
Heaping for air, gasp their last breath to the sound of pitiful crying
Death, is all around, limbs torn violent, from bodies, still moving, still breathing

Clinging to life, disfigured, choke on their own blood
The last few survivors, soon to rot, all will be gone, extinction
They're the last of the human race

Mountains of bodies entangled, endless, entwined in barbed wire
Deep cuts in their flesh, ruthless, gruesome obliteration
Bodies of the women lay naked, spreading legs from violent rape
From pain deformed expressions on their faces
Robbed of life still screaming loud
