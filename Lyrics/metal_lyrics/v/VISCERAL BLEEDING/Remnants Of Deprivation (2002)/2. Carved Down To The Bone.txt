Smashed up face, cracked bones, broken skull
Carving deep into his body, digging for his dirty soul
Through the tissue, slicing, hacking, vicious way to meet my goal
Screaming out in agony, need the pleasure of his torture

Impose this empty, naked feeling, purge my from my core
Tiny piece of meat, carve from him
Open up his bowel, sick amount of gore poured out
Soaking my clothes, my face coloured red

My intentions for this carcass is to stimulate my desire
Carve..slice, bring myself to absolute sickness
Smear myself with his blood, frenetic stabbing slicing and dicing
Carve down to the bone, see how far I can push myself

Violate and butcher, carving in my signature
Hang his body up on meat hooks, let the metal pierce his skin
Cut him up, obsessed by the cruelty, the cruelty that has filled my being
Sweet taste of brutality, lurking in the shadows I am

Patiently awating victim
To mutilate
Leaving a trail of ill-treated bodies
Shallow graves with corpses that are carved down to the bone

Carving deep into his body, a frenzy of self-hate exposed
Through the tissue, slicing hacking
Through the meat down to the bone
