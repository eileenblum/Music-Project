All the victims I have mutilated have left their mark
Stained my mind 
Left their voices in my head
Always forcing me 
To murder 
Screaming louder haunting my thoughts 
In a lame attempt to rid out my mind I grab my tool squeeze it firm and hard
To let others feel my despair 
They'll experience my pain 
Smashing 
Crushing pounding in my fucking forehead until 
It's sore 
Hate, I feel my anger rising fast and hard 
My only way out now is to open my head and let them out
Control I'm losing step-by-step 
Panic attacks must let them out
Out of my mind

Fumbling 
Reaching grabbing to get 
Something that is sharp 
Enough to purge get rid of them 
Something that will make me 
Free

First thing I get hold of is a massive rusty old fucked up drill 
Big enough to do the job
Voices calling louder 

Makes me fall down have to do it now 
Get it over with
Put it to the head 
Take a deep breath 
Here we go 
Starting out kind of slow 
But the pain will fuel 
Let them out

All the victims I have mutilated have left their mark 
Stained my mind 
Left their voices in my head 
Screaming louder

Faster harder deeper blood comes 
From the hole in my head 
Along with the voices
They are filling the room screaming 
Louder than before just like a high-pitched siren 
I was not purged from them 
I set them free 
Did not get rid of them 
They scream
Louder than ever before
