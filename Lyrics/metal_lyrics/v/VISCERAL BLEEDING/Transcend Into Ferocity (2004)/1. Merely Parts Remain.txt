Total panic spreads among them
I have passed my judgement
Mandatory sentence
They will see my ruthless purpose

Now that they are all gathered here like a flock

I will carry out my ruling

Hatchet wielding aimed at target
Launched to mutilate
Separate from torso
The limbs are torn of violent
Everyone in this crowd will pay
I have felt this rage before this hatred
Clouds my mind controls my actions

Gruesome verdict- One by one I'll kill these fuckers
Mutilation- Hacking slashing with my weapon
Violent frenzy- Cutting tissue with my tool
Entrails poured out open bowel wound 
Cranium it cracks wide open
See her head split- Ram the axe right through this woman
Hear the loud crack- As the weapon penetrates her
Keep on striking- Until the spine is cracked in half

People scream in terror clawing at the doors but they won't open 
Try to duck avoid the tool of torment cutting ripping savagely at their flesh killing maiming

Not a single one will exit 
No escape from my wrath

No chance to survive this
They will see my ruthless purpose
Raging frenzy berserk fury my carnage
I will chop their futile bodies
Fingers hands and arms are flying
Working my way through them
Slaying all around me 
Savagely remove this cunt's grin
To good looking for her own good bastard whore
My knife will remove her beauty

Gruesome verdict- One by one I'll kill these fuckers
Mutilation- Hacking stabbing with my weapon

Violent frenzy- Cutting tissue with my tool
Entrails poured out open bowel wound

I stop for a second to breathe to take little pause 
When I realize, there's no one left for me to slay
Everyone in this room is hacked to pieces
The sentence carried out, a fatal verdict

People scream in terror clawing at the doors but they won't open
Try to duck avoid the tool of torment cutting ripping savagely at their flesh killing maiming.
