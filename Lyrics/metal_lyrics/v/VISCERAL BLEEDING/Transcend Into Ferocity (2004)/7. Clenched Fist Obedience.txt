Time is at hand to let you know how the punishment will feel
It is going to be severe
Your face will no longer be your own I will smash it to the ground
When I'm done you will obey

Raise my hand and clench into a fist to let it strike your face
Ruthless
Relentless
Brutal
Turn your face
Just a bit
Just to get 
A perfect view

Let my fist fall hard and clean I can feel it landing
I feel supreme
Start to
Gristle
With my
Teeth
Once again
I raise
My hand
Hear the bones crush,
Keep on
Striking
Hard

Scream out loud from the pain
Motherfucker is vomiting blood
Quiet moaning
Disturbing sounds
I want this to be done with style
I want to show this fucker the meaning of powerful suffering

I can see a little spot on the jaw I just punched in
That I 
Must have
Missed
Intolerable
Inexcusable
Rapid massive angry
I correct 
My Mistake

What I feel
Can be described
As pride
My work is done
I stand aside
I have not left
A single spot
Unmarked
What used to be
A pretty face
Is now
All fucked up
Messy as hell

To finalize this degradation 
Piss starts pouring
On his wounds

Time is at hand to let you know how the punishment will feel
It's going to be severe
Your face will no longer be your own
When I'm done
You will obey
