Nervous twitching, panic rising, heart is pounding, hard to breathe
Running, fleeing, there's no way, to overpower these mad beasts
Feel them gaining, getting closer, soon they'll have my scent
Turn, run another way 
Sudden moves, sudden spin, have to make them go the other way
Make them loose my scent, predators, running, hunting me 
Wants my blood, want to sink, their razor-sharp teeth into me
Craving blood imagening, teeth in me
As I turn, I scratch my arm, blood from the wound will fuel their rage
Eyes are burning, from the sweat, running down my white pale face, 
In the corner of my eye, I see them, they have run me down

Gnawing, chewing, tearing ripping flesh 
Their grizzly wrath unleashed upon me
I'm ripped to pieces
Stare, with their blood shot eyes, ready look, empty gaze, only driven, by their lust for blood

Hear aweful crunching sounds, as their jaws sink down hard, crushing my bones, tissues gets revealed.

Gnawing at my face, chewing at my arms
I can feel the flesh give in to them, to their grizzly wrath.

Eaten by these predators, 
I'll be a pile of bones, 
Nothing can stop these furious flesh craving bastards
Disgusting mix of blood and drool 
Smearing on my face 
Filling up my mouth, makes me sick

Empty staring blood shot eyes
Running, fleeing, there's no way to overpower, these mad beasts 
Feel them gaining, getting closer, soon they'll have my scent
