Exposing frenzy of self hatred sickened by, pure disgust 
My raging inner haunting me, torment, 
The voices speaking clearly, chanting, telling me to end this life 
Disfigure this abomination
Deform this shell of abstract, repulsive living

Inspect the tool of choice 

For mayhem eyeing up and down 
The razor blade...

Lift my hand to use the blade to spoil this face, vandalize 
Rip and cut and mutilate, I will damage, leave no trace 
Of this hideous appearance
Feel the razor, the cold steel on my skin, close my eyes, start to smile, 
It'll soon be gone
Staggering the hate's evolving, transform into scorn, despise
Feel it coming now, all the bottled up hate, this will soon be done, release my hate

Let the razor taste my body, go deep 
Blade descending through the tissue, scratch bone, blood is pouring out
Pierce my skin, hacking stabbing, slice my face up, furious rampage 
Slice my tongue, cut my lips off, indulging in self-mutilation

Feeling dizzy now, from the massive bloodloss, this will soon be done, my hate released
Razor has tasted my skin, gone deep, blade now has descent, scratched bone, blood has been poured out. 
On my chin the bone is totally exposed now, colored red 

Time to separate the nose, now the blood is pissing out
The blade is separating tissue from my face, on my command 

My appearance 
Finally complete
