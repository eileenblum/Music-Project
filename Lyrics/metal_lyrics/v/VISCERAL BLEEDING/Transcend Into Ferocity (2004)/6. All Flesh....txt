Sick need builds in me
Craving the taste of blood
Urge to eat the flesh
Craving the taste...

I killed her by strangulation
She struggled
Her nails pierced my half rotten skin
Savagely

The victims chosen by me is chosen without standards
Lusting for the killing
Hunger for the mutilation

Following to spot and recognize the weak among them
Yearning
Longing 
Craving
Thirsting
Waiting for the moment

Strangulate
Eradicate
Her body naked
Stripped
Uncovered

Reveal
Reaching out for my axe
Work my way down
Separate an arm
Disconnect a leg

Scutinize the flesh
Starting to feel
The greed
All flesh must be eaten

Hang the parts up on meat hooks
The blood drips
Masturbating
Spray my cum
On her corpse
Sick need builds up in me
Craving the taste of blood
Urge to eat the flesh
Craving the taste...

Sweep the body with my tongue I drool as I imagine eat it
Cock is hard inside my hand I smell the corpse as I squeeze it

Choose a part
Where to begin my meal
Cut out
Innards
Swallow it raw and cold
I cum again
As I taste
More of 
The salty flesh

Greedy I grab for more
I stuff my mouth

Strangulate
Eradicate
Her body naked
Stripped 
Uncovered
Reveal 
Reaching out for my axe
Work my way down
Separate an arm
Disconnect a leg
Scrutinize the flesh
Starting to feel the greed
All the flesh...
Must be eaten
