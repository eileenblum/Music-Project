Gasoline is dripped to smear the blood
To stop coagulation
In the wound cause
 d by my hammer
To penalize severe deception
Conscious still
But a neutralized threat
Pleading begging for a swift end
For the mercy of salvation

Blood and petrol dripping
Soaking
Saturated drench in the mix
Poor some more

Dripping from the face down his chest reaching out to get the lighter ignite the flame

Fire burning slowly first then rapidly developing towards a frenzy raging burning flames consuming everything
First the torso instigated

Then the arms and crouch are burning screams of terror shrikes of pure pain moaning squealing

The roaring sound of fire raging mixed with human screams arouses me air is filled with sour smell of hair
Skin and flesh consumed by the flame

Lame attempts to shield the face result in exposed neck and torso
Flesh melt blood boils tissue disolve
Working its way up to the neck to spoil and misshape his appearance
Eyes turn as they start to liquify
Dripping down the chin combined with flesh
Blood and fuel

Stinging feeling burning
Loud screaming

Fuel the flame 
Add gasoline to the blaze
Blood boils
Starts to seep through the flesh

The body now has
Stopped its squirming
He is silent
No more deceit
Burned beyond all recognition
The fire took his face his features
The only thing that's left of him is the burned out skull

Air is filled with sour smell of hair
Skin and flesh consumed by the flame
