Time to free my mind fury unleashed...

Been locked up two thirds of my life for reasons way to extreme to disclose

And now being released this can't be right, I'm not too well
Morbid acceleration fuels my senses against my will
I can't believe I'm out from my only home were I've been retrieving a clear and healthy mentality without succes

I wrap my head in dirty bandages, world can't see my deformed mug
I pick by random motives
The first I beat so bad but won't let her pass out
I watch, she's blind with blue and swollen eyes
I stare, observe as she crawls for the door, 
Her bumping into things arouse my twisted mind and makes me laugh...
Then crushing her skull... Fury unleashed

I'm eager to find another one a male this time would be more challenge
Lure him with me to a deserted playground, time to play
As he turns his back on me I rock the swing and let it smash the back of his head
He falls helpless dizzy as I take out my blunt pocketknife
Turning- Flip him over grabbing his mouth hold it open
Stabbing- Stick it in and stab his
  palate multiple times
Screaming- I slice the tongue in two and watch the pieces playing
Leave him bleeding...

Morbid acceleration fuels my senses against my will
I can't believe I'm out from my only home were I've been retrieving a clear and healthy mentality without succes

I will make myself the last victim for I feel I have earned that privilege
Time for pain so I'll use help from broken engine parts
Sharp rusty iron I scrape, all over my body and watch the blood cover me
The pain is so rewarding but it doesn't seem to kill me

Carving - Scraping - Screaming - I lie bleeding...

Time, to free myself before I leave this earth
I grab, my knife and then get down to work
I puncture my body with several holes
The taste of blood in my mouth as I die brings me to smile

Dead at last I am
