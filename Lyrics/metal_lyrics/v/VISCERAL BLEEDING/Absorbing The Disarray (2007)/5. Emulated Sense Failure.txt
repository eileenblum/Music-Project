All covered in blood, heart is still beating fast, shivering from the arousal
Take a step back to admire the work, laughing in hysterical madness

The body's twitching still, recently deceased
This emotion is superior, exceeding all I've ever felt
Temporarily, but soon comes to a halt
The twitching decreases, quick diminishment, and soon comes to a stop

My previous excitement and satisfaction
Disappears entirely, gets washed away
Total panic is rising inside me
A swift encounter with my illness

The body lies in a pool of it's own blood
Bleeding has come to a stop now
All senses numb, I'm feeling utter apathy
as I'm inspecting the body

The truth of my survival, even though not spoken loud
Must lie within the acts of death, proceed to set me free
I must pursue what seems to be the only logical step

Look into the dead empty eyes, staring into nothingness
The expression on his face is fixed, tormented grin
His hands are tightly closed, the knuckles colored white
All the limbs are stiff, rigor mortis has set in

The body lies in a pool of it's own blood,
bleeding has come to a stop now
All senses numb, I'm feeling utter apathy,
as I'm inspecting the body

The truth of my survival, even though not spoken loud
Must lie within the acts of death, proceed to set me free
I must pursue what seems to be the only logical step
