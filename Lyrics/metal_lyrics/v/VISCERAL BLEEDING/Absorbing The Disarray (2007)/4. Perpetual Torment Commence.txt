Rushing adrenaline tearing through my body,
clearing every doubt
Absurd amount of rage is soon to be released,
my own perfection seems so clear

What once was embryonic now forthcoming rapidly
What once was small now mounting, swiftly rising in my soul
What once was trapped and hidden has been gathered and built up
What once was shapeless, abstract, now forming, soon defined

Hatred rise
as I launch into attack
Fuels my mind
mounted wrath unfold
Causing pain
infecting my unclean mind
Go berserk
to rid this sensation

My head hurts so bad, sends flashes before my eyes
My goal seems so clear, have to project my hate

Victim captured, beaten, succumb to my goal bizarre
Fury that was pending, now has been released
Every bone is broken, perversion now sets in
Perpetual torment commence

Rejecting all this unfulfilled life
Feeble one, by weakness tainted mind
Start to bleed tour innocence all over me
Blade moves quick across the face and neck

What once was embryonic now forthcoming rapidly
What once was small now mounting, swiftly rising in my soul
What once was trapped and hidden has been gathered and built up
What once was shapeless, abstract, now forming, soon defined

Victim bound, gagged, tortured, succumb to my goal bizarre
Severely battered body, helpless at my will
Desperate cries for mercy, only fuels my rage
Perpetual torment commence

Bleed for me

Rushing adrenaline tore through my body,
has cleared every doubt,
absurd amount of rage has now been released
My own perfection, almost complete
