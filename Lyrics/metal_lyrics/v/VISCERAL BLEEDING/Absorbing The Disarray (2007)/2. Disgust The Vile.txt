Existential thoughts swirling through a wicked mind
Who, where, why am I? Can't grasp my surroundings
What is this place? A figment of my imagination
or the place where my body dwells

No feelings left behind this skin
Aching for my obsession
Try to fight it off but in vain
Why?

Can't get rid of this disease, a shell am I
No compassion or sympathy
Try to feel but no success, fall deeper inside
Inside where nothing soon exists

I must disgust the vile
to make myself feel alive

No reason found for this atrocious life
Bent out of shape
twisted to fit it's own reflection

Disconnected from this world, a plague am I
A carnivore to be set free
Thrive in all things that are wicked, foul are my ways
Hide in the shadows of sanity

Flashes of torture awake my pulse, my breath, my being
Ferocious will to end all life
Everywhere I look I see prey
My instincts and senses peak
Try to repress but it's futile
They will see my endless wrath
vomit from the taste of my sickness
Return to their origin they shall
die!

I must disgust the vile
to make myself feel alive
I'm an obscene anomaly
the bile of all combined

Degrading thoughts swirling through a determined mind
What will I become?
Understanding my surroundings

No feelings left behind this skin
Aching for my obsession
they will see my endless wrath
Die!
