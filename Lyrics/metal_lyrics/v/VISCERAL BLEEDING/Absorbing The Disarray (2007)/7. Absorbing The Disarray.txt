Return exhausted to the furthest corners of existence
Contemplating the actions executed
Still no reaction, no mental spark
Nothing ignites, nothing triggers the soul

The only awakening drug is mayhem and chaos
I reek of indifference
Disillusioned by my perception
There's no way back
Spiralling down this horrid path with no return
Absorbing the disarray
Morbid attraction consumes my sanity
as I'm feeding off the frenzy

Red is all I see, black is all I feel
Dreams and thoughts turn against me
They seek the devastation of my mind
to free themselves

The ignorance possessed by me gnaws at my humanity
Oblivious to this fact, hatred plants it's seed in me
Inside I'm rotting, I'm slowly disappearing
as my madness is spreading like ripples on water

Everlasting inner battle between sane and insane
Co-existence is not an option
The eradication of one kills the other
They churn and grind at eachother
Causing lethal friction to close prey
The rotten core of my inner self
Screams and spits at all living matter
Contradicts my own being

Absorbing the disarray

Gone seems all hope of recovery
I'm engulfed in a vile mental world
