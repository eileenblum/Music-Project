Entangled in hysteria and deceiving thoughts
Mind's lost control, seeking bliss
Urging for salvation through rage
Occupied with self reduction, deny the body control
Naked, not confined, steady gaze, endless seeking

Violent dreams of atrocity
images of bloodsoaked grounds
Perverted thoughts of twisted ways
Bring pain unto others
give onto them what they deserve
Feeble ones that lack the meaning, their only purpose is to prance

Aggravated by the fact that mind and body can't work as one
Body rejoice when the mind is drawn into an endless battle
Recollections, shapeless memories, penetrating and deforming
Twisted visions, bringing back the rising awareness, mind is conscious

They're pitiful and ignorant, their whole existence makes me sick
A soulless pile of wasted flesh, makes me spasm and grizzle teeth
Their infected souls make me spew, they're sending shivers down my spine
Enslave them all and bring them down
This is my time, now I will rise

Overwhelmed by abhorrence, taking over, growing stronger
Shocks the mind, despise all living

Confront the fear to fill the void
Regain control of the body that had been disconnected

Repressed needs deep inside, I set my vice free
Darkness shapes me, possessed by unholy ones
Violent dreams of atrocity, images of bloodsoaked grounds
Perverted thoughts of twisted ways
Bring pain unto others, give onto them what they deserve
Feeble ones that lack the meaning,
their only purpose is to prance

Astounded by the amazing power of an instinct to slay
Obliterate, annihilate, exterminate, eliminate
Without control, extreme torment will be brought to this depraved race
To kill, to wound, to mutilate. I'm born again, the demons are set free

They're pitiful and ignorant, their whole existence makes me sick
A soulless pile of wasted flesh, makes me spasm and grizzle teeth
Their infected souls make me spew, they're sending shivers down my spine
Enslave them all and bring them down
This is my time, now I will rise
