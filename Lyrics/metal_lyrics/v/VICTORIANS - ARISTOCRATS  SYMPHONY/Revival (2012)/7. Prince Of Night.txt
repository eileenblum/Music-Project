Silver moon's up in the sky as
Pulsing blood within your vain
See reflection in your eyes
Of my lust, hunger and pain

Rising from death's veil
In night i'm reborn
But you still don't fit to my tale
No hope for this vain world

But at night
You sing to me your dark melody
Cause my eyes
Shine in the starless night

Take my hand
Lead me through the gate of night
Through scarlet lips
To immortal life

Light is gone
I feel the cold of my pale skin
One last breath
No daylight, i'm reborn
