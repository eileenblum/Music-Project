Betrayed by my love
I pray to the moon
In cage like silver dove
With sentence i can't impugn

Why for the sake of the gods
You sacrifice this love
Look in to my eyes
Than look into your soul

You can imprison me forever
Show my beauty to the kings
But for sick &amp; deviant leisure
Don't let them cut my wings

Together we could
Make passion out of tears
Obsession out of love
Desire out of fears

Now my tears turn into pearls
Fears bind me tight
Feathers tear out earls
Wings cut in the frightening rite

"But i will live long after you die
Mother night will return me my wings
If you see the spark of my eye
It will mean that my journey begins!"

I will fly to th end of the night
i will sail to the end of the sea
I will live to the end of time
I will fight if you try to stop me!
