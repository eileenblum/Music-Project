So deeply
Among the waves
Among ship wrecks
hear a song so beautiful
So powerful

She is a damn
Deep in the waves
Lonely and angry
Destroy their selves
Seduces you
With the power of her voice
Throws you into chaos
you have no choice

Song weaves itself
She takes your wits
Song weaves itself
She takes your wits

She is a star
A light in the dark
She gives me strenght
To conquer the death
Deep in her arms
I find my true self
The power of the dreams
Becomes so real
