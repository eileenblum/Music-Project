I run away from golden gods
And from my lover, his fiery lips
To shadow fortress, to my home
To warn my people and save my own

In the shadow valley
A new dawn is rising again
And you with your army
Stand already at my gate

My people sleep in crypts
Blind among the walls of stone
Cannot see, cannot hear
Pulse of your sweetest blood

Sword of flash and falme
Turn the dark world into dust
Please hurry up my love
cause you cannot stop the time

Horizon cuts the sunbeam
Last ray of hope
Hear the dreadful silence
From the underworld

Shadows rise
Legio Mihi Nomen
Silver child
Rise against the sun
So it came, so it came
The day of the moon
We don't need
Sunlight to shine

Justice is blind
In panic you swing your sword
I tried to save you
When you cut my mortal throat

Rise from your knees
Children of the stars
Take your shields and swords
When the night will come
Revenge they will taste
Show no mercy
Legio Mihi Nomen

Spark of passing life
Unseen by human eyes
Dies on barren land
In blood in dust in tears

Open eyes undead
Moon is spreading silver beams
My will in your head
Cause the name of Will is Me!
