One way leads to the edge
And the creation act
Your hands all in the blood
When great conjuration comes
Secret passions within
Shaping my body so pale
No rest no escape
From the insanity of arts

My dearest servants of beauty
Follow me, follow me
Who doesn't stand under my feet
I ask you, I ask!

How dare you walk in front of me?
How dare you speak instead of me?
Only i can lead you through
The maze of the time

Fading colours of dreams
Reflect what must be lost
Behind the mirage of time
There's glory what i live for
My flourishing soul defines
The greatest work of art
Paint me with your blood
Never, never stop!
