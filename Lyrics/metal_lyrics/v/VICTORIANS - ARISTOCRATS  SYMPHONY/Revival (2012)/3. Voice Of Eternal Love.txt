Now i know
Faithfully who i've become
Living strongly through
Centuries of ages
I can be the reason to die for
Days go by
But i am still the same
In the river of time
For you, only for you
I am the gift for the heart

I am the voice of immortal blood
Of eternal love
Keeper of your memories
Heart of all mysteries

Here i am
i never look behind
My voice will lead you
To heart of forgotten time
Where's love stronger than death
I will live young after you`ll die
Unless you find the key
To my labyrinthine eyes
incarnation of the art

Me eyes have seen
What mustn't be forgotten
What mustn't be untold
I am the voice of immortal blood

Walking alone the path of immortality
Will you come with me to glory?
A man can do anything to a man
I don't want to be a human again
