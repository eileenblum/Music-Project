Together and alone
In crowded cities
On the desert of the world
Show me your love
Please be my pearl
Of forgotten light
Body too young for pleasure
Eyes older than time

In the end
There'll be no sorrow
Only pleasure and relief
Love me now
Because tomorrow
I will turn into the dust of a dream

Together but alone
In every hour of live
Indifferent to pain of time
I'm just a doll
With millennial heart
I will never turn into a butterfly

Oh! I must learn
Again and again how to see
My reflection
On the surface of time
Ain't need your blood
But eyes, your sight
Look at me
Can you see the woman in me?
