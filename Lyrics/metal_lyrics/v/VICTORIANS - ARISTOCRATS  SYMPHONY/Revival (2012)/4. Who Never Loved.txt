You're leaving
Without the gift of eternity
I'll forget, forget you
Cuddled in velvet darkness

In his eyes despair
Through his voice the silence speaks
And his heart so empty
Downfall in his mind
Hard as a stone
In the flow of ancient river
I stand like adamant
And cold as an ice
I clash my chest
With the rapid stream
turn it around
With might of my will

You're gone
Gave away your wings
Running, fleeing from night
So let the sun devour You!

Shadows over my valley
Twitter melodies about you
He set offa journey with hope
Before the dusk came
He died
