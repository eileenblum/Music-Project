I'm the goddes who will rise
To fulfill my destiny
If you pay your dreams as price
I will open your blind eyes

Furthest scream of lonely heart
In the darkest corner of the world
For the one who was unborn
Who dreamed instead of tasting life

Net of life cut by fear
Mighty arm will crush your bones
Neither shield nor sword to bear
The truth from the unholy books

Why are you hiding
You are uncertain of your name
Your power must fail
Your pride must fall

I'm the goddes who will rise
To fulfill my destiny
If you pay your dreams as price
I will open your blind eyes

Your heart hits low
Unless you call my name
