For the one
For the one
We shall stand
For the one

Beyond time, beyond stars
Beast exists with no light
Endlessly evoking
The echo of forgotten times

For the one who was forgotten
One drop of blood
For the one who forgot me
None of my tears
There's no hope, no forgiveness
If you do not trick the death
One life stays, one is passing
Take care of your every breath

I'm the one
Who's blessed by death
I'm the beast with no regret
What i feel is what you fear
Say a wish and i'll be here

Where you sit, where you stand
Life will be your grave
Death to protect my words
More precious than your life

My lips, my arms
For the one that i deeply care
Goblet of my blood
For the last vampire's lair
