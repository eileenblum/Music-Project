Betrayal. Exiled the oldest son. The younger an emissary of Jealous. Madness. Hate. A shattering mind. Broken the wings of a beloved one. A bleeding wound. Wolves behind your back.

Run!

[Verse 1]
Hey, fool! I'm sick of you!
Don't fool around under my rule
My men just told me you killed my wolf
Non excuse is good for you
My daughter has a crush on you
I don't wanna see her coming to you
So leave this place filthy worthless pig
Unless you are ready to die!

You are ... man in exile [2x]

[Chorus]
Fear of the pain
Reign my days
The nights are so cold
When I'm alone

Over the hills, under the moon
I ran away from their wolves
The howling wind drives me from my roots
Over the hills, under the moon
I ran away from their wolves
They can smell me for my leaking wounds

Run!

[Verse II]
So now I left my home
Cowardice drove me from my love
Curse upon those fucking morons!
I haven't done anything wrong
My younger brother wants the throne
He set up a trap to have my head
One day I'll come back
To take what is rightfully mine!

[Interlude]

You know there are days so bright
Days when I feel fine
And like now I just wanna dance...

[Verse III]
Evening my brother
Did I scare thou?
I am now here
To let you go.

I will cut you open and I let your guts to rot.
I will rape your woman and feed her womb to goat!
Children are not yours, they are from next door.
Nightmare isn't over while you bleat "no more!"

Die, die poor fool! I've returned to home
Fear my wrath rotten puny half-baked
Worm!
And so my dream goes on...

I am... man in exile!

[Chorus]
