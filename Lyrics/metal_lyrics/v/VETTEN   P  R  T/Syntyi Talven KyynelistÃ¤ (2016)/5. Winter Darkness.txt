The wind grows stronger. The cold tightens it's grip. Too deep they have wandered. Frigid coldness. Despair. Death. The wind carries the bitter words of wrath.

JÃ¤Ã¤!

[Verse I]
A cold winter night
Ominous silence
A timeless land
Hides all of my power
A flaming heart
Keeps us moving
When the death reaches us
We'll fight!

Snowstorm
Hides guiding stars
Despair locking hearts
Men began to fall
On the white floor
Shadows are dancing
Sapphire eyes
Touching our lives

[Interlude]

We have marched so long with anger and fear
We are cold and hungry. There's no light except moon
Relentless howling wind speaks with a language
That we don't understand

He promised to us glory with threat of his prison
This land is the prison, which leads to death
The proud fool warlord sent us here to conquer this ice kingdom

But we have found nothing but snow, ice and enchanting silence
He will beg a mercy from us if we return
I know they are here. They have surrounded us
They are spirits of Kamos of eternal night
I shout: "Reveal yourselves, I do not fear
Death!"

You mortal fools. Leave our frozen kingdom
How dare you invade this landâ¦

Now their minds are obsessed by the cold
Their hearts are burned by frost
And deathly pale skins are covered by snow
Eyes are eclipsed

JÃ¤Ã¤!
