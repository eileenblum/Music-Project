A funeral. The lost might of a winter past. Guardian of balance. Carefree summer is fading away. Birds are gone. The spirits awaken. New era has begun. The father tree has died.

[Verse I]
Wandering through the elders' lands to the north
At first glance ahead a wooden sea
Many would be scared to leave their homes for this
I cannot go back, woods are calling me

[Verse II]
Gloomy is the hall under highest trees
Prolonged shadows obscure all over the forest
Birds don't sing, maybe perished for an unknown mean?
Happiness and life are replaced by wooden grief

[Verse III]
Glimmering streams, unknown maiden's heal
There I shall come to the heart where all began
Water gurgles under roots of the father tree
Death has arrived, the lone greatness is dying
