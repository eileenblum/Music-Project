Winter's thunder. Blood-darkened ground. The animals, the sylphs of forests and waters, gnomes and goblins, trolls and giants, the spirits of the dead and other beasts. A battle against humans' greed and indifference. Fury bursts into flames. A sea of ruin.

[Verse I]
Thunder breaks the silence before war
Bringing the light over blood darkened field
Disciplined warriors marches to death
Everyone knows this will be the end
Ravens fly over army flags

Cavalry is drumming the ground, men raise their weapons
This is pain but no one wants to end the wait

When dark clouds open to reveal the army of wrath
Our ancestors
They see us,
And in their cry they bless us...

[Chorus:]
Fight with your swords, find courage against hordes of enemies
They strike with their fear
Parrying all those blades is like dance on Dryads Lake
We shall go to battle and release our furious rage

[Verse II]
The stage of death slays hopes of many
And no one sees how time flies by
No one cares if a brother dies, the rain has begun
Claws of wind wipe creatures upon the field
Revealing a sight where corpses lie near
The flames of the burning sun releases our souls

When dark clouds open to reveal the army of wrath
Our ancestors
They see us,
And in their cry they bless us...

[Chorus]

Men! The enemy is here. They are burning our homes. They are killing our children!
Show them no mercy! Kill them all! Attack!

[Chorus]
