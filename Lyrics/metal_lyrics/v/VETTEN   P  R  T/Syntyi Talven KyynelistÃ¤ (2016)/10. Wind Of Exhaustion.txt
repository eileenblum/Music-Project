A hunted animal. Eyes blurred by the stampede. Run! Hide! Heart is pounding. Legs are burning. A brother falls. I wet myself. I won't look back.

[Verse I]
"How beautiful is sky"
He said to me and died

Run and make your way far away
Hide if only you know you're safe
Enemy is marching behind your backs
Just take a breath to lose your head

They came from nowhere, appeared from dark
Shadows so fast they froze our hearts
Bloodlust in blue eyes glowing in the dark
Dryads of nature are hunting us down

[Chorus:]
Heart is pounding, legs are burning
Intense stampede, cold sweat trickling
Animal knows when it is hunted
Callous arm is brushing your shoulder

Run! Hide! Fear!
Enemy is on their way
You see no dawn so

Run! Hide! Fear!
Leave exhausted one
He slows you down so
Run!

[Verse II]
Then I fell down
And began to cry aloud

Run and make your way far away
Hide if only you know you're safe
Enemy is marching behind your backs
Just take a breath to lose your head

Screams of pain are haunting around woods
Watch your feet, don't stumble over corpse
You may wet yourself but you can't turn back
Fear of dying keeps us on track

[Chorus]

You run!
You hide!
You fear!
Run until your legs will break down!

[Chorus]

You run!
You hide!
You fear!
Run until your legs will break down!
