Fury and jealous. They gather their own. The first sows the seeds of fear. The second grows the rotten mind. The journey is to begin. Brothers of hate accompany the men.

[Verse I]
Fear from the south came on our lands
Leaving those villagers on our hands
Like shadows
They came to the north to bereave our homes

While we were hunting they arrived to our village
Raping wives, killing kids, burning supplies
And they said
This is the wish of their God

[Pre-chorus:]
Fire, the liar
Give me a knife
I will cut that man's throat
For cruelties to my child
We shall not forget
Revenge of the sword
You will taste my steel
And my wrath
You'll be slaughtered
Under the northern sky

[Chorus:]
Fury and jealous
Those brothers of hate
One makes you fear
And another keen on resentment
They ire you into doom
Your men will fall
Redemption is withhold
Our enemies won't go home

[Verse II]
Their kings couldn't watch the wealth of our people
Nor beauty of our women or bravery of our children
Not theirs!
This is the plan of their God!

[Pre-chorus:]
Fire, the liar
Give me a knife
I will cut that man's throat
For cruelties to my child
We shall not forget
Revenge of the sword
You will taste my steel
And my wrath
You'll be slaughtered
Under the moonless sky

[Chorus]
