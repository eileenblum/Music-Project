They are everywhere. They see everything. Frost has settled among us. The time of men has come to an end. We roam. We fall. All must answer when the ruler of Halla demands the words of Vala. Kneel before the northern throne. Value the nature and you shall live.

World is vast or so I was told
Now going to an adventure for my Lord
Shackles are my shadow, none ask from serf
Packing my clothes and a loaf of bread

Shades are lurking on the ground around us
Sylphs take men to the falling dusk
We are out of food and our toes are benumbed
I am in the twilight and my guts are gone

Seize the north, you brought the hordes
To claim our land and our homes
You drain our lakes, cut our forests
Forts will rise and reach to the skies

The spirits are awake now, scream for your lives
The cry of the dryads fill the trees, they're alive
Men behind the walls don't have a place to hide
Our many eyes see your only lives

What is this place?
Then I gazed upon the creature with highest awe

When you are alone
Wind whispers the call

"Kuule jo lapsonen huutomme tÃ¤Ã¤
Seuraa jo Ã¤Ã¤ntÃ¤mme lÃ¤mpimÃ¤Ã¤n"

[Pre-chorus:]
Sky and ground and fire and snow
Human shall bow to the northern throne
Oath is spelt in the coldest home
Take these words or thou shalt find your death

[Chorus:]
We are the lord of realms unwelcome
Feel the glacial wind you servant
Kneel before you enter our domain
Or you pay your life to the warden

Land is free for those who spell the
Oath of ancient king who raised the
Wind to wrap our laws of wailing
In this new kingdom made of ice

[Verse II]
Ice has settled to the well and among us
Frost has killed most aged and young ones
Troops are in chaos and my Lord's getting mad
I am still alive but my edge has a crack

And now our time
Will soon fade away
This past life of mine

Is reversed, dream I chased

When you are alone
Wind whispers the call

"Kuule jo lapsonen huutomme tÃ¤Ã¤
Seuraa jo Ã¤Ã¤ntÃ¤mme lÃ¤mpimÃ¤Ã¤n"

[Pre-chorus:]
Sky and ground and fire and snow
Human shall bow to the northern throne
Oath is spelt in the coldest home
Take these words or thou shalt find your death

[Chorus:]
We are the lord of realms unwelcome
Feel the glacial wind you servant
Kneel before you enter our domain
Or you pay your life to the warden

Land is free for those who spell the
Oath of ancient king who raised the
Wind to wrap our laws of wailing
In this new kingdom made of ice

[Verse III, Part I]
Brothers! Here me out!
Do we have to die out here?
I wanna live!
So what you say? What say you!

The night fell dark, the cold came out
The furious rage purged among us
Slash and cut, strike and block
Troops fall down, they see no dawn

I run and run, run run run
Ruler of Halla caught my heart
He spoke some words, I understood none
I open my eyes and answered this one

[Verse III, Part II]
Sky and ground and fire and snow
Human shall bow to the northern throne
Oath is spelt in the coldest home
Take these words or thou shalt find your death

Now I am free!

Illusion is broken, I've been awakened
It was always there in my mind!

Value the nature and you shall live
In this our new kingdom made of ice!

[Chorus:]
We are the lord of realms unwelcome
Feel the glacial wind you servant
Kneel before you enter our domain
Or you pay your life to the warden

Land is free for those who spell the
Oath of ancient king who raised the
Wind to wrap our laws of wailing
In this new kingdom made of ice
