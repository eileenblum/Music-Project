Beneath the streets,
A common man is caged,
Tormented and mortified.

Subjected to intense hurt and mental shock,
Horrified by a brutality
He can't understand.

Tortured
Suffering to confess
The crime
Not match their impress

Colors of Hate

Aggression based on skin coler.
Disgusted to realize racial intolerance.
Discrimination is a tool of the machine.

Oppression
A scar that never heal
Racism
A brand ripped in flesh

Colors of Hate

Prejudice is the gun that guarantee
That we (already) live in a divided society
All the pain, all misery, has a history
And the past and its hate can't be erased
