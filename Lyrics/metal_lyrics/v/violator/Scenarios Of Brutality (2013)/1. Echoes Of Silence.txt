Centuries of massacre are still not over
Hunger and Death still remains
A silent extermination is at full force
When collide to corporations plans

Invisible Death!

Expelled by the continuing colonization
Land and water ripped apart
One-Sided struggle to revert this action
And save what left from what they deprive

Unseen Terror!

[Chorus:]
Echoes of Silence
Genocide
Echoes of Silence
Enslaved by their force

Murder and dismemberment as
Strategies
Indians facing suicide as solution
threatened by fear

This is the effects of the devastation
Of a progress model that fuels
International capital and its limbs
Draining life from our earth

[Chorus]
