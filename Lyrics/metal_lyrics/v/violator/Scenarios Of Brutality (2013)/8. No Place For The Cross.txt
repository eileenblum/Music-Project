Lying infected in a hospital
a woman suffers in agony
nothing but death insides her
but a priest twisted her in property

Prisioners of christians beliefs
a morality based on prejudice

My body, my mind, I see
no place for the cross
My will, my choice, I Know
no place for the cross

Fake dogmas imposing
misoginy, lies, intolerance
preachers disguising as peace
just another hate speech

How long will we accept this silence?
Letting poor women dies
to satisfice a wicked god
who pleasures of our disgrace

Wont control me
I reject your cross
Wont control me
I reject your god
