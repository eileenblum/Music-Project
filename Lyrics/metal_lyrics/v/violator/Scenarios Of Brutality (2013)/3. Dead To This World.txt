Consumerism has a hidden face
immigrants disgraced in foreign land
freedom stolen, dignity destoyed
brand new slavery

Forgotten and exploited
enslaved and deceived
a life witthout value
you're dead to this world

dead
to this world

Corporations profits with deth
people disposable by servitude
surveillance so the will always serve
a prison with no walls

Brought to this country and deluded by promises of hope
the pain you feel now, your family feels again, won't go away

cycle of perversity
modern atrocity
brand new slavery
in global economy
consumes hipocrisy
fake liberty
no morality
now you are dead to this world
