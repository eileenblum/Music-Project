Raising red flags as the fresh blood that son
Would be dropped by those
Who pretend to protect but only kill

Confrontation

Burning tires âcause they have reached their
Boiling point but their choice
To oppose was replied with carnage

Executed point black, for rising up against the greed
Another day: unstoppable slaughter
Another preys of the killing fields

Just another gory conflict in an old
History of land concentration
Where few has the power

Massacre for land
Massacre for our land

Control over media converts in insanity
As they could justify this fatality
Gravelly, we will remember the story of his slay
So the memory wonât fade away
