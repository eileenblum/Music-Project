The people from our land has lived under fear
Military madness financed by the empire.
The masters of those times, with their stars and uniforms
Had never face the trials for the horror they performed

Torturers/Walking free
No retribution/Impunity
Celebrating injustice/Laughing of our despair
Crimes without answer/Truth vanished into thin air 

Atrocities! Those who fought were never found!

In the south of continent 
There's a history written in blood
A tyranny that never ends 
The power is still on their domain

The authority regime's a living monstrosity
Their privilege system feed (our) animosity
As we see sadists get away with murder
And repression are still heavy our shoulders

We won't forget, won't forgive
You'll be finished someday
And we will be there, awaiting your end 
To spit on your grave!

Endless!
Tyrannies!
