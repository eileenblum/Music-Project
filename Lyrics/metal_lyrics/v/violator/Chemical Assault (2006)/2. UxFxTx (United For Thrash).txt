Waking day by day
You see your life passing away
Nothing seems worth to fight
Nothing to loose,
'cause you're already lost
But there's a way to be free
In the stage dive!

Breath the Underground
United for Thrash!
Breakout the Impositions
United for Thrash!

You born with a role
All decisions have been chose
(but) Who the fuck choose for you?
They can call us maniacs

but we don't live for the greed
Thrash back all lies
in their fuckin' faces

Breathe the Underground
United for Thrash!
Breakout the Impositions
United for Thrash!

It doesn't matter if you bang or slam
We're all the same in the circle pit
Hunting rip offs, Nazis and Christians
Bonded by blood we'll stand until the end!
Until the End!

United For Thrash!

UxFxTx!
