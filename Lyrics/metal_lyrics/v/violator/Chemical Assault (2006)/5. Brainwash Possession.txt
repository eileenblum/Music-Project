In a long time
You have walk these streets with pride
Claiming to be the one
But it was always a matter of pose

Boundless condemnation
To show how much you though you command
Finally you find your truth
Just another follower in the crowd

Delivered to sacrifice
Brainwash possession
The power to drain all your will
Brainwash possession

And now this time is gone
You are turn into a new servant
Let your god slay you
While you deny all your past

Its hard to realize
How the true becomes the weak
But it would come to sight
You've always been a preacher

Living under the cross of misery
All defiance turns into apathy
Inquisitions smash the differences
But I shall not surrender to slavery
