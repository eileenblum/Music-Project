Justice must be blind
Closed eyes to the massacre
Death and sorrow everyday
Judge hammer is in your face
They will take your life
A Life with pain, a death with pain

Waiting the hour
The end is so near
Waking in horror
There's no Salvation from
Terror and fear
Constantly Madness
No self protection
Lethal injection

Why?
Do I have to pay?
For those who live to betray
Trapped in the Death Row chains
"Lethal Injection
In your brain!"

A sentence of death
On each one of us
Since the day we were born
Nothing is gonna change
Feeling dead when alive
A living hell, a living hell

Convicted by a tainted court!

Trial by money: Corruption
Judged by color: Injustice

You never win in a system build for you to loose,
No chance for your side, unless is their side

No way to be free: Prejudice
Hard to resist: Tyranny

There are no crimes for those who made the law
Walk in the line, but it will lead to suicide
Now pay the price!
