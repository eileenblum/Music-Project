Misery scatters in the cities
Fascists wishes blood spill

Hired to exterminate
Feeling like a justice angel,
Washing the streets with agony
Seeking ways to eliminate
The price for security
Only God could be so'
EVIL

Persecution
In service of Death
Body count
Killing Squad
There's no where to hide
You are Destined to Die

Punishment for those
Who lives in the gutter
Minority shattered with force
Blind for suffering
he's a cold-blood murderer
Only God could be so'
EVIL

Persecution
In service of Death
Body count
Killing Squad
There's nowhere to hide
You are Destined to Die

Waiting in the shadows he's coming
To crush you on the half
With no mercy he will obey
And all the poor slay
State Power has given him
A license to oppress
Insanity has taken control
He'll take us all to hell

Ready to Kill
