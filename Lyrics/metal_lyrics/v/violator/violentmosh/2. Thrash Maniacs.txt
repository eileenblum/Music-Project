You fashion bastard with empty head
Your words doesn't mean a shit to me!!!
Speed and aggression will overrun your vanity
A spit of hate in your face!!!

All your money can't buy you attitude
Everything you live is a fucking lie
Be honest with yourself. Poser
Fuck off and die!!!

Before you see
We'll blast your head and kick your fucking ass!!!
My pleasure is watch you bleed
We are thrash maniacs!
Your way of life is a fucking trend
Brain-washed people addicted to shit
A personality that you just pretend
Hell is coming and you gonna burn!!!

An army of pretensions and ignorance
No brains to be individual
Brutality is coming to get you
You better run, you sucker
