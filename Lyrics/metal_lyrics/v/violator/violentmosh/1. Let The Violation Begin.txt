Representing the law, extorting our blood,
We're victims of abuse, buying our freedom
Cops are thirsty to rip your ass apart,
Tracing people like dogs, we're trapped in a dead end

Running, we can never hide
Fear, invading our minds
Mayhem and terror are spread on the streets
But there's always a way to resist

Reply all repression
Face the authority
Answer with the same aggression
Let the violation begin

Corrupted feelings are supported by the state
To serve and protect is to violence and to rape
Dollars means respect, exhausting our vital force
Officers are dirtier than the criminals they chase

Justice is blind because their crimes are forgotten
Screams are silenced with the sticks in our throats
The years of submission'll be avenged someday
Action brings reaction and it will rise with pain!
