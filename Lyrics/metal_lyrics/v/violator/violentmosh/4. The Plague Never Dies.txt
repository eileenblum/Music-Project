Crawling through the night, they're are hungry for some lives
No one can stop them, their desire is plundering
Everything they touch is transformed into ashes
Uncontrolled strike,as fast as it can be

Destroying, devastating, they're coming over here
You better be prepared, because the plague...
Torment in fire, power and pain, total disaster, the plague... never dies!

After their attack, nobody can resist
No traces left behind, the assault is thundering
Remain on the target and become their prey
You'll be taken by violence and seized by the plague

Destroying, devastating, they're coming over here
You better be prepared, because the plague...
Torment in fire, power and pain, total disaster, the plague... never dies!

Once the butchery is over, their mission is done, but their weakness is now revealed.
A fulminating quake comes to knock them down.
The plague has no strength to arise.
Everything's reverted, a twister in their minds.
A terrible pain remains.
Pressure over bodies, they've came to deadline, there's only one solution: evacuate
