Life is a merciless fight
No one can win
Ally with your arch enemy
You can't fail, you can't ruin
Eliminate your fear to feed your hope
Then kill, dig and bury!
We just think we're human
Making a perfect society
A fair and honest lie
That hides all the misery
A million people die
Behind this hypocrisy

Only one survive!
Killer Instinct!
And you gonna die!
Killer Instinct!
This is the life you live!
Killer Instinct!
Killer Instinct!

Justice doesn't exist
The hate create the death stream
When anger and pain command
Life lost the mean
Pray looking to the heaven
So you never see the hole you are in

It's the natural selection
Existence is stiff
This primal rage is destroying us
No solution for this conflict
The last stage of evolution
Is another step to the cliff
