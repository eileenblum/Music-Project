Born in a world of madness
Sick and tired of all this shit
Tolerance is for the fools
My last hope is a war

In this life they'll pay

Your heaven will never come
I'm not going to wait until I die
Raise your head and raise your voice
Let's start to kill

You better start to pray

Artillery

Speeches are for those who believe
That just words can change the reality
Stupid rules of conformism
Transformed existence in a purgatory

In this life they'll pay

Terminate the authority
Blast the barriers with all your felling to kill
The power is at our hands
Crush the oppressor and thrash'em all

You better start to pray

Artillery

Speak your mind
Begin the slaughter
Causing mass destruction
It's up to you
United forces
Die Hard
No remorse
hunt their heads
and show no mercy
It's payback time
Forget the law
Become a Violator
