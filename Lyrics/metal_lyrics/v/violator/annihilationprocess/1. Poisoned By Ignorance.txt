Deadlier than death from above,
An ideal like a disease
Man as ruler of the world
Nature to slavery

The way that we're gonna live?
The way that we're gonna die?
Poisoned by ignorance

A seed of hate
To vanquish the earth

Life, a product on a shelf
Choose what to purchase
Guided by your prejudice
Of colour, of class and of gender

The way that we're gonna live?
The way that we're gonna die?
Poisoned by ignorance

A seed of hate
Vanquish the earth
To control, to exploit, to destroy, to dispose.
Poisoned by ignorance

Then when you realized,
you won't have more time,
things will be destroyed.

Now, what will you consume?
It turned against you.
Only total death remains
