No change is enough change when profit is still the goal.
The structure of power and tyranny must be vanished as one.

Give me destruction
Apathy brings slow corrosion
Give me destruction

No political of corporation, don't be glad with inner agreement.
Never compromise. Wipe out this way of life.

Give me destruction
Apathy brings slow corrosion
Give me destruction
Or give me death

Better a world in ashes than a world with no hope.
Time to rearrange

It's convenient to believe there's no hope. It maintains the exploitation.
Theirs victory. To deny is just a way to assure the end
