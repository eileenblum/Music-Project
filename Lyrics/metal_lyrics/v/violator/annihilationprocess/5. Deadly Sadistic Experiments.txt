A right to slave
based on a delusion
of an outrageous creator
To pretend superior is just
a way to terror.

Skinned alive.
Acid in the eyes.
Pain for comfort and for vanity.
An angst for security
just brings more fear.

Ripped, forced to ravenous submission
Consenting to animal holocaust
Tortured in the name of god-progress

Deadly, horror medicine
Sadistic, cruelty capacity
Experiments, massacre must end

The pain you caused
Will return stronger with hate.
We'll pay back, your time has come
I hope you vivisectors burn
