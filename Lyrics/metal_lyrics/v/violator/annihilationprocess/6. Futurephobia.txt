See starving people
surviving with the carcass
of those who try to eliminate them.
Watch TV lobotomy
changing violence into anesthesia.

Lives running in chaos,
smashed by everyday insanity.
Taken control by panic.
But can we save today?

Futurephobia
Path to extinction
Futurephobia
Path we choose now

Hear afflicted cries
of those who feel exploited
and can't comprehend.
Feel rebellion against the future
that doom unborn generations.

Lives running in chaos,
smashed by everyday insanity.
Taken control by fear.
But can we save today?

If you want to make a change
you must not look to the sky.
There's no god and no salvation.
Search the answer in yourself.

Destroy the trust is to assure impact
Future's not set. Fate is just what we make
Moment of truth we must stop it now
It has started, the Annihilation Process
