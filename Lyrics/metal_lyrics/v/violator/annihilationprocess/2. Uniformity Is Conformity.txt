We feel different and this's no label to exploit
All our strength has not a price
Tolerance has to end, with their abuse

When your resistance
Can sell more
Your violence
Will be their profit

Resisting day by day
Going against the grain
Don't bent to what they say
Uniformity is Conformity

Not a face in the crowd
Out of step, out of time
Never walk the line
Uniformity is Conformity

A misfits network, outsiders who fight lethargy
Not for soldiers and hierarchy.
Not a troop where submission is an instinct.

Make your stand
Think for yourself
Fight for what you believe
Get back your life in your hands
