[Executer cover]

Fifteen years of innocence
Don't know what life is yet
You were chosen boy
Will fight for you and for them

The war is cold
Colder and dark is your fate
Traced by the fear and the uncertainty of living
She makes yourself being your own enemy

Even if you try to remember the past
There is no time
This little part of your life
Was extinct by a shady present

Fight boy show them
War is inhuman
You'll come back before dying

Now ask yourself
Why I pretend not to be here
Need to face the reality
You were sent by them
You've come to fight for them

One day all your illusions
Will face the past
Around cruel moments
You'll see how much your life is

Believe it this war will finish
And will show them how much you
And not a simple innocent boy
