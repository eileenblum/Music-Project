Machine Tyranny
Anxiety for freedom
Ignoring others pain
Becoming other prison.

Smashing. Pollution damage growing up so high.
Mass graves so that few have the privilege to oppress more.

Blood for oil
Supporting their war.
The crisis wont be felt
Inside the armored box.

Smashing. Pollution damage growing up so high.
Mass graves so that few have the privilege to oppress more.

Feel the signs of rot
The Apocalypse Engine
Fuel for the end of times
The Apocalypse Engine

Will come the day, and its not far,
that the smoke will erase us from our mind
Lungs as black as the coal that pulses in the machine
until then, let the engines roar!

Apocalypse! Engine!

Your thirsty for speed,
Consents destruction
Use your belt,
In the rape of our land!
