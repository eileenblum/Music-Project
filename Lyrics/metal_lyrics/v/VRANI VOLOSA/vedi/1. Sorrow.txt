Silence bleeds
The wounds of time are still open
The death of thousands I can't forget
Tears in the eyes that can't be seen

It is my sorrow that lasts so strongly
Banished my spirit in the fog of the field
My sorrow will last so strongly
There is no end to see what's next

Lonesome steps
The dust will fill them, I'm still here
Tears in the eyes that can't be seen
The wounds of time are still open

It is my sorrow that lasts so strongly
Banished my spirit in the fog of the field
My sorrow will last so strongly
There is no end to see what's next

Years passed by
Tears still falling on the grass
Loneliness of eternity
Ghost marching through the field

Heavens take me away from here
Will ever my soul rest in peace

Years passed by
Snow buried lonesome steps
Restless shadow fades away
Ravens enthrone the night

Heavens take me away from here
Will ever my soul rest in peace
