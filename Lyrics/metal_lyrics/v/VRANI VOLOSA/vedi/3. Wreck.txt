Wild winds cut the sea
Into black abyss
Depths of endlessness
They await for us

Hands from nothingness
Try to stop the ship
Prayer to our gods
Waters boil with greed

Take a look to the endless shores
Beaten by the stormy waves
Home's so near and so apart
Will we all see the morning sun

Life now passes by
Streams of moments gone
Etes so sorrowful
Wariching down the sea

Cold stare to the sky
Blackness all around
Fate's not on our side
Seems it is the end

Take a look to the endless shores
Beaten by the stormy waves
Home's so near and so apart
Will we all see the morning sun

Voices of the damned
Doomed to sing our end
Wild win cut the sea
into black abyss
