Highest the mountains that grow to our side
Breathless we stand and gaze to the light
The white snow remembers thousands of years
The silent wind whispers the names of our heroes.
Tales has been spoken, the hearts are wide open
Nothing can stop us to choose now our fate
Bloodred horizon awakens the dawn
Steel and flesh we are off through the field

Deepest the lake we always drink from
Mirrors our faces the last time goodbye
Standing in front the graves of our fathers
We promise victory or we'll die for sure
Spears and swords, shields and flags
We take the road, we walk our path
Steel and flesh we are off through the field

Years trapped between centuries
Songs that never will be sung
Sands that buried all the memories
Ghosts will never rest in peace

Fires upon our graves
Stones in cyclical stand
Ruins upon them new ones
And we are still here to call you

Whispers unchain your minds
So bound we don't know why
Burning skies clear your sights
And listen deeply to your hearts

Fires upon our graves
Stones in cyclical stand
Ruins upon them new ones
And we are still here to call you
