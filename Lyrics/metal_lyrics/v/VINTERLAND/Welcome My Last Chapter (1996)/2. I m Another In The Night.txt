Once the light has falled, the shadows coming forth,
Once the lightning rolls, I'm going to die here

My blood was waiting for it, with that horrid joy,
My heart acheing for it, I cannot wait/want more.

I can hear them walk right by ???

In the day I (Mysterious I cry/) was blind.
Once again I could hear them calling me

I felt so crystal clear, like snow. I will fly away,
Unknown (is floating?) exploring

The wise exploring above, the flight has stopped the sorrow,
Again, I/'m/ walk/one with darkness,
when I was exploring/glowing with them,
The night

I am alive

My blood and lust, shall grant the grave/so bright and grey,
beyond the day,
I felt the blade so pure.

As the sorrow ran from my heart, when I am/remain here.
I am another in the night, when I fly. So bright,
So bright!

The dawn walk with me.

Once the light has falled, the shadows coming forth,
Once the lightning rolls, (I'm going to die here???)

I'm going to die right here!

Once again the (dawn/) night is (far) over /again/ (me)
Once again I will be another in the night,
In the night
In the night...
