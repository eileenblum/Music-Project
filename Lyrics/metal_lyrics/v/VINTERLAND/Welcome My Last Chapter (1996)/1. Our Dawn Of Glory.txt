With fury I feel the night appear within
In the moonlight so cold, I was born
I was born

Into the night, I walked the earth.
I didn't feel the light
I didn't feel the light

When it'd appear, the dawn of twilight, I felt my rightful way
I was so cold, the blood in me, the dawn, the crystal glow of night
High above
The crystal glow
