Still the night is awake, like a black candle that's all around.
To go from dusk from here, I walk thirsty for blood.
Thirsty for blood.

Still the night is awake, with the dead I spread my wings.
Now the realm in here, coming in me/Come with me???

Still the night is awake.

I feel I (the) flew??? with/ (like) my black wings of death.
Right up to the light of the sky.
I came out, my howling/holy call.
As dark as a war(???), I am in here.

This winter, as I follow, I follow it
I'm in love in the snow, will I ever feel again???

This world, flowing like my life. And out bringing light of dawn.
I never will be
