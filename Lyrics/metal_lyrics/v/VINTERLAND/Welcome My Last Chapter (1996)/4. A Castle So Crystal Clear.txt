The time of darkness, we fly, we cannot get further/by it.
I change the night, with/the sparkle in my eyes,??? I see.

No-one could see it, the castle beyond the darkness.
Loved by grief, it will enter the day.

With no soul, it rose in mist.
It bewildered me, I follow.

No-one could see it, the castle beyond the darkness.
Loved by grief, it will enter the day.

Come forth, the grave will beckon like a flame/grey?
Soon standing out there, soon haunting the castle grounds.

(Outlasting) Ever lasting, covered with stone, lasting with snow so white.
A castle so crystal clear, it's gate covered with ice.

(Outlasting) Ever lasting, covered with stone, lasting with snow so white.
A castle so crystal clear, it's gate covered with ice.

The crystal of the dawn, it's flowing/snowing.

So dark and grey. I will soon die.
Soon die.

(Outlasting) Ever lasting, covered with stone, lasting with snow so white.
A castle so crystal clear, it's gate covered with ice.

A castle so crystal clear
