I can see how the sun leave me to the twilight.
Like a hand, stretched out towards the richness of night.

I welcome my last chapter...

Let the night obscure the forest to black,
so the lantern of my heart can end.

Let the mist from the frozen stars stand cold over me
so my blood slowly curdle to ice.

Let the wings of grief carry me to the kingdom far beyond all light.

Come, come please and grab my hands.
And may the frozen winds caress my empty soul...

Wings of sorrow, a caree of silence,
wings of sorrow, tears of blood.

Wings of sorrow, a caree of silence,
wings of sorrow, tears of blood.

Blood!

Wings of sorrow, a caree of silence,
wings of sorrow, tears of blood.

Wings of sorrow, a caree of silence,
wings of sorrow, tears of blood.

Blood!

Wings of sorrow, wings of sorrow, sorrow...

Now have the twilight already falled.

Farewell...
Farewell...

Let the wings of grief carry me to the kingdom far beyond all light.

Come, come please and grab my hands.
And may the frozen winds caress my empty soul...

Wings of sorrow, a caree of silence,
wings of sorrow, tears of blood.

Wings of sorrow, a caree of silence,
wings of sorrow, tears of blood.

Now the sun has already/always left me...

The twilight have already falled
Farewell
