The dark in this forest. Once again it reach to my depth.
My hands/heart are/is full of winter,
A cold and icy winter.

My/A??? bleed, far beyond the sun,
this kingdom will forever/never lay aside(???)

My journey, to the grounded(???) sea.
I was the last awoke(???)
I feel(???) so down, so down

Now I found the ice crown(??)
So bright, a breeze.

This blessed kingdom, that never saw the sun.
My soul in a?? winter breeze
A winter breeze.

The dark, I now follow from my death(??) eternally to die.
A broken chain(??) of filth(??) a breeze, a country(???)

My breeze, my winter love(???) of death.
My blood freeze, my eyes(??)
A winter breeze takes my life.
Takes my soul far away.
A winter breeze

A winter breeze.
