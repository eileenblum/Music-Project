A shadow dances in the stone hall
The spirit without a name
The prey that flits across the cave wall
is hunted down by ancient flames

Blood drops cast by the elder
contrast to the winter pale skin
the stains trail upward on the body
drawing the claw of the Djinn

Rites of the Fathers
Scriptures on skin
Delve into sin !
Black stale waters
Pike jaw grin
Let the animal in !

A howl from underneath the wolf hide
declares innocence dead
the drive that lurks where the beast hides
settles in the fair haired head
