Night falls over hills and rural plains
Night calls to the sleeping bone remains

Every fourth moon for centuries
sees the charge of the ghoul wind raid
Midwinter and Walpurgis Night
and at Cimmerian August Shade

Lids creak as the corpses start to barge
Tombs speak in the draught
of the raider's charge

Unfortunate nights for centuries
as the moon wears cranial shade
bonfires burn for mercy
to fend off the spectral blade

Godless spirit raiders
ride the howling wind
Backwood grave invaders
resume their die hard sin

Screeching and yammering
with grins of vengeful might
Ghouls blaze across the sky tonight

Every fourth moon for centuries
sees the charge of the ghoul wind raid
May-Eve and Midwinter Blot
and at Cimmerian August Shade
