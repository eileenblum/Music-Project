Mummified cavalry
Led by the European gleam
ride out of the dawn of a fevered dream

Hoofs on the sand ground
stirring the sleep of time
Death rides through the hills of searing thyme

Risen from the stone beds
with weapons gripped
Maces and Sables
Knights of the Burning Crypt

Headgear and breastplates
encrusted with ancient dust
Bones crossed to renounce the grind of lust

Bloodstained visors
blocking the rays of the sun
Fleshly hunger
craving to be undone

Swords raised
These are ghost of the Templar graves
