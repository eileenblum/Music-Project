With tears from the well in the mountain
and the gaze from the pestilence hearse
with a voice both whispering and shouting
come the words that were dug from the Earth

Ashem - Dava !
Ashem - Deva !

By the flowers that bloom on the grave hill
and the acid that frets in the snake
By the hue in the eye of the road kill
comes a witness between sleep and wake

Namtar !  Allatu !
Namtar !  Allatu !

chill my bones with liquid sooth
Fill my mouth with budding youth

By thee smoke wreaths that dance in the darkness
with the scent of the desert night
By the grin of the disinterred carcass
here's to demons that dwell out of sight

Ashem - Deva !
Namtar ! Allatu !
