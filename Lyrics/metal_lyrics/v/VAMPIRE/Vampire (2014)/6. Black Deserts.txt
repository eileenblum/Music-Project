Powers from beyond the sky descend upon us
Alight wave of invisible decay burns within us

A nuclear strike from outer space opens the sky
earth becomes an ugly place - repent and die!

The human throne is overthrown
In a mess of twisted rust
Shattered stone and crumbled bone
Atomic whirlwinds stir the dust

At the horizon a shadow swells
And drowns us in ominous darkness
Mankind, afloat on a metal sea
Sinks to a bottom of no end

An ashem stormwind sweeps the plain
And cloaks us in gray
Uranic torrents of acid rain wind us away
