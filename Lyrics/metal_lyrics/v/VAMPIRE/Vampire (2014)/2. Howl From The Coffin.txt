In a barren churchyard
Deserted, secluded and bleak
Dwells a nameless horror
Under a nameless grave
Prowling in the shadows
watchers of the abyss
A peak of undead jackals
A band of undead ghouls

Piercing through the dark
A howl from the coffin
An inetfable sound
From the underworld

A howl from the coffin
Rises like a foul inverted dirge
a howl from the coffin
Cracks the stained glass
Windows of the church

With an eerie creaking
The lid of the tomb slides off
Unveiling a horrible secret
Unveiling a horrible sight
Prowling in the shadows
Protectors of the abyss
A pack of undead jackals
A band of undead ghouls

In a barren churchyard
Deserted, secluded and bleak
Dwells a nameless horror
Under a nameless grave
Prowling in the shadows
watchers of the abyss
A peak of undead jackals
Invincible guardians of Satan
