Burning autumn rust
Decay and desire
Unbowed forest lust
Soul meets fire
Out of the old horn
Ancestral hunger
Flesh of the unborn
Ripped asunder

Hexahedron
Bleeding obelisk
Hexahedron
Six-faced monlith

Ecatatic nighttime burial
Vanquished beauty
Sacralizing Ariel
Lust and cruelty

Six secret pathways to the altar
The serpent god is waiting in the spoor
Six hidden gateways of the psalter
The idol head lies buried in the moor

Blood from the mountain in a bone-bound cask
The spray of the cardinal fountain paints your mask
