Out of the depths of the local lore
Rises a rebel from hell
Keeping the keys to the netherworld
He wields an unbreakable spell

He forges the tenets of destiny
Exploring the wastelands beyond

Eternity within a wooden frame
The book is burning
With a yearning flame
On the cover a forbidden name
The unholy Eibon
A voice is calling from the other side
You can run but you can never hide
This house is haunted
Since the night he died
The ungodly warlock

He forges the tenets of destiny
Exploring the wastelands beyond

Unseeing eyes
In the grip of a baneful spell
Are leading the way
Down the timeless pits of hell

Woe unto him who opens
The gateways into the beyond
This house of old history awakens
With a murmur is secretes resound
