From the foot of the mountain beyond sight
From the depth of the furthermost wood
Through the shadows that move with the moonlight
Comes the darkness is cloak and hood

Unto children who play 'round the pyre
Unto women who walk through the night
Unto mean sitting watch by the fire
Strikes the darkness that kills with a bite

The Hunter...
A stalker of human prey
On the loose 'til the light of day
At dusk you become it's prey
At your neck 'til the break of day

From the nethermost soil of the graveyard
From the hill of forgotten fears
Past the gate with the slumbering town guard
Sneaks the foe of a thousand years

Riding memories too hurtful to handle
On the nightwind that smells of the sea
Blowing into extinguish your candle
Comes Death to pay homage to thee
