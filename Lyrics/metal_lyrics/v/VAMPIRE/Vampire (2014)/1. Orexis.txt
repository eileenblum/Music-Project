Lingering far out of reach
for the conscious mind
hovers a slumbering insanity
to which we are blind

The curtain falls down
The awe can begin
The truth is revealed
without and within

Cloaking the nature of things
in a comforting guise
under the coat of society
a darkness resides

The curtain falls down
The awe can begin
The truth is revealed
without and within

The veil is removed
and an eye glances back
Let go of it all and
we're under attack

Concealing the unpleasant truth
in a union of lies
behind the veil of reality
this monster abides

The curtain falls down
The awe can begin
The truth is revealed
without and within

The veil is removed
and an eye glances back
Let go of it all and
we're under attack

In the murk of the backyard at night time
in the gloom of the miscreant's vice
in the glance from the bypassing stranger
is a crack that sheds light on a netting of lies
