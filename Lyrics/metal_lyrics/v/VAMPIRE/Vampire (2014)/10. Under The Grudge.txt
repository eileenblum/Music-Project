In the outskirts of the city, on a quiet dead end street,
In a house of narrow stories - that's where life and death will meet.

Who is hiding in the walls?
What is crawling down the stairs?
You won't leave this house alive.
You will die in a blur of blackest anger.
In a cloud of blind revenge
there's a pair of eyes that watches
and their aim will never change.

Who is hiding in the walls?
What is crawling down the stairs?
You won't leave this house alive.

You will die under the grudge.
Morbid beauty - blacker than jet.
Under the grugde, the sick curse is alive.
Enter the grugde. It never forgives, it never forgets.
Under the grudge, the sick curse is alive and you will die.

Resent is not an easy game, confronted wrongfully.
Stay and die like those who dared enter incautiously.
Touch upon Kayako's curse and your heart will halt.
This is where all reason bursts and you redeem your faults.
