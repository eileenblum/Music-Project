The clock strikes twelve in the cemetery - nightside breakdown.
Something stirs in the underground, and at midnight I'll possess your corpse.
Demon mass in the cemetery. Dead, awaken!

The earth is moving and opens up, and at midnight I'll possess your corpse.
Creep on out of your coffin, dance to the bell chime, move your bones for the darkness.
All hail the night time! Something emerges from under ground, lit by moonlight.

The clock strikes twelve in the cemetery and at midnight I'll possess your corpse.
Creep on out of your coffin, dance to the bell chime, move your bones for the darkness.
All hail the night time! Time has come for the death strike from under the ground.
Rise and pull yourself together pound by pound.
