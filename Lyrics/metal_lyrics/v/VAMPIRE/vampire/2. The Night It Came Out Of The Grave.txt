The night it came out of the grave was a night I shall never forget.
From my window with view I could see a horrible shadow draw near.
The night it came out of the grave the altar was slippery wet with 
the blood of a bold sacrifice which made powers unheard of arise.

Open grave - howling gate.
On my way down to hell.

The nights it comes out of the grave there's a pungent smell in the air
and the promise of bittersweet gloom as this figure is returning home.
The nights it comes out of the grave the moon sends a faltering glare 
over vales where the horror roams free and no living soul is to be seen.

At night I come out to the grave to remember and never forget.
Among the stones and the hight tufts of grass I kneel down to atone for the past.
At night I come out to the grave to make peace with the doom of regret,
and this feeling flows forth like a wave when at night it comes out of the grave.
