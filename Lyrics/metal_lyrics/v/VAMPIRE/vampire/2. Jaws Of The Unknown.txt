Lost on a trip in the luring subconsciouness
At once i'm aware, i am hardly alone in here

Something is trying to choke me
In a sudden i fight for my life
Entangled and strangled

Tentacles crawl to embrace me
In an ugly cocoon made of flesh
The terror! The horror!

Where will it end - in a prison of insanity?
Am i condemned from the circles of reality?

The bed is turned into a shaft grave
The cheers make my funeral gown
Entangled and strangled....
Caught by the jaws of the unknown
I see that i'm fully awake
