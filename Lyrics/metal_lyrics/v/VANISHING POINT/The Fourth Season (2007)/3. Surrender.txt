Your touch of grace crawls through my skin.
Your bleeding heart beats deep within.
Encaptured I remain to you, worlds away.
Your poison tongue intoxicates,
I see your mind now show your face.
Encaptured I am chained by you, worlds away.

Craving life, deprived inside, now I surrender.
You captured me within your light,
Do you remember...

Your distant cries that made me soulless.
Your trace of tears, have left me breathless.
Enchanted I embraced by you, so cold, astray.

I can't deny I am afraid,
I won't walk by and fade away.
Encaptured I belong to you, so cold, astray.

Craving life, deprived inside, now I surrender.
You captured me within your light,
Do you remember...
Craving life, deprived inside,
Now I surrender.
You captured me within your light,
Within your light, within your life,
Within your light, now I surrender.
