Eyes open, seeking your light I now find your.
Heart open, take me in your world.
Arms open, finding silence warm me in your soul.
My heart is open, hide me in your world.

Capture me falling into you,
So distant, why can't I feel?

Pure life, can't be captured in pictures
Or spoken in words.
You'll find, that there is life in this desert,
I've seen the dark side too.

Sleep through the darkness that blinds you,
Discover, uncover this day.
Should I escape the world within you,
Make your tomorrow today.

Capture me falling into you,
So distant, why can't I feel?

Pure life, can't be captured in pictures
Or spoken in words.
You'll find, that there is life in this desert,
I've seen the dark side.
