Surface, from this dream entwined.
Awakened, breathing I feel, your life inside Mine.
I've seen through, the longing,
Becoming and crying for nothing.
I view through, this chapter of pain undying.

Passing shadows to another high of hope.
Into another life alone outside,
Into another life unknown.

Inside I know I will survive, my wings are Healing.
These scars open to a new life, a new beginning.

Released from your dream, unwind.
Awake now, breathing you free your life inside Mine.
I've seen through, the longing,
Becoming and crying for nothing.
I view through, this chapter of pain undying.

Inside I know I will survive, my wings are Healing.
These scars open to a new life, a new beginning.

Cast in shadows from another high of hope.
From another life alone outside,
Into another life unknown.

Inside I know I will survive, my wings are Healing.
These scars open to a new life, a new beginning.
These scars open to a new life,
You can't deny me breathing.
I know I will survive, my wings are healing.
