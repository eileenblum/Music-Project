[In Italian:]
Si muove con vento.
In questo mondo.
Si vede la vita.
Nel buio cuore

Hopeless enemy, soulless energy,
Empty synergy, inside you and me.

Are we searching for new hope among the Heartless.
Are we finding peace and life, beyond closed Eyes.
Are we seeking a new hope among the heartless.
Will we understand when all we know is fear.

In you and I, life has gone by, saturated,
Inundated change we deny.
Descent, innocence, truth is the consequence.
This breath of life breathes full of pain,
Is it all too late.

Purify, realize, do we await a lost sunrise.
This machine turns full of hate.
We destroy what we create.
