Time taken away by chance,
Our journey is unknown.
Are there signs of life inside us.
Are there signs of hope?

Take away these years of pain,
Cast away the fear within.
Heal the scars of innocence,
Open eyes to a new world.
Drowning in contention,
Dry from saturation.
Frail misguided, worlds divided.

Drowning, deep into a memory
As soulless entity.
Surrounding me in serenity.

Lies upon the sea of doubt, I cast the stone.
Into the waves of discontent, I defy alone.

Take away these years of pain,
Cast away the fear within.
Heal the scars of innocence,
Open eyes to a new world.
Drowning in contention,
Dry from saturation.
Frail misguided, worlds divided.

Drowning, deep into a memory
As soulless entity.
Surrounding me in serenity.
