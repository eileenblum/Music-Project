Look deep in my world of silence.
What have I become to you.
Give me the eyes to see
Give me the strength to feel
Give me a life, that's everlasting.

With no hesitation I fall, what once was clear,
I believed, if I shutdown you won't know at all,
Incomplete I'm.

Scanning through memories, burnt out on entry.
Tempted by life to fail.
I've been longing for these older days to die.
Stronger my soul grows tonight.

Your memory etched in my mind.
Has wandered endlessly, now I.
Open my eyes to see
Let go my mind and feel
Open my heart this tie, to belong.

Complete, protect me.
Helpless I wait for a new day.
Beyond the dark, the truth will survive.

Scanning through memories, burnt out on entry.
Tempted by life to fail.
I've been longing for these older days to die.
Stronger my soul grows true.
