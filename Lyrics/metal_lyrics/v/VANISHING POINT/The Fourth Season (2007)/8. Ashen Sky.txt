Air deprived in a pitch black empty forms.
We stand in silence and we dream alone.
Our heartbeats turn to ash.
We fade into our past, dejected into soil Forgotten.

Daylight fades away.
Within, will we find the answers, why we turn Away.

Cast away the pain, take away these years beyond Us,
Let light fall like rain.
Can we learn how to live again,
All this endless heartache,
This broken lifeline must mend to live again.

Isolated, in this jagged mind.
These blind eyes forever dream redemption.
Innocence turned to ash.
Is hope burnt in the past?
Dejected into soil forgotten.

Daylight fades away.
Within, will we find the answers why we turn Away.

Cast away the pain, take away these years beyond Us,
Let light fall like rain.
Can we learn how to breathe again, all this Endless
Heartache, this broken lifeline.
Must learn to be free again,
Must learn to be free again.
