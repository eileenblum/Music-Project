Losing face, shedding skin,
Changing heart and giving in.
Tell your lie, tell your tales,
Deny your truth I'm bound to fail.
Tempting lives into sin,
This apple has been bitten in,
Are we so far from reach?

Wake me,
Let me breathe the air again
Before you drag me under.
Wake me,
I need to feel the air again
Before you drag me underground.

Messenger of influence,
You stand alone and make no sense.
Your cold embrace will free who's mind,
I'll walk alone ten steps behind.
I have seen it all along,
Trying to reconcile what's wrong, am I so far,
So far from reach?

Wake me,
Let me breathe the air again
Before you drag me under.
Wake me,
I need to feel the air again
Before you drag me underground.
