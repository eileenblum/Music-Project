Cold, void, hopeless, empty
See how we are falling
Searching for a higher ground
While time slips to waste

Seeking hope and answers
Emotionless and breaking
At loss to time slipping away

Daylight, I saw you fade
You took me under, walked away
You left me stranded in this silence

These broken walls now show resolve
Outside Iâll run to the unknown
Iâll leave behind these walls of silence

Lost, judged and forsaken
Left to fade and fallen
Opened are these hollow years
Left to pass away

Distant is this heartbeat
Distant are those days
The test of time has passed away

Daylight, I saw you fade
You took me under, walked away
You left me stranded in this silence

These broken walls now show resolve
Outside Iâll run to the unknown
Iâll leave behind these walls of silence

Close these wounds left wide open
Close the scars of yesterday
Cover the skies with daylight
Close these wounds and walk away
