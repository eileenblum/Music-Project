Iâve seen inside your hollow hell
Drowned inside your wishing well
You say, you heal the wounded
You say, you showed the way
Losing ground, losing sight
Crown of sorrow made of thorns is bleeding lies

Canât find a way to ignore you
Iâve found a way of finding truth

Speak to me, donât dare speak for me
For I can see, your ashes blown away
I can see, the emptiness you breathe
So Iâll set free, your ashes blown away

These scars reflect my past life
These eyes opened to daylight
You said, youâll heal the broken
The pain, youâll cast away
Losing ground, losing sight
Your crown of nothing made of thorns is bleeding lies

Canât find a way to ignore you
Iâve found a way of finding truth

Speak to me, donât dare speak for me
For I can see, your ashes blown away
I can see, the emptiness you breathe
So Iâll set free, your ashes blown away

The way of no escape, the emptiness you see
That you see inside yourself, youâll never see in me
Your hollow crown of lies canât take me down
Breathing I wonât save you
