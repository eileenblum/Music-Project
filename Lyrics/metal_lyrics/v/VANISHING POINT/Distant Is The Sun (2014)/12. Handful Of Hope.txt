Another day, another game
Another cure for the pain
Another hollow era, hopeless drowning deep insane
Still I dream with a handful of hope

Another war, another lie, another year to live or to die
Another passing moment flickers to the calm or storm
Still I dream with a hand full of hope

How can we break the silence?
Blinded we are but shadows
How can we seize the day?
We stand on the edge

Another crash, another burn
Another way to live or learn
Another fight without a reason, all we do is sigh
Still I dream with a hand full of hope

How can we break the silence?
Blinded we are but shadows
How can we seize the day?
We stand on the
Edge of life we fall
Into the darkness
Stand alone, reach out
Can we hold much longer?
