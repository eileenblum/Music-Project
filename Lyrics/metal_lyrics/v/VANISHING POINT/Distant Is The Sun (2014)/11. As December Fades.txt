Rest the world inside my head
Empty this silence and bring it to end
Lead me through, guide me to see
Erase this struggle, within me

All that I am, all that I was inside
All that I feel has

Turned away, the fear and the strength within
Another empty lie
At the end, there is no more dying inside
Iâm free not afraid
As December fades

Rest the world inside my soul
Selfless Iâm learning what makes me whole
Awaken through another chapter done
I run through the night to the end of light
Erase this struggle, Iâve moved on

Turn away, the fear and the strength within
Another empty lie
At the end, there is no more dying inside
Iâm free not afraid
As December fades
