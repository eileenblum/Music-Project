Mother my inner shadow cries out to you
Insipid, worthless in your eyes
Are tired the years of suffering
I see the dying daylight fade to black
Give me strength, bring me peace
My innocence, I want it back

Did I fall into this illusion?
What has become?

You said youâd bring me shelter
You said youâd lead me to water
You said youâd break the chains that bind me, you denied me
You said youâd show me daylight, prove me the afterlife
Lay my soul, cleanse me, unbind me
Donât deny me deliverance

Father my inner sanctum hides within you
Carry me a shell of man
In you I seek salvation

I trip into this illusion
What has become?

You said youâd bring me shelter
You said youâd lead me to water
You said youâd break the chains that bind me, you denied me
You said youâd show me daylight, prove me the afterlife
Lay my soul, cleanse me, unbind me
Donât deny me deliverance

You said youâd bring me shelter and then you leave me
