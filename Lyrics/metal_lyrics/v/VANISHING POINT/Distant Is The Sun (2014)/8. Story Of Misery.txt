You breathe your life into my world
You bleed your blood into my soul
Abstained, broken, mirrored, entwined
You held my reflection

Mirrored I
Dying your heartbeat surrounds me
Taking life

How can I be the one you always blame?
See how you turn around, youâre still the same
I just donât understand, why canât you see?
Where has the love gone?
I just canât believe

Calm is your touch lifeless and broken
Wasted in years, I dream youâll awaken
Thereâs no more here, just a story of misery
Thereâs nothing here I can see

Mirrored I
Dying your heartbeat surrounds me
Taking life

How can I be the one you always blame?
See how you turn around, youâre still the same
I just donât understand, why canât you see?
Where has the love gone?
I just canât believe
