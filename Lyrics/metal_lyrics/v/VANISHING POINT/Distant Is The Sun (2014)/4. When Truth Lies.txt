Still is the sun that burns in my eyes
Ever flowing, never changing
Light takes me under

Free now I feel, no more am I the burden to you
Take in whatâs real, Iâve drawn the line
I wonât go back no more

What were you fighting for?

Polarized we are existing, in two different worlds
Where do we go from here?
I need to know
Dead inside and isolated, living in reverse
Where do we go from here?
I need to know

Dare to dream, dare to see, your vapid path is falling
Foreverâs a lie, why deny, open your eyes to what is real

Inside I walked through
The fire in you
When truth dies
It lies within you

What were you fighting for?
Who were you fighting for?

Polarized we are existing, in two different worlds
Where do we go from here?
I need to know
Dead inside and isolated, living in reverse
Where do we go from here?
I need to know
