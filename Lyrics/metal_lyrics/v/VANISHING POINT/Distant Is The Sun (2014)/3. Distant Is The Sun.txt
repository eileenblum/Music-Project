Wake the daylight, let it seep
Shut the clouds of grey away
Weightless is your memory
Hold it close, donât be afraid

Seal the pain and fight the hate
As the outside world is dying
Relive again, what fell to hate
Stop your inner world from dying again

How many times can you walk away
How many years can you give to crying
Who am I to know, the path below
Embrace now what you hold forever

How distant is the life
That was torn in your misery
Distant is the sun

Close your eyes, search inside
Walk from the shadows and walk to the light
Dare to dream or disappear

Grasp your existence and capture your fear
