Eyes forever seeing black, bring life into your lie
Seething in your serpent skin, in dust you divide me
Fooled, twisted, full of hate, torn in trusting me
Fear instilled forever lying the truth will set you free

Iâm on the other side
Clouded are your days
I give into new life
I begin

Let go the feelings within now
Iâll believe
Let go forever here and now
And Iâll believe

Torn in your memory, cast to the pits of black
Walk alone or with me, pull the daggers from my back
Hollow hearted, two faced, see the trust you stole from me
This fear you hold forever I with truth now will set you free

Iâm on the other side
Darkened are your days
I give in to new life
I begin

Let go the feelings within now
Iâll believe
Let go forever here and now
And Iâll believe
