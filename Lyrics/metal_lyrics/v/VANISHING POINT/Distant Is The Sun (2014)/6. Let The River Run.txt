I no longer, am lost within life now I see
The shadow of the man I used to be
Let flow the tears so I can see the river run
Let the river run

I remember, I remember life turning white to grey
As the years had passed, did you think to wait for me?
Did you hold me in your memory?
I fought this war alone

Pulling deeper in me, taking hold
Turning deeper is my face
Coming clearer, Iâm finding focus again

I no longer, am lost within life now I see
The shadow of the man I used to be
Let flow the tears so I can see the river run
Let the river run

Cleanse the path so I can see
This water running inside me
The tide has turned my bridge has burned
Donât leave me alone
Will you save me as I drift away?
In these wings that take me in
If you throw a lifeline to me
Will you give me life again?

I feel
I no longer, am lost within life now I see
The shadow of the man I used to be
Let flow the tears so I can see the river run
Let the river run
