Dead is the sound, devoid of healing
With every waking breath I drown, broken and bleeding

Your eyes deceive, your words like poison flow right through me
Release this silence, erase the fear that deafens my world

Iâve drawn this line within
So I can start this healing
Bring back the life within
This darkened heart denied to feel

Face to the ground, denied of healing
At every station of this cross nobody hears me

Iâve drawn this line within
So I can start this healing
Bring back the life within
This darkened heart denied to feel

Iâve drawn this line within my heart
Wishing my life back to the start
