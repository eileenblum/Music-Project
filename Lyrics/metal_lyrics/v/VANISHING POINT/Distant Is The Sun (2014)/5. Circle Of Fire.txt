These eyes see another day of burning
This life will make a stand or fall
These hands hold a broken world thatâs turning
This voice will not die alone

Will not die alone, will not die alone
Let light in

Donât fear the daylight, itâs rising
Walk with the fire as one
Donât fear the daylight keep fighting
Let light in
Walk with the fire

These hands built another empire falling
Itâs time to make a stand for all
These hands uphold the world from burning
Our voice will not die alone

Donât fear the daylight, itâs rising
Walk with the fire as one
Donât fear the daylight keep fighting
Let light in
Walk with the fire
