Whisper words of strength untold
Give me peace to rest my soul
Iâm forsaken for my virtue, mercy left me lost

If temptation leads to sin
Who's now hurting, who gives in
I'm mistaken for my virtue, mercy left me lost

Illusive grandeur, weakened life
Left unchallenged, justified
As I hope, I plead, salvation leads to paradise

The journey you made through your mind
Plays again, over and over
With space in your life you revealed
Truth abstained, over and over again

Now that heavens far away
I stand alone, yet feeling to stay
Innocence is surely breaking
Mercy has its cost

Life uncertain, yesterday
Is in ashes blown away
As I shed a tear, I'm finding out salvation is burning

The journey you made through your mind
Plays again, over and over
With space in your life you revealed
Truth abstained, over and over again

The journey you made through your mind
Plays again, over and over
With space in your life you revealed
Truth abstained, over and over...

Again, youâll find out where truth began
Oh, this journey has no end
Oh, this outcome is now in your hands
Will your truth reach the end
