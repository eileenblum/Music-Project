Gone are the days of not fully knowing
I think for a while
I fly for a while
I'm dreaming

The earth delights to feel your bare feet
For the wise to follow
I think of her smile
My heart beats for a while
I'm breathing

Each of us are angels
With only one wing
And we can only fly embracing
Each other within

I hope the day treats you kindly
Don't waste it by not smiling
Today... Today...

You move me in perfect ways
The special thought I wrapped with your name
I feel the change in my life
When I look in your eyes
I'm living

You found me in a crowd
And poured the love I'm giving now
I'm elevated

Each of us are angels
With only one wing
And we can only fly embracing
Each other within.. Each other within..

I hope the day treats you kindly
Don't waste it by not smiling
Today... Today...

Each of us are angels
With only one wing
And we can only fly embracing
Each other within.. Each other within..

I hope the day treats you kindly
Don't waste it by not smiling
Today... Today...

I hope the day treats you kindly
Don't waste it by not smiling
Today... Today...
