Moments of inner melancholia
I turn to you in memory
Symbolic visions in the withered wind
Have all but flown away

Distress signals from a golden age
Flow through these veins
Temptation haunting me to turn the page
Do I walk away

You said the past could never make you change
You said the distance and time will cause heartache
You said that there could never be a way for us

I know Iâm not the wonder in your eyes
I see the truth, but I could deny
This longing to belong is hurting me

Unveiled the faceless names of yesterday
In this sanctum bleed
Dreams dying eternally
Will I be free

The fallen leaves of autumn in my soul
Let the sky cloud my mind
The sun rises, a new day unfolds
What was left behind

You said the past could never make you change
You said the distance and time will cause heartache
You said that there could never be a way for us

I know Iâm not the wonder in your eyes
I see the truth, but I could deny
This longing to belong is hurting me

You said the past could never make you see
Knowing what hurt you, could have hurt me
I thought that there could be a way for us

I know Iâm not the wonder in your eyes
Iâve seen the truth but I could deny
This longing to belong is hurting me
I know I hold no glimmer in your eyes
I know the feelings are denied
If you take a chance in time you will see
Take a chance, take a chance, in time you will be free
Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance, in time you will see
