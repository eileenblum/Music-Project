Water fills my mind, hate contorts my vision
Senses disappear, Iâm left within decisions
Give me strength to breathe
The purpose is what I need to defeat
Binding perception running out of time

Can you feel the tension rise
Was I spared, did I survive
The cruel hand that feeds on life
Will forever take away our pride

We never know the end
But we still count the days
Not knowing, pretending
To be somebody else

Will we ever be content, weâre living
Will we ever see the unrest in our ways
If you look, youâll see, it will never be the same
I turn around, still lifeâs in front of me

You wake up with silence, your only friend
Uncertainty remains, if I disappear
Will my thoughts remain

Days collide
My heart divides
If Iâm not heard at least you know I tried

We never know the end
But we still count the days
Not knowing, pretending
To be somebody else

Will we ever be content, weâre living
Will we ever see the unrest in our ways
If you look, youâll see, it will never be the same
I turn around, lifeâs still in front of me

Will we ever be content, weâre living
Will we ever see the unrest in our ways
If you look, youâll see, it will never be the same
I turn around, lifeâs still in front of me
