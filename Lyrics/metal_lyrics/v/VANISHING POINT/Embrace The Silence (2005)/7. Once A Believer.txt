Time helped pass this world you left for me
Crucify my selfless sanity
That turned away, faith I had in you

Words cut deep, these wounds of misery
Your lies nailed my soul internally
Cast away, to your self made truth

Understanding what is lost
Thoughts and days unfold to black
Faded memories
Deep inside

I can't fight the walls inside, I once was a believer
Truth overlooks my life, why can't I believe
Cant climb these walls inside, I once was a believer
Is there truth within your lies
Why can't I believe

High and low I searched for answers, searched so endlessly
In the corners of your world, was there space for me
This crown of thorns on my life, spineless, so untrue
Shaken, my foundation shattered
And my trust in you

Understanding what is lost
Months and years unfold to black
That fade our memories
Deep inside

I can't fight the walls inside, I once was a believer
Truth overlooks my life, why can't I believe
Cant climb these walls inside, I once was a believer
Is there truth within your lies
Why can't I believe

Separation, frozen, timeless thoughts have gone by
Closeness, embraced by denial to these eyes
Revolution, giving hope from giving in
What will become, of answers denied that exist within

I can't fight the walls inside, I once was a believer
Truth overlooks my life, why can't I believe
Cant climb these walls inside, I once was a believer
Is there truth within your lies
Why can't I believe
