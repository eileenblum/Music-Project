Inside my heart thereâs questions
I donât know where to start
It seems that every time I grasp heaven
In my hands there is your heart

When my eyes are closed, your face I see
With your arms open, I am set free
In paradise Iâm lost within
Breathing, begin, Iâm living

Hours turn to days, at times I feel one
Iâm drowning in what seems, embraced eternally

Fly in circles in my dreams
Cry a new day will begin
Surround my mind, surround my soul
Cast away your fears outside
Give me sight to see inside
Finally I see the truth, Iâm lost within you

Iâm jealous of the sun
That sees you everyday
And of the moon that watches you sleep the night away
Finally temptation leaves me
To overcome my fear
Inside my soul, I've lost control of sight that was so clear

Hours turn to days, at times I feel one
Iâm drowning in what seems, embraced eternally

Fly in circles in my dreams
Cry a new day will begin
Surround my mind, surround my soul
Cast away your fears outside
Give me sight to see inside
Finally I see the truth, Iâm lost within you

Hours turn to days, at times I feel one
Iâm drowning in what seems, embraced eternally

Fly in circles in my dreams
Cry a new day will begin
Surround my mind, surround my soul
Cast away your fears outside
Give me sight to see inside
Finally I see the truth, Iâm lost within you
Lost within you..
