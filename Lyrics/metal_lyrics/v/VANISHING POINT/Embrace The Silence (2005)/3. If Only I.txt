Silence that dawned forever
Drowning inside
Days passed into a lifetime
Inner minds collide

Washed of my sins forever
I turn back the tide
Of the years fallen to waste foreseen
By countless eyes

Fear inside, changing time
As I dream, faceless figures are watching me

If only I could run far away
If only I saw the corners of your mind
If only I ran from yesterday
If only I escaped to the other side

Denied envisioned mercy
I dare to find
To disguise, the meaning hiding
In my life, in my eyes

Dying unto this world
Blinding my eyes to see
Ever changing, re-arranging
Pieces of my memory

Fear inside, changing time
As I dream, faceless figures are watching me

If only I could run far away
If only I saw the corners of your mind
If only I ran from yesterday
If only I escaped to the other side

Fear inside, changing time
As I dream, faceless figures are watching me

If only I could run far away
If only I saw the corners of your mind
If only I ran from yesterday
If only I escaped to the other side
