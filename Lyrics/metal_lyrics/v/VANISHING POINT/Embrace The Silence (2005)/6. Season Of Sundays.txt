Take a look mankind, what have we done
Walk on silent, what has become
This age we lead that leaves regret
We move forward and we forget
Look now mankind, what has become

See in these eyes a broken man
In worlds different, who understands
What justice have you to take away
The innocence of yesterday
See now mankind, who understands

I fall to your knees, I crash to the ground
As I cry out your name, I didn't hear a sound
If your view ever changes, I hope one day it will
Until a phoenix rises, I stand still

Guide me father, what can be done
You have the answers, I want the truth
Can I forget what engraved my mind
Can I rebuild what I had inside
Tell me father, tell me the truth

Look now mother, what can be done
In time life changed under this sun
That never sets in this gray sky
Where everyone's attempt to try
Tell me mother, what can be one

I fall to your knees, I crash to the ground
As I cry out your name, I didn't hear a sound
If your view ever changes, I hope one day it will
Until a phoenix rises, I stand still

As I fall to your knees, I crash to the ground
As I cry out your name, oblivious to sound
If your view someday changes, I hope today it will
Until that moment, until the truth, until mind rest
Until itâs in you, until the spirit flies into forever

Until the phoenix rises, I stand still
Until the phoenix rises, I stand still
Until the phoenix rises, I stand still
