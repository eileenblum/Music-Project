Faceless eyes watch over me
Surrounding my perception into fear
In the days of dark I sheltered truth
Viewing through transparent words you speak

The change in me
Closed doors to a darkened past
My soul set free
Beyond these eyes

Release me, set me free
Unchain this past, unchain me
Cold are the years, inside you
Inside me, do you see
The peace denied, the peace set free
Light shines through dark I lived in you

Reality emotionless
Insisting to believe never what is true
Denying scars that bleed in you
Donât deny the scars that heal the truth

The change you see
Closed doors to a darkened past
My soul set free
Beyond your eyes

Release me, set me free
Unchain this past, unchain me
Cold are the years, inside you
Inside me, do you see
The peace denied, the peace set free
Light shines through dark I lived in you

Release me, set me free
Unchain this past, unchain me
Cold are the years, inside you
Inside me, do you see
The peace denied, the peace set free
Light shines through dark I lived in you
