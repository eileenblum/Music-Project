Give me a moment I can freeze in time
Give me the passion that was in your eyes
Speak empty words to warm my heart
Show me reasons why we fall apart

Give me the sun to warm my soul
My thoughts are blackened, I have lost control
Hear me cry your name inside
These walls that you confide in

If now will be forever
These oceans Iâve drowned deep in you will make time
Move back the years I lost

Somebody come save me, in these days of innocence
Somebody come save me, where I thought my life would end
Somebody come save me, shadowed by what now is lost
Somebody come save me, leave the past forever is it gone

Holding out waiting for a sign
My faith in you has died
Whisper words in harmony
Give me time to believe

If now is all or never,
These oceans Iâve drowned deep in you will make time
Move back the years I lost

Somebody come save me, in these days of innocence
Somebody come save me, where I thought my life would end
Somebody come save me, shadowed by what now is lost
Somebody come save me, leave the past forever is it gone
is it gone.. Oh is it gone..

If now is all or never,
These oceans Iâve drowned deep in you will make time
Move back the years I lost

Somebody come save me, in these days of innocence
Somebody come save me, where I thought my life would end
Somebody come save me, shadowed by what now is lost
Somebody come save me, leave the past forever is it..

Somebody save me, somebody save me, somebody save me from life
I feel like someone's helped me
I feel like someone's helped me through
Someone has helped me, I feel I need someone like you
