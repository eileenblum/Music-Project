If life is overrated, empty space in me
This twisted mortal coil denied inside of me
I pushed away my anger, psychoanalyzed
I lived my years, I lived them deep in your lies

I see a new sunrise
I felt the emptiness
The light before my eyes, breathing into my life

Give into light, give into dark
When outside is jaded, we all fall apart
Shelter my world, rebuild my mind
I rise above, tomorrow's no end

Regret lasts forever, time is life's enemy
I began a new day of discovery
Chained I'm locked inside you

Release this memory
These open wounds unleashed inside of you and me

I see a new sunrise
I felt the emptiness
The light before my eyes, breathing into my life

Give into light, give into dark
When outside is jaded, we all fall apart
Shelter my world, rebuild my mind
I rise above, tomorrow's no end

Give into light, give into dark
When outside is jaded, we all fall apart
Shelter my world, rebuild my mind
I rise above, tomorrow's no end
