Does it matter if these feelings are gone
Are we moving on
Or do words mean nothing anymore

All the honesty left behind
I canât trust you no more
I donât want to be second anymore

Thereâs a comfort in finding love
Your soul feels at home
Youâll never believe how close we've come

A world that whispers
No thorn in my side
Iâll fly to the sun
That wonât burn my eyes
Faith can move mountains
No force is implied
Silent stars passing
The answers to life

Hold onto the secrets of dreams and desires
The secret is so hard to find
The secret is found in her eyes

I guess my pride has got the best of me
The pain is still strong
Your storyâs complete, mines far from done
Take a bow, Iâm no angels son
I have faith in me
We are like leaves, we change and fall

A world that whispers
No thorn in my side
Iâll fly to the sun
That wonât burn my eyes
Faith can move mountains
No force is implied
Silent stars passing
The answers to life

Hold onto the secrets of dreams and desires
The secret is so hard to find
The secret is found in her eyes

Hold onto the secrets of dreams and desires
The secret is so hard to find
The secret is found in her eyes

Hold onto the secrets of dreams and desires
The secret is so hard to find
The secret is found in her eyes
