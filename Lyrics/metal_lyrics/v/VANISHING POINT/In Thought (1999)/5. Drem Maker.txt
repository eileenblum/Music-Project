A point without any purpose
A myth without any intention
My hands offer solace and guidance
The stray will find comfort in my touch

A tear that has fallen aside you
The breath that will be desired
Deny your resistance to come forth
Proceed into the province of my mind

Dream alone or dream with me
Shadows that will set us free
Close your eyes, delve deep within
Brace yourself as they pull you back in

Dream alone or dream with me
Shadows that will set us free
Clsoe your eyes delve deep within
Soon someday we shall all be set free
