Thoughts fill your mind
But you don't know you're thinking
You're trying hard
But it's too late for change
Now you can only look forward to tomorrow
Forget the past, leave behind
All of your sorrows and pain

Once you fly you die
Then you learn to live
Once you take, you keep on taking
Never learn to give
Once you're thrown into the water
You will turn to stone
Once you're blind you see
much more than you realise
You're not the only one

[CHORUS]
I see it now
The walls are closing in
I don't know how, I don't know
where to begin
I'd die for love
Is love worth dying for?
You're not the only one
You're not the only one

Thoughts filled your time
You didn't know you were sinking
You closed you eyes,
and all your dreams were gone
Get up on your feet again and learn to see
You're not the only one
