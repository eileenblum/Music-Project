We move swiftly without a warning
We veer closer towards discoveries
In a step we find consequences beckoning
Throughout time we divide
what's ours to keep

Within a shadow of a distant mourning
Resides a man without integrity
Concealed impressions cloth words
yet to be spoken
Wide eyes encourage new light
into obscure desires

Looking through 
Hazy windows
Disillusioned
Disappointed

And I know there is time for another chance
Enchanting voices encompass the night
And I know that I'll journey to another place
To find out exactly where I went wrong

Sunlit windows forever
Clearer paths we'll find
Sunlit windows forever
With our hearts we'll climb

Restless seas collide
