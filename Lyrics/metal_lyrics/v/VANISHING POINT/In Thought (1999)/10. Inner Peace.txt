Falling, my feet on the ground
I descend from inner peace
No one sought to understand my
Outlook to life, what I see

Nothing is pure anymore
With open eyes, I ask why
I can't pretend, can't believe
Forever is gone, it's you I see

Standing in a room with no view
Trying to gain my inner peace

I won't change, won't give in
To your empty words, your life in grey
I cleansed my hands, stopped my fear
You're in my past but won't disappear

What choice do I have, but to leave you alone
The choice you had, was to leave me alone
There's no more I can do
But to deal with, deal with the truth

Standing in a room with no view
Trying to gain my inner peace
I close my eyes, open my mind
And visualise true harmony

Standing in a room with no view
Standing in a room that's next to you
Trying to gain my inner peace
I close my eyes, open my mind
I close my eyes blinding time
And visualise true harmony
