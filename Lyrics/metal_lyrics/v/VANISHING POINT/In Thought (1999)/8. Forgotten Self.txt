In my wake I see a sullen sky
Chase away, past themes
into some other sphere
Flowing with time in an unfamiliar scene
Ascertain, reach out,
to discover where from here

Withdraw conclusions
in an attempt to open doors
Cast out all theories to create destiny
Allude to people held up
away above their call
Appraise no one, but be faithful
to everyone of us all

In my attempts, i've tried
To run away and hide
From all life's mysteries
In this solitary state
If only time would wait
To heal my wounds in silence

Waiting for a new change
I can't remember my life
I don't know who I am
