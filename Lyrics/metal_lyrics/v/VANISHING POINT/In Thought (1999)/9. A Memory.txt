Sometimes I sit alone in solitude
I wonder how or why it all went wrong
The choices that I've made,
that sent me down a lonely road
A desolate path that seems so long

Another moment for the memory
Another year I've left behind
Another day is turning into night
Overshadowing my mind
As I lie awake in wonder
Another dream becomes so strong
And for the moment
I'd like to turn back time
For all the things that I'd done wrong

Scattered photographs lay dormant
Depicting that I'll never be the same
Classify the times I've had
They're about to be erased
Without you I'm left to blame

I hear it calling
That memory
Why is this hurting
Inside of me
The cries that were heard
Withered and died
Images of you, that left you behind
A Memory

I stand alone amongst the shame
With no one else to share the blame
I take a look inside I'll see
That what I'm touching can't be me
I feel the fire burn within
I'm living a a life in total sin

I'm suffering in silence
Can't anyone hear my cries
