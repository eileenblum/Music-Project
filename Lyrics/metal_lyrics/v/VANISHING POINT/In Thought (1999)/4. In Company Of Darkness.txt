Waiting for an illuminous dream
to light the darkest day
Confusing situations distract
the words I have to say
Paralysed by a vision blinded
in it's quest to see me fall
Empty rooms filled with moving shadows
that gently grace the wall

Words in disarray
Illusions so far away

In company of darkness
I find myself lost along the way

Challenged through the deciding winds
that are bottled deep within
Getting closer to the fear
that only I have seen
Through the dark and scenic views
lies a mystic stone
And upon it had read that you are not alone

Worlds in disarray
Illusions so far away
