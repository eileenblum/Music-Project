Images obscured by clouded visions
To know you're dreams aren't always clear
Lifeless days gone by
I can't describe the meaning of life,
I can't see why

In time you'll see
The things you want to see
In time I'll hear
I can remember the time when
the point of view
Vanished from my mind

Taken away lost in the eyes of tranquliity
Moving closer to the Vanishing Point
Visions and memories I now call my own
The meaning of life is still, still left unknown
