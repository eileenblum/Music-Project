Look beyond the mirrors reflections
Journey past walls,
that encage the right to be free
There's always someone watching
Transcend high
Obtain a better view from above

Through the looking glass I see
Traces of lost centuries
Still remains of what life used to be

We've paved the way,
nothing can be changed
Forever chasing lies
Chapters left without a name
We've turned the page of history
And closed the door behind
There lies a fear within, I'll carry on

Through the looking glass I see
Climpses of prosperity
A chance to restore of
what's been mising

Flashes of sacred visions
I've never seen with my own eyes
Writings revealing reason
Define the truth amongst the lies
Flashes of sacred visions
I've never seen with my own eyes
Throughout the change in season
I've never heard the children cry
