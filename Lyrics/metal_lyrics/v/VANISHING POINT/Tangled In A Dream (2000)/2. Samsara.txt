Seen it all before,
you've seen the rise beneath the fall
Seen it all before,
you've seen my back against the wall

A timeless energy, tears a sultry eye
Now in turn despair becomes divine
The changes in yourself,
you've yet to embrace
In the last passing breath,
I took my first taste

Living in slow motion,
it seems your world is standing still
I see, I breathe, I know, I speak, like you

To your life,
timed by the moving grains of sand
Close your eyes,
feel the lifeline in your hand
Search for the words,
relate to what you feel
Don't let seclusion be your own ideal
