In the silence I hear a call
A childlike cry of innocence
Overcome by a guiding light,
but I just want to rest

Cascading shadows appear
Breaking through a whirpool
of broken dreams
A merciless hand wipes the tears
from my eyes as whispers turn into screams

As I close my eyes
The vivid rain, enclouds my momory
If I'm dreaming don't wake me
I will rise so easily
As i close my eyes outside the world,
lies in yesterday
If I'm dreaming I will wake

Breaking promises, breaking hearts
A mind has been led astray
Alone you walk a misguided path
that no-one dares to stay
Can I bring something back
with me to show I was really there?
And as I awake beside myself
lost within my stare
