Feel the lines, across my face
I felt the many years erased
Feel the pulse on life I've known
It's sojourn tears I taste

View into your world and see
Seek an unborn day
With your heart and mind and soul
Your will, will find our way

Past left of centre, what I am
Could you understand?
If your the outsider viewing in

You'll never know
The shades of life, unless you open your mind
You fear change
So bring on the rain

Is the silence, my only cure?
As thoughts start to grey
Your touch that covered me
Now remains in yesterday

The sea between you and I
Moves in perfect forms serene
The distance from me to you
A million miles unseen
