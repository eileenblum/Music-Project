Just because I listen to your views
Dosen't mean that I agree
When I don't stand up to you
Doesn't mean that I am weak

What would it prove before your eyes
Secrets unfold of pain
Still you wonder in your world
You search your soul insane
I'm hurting again

Another broken promise
Another broken truth
See how much I'm hurting
Till I see the real you
When the tears fell from my eyes
Didn't mean I cried for you
When you had to go away
I had to always wait for you

Now you see before your eyes
Your boy become a man
Still you wonder in your world
Refuse to understand
Come on take my hand
