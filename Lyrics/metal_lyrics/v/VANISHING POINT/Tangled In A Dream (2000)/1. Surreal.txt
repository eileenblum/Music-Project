Am I in a dream?
This looks a perfect scene
My will remains but I am falling
Tell me where I am
Will I understand?
The mystery that is surrounding

Uncertainty remains, views left unchanged
A pure heart is now stained

Could it be so real
Seek the truth beyond perception
Life left unanswered
Will I find what I am looking for?

Take this mystery
Turn and set it free
Endure the pain when it's bursting
Images surreal
A hate you cannot feel
It's all revealed as the days are unfolding

Rise above don't wait
Decide your own fate
Look far beyond the truth that is lying
I've come to understand
As an optomistic man
That one day I'll find all the answers
