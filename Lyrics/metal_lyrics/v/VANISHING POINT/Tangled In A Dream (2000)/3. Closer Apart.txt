Clsoer, moving in on a certain opinion
You realise that it's hard to compromise
your own ideals
Inside a circle hides a line,
within a day a moment is lost in time
Whenever you're near me,
I'm so far away

Can you speak to me?
Tomorrow I may learn to see
The truth inside is hard to find
You turn me away

Find a way through your mind
To leave your memories far behind
Just let go
Don't be my shadow

Seconds too late,
is there time allowed for my escape?
Am i left here drowning
in the words that you speak?
Behind a curious stare,
lies the reason why you don't care
If ever you need me, I'll be so far away

Can you listen to me?
Tomorrow you may learn to see
The truth inside you'll never find
You pushed me away

Am I afraid of my emotions?
Counting days I had to find myself
I listened to the words you had to say
Giving into you,
isn't worth the price I'll have to pay
