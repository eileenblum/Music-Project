I can feel you near, in control
You've taken my mind please spare my soul
Left alone to cleanse the night
Forge what's right, sanctify

How can I be to blame?
It's been done now the wounds still remain
Crucify and deny me
Static, silent, just let me breathe

Stand alone where life is safe
Is it all a big mistake?
Somehow the hurting is over

Can't stand the pain, walk away
Leave me virtue for another day
Trapped inside there's no way out of here
Scared, am I dead? I just wnat to be free

Stand the test of time, don't walk away
Once its happned it's here to stay
Is it worth the waiting?
I know healing takes time,
but I'll never walk away, never walk away

Illusions can be real
Just look at me and I will show you understanding
We may seldom find, a place where we
can hide away from our dreams

I don't remember,
I don't believe
My eyes have been decieved
Can't take my sorrow
The past is my tommorrow
Wake me on the other side

I am here to stay
Another day has passed
Now hear me calling
I need some time
To take what's mine
I will never walk away
