What makes you wake up in the morning?
Who gives you strength to carry on?
Why do you play blind to the warning?

Why do you let your head hang low
Why do you feel you're all alone?
Why should you be the last to know?

I won't look into the mirror today
It's been such a long long time
Won't make a difference if I believe
I'm dancing with the devil

Why do you fear to speak your mind?
All of your dreams are locked inside
You never tried trusting me

Why do you feel you don't belong?
What makes you think you're always wrong
Take a chance, one last dance
