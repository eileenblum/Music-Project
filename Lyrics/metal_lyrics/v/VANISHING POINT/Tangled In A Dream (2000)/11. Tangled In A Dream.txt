Tell me what's on your mind
what can you feel?
Recall transcending times, get so real
Reaching voices guided far away
Through pitch blackness 
to the dawn of new days

Questions left unanswered
often wondered why
Looking at this world
through transparent eyes

Search through memories
that didn't care
I hear laughter give
its one last stare

So tell me where we are?
And how we came so far
Awake me from this dream
