Hope has fallen, hope will rise I remember, a paradise
Expose my heart, left to rust
Mankind buried in the dust Emotions, entwined,
what will it take? (7 years)

7 years you took your time
Reluctant thoughts went through your mind
Justify wour will to live
I'll justify my soul I'll give

7 years you took a life unknown
From this boy now to a man alone, man alone

Thought that I could fly
Father forgive me I was once your child
Mother remembered me

Words of wisdom, untold truth
Restless ways, I lived my youth
Resurect trust in time
Resurect faith with time
