Stone, cold, appearance
A change of time
Try, to embrace
Me those frosty hands of yours
Darkness falls in your eyes
As I whisper his name
Past obliges you to fall
On your knees
Hate will abandon me
I will prevail
Season of grace
See the healers
I, stand, corrected
While you wind
Down, low, suspended
In all your might you fall
No more pain from the past
This is what it was thought
Past obliges you to fall
On your knees
