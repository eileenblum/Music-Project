Blessed are those
Who wash their robes
That they may have the right
To the tree of life
And may go through
The gates into the city
Outside are the dogs,
Those who practice magic arts, the sexually immoral,
The murderers, the idolaters
And everyone who loves
And practices falsehood
I Jesus, have sent my angel to give
You this testimony for the churches
I am the root and of the offsping of
David and the bright morning star
