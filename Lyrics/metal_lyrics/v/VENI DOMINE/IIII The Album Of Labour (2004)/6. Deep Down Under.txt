Deep down under, deep down under
The boiling surface loud like thunder
The fear of being left alone
Deep down under, deep down under
The spoken mission clear like water
A hole that once contained a vision
Deep down under
The famous space inside the human race
Deep down under, deep down under
My disbelievings numb like stones
The fire that once begun is still aglow
The famous space inside the human race
Is not over until we change our ways
I fell down before his feet
A sinner willing to proclaim his defeat
I knew he saw through all my lies
I was judge through the tears in his eyes
