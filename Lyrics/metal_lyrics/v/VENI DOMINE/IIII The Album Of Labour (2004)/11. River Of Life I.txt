Then the angel showed me
The river of the water of life
As clear as crystal,
Flowing from the throne of god
And of the lamb down the middle
Of the great street of the city
On each side of the river
Stood the tree of life
Bearing twelve crops of fruit
Yielding its fruit every month
And the leaves of the tree
Are for the healing of the nations
No longer will there be any curse
The throne of god
And the lamb
Will be in the city
And his servants will serve him
They will see his face
And his name
Will be on their foreheads
There will be no more night
They will not
Need the light of a lamp
Or the light of the sun
For the lord
God will give them light
And they will reign
Forever and ever
