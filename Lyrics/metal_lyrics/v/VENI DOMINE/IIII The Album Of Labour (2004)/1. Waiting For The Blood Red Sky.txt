Will you hear my blood crying from the earth?
Like you did with Abel
Will you dress me up in white like it says
In the revelations
The process has already begun
I'm waiting for the blood red sky
The shining that will light the night
I am sad to say that the shallow holds
The throne in our hearts
I am late to say that the fall of love
Will launch the fall of man
It's a sign - always fulfilling ourselves
It's a sign - our demands cueing the world
I'm waiting for the blood red sky
The shining that will light the night
I'm waiting for the quickening
A sign to make it all begin
