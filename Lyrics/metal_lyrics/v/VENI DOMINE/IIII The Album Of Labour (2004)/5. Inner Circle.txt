We formed the world together
We stood the test of time
We brought in new dimensions
Of how high we could climb
The fall the fall
You gave a new proposal
You slayed the ancient codes
You forced in new restrictions
You fooled the neighborhood
Join the inner circle
You wasted and condemned
Join the inner circle
Don't hide what has descended
There was a slight disturbance
There was a living lie
There was a close encounter
There was live or die
