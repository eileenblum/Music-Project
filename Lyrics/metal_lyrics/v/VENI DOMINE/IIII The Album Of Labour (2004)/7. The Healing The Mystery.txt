I lock my door as the sun does rise
As I observe the things that I despise
I write down all the things I see
I check my notes they're describing me
My tears of joy are sad to you
I can't feel hope like you do
I always pray that the light will stay
To light my soul, my soul is grey
See the tears in my eyes they won't tell you no lies
As you read my history
See my fears go away as you taught me to pray
The healing, the mystery
If I could choose what I would do
I'd stay in bed the whole life through
The shiver me life once gave
Is as exciting as my future grave
I gaze alone at the setting sun
I know today that I have won
