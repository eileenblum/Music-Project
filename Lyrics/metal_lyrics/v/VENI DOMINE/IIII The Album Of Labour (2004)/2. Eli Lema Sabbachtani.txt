I'm addicted
To the stress on this planet
So much I need to know
I'm addicted
To just scratching the surface
Emotions put on hold
Deep dark eyes are surfing the net
It's not me, it's my silhouette
Spirit's shy I wonder why
Eli lema sabachtani
Wind will cry as we deny
Eli lema sabachtani
I'm addicted
To be seen as a winner
An infection in the brain
I'm addicted
To the news that delivers
Hell and massive pain
A feast for evil, mankind sleeping
Far beyond our walls they're weeping
