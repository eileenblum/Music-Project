Two of the dead I saw in my head
Witness of crimes historical times
You drew the lines that taught us the signs
Lines are erased future is faced
The wind can't sweep away the prints
Of us who didn't see the hints
Are you aware the guilt we share
A cross we bare
Are you in peace as love will cease
A deadly disease
The doom is at hand the doom of man
Haste to repent angels are sent
Preparing it all the final call
Waiting to free things unseen
Static to wild wrath of a child
The sky will fall and crush the earth
The kings, the fools will curse this birth
With bleeding hands to save ourselves
A cross we draw sleep too long
Too late to save our burning foe
