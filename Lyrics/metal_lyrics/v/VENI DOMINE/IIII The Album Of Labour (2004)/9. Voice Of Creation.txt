Airwaves confirm you known by your name
Register movements it's like a computer game
Information overload - pipelines to my brain
Is my inside to explode - none to keep me sane
Implanted disbelieves fulfilled damnation
Improve and then disceive
Voice of creation will revenge
Not even one word of integrity
Life as a free man is all history
Override digital sky - corrupt the endless stream
I will die I cannot hide - in this 16-bit dream
In my slumber falling deep
The day turns into night
Echoes try my thoughts to keep
Decay, slowly bright
