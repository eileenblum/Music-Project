[Music / Lyrics by TorbjÃ¦rn WeinesjÃ¦]

I stand and watch the sea
The storm is watching me
I know the end is near
Yet I don't feel the fear

I see the face of an ancient king

I stand and close my eyes
As the world hears my sighs
My friends, now enemies
My case is clear to see

The storm that came this day was no surprise
The book of life revealed before my eyes

Alone I stand when all is gone
Riddle of eternity
Alone I stand, it's the sign of the times
Alone I stand when all is gone
Riddle of eternity

I stand and hear what's said
I see one shake his head
He's not wearing a crown
So I watch him drown

His fall, a thorn in my side, I cry

What would you do
If your eyes grew darkened
For what you had chosen to see
If you knew what would happen
Wich sights would you chose
Or just say it can't happen to me
Is it that we live in a dream
'Cause the real world is too frightening to see
Is the price too high to pay today
So we'll wait 'till tomorrow
To see if we can barter us free

So we sleep like a child
So we sleep like a child
So we sleep
