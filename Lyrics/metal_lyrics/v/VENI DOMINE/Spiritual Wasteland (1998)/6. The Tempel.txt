[Music / Lyrics by TorbjÃ¦rn WeinesjÃ¦]

Somewhere there's a gathering
In a place where time exist
The aisle of finest marble
And walls of purest gold

Be quiet don't speak
Hear the silence whispering the secrets
Hear the walls echo dreams from the past

Be still, your in the temple
Of Gods spirit, try to understand
Whispers straight to the heart

Precious is the time you give
Precious is the life you live
Cleanse your soul, your thoughts
They will revive, so alive
Thoughts they will revive

The walls are still speaking
Telling no lies
In the temple
The walls are still screaming
Open your eyes
In the temple

Be quiet don't speak
You are in the temple, time to learn to breathe
Portrait the saviour, there's a crown to receive

Lock the door, toss the key
The fool of death, down on his knees
Wants to pray, wants to stay
Don't let him in
His lounge could easily sweep you away

Act with dignity
You're an heir to the King of kings
Who's message you bear deep down within

Sweet as honey is the fruit of life
Sweet as honey, bitterness will lie
Fill your halls with jewels that never die
Jewels that never die
