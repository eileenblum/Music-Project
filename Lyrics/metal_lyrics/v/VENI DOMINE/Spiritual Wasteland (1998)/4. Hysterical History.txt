[Music / Lyrics by Fredrik Ohlsson]

Watching
From a static view
One password
Enter, and proceed
Pale light
Burns my starring eyes
I'm inside
A new reality

The world is like a spinning wheel
Of high technology
I have lost my sense to feel
What is haunting... me?

Slaving
Under knowledge of
Destruction
Defeated by machine
Change me
Is there a living God
To save me
From synthetic dreams?

Hysterical years of madness
Artificial tears of sadness

The world is like a spinning wheel...

The system tells me what to think
Solution is mind control
Undress my values through the "link"
A life beyond recall

The world is like a spinning wheel
Of high technology
Lost in a vision so unreal
Some one, hear me!
