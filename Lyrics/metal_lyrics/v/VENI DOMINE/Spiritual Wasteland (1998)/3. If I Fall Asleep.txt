[Music / Lyrics by TorbjÃ¦rn WeinesjÃ¦]

These walls are made of glass
Not concrete as they seems
What is wrong with this picture

Behold a gilded frame
Conceals the life within
How is it that no one ever sees

The depth of the colour of the blood red heart
Yet always sees the mask

Who sees behind your eyes
The thoughts that dwell within
The man behind the name
Is like the dead walking

If I fall asleep
Will I wake up in a brand new eden
Where water falls make the only noise I'll know

The heart is far away
Where life begins and ends
With a longing far stronger than failures left behind

Time is for healing
Blending past within future hopes
Performing is every thing
Yet slowly westward sinking

If I fall asleep
Will I wake up in a brand new eden
Where water falls make the only noise I'll know
Watch me fall asleep
I don't mind what ever you see
The golden halls of eden call within

The eyes of the world are watching your back
Wispers in silence the things that you lack
Twisted the souls, of those who bring it into light
The warmth of their hearts like a cold winter night

Watch me fall asleep...
