[Music / Lyrics by TorbjÃ¦rn WeinesjÃ¦]

In the darkness of the alley
Speaks the silence of the grave
But the eyes of my spirit
See the shades that seek the brave

The demons haunt the innocence
Of the souls once astray
Tortured by the face of darkness
In hope to fail their way

Death is all around
Been there since the dawn of time

Hear the pounding of the secrets
That is buried deep inside
Like the tales deep in the sacred
That spread diseases wide

Fatal is the shape of him
Who is waiting at the shrine
Serving us the fruit of knowledge
Stolen since the dawn of time

I want to see
Those of you who long to be free
I've seen the one
No need to cry
He will dry the tears from your eyes
With a steady hand
He will lead you to the promised land

Death is all around
Been there since the dawn of time
There is murder in the air
Been there since the dawn of time
