[Music / Lyrics by Fredrik Ohlsson]

It's been one day or two
I can't really remember
Watching the world alone
Behind my iron curtain

Waiting for the silence
Protected, safe from violence

Through streets made of stone
Souls cry, dies beyond
Knowledge of the quest
Where grief comes to rest

Poor life spins the thread
Things remain unsaid

Despising my sorrow, this life I have chosen
In fear of what could be

Sometimes I'm aware
Of someone standing close to me
A presence, one caress
Who knows my loneliness

Someone is knocking on my door
Someone is knocking on my door

It's been one day or two
I can't really remember
In hope the masses rise
But who's the hand that guide them

Longing for reliance

This frightened soul of mine
Turns wistful in the sight of grace
The presence, the caress
Will make my heart confess

Someone is knocking on my door
Someone, a serpent from before
Yet someone, the lament for the poor
Just one, will rise and one will fall
Someone is knocking on my door
