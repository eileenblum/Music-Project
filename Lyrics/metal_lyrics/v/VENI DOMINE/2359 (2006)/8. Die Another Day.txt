This day was black,
There was something in the air
I felt a notion pierce my heart
The day was marked,
And I knew it all too well
This day was chosen from the start

And the wind just kept on blowing
And the holy was preparing a new song

Die another day
Wishing you would stay
Die another day
I wish it all away

What can I do to make the mighty one answer?
Will you heal me as before?
What can I say to ease the pain, to explain?
The velvet touch is no comfort anymore

I feel the angels all around me
Parade of light, in respect, the fading day

So high, so low
So far away
A void too great to ever fill again
Tear me down and build me up again

Die another day
