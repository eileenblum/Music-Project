You ask, I answer
You canât believe
Makes me a liar
Trust in me leaves or
Trust in you leaves or
No trust in me or
No trust for me

Explain the holy
Explain my calling
Convinced by nature
We rise, still falling

In times of doubt just seek your soul
And find the treasure
Leading to the place that will weigh and measure

Our wages in heaven,
Patience receive
New stages to heaven,
Patience receive

Weâll search forever
To enter the light
It lays wide open
Still we touch the night

In times of doubt just seek your soul
And find the treasure
Leading to the place that will weigh and measure

Our wages in heaven,
Patience receive
New stages to heaven,
Patience receive
Our wages in heaven,
Patience receive
No boundaries in heaven,
Patience receive
