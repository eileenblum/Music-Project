I can hear the sound of emptiness
Inside, inside
Echoes from my time in the wilderness
Inside, inside
I still breathe the pain, unconsciousness
Inside, inside
I fall restless into the void

All I can see is lifeâs animation projected into my senses
Laughter and tears welded in seamlessly into my imagination

A life out of shape the misty surroundings,
There is no progress
So where does it lead?
I look down the road, no signs
No clues to guide my way home

Just the touch of the Holy Ghost
Fingertip onto my frozen being
Felt a warmth, a burning fire
Through my frosty landscape
A change of season, I see it now

I know this game
The frozen pain
Nothing to gain
From this way of living

I know this scenario from my own lifetime
It happens over and over again
I donât want to hide, thereâs too much at stake
I try to guide but you will decide

The touch
The holy
The frozen
The frosty
So warm
So burning
I donât want to hide
