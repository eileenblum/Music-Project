Give me a hyper sober nature

Iâm so weary from all the information
I cannot digest it all
No space, no place to store the contamination
Of my fully loaded soul

Oh I ask you my Lord
Let me levitate

Give me a hyper sober nature

I donât need what all are selling
It takes the focus off my mind
I donât need someone thatâs telling me
The things that I left behind

Oh I ask you my Lord
Let me levitate
Or at least just elevate
To a higher ground
