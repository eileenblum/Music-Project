See the straying man
Feel the pain at hand
Alone is not our course
Our path is still remorse

So here we are
We found our way
We gave it all
To meet again

We kept our pride
Away with the lies
Brothers in truth
Brothers for life

The pressure to stay pure
The burden to adore
Illusions made by man
The serpentâs giving hand

Who will throw the first stone
Who will ignore the wounded
Who will betray our friendship
We will not throw the first stone

See the dying man
Feel the dying pain
Life will wait ahead
And time will beat death

Brothers, the years are passing by
Remember the early days
When things were black and white
