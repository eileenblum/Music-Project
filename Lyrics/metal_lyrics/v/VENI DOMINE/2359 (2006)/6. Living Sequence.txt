Unify the cradle
Escalate in flight
Form a living sequence
Sheltered by the night

On and on the sequence goes on (and on)
On and on devaluation be done

We all lay dying still
We pretend weâre living
We all fulfill our dreams
But the harsh light of day
Will give our game away

Saints are being baptized
In the corridors of faith
Religion of the power
Control with no debate

On and on the sequence goes on (and on)
On and on degradation be done

On and on
On and on
