Inside me now
A light somehow
For you Iâll bow

Like Iâm crucified
When you look inside my heart
Revealing all the stains and pains

Pray and receive
The dark will leave
Do you believe?

Like Iâm crucified
When you look inside my heart
Forgiving all my stains and pains

He will return
We all will learn
That all sin will burn

Like Iâm crucified
When you look inside my heart
Revealing all the stains and pains

Like Iâm crucified
When you look inside my heart
Forgiving all my stains and pains
