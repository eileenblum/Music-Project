This burden is upon my shoulders
This burden is for me to love
This burden paves the way for sinners
No rest until I share my thoughts

This burden burns while I am sleeping
This burden quakes when Iâm awake
The burden gives me all my freedom
To focus beyond myself

This burden I cannot escape
This burden, I am like a tool
This burden, like a jesterâs play
To the world I am a fool

Is this the field of slaughtered souls?
Is this where bitterness confesses?
I donât pretend to be the better man
I found the touch that crushes all
The touch of Jesus calms
St. Anger to the core
