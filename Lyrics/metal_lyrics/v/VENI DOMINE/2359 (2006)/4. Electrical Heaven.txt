Sad days be gone
Thy will be done

Saw my life on sale on the internet
Paid for my silence, paid for no regrets

A prefab plug to fill the hole inside
Tested on mankind they said no one died
So they said, no one died

Donât want to end up in Electrical Heaven
A smile on my face but with a hole in my head

Amuse me to death
Abuse me to death

The seed of my needs infected indeed
Wash me Iâm tainted, I will never believe
In this illusive Messiah

Donât want to end up in Electrical Heaven
A smile on my face but with a hole in my head
Donât want to dry out in electrical Heaven
Rather stay here and live with the dead
