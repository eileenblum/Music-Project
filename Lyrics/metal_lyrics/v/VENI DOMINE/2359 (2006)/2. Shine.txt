And the guilt comes slow
It creeps and crawls
Beyond our mental walls

The things unsaid
The things we said
The thoughts we fed

All things will end one day
Doomed on that merciful day

Shine
You divine
You were never left for dead soâ¦
Shine
You divine
The barrel is not at your head soâ¦

Terror in and out
So scream and tease
The inner peace

The restless hour
The itching sour
The increasing power

Raging fearless to the core
The core is a cross so adore

Shine
You divine
You were never left for dead soâ¦
Shine
You divine
The barrel is not at your head soâ¦

Cursed are you above all the livestock
And all the wild animals!
You will crawl on your belly and you will
Eat dust all the days of y our life.
And I will put enmity between your offspring and hers;
He will crush your head and you will strike his heel.
[Genesis 3:14-16]
