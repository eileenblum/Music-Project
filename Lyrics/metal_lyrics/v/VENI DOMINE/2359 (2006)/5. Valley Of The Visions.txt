Crawling thirsty seeing evil
Horizon dwelling in the distance
No sight of shelter for my being
Legions tracing my existence

I will never taste defeat
Death is not my release

Lead me to the Valley of the visions
Where the silence and the pure will open every door
To new visions

Set my mind to see tomorrow
As the crucifixes turn upside down
The tongues in the air I canât recall them
But the power of the One is all around

The wave of emptiness subsides
Alpha and Omega be my guide

Lead me to the valley of the visions
Where the humble are the strong,
Where all do belong
In the vision
