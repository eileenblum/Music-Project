There is a red light flashing
At the end of reason
A stroke of coloured flare
Gray will be seasoned
The thoughts go âround and âround
Bound by the fall of man
The wise will cast their spell
Thoughts on heaven and hell

Where the story ends
The real will follow
At the gates of life
Just hope, no sorrow

The waste that filled our needs
And scorned our honest beliefs
Will lay ashamed alone
A newfound wisdom
And how it all began
And the spark of life
The answers then untold
The truth will now unfold

Where the story ends
The real will follow
At the gates of life
Just hope, no sorrow

Then no new stories will be told
Then the sun will light the way for everyone
No more shadows will prevail and stain the minds
The minds of the chosen ones
And thatâs us, we are the chosen ones

I saw a new heaven and a new earth
For the first heaven and the first earth are passed away

[2x]
Where the story ends
The real will follow
At the gates of life
Just hope, no sorrow

Then no new stories will be told
Then the sun will light the way for everyone
No more shadows will prevail and stain the minds
The minds of the chosen ones
And thatâs us, we are the chosen ones
