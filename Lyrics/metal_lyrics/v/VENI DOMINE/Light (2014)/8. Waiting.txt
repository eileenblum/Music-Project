Years I travelled far through the landscapes
Unexperienced yet well discovered
Inner spaces filled and then drained dry
Full of emptiness and a shy face

I left a shore of gold
For a cold and stormy sea
I turned my ship for own goals
The wind will lead me home

Iâm waiting
Iâm waiting for you

Sometimes I leave just for one day or
Sometimes I will stray for a single minute
You will keep me close to Your heart still
The love of the bloodred wood echoes

I left a shore of gold
For a cold and stormy sea
I turned my ship for own goals
Spirit, lead me home

Iâm waiting
Iâm waiting for you
