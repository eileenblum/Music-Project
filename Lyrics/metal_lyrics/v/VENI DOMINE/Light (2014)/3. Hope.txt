Long gone, another day has turned the page
Pale light trickles through my room
A new dawn, as I try to disengageâ¦
From pain

All these hours of staring, all awake
Thinking, as I wait for sleep
Sinking slowly, drowning in the wakeâ¦
Of grief

Let me feel the presence of Your purity
Let me see the comfort in Your eyes
Lift me up, embrace me with Your trinity
Youâre the hope for those who cry
Who tries in vain, to fight the pain
â¦the eternal strainâ¦

Wish to find a reason for this life
Answers to tell me, âwhy Iâm here?â
Ones so certain, not as now, grieving
Come Dawn and let these shadows fly away

[2x]
Let me feel the presence of Your purity
Let me see the comfort in Your eyes
Lift me up, embrace me with Your trinity
Youâre the hope for those who cry
Who tries in vain, to fight the pain
â¦the eternal strainâ¦
