Fallen fallen is Babylon the great
She has become a home for demons
For all the nations drank of her poisonous wine
The wine of her adulteries

Come away from her so that you will not share in her sin
So that you will not be the carrier of her plagues
Given payment for what she has given - for what she has done
As much torture and grief as the glory and pleasure she gave herself

Babylon - the abyss is calling her name
In only one hour your doom will come
Babylon - fall Babylon fall
The shining will never be seen in her again

When all the kings who shared her pleasures
See the smoke from her burning
Terrified they will stand far off and cry
"O great city - O Babylon"

"I sit as a Queen and not a widow
And I will never mourn"
Therefore in just one day her plagues will engulf her
Will engulf her

Babylon - the abyss is calling her name
In only one hour your doom will come
Babylon - fall Babylon fall
The shining will never be seen in her again
