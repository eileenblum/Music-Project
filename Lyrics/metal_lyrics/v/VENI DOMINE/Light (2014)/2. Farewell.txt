I know where this path ends
Iâve seen these walls inside my head
Passing through the chosen door
Familiar, yet a stain of grief
Sadness, brother and pain
Cycles back again

Lay down, lay low
Depressed you go
Lay down and dwell
This fate you sell
Every thought, every trace
Of the satanic embrace, farewell

I know where these thoughts lead
I lived this course, a grinding hell
I fought the lies and lived
The well of pain dries soon and kills
A thirst that canât be fed
By man-made hurt and fantasies

Lay down, lay low
Depressed you go
Lay down and dwell
This fate you sell
Every thought, every trace
Of the satanic embrace, farewell

Lay down, lay low
Depressed you go
Lay down and dwell
This fate you sell
