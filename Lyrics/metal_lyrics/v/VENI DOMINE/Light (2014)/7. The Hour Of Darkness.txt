The flight of sanity will show
In the eyes of those who know
The fall of darkness is at hand
It will burn our weakened land

This is the hour of darkness
When the lie will pierce our souls
This is the hour of darkness
The one with might will force control
God, let Your Son come again
Revelations come to life
God, let Your judge be just
This is the hour of darkness

Evil is marching on
Deceiving the trusting man
Few will sense whatâs going on
Before our eyes, but yet unknown

This is the hour of darkness
When the lie will pierce our souls
This is the hour of darkness
The one with might will force control
God, let Your Son come again
Revelations come to life
God, let Your judge be just
This is the hour of darkness
