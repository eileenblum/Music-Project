All left is nothing
Abandoned here with tears and ashes
Questions, no answers
Left with all my fear and rashes...pervades
So cold the insight
As I walk the isle of sorrow
So long until daylight
Will I ever see tomorrow...again?

Some may say this pain will fade
Wonder how I'm so afraid...to live

War with my senses
Torn apart by grief and anger
Have no defenses
As I'm falling deep in clamber
Sometimes I try to hate you
When my tears just cannot save me
Is there a way through?
I cling to all the straws that may be...

Strong enough to hold me there
Long enough away from despair

Gone away but still there with me
Away, but I can't let it go
Gone away, Lord, give me strength to carry on
Give me light when lost in shadows
God, help me, I am gone astray
Give me light, come give me strength to carry on

Sometimes when lying on the floor,
I haven't stood up for days
Because all I see is your face
I can feel the presence of peace around me
Someone who holds me and comfort me to sleep...
Just to fall next day again

You left the room and you threw the key
(The final step that "would set you free")
Without a sign that your hope was gone
(You walked the way that you knew was wrong)
What went through your mind that day?
(Into darkness you faded away)
I wish I knew that you fought in vain
(But I know that someday)
We'll meet again

(x2) Gone away but still there with me
Away, but I can't let it go
Gone away, Lord, give me strength to carry on
Give me light when lost in shadows
God, help me, I am gone astray
Give me light, come give me strength to carry on

To prevail
To let go
To survive
