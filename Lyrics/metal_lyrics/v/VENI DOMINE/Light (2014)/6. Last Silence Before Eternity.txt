So quietâ¦
The sound of waiting as the world is pending
How lateâ¦
What will come before the day is ending

Silenceâ¦captured by this silence
As we bide Your guidance
Let the nations know
Silenceâ¦strike down their defiance
The sacred, Godâs alliance
Let Your whisper fill their hate with grace

All signsâ¦
Seven cachets numbered, now all broken
Foretellsâ¦
Seven were the prophesies once spoken

See the incense rising
With prayers from all the saints
The censer filled with fire
To be thrown to earth like thunder

Silenceâ¦captured by this silence
As we bide Your guidance
Let the nations know
Silenceâ¦strike down their defiance
The sacred, Godâs alliance
Let Your whisper fill their hate with grace

Sorrow, there will be no sorrow
Thereâs a new tomorrow
Tears, they will be wiped away
See them, saved from tribulation
Hear their exaltation
The voices from a thousand souls
