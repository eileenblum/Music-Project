It's said that the evil will die
I long for the end of lies
It's said that the hurt will be gone
Iâll fight for the truth to rise!

The smoke from Hell that chokes and stains
The Devil inside thatâs calling your name
All dressed in white to lure and betray
Spirit of night return from where you came

The throne in heaven will never fall
The just and righteous will hear the call
As the bell of a thousand years will toll

It's said the truth will rise
I wish an end to all the lies

The fires of Hell that stain through you
inspired to blame that desire is shame
Jesus Christ the holy and true
Leave this moment as we call upon his name

The throne in heaven will never fall
The just and righteous will hear the call
The light of heaven will never fade
The pure of heart will never feel betrayed
As the bell of a thousand years will toll
