Perverted seeds inside our hearts
Perverted thoughts have brought us here
Sometimes it's hard to understand
that Jesus loves us all
Twisted spirits rule the world
Save me Jesus, save my soul

Watching how the hate blackens the sun
Watching how the greed kills the breed
Who will scream?
Waiting for the bomb to scorch the earth
Waiting for the numb to steal the words
Who will scream?
Watching how the pain eats the sane
Watching how the false do proclaim
Who will scream, dare you dream?

Ruby skies will glow tonight

Prophecies will be fulfilled
Mankind hear the earth is quaking
On this night He will return
Save me Jesus, save my soul
