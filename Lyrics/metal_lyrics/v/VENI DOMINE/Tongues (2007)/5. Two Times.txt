I stay, you wait
I go, you lead
I search, you show
I find, you know

I try to find
Some peace of mind
You serve, I need
You wash my feet

Long before I ask
You fill me up inside
I don't have to ask
Two times, two times

Long before I pray
You will come my way
I don't have to ask
Two times, two times

I fall, you pour
You show, the door
I walk, inside
You talk, no lies

Long before I ask
You fill me up inside
I don't have to ask
Two times, two times

Long before I pray
You will come my way
I don't have to ask
Two times, two times
