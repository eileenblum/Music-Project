I'm left here brokenhearted
Still sad from yesterdays
I'm weary, feel unguarded
In the mirror just a blurry haze

The blood is hot under my skin
I try to keep the faith and win

I did not know
I never saw
Your work behind my pain
Lord, bless my pain again

Like a blind man aching
As the light shines too strong
And my hope is breaking
Cause I thought I was wrong

You guide as I fall
But my fall is your call

I did not know
I never saw
Your tears behind my pain
Lord, cry and cry again

The misty fields in darkness
as the morning soon will break
And the serenades of sadness
Are bound in the burning lake
