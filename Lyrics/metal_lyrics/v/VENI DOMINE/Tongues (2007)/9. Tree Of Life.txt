In the deepest of forests
In the most beautiful garden
Life is growing
But the entrance is closed

Eden the peaceful sanctuary
What were you thinking?
Eve, you became the first sinner
Led us out through the gate

Made us aware of our nakedness
Today still we crave it
Practice right and wrong
We fool ourselves thinking
we are in control

Tree of life sowed by God
Tree of life protected by God

Tree of life sowed by God
Watered by the holy
Tree of life protected by God
Fruits to give health and life

We can't believe we have the truth
right before our blinded vision
It all goes back to the day
when mankind fell
We blindly see salvation
round the corner
There has to be a mysterious potion
to clear my vision

Tree of life sowed by God
Tree of life protected by God

Standing east of Eden paralyzed
Cherubs give me no reply
The flaming sword breathes my oxygen
It hurts me bad to go back again

But there's a light far down the horizon
Down the line of time there's hope
I see it as I turn my head around
There is news for the lost

The way to the tree of life
Cleared by the blood of God
Once again lending a hand
We so eagerly despise

Clouded are our minds
As we place us in the center
Can we solve our problems
Can we Eden enter

Of all the progress
Which led us closer?
To the solving of the quest
Of all our labour

What gave the answer
To the trial to the test

Will we be humble?
proclaim the maker?
And realize that
He ain't the breaker
Understand that dawn of life
Is far beyond our given purpose

Tree of life sowed by God
Tree of life protected by God

Tree of life sowed by God
Watered by the holy
Tree of life protected by God
Fruits to give health and life

The coincident is not the obvious answer
The self pleasing not the meaning of life
The rules given is not for us to bend
See how the planet repel our way of living

In the deepest of forests
In the most beautiful garden
Life is growing
And the entrance is no longer closed
