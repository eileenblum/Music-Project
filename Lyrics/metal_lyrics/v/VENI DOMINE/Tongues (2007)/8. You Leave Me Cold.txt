The wind from your winding lies
Still burning my skin
Your truth now will paralyse
So cold deep within
Your talk is sweet
Your talk is sin

You leave me cold
I need some warmth
Nothing you can say will make me obey
You leave me cold

Still, as the morning comes
You linger and wait
You spit on me
I see your bait

You leave me cold
I need some warmth
Nothing you can say will make me obey
You leave me cold

The historic values
of the rock and temple
and the curtain divided at Calvary

The breath of life in the clay
That brought us life
Is the power shining, power living still today

You leave me cold
I need some warmth
Nothing you can say will make me obey
You leave me cold

The life that Jesus gave for me
is shocking, to say the least
The truth He showed will never be accepted
Love is not the agenda of the beast
Perversion and man, in this day connected
