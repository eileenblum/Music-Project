Clone me clone you
Spares for eternity
Store me store you
After the bang to be

Let's walk the line now
Enchanting the breeding
Fuel us with hope now
While germs are feeding

I see October everywhere
The green has turned to grey
The dream of Eden sacrificed
From now we are the prey

Endless progress
the dreams will never end
Trust our smartness
to ride the latest trend

Is this a better place
Are we in better shape
Has mankind done it right
Are we equal to God?
