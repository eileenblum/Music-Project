[Rev 19 11-16]

I saw heaven standing open
And there before me was a white horse
His eyes were like blazing fire
And on his head were many crowns

He dressed in a robe dipped in blood
His name is the Word of God

The rider on the white horse
Named faithful and true
The rider on the white horse
Salvation for me and you

Armies of heaven were following
Dressed in fine linen, white and clean
Out of His mouth came a sharp sword
With which to strike down the nations

He treads the wine press of the fury
Of the wrath of God Almighty

On His robe and on his thigh
He had this name written
THE KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS
