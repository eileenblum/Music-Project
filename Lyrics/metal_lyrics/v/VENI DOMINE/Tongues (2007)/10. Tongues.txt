[Acts 2:2-4]

I'll stay in your presence
To breathe to be free
You're the core, you're the essence
For the wealth inside of me

Sacred is this moment
Breathe air into my lungs
Free me from this torment
Let me speak in tongues

My body will listen
Your voice is all around
You prove that you have risen
Creation can't be bound

Sacred is this moment
Breathe air into my lungs
Free me from this torment
Let me speak in tongues

Tongues of the sacred
Tongues for the free
Tongues for the tortured
Tongues for you and me

Let me speak, let my voice
communicate on a new level
Let me speak, let me be heard,
let the truth unfold
Let me speak, give me time
to adjust to you
Let me speak, let me hear,
voice of love, endlessly
