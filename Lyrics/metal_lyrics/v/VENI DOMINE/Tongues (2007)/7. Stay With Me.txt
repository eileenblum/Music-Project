Losing track
of the essence and the core
We ask our hearts
How to feel to be sure

We cannot tell
the wrong from right
It's like a spell
there's no fight

At this moment what's done is done
Evolution is growing strong

To this moment we swallowed a lot
My personal saviour in you I confide

Stay with me as I believe
Stay with me as I will grieve
Stay with me as I receive
The blasphemy of this tired world

Don't let go
of personality
God will lead
Follow sincerity

Moulded for the plan
Formed from the start
Distraction's on your shoulders
in your heart

And to this moment
we're straying in the dark
we're led to hate who we are
