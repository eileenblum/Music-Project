Bring the oath, bring the incense
Bring the flesh to the altar
Reflect on the times that passed by
Seize the time, seize your dreams
And focus on the wooden cross
Light a candle to the memory of Christ
Let your eyes feel the light
Let it shine from your soul
Behold the truth in the center of the heart
Speak the truth let it flow
Let your wishes be spoken
In languages never heard before
Resurrected from a stone to a bleeding heart
The mass is long awaited
The funeral of the past is about to come
The mass is the sign of deliverance
