That night the rain was falling
Or was it just my tears
Voices outside my window
From ancient years
So tired by my wisdom
Lost with a weary soul
I saw my life so wasted
All my dreams were dole
I saw the crown was lost in my search for gold
I wished the rain could cleanse my soul but
Nothing seemed to help me
In the rain I stood there lonely
Searching for salvation
"Come, come"
There I was waiting for the storm
I was waiting for the meeting
Then I felt a presence of someone so close
He spoke to me in languages I never heard before
Looked at me with eyes
That were healing my wounded soul
Everything around me was trembling by his grace
There I was in the middle of a storm
There I saw the meaning of it all
"All my life I carried the burdens upon my shoulders
In pride I threw away all invitations of life eternal"
That night the wind was speaking
It was the spirit's call
Saw life from a new dimension
With the wisdom of a child
He showed me things that once were hidden
From a sinner's eyes
There is a road for me to walk and
Yes, I stood there waiting
"Come, come"
There I was ready for the storm
I was ready to receive
There I was ready for the storm
I was ready for the meeting
