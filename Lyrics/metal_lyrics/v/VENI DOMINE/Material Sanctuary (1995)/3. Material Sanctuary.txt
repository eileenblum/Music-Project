Wasted years slaving under the system
Raised with the needs of Humanism
We've failed to see the crucial points
Like a blind leading a blind
The truth is frightening
Our souls are shivering
Material sanctuary - a place to hide
Makes the spiritual side commit suicide
Material sanctuary - we can be without
Abandon the sculpture of the golden calf
If our minds are crucified on the material altar
Our spirits cannot be free
When we feed ourselves with misery
Sweet little lies can't cover your eyes
The spirit of the night is hovering over the earth
Like a cloud with a deadly disease
Consuming us from inside
As we're thanking God for our material welfare
That has become our savior in control
We have to turn back and adjust our ways
Turn back how else can we see his grace
Yes I was wrong storing treasures in a mortal land
God help me so I won't fall again
Betrayed by the silence around the table
Stoned by the words never spoken
Visions from the past help us see what we've become
Don't you know what's right
Can't you see what's strongly coming in the end
Don't you fear the Lord
Can't you keep your heart away from mammon
Don't you know what's right
Can't you see what's strongly coming in the end
From the dead we will rise
A brand new life shall to us be given
So fall down on your knees in faith
The past will not be counted on Judgement Day
Betrayed by the silence...
