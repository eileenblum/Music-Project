And I saw an angel coming down from heaven
With the key to the abyss and a great chain in his hand
He seized the dragon and bound him for a thousand years
Upon the thrones sat those to whom judgement was assigned
I could see the souls of those who had been killed
Those who had not worshipped the image of the beast
The day has come for the dragon to return
He must fight the final battle
I know the end for I have read the word
There is no way back armageddon
The chosen came to life again and reigned
With Christ for a thousand years
Though the rest of the dead remained in the grave
This is the first resurrection over these
Second death has no claim
Foes marched across the breadth of the earth
And surrounded the camp of God's people - the city he loves
But fire came down from heaven and devoured them
And the devil who deceived them
Was thrown into the lake of burning sulphur
Where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown
They will be tormented day and night forever and ever
I feel your love surround me
When the storms outside are cold
I see you walk before me
When the roads just fade away
You let me rest in harmony
Until you come again
I wait for you
I'm waiting for the dawn
To see the light of the rising son
