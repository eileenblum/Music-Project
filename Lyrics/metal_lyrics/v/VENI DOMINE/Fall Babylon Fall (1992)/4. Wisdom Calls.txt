Wisdom calls aloud in the streets
Hear her raising her voice in the squares
How long will you simple ones
Love your evil ways
Turn around and listen to my rebuke
And I will pour out my spirit on you
Turn around and listen to my rebuke
And I will let you hear my words
As the moon turns to blood
So many will understand
As the seals are breaking one by one
Hear my words - hear the wisdom call
For you wouldn't hear when I cried
And you didn't react when I reached out my hand to you
As you let my advice drain away
And you didn't accept my rebuke
Therefore shall I smile when your day has come
And despise you when the things that you fear are near
When your fear comes like a storm
There will be anguish and pain
Then they will call to me but I shall not answer
They will look for me but nothing will be found
Since they hated knowledge and did not choose to
Fear the Lord
They would not accept my advice and spurned my rebuke
They will eat the fruit of their ways
And be filled with the wine of their schemes
But the one who listens to me
He will live in security
And be sheltered against the curse of death
Wisdom calling me
