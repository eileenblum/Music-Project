He came as a child, into a tired world
After all the years of despair
Just a child, but there was something in his eyes
He was the son he was the lamb, ready to be sacrificed
I saw a man, blood ran from his face
A simple man as they led him up to calvary
But did they know the reasons why
To save the poor who seek their solace in the dark
Just sign your name
Just sign your name into the book of life
Don't hesitate
Don't be afraid of the shining in the sky
Sentinel, sentinel
Your kingdom will be veiled without your name
Sentinel, sentinel
You're the one who leads us through the gate
He's the son - people receive him
He's the son - people come near him
He came as a child gentle as a dove
But in the end he will return as a lion
Can't you hear the call
Of the angels
Hosts of adonai
O kingdom rise
Kingdom appear
On the horizon
I feel he's near
The sentinel has come for his own
Sentinel, sentinel
Your kingdom will be veiled without your name
Sentinel, sentinel
When that morning comes you will return
See the sky, see the sky
I can you feel your presence near
Sentinel
You will descend from above
