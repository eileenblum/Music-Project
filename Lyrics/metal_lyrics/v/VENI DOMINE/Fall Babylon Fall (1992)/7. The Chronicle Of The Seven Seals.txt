Then I saw in the right hand of him
Who sat on the throne
A scroll with writing on both sides
And sealed with seven seals
I heard a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice
"Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?"
But no one in heaven or under the earth
Could open the scroll or look inside
I wept and I wept because no one was found
Who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside
Then I heard one of the elders say to me
"Don't weep"
See the Lion of the tribe of Judah
The root of David has won
He is able to open the scroll
And its seven seals
Then I saw a lamb looking as if it had been slain
Standing in the center of the throne
Encircled by four living creatures
And the elders
He had seven horns and seven eyes
Which are the seven spirits of God
Sent out into all the earth
He came and took the scroll from
The right hand of him who sat on the throne
And when he had taken it
The four living creatures and the elders
Fell down before the Lamb
Each one had a harp
And they were holding golden bowls
Full of incense
Which are the prayers of the saints
And they sang a new song
I watched as the lamb opened the first of the seven seals
Then I heard one of the four living creatures
Say in a voice like thunder
"Come"
There before me was a white horse
Its rider held a bow
He was given a crown
He rode out as a conqueror
Bent on conquest
Then another horse came out
A fiery red one
Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth
To him was given a large sword
And there before me was a black horse
Its rider was holding a pair of scales
Then I heard a voice among the four living creatures saying
"A quart of wheat for a day's wages
And do not damage the oil and the wine"
There before me was a pale horse
Its rider was named Death
And Hades followed close behind him
They were given power
Over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword
Famine and plagues and by the wild beasts of the earth
I saw those who had been slain because of the word of God
And I heard them call out in a loud voice
"How long Sovereign Lord holy and true
Until you judge the earth and avenge our blood?"
Then each of them was given a white robe
And they were told to wait a little longer
There was a great earthquake and the sun turned to black
I saw the whole moon turn blood red
And the stars in the sky fell down to the earth
As drops from a tree when shaken by the wind
The sky receded like a scroll
And every mountain was removed from its place
Then the kings of the earth I saw the rich I saw the mighty
Every slave and every freeman hid in caves in the mountains
"Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on
The throne
And from the wrath of the Lamb
For the great day has come and who can stand?"
I felt the silence in the sky
There was a wonder in the air
Because the numbers were complete
The time had come when all the seals were broken
All things I saw were like a dream
There was angel dressed in white
I saw the glory in his face
He came and stood at the altar
Then I could see in his hand
A censer made of gold
And much incense for offerings were given to him
I saw the smoke from the incense rise up before the Lord
Together with the prayers of the saints
Prophecy - is spoken
Prophecy - forever
We're running out of time
Prophecy - is calling
Prophecy - for mankind
You cannot run away
Then the angel took the censer
Filled it with the fire from the altar
He raised his hand and hurled it on the earth
With mighty peals of thunder
I may see the coming king appear in majesty
To proclaim his kingdom's coming
Meanwhile at the world's dark end
The nations raise their hands
Waiting for the serpent to strike
The seals are broken
