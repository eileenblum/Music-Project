Early oppressors designed the solution for the ultimate corruption of man. 
Create an image of an afterlife only accessible through acting like fucking sheep. 
These ignorant beings 
There are none more ignorant and useless then those that seek answers on their knees with their eyes closed. 

[Luke Griffin] 
Gagged and bound, they speak only in tongues of madness. 
Sickeningly worshiping just on belief is lunacy. 
Why can't you see. 
Trusting in a fallacy that's nothing but a system of control. 
You're fucking diverting your mind. 
Unintelligent behaviour on your part. 
True understanding. 
Does not lie in distractions. 

[Duncan]
When the doors of perception are cleansed man will see things as they truly are, Infinite. 
Religion binds man to a life of ignorance designed to benefit thee oppressors. 
Religion preys on the weaknesses of our populace whilst its operators bring in the cash. 
They're praying to a god of lies. 

[Luke Griffin] 
Hands together now get on your knee's 
Just trust us that 
Thy will must be done. 
Sounds a bit like brain washing to me! 
Reinforced through fear. 
Disgustingly. 
Burning in a state suffering will be the answer to your sins. 
Subservient tranquillity! 

[Duncan] 
No God ever gave any man a thing 
Nor answered any prayer at any time 
We know thereâs no such thing 
Nonexistent frauds every one of them! 
Created too control and keep the sheep occupied 
To see by faith is to shut the eye of reason. 
Expose and Eradicate 
Unveil The Abomination. 
There are none more ignorant and useless then those that seek answers on their knees with their eyes closed. 

[Luke Griffin] 
Kneel, pray. 
For...
