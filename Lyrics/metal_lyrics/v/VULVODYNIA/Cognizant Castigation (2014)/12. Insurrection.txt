After all that you have learnt through our talks I feel it is time to take action and tear down their oppressive reign once and for all

Guerrilla warfare breaks out in the streets 
Complete anarchy we do as we please 
Better to die fighting for freedom then to be a prisoner all your life 
Fantasy, Lunacy, Unlikely 
All revolutions are until they happen 
Then they are historical inevitability 
A struggle between future and past 
We must recreate reality 
There is no final one 
Revolutions are infinite 
We are the dawning of a new age 
There is no final one 
Revolutions are infinite 
We are the dawning of a new age 

For the sake of generations to come 
We have to burn down the parliament 

For the sake of generations to come 
You must follow us into the final war 

[Alexander Eastman] 
Domestic terrorism 
Upon our fears they feed 
Once drained of all our freedom 
We bite the hand that bleeds 

No longer drones without life 
No longer slaves to your plight 
No longer pawns in your fight 
No longer under your knife 

We are revolt and reckoning 

Now free of surveillance 
We are the axe poised to fall 
Criminals, murderers, thieves 
We are justice 
You can't stop us all
