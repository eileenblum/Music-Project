Infinite things too see in life yet Iâm stuck working that 9 to 5 
I was indoctrinated into the system the day I was born. 
My future and place in society already fucking planned. 

We are all brought up only knowing what is shown too us through the media and the people we know. 
This grand masquerade that we all believe to be life was designed as the ultimate tool for enslavement 
This system makes us abandon our true skills 
Forced to work a job that could already be done by technology 
We are too comfortable with our shackles 

You will feel the sorrow that i feel knowing we imprisoned our own species with the monetary system. 
Why do we do this too ourselves? 
We are in their endless cycle of debt 
Where is our planet heading? 

We are marching toward the end of our species! 
We are marching towards the end of our species 
We are enslaved 
We are blinded 
We are tied down 
Set your brain free 

Infinite things too see in life yet Iâm stuck working that 9 to 5 
Enslaved and Subservient 
Too deep to be removed from the system
