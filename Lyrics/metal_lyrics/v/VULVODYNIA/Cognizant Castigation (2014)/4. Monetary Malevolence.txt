Created out of greed and gluttony. 
Inanimate objects given power over man 
This was our ultimate downfall as a species 
Enough for all yet some starve whilst others feast 

[Jason Evans] 
The current cost of callousness shallowness and the price of greed, 
Caskets coffins lined with entwined with leaders monarchs and thieves. 
Palms are crossed with silver they slither like snakes across the river, 
Shiver like a coward devoured destroyed and overpowered. 
We are the ones who can't be saved. 
Crushed into dust we are enslaved, 
We're betrayed, by the price that we've paid, lined up with the decayed and then we're led to the grave. 
The debt you owe is reimbursed, 
The world you know is getting worse, 
The seeds you sow will spread the curse, 
Gold to shit Midas reversed.

Blinded by the need to have we're forced into a material existence 
Tortured and taught not too give a fuck 
About our planet or fellow man 
We wonât stand for this i will devise a plan 
Take your money to the footsteps of your so called federal reserve! 
Set it ablaze!!! Watch your shackles burn too the sky! 
Burn it all down, this system has fucking failed you! 
Burn it all down, this system has fucking failed you! 
Burn it all down, this system has fucking failed you! 
Burn it all down, this system has fucking failed you! 
Printed paper is controlling our lives, anybody would kill for it. 
The rich get richer whilst the poor get poorer. 
Open your fucking eyes! 
True freedom to become what we want to be can only be accomplished by destroying the monetary system that they hold dear! 
It is the only way! 
Heed my words! 
Blinded by the need to have we're forced into a material existence 
Tortured and taught not too give a fuck 
About our planet or fellow man 
We wonât stand for this i will devise a plan 
Take your money to the footsteps of your so called federal reserve! 
Set it ablaze!!! Watch as your shackles burn too the sky! 
We will not be tied down by a force that is unseen! 
Fuck you and fuck your monetary malevolence
