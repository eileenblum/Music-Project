Rule, Control, Manipulation! 
This planet belongs to me! 
Your reality is my prototype 
Your aspirations and futures are within my grasp 
Kneel before me 
Thee Oppressor Unseen 
Your government work for me 
Your freedom is an illusion 
That was set in place in order to enslave all men and women! 
It doesn't matter who you are or who you claim to be! 
I own your soul! 
You're all slaves too my monetary gain! 
There is no way to stop it! 
You have no hope now! 
The system is in motion you all shall bow! 
There is no way to stop it! 
You have no hope now! 
The system is in motion you all shall bow! 
In my eyes the world is nothing but a business! 
That profits only one percentage of our population! 
Making money every day as our planet slowly turns too shit! 
Anally raping you from the day you were born! 
Your government work for me 
Your freedom is an illusion 
That was set in place in order to enslave all men and women! 
It doesn't matter who you are or who you claim to be! 
I own your soul! 
You're all slaves too my monetary gain. 
My success is the culmination of controlling your failure! 
Deceive The Public! 
You will not know my true name. 
You will not see my true face. 
You are ensnared in my web! 
The power to manipulate is the only thing that fucking counts. 
You live in false equality 
I am the architect of your demise!
