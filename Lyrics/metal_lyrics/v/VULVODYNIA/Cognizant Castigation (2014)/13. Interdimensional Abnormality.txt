Slowly shifting between dimensions 
Gorging itself upon your worst fears 
Living for constant dissection 
Blood curdling screams are all you hear 
When this beast is near 

Carcinogenic by nature 
This creature lives only to feed 
It cares not for your creed 
Gluttonous and filled with greed 
Carcinogenic by nature 
This creature lives only to feed 
Upon the weak and fragile minded 
Aborted fetuses and feces covered elderly 
Go down like candy in his monstrous jaws 
This is a taste of true perversion 

Morphing into your worst nightmare right before your eyes 
Oh the pleasure it gets watching a man fucking die! 
Morphing into your worst nightmare right before your eyes 
Oh the pleasure it gets watching a man fucking dies! 

Inter-dimensional Abnormality sent too devour the planet and plant its genetic seed within the earths core 
We are doomed forevermore 

Growing in size the more it feeds 
It will soon ingest our planet 
Growing in size the more we bleed 
It will soon devour the planet 

Morphing into your worst nightmare right before your eyes 
Oh the pleasure it gets watching a man fucking die! 
Morphing into your worst nightmare right before your eyes 
Oh the pleasure it gets watching a man die, 
We are being slaughtered like flies
