Sucked into another reality! 
Kaleidoscopes of colors and vibrations! 
Can you feel the fucking walls breathe? 
I'm going out of my mind! 
All my questions will be answered! 

See the faces contort as time slows down 
We are connected too the universe 
We are connected too the universe 
Shock waves send my fucking rushing brain into extreme euphoria 

See the fractals dancing around the skyline tonight 
Feel the heartbeat of our mother earth 
My every movement becomes a blur 
The voice of reason in my head is speaking in tongues 
I think im going crazy 

Put your head back and break free from society's twisted illusion of reality! 
We are living my new reality 
My 3rd eye has been opened as i gaze upon our disgusting planet 
My 3rd eye has been opened as i gaze upon our beautiful yet disgusting planet 

Your imagination becomes warped with this mind altering journey 
Elevate your horizons 
The voice of reason in my head is speaking in tongues 
Sucked into another reality! 
Kaleidoscope of colors and vibrations! 
Can you feel the fucking walls breathe? 
I am going out of my mind! 
All my questions will be answered!
