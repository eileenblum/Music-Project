We are vessels for their corruption! 
We are vessels for their corruption! 
Stand up see through the fog they have blinded us 
Stand up see through the fog we are not sheep 
This ignorance exists but it can be destroyed we are in the same fucking struggle! 
We canât change the past 
But we can create a new future where we are kings and thee oppressors rot in their graves! 
I command you too rise from the ashes and slay your authority now 
I command you too rise from the ashes and slay your authority down 
Prepare yourself for revolutionary genocide 
Its liberty or death, choose your side. 
Destroy the power that mentally incarcerates you 
Fuck authority we vote for assassination!
