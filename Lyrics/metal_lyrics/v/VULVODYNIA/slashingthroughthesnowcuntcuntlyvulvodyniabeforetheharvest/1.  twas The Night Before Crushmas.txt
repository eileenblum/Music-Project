[performed by Vulvodynia]I see the trust in their eyes whilst dressed in this disguise. 
These feeble minded young cattle 
Are going too experience Christmas in a new way! 
Witness the demise of your family 
I take your children in their sleep 
Their souls are mine too keep! 
Useless cries for help echo as they are dragged into my lair! 
Arriving in my bloody sleigh 
Slaying your whole family 
Burning down your Christmas tree! 
Stealing all pubescent seed 
Devouring your cookies and milk 
Feeding corpses to my reindeer 
A pyrotechnic show will see the end of your family 
Fry Maggot, Fry Maggot, Fry Maggot, Fry Maggot! 
In my lair they lie bound in the thousands. 
A painted portrait of my agony 
In my lair they lie bound in the thousands. 
A painted portrait of my agony 
I fucking hate this time of year! 
It driven me crazy! 
Falling into insanity! 
I will end the lives of these children and will be named as the demon of Christmas 
Beloved by many who knew my name 
The trust in their eyes died 
As they realized their inevitable demise at the hands of Saint Nik
I see the trust in their eyes whilst dressed in this disguise. 
These feeble minded young cattle 
Are going too experience Christmas in a new way! 
Witness the demise of your family 
I take your children in their sleep 
Their souls are mine too keep! 
Slowly beheading all the Christian seed I've gathered 
Morphing into thee abomination of Christmas 
Slowly beheading all the Christian seed I've gathered 
Morphing into thee abomination of Christmas
