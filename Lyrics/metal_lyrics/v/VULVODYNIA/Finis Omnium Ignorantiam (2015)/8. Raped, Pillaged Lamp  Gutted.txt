[originally by Waking The Cadaver]I could only imagine the fear in your mind 
As my hands grab your throat from behind 
No doubt 
For this bitch 
I'll use the pressure point choke out 
Because when it comes to sluts 
It's a good chance your gonna see my glock, before you see my cock 

Dark room awakening, strapped to the table 
The lights illuminate my instruments 
My pickaxe, snubnose, the sawnoff, the meat cleaver, the chainsaw 
You see what the fuck I'm workin' with? 
This isn't a dream bitch, to me, your nothing but a hole 
So when I look you in the eyes, the only words I say is 
I'm in full control 

Horror when you see my face 
You've seen the blotters in the newspapers, you know I'm famous 
So bitch I'm gonna start this shit with a pickaxe to your anus 
Blood pours; fountains from this whore 
I look at my prick, and I know I'm craving more 
I grasp my cleaver, my tool of dismemberment 
Hacking at your limbs, slipping in the blood on my floor 
Jamming your severed arm into your rancid vaginal pore 
I spew at the sight of the slashed and gaped asshole 
Hyper-extended vaginal cavity fuels my urge to disembowel. 
Removal of your mangled innards, forceful extraction from your busted anus. 

Now that I'm done with this brutalized cunt, 
As I walk away, I spark up a freshly rolled blunt. 
I left her there to die slow, 
This is how I show zero respect for this busted ass hoe
