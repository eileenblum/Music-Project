Thee entire human population wreathes down a whirlpool of dark matter! An infinite fractal convolution peeling flesh from bone! A mountainous ball of flesh and bone spiraling into thee Omega. He has a new purpose for us. Every strand of our genetic code dissected and corrected! He has mutilated the human genome! [2x]. Interjecting infinite knowledge from thee ancients into our DNA! With the universe in his hands he has designed us as his army of beasts! [2x] Wolfing down our souls! This being takes control of our every action as our eyes burst forth from our skulls! Wandering carcasses glowing red with his spark.
Contaminated with cosmic knowledge our brains begin to burst through our craniums! Immense limitless thought ravages the mind leaving nothing impossible! Spewed back onto earth! Now we shall the damage we have dealt! Through thousands of years we have decayed this planet to near dust! [2x].
Now we're ready for consumption!
Cleansed of all impurities!
Bred to his design!
Illuminate conspiracies!
Behold his scarlet blight!
Be gone obscurities!
Cast with all his might!
No use we fight!
Interjecting infinite knowledge from thee ancients into our DNA! With the universe in his hands he has designed us as his army of beasts! [2x]. We are genetically reengineered repugnance! Recast in his image our planet shall be a tasty morsel for this beast!

[Matt Turkington of Internal Devour]
A genome swayed into oblivion. We've become his altered atrocities! A planet of beings with cosmic comprehension wounded by our wrong doings. Grotesque, Repulsive and Benign. This colossal being will eat the sun.
