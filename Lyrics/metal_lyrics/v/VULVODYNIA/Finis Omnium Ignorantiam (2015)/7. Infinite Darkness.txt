Our realm redesigned through the eyes of our overlord Praenuntius
Kneel before his feet inferior being
We are no longer human!
Our realm redesigned through the eyes of our overlord Praenuntius
Kneel before his feet inferior being
We are no longer human!
Darkness engulfs the galaxy
As Praenuntius swallows the sun
Infinite night ensues
Carving a new world into existence to redress the balance of old
Birthing a new world into existence to redress the balance of old
All species wiped from the face of the earth
Replaced by genetically modified clones
A new breed of ultra species
What have we become?
The thing in the mirror's not me.
I have become a clone, evolved!
Infinite knowledge lies in me, unlocked.
As Praenuntius makes his way back to earth
Infinite night ensues
He wont stop until he's devoured our entire universe!

[Ricardo Proenca of Analepsy]
Swallowed whole our planet descends down the throat of a beast millennia old!
Its filthy gut to be our new home
A sea of galaxies and universes
rotting and digesting in the belly of the beast

Our realm redesigned through the eyes of our overlord Praenuntius
Kneel before his feet inferior being
We are no longer human!

[Lukas Vaas of Architect of Dissonance]
Extraction of our planets Minerals
Extinction in a mucus Guttural
Deception of the state of natural
Through the bowels of the beast
The Devourer of worlds was released
Within these doomed eyes
Infinite Darkness will reveal

[Duncan]
Our realm redesigned through the eyes of our overlord Praenuntius
