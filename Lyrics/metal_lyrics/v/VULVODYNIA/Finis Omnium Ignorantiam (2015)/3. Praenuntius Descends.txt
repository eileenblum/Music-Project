Lumbering through dimensions and eating all the planets whole, leaving nothing in its path, I'm sure this creature has no soul. His course is set for the Milky Way. He believes we have a role to play, hearing every word we say! Our galaxy is bound to pay!

Thee outer planets of our galaxy are an appetizer for this beast! We run around like gluttonous cattle oblivious to the fact our death is imminent. Chaos from the sky.

Praenuntius shape-shifts into human form before entering our atmosphere! It will infiltrate our species and consume our knowledge before devouring the earth whole!

Infiltrating our dimension with only the worst intentions, wondering who brought him here! Bent to devour all the so called people of power!

Thee harbinger of a new age lurks withing our walls stealing our knowledge! See!

Working its way into our society, eating all who get in his way, killing fiends as water rises, eating all who get in his way.

Praenuntius shape-shifts into human form before entering our atmosphere! It will infiltrate our species and consume our knowledge before devouring the earth whole!

This being takes on the form of anybody as it crushes in its monstrous jaws.
Able to take on any size and any form this is the destroyer of worlds
This being sees things the way they truly are on our barren planet! These creatures made it so and they must suffer.
