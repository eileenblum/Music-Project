[feat. Chris Buttersworth]Taking the essence of those I've killed! 
Ingredients for my vile concoction. 
MUTI! 
Storing all the blood and guys I've spilled! 
Ingredients for my vile concoction! 
MUTI! 
Knowledge passed down through my tribal elders. 
I will murder with their guidance sickness overcome through violence! 
Fresh eyes plucked from an albino child will cure the blind! 
Evil of an alternate kind! 
EE EE EE AW AW AW 
Running from the witch! 
She will find you! 
EE EE EE AW AW AW 
Running from the witch! 
She will find you! 
Wondering through the dark of the ghetto. 
Harvesting souls in the streets of Soweto. 
Screams of the children bring my blood to a boil! 
Questionable acts beyond this mortal coil! 
BLEGH! 
Finger nails from a new born child. 
The severed member of an elderly male. 
The fresh entrails of a newly killed lion. 
BREE x 30 
Let's see what the bones have in store for you tonight! 
My secret ingredient in my Muti is the still beating heart of a premature fetus! 

[Chris Buttersworth of Crepitation]: 
"Wobble, Wobble feces and trouble; 
Fire burn and caldron bubble. 
One Slice of Vomit Cake, 
In the caldron boil and bake; 
Rhino horn and toe of frog, 
Wool of bat and tongue of dog, 
Adder's fork and water of bong, 
Lizard's leg and elephant schlong, 
For a charm of powerful trouble, 
Like a hell-broth boil and bubble. 
Double, double toil and trouble; 
Fire kuvuthe futhi nawo uqobo uyikhanzi, bubble . 
Cool ngegazi imfene sika , 
Khona-ke charm iqinile futhi kuhle . 
Ngiyi Umthakathi" 
Be sure to pick up one of my many flyers! 
Do you want a genital enlargement for your ncinyane umthondo? 
Ikhanda le msunu ka baba ko! 
Bringing a crows head up to the boil 
Adding goats testicles and the liver of a virgin child. 
Drinking the green poison bubbling, rub it in your skin. 
Make sure to sacrifice your kin. 
Murder your ex lover too. 
I am a fucking master at what I do! 
Call me a fucking sangoma bitch! 
I'll put an endless curse upon you!
