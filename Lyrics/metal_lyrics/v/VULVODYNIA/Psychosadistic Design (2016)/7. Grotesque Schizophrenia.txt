[feat. Martin Funderud]November 13th, 1922' 
Another day in the madhouse! 
These inmates are getting to me slowly losing my sanity! 
Delve into a damaged mind 
Perversions of a perverted kind 
Inmate Number 616: 
The one I could not fix! 
Grinding his cranium with a bone saw, 
Scooping out his brain with a steel claw! 
Inmate Number 354: 
Always fucking running his jaw! 
I stomped his cunt face into the floor and severed his legs for the base of my boar 
I've wondered down the steps of insanity! 
'November 14th, 1922' 
My harvest is going as planned! 
I've murdered another few. 
Inmate Number 032: 
Stabbing at her throat as I plough through her bleeding pussy was so divine! 
I began to mangle her insides as I raped her with a rather large smile! 
My mind is spiraling into perversity I can feel my sanity slip away... 
This collection of severed souvenirs loves me! 
'November 15th, 1922' 
Slicing the legs and sewing them onto the severed torso 
Bleed them dry! 
Ascend the heart into the torso and connect the spinal cord to the cerebral cortex of your scooped out brain! 
Of your scooped out brain! 
Inmate Number 438: 
This motherfucker sealed his fate! 
Cutting off his arms, I terminate. 
Choking while I masturbate 
Inmate Number 915: 
I thought of keeping her alive but I later gave her a surprise 
Stabbed her sixty times and raped her whilst she died 
My beast will roam these asylum walls for eternity bearing my mark! 

[Martin Funderud of Kraanium]: 
"Schizophrenic abomination. 
Lumbering bag of petrified meat. 
Looking for a morsel to eat. 
Lumbering Meat!
