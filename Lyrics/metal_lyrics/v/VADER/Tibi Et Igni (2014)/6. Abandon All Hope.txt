"Omnes relinquite spes, o vos intrantes"

Your Empty, unavailing
Life is coming to its end new
All shaking and frightened,
Calculating last minutes of Your time
Come to me!!!

I was waiting in patience
And watching your vanity and bliss
And I sent my invitation
To your soul and now you're knocking to my door
Welcome now...
Leave all behind...
Welcome to Hell!!!!

Step into oblivion

Are you loosing your mind
Or trying to bring back a name of your God?
No angels nor Demons exist in my house
Now you're eternally mine
Abandon all hope
Abandon all hope...
Abandon ALL
