Pride, will, endless desire
Attributes divine or the curse of the creator
Consciousness of power in hands of a lord
Art, curiosity or toys made of flesh

A subtle being. Dark and Light
God and Beast combined in one
... now live!

Creators cunning, this opus dei
Split in pain and mortal fate
... now breed!

Life is set in the hutch of the soil
Divided, divined, filled with illusions
To keep of gender, in love or in hate
Subconscious urge...

Somewhere

Nowhere

Pain unites, pain divides
In this raging pleasure
Feels like a God
She will eat your flesh
He will drink her blood
Everlasting Lust
This pattern never ends
