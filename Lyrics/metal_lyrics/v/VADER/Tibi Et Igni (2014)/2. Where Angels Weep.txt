High piercing screams and fearful penetrating cries
Ivory feathered creatures now withered and defeated
Weeping tears of gold as they know, the heaven's fallen
All soaked in blood, forsaken, debased

Victorious demons flying high
To welcome Lord who rises up from pits of tar

Hunted and haunted by the evil force supreme
Now reduced to the ruins, ashes and dust

No prayers will help
No god to revenge
Darkness is raising
Life has come to its end!

High piercing screams and fearful penetrating cries
All celestial creatures now withered and destroyed
How did it come to this? How could the Heavens fall?
All lies of centuries now will burn to its golden gates

Hunted and haunted by the evil force supreme
Now reduced to the dust, and dead!
