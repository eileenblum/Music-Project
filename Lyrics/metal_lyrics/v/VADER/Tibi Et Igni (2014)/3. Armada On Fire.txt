From the sacred cathedrals raised on the rock
Born in hate and greed and adoration
Legions sent by wrath of the tyrant
Seed of dead Nazarene. plague of fear and pain

Consecrate me!

"I will kill this world for You,
And spill the blood for glory
Hear me God. remit my sins,
Rise my throne up to You"

Call the winds from the pits of burning Hell
Infernal breath of Death
Now break the spell and curse Your foe
No God above myself

The gates to Hell are open wide again
All monsters released now
Hungry for the blood
The seal Is broken - Dark Travellers arise
Spinning whirls are swallowing
Every living being
Rain of golden crosses - cold, inverted
Falls with Darkness upon the human grave

No breath, no hope, shame and humiliation
Freezing embrace,

Exploding holy skulls of the dead

From the sacred cathedrals raised on the rock
Born in hate, greed and adoration
Legions sent by wrath of the God
Seed of dead Nazarene, plague of fear and pain
