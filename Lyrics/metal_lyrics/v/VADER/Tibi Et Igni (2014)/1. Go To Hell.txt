Gates to Hell sealed by the spells
Like a barrage dividing the Living from the Dead
Powerful screen protecting what's above
From the lava snakes, still awaiting for the time

Once in a while a human curiosity
Just natural desire to open the Unknown
Now Fire is released, furious and deadly
The Earth is trembling as the Beast is rising up

Rocks and fire raining from the skies
Chaos, darkness enfold the land around
Snakes of Fire fossilize all life
Now Hell cums to You with rage and lust

Scream, pray, invoke, confess
No hide nor run, terror and fear
The Earth bleeds and quakes in fever
The Gates are unlocked so go to Hell now!

Goto Hell!
