Under the wings in black
The Ancient Powers rise
Who lay in wait for thousand years
Still gaze with hateful eyes

What once put in motion
Can never be undone
Ripping fleshes and feathers
And cries upon the skies

Terror in the black flames
Where angels never dare to fly

INFERNAL ATTACK

The Radiant, his target
The Angelic in despair
The Light Reaper sets ablaze
All sacrum on His way
He is the grand executioner
Nemesis straight from the Hell
Infernal and atrocious
Vengeance and fulfilment

Burning this false paradise
Contaminated
We cleanse the air from this holy filth
Impaled birds of God are all in flames new
We will never hear their rancid,
Pathetic prayer again

Battle of the wicked
Ferocious, bloody howls
Rapture interrupted
Those yet alive now slaid and burned
Tearing down the Heavens!
Apocalypse prevails
Forever ongoing
Dark against the Light

Terror in the black flames
Where angels never dare to fly

INFERNAL ATTACK
THE FINAL STRIKE
BATTLE IN GLORY
REGAINING OF THE THRONE
