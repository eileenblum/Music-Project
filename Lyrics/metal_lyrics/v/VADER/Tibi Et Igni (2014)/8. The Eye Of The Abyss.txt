"Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster
And if You gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into You."
[Friedrich Nietzsche]

Dark, silent night
Bells announce midnight
Dense fog walks the streets
Touching the light

Stained glasses blink
Like phantom eyes in the air
Smell of burning candles
A distant chant is flowing high

A night divine...

Arms and eyes are raising up
Shadows dancing around
A kneeling figure slowly moves
Starring at the sacrifice of God

Look in my eye
Oculus dei
Meat and blood
In golden star
I see your soul
I feel your awe

Constant doubts?
Dr certitude of fall...

Cold thrill squeezes Your heart
A touch of the unknown
Fire burning in the chest
Incinerates Your soul...

Burning horizon and the Black Eye
Like a dominating Sun
The Abyss ever-lusting
Fear turns into hate
You are screaming and falling
Wings of fire melting the flesh
Alone in this suffering
Pain and pride exploding... FOREVER!

In my eye
Ocuius dei
Pain and fire
In blackened Sun
I see your soul
I feel your awe
Constant doubts?

Or certitude of fall...
