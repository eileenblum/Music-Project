Fear, decay and chaos
Still plundering the globe
All hate now mixed with hope
Aggression uncontrolled

Cities burning bright around
And panic reached the heavens
Prayers and believers
Now screaming for deliverance

Freedom blinds in pain
Turning love to hate
Transmuting wine to blood
In apocalyptic heat

Killing never stops
Killing is in us
Killing never helps
Not to forget no more regret

[Lead: Spider / Peter]

Hate leads to hate
Perpetual revenge
So atavistic lust
Poisons our sanity

Hypnotized dead fleshes
Dancing closer to the flame
Like a moth in last attempt
Of running fast into the light
All consumed by the furnace hate
And searching for the enemy
If you wanna live in peace
Stay ready for the war

Is killing gonna stop?!
Is killing gonna ever stop
To save us all?!
