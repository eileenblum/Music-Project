Shadow trembling in the night
Accruing waves of screams
Virgin womb giving birth in blood
Fear and pain released
Pain!

I devoured it all
I took it in
And now turning all back
To the god

Bowing souls in maze of dirt
Fleshes torn by steel
Agony of the innocence
Such fear and pain released

Power and solitude of the one
Turned the god to stone
A father who turned to the beast
Feeding with fear and pain
And tears

Banned by your tyranny
Repulsed for all inquiries
I suck pain from your seed
To spit it out to you

[Lead: Peter/Spider]

Pain!
My pain!
Pain!
Feel my pain!
Now feel my pain!
My pain!
