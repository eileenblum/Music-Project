Milion human bodies
Dirt, blood and fear
No hope
Like rats in maze of pain
Staring eyes and praying ghosts
No god

Fog is falling down
When the sun is rising to the skies

Silence is like death
The messenger of hell
Coming soon
Distant voices and whispers
Command to march ahead
And die

Docs of war unleashed
Adrenaline attacks the brains
Approaching steel and wrath
So fearless, great and merciless rain

Lacerated heavens
Keep spitting with blood
Creeping fog taking breath away
Corpses lie in the graves
Steel death is flying blind
Piercing skulls and bones in fury
Just agony and cries
Dancing shadows in the fire

Watch this fallen paradise
Feel the end of days
Your bones tread in hell
Like million more will fade away
In the iron reign

[Lead: Spider / Peter]

Sun is falling down
And darkness covers twisted hell

Iron reign rising
Neverending realm of death
Bloody feast on humanity
And only dead can see the end
Of this war

Only dead can see the end
Of this war

Only dead will see the end
Of war
