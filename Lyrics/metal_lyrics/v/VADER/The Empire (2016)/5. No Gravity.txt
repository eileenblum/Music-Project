Smell of blood and sweat
A sign of the warrior
As battle field roars
And noise crushes ears

As hell breaks loose
And death dominates
You are flying above
You are dancing in the heat

No gravity
No gravity... In the pit

Bodies running and crushing around
Madness and chaos command
Wall of death as privilege for the brave
No gravity in the pit

[Lead: Peter / Spider / Peter]

Smell of blood and sweat
A sign of the warrior
As battlefield roars
And noise crushes ears

As hell breaks loose
And death dominates
You are flying above
You are dancing in the heat

Revolt against the world
Against all holiness
I jump into the pit
To suck the pain from my life

All pain from my life
