Hell opened the gates
Roar hit the skies
The earth shakes in pain
Under thousand hooves

Pale fluttering feathers
All stained by rusty blood
Skulls crowned with silver
Claws reaching for your lives

Scream, wail, run and pray
Fire and agony, apocalyptic fate

Picture frozen in the eye
Last beat of your heart
Riding death approaching
On the burning wings of wrath

On the wings of wrath

Riders of the sudden death
Angels of decay
Unstoppable and merciless
Messengers of hell

Screaming hellish thunder
On the wings of shining steel
Heralds of apocalypse
Helllhounds unleashed

To kill [x3]

Angels of Steel
