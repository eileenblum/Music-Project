I found the truth in the book of holy law
God speaks to me day and night
Genocide and awe are all to follow
And I never stop to slay at his command

I will spread the graves like pestilence
And the reaper just became my best friend
Drinking blood and slaying all barbarians
This is my prayer, atonement and cleanse

Help me god to fight my weakness
Make my heart as cold as hardest steel
No mercy, no regrets nor despair
I am your warrior, your butcher and believer

Prayer to the god
Confession and deliverance
Prayer to the god
Performance and relief

Now burn!

Lives will burn for your glory
No child can escape from your flock
Even death cannot do us part
Lead my hand of your wrath

I exist to proclaim your domination
By my arm, my words and my faith
Grace for those who will follow
Pain and death for disbelief

Prayer to the god
Confession and deliverance
Prayer to the god
Performance and relief

Prayer to the god [3x]
My prayer to the god of war
