Lust leads to anger
And anger leads to death
War and insanity,
Corruption and decay
Cosmic race to dominate
Destructive insurrection
Rebel yell of madness
Chaos unleashed

War machines ready
To strike, kill and burn
Overwhelming rage
The empire!!!

[Lead: Spider /Peter]

Judgment day has come
All the race now convicted
No mercy no forgiveness
Genocide corroborated

Eruption of madness, terror and fear
The earth in agony, humanity condemned

All stars die in darkness
Like blackness swallowing space
Feel dark side dominion
And everlasting force around

[Lead: Spider]

Join the empire!!!
Join the empire!!!
Join the empire!!!
Enjoy the dark side
