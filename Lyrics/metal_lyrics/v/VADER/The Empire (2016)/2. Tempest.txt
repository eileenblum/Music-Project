Did I request thee
To enforce your will on me?
From womb to tomb
Being bound to you, maker?

Cast out and fallen
Into my empire
Upon the blood of my soul
That ever was or shall be

Now shunned into fury

A sign, which I know so well
The violent storm about
To surge the savage tempest in a fire
As I render your brightest day
Into your darkest night
Onward! War will form on my command

Dominion of my dreams
Unclean and unholy
Pain and sorrow
Fear me! All shadows are calling now!

[Lead: Spider]

War, chaos, fear and death
Beast inside consumes my humanity
Dark, winged shadow arised
Takes my soul to the void of hell

[Lead: Peter / Spider]

Once words were spoken
From the darkness you must fall
From torture and bliss
Battalions have arrived

As the wind cries
All demons roar in fury
Onward! War! Tempest uncontrolled
