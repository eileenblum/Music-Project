[Lyrics: Piotr Wiwczarek]

Betrayed, trapped in the abyss
Put in irons, stripped of all pride
Now world is my foe
World is my curse
Seed infected by the golden blaze

The words have turned to dead cyphers
Thoughts have turned to fear
My voice is now my sword
Free my hands!
Free my soul!
Give me back my wings!
Hear me now! Hear me now!
Out of the deep...

[Lead: Mauser]

Blinded lady and her still hungry blade
The dead infected by its blaze
Oh, eons! Strenghthen me!
After all that can't be our final act...

[Lead: Peter / Mauser]

Now
Hear me calling!
Hear me crying!
Hear me yelling!
Out of the deep...

World is your foe
World is your curse
Seed infected by the golden blaze
