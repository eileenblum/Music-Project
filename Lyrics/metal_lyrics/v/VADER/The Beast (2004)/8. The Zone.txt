[Lyrics: Pawel Frelik]

The zone is within
The zone is without
Let us go naked for a sign
Through the world of illusions
Operation mindfuck begins

[Lead: Mauser]

Post-shamans gather round
New exorcists of the thrall
The muftis of chaos rise hands
To work their memes on us

Secret mental utopias to spring
In chaos infected hearts and minds
Heretics of all world unite
And build their own zones for us

[Lead: Mauser]

Wild pagan children now dance
In lobbies of all world banks

[Lead: Mauser]

Nothing is true
Everything is permitted...

The zone is here
The zone is here
Let us go naked for a sign
Through the world of illusion
Operation mindfuck has begun....
