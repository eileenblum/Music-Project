[Lyrics: Piotr Wiwczarek]

Pointed towers
Crowned with signs of death
A night wraps the altar
Spectators made of stone
Shadow holding shadow
Creeping tongues and stare of horror
Words never spoken
A secret sealed with fear

But my fire cleans those rooms
My fire cleans that filth
Firebringer - I'm a watcher in disguise
Firebringer - call me so

[Lead: Mauser]

Slimy worms with teeth of gold
Words roar on the air
Kneeling crowd in terror
Blank human souls
Stammered prayer
For any hope

But my fire cleans the halls
My fire cleans that all

[Lead: Peter / Mauser]

Four riders
Poisoned wounded flesh
Armoured power
All ideas left to die
Shield of lies
Protectors with no face
Sword pointed on all of us...

But my fire cleans those fields
My fire cleans the earth
Firebringer - I'm a warrior in disguise
Firebringer - so call me now
