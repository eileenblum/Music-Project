[Lyrics: Pawel Frelik]

This is my love song
My great and secret show
My pornographic confession
Emblems of the season of fury
Flash and wobble and jar

I toss and scream
I shake and yell
I weep and curse
Like a madman
I can't sleep

I strip myself naked of my words
I lay them bare for all of you to see
More whimper then fury
For the world to listen, watch and laugh

I toss and scream...

I mumble the words
I do not understand
Figures appear at go at no will

I toss and scream...

I'm still in control of my mind

[Lead: Mauser]

So many voices
In my head
None of them can replace yours

I toss and scream...

Fever drums the war song in my brain
Perfect memory of time and place is a curse
Savage god raises his hand
In the fields of rape in my head
