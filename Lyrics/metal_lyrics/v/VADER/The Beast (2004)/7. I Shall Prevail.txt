[Lyrics: Pawel Frelik]

Resistance of matter, mind and time
Hardness of custom, code and law
Stifling curtains of the past
The realm of inertia sprawling around

I shall prevail
By any means necessary
I shall attain
By any means

Constriction of language in me
Dominance of whimper over bang
Tyranny of habit and fear
The yoke of the future on me

I shall prevail
By any means necessary
I shall transcend
By any means

[Lead: Mauser / Peter / Mauser / Peter]

Distrust of all those inside
The gasp of the center with no hold
The barbarian in the garden of eden
I am coming to claim what is mine

Constriction of language in me
Dominance of whimper over bang
Tyranny of habit and fear
The yoke of the future on me

I shall prevail
I shall attain
I shall transcend
By any means
