[Lyrics: Pawel Frelik]

Strings of the universe vibrate
Sending black messages ahead
Mutant waves across the world
Chaos is on the air

Wild static fills the ether
Noise raging around
Hacking brains with feedback
Chaos is on the air

Dark transmission
Open all channels now
Dark transmission
Blistering your ears

Void reverberates with echos
Tides of zeros and ones flood
Interference whipping your ears

Dark transmission
On the air
Trance, dark mission
Waves fill the brains

Transmission
Dark mission
Transmission
Dark mission...
