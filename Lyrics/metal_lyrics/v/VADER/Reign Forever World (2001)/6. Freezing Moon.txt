[Music &amp; Lyric: Mayhem]

Everything here is so old
Everything here is so dark
I remember it as from a dream
The corner at this time

Diabolical shapes floats by
Out from the dark
I remember it was here I died
By following freezing moon

It's night again
Night, You beautiful
I'll please my hunger of living humans
Night of hunger
Follow it's call
Follow the freezing moon

Darkness is growing
The eternity opens the cemetery lights up again
As in ancient times fallen souls

Die behind my steps
By following the freezing moon
