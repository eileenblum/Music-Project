[Music: Piotr Wiwczarek, Lyric: Lukasz Szurminski]

I am soaring
Among the endless mountains
Grim winter, crystal sight
Place forgotten by the gods
Unknown for me
Towers, bridges, structures
Mirage conjured in rock
Mirage conjured in ice.

Dark shadow blights
Paths rambling to the sky
Everything laid in frost
Winds of loneliness and despair
Is all I heard here?
Abyss haunted by Demons
Whirling picture of the old race

Bestial landscapes
Sound of imminent decay
Amorphous creatures
From time before time

The sun is glimmering

Caves dwelled during chaos time
Dangerous screams and whispers
The signs of the upcoming fate

The frozen ones...but alive
