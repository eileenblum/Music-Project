A man chosen to trace down a god
In the world between two houses
The Cycle unwinds so slowly
The middle worlds laid to waste

The Things that cries in the night
Defeated by the prince who was a thousand
All gods could not withhold the nameless
The terror that lurks outside

Creatures of light and darkness
Are born in great numbers
Creatures of light and darkness
My die and rise again

For the want of control
They can set all worlds afire
The hammer that smashes suns
Its work cannot be undone

Horus hermes trismagistos
The calls of the universal panthenon
Realities fold and submerge
When gods combat against their own blood

On my lips the name of the god
Whose face no one remembers
Eternal feud of those of the unlight
Set the destoryer, the lord of chaos stomps down

Creatures of light and darkness
Are born in great numbers
Creatures of light and darkness
My die and rise again

They're creatures of light and darkness
They're creatures of light and darkness
They're creatures of light and darkness
They'll die but shall rise again
