Black cities hidden in the dark
Among the waters, beneath the seas
Horrible thoughts destroy the minds
Through the endless nights

You don't know what's to come
While I'm chanting incantations
Stay away and don't play
With This, you'll never understand

Buried in the frozen seas
Tombs of forgotten Gods
Who came forth from blackened stars
A breath of centuries here

A different, inconceivable cult
Shreds of the eternal, endless Circle
Gates to Hell for chosen ones
Awaked from mortality

You don't know what's to come
While I'm chanting incantations
Stay away and don't play
With This, you'll never understand
and you never understood

This is not death - which can eternal lie
But with the strange eons - even Death may die
Words written long ago - in sacred book of Might
The lethal, omnious powers - eclipsing all the light

The breaking, unseen ice - a deadly fate's anger
Nightmarish ghosts - spectra and souls
The burning fire-brands - in every open mind
And eyes shattered - of timid fools

Madness is so strange blessing
If you nothing understand
That's better to be dead
When the Gods soon descend

Awaiting in horrific peace
The Master of All is dozing
His time yet hasn't come
His hour remains unknown

You don't know what's to come
While I'm chanting incantations
Stay away and don't play
With This, you'll never understand
Never!
