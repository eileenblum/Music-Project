["The red passage of Samadhi, Blood-Vision"]
[Kenneth Grant]

A dive up with head down
moth-winged Angel's shriek
excretion condensed
diginity disrespect

The Crown of Manhood
means nothing here
not for the sheep they pray
they bless the buther's knife

A chant of turbid light
sombre consolation
caryr me, oh Hydra Mother
to gods of festering wounds

The Crown of Manhood
means nothing here
not for the sheep they pray
they bless the buther's knife

A chant of turbid light
sombre consolation
carry me, of Hydra Mother
to gods of festering wounds
