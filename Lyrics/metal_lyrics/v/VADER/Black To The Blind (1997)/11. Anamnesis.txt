[The original and most fantastic Gnosis (out of which the Xtian version arose)]
[derived from leaskages from the Egyptian mysteries. The main body, however,]
[died out with the priests who kept their silence.]
[E. E. Rehmus "The magician's dictionary"]

To stem the current is no vain attempt
the Knowledge preserved for us alone
in this world of mud and rust
decipher what is coded by our hands

Defiled our names
soiled glory of gods
dismal new faith
spawn of deliverence

Oh Wisdom formless and odious
the sexless parent of disbelief
restricting rules they can make
means nothing to Your Being

Defiled our names
soiled glory of gods
dismal new faith
spawn of deliverence

Restore what was broken
no single word is missed
with fiery tongues speak to us
to souls gashed, souls hardened

Oh Wisdom formless and odious
the sexless parent of disbelief
restricting rules they can make
means nothing to Your Being

Defiled our names
soiled glory of gods
dismal new faith
spawn of deliverence

This conceit waste
regain we must
on Hermes' touch
