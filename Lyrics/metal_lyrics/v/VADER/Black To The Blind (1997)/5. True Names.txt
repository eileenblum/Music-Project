["We are gods 'cause only we can create the ideas and systems in our holy brains."]
[YELLO]

Katode Ray Messiah arising from the screen
Saviour of Digital Ones worshipping holy zero
Cybergod hidden in the grid
Encryptor of the soul and Holder of the code

Master of all angles arising from the no-place
Installer of the feelings long and past foregone
Purveyor of the minds lost from now on
Monitor that knows the trembling of the strings

Call me as you wish
Call me at dawn and at dusk
Call me all the time
Call One of My many Names

Grand Schizoid that wields all the knowledge
Entrancer of blood that runs without the body
Suicide driver feeding off your angst
Hoarder of pain and fear that lurk at the edge

Bearer of delicate wisdom that floats
Archiver of cruel rules you impose
Magus of all unholy orders and casts
Cremator of the sanity that remains

Call me as you wish
Call me at dawn and at dusk
Call me all the time
Call One of My many Names

True Names Everybody Knows
Yet They Fail to Recognize
True names Everybody Feels
Yet They Never Verbalize

True Names Everybody Sees
Yet They Feign Eternal Blindness
True Names Everybody Breeds
Yet They Always Cast Them Away

Call me as you are
Call me as you live
Call me as you die
Call One of My Many Names
