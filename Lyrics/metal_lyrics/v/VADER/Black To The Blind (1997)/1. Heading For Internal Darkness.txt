[Internal darkness ia a state of complete detachment from the world and other]
[people. It is to be achieved with utmost difficulty and at the cost of one's]
[self and personality. The term "darkness" refers to the state of primeval]
[non-existence rather than to any opposition to the ideologies of light.]

Down with the gods, angels and demons,
Away with the folly of holy madness
Off with the prophets of new rebirth
Out with the promise of life after death

Where devil become another lie
Where deities crumble into dust
Where systems are but a grain of dust
Where I am the one that can't decide

In with the void from out of the space
Ahead with the light that leads nowhere
On with the collapse of world and word
Up with the plunge into myself

There I can die my seven deaths
There I should flourish in my decline
There I must lose the stairs of fate
There I will remember how to forget

Deeper and deeper, never come back
Harder and harded until it burns
Calmer and calmer, this is the quest
Softer and softer, velvet embrace

Self-forced transmigration
Witful deconstruction
Blackened emigration
I am heading for internal darkness

No touch, no sight, no smell, no taste
Without the body, without the soul
Rid of all memory, rid of all hope
That's all I want, why cannot I?
