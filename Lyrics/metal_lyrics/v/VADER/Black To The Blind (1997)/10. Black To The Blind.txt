["Black to the blind" is a quotation from "BOOK OF THE LAW" (LIBER AL vel]
[LEGIS), written down by A. Crowley. Years later he commented it thus: "The]
[uninitiated perceive only darkness in night: the wise perceive the golden]
[stars in the vault of azure." The same can be said of us, worshipping the]
[Goddess in the true riteless ceremony of existence.]

Black to the blind is She above
and black to the blind we seem to be
god-fearing sheep will never perceive
the embodiment of the lust divine

Nothingness thickens and bends down
a new creation taking its primal breath
this world's eternity vacuum unfolds
dissolution of things stiff and dead

Black to the blind

Starry transocean of Goddess' womb
pleasures landscapes and drops of pain
from vulva furnace in gracious trance
dark theology explained in light

Trample the temple of gods aborted
body denial, servile renouncement
turn your eyes inward and chant
unto the Gate of self-born None

Black to the blind

Heresy of the most superior kind
to all of you I preach clearly now
let no rapture be out of reach
death is easy, life means extasy

Black to the blind seems She Above
blue and gold is seen to the seeing
intoxicate the inner expressions
to keep the eyes aware and vigilant

Black to the blind is She above
and black to the blind we seem to be
god-fearing sheep will never perceive
the embodiment of the lust divine

Trample the temple of gods aborted
body denial, servile renouncement
turn your eyes inward and chant
unto the Gate of self-born None

Black to the blind
