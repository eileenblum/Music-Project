[The lyric is a necessarily very general and simplified take on Chaos Magick -]
[a modern system of thought that allows for the combination of mixing of all]
[other systems and canons as long as they suit purposes of a mage.]

Persistence of vision is not enough
The common point is a law
All systems do converge at last
The mage's will is done

The fractal light
Chaos controls
The fractal light

No bonds, no checks, no nots
All is permitted now
The sphere glows red in the dark
The navel's point is marked

The fractal light
Chaos controls
The fractal light

Take all the runes, collect the rites
The psychonaut departs right now
The world is open before your arms
Evolve, change, and rise

Persistence of vision is not enough
The common point is a law
All systems do converge at last
The mage's will is done

The fractal light
Chaos controls
The fractal light
