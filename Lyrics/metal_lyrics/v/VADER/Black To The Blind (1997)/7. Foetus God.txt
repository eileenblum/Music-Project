["For the high point their teology consists of these two things: hissing at]
[demons and skething the cross on their foreheads."]
[Flavius Claudius Julianus (332-363)]
[Roman Caesar (Julian the Apostate) (361-363)]

["What are the fruits of Chrisianity? Bigotry, superstition and persecution."]
[James Madison (1751-1836)]
[US fourth President (1809-1817)]

Foetus god descends in silence
a bastard deity for us to believe
blasphemy of gen collage
in backward sombre involution

Foetus god abortion of the Diine
latent rape of wet, lewd womb
man-made myth to blunt in mind
the vilest offence of five senses

Undone miracles never to come
invalid rise of slave thought
the only light its dawn can shed
is from burnt wisdom and shimmering greed

Thine is not the Kingdom
no trace of strength I see
no Mercy to expect
a seed of claws upon your lips

As pure wit turns into effusions
we, snakes of Truth, ex and devour
gods manifested in twisted images
astrally hunted in shadow and soul

Sweet holy shiftless godsend meat
I bet you listen to this psalm of me

Sweet holy shiftless godsend meat
I bet you listen to this psalm of me
little by little, one by one
the thorns become the real crown

Thine is not the Kingdom
no trace of strength I see
no Mercy to expect
a seed of claws upon your lips
