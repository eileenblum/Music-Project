Our troops are ready to plunder and burn
Lightning strikes on command
Mark of death on the shining steel

We proudly hold the black banners high
Marching through the enemy's land
We sing the Devil's song

Always ready to lead and to die
We smile as the war reigns
And never kneel when the death is close

We proudly hold the black banners high
Marching through the enemy's land
We sing the Devil's song

Who else can trust so much the commanding Gods
To sacrifice life, soul and the world
Now war is lost, our tombs are cursed
Please, pray for us in Hell
