Somewhere, nowhere
A man became a God
Spreading words and lines
Washing brains of sick believers
Visions scratched in a book

Indoctrination, mind castration
Rules of pain and suffer
False love with no regret

Lord of thorns
Flesh, blood and pain
Pathetic incarnation of human shame and slavery

The dead stretched on the wood
Infecting groans and tears
Promise of a dead-land
Lies that burn all hope now

"I send my pain among you all
Now feel the thorns in your souls
I meet you all in promised land
Just leave your flesh and bones"

Mortal burden like disease
Roots in hearts with the lies
Blinded crowd with no volition
Highway to the grave

Lord of thorns
A cult of the dead
Master of illusions
A path to the dead end

Lord of thorns
Flesh, blood and pain
Lord of thorns
Your slavery and shame
