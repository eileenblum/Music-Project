[Extreme Noise Terror cover]"Man" is superior,
"Man" has the might
He's under the impression he has the right
To take the earth and do as he will
And leave nothing but a deformed hell

Raping the earth and we don't seem to care
Soon there will be no life left here

With such stupidity we are raping the earth
It's been on the decline since man's birth
The harmony of nature is being upturned
Compassion not destruction must be learned

Raping the earth
