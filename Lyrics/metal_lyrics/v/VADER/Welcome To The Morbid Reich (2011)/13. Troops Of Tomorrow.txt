[The Exploited cover]Troops of tomorrow
Troops of tomorrow

We're troops of tomorrow
We're hanging round today
We're playing tough music
Cos it's hard time money

We need a new solution
We want it quick
We're getting frustrated
It's making us sick

We ain't got bright future
We bought it on the never never
Don't want to be city prisoners
We ain't gonna live forever

We gotta stop that dreaming
We've gotta pick up that gun
We're troops of tomorrow
We've got a new vision
