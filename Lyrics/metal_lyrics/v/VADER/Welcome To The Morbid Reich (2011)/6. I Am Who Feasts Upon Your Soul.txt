I am who listens to the wishes and prayers
Every time as you kneel by my feet
I am the oppressing whisper in your head
In time when desire controls and commands

My piercing eyes never fall asleep
I smile to the tears going down your cheek
My cold touch is what you fear in the night
My breath is the path to the gate of your Hell

My power may steal your voice from a throat
I am the low in this world of sin
Unknown, untouched
"I am the God in my domain"
