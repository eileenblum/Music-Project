No more a thing I knew... transformed - transfigured
Transcended... in an endless progress cycle
DNA metamorphosis... of the dying cells
Into something that will last... last forever
Immortal... my soul... alone under...
The cracking skies... on trembling Earth
Closing the eye... of blinding Sun
WHO AM I? - a question... already answered
I am who I am... no less, no more
Destined to be... never to extinct
Remaining after... everything dies
Remaining... a Dog Star's Son... beyond the Sun
For ever... and more
