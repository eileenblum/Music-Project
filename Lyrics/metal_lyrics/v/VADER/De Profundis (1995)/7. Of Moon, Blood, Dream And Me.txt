Inseminating the cunts of dozing whores
Testing the fruits of forbidden bid 
Making their dreams the sperm-wet seas 
Not an incubi of your infantile knowledge
Much more than you're to understand
Much more than you will ever kill

Of moon, blood, dream and me...

Making the vaginas tense as the coldness touches
To leave the female race satisfied 'til death
Hurrying taste of the feel
Of woman's lips clenched in sucking the juices
From nephilim's beings, impatient as hell itself
Really much more than you can understand

My children, of moon you are
Rise to join at the night

With head down I penetrate their minds before I go too deep
Sucking your lives from the chakras
Defenseless in the nightly daze
Only a few will feel my semen
The freezing jewels as real as flesh
My children of moon they are
Will rise soon to join their father

Astral shapes with sin written into every more
And with love to me, who gave them wombs
Of women naked, in sleep too deep
To sense their weight and breath on hair
While the spectres sink between the legs
Of belles dreaming their sickest dreams

My children of moon you are
Join me!

Making the vaginas tense as the coldness touches
To leave the female race satisfied 'til death
Hurrying taste of the feel
Of woman's lips clenched in sucking the juices
From nephilim's beings, impatient as hell itself
Really much more than you can understand

My children of moon you are
Rise to join your father 
Rise!
You're children of me!
