The mighty lord of universe
That moves the stars above
Hearken and remember
Your spawn of race of men

... Here is the key
IA - to set the madness free

Ruler of the underworld
Who came from blackened stars
I hear you in my dreams
Your voice is calling me again

I am the lord of darkness
The power and the knowledge of the gods
Before me was made nothing that was made
I am the ancient race

I feel forgotten world
Where only madness dwells
And all the creatures
Hail the name of Kingu

I am the lord of hell
No man may seek my resting place
Before me was made nothing that was made
I am the father of the race

Forbidden caverns in the ground filled with the evil spawn
Still waiting for the prophesied revival
And when collapsed stars come into sight
They'll rise up to rule the Earth again

'cause they're rulers of the world

Lunatic screams inside your mind tear your souls apart
You're the chosen one to join your primal being
The ultimate revolt like transformation of the form
Will bring to ruin the Nazarene's empire

'cause you are rulers of the world
