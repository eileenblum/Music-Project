We - from the blood of the dead
We're burning with fury and hate
Bloody vengeance still growing in us
Waiting for mighty lords who'll praise again

Cry of the dreaming-dead
Still existing in my head
They are spawn of the lords
And venom of the evil gods
Through the caverns of the earth the creep
Still waiting for the right time
They revolt against the holiness
Leading me the mighty realm of madness

Primal lords
Eternal creatures of the earth
Moved before the upcoming revolt
Listen to your sickest dreams
Awakening of the fallen is written in us

Secular war
Among the giants of universe
And race of man created in hate
Lead your thoughts beyond the time
And wake up the ancestry of our entity

Distant worlds
Abominations unaffected
Waiting for the rebirth of the ancient race
All creatures of darkness arise
I open my mind for coming of the lords
