A soul in blackness once enslaved
Reaching an outer dimension
To get my unrest slayed
Wisdom ideas in seven steps

I saw them flying, falling, dying
Immortal till the strength's come
Dipped in pains of disdain
Humbling themselves until dawns

An outer space, inconceivable
Forbidden regions for the mortal ones
You find out the mysterious way
And touch the beginning of time before the light

I saw them flying, falling, dying
Immortal till the strength's come
Dipped in pains of disdain
Humbling themselves until dawns

Magick triumphers whisper with drone
Of their victory, napping through the ages
A cipher of books of no return
To bring you near by their calm

Ritual dementia hour to be higher
Prenatal atavism exploding again
Phantasmagorial ones awakening
To lay their power onto me

I saw them flying, falling, dying
Immortal till the strength's come
Dipped in pains of disdain
I saw them falling down
