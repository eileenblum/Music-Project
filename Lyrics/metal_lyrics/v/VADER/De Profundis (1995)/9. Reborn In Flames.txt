Comes the time of fear and pain
The human race is bleeding away!
The earth covered by ashes and flesh
Dying in terrible decay
Freezing winds freezing it all
What fire hasn't burnt
Blackened blood flooding the graves
Messiah will never return!

Unholy words of ancient prophecy
Now come true - the dead rise from hell...

Toxic storms attack from the sky
Spreading the light of deadly pleasure
Nuclear mutants buried alive
In blasting dust of dying world
Atomic falls putrefy human brains
The living dead creep in bloody bog
The lord of hate was awaken by death
Before you die, can see the end!

All will burn in his breath
His eyes paralyze every life
The demons wheel above his head
Like vultures seeking the flesh
All will burn in his breath
His eyes paralyze every life
All demons transformed into grubs
To make the globe a stinking rot

Born to destroy the holy ghost to the end
Now finished wars of God
His name is the Exterminator
Covering the earth with vaporous rot
The real messiah reborn in flames
Creator was the hell
He's killer of the world of the living
The dead worship his majesty

Comes the time of wrath and death
Heaven has turned blood-red fire
Crucified souls vomiting the blood
In embrace of mortal desire
Freezing winds that froze that all
What fire has already burnt
Blackened blood flooding the corpses
Messiah will never return!
No return!!!
