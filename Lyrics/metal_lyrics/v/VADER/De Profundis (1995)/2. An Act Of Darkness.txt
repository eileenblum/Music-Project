An act of darkness is in us
Holy times and sacred season sites
Oh, black hole empty God
Let them devour their own light

An elevenfold cross eclipse
Symmetric fourness not to be found
Brightness protons vibrate outside
The 10th Aire very unGod

Blind larvae of moonlight souls
Trapped in the saliva of Times
Root their lairs in mucus of the void
A name of none and nothing

An elevenfold cross eclipse
Symmetric fourness not to be found
Brightness protons vibrate outside
The 10th Aire very unGod

A non-form of all-forms is
The paradox of the Highest Monads
Haughty Lords, Gehenna below
Govern those who govern

An elevenfold cross eclipse
Symmetric fourness not to be found
Brightness protons vibrate outside
The 10th Aire very unGod
