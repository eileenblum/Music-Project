[Music: Piotr Wiwczarek, Lyrics: Piotr Wiwczarek]

Melted world
Chaos exonerated - dominates
Fire walks around...
Blast
Nuclear attack - total genocide
All gates are wide opened now!

But we are here
We will survive
With scorched wings spread
We'll fly above

Look upon the red horizon
New generation comes now
The future, the seed of fire
Soon we'll absorb you all

[Lead: Peter]

But we are here
We will survive
With scorched wings spread

So look upon the red horizon
New generation comes now
The future, the seed of fire
Soon we'll absorb you all
