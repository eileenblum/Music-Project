[Music: Piotr Wiwczarek, Lyrics: Piotr Wiwczarek]

HATE - All I see is blood red
PAIN - like thorns in my heart
KILL - Cold steel in my hands
DIE - Those motherfuckers have to pay

ANGER! - My mind burns
ANGER! - All veins explode
ANGER!- Blinded eyes
ANGER!!! And pain...

BURN - Fire walks with me
MADNESS - It is all I feel
Is there any chance - to save it all
And touch our Earth not soaked with blood....

[Lead: Marek / Peter]

HATE - All I see is blood
PAIN - like nails in my hands
KILL - many pierced fleshes
DIE - Now all have to pay

ANGER! - My mind burns
ANGER! - All veins explode
ANGER! - Blinded eyes
ANGER! - World's collapse! ...now
