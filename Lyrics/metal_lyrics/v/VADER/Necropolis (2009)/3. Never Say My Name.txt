[Music: Piotr Wiwczarek, Lyrics: Piotr Wiwczarek]

Since your rebirth
I am always with you
Deep in your mind
Creative, protective
And never forget it...

I was and I am
In your thoughts and your breath
I dwell in your dreams
I am your life and your death

[Lead: Peter / Marek]

I stay with you
Every day, every night
You hear my whispers
I am your guide

So never again
Say my name aloud
Protect what you've got
And keep it away from the crowd
