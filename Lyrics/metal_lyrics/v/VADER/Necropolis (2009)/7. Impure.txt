(Music: Piotr Wiwczarek, Lyrics: Harry Maat)

I have roamed the unseen lands
My body drenched with sulfur blood
I walk Their paths and read Their books
None led to cleanse me
So cursed I dwell in silence
In darkness as my guide
To the next who say: "I am..."
And walk His way...
again....

I know I will be shunned
No deity takes my offering
Cut off from lives of many
None dare to touch impure...

Who is next?
Who's gonna fail me now?
My raped soul, unwanted
Still forced to be alone
Still alone...

[Lead: Peter]

Who is next?
Who's gonna fail me now?
My raped soul, unwanted
Still forced to be alone
But vengeance in my mind
So dark for those who seek it
My breath, my touch
In purest form - IMPURITY!
