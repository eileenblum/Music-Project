[Music: Piotr Wiwczarek, Lyrics: Harry Maat]

[Lead: Peter]

Ground is trembling, severe stench engulfs
Fear possesses the weak being you are
With convulsive tremble of darkness,
our legions move, we are the horde

We come from the absence of light!

Squalor poisons the ground we walk
Diminishing who pray the falseness of the God
I am horde! We are horde! Yes, we are!!!

Intense fear, the trail you leave
Leads to vulgar death
We erupt the feast of the blackest path
Our touch alone, sets in soul bleed
Draining the wretched life from your bones
We bring the suffering!

[Lead: Peter]

We are horde!
Brutality unseen before
Feeble human, on your knees to die
We bring the suffer
We are horde
Yes, we are!

Futile ways to save your flesh
Once we are you shall not live
Fading light drained from your eyes
As your puny god laughs about your pain

We are horde!
We bring the suffer!
We are the horde!
We are who benighted
From absence of life
Yes, we are!
