[Music: Piotr Wiwczarek, Lyrics: Piotr Wiwczarek]

Born in the deepest lake of tears
From the crypts, my lair I rise
Summoned by cruelty and pain
With southern blow I arrive
In blackest territory of your soul
Emptiness just waiting for fill
I come bringing relief
Like a shadow on the waste

I smell your excitement... south as I arrive!

[Lead: Peter]

Hate and desire is like a prayer
So I spread my wings on the wind
I howl wild in my madness
I come to you tonight
...open your soul for me!

[Lead: Peter]

Born in the deepest lake of tears
From the crypts, my liar I rise
Summoned by cruelty and pain
With southern blow I arrive

So I spread my wings on the wing
I howl wild in my dreams
I come to you tonight
...to raise the undead
