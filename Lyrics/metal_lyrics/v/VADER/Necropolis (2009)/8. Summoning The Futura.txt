I conjure thee, o ancestor of the gods!
I summon thee, creature of darkness by the words of darkness!
I summon thee, creature of hatred by the words of hatred!
I summon thee, creature of the wastes, by the rites of waste!
I summon thee, creature of pain, by the words of pain!
I summon thee and call thee forth from thy abode in darkness!
I evoke thee from thy resting place in the bowels of the Earth!
May the dead rise!
