[Music: Piotr Wiwczarek, Lyrics: Piotr Wiwczarek]

Burning ashes consuming dying world
Total cemetery infected by the living
Final act, metamorphosis
Screaming to release the wrath and pain

Raise!!! ...the undead
Awake and roar
Rise!!! ...of the undead
To rule again...

Now alive - awakened to awake
Yet not forgotten spirit dwelling in a deep
Rise above again!
And give us back the pride
Crush the false humanity
Hear us, who respect your flame

[Lead: Peter]

Smell of the rotting fleshes
- putrefaction cover all around
The ground is moving, crosses fall
- the apocalypse was only the beginning
Hands pointing the burning skies
- where the guilty one wears the stolen crown
Enough!!! Our slumber is just broken
- ...and the false and his slaves must be gone!!!

We all calling judge from burning pits of Hell
Released by death - Undead we became
No more suffering for us and our brothers
Vengeance is about to begin...

Raise!!! ...the undead
Awake and roar
Rise!!! ...of the undead
To rule again...
Rise!!! ...the undead
Scream it loud!!!
RISE!!!
