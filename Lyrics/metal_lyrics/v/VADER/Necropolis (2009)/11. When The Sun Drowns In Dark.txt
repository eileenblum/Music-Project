[Music: Piotr Wiwczarek, Lyrics: Harry Maat]

Walk the hidden ways of mysterious, iniquity lands.
Paved with roads of thorns.
Light has diminished to none.
A world of total splendor,
Ravenous for devotion.
Where all gods possess the thrones.
Worshipped by those with no will.

A rapturous love, their moral goodness.
With no emotion, they kill dissimilarity
Indisputable allegiance to wicked ways.
Overthrown all their teachings.
The abrupt failure of now impaled beings.
Their temples burn in blazing fire.
All life absorbed by her darkness
Never to return again,

Echoes of the nameless.
Erupt from her womb.
Where the sun drowns in dark,
The left hand path engulfs.

Only when the one who fell,
Betrayed by their lies,
Made her way to their icon doors.
And evoke the darkness

She made the sun disappear
All stars collapse and daylight fades.
She has a grip on all what was.

[Lead: Marek / Peter]

Overthrown their teachings.
Abrupt failure of now impaled beings.
Their temples burn in flames.
As her grip is ferocious.
When the sun has drowned in dark.
All that ever was, will be only a memory.
And your tears will be fuel to her reign.

Echoes of the nameless.
Erupt from her womb.
Where the sun drowns in dark,
The left hand path engulfs.
