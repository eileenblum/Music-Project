[Music: Mike Torrao / Lyrics: Jeff Beccera]

Arise from the dead and attack from the grave
The killing won't stop until first light
We'll bring you to hell because we want to enslave
Soul will be frozen with fright

We'll break through the crust, leave from our crypts
Protected by eternal life
Lay down the laws from our satanic scripts
Bringing you nothing but strife

Death metal
Kill them pigs

Ruling you cities, controlling your towns
Entrapped in your worst nightmare
Piercing your ears with the horrible sound
Casting my exclusive stare

Lucifer laughs, his needs are fulfilled
The flames are now burning hot
Bodies are burning, the people are killed
Torture reason we fought

Death metal
Kill them pigs

Now we take over and rule by death metal
Enjoy our long wanted reign
Blood's what we want and we won't settle
Until we drive you insane

Attacking the young and killing the old
Pleeding with every heart beat
Darkness has fallen and your soul is sold
Claws will dig into your meat

When the sun doesn't rise and the day is like night
Know that your life is at its end
Rendered helpless so scream out fright
Death metal came in the wind
Death metal
