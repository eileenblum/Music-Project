[Originally performed by Sodom]
[Music: Sodom / Lyrics: Tom Angelripper]

It's time to die
Death stands behind the doors
Satan sends his warriors
Demons break out of hell

Shrill cries
Angel dies
Shrill cries
Outbreak of evil

With sword and axes
They fight hard
In a massacre
They feel the hot smart

None can survive
People will destroy
Souls like hell
Where devils make a toy
