[Music: Tom Warrior / Lyrics: Tom Warrior]

See the portal, gate to madness
Locked forever in a veil of shame
Deny extraction - thirst for disgrace
Watch his break - the emperor's killed
Light of the day - shadow from beyond
Scaffold of steel - the throne has gone

Dethroned emperor
(The) foot of the stairs, dimension in might
The king sits, (his) eyes are glass
Growing of the small - the laughter's fall
Can you deny - remaining cries?
Descent of the lords - into te trap
Existence and hate - unseen gate
