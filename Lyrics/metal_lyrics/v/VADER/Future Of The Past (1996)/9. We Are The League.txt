[Music: Anti-Nowhere League / Lyrics: Piotr Wiwczarek]

Another bloody night
Another damned place
My head is fucked up
I've got another face
Too many bites
I feel like on high
But the hunger's still growing
So - do you wanna die?

We are the league
We're extraneous to you
We are the league
We are the anti-man
Without being seen

(So) don't play with me, fool!
We're league of the hell
And we are the strong

We are the league
We are the league
We are the league
The anti-christian league

When the moon is round
We're feeling the pain
Leaving the crypts
They are our domain
Blood suckin' race
Madness living in the eyes
No fuckin' mercy
You won't find it in us

We are the league
And we are the sin
We are the league
And we do always win
A fuckin' noise
You don't even know
A mighty ways
(Still) out of the law

We are giving a bliss
We are giving extasy
Eternal live
No ending fantasy
Joy on the earth
Joy in the hell
Unite with the league
we're unholy spell

We are the league
And we are insane
We are the league
And we have not the name
Without the souls
Our bodies supreme
I'm coming to bite
You know, what does it mean
