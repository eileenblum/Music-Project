[Originally performed by Dark Angel]
[Music: Jim Durkin / Lyrics: Jim Durkin, Don Doty]

You fall before us, shattered in vain
You thrash about us, screaming in pain
Tortured and flaming, you're on your knees
you fucking whores, it's us you must please

We'll give you merciless
We'll give you merciless
We'll give you merciless
We'll give you merciless... death!!!

Stand up and bang, till you fall the floor
The sound is so deafening, it can't be ignored
The place is burning, your minds are destroyed
Devastated and helpless, you're left here to die

The angels has landed - judgement has come
Your death has arrived, faster than some
The darkness descending upon heaven's gates
Your soul is now promised and you know that
We'll wait!!!

We'll give you...
