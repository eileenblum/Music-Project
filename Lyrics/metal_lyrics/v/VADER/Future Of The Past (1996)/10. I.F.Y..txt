[Music: Depeche Mode / Lyrics: Piotr Wiwczarek]

I feel you
Your son is dead
I feel you
Within my mind
You're fearing me
Still fearing me
My kingdom comes
You tried to do
To lead me through eternity

But this is the morning of our law
And this is the dawning of our law

I hear you
Your fadin' voice
I feel you
Die on the cross
The joy it brings
When heaven burns
Your golden gates
Don't try to do
'Cause I'll kill you eternally

This is the dawning of fallen one
And this is is the fall of your nailed son

I kill you
Your holy soul
And I kill more
I feel you
Your suffer-son
My kingdom comes
I feel you
Each move you make
I feel you
What for you wait
Where angels sing
I spread my wings
See my rebirth
I'll take you down
To glory's throne
Don't ask me... why?
