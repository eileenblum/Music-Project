What is this that stands before me?
Figure in black which points at me
Turn around quick, and start to run
Find out I'm the chosen one
Oh nooooo!

Big black shape with eyes of fire
Telling people their desire
Satan's sitting there, he's smiling
Watches those flames get higher and higher
Oh no, no, please help me!

Is it the end my friend?
Satan's coming 'round the bend
People running 'cause they're scared
The people better go and beware!
No, no, please no!

The band's line-up on this album is:

Peter (voc, g, invocations)
Doc (dr)
China (g)
Shambo (b)

Additional guitar solo in Black Sabbath by Greg Skawinski
