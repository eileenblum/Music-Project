Raising my head to yell my life out
standing naked, strained as a dying worm
with body of light gleaming like my disquiet
with myriads of stars not-to-be-seen

Here to cry the glassy anguish
of souls dwelling in darkness that fell
my throat is DAÃTH, the seal is breaking
ZONAI screaming the vows of frozen winds
of shapes winged - we should be left behind
we, lightnings turned into pillars
torn into shreds, in stillborn screams
thembling with woes of fiery cycles

PAZ - to be as they
yea, I say, to be as they
an oath and order to be heard
a sigil and cypher to be seen
OL SONUF VAORESAJI
and that's the truth, you will taste it...

Ãtheric dimensions of cocoon sleepers
Waters, Earthes and Fyres not given to us
mumbling the calls of Aires alone
laying the tablets carved in flesh
