Man has the right to love but also the right to hate. There is no love without hate.
As A.S. LaVey said: "The hunter must hunt. The moment he stops, he becomes the hunted."

War!!!
This means war
Your weakness makes me sick
Eternal struggle
The iron will of life
Prayer to the father-war
Under the sign of hammer of Thor
In the storm of steel
Raise, raise the spirit
Of Eternal Warrior
Till Victory!

Rivers of blood of innocents
Surrounding my feet
Can You hear it?
The last whisper of Christ...

I am laying siege to Christians
Under the flag of hate
Under the flag of death's head
Eternal cycle of struggle
Between the nature and heaven
Trampling the lamb
With poker-faced
And ice in eyes
Dead bodies and stench of fear
Holy legions crushed
Hail Victory!

I am calling death
Mortals are nothing for me
Inverted tree of Elhaz
Is the sing of the clan
Rebels souls on the rebel land
Hot winds cast the damned
Into the pits of hell

Rivers of blood of innocents
Surrounding my feet

Now You can hear
The last cry of Christ!
