Another land, another see
The road that never ceases
To lie ahead and beckon still
Though legs and feet are weary

Another woman, another man
The lust that never ceases
To fill the greed for pain and revel
Though body yield for fatigue

Another me, yet still the same
Another me, yet you will know me
Another me, yet I have never left
Another me to find the way back home

Another grail, another god
The quest that never ceases
To quench the yearning for the Aleph
Though mind and soul are tired

Another life, another death
The circle that never breaks
To stop this journey set for me
By no-one but myself
