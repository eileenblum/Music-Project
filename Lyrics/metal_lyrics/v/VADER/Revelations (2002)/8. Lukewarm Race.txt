No visions anymore
But we don't ask for them
The Darkness never parts
'cause we don't seek the heat

(We are) Lukewarm race
No folly in our minds
We're lukewarm race
Not much touches us

The angels in the jar
We have not seen for years
No wonder in our souls
That have so grown in fat

(we are) Lukewarm race...

We never long
We never crave
And only sometimes in the Night
We dream of path and weep
(we never have a need...)

No visions anymore
We don't ask for them
The Darkness never parts
'cause we don't seek the heat

(We are) Lukewarm race...
