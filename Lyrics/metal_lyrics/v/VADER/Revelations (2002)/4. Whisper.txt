Jaunting on maps of our bodies
We wandering through vastness of inner and outer space
Through and through
Immersed in love of will.

I am laying on my back
And gazing at inky black sky
Serpent shapes
Moves of your hands
The mind is burning
Drowned in carnal desires
Inflowing pictures
Visions of dead world

Fancy visions of dead world
Gives me shiver when
You caresses my body
Emptiness beyond
We are alone on this earth
And all treasures of the world
Belong to us

The sacrilege of love
And sacrificial love
Weals are wandering on your skin
You are wielding my sword

This is the greatest gift
We received from mother Earth
So let's play this game

Bodies surrounded by fire
And envy of stars
Stimulation of every part
Of mind, body and soul

Our never-ending ritual
Will always go on
Like war never ends
Like fall always comes
Like stars are shining
On nightly sky
Our love of will
Will go on
To eternal death
Of the human world.
