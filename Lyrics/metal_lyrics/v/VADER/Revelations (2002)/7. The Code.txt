"All this chaos in heads of quarter intelligentsia comes from that science
is really not for everybody."
[Hugo Steinhaus "Memoirs and Notes"]

We are dazed
Accountability, pressure
We are aghast
Expansiveness toward
Thee infinite
The jigsaw of contents
The maze of assessments

Wire- tapping nature
The master of disguise
We are peripheral device
Only five pointed star
Only binary code

Zero dot One
Persistence of searching
Mode is indirect
Relays of shimmering light
Like lines of an encephalogram

Converge in cataleptic sleep
Crackling immersing minds
In Matrix life, here
Treasures of humankind
Are everything and nothing

Conversion tables of modernity
Formulas sufficient for mentally retarded
Who never understand
That we have got a few
Supplemental ways!
