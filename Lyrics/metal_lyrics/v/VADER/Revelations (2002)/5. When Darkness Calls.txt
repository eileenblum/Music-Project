In the midst of wave
Unconceivable Evil
And we are drowning down
Into the forgotten city
Oxygen becoming treasure
Is it time to choose
...yes, it is...
We plunging in madness
In the depths of madness
Into the light in the end
Of this terrible journey

Guided by figure sculpted in ivory
Place, where absence of life
Does not mean morality
Imagination in one with memory
And memories are so real
Unveiling the mystery
Storm choirs are wailing
Splendid structures
Going out searchlight

In the midst of wave
Unconceivable Evil
And we are drowning down
Into the forgotten city
It's time to choose
And I am choosing
The Unknown...
