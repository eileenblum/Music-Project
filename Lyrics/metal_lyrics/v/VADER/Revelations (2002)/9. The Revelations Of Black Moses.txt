I see three peaks: one for Hell, one for heaven, one for Grand Mystery
In Hell three lakes: of burning tar, of vermin and of ice- all brimming with sinners
And Devils larger then Daemons with horns made of fire

Then I see heaven on the second mountain
The city of gold and honey with saints...
All joyful and towering in their glory

There I see two pious and innocent youths snatched suddenly
From amidst their host by flying Devils and carried to Hell
While Uzza, one of Four guardians of Egypt and angels pay no heed to this rape

The Aeons go past and the plagues get unleashed
The city of good is under siege

Black Moses is my name
And these are the visions
From Egypt's guardian seraph...

The heaven is on fire and Salomon's magic nets give no protection
St. Peter's shot and jesus with his brothers are slaughtered with no mercy
Their blood into dust without meaning of rebirth

And I see the gates to god tumbling down
And him being dragged before Abaddon's gold throne
Where the Grand Whore Barbelo's daughter wields a double-edged axe

And I see the blade fall down upon the head of lord in heaven
And Darkness falls upon the end of history
While I drink the milk of the Black Goddess and cry over the mankind

Black Moses is my name...
