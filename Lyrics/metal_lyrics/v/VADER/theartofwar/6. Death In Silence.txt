[Lyrics: Piotr Wiwczarek]

So many faces
In crimson light
Piercing sight
Take 'em off me!!!

All friends are coming
And gather 'round me
Frozen city in boiling flesh
Recollections in my head

My heart beating
Still louder
Oh - madness take my soul!!!

The walls are coming closer
Strangulating fear
My mind imprisoned
And screaming for the end

The silence is killing me...
The silence is burying me...

Freezing silence
Freezing silence
