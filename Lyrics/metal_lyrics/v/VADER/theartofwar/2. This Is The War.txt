[Lyrics: Piotr Wiwczarek]

Call the god of Mars!!!
Wake up your hate and fury
I am raising flag of death
With the sign of victory

We have to say "enough"
To the liar on the cross
So scream with me aloud!!!

This is the war
That you were asking for!!!

This is the war
Total war!!!

War for freedom
War for pride
War for future
For all of us
War for life
And worthy death
For you and me
This is the war!!!

[Lead: Mauser / Peter]

Call the god of hell!!!
Release all fire demons
Show you fists and teeth
And join the troops of death!!!

We have to say "enough"
To the scared behind the mask
So scream with me again!!!

This is the war
Total bloody war
War!!
