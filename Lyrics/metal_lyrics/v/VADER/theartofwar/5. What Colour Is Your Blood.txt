[Lyrics: Piotr Wiwczarek]

Warlust!!!
Screaming out all pain
Mercy died
It's gone forever

Fear is not my ally
Total attack!!!
I am conqueror I spill blood

Hell's child
Is the name you know
And I always raise my sword
Against the liars

In fury
Now I'm asking you-
What colour is your blood?

You love to take
Like parasite of life
Now I will take you down
To the land of endless cry...

Feel the touch of grace
Your last emotions
Welcome at the gates to hell!!!

I hear the pulse in your veins
The eyes are growing bigger
When you smell the steal of blade

Like razors cut
I open your heart
Crimson fluid is dancing
And life is running out

[Lead: Peter]

Hell's child is the name you know
And I always raise my sword
Against the liars

In fury
Now I'm asking you-
What colour is your blood?
What colour is your blood?
What colour is your blood?
