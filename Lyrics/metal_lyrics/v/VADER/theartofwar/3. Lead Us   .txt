[Lyrics: Piotr Wiwczarek]

Oh - ancient ones, the fearless gods
I wake you up tonight
To rule the earth again
Give us
All your mighty force
We'll follow path of death
In the shadow of your horns
Lead us!!!
Oh mighty lords!!!

[Lead: Peter / Mauser]

Oh - ancient ones, the powers from the past
I'm calling you tonight
To release now
Your rage and sorrow
We'll follow path of war
In the shadow of your horns
Lead us!!!
