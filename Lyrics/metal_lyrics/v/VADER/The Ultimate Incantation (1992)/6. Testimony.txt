Dark shadows at the end of the night,
Mesmerized by the silvery eye,
Gray stone with the carved seals,
I've found the forbidden gates!
The wolves carry my name,
Subtle voice is summoning me from afar,
Listen to my words,
This is my testimony.
Creatures dreaming in the dark,
Remember the time before the time,
They're still waiting at the gates,
Find the wisdom in the starlight!
I have found the key,
I have seen the lands which no map has ever charted,
I have traveled among the stars,
And tremble before the gods,
I have raised the dead,
And summoned the ghosts to the real appearance,
I've known the wisdom and possessed the power!
Conquer your fear - IA! ZI AZAG!
Chant incantation - IA! ZI AZKAK!
Call the ancient ones - IA! KHTULU ZI KUR!
Ready to rule the black earth once again - IA!
