Time to play - get out of your head,
Time to die - my cruelty will make you dead,
Show your fear, don't escape into madness,
Your rotting gutted body,
Shall vanish in the maze of Death.
An ablazing usurper's dream,
Blasphemy to idols made in stone,
Throne of might and its unseen Lord,
Stars waned by the fright of Him.
Shining jewels in his crown,
Like drops of my sacrificial blood,
Ceremony of the abhorrent deaths,
Words too insane to tell.
Chaos........
The pentagramic rule,
Of the frigid existence,
Disdainful temptation,
Of an absurd resistance.
Mindless decaying eyes of the dead,
Observe the world with fear,
Staring at the crown of limitless domination.
Dementias, perverse lust and will,
To see my Master as triumphant,
Extreme of my coldful force,
To bring His enemies down on their knees.
Cruel, irresponsible wisdom,
Purity of duration in fear,
Chaotic experiences of my mind,
Becoming now to be distinct.
Chaos........
