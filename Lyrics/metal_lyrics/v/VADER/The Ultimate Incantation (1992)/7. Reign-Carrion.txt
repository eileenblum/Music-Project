[CD only]
Eternal lust created by the ancient gods
Waked up me once again
My stinkin' corpse abandoned the crypts
I waited for this night in

I'm doomed to transmigration of souls
My sufferin' remains and increases
I can't live and die at rest
My life in death is my fate

Terrible curse that blinds my eyes
Fetters of death make me a slave of my cry

Reincarnation through the ages
Made me a God for the mortals
I bear the cross for next sacrifice
To break out of the curse

The endless hunger of human life
And bloody lust to kill
Eternal hate of light and day
Made me a Prince of Night

Terrible curse that blinds my eyes
Fetters of death make me a slave of my cry
I'll be back
You will die
Mortal visions in your head create your fear and haunt your mind
Secret fluids from the past break into brain - you're insane
My damned life is reborn in your flesh
I am your soul
Now you are me

Secular powers of immensity
Freeze your eyes and purify your blood
Breath of the ages destroys your will
Opened gates of time absorb your life

In your veins now floods grubby rot
You're deathlike carrion infected with me

Lust and pain
You feel that in your spoilt flesh
Death has broken into your mind
But you're alive

In your veins now floods grubby rot
Your life depends entirely on me

I remember Adam and Eve and time of deluge
I has seen the burning of Sodom and fall of Rome
I was Jesus Christ and man consecrated my name
My unholy ghost is damnation of the livin' Hell
