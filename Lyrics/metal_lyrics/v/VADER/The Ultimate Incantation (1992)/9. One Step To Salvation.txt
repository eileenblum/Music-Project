I'm starting the test,
Your unbelief,
Conquering emperor,
Woke up your brain,
Restless thoughts,
Still consuming your mind,
You help my magic,
With your own horrible frights.
Words of wreck,
Rest in your head,
Triumpher of you,
The self cremation.
Death - the door, you near with every day to,
The way shall save your soul.
Close the past of life,
Cross the still of fear! You shall be free.
Anxious eyes,
Opened in fear,
Pulsation of blood,
Inside the bowels,
Something cold,
Touching twisted veins,
Never ending bloody stream....
Scarlet waves carry you away,
Across the Styx into resting place,
Hear my voice, my words of your destiny,
Nick your shell and fly towards me!
Rest - under my wings,
Look - at my face,
Come - in my arms,
Give me your life - set free your lunatic soul,
Frosty edge,
Penetrate again,
Cuts in rage,
You choose the only way,
Approach my son,
Give me your hand,
Forget yourself,
Leave all behind! You're mine!
