Black cities hidden in the dark,
Among the waters, beneath the seas,
Horrible thoughts destroy the minds,
Through the endless nights.
You don't know what's to come,
While I'm chanting incantations,
Stay away and don't play with This,
You'll never understand.
Buried in the frozen seas,
Tombs of forgotten Gods,
Who came forth from blackened stars,
A breath of centuries here.
A different, inconceivable cult,
Shreds of the eternal, endless Circle,
Gates to Hell for chosen ones,
Awake from morality.
You don't know what's to come,
While I'm chanting incantations,
Stay away and don't play with This,
You'll never understand,
And you never understood.
This is not death - which can eternal lie,
But with the strange eons - even Death may die,
Words written long ago - in sacred book of Might,
The lethal, omnious powers - eclipsing all the light.
The breaking, unseen ice - a deadly fates anger,
Nightmarish ghosts - spectra and souls,
The burning fire brands - in every open mind,
And eyes shattered - of timid fools.
Madness is a strange blessing,
If you understand nothing,
That's better to be dead,
When the gods soon descend.
Awaiting in horrific peace,
The Master of All is dozing,
His time hasn't yet come,
His hour remains unknown.
You don't know what's to come,
While I'm chanting incantations,
Stay away and don't play with This,
You'll never understand,
Never.
