[Lyrics re/de-construction: Pavel Frelik, Music: Peter Wiwczarek]

[It is a loose interpretation/re-working of "Preliminary Invocation" from Solomon's "Goetia"]
[which was compiled and translated by S. L. Mathers. For personal use only.]

Thee I invoke, the Bornless one - hear my call
Thee, that didst create the Earth and the Heavens
Thee, that didst create the Night and the Day
Thee, that didst create the Darkness and the Light

This is the Lord of the Gods
This is the Lord of the Universe

Thee I invoke, the Terrible and Invisible God
Who dwellest in the Void Place of the Spirit.
Thee I invoke, the Begetter and Manifester unto the Light
Whose mouth ever flameth and spiteth - hear me call

This is the Lord of the Gods
This is the Lord of the Universe
This is He Whom the Winds fear
Lord of my Call

Hear My Call
Make all Daemons and Sprits subject unto Me
Of the Firmament and of the Ether
Upon the Earth and under the Earth
On dry Land and in the Water
Of Whirling Air and the rushing Fire
Make every Spell and Scourge of god obedient unto Me
