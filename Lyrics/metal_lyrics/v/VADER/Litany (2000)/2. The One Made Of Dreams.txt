[Lyrics: Pavel Frelik, Music Peter Wiwczarek]

Sometimes believing in some disembodied being can help find the way in the
world.
A being that constitutes an essence of what you profess and follow.
A being that exist only in your dreams and never falls prey to sestemic
arrangments of religions and philosophies.

I am the Left Hand of Darkness
I am the Right Hand of Light
I am the Lurker of the Twilight
I am the Mist of the Dawn

As you are dreaming me up
I'm bringing freedom into your mind

I am the Sadness of the Gods
I am the Radiance from the Sky
I am the Desert of the Real
I am the Knowledge and the Maze

I am the Lizard without the King
I am Fall without the Leap
I am the Power without the Might
I am the Wanderer without the Road

Protect your daemon, I said
Before the magic lamb shatters
Protect your deities, I said
Before I come to bring them down
