[Lyrics: Pavel Frelik, Music: Peter Wiwczarek]

There have never been gods and devils,
but there were people who were turned
into them by others and trapped in divine incarnations.

No act of spawning was my birth
There is no darkness after my dawn
I don't commander chthonian gods
That call for hatred, tears and pain

I just don't know why I have a pair of wings

You come to me and ask for help
You urge me to unleash my wrath
You cry and yell and bag and pray
You chant some words I don't understand

Is it 'cause I have a pair of wings?

The rites are drawn to celebrate
The fall that never happened
Over and over you kill the same god
Whose name I don't even know

Would you do the same
If I shed my pair of wings?
