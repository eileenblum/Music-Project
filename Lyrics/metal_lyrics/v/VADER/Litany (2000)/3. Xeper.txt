[Lyrics: Pavel Frelik, Music: Peter Wiwczarek]

A scarab beetle which toils through its phases
From an egg through a larva to the protector of the dawning Sun
Out of the Unmanifest into the Matrix of Manifestation
One word which opens the gates to the worlds

Knowledge-not information-grants transformative power
There are as many left hand paths as there are us-stars
The extension of existence to a further level of Being
By powers of the Set that releases from thrall

I have come into being
I have come into being

Meaning can only come from the individual
In the moments of divine clairvoyance and intensification of Being
The utterance of the word which ripples through the fabric of the world
And gives insight and strength to those who want to become

I have come into being
I have come into being

A scarab beetle which toils through its phases
From an egg through a larva to the protector of the dawning Sun
Out of the Unmanifest into the Matrix of Manifestation
One word which opens the gates to realities

I have come into being
