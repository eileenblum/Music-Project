[Lyrics: Harry Maat; Music: Piotr Wiwczarek]

Walking the paths of everdark,
Searching all of what lies within,
Betrayal by those so blind
Living lives in the grey flock, truth they will never find.

[Lead: Peter / Mauser]

Spit out as they fallow so much selfish ways,
Full of hate and in the end...yeah!

As a Victor watch' them all,
Fakes are elimintated,
What I deserve will they deserve

Untill the end is coming near

[Lead: Mauser / Peter]

Walking the paths of ever dark,
Searching all of what lies within
(Is all life of this suffering?)
Betrayal by those so blind
Living lives in the grey flock... truth they will never find.

Arise! my soul from mortal flesh, into the spirit realms,
All pain a source of Power,
Still alone when blood is drained..

[Lead: Mauser / Peter]

When time has ended, replaced by afterlife...
Who have I become ?
I still walk the Realms, as a master of the ShadowFear,
Into all infinity!
