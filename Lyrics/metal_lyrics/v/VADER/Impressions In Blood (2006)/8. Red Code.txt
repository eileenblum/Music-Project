[Lyrics: Pawel Frelik; Music: Piotr Wiwczarek]

Zeroes and ones are like cells
Slowly accreting in the veins
Of the great system of the world
The globe, the matrix and the brain

Red is the code
The code is red

Vitruvian cyborg with bloodshot eyes
Arterial download of the soul
The new Creature is pumped with life
Of Xaos knowledge from all of us

Messages pulsing in the temples
I smell the color in the air
And raise my eyes to swallow at least some red data
Raining from the sky

[Lead: Mauser]

Digital prophets slash their wrists
To show their converts who believe
In gushes of the waves to surf
The gospel of the red kingdom come

Red is the code
The code is red
RED
