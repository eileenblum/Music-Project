[Lyrics: Harry Maat; Music: Piotr Wiwczarek]

Vast sights, stakes piercing Mother Earth,
In the kingdom of "Sin" they lived,
Now shunned away, staked...and left,
As they fought the battles of the psyche,
Like so many years ago,
They now feed lions to the Christians,
For what purpose? One might ask...

The Purification of the soul?
And everlasting life, so Heavenly?
They cannot see, what lies beneath,
Right or left, eyes shut...open wide,
As they walk the path they most despise,
Killing, rejecting,

They now feed lions to the Christians
For what purpose? One might ask...

In a crusade against individuality,
Who can decide, what is right?

Weather to despise the sun or moon... or neither,
As both have massive powers, untamed,
But still I walk the vast planes,
And all my eyes see...

And all my eyes see...
Are the fields of the Heads, Staked...

They now feed lions to the Christians,
For what purpose? One might ask...
