[Lyrics: Harry Maat; Music: Maurycy Stefanowicz]

I stand strong and fierce
I am so mighty... I am so dark
Overlooking the battlefields below
I see my Brothers, their courage and strenght
Looking in the eyes of the Enemy Leader
The one who Lead the light

As legions march, across the withered earth
Trembling on broken human bones
All weapons drawn and sharp
My warriors, my proud of the dungeons black

Onwards to engage the Light!!! The Enemy!!!
Onwards to engage the light!!!

[Lead: Mauser / Peter]

See their skins glow, disgusting aura's
The white winged soldiers, - ooh how I hate them !!!
First blood is shed, immortal turn to mortal
My Warriors in flames
Feeding on the suffer

Onwards to engage the light!!! The Enemy!!!
Onwards to engage the light!!!

Spreadin' my draconian wings, I provoke...
I know, that victory is close
Shattered bodies lie on the ground, the smell of death is all around...
