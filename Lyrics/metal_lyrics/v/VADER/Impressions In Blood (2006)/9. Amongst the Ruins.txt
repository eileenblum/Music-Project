[Lyrics: Harry Maat; Music: Maurycy Stefanowicz]

Can you see me... at the horizon
Amongst the Ruins I kneel
See the gap in my chest, coloured deep red
My bleeding heart in front of me

Aching cries that ever last
Amongst the Ruins I kneel
A shattered soul with endless why's
Forced to shed skin yet another time

I see my silhouette... at the wall
Watching me... whispering pain
He sees my inner depts and moans softly
As He is I...

The end will come... there is nothing I can do
Dwelling through the ashes
Where life and emotions seem to distant
This source of life slipped through my fingers

See me kneel Amongst the Ruins
Of what once was my Angel City
I shamefully kneel and weep
With my head bowed down...

[Lead: Mauser]

Where echos'of past, present and future
Dwell through these ancient and savage walls
Of joy, grief... the suffer

...and the soul search

Can you see me... at the horizon
Amongst the Ruins I kneel
See the gap in my chest, coloured deep red
My bleeding heart in front of me

Aching cries that ever last
Amongst the Ruins I kneel

I shamefully kneel and weep
With my head bowed down...
