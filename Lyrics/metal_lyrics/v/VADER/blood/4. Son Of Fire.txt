[Music &amp; Lyric: Piotr Wiwczarek]

Burning dreams
A fever in my soul
Destructive force
And world incinerated

Son of Fire
Grand Lord of all demonic beings
Son of Fire
Burst the flame inside me!!!

Ashes to ashes
And dust to the dust
Humans executed
Melted bodies all around

[lead: Peter]

Son of Fire (...)

Flames rise around
Burn my flesh
Lick my soul and touch my mind
