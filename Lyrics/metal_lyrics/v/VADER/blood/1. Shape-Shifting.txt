[Music: Piotr Wiwczarek, Lyric: Pawel Frelik]

Inexorable conversion
Accelerated change
Prosthesis made of light
For new modular religion

Newly minted nightmares
In luminous code
Machina ex machina
Infocalypse now

The categories crack and strain
The borders bleed and break
The mind ignites and burns
Shape-shifting

The time of quickening
Undivine invasions
The liquid architecture
The stony blood

Implantation of the soul
Pornography of the mind
Anomaly breeding
All lifeworlds gush

Furious glossolalia
Unholy heterosia

Festive impurity
Orgy of mutation
Demonic simulacrum
Fluidity of the "I"

The categories crack and strain
The borders bleed and break
Treason of the Godhead
Nan shall defy
