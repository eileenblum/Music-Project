["...and the Elder Lords set Their seal upon the Gateway and the power of the Old Ones prevailst not against its might." - Liber Logaeth (translated by Dr John Dee)]

Creature, that howling in darkness
From deepest parts of earth
Winged monster
Tearing apart my soul
You know it came for me
No prayer can save my soul and flesh
I feel the Unholy
The Gate Outside are opened

Now I'm gone and dead
The one beyond redemption

The Passenger
The ancient Traveler

No Enki, nor Marduk
In the light of Jupiter
No muzzle can save me
From Alla Xul

Down to the underworld
Amongst venomous vitriol

lead: Mauser

Hideous bulks
Torture my soul
Why I have become a part of this?
