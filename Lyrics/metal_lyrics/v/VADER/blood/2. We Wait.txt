[Music: Piotr Wiwczarek, Lyric: Pawel Frelik]

We wait in hiding, we lie in wait
We secretly draw great plans
Of spaceless kingdom of the soul
Of triumph of the will

We wait in hiding, we lie in wait
We slowly change our blood
For the arrival of the eon
Of the new mind and love

The absence of war does not mean peace
The absence of noise does not mean silence
We whisper, we plot, we wait...

We wait in hiding, we lie in wait
We carry light occulted
Each for themselves and never all
The solitary work

We wait in hiding, we lie in wait
We are so many yet so few
The work is started and never done
Yet there's no yearning for the calm

We are carving
Out of light

The airless structures of agape
For starts that never touch

We wait in hiding, we lie in wait
We patiently seek the day
When all our wishes are come true
When the new order has arrived
