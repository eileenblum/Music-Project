[Music &amp; Lyric: Piotr Wiwczarek]

[lead: Peter]

Silence in the Dark
Ripped by mighty yell apart
Strange smell increases in the air
Hate radiates from nonetity

Now all is coming true
What was written million years before
The Gods were born in the Abyss
Their time is coming now again

[lead: Peter]

Once Rulers of all Things
Betrayed by those, who came from Their own blood
Then Thrown into the Graves
Revenge was growing... like Fire
Weak is not worth to be
The last hours glow in dusk
No time to pray...
As the Fallen rise again

The time is coming now again...
No time to pray - as the Fallen rise again
