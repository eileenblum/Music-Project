from world power to servant state
from self-sufficient to tied and raped
civilizations clashed one god prevailed
occupied by those your fathers hate

media provoking sight and sound
setting the stage as your haventown
internalized out-group hatreds swell
festering unsaid tribal quell

they wear greenish golden armor, you bear skin
theocracy aborts free life, wasting kin
mercenaries eject icy steel, last rites burn
dehumanized forms in bondage, its your turn

emblems of your scorn- what will you do now?
all wear the same face- what will you do now?
all share the same thoughts- what will you do now?

breach, equate
erupt, separate
rip, mutilate
breach, equate
