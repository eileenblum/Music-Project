emanation, outflow, overwhelming fuel
unperceived instrument grounding daily duel
stimuli of passions correspond to bleak,
antiquated features of prehistory
in present isolation from this distant state,
ardor serves as proof of violent masquerade
aside from random adaptations for like goal,
actual interaction strategies unfold

traces of untamed deeds felt
though our primate ancestors compelled

blood spent for blood
now inactive agony

resonation
vague remnants of desperate feats
cerebral bondage

vein - in colossal culture complex
strain - gene flow in drifting phase

emission of gray pressure
through abstract expression
evolutionary environment 
cognitive homeland, tormenting descent
