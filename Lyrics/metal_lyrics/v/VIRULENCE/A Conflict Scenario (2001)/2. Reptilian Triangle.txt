waves of strength and angry rapture surge in scenarios
where harm or gain to reproduction grows
fight or flight response triggered by rules
by objects sculpted by death's own tools

like a cool blanket of cortical mass
checking burning primal coals
followed by fabled hope of depraved struggle's tolls

my objective faculty steers me for
an odd intrusive experiment of self-deplore

mental scenario - mirrors alpha glow
extroverted leaps - signal energies
carnivore caressed - prehensile limb expressed

emergency pathway
triune split
mid-region mediation,
upper override quit

flat skull caps indicative of agonistic schemes
seeking violent conflict through self-promoting genes

social primates, human children
organize in hierarchies
facial intimidations
hint emotional anarchy

these are remnants of chaos 
rank diagnoses serve as keys
to peoples once living within
reptilian societies 

tiny fists clenched,
tugging fearlessly
orange hair and scalp dangling freely

wake with wasted fuel from ideal scenes
scramble for seat in social Colosseum
