Fire in the Sky - The Earth is crisp and dry
Roaring, the thunder - The Universe is crying
You are the verse that ends up in tears - It's written on your skin
Iniuria and demonkind - You will burn in Hell!

We are born of ruthless mother - We will rule the Earth
Covenant lies, We discover - To the End
Fault is in the lies - The End is bliss and fine
Conflagration - The Earth is calling in despair

Come to Me and see the End - Ruling by His side
I slaughtered Angels and ate Their eyes
So I may see the End of Time
Uriel - Devour, My Soul again

Come with Me and see My brothers - We'll Burn in Hell
For seven Angels and seven Demons - Laughed at my despair
And high and mighty was your God - He Burnt (died) with Me
For all the names we dare to utter - We will Burn... We will Burn... We will Burn!

These shall be the last words
They shall be written in blood
These are the last words
They shall be sung with shame
