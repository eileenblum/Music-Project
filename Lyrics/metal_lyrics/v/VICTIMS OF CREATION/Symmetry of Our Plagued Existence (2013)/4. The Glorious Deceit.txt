Where do We go from here? A failing tragedy? A satire of Life?
An Angel came to Me, He said to follow Him at the End of Time
Away, from all that's left - An endless journey to the End of Light

Is it the End of all suffering?
The End of lies, Death in the air I breathe

The start of a new Life? With the knowledge now complete
The need, to answer all the questions in now fulfilled
The light, is burning Me

Reach out and breathe
This glorious disease... of Life
Adore Me
I command you to breathe

"You are cursed with a Divine Soul, to serve Us for Eternity"

In the End, the 'Soul' remains
We are the servants of 'Holiness'
I hear the Angels calling out to Me
But I am trapped here in Eternity

Reach out and breathe
This Glorious Deceit
Scream out to Me
"I'll serve Thee for Eternity"
