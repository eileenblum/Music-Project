It's coming, the Universe Ends
We are those left behind
Succumb, to loneliness
Like the Void that surrounds Us

Obscure contentment
From the essence of inexistence
Nihilistic perspective reigning supreme

There are no Voices left
To cry for Us
Relinquish all hope
Like the fading Gods before Us

Useless Souls
Are there no Gods to die for?
Freed from flesh
Procreation no longer binds Us

You're nothing
Can't satiate
Our hunger - Consumes Us

So foolish
Have Faith?
We're coming - To free You

"What have I done?"
Cried the Lord of Darkness
"What have I done?"
Wept the blind Bringer of Light

As the Two become One
Perfection, null is achieved
Left to watch
Are Those left behind

Blasphemer!
Blasphemer!
Blasphemer!
Blasphemer!

From Heaven We shall smile
You'll rot and Burn

And watch Your own demise
As We tear Your flesh apart

His Love will find a way
He's gone... We're here

Why won't you let me...
Die Die Die Die

Blasphemer!
Blasphemer!

It's coming, the Universe Ends
We are Those left behind
Succumb to loneliness
Away!!!
