Carve deep into My flesh, Thy Name
And let the Sun, deteriorate away
Now as I lay into the darkness
We crawl into the womb of the Earth

As We're reborn We reach the Sky
Come and discover the pain
Now as I lay into the darkness
I learn the Art of Despair

Into the shadows I cry to live once again
Into the shadows I die to live once again

Silent, the Guardian that signs
The poisoned cup to the End
Now as I lay into the darkness
I am the Art of Despair

Come with Me My Love
Into the Seas... To embrace...
We were born to serve...
Come to me... My Love...
Why won't you come to Me?
My Love...
