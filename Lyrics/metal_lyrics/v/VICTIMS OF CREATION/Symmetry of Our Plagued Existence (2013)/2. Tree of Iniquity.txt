We call this Earth, of Immortality - To bring (forth)
Sins of Mankind, We exonerate - My Love
The Earth is cold, come, consume Me - My Life
To Me the end is coming so near - Endure Me

I shall not cower to Iniquity
You will not doubt my immortality - My Love
I shall show you the things that are, so unreal - My Love
The joys of capere

I am your God - Kneel to Me
I am the Scythe - Die for Me
We are all One - Believe in Me
Can't you hear Us cry - Summon Me

I am your God - Kneel to Me
I am the Scythe - Kill for Me
We rule as One - Unity
Can't you hear Us cry - Summon Me

No wrong for you to lie beside, My Love
Seeking the sky We empower
No longer need to lie beside, scientia
I am the seed that shall infect, again...

Through the ashes of Mankind, I shall be reborn
The Tree is not the End!
