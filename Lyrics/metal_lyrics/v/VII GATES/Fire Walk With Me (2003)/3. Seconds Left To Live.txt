They woke me up in the middle of the night
And threw me out on the street
Accused for killing a man of the law
But I swear it wasnât me
Punches hits my face
As Iâm flying against the wall
Angry voices everywhere
This must be a dream

I got only seconds left to live
And soon I will die
Why, God, oh why?
I got only seconds left to live
And soon I will die
Thereâs not time to cry

Ready - Aim - Fire

With blood on my hands and blood in my face
I prayed for my life
But there was only madness and hate
In my slayerâs eyes
Sank down, down on my knees
With my hands pointing to the sky
Praying to someone who must
Have closed the eyes

I got only seconds left to live
And soon I will die
Why, God, oh why?
I got only seconds left to live
And soon I will die
Thereâs not time to cry

Ready - Aim - Fire
