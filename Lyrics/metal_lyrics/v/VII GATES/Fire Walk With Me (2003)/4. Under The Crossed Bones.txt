Caught as a thief
And sold as a slave
Nearly his life was to end
But his knowledge helped him
To be sold to the right woman

The governorâs nightmare
Queen of the sea
Wanted dead or alive
An oath by blood
The will search for the rich and pride

Kill or die, thatâs the law of the sea
No one will step aside
Take not give, this life is hard and mean
Only cowards will try to hide

Under the crossed bones lies
What greedy men dying for
Under the crossed bones lies
Sixty-seven feet above the shore
Under the crossed bones lies
A symbol of their crimes
Under the crossed bones lies
Just try to interpret the rimes

The scalp of her father
And a piece of his ship
The third part in her enemyâs hand
Together theyâll show
The way to the Promised Land

Ride like the storm across
The ocean in the south
A hunt between those three and death and time
Who will reach first
Reach the shore of the golden sand

Betray and lie, donât trust what you see
It can also be a lie
Raise thy sword, weâre close to the end
And some of us must die

Under the crossed bones lies
What greedy men dying for
Under the crossed bones lies
Sixty-seven feet above the shore
Under the crossed bones lies
A symbol of their crimes
Under the crossed bones lies
Just try to interpret the rimes
