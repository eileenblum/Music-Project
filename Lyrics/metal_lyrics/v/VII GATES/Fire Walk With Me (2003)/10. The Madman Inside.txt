You thought you had left me
Far behind
But I am so close, I can ever get
Without touch your skin
Like a fly on the wall
Iâm watching you

The breathings in the phone
You never hear a word
The scratching on your window
The shade beside your way
Thatâs the little man inside me
And I just obey

My senses tell me to
Just leave it
But the little man urge me on and on
Closer, closer
She is just confused
And she donât know whatâs her best

Why are you screaming?
You know, I will always love you
I will never hurt you, no
I scare you, you say
But please believe itâs not me
Itâs the little man inside my head

Madman, Madman, Madman, Madman
Thereâs a madman inside me
Thereâs a madman inside
You have to set him free
Thereâs a madman inside
A madman inside me
He wonât let me be
