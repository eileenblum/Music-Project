Who threw the first stone?
Doesnât matter now
All glass is already broken
And it wounds your feet
When you just walking around
Violence led to violence
Feeding hate with blood
Every drop will be paid
Endurance shall prevail

Forget all inner conflicts
âCause we have an enemy outside

Weâre bounded by hate

So many times so close to an end
Standing with the shards of glass
And shouting
Victory will be in our hands
They want to call us criminals
But who is the one to judge?
Is it the strong manâs right to justify?
Even the most extensive crime

Weâre bounded by hate

Who will dare to fight? To fight for a lie?
And doesnât care at all who comes with you?
The circle must be broken
Who will dare to die? To die for a lie?
And doesnât care at all who comes with you?
The circle must be broken

Weâre bounded by hate
