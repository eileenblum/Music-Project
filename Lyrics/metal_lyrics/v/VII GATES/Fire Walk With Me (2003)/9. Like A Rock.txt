Itâs been a while since I lost my mind
Now Iâm fighting with no hope
Itâs been too tough for a guy like me
This will be by last shoot

I will give it all, I will keep hanging in
I wonât let this dream fall apart
Iâve been through times of trouble before
Nothing have stopped me then

Now when Iâve reached my destination
Nothing seems to have changed

Like a rock nothing could break
Like a shot nothing could raise me
But in the end life is just the same

I know Iâm cold, I know Iâm mean
Some people think that I am insane
A little bit of hope and I will never give up
For this dream Iâm hard as a rock

Now when Iâve reached my destination
Nothing seems to have changed

Like a rock nothing could break
Like a shot nothing could raise me
But in the end life is just the same
