Long he hided in the wasteland
Waiting for his time
Still a king with no land
Waiting for the sign

The dark shadow has grown
Their armies marching
I will complete my call
The light shall never fail

Heâs the saviour

Through many fierce trials
With supreme bold
Walked through the valley of death
As the prophecies had told

The dark shadow has grown
Their armies marching
I will complete my call
The light shall never fall

Heâs the saviour
