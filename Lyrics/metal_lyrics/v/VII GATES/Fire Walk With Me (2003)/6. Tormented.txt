Chased and abused
Threatened and used
Timmy was so tired
Tired of always running away

A torment to those around him
They always said
He was never good
All he ever understood

The schoolyard was his prison
No place to hide
Pushed up to a locker
Accompanied by taunts

Everybody on
Everybody beat
Everybody kick
âtill that little boy bleed
Everybody on
Everybody beat
Everybody kick
âtill that tiny boy scream
Just scream, none will help you now

On a shelf he found daddyâs gun
Said to himself âI gotta have some funâ
Before I end all pain that burns inside me
The content when their smile just froze
And just to know, once he wonât lose
He grinned, âI will torment youâ
We just have to get even

He screamed as he fired
Danced through the rain
The raindrops washed his knifeâ¦
He screamed as he fired
âI will never feel more painâ
And to you my dear tormentors
I see you all in hell

Everybody on
Everybody beat
Everybody kick
âtill that little boy bleed
Everybody on
Everybody beat
Everybody kick
âtill that tiny boy scream
Just scream, none will help you now
