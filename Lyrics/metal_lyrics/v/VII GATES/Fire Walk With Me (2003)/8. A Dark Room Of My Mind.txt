Hate! All inside of me
All I remember
All I felt

Mummy didnât love me
Neither my daddy
All for my sister
But now she is dead

From a dark room of my mind
Taking over from all inside
Glowing eyes and I canât deny I feel
Satisfaction

I am bleeding deep inside
Now the vengeance is mine - only mine

Now! Feel my vengeance
Feel my anger
Feel my hate

Read my last letter
Try to understand
This bloodstained paper
I left for you

From a dark room of my mind
Taking over from all inside
Glowing eyes and I canât deny I feel
Satisfaction

I am bleeding deep inside
Now the vengeance is mine - only mine
