Iâm lying awake, alone with my thoughts
The digital numbers staring at me
From the clock radio, sleep is what I ought

But itâs creeping in my body, uncertainty
And I know, something is wrong
Anxiety tears me apart, what could it be?

I wish I could turn back to time
And stay where you were mine
All misunderstandings far away
All just fineâ¦

What Iâd give to touch your hand
See your smile, hold you near
I would pay whatever to make things right
But now youâre so far away

I would climb to moon
Touch sun, but I am such a fool
To let you be this far away
Far away, youâre too far away

I can still remember
How you walked out through the door
Never touch, never feel
I will never hold you close, close to me, anymore

Memories is what is left, thin, withered and pale
Never talk, never see
Makes it easier to forget, forget for me

I can see how my dreams
I can see how my visions
Come undone
And turn to rotting pieces, falling down

Falling down like pouring rain
But it wonât wash away my pain
I will drown, like in a flood
But even then, I wonât give up

I wish I could turn back to time
And stay where you were mine
All misunderstandings far away
All just fineâ¦

What Iâd give to touch your hand
See your smile, hold you near
I would pay whatever to make things right
But now youâre so far away

I would climb to moon
Touch sun, but I am such a fool
To let you be this far away
Far away, youâre too far away
