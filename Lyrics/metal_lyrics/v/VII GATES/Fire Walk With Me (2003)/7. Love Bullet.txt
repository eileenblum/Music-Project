Iâve been watching you
Iâve been touching you
For a long time now

Youâre always in my mind
Youâre always in my sight
I just wanna hold you

My eyes is my crosshair
And my hands is my guns

Just like a bullet in speed of light
Straight through your heart when Iâm passing by
Just like a bullet in speed of light
Straight through your heart when Iâm passing by
Then you will be mine
Love bullet

When Iâm in your blood
When Iâm in your mind
Then I can control you

I can make you scream
And I can make you cry
But I just want you to love me

My eyes is my crosshair
And my hands is my guns

Just like a bullet in speed of light
Straight through your heart when Iâm passing by
Just like a bullet in speed of light
Straight through your heart when Iâm passing by
Then you will be mine
Love bullet
