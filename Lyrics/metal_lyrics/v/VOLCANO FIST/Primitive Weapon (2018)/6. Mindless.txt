I sold my soul to be like you and I lost everything
Now I'm sitting on the ashes of empty memories
I did this for you
And from this I, I gained nothing
I'm walking away
I have half a mind to turn around and walk away

Aimed at nothing
Just nihil in my wake
Mindless envy
(This is our escape!)

Because of you
I lost myself
Because of you
I lost it all
I won't forgive the wretched throne
That you reign
