It's been millions of years
But we all, we all still feel the same
Primal rage

Shut your mouth
(And get on the floor!)
Start living life
(Through the eyes of a dinosaur!)

Primal rage!

It's all we have to keep
Living
Breathing
Running
Feeding

Just counting days
As the past creeps up
But the future dies away

A burning engine
Placing wagers on the game of life
Don't sell it short
'Cause your extinction could be tonight

Watch the serpent stir
You stand on top of a broken earth
There will be no dawn
No dawn for man

I've seen the forest
I've seen the forest through the trees
Just to find myself unfit to speak
(Unfit to speak)

Broadcast the errors of the past
You'll eat your tail in the bottomless glass

Time
At last
The last grain meets the mass
Bottomless

One by one
Come pay your debt to a dying sun
Blood and gold
Don't hold your breath

Running off the rails
Tsunami tide inside the eyes

Show me a deathless dream without a fucking king
Show me an hour
Show me a week

Rip the tile from the hall
Burn the doctrines in the streets
Anchors away

Break
Through the endless storm
Crush pillars of the primal fucking war

What's dead is dead
The future resting on your shoulders

Bring an end
To the spineless cowards
Spitting their rhetoric
Crafting wastelands
Veracity is bought and sold

Break
Through the endless war
Crush pillars of the primal fucking storm!

What's dead is dead
The future resting on your shoulders

Trace the key
To crush the spineless king
Show me an hour
Show me a week
Without the panic
Or hate that levels mountains
In the name of vacant prophets
A wasteland for the spineless
A world of primal rage
