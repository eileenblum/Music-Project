Severance swimming in the underbelly
Braving the shallows towards the
Erratic divide
Swells brazen reputation
Is it divine

If it's dead leave it dead
Just a shadow of a being designed in vacant prospect
And from eye to eye I can see the fruitless revelations thrive
Contend to revive
Or crush
To the bitter last filthy bone

(Can you lasso the undertow?)

Cash your best bet into obliteration
Indefinite horror of the sheer arbitration

Quaking
Shattered
Violent

What a fucking

Writhing
Endless storm
Into the future
