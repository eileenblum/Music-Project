Don't you get tired of pretending
Everyone knows no one's real
From day one you were putting on a show

Stare me in the eyes
Tell me that it's going to be OK
Acceptance is empty just like your lies
You stare at me and I finally fucking realize

You're a waste of my fucking time
But that's how the story goes
I swear the world is empty of anyone but me
Who do I go to when no one is there?
A wall full of heroes you've all let me down
