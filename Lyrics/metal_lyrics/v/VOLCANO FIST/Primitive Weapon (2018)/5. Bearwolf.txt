Bearing the weight, crushing through every last onslaught
Pure panic spewing through the gates

I am the face of the avalanche
I held the cards from the start
Your road to hell is a guarantee
My reign's beginning to dawn

Crown me the last monstrosity
Annihilates the code and spits into the face of God
Fire your canon
It's not worth coming back

But still I quake with the hunger of unfed wrath
Mining grief from the morale fit to fill an empty glass
Til I perish or wither away
To the empty, the barren, the void, the silence of space...

I am the bear
The wolf
The consummate supreme!

Razed and deconstructed
Dismantled, collapsed and frayed
Is this the price of moving forward
Knee deep in gluttony

What matters
What fucking matters
In the face of torture

Backwards cavas
Streams from the dark
Piling waste on order

Reformed animosity

Time dissolves, breaking away
One last chance to breathe my name

Bearwolf!
Bearwolf!

You better fucking move!

Senses flood with thunder
As it all comes crashing down

A sovereign mind
Intertwined with bleeding colors

Wash it away, reel it in
Over and over
