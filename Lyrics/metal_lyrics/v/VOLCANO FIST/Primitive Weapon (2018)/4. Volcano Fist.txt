Emerge
From the deepest corners
Liquid fury
Fracking a well of untapped force

Do the rivers that live here flow
Carving channels that merge in full
To the final eruption
Climb the tower and breathe in
Full force
Blacks out the sky as it rains to the ground

Crawl from the gallows
Reboot the feed
Climb up the tower
Blast off into space!

So brace the weight and take your place!

I breathe the atmosphere
Spreading over the outer coast
Pouring magma down your throat
'Til it rains to the ground

Racing into the fade
A sea of frozen graves

Been a long time comin' up, long time coming around

Coming home

Can you hear my thoughts
Through the back of my head
Transcending space and time
As we watch the laser scan

Ride the wave
Until the last crest breaks
Take a dive into the eye
Of the burning lake

Vacuumed into O
Obliterate
Obliteration

Strands replace the air with a sentient song
Turning the wheel downstream
Galactic attack! Manic!
Time to change your theme song

Straight ahead
The night ready to break
So round it up!

Straight ahead
Climb the tower
Turn the wheel
Reboot the feed
Take a dive
Fire away

Feast with me
Drink the echoes of a quiet empty street
It's not enough
It's never enough!

Not enough
Or way too much
To map

Cloning a system
Reclaimed and drowned
With my own hands

Drifting through the smoke
With just a fist
