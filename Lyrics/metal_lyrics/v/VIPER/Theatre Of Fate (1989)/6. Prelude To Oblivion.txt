Cruel reality
Wears away our will to live

All the world will look at me
And hold his breath too hear my speech
So when I leave this world unfair
They will cry for me and understand

I just can't find my way
Or meaning to my life

World will remember?
Not at all
And take my example?
Not at all
Am I wrong?

Yes! Because the world won't take example
From somebody who won't fight
For better days and hide away
Not facing problems in their life

To be alive is the best way
That we must show mankind
We want a better world for all

I ask all the world
To follow the song
