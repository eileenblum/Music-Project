God put a heart in the body of a man
Beating in chaos with no defense
Always begging mercy from the blue sky above
Hiding his sins but heaven knows.

I'm running with my
Bad dreams, good scenes
Loneliness and sadness
You left too deep your mark
No I've got you inside my heart.

Dance of madness
Shadows running in the night
Dance of madness
You and me dancing on the fire

God put a heart inside of me
And love is a knife that makes us bleed
So let's bleed together at the "Suicide Bar"
Let's spread colors no matter how far.

Dance of madness
Shadows running in the night
You and me dancing on the fire
Running on the wire

So let's dance

Burning

God put a heart in the body of a man
Beating in chaos with no defense
You're the dancer of the "Suicide Bar"
Spreading desire no matter how far.

Dance of madness
Shadows running in the night
You and me dancing on the fire
Dancing on the wire.
