Take the stairs to the second floor
Look the name, it's on the door
Pull the gun in the right time
Just one shot took his life.
Hate is spreading very fast
Check the list and see who's next.

Where do you go?
Running
What do you feel?
Lonely
What do you know?
Nothing
About me.

Everybody, everybody
Everybody gets me wrong
No one, no one, no one
And nobody understands me
Be prepared for my attack
'Cause I'm the rebel maniac.

Every night is day for me
Energy and insanity
If it's right or if it's wrong
Don't ask me I don't know
Strange ideals fill my head
I walk hand in hand with death.
