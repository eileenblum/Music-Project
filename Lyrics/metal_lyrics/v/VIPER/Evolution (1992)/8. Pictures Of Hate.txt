Cynical describes me
But yesterday was intensity
Who's to blame, it is a shame?
Sad alone tale of a common man.

I say to you I've tried, I've got no alibi
Many times I looked up to the sky
And saw your face, I wonder why.

Once again I'm flying high
In the thoughts of my tomorrows
From my past no regrets
Only memories of sorrow, lies.

Innocence nobody sees
All the intentions underneath
Childhood dreams are nightmares to scenes
Now I know what liebe means.

Everyone I met before in this game are only pawns
I find myself in shadows
Searching for the distant echoes.

Pictures taken from nowhere
Seasons taken from me
Faces coming and going
So life love death and dreams
Become my pictures of hate.

Memory is beyond your personality
Everybody thinks
Everybody sees
Boundaries of a hopeless mind
Drawing frontiers just before my eyes.
