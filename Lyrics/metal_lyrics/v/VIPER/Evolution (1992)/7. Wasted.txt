Ten thousand endless nights
I felt my fingers touch the skies
Last wind carried away my soul
I will never find myself anymore.

Ten plus ten thousand crazy dreams
And you know, I'm keeping'em in my memories
I'm at the limit that I can afford
Every day I see my thoughts coming from my skin.

For you I'm leaving all my hope
Lead the way 'cause I don't know.

Many times getting high
I've spent a lifetime being wasted
Sad eyes dry tongue
I've been there million times, wasted.

Ten plus ten thousand crazy words
I'm writing everything in my life's book
Snow wings take me out of here
Now I'm hiding in a place where I see no fear.

For you I'm leaving all my hope
But believe I need it so.

Ten plus ten thousand crazy eyes
Have been watching me always and I can't disguise
And all those years I'm still waiting for
Anyone to blind my heart and open my door.

For you I'm leaving all my hope
You showed the way but I can't go.

Many time getting high
I've spent a lifetime being wasted
Sad eyes dry tongue
I've been there million times, wasted.
