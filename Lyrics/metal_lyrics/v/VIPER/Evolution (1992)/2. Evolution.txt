The big desert is far from here
Scarlet clouds in the atmosphere
Built by hands of a million men
Darkest silence of a dead land.

Every night I say a pray
Asking god to see you again
I will bring you back home
Dead or alive, I don't know.

A million dollars cross the sky
Invisible plane a brand new kind
A million people cross the sands
Following the hunger guide.

I hear the siren in sector one
A new rebellion get your guns
Hold your breath if they are close
They take hostages to get drugs

Miles I'm walking seeing the hand of men
Destroying the land.

Is the future on my side?

Evolution
Self destruction

Space battles in the fifth war
Science fiction is for real
Happiness we never feel it
We only see it on the movie's screen.

Human being have a killer instinct
Though we came from the same womb
How can men celebrate
Everytime we drop a bomb?

Evolution
Self destruction
Disease and fear
I walk every night to see the end
To see the end by our side.

Very soon we'll be trapped in our own trap
Our private hell.
When there's nothing left to destroy
Will we destroy ourselves?
Yes!

Miles I'm marching seeing the hand of men
Destroying the land

Evolution
Self destruction
Evolution
No solution
Disease and fear
I walk every night to see the end
Come see the end
By my side.
