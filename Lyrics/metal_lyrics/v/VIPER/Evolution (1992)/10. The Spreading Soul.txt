We are safe in this old storm
Close to the land but you know
Nothing is so calm to everyone.

I look at myself for something new
Tell me a little tale about you
Life is just a rhyme of hopes and crimes.

Better years are coming.

Not in my hand just in my heart
Lay the will I have inside
For all I want, what I feel
Sister moon Brother sun
Yesterday I was alone
All I want, what I feel
Is to be free

Warmed by the sun when it shines
Floating in the air in a red sky
I can realize life is moving on.

I took from my blood all my hate
Guided by the light of fate
Wind blew out my soul to everyone.

Better days are coming.

I'm afraid that when you go
The old storm'll turn around my boat
I don't know how to be free.

If a shadow in my life
Take me out from my red sky
I don't know how to be free.
