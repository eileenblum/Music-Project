Fate always from above
Never lets us know
The taste of the world.

Jake opened heart and mind
Is bordering the line
Between the races.

The deepest we fall is always not enough
Facing the world, back to the wall.

All right I must say no
But it's coming from the inside
All right it's stronger than I thought
'Cause it's coming from the inside.

Fate playing with our souls
Spreads to everyone
Boards of salvation.

Jake living black and white
He never wants to hide
What comes from his inside.

I only know one color of blood.
