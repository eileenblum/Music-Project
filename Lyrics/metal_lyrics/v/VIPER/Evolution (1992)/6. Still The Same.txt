See the fools as they run away
Crawling the stars again
Blinding season seems OK
To leave is just another game.

Reasons to live my time
Reasons to live
I feel like having to hold inside
All the questions from before.

Keep on knowing
In distant skies
We hide the meaning of our voiceless cries.
So many answers
Who's to blame
'Cause my existence is still the same.
That's right!

All the walls are falling
Looking from my room
Everywhere seems nowhere
Unless I see you soon.

I'm the nearest trophy
Of our consequence
Even moments in my mind
Are no evidence.
But I still live, I still live.

See the dreams as they drown away
In oceans of today
Lightning season seems OK
If all the rest remains.
