Buddy you're a boy make a big noise
Playin in the street gonna be a big man some day
You got mud on your face
You big disgrace
Kickin your can all over the place

We will rock you
We will rock you

Buddy you're a young man hard man
Shoutin in the street
Gonna take on the world some day
You got blood on your face
You big disgrace
Wavin your banner all over the place

We will rock you
We will rock you

Buddy you're an old man poor man
Pleadin with your eyes gonna make
You some peace some day
You got mud on your face
You big disgrace
Somebody gonna put you back in your place

We will rock you
We will rock you
