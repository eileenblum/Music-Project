Fate is a fake shall we doubt
A fever flows and seems it's all around
Desolation it sows our roads
My seeds of power in fields away from home.

I've been blinded
By all the mist that we shared.

Lean back your regret
Before the differences of my heart
Now is still the time
Before you throw away
The shelter you should be instead.

Ride the words to get your fame
You hide with shields, the lead outside is rain
Mighty fear down and out
Seeds, the call of truth is all around.

Lean back your regret
Before the differences of my heart
We remain apart
Because you've blown away
The shelter you should be instead.

Fate is a fake shall we doubt
A fever flows and seems it's all around
Desolation it sows our roads
My seeds of power in fields away from you.
