Late in the night
I walk alone and thousand pictures
Are flying in my mind
And all my steps
It's like the beating of my passion
Exploding in my heart
Always ready to run through the life
I never throw, never throw my time away
Say that it's a crime
Take me off the line
Give me what I need
Another night
I'm ready to begin again
Sometimes it's faked
When our hearts can't find the feelings
We're trying to forget
Sometimes your fate
It's not the same what you believe in
You just can't runaway
