Ten thousand endless nights
I felt my fingers touch the skies
Last wind carried away my soul
I will never find myself anymore.
Ten plus ten thousand crazy dreams
And you know I'm keeping 'em in my memories
I'm at the limit that I can afford
Everyday I see my thoughts coming from my skin.
For you I'm leaving all my hope
Lead the way 'cause I don't know.
Ten plus ten thousand crazy words
I'm writing everything In my life's book
Snow wings take me out of here
Mow I'm hiding in a place where I see no fear.
For you I'm leaving all my hope
But believe I need it so.
Many times I've spent my life
And all I've learned was wrong
And many times I've trusted in you
I wish I'd never ever told you all the truth.
Ten plus ten thousand crazy eyes
Have been watching me always and I can't disguise
And ail those years I'm still waiting for
Anyone to blind my heart and open my door.
For you I'm leaving all my hope
You showed the way but I can't go.
