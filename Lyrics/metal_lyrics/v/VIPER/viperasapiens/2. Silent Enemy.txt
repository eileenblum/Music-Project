Walking through the silent town
Footsteps are the only sound
You see darkness in the light
You call violence what we call fight.
In the streets nowhere to run
Our minds are free our work is done.
Who's my silent enemy
Where's the silent enemy
Who cares or understands
Who's my silent enemy
Where's the silent enemy
We believe, it's alright.
Army of a single man
Bringing justice to the land
History is in their eyes
Dollar writers tell no lies.
Underneath our hearts and souls
We free our minds the mirror shows.
Silent enemy
Under a nation's flag
Future will absolve you
From the laws of men.
