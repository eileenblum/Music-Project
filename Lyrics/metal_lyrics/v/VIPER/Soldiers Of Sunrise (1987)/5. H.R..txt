[Pit Passarell - Felipe Machado]

The steel is in my veins
Fire is burning my head
where H.R. is played
Oh, believe I'll be there
My heart burns in flame
When the sound becomes hard
My desire is just the same
When I'm playing my guitar, YEAH !
People come on hear the sound
That united we make in underground
Working hard on stage
Play till death is our vaw
We'll never lose the faith
While we play for the crowd
They try to close the places
Where we reign with our sound
But we'll never let them win!
We'll be forever playing loud!
