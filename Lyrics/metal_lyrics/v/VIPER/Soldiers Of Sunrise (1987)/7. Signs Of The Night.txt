[Pit Passarell - Yves Passarell]

In the age of fights
I'm running wild
I saw the people screaming
I need the glory
This land is bloody
Just the power had given
The wind the sound
The star the sky
Signs of the night
The fire burning bright in the air
Signs of the night
The fire burning bright till the end
Of the world
The swords are burning
You can hear the sound
Many souls has risen
The beast is rising
Death is her mate
She got the rage of the VIPER!
