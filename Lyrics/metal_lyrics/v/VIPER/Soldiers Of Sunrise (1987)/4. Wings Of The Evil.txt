[Pit Passarell]

The blades bright in the night
Brighting at the moonlight
The cold wind freeze my veins
And snow blinds my eyes
Under the sacred oath
Evil force will rise
They gave me wings of steel
And power to fly
And the last death angel warned
Flying under the sun you'll break the oath
Out of the moonlight and the night
Angels of evil will take my life and steal my soul
Wings of the evil will take me through the sky
I need the evil force to stay on high
Flying across the stars riding in the air
No mercy to kill the men no fear of the death
Staining the clouds of blood
Spread the ashes of riot
Reaping who fight to live
Messengers of hate
The night into the end
Clouds don't show the day
While comes the sunrise ray
The death laughs by my side
Now the dream forever ended
Wings of death fall to the earth
Force of light have broken the oath
Masters of evil now you have my soul
