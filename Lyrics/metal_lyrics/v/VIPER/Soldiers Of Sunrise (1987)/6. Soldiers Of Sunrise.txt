[Pit Passarell - Felipe Machado - Yves Passarell - Cassio Audi]

Sunlight into the end and dark breed a new day
Now we'll prepare our lives to keep eager our faith
Soldiers of metal walking through the frozen souls
Showing the rage to set our flag into this world
So we fight!
DIE
Soldiers that don't fight to win
HATE
Flowing in my veins to destroy
TIME
Time to the battle begin
DEATH
We are it
Fast we ride we're Soldiers of Sunrise
Run and win the world
Strong we fight we're Soldiers of Sunrise
Break the chains of all the time tonight
Masters of reason make mistakes and you take the blame
The truth was made only to serve who have more age
But the rebellion comes today when we're united
To break the rules and chains that don't let us have rights
Now we are millions we are united by our hearts
Our sun will always bright when we'll be in the dark
We fight for metal and the sunrise is our sign
To start of the whole end with the force that we have found
