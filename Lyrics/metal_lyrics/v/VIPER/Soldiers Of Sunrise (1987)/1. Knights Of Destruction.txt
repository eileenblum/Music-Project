[Pit Passarell]

Four knights of the light/
Riding in the air through the clouds
And the stars of the sky/
Are warning the curse to the ground
Escaping from the evil land/
Bringing the war and the hate
God will look after my soul/
But my sword will guard my fate
Terror and destruction/
Brought by the four knights of hell
I'm prepared to win/
I'm prepared to fight
Four rider beasts ride the sky
Hell's bells chime/
See the damned horses that ride
Carrying the woe of hell
through the world
Cry and pain/
Four rider beasts kill thousand men
Just one sword across the land
Can save us of the woe in the world
Reaping all the enemies/
Four swords of hell feed the graves
But rulings of the world/
Are nearing the day when we'll fade
We will kill all those/
Who menace destroy our world
Now is our final fight/
Ride up your eyes and raise your soul
Knights of destruction/
I will take you off this land
Evil will not/
Put fear in our minds
And all the pain will find
Then they fight/
There's not any mercy in their eyes
The beast of disgrace and pain won the war
We wrote in the sand/
That we must brought peace to our land
And thousand years will pass
Until return the life to this world
