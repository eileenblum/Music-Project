My time is ending fastly
My pain is growing
You have to hear my prayers
Evil thoughts are coming
The midnight train will leave me
To live in shadows
Don't walk across my meanings
There's no return
The curse is waiting for me
The sky is crying
and while we're fighting lonely
Our honor dies
So why do we keep on fighting
Beside the disgrace
The final comes as lightning
We'll rest in peace
In front of my eyes the men shout
I've got no fear
We hear the bombs cry loud
Nightmare is here
Legions of blindmen marching
No fate no future
For fucking flag we're fighting
Our death is right
Seconds are running faster
They are my life
I'm just a slave of violence
Ready to die
My cross prove that the olders
Control the youngers
Of children they made soldiers
Of soldiers they made deads
