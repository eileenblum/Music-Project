[Pit Passarell - Felipe Machado - Yves Passarell - Andre Matos - Cassio Audi]

I hear the bells chime in the air
I feel the misdeed on this land
They deceased with our gods
But our faith remains the same
They come with crosses, priests and rites
Destroying all that in ages we found
Disrespecting our rights
Spreading the Christ by all the ground
You must believe in our true
You must drink only of our wine
You must follow the sacred Bible
Our god will save your life
But he is the whipper of our souls
Death and fear are his whips
And he'll never take my life
In my heart he'll never be
Fight for your faith don't be tied
By the claws of the whipper
Make your mistakes never follow
The laws of the whipper
Don't let them choke you don't let them
To kill you by the whipper
Keep on your faith that's the only
Knowledge the whipper
How can we make our people
Forget this belief
Years have passed and consolidated
The worst lie that in the world be
But I know, the truthful god
Has no religion has no rules
He's the true that ourselves find
And not what the others place in us
