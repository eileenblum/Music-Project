[Pit Passarell - Felipe Machado]

He was born between weapons he grew
Day and night he learned to survive
The wine was food that the graced with blood
His bible was the law of the sword
But the chains were broken
Now the gods want his soul
The law of the sword will guide his hearts
Day after day he saw the pain
Harlot women and hamlets in flame
On their horses they had the force
Till de death change their routes
Angels of sky and demons of hell
Will not change the destiny of men
He fought with grace he die with faith
This was his tale god bless his name
