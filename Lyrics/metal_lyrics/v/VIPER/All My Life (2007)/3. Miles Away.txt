I watch the curtains fall
I take my one last breath
But when I look around,
I can't see you there
And then I realize
You're distant and far from me
Close my eyes and
All I can see is your face
I'm back in the hotel
I wish that I could stay
Gotta pack my bags fast
And get on the plane

Our time is passing by
We're throwing it away
I'll travel all the world
Just to have your embrace

Laughter helps me to deal with the pain
Will I see you again?
All of this turns my head into a maze
I'm lost and lonely
Miles away
I know we're distant
Miles away
You're not that far from me
That only makes me see
How we're meant to be till the end
