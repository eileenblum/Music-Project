I'll give the keys but you know
You'll have to close the door
Sometimes I take a chance
But I don't know what I'm looking for
Every time you say goodbye
But you're always back again in my life
I'm still looking for the good times
But I left them all behind
To live this life it's so hard

Better days are coming and I need some more
I need some action and I can feel
Feel the dream and the dream's so real
Another way and another time
I can feel I'm gonna cross the line
Face to face, close to me
You can feel, feel I'm gonna cross the line
