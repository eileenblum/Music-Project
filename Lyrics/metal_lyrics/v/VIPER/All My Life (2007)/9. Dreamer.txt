Something about my perception
Tries to freak me out all the time
I do things with no intention
I know that this is no crime

Everyone thinks I am insane
I live in a world far away
My thoughts and my feelings can make me
Observe the drops of the rain
Like crystal tears from heaven
The cry of a god with no prayers
The roar of the beast can tell them
Why fire is burning the hater

All this misunderstanding
Follows me time after time
Trapped in my own memories
I carry this weight with my life

Nothing can make me come back from the start
I'll tell you not to even try
I'm not a sick man, you're just wasting time
These are the words that describe me
Just a dreamer, running through fields in the  rain
I am living life as if there's no tomorrow
A dreamer, tell me you can understand
My heart is filled with ideals, not with hollow
