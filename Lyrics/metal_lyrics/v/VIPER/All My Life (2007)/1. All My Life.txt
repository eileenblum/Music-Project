All my life
I watch the stars falling
Like tears in the dark blue sky
The universe is crying for our faults

Crimes of hate and misunderstanding
Between races and between faiths
Forgetting that we're part of the same dust

But there's so much more
In this whole wide world
That is beautiful

Like when a child is born
And when a flower grows
Or when we find true love
Inspiring us to carry on
All my life

From time to time the world gets closer
When it seems all hopes are over
For mankind to live in peace

For those who trust there's something above
That cares for all of us
One god, one love, one soul

But there's so much more
In this whole wide world
That is beautiful

Like when a child is born
And when a flower grows
Or when we find true love
Inspiring us to carry on
Giving me hope to carry on
All my life
