Feeling like a wicked mind
Memories of sadness are my world
The great moon comes every night
I'm tired of the stones that keep me inside
Come on Come on
An only son
living in a tower all alone
Come on Come on
If I had a gun
I could end this dream and find a soul

Keep away from the wings of fear
Climb the walls, keep searching for the light
Darkness is not the only ghost
I don't want to keep it all inside
Come on Come on
An only son

living in a tower all alone
Come on Come on
If I had a gun
I could end this dream and find a soul
What is mine? I know it's not the answer
But I'll take it if it's all right
Running feeling healing meanings
I'm doing it all right for the last time
Come on come on
I have a gun
Dressed in black I'm feeling so alone

Souls I've never seen before
Another castle then another hole
I can't take it anymore
An evil soul I've got nowhere to go
