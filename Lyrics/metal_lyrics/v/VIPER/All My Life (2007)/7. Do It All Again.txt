I'm not the hours that I've lived
I'm the love and pain deceived
I'm the moments that define them all

I decide who it should be
From beginning to end
I love life to heal my heart and soul
And do it all again
Real life breaks all my dreams
Nightmares wash away my sins
Can't you see, I'm not the one to blame

Just my heart knows when it ends
Sorry not to tell you friend
Now is the time to rule the world
And do it all again

A little bit of a little sin
Wasted time will kiss my lips
I'll do it all again
A little weak, a little freak
I'll cross the world to kiss your lips
I'll do it all again
