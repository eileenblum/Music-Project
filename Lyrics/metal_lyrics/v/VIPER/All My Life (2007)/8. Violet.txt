The night is getting closer
The air is getting colder
That's my excuse to hold you Violet
You laughed at something I said
And that gave me the courage
To whisper in your ear I love you
Violet
Fate sometimes escapes out of our hands
And how does it end?
We'll never know until we're there
Through happiness and sadness
Through sanity and madness
We're meant to stay together Violet
The lust we used to have

Someday just disappeared
And now I have to beg for a kiss

Violet
Love sometimes is not in our hands
Please, understand, please, understand
The first place that we've shared
Our universe so far
By love creating planets
By kissing brand new stars

Excuse me for all my mistakes
Excuse me for all my faults
I wish you all the best my love
