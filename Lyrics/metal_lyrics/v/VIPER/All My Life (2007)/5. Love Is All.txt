We came to this world breaking the silence
Crying for the first air we breath
That's how life begins

Since we're born our destiny's decided
By thousand ways of hating
That humankind creates to divide us all

But there's only one word
Stronger than God
Strong enough to save us
Save me
Love is All that I need

To be strong to be free
Different creeds, boundaries
And ethnicities
Differences that should enrich us all
But oh, Humanity!

They took it wrong and now we are watching
Growing racism but we keep living our lives
Like it's not our fault

All the world is now asking why
We close our eyes to the greed of mankind
Ruining our lives
