It wasn't a waste of time
I was learning on my own
When reality met passion
Craziness and destiny
Love is all I seek
To drive me through this life

Waiting for greetings from above
Make this world my home
A womb with hopes and affection
How I wanted to believe
Love is all I need
To bring peace to my heart

Everybody knows it's not that easy
And everybody loves you
But you're just a dreamer

I wasn't a waste of time
I was learning from your love
If reality meant sadness
If this is my destiny
Love is all I need
To drive me through this life

Waiting for greetings from above
'Cause this world is not my home
To taste some love and affection
God I wanted to believe
That my heart shaped seeds
Would grow and reach the skies
