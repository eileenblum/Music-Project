I am feeling closed inside my world and now
I am trapped in my own dream so lonely
I try to run away from these sad memories
But my mind cannot escape from drowning
Turn around
I wake to win but not today
I think it is not working for me now
I feel inside
But I'm still not free
Where's the miracle
I've seen in my dream?
Dark is my heart
My soul can't be free
I need some kind of miracle to save me
I can dream there is a hope but where is it?
And reality is not so close to me
Draw me paintings of my memories
Put some colors in my life to live on
Turn around
I wake up to win but not today
I think it is not working for me now
