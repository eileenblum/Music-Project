Coma rage gonna rise everyday
Restless I wait for my time to come
To break them all no problem
That's my life
If you are against you're gonna die
Big mistake for you
Having no respect for me
Now I can destroy you it's fun for me
Coma rage gonna rise everyday
Youth on edge
To fuck 'em all
Gimme some
Just in time
Lonely I face the rage of the world
For people like me no future
A deadly race
We're just part of the game
A good gun in my hands
Best way to make you understand
That's the way it's gonna be
Anytime I meet you in the streets
Come rage gonna rise everyday
