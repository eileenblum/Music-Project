Have you ever said the truth
In all these years that I trusted in you
Have you ever shown your face
When I was tryng to get safe
A day before you hide your hands
You wanted more
I took your mask I took your plans
You got nothing left to say
Now you're gone and I've found my way
I can live without your lies
I'm not afraid I won't waste my time
All the money I've ever seen
Ended up being far from me
If you'd ever said the truth
In all these years I'd trust in you
