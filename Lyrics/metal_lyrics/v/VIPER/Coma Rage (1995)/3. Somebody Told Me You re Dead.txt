Filling my head in any bar
With some good friends
No worries so far
It's incredible like some good news
It can't be real
A wish that came true
Somebody told me you're dead
So what's the cause
An overdose of cocaine and hax
Get happy underground jerk!
Now we'll celebrate and have some fun
Sometimes life is cruel
But what is done is done
The lamentation that now I have
I had no luck
I would like to be there
Rage has no limits
But I don't care
Love, I'm so happy
Now that you're dead
