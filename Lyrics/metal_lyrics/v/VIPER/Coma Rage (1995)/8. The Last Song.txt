Under the dark I'm growing
Cut by the light that goes to nowhere
I don't want salvation
I feed my vice with simple isolation and
Observation
Nameless faces from unknown races
Cross my back
Just waiting for death
To get some respect
Life is free to love and die
Tonight we breed tonight we cry
Tonight
Second street with 64th
Somebody watches somebody
Lying on the floor
As lonely as I want to be
I follow the trace of blood
Left on the streets
The vision of somebody dying
Fills the night
What you're calling death
I just call it life
So get away it's not your life
And run away somewhere so far
Take the chance that you have now
To get away
