Try to make yourself natural
I want to see you crawling now
Down on your knees I'll crucify you
Nail your hands into a brand new cross
I'm the pain that you always love
I'm the hurt when you wanted more
If I die by hate
Who will forgive me
If I die by hate
Will you forgive me
Bury me burn me alive
Enslave my brain
Blind my eyes it's alright
If you want to see me dying
If you want to see me begging
You will wait for a thousand years
I will fade when you disappear
Build a life so I tear it down
Brick by brick in your own hometown
Fear and hate walking side by side
I'm the dark of your endless night
