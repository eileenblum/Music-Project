I listen almost everyday
To the same lies hitting my face
That will be better in the end
But I don't really give a damn
I trust a lot in who I am
That's the only way
Blast!
I know I know you're waiting
But I'm not gonna be waiting
Waiting for the time
That you blast me
It took some time to realize
If you don't kill sometimes you die
I use the weapons that I have
So if you wanna fuck 'em all
You gotta make 'em beg and crawl
That's my way
Blast!
I know I know you're waiting
But I'm not gonna be waiting
Waiting for the time
That you blast me
