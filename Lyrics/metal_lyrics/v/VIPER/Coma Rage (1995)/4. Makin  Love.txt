Growing more despite then lies
Plague destroys in front of my eyes
Everything could be better
Nobody cares if it's sun or moon
The silence is loud
In motel rooms
Everybody around the world 
Is getting sick
Makin' love Oh yeah yeah yeah
Dead hearts bleeding
So while we taste 
The poisoned blood
Waiting the cure
Or salvation from God
I can't see no regret
Man loves woman man loves man
Man loves needle
And needle loves vein
Everybody around the world 
Is getting sick
All you need is love
Is it true or is it fair
A manipulation
For a nation's warfare
So why don't they find the cure
At least we have our final bomb
Destroyed love
Put the world in a tomb
Everybody around the world 
Is sick of it
