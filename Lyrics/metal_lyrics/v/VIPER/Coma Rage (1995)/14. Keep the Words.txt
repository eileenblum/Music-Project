Excuse me my heart is cold
Excuse me I have to go
All these people all around
Asking what will happen now
A lot of things went through my head
ow could I have been so sad
And how these feelings are around
Can go away she said:
"I traveled the world trying to get high
But now is time to say goodbye
So excuse me but I have to go
Keep the words I said so far"
I never was afraid
'Cause a dream to hold
You hands someday
And say "let's do it again"
Oh this day will come
But one feeling I can't refrain
If at least I could just pretend
That one more night
You're not away
I traveled the world trying to get high
But now is time to say goodbye
So excuse me but I have to go
Keep the words I said so far
