Breaking rocks in the hot sun
I fought the law and law won
I needed money 'cos I had none
I fought the law and law won
I left my girl and it feels so sad
I guess my race is run
She was the sweetest little woman
That I ever had
I fought the law and law won
Robbing people with a six gun
I fought the law and law won
I lost my girl and all of her fun
I fought the law and law won
