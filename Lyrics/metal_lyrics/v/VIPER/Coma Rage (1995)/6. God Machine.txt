I don't see a single thing
I don't feel a single thing
I don't see you
I don't need a single thing
I don't read a single thing
But I can save you
Tell me what you're here for
I stay with you 24
Hours in a day
Seven days a week or more
I don't care what you believe
If God machine can make me rich
U$ 200 000 is money enough
To build a church
But I don't care for profit
If I am closer to god
All this faith will make you blind
If you walk outta line
Switch off the machine
Live yourself to pray and lie
I don't care what you believe
If God machine can make me rich
