Hey you! You know who I am
It doesn't matter 'cause I don't care
I crossed the line I'm not a slave
I have the world to find my way
So I'm running I keep running
I'll go running I'm always running
Save a prayer but not for me
Life is wrong as you can see
Nobody knows about my plans
I said goodbye to all my friends
So I'm running ain't got money
Always running
Far and near
Twisted souls around the night
Concrete deserts million lights
I look for your changed face
To follow your extinguished trace
Ask yourself try to get something new
Ask yourself try to get something real
So I'm running ain't got money
I'm always running
Far and near
