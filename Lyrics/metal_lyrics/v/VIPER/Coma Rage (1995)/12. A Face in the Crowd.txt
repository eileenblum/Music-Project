How many miracles have you seen
You've committed a thousand sins
Do you know the name of god
He is a messiah at your back door
Last night I asked my soul
Who I am and where I'm from
The answers were as loud
As a machine gun blow
I feel no harm today
Through the windows of my face
Stand up tall
Shout out loud
Feel strong
A face in the crowd
There's a place I wanna go
But it's far from where I am
All the lies that I've been told
Build the bridges to this land
I control a million men
With the power of my hands
But a sound you'll never hear
Is the voice of my command
