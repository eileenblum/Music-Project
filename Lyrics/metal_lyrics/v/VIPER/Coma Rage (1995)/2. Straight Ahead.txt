Let me show you all the lights
Through my eyes
Paint your soul in black and white
To disguise
Keep searching for mercy
Keep praying and hoping
I'm alone
In the back of your mind
It's a real real real world alive
You just told me
We're close to the end
In a real real world so I go
straight ahead
Learn the things you wanted to
Out of school
Live your life in search of truth
Not in books
The existence where I drown
Is deeper than I thought
Is longer than I planned
And stronger than I am
Everlasting state of mind
Are you blind
Go find what all of us try
Right now
