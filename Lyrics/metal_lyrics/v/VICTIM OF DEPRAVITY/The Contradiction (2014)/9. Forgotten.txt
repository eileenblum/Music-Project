You will never see me, sorry
All reminders
FUCK me DOWN
I`m forgotten deeply by your
Violent heart,
SO FUCK OFF

We used to walk across that street,
But now it`s going under.
And when my life was so complete,
You crushed it with a thunder.
Those days I was a part of you,
Today I`m just a phantom.
Forgetting me you killed myself,
I thank you so much, well done!

Cutting your body in pieces,
Tearing your whore eyes up,
Honey, I`d do it with pleasure,

You were too much for me,
I was too naÃ¯ve and weak,
My hate is rising fast,
You will transform to dust.
I`M
STILL ALIVE!

Cutting your body in pieces,
Tearing your whore eyes up,
Honey, I`d do it with pleasure,
Humanity says to me stop.
