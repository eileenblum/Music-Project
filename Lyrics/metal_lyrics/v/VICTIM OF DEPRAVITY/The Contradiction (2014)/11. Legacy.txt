Every human is nothing,
Who doesn`t think so is an object of laughing.
Look at me, I`m just a piece of this world,
All my worthy senses are sold.

And I can seem to you so malicious
Like one of this goddam human species.

You`re able to change this situation,
You`re ought to revenge, don`t be in isolation.
Leave your mental legacy,
Throw it to the crowd,
It`s the strongest remedy,
You`ll win, don`t doubt.

YOU ARE STRONG
YOU ARE FUCKING STRONG

Let this pride come of your violent heart
Outside and burn with your hands. [2x]
