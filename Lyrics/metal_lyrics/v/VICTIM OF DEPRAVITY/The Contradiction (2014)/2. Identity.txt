Hide from me
All your stupid identity,
Be what you want to rise your mind
To become so full of pride.

Hit your face,
Break the mirror in front of you,
Be the leader of newborn crew,
It`s the chance to exist so true.

Leave your world,
That is just beyond,
That you`ve already spoilt.

SPREAD IT OUT
RISE YOUR MIND
BE YOURSELF
SCREAM OUT LOUD

STOP THIS LIE
STOP THIS LIE
