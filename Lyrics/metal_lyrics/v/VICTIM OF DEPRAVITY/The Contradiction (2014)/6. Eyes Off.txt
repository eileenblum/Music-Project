Somebody stole them
From your face,
Now you have just two
Deep holes.
You put your hands there
Where they used
To look all over,
Now they`re gone.

Fuck all the world than,
You can`t see,
You can just smell this
Damn acke.
Know, what I speak of?
Your stol`n eyes.
This is your last guide
To life.

Now you have to
Wander over
In the darkness
You have made.
Eyes are melting
Far from yourself,
They are bleeding
Making grounds.

GET THEM BACK
MAKE THEM SEE
YOU ARE SAVE
THEY ARE FREE
