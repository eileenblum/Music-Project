SLAVE
There`s no sign of fucking freedom
PRAY
For your life that`s still not over.
WASTE
All your time on hardest working,
Don`t
Run away `cause it`s eternal.

You will always stay
In this fucking hole,
Crying for your life,
Feeling deathly cold.
You will die alone,
You are lost in here,
Every soul has gone
Through this atmosphere.
SLAVE YOU ARE
MISSED YOUR CHANCE

Your world is made of fears,
Regrets won`t disappear,
Your eyes` hot bloody tears
Are clear to you, indeed.

You will always stay
In this fucking hole,
Crying for your life,
Feeling deathly cold.
You will die alone,
You are lost in here,
Every soul has gone
Through this atmosphere.

SLAVE YOU ARE
MISSED YOUR CHANCE
SLAVE YOU ARE
MISSED YOUR FUCKINâ CHANCE
