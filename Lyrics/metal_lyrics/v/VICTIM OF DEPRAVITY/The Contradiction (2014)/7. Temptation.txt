You`re so weak
It makes temptation,
Your love`s a trick,
Not a recreation.
You promised me belief till the end,
But it`s a fucking hell, that I can`t stand.

Look, what you`ve done with me,
You whore, on blame,
And I would kill you if I could,
But I`m insane.

TEMPTATION
WEAKNESS, THAT MAKES IT.

It won`t be over
Till I die.
My heart is ordered
Not to lie.
So I am honest
To myself
Just this temptation
Can stop my breath.

Can stop my fucking breath [2x]
