[feat. Artyom from CBTTOR]Blink of your sins
Lies on your skin,
Makes your bad traits,
I am the god of lies and hates,
They`re so through inside me,
Eat my bodies, bite me.

YOU KILLED ME WITH YOUR LIES

I stopped the time
For making memorized
This moment when you ruined me down,
It was in trice.

I cannot realize,
Why my soul dies,
Offer me your price of life.

One part of me / don`t want to live anymore,
Seams on my face / what did you live them for?
Hate fucked my brain / I`m almost mind-split man,
Victim of sins / let`s make the final
BANG

MIND-SPLIT, DEEP SEAMS

Shut me down
With your self-made gun,
I`ve survived for you,
You have covered me to
MUD

I spit on your fucking hope,
I spit on your fucking blame,
Die where you are with your sins,
I don`t care.
