I cannot force
You to tell lies,
Nothing is worse,
You`re the well-placed source.

Your truth makes me blaze,
The past`s out of haze,
I run a race
Out of space

I`ll try to survive
For the rest of my life,
And I will strain
The sense inside my brain.

I cannot force you to tell lies,
Nothing is worse,
I`ll try to survive, for the rest of my life.
And I will strain the sense inside my brain.
