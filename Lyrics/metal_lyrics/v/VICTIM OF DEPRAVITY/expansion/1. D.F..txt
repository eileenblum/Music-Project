Come on bitch catch the meteor
It's falling down right up from heavens
You are all already doomed
The hostages of common lot

The sands of your hopes are running out
And let the bridges burn out
Charon won't be long on the road
They are already heating pan

Where you are going to be boiling soon
And no solitary soul there

The thirteenth horseman is erasing his traces
The roads have ravelled
The flowers have faded

The Judgement day has come, destroying the dreams

This is all reality not nightmares at all
