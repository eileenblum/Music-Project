Now the wind will lead our ship
to mythic lands in ancient times
we cross like hell the raging sea
through waves so tall
that touch the skies

Our fate was written on the stars
which now in the dark they're light our way
their magic light is summon us
but still we are so far away

We must avoid the seven seas
that lead straight to the land
of the dead
cause in this place there is no shield
to escape from the black
scarecrow of death

[Chorus:]
On to the sea we search for the truth
As we sail far away from our home
Oh mighty wind stop frighten our souls
and guide our ship through the storm

Our pirate flag is free up high
skulls and crossbones through the night
and as it waves across the sky
remind us that we'll never die

Breathing hard in hoard frost
find a star before we lost
only one thing keep your mind
never leave your dreams behind

[Chorus]

...and suddenly the skies darkened and
the night became alive...the wind blew
with fury and waves wild and cold as the
death pulled them to the bottom of
ocean in the land of the unburried dead
who are still seeking the surface...then a
frozen gate opened leading them to the
kingdom of death. In a throne made by
souls sit the Lord of Abyss, dark as
shadow, keeping the secrets of sea in
his madness...

I WELCOME YOU TO MY KINGDOM
OF DEATH. DO NOT NEVER TRY TO
ESCAPE FROM YOUR HUMID GRAVES
AND NEVER OPOSE IN MY WILL. FOR
YOU ARE JUST MORTALS AND I AM A GOD

ALL THE POWERS OF THE WORLD CAN'T
OVERCOME AS LONG AS I AM IN SEA
CHOOSE TO DISPUTE ME OR CHOOSE TO
ACCEPT MY GREATNESS...CHOOSE
TO BE DEAD OR CHOOSE TO
BE IMMORTALS!!!!

Black sails to open sea
Dark horizon calling my name
Demon eyes are watching me
As the wind blows
hard through my hair

Triumphfull Gods of
frozen seas our quest
upon this earth has end
we fought with steel
monsters and beasts
and now we lead
the hearts of men

Our fate was written on the stars
which now in the dark
they're light our way
their magic light is summon us
but still we are so far away

[Chorus]
