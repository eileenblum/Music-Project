Remember well the glorious times
of days long past. Cursed by the gods
to lose everything I love
I am a king, a king who rides always alone
you took my sword and now the storm
is coming through

From the dust of time to the veils of
darkness a sword was made by chaos to
destroy chaos. The Gods fearing thy sword
sentenced it to exile. And now the sword
returned to find a new master, the one
who burnt his land and denied his own
kingdom. Elric... the Last Emperor...
of Melnibone!

Storms of fire
Rising skies, burn my eyes
Sons of death
Come to me, take my side
Great desire
Watch them die as I ride
Death shall rise

You took my sword
And the storm now is coming
I will bring
Slavery, death and pain

The blood of kings
Through my veins, warm is running
Fear my name!
with the storm
Nemesis ride like Thunder
Blow the horn
Let the slaughter begin
Take in war
All the glory of Valhalla
Ride with Power, Kill with Fire!

Dragons fly
Fly with me for a last time
By my sign
with your fire attack
Demon rise
come to me take my side
Now I command you to rise!

[Chorus]
Wings of the Storm
I ask for a sign
So long alone
In darkness I ride
Lords of the world
Your secrets are mine
Beware my return
For now it's my time

With the storm
Nemesis ride like thunder!
Blow the horn
Let the slaughter begin
In this war
I will die holy mother
Now scream!

Battlecries!
And the Gates open wide
To the skies!
With my dragon I fly
Terror strikes!
And the Gods now must die
DIE! DIE!

Storms of fire!
in my eyes, burn the skies
Great desire!
watch them die as I ride
Now the Power!
Of Valhalla is mine
MINE! MINE!

Sword of Storms!
Has returned from the darkland
Kill the lords!
Fly again to my hand
Take their souls!
from my revenge drink their blood
