Now mother see your son
Is king to the battle
pure fucking fire-FIRE!!
Glory is calling as I strike like thunder
I'm total power
Steel is on my side - I into glory ride

[Bridge]
In blood through blood in battle
I know only the strong will survive
we crush we kill we conquer
we arrived none of you
will be left alive

With steel and stone riding the storm
we came to leave our mark upon
this sick old world
Ten thousands warriors we march through
the night...under the sign...
Lift your hammers high - keep the faith alive

[Chorus:]
Across the ring of gold free lies
a secret place so far away
where valkyries sing our
songs with pride
After this life shall grant us
wings and let us fly to
find our way up high to the sky
...up to the sky

Into the blood of battle
hundred warriors fight
and die as one
The steel becomes the master
And the fire
the true son of the sun

[Chorus]

Now as I'm ready to take
my last breath, wounded by spear
and sword, I scream your name
Valhalla...to open wide thy gates
and embrace your fallen son...
For to no man or any god
I never kneeled!

Fire, we march for so long
Fire, into the fire we belong
HAIL!
