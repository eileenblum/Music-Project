This is the story of a sword
who led one king in total madness
created by the chaos Lord
and hammered by the runes of darkness
Now let me tell you for thy king
also known as Dark Avenger
he crossed his land by fire and steel
and so his name became a legend

I am the Last Emperor of Melnibone
cursed by the Gods to live forever
with this sword. This sword I know
one day is gonna take my soul

[Chorus]
STORMBRINGER!
Oh magic sword master of night
STORMBRINGER!
Grant me your wings and let me fly
STORMBRINGER!
And when the Elders Gods will die
STORMBRINGER!
I'm gonna catch you in the sky

STORMBRINGER, STORMBRINGER!
STEALER OF SOULS!

I burned to the ground the Melnibone
Did that for you and not for glory
Without a friend without a home
Let see who's gonna tell my story
My love I know you're not alive
But in my heart you'll live forever
And now I hope after this life
To find you and reign again together

I never wished to leave in ashes
my birthland. What I felt that night
you'll never understand. so here
I am alone to make my final stand
