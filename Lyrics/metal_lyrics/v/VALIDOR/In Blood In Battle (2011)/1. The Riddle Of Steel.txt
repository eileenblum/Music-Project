Since men walked the earth fought
with glorious weapons, to claim the
right to become immortal
Fathers and sons, brothers and enemies
all thy heroes shall live again

And under the sign
all those who died
by fire and steel
shall fly by the wind

Up from the sky
valkyries fly
carrying within,
the riddle of steel
