I ride alone into the dark
in place where evil rise
Sword of storm now I command
to come and take my side

Hammered by the wrath of Gods
I'm here to take revenge
from the land where noone rest
in triumph I'll return

[Chorus:]
Grant me wind and fire
and take me to the sky
with fire in my eyes
in hell I ride

I ain't come here to take your life
I came to take your soul
Lord of chaos come to me
come and face my storm

I look into my enemies
and with a smile I say
"Goodbye my friends don't be afraid
I'll see you all again. IN HELL!"

[Chorus]

I ride alone into the dark
in place where evil rise
Sword of Storm, GREAT VALIDOR!
come and take my side

I'm here to crush your unholy gates
revenge I'll take in blood
from the raging storm I came
in storm I shall be gone

[Chorus]
