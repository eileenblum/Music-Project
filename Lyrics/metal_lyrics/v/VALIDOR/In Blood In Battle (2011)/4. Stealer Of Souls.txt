He is coming to your town
carrying a black magic steel
never deny his crown
Hail to the Fire king

[Chorus]
He is the Stealer of Souls!
He owns the night
He is the Stealer of Souls!
The Stealer of Souls!

White hair and flashing eyes
the power of hell on his side
only his steel decides
who lives and who dies

[Chorus]
He is the Stealer of Souls!
He owns the night
He is the Stealer of Souls!
Death rise wherever he rides

Avenger take us
to the eternal sky
Avenger lead us
to the other side
this is our only way
take us to the sky
so far away
