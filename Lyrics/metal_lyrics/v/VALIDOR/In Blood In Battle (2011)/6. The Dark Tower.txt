Back to the grimness in a world
that has moved on
the only thing you see
is a direful damnation
Love and beauty left
and chaos took control
Now there's no hope
there's no salvation

From all the spheres the
black thirteen will rule the world
called by the crimson king
the one who stands on fire
speeding across the blinding
desert for so long
a lonely warrior seeking
the Dark Tower

[Chorus:]
I don't kill with my gun
I kill with my heart
I don't aim with my eyes
I aim with my mind
I walk alone to the dark
to the end of my path
to take the secrets of all

The Dark Tower!

Between the rays that keep
the balance of the worlds
lies a dark place in the centre
of creation
Our righteous cause
Is to protect the secret rose
from those who want to bring
to life extermination

With my gun I live
and with my gun I'll die
walking through lands
where everything is rotten
keep this on your mind
and maybe you'll survive
your father face must never
be forgotten

[Chorus]
