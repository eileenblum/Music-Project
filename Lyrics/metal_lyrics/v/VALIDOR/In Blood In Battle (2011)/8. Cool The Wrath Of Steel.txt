A son from North
to win the Aquilonia throne
to crush them all
to bring the war upon the world

I am a king
I always ride against the wind
I have no fear
I am hammered by
the wrath of Steel

Steel and sword, axe, shield
and stone came to bring the
world at war
men and beasts, slaves and
false kings, I will bring you
to your knees

[Chorus:]
Feel the wrath!
The wrath of steel

No man I fear
to noose I will never kneel
No God I need
as long as I can wield
my steel

So here I am
come and kill me if you can
the time has come
face me in the battle
and you're fucked!

[Chorus]

I lift my hammer in the sky
a steel of blood and thunder
you will not kill me
I cannot die
in battle I'm the Master
