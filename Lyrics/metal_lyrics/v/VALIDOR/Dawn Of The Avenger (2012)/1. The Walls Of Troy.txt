Here inside the walls of Troy, the Gods
decide to bring the end...Many thousands will be killed
by the hand of his son...the son of Achilles
"Sons of the Gods listen to me...
I swear to Zeus and to the Gods of fire that I will
burn Troy to the ground...
by steel and fire
Crush their walls, burn their homes
Kill them, slay them...crucify them!
In the name of Zeus...ATTACK!!!"
