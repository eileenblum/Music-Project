l am a man with sword in hand
I ask no mercy from the Gods
I hold my future on my hands
Against your mortal world I stand
Away from everything is false
And destroy the hearts of men

Life is a eternal fight till the day we die
Fight for what is right
Keep this on your mind never leave behind
What you have inside

With my sword I fight the world
Fight for everything is real
And if I fall on my way
Remember me as a king
Who chose the way of steel

I am a stranger to your world
A lonely rider of the night
without friend without home
I chose my path to walk alone
No matter where I stand I've got
Only my sword

Life is a eternal fight till the day we die
Fight for what is right
Keep this on your mind never leave behind
What you have inside

With my sword I fight the world
Fight for everything is real
And if I fall on my way
Remember me as a king
Who chose the way of steel

Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
