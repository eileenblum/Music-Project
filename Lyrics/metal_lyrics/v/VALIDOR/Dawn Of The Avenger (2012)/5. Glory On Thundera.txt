Magic winds, storms of fire, raging steels and dark avengers
Ride against the armies of the sky
In the night thunder strikes leaded by the light-defenders
Guardians of the secrets of the eye...of Thundera!

Son of war hear my call, open wide the Gates of Fire
And let the Sword of Omen burn their thrones
Raise your swords to the sky, blow the horn, stand and fight
Gods, monsters and men, all shall fall

Let the fire lead us through the storm as we 're marching on side by side
Many enemies died by my sword, the thrones of universe fall tonight

Release fire - Glory on Thundera
Spitting fire - upon your mortal world
Release fire - Glory on Thundera
Spitting fire - Taking the earth by sword
Release fire - Glory on Thundera
Spitting fire - we are sons of war
Release fire - Glory on Thundera
Spitting fire - Taking the earth by sword

Glory On Thundera! Glory On Thundera!

I'm the guardian of the Sword, Master of the Eye
By my fury and my wrath, every man shall die

Let the fire lead us through the storm as we 're marching on side by side
Many enemies died by my sword, the thrones of universe fall tonight

Release fire - Glory on Thundera
Spitting fire - upon your mortal world
Release fire - Glory on Thundera
Spitting fire - Taking the earth by sword
Release fire - Glory on Thundera
Spitting fire - we are sons of war
Release fire - Glory on Thundera
Spitting fire - Taking the earth by sword
