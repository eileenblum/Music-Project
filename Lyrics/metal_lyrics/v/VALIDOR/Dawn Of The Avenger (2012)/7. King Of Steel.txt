I fear no God, I fear no beast and no man
I never kneel, l am the Triumph of Steel

Hail to the Queen who came and showed us the way
The way of steel, the way to overcome our fears
Blood Metal songs, Blood Metal hammers and swords
Brought by the wind carrying the Wrath of my Steel

I am the true son of fire, no one escapes from my flames
Monsters and beasts, men and Gods all they will kneel
Under the sound of my name

King of steel - can you feel my fire
King of steel - coming through the storm
King of steel - glory blood and triumph
King of steel - fear my warrior sword

Now take my hand and let me take you away
To foreign lands where immortality awaits
Join my steel, sing for the triumph with me
Or step aside wherever I ride

But I will stay here on fire so beautiful, young and free
Eternal mighty, eternal power
I have the Blood of the King

I fear no God, I fear no beast and no man
I never kneel, I am the Triumph of Steel
And now I hail only my warrior Queen
For giving me the true Son of Steel
