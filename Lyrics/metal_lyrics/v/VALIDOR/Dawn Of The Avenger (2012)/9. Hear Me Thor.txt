Sons of fire immortal legions
Hungry for flesh and blood tonight
In the night barbarians ride
Under the winds of hammer of Thor

Give me fire and grant me thunder
Let me ride to Valhalla with Validor
Thirsty for blood thirsty for vengeance
And death awaits on the steel of my sword

Hordes of Giants bow to you only
Gods will kneel to your storm
Let you thunder tell my story
And the wind sing my sword

Hear me Thor
Lift your warrior hammer
And crack the winds of sky
Hear me Thor
Lift your warrior hammer
And let it be my guide

I face the earth, I fear no death
The ravens cry for me a firesong
This bloody night for a last time
I raise with honor my sword to the sky

Hordes of Giants bow to you only
Gods will kneel to your storm
Let you thunder tell my story
And the wind sing my sword

Grant me your father's secrets
And let me ride with Validor
Above this fields of fire your ravens fly

Grant me your father's secrets
And let me ride with Validor
I saw through blood
And fire your hammer's sign

Hear me Thor
Lift your warrior hammer
And crack the winds of sky
Hear me Thor
Lift your warrior hammer
And let it be my guide
