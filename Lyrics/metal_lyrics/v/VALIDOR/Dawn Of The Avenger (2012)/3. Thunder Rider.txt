Black winds storms of vengeance, death fall from the sky
The dawn of the Avenger, thousands of men will die
Watching the Gods on heavens falling one by one
By this unknown invader, death upon his hand

Lords of death awaits for my command
Under thunder's sign we will attack

Thunder Rider - I'm the thunder rider
Thunder Rider - Death upon my sword
Thunder Rider - Face the thunder rider
Thunder Rider - Gods and men will fall

Coming down with fire burning every home
Smashing skulls with power, crushing the thrones
And after the slaughter only ashes left
A scream I won't forget... "I WILL RETURN!"

What the hell you are and what you want
Why are you hunting down my soul?

Thunder Rider - I'm the thunder rider
Thunder Rider - Death upon my sword
Thunder Rider - Face the thunder rider
Thunder Rider - Gods and men will fall

Oh my God his blade is so cold
My soul... he's taking my soul
Oh my God his blade is so cold
He is... The Stealer of Souls!

Thunder Rider - I'm the thunder rider
Thunder Rider - Death upon my sword
Thunder Rider - Face the thunder rider
Thunder Rider - Gods and men will fall
