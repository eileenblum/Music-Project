Riding hard through the snow cold winds blow through my hair
Ravens fly above me I know this'II be my final day
Marching on into the battlefield searching powers of the sky
No Gods on my side as I ride within hear my battle cry

Brothers the fire has called my name
In blood and fire I'll meet you again

Grayskull - I am son of fire
Thunder - I wait for your sign
Grayskull - I will take your power
Under your fire I will rise

I left my home to follow war knowing that there's no return
Where the glory is calling it's where the death awaits
My enemies arise I look them straight into their eyes
I grab my sword and for a last time I ride

Upon their blades I search for my peace
A man I was born and I die as a king

Grayskull - I am son of fire
Thunder - I wait for your sign
Grayskull - I will take your power
Under your fire I will rise
