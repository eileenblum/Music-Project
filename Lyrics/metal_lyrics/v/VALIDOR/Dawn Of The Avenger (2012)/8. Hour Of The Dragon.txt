Rising swords lead the sons into the battle
Rising stars mark this night
The dragon is reborn
Demon lord
Shall not fell me from the saddle
Tyr and Mars mark this night
We blow the victory horn
Blow on!

To wait for tomorrow
Is for fools in their sorrow
It's now or never
It's the hour of the dragon

Muse of hordes
Raise the dragon from the castle
Northern stars burning bright
We free the holy sword
Taste the horde
Die for glory and Valhalla
Fires of Mars burn this night
Ride with the dragon lord
Ride on!

To wait for tomorrow
Is for fools in their sorrow
It's now or never
It's the hour of the dragon
