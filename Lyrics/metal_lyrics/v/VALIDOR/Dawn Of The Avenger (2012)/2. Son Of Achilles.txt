Onward into blood and fire for those who died
Thunder and steel my hammer is my guide
Immortal son, I am the fire king
After this war in triumph I will sing

"Now hold your sword high avenger
The final war soon will come
And then the fate of this earth
Will be on your hands"

Smell with the wind great battles in the sky
Listen to the raven, will teach you how to fly
Fly into the night upon the darkest winds
And drink the blood of vengeance
For it's the blood of kings

My fallen brothers
I lead your dream
I swear to our fathers
The Troy will burn by steel

Into the battle I am the lion
And like the lion I am pure blood and fire
I am the one, the one that cannot die
I will bring war upon your mortal lives

Against you all I have no fear
Achilles wrath upon my burning steel
Almighty Zeus now hear my battle cry
Grant me your thunder
And take me to the sky
