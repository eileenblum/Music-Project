Blood fire steel death awaits at the Gates
Let's see who's gonna fall and who's gonna stand
No turning back as we face to face
Kill me if you can or hide as weâ¦

Ride â into Glory Ride, Gates Of Fire
Ride â side by side we ride
Rise â let your thunder rise, against the tyrant
Ride â Zeus be on our sides

Into the fires of battle
Men hungry for flesh and blood
Slay them like sheep and like cattle
Crush their bones and smash their skulls

With a broken sword in my hands
Thousands of men soon will die
Here we will stand to the last man
Sons and fathers side by side

Down into the fire where everything is real
No man shall stand before my steel
I know there's only one way, return with victory
Or with my body on my shield

And as the blood of my enemies lies
The Persians send ten thousand âImmortalsâ
Vainly they're trying to break our lines
They'll never understand the secrets of combat

Ride â into Glory Ride, Gates Of Fire
Ride â side by side we ride
Rise â let your thunder rise, against the tyrant
Ride â Zeus be on our sides

Into the fires of battle
Men hungry for flesh and blood
Slay them like sheep and like cattle
Crush their bones and smash their skulls

With a broken sword in my hands
Thousands of men soon will die
Here we will stand to the last man
Sons and fathers side by side

Down into the fire where everything is real
No man shall stand before my steel
I know there's only one way, return with victory
Or with my body on my shield

My brothers of the sword
So many battles we fought for the glory of Sparta
But now Efialtis came and the Persians will finally pass
With our broken swords we will stand to the last man
And we will dance in the veils of death
For a last timeâ¦
