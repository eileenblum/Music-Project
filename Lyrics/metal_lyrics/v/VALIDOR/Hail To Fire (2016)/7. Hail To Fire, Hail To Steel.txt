Desire and power winds of steel and vengeance
I'm waiting for triumph bound to take my steel
A new dawn is rising everything's on fire
Great sons of Wrathoria come and ride with me

Bones breaking flesh burning only steel remains
The warm blood is running from the battleslain

Rising with the storm and steel will show the way
For all the seas and shores to conquer
Taking by the sword the secrets of the Avenger
And he will lead us as we ride

On the winds of steel and vengeance
For the glory of our king
For the blood that feeds the freedom
Hail to fire, hail to steel

Steel and sword, axe shield and hammer
Wielding by the sound of thunder
Crushing down the earth with power
Death is everywhere

Glorious Wargods grand me triumph
As I ride through blood and fire
To avenge my fallen brothers
On their swords I swear
