Always on my side the Gods of mighty will
Onward into blood and fire, death I have no fear
Rising up with fire rising with the storm
Crushing all the cowards see your kingdoms fall

Storming out the lion, the lion of my soul
Steel is on my side fire is on my sword
Nothing left but darkness where my Blackhorse rides
Immortal youth and power I will never die

Great son of Immortals, sworn to be a king
All shall kneel before me as I take the earth by steel
Pray or bow to no one Vengeance guide my steel
Side by side I ride with fire and fire rides with me
Great son of Immortals, sworn to be a king
All shall kneel before me as I take the earth by steel

Take me to the skies where thunder meets the storm
Let the dragon fly, bring the Avenger's dawn
Following the sign, the secret sign of war
Now the glory is mine, taken by my sword

I was born to wear the crown of destiny
I was born to hear songs of victory
Before the storm I stand to crush my enemies
When all is said and done all will pray for me

Great son of Immortals, sworn to be a king
All shall kneel before me as I take the earth by steel
Pray or bow to no one Vengeance guide my steel
Side by side I ride with fire and fire rides with me
Great son of Immortals, sworn to be a king
All shall kneel before me as I take the earth by steel

I was born to wear the crown
The crown of kings my destiny
I was born to sing the songs
The songs that leads to victory
