This land is blessed by the Gods
The only place where evil cannot dwell
The mountains dance with the clouds
So rough and shiny that warm the hearts of men

Almighty warlords before
Have tried to conquer this land to get its power
Wrathoria won every war
And kept well hidden the secrets of Dark Tower

Fire and steel come that winter
Over wrathoria the army of death
Even the Gods fear their leader
He is the Darklord, the father of evil itself

Crushing and slaughtering their honour
Darkened their kingdom with blood and despair
Lord Crucivador shows horror
Wrathorian's ashes were spread all over the air

And from the flames of destruction
Only two children survive
And the scenes of the slaughter
Reflected into their eyes

Living in wastelands and growing their hatred
Grinding their blades for revenge
He will become king and see âll be a queen
They won't break the oath to avenge

Together they ride side by side into fire
Standing and fighting as one
So it was written that all men shall fall
Under the blade of their son
The Son Of Steel
