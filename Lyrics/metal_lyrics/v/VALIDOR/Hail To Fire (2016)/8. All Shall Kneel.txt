I was born from the true son of fire
On the age when steel meets the bone
Here's my father the master of thunder
The one who brought the Avenger's Dawn

I was born from the Goddess of glory
Here's my mother the warrior queen
Let your black winds sing for my story
And your golden hair guide my steel

My glorious parents I follow your way
And us I ride on to fire they will fear my name

All shall kneel
Under the power of my steel
All shall kneel
Only by death they'll be free
Al shall kneel
Under the power of my will
All shall kneel
Heroes and gods before me

I've been taught the secrets of combat
First why and then how to kill
Never ask help from the Gods
And trust only the steel
My glorious parents I follow your way
And us I ride on to fire they will fear my name

All shall kneel
Under the power of my steel
All shall kneel
Only by death they'll be free
Al shall kneel
Under the power of my will
All shall kneel
Heroes and gods before me

Devil rises and thunder strikes
Upon my hammer you will find peace of mind
Watch the Gods fall from the sky
One by one I took their lives

Cutting throats and crushing bones
Burning the thrones of your fucking world
And as I take the earth by steel
Every man will kneel before me

All shall kneel!!!
