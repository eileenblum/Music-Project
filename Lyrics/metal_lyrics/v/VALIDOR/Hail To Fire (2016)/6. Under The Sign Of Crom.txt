A jewelled throne shines in the night
And shows us where the legend lies
Somewhere between death and life
Our warrior king holds in his hands
The ancient sword of Atlantis
Hammered from the age of Gods

Cimmerian brothers side by side
Under the sign of war we ride
Crushing the Aquilonias pride
With steel and hammer, sword and chain
In blood we march in blood we slay
In blood in battle we reign

Let the wind blow through the gates
Lead the sons to fire
Blow the horn of the living dead and thenâ¦

A king shall rise up from the grave with fire
And from the sky the death will come

Under the sign of Crom
He will rise again like firestorm from the sky
Under the sign of Crom
He will ride against the golden thrones and shiny lies

Ave Validor [9x]

Under the sign of Crom
Under the sign of Crom
