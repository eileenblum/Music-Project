We will not take part in your war against the people
We will have nothing to do with your useless war
The cops are against the people
It has fallen into our hands to protect those who cannot protect themselves
How is it not my fight
How can you stomp on precious life
We will not abide to your brutality
We will not take part in your witch-hunt
