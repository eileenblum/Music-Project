Love for my brother even when the world gets tougher
Love for my sister - smack a creep in the kisser
Stay loyal, stay brave, stay vigilant, stay sane
I've got your back if you got mine
Fuck traitors, fuck fame
No matter who you are or what you represent treat everyone with honor and earn our respect
When the world gets us down we pick each other up
I've got your back if you got mine
Stay true to that and you've got us for life
