Paying the ultimate price for the comfort of man
No freedom or immunity
Only born to die
Trapped away for life
Stripped of all rights
Destroying our homes
Imprisoned for show
Slaves and servants
Hunted for sport
Gutted and drained
Hung as trophies
Used for their tests
Caught in their nets
Skinned for profit
Beaten to death
It's time for retribution
Humans and animals side by side
Are you ready to liberate the innocent
