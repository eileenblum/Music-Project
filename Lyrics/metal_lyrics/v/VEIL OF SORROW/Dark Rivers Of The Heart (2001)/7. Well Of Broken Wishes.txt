The emtiness in me
A wish is not enough
When words have all been said
When truth has sealed my fate

And the distant memories
Of a time so faraway
Of careless days ahead
The youth that knew no plague

Somehow I lost control
Somewhere along the road
I wish there was a way
To turn back time

Well of broken wishes
Know to some as life
The heart lost in darkness
Repels the light of day
