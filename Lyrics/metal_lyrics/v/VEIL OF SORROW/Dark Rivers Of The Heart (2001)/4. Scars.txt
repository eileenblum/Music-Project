Look deep into me
Tell me what you see
A broken image
A cold empty shell
This world brings me down
I'm on my knees
A choking grip so tight
I fear the night descends

How deep the river of fate
In the silence of the hours late

I saw my other self
A smile carved in his face

Reminding me of days long gone
Things would never be the same
And time passed on and on
Brought little hope
The grief that clasps my very soul
Once held there's no return

Look deep into me
See what I've become
A pale reflection
Of what I used to be
The days which linger ever on
They all seem the same
The grief that clasps my very soul
Once held there's no return
