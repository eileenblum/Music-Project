A mask of sad rebelion
In defiance raised
To the heavens above
The streangth that wasn't there
A heart bound for cruelty
An all Consuming agony

There could be no tomorow
When yesterday was despair

The glimmer of a dying star
In beauty in itself
How tragic it may seem
Cleanse the soul from pain
Gateway to oblivion
All bitter seasons fade

There could be no tomorow
When yesterday was despair
In the wishing hours late
Nothing ever changed
