The sky cracks open
To release the pouring rain
The day comes to an end
All dreams are thrown away
This bitter test of time
The darkest shades of light
The rivers of the heart
Run in the blackest streams

An empty world
Seasons pass on by
The broken soul
Cruel fates grasp
Times of grace
Are all but gone

An ever grinning mask
The depths of chaos forged
(Upon) a throne of agony
Sad wings spread for flight
And all the stars do fade
Dying embers in the rain
The rivers of the heart
Will run in blackest streams

A tragic journey in silent halls
When my eyes are closed I am ever lost
I have waited for sun to rise
For the light that never came
