What do you see when your eyes are closed
What do you feel deep down inside
Why do you try to understand your pain
Why do you always walk away

Descend into the darkling seas
Your silent fall

What do you see when your eyes are closed
What do you feel deep down inside
Why do you try to understand your pain
Why do you always walk away

Descend into the darkling seas
Your silent fall
Leave behind the memories
Closed your eyes one last time

You've tread this path so many times
Tried to forget but hurt was always there
Tried to comprehend the nature of your soul
Tried to understand why you were left alone
