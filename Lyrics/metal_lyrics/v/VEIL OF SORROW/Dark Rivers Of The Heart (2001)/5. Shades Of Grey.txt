There are times I fail to see the beauty
Times I fall whit no sence of direction
In this masquerade of cold deception
The secrets of heart
I keep my scars concealed

I can't find mny way through this

All fires burn out of in the end
Long lost passion,endless seems the fall

Sometimes I fall without ever getting up
Sometimes I never even care
But now I'm closer than ever before
Without means to silence the pain

All fires burn out of in the end
Long lost passion,endless seems the fall

Ever silent in a lifetime of regret
The sun was never for my eyes

But I hope for forgiveness
Though I know it's not really yours to give

And as the hours slip away
Like a thief in the dark of night
I may fall deeper to the foul embrace
Of fate,the final flight
