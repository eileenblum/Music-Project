Bleak morning light
Upon fields of ruin
No ecape from the pain inside
A silent cry
That no one hears
Crushed 'neath the shadows of a burden vast

There's no escape
Nowhere to turn
The water dark
Will swallow you

Away from all
A distant dream
Too late to hold on anymore
Behind closed eyes
The fire dies
Endless torment held by silent walls

The rays of light
Cannot shield you
From the dark within
Scars run deep
No time can heal
What has been torn

We grasp for hope
Awakening from this nightveiled existence
That we might find peace

And the will to carry on
