I'm astray somehow
Lose myself to an inner pain
The chaos fed waves of sanity
Slam the door shut again
Can you really see me
As I slowly pass on by
Do you think you hear me
Spoken words I don't recall

The distant ways of life...

Drawing closer to the grief inside
I plunge deeper every day
All I wish for peace of mind
The reason why I cannot stay
Leaving it all behind

I've tried to find a way
Disperse the shadows in my mind
And All these times I did fail
Too blind to see it now
Cold fingers around my neck
So tight I grasp for air
To escape the sleepless nights
There's a price to pay
