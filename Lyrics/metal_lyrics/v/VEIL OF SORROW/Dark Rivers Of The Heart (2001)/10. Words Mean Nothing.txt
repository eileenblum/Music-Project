Somehow I knew what lay ahead
Different shades but all the same
Words mean nothing in the end
The things you feel,the things you say

Eyes may open but cannot see
Torn open to a bleak reality
The silent waves of a pitch black sea
Laying waste the last of me

All the wounds of the tortured heart
All the whispers of the silent cry
All time has gone,(it) won't come again
All wings severed,I know I've failed

They can't see it
Don't know it's there
To bring me to my knees
