There is a shade of gry covering me
And I know well I'm all alone

So please remember
I've learned to suffer
On a lonely path destined to crack

The last remnants of a dying sun
From which a silent cry echoes still
I breathe the agony under a clouded sky
The pain inside only grows whit time

Sleepless clinging on to what's been lost
And I know there is no turning back from here
