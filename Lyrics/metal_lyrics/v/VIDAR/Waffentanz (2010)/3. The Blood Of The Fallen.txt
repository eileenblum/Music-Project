Warriors, who fight for their destinations,
Are not afraid to die on their way.
The death is their eternal persecutor
Like their own shadows until the end.

When the cannon fell silent and peace
descend upon the battlefields of war,
a grey dust of ashes covers the earth.
What will be when every life is lost?

The ground is coloured with blood â The blood of the fallen!
Everything is covered with bodies â Young and old!
The battlefield is deserted â No one is alive!
Only the blood remains â The blood of the fallen!

Whit a high number of innocent victims
every battle can be won or lost.
Dismembered bodies, sad people
are the result of true carnage.

When the cannon fell silent and peace
descend upon the battlefields of war,
a grey dust of ashes covers the earth.
What will be when every life is lost?

The ground is coloured with blood â The blood of the fallen!
Everything is covered with bodies â Young and old!
The battlefield is deserted â No one is alive!
Only the blood remains â The blood of the fallen!

Graves rise up between the ruins of war â
Desolation of the nature â
Deadly silence â no life
There is no human being.

When the cannon fell silent and peace
descend upon the battlefields of war,
a grey dust of ashes covers the earth.
What will be when every life is lost?

The ground is coloured with blood â The blood of the fallen!
Everything is covered with bodies â Young and old!
The battlefield is deserted â No one is alive!
Only the blood remains â The blood of the fallen!
