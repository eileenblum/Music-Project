Sent forth by the rulers of Hades death riders on steel steeds arise
Commanders of sin and corruption a hell patrol with fire in their eyes
Pleasure for torment, hunger for pain 
Demons in denim, leather and chains
Surrender your soul to Lucifer's reign
Pray mercy from the undead in leather
Fuelled by hatred gasoline Satan's riders

An outbreak of unholy evil to slaughter the false and untrue
Enslaving the souls of the mortal so run before they come for you
Pleasure for torment, hunger for pain
Demons in denim, leather and chains
Surrender your soul to Lucifer's reign
Pray mercy from the undead in leather
Satan's riders ignition
