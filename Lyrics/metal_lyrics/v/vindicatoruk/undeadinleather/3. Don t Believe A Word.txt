[originally by Thin Lizzy]Don't believe me if I tell you not a word of this is true
Don't believe me if I tell you especially if I tell you that I'm in love with you
Don't believe me if I tell you that I wrote this song for you
There might be some other silly pretty girl I'm singing it to

Don't believe a word for words are only spoken
Your heart is like a promise made to be broken
Don't believe a word words can tell lies
And lies are no comfort when there's tear in your eyes

Don't believe me if I tell you not a word of this is true
Don't believe me if I tell you especially if I tell you that I'm in love with you
