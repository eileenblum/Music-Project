Bear witness to infernal howling the moonlight shines out in evil's name
Vile masses of undead bodies crawling we surivors draw our weapons and take aim
Many years have passed in this brutal war even though we face certain defeat
But we shall fight them for countless decades more never stopping until our flesh they eat
Beheading, skin shredding undead eviscerating
Rampaging, blood raging annihilation waiting

Men calling as the undead pierce our lair
We must fight to escape this live nightmare
No mercy these beasts should not be alive
Outnumbered we are doomed not to survive
Beheading, skin shredding undead eviscerating
Rampaging, blood raging annihilation waiting
