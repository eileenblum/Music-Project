The black of night, the city deserted the empty streets which will soon be your grave
Demonic plague of unholy creatures a deadly virus turned them into its slave
They shamble on, their corpses decaying insatiable in their hunger for brains
They have no soul, they have no thought only a thirst for the blood in your veins
Tonight the dead shall rise once again
Feasting on the flesh of mortal men

Relentless, the evil creatures march on defences crumble as they spread the disease
A single drop of blood, contagious living hell you watch society fall to its knees
A new world war, satanic bio-weapon condemning mankind to a merciless fate
You lust for flesh, the hunger burning deep you know that all you can do is wait
Tonight the dead shall rise once again
Feasting on the flesh of mortal men
