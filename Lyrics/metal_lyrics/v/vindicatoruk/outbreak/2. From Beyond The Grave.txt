Wake up, to the sound of dragging feet frightful is the sight of hell's advance
Corpses, once the souls of the living now they waltz in Satan's evil dance
Staring, eyes aglow in the moonlight like a sinister hypnotic trance
Turn and run, flee and save yourself it is the only way you stand a chance
Run! Fight for your life
Demons! Rise from hell tonight

Wake up, confronted with the end frightful is human mortality
Corpses, sent to part you with your life soon you will witness their lethality
Staring, into an open sky victim of fate's sheer brutality
Cannot run, cannot save yourself canniballistic fatality
Run! Fight for your life
Demons! Rise from hell tonight

No once can save you now, you are going to die
With dread as these beasts draw near, in darkness you cry
Soon now they will consume, the flesh that they crave
Nothing can stop these creatures, from beyond the grave
Run! Fight for your life
Demons! Rise from hell tonight
