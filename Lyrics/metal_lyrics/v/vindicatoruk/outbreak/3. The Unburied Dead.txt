Blood gushing mouths pus oozing guts
Stench of rotting fills the air from decomposing guts
Staggering blind ungodly grace send them to their final grave
Sledgehammer to the face
Nothing you know shall remain only death, war and pain
Eternal dawn of chaos shall reign when the dead live again

Guns breathing fire men die in vain
Immortal nemesis which cannot feel pain
Consuming victims torturous cries takes their minds
Corrupts their flesh and rapes them as their soul dies
Nothing you know shall remain only death, war and pain
Eternal dawn of chaos shall reign when the dead live again
