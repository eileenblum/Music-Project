When  ignorance is just a beginning,
when  life means only "breathing",
where nobody cares about nothing
today, today we (have to) fight.

Beliefs, creeds and convictions or  hypnosis through lies?
Choices, paths, ways and views or ridiculous theater?

Upon a reign of ashes , 
the truths are written on the sand.
Upon a reign of ashes,
those truths fail in this mankind.

So many footprints are left to those who follow them
and too many signs will change soon after (your) reading.
Once in the Abyss,  none will point you to the way out
and youâll know that Truth is just a broken promise.
