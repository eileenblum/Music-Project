Doubts, crawling in mind as infections
the Truth is denied in this life. 
Lies are crowning the Ego
and like maggots are devouring  the conscience .

I don't care what you preach everyday
I don't care what they said 
in only one Dogma I still believe: "No Faith" 

Contradictions collapse, 
unanswered questions...but they âre still whispering
in the ears of the headless!

"No Faith"

Words, spread out as vile germs.
Masquerades, mimic yourself to (your) surrounding
and lead all the others on a wild-goose chase.

"No Faith"
