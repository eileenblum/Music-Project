âSometimes itâs late for a remedy but itâs never too late to understandâ

Solitude,  your certainty wavers down.
Solitude,  the doubts grow and hunt your soul.

A Treachery  and the strength you gained  âtil this time
Fades away  fades away , a point of no return.   
A Treachery and everything you believed âtil now
Falls away, falls away, youâre on the brink of precipice

No one can help you, wipe out your allies, forget them. 
Thirsty in the banquet, searching for delights. 
Look, how many allies vanish in bad times.
How many of them hold out their hands to you?

Nothing is useless in life, no while has to be erased,
 win or lose youâve made a step forward.
The lower you fall, the higher you have to rise. 
The lower you fall, the higher you have to RISE! 

Suddenly the will revives as a spark.
Suddenly you donât stagger anymore!
