Cold wind blows.
Sun is trapped in the dark curtain of night.
Donât wait for the light to shine,
hope does not heal your suffering.

From the depth of your soul, 
a parade of faces and voices
are coming outâ¦ so vivid, this isn't only a dream.
One of them without eyes to see
is pointing to the sky. 

Breathless silence.
The light is passing through the black 
and slitting the clouds. 

From the depth of your soul,
a parade of faces and voices
Ghosts around youâ¦ no fear.
One of them without eyes to see
is covering your face and lifting your soulâ¦
