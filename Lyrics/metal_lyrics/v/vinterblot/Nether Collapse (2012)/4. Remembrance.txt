No, you couldnât forget those who failed.
No, they cannot leave you alone.

Trespassing the time just for one touch, 
they are here, in yourself:
A mother is smiling, a master is clapping for you.
How long youâve ignored them!
Echoes of Idols.

No, the Death hasnât erased their voices.
No, they havenât left you adrift.

Trespassing the time just for one touch,
they are here, in yourself:
a child at play, an old man and his past.
How long youâve ignored them!
Echoes of Idols.

A quiescence of memories for a long time, 
youâve lost their trails and now it seems to be no other choice: 
The Remembrance.
