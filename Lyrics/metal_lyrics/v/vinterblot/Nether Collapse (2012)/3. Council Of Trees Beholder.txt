Chant scares,
the ritual has begun.
(The) Wound hurts but the blade goes deep and deeper inside.
Screams around,
the ritual has begun.
Limbs bound and the blade goes deep and deeper inside. 

Nobody can hear your screams, 
silent words spat out of your mouth.
Your eyes are wide open, 
you are forced to look up to the sky above.
Force fades away,
the clouds and crows are awaiting
but your fists are still clenched.

In this darkest night, one more tear has fallen
and the leaves are dancing with the wind.
Surrounded only by trees,  alone with his pain,
a man bound by fears and inertia
takes his final breath.
