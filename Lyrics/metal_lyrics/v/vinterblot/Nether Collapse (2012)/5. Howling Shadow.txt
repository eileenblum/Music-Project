Coward, are you lame or die hard?
The dark outside can't make us more blind.
the howl inside suggests us the answers:

Awaken the senses and scare them
to unconscious death,
just a reversion to fierce
feel the anger like wood for fire
and show them how to burst it!
let' em know (it)!

There are a lot of beasts inside us
don't let them bleed in a cage.
Cowardice chains and misery,
is this the fate of our specie?

Gnash your teeth and clench your fists
and let them hear you laugh.
-Why?
Don't ask,
fight or yield.
Gnash your teeth and clench your fists

Stop thinking about the Good and the Evil,
it's time for action, now!
Starving animals stop thinking how to eat,
they just start to hunt, go!
