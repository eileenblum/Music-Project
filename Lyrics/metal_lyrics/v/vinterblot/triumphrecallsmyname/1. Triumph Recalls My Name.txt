At the end of my path,
I see the aim
so brightly clear!
Iâve lost, Iâve lost so much time
trying to breath in the mud

The senses conduct my steps, the fate disclosed all its tiles,
Iâve returned to walk on my route, thereâs no turning back
I shall not stand, I will prevail
The will flows now as a violent flood
(listenâ¦)The wind has spoken, triumph recalls my name *

On my feet once again,
I feel the fury,
The Fury unleashed!
Fueled by anger,
I healed all the grief
 â¦left behind all your lies

[*]
A crack in the sky,
The pouring rain fills in a lake, some twisted trees remind my past
New blazing dawn enlightens the Pathâ¦triumph recalls my name!

Once againâ¦once againâ¦once again...once againâ¦
â¦a sneer on my face

(An endless) Unfading recall
FOR EVERMORE!
