New lords have risen
Beset on conquering the opposed
In the night, thunder crashes
Dark clouds begin to form
Lightnings bright
Assunder amasses the beginning of the storm
Armies amassed
Weapons attached; winds to heed the call
Landscapes passed, plots are hatched
Fields are where they fall

Goddess and maiden and queen of the night
Be near us now and befriend
We have suffered long enough
Having seen pain in the end
A bitter goddess to follow
Beautiful queen to behold
We carry on with hearts so hollow
Revenge for the past shall unfold

From the sky comes the storm, ages and aeons past
Rising high locusts swarm, pages of scripture last
Dead ages lying under the rotted roots of trees
In darkness beneath under, plotting death for the enemy

Goddess and maiden and queen of the night
Be near us now and befriend
We have suffered long enough
Having seen pain in the end
A bitter goddess to follow
Beautiful queen to behold
We carry on with hearts so hollow
Revenge for the past shall unfold

Gods dethroned and deceased
Banished forth storming plague
From our wrath winds released
Thwarted lore, faith is vague

Fallen lords, thou art fallen
Broken and cast to the ground
Destroyed thrones, empires collapsed
Belittled and stripped of the crown
Winds of the storm from ages unveiled

A curse of death rides on the winds
Seasons of never ending misery
Moons of everlasting grief blanket the lands

Tidal waves of horror crash upon the shores
Heavens rain down the asps of sorrow
Demons of the abyss spew forth the fires of war
