The distant eminence of pale light 
Shines through the ecliptic plains 
A sunless world of lifeless souls 
Is falling upon the ordain 

In frozen horizon comes our muse 
With beckoning of the black star 
From the furthest astral sphere 
We accept the call with passion 

From the sky the star breaks the light 
In the night we arise with morbid blood 
Sound the hymns our hearts are beating black 
Silence cries we conquer the golden dawn 

A candelabra dances while the winds recite 
Accompanying trees of harmony with pulse of river flow 
Clouds of resful shelter mountains rise alpine 
Towering thorns begin to grow where roses once thrived 

Irreligious lives thwarted lore of remorse 
Permeate the evil in ancient stark terror 
Sacrilegious times broken church in plague 
Suffering the end with defiled chosen reign 

We revel in pain 

Now we traverse a horrid path 
In godless walk of choice 
The marbled angels of timeless oak 
Entwine the calling stars 

Lost children of banishment 
The rising abyss is adorned 
With striking heavens aftermath 
We forge the unholy crest 

From an ever blackened star 
Our world is wrought from thee 
With silence the words are spoken 
The tongue of spectral breeze 
Given command from endless presence 
Inciting rights of those forgotten 

We implore the darkness 
Influenced form the forefathers we sin 
Rituals of lustful chant 
Remembrance of fallen creed 
Upon the place they died
