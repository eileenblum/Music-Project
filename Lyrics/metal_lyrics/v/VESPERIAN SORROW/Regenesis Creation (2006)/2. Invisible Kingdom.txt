Through the Gates of Serpithia
Beyond the icy thaws and stagnant soils
Loe and behold the mighty palace
Perched above and beyond all things mortal
Gleaming a crest all fathomed splendor 
Shining above the darkness divine
With a ravishing dream, unholy, immortal
Encompassing affliction, yet the Gods concede
Immaculate ascension for the scribes to see

As of and shown by the eyes of Rashor
Is it an illusion of the spell of Trantor
Thought of and sought after by generations
Only to be crushed by ill veneration
Quelled and summoned by divisible freedom
Embarking on a journey to the Invisible Kingdom
In crested and chambered past the tombs of Turill
Invested by labor to create the throne of Krill

The summon of Drun
A princess to guide
To fashion Senton
The passion of Cron

Transparent shadows cover the forgotten passage
Illusions to capacitate the channeling forms
Voiced in ashes whispered across the mist
Shadows of the morrow reflected and trodden
So far away yet so inclusive
Transcending the tears set a cast
Coiled in a universe theatre
Astral connection of infinite link
Orbital detection to constellate the maze

Through the Gates of Serpithia
Beyond thee, I see

The frail have failed, the strong praise in song
Here within the Invisible Kingdom [4X]
