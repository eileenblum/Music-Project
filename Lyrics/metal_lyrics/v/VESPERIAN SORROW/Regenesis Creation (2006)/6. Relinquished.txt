Conquered and overcome, battled and bewithered
Contentious subjects relinquish their grasp
Surrendering a task desirable,
Yet desired by others
Renouncing a compulsion overthrown by the exiled

Implying the denial that one has been defeated
Accepting with haste the ensuing altruism

Horizons of forgotten ash,
they are rebuilt to form
Homage to the few true gods is repaid
Brick by brick, walls
and pillars are reformed
Paths of ancient tombs
and trails of crypts are laid

Reborn once again if only in remembrance
Yet the Cronum have only left in spirit
Apparitions, oppositions

Conquered and overcome, battled and bewither
Contentious subjects relinquish their grasp
Implying the denial that one has been defeated
Accepting with haste the ensuing altruism

Calling, calling to me, I see within my soul
Aeons upon dusk, I rest my weary eyes
