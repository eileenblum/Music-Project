The victorious march towards
the chosen sunsets
Leaving behind a land in turmois and plague
Defeated the vanquished, they lye in shame
Depleted the anguished, they choir the names

Shinto, Arga, Khalar, Rodan

Into a new existence
the vanquished must obey
Withdrawing all remembrance
of their ancient times
Submissive they become,
Conforming to the cronum
They follow their newfound leaders
towards redemption

An alliance is formed,
and with each passing day
A compliance has transformed,
A past led astray
Armies are amassed and united with power
The weak are surpassed within the mage hour

Spirits are called upon to guide the way
Strength and courage carry forth the jouney
In honor they continue, with pride they lead
Searching for the answers,
to the rest of the their lives

Four mighty spheres,
the conquered must worship
Bringers of the seasons,
keepers of the scriptures
Restructuring has begun,
on the Trulon circle
Resting inside the circle,
arches that lead to unknowing fates
