Torches erected for the muse of the wicked
Columns projected for appeasance of wrath
Designating sculptures for intrinsic selections
Decadent arches, for a profane epitaph

Cyclonic delusions lead the clan to entrapment
Betrayal by the ones sworn to allegiance
Entrusted yet questioned they head towards Gurdon
False eyes are looming above the fortified towers

Captured and tortured the innocence is pillaged
Raping of thoughts to steal the soul enraged

Carnival of amusement of devoured beliefs
Flesh is the canvas in which the art is carved
Indulging in sick sadistic offerings
The Gurdonians glutton for pleasure of those

With embracing faces the Lintar is set assail
Winds gust the floating containment across Agdu
The foggy haze conceals the hiding captures
Shackles are silent by the sounds of the Trivol

Exposed in naked dress for all to indulge
Deprived of morals, molested and depraved

Distant cries of ancient rhymes
Awaken the slumbering heathens
Summoning screams, enchanting dreams
Reverse the birth of all seasons
A creed is a truth unfounded
A crown is bore in the night
All religions surrounded
Bred from the sight of thy might
