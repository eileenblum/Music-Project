This day of wrath -
This day shall consume the world in ashes
What trembling there shall be
When the judges do arrive

Everyone and everything, all will be measured
The hordes of Trella Lheer sound the horns of
Tralon Across the graves of all lands mankind arises
To render the account, before the throne

The darkness has conquered, dark souls have risen
Grand new beginning for the unholy ones
Nightfall is constant cold skies are present
Evil is lurking, the horror has begun
The barrier is breeched, the water traversed
All carriers are reached, beseeched and reversed

Gaze upon the greatness -
A utopia we never dreamed possible
The dawn of a new era -
A new beginning, a new world
Created from out own visions -
So it has come to pass forever
So it shall remain for centuries -
Together we are reborn, and recreated

Dawn of a new era is upon every legion
It shall be spawned through terror,
They shall conquer all regions
To pillage the wastelands,
They murder all that is seen
Villages heed their commands,
Castles are stripped of their queens

The darkness has conquered, dark souls have risen
Grand new beginning for the unholy ones
Nightfall is constant cold skies are present
Evil is lurking, the horror has begun

Enchanting from the callings conjuring of evil domains

Foreboding presence is found,
Ominous figures are formed
Screams send out their names,
Speaking in sounds they hear
Foggy shades that guide the moors,
Vaporous mist to shroud them

Stepping out from behind the mirrors stare
Floating through the doors of ancients past
Candles glow to shine upon the glare
Dreamares, nightscapes, evter to the realm

Winding and falling the rivers roar the waves
Binding yet sprawling they deliver the gores of graves
Mournful are calling the new found creation
Scornful shall worship for all generations

Regenesis Creation -
We embrace a newfound beginning
Created from our strength -
We endure to conquer all worlds
