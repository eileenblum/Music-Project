A time laden in chaos
In a land without rule
Anything righteous destroyed
Everything hateful employed

Fires seared the country side
A staff of torch to guide
Pillaged fulfiiment in plunder
Villages overcome in asunder

Evil and terror
Writhing with morbid anguish

Killing all the fathers
Torturing all their children
Beating the elders allowing them to die in stench

Gathering forth the females
Preparing them of fornication
Violating their virgin wombs to set their demon seeds

All unholy presented
Massacre the highest priest
