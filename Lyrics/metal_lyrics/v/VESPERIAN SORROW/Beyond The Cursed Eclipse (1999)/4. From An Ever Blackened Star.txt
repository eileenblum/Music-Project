The distant eminence of pale light
Shines through the ecliptic plains
A sunless world of lifeless ouls
Is falling upon ordain

In forzen horizon comes our muse
With beckoning of the black star
From the furthest astral sphere
We accept the call with passion

From the sky the star breaks the light
In the night we arise with morbid blood
Sound the Hymns our hearts are beating black 
Silence cries we conquer the golden dawn 

An candlabra dances while the winds recite
Accompanying trees of harmony with pulse of river flow
Clouds of Resful shelter mountains rise alpine
Towering throns begin to grow where roses once thrived

Irreligious lives thwarted lore of remorse
Premeate the evil in ancient stark terror
Sacilegious times broken church in plague
Suffering the end with Defiled chosen reign

We revel in pain

Now we traverse a horrid path
In godless walk of choice
The marbled angels of timelss oak
Entwine the calling stars 

Lost children of banishment
The rising abyss is adorned
With striking heavns aftermath
We forge the unholy crest

From an ever blackened star
Our world is wrought from thee
With silence the words are spoken 
THe tongue of spectral breeze
Given command from endless presnce
Inciting rights of those forgotten

We implore the darkness
Influenced form the forefathers we sin
Rituals of lustful chant
Remembrance of fallen creed
Upon the place they died
