hithern lavenderous sea beyond anseptious horizon
throughout entities wrought in skyclad muse
scouring upon pulse there within they prose
as storm begets calm clavering in unison

sunthrone emerge nothingness dogma astound
brethren atone interfangled dwellings
caverns ashone eminence in gracefulness yet graceless
beyond evereve astride restless emptiness

fulfillment provides azure infinence
streams all together upon golden wonder yet wonderless 
adorn from all to possess unkown equate
as within emptiness none is known 

alignment becomes that of intermingled shores
precipitous embarkment encrested by stone
furthern is seen thy magma rupture
forever an uplifted moniker symblance
fallen pantheonian emnants endure
upward a collage exalted by thine
downfall brings on onlasting flow
creating lifespring as one of entity

fate is a sea without shores
and they soul is a stone that abides
they heart is vexed with thy roars
and they face with the surf of the tides

twilight of azrael
showeth upon lost shores
montress afar sanctum
cast thee forth beckoning

engraved in nightfall
sculptured amongst they brow
illuminous essence beheld
of they twilight of azrael

enchated from they crestthrone shone afar
catacombs find oblivions trance
endless thoughts of ancient's mind 
nevermore being the unkown sign

beyond the furthest seawall
lying between the remote sea gates
mighty wave crashes left nothing but ashes
foreboding clouds ensure of they fate

so massive with deepening sides
clad about the sea as with wings
storms abount sorrow yielding no morrow
impelled tides revealing no springs
