From the winter skies
Brought across the frozen lands
I hear her whispering cries
Beyond the pale fallen snow

From her northern empire
Atop the nocturn mountain
She seduces the night
To call upon her winds

I seek the blackened stars
Among the crimson sky
There I find the enchantress
Within her chamber of ice

I've reached her frozen body, lying lifeless and cold
Her sullen heart and crystal eyes, so beautiful to behold

Arise for me, oh! Beautiful one
Thou shall reign, beyond your forlorn palace

We, who stand among the dying
The faithful of a forgotten time
Firesent, from the blackest sky
Victorious, in unholy ruin

We march towards the risen swords
Astride her winds of darkness and death
Driven by the past battle winds
As our fallen sons and burning daughters - JOIN US!!!

The night is a gift I present to you
Arising each wake upon ebony
Awaiting thy return with every nightscape
Of creation of time and life-giving breath
From the crest of the moon comes my body
With the flickering of the stars beats my heart
My face is engraved in the walls of twilight
So my blood flows from everlasting seas

Bloodless, soulless, we possess the darkness

We are bloodless, so unhallowed and soulless
We breed amongst the night
To possess a life of eternal darkness

My heart is pale, pale like the everlasting snow
Across the shores of endless time, I call to thee
Accept my final breath into yours, from a kiss
So immortal and unholy, only to last...Forever
