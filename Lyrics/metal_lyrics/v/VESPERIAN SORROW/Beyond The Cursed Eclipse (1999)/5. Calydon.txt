Not by sunlight nor by starlight is it shone
Nor to the full moons eye or others beings known
Beyond the hallowed sunset eres a perfect star
Above the sweep of havens showing afar

Unrobed and thus untrammelled
Unveiled and presented feel thy strength

Above the sunsets might there can be seen thy eyes
That were above the sundawn in the fiery skies
Shown at the end of morning wretched in stellar path
Behind the dividing light dark oblivion is cast

Shone from an unforeseen universe lost in sight
Across horizons of endless time behold, beautiful
Forgotten and unknown for countless centuries
The most cosmic spacescape withstood elements beckoning
Ancient moons arise awakening every eve
Gleaming upon cold still shallows reflections emanate
Forth all planets vanish leaving one mighty one
Laden in the tempered hallows glimmering glorious

Sought from the nightsky hallows lies the planet Calydon
Enhancing her unknown beauty the moons Cerrus, Prax, Asmon
Constellations forming the only mighty gods
Planetary alignment drawing forth the Elyptic wrath

The walls of the temples
An endless lure of the sacred crypts
Passage granted by chambers
The mountain Ramitar resides within
From the howl of the Kantrell
A surrounding call of the Secton worship
Masses gathering in honour
Surrounded by the Sintarius Dhin
