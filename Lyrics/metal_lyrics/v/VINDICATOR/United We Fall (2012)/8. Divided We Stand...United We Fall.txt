it started with the collapse
of the federal reserve
a country bound by government
whose will became perverse

never cease to end the spending
pulling money from thin air
leaving many of us wondering
how'd they spend what wasn't there

divided we stand
united we fall
the blessed and the damned
the end of us all

the states would slowly lose their rights
we'd seen this all before
those few who mind their history
would recall civil war

but the meek would remain silent
as the fools watched their t.v.
only growing ever violent
towards the thought of unity

politicians drive their many
political wedge between
forcing only their agendas
for their bank accounts unseen

with civil unrest ever growing
inflation kicking down the door
the divided states of america
would soon succumb to war

divided we stand
united we fall
the blessed and the damned
the end of us all

we must stand together
we must find resolve
if we stand divided
united we fall

[CHORUS x2]

divided we stand
we must stand together
united we fall
we must find resolve
divided we stand
if we stand divided
united we fall
together we fall
