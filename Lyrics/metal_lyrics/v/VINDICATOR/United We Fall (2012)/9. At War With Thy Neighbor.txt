waking up, we start our day
by turning on the media
to hear what they should say

we can not think
we can not speak
without their lasting wisdom
to keep us on our feet

they tell us things
like who to fight
point us to our enemy
and tell us why we're right

to hate them all
they're not the same
guilty by affiliation
setting spark to flame

a chip on the shoulder
is it clip in the gun

we simply call them neighbors
and that is where it stops
basting bad behavior
in a dirty social melting pot

this life would be too easy
if we thought to give respect
as human beings our love of hate
is all we recollect

with ten feet between us
there's nowhere to run

diversity?
there's no such word
according to my parties view
difference is absurd

opinions?
that's a fucking joke
this country should see eye to eye
instead of fanning smoke

domesticated violence
ignorance our point of view
tearing down the silence
with a bull horn and a noose

there is no escaping this warhead of hate
the stone that we're carving
becomes our own fate
frustration is crushing us
beneath its weight

at war with thy neighbor
we can not agree
on politics, religion,
and all in between
on all subject matters
we can't get along
digging a trench where a fence
once belonged
hate each others children
hate each others wives
hate each others doings
and how we live life
we're loading our weapons
and placing our bombs
we're storming the front
from the safety of each others lawns

at war with thy neighbor
no love from thy own
at war with thy neighbor
we're creating war from
behind the front door of our homes
