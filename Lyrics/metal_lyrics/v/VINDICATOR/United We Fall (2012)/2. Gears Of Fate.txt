always mind your mother
that's what the elders say
somewhere we grew defiant
like fools, we disobeyed

poisoned soil, ruined sea
blackening the air we breath
reap all the benefits
deny accountability

and she wastes away
nothing left to say

mother warned us this would happen
mother begged us to believe
mother told us that the gears of fate
would crush both you and me

ignoring every warning
like a mouse lost in a maze
blindly seek our only goal
oblivious to nature's rage

never mind the situation
there is nowhere left to run
damn ourselves to demolition
with the damage that we've done

we can not replace
now we face our fate

[CHORUS]

kill the great provider
with a hungry corporate ax
paint her corpse with no remorse
before we pay the tax

she tried so very hard to speak
we tried her patience with our need
insatiable lust to progress
destroying what we don't possess
