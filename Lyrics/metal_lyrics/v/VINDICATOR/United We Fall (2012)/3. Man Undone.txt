it happened without knowledge
it happened without your consent
your own genetic makeup
it now belongs to your government

they do not need permission
they will not ask to compromise
their reassurance plausible
to those who choose to close their eyes

identity theft on molecular scale
keeping the populous muted and pale
the ultimate crime, man undone
man undone

like files in a cabinet
your genes are coldly locked away
a vast genetic playground
at the dispose of the usa

what makes you who you are
is now a fail safe from revolt
helpless to rise against
whose got your double helix by the throat

[CHORUS]

atrocity, this tyranny
yet very few in disbelief
monstrosity, sworn secrecy
ultimate power they achieve
manipulate, assimilate
resistance now is much too late
facilitate, a clear mandate
for those who try to rise against
are those who rush to meet their fate

you can not run, you can not hide
from the very things you store inside
the pinnacle of mass control
a tapping of the human soul
will it ever end, will we ever know
will we ever really be our own
are we really who we say we are
or just another mindless clone

your dna is now property
of the united states government
everything you say and do
will be used against you
you do not have a right to an attorney
you do not have any rights
we are watching
we are listening
we are controlling
we are everywhere
