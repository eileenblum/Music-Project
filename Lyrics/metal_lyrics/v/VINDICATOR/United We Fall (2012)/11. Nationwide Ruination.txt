what's one more stain
that can never be washed from our hands
what's one more sin
gracefully committed by man

with ignorance the wrecking ball
it penetrates and breaks us all
and callousness a social wall
our fellow man we will betray

for nationwide ruination
genocide and devastation
upset the balance for our greater good

this foolish deed, humanarchy
we turn our backs on peace for greed
until there's nothing left to bleed
this parasite called man remains

watch the wrecking ball
it penetrates and breaks us all
and callousness a social wall
our fellow man we will betray

[CHORUS]

this nation will fall to its knees
from betraying its people with greed
man has always sought out devastation

a man destroys that which he fears
a blinded eye that sheds no tear
a violent process of elimination

with ignorance the wrecking ball
it penetrates and breaks us all
and callousness a social wall
our fellow man we will betray

[CHORUS]
