unusual levels of violence and hate
from pent up frustration and rage
the world's gone awry
and we're here for the ride
make our own rules as death makes us wait

we've waited on change and
we've waited on peace
our life has been tethered in chains
we think for ourselves, we no longer need you

make our own world with hell at the reigns

thereâs no compromise
there is no slowing down
devouring all in our way

bastards of noise and aggression
conquer all those who oppose
bastards of noise and aggression
this is the path that we chose

electrified fury, a blitzkrieg of sound
dismantle our victims with fear
physical manifestation of wrath
beaten, but still persevere

bloodied, unbroken, trialed, and scarred
bringing a blade against gun
don't underestimate power of will
our numbers are ten to your one

[PRECHORUS]

[CHORUS]

man without country
danger to your policy
black sheep of the family
bastard

hacksaw, final straw
crushing human wrecking ball
backs are never to the wall
bastard

never die, we survive
swallow fear to stay alive
poisoning your alibis
bastard

scapegoat, cut throat
gonna need a bigger boat
empty lies no longer float

we destroy
