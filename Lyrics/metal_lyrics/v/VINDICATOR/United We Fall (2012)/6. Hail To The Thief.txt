when i was a boy, i pledged
my allegiance to the flag
it's image that of righteousness
since faded into life less rag

a mirror of what we've become
a portrait of the deaf and dumb
but maybe being blind is being free

some one's stealing all our unity
with idle hands they sow the seeds
growing only false democracy

who can we thank for all our grief
hail to the thief
it's hard to see through all this honesty

tattered by the weather
torn from violent storm
our pride of who we are
has been washed
and beaten into form

what have we become
funny looking caricatures
our belief in who we are
confiscated for their purse

something's draining our identity
like being weakened by a curse
politicians feed hypocrisy

who can we thank for all our grief
hail to the thief
it's hard to see through all this honesty
hail to the thief
idiocy beyond belief
hail to the thief
we're being sold short for dishonesty

hail to the thief
