arson
a fire's burning through our land
brother versus brother
in a struggle to command
the acid bath
that is this nation's politics
one can not be too careful
when one can not see the tricks

our eyes wide with amazement
as they cover us in gas
setting fire to our freedom
staying silent as they laugh
can nothing stop
this dynasty
from scorching what makes
you and me

burning down
our unity
burning down
our liberty

denial's the word
when blame's come to call
no one is around
when to ash this burned country
will fall

how do they get away
when the smoke has cleared
and we the people see the people
who ignite our fears

starting fires seems to work
it averts attention
when the heat of the flames
grow too close
there is only one option

run for the lire escape
the lire escape

fire
we feed the unrelenting flames
emotions are the tender as we
play into their games
we can't ignore
the smoke is thickening
the smell of burning life
is sweetly sickening

they strike the match
when we question legality
the paper trail has ended
as they burn what we could
no evidence
except the soot upon their hands
they start another fire
the flames meet their demands

[CHORUS]

Fire, run for the fire escape
