awaiting execution
my savior beckons me
my only path to freedom
lies beneath the guillotine

savage retribution
a brutal reckoning
my country eats free thinkers
for his majesty the king

no use in pleading
it's calling my name
can't stop this demolition
death will get me all the same

a moment of terror
a moment of pain
but i'll finally be free
beneath the guillotine

at noon they will behead me
one less self righteous fool
i say my final prayer
and i pray the blade's not dull

a screaming sheet of iron
sends forth a kingdoms wrath
to enforce one man's opinion
and keep others from my path

no use in screaming
to struggle is vain
can't stop this demolition
death will get me all the same

a moment of terror
a moment of pain
but i'll finally be free
beneath the guillotine
beneath the guillotine

death by decapitation!
go!

a public execution
an example i'll be made
i'll smile till it hits me
show my will to disobey

grinning with redemption
it cuts the evil from it's source
the guillotine will teach us
freedom comes with no remorse
