feeling like i'm trapped
try to run, can't get away
feeling like i'm damned to live a lie
feeling all these feelings
bracing for another blow
'cause life's a bitch until the day we die

feelings are something you can't take away
you can monitor all that i do and i say
but you'll never see what lies beyond my skull
you can treat me like a refugee
an alien to my country
when you're the ones who don't belong at all

eat
all that they say
all that we see
never to be
free
liberties lost
paving the way
communal decay

we the people pay
those of us who will betray
while the people wallow in decay
the recipe for anarchy
a battle hymn for you and me
the mixing pot begins to churn
and burn humanity

reason is something you refuse to learn
while squalor wins out with an extended term
and you're padding your life with blood another man's dreams
we, the human stepping stones
prey for change, until we're bones
have had enough of faux diplomacy

life
wasting away
wasting your choice
chaining your voice
all
liberties lost
paving the way
communal decay

covered in an ichor
of oportunistic greed
the lamb's led to the slaughter
we the lamb's on which they feed

without us they'd be nothing
without them, we'd be free
from idealistic scruples
and oppressive calumny

those in control have lost control
the people left to pay the toll
when getting by's impossible
we all share this decay

crowning clowns in hand me downs
yet no one seems to be around
when sirens screaming anarchy
survive another day

the hand that feeds is now the hand
that bleeds a country dry
the men in suits, the men in black
they share the same disguise

dare we ask them questions?
they bring the hammer down
we never get the answers
and our body's never found
