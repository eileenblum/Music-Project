robbing graves nocturnally
profane to humanity
experiments in creation
my masterpiece, composite son

i am a god
defying death
synthetic life
sewn to the flesh

living death electrified
staring back through empty eyes
pumping blood and drawing breath
i alone have conquered death

i am a god
defying death
synthetic life
sewn to the flesh

i am a god
i've created man
defying death
against nature's plan
synthetic life
born from my hand

conquest of death has lost all control
created life and lost my own soul
unleashing that which was not understood
soaking my hands in innocent blood

turning against my purpose in life
i've only created malignance and strife
now all is lost, i ask myself why
the purest intents have gone so awry

i am a god
defying death
synthetic life
sewn to the flesh

mysteries unfold
at the greatest cost
(sewn flesh)
madness taking hold
feeling all is lost
(sewn to the flesh)
