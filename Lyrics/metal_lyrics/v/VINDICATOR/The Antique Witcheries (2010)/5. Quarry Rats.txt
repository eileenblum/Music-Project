crawl from our holes in the dead of night
spreading our deadly disease
gathering hordes to reclaim our right
bringing this town to its knees

to them we're plague of verminous pests
raising hell from underground
they'll keep us repressed but we'll never rest
again our battle cry will sound

we are the rats, the quarry rats
forever the green and the white
we are the rats, the quarry rats 
and we'll be quarry rats 'til we die 

holding us back with fashion and trends
but they cannot exterminate
we are a tide than can never be stemmed
power and glory our fate

standing unbroken we've risen again
claiming these streets as our own
never to cease until we regain
our rightful place on the throne

we are the rats, the quarry rats
forever the green and the white
we are the rats, the quarry rats 
and we'll be quarry rats 'til we die
