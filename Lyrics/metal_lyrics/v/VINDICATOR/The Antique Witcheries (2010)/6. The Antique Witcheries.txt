the boundless depths of time and space
have seen that which man cannot face
clandestine vaults and archaic tomes
hold secrets that should not be known

the curse of unbound inquiry
revealing dark antiquities
knowledge of forbidden things
madness they are sure to bring

quest for the keys
of cosmic mysteries
none can foresee
what could be set free

seekers of truth should beware
this knowledge becomes a disease
no man should become aware
of the antique witcheries

endless volumes held within
grimoires of the deadly sins
inked in blood and bound in black
deep in miskatonic's stacks

seek them not or find your end
no man's mind can comprehend
esoteric sorcery
never meant to be set free

quest for the keys
of cosmic mysteries
none can foresee
what could be set free

seekers of truth should beware
this knowledge becomes a disease
no man should become aware
of the antique witcheries

locked away
never to be spoken of
kept at bay
waiting for the great old ones

seekers of truth should beware
this knowledge becomes a disease
no man should become aware
of the antique witcheries
