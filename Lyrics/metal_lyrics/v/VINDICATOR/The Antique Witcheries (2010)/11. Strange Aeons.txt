sunken deep, a dormant city in the sea
dreaming god, waiting for rebirth
deathly still, empty labyrinthine halls
in this place, most remote on earth

rising from the blackest depths
ancient evil secrets kept
jagged spires where he slept
soon to break the waves

that is not dead which can eternal lie
and with strange eons even death may die

ritual from forgotten centuries
arcane sorcery most foul
offering to his voracious appetite
summoning from the ocean's bowels

beyond death, slumbering eternally
time has come, awakened by the cult
avatar of what was never meant to be
harbinger, hailing man's fall

rising from the blackest depths
ancient evil secrets kept
jagged spires where he slept
soon to break the waves

that is not dead which can eternal lie
and with strange eons even death may die

writhing mass of tentacles
tattered wretched wings
embodiment of every fear
and all unearthly things

creeping terror from the depths
breeding fear and hate
feeding on iniquity
apocalypse incarnate

sunken deep, a dormant city in the sea
dreaming god, waiting for rebirth
deathly still, empty labyrinthine halls
in this place, most remote on earth

beyond death, slumbering eternally
time has come, awakened by the cult
avatar of what was never meant to be
harbinger, hailing man's fall
