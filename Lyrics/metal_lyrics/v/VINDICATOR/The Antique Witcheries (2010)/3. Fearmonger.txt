epidemic on the rise
viral and infectious lies
stricken by the true disease
fear will keep you on your knees

eastern zealots want you dead
terror threat is in the red
terror of the worst degree
spreading panic on TV

silver tongues twisting words
hypnotize the mindless herds
blinders on, misdirect
paralyzed by empty threats

(fear) fear is their game
(fear) fear is control
(fear) fear keeps you safe

(fear) fear from within
(fear) fear state in place
(fear) fear feeding power

worship at the altar of mass media
disciples of the prophets of doom
terror state conspiracy falling into place
enforcing it from a newsroom

silver tongues twisting words
hypnotize the mindless herds
blinders on, misdirect
paralyzed by empty threats

(fear) fear is their game
(fear) fear is control
(fear) fear keeps you safe

(fear) fear from within
(fear) fear state in place
(fear) fear feeding power

sensationalism created to hide
the sickening realities
the true face of fear being outshined
by glaring irrelevancy
(turn on, tune out)
injecting a sedative into the veins
of those whose minds are weak
a nation of addicts suckles its dope
from the great glass teat
