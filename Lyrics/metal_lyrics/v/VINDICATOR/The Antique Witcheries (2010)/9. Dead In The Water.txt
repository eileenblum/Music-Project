first came the impact
the terrible sound
of the hull being shredded
by a demon unbound
set adrift in the ocean
many decades ago
a frosty leviathan
of ice and snow

cut by ice
your life is burning fast
no oxygen
what you have
it will not last

in water that's up to your chin
you're fighting that something
that won't let you win
in the pit of your stomach
you're feeling the knots
from death inching closer to you

cut by ice
your life is burning fast
no oxygen
what you have
it will not last

dead in the water
finding no air
no time to prepare
dead in the water
for the blackened abyss
and the aquatic slaughter

dead in the water
your life's burning fast
asphyxia's coming with each second past
as you search for an exit
you panic with fear
the black depths are calling
hypoxia's near

you hold it back
primal instinct to breath
that which you lack
will be what makes you deceased

fight the darkness
the feeling to sleep
your body is tired
a mind far too weak
the struggle before you
to find an escape
is a struggle against time
before it's too late

you hold it back
primal instinct to breath
that which you lack
will be what makes you deceased

dead in the water
finding no air
no time to prepare
dead in the water
for the blackened abyss
and the aquatic slaughter

punch punch punch
keep jarring the door
as you pray that it gives
but it won't give no more
water fills the room
from ceiling to floor
leaving no room to breath

pain pain pain
from holding your breath
cherish it now
for there's just seconds left
you're failing the test
of life and death
your lungs screaming to be free

your conscious slips into peace
your vitals ceasing to be
water fills the airways
that once would bring you life
the icy chill surrounds you

dead in the water
finding no air
no time to prepare
dead in the water
for the blackened abyss
and the aquatic slaughter
