the dead are a plague to this planet 
and you think they're alive? 
why? remorse for something that will kill
has no heart, soul, or will? 
no regret, when we burn them all dead
bead up their head
shoot! to kill, it is our solution
our saving grace

we must
raze! (raze) raze the dead
they'll take our fucking lives
so we'll fucking take theirs too
raze! (raze) raze the dead
obliterate them all
the bloodshed's overdue

no hope is what we have
if we don't act now! 
death become us 
if we let them scourge our earth

destroy them all 
however you can
in hopes to save man
revive the will
to keep our race alive

we must
raze! (raze) raze the dead
they'll take our fucking lives
so we'll fucking take theirs too
raze! (raze) raze the dead
obliterate them all
the bloodshed's overdue
