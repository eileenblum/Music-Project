A firey explosion, you think you've survived
Your life's not been spared,
in fact it's denied
There's no escape, a confetti from hell
A Bursting charge from a deadly bombshell

Shrapnel, SHRAPNEL, fly through the air
Shrapnel, SHRAPNEL, metal rip and tear
Shrapnel, SHRAPNEL, brings your final breath
Shrapnel, SHRAPNEL, metal brings your death

A Iron demon seeks your heart
Pierces your skin and tears you apart
You feel the pain and begin to scream
But nothing can save you, this isn't a dream

Shrapnel, SHRAPNEL, fly through the air
Shrapnel, SHRAPNEL, metal rip and tear
Shrapnel, SHRAPNEL, brings your final breath
Shrapnel, SHRAPNEL, metal brings your death
