On Mars, this is my punishment 
I'm bored with guarding scientists
It's no fun because i live for War

Phobos calling out Distress
Deployed alone into this mess
Gateways free a Demonic Swarm

They're comin' Fresh outta Hell

I Stand knee deep in the dead
One man against hellish dead
If i fail, mankind is doomed

Blood-stained on the shores of hell
Enter the Inferno Realm
Possessed, thy flesh consumed

They're comin' Fresh outta Hell

Driven by the overwhelming evil in the air
Storming through the gates into the Cyber-Demon's lair
Falling into darkness, i'm blind to the attack
Crossing through the gateway, i'm never coming back

They're comin' Fresh outta Hell
