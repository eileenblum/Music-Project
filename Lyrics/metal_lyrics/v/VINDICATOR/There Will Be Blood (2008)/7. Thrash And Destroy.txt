[Lyrics: Marshall Law]

Thrashers, so restless and violent a crowd
For minions of metal, it's never too loud
Denim and leather, spikes and long hair
The two horns of metal raised high in the air

[Chorus:]
THRASH AND DESTROY
Thrash and destroy
THRASH AND DESTROY
Thrash and destroy

The rhythm is pounding, the pit starts to fly
The thrashers inflicting cracked ribs and black eyes
Violently throwing elbows and fists
Hundreds of posers crossed off the hit list

[Chorus]
[Wicked solo]
[Repeat first verse]
[Chorus]
