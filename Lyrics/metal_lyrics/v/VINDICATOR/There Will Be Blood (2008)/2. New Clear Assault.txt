MEGADETH! MEGADETH!
News flash cuts the air
sending shivers down the spine
Provoking raising on the hairs

DEMONS BREATH DEMONS BREATH!
The scent's back again
Foul smell of war upon us
Radiation on the wind

MARCH!
Hell's armies have aligned
MARCH!
Brings armageddon quicker

See death from above
Feel hell from below
NEW CLEAR ASSAULT

GENOCIDE! GENOCIDE!
Every human life will end
Shreds the fabric of our lives
Wounds that we will never mend

ASSAULT! ASSAULT!
The end of all is near
Nuclear war has brought about the sum of all fears

MARCH!
Hell's armies have aligned 
MARCH!
Brings armageddon quicker

See death from above
Feel Hell from Below
NEW CLEAR ASSAULT

BLOW THIS PLACE APART 
TEAR THEM LIMB FROM LIMB
BURN IT TO THE GROUND 
NEW CLEAR ASSAULT
