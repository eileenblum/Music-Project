[Lyrics: Vic Stown]

Pulling and straining and stretching the mind
Trying and failing, no hope to unwind
Dark times aren't coming, they're already here
Prepare for the flooding of sorrow and fear

[Chorus:]
Hyperextension
OF THE MIND
Hyperextension

Compression of tissues, about to implode
The flexing of membranes, cooked from overload
Keep trying, keep bracing, and straining from pain
This hyperextension has pushed through my brain

[Chorus]
[Wicked solo]
[Chorus]
