[Lyrics: Marshall Law]

A tropical island, remote and obscure
An epidemic plague the doctor cannot cure
Victims of voodoo, ancient tribal rites
Corpses rise again to kill in the night
The stranded boaters ignore what is said
Unaware of the horrors ahead

[Chorus:]
Risen from the grave
No one can be saved
Final prayers are said
Among us walk the dead

The doctor's wife impaled throught the eye
Alone in the night, no one heard her cry
Lost in the jungle, a graveyard is found
The long dead spaniards crawl from the ground
Now zombies outnumber those still alive
You can run for the hills, but you won't survive!

[Chorus]

Holed up in the old church
In fear, the living cower
Barricades, bullets and bombs all fail
And one by one, they're devoured

Survivors now set out to sea
In an old sailboat, the trio flees
A clear signal found on the radio
The news reveals what can't be so
They did not escape this living hell
The undead rule the mainland as well!
