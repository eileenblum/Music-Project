[Lyrics: Vic Stown, Marshall Law]

MEGADEATH! MEGADEATH!
News flash cuts the air
Sending chills down spine
Provoking raising of the hair

DEMON'S BREATH! DEMON'S BREATH!
The stench is back again
Foul scent of war upon us
Radiation on the wind

MARCH!
Hell's armies have aligned
Brings armageddon quicker

See death from above
Feel hell from below

NEW CLEAR ASSAULT!

GENOCIDE! GENOCIDE!
Every human life will end
Shreds the fabric of our lives
Wounds that we will never mend

ASSAULT! ASSAULT!
The end of all is here
Nuclear war has brought about
The sum of all fears

MARCH!
Hell's armies have aligned
Brings armageddon quicker

See death from above
Feel hell from below

NEW CLEAR ASSAULT!

BLOW THIS PLACE APART!
TEAR IT LIMB FROM LIMB!
BURN IT TO THE GROUND!
NEW CLEAR ASSAULT!
