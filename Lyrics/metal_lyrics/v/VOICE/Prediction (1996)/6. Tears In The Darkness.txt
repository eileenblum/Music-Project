Helpless calling
Tears are falling
In the darkness of the children's room
The face is burning
He can't move his hand
The only witness is the rising moon

Grandma has told him
There's a god on your side
Maybe he's already sleeping
Or getting drunk tonight

Little souls are calling
Screaming all over the world
Victims of hate and dissatisfaction
They blame them for their
Busted life

They did not really want him
No fun to raise and live him
So he's been alone since the day
When he was born
They need and abused him day by day
But the was afraid of running away
He lives in a fortress, fortress of pain

Broken and mistreated
The smile has left his face
He is a victim
In a bad, black game
