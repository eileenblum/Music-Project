The time you feel so sad
Always wasted
The day is gone, but I'll be there
You see the lights go out in the city
So think of me and I'll be there

Another day, another light
Will shine in darkness it's so bright
The sun will rise for you and me forever
A new day dawns after the night

I'll be there
I'll give my life
Baby come and feel my love
The love I give will make you strong
I'll be there forever again

You be absorbed in thoughts
Always dreaming
The time goes by when you are alone
The stays a look of smile
You see a picture of mine
You trying through
You try to close your eyes to see

I'll be there
I'll give my life
Baby come and feel my love
The love I give will make you strong
I'll be there forever again

And don't return
On the way you go
Tomorrow is waiting for you
Don't turn around
Be by my side
Together we will see what we can do
