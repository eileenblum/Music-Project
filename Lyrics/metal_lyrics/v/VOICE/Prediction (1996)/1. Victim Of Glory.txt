Black is the sky
Fire, smoke and violence
Can you hear the warriors scream
In the night
Dead bodies lie
On the ground and in the river
Life or death is on the line

See me, hear me
Look for the blinding light
See me, feel me
Kill or you'll be killed tonight

Your father was like darkness
And your mother was like pain
Fighting with the evil
Cross this bloody rain

Victims of the glory
When the time has come
Pray for your enemy
Or else your soul will stand alone

Cry into sky
Never die
I will survive tonight
To the morning light
