The night has many faces
The sinner and the saint
You're wearing a mask of madness
The fools will sail away

Your true face I have never seen
I am on your trail
Behind this mask you will fail
Behind your masquerade

Chasing shadows wherever you go
Breaking the silence of the night
The powers of evil will guide you
On your last ride

In your life
No ray of light
Into the darkness and
In your mind
A satanic fight
Rising from the hell of your soul

To be yourself, you can't do
You're playing a wrong game
Caught in the spirit with your lies
In the loneliness of a dream

The colors of this world are black
When you get lost in faith
Your sacrifice is pointless
On your mission to change the world

Chasing shadows wherever you go
Breaking the silence of the night
The powers of evil will guide you
On your last ride

In your life
No ray of light
Into the darkness and
In your mind
A satanic fight
Rising from the hell of your soul

In your life
No ray of light
Into the darkness and
In your mind
A satanic fight
Rising from the hell of your soul
