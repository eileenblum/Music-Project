I fall through the time
What's behind the sky?
Dreams come true and fade away
Day and night will
Keep you flying for a long time
Or leave deep scars in our minds
The game of life

So many wasted times
At night shines thousand lights
I lost your trail in chasing dreams
Silent thoughts
Tormenting me behind my eyes
Strange memories glide through the night
And falling down

You and I hand in hand
See our footprints in the sand
Sailing ships so far away
Night falls and we will stay
Just the moon and the stars
Gonna know where we are
Like an eagle in the sky
Keeps our souls alive

After a pouring rain
The sun will shine again
Find shelter from the storm
Fly away
The night will end the day begins
Will see you at the Rainbow Bridge
I'm coming home

You and I hand in hand
See our footprints in the sand
Sailing ships so far away
Night falls and we will stay

Just the moon and the stars
Gonna know where we are
Like an eagle in the sky
Keeps our souls alive

You and I hand in hand
See our footprints in the sand
Sailing ships so far away
Night falls and we will stay
Just the moon and the stars
Gonna know where we are
Like an eagle in the sky
Keeps our souls alive
