Wind blows and fire burns
Raindrops fall and the earth it turns
The magic of metal walk's on our way
A million ways to make the day

It seems for more than a lifetime
We're walking down the endless road
The world is real at our door
What are we waiting for

Flying high, no returning
Leave all behind from yesterday
Cross the sky through this life
And one time again
Fighting, loving, living and dying
Together we are stronger than steel
Let's break the ice of loneliness
Time flows like sand

Take my hand we swim together
Trough the ocean of eternity
Standing up from evil ground
And all faces turn around

When we fall then on the top of the hill
Our thoughts are free as the wind
The beast in me, the beast in you
I wanna hear you scream

Flying high, no returning
Leave all behind from yesterday
Cross the sky through this life
And one time again
Fighting, loving, living and dying
Together we are stronger than steel
Let's break the ice of loneliness
Time flows like sand

Flying high, no returning
Leave all behind from yesterday
Cross the sky through this life
And one time again
Fighting, loving, living and dying
Together we are stronger than steel
Let's break the ice of loneliness
Time flows like sand
Flying high
Fly and one time again
Fighting, loving, living and dying
Together we are stronger than steel
Let's break the ice of loneliness
Time flows like sand
