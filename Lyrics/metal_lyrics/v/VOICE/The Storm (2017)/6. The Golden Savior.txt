Don't fear the prophets but fear the fire
Aroused by frivolous words
Promised salvation, mental power
With creepy souls they capture hearts

Painful struggle and desirous temptation
They know how to catch your soul
You'll walk around like a spireless zombie
We humans are close to downfall

All you mortals come closer to me
Hear my words and you will feel release
I am your truly, almighty redeemer
Trust in my prophesy or fight with the beast

Dreams which we shared together
Attend our memories to infinity
Never fear that you are alone
Follow our golden saviour
Feel the goodness, feel the power
Revive your belief in dignity
Never fear that you are alone
Just follow our golden saviour

Seductive words, packed in pretty colours
Guide you on a prepared way
Feel the shadow of surveillance
All your secrets will be traced

Beyond the horizon everywhere
Dawns the last judgement day
They invite you for a last supper
But the bill you will have to pay

All you mortals come closer to me
Hear my words and you will feel release
I am your truly, almighty redeemer
Trust in my prophesy or fight with the beast

Dreams which vie shared together
Attend our memories to infinity
Never fear that you are alone
Follow our golden saviour
Feel the goodness, feel the power
Revive your belief in dignity
Never fear that you are alone
Just follow our golden saviour

Revive your belief in

Dreams which we shared together
Attend our memories to infinity
Never fear that you are alone
Follow our golden saviour
Feel the goodness, feel the power
Revive your belief in dignity
Never fear that you are alone
Just follow our golden saviour
