Mighty machines unchain their forces
Gradually they come around
Steel on steel no pain no remorse
At the end there is no mercy

Finally the time is over
To leave the way without return
We missed the chance to keep the power
Now let us go down fighting

Storm is rising
Clouds fly away
We smile at death
And challenge our fate

"See the light
Stand side by side
We lead in the fight
With honor and pride"

Hear the roar of the engines
Gasoline smell fills the air
The quivering ground shakes our bones
But the last word is not spoken
Thousands gather for one last battle
They raise their arms in the face of death
Survive together "and die together"
At the end will be only silence

Storm is rising
Clouds fly away
We smile at death
And challenge our fate

"See the light
Stand side by side
We lead in the fight
With honor and pride"

The wind of fate blows rough and steadily
He whips our soul, mercilessly
The fearless will win but the tears will not dry up
Crimson blurs the horizon
The wind of fate blows rough and steadily
He whips our soul, mercilessly
Let's unite all our forces
Which leaves just death or victory

Storm is rising
Clouds fly away
We smile at death
And challenge our fate

"See the light
Stand side by side
We lead in the fight
With honor and pride"

The storm will come again...
