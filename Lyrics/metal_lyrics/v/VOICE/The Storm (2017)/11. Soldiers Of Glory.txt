We pass through the west
We come straight out of hell
Our faces were covered with dust
So they say

Baptized by fire
We are not afraid
Wild fallen angels from home
Far away

The wind blows over the mountains
Cold and straight in my scarred face
Behind the far horizon
We ride without leaving a trace

And we ride with wild horses
Made of steel
Heading straight into the sun
We are soldiers of glory
Our flag in our hands
Hear the thunder of our guns

We are young, wild and restless
Have the power inside
Over land to the sea
For freedom we fight

With whiskey in the blood
And passion in the heart
Glory, glory, hallelujah
We reach for the stars

The wind blows over the mountains
Cold and straight in my scarred face
Behind the far horizon
We ride without leaving a trace

And we ride with wild horses
Made of steel
Heading straight into the sun
We are soldiers of glory
Our flag in our hands
Hear the thunder of our guns

"And we ride with wild horse's
Made of steel
Heading straight into the sun
We are soldiers of glory
Our flag in our hands
Hear the thunder of our guns"

And we ride with wild horses
Made of steel
Heading straight into the sun
We are soldiers of glory
Our flag in our hands
Hear the thunder of our guns
