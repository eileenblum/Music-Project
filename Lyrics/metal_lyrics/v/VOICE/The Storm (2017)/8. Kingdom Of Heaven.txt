Lost out in the desert and far is the horizon
Infinity merges with the sunlight
In that dry white ocean all tears turn to dust
Salvation is not yet in sight

The grandeur of the mountains in the distance beckons
But Jerusalem is our destination
We put the burden on us to fulfil the will of God
The time of truth has arrived

Brothers of faith we are crusaders
Let's follow our path in the glare of the sun
Blinding light seduces our senses
That will not shake our fate

Lost in the nowhere
Caught in the jaws of death
We await the next blow of fate
The shadow of the crescent burns into our backs
But with fear you sharpen no blades

The torture of the past days we've got in our bones
But our sacred mission makes us strong
In the name of god our swords will unite
Only true faith will triumph

Brothers of faith we are crusaders
Let's follow our path in the glare of the sun
Blinding light seduces our senses
That will not shake our fate

One day we will meet again
In the kingdom of heaven
One day we will meet again ... ohoho

Brothers we are crusaders
Let's follow our path in the glare of the sun
We have to be strong for the sake of the Lord
`Cause only the brave will survive
