You got a godly injection
A sparkling mixture floods your veins
Comforting heat passes through your body
Slowly fades out your pain

Now at last start a time of relaxing
All the troubles go away
Forget degradations, forget defamations
You are the man of the day

Sparkling lights surround your face
All the sorrows blown away
This life is easy, this life is great
But only for today

You are the one and only
You are the man who controls your life
There's no problem you can't solve
"You are everywhere on time"
The fear to lose the power
To get the wheel out of your hands
Follows you deep in your dream
And lacerates your brain

Blunt sensation daily frustration
The speed of life is the death of the trice
Make a decision, erase competition
Go ahead don't waste too much time

Again you are on the top of the hill
The peoples behind you are slow and pale
You are so smart and dressed to kill
No time for remorse, vacillation will fail

Sparkling lights surround your face
Al the sorrows blown away
This life is easy, this life is great
But only for today

You are the one and only
You are the man who controls your life
There's no problem you can't solve
You are everywhere on time"
The fear to lose the power
To get the wheel out of your hands
Follows you deep in your dream
And lacerates your brain

Don't forget to run with the pack
Your rat is slowing down
You are the master of disaster
You are the king in town

Sparkling lights surround your face
This life is easy, this life is great

You are the one and only
You are the man who controls your life
There's no problem you can't solve
"You are everywhere on time"
The fear to lose the power
To get the wheel out of your hands
Follows you deep in your dream
And lacerates your brain
