In the blackest hole of hell
Rises a single scream
Chills the blood in your veins
The demons of darkness
Saddling their beasts
They gear up to hunt you down

They know no mercy
They want to hear your cry
"Terror, Destruction"
They set your world in flames
There is no escape, run for your life
Don't turn around, don't waste your time

Now you are alone, your pain will rise
All your supplication will count for nothing
We will see your soul, all your bloody deeds
Your number is up
It's time to say good bye

Do you feel they are close
They can smell your fear
You can still try to hide
They will get you by the balls
Then the fun is over
With the crack of dawn your light goes out

They know no mercy
They want to hear your cry
"Terror, Destruction"
They set your world in flames
There is no escape, run for your life
Don't turn around, don't waste your time

Now you are alone, your pain will rise
All your supplication will count for nothing
We will see your soul, all your bloody deeds
Your number is up
It's time to say good bye

Now you are alone, your pain will rise
All your supplication will count for nothing
We will see your soul, all your bloody deeds
Your number is up
It's time to say good by

With your greasy paws
You have touched their fragile souls
They were under your care
You've abused them as puppets
You've eclipsed their dreams
Have taken their childhood
But now it has an end
Burn

They know no mercy
They want to hear your cry
"Terror, Destruction"
They set your world in flames
There is no escape, run for your life
Don't turn around, don't waste your time

Now you are alone, your pain will rise
All your supplication will count for nothing
We will see your soul, all your bloody deeds
Your number is up
It's time to say good bye

Now you are alone, your pain will rise
All your supplication will count for nothing
We will see your soul, all your bloody deeds
Your number is up
It's time to say good bye
