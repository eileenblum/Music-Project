Sun goes down
Darkness surrounds me
Blood red sky into the light

Lost in the night
Like a candle in the wind
Free me from the chains of my life

Voices surrounded me
In a never-ending day
"Out in the cold"
No escape from reality

Voices surrounded me
In a never-ending game
"Out in the cold"
I will take the pain

Vicious circle
Please set me free
The screams for redemption died away
In the dark

My world's getting closer
And it takes my breath away
There's no angel
We are who we are

Voices surrounded me
In a never-ending day
"Out in the cold"
No escape from reality

Voices surrounded me
In a never-ending game
"Out in the cold"
I will take the pain

Voices surrounded me
In a never-ending day
"Out in the cold"
No escape from reality

Voices surrounded me
In a never-ending game
"Out in the cold"
I will take the pain
