The darkest day will be when we lose humanity
Dark days to destroy our fate
What remains is the fear
And a sky full of tears
Why we have not learned from our wars

Time running out for you
The blood moon is rising
Eclipses the sun, nightmare comes true
Without mercy ascending from hell
Destroyer of dreams
The warlord makes your

Life go down in flames
"Dance the night away"
Your Life goes down in flames
"Dance the night away"

It's only too late if we lose the last fight
Trapped in a cage of despair
The warlord ascends
From the depths of your soul
His madness lets the thunder roll

Time running out for you
The blood moon is rising
Eclipses the sun, nightmare comes true
Without mercy ascending from hell
Destroyer of dreams
The warlord makes your
Life go down

Now we finally opened the door
Looking into the abyss of our souls
Helplessly falling, silent screams
Where is the god of equality
Hold me now, touch me now
Who hears the prayers
Of the preacher in the temples of this world

Go down in flames
"Dance the night away"
Your life goes down in flames
"Dance the night away"

Life go down in flames
"Dance the night away"
Your life will go down
In flames
