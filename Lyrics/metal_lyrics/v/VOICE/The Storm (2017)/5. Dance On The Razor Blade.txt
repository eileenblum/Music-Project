Everybody loves the winners
'Till the winners lose
Sacrifice ourselves in broken nights
To find the final door

Master of the universe
Master we've lost the way

Now we are standing at the crossroads
Not knowing which way seals our fate
The legacy we leave our children
And a dance on the razor blade

We will slide in the darkest times
And fight against the fears
But can find no helping hand
The love will rest in peace

Master of the universe
Master we've lost the way

Now we are standing at the crossroads
Not knowing with way seals our fate
The legacy we leave our children
And a dance on the razor blade

Now we are standing at the crossroads
Not knowing which way seals our fate
The legacy we leave our children
And a dance on the razor Lade

Now we are standing
At the crossroads
Not knowing which way seals our fate
The legacy we leave our children
And a dance on the razor blade
