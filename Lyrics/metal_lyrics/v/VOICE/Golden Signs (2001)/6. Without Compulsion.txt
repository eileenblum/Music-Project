Who is the driver
The driver on this journey
The master of perfection
With the faith of eternity

Behind the frontline
The facade of the beauty
The truth vanishes
With unbelievable accuracy

Leave the way
The way of temptation
Live, every day
Till your true time will come

Live without compulsion
"Lively and free"
Escape from his frozen
"Society"

In th search for sensations
We invent some evil
Beautiful colors of fantasy

Look with the eyes
The eyes of tomorrow
And see the dark future
Created by twilight prophecies

Leave the way
The way of temptation
Live, every day
Till your true time will come

Live without compulsion
"Lively and free"
Escape from his frozen
"Society"

Without compulsion
"Lively and free"
Escape from his frozen
"Society"

Live without compulsion
"Lively and free"
Escape from his frozen
"Society"
