When the last tree has been falled
And the last game turned to flesh
When last deer's been hunted dead
What's up when it makes much cash

Last baby seal has been hooked up
Last tiger also lost its life
For noble ladys dressd in furs
Whats up ots for the beauty of my wife

"PREDICTION"
For the last
Threatening sign
"PREDICTION"
When comes the day?
When comes the time?

When it's gonna be the judgement day?

Whales sink down harpoons in the back
Perish in pain, being chased at any price
Rivers will be dirty and black
They say: What's up!
But we've got just one life

Surgeons turn your face to perfection
The question is: what will be the latest crace?
Animals get a ethal injection
Screaming out: "We are the human race"

"PREDICTION"
For the last
Threatening sign
"PREDICTION"
When comes the day?
When comes the time?

When it's gonna be the judgement day?

The woodlands are dead
The lasr spring has dried up
The late thinking ahead
Dry sand, look around
You're alone in this land
Nobody's here to hold your hand
It will be a nightmare
Please, please awake
We can't eat money
We are the human race

When comes the day?
When comes the time?
When it's gonna be the judgement day?

"PREDICTION"
For the last
Threatening sign
"PREDICTION"
When comes the day?
When comes the time?

When it's gonna be the judgement day?
