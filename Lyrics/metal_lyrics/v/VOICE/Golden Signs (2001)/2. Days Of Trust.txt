First we wanna be so mighty
Than the virtues we have lost
It gives me the creeps to think of that
Shadows of the past
I wanna leave them behind me
And the evil of this world
War, lies and hate

Silence falls between us
This silence takes my mind
Crushing memories, crushing feelings
Hold me tight

Lonely nights
And I feel the long distance
Between human hearts
Surrounded by dust
Lonely nights
Lost in my dreams
Where will be the days of trust

We can't belive in paradise
When hate is standing
At our doors
Brothers must be brothers
And the children should laugh
Forever and ever more

Silence falls between us
This silence takes my mind
Crushing memories, crushing feelings
Hold me tight

Lonely nights
And I feel the long distance
Between human hearts
Surrounded by dust
Lonely nights
Lost in my dreams
Where will be the days of trust

Lonely nights
And I feel the long distance
Between human hearts
Surrounded by dust
Lonely nights
Lost in my dreams
Where will be the days of trust

We keep on driving restlessy
An unknown aimthat no one finds
We breathlessy run aground
With to many expectations in mind

I will lose my faith
My fear I will go astray
We have to learn to lose
To lose to win some day
I will lose my faith
My fear I will go astray
We have to learn to lose
To lose to win some day

Crushing memories, crushing feelings
Hold me tight

Lonely nights
And I feel the long distance
Between human hearts
Surrounded by dust
Lonely nights
Lost in my dreams
Where will be the days of trust

Lonely nights
And I feel the long distance
Between human hearts
Surrounded by dust
Lonely nights
Lost in my dreams
Where will be the days of trust
