Listen to my story
A story of blood and steel
Back in the time
When our hearts forgot to feel

Did we kill for glory?
Did we follow hate?
We brought the seed of destruction
And decided your fate
On our swords stack the shame
Because we knew no mercy

Please god forgive us
Our game with the purgatory
Only now, I feel it
My soul is free

FREE FROM GREED
FREE FRON HATE
Files it way through infinity
And the old brightness
Of my armour
Fades in the light of eternity

Now, after a long time
My conscience troubles me
With it's icy breath
And guilt burns in my inner soul
As in that night, the screams of death

I see the eyes of the children
Sadness they couldn't hide
I feel the fury of the fathers
When we broke their pride
I sense the tears of the mothers
In this world without mercy
Please god forgive us
Our game with purgatory

"Only now, I feel it my soul is"

FREE FROM GREED
FREE FRON HATE
Files it way through infinity
And the old brightness
Of my armour
Fades in the light

FREE FROM GREED
FREE FRON HATE
Files it way through infinity
And the old brightness
Of my armour
Fades in the light of eternity

Fades in the light of the old brightness
