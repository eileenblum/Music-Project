We met like two colliding stars
The flames of lust burning bright
Your passion was young and strong
And rivers arose, each time you cried

The circle of desire was never meant to break
So boundless was our love
And went the wrong way

Where have the angels disappeared?
They took our love along
Left us all alone
Where have the angels disappeared?
Oh, I have called her name
And they came back and dried our tears

Let's break the ice of silence
Let us laugh, let us dance
The night has thoousands of lights
And two of them shine for us again

The circle of desire was never meant to break
So boundless was our love
And went the wrong way

Where have the angels disappeared?
They took our love along
Left us all alone
Where have the angels disappeared?
Oh, I have called her name
And they came back and dried our tears

Look into my eyes
And wrinkles in my face
Whatever my have happened
Live is too precious to go down in flames

Where have the angels disappeared?
They took our love along
Left us all alone
Where have the angels disappeared?
Oh, I have called her name
And they came back and dried our tears
