Sleet, waves, lightning and thunder
Scarfaces with bright eyes
Singing and shouting
On the way to the next bloody challenge

Listen to what Thor calls out to you
Dip your swords into enemy blood
You men with brave hearts, wild and free
Follow the desire of your gods

Great proud battleship, fulfil our dream
Carry us high into the blue sky
Raise your draginhead out of the stream
Great proud battleship, fulfil our dream
Carry us high into the blue sky
To Valhalla we fly
Like in a dream

Fair long plaits blow in the storm
Far away from home
Devoted to their fate
On the search for the eternal glory

Fighting, wounded, killed in action
To please the gods without fear
Praying, cursing with pride in the heart
Valhalla, we are here

Great proud battleship, fulfil our dream
Carry us high into the blue sky
Raise your draginhead out of the stream
Great proud battleship, fulfil our dream
Carry us high into the blue sky
To Valhalla we fly
Like in a dream

Great proud battleship, fulfil our dream
Carry us high into the blue sky
Raise your draginhead out of the stream
Great proud battleship, fulfil our dream
Carry us high into the blue sky
To Valhalla we fly
Like in a dream
