In every place, in every time
Their traces can be found
They rules the world, they changed their times
With hearts so wild and proud

They took the tale into their hands
Stood upright like a wall
No man compelled them on their knees
No hard cry if they fall

Their deeds are immortal every time
In every story-book you find

They were the heroes
The creatures of steel
Better stay and die
Than to plead and kneel

In every place, in every time
Their traces can be found
They rules the world, they changed their times
With hearts so wild and proud

Always was their fighting for
The right side of the law
So they got scars throughout the years
Like soldiers in a war

Where are the heroes
The creatures of steel
Were they lost so far
Were never seen again

They were lost throughout the time
Only their traces you can find
