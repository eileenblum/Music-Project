Thousands of years ago
Under the same sun, in this world
As the gods have spoken to us

Created by human hands
By legeng chased
They keep their mystery
The ancient wonders of eternity

In the name
Of our creator
In the name
Of good sense
In the name
Of your children
Don't let die the bequest!

When we won't be anymore
There will stand a silent witness
For a species that had erected
A monument to themselves

You know nothing is forever
And the pictures fade, fade away
But whatever the reason

Keep the everlasting tale
Let me be your guide
Into the past, to secret signs
Don't be afraid to open your mind

In the name
Of our creator
In the name
Of good sense
In the name
Of your children
Don't let die the bequest!

Of a journey to these pictures
Let me be your guide
A journey into the past
To secret signs
