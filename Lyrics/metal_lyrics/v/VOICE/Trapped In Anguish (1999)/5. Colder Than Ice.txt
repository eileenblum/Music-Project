She came to me, enchanted me, she called me "my dear"
Come fly with me, I heard her say, have no fear
I fell for her and was so proud to take her by the hand
It was a dream and I fooled around like Alice in Wonderland

I was so blind, can't understand how I gave myself to her
Just went on dreaming, and forgot where my red shoes were
She left me for another man, just like the one before
Face like an angel, she kills hearts in high score

Baby, your heart is colder than ice
I've given you love and that's my price
Remember the hours in the heat of the night
When your body was soft and your eyes shining bright

Was possessed by a demon, arrested in a hole
I lost my heart, but I still got, still got my soul
As the world's still turning, I can let it rest, I can let it rest!
Sometimes it's real hard, but I think I've tried my best

Baby, your heart is colder than ice
I was in love and I've paid my price
Remember the hours in the heat of the night
When your body was soft and your eyes shining bright ï¿½ so bright

Baby, your heart is colder than ice
I was in love and I've paid my price
Remember the hours in the heat of the night
When your body was soft and your eyes shining bright
Baby, your heart is colder than ice
I was in love and I've paid my price
Remember the hours in the heat of the night
When your body was soft and your eyes shining bright ï¿½ so bright
