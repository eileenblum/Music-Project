One sunny morning I read my paper
Distressed when I saw the starling line
"Old man found dead in his apartment"
Vague shadows fled out of my mind

Remember the time when I was the child
And the little red house near the wood
The day were excifing, lively and wild
With the old man in the neighbourhood

Please come back
For a last chance
Don't let me alone
With my sorrows
Let us be friends
Forever
Again and again
Today and tomorrow
Again and again
The silent way

When my parents hit me, you dried my tears
Like a father you stayed be my side
Solver of my problems, opposer of my tears
You understood me and told from your fight

Time came one day that I had to leave you
Didn't look back, got out of your life
Forgot my childhood and forgot you, too
Now shame cuts my heart like a knife

Please come back...

Silence!!!
