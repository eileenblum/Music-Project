Initiate! 
Prophetic proclamation unfold! 
Astrological alignment â 
Behold!

The magical card of cards 
The age has begun 
Son of the morning 
Step up to your throne!

One thousand points of light 
Converge and merge to the Nine 
Sacred torch bearers unite 
The power of light is combined

From this vantage point, all is revealed 
No longer a need to conceal 
Our children may now see the light 
Lucifer shining so bright!

Might makes right 
We crown ourselves 
And declare our rightful place 
MY rightful place!

No! What is this? How can this be?! 
We were deceived! 
All of our hopes - all of our dreams 
Illusions! 
We were betrayed!

What will become of our grand empire? 
Our torches of light and Promethean fire? 
We return to the gods what is rightfully ours. 
Cheated, betrayed, but weâll never, ever concede!
