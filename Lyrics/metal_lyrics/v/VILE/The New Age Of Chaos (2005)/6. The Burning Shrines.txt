Domination words flow through their serpent tongues, sinister by nature
Blasphemy and anarchy rule the savage mind
A cleric of ignorance for the blind. Foretold in ancient scriptures
On their knees for endless worship, they shall never see the light again 

And so they prey on to their shallow gods
Falling messiahs preaching prophesies 

Pestilence, oppression and deceit
A ravaged land now bleeds
No one to save them from themselves
Their prayers go unheard 

Koran of ignorance for the blind
Foretold in ancient scriptures
On their knees for endless worship
Only live to exist and endure 

And they shall follow into the kingdom of the dead
And they shall perish encased in their beliefs 

Crumbling palaces and fountains of blood
Ravage of war inflict the terrain
There's no escape from death in the sky
With fierce opposition destroying their shrines 

Overwhelming force
Brought forth with conviction
To destroy all those who oppose
