The sword is no match for the bomb
So they fight in the shadows and kill in the streets
With cowardly tactics of kill and retreat
They escape into darkness
And blend into crowds soon to reappear
They can hide in their temples
And prey in their mosques
The line has been drawn
The line has been crossed
And soon they shall feel
Their final demise! 

Holy walls come crashing down
The immolated bodies burn
Now Fallujah in napalm fire burns
Their futile stand comes to an end 

Once a great threat
Now just a thorn stuck on our side
The human disease
Poisoning visions of religious greed
Deserted lands burning in pools of petroleum waste
Endless night! 

Holy walls come crashing down
The immolated bodies burn
Now Fallujah in napalm fire burns
Their futile stand comes to an end 

Like swarms of locust
Through dessert sands invading
Like a moth drawn to the fire
They await their annihilation 

And soon they'll feel
A surge of power
And soon they'll feel
The wrath of vengeance
And now they'll feel
A surge of power 

And soon they'll feel
A surge of power
And soon they'll feel
The wrath of vengeance
And now they'll feel
A surge of power 

Bow down to the lord of desolation
Bow down to the deafening silence
Bow down to the lord of desolation 

No way out
