I can see that torture
Will be the only way
To get the prisoner to talk 

Now morning bleaks
With a shattering scream
As a razor blade removes the skin on his feet 

But still there's no reaction
Denial is his first response
Must intensity my actions
Skin him alive! 

Day two and the sessions start again
The subjects pale and sleep deprived
You can see his moral is broken
And his sanity is frayed
So I made him pray to a dog
To gain a sense of humiliation 

And now I see reaction
The confession tarts to surface
So I severed two in his fingers
To speed up the process 

Emaciated cries of horror
Fill the hallways
Mutilation of the subjects
Caused by torture
Traumatizing effects that last forever
Psychological decay 

The legacy of Polpot lives on
In the minds of the tortured
Haunted forever by the memories
They're plagued for the rest of their lives
Once a broken man now a smell remains
Of a tattered soul in pain
Waiting to die 

The legacy of Polpot lives on
In the minds of the tortured
Haunted forever by the memories
They're plagued for the rest of their lives
Once a broken man now a smell remains
Of a tattered soul sentenced to live 

There's no limit to the pain
Bring you back from the dead
Force fed feces
Hanging upside down
As you pray to the dog
Suffocation near death
Mock executions breaking you down
You're confessions are in vain
You don't even know the fucking names
