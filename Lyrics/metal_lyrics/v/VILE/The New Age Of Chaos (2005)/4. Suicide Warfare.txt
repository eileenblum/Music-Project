Rise from the ashes
Unconventional warfare breaks out
Glorified eternal life
Promising whores from the seven heavens
Human weapons used as sacrifice
Giving away the will to live 

There's no way to escape the assaults
That begins from within
Legions of darkness invading
Brainwashing to blow themselves apart
Taking all of us to hell 

Killing in crowded halls
Death walks the street among us
Suicide warfare
Taking apart the infrastructure 

There's no way to escape the assaults
That begins from within
Legions of darkness invading
Brainwashing to blow themselves apart
Taking all of us to hell 

Penetration
Devastation 

Crusading through shadows
Recruiting the young
Poisoning minds
Disposable heroes
Strapped to the chest
Explosive vests
Summoning strength
The hour draws near
