Taken by force
Blindfolded and gagged
Paralyzed by fear 

Beaten with no mercy
Dragged through the dirt
And soon confusion settles in
Your mind begins to panic
Racing faster and faster insane
Your thoughts betray your actions
As you roll in a pool of your piss
Suddenly realizing it's your decapitation 

Anticipate
Decapitate
For all to see 

Bludgeoned and shackled
Made to confess
For the sins of a Jewish nation
The words they speak at gunpoint
Telling you what to say
You're a messenger of blasphemy
Destined to endure this savagery
You're loosing all your sanity
And hope for life's salvation 

Day by day, you grow weak
Time goes by, starved and thirsty
You loose hope, fear the worst
Your name is forgotten 

Now you hear
The frantic chanting
The voices you hear are getting louder
Calling, screaming for your execution
Your heart now pounding
Your time has come
Dragged into the room
Screaming for your life 

Hack saw to the neck
Severing your head
