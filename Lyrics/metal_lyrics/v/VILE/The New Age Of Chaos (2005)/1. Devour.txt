The squadron leader makes the call
Hunt down this bastion of verminous scum
Show no mercy take no prisoners
Negotiations are now over

Take a boot to your chest
A knife to your throat confess

Give away locations, motives
Cooperate or die

There comes a time when military might must be unconfined
No holds barred no hands tied it's time to do or die

Eradicate, expunge erase
Demolish, blot out, decimate
Neutralize the opposition
Everyone must die

Smash, butcher overthrow
Execute the worthless foes
Turn to ashes everything
The infidels are here!

Nullify, obliterate
Extinguish, finish off their fate
The holy lands become a crater
In the blackened earth

Devour
The cradle of civilization
The cradle of life
