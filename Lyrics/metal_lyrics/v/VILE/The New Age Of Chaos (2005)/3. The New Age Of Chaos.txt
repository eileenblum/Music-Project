Erase their ancient scriptures
Rewrite their holy book
The words they preach mean nothing
They'll burn in disbelief
Engulfed in flames of napalm
Hellfire retribution
The bells chime echoes
Are called to worship 

Shrines of lies
They now lay burning
Words lost all their meaning
The hidden message is now revealed
Scares of war are never healing 

Arise and see the new age of chaos dawning
A massive conflagrations
Ignites and burns to cinders
The final revelation
The price is death eternal 

Ultimate consequences
The one that we will face
Hellfire retribution
The end is now at hand 

Thousands of clerics
Now line the streets impaled
The blood that flows
Now burns in retribution
The desert land
Littered with rotting corpses
Of those who fought in vain 

The shrines of lies they worship
In dessert sands lay burning
Arise and see the new age of chaos dawning
Fulfil their ancient scriptures
They'll see their future crumbling
Their prophecies denied
The shrines of lies they worship
In dessert sands lay burning
Arise and see the new age of chaos dawning 

Skies turn black
As the oilfields burn
Decapitated bodies rot 

Chaos!
Reins!
Chaos!
