Born into a cruel world
My reality fades and spirals down
I am transcending
Into self-destruction

Embrace my salvation
Though it never nears
Disgraced in frustration
Hide the pain and the fear

Isolation from myself
Will these vices ever end?
Into mass psychosis through the light

Embrace my salvation
Though it never nears
Disgraced in frustration
Hide the pain and the fear

Chronic depression grabs hold of me
Constant repression violent flashes
Through the mind

Incisions tear my flesh
On the brink of suicide
Now I wish that I was never born
Slice my vein so I can die

When I look inside the mirror
Twisted mind beckons me
A waste, a failure, I decide to end my life
There is no future, there'll be no more
No more tomorrow

Ease my pain
