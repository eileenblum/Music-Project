Bring out the wicked
To burn in the gallows
Sacred religion
Lost in the shadows
That cast in the night
Unanswered questions
Obscured by the light
Feelings of evil
Pierced from within

Resurrection
Of the slaughtered
Torn down
And made to submit
Persecution of the wicked
Takes their mind and
Conquers the soul
Takes their mind and
Conquers the soul

Penetration by the ones who-
Subside those who conquer
Generations breeding
Hostile anger
Spreads through the land
Like a cancer
And eats away at the core

Eternal damnation
Relinquished power
My eyes have seen the madness
Through shadows
Now they're breeding - Blind!

Bring out the murdering ones
Decision to execute
Thrown into eternal decay
Penetration by the ones who-
Subside those who conquer
Generations breeding
Hostile anger
Spreads through the land
Like a cancer
And eats away at the core
