Execution of a god
We command him put to death
The demise of a leader
Overcome tyranny

Screams of anguish
Reverberation in the night
Delusions of grandeur
Ripped away from his grasp

Loss of faith, loss of hope
Tonight we watch you hang by a rope
Loss of life, loss of power
By your subjects-Devoured!

Chaotic frenzy
Destruction in their path
Suffocate in fear
While they tear him apart
He tries to summon powers
That he once had
But now are lost

Warm blood gushes from my wounds
There's no pain ' cause I'm paralyzed
Ripped away and hacked at my chest
Left alive to suffer

Loss of faith, loss of hope
Tonight we watch you hang by a rope
Loss of life loss of power
By your subjects-Devoured!

To be mount upon the cross
Your organs displayed
Your insides are torn
You will is lost

Your mind decays
"When will I die?"
Take your last breath
Look what they've done
"Believe my pain
Just let me die
And I watch myself rot"

Suffocate in fear
As they tear me apart
I try to summon powers
That I once had
Ripped away and hacked at my chest
With my pain left
Alive to suffer!
