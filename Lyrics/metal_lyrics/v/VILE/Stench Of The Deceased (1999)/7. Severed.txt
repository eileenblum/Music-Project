My eyes have seen hatred unreal
Bestowed upon me torture
As you exist inside my consciousness
No release from my deadly world
Your mind tormented
Tormented gone insane

My life's a lie
Way I live in vain
To achieve my needs
And abnormal wants
To fulfill my dreams and fantasies
To obtain complete-control

Severed!
Now I'll take their fucking life

Disruption is an ailment
Their twisted minds
Obey my every word
Call me foe as you enter
My domain that's made
Of flesh and bone
...flesh and bone

Your life is mine - you live for me
To be my slave to do as I please
I watch you live, I let you breath
I watch you die
