[Lyrics: Urteaga  Music: Davis]

To kill the beast from within
Make it crumble to the ground and watch it burn
To shower it with hatred
Lacerate its will sever its way of life

Religion
They preach of holy wars
Their bibles
Speak lies in foreign languages
Deception
Shall lead to human waste

They are the bastard sons of treachery
Waging their wars so cowardly

Seeking no vengeance
We search for life
To the ends of the earth
Leave no stones unturned.
They shall pay!!

[solo AA]

Awoke the might of a sleeping giant
Oppressed by fear they flee their cities

Seeking no vengeance
We search for life
To the ends of the earth
Leave no stones unturned
Retalitaion
An eye for an eye
Crushed by this nation
Your people shall die
