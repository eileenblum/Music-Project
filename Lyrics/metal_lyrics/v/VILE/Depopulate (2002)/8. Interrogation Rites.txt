[Lyrics: Urteaga  Music: Davis]

Captured now your fucked!
There's no escaping from your inbelievably painful fate
Interrogation starts
As you start to prepare mentally for what's at hand
Electrical shocks
Run viciously through your veins as you violently convulse in agony

Tied down beaten drenched in your piss
Awaiting salvation of death
Night after  night
Preparing new tortures
Your bound by the will they must break
Blinded in darkness and festering shit
You question the reasons to live
Sleepless and blood soaked you prey for the end
Knowing tomorrow it starts all again

At dawn they come again.
And soon you'll feel pain unlike you've ever felt before
Drenched in gasoline
The fumes suffocate you as your wounds begin to swelter and boil
Interrogation rites
Ritualistic afflictions of hideous deformities to the flesh

Tied down beaten drenched in your piss
Awaiting salvation of death
Night after night
Preparing new tortures
Your bound by the will they must break
Blinded in darkness and festering shit
You question the reasons to live
Sleepless and blood soaked you prey for the end
Knowing tomorrow it starts all again

Never ending Questioning
Relentless suffering

Your bodynumb from the punishment
Your face is beaten, your eyes wired shut

Try to escape reality
Your mind wanders endlessly

Into an altered state of consciousness
As your mind dissolves, suffering
You strive on never giving in
Learn to absorb the brutality

Resisting
As long as you can take it
Increasing
The pain keeps getting stronger
The voices
They just keep getting louder
Resisting

(solo AA)

You conquered pain
You seem to like the way it feels
You take it in
You welcome its sensation
You smile and grin
Amazed they look in horror
Unsatisfied, they point and pull the trigger

And Kill You!!
