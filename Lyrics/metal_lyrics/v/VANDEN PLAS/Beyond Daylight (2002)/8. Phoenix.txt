All the kings horses are coming down
To leave the empire
And something was sent to protect us now
Reborn by the fire
AND WHEN THE ASHES ARE FALLING
ON A DECEMBER MORNING
Let the sunlight rise again

WHEN THE PHOENIX IS GOING TO RISE
AND THE SUNLIGHT SHINES AGAIN
LET A FREEDOM CROSS THESE MINDS
WHEN THE PHOENIX IS GOING TO RISE
AND THE SUNLIGHT SHINES AGAIN

Thes was in 639
December the 7th
The end for the "kingdom of a thousand years"
Was sent out from heaven
There are too many souls who had lost their way
And many too many are passing by

When we're looking into the darkest of all
nights
There is something every time
But nothing will restrain - a tiny light from shining

WHEN THE PHOENIX IS GOING TO RISE
AND THE SUNLIGHT SHINES AGAIN
LET A FREEDOM CROSS THESE MINDS
WHEN THE PHOENIX IS GOING TO RISE
AND THE SUNLIGHT SHINES AGAIN
