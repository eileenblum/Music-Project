When a life falls into dust and the paradise is lost
There is something to remind us in our head
There is something to remember - helping us to understand

And the price we have to pay for a life we fade away
These are the words I hear somebody say
Is there anybody else - can find the end of days
Is there anybody else
IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE - CAN FIND THE END OF
THE END OF ALL DAYS - THE END OF ALL DAYS
IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE

On some ordinary day in the end of 1963
While a distant tune of spring lies in the air
We are waiting for the fall of lives an years

And the price we have to pay - for a life we fade away
These are the words I hear somebody say
Is there anybody else - can find the end of days
Is there anybody else
Is there anybody else - can find the end of days

Martha's vineyard near the bay, here we found another trace
Nothings plannes but just a curse or a spell on mothers earh
This line is defeated before we release it
When we see the command forces die
AND THE ECHO OF THE LAUGHTER
IS NOT SO FAR AWAY TO IGNORE THE CRIES
On this ordinary day
JFK has gone
And witnessed by a hundered million eyes
Who saw him fall - asking why
Hsi mantra was a paragram of KEN I DIE

AND THE PRICE WE HAVE TO PAY - FOR A LIFE FADING AWAY
Is there anybody else - can find the end of days
Is there anybody else
WE ARE THE REASON FOR - WE ARE THE FALLEN CHILDREN
The end of all days
