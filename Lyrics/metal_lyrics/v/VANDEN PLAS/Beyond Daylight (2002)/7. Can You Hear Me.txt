We had all the gods among us
For an endless summer long
Now i'm tired of it all
So why can't we leave it
We are dancing in the halls
To a sentimental waltz
What a scary situation
To see the icon fal

CAN YOU HEAR ME
CAN YOU HEAR ME CALLING
ARE YOU WAITING THERE FOR ME

You can heal with your embrace
I need something to amaze
Put a knife into my face
And that's what they told me
We are dancing in the halls
With my blood upon the walls
What a funny situation
These endless summer days

CAN YOU HEAR ME
CAN YOU HEAR ME CALLING
ARE YOU WAITING THERE FOR ME

CAN YOU HEAR ME
CAN YOU HEAR ME CALLING
WITH MY FALLING MEMORIES
