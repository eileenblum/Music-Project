never, never, never

Never turn around
on this lonely road
no one ever saw me standing in the shadows
I've had many names
and you have lost your way
I know you don't have the time but may I ask you to stay

Where are you going to
Where are you going to

Shine on the gods here in silence
mine is the shade one more time
I walk the night impaled by Cyrus
Under the moon I'll be by your side

hello, hello, hello

Hello mister, please
let me introduce myself
I'm a stranger and I present you my disease
older than the sun
and older than the lies
I'm a failure
I'm the door between Hello's and Goodbye's

Where are you going to
Where are you going to

Shine on the gods here in silence
mine is the shade one more time
I walk the night impaled by Cyrus
Under the moon I'll be by your side

My flower - how I adore the shine of thy life, that I have to destroy
You can't heal the yearning of that I am suffering
My angel - everyday a little more
