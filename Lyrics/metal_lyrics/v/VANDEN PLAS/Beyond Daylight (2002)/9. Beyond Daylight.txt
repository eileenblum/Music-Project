Sooner or later
You follow me into my world
There yonder the skies - somewhere

Sittinghere inside my cell
This is not a fairytale
What do you think I am
On which side do I depend
Scary monster - hollow man
Here is just an easy way in
There is just an easy way out

FOLLOW ME INTO MY WORLD
FOLLOW ME OVER AND UNDER THE SKIES
FOLLOW THE PILOT OF SOULS
SOONER OF LATER WE ARE BEYOND DAYLIGHT

I hear them coming down again
Another rope will tie my hand
They think I'm a liar, a cheating messiah
But hear my story 'til the end
Here is just an easy way in
There is just an easy way out

FOLLOW ME INTO MY WORLD
FOLLOW ME OVER AND UNDER THE SKIES
FOLLOW THE PILOT OF SOULS
SOONER OF LATER WE ARE BEYOND DAYLIGHT

If The Only Possibility Is To Be Excluded
Then The Impossible Must Be True
My name is killroy murdoch
Nobody believes my name
I was born as an endless circle
I'm born as and endless game

Ghost kings came over desert stone
To see where the salt lake lies
All the animals are minerals
Here in scarlet: petrified
God's second cast
Forgotten in the salt lake shore
But I will still remind you
In the oldest dreams to win the final war
I can see the day arrive
I can hear the morning birth
Even when you take my view
Steal my tongue
The serins will never fly aqay
And they are singing just for me
Cause I invented them for my story
And I never have to worry
On my private way to Golghata

Is where the story ends
Or where it just began
You're all a piece of paper
On the psycho pathway to the cross
You're my neighbour
In the story I invented?!

I cut a scar through my face with a knife
More than a withness when Kennedy died
Fused the absinth for charles baudelaire
I was fire, warer and air
Was a king long before Christ was born
Walk the night and I've never seen dawn
I can see where your wishes began
Now you wish you don't know who I am

FOLLOW ME INTO MY WORLD
FOLLOW ME OVER AND UNDER THE SKIES
FOLLOW THE PILOT OF SOULS
SOONER OF LATER WE ARE BEYOND DAYLIGHT

Follow me into my world
Follow me into my world
