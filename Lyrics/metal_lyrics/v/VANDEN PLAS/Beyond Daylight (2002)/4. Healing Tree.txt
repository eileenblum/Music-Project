Leaves are falling under my wings
I hear a young boy cry "Why my father, why my mom
How can I say goodbye"
It ain't easy to get by again
Maybe we are leaving from time to time again

Where we go around from here
Will we shed another tear
Like the seasons we are leaving to return again

Where we go around from here
Will we shed another tear
Like the seasons we are leaving to return again

For your mother - for your dad
Here is a secret door
I'm the tree of magic and consolation
For three thousand years or more
When my leaves are falling down again
You can meet them here from time to time again

Where we go around from here
Will we shed another tear
Like the seasons we are leaving to return again

Where we go around from here
Will we shed another tear
Like the seasons we are leaving to return again

It's the end of the seasons, all the people are leaving
There's no other way, no other way

Where we go around from here
Will we shed another tear
Like the seasons we are leaving
To return again

Where we go around from here
Will we shed anohter tear
Like the seasons we are leaving
To return again
