I see the storm is coming
From a hundred ten
Miles in a shade
And the rain keeps failing down
On a summer night parade
I'm asking
Who is gonna do this
Little girl o' mine
I'm not there
When she needed me to stay

I'm praying
Anytime and any day
I said lady
You gave your light away
Anytime and any day
The tears will fall
For my lady

He's a lonesome renegade
Nobody understands
But addicted from the lust
To take little girls
Again and again
Doctor can you tell me
Why you set him free
So he was there
When she needed me to stay

I'm praying
Anytime and any day
I said lady
You gave your light away
Anytime and any day
The tears will fall
For my lady

Who is gonna hold you
There in heaven
Who will wash away
All the tears
Who is there to tell you
When you're seven
Singing you a song
For your birthday
Do you love your mummy
And your daddy
Do you feel the hole
In our hearts
I know sometimes
My own love executes me
Someday I will drown
In my own tears

I'm praying
Anytime and any day
I said lady
You gave your light away
Anytime and any day
The tears will fall
For my lady
