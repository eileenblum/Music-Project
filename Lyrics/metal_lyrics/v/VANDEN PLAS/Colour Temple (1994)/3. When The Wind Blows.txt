After the curtain falling
Is the end
Hard to believe and not to cry
Words and feelings
Pouring over
My pain and my skin
But I don't want
To say goodbye
Ain't no coming back
This time
I can see it in my dreams

When the wind blows
Right into my face
When the wind blows
Into my face again

Back on the raging waters
Of the sea
Look for a harbour to sail in
Again the lies
Again the feelings
Again the mistakes
I'm waiting for the hurricane
And the tears that you taste
Believe me
And the fears that I have
Are the fears you deny
Sincerely

When the wind blows
Right into my face
When the wind blows
Into my face again

The storm is coming
The storm is breaking loose
