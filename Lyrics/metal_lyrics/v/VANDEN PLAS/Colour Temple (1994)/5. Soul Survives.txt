Mission of your life
Coming from the past
We can leave it all behind
Try to understand
What it's all about
We can't change it all
This time
Any point of view
Flowing down the line
We can't hear the world this time
This time
Mission of your life
We come along
We have to go
Takes a million years
For us to find a home
We never want

Passion to the pain
Do we need a savior
Need a savior
Pray for the light
Pray for the day
Pray for the illusion wishes fail
And nothing's sacred

Cross the water
Cross the bridge
One gross failure
A million years
The data bank won't forget

The soul survives
Visions closer
Visions closer

Written in a book
In a language
We don't know
Takes a million years
We never go
Passion to the pain
Do we need a savior
Need a savior

Pray for the son
Pray for the night
Pay for illusions just to buy
The prince of tides

Cross the water
Cross the bridge
Cross for the savior
A million tears
The data bank won't forget

The soul survives
Visions closer
Wishes closer

Round and round and
Round we go
When we're waiting
For the lord
And the ultimatum falls
When the unborn
Is not king again
Our calculation is false
When we're drifting
Day by day
To a point of no return
Then the prayer for
The light of day
Is written on your soul
Ten thousand years away.

The soul survives
Visions closer
Vicious closer

Round and round
And round we go
