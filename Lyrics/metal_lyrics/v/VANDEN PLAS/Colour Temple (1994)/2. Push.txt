Waiting on sacrifice
Sacred fires
Rushing with the wind
We are living in a
Dangerzone
Listen to a prayer machine
Praying a tainted precedent
Heart on the heart
We break the rules again
Just you and me
We're coming up or going down together

What d'you want from me
You can't find the key
What d'you want from me
Push your heart to pray

This world deaf and blind
Is a sign for the end of time
No one surrenders
No one surrenders
Heart on heart
We break the rules again
Skin on skin
The foreign blood
Feels like
My own deep river
What d'you want from me
Can you find the key
What d'you want from me
Push your heart to pray
