Where is your kingdom
Lord can you show me
The place
Can you tell me
Where all the tears
Are falling down
Just give me a sign
One good reason
That I'm living for
One sign one easy sign
There's no chance to
Hide away

Father father
Is there a way for me
Father father
Is there a candle
In the night
To show me the way

Give me absolution
For all the things
That I've done
Why you tell me
That all my prayers
Are falling down
Just give me a sign
One good reason
That I'm living for
One sign one easy sign
There's no chance to
Hide away

Father father
Is there a way for me
Father father
Is there a candle
In the night
To show me the way

Where is your kingdom
And where is your light
Your hand of creation
Can heal me inside
