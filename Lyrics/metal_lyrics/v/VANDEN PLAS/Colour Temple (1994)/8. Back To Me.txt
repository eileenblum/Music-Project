Here comes the jet airliner
The thing that breaks up apart
Breakin' rules
Play everybody's asshole
And let go sun go down
We march ahead
To the front line
There is no chance to deny
You have to leave
Like the others
To go and fight for a lie
And tears are falling
When this empty night
Is calling

And your tear falls in the
River touches the sea
Sea meets the stream
While angels sleep
Waters run in straight
From the river
To the sea
Back to me, back to me

They're marching
Into the desert
It's a killing joke
The drying out of the children
Is our shame for the love
Again the jet airliner
The thing that breaks up apart
You have to leave
Like the other boys brother
I don't wanna let you go
But tears are falling
When this empty night is calling

And your tear falls in the
River touches the sea
Sea meets the stream
While angels sleep
Waters run in straight
From the river
To the sea
Back to me, back to me
