Brother can you see
That the time's just begun
Brother can you see
That the time's moving on
Brother can you
Follow the light
Into a better place
Brother can you see
That your life's a disgrace
What's going on in your head
Something's driving you mad

How many tears
How many days
How many roads
How many tears
How many days
How many roads
How many lives we spend

Sister can't you see
That your life's just begun
Sister can you see
That your life's moving on
And don't you see
There is another way
To another place
For you and me sister
What's going on in your head
Something's driving you mad

How many tears
How many days
How many roads
Away from you
How many tears
How many days
How many roads
How many lives we spend
Away from you

I tell you brother
I tell you sister
You are miles away
From the truth
