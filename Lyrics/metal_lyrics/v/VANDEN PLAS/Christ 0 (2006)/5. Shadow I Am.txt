[Music: S. Lill / Lyrics: A. Kuntz]

The book of mankind's brain
Was written for a thousand times
And must be isolated seen
Research can not slip inside individuality
Or under neuropsychics seals

Now every storm that I breathe
And every curse I pray
Can make me see the night
And stronger every day

Shadow I am, and I ever will, and I ever will
Shadow I am in a world, in a land of shades
That forever rains the night on me

When the crows falling down in the neighborhood
Left no mark on the surface of dark

Then every storm that I breathe and every curse I pray
Can let me be the night and stronger every day

Shadow I am, and I ever will, and I ever will be
Shadow I am in my world, in the land of shades
That forever rain sundown on me

Not more than a gun to rule the world
Not more than a license for the fabric of my shade
Climbing out of torches - I left without a mark

Shadow I am, there's a chain reaction released
By the rebound of will and mind
Shadow in my neural world
This chain reaction's magnetism
Let's transform ourselves in each and any kind

Here's my cognition research
What is intelligence?
Shadows are human and not unable to think
