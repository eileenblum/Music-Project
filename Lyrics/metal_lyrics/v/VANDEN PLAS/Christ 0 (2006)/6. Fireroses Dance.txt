[Music: G. Werno / Lyrics: A. Kuntz]

One day, when the fires eat the lands
And the widows start to dance
Then it shows all the beauty
In just one day

Why is it ever too late and why, is it ever
Why is it ever too late and why, is it ever
Too late

See the beauty of the world
For a second just a glance
One day when the fire roses dance

One day when I am crying for this song
Now it's written to the end
I could save all their children
In just one day

Why is it ever too late
And why is it ever too late

See the beauty of the world
In a clear vermilion sky
One day feels like indian summer
Lose the beauty of the world
So in common with the dying
One day
When the flame of innocence
Lets the fire roses dance

Missa ignis, missa ultoris
Missa presteris et saltatus

See the beauty of the world
In a clear vermilion sky
One day, one day

Plant the trees to cut them down
Burn my city to the ground
Count seconds - steal the time
Waste your words to build a rhyme
For all holes in me to fill
I need the newborn lives to...
Pray my true amens
After fire roses dance
