[Music: G. Werno &amp; A. Kuntz / Lyrics: A. Kuntz]

Come little angel and sit by my side
I need someone to talk to
'cause I can't see the light
I look for a guardian "take my thousand sins away"
Are the last lines before he decides to pray again

Here is x... friday dec. 13, 7:25 babylonian time
My brain works faster than the day before
And when I shut one door I hear another open
All his trust, faith and belief has gone
After the minute they've prserved him from the dawn
And I wonder, and I wonder
How a place could leave his mind alone with me

An eerie mural makes me see
His sieve of broken memories
I'm coming near but not enough
Disclosing your illusion

Why is the world so afraid
Searching for a way to january sun, january sun
And why can the last december days
Not remember where to go... january sun

His nether world is more dimensional
And now I could inhale his frenzied wintertale
A brand new being rises out of black snow
This ship of dark decades
Can tell me where I go
To remember and I remember
When I close my eyes the angel says to me

Confess your sins and take my hand
I give you back your memory
The time has come to see a land
Of reverse allegory tales
And the end of a rainbow on your journey
To a place you meet yourself
And searching for a pharos glowing
Why in the world is it me
Searching for the way to january sun

X - 7:35 - now I'm zero
Here I something to believe in
On our way let us turn into the january sun
Hostimentum - dominatio
I am nothing but a sand grain
In a gear of the universe - equation of the tide

Amnestia - mors christ-0
Why, why is the gift to be free this new identity

Christ-0 - christ-0 - christ-0 - christ-0

Come little angel and sit by my side
I need someone to talk to
Now I can see the light
My life is a station
Where the darkness meets the day
Hear the last lines before I design to fade away
