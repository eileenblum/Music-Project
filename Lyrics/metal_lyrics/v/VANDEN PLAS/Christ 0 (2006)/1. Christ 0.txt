[Music: G. Werno / Lyrics: A. Kuntz]

Here I stand alone, I'm a sacrifice
Like a fallen angel, die here without your love
Now I understand, let the sentenced dog I'm in
Swallow all the hate I can eat

...gave you my heart gave you my heart
I just gave you my heart and
They take it away take it away
Now I gather somebodies elses' lives
Till the day we'll meet again

You are the reason why my day of living
I gave you my soul away to the unforgiven

Sucide would save me from my thoughts
I'll try now to freeze on these walls here
My uncertain eternity
In broken words
Said from the other part of me

Give me your heart give me your soul
Can you give me your life then
I take it away break it in two and
Dancing in enemy elses' blood
Pouring down on me like rain

They are the reason for my day of living
I gave my soul away to the unforgiven

Ghost ship * dezember 11
2:00 am * my name x

You are my death part 1
The new edition is called my life part 2

You are the reason why my day of living
I know I know we'll meet again
On the fifth of seasons

I'm alive christ-0
See the light - christ-0 - I'm alive
