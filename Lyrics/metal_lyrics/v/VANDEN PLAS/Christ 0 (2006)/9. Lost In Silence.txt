[Music: A. Kuntz / Lyrics: A. Kuntz]

Cold wind is leading my soul to the border
Nothing will dry all your tears
I built in their crying a city of water
Drown in my new hydrosphere

Oceans you cry, oceans you cry
Please can you cry me away
Patiently waiting to fade out my life
Something is calling my name and says

Hey come into the day where we're lost in silence
Hey come into the day and be lost in silence

How can I say to the sons of your children
Here in my last summary
What is the system of building a monster
In my case love was the key

Ashes I cry, oceans I dye
Leave on a withering day
Why don't you come here and stay for awhile
I hear the ferryman say
"Come sail away with me"

Come into the day where we're lost in silence
Hey come into the day and be lost in silence
Hey come into the day where we're lost in silence
Hey come into the day and be lost in silence

Silence, silence, silence
