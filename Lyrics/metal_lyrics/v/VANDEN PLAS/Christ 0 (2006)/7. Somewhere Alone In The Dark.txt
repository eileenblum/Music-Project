[Music: S. Lill / Lyrics: A. Kuntz]

Talk to me, I am here to say farewell my son
Now talk to me, I'm your season running out
I offer my equations
For everything you stole#
And I claim now my expenses
I'm your private "vertigo"

You don't breathe anymore
When I walk out the door
Something older than love
Waiting right in the line of the storm

Somewhere alone in the dark
A phantom from the arc
Somewhere alone in the night
Is counting all broken lives

Talk to me, my face had left a scar
Inside your memory, now I see it in your eyes
Aren't you dying to forget me
Call me wizard of your oz
Since you raised my deus machina
I'm in a godless rush

You don't breathe anymore
When I walk out the door
Something older than love
Lays you down in the line of the storm

And after a long time in nowhere
Five thousand and nineteen days
You pay the account for my kingdom
The rent for a spider's home

For the love of my life
I return in the night from the eye of the storm
And I'm willing your life to transform

Somewhere alone in the dark
The ghosts of dumas acting alone in the night
His legend of taking lives
