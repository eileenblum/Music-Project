[Music: G. Werno / Lyrics: A. Kuntz]

I'm a wanderer and I wear the mask of mystery
From a prisoner waiting for the last request
When I got the will, then I got the chance;
He said: certain mistakes of my fiends
Make the wish fulfilled

Now - that - I - see - I - can - be - free
I - will - give - y o u - all my pain

And I wish you where here
I wish you fear - I wish you well
And that you're burning there
In hell instead of me

And I wish you where here I wish you amen
I cause your all-inclusive pain

All the walls inside try to speak with me
Beautify this spider's home
Help the fly to rest in peace

Then I read a plan - kind of bleeding tattoo
Out of words of a murderer
"like pearls of insane dew"

How can I see what he told me
I try to listen to his pain and I

Wish you where here
I wish you're near me I wish you well
And that you're turning this my hell into a fane
And I wish you where here
Now I cut out my brain
Before I'll try to understand - what you mean

And I follow all the traces
To your long forgotten places
In a ghost ship down the sea to holy island
Waits homicide for me... like on morphine
I see all the eyeshots he had
On his long requiem to the end

Why should I see what he wrote there for me
In his message I hear poor victims plea:
I wish you where here
I wish you well and that you're burning
Here in hell instead of me
And I wish you where here
So give me all your prayers
For the sins I have to pay

I work for I.C.P.O. (interpol)
And some details show me
Not the "plain type"
Not the "gain type" of serial assassin
He's not motivated by hedonism
Untypical - no gilles de rais,
No bathory, not jack, so I got the suspicion
He's a man with a clear sagacious mission
