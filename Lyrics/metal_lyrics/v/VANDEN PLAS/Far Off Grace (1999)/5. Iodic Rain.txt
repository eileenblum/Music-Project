[Music: S.Lill / Lyrics: A. Kuntz]

A shattered lamp imbrues the night
projecting sharp figures in his face
ten thousand days to paint your wings
and rise with the phoenix for a day

I know that you will betray yourself
to some things
we'll never get closer to
I know that we always surrender
I know that we must be aware

the scissors cut a shape of a man
betrays jaring sciences he rose
magnetic suns and star machines
to yield the submission of the gods
I know that you will betray yourself
to some things
we'll never get closer to

why do you thing we have all the rights
to unite all the sciences we should
not compare

you're loosing everything
nothings about to heal you
you fly into the unforgiven sunlight
to heal your pain
pour down Iodic rain

I know that we always surrender
I know that must be aware
you turn the pinions down
fly to the stars around

you're loosing everyting
nothings about to heal you
you're loosing everyone
that ever tried to heal you
you fly into the unforgiven sunlight
to heal your pain
pour down Iodic rain
