[Bonus Track]
[Dokken cover]

A brief encounter
Like wind through the trees
It came so suddenly
But then it was gone
Like it had never been
How could I have ever seen
A lost heart
Will take your soul

How could I have known
How could I have known
As she took me in her arms
And brought me to an end
With the kiss of death
The kiss of death

She promised paradise
As she lied upon her bed
Like a fallen angel
With the devil's charm
She promised paradise
With the kiss of death

I tried to stop
As she held out her hand
But the fire was burning inside
She knew what i wanted
She gave it and more
But now I must pay the price
We were strangers
Passing in the night

How could I have known
How could I have known
As she took me in her arms
And brought me to an end
With the kiss of death
The kiss of death

She promised paradise
As she lied upon her bed
Like a fallen angel
With the devil's charm
She promised paradise
With the kiss of death

As she took me in her arms
I felt the devil's charm
Suddenly I see
The final destiny
With the kiss of death
The kiss of death

She promised paradise
As she lied upon her bed
Like a fallen angel
With the devil's charm
She promised paradise
With the kiss of death

With the kiss of death
