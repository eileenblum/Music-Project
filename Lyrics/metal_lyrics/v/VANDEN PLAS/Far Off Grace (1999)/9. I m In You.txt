[Music: S.Lill / Lyrics: A. Kuntz]

Why are you calling
we have to hide this time
while you adjure the secret winds
can you imagine
now we are coming back
to free the things
that follow our chain

let it shine let it light the way
let it shine the way
down a million lives go

can you believe the things I do
can you believe that I'm in you
can you believe the sun
can you believe the rain
can you believe the same way too
then I'm in you

why are we changing
on our endless road
how can we wear this ring of fate
all that we're searching for
is the kabbala
and this one collective soul
we need to know

let it shine
let it light the way
let it shine
a hundred million lives ago

can you believe the things I do
can you believe that I'm in you
can you believe the sun
can you believe the rain
can you believe the same way too
then I'm in you

one collective soul we need to know
