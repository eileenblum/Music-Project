[Music : S.Lill / Lyrics : A.Kuntz]

We live in a world today
to burn our sun away
free all the ghosts
enslaving our rainbow
how can we lay
a part of a scientific frame
found a gathering the sea of games
yearning to see in what you believe
they want to know words to combine
clean our minds - detune our waves
and write us a chip inside

Inside of your head
Inside of your mind - Inside of me

beware of the morning side
the key to a system on the line
we are divine - parapoetic symbol
password defined
we are the gods
of the stages we've loaded

they take you away
all of your dreams
spread our will
rase our seals
paint us a new crack in the sky
blind us to analyse your mind

Inside of your head
Inside of your mind - Inside of me

the parapoetic symbol
a bridge to the other side
where we are the gods of pages we raise
