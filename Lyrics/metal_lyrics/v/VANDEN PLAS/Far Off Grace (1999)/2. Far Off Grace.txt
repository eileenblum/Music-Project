[Music: S. Lill / Lyrics: A. Kuntz]

On the way you start to go
where the morning meets the light
all the reasons washed ashore
to foreign lands
where you want to go
where you want to rise
innovation see the coexistent world

now you are sailing
to the edge yonder the waves
to the place he'd left behind
and you're speaking
to the voices of the sea
why he had to leave
still you have to stay

what do you know
where do we go
we are born to stay
here far off grace

and a crayfish is the lord
of the characters I meet
in the deep and healing oceans
so divine
all the essences I face
they were singing me the song
about the meaning
and the reasons that he's gone

full of wisdom are the images they told
and salvation saves the soul
everyday we are searching
for this foreign place
where I have to go
and where you want to stay

what do you know
where do we go
we are born to stay
here far off grace

waiting for the dawn
morning meets the light
whas me to the shore
into a land I left behind
sailing to the edge
leaving with the tide
searching for a place
where you will never be left alone
hear the serenade
makes you understand
why you had to stay and I fade away
