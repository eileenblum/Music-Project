[Music: A. Kuntz, G. Werno / Lyrics: A.Kuntz]

I can't cry away all the tears
I can't lie away all the fears
I have inside
all my sails are torn by the wind

the scars that you incise
will never go away

I don't miss you
I don't even love you
I want you to die in my arms

I'm a storm the air that you breath
learn to fly away
on the wings you wear inside
you see me dying down in the fields
the way over the bridge

a fire guides the way
and winds that let you soar
will blow away my flame

I don't miss you
I don't even love you
I want you to die in my arms

I don't miss you
I don't even love you
I wish you would die in my arms

I don't love you
I don't hear you
I won't cry for you

I don't miss you
