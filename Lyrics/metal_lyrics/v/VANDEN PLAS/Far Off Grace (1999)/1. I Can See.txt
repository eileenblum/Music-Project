[Music : S.Lill/ Lyrics: A. Kuntz]

The voices of the nature
the voices of a beast
the voices of the children
are the voices of a priest

this can all belong together
these are fragments of the one
and then soon will fuse forever
sentenced to creation

better if you hear me
better when you care
better when you listen
are we all aware

I  can see
where all soon will be
I'll be there and I know
where we all have to go

in poems of the martyr
the childhood of a thought
for freedom of a nation
all these things out of a part

dark essential dreams of jesters
feed my ideology
cause when all belongs together
then it all belongs to me

better if you hear me
better when you care
better when you listen
I can be aware

I can see
where we all soon will be
I'll be there and I know
where we all have to go
