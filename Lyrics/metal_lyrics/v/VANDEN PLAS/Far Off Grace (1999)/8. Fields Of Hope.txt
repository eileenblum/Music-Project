[Music : G. Werno, S.Lill / Lyrics: A. Kuntz]

Better wash away
land into the sea
when faith is broken
all the barricades
a potion for the waves
let us feed the flood

I know there's a way
I can see visions and dreams
I know there's a way
I can delineate any new empire
the colors I'm crying to secrets
they're drying
and now that I see
the fields of hope
descended from the tears
they always show
the meadows of the seers

none of the shields will hold me
never swords will break me
I create another world on the other side
to show you the way
to lands of visions and dreams
I show you the way
welcome to the dominion
of coloured fields
the colors I'm crying
to secrets they're drying
and now that I see
the fields of hope
descended from the tears
they always show the meadow
of the seers

I can be the hand
a medium to scan any mind delusion
I am just a passenger in a patient flood
on my paper walls
old pigmentations of dreams
and my feather will
delineate any new empire
the fields of hope are painted
by the tears
they always show the garden
of the seers
