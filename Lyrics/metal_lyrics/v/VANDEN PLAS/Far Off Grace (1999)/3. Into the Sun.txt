[Music: G.Werno / Lyrics: A.Kuntz]

Walking  - dreaming - flying
over patterns of time
searching - lying - burning
for a paper of ancient signs
of the script from a stranger
had a long tercentennial delay
the novels he wrote
are a treasure
a meander down from the dark

into the sun
we are falling from the silence
into the sun
we are waiting for illumination

the deeper you come to the inside
words built up a new universe
imagine these rhymes
are the key to a door
each term is a pathway
erased in the end without you

walking - flying - searching
inside of these lines
dreaming - burning - lying
for a paper of signs

into the sun
we are falling from the silence
into the sun
we are waiting for illumination

a view to the source of the mission
we read is AcCult
to the fiction of dreams
the runes of a pagan deceit
will guide you to mandala cages
on the spiral inside

into the sun
we are falling from the silence
into the sun
where we all are leaving
