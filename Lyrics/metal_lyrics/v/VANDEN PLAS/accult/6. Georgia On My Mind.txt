[Ray Charles cover]

Georgia, Georgia, the whole day through
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind
Georgia, Georgia, a song of you
Comes sweet and clear as moonlight through the pines

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you

Georgia, Georgia, no peace I find
Just and old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind

Georgia, Georgia, no peace I find
Just and old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind
Just and old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind
On my mind...
