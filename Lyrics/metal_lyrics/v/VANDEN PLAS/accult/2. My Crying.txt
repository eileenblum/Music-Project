Here's the grand illusion
Superstitious man
I can see how it all began
A pocket full of dreams
And a story backwards told
We dream it all in vain
Holding on, holding on
This is my final warning
Here is my news today

This is my crying
For these good old bad days
Kings and queens
And presidents
This is my world
This is my crying
For these good old bad days
Give her away, taking it down
To the poisoned water
This is my world
This is my world

Where's the grand solution
Unimortal world
Any fool can rule the land
When everything has changed
And the dog spelled
Backwards god
Infected till the end
Holding on, holding on
This is my final warning
Here's my news today

This is my crying
For these good old bad days
Kings and queens
And presidents
This is my world
This is my crying
For these good old bad days
Give her away, taking it down
To the poisoned water
