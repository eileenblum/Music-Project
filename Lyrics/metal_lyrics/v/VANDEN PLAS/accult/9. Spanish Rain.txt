I recall the place, the way you moved
Your angel face
You came to rest your weary soul
Spend some time
Drink some wine
With me

Ah, me...

We defined romance, the way we danced
Your beauty stopped time
We spent a night in Spanish rain

I felt no pain
And your were mine

All mine

We lay down, and barely made a sound
The warm breeze spoke your name
The love we made never was
Again

Soon came the sun, the morning heat
Rivaled by none
You were gone
Without a trace
All alone inside my home
Without you

Ah, you...

I searched the land, never finding
That one girls hand
We spent a night in Spanish rain
Nothing more
I'll never be the same
