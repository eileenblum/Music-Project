Over mysterious seas, a thousand miles on the waves
There's a cry of the children deep in the night
My inner voice like the storm I can hear so much louder today
In a city of death, I see souls passing by
I'm living my life here on the border
I'm living my life here on the edge

Then someone calls my name
A soul alliance
I'm leaving with the wind

Over mysterious waters to the delta of fears
From the valley of doom to the old lost world's bay
Because this tastes of hazard, I know it's as clear as the day
Sensing all the scars on our souls we acquired in these frays
I follow the line down to the border
The circle of life, it's a circle of blood

Then someone calls my name
A soul alliance
I'm leaving with the wind
Then someone calls my name
A soul alliance
I'm leaving with the wind

Stay and hold me
âtil I'm not afraid anymore
Pray with me and tell me that we're going home
is what I hear them say
What have we done?
What have we done?

How will it end when gods play at vanity dice,
and they're playing games at the cost of an innocent child?
Nothing's safe anymore
Blood is running down
in these streets of sacrifice

Then someone calls my name
A soul alliance
I'm leaving with the wind
A freedom warrior
A freedom warrior
A freedom warrior
