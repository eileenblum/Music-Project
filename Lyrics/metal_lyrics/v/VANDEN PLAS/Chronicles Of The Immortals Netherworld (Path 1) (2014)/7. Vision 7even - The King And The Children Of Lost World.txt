I know someone will arrive today to release your pain
And all your agonizing wait is coming to a joyful end
In these backstreets of the harbor known as yard of Hell,
I hear freedom calling in the sound of chiming bells

We are the children of lost world
Fenced in the subsoils of light
We are the children of lost world
Awaiting our savior's arrival tonight

And we'll be freed from our Anathema
within the healing flames
No more lying, no more stealing
No more fierce and savage games
Let us sing hail to the Lord who helps us free ourselves
Flames are sanitizing lost world on the stroke of 12

We are the children of lost world
Fenced in the subsoils of light
We are the children of lost world
Awaiting the savior's arrival tonight

Don't believe these many words of a great pretender
He's the one who did encage you here for more than a hundred years
Be forevermore his cattle if you will not flee
You will be free - come with me

I've heard a song in my dreams
It's a song for the brave
And the song gave us back our childhood days
Then weâre falling in arms
of our beloved next of kin
And they wash away all our dire sins

Our mothers, our fathers
They came to dance away our fears
Your mothers, your fathers
They came to dance away our fears
To hold you and save us now

There's a comedy of intrigues for the masterminds
More a high pretentious chess game than the great divine

We are the children of lost world
Fenced in the subsoils of light
We are the children of lost world
Awaiting the savior's arrival tonight
