I am the son of a legend and reborn to kill
This is the time, this is the place
Like noxious slivers your eyes, but I'm holding the gaze
You will not break me, you will not erase me

I am here to take your life today
I'll see you in Heaven
I'll see you in Hell
If this is the end before it begins,
then we'll meet again

Ten thousand moons were my candles through all of these nights
Thirsting for vengeance puked out the black knight
Hundreds of thousands I've murdered without any thrill
What's your arcanum for breaking my will?

I am here to take your life today
I'll see you in Heaven
I'll see you in Hell
If this is the end before it begins,
then we'll meet again

This is a sword
forged by a god
With a steel so divine older than time
A heavenly blade
So much colder than ice
With the wisdom to find the end of a bloodline

When you're dying here on Judgment Day,
it's the day of sweet revenge
All the children dancing on their graves, singing
âDeath is beautiful - death is so beautifulâ

I'll see you in Heaven
I'll see you in Hell
If this is the end before it begins,
then we'll meet again
If this is the end before it begins,
then we'll meet again

(I am a monster - I am a saint)
(I am a monster - I am a vampyre)
