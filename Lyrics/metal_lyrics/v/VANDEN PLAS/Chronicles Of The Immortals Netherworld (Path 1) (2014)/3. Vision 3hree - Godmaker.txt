Now hear a tale from the dark
Claws from the blackness will wrest you
So there is no need to pray
I came to make you a god today

Stay by my side, my adored one
Your wish will be my command
I'll take you there to the kingdom of gods
And soon you will see promised land

Me, I'll bring you to the place
where a new world's arising

From the shambles going to eternal light
We are there before the hands show midnight
We came here to build a new empire
Together we will set the skies on fire

Come with me now my adored one
Stay with me here âtil the end
Blood sealed our word - sempiternal
And weak triune gods, they must fall

Coming closer to the place
where a new world's arising

From the shambles going to eternal light
We are there before the hands show midnight
Reaching Asgard led by angel's choir
Together we can set the skies on fire

With you I will set the skies on fire
We came here to build a new empire
Flee forever from the undertaker
You are salvaged from the godhead maker

Follow me or stay and die here
Follow me or stay and die with her
