Giants building us
Separate universes
Where we spin alone round and round
Like gyrating suns
Waiting for the day
To illuminate separate lives
Behind a planet called purpose
That's pouring its shadow on me
Healing my vulnerable surface

Another few hundred years went by
I've been waiting for you
I've been waiting for so long

I will be the sweetest dew
Carried by the morning light over killing fields
I'm beside you
Still we are filled with reliance
By way of longest farewells
God will adjust bitter fortune
And we try as the years go by

I've been waiting for you
I've been waiting for so long
I've been waiting for you
I've been waiting for so long

Stay for a day, for a while, for a minute by my side
For a second in my life
Stay for a day, for a while, for the magic of your smile
In this misery affection
