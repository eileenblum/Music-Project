Is this the end,
or just a new life's beginning?
I'm an alien god
Just fallen from grace
Is this the end?

This must be the place
where time starts and time is ending
The creation of gods
The deceit from a liar
I'm a brand new vampyre

And then I'm falling right out of the sky
Only once in a lifetime
This time searching the souls God cannot save
While I'm falling from grace

See me running, see me flying
See me falling, see me dying
I'm a haunter, I'm a fighter, a mutation
Like an animal immane creation

Then I'm falling right out of the sky
Only once in a lifetime
This time I'm searching the souls God cannot save
When I'm falling from grace
[2x]
