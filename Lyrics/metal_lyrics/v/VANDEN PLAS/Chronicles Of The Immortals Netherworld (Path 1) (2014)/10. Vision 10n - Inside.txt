I can't live - I can't die
I am dead - but alive
Something's losing the seals
from the box with my feelings

Something's creeping there behind the rows
And it's waiting outside for the someone in you
With the will to forgive
Then it kills to live

Inside I am leaving
Inside I am searching for
Inside there's a reason
In our heart, in our mind, in the lair of my soul inside
Inside

I'm alone, standing here
with my hate and my fears
Grace is calling my name,
but still calling me in vain

For the creeper's always at the door
So I dance on the wave on the crest of my hate
And my paper boat's wolfed by this waterfall

Inside I am leaving
Inside I am searching for
Inside there's a reason
In our heart, in our mind, in the lair of my soul inside

Tell me the sense of a life where we always return
Sometimes in life I've seen the end of the rainbow
Caught in the dark side of life, never finding my way
There is no guide straight to the end of the rainbow
