You can be the sun
To form the course of every day, my friend
And the moon to make your tides
When all the winds deny your sails

Come with me, my friend
Stay by my side
I can still lay you down in the fields of God
Stay with me, my friend
Breathe in the light
And fly on ethereal wings into the night

Search for the limits of dreams
Stay by my side

Iâm waiting on the borderline
Just lay your hand in mine
On a night like this
On a night like this
Itâs better you just close your eyes
And leave it all behind
On a night like this
On a night like this

Youâll be a swayer, not a blasphemous lord
Nor a sweet something of a weakened triune god
You drank from the night, my friend
Now sip the dew of almight
A sweet tonic of the sanctuary light

This is my final warning
Why donât you listen to me?
Iâm the power to set you free
Or let you get lost in purgatory

Iâm waiting on the borderline
Just lay your hand in mine
On a night like this
On a night like this
Forever I will close her eyes
And leave you with the pain
On a night like this
On a night like this
A night like thisâ¦

Iâm waiting on the borderline
Just lay your hand in mine
On a night like this
On a night like this
Itâs better you just close your eyes
And leave it all behind
On a night like this
On a night like this
A night like thisâ¦
