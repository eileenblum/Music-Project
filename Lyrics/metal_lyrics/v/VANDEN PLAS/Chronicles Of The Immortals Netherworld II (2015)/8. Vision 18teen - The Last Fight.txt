Is this steel of Odin strong enough to steep my candle?
Did you come here to put out at last my flame?
Iâm the one and only tearing down the worlds of mayhem
Itâs the first time that a dead man wins the game

Sooner or later we open our eyes
Fortunate that we were blind
Sooner or later weâre crying for love
Loveâs at the end of the line

After all the daemons Iâve faced in this purgatory
On my private way to heaven, hell and back
Sought for my beloved ones that I never dared to find here
Hereâs the dark godâs final murderous attack

Iâm searching for the one â still Iâm searching

Sooner or later we open our eyes
Fortunate that we were blind
Sooner or later weâre crying for love
Loveâs at the end of the line
So this dying extinguishes our bloodline
No chance of hiding the look in your eyes
Which says you will kill me this time

Die here â you will die here
You will die here â you will die here
Die here â you will die here
You will die here â you will die here
You will die

Sanctuary â sanctimony
Iâm searching for the one â still Iâm searching

Sooner or later we open our eyes
Fortunate that we were blind
Sooner or later weâre crying for love
Loveâs at the end of the line
So much dying extinguishes our bloodline
No chance of hiding the look in your eyes
Which says you will kill me this time
