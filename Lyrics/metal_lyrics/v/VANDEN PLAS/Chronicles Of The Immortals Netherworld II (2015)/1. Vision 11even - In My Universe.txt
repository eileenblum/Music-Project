Welcome, my son, to my kingdom of death
Welcome, my son, to where the wine is blood
Welcome, my son, to your final solemnity
Welcome, my son, to the end

All the people say it is dangerous
Searching Orpheus hideaways
Thatâs a funny lie â Those who could know about that
Cannot tell âcause theyâve died here

In my universe
Where the wine is blood
And youâll spin with the spider
Iâm your dancing dead
Burn your bridges down
In my land of no return

You maybe ask what had opened up the door
A king of generic form called nemuritor
First Iâll bring you the gift of sweet sins you will inhale
Then will show you around in my garden of pales

Te salut, my friend, in my house of fears
Where the blood rains a river
Thanatophoric is my second name
Itâs a shame you came sleepwalking in here

Where the wine is blood
And youâll spin with the spider
Iâm your dancing dead
Burn your bridges down
In my land of no return

Hereâs the palerâs invitation
To your farewell consecration
Or another explanation
Blood donation
Iâm a sinner â Iâm a winner
A degenerated skinner
I will drink your blood for dinner
Youâre an absolute beginner
Iâm a gamer â an insaner
Iâm the lonesome entertainer
In the god of Transylvaniaâs
Bloody mania
I will eat your flesh â I will drink your blood
Iâm the tainted fleck in your neighborhood
And the sirens tell from a night in hell
Hear the requiem from the nightingales
Call me lunatic â kind of anemic
I will drive you sick with this hecksus stick
Hear my poem six â itâs my latest trick
Turn off the sunlight on the other side

Where the wine is blood
And youâll spin with the spider
Iâm your dancing dead
Burn your bridges down
In my land of no return
