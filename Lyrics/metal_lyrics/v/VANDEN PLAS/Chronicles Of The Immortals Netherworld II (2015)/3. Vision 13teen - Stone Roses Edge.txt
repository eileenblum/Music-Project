See all the restless souls on a secret mission
Troopers with impure hearts â ungodly editions

Iâm the architect of gods
Sent a thousand eerie fictions
My creation is a pantheon in the house of Sheol
This heretic place of might
Can fulfill the new predictions
I will start the apotheosis tonight

Midway through the dark
Youâre sentenced to die
If youâll not fulfill divine

Bring the light
From the stairway under the sun
Freyr
Thereâs a place where souls getting lost
At the edge of the world

Down a shaft below the streets
In the abyss of the twilight
Lies a place where all the roses turn to stone
Upstream on Elivagar
Where the hourglass was flooded
You can find a pier and open up the gates

So free them now
But soon to return
To save them all love must burn

Bring the light
From the stairway under the sun
Freyr
Thereâs a place where you can be God
Called stone roses edge

Mementos reloading your brain
All seaways there look the same
For a few silverpieces you can buy the end

So save all your victims
Kill all the saints
And burn down their promised land

Bring the light
From the stairway under the sun
Freyr
Can you save them today?
Light
From the stairway under the sun
Freyr â Find a way
Thereâs a place where you can be God
At stone roses edge
