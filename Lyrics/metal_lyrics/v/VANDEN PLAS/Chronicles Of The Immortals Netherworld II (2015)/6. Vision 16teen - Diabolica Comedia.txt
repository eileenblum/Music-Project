Midway into the dark
Straight forward pathway had been lost
I thought I had to find the cipher
Of Danteâs Comedy Divine
Else do I have to say
Speak will I of the other things
This way to paradise is paved
With my monsters and stoned with their cries
Finally come to an end
Over and over and over
Over and over again

This is the day weâve hailed for such a long time
Death in Venice so sweet
Sweet as the end

Once I was hunting for Athanasia
With a grim sardonic end
In Circle 9 thereâs a stairway to light
My son is the key to eternal salvation
Here it starts and here it ends
Over and over and over
Over and over again

This is the day weâve hailed for such a long time
Death in Venice so sweet
Sweet as the end

Precious allegories
Of a death in Venice
Where the gondolas float bejeweled
Dressed in mourning

[2x]
This is the day weâve hailed for such a long time
Death in Venice so sweet
Sweet as the end
