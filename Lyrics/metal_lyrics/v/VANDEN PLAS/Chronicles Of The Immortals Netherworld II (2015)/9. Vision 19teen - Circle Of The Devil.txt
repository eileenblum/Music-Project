Is this the end?
Or is this the first breath of new morning?
After Iâve died â Iâve died here alone
But still there was hope
Even in the darkest hours
All the lost souls finally get home
Once was a god â before I went
From the pantheon through the gates and back from hell
Was ready to break â ready to lose humanity
On my way to find my son â my lose â my life â find myself

On that day of tears and mourning
From the ashes shall arise
Spare us by your mercy, my Lord
Grant them all eternal rest

Here we are the kings â queens of sadness
Here we are the praise of gods
Here we are the pawns of heaven
Scared away from the fields of the Lord
Here we are the saints of lost world
Here we are the renegades
Waiting here to heal our savior
Who is coming to save the world

We are â We are standing in the circle of the devil
We are â We are standing in the circle of the devil
We are â We are standing in the circle of the devil
We are â We are standing in the circle of the devil

We are marching on and on in the storm and the rain
Searching for a better world to release all the pain
And weâre marching on and on through the doorways of hell
Waiting for a hundred years for the toll of the bell
Searching for the mystery in the power of greed
Gods are our enemies and theyâre sowing the seed
They are changing history, nothing will be the same
And weâre trying to survive while weâre playing their game

We are marching on and on in the storm and the rain
(On and on and on)
Searching for a better world to release all the pain
(On and on and on and on)
And weâre marching on and on through the doorways of hell
Waiting for a hundred years for the toll of the bell
(On and on and on and on - On and on and on and on)
(On and on and on and on - On and on and on and on)

So this is the night
Loveâs shining bright
We are forever burning eternal lights
Loveâs on the way to eternal light

So this is the night
Loveâs shining bright
Loveâs on the way to eternal light

Eternal light
Eternal light
Eternal light
