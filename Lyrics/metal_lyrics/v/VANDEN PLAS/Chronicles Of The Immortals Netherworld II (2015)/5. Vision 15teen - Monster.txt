Thereâs something I need to know
Show me the source of my soul
The devilâs mirror from another universe
Can prove the innocence within all mankindâs soul
So tell me what I need to know

Are you a monster? Are you a saint?
Some kind of vampyre?

Monster!
Monster!

Please, mirror, tell me a lie
You will have no second try
My only hope that youâre not telling me the truth
Or all will end up in tears
The devilâs hungry and he wants to let it end
Heâs waiting to suck out my soul right here

Are you a monster? Are you a saint?
Some kind of vampyre?

[3x]
Monster!
Monster!

Thereâs a fleck on my soul and it forces me to lie
Somethingâs inside of me that I cannot deny
Iâm not pure in my heart, but there is something I know
Iâm trespassing the netherworlds just to find love
My true love and my son I once buried alive
Any price I would pay
To meet you â to meet you again

I am a monster â Iâm not a saint
Some kind of vampyre

Monster!
Monster!
In the subfloors of my soul
Are no lies nor cheat or fraud
Monster!
Monster!
