God, why canât we see
Lost souls trapped on long forgotten seas?
All alone â sailing far behind the worlds
Here is hope if we call them now with a common prayer

Where? Where have the children gone?
And where? Where is the light?
Timeâs running fast 
Running out someday

Where theyâve gone astray
They may find their long forgotten way
Here is hope â hunters there between the worlds
And I know we can free them now with a common prayer

Where? Where have the children gone?
And where? Where is the light?
Where? Where are the children now?
Somewhere behind the tide
As long as we donât reflect our soul
Timeâs running out someday

Once an impure mighty god
Made two different worlds collide here
Rave a titanâs monster ball
Hear the thunder, see the lightning
So this is the point, this is the day
Times had slipped into each other
This power of doom so mad and ferine
Could break the continuum borderline

Where? Where have the children gone?
And where? Where is the light?
Where? Where are the children now?
Somewhere behind the tide
Our final chance is here and now
Letâs pray the mantra â warriors of soul
