In a wasp tower station
Errant souls lose their way
"Labyrinthian Absorptions"
They must stay here forever
In their own prophecies
Of a cutthroat assassin
Tempting nocturnes on the walls
Turbid idols we adore
All distempers draw one scene
With a cross upon the hill
What a beautiful nightmare

Then I hear the rush of silence
And I know that I must Save the world tonight
I fall into the rush of silence
Where are you
Let me save you now
Before you have to die

With my old cosmic wind mill
A fourdimensional tube
I've erased all the timesteps
I can't live without loving
In my new yesterdays
I will die here forever

No. I know I must be strong
I have waited much too long
Anyone can save the world
Anyone can - Anyone can
Here's for the first time
My last time
Fall into the rush of silence
And I know I have to
Save the world tonight
Fall into the rush of silence
Where are you
Let me save you now
Before you have to die

I fall into the rush of silence
And I know that I will
Save the world tonight
Fall into the rush of silence
Where are you
Let me kill you now
Before you have to die
