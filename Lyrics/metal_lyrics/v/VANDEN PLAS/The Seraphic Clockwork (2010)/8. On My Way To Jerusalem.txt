I am just a detail falling right out of the sky
I am a piece of nothing and my soul can never die
That's the reason why I came back today
To effect the ancient prophecy
My time levitation was the key
One step into nowhere to see
And finding sketches of Gethsemane here in sundownfactory

No way - No way - No way out

Born in a time
Where my God means just creation
And where death alternates
With the sovereign of hell
Let me change things today

Hey you
Are you waiting for the end
The Sanhedrin says
You will die here today
But why me
Why's not anybody else
Finding the way out of time to Jerusalem

My life is a flame
And her pale light shines on sadness of my grey solitude
That made a something out of me - just a thing out of me

Hey you Tell me this is just a dream
Why can't you say we are leaving today
And why me
Why not anybody else
I'm so afraid on my way to Jerusalem

Turn the navigation gear
Just for another thousand years
And then my spheroid will fall down in another world

Am I losing my mind - Losing my mind
I have waited for somebody - Somebody wrong

The "Seraphic Clockwork" says:
"And he will find the Babylonian apiary
Of petrified books in the serpent delta of a "Styx"

He came - The pristine sin to turn
Betrayed him for Quicksilver
And then he kissed him - Just a kiss - A Judas kiss
And then he kissed him - Just a kiss - A Judas kiss
Just a question
And then he kissed him
Time's an equinoxium
And I'm the devil's key
To save a paradoxon
With infernal perfidy

Hey you
Tell me this is just a dream
Why can't you say we are leaving today
And why me
Why not anybody else
Please say I'm late on my way to Jerusalem

And theres no place left to hide
For me - The holy parasite
Because my unfulfilled sacrament has changed time
And must change time

All kinds of details falling right out of the sky
"Not Unimmortal" if your father let you die
God's time levitation found a way
To make you a saviour today
I'm just a lie - I'm not a friend
Just a sick corrosive saint

Now you walk your way all alone
To carry the sins of the world
I came to dethrone and to betray you
So they crucify you for another life - A better day
To free the world
God's time levitator - Found a way
To heal all kinds of things
To make you a saviour today
And take all souls on board
Me - The parallel Judas will burn
You die to save us all
I'm starting the engines Because I
Never will return never will return
Never will return never will return
