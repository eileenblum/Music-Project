We're searching for the meaning of it all
And finding trails on sand drifts formed of bones
A broken footstep filled with twilight
Can you find a way
Under Pathway finders lamplight
Talk to me - And say that we are leaving
Find a way - To the eternal town of ghosts

Fireflies shine so faint and fragile
Neonizing a town with their darklight
A lovecrafted vision
Of  Shadowking's paradise
A city of wasted souls
Among the palace of the flies
Stay with me tonight holy parasite
Climb into the time - Searching heaven
I hear the revelation cry
Searching Jesus - Finding neverland

Sinking in your arms quicksilver moon
Hold me evermore
"The Seraphic Clockwork" tells the truth
In the psalms of Judas
On my way - I'm here to find you
On my way - And this feels like coming home

Fireflies shine so faint and fragile
Neonizing a town with their nonlight
These sacred poetics
Are darkminded auguries
Let the circle of tanakh
Revolve the old quixotic gear

I'm afraid to live not afraid to die
Now it's in my hands - saving heaven
I hear the premonition cry
"Finding Jesus" in a paper world

This serpent delta hides an island
Where ghosts have built a paperdome
Out of original predictions
Over the years they turned to stone
And soldiers gamble for a garment
They want to crucify His son
Inside of a manual "The Judas Revelation"
I read a prophecy that my yesterday will come
Stay with me tonight holy parasite
Wasted things to find here in aion
I hear the revelation cry
Searching Jesus - Finding neverland
