Hello my son
I am your healer
Are you the one
Who signed an agreement
You want to find here all the thrown away pages
Before the sandglass has fallen down
You're the passenger in time
I'm going to bring you over
We'll take the "Necropolitan"
Under Santa Croce de Gerusalem

We lost the day
We lost the night
God's closed the door with all the secrets behind
Sealed the rebirth of heaven in hell
Since then I've waited for someone

When Samiel muted the voice of god on earth
He stole with an "Ungiven Kiss" the infinity of days

Tell me what is on the way
A forgotten saviour

He turned the pages
He drank the Divine
While he translates the so-called narrative lies

A legend speaks of one who will find
The spire of  lost revelations

And Samiel knows after one last psalm is found
The first newborn child will ordain
Our downfall in the world

Tell me what is on the way
To the final murder

And the watchman at the door
Shields the fuel for the ghosts
They all live inside their pages
For "Neverlasting" ages

Hear now saviour - Demons will find their way
Hear now saviour - They sing just for you
And I know in a few thousand sins
This, your kingdom falls
We're awaiting the end of the world
Waiting for it - Waiting for it
And waiting for you waiting for you
Tell me what is on the way
To the final murder
Tell me what is on the way
A forgotten saviour
Tell me what is on the way
A forgotten saviour
