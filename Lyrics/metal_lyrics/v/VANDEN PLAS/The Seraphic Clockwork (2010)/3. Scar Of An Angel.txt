I saw the ashes of the world
Visions from the night hall
Will extinguish in my empty room
And then I speak a shallow prayer
We are going nowhere
Heal me - Save me

Fast comes a breeze rushing over Rome
And clouds run away from a thunderstorm
Flickering lights hiding things in elysian skies
The dust of the stars in the universe
Reflecting implosions from other worlds
Outside this phenomenon she comes
Deceiving my eyes
Then I hear the voice of an angel

Heal the world - Save me now
"Red eye" to Avantine
Heal the world - One more chance
For saving the Ambrylight

Then I feel the frequencies of a ghost
And dark mighty knights chasing angel hosts
Shes like a seraphic being, affecting me deep inside

My head is a sepulcher of broken sense
Then suddenly I perceive pestilence sway
A thing with a raven coat under the mask of decay
Inviting her to a Black Waltz death
And I feel the scars of an angel

Heal the world - Save me now
Just for a few hundred years
Heal the world - just this time
For saving my Ambrylight

Mia my Mia - Don't be afraid - Mia my Mia -
Pray while I prey
I sail upon the water - I lead you back again
Charon is floating over and leads you back again
Heal me - Save me - Heal me - Save me
I sail upon the water

Heal the world - Save me now
You're the awaited sign
Heal the world - One last chance
For saving you - Ambrylight
