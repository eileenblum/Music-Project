On that day you went away
there was so much left to say
words disappeared and faded without a trace
memorized
mesmerising
field of dreams
seer of entire
to your limitation of being
protecting your seed in a time and a land full of scars out of war
you fly
just to see how all began
to innocence
the reason for it all
you hold me
and you hurt me
and you can catch the light that shines on me
sometimes when I sleep
I try to heal your wounds within my dreams
my life is younger than your eyes have never seen the sun again
but they can tell so many common stories
until the light failed him
and you fly
to the seal of our love
to hold the pages painted there above
and you fly
just to see what I've become
improve the circle
the reason for it all
