When we fall into another day
hiding the things we've lost
the secrets to gather
nothing's forever
miles under frozen dust
a diamond vein don't know what it is
and this is the main reason for the victim of the circumstance
can we decide to shine down the light
inside all the darkness out what we are
when we are lost
when we are lost
walking the street of poetry
lay down the field of stone
patience is just another word
under the old man's tongue
when you are the way
maybe he'll come back some day
deep below in our mine
you can drift with him into another world
inside all the fears out what we are
when we are lost
when we are lost in a garden
when we are lost in a reason for the garden of stones
again you dream along
when you hold the stone
can you feel the heat
when you sow the seed
then you drift with him into another world
inside all the tears out what we are
when we're lost
when we're lost in a garden
