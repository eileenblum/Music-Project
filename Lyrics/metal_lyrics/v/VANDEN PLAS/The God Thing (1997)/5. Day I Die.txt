The reason for the change within the center of the blood
surrounded by a dream until the soul can find a door
easy to believe in
now we're living on a lie that we never cry tears and don't want to die
do you really want to change
don't you trust your fears
I don't die
I don't die
I don't
I don't die
till the day that I die
easy when you change
easy way to live
the feeling when I taste forgiveness in the wind of tenderness
now we're flowing in a stream to the wisdom's edge
how we ever pass through when we're dying at the door to
do you really want to change
don't you trust your fears
I don't die
I don't die
I don't
I don't die
'till the day that I die
'till the day that I die
I don't live 'till the day that I die
