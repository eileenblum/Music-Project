Come close my eyes cry my tears in a dream I don't dream
make me the wine out of water we tainted with blood and hate again
is it you that I'm searching
is it you that we burn
are you blight in the water
when we flow into the tide
in you: I believe
in you: I trust
in you: I believe
in you: I'm lost
come hold me
come into my drain
down to the source where unspoken charades meant to disappear again
let your tears be my water
let your blood be my wine
let your fear be my brother
I'm not on
I'm your side
in you: I believe
in you: I trust
