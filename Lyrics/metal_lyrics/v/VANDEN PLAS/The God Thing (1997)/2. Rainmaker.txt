Some illustrations are fiction of sadness
never be stopped by the dawn
now we are living on signs of a man
nothing is real
hiding the fears
hiding the love
never be stopped by believing
son of a sun our confession unties our madness
never let it go
listen to the rain
listen to the rain
when we listen to the rainmakerstory
then we listen to a song that never ends
when we listen to the rainmakerstory
we're in the end only points on a scale for the rainmaker
hypnotisation is one kind of freedom
a two colour paint by a drug
some of the answers requested by reason
better believe
better believe it
blood out of soul
sold out of blood
he taints the flesh of the poor ones
and we bite the tongue of ourselves that we never be faithfull
better let us go
you better let us go
listen to the rain
wash us all away
when we listen to the rainmakerstory
then we listen to a song that never ends
when we listen to the rainmakerstory
we're in the end only points on the scale for the rainmaker
