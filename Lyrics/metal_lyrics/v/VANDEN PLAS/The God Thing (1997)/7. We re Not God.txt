New tecniques based on plasmid transfer now make it possible
possible to determine
exact nucleotide sequences of isolated sections of the dna
when we raise clones
that's what we do
the thread of life is a threat of life
so what are we
we
we are
we are not
we're not god
creature
we've raised in laboratories
on base ephemeral
input keylock principal
genemachine you'll never know what you can do
protection of the rich ones
surveillance of the poor
so what when we raise a secret mushroom that we can't control
when we raise clones
that's what we do
the tread of time is a dread of life
so what are we
we
we are
we are not
we're not god
brand new breed based on plasmid transfer now make impossible
possible to determine
insane nucleotide frequences
eliminated
selection of the dna
when we raise clones
that's what we do
the thread of life is a threat of life
so what are we
we
we are
we are not
we're not god
