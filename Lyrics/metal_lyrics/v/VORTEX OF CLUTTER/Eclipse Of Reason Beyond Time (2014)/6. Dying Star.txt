This great arrogance
When did it seize?
Become the elite viruses
Weak individuals of our societies
Separation from nature
Absolute superiority of mind
Glorious existence
And sound solitude of one

The end begins
Nature will prevail
Misanthropy
New trend of your status

Youâve only forgotten
Your creative power
And it will help you
Remember back
Your true identity!

You are a withering scrap
Which needs pruning
Totally forgot
The whole you
Used to be a part of
Isolated
Merely consuming
Feeding the machine
By disappearing

The end begins
Nature will prevail
Misanthropy
New trend of your status

Youâve only forgotten
Your creative power
And it will help you
Remember back
Your true identity!

As modern life stands under
Blocks of concrete
Just sit and watch
Remember who you are!
Only a dying star...
Dying star
