Live your life as a normal human being.
Bury the memories into the depth of your mind.
Those days you were human are gone.
Were you alive for real till now?

In the age of holy science
A new regime built on hidden notes
March on by spreading the paranoia
And let the tune rules in everywhere.

And the tune starts and goes on.

Hear the sound catching your conscience.
The city lapses into silence when the notes flow.
A quiet unrest covers your conscious.
One step forward, one step back.
Watch my step and keep up with.

Destroy
Imagination
Create
Constantly voting citizen
All the myths and religions
Order
Legion with faith
Indoctrinate
Covert raid
Total Purified nation

Waltz of the living dead
Close your eyes and clear your head
Walk in harmony
Feed your insanity
