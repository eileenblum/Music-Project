Food chain is damaged 
Hunger of human being
Turned into millions of carrion 
Do you believe in right to live?
Or are you gonna just eat? 
Play with the genetics and sell
Make them become addicted to consume

Encephalopathy 
Neurotic disorders
Simple human disease 
All became social deadly epidemics

While one part is fulling up 
The soil is being polluted
Bio-chemical rape of the nature
The freaks they eat deforms all the bodies
Evolution becomes mutation

Anthropophagia
Neurotic disorders 
Simple human diseases
All became social deadly epidemics

The deformation of human race 
Started with the intervention to food chain
When the mutation was being noticed 
There was no one left behind to help
By eating your own race 
Can you feed yourself?
All the food additives created new human race

Capital 
Rules
Cannibals 
Consume more
Deformed human 
Annihilation of societies
Drowning in its own hunger
Those fucking men fleshes
Modern life
Wipes itself off
Yesterdayâs hunter todayâs hunt
Ends with human race
