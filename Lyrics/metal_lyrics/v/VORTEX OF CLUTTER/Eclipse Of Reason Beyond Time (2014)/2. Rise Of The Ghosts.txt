Twisting and curling
Marching on all night long
Crawling into the safest shelter
Screaming and yelling
To take down the kingdom 
Walking-deads are gathering in the square

New creation 
Calling for destruction
Through the fire 
Salutes to nations

Come and join us 
To make chaos absolute
One last war remains
Bloody, wild, cruel, fatal
Rise of the ghosts 
That have been dead for years
It's time to rise now 
Getting out of your flesh ripped

History haven't seen 
Such a big struggle
Pale and lost faces 
Knocked the bright minority
Existence of floating pale ghosts 
has now its own meaning
Reign of chaos 
is now rising

Dead and furious millions
CHAOS
are getting increased
CHAOS
by crossing continents
CHAOS
is uniting
CHAOS
is reigning
CHAOS!!!
