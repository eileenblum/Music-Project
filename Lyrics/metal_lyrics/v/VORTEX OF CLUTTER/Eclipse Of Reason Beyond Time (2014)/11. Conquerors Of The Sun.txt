After long and dark years
The ghosts rose from the dead
Bloody and deadly war ended
The past was connected to the future

Captured daylight 
Must unchain again
Ignorance fed by hunger
Must stay under dust and ashes

After all false heroes fell
Bloodsucker prophets crawled
Hail to the legion
Beneath the ancient slaves
Ideas rises from their graves

One step over the line 
Unity beyond the time
Ready to attack 
Weâre gonna conquer the sun

As the shadow gets out of the sunâs sight
Weâre getting that the world isnât enough
For the ultimate and clear freedom
We have to rise

Captured daylight 
Must unchain again
Ignorance fed by hunger
Must stay under dust and ashes

After all false heroes fell
Bloodsucker prophets crawled
Hail to the legion
Beneath the ancient slaves
Ideas rises from their graves

One step over the line 
Unity beyond the time
Ready to attack 
Weâre gonna conquer the sun
