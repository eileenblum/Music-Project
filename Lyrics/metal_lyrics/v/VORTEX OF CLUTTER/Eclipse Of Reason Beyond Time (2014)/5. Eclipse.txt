When the truth of the past 
Turned into todayâs mistakes
You! Alone and old man 
Do not even look back

Tried to live in a right manner 
Your life, wrong from the outset
As you cannot be the subject of your own life
Got involved the othersâ lives

As a vital epidemic 
You are a goody of your race
Intellectual of your own age 
False doctrines of the future

When the limitations you put in the name of modernity
Violated by a new generation
Sharp sword of the authority
Takes a shape in your hand

The cycle has gone on for ages 
Reflow of history plagued the future
Dark confusion of your mind 
Deteriorated your genes

As a vital epidemic 
You are a goody of your race
Intellectual of your own age 
False doctrines of the future

Now itâs time to regenerate 
Rip your roots off and unchained yourself
Existence! Stimulate!

You donât need your eyes to see

You talk about the endless freedom 
Hypocrisy and deception
You are just a simple summary 
Of the whole planet

Deterioration of your mind fed the authority

Create 
Millions
Follow the line 
Eclipse of reason beyond time
