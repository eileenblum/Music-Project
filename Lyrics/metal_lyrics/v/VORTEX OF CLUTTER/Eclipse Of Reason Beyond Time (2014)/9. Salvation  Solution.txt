Day after day 
Step by step 
Waiting for salvation 
Getting closer to death 
Couldnât wake myself up
From the warm hope of 
Sweet liberation 

Salvation lies 
Not for tonight

A solution

Disease spread throughout my body 
A dysfunctional pile of flesh
Yet I had a sole purpose 
Still had a chance

All hope fading away, 
Tonight for my one last shot
I will cut the wire 
Iâll cut it!

A blast right at the core 
A few potent deaths 
And my name will be remembered
âThe saviour of the rising generationâ
March through the shadows 
Get in, donât be seen
End this madness 
Before this disease
Consumes your brain 

Dictatorship 
It must end
The saviour 
Of the rising generation
The saviour of this generation
A saviour...

I need to cut the wire just in time
