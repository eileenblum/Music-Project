Years of internalisation of the music you listen.
Self â praising about being an extreme man of the milieu
no more than a parasite
Only consuming without thoughts and ideals
Beneath your tough-looking there is a norm-lover
Thatâs about it!

Your music is heavy, but lack of attitude
Self styled outcast, essentially consumerist
Entertainers only serve the purpose
No need for the attitude and piece of art

Feel the pressure
Pressure of the attitude
Your endless desire
Is just a fucking mud
Beasts and monsters
Only inspiration youâve got
God or devil
Whichever you have got

Weâre gonna have some fun tonight
Are you sure this is heavy and tight?
Your deepest fantasies
Will turn into a reality.

Torturer
Killer
Who do you think you are?
Believer
Deceiver
Your image is a big fat lie

So called uncompromised
Powerful
And tough guy
Shit scares of
Any real fight

Coward
Idiot
Youâve no power
Youâre just a waste of time

Youâre scared of anything
Scared of being real
Scared of being different
No more than a waste of time

Values you sit for
Keep you captive
Consume your soul
Youâre just a waste of time

Your fake riot
Is a part of a huge crowd
Just a strategy of entertainment

Youâre just a consumer
You're just a big liar
Youâre just a waste of time
Have fun!
See you at another night
