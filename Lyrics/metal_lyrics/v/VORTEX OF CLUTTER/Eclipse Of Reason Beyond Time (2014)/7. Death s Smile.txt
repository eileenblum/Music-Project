And the voyager took a step
To the desert of land without sunshine.
Serenity was unusual
The night was restless and the sunshine was captured

40.000 lives in a night 
Dead bodies side by side
Into his age of darkness 
The Emperor will rise

His eyes didnât get used to the darkness
But he could smell cupreous blood in the air
And the voyager got in the moment
Deserts, silent villages, people buried in deep well

40.000 lives in a night 
Dead bodies side by side
Into his age of darkness 
Youâll see the deathâs smile

What happened that night? 
Where was the dawn?
How did the death of people with worthless lives
Become a legend
The sunshine was captured
Humanity faded away
The time testified
To the glorious bloodbath

And the emperor smiled 
The voyager looked at his eyes
Insanity and cruelty of the death ruled the land

And the hatred of god 
And he spoke on behalf of god
The massacre of the innocent
For the survival of the state

And the voyager kept silent 
Forgot the ones under the ground
The dark night 
Never met the sun

And the emperor smiled 
The voyager looked at his eyes
Insanity and cruelty of the death ruled the land
