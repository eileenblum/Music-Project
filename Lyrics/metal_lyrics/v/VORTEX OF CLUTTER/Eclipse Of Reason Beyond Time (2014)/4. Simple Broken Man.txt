Long time ago
While being just a young soul
The world was plunged into darkness
And it was incumbent on us to turn the lights on

Prices paid
Feed the paranoia
High voltage
To the schizophrenia
Behind the barricade
Restless eyes
Suck our souls
The gates of time

Faster than estimated
Everything was at an end
While coming to an end
The lights went out again
Behind the wreck
That remains behind
Ruins just empty buildings?
Or our souls?

I need to focus onâ¦

The ones fell behind
Just a dimmed shadow
Awaiting their turns next to me
My wife and my son

Prices paid
Feed the paranoia
High voltage
To the schizophrenia
Behind the barricade
Restless eyes
Suck our souls
The gates of time

Running
Still under the pressure
Bleeding
My mind is a quite empty cell
My war to live
Struggling against my madness
I must stand
We must stand

I simple broken man
I must gather strength
I no more alone
We heir to the shadows
We voyagers of the same destiny
I simple broken man

While my whole life was flowing
I just stood and watched
Iâm only an audience
Of my elegant show
The effect of my past on me
Rules my future
The dead in my mind
Pulls me down to the deep

The nation
Expectations and responsibilities
Canât shape me now
The nation
I must resist
To the holy deviance imposed
Religion
I must found a free family
Freedom,
Despite everything I must keep it alive in your eyes

Instinct
Kept me alive
While all the values are going down
I had until today
I must survive
And piece together
While getting lonely with each passing day
And the shadows are surrounding my soul
I must resist, be the one and live

I canât no longer see
I canât no longer hear
I canât no longer feel
What have you done to me?
