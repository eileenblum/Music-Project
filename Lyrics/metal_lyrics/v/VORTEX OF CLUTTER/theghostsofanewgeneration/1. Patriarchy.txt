Created
From the carcass of your lord
Your god, your child, your people
You're nothing but a servant

You've accepted
Your eternal slavery
Registered in the ancient myths
They've raped
Your body, your spirit

You're the victim of slavery regime
New masters were grown up in your hands
But you're ruled again
What is your role in the new world order
A traditional life sucker

If you want to freedom
Of you and me
You must burn it
Burn the Patriarchy

Socialized
Like a man in the form of a woman
Terrorized
forces of the modern society
Paralized
Dependence of morality
Will begin with your choice
The evolution of society
absolute liberty
or the everlasting slavery of self

You're the victim of slavery regime
New masters were grown up in your hands
But you're ruled
What is your role in the new world order
A traditional life sucker

Sapere Aude and see
Hypocrisy of those who shape you
A servant, a flesh
Or an intelligent form of life

If you want to freedom
Of you and me
You must burn it
Burn the Patriarchy
