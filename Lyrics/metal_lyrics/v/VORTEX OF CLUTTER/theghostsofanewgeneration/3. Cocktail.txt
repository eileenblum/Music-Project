Fear
Roots of the empire you built upon us

Fire
is gonna give you what you deserve
determine the chaos

Time
Judgemental vein of the oldest slaves
Your Eyes are witnesses
Rampart of the money is now falling

i can smell your pain
i can see you're going insane
in times of the fire
time is taking you far away

Years
All those years are gone
That we dance in harmony
Propoganda, mind control
It's time to turn over your throne

Horn
Just like the horn of a bull
We got into the heart of the town
Time is the witness
Castle of the system is now burning

And
i can smell your pain
i can see you're going insane
in times of the fire
time is taking you far away

Night is coming down slowly
In here i can see my city
Burn in a thousand flames
Don't be scared
That's the way to set you
FREE

That's the way to set you free
You must see their hypocrisy

"Feel the fire in your veins"

That's the way to live your life
In other time
With a better way

"Don't let them to control hate"

We control the fire
Time is taking you away
You perverted liar
Lay down and enjoy our cocktail
