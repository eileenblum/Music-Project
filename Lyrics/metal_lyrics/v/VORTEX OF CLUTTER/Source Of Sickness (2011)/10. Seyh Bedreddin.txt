The drizzle
It Can not clean
All the blood

He walked as he passes the gates of time
A seed from Simavna has landed in Anatolia
He saw violence, tried anger and rage
Taking the life of his own brother, for power

The drizzle
It can not clean
All the blood

He walked as he passes the gates of time
A seed from Simavna has landed in Anatolia
By his words he filled the execution fields
From his brand new throne, he saw and said:

"God in human, human in god"
"Property is illegitime, blood is legitime"

He walked as he passes the gates of time
A seed from Simavna has landed in Anatolia
By his words he filled the execution fields
From his brand new throne, he saw and said

'God in human, human in god"
"Property is illegitime, blood is legitime"

words shed fellows blood
words, stronger than a sword.

[Turkish translation:]

YaÃ°mur Ã§iseliyor
Temizleyemez
BÃ¼tÃ¼n bu kanÃ½

ZamanÃ½n kapÃ½larÃ½ndan geÃ§erek
Anadolu topraklarÃ½nda; yÃ¼rÃ¼dÃ¼
Simavna'dan bir tohum
Ãiddeti gÃ¶rdÃ¼, hÃ½rsÃ½ ve Ã¶fkeyi tattÃ½
GÃ¼cÃ¼ elde etmek iÃ§in
KardeÃ¾in kardeÃ¾ hayatÃ½ aldÃ½Ã°Ã½nÃ½ gÃ¶rdÃ¼

YaÃ°mur Ã§iseliyor
Temizleyemez
BÃ¼tÃ¼n bu kanÃ½

Ãmparator TanrÃ½ adÃ½na konuÃ¾tu
SÃ¶zler kanÃ½ akÃ½ttÃ½
SÃ¶zleriyle idamÃ½ tattÃ½
Ãmparatoru gÃ¶rdÃ¼ ve sÃ¶yledi :

"TanrÃ½ insandadÃ½r, insan TanrÃ½'da"
"Kimsenin hakkÃ½ yok herkesin olanÃ½ almaya"

Ãmparator TanrÃ½ adÃ½na konuÃ¾tu

"Kimsenin hakkÃ½ yok herkesin olanÃ½ almaya"

SÃ¶zler kanÃ½ akÃ½ttÃ½
SÃ¶zler kÃ½lÃ½Ã§tan keskin
