Legion
Waiting all over the world
Human
Unaware of the final hours of existence

Only 12 were holy of a thousand deaths
Aware of the path of mankind

Now we walk in the name of 12
Reciting the sacred
Perfect plan they left us
Will it really work?

Corroding inside out
Genes of evil
A praise to extinction
And all pain will be no more

Can we reach the truth?
The eternal merit of accepting life
Or will we submit
To the genes of evil

Creation
Born again from annihilation
New life
Embryos to wake up years later

To wake up thousands of years later
We are expectant to all probable

Inside the darkness of time
Pure embryonic life
Sacred codes of utopia
Will be our guide

Nature and human form
Will be together again
The biggest civilization
In the universe

The 12 were wrong about mankind
Evil appears again
Our only hope for the universe is to
Exterminate

All means of civilization must be gone
Prospect of evolution
The universe should be protected
From a disease this powerful

We came in the name of 12
And we are leaving again
Our existence against darkness
We exalt annihilation
