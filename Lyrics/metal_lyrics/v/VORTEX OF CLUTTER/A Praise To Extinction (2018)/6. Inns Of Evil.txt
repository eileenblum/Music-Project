Before we all went mad
Sailing close to the island at midnight
Eyes, I'll never forget your eyes
Meaningful, as if seen the darkness in our souls

Left it all behind, went back
Streets now quiet and pitch black
Death's long and painful journey
Yield unto us like night terror

And we hear the sound
Every night
We lose our minds

And we feel the pain
Their hunger
All gone insane

The wind carried more and more
Howls of pain and hunger
Eating each other, alive
Our imaginations tested our sleep

We wished having been cursed
Punished and demolished
Death, to us, was a simple fine
Sentenced to listen and stay alive

The sound gets higher and higher
A dead sleep our only desire
We kill the pure and innocent
Satan now is a closer friend
Fire
Swallowing the whole city
Darkness
Now stronger and warmer than before

Our inheritance is to sentence a thousand innocent souls

To endless torture
And everything changed on that cursed day
Our line cursed day by day
An island, now a grave to many
Our bodies now inns to evil
