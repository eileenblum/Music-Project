Morning sun hypnotises me
Goes ripping through my soul
There is nothing to light inside me
Only darkness

A black mud seizes me
Sticking everywhere
By the metamorphosis of the spirit
Evil becomes â who I am

A little piece of meat
That sees itself a giant
Where I came from is now too far away
I know I won't be going back

Feeding the devil
I've built inside
I can calculate
How much evil I need

Adrenaline keeps me standing
I need more
This devil is not mine
I am inside him

My apathy should scare you
Sucked the world's blood to survive
Even when I'm fading away
I won't have any regrets

I worship my own dead body
I believe in my own darkness
In my perfect annihilation
I keep myself alive
