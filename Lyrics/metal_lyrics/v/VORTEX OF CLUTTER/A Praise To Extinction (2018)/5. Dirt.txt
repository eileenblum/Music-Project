You can't look at me can you?
Your hands are shaking with fear
Waiting to turn the switch on
But the greatness of my hate is obstructing you

My existence is an insult to mankind
Raping humanity was a pleasure to me
Only regret that I have before leaving
I not having destroyed you all

In my life I've broken
Every law made by men and god
I either had made any more
I would be happy to fuck them too

Be quick
Show me the joy of death
Your stink makes me sick
Need to get rid of your existence making me puke
I will find peace inside the dirt

I hate myself as I hate all of you
Do you think I'm the only one
You can find it deep inside you
I'm just a simple man on the act

In my life I've broken
Every law made by men and god
I either had made any more
I would be happy to fuck them too

Evil
A simple accusation
Heretic
A gentle appeal
Darkness
Not greater than any of you

Rob them
Leave powerless
Rape them
Leave undignified
Kill them
Destroy worthless assets

They just desires to reform me
A failed trial for them
If you're going to reform one
The only way to kill him

I would like to find out who is
Responsible mankind's birth
Today I am dirty
But tomorrow I'll be just dirt.
