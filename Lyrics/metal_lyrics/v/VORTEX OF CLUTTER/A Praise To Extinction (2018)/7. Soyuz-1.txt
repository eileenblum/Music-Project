A fading voice, talking about, nation's pride
But all I can feel is pressure and the increasing heat
Can't remember, why I'm here
Was I on an expedition
Or invited to a birthday

The inevitable end is now clearer
Must say farewell to the woman I love
Left home a husband, a father
Going back as a pile of coal

I watched time
In front of my eyes

Wish I could become a drop of rain
Losing all my burdens

Into the sky
I'm going to die
Mark my words
I will curse you eternally

Disappointment is a bus stop utopia can never reach
The pleasure of seeing the end of war
Does not excite me anymore
