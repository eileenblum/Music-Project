She will rise again and she will be one
She'll take her revenge again and again

Aztecs, warned centuries ago
Towers grew taller to reach god
Defiled everything she protected
Their arrogance and ambition destroyed their tribe

Feel the rage of darkness rising
Its eternal wrath over us forever
Until the last standing man
Is turned to manure
Purity
Primitivity

She will rise again and she will be one
She'll take her revenge again and again
You will find end of your story
It is called doom of humanity

Find her name in every single nation's history
Some called her goddess, some called her mother
Ate her own children in the wake of treason
To her generous bosom

We, the last children of the noble goddess
Hit the last strike like coyotes
We'll taste sudden death
Or drown in this forsaken life

Insanity
Primitivity

When the last drop of human blood dries up
She will bring peace back to earth
When all trees of civilization vanish
She will sit in her throne, forever
