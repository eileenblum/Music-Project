A moment of vacuity
Costs you your life
Your eyes burning for salvation and revenge
Now seeking ways to bleed you

How many have you screwed (like me?)
In the glorious name of Allah?
Ripping apart your body
I'm screaming at what is left of your faces

There is no god
There is no saviour of life
The only one you will beg at the time of your death
Will be the one you steal the life of

Before you even reach for your gun
I slit your throat
Before I kill myself
You will taste your own flesh

Can't stop this violence within me
And have no reason to
I know you are being hunted one by one
At cities not so far away

There is no time
I know you can die
If I could just separate myself to two
I would like to watch what I'd do

I was only human once
Then I fell into pieces
Carrying hate in every atom
Raped by the sacred
Now will hurt your sacred

Hate I've always controlled
Will now see the light of day
No need for me to scatter around anymore
Like a grit in a desert

Now blood is scattering everywhere
Holding your intestines in my hands
You looking carefully inside my eyes
I scream at your face once again

There is no god
There is no savior for your life
Salvation time for me is here
I will not be a slave
From cradle to the grave
