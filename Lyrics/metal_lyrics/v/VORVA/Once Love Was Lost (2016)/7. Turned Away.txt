She's walking down the street
Her face is so amazingly sweet
She's wearing high heeled shoes
I want her to be my own muse

But I stay where I sigh
Because I'm made of something wrong for her
My intent is to deal only with the scum me

I'm staring at her as if it's a dream
My heart is beating faster than I believe
Her face is something really heavenly
Her curvy shapes and tiny skirt are stunning me
But I just turn away
And keep on verging to decay
Cause I'll never be fed up
Of booze and drugs and nasty sluts

But I stay where I sigh
Because I'm made of something wrong for her
My intent is to deal only with the scum me

Cause I'll never be fed up
Of booze and drugs and nasty sluts
