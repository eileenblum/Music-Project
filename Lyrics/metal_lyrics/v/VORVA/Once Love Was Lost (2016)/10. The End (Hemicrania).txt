As soon as I seem to recover from the throes of a sickness
It hits me again with the most horrible pain
I can feel it coming back
But I wish that was not what I fear

Drifting towards completion
Of this hideous fiction
I can feel it coming back
Unmistakable devildom

I would die
To be the god's right hand man
Or the devil's favourite demon
There must be not so much pain in hell

The crucial moment of doom is near
And my perceptions refuse to fear the end

It goes on and on
For the last time 'til the end, very end
When the life meets death
When the skies turn dark for me
When the sickness sets me free

There must be not so much pain in hell
