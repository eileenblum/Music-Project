You'll never behave like martyrs singing their woes
You'll never reflect like humans counting their bones
Now get all your wounds of the tapes
Forget everything that you had
And free all that you thought about
Blushing hopes have never saved a soul
There's no purity in our loves
Pulling triggers will never save the world
All those blessings were just a fault
Their blood still breeds the infection
That spreads in half a shake
Our minds are in possession
No matter what we make
Corroded chains and burning shackles restrain us
Your sun goes down, lower than ever

Since human brain is structured
And feelings got abused
You're last to witness death of all we knew
Embrace the memory pieces
That wither in your head
Cause nothing will be changed before an end

You're too close to step down
To devour your dying feelings
There's no need to survive
Humanity is led to the very end

It's up too long to receive this pain
And lost emotions shared by the ancestors of humankind

You're struck with the circular motions of withering minds
And left to submissively suck all these lies
