Here I lay
Writhe in pain
Thinking back
Thinking of your grace
Never pleased by your love before
I perceive all you have shown me

My saviour
Come again
Take away my pain
For the love of these darkened days
My saviour
Come again

Still I lay
Writhe in pain
Looking back
At my crooked path
Tearing down my somatic forms
Atrophy wrapped all over me

My saviour
Come again
Take away my pain
For the love
Of these darkened days
My saviour
Come again

I take my desolation
I split my lungs with the swallow
Expecting to feel your faith
Set my heart in motion
Send my mind emotions

I feel low, so low
I'm dying to find you
Hear my cries under the cope of night
It's so cold, so cold
I'm dying to pass through
The gates of glass guiding to the light

Once love was lost
