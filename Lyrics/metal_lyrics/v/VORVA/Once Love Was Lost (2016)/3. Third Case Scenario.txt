Sleeping soul waits for the wind to blow
Does not even seem to wake for the last time
Wrapped in cold, laid under the snow
With not a single chance to grant her lungs one try
Lull your heart and hear me whisper
I'll never let you down
These cold, these coldest nights will go through
There must be the way to you

You've never thought how nice it is to breathe
When you feel the wind and the sun shines extremely bright
You'd never quit this life if you perceived
How it is too see what's behind the light

It's not a danger
Although it's dark behind this blinding light
It's up to you to stay or move
This is the time to decide
This is the very time to decide

Up to the niveous lands of perfect bliss and tranquil souls
Up to the skies where you could heal your wounds
Or down to burning storm of dust and filth
Choking you with smoke and tears

Bitterness and sorrow fill your sleeping heart
Internal collisions shatter your mind
Now chase your anguish away
And cling to life
Take a look at our shadows in praise of supreme force
And choose the third case scenario
Why are you chosen by the gods?
Just cling, please cling to life with me

Come on
Just cling to life
Please summon up all strength you have and cling to life
I rush to rescue, I will find you no matter how
