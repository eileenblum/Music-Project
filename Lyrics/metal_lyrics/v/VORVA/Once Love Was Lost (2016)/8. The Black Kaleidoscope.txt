No frantic power lasts in boiling hearts we trust as one
The black kaleidoscope is set in motion
Those wings we cleaned so hard now have all feathers gone
It's long past time to stop carrying false devotion
We've been so vain for too long
I've cut my tongue to become that dumb
I've ripped my eyes out to be that blind
There's no escape
No hope for salvation
I am the freewill sacrifice

Our signs decay in ruthless fire
Our sacred scriptures glow in flames
This is the day when it all turns black
And finally dissipates
We finally fade away

Enslaved by our demons we bury ourselves
With the fading shine of our wasted lives
We've burnt our signs
I've made my piece
I am free from the Earth
I've caught the pitch black kiss
Of black kaleidoscope
I am the freewill sacrifice
I am the sacrifice

Bless the prophecies
The code that I've been scratching onto walls for years
For the doomsday, for the holy comfort
Now I turn to ashes with my legend, the cult I swore on
