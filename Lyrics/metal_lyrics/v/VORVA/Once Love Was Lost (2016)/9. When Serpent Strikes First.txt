False grace of weakened pace
Contaminated nations in erratic mess
Repulsion and grime will thick the curse
Emblazoning iconoclastic controversies

If serpent strikes my body first I'll quiet down
There's no one left to claim that I'm insane

I am so fucking sickened by the lies I hide
Braced hands and shallow trace
Abandoned to despair, suffering distress
As waters run dry we drink the swill
Descending deeper and deeper into the dust

If serpent strikes my body first I'll quiet down
There's no one left to claim that I'm insane

This poetry is for the poor
The one of sopping sand, of malice and the sour will come
Dispersing fleets of crows and breaking the mold
He will create the mortal flood

Hail the fortune we all will be buried
Forever in the dark
