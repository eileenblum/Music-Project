Watch two crawl from the depths
Such beautiful enemies
As they lounge on the island sand
Contagion of fear captures my men

And they begin with their singing
And I can't take a hold on myself
I just command to set me free
But my crew keeps me bound with ropes

I've never heard so beautiful voices before
I pray my Lord to give me strength

This is not the only time we are in danger
Let the winds carry us away

Let us leave this place
And ride the storm again
Let them fall into the sea
I believe
Let us stand
Let us stand 'til the end

There's no hope for the men who once hear their voice
They warble to death with their songs
