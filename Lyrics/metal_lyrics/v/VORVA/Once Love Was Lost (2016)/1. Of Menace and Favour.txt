Since I hardly keep my eyes open
And try to discern the truth
I realize it's time to fight
They have our senses on a string
With virulent mixture of menace and favour
They make us all believe
In what they call to live
They take away the cure
But they're not the chosen few
They're not the chosen few

I'm sure this is what we deserve
Dark matter poisoned our lives
We're unaware of being chained
With humble submission we gave up traditions
There is no time to loose
We have to stop abuse
Just try to look around
And to refine your mind
Refine your poisoned mind

Torment
Distress
No
Break the blow
We should behold
Rise as one
And break it down

Don't let them fascinate your soul
As parasites we root in our blood
Too blind to see what's happening above
We are the bearers of human selfishness
With eyes tight shut we turn ourselves to casualties
Like rats we run along the walls
We are the tragedy
We are the great mistake
