Restrain your perfect care
And leave me bleeding from inside
Because I can no longer remain in your life
Just leave me here and step outside
The way I feel just weights me down

There's nothing left for me to see
And it's me who's left for you to free
Let these daggers drain my body of the blood
Let the gallows purify my soul of sins and mud

Restrain your perfect care
And leave me bleeding from inside
Because I can no longer remain in your life

I'm too faint and weakened to find a solution
And those feelings will always remind me of you
Forever

Go
This sore heart weights me down
Empty inside I've got nothing to gain
I'm not worried, just fading away
It's my burden to see
My heart will never heal

Life is giving the long
Way to understand
What we deserve and we are worth

Threatening motions
Misleading, bombing, killing
Drowning oceans
Terrorising
Misleading
