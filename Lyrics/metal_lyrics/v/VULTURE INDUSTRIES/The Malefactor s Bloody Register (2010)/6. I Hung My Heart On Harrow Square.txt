The cart carrying the damned came rolling at a steady paceOn it a sorry, defeated lot, carried through the morning hazeThree men and two women, en route to their doomTo die by my hands, before the clock struck noon I hung my heart on Harrow squareLaid that noose around her neck and strung her up there With a steady gracious stride, she climbed the scaffold stairsBegged me to be quick and clean, then shed one single tearThis god-like, glorious thing served to an ungodly endForeordained at our only meet, a lot for which I'll spend... ...hours tormented through ages repent My one true loss of that lover I sentTo fire and brimstone to torment and flameTo face the beyond without knowing her name Forgive me my dear your devout murdererA broken down pauper in grave disrepairForgive me oh dearest I solemnly swearThat time's long gone when I last stood here... ... with that awful plight on Harrow squareTo lay that noose around your neck and string you up thereI hung my heart on Harrow squareLay that noose around her neck and strung her up there
