Dark alleys, gas light hazeSmog riddled sinners in a gloomy mazeThis is the decade of us sordid sonsWe keep the devil from the streets, have justice doneFilth riddled dreadful airIn every nook and crevice lures the devil's snareA proper captain needs his sordid sonsTo keep the devil from the streets, have justice done No splendor, no praiseThe chosen hides his faceWhat inglorious displayWhen the sordid son breaks your sordid ways The foul mob claim sin for sinEvery rotten urge seems to exist withinThis is the decade of us sordid sonsWe keep the devil from the streets, have justice doneA sick tree bears poison fruitThe sordid son kills the sickened rootWe rid the shadow of each wicked witchWe chase the devil from the devilish twitch Crook and sinners, debauched lotDispatched from being by the righteous knots we tie Decree by decree a burden upon usShunned, twisted debrisThey all drift towards us like moths drawn to flameA fatal attraction towards death and shameA race for the gallows by a pitiful packTo join their brothers atop the sordid son's rack Bystard by bastard perish to showTheir gullible brothers who watch from bellowThat sin has its price and the price has its tollPaid by hangman and judges with a piece of their souls So...This is the decade of us sordid sonsWe keep the devil from the streets have justice doneYou must know this is the decade of us sordid sonsWe keep the devil from the streets have justice done You've got a sickened tree bearing poisoned fruitsSo stomp it dead beneath your sordid bootThere is no rest for shaking handsEternal servants to the crowd's demandsYou know an ordered prospeous happy kindNeed their bastard sons and their sordid mindsSee the devil hides behind many a guiseAnd you can't be certain until the subject dies All shun the bastard son of lawDisposable justice whore Bastard sonAll shun the bastard sonNo one, the bastard sonFilthyUncleanBastard son of law
