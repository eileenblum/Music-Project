I lie here listening to sounds of this insane cityTwisting and turning for hours, still not able to sleep Stray dogs they bark, bark and and howl like wolves outside my windowBark, unkind, grind, evil, malign, villainous kindBark, unkind, evil, malign, never, ever, kind Chasing shadows each of other like that rabid kind I call my kinVillainous kind, bark, unkind, grind, evil, malign, devilish kindEvil malicious minds The stench of gutters blends with smog from hulking chimneys...Dark, unkind, grind, evil, malign, villainous kindBark, unkind, evil, malign, never, ever, kind ... forming a thick dark mist allusive of our soulsVillainous kind, bark, unkind, grind, evil, malign, devilish kindEvil malicious minds For hours I have been twisting, turning for sleepBut terrified of what awaits For days now I have been yearning for relief from this time and space From the depths of limbo I hear calling, still I strive to clingTo the shards of a broken realm to maintain my essence, save my soul from hellIn the depths of Somnus my trial awaits me to deliver my pleaA scornful mob of the justly dispatched to hand me my verdict with sentence attached The moist, stale air grows thicker, hotter, smothering meLike the unwanted child of a deluded self-righteous motherThat abomination for long I have served From the depths of limbo I hear calling, still I strive to clingTo the shards of a broken realm to maintain my essence, save my soul from hellIn the depths of Somnus my trial awaits me to deliver my pleaA scornful mob of the justly dispatched to hand me my verdict with sentence attached No peace, no glory gained, just transient relief from worldly strainLo' there's no eluding those mental chains, of a soul pawned for a crock of goldFor the broken subject not of thought but of told, like a broken statue cast into the mouldStill as change might occur, forced or change from stirThe mind still retains some quintessence remainsSome essence maintains its grip on the broken manTo pull the soul from the iron handTo cleanse, to purge, to wash away that bloody brand Please don't weep for me sister for I have done much wrongDon't despise me my brothers what's done is doneI've been lost on a cold night, been gone far and longAnd for my deeds I'll repent there on my electric throne
