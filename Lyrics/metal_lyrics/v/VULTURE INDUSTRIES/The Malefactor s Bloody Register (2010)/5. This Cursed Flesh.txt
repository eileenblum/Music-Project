Scrubbing skin, cleanse this cursed fleshOh that vile stench of sin seems to seep from withinI still smell his burning fat, his bowels turnedOh that rank smell of sin seems to stick to my skinWas his death unjust? Well I dare hope notHis sentence may falter, but the end that he gotNeatly executed with impeccable skillJust like I'd wish my end when it is fulfilled I pray it must draw nearThis burden turned to much to bearI wish I could greet my long trusted friendMy only true companion to and through the end Scrubbing skin, cleanse this bloodied fleshOh that vile stench of sin emanates from withinI still feel those woeful stares, their scent of fearAnd that rank smell of sin seems to stick to my skin Were their deaths unjust? Well I would bet notSuch nasty, demeanours account for a lotSo we sent them off to the best of our willsStill that accursed room echoes with their screams so thrill Is this endless delirious strain, sore pores and bloody chainsAll I shall attain, has it been to no avail?This raucous delirious strain returns again and againThe ghosts of the slain, from my bonded domain I pray it must draw near, my burden grievousI'd greet my trusted friendIntent companion loyal through grace and grief parade and gutterMy aide through life and lot I beg you to collect me
