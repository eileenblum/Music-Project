Now listen man:There's no good to be found in this mireThe muck's just deeper and the further you digThe more it sticks to your soul and skinSlowly settling the taint within When all is saidWe'll be amongst the practical deadCut off from the way aheadPicked as the world colludesTo see the circle conclude Now listen man:There's just filth to be found in this mireThe more you struggle, the faster you sinkSo abandon your searchIf you're stuck in hellYou're worse off if know it was well When all is saidAll blood is bledWe'll be amongst the practical deadCut off from the way aheadA broken, battered broodCasualties of the general moodPicked as the world colludesTo see the circle conclude Hear the mob calls my nameTo quench its bloodlust againOne final glorious actTo end this dismal, this dismal sinister pact Our sentence, the crowning of the cycle, our final closure Our sentence, the crowning of the cycleOne final time to stand before the howling hundredsBlood surging like thunder, our final closure
