There lies a beast
Near the top of the stairs,
Weary and weak
In its final years.

Still at times you'll hear,
Hear it howl,
Howl at the wind.
A low haunted lament
For the glorious times spent
Stalking the halls
Of the tower.

Close to the sovereign seat the wretched beast lies,
Dreary and riddled with lice.
Frail, weak, and dirty, fur patched and thin,
It barely bothers to shake off the flies.
Its years of glory now long past and gone.
Its body quakes, throbbing in its shame,
Of its fall from grandeur into the abyss,
To the oblivion of the useless and the maimed.
I used to hear it call my name,
But the howl turned to a wail.
As the hound yearns, the past burns the beast.

At the top of the stairs,
So weary and weak
In its final years.

Still at times you'll hear,
Hear it howl,
Howl at the wind.
A low haunted lament
For the glorious times spent
Stalking the halls,
The halls of the tower.
The halls of the tower.
The halls of the tower.
The hallsâ¦
The halls of the...

Hear the beast's reigning call.
A ghost from the past
Chasing through every hall.
A feeble shadow
Of what was once feared by us all.
A reluctant derelict from a bygone time,
Still sending shivers down many a spine,
But a stranger still among its own kind,
This pitiful ghost.

Oh, I miss it still.
Oh, I miss it so.
Oh, I miss it so.
[?]

By the beast's reigning cry.
By the beast's reigning cry.
By the beast's reigning cry.

And the hound keeps calling
As it used to know our names,
But it can't recall them
As its grip did slowlyâ¦

[Solo]

And the hound keeps calling,
As it used to know our names,
But it can't recall them
As its grip did slowly wane.

And the hound keeps calling
(hear it call)
As its world keeps falling.
(hear it call)
And the hound keeps calling
(hear it call)
As its world keeps falling.
(hear it call)
And the hound keeps calling
(hear it call)
As its world keeps falling.
(hear it call)
And the hound keeps calling
(hear it call)
As its world keeps falling.
(hear it call)
And the hound keeps calling
(hear it call)
As its world keeps falling.
(hear it call)
And the hound keeps calling
(hear it call)
As its world keeps falling.
(hear it call)
