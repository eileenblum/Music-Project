Mother see your son, he's been lost amongst liars, in the night alone his direction dire. Father see you sons they are at home amidst liars, enemies of the truth standing taller, higher. Sudden shifts breaking the lines, the cracks that once were easy to find are all hastily smeared out with time, to cover each crime.
When dues are called and one found to appall, the further up then the longer the fall, locked away from sight in a cellar stall or thrown from a windows high upon the wall.
