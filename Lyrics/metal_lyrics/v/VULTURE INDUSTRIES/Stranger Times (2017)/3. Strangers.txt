By hammer, by chisel
By brute force, by missile
You cannot break through this wall
Hammers keep pounding
Barrages resounding
But nothing can bring it to fall

Dim and ghostly in parts
Turns to solid and stark
How it glitters like gold
Kept by the fold
As it passes through temple and palace

It becomes us from birth
As we learn all its words
Shadow keepers abound
One and all bound
To keep painting stranger faces [2x]
While learning the way home

By hammer, by chisel
By brute force, by missile
You cannot break through this wall
Hammers keep pounding
Barrages resounding
But nothing can bring it to fall
Can bring down the wall

Tell, are there bridges over tunnels past?
And will it ever crumble, fall apart
Or will its notion remain?
In every mind a barrier made from words
The very substance to destroy the world
Or mill the future in sand

The distance short
But the way all too far
Looking over might change who you are

In every mind a barrier made from words
The very substance to destroy the world
Tell us who we are now

The distance short
But the way all too far
Looking over might change who you are

Tell, are there bridges over tunnels past?
And will it ever crumble, fall apart

Tell us [8x]

By hammer, by chisel
By brute force, by missile
You cannot break through this wall
Hammers keep pounding
Barrages resounding
But nothing can bring it to fall
Can bring down the wall
