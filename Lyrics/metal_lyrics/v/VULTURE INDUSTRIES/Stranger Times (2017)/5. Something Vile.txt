All of us knew we're fighting for an idea
Towards something grand
Something glorious
Righteous for all of us
A grand future for all man

Most knew we're fighting against an idea
Against something vile
Something nefarious
Vicious, malicious deplorable hell for man

Few of us knew "vicious" had a
Had a mouth, had a tongue to tell you what it felt is wrong
Very few of us knew of its heart
Had a heart, its own eyes, something to recognize us
Even less knew that it might have young
If it had a sister, mother, father or a waiting lover

All knew it had to be destroyed [2x]

Even less knew that it might have young

None knew it seemed just like me and you
None knew [2x]
