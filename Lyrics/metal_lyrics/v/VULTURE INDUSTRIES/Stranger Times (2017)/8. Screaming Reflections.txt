A sound pierces the darkness that covers the hall
Bounces between mirrors covering each of its walls
And the thunder roars

Heads come to gather here in bundles
To grow within its womb
As if spellbound is staring at their second skin
Reflected in the gloom
For every echo of the word its meaning rings more true
And yet new voices join the choir, to sing what we knew
The chamber grows a constant buzz, a dense and compact truth
Rebounding every different thought from armour smooth

Here, in the echo chamber, there are only members
Here, in the echo chamber, all motion (goes) in favour

With each dawn comes the threat of nightfall
Hiding out in plain sight
Here the omens they are plentiful
See them outlined in black and in white

A dangerous place
A dangerous face
A dangerous race
A dangerous space

And the thunder roared

For every echo of the word its meaning rings more true
And yet new voices join the choir, to sing what we knew
The chamber grows a constant buzz, a dense and compact truth
Rebounding every different thought from armour smooth

Here, in the echo chamber, there are only members
Here, in the echo chamber, all motion (goes) in favour

A dangerous place
A dangerous face
A dangerous race
A dangerous space

And the thunder roared [4x]
