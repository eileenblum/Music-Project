Came howling through the night
With righteous bombast
Claimed to be chosen to chase off the darkness
Said in possession of that singular light
To be a beacon in such times of starkness

Through such times of starkness [2x]

Showed us the devil and his vicious gang
Beneath his gloomy canvas overhang
Told us the tales of woe
And tribulations we would undergo

Came barging through the dusk erected his dome
Claimed the anointed task of being our warden
To chase the horror out from every nook
And set the sacred house right back into order

But as the dawn came you could spot his fangs
The sun cloaked by his shadow overhang
And in that shadow lived
The devils it told us not to forgive

Under a worn canvas skin
Within a circle of sin
There dance two terrible twins
Dressed up in different skin, set to win
Control of our hearts and minds
To rule over every kind

Control of our hearts and

Wide open eyes
Empty mesmerized
Follow into perdition
With every step
Goes another neck
A fair price of admission

Wide open eyes
Empty mesmerized
Follow into perdition
With every step
Breaks another neck
A fair price of admission

No room between
Here every colour is clean
Control of our hearts and minds

No room between
Here every colour is clean
Control of our hearts and minds
