Woke up with this nagging sense
That something was wrong
Something quite immense
Anguished I lay staring for some time
With a lingering fear in mind

All hope ends here

After what felt like hours of angst
Like within a cold grip, sweaty sheets turned dank
Compelled I got up to locate its source
To uncover this threatening force
With clammy hands, I put on my shirt
As a gnarly voice, beckoned me
Urgent but carefully I drew towards the call
Slowly I could discern it

All hope ends here
Your world and all you hold dear

There is a wrong stroke on that picture
There is a crack upon the wall
It's all bound to soon unravel
The whole house about to fall
Death upon the threshold
Gently calling through the hall
Our names they are all listed
This is final curtain call

All hope ends here
Midnight draws near [2x]

The minute hand circles the clock
A hangman's axe propelled towards the block [2x]

Listening intently all soon made sense
The words gave new meaning
As my vision changed
Of course, the world doomed under this joke of fiends
And their tangled myriad schemes
So, with eager hands, I put on my shirt
As the gnarly voice beckoned me
To reach out for the hand and turn the clock
Fulfill that secret yearning.

Tick tock [2x]

All hope ends here
Midnight draws near [2x]

The minute hand circles the clock
A hangman's axe propelled towards the block [2x]

All hope ends here
Midnight draws near [2x]

There is a wrong stroke on that picture
There is a crack upon the wall
It's all bound to soon unravel
The whole house about to fall
