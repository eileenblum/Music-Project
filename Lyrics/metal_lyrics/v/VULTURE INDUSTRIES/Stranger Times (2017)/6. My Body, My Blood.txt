A word of praise, of love
A thousand curses from above
A high-pitched-yell to push and shove
A smile to let you off
This is my blood
My body washed off by the flood

Two feet to march or flee
Two eyes to close or see
Two hands to grasp or leave you be
To choke or set you free
This is my blood
My body washed off by the flood

My body and my blood
A carcass washed off by the flood
A word of praise, a word of love
A thousand curses from above
My body and my blood

Two feet to march or flee
Two eyes to close or used to see

My body and my blood [2x]
