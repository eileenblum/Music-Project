We live to work and work to live
In this game of false democracy

Our blood drains in pain in the veins of the third world
Our children are hungry and our people each time more poor
Our indians died explored and enslaved by the strange greed
Our culture was raped by this catholic shit world

Bring down this misery
It is a good reason to fight
Of this false democracy
Our people already is tired

Every empire one day falls and knows the pain and cry
The terrorists are giving an alert another time

Bring down this misery
It is a good reason id fight
Of this false democracy
Our people already is tired
Take a look the world around
War is here to show
Democracy only for the rich
Is the path to extinction

We live to fight and fight to live
In this world full of egoism

Our world is sank in the sea of the man s corrupted mind
Our mind is stolen by the hands of vile control
Our past is burned by the flames of an inner war
Our inner vultures devouring ail our ancient hopes
