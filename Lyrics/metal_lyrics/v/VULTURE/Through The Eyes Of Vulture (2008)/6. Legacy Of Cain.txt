The blood of your brother is still wet in your teeth
Even though time has corroded everything else
But not your flesh. cause the curse lives on you
Seven times seven damnations for the ones in your way

The starving sons feeding tormented souls
Praying to the inner devil to give strength to accept
The path of the damned. the curse of death and blood
Seven times seven damnations for their souls forever

Ashes in your hands
Blood in your mouth
Feel the beast rise
Forever in the same crime

Sealed are the gates to your destiny
Never again shall the light you see

All of the same flesh
All of the same blood
All for the same path
To walk in the hell s road

Bloodbounded new brothers hidding like rats from the men
Hellbounded dark mistery running wild in your veins
Forever waiting the day when the moonlight will not shine
The end of your no-live taking for your own brothers

Sons of darkness run scared for the light
Frenzy fury rise when it s blood time
Waiting for the gehenna to come
Fighting back a never ending jihad
