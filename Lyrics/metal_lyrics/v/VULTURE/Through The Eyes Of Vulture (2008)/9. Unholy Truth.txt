The fall of god
Blasphemed, denied by our sons
Is the end of time
Oppressed, slaved by holy churches

No gods. no masters i follow my way
In the middle of the ashes your church is decaying

The denial of father and the holy son
Is the first way to free your mind
On my way the man is the only survivor
Stronger and above your prays

The search of truth
Scientific, historic about our lives	
Is the way of man
Studied. congestive free of

We must create a new society
Free of churches and your lies
We are the warriors of destiny
And our destiny. we write

Blasphemed. denied by unholy truth
Religions fall
Blasphemed, denied by unholy truth
