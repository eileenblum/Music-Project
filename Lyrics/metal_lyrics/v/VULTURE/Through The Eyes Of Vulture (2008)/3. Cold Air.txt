A sudden heart attack the scape from death
The strange doctor i met beyond fictions and facts

His weird theories seemed insane fantasies
His combinated deceases made he the cold need

And from that cold room i'd return many times
Hearing theories of life without organic life

Artificial life preservation
Facts or hallucinations in the cold air

We re chained to a immortal beast
We re chained to our faith and fears

Where shall our conscience go to when
All our flesh is rotten
Oblivium waits for your turn
Itâs time to be forgotten

Dead many years ago before we met
Having no more places to go far from the wind

Many time has passed when in the middle of october
With a dreadful quickness the horror of horrors

The refrigerator collapsed and i couldn't fix it
Some kind of a clammy trace was traced in the floor.
