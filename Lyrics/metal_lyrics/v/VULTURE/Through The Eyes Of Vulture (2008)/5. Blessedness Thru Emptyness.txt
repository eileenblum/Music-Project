It is a painful and tragic spectacle that rises
Before me this word in my mouth
Is at least free from one superstition...
That it involves a moral accusation
Against humanity

Wage a war to the death against
The deepest instincts of man
His dogmas spring up from pity
Destroy all those dogmas	
Which work for the preservation	
And enhancement of life... 

Useless to god
Blasting and devouring the swarm you represent
Ressurrector of crucified entities
Crippled belief... a foolâs relief

Blessedness thru emptiness
A prime agent in the promotion of human decadence
There is not "god". "salvationâ or the âtrue life"
There is only extinction

Bloody worlds of desires
Shall nothing change through this mass of chaos?
It your conflict
Creations manifest

Eaten from your dead selves
