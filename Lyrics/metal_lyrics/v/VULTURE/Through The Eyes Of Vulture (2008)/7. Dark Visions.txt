Night without breathing, suffocated by fear
Sometimes i hear voices coming from nowhere
Creatures of night flying in my thoughts
I see bodies in decomposition

No one was saved
A lot of them are here in hell

Souls roam in the purgatory
Torture in darkness
Screams are heard from every side
From all the blasphemies said
There are only words and pain left
The end has come

No one was saved
A lot of them are here in hell

Vultures eat the deads
Brains and intestines are devoured with fury
The world holds no more diseases
Blood gushes like tears

There's nothing left to do. the end has come
Some will get away but the ones who stay will suffer
Destruction and sorrow
That's what i see. that's what i hear
Pieces of mutilated bodies float
