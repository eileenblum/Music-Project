Godless are
We raise our flag of war
To manifest our visions of liberty
Unholy way
We fight for democracy
We condemn the slavery imposed for the religions

We are proclaiming our way of life
Our conquests are ours and not of the god
We live to defend our ideals
We are writing our history in a different line
Godless hate

Forged on blood and fire
Exterminating words of salvation
Lies of faith
Vomited in our ears
Feeding us the disdain for the religions teachings

In the search of the knowledge we are joined
We are always learning
In the search of the truth in our lives
We are always fighting

Godless faith
Believing in the hen creations
Contemplating the glory of our acts
Transforming
Our dreams into beauty
Destined to fight to reach our objectives
