Always searching for the death
He cuts the skies in his silent flight
My thoughts follows him
In the sunrise to the east

Where the vulture sleeps
There's no life
From the top of the dry tree
He sees the horizon with no limits
And feel the smells of death

Darked by the time
The vulture follow in his lonely flight
My personality follows him
In the sunset to the west

His smelling is never mistaken
And he lives in his sublime flight
My life follows him
Flying through the infinity
