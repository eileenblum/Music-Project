You see the darkness surrounding your life
Sad memories torment you
You try to find reason for your sadness
Rut you can't see the answers in your front

In this darkness where you re in
Your god don't live

Your nightmare is beginning and will never end

Under the blackest horizon
Straight to hell
The night is under a spell
Your solitude brings
Hallucinations and terror screams

You only lived for you
And now you die alone

You feel the solitude inside of your mind
This is the price to pay for your egoism
You found that with money you could buy anything
Today you know that this is a lie
