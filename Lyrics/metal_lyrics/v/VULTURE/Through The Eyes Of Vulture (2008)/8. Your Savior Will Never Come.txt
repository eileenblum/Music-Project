Free your mind of god

You pray day after day in search of light
To guide your life for you
You ax for god to give you a better life
But nothing happens for you

Day by day
Your life is passing through your eyes
And you re waiting a blessing of god
Day by day

The time i'll not wait for fools
Your savior will never come

Open your mind and see the, world around
Your only salvation are your acts

Your god is dead
And your savior too
A new era has begun
Free of fools like you

You paid month after month to be accepted
As another servant of god
You have fear to sin and to go to hell
But do not see that your life is a hell

Your god is you
Dispense this life of no tomorrow
A new era has begun-free of god
Free of shepherds and sheeps
