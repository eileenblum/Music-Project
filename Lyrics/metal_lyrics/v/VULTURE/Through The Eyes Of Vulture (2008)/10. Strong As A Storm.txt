The world is condemned
To an enslaved end
The power of the blind faith
Ides controlling men

Out not, i will not accept this in silence

Our hate against domination
Is strong as a storm
We live without obligation
We choose our course

The money and the power
In the hands of some hen
That believe they have the right
To decide for all the men

Manipulated as puppets
In a holy tray game
Where the weaks are sent to die
For some men to reign
