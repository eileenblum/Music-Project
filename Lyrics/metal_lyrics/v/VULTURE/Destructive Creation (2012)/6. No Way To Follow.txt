Sons of the Paradise`s maiden
We are following her way
The beginning was in a pretty place
But the future will be the end

All that I see are illusions
A book without words
Into the prophecy`s abyss
The humanity`s decadence

All that I see are illusions
A book full of lies
All that I had was stolen
By the ignorance empire

I can`t see the way to follow
I just see the way to dark

Making an useless technology
Commanded by a violent instinct
We are writing our blood history
It will be our legacy
