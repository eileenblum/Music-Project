The time doesnât stop
It doesn't wait a decision
It passes running over
And leaving everything back

The past is joining
Frustrations and memories
As if it was
An immense garbage sack

Now is the time to fight
And really doing to happen
The difference among
The pleasure of the accomplishment
And the anguish of the frustration

When time flees our existence loses the sense
When time flees the emptiness takes care of fate

Don't wait of the gods
Because the time doesn't wait
It doesn't forgive the complacency
Of the ignorant faith

But the time is for
The ones that catch the opportunities
The ones that mold the future
Abandoning the past

When time flees
We should look at the future
And cross the bridge of the reason
Without looking back

In many moments
The difficulties appear
And without noticing we were back

We forgot that the
Locomotive of time doesn't care
And doesn't wait for you to wake up
