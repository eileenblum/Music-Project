The world is more and more insane
The religious fanaticism worsens every day
In the name of god of emptiness
The life today has less value and sense

Blinded by the lie of a false destiny
They decide for killing

Terrorist murderous disciples
Exploding innocents by faith
Removing the right of living
In the most ignorant way

Children are born learning with their heroes
To play and use weapons and bombs
Without the chance of seeing the free world
To know the world free from masters and gods

Awaiting the salvation
For the accomplished work
Awaiting the salvation
The monkeys of god 

One more bomb explodes
Other lives are removed
More children cry
A new army now is formed

The god of the ignorance is the permission to kill
