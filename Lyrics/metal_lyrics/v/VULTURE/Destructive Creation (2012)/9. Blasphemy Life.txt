In the blasphemy he was born
Breaking the imposed destiny
He was condemned by his different
Vision of the things

He increased looking down
When all looked upward
And felt an immense pleasure
In the opposition

Against
The weak people that made
Everything in the same way forever

He preferred to go until the hell
And to prove the possibilities of a new road

Where the domain is denied
And all of the men are free
He became his own god forever

While the heaven was the desire of them all
He chose go to hell
And he became his own god forever

In the blasphemy he lived
And faced the prejudices
Of those who the mind is alienated

He celebrated their conquests
Because he knew his power
And struggled forever defending their purposes

The possibilities are limitless
Different ways
You choose if you want to do the same
Or to do the difference
