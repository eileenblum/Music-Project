Look for new ways
In a world of lies
It is not an easy task
Because the minds are arrested

The knowledge gets lost
In an addicted world
The possibilities are discarded
If a truth is above all

In this world
Where the lies created a sacred power
Riders look for new ways

In this world
Where the slavery is a sacred desire
Riders fight for new ways

Riders of a new age

If you accept
Other possibilities
You create
New ways

To have your own way
Of seeing the world
Allows you to choose
Your way without rules

Independent of truths
Independent of lies
Other options exist
Enough to want to see

We are knowing new roads
We are showing other roads
We are writing our destinies
