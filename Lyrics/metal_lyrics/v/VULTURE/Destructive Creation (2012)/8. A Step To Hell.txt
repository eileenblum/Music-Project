I kill you in the name of father of son, of holy spirit and now
There isn`t how to come back, we go all together to hell

I kill you in the name of father of son, of holy spirit
Will be that your god is better than mine? But you are not better than me

War. Religion
Death. Corruption
War. Globalization
Death. Exploration

Our laws are not as yours
We kill who kills our sons
Innocents or guilty don`t matter
We go all together to hell

I kill you in the name of father of son, of holy spirit
Our suffering is inside of you. Your security is in our hands

I kill you in the name of father of son, of holy spirit
As you are believing in your faith. We are keeping the hate

War. Production
Death. Destruction
War. Globalization
Death. Exploration
