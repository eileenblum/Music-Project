Gets open the gates to a new age
A new beginning to life evolves
The end of future is nearer
To reborn better destruction is matter

Signs of decadence. We all can see
Destruction eminence. We all can fell
Faith is useless. No future no choice
There will not tomorrow. We will die

Alignment 2012. It`s an imminent fate
Alignment 2012. The extinction of human race

High technology doesn`t work
Against natural disasters
Pain despair in the third world
Human interference cannot prevent

Every day in the news we can see
The nature disharmony
Every day in our lives we can feel
The chaos supremacy
