It is not so difficult to see
It is enough to try
The information is in every place
So give a chance to change your mind

Just see the pain
Just feel the rage
A never ending war in vain
There is no reason
It doesn't make sense
To believe in this great lie

It is not so difficult to see
The interests of the churches
The power to control your mind
And to enrich their safes

Just see the pain
Just feel the rage
A never ending war in vain
There is no reason
It doesn't make sense
To believe in this great lie
Just for money
Just politics
The sin is an instrument of control
Enough to question
Enough to see
And you will discover another world

Falls down
The most bullshit of time
Your god and your dogmas don't make sense
Feel the touch of freedom
And the answers will come
The lies about your almighty god
All falls down

God is a heap of insanity
A great waste of life
