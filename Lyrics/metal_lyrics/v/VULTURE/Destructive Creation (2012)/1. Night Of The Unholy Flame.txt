The night falls
And the memory of the victims takes our minds
Innocents who died
In the name of the knowledge
Burned byÂ religious minds

But today we will rescue the honor of them
And will burn this stupid book

In the night of the unholy flame
We celebrate with the deads
In this night we blaspheme
And drink in the name of the deads

Raise our cups
With the best wine that this world already produced
For the honorÂ of brave
those who reallyÂ revolutionizedÂ this world

But here we are free of this insanity
And today our thoughts will go reign

Science progresses
religionÂ regresses
The evolutionÂ will come
And one dayÂ we all willÂ toast theÂ decline
Of this insane empire

And bibles will fall
In the same flame that had one day been its weapons
