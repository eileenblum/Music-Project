In the line of annihilation
Breathing once more
Life is a game of lucky and chance
Right or wrong choices

Everything is mysterious
Our knowledge is limited
The man is right when he seeks wisdom
And wrong in their certainties

The fear of death brings the faith
The drug of desperates
They need another life to live
But death is the end

Above of your god
Above of your flesh
Under the blade of the death
Life is enough
Don't waste your chance
Under the blade of the death
Life is enough
And there is no other chance

The biology is cruel
Its reason is perfect
We are born, grow, reproduce, and die
And that's what it means

The fear of death brings the faith
The drug of desperates
They need another life to live
But death is the end

Above of your god
Above of your flesh
Under the blade of the death
Life is enough
Don't waste your chance
Under the blade of the death
Life is enough
And there is no other chance

[2x]
Life is easy to accept
Our conscience make us feel special
Just follow your instincts
And don't care for what the others think

The fear of death brings the faith
The drug of desperates
They need another life to live
But death is the end

Above of your god
Above of your flesh
Under the blade of the death
Life is enough
Don't waste your chance
Under the blade of the death
Life is enough
And there is no other chance
