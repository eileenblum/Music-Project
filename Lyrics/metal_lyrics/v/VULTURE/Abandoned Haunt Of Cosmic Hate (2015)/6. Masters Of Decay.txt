Blind masses looking at the sky
Waiting for the answer to your ignorance
Wrong questions lead to despair
Any answer helps to confort the mass

Masters of decay
Lord of kindness
Manipulating embrace
Exploiting the weak to the death
An involuntary void
The greed of the thieves
Conforting the flock
An involuntary void
Salvation for same
Fortune to those
Who sell the passage
To imaginary paradise

Masters of decay
All masquerades
Questions will be denied
To keep the illusion alive
Masters of decay
All masquerades
In desperate searching
Any lie can make sense

Questions will be denied
To keep the illusion alive

In desperate searching
Any lie can make sense

Guided by faith
Through a single road
Lost and empty way
But you must pay the toll

Masters of decay
All masquerades
In desperate searching
Any lie can make sense

Blind masses looking at the sky
Waiting for the answer to your ignorance
Wrong questions lead to despair
Any answer helps to confort the mass

Masters of decay
Lord of kindness
Manipulating embrace
Exploiting the weak to the death
An involuntary void
The greed of the thieves
Conforting the flock
An involuntary void
Salvation for same
Fortune to those
Who sell the passage
To imaginary paradise
