In the middle of the way there was a stone
With flowers around and my name carved in
Sad remembrances of that strange vision
In the middle of the way there was my end

During all the pathway how didn't I see
That strange shadow following me through
My entire life I was deaf, invalid and blind
For not noticing that the strange shadow
Was the vulture flying over my head

The hell is here - The end is near
The more you fear - More it's clear

The killing time and the moving sands
The crawling worms and the things you wait
Worms are only larvas of yourself
The unbroken circle of self-degradation
Learning to crawl - Walk and crawl again

The incapacity - The weakness
The immortality - The nothingness
Everything is the wrong thing to do
Everyone is locked inside the walls of vain philosophies
The world, the cold eyes of disgrace
The ropes, the frozen ropes of mistakes

There's a dead man in the mirror
There's a dead man in the water
There's a dead man in the men
There's a dead man everywhere

There's death across the distance
And deep inside our dreams
There is nothing but nothing
Just emptiness and dark
