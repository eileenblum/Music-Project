Walls of flesh crumbling with the pillars of suffering
In a dead man not walking but concient and still breathing

Your eyes, they're still seeing
Your ears, they're still hearing
Your mind, it is still thinking
While your flesh keep on rotting

Whatever they want with you 
They'll got and it's cruel
Whenever they want to take you
Your body shall go

The pain is always real and is that you feel
There's no way to heal - While time stand still
Your hopes, it steals and your memories it kills
You see your body static - No moves and no acts

You try hard to scream
You can't face the facts
The world keep on moving
With the march of the insects

Locked inside of you - The demons and dead gods
Locked inside of you - The beast within roar
Locked inside of you - Your dreams shall disappear
Locked inside of you - The nightmare is real

You are locked in walls of flesh
You are a prisoner of yourself
In the way of the vulture's path
Never to know what comes next

You are living in a coma - You are sleeping all the time
Fallen buildings, fallen angels - The ones who tried to wake

Fight or die, already dead - Anyway all shall rot
