Insane memories of that morbid nights
Disgusting acts of vultures in disguise
Between insanes and genious there's only a thin line
Behind his glasses his morbid eyes shined

Dr. West fought death - No matter what it cost
Reanimate corpses was what he wanted most

With fanatic efforts his principles he lost
Over heatly humans walking his eyes were frost
The Reanimated nature with inhuman cries
Screamed in anguish to be reborn to light

From the darkness of hell - to the torment of life
The supreme terror and supernatural despair

Frenaly running we saw our future burn
We would never know when the beast would return
The studies continued - Some lessons are hard to learn
With the epidemic fever our chance would come

A chemical reaction - A phisical interaction
Life's interception - Death is not the end
The studies progression - The short time dead connection
Dead by thypoid infection - The dead would bend

Even the Epicurist of the horrible
Would never dream with such a satanic disaster
That Arkhan met
Like a repulsive Afrit - From the depths of Eblis
That carnivorous devil - Acted for the name of death

Six shots at midnight in the pestilent devil
Would never bring back his sanity again
The scream of the dead would reveal his evil
And now I fear his eyes - The collectors of pain

For the chase of corpses the vultures went to war
And a headless fresh corpse we dared to reborn

The war ended - But ours had just begun
And from our deepest dreams - The beast would roar
Dr. West now is dead but not in my mind
The sepulchral legions took away his life

Our time is passing we choose to live or to die
And life is too short we've got no time

Between the earth and sky are much more misteries
Than our poor human mind could ever dream
To the eternal game we're just pathetic figures
We don't know what is real and nothing is what it seems
