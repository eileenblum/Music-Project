Void, soulless, blindness
Mute riot burning deep in me
Ingnorance and poetry
Eternal paradox - abyss of mind

I have wings - But I can't fly
I have no fear - But I can't fight
No turning back - Pay for your sins
The rape of faith - Too late to be saved

I can't see, I can't hear
Imprisoned in the walls of my own flesh
I can't live, I can't be
All the gifts given are taken of me

Why do I live? Are this a joke?
What to believe? There's nothing to trust
Inside ourselves - A parasite worm
Slowly eating us - Our most vain curse

Upon damnations of vile creations
Breathing the air of the dead
Under the cold air the smells of the rot
The end is just where this begun
A vicious circle corroding our minds
No reasons, no beliefs and no hopes
Everything is nothing and nothing can save you
Once you are part of the game (shame)

Emptyness, Nothingness
A vicious void corroding all my own
Hallucinations and damnations
Numb and insane - running to nowhere

Fallen life, obscure fate
Forever decaying with my inner strenght
Miserable, unproud state
Possessed by chaos and forsaken by faith

Nothing to wait - Nowhere to run
There is no hope - The last mistake
There were stones all long the way
There is a stone in the end
And there's no end
