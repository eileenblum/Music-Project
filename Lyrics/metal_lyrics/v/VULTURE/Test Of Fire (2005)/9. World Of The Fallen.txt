Flesh is weak and the world is sick
Its wounds are opened and Its blood we lick
Mysterious silence while your children sleep
Not hiding the treasure the brain they seek

They put you on a coma and slowly eat your flesh

Children of night reborn in underworld
Your flesh is corroded but your soul is not sold
Never to believe in the fairy tales they told
To be dead anytime never to get old

They dropped angels and put their names on you
You drop their buildings and show the shame to them too
Sickness and terror, revenge is coming soon
The world of the fallen will make your world fall on you

Flesh is weak and the world is sick
Your wounds are opened and your blood we lick
We awaked from coma and your torment we seek
The giant is falling and the felt is too deep

We are drunk by your blood, not for your lies anymore

Wandering in the fallen world trying to hide from the cold
We set fire in you and your gold
We burn your buildings and your god

The wanderers spread in your world like a plague infesting the flesh
The sickness bring terror and pain
The hunger brings hate and revenge

Locked inside of you the wanderer calls for your hand
Wake up from the coma and take the blindfold out of your eyes

Wake now or wait tomorrow to burn
Fight now or let your children being stoned
By the world of lies behind the screen
The world of shit inside of your dreams
