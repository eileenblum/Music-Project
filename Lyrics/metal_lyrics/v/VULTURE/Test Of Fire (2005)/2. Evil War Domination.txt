Reborn into the fire
Back from the dead
Legions celebrate your coming

Lord of desires
Malevolencve and death
The profane creation was born

Bringing the terror, he takes the throne
Evil returns to dominate this world

Creating his soldiers
With fire, blood and curse
His legions are ready to war

The call for the ancients
Bring the terror to the world
The empire shall rise to reign

Murders hungry for blood
Satan gives the order
Revenge
Kill the priest
And burn all the churches

Evil war domination
Satanized his children are
Blasphemated are the preachers
The Dark Age has begun

Lies of faith - Inside of me
Hate forever burns through the humanity
