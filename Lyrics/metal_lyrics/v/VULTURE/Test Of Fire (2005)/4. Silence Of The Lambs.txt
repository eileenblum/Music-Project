Aprisioned in a little world
Your life is condamned a void of experiences
Your wisdom is limited a one old book of faith
Where the better of life is out there

All freedom needs to be conquered
With fight and persistence
The sin is a lie, the things are right or wrong
And the wrong way is not live to be free
Open your eyes and see...

Your dreams are arrest inside, the walls of innocence
Your mind is closed to the world
To be dominated just to be ignorant
Find yourself the way to war against your lord

Destroy all the dogmas
And the silence of the lambs will be broken too
The life is too short - Too short to you
Void existence - inheritance that you will leave
Void existence - forgotten in the end
