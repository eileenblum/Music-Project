In every empty season!
I see my light!
Bending one way or another
To fit the life I dreamed of

Things are simply not the same
ThingsÂ are simply!
Not the same!

Amplified are the thoughts that haunt us
Made madmen
Out of walking these circles
To achieve your prophecy!
To achieve your prophecy
To achieve your prophecy

Dirty toilets I've come to know
Come to know
The floors that guide me, where lent to me!
Lent to me
This Smokey bar made way for the
Way for the
Time of open minds

We don't know how to forgive
Your words create this divide
We don't care how to say it, just let go
Take these moments as reason for living
We don't care how to say it, just let go

Handshakes and t-shirts
It's more than industry

Are!!!
Are you!!!
Take jest!

Yyyyyyyyyyyyyyaaaaaeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrr!
The few! Who make it out alive!
Half fun while it is
Still around, still around

We don't know how to forgive
Your words create this still by
We don't care how to save ya, just let go
Take these moments add reason for living
We don't care how to save ya, just let go

Just let go, ohÂ  yeah
