Crack open my head
And let the night flow inside
Don't follow too close
The momentum could slow us down

Keeping us from falling
Falling away
I trip static over silk sheets
Cause I'm falling into you

Hell hath no fury like your fall
No fury like the red lipstick
On the tip of my tongue
The end of the road is your curtain call

Hell hath no fury like your fall
No fury like the red lipstick
On the tip of my tongue
The end of the road is your curtain call
