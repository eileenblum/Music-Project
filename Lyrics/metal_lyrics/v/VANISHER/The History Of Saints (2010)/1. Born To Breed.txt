The evolution of!

Walking with the dead
Can't handle the thoughts
Dreams of a happy lifetime

So sour
So stoned
Broken down!

Walking like the Dead
The Cloak of revenge
Grind of a happy lifestyle
I'm born
To breed
Nothing more!

Your kingdoms fortresses will fall away
No more comfort
Your beating hearts will burst inside
Paper thin walls can't hold these promises
For your comfort
Our beating hearts will pass you by

Walking with the dead
Can't handle the thoughts
Dreams of a happy lifetime

So sour
So stoned
Broken down, down

Walking like the dead
The cloak of revenge
Grind of a happy lifestyle
I'm born
To breed
Nothing more!

Your kingdoms fortresses will fall away
No more comfort
Your beating hearts will burst inside
Paper thin walls can't hold these promises
For your comfort
Our beating hearts will pass you by

And we will populate and populate
Until each corner of the world
Is made a farmland
And then we consume!
And then we consume!
Â Â Â 
Walk to the end
Out where they stand?
Don't listen to
All the doubts
You're fed

Running out of time
Running out of time!

Your kingdoms fortresses will fall away
No more comfort
Your beating hearts will burst inside
YEAH!

Your kingdoms fortresses will fall away
No more comfort
Your beating hearts will burst inside

No more comfort!

Paper thin walls can't hold these promises
For your comfort
Our beating hearts will pass you by

Your kingdoms fortresses will fall away
No more comfort

Running out of time!

Paper thin walls can't hold these promises
For your comfort

No more comfort!

Your kingdoms fortresses will fall away
No more comfort
