My destination will be the same as hers
I will not wait for patient gods
To bring anyone back
It looks unlikely!
It should have visited her
And make her strong again
Instead I pretend nothing relevant exists

I just know that time was wasted
If I could do it again
Would things change a bit?
I'm positive these questions are endless!

And when the sun falls from the sky
Can we say we gave it all
Don't say goodbye
Goodbye

Did I do right and see her through
Did I do right and see her through
Did I do right and see her through
Did I do right and see her through!

This night! Is monstrous!
Played out like a movie
Without straight teeth and bills to pay!
Just another unwinding day
With constant questions mixed in my head

Mixed in my head!

Another unwinding day!

And when the sun falls from the sky
Can we say we gave it all
Don't say goodbye
Goodbye

Close your eyes and sleep, tonight
I'll be back soon
Don't you worry
There will be another time

And when the sun falls from the sky
Can we say we gave it all
Don't say goodbye
Goodbye!

And I know I took it for granted
That you'd always be by my side
Don't say goodbye
Goodbye
