Just like the ocean crashes down on this place
These forces are devoid of reasoning they way we think

In the blink of my third eye!
What's left of love exploded!
Shreds of blood and jealousy
Are everywhere! Are everywhere!
Are everywhere and in closing!

In a moment you will soar and a handful will soon follow
You down this road that will carry us home
In a moment you will see it's a harder pill to swallow
Your pride gets heavier every day

Hearts will cry out
Find a way to carry me back home
Live today for now
It will change, it will change

Hearts will cry out
Find a way to carry me back home
Live today for now
Will you listen?

To smother! To smother!
Whatever's left!

GO! Ride! INTO ETERNITY
On a pale horse with lit with whorish dreams
GO! Ride! INTO ETERNITY
On a pale horse with lit with whorish dreams

Hearts will cry out
Find a way to carry me back home
Live today for now
It will change, it will change

Hearts will cry out
Find a way to carry me back home
Live today for now
Will you listen?

Just like the ocean crashes down on this place
These forces are devoid of reasoning they way we think
