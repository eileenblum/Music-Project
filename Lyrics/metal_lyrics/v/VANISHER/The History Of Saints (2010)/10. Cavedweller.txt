We need your attention
This just may be the end
The end of frustration
Or at least my blinking

At least some ease
At least some ease!

God damn I hate these nails
Stuck into my back
Each one is speeding
A meltdown to destruct

My frustration is with everyone I see
I'm slipping-drowning in my hometown!

Always incomplete
Damn it listen to me
Trying and trying again
Until the cycle repeats

Always pressure builds
I now hate everyone
I can see my dreams
And they are seeming rather weak
Compared to the lives
Of mid twenty year olds

Smeared across my TV!
I'm seeming rather bleak
It's time for solitude
Until the world's is redeemed
Of the parasite I am to be!

I've got it stocked deep
For the day I truly go insane, insane!
I can't compete with the world that I live in
Mankind rapes and makes
Institutes out of everything!

Inhaling and gulping
Panic is engulfing!

Inhaling and gulping
Panic is engulfing!

Smeared across my TV!
I'm seeming rather bleak
It's time for solitude
Until the world's is redeemed
Of the parasite I am to be!

Smeared across my TV!
I'm seeming rather bleak
It's time for solitude
Until the world's is redeemed
Of the parasite I am!
