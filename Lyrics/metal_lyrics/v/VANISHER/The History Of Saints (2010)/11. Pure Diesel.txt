An awkward angel has wept
Watching me
Walk the world so bitterly
A waste of breath
An effort less
A tasteless one at that?

And I sunk deep
Until the mattress made a coffin for me

And I sunk deep
Until the mattress made a coffin for me

Wake me up
Made a coffin for me!

Wake me up
Made a coffin for me!

I don't want to see you cry
Don't care to ever see you cry
This life is still yours tonight
This is our only chance

Wake me up
Made a coffin for me!

Wake me up
Made a coffin for me!

And I will walk to the next
9-5 with the stride of royalty
Nothing is beneath me
What my rot and breed!

I don't want to see you cry
Don't care to ever see you cry!
This life is still yours tonight
This is our only chance!
Please don't keep wasting your time
I don't want to see you cry
Don't care to ever see you cry!

Wake me up
Wake me up

This!
The endless drones of days to come!

This!
The endless drones of days to come!

Wake me up!
Made a coffin for me!

I don't want to see you cry
Don't care to ever see you cry!
This life is still yours tonight
This is our only chance!
Please don't keep wasting your time
I don't want to see you cry
Don't care to ever see you cry!
