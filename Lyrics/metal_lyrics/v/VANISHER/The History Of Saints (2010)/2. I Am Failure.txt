RAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!

I am the wasted existence
That you fear you'll become
Don't give in to this- It eats you up

I hate my job
And have no drive to do anything great
My sister is laughing at me
Because god is nowhere to be found
They are nowhere to be found!, in this town!

She is the only one I am to impress
I am lost again
I guess it'll stay this way
It may only be days (before this seems old to me)
She is the only one I am to impress
I am lost again
But I'll soak it in and I will take what's coming

Call, for help
Call, for help!

Absorb all the needed self pity
To make me shut the fuck up
Only a remainder that happiness is always short lived
All the wrong reasons push me
I wanted to feel again (and it was granted)
All the right ones kept just out of reach
You should have just shut the fuck up

She is the only one I am to impress
I am lost again
I guess it'll stay this way
It may only be days (before this seems old to me)
She is the only one I am to impress
I am lost again
But I'll soak it in and I will take what's coming

Take what's coming!

I am! the wasted existence
That you fear you'll become!

When the sun goes down
On the last day of my life
You'll know the reasons

She is the only one I am to impress
I am lost again
I guess it'll stay this way
It may only be days (before this seems old to me)
She is the only one I am to impress
I am lost again
But I'll soak it in and I will take what's coming
