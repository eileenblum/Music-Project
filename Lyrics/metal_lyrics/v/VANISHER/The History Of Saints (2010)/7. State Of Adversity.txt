You are the fuck who broke the rules
You were above them
Who's head I soon enough will crush
Into manners for underestimating
The timid ones
We are the violent and misunderstood
But who would ever know?

I am an evil thing
Truly undeserving of this! political seat
Pure animosity for any one man
Who's weaker than me

I am an evil thing
Truly undeserving of this! political seat
Pure animosity for any one man

I think it's time! to puncture everything!

Everything!
Everything!

Paromaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!
