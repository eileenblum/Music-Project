Our most beloved
Thrown high above the rest
They're loved by all to see
Never demons festering
Every being of faith or celebrity
Had to climb the ever growing giving tree!

Back and forth we play this game
With a million and one memories
You had the full trust
Of all who would pray

There will come a reckoning
Raise your voice to the world
Don't let the whispering
Of these lies to be heard

Desperate to invent or evolve
The mad's mistakes helped save us all

By chance or bi-polar
Which they thrived the most
The scale of bad to great became nonexistent!
Evolve from insanity! To the norm
It's important we keep some boundaries, boundaries!
Of how normal you are
Of how normal you are to keep things satisfying

I'm not a so long thrown high, the boundary!

There will come a reckoning
Raise your voice to the world
Don't let the whispering
Of these lies to be heard

There will come a reckoning
Raise your voice to the world
