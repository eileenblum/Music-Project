I'm sick of dealing the same hand
All of the time
I run the race while you run me over
Feel the stress overcome
Every cell that I call my own
Felt the walls closing in
On this cell that I call my home

Do we live to die?
We live to tear each other down
Oh god- why won't this mad
Pathetic world just let me out

Take all of these words as testament
I will not live in fear
Nothing has the strength to hold me
Keep running in circles
So dizzy from the hate but forced to stand

Keep running in circles
So dizzy from the hate but forced to stand

But forced to stand
But forced to stand!

Do we live to die?
We live to tear each other down
Oh god, why won't this mad
Pathetic world just let me out

Oh let me out
Oh let me out!
Oh let me out!

Why can't you listen to this side
It's not all so black and white
I can't stop you from still trying
It's your time to make things right

Why can't you listen to this side
It's not all so black and white
I can't stop you from still trying
It's your time to make things right

I won't march for you
And your fucking army
Sent to destroy everything
That I hold so
Hold so fucking dear
