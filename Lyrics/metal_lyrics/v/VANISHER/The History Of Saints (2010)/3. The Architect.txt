Dangerous!
The devils game we play with empty women!
Of all types
Of all types
- And this is my side!

I threw away all my love for human kind
After you
Only few close to home can trust me
And I swear it's not me it's you
Who made this monster rage

Will this turn around
And bring back something
Well we have waited
Waited for nothing
What is the problem that we share
I am? I am?
What is the problem that we share
I am? I am!

I smoked and dosed those years away
I fell asleep while bouncing off a median
I wished for this
My stupidity is never forgiven

Will this turn around!
And bring back something
Well we have waited
Waited for nothing
What is the problem that we share
I am? I am?
What is the problem that we share
I am? I am!

Wait for me to arrive
Prepare the ashes tonight
Tonight we bleed this lie
The faithful wait in silence
Listening for your cries tonight
Tonight we bleed this lie

Waste is the! Only way! to describe!
The modern relationship

What is the problem that we share
I am? I am?
What is the problem that we share
I am? I am?

What is the problem that we share
I am? I am!

You made this monster rage
