Broken world â distorted notion about our lifes
Wrest from life the last sheet
And let crying hearts
Not to want, to believe that too late
Powered that be
As a god among slaves

And kneeling man talking to the effigy of steel
Why all your life of memory that never happened
Spiritual violence of the weakly minds
Obey under God and be one of his whores
I hear them rejoice now when you die...

OBEY UNDER GOD AND BE ONE OF HIS WHORES

We have no fear
Our time had come
You shamefully kneel and pray with head bowed down
All bibles written by the human race
When time has ended you all will die with disgrace

Hatred on adrenaline
Passion of the freedom
Effrontery!

And kneeling man talking to the effigy of steel
Why all your life of memory that never happened
Spiritual violence of the weakly minds
Obey under God and be one of his whores


Broken world â distorted notion about our lifes
Wrest from life the last sheet
And let crying hearts
Not to want, to believe that too late
Powered that be
As a god among slaves

My voices inside telling me it is your turn to cry
Inner demons take all control
I hear them rejoice now when you die..
