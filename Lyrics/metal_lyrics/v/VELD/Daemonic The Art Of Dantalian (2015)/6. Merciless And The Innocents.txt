Celebrate the day of my sorrow
Enjoy by time of my depression
Smoldering flame of my fucking love
Scrutinity of your destination have no effect

I am in pain
Reprisal will come

You show me your true face
My extraordinary hatred to you
Now it's my way of answers
You show me all filth of your lies
Structures of your false feelings
Always to fuck with a smile
Disease of the catholical prostitution

Power of crucifixion
Hang up all your sins
And power of crucifixion
Will forgive your effrontery

You show me all filth of your lies
Structures of your false feelings
Always to fuck with a smile
Disease of the catholicall prostitution

Agonize along with me...
To feel all my misery...

Power of crucifixion
Hang up all your sins
And power of crucifixion
Will forgive your effrontery

I am in pain
Reprisal will come

You show me all filth of your lies
Structures of your false feelings
Always to fuck with a smile
Disease of the catholicall prostitution

Power of crucifixion
Hang up all your sins
And power of crucifixion
Will forgive your effrontery
