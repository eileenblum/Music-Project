All my demons inside
Slowly it's transforming me into a beast
Fatal attraction like endless putrefaction
Your existence will be terrible because of my broken Life
And sink in its God, which can not you to help
Purest blood await the prophets
Sin after sin in Her eyes

You are a fake and I know the truth
I live my life in total sin
The highest level of ecstasy
Christians souls cry â the sweet sound of torment

I will conquer this plane of existence
Mindless words
Foolish action
That to hold who loved
ÅÃ® feel thÄº insult inwardly me
A lord so full of shit
No more feeble christians ever will reign

You are a fake and I know the truth
The end of your life
The highest level of ecstasy
Christians souls cry
No more feeble christians ever will reign

You are a fake and I know the truth
I live my life in total sin...
The highest level of ecstasy
Christians souls cry â the sweet sound of torment
Live since want you or live since want I
Take you and use you
Lose you I forget you...

Betrayal by those who blind
Religion as opium for mankind
The utter destruction of light â the end of your life
Mindless sheeps, followers
Dismay in this lifes
Live since want you or live since want I
Take you and use you
Lose you I forget you...

I will conquer this plane of existence
Mindless words
Foolish action
That to hold who loved
ÅÃ® feel thÄº insult inwardly me
A lord so full of shit
No more feeble christians ever will reign

You are a fake and I know the truth
The end of your life
The highest level of ecstasy
No more feeble christians ever will reign

We shall overcome all in this world of contradiction...
