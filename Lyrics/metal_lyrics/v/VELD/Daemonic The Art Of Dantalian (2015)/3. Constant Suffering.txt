In eternal misery
In constant suffering
I shall get through this life
Without fate, without future, without fear
The end of all days
The end of all times
In a maze of sin and filth
The painful angels scream
Sweet music to my ears

Feel how the demon seed ejaculate inside
I've chosen the devil because I like to be free
Now I keeper of all hatred and anguish
And every nail through his flesh is delivered by me

BE WITH ME AND YOU WILL BRING TO ME THE HEAD OF GOD!

Look deep in my eyes
Your God he is nothing
I know your name and your god I do hate
Now close your eyes my love and forever you'll be mine
Be with me and you'll bring to me the head of God

My flames of hatred burn and I believe in me and only me
I've made my choice and I'll prove you wrong

In eternal misery
In constant suffering
The end of all days
The painful angels scream
Sweet music to my ears

I curse all light and saint
Demonstration of power and pride

YOUR GOD HE IS NOTHING...

In eternal misery
In constant suffering
The end of all days
In constant suffering

Look deep in my eyes
Your God he is nothing
I know your name and your God I do hate
Now close your eyes my love and forever you'll be mine
Be with me and you'll bring to me the head of God

Look deep in my eyes â Your God he is nothing

In eternal misery
In constant suffering
I shall get through this life
Without fate, without future, without fear
The end of all days and your God I do hate
In a maze of sin and filth
