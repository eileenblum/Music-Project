Someone wails from pain
Someone roar from pleasure
Malice, anger and hatred after purest love
Questions are decided before I've a chance to think
But change has finally come...

I shall be your life and your life shall be for me
When reality is nothing more
Perfection of my nature
Perfection of the freedom
Life will show you who you are and where your fucking place

You will be alone to stand in a shame
You is a past
Trample all my love and this will be the day of your pride...

Love transform in hate
Love changed in emptiness
Look at me
I lie dead silent in a casket
With weeping and laughter
with loathing and love
Sincerity and purity transform in duplicity and dirt

I pray for your emergency
I flourish in your pain
You have become what you abhor
Understanding is now too late

My past and my present
Complexity of life
Through this pain I must endure
In this rage I shall remain
Scars of my soul forever
Live further as a whore and Bastard Son will release your sins

My past and my present
Complexity of life
Her insincere tears fall from her lying eyes
I shall remember and curse this all my life

Love transform in hate
Love changed in emptiness
Look at me
I lie dead silent in a casket

Someone wails from pain
Someone roar from pleasur
Malice, anger and hatred after purest love
And now your pride â feeble mind of the greatest whore...
