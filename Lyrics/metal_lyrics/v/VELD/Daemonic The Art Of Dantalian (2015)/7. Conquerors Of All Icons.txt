Remain in private with it's raping soul
Which more do not understand me
Who tell you about the "truth" and about your sense
Liquid stories about your God and saviour

Promises of purification of the soul?
And everlasting life?
I see through the book of lies
Humanity so poisoned
And on the last day it will destroy yourself...

They will be killed in an agonizing death
Condemn all the sinners and they will be magnified
I am the way to your eternal lust
And bring this world into eternal darkness

Lost time â wounded soul â overheated flesh
And not hope that Jesus will help you
And will you live in eternal misery
And will come grief to your children

I am the way to your eternal lust
And bring this world into eternal darkness
Lost time, wounded soul in eternal misery
That becomes by me

I see right through all of your lies
Bound together by blood and by faith
Under the guise of a holy existence
I must sustain this diversity that becomes me

Drowning in blasphemy
It is my will
I devour your lives
Tranquillity transform in desire to kill

Remain in private with its raping soul
Which more do not understand me
Who tell you about the "truth" and about your sense
Liquid stories about your God and saviour

And not hope that Jesus will help you
And will you live in eternal misery
And will come grief to your children

I am the way to your eternal lust
Condemn all the sinners and they will be magnified
I see through the book of lies
Humanity so poisoned
And on the last day it will destroy yourself...

Promises of purification of the soul?
And everlasting life?
