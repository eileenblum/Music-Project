Perfect destroyer -- self-parasite
Feeding upon the tears of our kind
Nothing sacred is left inside
Just a persistent blank nightmare

We should have pursued our evolution
Worked restlessly to develop our potential
Lived to achieve the perfection of the whole
But along the way, something went wrong

We have separated ourselves from the obvious streams
That before were visible to our open eyes
Therefore doomed to clean our filth
In self-inflicted ignorance

Unity dislocated
Individuality is a human suicide
There is another way
In the atom inside

The distance is now killing our brain
Bringing its last disease to life
Materialized by our collective fears
A genocide born in our thoughts

Unity dislocated
Individuality is a human suicide
There is another way
In the atom inside

And in time
Weâll all have human blood on our hands
And weâll wash away our smiles with the dirt from the graves
When weâll reach the point of no return
And fragment our soul
