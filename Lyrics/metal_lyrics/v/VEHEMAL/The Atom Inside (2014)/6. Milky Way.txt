This dimension: emerging black spiral
I gave birth to its damnation with you
Scratch my spine to the core
Right through my hatred
Iâll still want to pour the Milky Way on your face

My universe collapsed a long time ago when I stormed my life into another
Crushing the particles of every stream
Doomed to be reborn again in time

The flow of your soul crashes in the gates that you once wished were closed
Your mind is a wasted land - time doesnât exist - weâll have to keep pretending

My universe collapsed a long time ago when I stormed my life into another
Crushing the particles of every stream
Doomed to be reborn again in time

I gave birth to our damnation with all of you pretenders

Drown yourself in the pool of the Universe to be reborn again
When galaxies die and your body implodes
To resist is to face in front of yourself and your kin
My never ending vengeance

Look at your creation - the curtain falls again
