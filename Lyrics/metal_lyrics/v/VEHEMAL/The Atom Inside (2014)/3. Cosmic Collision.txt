You are inconsistent
A fading star engulfed by the expansion of the Universe
No more than a wind dying in the stratosphere
A suffocating cell on a planet without oxygen

Your world will meet will meet its Andromeda
A billion light-years inside your misery
This unavoidable cosmic collision
Will annihilate you internally
The ultimate cancer rampaging in your veins
Feeding on your disillusion

A mere matter of adaptation
Destroyed your chance to reincarnate
You murdered your dreams
Just to never have to assume them

How can you ask something from me?
Usurper of destiny
Parasite infesting my life
Be ready for your extermination

Your world will meet will meet its Andromeda
A billion light-years inside your misery
This unavoidable cosmic collision
Will annihilate you internally
The ultimate cancer rampaging in your veins
Feeding on your disillusion

It should have been you
To carry the stars and destroy the sun
Yet you fractured your own universe
Never able to coexist with another life form

Why did you have to punish me?
Disrupting the atom inside
The life force maelstrom
Swirling toward infinity

Death wasnât the end for me
Murderer
Torments awaits you
My love
As I send my last tear
And as I send this galaxy
For you
