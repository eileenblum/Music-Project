Oceans melt inside
Denying redemption
Human nature collapse in its greed
Cosmic hell confirm
Our expectation
No purpose left in satisfying our need

The collective weakness to show any determination
Transfigured madness
Subsequently take the lead
No possible rebirth after this ultimate extinction
A dark hole engulf the last hope to succeed

I feed you with my sins
My atomic waste
My empty vessel
So you can feel the ocean

We have the power of the storm
Thundering our will into your soul
We have the strength of the sun
Burning your vitality and life
We come to avenge the Earth

We bring the hatred for the final destruction
Even thorn sky spit on you rain of disgust
All the warnings and signs for more adaptation
Couldnât overcome your unquenchable lust

Mountains implode
Crashing our realizations
Continuous flow of heredity turning to dust
There is no point in such
A display of submission
Your carcass wonât be able to beg us

Denial of what is yet to be
Betrayal of the past
What is left in your insanity?
A present that wonât last

We have the power of the storm
Thundering our will into your soul
We have the strength of the sun
Burning your vitality and life
We come to avenge the Earth
