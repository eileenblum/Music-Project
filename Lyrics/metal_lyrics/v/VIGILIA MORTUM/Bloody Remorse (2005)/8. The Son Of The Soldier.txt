You will stronger than me,
You will steely.

Years of fighting,
Teaching my son.
Have not passed for him,
For him in vain.

My Son,believe me,
You will stronger than me,
My Son,believe me,
You must be as the steel.

No emotions,
He is ready for invading.
No compassions,
He is ready to see death.

I know,He will Fight,
Even If It very Hard.
I know,He will Fight,
Till the last drop Of blood.

You will stronger than me,
You will steely.
