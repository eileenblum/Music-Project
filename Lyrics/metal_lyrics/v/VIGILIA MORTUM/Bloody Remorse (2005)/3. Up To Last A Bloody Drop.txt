I the machine for destruction,
I the machine for creation,
I'm real the power explosion.

I feel that I shall,
Always stay in fight.
And let everyone,
Speak to me, that I am a fire.

Yes I the Fire,
But only in Fight,
I understand who I am.

I the machine for destruction,
I the machine for creation,
I'm real the power explosion.

And again there comes night,
My nerves are similar to steel ropes,
I get ready for fight,
Up to last a bloody drop.

I the machine for destruction,
I the machine for creation,
I'm real the power explosion.

Thirst for fight it's my life,
I feel rush of forces.
The Fiery liquid it is my blood,
I feel it's in my muscles.
