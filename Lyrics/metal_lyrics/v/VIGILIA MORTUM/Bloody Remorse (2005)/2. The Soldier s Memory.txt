I remain one,
And I recollect this Fight.
I close my eyes.
And I hear this Cry.

Blood, Dirt, Death
I watched before my eyes.
Fear, Scream, Ache
I watched before my eyes.
Fight it's only Fight
Fight it's only Fight

Commander gives order,
"Stand one's ground".
And we as the Hellraisers,
We shall go ahead.

I can't sleep at night,
This Fight is forever,
Cut deep in my Mind,
It is the crazy Fight.

I don't need in rewards,
Because I not a Hero.
I want simply to live,
Because I simply the Zero.

Commander gives order,
"Stand one's ground".
And we as the Hellraisers,
We shall go ahead.

And again I can't fall asleep,
Again "the War is near".
And again I hear a lock click,
Again I am not a Hero.
