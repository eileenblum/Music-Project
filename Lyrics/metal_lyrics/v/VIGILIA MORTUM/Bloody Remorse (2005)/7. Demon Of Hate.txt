Demon of hate
Searching for his next prey,
Predator with no remorse,
It is Military killing machine
Siege of power - in your land,
Too many problems - for you to understand,

I do not have songs which will return your life.
I do not have songs to create it.

You pay for your salvation,
You have to hide your the pain,
No surrender or capitulation,
You a slave of the State.

I do not have songs which will return your life.
I do not have songs to create it.

Demon of hate
Searching for his next prey,
Predator with no remorse,
It is Military killing machine.
Soldiers of their power - you never question why,
You go to suffer - you go to die.

I do not have songs which will return your life.
