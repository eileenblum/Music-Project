They have trained this boy to kill.
And kill someday he will.
They have trained this boy to die
and ask no questions why

You take a look at this boy,
he's a military man.
You take a look at this boy,
he's crying.
You take a look at this boy,
he's a soldier.
You take a look in his eyes,
they're colder.

You take a look at this boy,
He is obey the order.
You take a look at this boy,
He ready to the slaughter.

He's a killer,
He's a killer,
He's a killer, Yeah.

You take a look at this boy,
he's a military man.
You take a look at this boy,
he's crying.
You take a look at this boy,
he's a soldier...
You take a look in his eyes,
they're colder.
