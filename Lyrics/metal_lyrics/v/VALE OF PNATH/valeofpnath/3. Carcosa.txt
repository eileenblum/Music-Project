..."for there be divers sorts of death - some wherein the body remaineth and
some it vanisheth quite away, with the spirit, this commonly occurreth only in
solitude (such is gods will) and, none seeing the end, we say the man is lost,
or gone on a long journey - - which indeed he hath but sometimes, it hath
happened in sight of many, as abundant, testimony showeth. In one kind of death
the spirit also dieth, and this it hath been known to do while yet the body was
in vigor for many years. Sometimes as it veritably attested it dieth with the
body, but after a season is raised up again in that place where the body did
decay"
