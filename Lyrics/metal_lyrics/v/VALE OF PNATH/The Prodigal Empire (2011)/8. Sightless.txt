Live as he lived, suffer as he did
Feast upon these lies like a peasant fed ambrosia
A leech on the wound, verminous knowledge unfiltered yet still consumed
Persecute those who have denied, escaped, exposed this divine prison
Worship he who embraced the wrongdoers; become an arbiter of the noble
Teach humility and practice arrogance

Praise peace and annihilate the wicked
A sheltered life insured by blind faith
This policy defined by the interpretations of your clergy
Bringers of truth or a deceitful disease?
Construct this your pedestal-- high upon it you rest
Deluded from the moniker "sinner"
The blind lead the blind into the depths of an exit-less pit

Suffer as he did
Suffer for your god

Shunned from the diversity of the light
Cast down to be shackled by vague prophecies
You've taken false hope and enforced it on the free

Suffer as he did
Suffer for your god

You've sheltered your eyes from the sun and become blind
Saved from your sins by your effortless conviction

[Lead - Mikey]

Ask for forgiveness so thou can be cleansed, now able to look down upon the miscreants

Praise your idol, praise your church, praise your priest
You will always be sightless
You believe he died for you, but would you suffer for him?

[Lead - Mikey]

Through the centuries you have fallen from your grace
Created senseless violence from a prophecy of peace
Forged a cult religion with a focus on true greed
Become so diseased you can never be freed

Hierarchies of insolence control the flock of sheep
Sinners turn to preachers then to spreaders of disease
The bodies of the dead build your towers to the sky
A good word turned to poison by your infinite lies

Sightless
