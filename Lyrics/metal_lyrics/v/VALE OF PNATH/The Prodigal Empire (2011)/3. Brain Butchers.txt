Dream or reality
Your memories hide what you knew
Gone, one life â enter a new perception
Enter a new perception
No hope for a dying world
To stop this beast, you must set society free
Remain in permanent psychosis
Everything you knew â everything thought was true â is false.
Emancipate the suffocating
Only then will your mind be your own
Only then will you destroy this throne

Red sand, breathe in; your lungs collapse
This vacuum craves your flesh (permanent psychosis)
No air, breathe in; the body dies
The answer lies within the ruins

Never trust our human nature; death will reveal the key to life
The impure deviations of society shall wallow in their filth
Their lives mean nothing now (their lives mean nothing now)
You must wake from this delusion; save yourself and free your mind
Deeper you fall in the infinite depths of this false world
No, you must stay; this is real
Hundreds of lives depend on you
Destroy this deceiver and your treacherous love
This vile creature that was sent from above

No air, breathe in; the body dies

These blood-soaked floors a price to pay
For the freedom of these mutant slaves
Bleed the world; rid the plague
Drain your veins and stain the soil red
Uncover the tombs of the dead
The bones will lead the way

This closed world shall only be spared with the embrace of the atmosphere; be salvaged by an open mind

Start the reactor

A traitor among the faithful few
A newcomer to the world of the doomed
Deep in the ruins you shall find the machine
With its inception the red shall be blue
With its inception the slate is wiped clean
