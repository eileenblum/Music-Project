[Music by Vance Valenzuela and Alan Paredes, Lyrics by Ken Sarafin]

A hideous glow in the cerulean sky
A messenger; evil forebodes this dim twilight
A world for the soulless, callous, vacant lives
A void that God forgot â a gift to the sleeping mind
He walks alone and the feral walk with him
A solemn presence unaware and an absent requiem
He despises those who suffer; those who are awake
This land shall remain in slumber; souls for him to take a nightmare in the devil's name

Now lost, they shall be lost forever
The lost will roam this wasteland
For what they seek cannot be found
There is no solace here
No hope from this forsaken, sour ground

This he knows; one fleeting thought
That at this moment he is naught
Never redeemed; Forever they rest
Forever their sleep; An infinite eclipse

[Guest lead â Malcolm Pugh]

Cursed is this silent world
A dream that has no end
Abandoned in the nil
Omitted from the blessed

Woe this gift to the sleeping mind
A feast for the ethereal
Paradise for the specters
An obscurity left in silence

Woe this gift to the sleeping mind
A feast for the ethereal

Eternally imprisoned in this barren illusion
Cognizance left a ghost

Forever they shall sleep

A paradise for the specters
An obscurity left in silence

Forever they shall sleep
