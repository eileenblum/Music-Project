Atop gleaming stone pillars, sanguine refractions of light
Crimson wound skies caress the jagged earth
And the wind beckons me
A darker landscape shrouds my mind, calling me closer
The dreamscape defies time, a distant rumor

A land forgotten

History is this place
Wretched visions beset tortured thoughts
Towards the blackened fog I wander

With my last glance I wield a smirk
The voice fades, as does the sun
Into the dreamscapes unknown
Following shadows and visions that I've been shown

History is this place
Wretched visions beset tortured thoughts
Towards the blackened fog

Caverns of moss in the distance
Shrieks echo and distort movement of shadows

All the ever present inhabitants gather, like ash to flame
Leading me closer to what I desire
Greeted with purrs of remorse and endless gloom
A faction long lost and sheltered by vines
A ritual in place, stone stacked side by side
