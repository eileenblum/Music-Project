Terror shrouded in smoke.
Searching for the one who will bring meaning to it's haunting.
Grip their flesh, pull it off, gnaw the muscle
Latch on to the weakened soul and feed

Torturous symbiosis, attuned for a select breed.
Swallow light and joy
When the victim searches for meaning it shall be skewed
Their essence â their life force, removed
The heart will bleed as the veins deplete
And they fade to black with a morbid sense of attachment.

Store the meal and reveal your true form. You will bring many deaths.
Darkness entwined within a fire filled husk. You will bring death [2x]

Lure them in with lavish gestures of deceit
Court them, your charm radiant
Glazed with spirits fine, their blood will satisfy
Indulge upon the nectar â that which gives them life
Gathering of gilded saps reduced to a lavish feast
Trophies and fresh meat adorn my walls and entrails pave the street. Bones used as tools, their skulls have been removed.
Now you see my for what I am. The heart of darkness, a wretch long lost.
