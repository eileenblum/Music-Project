At long last, alone with the one that i adore
Surrounded by a forest impenetrable with ominous allure
Calming fog
Deafening silence cascades through the air
Whisper touches my ear
I scream for the last time

Loss of eyesight
Darkness shrouded in red
Motor function removed
Nerves and tissue dead

My mind intact
Sealed deep inside my captive body
Yet again i hear a whisper
Join us, my lover must die

A scream echoing
The sound of shattering glass
Visions of blood shake my mind
I can feel her presence within the woods

Terror reveals itself
A pale and rotten husk
Unrecognizable, her eyes drip with blood
And her skin as dead as her stare

Knocked down and forced to fight back
Her head removed
The shovel used to execute
Will dig her shallow grave

This must be an illusion
Her corpse dancing, laughing
Showing me what i have done

This must be an illusion
Her corpse mocking
Showing me what i've become

Her teeth gnawing at my hand
Flesh turns black
Destroy the skull to release her soul
Disavow her memory (x2)
