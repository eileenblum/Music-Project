Burial, disintegrated and defiled
Fiends scurry atop the tombs of gods
Rustling their bones
An eternity delayed, rise again
Wrought with dismay - their new fate

Unbound by duty, rampant with purpose
A horde released upon darkened shade
No longer bound by death - aimless lurking on horizon
Tear open the veil - let loose vile treachery
Aeons of oppressed souls pursue revenge
A loyal mindless swarm

Absorb their spirit, devour their plague
Consume the essence of madness
Condensed by hatred - imbued by malice
An infinite torrent of power leeching off my slaves

Disruption caused by unfilled graves
Eruption of eternal hatred

A realm above, cast in light
Extinguished it shall be, cerulean night
Break through the earth, the reign begins
Destruction and disruption caused by undead slaves
Eruption of eternal hatred

A realm above, cast in light
Extinguished it shall be, cerulean night
Break through the earth, the reign begins
Destruction of life feeds my scheme

Pour thy blood, in turn you will be free
A minion left to bleed, tear open the veil
Wound the fabric of life, a banshee born from deceit
The product of a hideous plight
