Flesh removed, an attempt to lure its prey
Birds and maggots feast
Whispering reveals of an untold evil
Invisible through the trees
Earth spread upon flesh, a trap of the mind
Spikes of the earth he will rise
A man against an unknown hunter - a master of disguise

The hunt will end
Lured by trickery, a colossal entity
A creature, a body he will rend
A creature, a life he will end

Track the scent of blood
A nightmare so vicious
While wandering from rock to rock
Sharp instincts for the hunt
Lurking through lost land
Luring prey into their death
As the bones are piled high
Age old stories told once more

Covert entity
Veiled in treachery
