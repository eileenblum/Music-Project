A planet infested with doom
Gorging, swarming, writhing
An attack on the world we reside
And yet we think we are supreme, that we are gods
A menace lurking in space will prove us wrong
War is upon us

Kill them all, remove their limbs, destroy the brain stem

The first encounter approaches
Ruined nerves meet adrenaline
Deployed unto a ruined world, the frenzy begins
Nuclear attacks hold them back for a time
A horde emerges, a panic inducing sight 
Load, engage, fight
Reload, engage, die
Kill them all

Divide them we must start anew
War is upon us

Again they strike from above and below
Removing our brains, learning our ways

Scorched flesh, broken will and revenge

An overlord is all that remains, its foresight daunting
Kill it, remove its limbs, destroy the brain
And yet they think they are supreme, that they are gods
A huge mistake for they are wrong

War is upon us

My enemy has me in their grasp
Prodding my mind, seeking my knowledge
Torturous tools, hacking, stabbing
They are the ones in the prophecy
