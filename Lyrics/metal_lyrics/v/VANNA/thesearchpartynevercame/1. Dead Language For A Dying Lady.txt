As her insides are screaming let me out
She speaks as if someone's in the room with her
(someone sits quietly on the ceiling tile)
Still facing the corner with eyes gouged out
These tears of blood fall, for blood is all she's crying now

Her heart beats on
She's just not giving up yet
Though blinded by the devil's touch
She rises above him

She races towards the light
Her heart beats on
She stares death straight in the face... heart beats on
These tears of blood fall, for blood is all she's crying now

As he cuts into her chest
Her heart beats on
She's just not giving up yet
Though blinded by the devil's touch
She rises above him (rise above)
She floats towards the light
The darkness recedes (let me out, let me live again)
In this most desperate hour (she cries)

In this crowded room
With an empty view

Save your goodbyes
We all know it's not the end
