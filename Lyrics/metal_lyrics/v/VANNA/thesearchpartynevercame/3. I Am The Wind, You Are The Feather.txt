This is an open ended sky
with open eyes too tired to look away
Say you'll stand forever by my side
and forever we'll be standing here

The dead still walk, walk the streets
This means war on everyone
You can't hear them lying to us
You can't see their fingers crossed

Let's keep our thoughts on guard this time
We'll keep on moving on
Just don't let them get too close

In the land where the dead still walk, walk the streets
This means war on everyone
You can't hear them lying to us
You can't see their fingers crossed

This is a test
We know our own strength
We'll take the east
and march on

Make our way, burning all our bridges
State by state we march on

And we march on leaving trails of hope behind us
With our hands to the sky
The wind will be our guide
At times like these
To be the last one standing
Hope is all we have left

(To be the last one standing)
