Light it up
A flash so thin
Through a sky so grey
Look away
Our faces turned
Its a plea to the ear
Its a walk to my hands
Its a fall to my feet
To find sympathy
Now you're lost
In the dark
And nowhere to be found
But I know you'll be waiting there for us
His fortunes
Our futures at hand
We light
Light up like cities in the night
Light this
Like a happy scene
Its a set
Its all it takes
To trick our eyes
And fabricate
Honest
Honest goodbyes
Now you're lost
In the dark
And nowhere to be found
But I know you'll be waiting there for us
Our lives light up at times like these
At times
Our lives
Light up like cities in the night
His fortunes
Our futures at hand
We light
Light up like cities in the night
Like rivers
We splinter
You don't have to leave
Run away with me
