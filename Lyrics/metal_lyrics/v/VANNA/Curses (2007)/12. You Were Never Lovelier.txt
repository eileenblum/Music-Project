My amber furnace breathes
I've got an ear to the wall
If we sat forever in this house
The wind would take us
So take me
Ride all night
Like a bullet from a gun [x3]
Get to me
Your eyes don't lie
Take me, take me
Goddamn perfect eyes
Spill the embers
Fan the fire
I'll fill it floor to ceiling
Escape with a price on my head
I'm a wanted man
A wanted man
I'll meet you in the front seat
Headlights off
I'm a fugitive
A victim and
A criminal
We'll make our getaway
Invented colors
To hide us in the dark
Hide us in the dark
