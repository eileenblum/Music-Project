You sing just like
Uncaged birds
Till the trees are ablaze
The scribe licks his pen
Come fly with me
Rewrite our end
Still alive
Still, alive
This is peace
They will never send for us
These walls have taught us
Not to speak
Not to feel
Not to see
Sing me to sleep
Like this is home
Sing for me
While we're alone
Please stay
I need you here, my bird
Dear god
Call an ambulance
You sing just like
Uncaged birds
Still alive
Still, alive
