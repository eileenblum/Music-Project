I speak for generations (sing on)
Sick of procrastination (sing on)
History as an open wound (sing on)
Burn it down, lets start a new

So many times I've wrote down
And yet I still stumble to the ground
Do they know I'm here, do they hear the sound
Of bleeding out loud?

Dig up the earth beneath my feet
Remove the ground tell me what you see
A heart that calls for sincerity
You know you hear this, our final plea

And now the chorus sounds
Heâs bleeding out he's bleeding out

A funeral for dead at heart (sing on)
Dead wrong right from the start (sing on)
But is it me,  foot in the grave (sing on)
No time for feeling brave

So think back to the start
Did we have our chance, or did they pull us apart? 
Are words, a thing of the past?
Don't let them have the last, no!

Dig up the earth beneath my feet
Remove the ground tell me what you see
A heart that calls for sincerity
You know you hear this, our final plea

We are the voice of a thousand, sing on, sing on
To the skies, bring down the heavens, sing on, sing on

We are the voice of a thousand
And you will hear our song!

Dig up the earth beneath my feet
We are the voice of a thousand strong
A heart that calls for sincerity
We are the voice of a thousand strong

Dig up the earth beneath my feet
We are the voice of a thousand strong
A heart that calls for sincerity

So let the chorus sound
