Couldn't stay buried you understand
What good am I as a dead man
I started cursing death from the mouth
So just spit me out
Revival blood bath
Sing it out loud
I'm the great last hope
For the entire world
Dug my way out of the earth
Time to rise, reclaim my worth

Searching for a reason to live again
We're moving forward
And the lives we lead are ours to keep
Searching for a reason in everything
We're moving forward and we'll find our way

Destroy
Destroy rebuild and take control
Destroy rebuild and take control
Oh I'm back to take you underground
Drag you into the hell I found
Once was lost and I still feel bound
Hands like a noose I'll drag you down
Revival blood bath
Sing it out loud
I'm the great last hope
For the god damn world

Searching for a reason to live again
We're moving forward
And the lives we lead are ours to keep
Searching for a reason in everything
We're moving forward and we'll find our way

Once was lost and I still feel bound
Hands like a noose I'll drag you down
Destroy
Destroy rebuild and take control
Drag you down into the hell I've found
