So it begins again.

White light, white heat, and I burnt out
Turning into myself, turned into my self doubt.
Never thought I'd reach a soul,
Or have a say or a voice of my own.

It all seems so hard. We but we've come so far.
Don't look where we were, just look where we are.
It all seems so hard. We but we've come so far.
Just look where we are.

It took leaving my home, and wondering on my own,
For me to see. That my feet had no place on the ground.
Look to the sky. Wipe the dust from my eyes.
I'm alive. I'm alive. I'm alive. I'm alive.

Just try to stay alive.
I've buried you all inside.

All those forgotten notes. Cause all you had was hope.
The one thing that cuts ties, loosens the rope.
I know you're hurt. I know it's hard. But know who's there.
Same shit, same life. Unfair.

With our backs to the wall, there's not chance we can fall.
Climb up, climb out, destroy it all.
With our backs to the wall, there's not chance we can fall.
Climb up, climb out, destroy it all.

Just try to stay alive.
Live, breathe, suffer, bleed, wake up, survive.
