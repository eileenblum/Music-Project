My hands lift to clear my face, a light shines in this empty place.
I hear feet like whispers move. A cold floor in a forgotten room.
My god why I am here? Is this really how I spent my year?
A man controlling everything he sees, just a boy chasing his dream.
Please stay. I can't kid there's another plae to play.
Please stay. But I'll be back around some day,
as my sweat and the crowd does fade.
A panic hits me and I start to shake.
What the fuck am I still doing here?
I close my eyes to drown out fear, open up to see that face.
The one that gave this heart it's place, gave death a break for a while.
The one face that could make me smile.
Please stay. I can't, my love, I have to go away.
Please stay. But I'll be back for you some day,
war on the stage and in my heart.
I feel my body rip apart. I'll take it day by day,
let me hear those words you say.
Please stay, forever remain, forever the same,
You'll be with me always. Always.
