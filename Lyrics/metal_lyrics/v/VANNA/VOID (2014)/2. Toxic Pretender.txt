My eyes have seen no glory, so I ripped them out today
Cause when was the last time I looked at you without looking away?
You fucking disgust me, a legion in my mouth
Teeth inside my hands, I rip my head inside out
What does cancer look like and what is its face?
You can't look it in the eye, what a fucking disgrace
You can be erased, laid to waste
Time ticks on, your hands were made for letting go
I can no longer let you drag me below
I'm sick of writing this down, you'll never read these words
Cross it out, write what you want to be heard
Quick, this motherfucker's at it again
Acting like a corpse can't tell a body's dead
What's the problem? What's wrong with this kid?
I'm sick of catching the same old wind
The air's stale, how long has it been?
One day I woke up and your language was dead
Now all I hear is the voice inside my head
It speaks in tongues I've never learned
Not a sound was heard, you don't get the last word
Your ship was sinking, seems like the captain failed
The tides rip you apart, no more vessel to sail
Undertow, undertow as you let go
Godspeed, I'll fucking see you in hell
You left thinking you left me stranded
But all this time I was the only one standing
I'm the only one, I'm the only one standing
Liar liar, souls on fire
Liar liar, jump back in the fire
