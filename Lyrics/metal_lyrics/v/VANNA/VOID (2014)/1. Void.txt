Holes, inside my broken bones
Decay, I watch my flesh rip away
Space, between the dead and I
Goodbye, farewell to my body and my soul
I've become a black hole, I'm not like them
I can't fucking pretend that the sun's not gone
My sky's all wrong, no floating on clouds
I'm fucking falling down, swallowing everything around
Stare into the great unknown, void
This hell that I call home, void
Darkness all I ever see, void
Welcome to the death of me

With the lights out, it's dangerous
Here you go, chanting entertain us
I look stupid and brainless
Well whatever, just never fucking mind us
Your duty's done and you're drained too
Watch as this black hole consumes you
Void, you become your own black hole
