Now you see us, now you fucking don't
Moving in shadows is our only hope
See my friends, we are forgotten ones
They are the bastards and we are the sons
We are the lonely ones, I thought I told you that
I am who I am and I've got nothing to prove
I'm not alone here, my friends, we all got nothing to lose
We are, we are the ones running through this hollow town
Head high, feet on the ground, broken homes won't break us down
We dream of kingdoms and taking crowns
You can doubt us all you want
We're taking this from the bottom, straight to the top
We are, we are the ones running through this hollow town
Try all you want, you can't keep us down
You're not listening, we are the kids of heart decay
With no future, or so you say
We build it up and you knock it down
Well go ahead and take a look around
We own this town, you and every motherfucker around
We own this town, so go ahead and take a look around
Are you scared of what you found?
