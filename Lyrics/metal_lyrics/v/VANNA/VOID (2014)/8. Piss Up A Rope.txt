Hang my head, no hope
Piss up a fucking rope
Cityscapes as I escape
My real city lies behind my face
Blood vessels as I decay
Oh what a beautiful place
I'm losing everything
Where is my fucking mind?
I'm hearing voices echoing inside my hollow head
My brain is dead
Living behind my eyes with no space to roam
Locked in by lies, so my head becomes my home
My head becomes my home
But this house doesn't feel like a home
It's made of rust and rotting bone
So I'm selling every thought inside
Fuck it, I'ma leave it behind
Nothing adds up
It's never enough
So call it quits and stop giving a fuck
Watch me as my walls cave in, and my head gives way again
I build up these walls like a home
Swing through, make broken bones
Wrecking ball, crumble and fall
Fuck it, I'm gonna leave it behind
