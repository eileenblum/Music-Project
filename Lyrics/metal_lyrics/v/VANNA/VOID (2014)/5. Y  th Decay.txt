Bleed into your veins
Let the youth decay
Let the youth decay, rot and fall away
Heaven knows you're miserable and doesn't care
Hell is in your head and in the skin you wear
Black shoes, black shirts, black hearts everywhere
You don't light up rooms when you walk into them
They fade to black cause they feel your sin
Our heads have holes as black as our souls
But we're gonna die if we don't get control
Bleed into your veins
Let the youth decay
Reflections I can't seem to find
Faces no longer mine
There's nothing staring back at me
Cause nothing is now all I see
I suck the life out of everyone
Sky swallow and I'm eating the sun
Cast shadows ain't got shit on me
Eyes blacker than you've ever seen
