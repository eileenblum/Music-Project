I've sunk lower than a stone in the sea
Much lower than I've ever seen
You see, even rocks don't have bottoms like this
I wonder now if I'll even be missed
Do they know my face? Do they know I exist?
So what's the point? There's no fucking use
My own fingers and hands become my noose
Someone give me a reason to stay
Fuck it, no one listens anyway. Again, I'm alone

Home is a coffin and your city's a grave
Don't dig yourself, dig yourself into place
In these goddamn dark nights I start to realize this is war
I'm gonna have to fight tooth and nail to stay alive
Look at me, living proof. You're not alone
We have each other and we'll pull through
This chapter's called "you're alive."
You've been writing it the whole time so come back to life
Don't write, don't write your ending, don't let go
There's a reason you just don't know, you don't know
There's a reason, so don't let go, don't let go
