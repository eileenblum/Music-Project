How do I start? Well here it goes
I'll write it all down so that everyone knows

Dragged out and low, feeling lost
With no one to save me, I need a personal cross
Cut across my heart, I hope I die
This love will make me go blind
I got swords for hands and fucking hearts for eyes
Dig out my heart and put my eyes inside
Swallow the sight, consume the light
I've never felt more alone
Forgotten son left out on my own

Dragged out and low and feeling lost
With no one to save me, I need a personal cross
If emptiness is loneliness, and loneliness is cleanliness
And cleanliness is godliness, then I'm a filthy fucking mess
Yeah, I'm a wreck, Intoxicated by madness
No love, no peace, just sadness
A filthy fucking mess
