Don't wait for rivers to flood, just to keep you afloat
Don't wait for mountains to fall, just to get across
And I've never seen lights quite like these
Glowing and bursting for me
And times never ceased or stopped for me, but suddenly I control all I see
When did these faces need me to be everything I could be?
When did these words breathe life into the deceased?
Don't wait for rivers to flood, just to keep you afloat
Don't wait for mountains to fall, just to get across
Any path that you take that you didn't pave is the wrong one
And anybody who waits in the rain will drown in the flood
And anybody who makes the climb knows the view is worth the time
But the battle of if I'll ever get there is the problem
How much can I take 'til I call it quits?
How long can my legs keep running like this?
Until they give in, until my liver gives up
My lungs are blackened, but that's how I like them
I'm pushing the limits until they push me back
I'm on the edge of the mountain calculating the gap between a rock and a hard place
A palace and a pit, but I remember death never lies to the people who live
