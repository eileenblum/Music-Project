The red, white, black and blue
Broken and used
Obsessed with this disease
We've put the world on it's knees
Obsessed with our needs while our mouths rot and bleed
Each man creates his own devil and god for the throne
Hoping for heaven but we're heading for hell
We call this living and we're doing it well
Obsessed with our needs while mouths rot and beg you please
Red, white, black and blue
There is no right, there is no truth
Cause it's a nation of sheep, ruled by wolves
Owned by pigs and lead by fools
Sleep is over
It's time to wake up
The world is burning
All I hear is, "I don't give a fuck"
We're the blind leading the sick to die [2x]
Open your eyes or it will never stop
No rest, no sleep
Wake up, wake up
One nation under shit
Our nation
We're burying it
