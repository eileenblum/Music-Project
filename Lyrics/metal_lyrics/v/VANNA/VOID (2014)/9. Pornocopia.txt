Wet nightmare digging in my brain
I gotta put you to bed baby, you're all the same
Line em up just to knock em down
My pride and worth just came to drown
Can you feel electricity?
Your eyes tell this wolf all he needs
Lay down, you're my favorite prey
Eat up the flavor of the day
If pretty girls make graves in my head
Then my heart's a tomb for the undead
If pretty girls make graves in my head
Then my heart's a bomb, now I'm dead
Look into these hungry eyes
Don't you see the beast inside?
Keep it beating babe
I need to eat you
Don't you see the mess inside?
I'm fucking rotten and feeding off lies
I've made my disgusting bed
A pig in shit, fucked and fed
I'm sleeping in my grave
Die next to me
Lay me, lay me to rest
