We were born of this world as free as a bird
We gave ourselves these chains, this cage, and these words
Do we suffer, or do we survive?
Can we live, or must we die?
I fear the worst for this earth
How do we get this crooked path on course?
For all mankind, for all of time
We could start a spark
The world's in flames and we're blowing smoke
Feeding a fire and burning up hope
I'm afraid of everyone
I'm afraid of what we've done
Can our rights overcome our wrongs?
Can this be our revolution song?
We could start a spark
Don't leave the world in the dark
You hold freedom in your hands
In your heart and with your friends
So stand up, make a difference count
Cause if not you, then who will dig us out
