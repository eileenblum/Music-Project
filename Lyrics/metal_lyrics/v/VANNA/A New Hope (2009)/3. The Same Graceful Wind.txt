what a brilliant plan. to steal a heart. 
carve your name. carve your name. 
she will learn it well. you let her down.
you let her down. so gently.

and now she looks. only straight ahead. 
lie to me. lie to me. 
tell me you never expected. her to leave.

and it cuts you deep. right where you wanted. 
and it cuts you deep. where it hurts the most.

i hope it cuts you deep. where it hurts the most. 
but the sad thing is. it's just what you fucking wanted.

and now she looks. only straight ahead. 
lie to me. lie to me. 
tell me you never expected. her to leave..

i'm breathing the life back into love. 
she's coming around. 
i'm breathing the life back into love. 
she's waking up.

and the same graceful wind. that carried her to me. 
will turn cold on you. will bring you to your knees.

when the stage caves in. what part of you will live. 
and who would pay to watch you die.

tell me you never expected. her to leave.

i'm breathing the life back into love. 
she's coming around. 
i'm breathing the life back into love. 
she's waking up.

i've been looking. for you in my dreams. 
been waiting. for you to wake up
