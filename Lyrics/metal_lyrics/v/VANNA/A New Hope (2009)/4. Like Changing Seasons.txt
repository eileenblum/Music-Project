call it done and easy. over and over. 
but we'll never learn. 
how to slow down. how to slow down. 
done easy. over and over. 
but we'll never learn. 
how to slow down. not to slow down.

until you cower like a lie gone wrong.

just say the words. and let me know. 
we can't survive. if we both let go.

there might be love. buried somewhere. 
far beneath our pride. its worth finding. 
if you'll breath life. in it with me.

you told me all that you've known. are the lonely places. 
so lets get closer now. 
we're holding on to. the things we need the most. 
hold on as close as we can.

you're pushing. all the doubts. 
from my head. like you need them. 
but you paint yourself the victim. 
you're pulling. at my hand. 
like you're ready to fall. 
but there's no stopping this at all.

there's so much to say. but nothing comes out right.  
its best that we leave it. to our movements. 
we move so well. your lips speak no words. 
its best that we leave it. 
its best that we leave it. 
behind close doors.

just say the words. and let me know. 
we cam't survive. if we both let go.

you told me all that you've known. are the lonely places. 
so lets get closer now. 
we're holding on to. the things we need the most. 
hold on as close as we can.

this time. we'll keep it all to ourselves. 
we're keeping it quiet. this time. 
we'll keep it to ourselves. 
though we know this isn't right. at all.

you're pushing. all the doubts. 
from my head. like you need them. 
but you paint yourself the victim. 
you're pulling. at my hand. 
like you're ready to fall. 
but there's no stopping this at all
