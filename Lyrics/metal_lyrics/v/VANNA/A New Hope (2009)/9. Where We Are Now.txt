I just canât get the ending right. 
Iâm so desperate tonight. 
It seems only right to let the shadows lead the way. 
If I could only just decide. 
To let go of my insides. 
I know that Iâll never have to feel this way again.

And Iâm caught in between. 
My waking life and dreams . 
Deathâs just as lonely as before. 
I still remember you when.

This is all too familiar now.
I know Iâve seen this place before. But I just donât recall. 
I donât feel like Iâm awake. But Iâm not dreaming. 
What was it that I came here for?

They held us down. 
But now weâre breaking loose. 
We swore that weâd let nothing stand in our way. 
And when Iâm gone. 
I will come back to haunt you. 
Iâll still watch over you my love.

When youâre on your way to me. 
Donât forget the taste of me. 
And donât forget the feel of me. 
With my arms around you. 
Those memories will never fade.
Like all the promises we made.

This is all too familiar now. 
I know Iâve seen this place before. But I just donât recall. 
I donât feel like Iâm awake. But Iâm not dreaming. 
What was it that I came here for?

From below. The sun will rise. 
And give us time to clear our heads.

The end is breathing down my neck. 
Though hope is all that we have left. 
The pain in understanding. Why we canât take it all back. 
Itâs time to finally let go. Of everything weâve known.

This is all too familiar now. 
I know Iâve seen this place before. But I just donât recall. 
I donât feel like Iâm  awake. But Iâm not dreaming. 
What was it that I came here for?

I swear Iâll find you before I drift away.

This is all too familiar now. 
I know Iâve seen this place before. But I just donât recall. 
I donât feel like Iâm awake. But Iâm not dreaming. 
I donât know where Iâll be drifting. When I finally let go.
