I've got everything I need 
To keep you at my side 
A new reason every day 
To keep my head up

And this will be the last time 
You get to see my face 
Till winter's end comes crashing down (comes crashing down)
I never understood what living like this does 
Part of me was lost so long ago

If we move with the waves 
I'll breathe in the air 
We'll walk till the sea is all that we're near 
With worn empty hands and tired eyes 
Will hope be all we have left

As I keep myself away 
I'll stay my course 
Words come so hard but you're with me 
When I sleep

Keep moving 
I've tried so hard 
Keep moving 
This can't be it 
Keep moving 
Remind myself its worth the fight
You will meet my hands 
If this takes me 
I'll leave my words on the wind 

When it all comes down 
To a frozen ocean between us 
Keep me alive 
You're everything that keeps me

I've got more than just pictures to keep you at my side 
When distance becomes clear 
I'll keep my head up

If you move with the waves 
I'll breathe in the air 
We'll walk till the sea is all that we're near 
With worn empty hands and tired eyes 
Will hope be all we have left

Will hope be all we have left 
Will hope be all we have left tonight
