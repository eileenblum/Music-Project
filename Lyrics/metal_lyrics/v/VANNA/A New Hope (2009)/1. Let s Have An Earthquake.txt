I am no stranger to loss.
I've seen more than my eyes can bare.
We are both love and hate.
Lead by hearts and taken like dust to the air.
Our paths may crawl like vines.
Held high and left for the wind to taste.
But our names mean nothing if we fail.
And we will run ourselves withered and raw. 
Make the earth shake.
We will.
Make the earth shake.
Make the earth. 
Make the earth. 
Make the earth shake.
