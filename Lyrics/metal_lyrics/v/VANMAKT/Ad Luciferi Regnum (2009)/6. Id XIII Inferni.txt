Dominion of Darkness
Kingdom of the Serpent
Enticing realm, The Black Sun
Open your 13th gate
Unleash thy fury and flames
Eliminate the Kingdom Jehovah

Eliminate the Kingdom Jehovah

The final seal is now broken
Release the Chaos
Let the Scourge of Belial strike again
Upon flesh and skin
We will bring you their lying souls
Inside a plate built by christian bones

Inside a plate built by christian bones

This silence, embraces me
The darkness falls over my soul
Let the freedom of evil
Fill my shattered mind
Fill my shattered mind

As the final light sets, our burden leaves
Finally our ancestors home has been cleansed
No more false prophets and no more lies
Our time to burn this world has come

Dominion of Darkness
Kingdom of the Serpent

The final seal is now broken
Release the Chaos
Let the Scourge of Belial strike again

Oceans of water
Seas filled with blood
Green woodlands
Can you see the flames?
Dominion of Darkness
Kingdom of the Serpent
Enticing realm, Our home Id XIII Inferni
