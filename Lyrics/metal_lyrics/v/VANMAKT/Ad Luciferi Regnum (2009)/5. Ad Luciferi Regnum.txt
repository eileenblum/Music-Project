[Music &amp; lyrics -- M. Svensson]

Raping the virtue of child unborn
Feeding the existence of neglect

Situation is on hold.
War just keeps on.
The mind is in coma.
Help me to get out.

Eliminating human emotions
Draining their dreams of wonder
Evaluating christian words

Embrace the dark lord's vengeance
Enter the abyss of delight within
Summon the one with horns
Prepare for the earthly war of hate

Eliminating human emotions
Draining their dreams of wonder
Evaluating christian words
Indoctrinating lies in human minds
A genocidal christian behaviour

Divine demon
Spiritual light
A rigid battle
Poison Growing

A song from the dead with tales of ending
A infected mind spreading gods disease

Reaching the status of grievance
Drinking the one son's blood
Darkness shall prevail and the light shall vanish
