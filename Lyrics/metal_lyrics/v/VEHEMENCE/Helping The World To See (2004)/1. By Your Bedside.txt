The hands move painfully forward
Time's progression reminds you of the limit of yours
Every second another step
Towards the answers to questions no one wants to ask

Kept alive by machines...
Your life has been gone from the moment you knew
Living half dead asleep
This fragile shell finally overcome by life

The kids only know you're not well
The last visit they kissed you and said goodbye
They won't forget, and soon wonder
Where it was you went, how can they see you again?

Kept alive by machines...
Your life has been gone from the moment you knew
Living half dead asleep
This fragile shell finally overcome by life

By your bedside, you'll soon die

The machines won't save you, just look at your flesh
Swollen, discolored, putrid
You'll soon be dead

The hands move painfully forward
Time's progression reminds you of the limit of yours
Every second another step
Towards the answers to questions no one wants to ask

As seconds melt into death
We are relieved to not see pain on your face
The hands have moved into the dark
All lines are flat, and you have moved onward

Kept alive by machines...
Your life has been gone from the moment you knew
Living half dead asleep
This fragile shell finally overcome by life
