What has come? What mankind has created...
Comfortable, the silk and the cushion that we're laying in

Not real...our lives...deceit
We know what is coming

There's a fire that's burning within all of our hearts
They will know what all of this burning has created
These old men consumed in the pyre of our quest for life
Politicians soon unemployed and begging forgiveness

Their lies... worthless...deceit
They know what is coming
They know

The world will die...if they are left in control
The world will die...if they are left holding the reigns
The world will die...if old men are left holding our fate
The world will die...if something doesn't change

We are dying
We are all dying

Held up in our fortress, the bad men have broken through
The war is now fought at home and there's nothing we can do
They infiltrate our security; they've broken down our walls
We all line up, homeless, looking for justice in empty halls

Something must change

Held up in our fortress, the bad men have broken through
The war is now fought at home and there's nothing we can do
They infiltrate our security; they've broken down our walls
We all line up, homeless, looking for justice in empty halls
