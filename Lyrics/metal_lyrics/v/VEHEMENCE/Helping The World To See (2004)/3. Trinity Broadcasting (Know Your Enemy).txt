The lightings perfect, the cameras are set
Make up and wardrobe are nearly finished
Talent is rehearsed, crowd fluffed, ready to explode

In just five minutes it will be Showtime, a few script changes to be expected
Lepers a no-show

Cancer victims healed instead
Camera one fades from the intro into a nice tight close-up
Pink haired god woman buried in make-up
Rapture, Jesus on T.V.

Trinity on T.V.
Just keep watching
Know your enemy
Know your fucking enemy

They start with arms held up high, they have to thanks their Jesus
For all the donations now they can brainwash more of you
Call the number on the screen
Never mind the molesters, its all part of gods plan
Gods plan

Trinity on T.V.
Just keep watching
Know your enemy
Know your fucking enemy

Sickness
Let the bullshit healing begin
Bring your sickness to the main stage

Healing
Walk out to them, and then fall when touched
Your mind tells you, you are healed

Cancer
And then you'll die for your blind faith
All part of your fucking gods plan

Gods Plan
Time for a commercial break, stick around
Time for a commercial break, we'll be right back

The lightings perfect, the cameras are set
Make-up and wardrobe have gotten touched up
God man is ready, crowd spent, but can go again

In thirty seconds back on the airwaves prepare the spirit
And make sure we have 800 number
Operators standing by

Camera one fades from the commercial into a nice tight close up
The god man smiles and asks for money
Thank god for your money

Know Your Enemy
