Soldiers all go marching into battle, 
moving slowly on across the ground
Tracks of tanks flatten the sand beneath them, 
soon to be replaced by human flesh

Loved ones left behind are not forgotten, memories kept fresh by photographs
The will of the politicians is forced and now soldiers kill to make them proud

They can feel the spirit that they will kill for
Now the soldiers have become their god...

Arrogance now fuels the need for conquest - nuclear chemistry is the god
Capitol approaches in the distance - enemy waiting in their walls

As the first attack is launched upon them, you could see the passion in their eyes
Eyes that would soon be ruptured and removed, by the weapons that 
will take their life

They can feel the spirit that they will kill for
Now the soldiers have become their god
Pieces of human blasting through the air
The conclusion will not end in life

[Solo: Chavez]

As they look into the sky
They die with pride in their eye...
