You want to die and kill for god

Where has the world gone, where is the warmth of the light?
What happened to living for the sake of life?
What kind of god tells you to die?
You ignorant slave - such a waste of life!

You want to die and kill for god

I should take this moment to thank you for helping the world to see
How religion is to blame for the end of humanity
Now you can go back to strapping the bomb to your chest
Maybe I'll see you later when the time is right
To fall...into a sea of flesh

Kill For God

What happened to your mind?
Why must we all die?
The only way to be safe is to kill your god
