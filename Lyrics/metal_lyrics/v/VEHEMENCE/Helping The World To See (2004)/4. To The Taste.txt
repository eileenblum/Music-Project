Burn! Fire it up, burn it down, the embers glow in the darkness
Feel warmth crawl in, through your head, drip down the spine

To the taste
Through water
Then into the lungs (exhale)

Burn! Keep it packed, never cashed, don't even pass the dust hit
Breathe in comfort, block out the pain, if even just for a moment
Smile on my face, I twist the sky, through gates of forever
To taste the fire, mist filled haze blinds so peacefully

To the taste
Through water
Then into the lungs (exhale)

To the taste
Through water
Then into the lungs (breathe in)

From the seed to the stem, the bounty of earth
Creation in my hand
The hair and the leaf and paper
All rolled into one

To taste this life

Burn! Fire it up, burn it down, the embers glow in the darkness
Feel warmth crawl in, through your head, drip down the spine

Burn! Keep it packed, never cashed, don't even pass the dust hit
Breathe in comfort, block out the pain, if even just for a moment


To the taste
Through water
Then into the lungs
