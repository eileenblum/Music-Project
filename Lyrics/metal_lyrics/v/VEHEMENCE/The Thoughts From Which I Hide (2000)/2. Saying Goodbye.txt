I can still see my reflection in your
Blood soaked eye as you sob
A last farewell severing all of my passion

Bullshit, your words such pain
You have created this chain reaction

My sorrow to hate and my hatred to violence
The only thing that I really desired was
For you to give me a reason to hate you
And now that I have this, there is nothing to stop me
I will destroy you, as you to my psyche
For this pain is never to be forgotten

With my mallet I swing crushing the bones in your pelvis
Y ou cry for some sympathy, I do not fucking think so
Your pain has only just begun pulling backwards
Expose your intestines, your eyes begging

My pain is forever your cries cannot compare
This emptiness is soon to consume you
Blood pools underneath us from severed arteries
My smile reminds me of the times we've shared

Puncture, remove, remorse, sorrow
Your death, my joy, your pain, my life
Smashing, tearing, ending your reign
Supreme no more, I am my own
As you quiver, await the end
My words ingrained always in you

I need to know that I'll never see your face again
Digging deeply under your flesh peeling so slowly
The skin pulls away bearing facial muscle tissue
As convulsions subside your soul leaves your corpse

Puncture remove
Remorse sorrow
As you quiver
I need to know that I'll never see your face again
I can still see my reflection in your
Blood soaked eye as you sob
A last farewell severing all of my passion
Peel your flesh , passion growing deep inside me
Cut and push , my knife a fatal phallus
Replace with my throbbing swollen cock
Your corpse still, but still warm and perfect for me
Taste the blood, the time has come to savor your death
Say goodbye, my love for you down to nothing
Goodbye
