SEE THE SUN RISE CASTING LUMINOUS SHADOWS
BATTLE FIELD LITTERED WITH BLOODY WRETCHED
MORNING AIR CRISP WITH THE STENCH OF THE SUFFERING

DESPAIR EMANATES FROM THE MELANCHOLY SHELLS

NAMELESS FACES, SCATTERED REMNANTS
NOT AS MANY DEAD AS I WOULD HAVE WISHED
SURVEYING THE WRECKAGE I PRETEND TO CARE
DIGGING FURIOUSLY I FRANTICALLY SEARCH

HEARING THEIR PLEAS AND QUICKENING
MY PACE I UNEARTH A ROOM QUICK TO LOOK INSIDE
CRIBS OVERTURNED TINY BODIES LIE BROKEN
MY JOY IS SO VERY HARD TO HIDE

NAMELESS FACES, SCATTERED REMNANTS
NOT AS MANY DEAD AS I WOULD HAVE WISHED

BUT NOW I HASTEN MY EFFORT
GRABBING A LIFELESS CHID CORPSE

SHOVING BROKEN LIMBS INTO MY SACK MY PALMS MOIST WITH BLOOD
BEFORE OTHERS ARRIVE I FLEE, NO ONE WILL FIND ME

YOU ALL SUFFER
MOTHERS WEEP
THINKING OF THEIR
PERISHED CHILDREN

DOOR OPENS TO REVEAL A PLACE OF SUFFERING
MY VICTIMS I CAST DOWN INTO A DARK CORNER
REMOVE LIMBS RELEASING MY BLOODY LUBRICANT!
MASTURBATE SEVERED HEAD SO MANY MORE TO KILL

KILLING CHRISTIANS OR SIMPLY MAIMING THEM
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER THEY MUST BE FORCED TO KNOW

THEIR GOD IS DEAD AND SO IS CHRISTIANITY
AND NOW GOD'S NAME IS DRAINED FOR ALL ITS WORTH
DIE CHRISTIAN MOTHERFUCKER
HOW MANY LIVES MUST BE TAKEN AWAY
JUST TO HAVE A ROTTEN CORPSE ON MY DICK
BUTCHERING A CHILD AND SAVING SEGMENTS

I MUST RETURN SOON TO THE SCENE OF MY CRIME

NAMELESS FACES, SCATTERED REMNANTS
NOT AS MANY DEAD AS I WOULD HAVE WISHED
THIS STRUCTURE I CRUSH JUST TO MASTURBATE
WITH A LIFELESS CHILD CORPSE
