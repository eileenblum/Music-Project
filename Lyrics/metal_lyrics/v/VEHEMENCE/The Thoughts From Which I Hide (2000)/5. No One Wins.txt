The walls cave in on me, this life that you call mine
You smile say you love me, I want to smash your face
My torment, my prison, why must life be this way
I close my eyes to see my mental death of you

My tears spill from the corner of my eye
Stumbling upon the realization
No one wins

Rejection, ostracized, become to numb to love
They say that they're you friend, you wanted so much more
Companion, a lover, you wont let me love you
Raising my fists in rage, I curse gods high and low

My tears spill from the corner of my eye
Stumbling upon the realization
No one wins

I feel the oppression of this life that's inflicted upon me
You scoff at misery that I collapse under the sheer force of
Your complete ignorance has me screaming rage and hatred for you

You are an imbecile and it is for that fact that you must die
How can you deceive yourself with lies
Why must you say fucking blatant non-truths
Admit it if you must hate me
And then we won't pretend to be friends
Tidal waves of anger cascade into rivulets
Of thought that I must learn to get under control
I must think, organize, and come to terms with this
No matter how hard I try I won't win

My tears spill from the corner of my eye
Stumbling upon the realization
No one wins
