Now that you understand
You will go peacefully
But I still regret
Not hearing you pleading

Pulling you closer feeling your breasts
Pressing so firmly, aroused!
I take your life, just to feel the ecstasy
My knife in you, as you are my willing victim

To caress your flesh, and to feel the blood soaked moisture
My only regret, you cannot feel this more than once
Your breasts swollen to the touch
Warm breath drops upon your neck

Closing your eyes so tightly
Anxiously await my next move Insert deep into you
Womb like warmth of your cunt
Further I drive my arm
Until I reach my elbow

Pulling you closer feeling your breasts
Pressing so firmly, aroused!
