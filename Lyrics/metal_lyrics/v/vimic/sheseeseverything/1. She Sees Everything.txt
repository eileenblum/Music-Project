I never had a fucking chance
Starlet
Beautiful angel born to captivate

Star struck
I watched my courage disintegrate
No
I told myself that this would end in pain
Leaving me all alone
Still I knew my soul she'd take
Groveling prostrate
Begging for an audience
Shivering withdrawals
Blinded to the obvious
Compromise values
Everything is worthless
If you have her once you will always be her servant
Touch me
She's my hero
She sees everything
Love me
She's my hero
I am nothing
Save me
One more night is all I ask
Save me
Come on
Who am I?
Look back
Where the fuck did I begin?
Where am I?
Lost track
Ran the race I could not win
What is this romance?
Reconciled to giving in
So it goes
Goodbye
Follow her to hell again
Touch me
She's my hero
She sees everything
Love me
She's my hero
I am nothing
Save me
One more night is all I ask
Save me
Heroin
What have I done?
Darling what have I done?
What have I done?
I'll show you all that I've done
For you
I turned my back on my family
For you
I severed all ties with my friends
They can't understand
For you
I gave up my worldly possessions
For you
I never had a chance
Groveling prostrate
Begging for an audience
Shivering withdrawals
Blinded to the obvious
Compromise values
Everything is worthless
If you have her once you will always be her servant
Touch me
She's my hero
She sees everything
Love me
She's my hero
I am nothing
Save me
One more night is all I ask
Save me
Heroin
