Flesh and blood
They are hiding a mystery
Gods above

Is there anybody listening
No
We're not getting an answer
No
Slaves with no master
So
We play the doctor
Better living through chemistry
Simple skeletons
Playing God again
We're getting higher
We're getting higher
And the truth will set us free
Sticks and stones
We are too numb to feel them
Broken bones
Do we know how to heal them?
But we have our distractions
And the law of attraction
Slaves to corruption
Corruption always wins
Simple skeletons
Junkie gods condemned
We're getting higher
We're getting higher
And the truth will set us free
We're shining brighter
We're shining brighter
There is truth in chemistry
Let's go
Simple skeletons
Simple skeletons
You're poison down to the bone
Playing God again
We're getting higher
We're getting higher
And the truth will set us free
We're shining brighter
We're shining brighter
There is truth in chemistry
Fire
We are on fire
We touched the sun and now we're clean
Higher
We're getting higher
But the fall is coming
Simple skeletons
Simple skeletons
You're poison down to the bone
Playing God again
