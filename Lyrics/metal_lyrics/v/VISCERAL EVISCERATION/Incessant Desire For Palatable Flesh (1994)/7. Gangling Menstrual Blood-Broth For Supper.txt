A doctor of medicine he is
Incontrovertible well-off man
Owner of a luxurious free-hold flat
Unfortunately insane

Libidinous opening the door to paradise
Where the winsome bodies lie
Loathing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Stiff &amp; cold intercourse improvisation

With a quick gash
Her throat was rift
Deepen the wound and exhaust
Last liquids of the tattered corpse

Spermy soup on lacerated skin
Thoracic cavity divided into
Nipples excise out of the breasts
Deep-red female flesh to digest

Endeavour to consume the pudendal cleft
Urine juices gushing forth
A nurse pops in by surprise
Just has signed a contract to demise

Pangs of thirst overcome him
Menstrual blood-broth makes him grin\m
Sucking out the torn vagina
Fuzz mixed with blood paraphernalia

With a body-axe she gets halved
Jellied fluids and organs appear

Sack the remains in body bags
For further necrophile satisfaction
Preservate the impassioned shreds
Completing his morbid collection
