I hear and my insides tremble
My lips quiver at the sound
Rottenness enters my bones
I tremble while I stand
As I await the day of distress
To come against those who attack us
I will rejoice in the Lord
Rejoice in the God of my deliverance
The Lord God is my strength
He will set my feet like the deer
He will let me walk upon the heights
