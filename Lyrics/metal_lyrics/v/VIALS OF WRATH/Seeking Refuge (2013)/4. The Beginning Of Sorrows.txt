In the passing of the eternal
What stands the test of time?
All of your possessions will burn
Everything rusts, dies, decays

All this world can offer is trivial
Meaningless unto the grave
To put away treasures here on earth
Is useless at the end of days

Can you not see the signs?
Can you not feel the pain?
This world as we know it is dying
The only escape: be born again

I will seek refuge in the woods
To be alone to pray
Just as the Christ, who often withdrew
Unto the mountains
Beside the streams
Into the forest
Among the trees
In His creation I find peace
And pray
