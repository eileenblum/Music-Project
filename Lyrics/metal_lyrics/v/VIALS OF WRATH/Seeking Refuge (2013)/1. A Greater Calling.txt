I am a grain of sand
Swept with tides of unknown shores
You are the ocean mighty
Full of life both great and small
I am a single fading light
In the cold night sky
You are the bright morning star
Shining bright for all to see
I am a lone drop of rain
Falling and quickly forgotten
You are the cleansing flood
Who takes away all untrue
I long to be so much moreâ¦
More of what you are
I am nothing without you
For you are the great I am
