Night falls and I am alone
With my thoughts, my failures
The harsh reality of wood and stone
Revives my spirit again
The solitude of God's creation
Brings peace, cleanses my sins

To be alone, in the wilderness
Brings a freedom to pray
All around, branches, like hands
Offer up their praise
And with each gust of wind
They bow to the King of Grace

A fire within me burns
And grows each passing moment
I must do more with this life, this gift of being
Beneath infinite stars I ponder the eternal
And know I'm never truly alone

Father, here I am
Please forgive me
I pray you welcome me home
