In time I will be forgotten
Forsaken, forlorn
By even those closest
From enemy and friend torn

As I choose a path
The one less oft tread
I fear I dire end waiting
Was all for naught if nowhere lead

I am overcome with sorrow
Lifeâs elusive meaning I seek
A journey that leaves me failing
Destitute and weak

So in pressing in onward
I envision Heavenâs open gate
With hell always at my heels
I pray the better of two fates

Let me now falter nor stumble
Grant me strength on this day
With each victory to remain humble
And each failure boldly pray
