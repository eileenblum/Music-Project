To journey beyond the confines of this flesh
In communion with another
I wander neath a canopy of oak and pine

The allure of an October eve
Sees me tread amongst fallen leaves
My sorrows are lifted in the presence of the Divine 

Let this feeling never cease
Tranquility and peace
In the forest will I be found 

When deathâs cold hand takes mine
May it be in such a time
Make my grave upon the highest mount
