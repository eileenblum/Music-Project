This glacial apathy
I must overcome
This fleshly desire
I am undone
This calloused heart beats now
But for how long?
To the dilemma of another
It hastens to numb

As smoldering embers weaken
A faith not fanned doth wane
Dying amongst the ashes
I must revive the flame
This earthen vessel
A dwelling place for the most high
Flawed and unworthy
Made pure by fiery trial

I offer myself once again
Yahweh MâKaddesh
You are welcome here
