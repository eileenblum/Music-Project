I long to be where no shadows dwell
All darkness is vanquished
And my spirit is well
At this summit of stone and oak that impales
Transfixing my mind upon self, upon self
My purpose
My pain
My loss
My gain
Neâer more than what is today
Purge me, Adonai, of desire and lust
Less of me, more of thee
May all my glory be thine
Empty me of selfâ¦ of self
