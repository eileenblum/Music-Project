In the void of despair, fear grips me without warning. When my faith is weak, it takes hold.
Alone in my thoughts, like death, voices of doubt rise to take hold, leave me cold.

Crying out in desperation
In the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil, for you are with me
I will fear no evil, for you are with me

Thereâs darkness closing in
Yet whom shall I fear?
The Lord is my light and salvation!

Alone in my thoughts, like death, voices of doubt rise to take hold, leave me cold.

Crying out in desperation
In the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil, for you are with me
I will fear no evil, for you are with me
