The hand of the Lord was upon me, and I was carried out in spirit, and He set me in the midst of a valley which was full of bones.

And I passed them round about; there were many so very dry. He asked me, âCan these bones live? Upon them now prophesy.â

From the dead an army risen.
The breath of life enter you.
Creating flesh, ye shall live!
And all will know I am the Lord!

I prophesied as commanded. There was a noise, behold they shake. The bones then came together. Skin covered, but no breath they take. âSon of Man,â he commanded me, âProphesy unto the wind. From the four corners, breath into these slain so that they shall live.â

So I prophesied as he commanded me, and breath came into them, and they lived. They stood upon their feet. It was an exceedingly great army from the dead.
