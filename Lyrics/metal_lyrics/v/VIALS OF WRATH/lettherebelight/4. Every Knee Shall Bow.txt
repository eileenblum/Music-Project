Who are you to judge my service? To our own master will stand and fall. And I will stand, even when Iâm weak, for the Lord strengthens me when I call.

Receive the one who is weak and struggles with their faith.
They may not see each day as holy, for giving praise.
No one lives just to himself, and no one dies the same. In life and death we are the Lords, and glorify His name.

To this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, to be the Lord of the dead and the living.

For it is written, as I live: every knee shall bow before me, and every tongue confess, that I am God.
