God, do you feel anger? Remorse? Regret?
When you look down on your creation?
Snakes that resemble men dwell among your children. And they feed. And they breed.

Serpents feeling comfort
There should be cold contempt
Blind to their lies, we embrace them.
We embrace them...

Accustomed to their presence, seeking less of yours, solace in prayer slowly fades.
Broken is Nehushtan, shattered as should be. Deliver us from the evil we condone.

I will send venomous snakes among you. Vipers that cannot be charmed.
And they will bite... they will bite you.
