Rise! A war has been declared! Arise now and choose your side.
Fall! Down on your knees! Our triumph comes from prayer.

Our struggle is not against the flesh and blood, but principalities of darkness.
Rise! A war has been declared! To win we must be sanctified.

Take upon you armor so you may withstand evil; holy armor of God, and having done all to stand, guard within you truth, righteousness and peace. A shield of faith will protect from fiery slings; helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, to attack and defend against that which is unseen.

A call to arms! Rise up and defend. A call to arms goes out to all men.

Arise! A war has been declared.
Arise! Arise and choose your side.
