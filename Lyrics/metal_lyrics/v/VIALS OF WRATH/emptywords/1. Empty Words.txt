immortality brought 
from words penned 
sharing a thought 
long after 
iâm gone 

memories fade 
with the owner 
truths of events 
forever laid 
to rest 

no longer able 
to reconcile 
apologies linger 
unaccepted 
undone 

do we ever know 
significance 
a greater scheme 
or just 
existence 

forgive me 
in my exit 
for nothing 
insightful 
to say
