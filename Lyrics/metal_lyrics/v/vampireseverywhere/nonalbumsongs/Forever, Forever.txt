[Unreleased Track]We are young forever, tied &amp; bound together.
Eyes bat toward the light you better turn around.
Lipstick hinted drops hit the ground.

She calls my name.
She calls my name.

Can you breathe tonight, flying through the shadows?
Can you see the light when you find your heart?
(When you find your heart)

We fight the light. Post human plight.
tourniquet the flaw, don't make a sound.
Disassociate the world around.

She calls my name.
She calls my name.

Can you breathe tonight, flying through the shadows?
Can you see the light when you find your heart?
(When you find your heart)

Kill with me you want to dance with me,
you want to bite your tongue.
Kill with me you want to dance with me,
you want to bite your tongue.
Kill with me you want to dance with me,
you want to Bite-Your-Tongue.

Can you breathe tonight, flying through the shadows?
Can you see the light when you find your heart?
