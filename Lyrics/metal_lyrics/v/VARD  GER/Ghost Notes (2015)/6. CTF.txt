I am a living force, every breath I take relentlessly
A God of love that fuels me, a design of mystery thrills me
Every second every step I take is bursting with energy, synergy within me
I feel electric, and with passion for his love magnetic
Thoughts denied my life inside
Fear consumes the source of light.
I no longer fear, I come to claim my ground!
I'm taking my place in the universe!
Building and growing, illuminated I am illuminated
I've gone from hope to believe, and now I'm moving mountains

Just open the gift inside, and prepare for the light to guide you
Can't let flesh deny the love
Just open the gift inside, and prepare for the light to guide you

Must let choice decide the love
The love
It is a law
Like gravity
The laminen that binds us in unity
Connected to a mighty force
And no grave can hold us
It is a place beyond
More power than the sun
The provider of energy
Creation's mystery
We're taking our place in the universe
