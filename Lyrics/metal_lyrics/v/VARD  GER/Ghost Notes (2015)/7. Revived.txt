I walk around in the pieces left behind
Fading, broken
One story ends and a new chapter will arise
Still I carry the burden inside, all memories, the reminder of my failure
The pain of the guilt denies, your everything, everyday, face the pain, anyway
In search of a path while blind, seals your faith in nothing
I wouldn't change a thing 'cause it opened my eyes
I'm done with all that haunts me
Because in truth I was learning how to find
The strength to leave behind, the scars ripped open, seals unbroken
Forever is hidden inside, the miracle from the other side of creation
A future becomes alive, seals your faith
Through the abyss of madness, a clarity of the image of myself was lies
To hell and back I paid the price, the trail of tears left behind
Just feel my scars, and feel my wrath
Because I'm longing, for what we've all been searching for
To fill the empty void, the screams of frustration heard around the globe
The one true love, can unite us all, forever

What I decide, will be what comes alive
And if I fail to see?
Beacons of lights will shine for me
The spirit, in truth will set the world on fire
