The star stratosphere, illuminates the sky
Symphonies of silence pulsate tonight
You wanted to hear?
You wanted to feel?
Out of oblivion, see the surreal
Far from hope, surrounded by fear
So hard to breathe, no peace to find
Sign of hope, felt through the tears
Enter the fields, enter the light
After night comes the day
Shines for your path
Enter the breeze of majestic delight
You wanted to see?
Can it even be real?
Floating in space alone in a dream

What becomes alive, is the essence and the unity of crystal light
The mind awakened
Touched by the crystal sky

The star breather shines, the universe obeys, listen to angels sing their praise

What becomes alive, is the essence and the unity of crystal light
The mind awakened
Touched by the crystal sky
