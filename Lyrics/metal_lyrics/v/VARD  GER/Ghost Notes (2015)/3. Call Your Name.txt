Fall to the ground, but I get up
Again and again I never stop
You try to kill my soul, but I fight back
My wounded heart still strikes with indomitable might
Who is the coward when you reek of fear?
Your fortress is of anger, your shield is forged on lies

Can't hide the day, when he who stands to face the world will throw away, the heathen man (with all his arrogance)
Led astray, with a heart of guilt I call your name
He who raises the dead

We're walking, with fire, burning desire
Keep moving forward and don't look back
This life is just too short for regrets
I use all my power, and use the word to stand against all hate
My sisters my brothers we'll fight until the judgement day
No one shall fall
One body one mind
For the king of kings
for the maker of creation
