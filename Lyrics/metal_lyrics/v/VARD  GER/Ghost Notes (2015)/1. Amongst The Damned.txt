Amongst the damned I walk
I'm confessing my guilt to you
All the times I have raved in the night,
Through the mist at the gates of the beast I wander
Thorns ripped through the core of my soul
I'm bleeding unable to heal
Still I rise from my own demise and refuse to be broken

When the fear becomes too real,
Descending from a dream
To a nightmare state,
Where everything seems impossible
Can you hear me out there?
Can you hear me scream?
To a soul who cries,
A mortal who don't want to die

So much time I have wasted on a soulless journey to nothing
The piper has come to collect his reap,
I'm long overdue but I give him nothing
How can I change the things I've done?
Irreversible, I'm not blaming anyone
You can't judge me, I don't judge you
I'm just trying to live this live

When the fear becomes too real,
Descending from a dream
To a nightmare state,
Where everything seems impossible
Can you hear me out there?
Can you hear me scream?
To a soul who cries.

Amongst the damned, I walk
