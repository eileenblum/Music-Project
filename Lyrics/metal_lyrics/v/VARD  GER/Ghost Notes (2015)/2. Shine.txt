The night is closing to its end
And day is drawing nearer
The sun is tormenting my blood red eyes
I draw my breath, as I stumble forth to gain my strength
Too numb to feel alive, but at least I feel something
Lift your soul so high out of reach
We are the sons, of the most high and shall truly shine
When the darkness is destroyed
The light will truly shine, for all to prosper
There is a fire, a living force invisible
Water, so pure, the source is undeniable
Who will release me, from my sinful flesh?
A soul in mourning and longing for Eden's land
It's evident, impossible to comprehend the multitude and depths of the creation
Our death is searching
Compelled to complete its purpose to constrict the light
The grave is calling
We sleep to awake in the house of the son of light
We are the ones, in depth,
Finding back to dwell, in freedom from the spell
