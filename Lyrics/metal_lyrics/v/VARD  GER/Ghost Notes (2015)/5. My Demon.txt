Resistant, but circling back again
The past casts a shadow clouding my vision
I walk blinded, armed with my hypocrisy
Again my nemesis reveals the mirror's truth
I judge myself, I can't deny I have opened every door and let the demons inside
I am the one who brings the mockery and pain, I am the one who puts his name into shame

Hear these words, reveal my shame, you see me standing as I am
Folded hands I seek your name, father wash away my shame

A legion of voices summons my fears
The path I've chosen has led me here
Reflecting my choices I come to realize, the legion of voices has told me lies
I ask myself, how can I trust, when the only voice inside myself has been led by lust
Gathering strength I must conquer my enemy
I face the mirror, there he stands before me

Hear these words, reveal my shame, you see me standing as I am
Folded hands I seek your name, father wash away my shame

Gathering forces to face my delusions, in my quest for peace
Take this life and lead me through the gates
A cold winter storm, freeze the blood from my eyes
In guilt we were born, reborn we must die
The sins of the flesh, the way of the world, all hope we have left, is through his word
See my signs, and complete the work I gave for you
Voice divine, will grace the ones that seek the truth
One by one, if it takes forever in this world united as one
With a force of eternal fire
My demon will fail

Feeling alone, guided by the night
Through the unknown, bound by the might
A force field of serenity
The celestial painted sky, and the vortex in the black hole by design
