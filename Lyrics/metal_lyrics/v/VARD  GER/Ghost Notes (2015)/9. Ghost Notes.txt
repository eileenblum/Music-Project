Alone with the silence my mind starts drifting
Restless desperation, alone with frustration
Leading me through the gates of temptation
Guild driven decisions, the dark finds its victim
Lurking in the corner, mind in disorder
Twisting and perverting what should have been pure
The path to the obscure
The dark passenger, my trusted friend
Never leaves and never will, he is the roaring lion
I will get my strength from the living ghost
Ancient ghost notes, ghost notes
Abnormality plays with my sanity
Deviating from the path of normality
A justice must be held for the suffering
Once and for all
I'm driven to my knees, now I see clearer
Once blinded by a shameful lie
Chaos, I despise thy name
The passenger calling upon the wrath
Can't hind frustration, zero redemption
Fear born by a planted seed
A coded tranquilizing sphere
Haunted for decades, designed for your dismay
Welcome to his nightmare realm
As he dances upon your grave
The dark passenger, my trusted friend
Never leaves and never will, he is the roaring lion
I will get my strength form the living ghost
Ancient ghost notes, ghost notes
Abnormality plays with my sanity
Deviating from the path of normality
A justice must be held for the suffering
Once and for all
I'm leaving through my dreams to seek redemption
Spell cast by the ones inside
I am you
Chaos, I despise thy name
What once was lost will come alive, the twisted memories left behind
A gift of a new life, restored forever
And we shall rise
What was taken will be returned
Transformed, to the original state of our creation
