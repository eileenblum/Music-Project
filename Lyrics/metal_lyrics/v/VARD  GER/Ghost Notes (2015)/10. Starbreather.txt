Behold the sky
The celestial painted diamonds
The vast depth of eternity
The crystal fortress
Above all time, the one that's coming to save the world
A view through heaven's eyes
Thy word is exalted above thy name
Star breather
Your presence through the invisible
Come see the signs, walk through the door
Be purified in the river of innocence
The feeling of completion
My soul is longing
Star breather
Prime mover
First cause
The master of perfection
Illuminated forever
We rejoice in the glory of thy name
