For each step I take from the past I rise
Empowered by the will to conquer the voice that lies
Transmutate the weakness, strength becomes the fortress, in a solitude of light I walk with all my might
Filled by a hunger, with a drive that makes me stronger
Fight through the agony, my destiny is to walk with fire

Feeding on the flame that leads me, through the void of existence
Reborn with the strength to rise
Summoning the one that leads you, through the void of existence

The time of reckoning, we stand, firmly for the ghost, the great I Am.
The mysteries concealed
Beyond our comprehension
Bleeding through the days of sorrow and despair
We feel the pain and shed the tears of the ones no longer here
All that remains, is to reclaim, pure water from the unstained, divinity of his name, without shame
So bring your legions
And march into the doom of eternity
I'm no longer silent
'Cause I'm walking with fire
