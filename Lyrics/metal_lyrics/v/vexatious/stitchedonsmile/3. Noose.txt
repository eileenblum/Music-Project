This life so fake and spiteful
Our minds are lost in evil

In the end we are left to succumb to the cold reality

My life is a lie that haunts me
This suffering, by the neck it hangs me
This noose is getting tighter as my body sways in the air

Falling and rolling and tumbling in the darkness that cages me
Trying to find a way out, a rope seems to be the only way
Swinging and swaying in the air
This rope is finally setting me free
My demons are stalking me

Falling and rolling and tumbling in the darkness that cages me
Trying to find a way out, a rope seems to be the only way
Swinging and swaying in the air
This rope is finally setting me free
My demons are stalking me

Like vultures
