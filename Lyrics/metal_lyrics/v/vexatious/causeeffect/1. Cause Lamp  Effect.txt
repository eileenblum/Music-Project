Karma is truly a beast.
You will taste vengeance, you will eat those horrible words that slipped right through your lips.

Were all dead, we will never forget, we all bleed red, your lies will never end.

You can't throw shade on a shadow, such foolishness, only leads.
You can't throw shade on a shadow, such foolishness, only leads to the collapse of your ego, karma is truly a beast.
Away with the keys, she has been released, inevitably, karma is truly a beast.

You can see the anticipation in her eyes, she'll feast on anyone dead or alive. Blood is dripping on the floor, how could she possibly still want more?
I can't fucking breathe.

There's, there's no hope for you.

Karma's gonna get you I can feel her getting richer, can you see the colors of the god damn picture, shes waiting, shes thirsty, I can feel her closing in.

Torturing the brain, strangling the soul, there is no control.
We are dead, we are dead.

Vexatious mother fucker, let's get it.

We're all dead, we will never forget, we all bleed red, your lies will never end.
