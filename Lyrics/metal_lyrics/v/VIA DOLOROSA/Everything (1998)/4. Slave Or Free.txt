Rising sun above the sky
Murdered bodies all around...
What have they done?
Look at yourself, where is your wisdom?
Do you want to die forever?
Why, why some people
Do not understand
What is what?
Look at yourself, where is your wisdom?
Where is your soul?!
Rising sun above the sky...
Wars, diseases, - people die,
Stupid violence is around,
Why, the fuck, you shred the blood?!
Why,
Why do you beleive in lie?
Who made us to live in it?
Look ta yourself, we wonat be fucking slaves,
We wonat be slaves!..
No!...
Slaves of lying cruel shit!
Real God, forgive me what Iave done...
Too much for my life,
Really too much...
We are no longer slaves!...
No!!!
