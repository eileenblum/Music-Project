1,2, 3, Fuck!...
I can not look at your face
Full of hatred and disgrace,
I can not look at your fuckina face...
Without strength in my sight
&amp; pain I hardly can fight
Withot sorrow from the heart
Cause I see thereas Death!
Death!
Death!
Killing you...
Abyss turning to hell...
Tears falling on dear face...
You know I see you, motherfucker,
Too much Iave seen you on my way...
But soon will come the day,
and you know that, fucker,
Judgement Day!...
And I'll call your name!

Without strength in my sight
and pain I hardly can fight
Withot sorrow from the heart
Cause I see theres Death!
Darling Death!
Darling Death!
My dear Death, Death!
