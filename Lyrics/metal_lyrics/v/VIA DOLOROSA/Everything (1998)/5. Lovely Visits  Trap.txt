Shadow of the dead
Standing near my bed
Wisper within my head:
Give me your hand...
Outside spirits, feral mares
Tell: Do it, no one cares,
Drink the bloody wine,
Cross the final line...
Cursed means blessed,
Lost are the best,
Find your rest in
Devils nest...
Let the madness rule your mind
Keep yourself out of light!

Shadows of the dead
Whisper near my bed:
Say the sacred word,
We will rule this world...
I often look at Your face
But canat stand despair I feel...
and comes the night
