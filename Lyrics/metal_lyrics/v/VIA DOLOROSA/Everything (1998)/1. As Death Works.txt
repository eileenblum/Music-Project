Everyone gets there anyway...
In this place there is no shelter,
Blood and flesh upon the altar,
Blames of fire getting high
Oh, my dear its time to die...
This will come to everyone
Cruel justice must be done
This will come to everyone...
Sacrifice must be given
Flesh and blood will be taken
Without any compromise
Death has come to close your eyes...
No one can help,
Thereas no escape,
End has come,
Life is gone...
Why do you think you live?
Youall have answer to give!
Nobody but only you must know what to do...
