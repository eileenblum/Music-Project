This is here all around...
Can you hear its pretty sound?
Can you see its face?
No escape from this place...
(I hate it!)
Always getting on your way,
Always coming, again and again,
(every day)
Thousand times every day
And (now) its always the same,
Forever the same...
Again and again I feel this sorrow,
Will I feel it tomorow, or will die today?...
(hate) Killing quag on my way (on my way),
Selfish bitches come again (selfish bitches cum),
Motherfuckers are their sons (of the bitch)
Full of demise!
Lies, lies, lies... and lies...
Everywhere I fell this pain (here, there, everywhere...)
And tormentor is the same (I hate him)
Itas a pitty, so many blind (are around)
He is here, look out!... (out, out, out...)
Again and again I feel this sorrow,
Will I feel it tomorow, or will die today?...
Can you do what you want?
Can you be who you are?
Can you live as you wish?
Do you beleive in love?...

Hey, you, donat ever give up!
There is something you can do
Just dont let it live in you
Open your eyes, try to realize
Who are you...
Who are you
Who are you
Who are you
Who are you...
