Anger in my mind, burning from inside,
Anger in my heart, Iam already got...
There is nothing new when I look at you,
when I see your face
Motherfucker, I detest you!
Life is the pain falling like an Autumn rain,
Trying to pierce everywhere it can... hurt.
I can look at you, I watch your work,
I can see it, oh, I feel it.
But I know that your final time has come,
your end is near...
The greatest tormentor,
The possessor of the blind enslaved in lies and hate,
My only wrath is addressed to you,
only to you,
And I fight against you, I curse you...
Raise the swords, face the enemy!
Raise your swords without any fear!
With no fear...
