Sometimes it comes to me
Comes like a burning fever
I can see all eternity and understand
Doesnt matter if Im dead or living...
You have felt this monstrous pain,
That could be your last day...
Will I ever find my rest?...
Maybe after death...
With the blackness in her eyes,
Forever being in everything and everywhere...
Due to... existance is
Full of sufferings and pain...
You have heard this fatal call,
Oh, you thought it would free your soul...
Will I ever be free?...
How I wish to be... free
Such is this reality,
Will you be free,
Or victim of fatality...
You have heard this fatal call,
Oh, you thought it would free your soul...
Will I ever be free?...
How I wish to be...
