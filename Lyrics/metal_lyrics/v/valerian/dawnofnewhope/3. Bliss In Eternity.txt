Timeâs passing by and the wind doesnât blow, Despair and pain that I feel. From the distance I can see, Thereâs a light so bright and warm
Blinding My eyes and embrace my soul. Give me a strength so I can go on. Take me away where I want to stay. Bliss In Eternity.

[Solo]

Tears On my eyes turn into ice, A fragile life is on the edge. From the distance I can see, Thereâs A light So bright and warm.
Blinding My eyes and embrace my soul. Give me a strength so I can go on. Take me away where I want to stay. Bliss In Eternity.
Here I stand in the luminous, A Place I called paradise.
No more tears just happiness, Farewellâs not the end. [2x]

[Solo]

Here I stand in the luminous, A Place I called paradise.
No more tears just happiness, Farewellâs not the end.
(Now I have gone and I never come back ,So donât cry for me
In a place there I want to stay ,my spirits never die).
