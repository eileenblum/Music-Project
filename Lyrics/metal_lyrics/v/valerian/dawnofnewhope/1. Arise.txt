So many memories and I can't forget. That night you drowned in the sea of lies. Hesitations in my mind burn my blood. Tragic tears flow from your eyes. And I swear, it won't be like this again. Cause I will change the time.
Now it's my time to release your pain. Longing for a day when we used to be. Just take my hand and belive in me. Life is a wonderful gift, so don't you waste it in vain.

I feel the hatred inside of your heart and it's blazing forever more. A wound that won't heal, a scar in your wish. Freezing your mind and your soul. And I swear, you won't feel lonely again. Cause I'll be there for you.
Now it's my time to release your pain. Longing for a day when we used to be. Just take my hand and belive in me. Life is a wonderful gift, so don't you waste it in vain.

[Solo]

And I swear, you won't feel lonely again. Cause I'll be there for you.
Now it's my time to release your pain. Longing for a day when we used to be. Just take my hand and belive in me. Life is a wonderful gift, so don't you waste it in vain.
