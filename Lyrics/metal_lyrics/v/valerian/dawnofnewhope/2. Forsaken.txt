Sadness, we feel loss in time. How many tears that we cried
It wonât change anything. Praying, itâs only waste of time.
And our dreams has perished, Our sins unleased the hell. Dead and the sorrow are only salvation.
We live in the land of the thousand disaster.
We crop in the soil of the million hate n breeder.
Tragedy lust of his divine creations.
Blood has been spilled in our forsaken land.
In the end , No one can save our souls. When the god of the mandkind. Has forsaken this land. Dead and the sorrow are only salvation.
We live in the land of the thousand disaster.
We crop in the soil of the million hate n breeder.
Tragedy lust of his divine creations.
Blood has been spilled in our forsaken land.

[Solo]

We live in the land of the thousand disaster.
We crop in the soil of the million hate n breeder.
Tragedy lust of his divine creations.
Blood has been spilled in our land.
We live in the land of the thousand disaster.
We crop in the soil of the million hate n breeder.
Tragedy lust of his divine creations.
This is the forsaken land.
