Dance on the edge of my insanity
Search for a key to confess
Shadow of past my primeval sin
Angel who fallen from grace

Cursed by the heaven eternally doom
Wait for the time until judgement day

I wish there were chances
To come back on your side
Rise from the darkness (Glorious day)
And I wish to be free
Like and eagle Iâll fly away
Journey through time
Where the sunshine (Enlighten my life)

[Solo]

Betrayer of life descended to hell
Forever dwells in the dark
Live in despair, baptized by flame
Wash away for what Iâve done
