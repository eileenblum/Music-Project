The light is fading away
Darkness engulf the daylight
The raven eyes are lurking
For vengeance and for glory
Composed by profound madness
Nightmare shall come upon them
Carnage, thereâs no forgiveness
All that remain is grimness

Feel the wrath inside your heart
Do not fear, take your blade
It will sanctify your life away

Die betrayers!!!
A taste of blood,
A sweet demise
There painful scream is what you need
To satisfy your righteous deed
For one again thereâs no escape
Forever in devilâs game
