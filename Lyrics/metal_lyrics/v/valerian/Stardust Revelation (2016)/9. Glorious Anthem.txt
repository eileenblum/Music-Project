Somehow your life is so poor, but don't let it sold
Here in the world made of game, you have to stay bold
They say "life is so cruel", but that is our goal
We dare to take decisions and this is for real

Now and forever, we're fighting together
Leaving behind all your sadness and grief
No more surrender, and we will endeavor
Fulfilling our fate, let us stand up and brief

Live just for once, glory we have to gain
While we are young, we will carry on
Stay on the line even it's full of pain
Never break up, we will rest when we are dead

Heaven's a place for the fame, no space for the lame
And if you try to be the same, you'll die in the shame

Raise up your hand, we're heading to victory
Our deed and our virtue will not be forgotten by time
