Calling the wisdom of the star
Upon the one cold winter night the spell is lingered in the shade of thy heaven
Words have spoken âEven we walk through the valleys of the dead, we shall not fearâ
Facing reality defying wicked destiny

Comeâ¦
Embrace the new world without bitterness in endless divinity
Feelâ¦
The warm of the light, lead into the cosmic serenity

A mesmerizing beauty falls from the sky, enchanting scenery
Through the eyes of seer vision become so clear
Revival of the century
