Vengeance is burning to claim what it's right
Blessing away all hatred at night
Out of the dark, out of the light
The vision is shinning so bright
The angel will born as a king who granted a grace

Breaking all curses
Set free from loneliness, gain the holiness
With honor and glory!!!
