"Remember that night when you said it's too late?
forgotten word could not redeem your sin"
I close my eyes and I see you alone
Trying to reach you out make you believe

Deep in my heart, I hear your doleful cry
Whispering, mesmerize me everyday
A glimpse of light in obscurity
When a trust has gone with misery

Forget your past and give me one last chance
With the wind of the night and we will sail away
To the place beyond reality

Waiting for a long time just to see you smile again
Wish that you were here my everlasting one
Never ending pain inside your heart and will be healed
For once and forever no need to shed any tears
