Time is running out, we are getting to old
Trying to escape from the void of the world
Struggling for a freedom cause victory is gold
Leaving all behind your pain and grief!!!

One step to the end, tyranny will be gone
Adoring with pride because we are the one
Make up your wish and everything is done
Do not be afraid just follow the rhyme!!!

This is the time to reunite
Gathering forces to strikes back
History will be made

Rise!!!
Journey has begun
Fighting till the end, futureâs in your hand
Reach out all of your dreams and make them come true
We're going to break through!!!

Taking all the chances without hestitate
Let fill your heart with enormous hate
Join to the battle and do not be late
Do not be afraid or we will die
