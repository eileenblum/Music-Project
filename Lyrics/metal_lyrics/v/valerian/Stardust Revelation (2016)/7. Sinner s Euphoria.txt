Daunting night is raging, beneath the crescent moon
A razorblade salvation's dancing on your silky skin
Taste the sweetest wine, a crimson red emotion
Flowing like a river pleasure my beast within

Demonic deed and serpentine lust adorned with wicked sensation
A horrific ambition let me drown into the sin

Far away from light and bring me to the end of misery
And never come back
Everything is gone and I walk to the emptiness of soul
The Sinner's Euphoria

Fiery hatred is burning bright relieve my forlorn depression
A diabolic devotion let me drown into the sin
