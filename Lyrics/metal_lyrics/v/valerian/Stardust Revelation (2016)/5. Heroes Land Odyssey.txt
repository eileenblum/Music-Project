Frozen sun and despair above, beyond the misty afterglow
Of whole chaos, the madness grows
And war of witchering steel
Clouds turn grey and thunder light, deeper sins are so horrified
Lullaby of the starless night
Paralyzed, indecent, misery

Infamy and Insanity, torturing all humanity
For the triumphant of our land, we will raise our victory
Oh Dear Lord give us dignity to defend from this life's obscurity
Reach for our freedom eternally

Through the land we will sing the gloriness
By our hands are loaded with golden spears
Here and stand, we'll survived the heroes land
Evermore and burning all fears
Through the land we'll hail our togetherness
Glorify the revival century
Here and stand, weâll survived the land of mess
We will fly for the true victory
