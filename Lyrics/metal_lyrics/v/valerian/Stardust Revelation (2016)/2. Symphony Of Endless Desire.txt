Long time ago, devil ripped out my heart
Suffer and dying, I remember it was hurt
Vengeance is burning to claim what it's right
Blessing away all my hatred at night

Out of the dark, out of the light
An endless trip to delight
The angel will born as a king who granted a grace
Breaking all curses, I donât waste the chance

Always endeavor to fulfill my quest
Heading the call and I will hunt that wicked beast
Towards the end of my valorous deed
I will not die until I see her bleed

Into the fire
Set me free from loneliness
Allied with the shadow of madness and fury
Into the fire
I will gain the holiness
Sanctify my soul with honor and glory
