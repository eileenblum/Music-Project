Revealing the unspoken words like a death wish sinner
Stabs the heart of a man
Promising the gift of life, an infernal matrimony, a delicate way to live
A betrayal to live in!

Entangled by passion and lust
The form of beauty seems to fade away into agitation
Fall into the deepest chamber of vain and despair
A sweet temptation, agonizing truth!

Kill your heart!
Don't look back just take the blade
Make it quick!
Donât waste your time just let it go
Taste the pain!
A dawn of new hope is yet to come

Now or never, we'll take what's your belong
As long as your God still there for you
Nowhere to run, there's no place, you canât hide!
Blamming your faith is a way you can do? Unworthy gift, melodramatic life!
"An elegy of the unspoken words"
