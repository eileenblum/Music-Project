Look inside, see your secrets
and live and die, we live on secrets.
Push out your hands, push at your lies,
Push at your time, say goodbye
Pick up your clothes, lift up your hands
Look at your fingers end all time,
Chop your head off say goodye.

To hell, to die, to kill, to fall
To hell, to die, to kill, to fall
To hell to die, to kill, to fall
To hell to die, to get away form you
to hell to get away form you.
To hell to get to get away from you.

To suck, to fuck, to hate, to die
To suck, to fuck, to hate, to lie
To kill myself for you, to die
To hate, to suck, I can't get high
Lie so die, how I kill myself for you
Die, die, I kill myself for you.
so sad, to hate everything inside
In my mind I should die

Goodbye.
(RANT)
