This asset a chameleon a million eyes ripping in places settle down to find
cold places you live your life on a broken face her majesty following me to
control this impurity our machines that never taught you how yo love or be
free containment containment isolation a fair call your weeping soul lost
in futility of this righteous way to be so hold yourself so cry till death
and your hands ripping up everything that you ever loved.

She can't see the light a vision not so bright
She put me in this hole a seeping carnivore
she found the key to live in something I must give
A putrid parasite she thinks she's always right
She cannot see a night her future burns so bright
She put me in this hole a creeping carnivore
She found the key to live in something I must give
A putrid parasite she thinks she's always right

Freeze on a balcony of this stage covered in broken glass that scrapes up
all the sands of your time running low why did you sell your sould why did
you let me go I never understood this game so please refrain from tormenting
me.

She can't see the light a vision not so bright
She put me in this hole a seeping carnivore
she found the key to live in something I must give
A putrid parasite she thinks she's always right
She cannot see a night her future burns so bright
She put me in this hole a creeping carnivore
She found the key to live in something I must give
A putrid parasite she thinks she's always right
I must be out of time I could be out of life
I must out of time I could be out of mind
I must be out of my mind I cannot see this light
I don't know why this is I cannot give to live
