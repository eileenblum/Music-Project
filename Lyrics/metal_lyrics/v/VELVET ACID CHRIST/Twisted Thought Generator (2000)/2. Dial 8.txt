On a sea of nails in self doubt
I push this feeling further into this sound.
In all this failing i could never hide
The truth of pain that left me broken on the inside.

We are the future, We are the lie
Trapped in holy innocence we only wish to thrive
We are the nightmare buried deep in your mind
We are the travesty sweetened with your pain.

Alive, Alive, but Barely Alive.
Alive, Alive, but Barely Alive.

Shepherds spreading death
Dragged outside shot in the head.
Holy maimed again.
Dragged outside shot in the head.

A million faces in a bloody shroud
I hear their voices calling me to put you down.
Covered in blood, drowning in my hate
I covered my eyes, I covered your eyes
I covered my eyes.

We are the cancer eating at your mind.
We are the ministries for all of your crimes.

Shepherds spreading deaht.
Dragged outside shot in the head
Holy maimed again.
Dragged outside shot in the head
Dragged outside shot in the head
Holy maimed, holy maimed again.
