Falling down further in this void
How was that you who left me here half asleep could drown me
Falling in love with this feeling I follow you to hell
Now I bleed softly in this space out there far out there

Leaving me thin and wasted, dried up and eviscerated
Strung out, fully sedated, my will totally eradicated
Who would of thought that this would eat my grasp
Destroy my past.
This behavior who could condone, my mind, postponed

One black spot sucked in a hole totally loosing control
Floating higher till I fall rapidly to hell barely connected to this soul
Now I breathe softly in this crate out there so far out there

Leaving me thin and wasted, dried up evaporated
Strung out, fulyl sedated, my sould obliterated
Who would of thought that this would feed this lapse
Control my past.
This behavior who would condone, my mind, postponed
