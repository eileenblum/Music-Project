Holding me down in a mess an onholy wreck
A lost way to be, lost in the of my own dripping blood
I don't know what to expect I'm lost in this wreck
Torn apart from 10 different sides, they lie to me and whisper in my ears
The secrets of my lust for you and turned it upside down
Lost in the cloud on top of the world right now
On this velvet pill that makes me so fucking ill.
Never loose respect for this reject you worship over and over again.
The pill, the lie, the blood in my eyes.

A velvet pill
A lifeless thrill
Erotic chill

So closed so empty so nothing could touch me.
So closed so so empty so nothing could touch me.
She said I'm not your future. I'm your sorrow
There won't be tomorrow. I promised you this sacred kiss
To fall apart to fall apart.

Full of this hae only to relate she said she loves me but she kills me
This cry, the fire in her eyes burning me inside
I found a reason why she mangled in this life
No time to worry she says, she says

Fall apart, to fall apart, you fall apart, we fall apart.
A velvet pill
Erotic chill
A jagged scar
A Red Mark
A blue spark
A Red Mark
Last...  remark

(RANT)
