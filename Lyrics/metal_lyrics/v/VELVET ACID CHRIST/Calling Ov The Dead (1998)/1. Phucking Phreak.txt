Murder the feelings all left aside, from all those days you try to hide, you lift out the anger and cut it dry, you soak your tears away, now you can fry. your mind melts away, you go with the flow, you hold it down, but ya can't let go. you try to speak, but you hear no sound, lying again expressed into insanity, where you will never be. cause we're all dead, cause you're all dead, cause we're all dead, cause you're all dead, cause we're all dead, cause you're all dead, cause we're all dead, cause you're all dead. we walk into the night, we cut off the right, we won't feel a thing, we're so insane. disturbed thoughts, distort your mind, you're penetrated, obliterated. we all fake it, we all try to hide, the un-relying, the lie, the feelings, the how, the when, the why. we always lie, we always lie, we always cry, we always die. push away the feeling lef t, so far away, we walked into the sun, and left our hopes astray, we hope to live another day, but when you break it all down. there's really nothing left to say, there's really nothing left to say there's really nothing left to say, so babble away, so babble away.
