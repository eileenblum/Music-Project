do you pray for life do you kick and scream do you sell your dreams for everything do you pray for life do you kick and scream do you sell your dreams for everything when souls are tortured life is a mess and everything is just your best as always lost in dreams and visions now i let go of the flow in my heads i see you die my vision make me want to cry forever lost in time spinning twitching losing control the rage of existence shooting my soul the crazy deeds of society batter my mind kill everything the edge of knife splatters my life kicks me in the head and leaves me dead for reason's unknown the clock spins backwards reversing time and space no time is left to contemplate pray for life pray for life when souls are tortured life is a mess and everything is just your best as always lost in dreams and visions i let go of the flow in my head i see you die goodbye goodbye goodbye spinning twitching losing my head the grates of existence smashing me dead what is the time what is your goal what is your life we're nothing but fun we see right through the night in a red light seeping on me why do you try to express this generation there's nothing left for their obliteration pray for life
