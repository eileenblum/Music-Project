Forever in our illusions, forever in our fate
Forever in our illusions, forever in our fate

Welcome to our misery
Welcome to our dreadful dreams
Welcome to our misery
Welcome to our dreadful dreams

We are your unholy masters
Begging you to stay
We are your own honest answers
Driving us insane

We are your unholy masters
Begging you to stay
We are our own honest answers
Driving us insane

Disintegrate or fade the undying open grave
Disintegrate or fade the undying open grave
Disintegrate or fade the undying open grave
