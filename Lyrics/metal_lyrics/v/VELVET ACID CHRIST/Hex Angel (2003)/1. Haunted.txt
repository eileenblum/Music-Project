Treachery abstinence in consequence,
Open eyes blinded to the obvious
Right wing twitch spreading the disease
Of Idiocies conquering with ease
Tonight, Tonight I slowly bleed
Haunted by the will of unease
Shattered by the sound of your screams
Tonight, Tonight I watch you plea
Gasping for air, holding your throat
Choking feeling starts to distort
Propaganda for future wars
Nothing ever settles the score
No relief for ignorant stress
Mindless fiends under duress
Vomit from your crooked mouth
Scratch and claw you can't get out
The mocking voices never end
Pointless views are such a trend
Wish I was a holy savior
I'd turn my back on all of you
Wish you were a different person
One that wasn't so confused
Vomit from your crooked mouth
Scratch and claw you can't get out
The mocking voices never end
Pointless views are such a trend
Wish I was a cruel infection
Killing off most all of you
Wish you were a rotting corpse
Haunting all of those like you
Tonight, Tonight, Tonight I watch you bleed
Tonight, Tonight, Tonight I hear you scream
Tonight, Tonight, Tonight I watch you plea
Tonight, Tonight, Tonight I watch you bleed
Tonight, Tonight, Tonight I hear you scream
