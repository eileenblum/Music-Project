Hold, hold me down, make me wish, make me wish for air
Call out your name, slowly drain the hate out of me
You're all the same, half inane, lack of brains.
Too much time I'm on my own again
Too much thought to ever see again
Too much sense to ever hear again
Too much hate to see a different end
Too much fear to concentrate again
Too much love to ever feel again
Ugly fears, Ugly face
Ugly thoughts, Leave no trace
Of innocence
The world inside breaking down
The world inside breaking down
Murder all these feelings trapped inside
Murder all these feelings trapped inside
reject everything reject everything
reject everything reject everything
reject everything reject everything
reject everything reject everything
Too much time I'm on my own again
Too much hate to see a different end
Too much fear to concentrate again
Too much love to ever feel again
Ugly fears, Ugly face
Ugly thoughts, Leave no trace
Of innocence
Holding on to words that let go softly
As you whisper into my ears only
Drowning in a pool of all of the tears
Nights and days they seem to drag on
All around you sense the sound
You don't even listen any more
