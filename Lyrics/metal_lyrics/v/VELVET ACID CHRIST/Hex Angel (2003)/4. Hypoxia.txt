Can't breath, Can't talk
Can't make sense at all
You twitch, I watch
The barriers fall
Breath my name in contempt
hold my eyes in your hands
Frozen as you cry the words
I swore I never hear you talk
Smile again, it never mends
reach out to those
who never ever cared
reach out to those who run scared
a lack of oxygen, break or bend
weakened from the trends that
rape and burn the world
Burn the world, burn the world

Breathing, can't see at all
Cheating, the reason that we fall
Lying, I didn't hear the call
Crying, The death of us all
Breathing, can't see at all
Lying, I didn't hear the call
Cheating, the reason that we fall
Crying, the death of us all
Breathe my name in contempt
hold my eyes in your hands
Frozen as you cry the words
I swore I never ever hear you talk
Can't breath, Can't talk
Can't make sense at all
Can't breath, Can't talk
Can't make sense at all
