Voiceless, Useless in their game
Sightless, Blinded by their rage
Heartless, All their Endless plagues
Pointless, Gagging on their pain
Collapsed, Collapsing
Collapsed, Collapsing
Collapsed, Collapsing
Collapsed, Collapsing
Where were you when the bombs dropped?
When the time stopped
When the ticking clock hit zero
Turned to rust into dust
Turned to rust
Where were you when the bombs dropped?
When the time stopped
When the ticking clock hit zero
Turned to rust into dust
Turned to rust
Entombed Infused breathing oil for their views
Entombed Infused breathing oil for their views
Entombed Infused breathing oil for their views
Entombed Infused breathing oil for their views
Voiceless, Useless in their game
Sightless, Blinded by their rage
Heartless, All their Endless plagues
Pointless,
Collapsed, Collapsing
Collapsed, Collapsing
Collapsed, Collapsing
Collapsed, Collapsing
Where were you when the bombs dropped?
When the time stopped
When the ticking clock hit zero
Turned to rust bit the dust
Turned to rust
