Such a pretty toy
Such a pretty toy to play with
Such a pretty toy
Such a pretty toy to play with

A Gun on the floor
A hole in your head
Just like a whore
You wish you were dead

A gun on the floor
A hole in your head
Just like a whore
You wish you were dead

In your eyes, In your neck
In your mind, In your heart
In your eyes, In your mind
In your heart, In your soul

In your eyes, In your neck
In your mind, In your heart
In your eyes, In your mind
In your heart, In your soul

Such a pretty toy to play with
Such a pretty toy to play with
Such a, such a, such a pretty toy
Such a pretty toy to play with
