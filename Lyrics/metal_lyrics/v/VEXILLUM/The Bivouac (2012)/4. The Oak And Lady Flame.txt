Quiet on his hill, with his branches in a breeze
An Oak was waving, unaware of his fate

He became the shelter, on a rainy day
For a young wayfarer, who held a flame in a lamp

The young boy ran away and left her alone
Would be her last day at the roots of the Oak

But he spread his strong branch, he built a safe place
The rain didn't quench her, first sight, face to face

She was shining, Lady Flame, she was shy...
The Oak was not able to stop watching her eyes...
Her warm voice... seems to sing... Let me burn...

LET ME BURN!
I feel a weird will to get out of my light
And embrace your crown, cause you make me safe
LET ME BURN!
It was not expected, it was a surprise
I'm sorry if it happened, but I feel you are mine...
LET ME BURN!

But something was weird
While the great flame went on
He knew she was fading
And she saw he was burnt

They were looking in their eyes
So near, so far away
Coming back in her light
Lady Flame sadly said:
âYou're in my heart
And you live in my mind
We just need an embrace, to set us on fire...
Would be great for a while
Our blaze seen for miles
But my heat will burn you
I'm afraid for what we could lose..."

They knew what they were forced to do...
The reason was facing the passions within
The first creating concern and fears
Passions instead, leaves hope and tears...

In this night, silently, please... let me burn...

LET ME BURN!
Let your sparkling eyes watch the world from my arms
Let your flame dance with the wind of the night
LET ME BURN!
I can't wait for your touch, I can't wait for your heat
I can't think to see you and be not able to feel

LET ME... May it be
LET ME... A day far away
LET ME... How we can't say
LET ME... Oak will embrace in an
LET ME... Unending age
LET ME... Lady flame
LET ME... Again!

LET ME BURN!
Let me burn of your voice, let me burn, I've no choice
Let the sound of our flame surrounds all the vale
LET ME BURN!
I don't mind what tomorrow will bring to us
Until the end in the future, not a thought in the past
