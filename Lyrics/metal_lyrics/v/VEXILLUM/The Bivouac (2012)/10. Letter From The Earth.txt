I can hear your voice singing your passions
Your aims, your moods, and every single part of you...
In your eyes I see the strong will to grow up
Even if, sometime, your mind forgets me!

Decided for your proudness, from time
To trace your path alone
I'm so disappointed
Cause I see your fall comes so fast
Like a drifting boat, on the sea, prowling in the haze
Remember me, your guide on this path

I see the ground, not the wall
We'll create the strongest one
I see the paper, not the words, we will write those
I see your map, not my course
We will trace one for our own
I see the notes, I see the melodies, we'll play those

I can't believe that you forgot the gift you received
A gift I made for all of humankind
For you and your sons
I write this letter to your heart
Cause you are slowly going blind
You have to change your way to move
You have to stop these fools

It's a warning for you all
For those who care their raped world
I'm cure, you know what to choose
You are still in time!
It's the only way, change your views!

I hope you find that peace that you have destroyed,
I can only say, where is the right way
And I walk beside you!

I see the ground, not the wall
We'll create the strongest one
I see the paper, not the words, we will write those
I see the map, not the course
We will trace one for our own
I see the notes, I see the melodies, we will play those
And when the dark decides to come
You'll be able with the stars
Not walk ahead, not walk behind, only walk beside!
I see the paper, not the words, we will write those
I see your map, not my course, we will trace one
