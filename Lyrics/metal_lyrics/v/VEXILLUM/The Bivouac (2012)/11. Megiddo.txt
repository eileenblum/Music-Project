In a far and ancient land, the power of a ruthless hand
Enslaves and all burns
Steady at any cost to reach, dominion cutting meat
With false promises tries to cheat

Through the rivers through the sands
Searching for a good new land
To exploit with a smile so bland

Water, woods, ground and all the men
Who welcome you giving the hand
The awareness: a word he can withstand
The flame still burns, the new plagues are here
I have something to say

Overhanging the same fear of ancient crag
My call in raging sun
Hear the calling, shadows come back from the past
The void is come

Like a swarm of roaches
Eat and nothing leave for the coming kids
Some sort of a boil, some sort of a skin disease
Turn dark like a bruise

Welcome to the land of darkness, keep walking
Carry on the race
Ten plagues come back from past
Same story but this time it's not god's blame

Can see the overhanging?
Call the raging sun
