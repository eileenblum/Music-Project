We carry on this way, we're searching for a place
Where, is told, you can feed your body and your mind
Not a sanctuary, nor seems a church, an old man sings:
"Welcome to the Last Inn!!!'

How many faces I see in
How many faces I'll meet again?
The starting point for most
And a point of no return!
Here you can rest before your journey knows
Hardest times for long

Welcome to the Last Inn
Where the time seems to stand still
Never mind where are you born
And where you came from
Never mind, the kind of your aim
If you're proud or ashamed

Welcome to the Last Inn
Where the richness is just all your skill
No one will ask
If it's your face
Or just another mask
No one'll rejoice
About your disgrace
Or award your race

The copped thief doesn't think to steal
Because no laws will protect him
The eager is bidding beer
The brave men charge the near
The coward seems to lose his fear!

WE ARE THE SAME!!!
In front of the host's eyes!
EVERYONE LIFE
Has shade and light!
WHAT YOU HAVE DONE
Is the gold you can exchange!
IT'S THE LAST CHANCE
To map out your next path!

This is the last sweet home
The next one you don't know
How many miles you have to walk
How many eyes you have to cross
Here you can be
What you should be
The master of your voice!

The road is long, if your goal is worth
The road is long, don't think this is wrong
So drink and rest, my dear guest
So sing and dance, tonight begins your quest!
