A smile like a mask
Not an answer when you ask
He moves his hands just to carry on his plans
Watching deeply in your eyes
He already knows he's lying
He don't care about your thoughts about your cries!

Change the meaning of the words
And you will dominate the world!

Dethrone the Tyrant, stop the silence
Raise your scream, awake your dreams
Let his words be falling lost
Dethrone that king, remove his crown

He was the owner of the words
No restrain, no shame, no laws
He should be the first with us
Not the first of us!
Sparkling nothing in your eyes
Many tricks to justify
He makes you believe you dominate your fate!

Down in the road, people start to know
Tired to comply, to hide, people start to talk

Rounded from his trusted man
Always ready to be squashed
He plays a game, a conquest game!
Here we are as rolling dice

Puppets he can sacrifice!
He wants that we are weak!
Precious lymph for his own reign!

Move the shadows on the wall
And you will dominate the world

Dethrone the Tyrant, stop the silence
Raise your scream, awake your dreams
Let his words be falling lost
Dethrone that king, remove his crown

We want back the ability to trust
We want back our freedom
Time has come for everyone to raise his head
Time has come, you will know our rage!
For our sons!

Dethrone the Tyrant, stop the silence
Raise your scream, awake your dreams
Let his words be falling lost
Dethrone that king, remove his crown
