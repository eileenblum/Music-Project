After the storm - WE STAND
Sailing again, discovering new lands...
WE FOLLOW THE WIND
Your eyes can be fooled, and lose every rules...
Under the sun - WE RUN!
Leaving each place, our own trace...
We tell our thoughts, we tell what we meet,
WE TELL ALL THE PEOPLE, THE FEARS,
THE NEEDS...

October 29, a shipwreck slows down the pace
The journey's end was painted on our scared faces
In the trouble, in the danger, we start to remember
What we earn, what we give, what we still believe

One page for an old man's folk story
One page for a woman's deep eyes
Even for a pain, even for a lie
A blank page you will find...

Carry on, feel the road
Where the journey ends again we don't know!
Once again, cross the edge
We keep alive what we live with this line!

And you cannot write until you have lived
How many words will fill this page?

Maybe a tale, maybe a rhyme
MAYBE A LOVE YOU CANNOT REQUITE!
A lesson you give, and the thousand received!
WE WANT REMEMBER ALL!

December 27, the first time we sail together
We don't know where is the way
But the quest for us, now, is the same

We leave the home, we leave affections
To take our own direction
We want it all, we keep on fighting
No disguise no compromise!
