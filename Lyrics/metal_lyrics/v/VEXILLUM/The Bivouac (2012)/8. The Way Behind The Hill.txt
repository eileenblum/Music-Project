Welcome to my eyes full of joy
I embrace the sun like a dad with his boy
How many tales I have in mind
A road full of folk is in front and behind

Searching for a new aim
How many odd fellows I'll meet in this game?
Whether you roaming or if you have a plan
Get your stuff, a new day has begun

A new dawn is again in my eyes
I've got a smile on my face and the sun in the sky
Step by step, man by man I see a place
I can stop here or keep walking my way
Not all who wonders is lost in the night
I'm tasting my life like it was the last bite
Needful of choice he is starving for play
The seasons change but we are still the same

When I'm old and feeble and in my sickness I'll rave
Wrap me in a blanket and give me what I crave
I have no remorse I've followed my stream
Don't you see that I gleam?

When you call for a candle to light the new path
When you sleep beside a fire
With some new road's friends
When the sunshine warm kisses your face
You feel a voice telling âcarry on this way"
When our world seems too big for a single glance
Into the storm you think this is a game of chance
When the rain, so cold, kiss your face
You feel a voice telling âcarry on this way"
Waiting for another day

On the road he walks alone
It's the house where our brother has grown
When I close my eyes I can see your smile
When he raises his eyes up to sky
Then he can see the approaching night
In these times I miss my fireside

Ships will come and ships will go
As long as the sea will play its role
A trip on sea a trip on shore
Until my heart will not be sore
