I'm gonna to tell a new story now
Of hope, desire and pain
The dream of a king, the quest begins
So pay attention to me!
It's not too late, no it's not too late
Don't fall yet asleep
I'll take care of your dreams, with all the sweet
Words my tongue has ever tasted

Luriel was kind, beautiful rich
A nice man, strong and safe
He had his home, he had his fields
His cow a wife a child

Nothing less, nothing more, the perfect life for him
He said a gift, a precious thing god has blessed me

Nothing is taken for granted
When you don't have what you want
Who owns it does not notice it lacks
Until he loses what he loves

Working hard, working well
Day by day the story repeats itself
Lay aside, lay aside no time to play with your child
Are you the father that he deserves?
Are you the father that he deserves?
Are you the husband that he deserves?

Nothing is taken for granted
When you don't have what you want
Who owns it does not notice it lacks
Until he loses what he loves

Please my lord
Please my lord open your eyes and see
What I have, what I had, why it happened to me?
Tell me lord, tell me lord...
What I have done to deserve
To lose my loves my precious things
Nothing less nothing more, I want them back

Now he is a poor man who begs for gold
He lives in the dust in the sludge
The night he still dreams to have again it all
He leaves this life dreaming of his past
