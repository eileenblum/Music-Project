A new dawn is come, my rucksack is done
Another day, another path wherever I will run
No time to say goodbye, no one is by my side
My mission is my new dimension
What I will find?

Running fast, grazing all the barks
The trees are moving all their arms
I'm streaking beaten tracks
I track the trail, I smell the air
I leave the river on my back I find myself

Looking at your eyes
You are gazing at mine
I can feel your breath
While my arrow is flying

Brother forgive me for what I have done
As hunter you found me, on this way we were bound
I'll pray for your soul for your sacrifice

As hunter you found me, as brother I will cry
Your strength will help my son
Your wisdom will guide my heart
As hunter you found me
Through your eyes no more be blind

I overcame the falls
The lair of the wolf
Do I deserve the gift?
Do I deserve to come back home?

And when the final blow has reached the unlucky goal
What will I tell your son?
Water, bow, speed and honest thoughts
This is all I need today to face my way

I'll tell your story, your deserved glory
I'll wait for my time to pay for my crime
Impartial justice, respect for everyone
The same chance to live or die
The chance to fall or rise
