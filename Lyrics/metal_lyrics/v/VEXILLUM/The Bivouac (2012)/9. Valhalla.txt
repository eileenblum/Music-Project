White snow covers the fields
The sky is now empty and blue
I wear my armour and shield
I ride my horse to fight this war

My father is by my side
Fighting together for what is right
"I'm going to die my dear son
we'll meet again where we're reborn"

There is a place where we will go
Ancestors call it âGolden Hall"

In battle we fight, for glory we die
Valkyries shall be our guides

Valhalla - Hall of the braves
Valhalla - Home of the knights
Valhalla I'm waiting for you!
Valhalla

You'll place my body on a ship
And burn it in the sea

Your eyes will see my spirit rise
One of Odin's valiant knights!

Only the purpose you have in your life
Reaches the glory during the fight
We're ready to strike, don't cry my son
We will still be alive in lots of songs...

They will tell of rise or fall
We will sing from the Golden Hall
