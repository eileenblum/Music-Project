The first light is coming, the merchant is done
The village is slowly awaken its eyes.
Quickly the people are filling the streets,
The voices and laughs increase everywhere
The bard is telling and singing folk stories
Enchanted children are dancing around

[BARD:]
Now with my guitar, my voice and my words
I'll control in a flash all your thoughts
Let the children dance and follow me I will gladden your dreams!"

Fishermen come back from an hard night of work
The fruit of sea turn into gold
Black cloud of ash over red forge
The blacksmith is teaching his art to his son
An old man of god with empty saint words
Punishment and sorrow promise to the crowd

[PRIEST:]
"Damned you are liars and sinners!
Fire and brimstone will be your damnation!
The lust you allow, will bring you in pain
You will settle your blames!"

Through my eyes I can see who forever I'll defend
I have sworn and I'll give!
I will give my all to keep for you this flame alive
For my king I will die!

The host in his inn serve always drink
Red wine and beer flow everywhere
Because of these rivers, cross and delight,
Guards are sedating a spirited broil
Some people sing remark, drink and laugh!

[TAVERN:]
"We love this beer, we love this wine
No one delete like this our pains
We drink together...
[OLD NASTY MAN:]
"Look at this fool!!!
[TAVERN:]
"They are spilling the wine!"

Through my eyes I can see who forever I'll defend
I have sworn and I'll give!
I will give my all to keep for you this flame alive
For my king I will die!
