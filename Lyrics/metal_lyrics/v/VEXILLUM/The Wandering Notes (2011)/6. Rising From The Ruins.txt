What can you do when the clouds are above,
Maybe the shadows imprison your heart,
Thinking to daemons of your trouble past,
Your eyes betray the insecurity one!

Run away, today, because it's the time!
Sometimes your mind can be blind, but follow the sign!
It isn't too late!!!

Fly, with your strong wings in the sky like an eagle
Lies, desperation for your rough and insanity mind,
Fly, with your strong wings in the sky like an eagle
Fly, for salvation, to forget your own terrible words!

Fight everyone with your sword made of steel,
The winter is coming again!
Under the stars you can feel it in the air,
Deep inside your soul

Carry on the age is coming, see the black beast,
Can you withstand in the light?

Run away, today, because it's the time!
Sometimes your mind can be blind, but follow the sign!
It isn't too late!!!

Into the dusk he had whisper to you,
promise of glory and pride in your head,
The only one cries into your jail,
Can they forgive for what you have done?

Run away, today, because it's the time!
Sometimes your mind can be blind, but follow the sign!
It isn't too late!!!

Fly, with your strong wings in the sky like an eagle
Lies, desperation for your rough and insanity mind,
Fly, with your strong wings in the sky like an eagle
Fly, for salvation, to forget your own terrible words!

Fly into the sky to forget your lies
Lies into the shadows behind you
Fly into the sky, don't forget lies
Live with honour without all your fears
