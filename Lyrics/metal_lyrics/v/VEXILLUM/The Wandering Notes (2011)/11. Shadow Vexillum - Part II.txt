From an ancient piece of wear
All the story really starts,
When the truth was overcame by lies.

Yes because that day on block,
Had been hung a man without a fault,
This injustice gave a soul to his cloth!

You can think you win and conquer all
The flag is binding you!

They had to fight to wait the time,
The flag decides to leave their souls alive
No way to run, it check your soul,
The bearer can die but the vexillum can't fall

That piece of robe became a flag,
A sign with a soul, a mind and an aim,
The redemption of the bearer's heart.

It show to them their evil part,
It forces them to wish and gain,
And when they understand...it's not too late!

Through the darkness you can reach the road,
You'll be already caught!

Under this sign, slowly they gather together,
Quietly it crept in their human mind,
To show to them the shelter...

They had to fight to wait the time,
The flag decides to leave their souls alive
No way to run, it check your soul,
The bearer can die but the vexillum can't fall
