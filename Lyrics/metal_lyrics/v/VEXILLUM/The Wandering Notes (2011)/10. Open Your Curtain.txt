All the people around you
Never met who you are!
When you sing your song
I don't hear any kind of sound!

Look in the mirror, asking for more,
I'm not too strong, I play on my own!

Leave me alone, I don't mind what you think
In my past I learnt, we can't change anything!

Look in the mirror, asking for more,
I'm not too strong, I play on my own!

Open your curtain it's time, to play your part,
Your show now begins, move your threads by yourself!
Open your curtain it's time, to play your part,
Your show now begins, move your threads by yourself!

What's the meaning of a drop?
It's your voice in the choir!

Forgive all the fears and turn up the voice
Holding your breath in front of the choice

Open your curtain it's time, to play your part,
Your show now begins, move your threads by yourself!
Open your curtain it's time, to play your part,
Your show now begins, move your threads by yourself!
