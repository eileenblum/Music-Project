[THE BRAVE:]
"Yes for me the highest mountains
Are only another piece of my path.
Dangers no more scared me if someone believe in my skills,
For my deals and my ideals I'm ready to strike everyday,
I'm not afraid to die, if my death make someone else safe!"

[THE CRAVEN:]
"I prefer the easiest chance
If a junction arise on my way,
I think is better stand still here instead of make a mistake,
I don't mind at all if someone will certainly die,
I have to think about myself or the freedom will never be mine!"

Face to face, slowly embrace, find two faiths,
Flee away, forced to stay, different braves,
What's the meaning of your deeds?

The fear is scales for their choices and rules them all,
Reveals their kind and changes, streams into falls,
Two ways to face anything in our life,
Which one you will choose?
Will fight or hide?

From an unexpected madness
Every kind our decision will stem,
We can try to hide our guide,
But pulse is overcoming the mind
You can find the courage in denial!
Cowardice is lurking while, in our hearts she lies!

The fear is scales for their choices and rules them all,
Reveals their kind and changes, streams into falls,
Two ways to face anything in our life,
Which one you will choose?
Will fight or hide?

The line is so thin, we are the actions we do,
You are the brave, but the craven will win sometime!
Together have a place in you!

The fear is scales for their choices and rules them all,
Reveals their kind and changes, streams into falls,
Two ways to face anything in our life,
Which one you will choose?
Will fight or hide?
