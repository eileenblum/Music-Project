Too much time in front of the sea,
My time stand still away from my ship,
The time is come to leave my certainty!

Vellum, ink and compass in my bag,
No destination fixed on the map,
The wind will be engine for my curiosity!

I sail the ocean in top of my ship,
I climb the mountains by my feet,
I write my diary while I grow...

And the future is no more in my mind,
Cause I have to taste a little while,
As if being the last breath in my life!

There is something in his eyes,
That you will never realize!
The traveller is left, the world he borrows...

When the wind will blow hard like the time of my land
I will finally open my sails!
So farewell my dear friends it's my quest just began
To trace the stars in search for my path!

My quest is will and desire,
Knowledge, consciousness and pride,
Go on the road, keep the life alive!

And when I'll meet you again, I will not be changed,
But normalcy has been changed you (No fear to return)
But join with me or don't wait for me!

There is something in his eyes,
That you will never realize!
The traveller is left, the world he borrows...

When the wind will blow hard like the time of my land
I will finally open my sails!
So farewell my dear friends it's my quest just began
To trace the stars in search for my path!
