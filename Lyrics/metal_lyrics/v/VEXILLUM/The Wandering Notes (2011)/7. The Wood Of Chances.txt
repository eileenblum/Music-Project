Give me a mask and I will show the truth,
The stories tell of a man who didn't choose.
The steps to do, the way to take his shine,
The only way to keep what he desired!

You are just a son of an old illusion,
You can't see, but follow me!

Just a simple man who walks in to the woods,
In a clearing he found some beautiful blooms,
But one more than others was bewitching,
But he doesn't want spoil it's beauty for his yearning!

You are just a son of an old illusion,
You can't see, but follow me!
In this scary starless night, put your hands inside mine
I will drive you through the real world!

He decided to bring this flower, to his undercover love,
But the march of time plays tricks, my friend you know...
All he wanted now is gone, changes his mind to carry on,
But no one can give back to him his love.
