Running through the moorlands
And running through the forest,
Just running through his life like a soul which runs alive,
Running through the cities and running just alone
He runs through the world which no king to die!

Looks the faces in front of him,
He can hears their souls whisper alone,
He can sees the man through the door,
How many days he walks alone...
Sees the people which live in this land,
how many days can lives again?
He whispers to the man afield
Like a butterfly without a sound...

Ranger's his name, just a shadow away,
An old man in the corner or young man through the way!
Called ranger through the miles,
Through the shadows of the night,
A whisper in a clouder way of the ways!
Thousand people in the room, lot of laughters in the air,
He waits for someone through the door,
He waits for someone ignores his fate
He knows what's his job today,
He knows he could die this day,
He looks for the knowledge or the truth,
He has no king to die soon...

Ranger's his name, just a shadow away,
An old man in the corner or young man through the way,
Called ranger through the miles,
Through the shadows of the night,
A whisper in a clouder way of the ways!
Running through the taverns
And running through the ways
He's alone once again just another day,
Running though his destiny which a man calls his fate,
He's running for salvation at the end of the pain!
