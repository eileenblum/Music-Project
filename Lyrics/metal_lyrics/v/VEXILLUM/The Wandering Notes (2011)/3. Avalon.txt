Here I am, in the wind in the sand,
Running into the storm
In my eyes once again I recall
What the stranger proclaims!

You will be the man who can save us all.
With your heart you'll be the king.

On their faces, I saw trust, faces signed by hurt,
All the hope was reposed in me
Am I stronger than all?

You will be the man who can save us all.
With your heart you'll be the king

Avalon, place the first stone for the freedom
Avalon, sail away to find your reason
Avalon, place the first stone for the freedom
Avalon, sail away to find your reason

[MOTHER EARTH:]
"All the elements I am, I am the seasons too,
I'm the young, I'm the mother, the old.
I'm the life and the death, who brings light and the dark
Thousand names but I'm always the same"

You will be the man who can save us all.
With your heart you'll be the king

Avalon, place the first stone for the freedom
Avalon, sail away to find your reason
Avalon, place the first stone for the freedom
Avalon, sail away to find your reason

What we yearn for all the life is the suggest of our desire
What you feel is what you need, so look inside and realize...
