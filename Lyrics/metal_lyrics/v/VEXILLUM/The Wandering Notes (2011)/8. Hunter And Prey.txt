I heard a scream, cutting through the night,
A cry of ice, continuous of the curse,
Glittering under the rays of the moon,
Will I sleep tonight? Will I sleep tonight?

I feel the shadows approaching, out of breath, I'm tired
Look for me, need me, hurry up make up your mind!

Are you the prey or the hunter tonight?
Are you the prey or the hunter tonight?

Smell the blood, flowing in the night,
Dreams so sweet, spreading through the air,
Strong desire to sink my lips again,
I won't sleep tonight! I'll no sleep tonight!

I feel your sorrow is growing and your heartbeat fills me
I look for you, I need you, your life in my hands!

Are you the prey or the hunter tonight?
Are you the prey or the hunter tonight?

They are the shadows of agony
When the moon comes up this final hunt begin
They are the shadows of agony
When the sun goes down, the blood will flow
They are the shadows of agony
If you cut my flesh, only shadows will flow
