[originally by Slade]I like black and white
Dreaming in black and white
You like black and white
Run Runaway

See chameleon
Lying there in the sun
All things to everyone
Run Runaway

If you're in the swing
Money ain't everything
If you're in the swing
Run Runaway

See chameleon
Lying there in the sun
All things to everyone
Run Runaway

If you gotta crush
Don't beat about the bush
When I gotta crush
Run Runaway

See chameleon
Lying there in the sun
All things to everyone
Run Runaway

Oh now can't you wait
Love don't come on a plate
Oh now can't you wait
Run Runaway

See the chameleon
Lying there in the sun
All things to everyone
Run Runaway

Run Runaway
Run Runaway
Run Runaway
