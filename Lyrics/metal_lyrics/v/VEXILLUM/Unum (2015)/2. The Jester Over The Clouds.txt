Finally I found the man, he seems too mad...
Pointed shoes and tinkling hat, how could he help?
Like a spell, everyone listens to him
A sharped tongue...
Now attacks the power, now attacks the folks

Tell me what you have to employ
If you want to save it
He can heal the deepest wound but he's just run away

Look the sky and tell me what you see
Shining sun, despite the clouds, you will see
Dark is our time haze in all the minds
Don't forget to look the sky
Over the cloud the sun is bright

Why do you waste your time?
Why don't you give a damn?
Your games are full of lies
Why don't you speak the truth?

I'm waiting for your smile, my blinded friend
Laughing is the last chance we will have
Everybody run! Something to be done
Come on! Help me with these dumbs

Shout, dance, charmed glance
Rising spirit man by man...
What about the Guardian's path?
What about my quest?

Oh maybe fell asleep, or waiting far away
Maybe they will come back once again
The rule is just to love, and do the thing you want
And infecting all their hearts

Over the sky...
New eyes to find...
Beyond imagination...
A simple smile...
To spread the light...
Defend the right...
