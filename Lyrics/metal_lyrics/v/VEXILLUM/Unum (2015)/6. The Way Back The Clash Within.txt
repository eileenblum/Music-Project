Over the mountains
After the climb
Where all the beaten paths blend with the sky
Where knaves are astray
There I will find my way

I always believe that the world I just know
Could be the only, the best place where grow
I could not be mistaken more than this
And now what can I do?
I saw a new opportunity... Following my feet...

I know the truth and with her I'm alone
What does it means, I'm a guardian of what
Do they deserve to see what I can see?
Or they should keep on to sleep?

Try! Keep on try! In the middle of the night
My father words, they were always right!
Fight! Only fight! For the people be the light!
The King should fall, a new era rise!
Die! Maybe Die! On the battlefield you lie
Those who fight, maybe lose their life!
Wise advice, in the middle of the night
I stop to waste my time!

I understand what is my final aim
And I know how to move
I will be a mirror in front of them
To show them what to do!

From a drop a waterfall will come!
No one, will be saved from the voice of my heart!
