Dust in my eyes, dries my mind
Leading me to be blind
Hiding signs stealing time, an invisible crime...
Where is the blame?
Cage! Feel the cage
And we all one by one
'Til the Guardians Come!
We believe what we say, what we make, it's a labyrinth!
We are too busy to see our lives fade away

Blow away the ashes, waiting for clashes
Unmask the master of shadows, revealing the truth
Lighting the darkness, reaching the answer
No way for distractions, just for opportunity
Blow away the ashes, waiting for clashes
Unmask the master of shadows, revealing the truth
Lighting the darkness, reaching the answer
Hunting the shadows of Nothing, the source of the doom

What am I doing all alone?
With a name on the road
For a help, or pretext, that I must come back home
... I will do what I must!

The call! Hear the Call!
Let the Guardians come
I'm a tool in their hands!

All I need is my pack
All I miss is there
Where I cannot live anymore
Now I go, with my goal, rise or fall!! !

Far away from my door
Far away from home
The uphill road goes on and on
Now the way has gone
Fast towards the dawn

Follow it, who did not fall!

Always on my step and never look behind!
There's no meeting with no reason!
Waiting for a sign, from the people, from the sky!
Don't forget your reason!
