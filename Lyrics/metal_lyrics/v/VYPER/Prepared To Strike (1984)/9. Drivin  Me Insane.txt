[Saint/Black/Foxx/Brock/Scott]

Itâs a power over me (over me)
It ainât easy to see (to see)
Crazy women, crazy rules
Give the love to the fools
Hesitation in the night
Sheâs hot to trot â dynamite

Drivinâ, drivinâ me insane
Drivinâ, drivinâ me insane

Slow job, no job, no job
I guess a slow job is better than no job at all

Sheâs a babe moptop
Baracade you canât get your rocks off
Iâm double takinâ when I can
âCause, babe, you know Iâve got to take a stand

Living too fast, got to slow down
This canât last, I wonât be around
Oh, youâve got to slow down, slow down the pace
You better give up, better give up the chase

âCause Iâm a Rock and Roll machine
You know what I mean

Youâre drivinâ, drivinâ me insane
Drivinâ, drivinâ me insane

Slow job, no job, no job
I guess a slow job is better than no job at all

Sheâs a babe moptop
Baracade you canât get your rocks off
Iâm double takinâ when I can
âCause, babe, you know Iâve got to take a stand

Drivinâ, drivinâ me insane
Drivinâ, drivinâ me insane
Drivinâ, drivinâ me insane
Drivinâ, drivinâ me insane
Insane!
