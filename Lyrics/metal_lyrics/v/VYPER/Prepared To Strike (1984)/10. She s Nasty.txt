[Black/Foxx]

She gets me hot
She gets me through the night
When I picked her up she looked just right
Back to her place
I think Iâve got it made
With a sexy smile she draws the shades

I think itâs time to make my move
Dim the lights
Slip out of those high heel shoes

Slip out of those shoes!

Nasty girl
Sheâs a nasty girl
Nasty girl
Sheâs nasty
Nasty girl
Sheâs a nasty girl
Nasty girl
Sheâs nasty

Bring up the food and champagne
A dozen deep red roses set the mood to feel no pain
She said âwhat would you like to do first?â and I couldnât pick
As we burnt the candles down to the quick

I think itâs time to make my move
Dim the lights
Slip out of those high heel shoes

Oh! Sheâs a...

Nasty girl
Sheâs a nasty girl
Nasty girl
Sheâs nasty
Sheâs nasty
Nasty girl
Sheâs a nasty girl
Nasty girl
Sheâs nasty
Sheâs nasty

Nasty girl
Sheâs a nasty girl
Nasty girl
Sheâs nasty
Nasty girl
Sheâs a nasty girl
Nasty girl
Sheâs nasty

Slipping out of the silk dress gets me feelinâ hot
Dancinâ through the room like a woman ought to
Sheâs got one thing in mind
Itâs alright by me
One thing that I find
This girl is free

I think itâs time to make my move
Dim the lights
Slip out of those high heel shoes

Oh! Sheâs a...

Nasty girl
Sheâs a nasty girl
Nasty girl
Sheâs nasty
(Gets me hot!)
Nasty girl
Sheâs a nasty girl
Nasty girl
Sheâs nasty
Sheâs nasty

Nasty girl
Sheâs a nasty girl
Nasty girl
Sheâs a nasty girl
Nasty girl
Sheâs a nasty girl
Nasty girl
Sheâs a nasty girl
