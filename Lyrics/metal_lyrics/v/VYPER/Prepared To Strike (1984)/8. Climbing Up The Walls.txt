[Black/Foxx]

First she was nice
She didnât mind
When I turned my back
She robbed me blind

Drove my new car
Into the lake
What she couldnât have
She takes

Iâve got an appointment with the man
To put you away if I possibly can
Youâre the spittinâ image
Where Iâm from
Of an evil doer

Donât drag me around like Iâm deaf, dumb and blind
Like the speed of sound
Youâll be climbing up the walls
Donât drag me around like Iâm deaf, dumb and blind
Like the speed of sound
Youâll be climbing up the walls

Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls

Black spots in my eyes
From the damage to my mind
Take it with me where I go
For what reason I donât know

Donât drag me around like Iâm deaf, dumb and blind
Like the speed of sound
Youâll be climbing up the walls
Donât drag me around like Iâm deaf, dumb and blind
Like the speed of sound
Youâll be climbing up the walls

Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls

Iâve got an appointment with the man
To put you away if I possibly can
Youâre the spittinâ image
Where Iâm from
Of an evil doer

Donât drag me around like Iâm deaf, dumb and blind
Like the speed of sound
Youâll be climbing up the walls
Donât drag me around like Iâm deaf, dumb and blind
Like the speed of sound
Youâll be climbing up the walls

Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls

Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
(Iâll keep you) climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
