[Saint/Foxx/Black/Brock]

I am the loaded gun thatâs pointed at your head
I am the government equipped with deadly force
Power is my middle name
Prepare for sacrifice
I am the holy man to bring you to your knees

You canât escape me
Iâm everywhere
The deadly hour has come
And you better say your prayers

(âCause Iâm your)
Dealer, (your) dealer, (Iâm your) dealer
(So get) down on your knees
Watching, waiting
(For) dealer
Dominating

We smash the skies with raging sound of steel
We must explode with the power that we feel
Spread the rabid force of chaos through the land
The mighty backline
Unleash its massive roar

You canât escape me
Iâm everywhere
The deadly hour has come
And you better say your prayers

(âCause Iâm your)
Dealer, (your) dealer, (Iâm your) dealer
(So get) down on your knees
Watching, (youâre) waiting
(Waiting or) dealer
(Dealer) dominating

(âCause Iâm your)
Dealer, (Iâm your) dealer, (your) dealer
(So get) down on your knees
Watching, (youâre) waiting
(Waiting for) dealer
(Dealer) dominating

We smash the skies with raging sound of steel
We must explode with the power that we feel
Spread the rabid force of chaos through the land
The mighty backline
Unleash its massive roar

You canât escape me
Iâm everywhere
The deadly hour has come
And you better say your prayers

(âCause Iâm your)
Dealer, (Iâm your) dealer, (your) dealer
(So get) down on your knees
Watching, (youâre) waiting
(Waiting for) dealer
(Dealer) dominating
