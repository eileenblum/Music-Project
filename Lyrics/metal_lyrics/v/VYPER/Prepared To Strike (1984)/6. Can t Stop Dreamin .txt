[Black/Saint/Brock/Foxx]

You think you can stay with me
Why donât you go chase the stars away (at night?)
You think you can stay right by my side
Not if I donât think itâs right

Easy come, easy go
Best you ever had
Too bad you canât stop dreaminâ
âCause you drive me mad

Canât stop dreaminâ
Canât stop dreaminâ
Canât stop dreaminâ
Canât stop dreaminâ

The love and the fun we had is gone
Leave it in the past for good
The pain goes away
But the memory lives on and on and on

Easy come, easy go
Best you ever had
Too bad you canât stop dreaminâ
Because you drive me mad

Canât stop dreaminâ
Canât stop dreaminâ
Canât stop dreaminâ
Canât stop dreaminâ

Dreaminâ
You canât stop dreaminâ

Now Iâm alone again so I see
What you do to guys like me
Now I can run again
No one will ever catch me

Easy come, easy go
Best you ever had
Too bad you canât stop dreaminâ
Because you drive me mad

Canât stop dreaminâ
Canât stop dreaminâ
Canât stop dreaminâ
Canât stop dreaminâ

Canât stop dreaminâ
Canât stop dreaminâ
Canât stop dreaminâ
Canât stop dreaminâ
