[Black/Brock/Foxx]

Girl, youâre in there
I know youâve got to be somewhere
Just donât let me catch you
âCause you might fall
Donât let me see you at all
No!

Iâm not waiting
Iâm not waiting for you
Iâm not waiting
Iâm not waiting for you

Come out, come out
Iâve got a sucker for you
I said it ainât no fun
When you play the game like you do
Just donât let me catch you
âCause you might fall

Iâm not waiting
Iâm not waiting for you
Iâm not waiting
Iâm not waiting for you

Come out, come out
Iâve got a sucker for you
Well, it ainât no fun
When you play the game like you do
Donât let me catch you
âCause you might fall
Donât let me see you at all

You got your fingers dirty
I let you wash it right off
You got your elbows dirty
Thatâs when you know it wonât stop

Youâve got not class, no class
You know thatâs true
I think Iâll pass
Pass on you

(Because)
Iâm not waiting
Iâm not waiting for you
Iâm not waiting
Iâm not waiting for you
(Because)
Iâm not waiting
Iâm not waiting for you
Iâm not waiting
Iâm not waiting for you
