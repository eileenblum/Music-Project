[Black/Saint]

I do what I like
And I like what I do
I get what I want
But I canât get none from you

Take away the diamonds
Take away the star
Social castaway that makes you what you are

Diamonds are a girlâs best friend
Diamonds are a girlâs best friend

Bottoms up now
I canât get through
Most people feel emotion
What happened to you?

Take away the diamonds
Take away the star
Social castaway that makes you what you are

Diamonds are a girlâs best friend
Diamonds are a girlâs best friend
Diamonds are a girlâs best friend
Diamonds are a girlâs best friend

Canât stand the way you left me standinâ in the park
Picked me up, knocked me down
Like a cold hand shot in the dark

Take away the diamonds
Take away the star
Social castaway that makes you what you are

Diamonds are a girlâs best friend
Diamonds are a girlâs best friend
Diamonds are a girlâs best friend
Diamonds are a girlâs best friend

Diamonds are a girlâs best friend
Diamonds are a girlâs best friend
Diamonds are a girlâs best friend
Diamonds are a girlâs best friend
