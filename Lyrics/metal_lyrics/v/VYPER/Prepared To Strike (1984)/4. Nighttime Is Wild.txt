[Black/Saint]

Six oâclock in the morning
(Itâs been) another crazy night
Iâve always listened to my father
He always knew wrong from night

People laugh when Iâm watching
Birds fly in the park
But Iâll make them pay
When the sun goes down and it gets dark

Nighttime is wild
So donât bring your child to the park
Nighttime is wild
So donât bring your child to the park

A long time ago when presidents rules
They wrote the forgotten law
Time has passed and living is cruel
We live by the tooth, nail and claw

Fight to stay alive
Stay alive to fight
Only the strong survive
Weâve got the freedom youâve always wanted
Fun is always make-believe

Nighttime is wild
So donât bring your child to the park
Nighttime is wild
So donât bring your child to the park
Nighttime is wild
So donât bring your child to the park
Nighttime is wild
So donât bring your child to the park

Nighttime is wild
So donât bring your child to the park
Nighttime is wild
So donât bring your child to the park

Remember the stories of laughter and cheer
Remember when living was fair
Desolate times that never unwind
There is foul stench in the air

Forty lashes, burning ashes
Cinders and death to the ground
In the parched dry wasteland Iâll give you a taste, man
A taste of the steel from my world

Nighttime is wild
So donât bring your child to the park
Nighttime is wild
So donât bring your child to the park
Nighttime is wild
So donât bring your child to the park
Nighttime is wild
So donât bring your child to the park
