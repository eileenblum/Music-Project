[Black/Brock/Saint]

Did you ever lose a lover?
Did you ever lose a dream?
Those nights you spent undercover
Were nights you didnât go unseen

You laughed at me
Yes, you laughed at me
Said Iâd never be more than what I am
So Iâm taking a trip to the edge of the sea
To see what I can be

Your heart
Your heart is cold
Cold as a stone
Your heart is cold
Cold as a stone

Weâve been up and down forever
Remember the nights you made me spend alone
Keeping me standing in the coldest weather
I believe you heart is cold as a stone

Your eyes are wild
People love your smile
Youâre the best thing thatâs happened to me
But youâve turned around
Itâs a tragedy to see what I could have been

Your heart
Your heart is cold
Cold as a stone
Your heart is cold
Cold as a stone
Your heart is cold
Cold as a stone
Your heart is cold
Cold as a stone

Your heart is cold
Cold as a stone
Your heart is cold
Cold as a stone

Weâve been up and down forever
Remember the nights you made me spend alone
Keeping me standing in the coldest weather
I believe you heart is cold as a stone

Your eyes are wild
People love your smile
Youâre the best thing thatâs happened to me
But youâve turned around
Itâs a tragedy to see what I could have been

Your heart
Your heart is cold
Cold as a stone
Your heart is cold
Cold as a stone
Your heart is cold
Cold as a stone
Your heart is cold
Cold as a stone
Your heart!
