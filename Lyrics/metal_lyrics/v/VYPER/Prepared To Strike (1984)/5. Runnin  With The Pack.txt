[Black]

High hope, cold feet
Just when I opened the door
Blood stained overcoat
I ainât going back by myself no more

Iâve got a friend or two
Said they would help me when Iâm down
Iâm gonna find them
Iâm gonna move myself to the dark side of town
Dark side of town

Runninâ with the pack
(You are)
Runninâ with the pack
(I am)
Runninâ with the pack
(We are)
Runninâ with the pack!

Burned out, no advances
As a pack we take our chances
We duel like a night on fire
We do as we desire

Weâre the keeper of the night
Donât cross the line
We like to fight
We make the rules, got the tools
Seem to make our way to the next day
The next day

Runninâ with the pack
(You are)
Runninâ with the pack
(I am)
Runninâ with the pack
(We are)
Runninâ with the pack!

Runninâ with the pack
(You are)
Runninâ with the pack
(I am)
Runninâ with the pack
(You know we are)
Runninâ with the pack!
