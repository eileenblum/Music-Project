don't be so scared
of the face staring back at you
as your heart begins to race
I'll be the blood in your veins

don't hold yourself responsible for their disregard
won't you look better when you're alone
through open eyes we'll see right through
all of the lies you hide behind

we'll break down all of the walls
that separate us from the underlying truth

with eyes like knives
they're cutting through your back
we itch like hives for acceptance

as we approach the end
we'll find clarity
in time our wounds will mend
but until that day comes
show us the way

I won't watch my aspirations slip between my fingertips
I'll keep on searching through the dark until the lights are lit

as we approach the end
we'll find clarity
in time our wounds will mend
but until that day comes
show us the way

remove the veil
covering your lying face
