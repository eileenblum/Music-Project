we built our city on a sinking foundation
hoping it would stand the test of time
we are the victims of a flawed operation
but we are pulling through

we are destined to leave this place
and never come back again

all the world will follow us
as we lead them through the dark
those who stand in our way
will surely perish at our feet

leave the ocean behind us
it isn't strong enough to pull us down
and the motion reminds us
of our conviction to survive

I'll make no sacrifice
to save a wasted life
I won't

leave the vagrants behind
they'll fulfill the hunger of the starving dogs

have no pity for the weak
they gave up on the fight

this city is war
we are the ammunition
