years have passed since we looked into the sky
and the stars resembled our waking eyes

miles from the shore
we will carry the waves

we'll breathe beneath the surface
until we find our way

all we know is caving in underneath the pressure
take control before everything catches up to us

we're safe in an unfamiliar place
with our backs to the past
we are infinite
with arms spread like fire
we can burn through anything

sorrow will drown
in the wake we left behind
idols will fall
from the mountains that we climb

searching for something to keep us here
we won't go until we face our fears
losing track of the tide
we'll whisper our final words

all we know is caving in underneath the pressure
take control before everything catches up to us
