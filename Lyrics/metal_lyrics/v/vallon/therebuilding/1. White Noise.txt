our shadows exchanging angles
with every light that we pass beneath
fleeing in fours from their solitary confinement
bound for salvation until the sun comes up again

wandering through your darkest nightmare
I'll be the knife in the back of every
living thing that stands in the way

rise
you are the reason for our demise
and I'll be damned before I let you die painlessly

I am the only afterlife you'll ever know
so kneel before me and beg for mercy

I'll stand and watch you fall
through the eyes that you tried to take away from me
and when you finally cease to exist
my job will be done here

if you would just wake up
we could put an end to this insanity
you are the living dead
I am the afterlife
