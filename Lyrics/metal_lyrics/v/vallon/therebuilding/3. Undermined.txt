your ghost slowly drifts away
in the wake of my alleviation
you are nothing more than a memory
a reminder of what I will never be

and into the sky
we rise above your fate
we harness the lies
and watch their desiccation

patching the holes that were left in our way
we'll keep on looking for the answers

and when your time runs out
your sins will drag you down
all hope is lost
you'll finally pay for all the wrong you have done

this is our hope for the future
we are the ones who will see the end

we will forget your name
you were a bad disease
return from whence you came
crawl back upon your knees

time has run out for you
we reign
