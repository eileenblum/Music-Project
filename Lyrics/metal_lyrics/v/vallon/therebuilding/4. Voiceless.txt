voiceless while standing
face to face with the unknown
fuck your broken hands
I will make it on my own
for eternity I've waited
and I refuse to fade to black

I will fall to my knees
and beg for death
I am not afraid to see
the other side of the light

time is wasting away
while you sit and wither
I reach for better days

hold out your hands
and hope that you are spared
with me by your side
you've got a fighting chance

so this is where we've landed
we are lost in our own reflections
if hope is what you need
just reach inside of me
and I'll lead you on

because when you fall again
I'll still be here to lift you back up
I'll help you clean your hands
of every last regret
