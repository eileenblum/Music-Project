I am surrounded by unfamiliar faces
drowning in an ocean of futility
deliver me from the clutches
of this aimless land

so much for second chances
memory lane is closed
no point in second glances
down the polluted path you're walking

this race of fading shadows
will never drag me to my grave

they will never drag me to my grave
I am eternal

under their eyes
we live as model citizens
while in the darkness
some seek a tainted existence

but now the time has come
to lay to rest this detrimental behavior
we need to rise from the ashes
of this ever-burning disaster

unless we find a cure
to fill these empty heads
this world is doomed
to burn itself alive
