the temperature will rise, the hope within capsized
this light will hypnotize the fear that's in your eyes

I think it's time you set sail, don't stay here you're bound to fail
calm on the outside, but inside I'm about to burst
you're men are about to bail, I'm the hammer you're the nail
you're losing the tide, you're losing the tide

the temperature will rise, the hope within capsized
your only chance is to jump ship before you burn
this light will hypnotize the fear that's in your eyes
you're finally gonna get everything you've earned

I'm drifting down to the coast, in moments you'll be a ghost,
throw out the rulebook, they're meant to be broken today
time to abandon you're post, right now is no time to boast
I've lost control now, I've lost control now

the temperature will rise, the hope within capsized
your only chance is to jump ship before you burn
this light will hypnotize the fear that's in your eyes
you're finally gonna get everything you've earned

you can't run away from this stampede
you can't pull the glass out from your feet
sign your name on the dotted line, you belong

the temperature will rise, the hope within capsized
your only chance is to jump ship before you burn
this light will hypnotize the fear that's in your eyes
you're finally gonna get everything you've earned
