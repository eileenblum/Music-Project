these hands are shaking from regret
these lungs cannot breathe
tonight's the night
tonight's the night I disappear

walk with me out of these shades of gray
we'll find a way to hide our faces
I've been lost inside this town all day
we'll lose ourselves in different places

this road is longer than we thought
so dark we cannot see
but still, we'll find a way to
we'll find a way to survive

walk with me out of these shades of gray
we'll find a way to hide our faces
I've been lost inside this town all day
we'll lose ourselves in different places

we don't know where we are

walk with me out of these shades of gray
we'll find a way to hide our faces
I've been lost inside this town all day

our time is right now
we can't let it go to waste
I will run forever, run forever
run with me
