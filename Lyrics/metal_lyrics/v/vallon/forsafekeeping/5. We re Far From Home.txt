we've been searching for shelter inside this empty town
for as long as our legs have inhabited the grounds
we've been, searching, we've been, searching

oh, we're far from home

this can't be, this can't be, how this ends, how this ends
can't you see, this is how it ends, can't you see, this is how it ends

I can see that you're holding on with everything that you've got left
I can see that there's something wrong, you've lost your grip

this can't be, this can't be, how this ends, how this ends

I can see that you're holding on with everything that you've got left
I can see that there's something wrong, you've lost your grip

I can see that you're holding on
I can see that there's something wrong

can't you see, this is how it ends, can't you see, this is how it ends
