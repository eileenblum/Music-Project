take ten steps and kiss this place goodbye
going up against me, there's no chance that you'll survive
in this town you get no second tries
falling to your knees, no you're face up towards the sky

say you can't take it anymore, anymore
and I will show you to the door, to the door

daylight's running out
pain is setting in
say you're final words
you could not be saved tonight
