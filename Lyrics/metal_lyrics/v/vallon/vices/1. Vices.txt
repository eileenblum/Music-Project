I'll bind the hands of time, I'll shed this polluted skin
like a snake with a second chance I'll strike without remorse
look into these eyes of mine, they rarely see a win
the venom running through my teeth will serve as evidence

life is now, and in a world of time every second counts

release your vices, and bid farewell to the person you used to be
this is a new day filled with promise, don't miss your chance

and in a world of time every second counts
we'll climb the highest highs and never come back down

you're sinking through the rotting floor, I'll break your fall
listen close to the whispers
follow the warning signs, stick to the path
we'll find the answer, we'll find our way

everything will fall into place, we've come this far

sell your soul for what its worth

everything will fall into place
we're traveling at a steady pace
