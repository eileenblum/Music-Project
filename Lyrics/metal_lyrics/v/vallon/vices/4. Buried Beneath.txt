keep your eyes on the jet black horizon
don't look away until the moon disappears
there's no time for silence, throw caution to the wind
we were born for this

the questions that plague us as we sleep
are buried directly beneath your feet
dig for the answers

here's to the demons that we'll cast away
here's to the vultures that we led astray

I've got a feeling that this could be
the day that define us
save your breath for the moment
as the water is overflowing

hold on to your innocence, until it holds you back
when all is said and done, only the strong will survive through the night

we're all so capable, and scared to show our colors
we're moving mountains in pairs, through thick and thin

as we approach the summit, there's only one thing on our minds

we're ready for tomorrow, we've conquered today
