Yet, again I bow in fear,
As future beholds and drawing near,
A resurrection of despair.
Behold the path, so gray,
I mourn the years of time decay,
The stars above witnessed the waste of our lives.
Now watch the angels weep,
Now soak the light so deep,
Mankind behold the tenebrosity of your lives.

Destructive tone of thee,
Entrenching your insanity,
I long, for the recreation of a real devotion for the eye to see,
For the sacred soul to be,
For the heart to kneel, in solemnity.

Corrupted fate dominates the way as emerges from below,
Where abandoned souls used and controlled as to serve inadequate laws,
This vague trust, buried in the dust and rendered so unsure,
Paradoxical change rust the minds and the hearts now feel secured.

I see souls wrapped in denial
Of self-centered acquisition
Indulged in fake joy that you see as real

Blind hearts soiled in delusion
The more you live on momentarily motives
The sooner you die in ignorance you rooted
Forevermore.

Oh my god, please forgive me, I need another chance.

Moan, weep, forever doomed to reap the eternal pain, carved in so deep.
The price for self-deception is to be paid by you, back to you!

Blind hearts soiled in delusion
The more you live on momentarily motives
The sooner you die in ignorance you rooted
Forevermore.

The wheels of life rolls on the way,
The truth remarks your judgment day,
I never found my way, for grace I shall pray.
