For ages mankind has been wounded by thoughts..
Emerged from the legacies disguised as the absolute..
Truth planting its seeds from the moment of conception
Into abysmal decay is the shrine of its fiction.

Ancient commandments encumbered disruption of humanity.
Self corrupted guidance shall lead the way to vanity.

We held the shield for long and never will yield.
Our war won't end until the world is healed.
If death is the price, a real honour to feel
Our words will help the truth to be revealed.

I call unto thee.
Scorch this physical shape of knavery
Only the you shall forever see
The blood hungry beast that is reality

In fathomless fear we hid the curse
In torment for our remorse
Though jagged swords are on the coarse
To unleash a mighty demonic force

"We chose no to hold the secret and in oblivion we sought our peace.
It summoned us, gathered us and forced us under the spell of veritatem solam."

Fear no regret as the tale is told
Before the masses to behold
Bewildered or denying, the day will come
For thee to reap the evil you ignored

We aim to regulate the structure of thoughts
Eradicate the misconception dwells withing the wars we fought.
It's time to spill the fermented hatred legacy.
This throne of illusion will cease to be as it was when we were once free.
