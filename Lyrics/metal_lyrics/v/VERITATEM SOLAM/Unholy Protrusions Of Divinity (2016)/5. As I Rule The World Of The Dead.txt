Hear the roar of whispers of sanity,
Seeking, unbelieving the justice of creation,
Fearing the power of the divine God,
Bleeding, screaming souls, mourning their existence.

Human, I made the world for you to see,
Human, just close your eyes, have faith in me

Why don't you believe in me?!

I am the one, justice is done, don't cross the line, don't break the law!
You've came to world informed and told all what you need to get through!
Don't ask for more, learn to ignore what human soul don't need to know!
Your sacred lies, divine disguise, my hell beholds, what the fuck to do?

Human, I made the world for you to see,
Human, just close your eyes, have faith in me!

As I rule the world of the dead,
You'll be eaten by your sins and my damnation,
The nature of my power states that soon you die,
And I state the justice among my own creation!
