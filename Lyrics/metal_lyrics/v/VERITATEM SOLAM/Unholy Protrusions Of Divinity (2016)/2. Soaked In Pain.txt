As time has stopped for thee to be
Encaged in void, in misery
Eternal hell opens the gates
Summoning thy darkness to dig within

Restless devotion to inequity
Eyes are concealed to eternity
You mourn the loss of sanity
Indulged in fear and agony

Behold the hate that killed your dreams
Feasted upon your mere dead screams
Insanity now is your pain
Disables you to keep your gain

Soaked in pain

Why am I in decay, I worship, I pray

Misanthropy and blasphemy
Are now conceived in the heart of thee
Indulge in plague "it shall devour thee"
Deep under your skin "burning the remains sanity"

Devotion to inequity
A craving for mortality
Eyes are concealed
A fiction of reality

Like winter shrouds darkness awaits
For rambling souls to take its bait
Fear not and wield the sword of light
For it kills the pain darkness creates

And Hell awaits
Soaked in pain

Restless devotion to inequity
Eyes are concealed to eternity
You mourn the loss of sanity
Indulged in fear and agony
Why am I in decay, I worship, I pray
