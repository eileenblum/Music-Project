Beholding the holy of me,
No compassion or sympathy.
Am the gardener of the truth,
You have lost your pride and dignity.
Entangled with the threads of story lines.
I never thought I will

Cast out the forsaken hope
Into the cold death of soul where fear beholds.
I've lost my drive,
I've lost my pride,
I've lost my faith,
Am lost and dwelled into those sins that I convict,
Those morals I contradict,
Within my inner conflict,
I lost control, I lost control.
I die and I tend to justify
The bewildered dust of shameful lust
Disguise the truth. Ignore, corrupt.
The divine within enslaved to sin
The unholy form rendered to win.

Fetter the hands of self-slavery
And greet demise and greet immortal agony
Unfold the cure, restore sanity
Ignore no more what lead to this catastrophe.
Forgive my soul that judged them all
Acute remorse now takes control
Ignite my doubts, stuff more to crave
Invite the crowds to dance upon my grave!
