Take a single moment of solidarity far from reality
Free your essence of vitality
Observe the illusion fades away, what you saw once clear now is stained
It's a mass delusion that forced an act of

Rejection of every fact that aims to burn the deception
Enforced on thee to create this misconception
Of differentiating
The truth from the lies

Reflections of reality is piercing the walls of this
Fiction, when the heart of thine perceive
The contradiction, ye shall see the truth unravel before your eyes.

Influenced by dark indoctrination so obscure
Mass awareness was consumed
As words unfold the truth, the preset minds ignore.
Then call for true annihilation war fueled with

Hatred, subliminally incepted
The deceit evolves to bloodshed
Revelation of this mind infiltration is once again neglected

Wail for those who were dragged in this gale
Feeble marionettes for a master so frail
Damned is the one who wept on dismay
And still accepting being a prey

Break free
From the bars you cannot see
Unplug your mind from the fiction machine, descry the real epidemy

Take a single moment of solidarity to behold the ferocity
Of the sick born children of this infamy
The infected womb is soon to give birth to a new disease
To keep the race under control and enforce an eternal act of

Rejection of every fact that aims to burn the deception
Enforced on thee to create this misconception of differentiating
The truth from the lies

Reflections of reality is piercing the walls of this
Fiction, when the heart of thine perceive
The contradiction, ye shall see the truth unravel before your eyes.
