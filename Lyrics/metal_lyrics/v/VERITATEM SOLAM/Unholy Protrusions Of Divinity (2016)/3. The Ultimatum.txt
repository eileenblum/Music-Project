Stand alone in the crowd,
Scream the oblivious truth,
Confront repulsion, slay the doubts,
Extendable is the path of grace,

Walk with me through the sacred gates,
Am nothing but a messenger sent to state
The words of wisdom, and enlightenment,
Your heart yearns to redeem and liberate,
Yet, they illude their own forsake,
Yet, they forge and manipulate,
Yet, they discard my gifted guidance,
Yet, I never unleashed my hate,

I am your pain, your eternal hell,
I am your prayers left unspelled,
I smashed your shameful sphere of sin,
In which you bewildered pagans in shame!

Denial kept you from liberation,
In the crimson jail you tailored,
Burning your regretful soul,
You can't resist, you forgot your savior!

The ultimatum!

I'll isolate your sky with an endless shade,
Your hopeless thoughts will never be prayed,
Recall and grief but never relieved,
As for my sake they'll forever bleed,
I now convict their cunning deeds,
Man-made gods, force-fed creeds,
Forever I shall witness their destruction,
Obtain my vengeance cold and sweet!
