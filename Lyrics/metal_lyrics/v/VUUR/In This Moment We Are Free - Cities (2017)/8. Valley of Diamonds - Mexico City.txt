Drowning, your cry for help has dimmed
Your hands reach out
Falling, though not all this is grim
Your hands reach out

For the truth to start anew
Belated growth eternal youth
One million stars will find you here
To take you home to dry your tears

Rest now, soften your bright eyes

Valley of diamonds
Your brightness radiates your love
Valley of diamonds
Your peaceful soul is all you need to heal

My heart beats for you
In this moment we are free

Listen
I will harbor your undying love
Listen
I will cherish and never fail you

One million stars will find you here
To take you home to dry tour tears

Rest now, soften your bright eyes

Valley of diamonds
Your brightness radiates your love
Valley of diamonds
Your peaceful soul is all you need to heal
