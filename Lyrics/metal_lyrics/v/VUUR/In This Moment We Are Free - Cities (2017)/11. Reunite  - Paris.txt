Veiled is the light, clear is the darkness
No guidance in sight
We will fall unless

I build an aerial fortress and I will watch over you
Never you doubt for a moment
Your noble heart tells the truth
For in this world I believe

Will we ever leave our journey
Will we ever stay united
The universal truth is to love fearlessly

I build an aerial fortress and I will watch over you
Never you doubt for a moment
Your noble heart tells the truth
For in this moment we are free

Will we ever leave our journey
Will we ever stay united

Reunite!

I will watch over you

Reunite!
