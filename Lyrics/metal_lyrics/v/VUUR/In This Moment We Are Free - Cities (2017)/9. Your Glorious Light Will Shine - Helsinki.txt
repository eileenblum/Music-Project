Drown your eyes in sorrowed tears
And fall onto your knees in silent fear
You wonder where you are
Help you out is all I wanted
Help me out is all I need to hear

Though in every layer of your soul
You can feel the bright wind blow
Waiting for your soul to tell me what you really need

The only man you never wanna be
The only hero that you'll ever be
Emerges when you grow
See me standing for I promise
From this moment on we'll always be free

I see angels near
They will guide you in this life

You're breaking free
Are you strong enough to make it
Will you believe these shackles will not hold you down
They'll never own you
Your power lies within
Your glorious light will shine

Will you mend the pieces of your broken heart
And walk away with your head high
Help you out is all ever wanted
If you just believe in me

Your desire to rely on your own energy
Will heal your self esteem
Hoping for your soul to tell me how you really feel

I see angels near
They will guide you in this life
Listen closely to my voice and we will set you free

You're breaking free
Are you strong enough to make it
Will you believe these shackles will not hold you down
They'll never own you
Your power lies within
Your glorious light will shine
