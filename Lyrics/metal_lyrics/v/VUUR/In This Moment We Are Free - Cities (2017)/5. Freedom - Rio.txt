You felt the light a brightness yearning
You didn't realize the weight of it
The world needs your wandering eyes
Your graceful being
Your peerless magical truth embraced me

You're on the wings of faith
On the trail of energy
Ride with me

Freedom
Sharpen your senses don't shy away from this
Freedom
Don't be relentless don't hide away

Open your eyes
Open your eyes now
Open your heart
We're all born selfless

You look beyond oceans of silence
Never superior to the depths of the sea
The frail of heart will find their balance
Create the powerful wonder
We so fiercely need

Freedom
Sharpen your senses don't shy away from this
Freedom
Don't be relentless don't hide away

Open your eyes

In this moment we are free
In this moment we are free to choose
In this moment we are free
In this moment we are free to be
In this moment we are free
In this moment we are free to choose

Hold on and leave me breathless
You will find a way for I won't leave your side
Hold on it's overwhelming
You will find in me a deeper pride

Freedom
Sharpen your senses don't shy away from this
Freedom
Don't be relentless don't hide away

Open your eyes
Open your eyes now
Open your heart
We're all born selfless
