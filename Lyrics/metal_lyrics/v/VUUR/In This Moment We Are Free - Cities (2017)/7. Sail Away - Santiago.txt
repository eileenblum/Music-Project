Turning water into wine
You walk on water your light shines
I know when the moon and stars align
The force in you grows stronger

Sail away I'll watch you from afar
Sail away I'll crumble, their, hunger, wonder when you
Sail away and I will always follow your trail I pray
I'll find you, love you, hope to somehow lad you home

Like two shadows in the night
We crashed and burned alive
And our echoes will collide
You gave me power to survive

Whispering sleep

Sail away I'll watch you from afar
Sail away I'll crumble, their, hunger, wonder when you
Sail away and I will always follow your trail I pray
I'll find you, love you, hope to somehow lad you home

Trust in me for in this moment we are free

Sail away I'll watch you from afar
Sail away I'll crumble, their, hunger, wonder when you
Sail away and I will always follow your trail I pray
I'll find you, love you, hope to somehow lad you home
