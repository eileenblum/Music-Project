I'll snatch you in your dreams
I'll drain your memories
They say our days are done
They say we know that we're lost

Poisonous clouds we drown in dust
Dangerous hope will wipe us all away

I'll watch you when you sleep
I'll snatch you in your dreams
They say the damage is done
They say we lost what we found

Days and days go by
I see a sparkle in each sunrise
Years and years go by
I see devotion in this turmoil

Poisonous clouds we drown in dust
Dangerous hope will wipe us all away

In this moment we are truly free
Halo

Days and days go by
I see a sparkle in each sunrise
Years and years go by
I see devotion in this turmoil

Poisonous clouds we drown in dust
Dangerous hope will wipe us away
