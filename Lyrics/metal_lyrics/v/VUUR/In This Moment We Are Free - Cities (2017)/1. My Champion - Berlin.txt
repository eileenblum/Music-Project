My hands are tied, my voice is still
My body wants to move
My eyes see beauty, I cannot reach it
Paradise lies here
Here in this aging heart of mine

I hunger to be seen, Iâm right here
My champion, enlightened soul
Unchain the burden of all that Iâve become
My hero, I have lost so much
My angel, call my name

Fighting demons
Torn between my love for darkness and the light
I seem to see the beauty
Guide me, lead me, shine for me

I hunger to be seen, Iâm right here
My champion, enlightened soul
Unchain the burden of all that Iâve become
My hero, I have lost so much
My angel, call my name

Right here Iâm safe in my mind I am free
Right here Iâm safe in this moment I am free
Iâll conquer this fear
Iâll rise

My champion, enlightened soul
Unchain the burden of all that Iâve become
My hero, I have lost so much
My angel, hear me

Darkness wears a white dress and wings of glass
