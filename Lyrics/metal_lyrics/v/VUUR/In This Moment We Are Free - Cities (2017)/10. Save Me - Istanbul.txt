Drown my heart, take it down
Underneath the surface
Where I can see it shine the glistening kind
Will one day somehow turn you blind
And love will solve this

Warrior defeat my rival
Soldier I need to survive

Lord, guide me over mountains through the sea
My warrior, make me whole
Unleash the power buried in me and be mine
Save me

Drown my heart, melt it down
Make me yours
Iâll never rest until you wake me and take me in
In this moment we are free

Warrior defeat my rival
Soldier I need to survive

Lord, guide me over mountains through the sea
My warrior, make me whole
Unleash the power buried in me and be mine
Save me

Iâll pay the price, Iâll sacrifice
For one last moment
Save me
Iâll hunt each night throughout my life
For one last moment
Save me
