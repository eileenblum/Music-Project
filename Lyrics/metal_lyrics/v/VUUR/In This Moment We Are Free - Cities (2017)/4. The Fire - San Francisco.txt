And all is calm, and all is quiet
A candle sparkling in the night
A motherâs silky lullaby
It stills her babyâs subtle cry

Nobody will ever know a greater burden
Shifting life from side to side
Thereâs no denying now the tide is turning

The wailing sound of misery
Weâre thrown around in blind debris
Weâre spinning in slow motion
Hoping for a miracle

Nobody will ever know a greater burden
Shifting life from side to side
Thereâs no denying now the tide is turning

The fire, tremendous
The monumental damage
The fire, horrendous
Nothing but desolate ground

Even though our days lie in ruins
In this moment of nothingness, weâre free

Feel me

The fire, tremendous
The monumental damage
The fire, horrendous
Nothing but desolate ground
