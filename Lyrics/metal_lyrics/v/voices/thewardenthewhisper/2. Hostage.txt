As I peel my face up off the floor
Another wasted chance
Another failed attempt
(Where did I go wrong?)

I've been corrupted
By the things that I've held close
They say that nothing can last forever

I fell apart again
These empty graves are haunting me
At last, I can see them
The ones that won't die
At last, I can feel them
Feeding on my lies
Feeding on my lies

Don't you love the way
I always lose my mind?
Can't you hear them saying
Stay away, just stay away?

This premonition will not be mistaken
For lonely eyes, I'm holding on tight
I fell a victim at no surprise
I'm sinking into bleeding lungs
(Sinking into bleeding lungs)

I tried to be the savior of myself
But I fell victim to all the rest
The mirror shatters before me
And I can't see what I'm becoming
Fuck... what I'm becoming

I can't decide if I should die
It doesn't matter
This isn't a test of time
So don't let me in
The Devil's holding me hostage
The Devil's holding me hostage
So don't let me in
