I've run away from my reality
Everyday It gets further away
My life is a hypocrisy
This is a relapse
This is my relapse

You left my body
Cold and ashamed
For every one to see
And no one to blame

What can we find
If we look into all of the hearts of the sane
And these walls, they reflect
All of the truths that are hidden
That we can never explain

Pray for yourself
When I am here
You could never be a
Victim of your own mistakes
Now show them your face

[Chorus:]
We all have demons
But mine are so alive
(My demons are so alive)
I've got a soul they've got a plan
To take all that I've got inside
They'll take it all away

I need you here with me
On these dark days
(These dark days)
You bring me to my knees
I'm nothing more than aching bones
You left me alone

You left me alone
I stand with my shadow beside me
I have no mercy
For anyone who tries to take my
My self control away
But you can try
I've got a remedy for your mind

When I call your name
You come crawling back to me
When you hear me say
Your fucking name
You come for me

[Chorus:]
We all have demons
But mine are so alive
(My demons are so alive)
I've got a soul they've got a plan
To take all that I've got inside
They'll take it all away

I need you here with me
On these dark days
(These dark days)
You bring me to my knees
I'm nothing more than aching bones
You left me alone

(You left me alone)
You left me alone
