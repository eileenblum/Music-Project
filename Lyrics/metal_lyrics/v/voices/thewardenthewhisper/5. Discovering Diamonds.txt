I shutter slowly as I watch you slowly die
But as I look at the floor
The question still remains
Was it always me?

I've been sinking for far too long
But now you're gone
You lift me up again just to let me down

Pardon me
I've got a sickness
Stay away from me because I'd rather die

I've got nothing left to give
To somebody who has lived
Through the lies and the filth that you have

Say what you will
You never will
You're fucking dead inside
I left you with what you left me with
Remember I will always get what I want

I had tried to show you everything
When everything was broken

You thought you had me
From the start
But you'll never learn
Chasing you was never worth my time
I'm fine, trust me

Looking back
I finally see where I went wrong
All of the wasted years
The wasted minds
This all could have been avoided

Time has repaired me
Am I even worthy?

I'm holding on still
Just a little further
Life is in my sights
So don't you dare give up now

[6x:]
I've been broken
I've been mended
