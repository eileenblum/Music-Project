Dragging myself through this hollow room
I'm scratching at the floors
My hands have turned to stone
Don't you think I've tried to escape?
These hands won't let me go

Behind this flesh there is no soul
I lost my way so I
Embrace just how I'm living

[Chorus:]
Let's live our lives so damn well
So that when Death comes for us
It will tremble
We're so far away from where we want to be
(Want to be)
I'm afraid I've become one of them
How can this be?

How can this be?
I can't breathe with all of these
Chains around me
(Chains around me)
I have been consumed
By these whispers

The floor is coming undone now
The boards have shackled me to the bed
Where has my reaper gone?

He starved me of my own restitution
All of this time
I owe him nothing
He owes me something

[Chorus:]
Let's live our lives so damn well
So that when Death comes for us
It will tremble
We're so far away from where we want to be
(Want to be)
I'm afraid I've become one of them
How can this be?

These walls captivate me
Let me live
Help me please
