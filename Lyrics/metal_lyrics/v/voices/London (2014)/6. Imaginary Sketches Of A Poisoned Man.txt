Now I have seen the inside
The ending of my life

The waves of a faded trance
They come emotionless like dreams
Broken dreams

Hypnotic her eyes 

The beauty so defenceless
My jealous disgraced
Her beauty so negative 
My jealousy deprived 
Her jealousy so negative 
My beauty disgraced 

Her beauty so negative 
My jealousy
