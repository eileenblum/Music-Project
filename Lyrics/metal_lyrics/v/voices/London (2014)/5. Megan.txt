I have no pride, I have no shame
Cold and lucid you are my dream
And I can not see my mistake.
I only see you.

fixate on your eye
Its you and its always been you
you breathe life into my illness
I penetrate 

Like a forgotten ancient god
That remains hidden 
Rotten

Diseased at the core
Unleashed set free 

A poet hiding in the shadows 
Of inspiration 
(then I remember)

Dull footfalls from the halls
Step into the cold wet street
