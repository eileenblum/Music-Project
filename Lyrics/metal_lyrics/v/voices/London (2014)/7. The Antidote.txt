Daring off the road 
To go where no-one knows
Fading

She can not speak my name
I'm jealous of the rain 
Falling

The blackness of her stare 
Is poisoning the air
which were breathing

Behind distorted eyes
That which we despise
Loving 

Daring off the road 
To go where no-one knows
Fading

She can not speak my name
I'm jealous of the rain 
When I'm falling

The blackness of her stare 
Is poisoning the air
Which were breathing

Behind distorted eyes
That which we despise

Loving each other to death
Eyes diffused with 
Mercury veins filled with
The impurity of lead
