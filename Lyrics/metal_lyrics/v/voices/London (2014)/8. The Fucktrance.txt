This is the final
Final portrait 
Of the artist
No integrity left
Or forgiveness

Dependant on the value 
She bestows on the ego

The poison reflects 
The ultimate narcissist
When the taste of wine has gone 

Narcissist

We drink dead waters 
When there are no more words left to say
Only aching terrified sobs

Terrified sobs

I still taste you 
On my lips
And on my fingers
The taste of you inside

It was but yesterday we met in dreams
