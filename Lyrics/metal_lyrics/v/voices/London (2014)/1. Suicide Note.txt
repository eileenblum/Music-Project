As I become the sorrow
The funeral of screams
Become the soul of winter
Murderer of dreams
Into her hands she's crying
A  death inside
The the secrets and the shadows
we have to hide

As the sun rises
I fall asleep 
When the sun goes down
Why must we wake up 

When she looks upon you
You'll steal her light 
And in a dream its raining 
Into her eyes
