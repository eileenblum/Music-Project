Tonight rains for us only 
For the sick and the lonely
For the hollow and broken
The firmament tears

Tonight rain falls 
For us only
Forgiving 
Absoluting guilt 
Proviidng a mask 
To disguise 

The depravity we seek 

When she became all that she became
There was nothing left to recognise

The emptiness kills 
So she fucked herself dry
And could no longer try 
To feel anything inside
A black and white still
Of the actress at night 
Captured in monochrome 
For the theatre wall 

The mirror can not reflect 
the beauty she expects

And there is nothing left 
To lose 
Or to gain 
In the end 

When she became all that she became
There was nothing left to recognise

There is no-one left to remember you when I am gone 

[Narration:]
Dead London sighs dense anxiety out of black Westminster lungs full of sickness.
A decomposing clamber that infects his every puddle grazed foot foward, while the population dreams safely asleep...
