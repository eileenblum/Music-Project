Broken hours enter twine 
Before words that can define 
The shape of empty space 
In shadows of nobel grace 

Alter shape to disguise 
Human form that we despise
Sadness we swallow whole
Is grief beyond control

We are the sex people

Fold your arms around the night 
Breathe my dear you're slipping
Fall into the black of night
Tears are falling into the rain
LONDON speaks into the night
Take my hand and slip away

We are the sex people
