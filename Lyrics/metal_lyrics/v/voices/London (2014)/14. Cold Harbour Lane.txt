Imprisoned souls 
Left to walk

Abandoned roads 
In the dark 

In this cold hearted world
Empty and betrayed

Welcome to cold harbour lane

Sometimes its hard to live 
With the choices we have made

By shutting yourself away
Insincere and insane
Something calls your name
Don't disregard the devils game
