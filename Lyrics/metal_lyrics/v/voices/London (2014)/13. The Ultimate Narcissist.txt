There is a sorry for his suffering 
It grips him follows him 

Through the streets of London

For without her 
He is without god

You have to understand
I'm jealous of everything that moves

With obsession he takes her hand

There is a sorrow to his suffering
Through the streets of London

Detached from the banality of men
Who dwell in lesser ideals 
Evoking s sense of her
Forming a diary of hate

You have to understand
I'm jealous of everything that moves

With desire
Encapsulates her

She deceived as much as she loved
But with just her step 
He forgives 

He wanted her for a lifetime 
Left only with his hatred 
No longer does He suffer 
Residing deep within her 
Yet when parted reduced to a nihilist 

With obsession 
He takes her hand

With desire
Encapsulates her
