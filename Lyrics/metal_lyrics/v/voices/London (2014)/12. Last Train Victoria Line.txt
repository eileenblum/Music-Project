I tread the archways 
With violence and death
In my heart

I'm clutching 
The broken flowers 
You destroyed

Did you spread your legs for him
The way you do for me?
Did you gaze into his eyes
The way you gaze at me?

I heard the sirens 
Of the abyss
When you caught my eye

There desolations 
I faced with ease
Untainted bravery

Do you ever think of him 
When you're here with me?
Do you ever picture him 
When you're fucking me?
