Enter the house 
Of dismay 
Perfect pentagram
Painted 
On the ceiling

Light of the candles
Holes in the walls
Holes of terror
Shaping her mind 

I've come to dominate 

The house of black light 
Where visions fade 
And mirrors gleam 
With disgust 

They know my secrets 

This dead house of despair 
I've come to dominate
