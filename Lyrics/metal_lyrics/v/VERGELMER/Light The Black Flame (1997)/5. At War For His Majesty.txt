Creatures of darkness, of hatred
Creatures of wastes and of pain
I summon thee
I conjure thee

I call thee forth from thy abode
From thy resting place in darkness
I evoke thee
From the bowls of the earth

Hear his majesty's word
Raise thy broadsword bravely
Behold, on the horizon
Armageddon

I am the lord of warriors
I am arrayed with both might and sword
I am armed with fierceness
I am before all things

The stars grow dim in their places
And the moon pales before my eyes
A wind has arisen
The dark waters stir

I am the lord of warriors
I am arrayed with both might and sword
I am armed with fierceness
I am before all things

We ascend into darkness
Empower yourself or be enslaved
Behold on the horizon
ARMAGEDDON
