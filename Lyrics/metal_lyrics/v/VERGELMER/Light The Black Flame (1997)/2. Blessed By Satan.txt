glancing over snow-dressed plains, with memories so old
memories of evil deeds and dark winters so cold
Hailing blackened warriors that never feared to die
Spitting in the face of men (who are) living by a lie
The plains lie vast and desolate, domains of evil ground
Barren soil of sunless earth where no goodness can be found
men of god - feel the wrath of a thousand years
Retaliation - in return for acts against our peers

[repeat verse:]

I have been to the future
Arrived from the past
I've seen it all and more thereof
I am infinity - I am eternity
I am omega to the alpha
The beginning of the end

Blessed by Satan's magick touch
