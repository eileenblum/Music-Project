See a hideous figure moving over the snow
A grotesque silhouette, no features just a gloomy glow
Moving with unearthly speed on a black stallion's back
Dressed in armour, weapons at side, ready for attack
For I'm the mighty warrior, the king of evil's reign
Heaven has collapsed, the pearly gates by blood are stained
Building the Satanic Empire, being the prime evil one

I've travelled the plains where cherubs fell dead
And I burned the fields where the angels bred
And I lit the flame of blasphemy's reign
And now the heavens in ruin are laid

I've travelled the woods, Where the light never treads
And I've killed and raped and thereupon fed
I ravaged and pillaged the palace of god
And the heavens were flooded with blood

I am the rider of doom
The one you have been told of
I have come from far below
To mark the downfall of the heavens above

See a hideous figure moving over the snow
A grotesque silhouette, no features just a gloomy glow
Moving with unearthly speed on a black stallion's back
Dressed in armour, weapons at side, ready for attack
For I'm the mighty warrior, the king of evil's reign
Heaven has collapsed, the pearly gates by blood are stained
The thousand years have passed, now we restore our throne
Building the Satanic Empire, being the prime evil one
