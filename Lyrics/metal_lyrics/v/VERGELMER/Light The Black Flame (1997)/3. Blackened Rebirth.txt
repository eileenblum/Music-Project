Once, when my mind was open
My eyes were clouded like a fool's
The grief often pierced my mind
And i wept
Autumn passed and the old trees
Lost their leaves to nakedness
Stark, black trees look evil
in the cold, beautiful winter

Blackened rebirth
no more grief
The helpless with their tiny limbs
Flee before my sword
I maraud the world
No one shell live, none shall stand
they'll rot on my sword

i see - dark visions
by the candlelight
in a circle of fire
i hear - screaming voices
crying out in pain
I saw -  the ritual of blood
Unholy master, you answered my prayers
I praise thee
