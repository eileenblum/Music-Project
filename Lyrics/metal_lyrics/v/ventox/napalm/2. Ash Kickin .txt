[Verse 1:]
devil's dance that's what he's living for
his thirst for blood ain't done for sure
he's looking for you until you're having a fault
then he will catch you and you'll die in his vault

[Chorus:]
ash kickin'
blood runnin'
loud cryin'
that's his life yeah

[Verse 2:]
he's devouring you 'cause he is full of greed
take a look at his fingers they're full of meat
if you want to find him just follow his trace
it's full of blood and so will be your face

[Chorus:]
ash kickin'
blood runnin'
loud cryin'
that's his life yeah

[Verse 3:]
ripping your wounds and swinging his chainsaw
but you'll never hurt him 'cause his skin is damn raw
you shouldn't dare to stand in front of his gun
there's no need to pray 'cause his work will be done

[Chorus:]
ash kickin'
blood runnin'
loud cryin'
that's his life yeah

gun shooting
throat cutting
