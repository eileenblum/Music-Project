[Verse 1:]
you always take venom that hollows you out
that is the reason why i have to shout
i draw your attention to what makes me doubt
it's almost too late but that's what it's about

you fall to your knees and you start to beseech
there's no chance to flee 'cause you are besieged
it always ends different, not as you thought
a little bit surprising but now you'll be taught

[Pre-Chorus:]
money, money, money, money and wealth
for money, money you would betray yourself
money, money, money, money and wealth
for money, money

[Chorus:]
my view differs from all of yours
if i could i would slam all of your doors
so that you can think about what you're living for
while my soul is bleeding and my skin is getting sore

[Verse 2:]
hatred and misery you so far have sowed
but this will be finished 'cause now you are caught
you don't know these issues that you never sought
the result is disaster but now you'll be fought

a deep insight into you will be brought
including the trouble that you all have caused
stop taking off and feel like a hero
all i can see is nothing but zero

[Pre-Chorus:]
money, money, money, money and wealth
for money, money you would betray yourself
money, money, money, money and wealth
for money, money

[Chorus:]
my view differs from all of yours
if i could i would slam all of your doors
so that you can think about what you're living for
while my soul is bleeding and my skin is getting sore
