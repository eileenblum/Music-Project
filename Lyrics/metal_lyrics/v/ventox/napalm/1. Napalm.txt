[Verse 1:]
crawling around and calling for help
we're coming to you to throw you out of your bed
you shouldn't try to run away
'cause when we have found you we'll show you the way

[Chorus:]
Satan is calling, really loud
he wants us to find you, no matter how
we want to lay you down with body and soul
and so we will hound you 'till we have control
Satan is calling, really loud
he wants us to find you, no matter how
and you have no chance to get yourself calm
'cause we'll eat your skin like napalm

[Verse 2:]
you think you're destructive like a bunch of big shells
but you freeze when your fate decides to send you to hell
you're calling your mama to save you from us
but we only want you to do what you must

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
as we can see we have scared you to death
but we'll do nothing more 'cause our goals are reached yet
at the end of all times we'll see us again
until then you will see that you became a good man

[Chorus]

Satan is calling, Satan is calling, ...
