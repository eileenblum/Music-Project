[Verse 1:]
this world we live in is full of dum man
looking for money in and their inner zen
driving big cars, not knowing themselves
at the end they'll fall down off their own big shelves

[Pre-Chorus:]
run,run,run when i call
do,do,do what i say
cry,cry,cry when you fall
die,die,die when i say

[Chorus:]
what? you all will die
why? we won't save you
when? justice strikes back
we will laugh at you

[Verse 2:]
this world we live in is full destroyers
instead of taking care the fight their employers
smashing our home, the planet we live on
but they will understand when hurricanes kill some

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Living in your bubbles filled with joy and piece
if you knew what is outside you'd begin to freeze
you better resign and stay in Platon's cave
'cause when you go out you'll be no longer safe

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Interlude]

you better remain in dumbness for evermore
but this i can tell you, you will die for sure
