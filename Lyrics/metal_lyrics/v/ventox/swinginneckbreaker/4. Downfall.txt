[Verse 1:]
today the music is raped by its lovers
they have no skills and just cope with covers
all you reaching for is making some money
but when you have met us it will end being funny

[Chorus:]
go back to where you have come from
else we have to bring down the sun
so that you will die with torture
thats what i'll have better told ya

[Verse 2:]
for your little singing you're getting a big check
but when you're on stage we only hear playback
we cannot wait to see you dying
'cause then for us the sun will be shining

[Chorus:]
go back to where you have come from
else we have to bring down the sun
so that you will die with torture
thats what i'll have better told ya

[Interlude]

run, if you want to live on
fight, if you're having a fall
kill yourself, if you want to escape
die,'cause we chose your fate
