[Verse 1:]
torture and pain, is all i feel
always the same, come, hear my squeal
anger and hate, all left to me
unchanging fate, i try to flee

[Chorus:]
i keep asking me what you want from me, see always
when you look at me, then you'll never see, you're left i'm
right here waiting for you and pulling you through your downfall
keep approaching me, this fall is for free, no way out

[Verse 2:]
give me a chance, i prove you that
one bitter end ain't what you get
feel my tension, laid up on you
love attention, black turns to blue

[Chorus:]
i keep asking me what you want from me, see always
when you look at me, then you'll never see, you're left i'm
right here waiting for you and pulling you through your downfall
keep approaching me, this fall is for free, no way out

[Interlude]

welcome, step in, take a seat
have fun, don't mind if i bleed
this all is meant for me
hiding what you can't see

[Verse 3:]
out of my head('s) what you deserve
don't see my worth, on knees i serve
all frustration, the prey i hunt
my damnation, you're all i want

[Chorus:]
i keep asking me what you want from me, see always
when you look at me, then you'll never see, you're left i'm
right here waiting for you and pulling you through your downfall
keep approaching me, this fall is for free, no way out
