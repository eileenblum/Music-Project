[Verse 1:]
people complain about it's noisy and loud
no wonder what they here is our death bringing sound
what the hell they scream after hearing some tones
to the police they go and pick up their tones

[Chorus:]
you like our music as much as rain
come and try some riffs then join our game
what we try to reach is make you feeling the same
so leave yourself behind and enjoy our gain

[Verse 2:]
it's never a good idea with us to play
'cause then we'll kick your ass like cassius clay
they try to destroy us by throawing some bombs
but they will be crumbled by our hammering toms

[Chorus:]
you like our music as much as rain
come and try some riffs then join our game
what we try to reach is make you feeling the same
so leave yourself behind and enjoy our gain

[Interlude]

die please as quick, as you can, as you can, please

[Verse 3:]
as the story ends we don't know what you want
if you cannot feel us go listen to Blunt
our deep impression will follow you home
for the rest of your life in your head it will roam

[Chorus:]
you like our music as much as rain
come and try some riffs then join our game
what we try to reach is make you feeling the same
so leave yourself behind and enjoy our gain
