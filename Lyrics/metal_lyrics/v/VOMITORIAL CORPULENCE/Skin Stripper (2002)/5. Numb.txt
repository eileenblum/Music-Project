Given a chance to set things right. Shown the way to yhe light Ignoring God is your downfall. As Satan suckers you in Using
you like a puppet. You are a slave to Sin. No life in your body. A lost sence of spirituality Separation from God has rotted
your brain There's nothing left for you, to numb the eternal pain But turn to Christ, and you will live Take heed of Gods
word, Bare witness for Jesus Eternal life is buried within,For those who are good in heart.
