You arewith me or you are against me Keep my commands and abide in my love Submit to God, Resist the Devil Put on Jesus'
yoke. If your hand makes you sin, cit it off Out of the heart comes evil Enter through the narrow gate The broad and wide
path leads to death You are the salt you are the light Abide in my word, walk in love Take up the cross and follow me The
Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak
