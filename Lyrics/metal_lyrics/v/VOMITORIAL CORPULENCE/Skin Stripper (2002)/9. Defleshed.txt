Defleshed, bashed, struck senceless To the point of difigurment Spikes were forced into Jesus's head They defleshed the
flesh off Jesus's back By flogging Him to the point of mutilation Making Him carry His own cross As they whipped Him more
and more Defleshed, the brutal price Defleshed, Jesus paid our price Defleshed, Jesus paid the price All this torture to
save mankind Jesus suffered for you and I Jesus paid the altimate price Jesus paid the price for us.
