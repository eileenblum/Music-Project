Your mind's set on things of the flesh, Chaotic thoughta you need to address Unwanted brain rot clots your head, From all
the garbage you've been fed Unstable is your mind, Corrupt thoughts are all you'll find Mullignant cancer kills your brain,
Festering abscess gives you pain Corrupt thoughta make you insane, You've only got yourself to blame. Cerebral Turbulency!
Don't conform to the pattern of the world But be transformed by the renewing of your mind To be carnally minded is death,
but to be spiritually minded is life Put your mind on things above, Keep your eyes set on God Clean your brain with God's
word!
