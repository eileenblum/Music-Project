Revolution, evolution
All the slime,
On the cross you will die,
To keep the true spirit alive,
In sorrow and hatred,
Putrefaction in the sky
In the fire you will die.
Bring the pagan cycle
To eternal sparks
Degradation of the light
Keep ancient hail alive
Murder the holy swine
Torture with nails
Envenomed with pains.
Rape sisters of mercy
Their songs in womb to die
Feel the true warrior alive
Maniac with burning desire
Rages like unholy fire
Ashes of the enemy
Fly through oblivion
And suffocate the bastards
Who made prostitution of mind
In another time.
