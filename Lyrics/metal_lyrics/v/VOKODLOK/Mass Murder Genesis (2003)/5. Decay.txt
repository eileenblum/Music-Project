Decay is moment of pray,
Decay is moment of pain,
Decay in time to die,
Decay is god's final day,
The fall of god, the fall of times, the fall in agony.
Materialized in flesh and has no remorse,
A face so good, behind diabolical smile.
He's the sin in body of serpent
Spitting on the cross
Desecrate the goodness.
Proud he's the leader of men
That led to Christ's death
Prayers of hatred invade the head
When howling wolves
Acclaim his arrival.
Prince of doom
Bringer of damnation
Breathless bodies
Falling beneath your touch.
Perverted creatures of hell
Dethroned the heaven's purity.
Baptized all unholy souls with blood
From open wound in the skies.
This is the fall of God, the fall of times
This is the fall of God and rotted ideals.
Raise armies from below, invocate
The horny beings of death
With wings that cover the light of day.
In the endless dawn of victory
Show again that strength is one.
Love and mercy is no worth
Only blood from Christian throat,
Armageddon is unleashed
Under the sign of tormenting.
