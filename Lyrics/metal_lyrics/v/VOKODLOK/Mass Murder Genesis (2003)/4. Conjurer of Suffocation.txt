Banished from my tomb,
From the silent darkness,
I came on dirt,
To make the innocent cry!
My scream is a howl
Of mournful hatred!
Mangy grin - savage torment.
When the petrified moon
Arise on the nightly sky,
Like the reaper - starring eyes,
Within them - pits of hell,
Mirror - reflecting temptation.
Haunted by past lives,
I commit murder without sorry,
Stick the claws and teeth,
In the throat of victims,
I feel they're agony roaring.
How nice the look
Drowned in a blood puddle.
Disappearing in the shadows,
I care the curse of immortality,
Trapped in a half-wolf  body.
Instigating and malicious.
