Traveling alone in this
Cosmic and mystic fog
Feeling a strange presence
In front me all darkness.
Master of the universe
I follow your paths
Show me the sense
The meaning of eternal life.
Diabolic creatures,
Floating in shape of shadows,
Leading me to the secret
That has always been there
Beyond mind perception
Inside, deep within, stolen
Only darkness, surrounded me
Only the stars are shining.
A splendid view over the Earth
But new dimensions open
To touch his cold realm
To know the pure essence,
There where only immortals
Feed with knowledge
Somewhere out from this world
In the crimson land.
