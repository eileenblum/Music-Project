My seed swear vengeance
Written with blood from carved flesh
Making rage and evilness
To destroy all merciful kind.
Like a bloody revelation
In a most desirable dream
Soon becoming real (throw away the doubts)
We see the true end
Of Christian mass dementia.
Embraced by unholy strength
The Trinity is broken forever
Resurrection of lust and pride.
The era of infinite wrath
Scum is defeated forever,
Flag of hate, cutting the wind
Pagan touch, venomous presence
Cold spirit, heart of serpent
Slaughter sans mercy (the soft minds)
Bloodbath or new beginning.
Our never ending flame
Bound in chains, free at last
A bow we made and kiss
The healing hand of death
Old order come back, stronger than ever.
