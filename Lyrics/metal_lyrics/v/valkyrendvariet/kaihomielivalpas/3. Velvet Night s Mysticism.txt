By heart my guidance
Not book, not father
Mind painted visual deceptions

Feel fades plans, sword's glow fades gone
Mixed sensations unfelt before
Clearly I've seen, for me their path is mere insanity
We float we dwell in our own reality

Purity, the false light vanquished
And I hear thee
The more you give to me for you are for what I've bled
The more grows my need

I wasn't meant to stand beside any other element
How preciously I feel your embrace
Nothing can better these flames

Velvet night's mysticism
Two lovers and one time scientism
Hearts met once and will forever
As first time every night, to live the livable
The most demanding of requirements, each other
Apart life is insignificant

People talk and look them as crazy persons
While trying to explain their emotions
Finding herself in another fantasy and dream, the reality of two in myth
Without words staring like in trance, hands around yourself

Feeling last night's velvet waves washing over
Velvet flames on, fall in each other's eyes as they came together
The only true intelligence, comprehension, surrender
