"We seek for hands of other in the garden of darkness
Creations of us dwell here, but unable still were the attempts to bring even candlelight here
Paradise of flowers and seduction's shine, forever the lair of utter lightless night?"

Since birth here I've wandered
Someone to explain these tears of lonely pain
I've graved and hungered
I call, I scream for something don't know being existent
The echo such clear yet so distant
"Do I die trying to unveil the mystery of echo for my voice in this Darkness?"

[Two engaged inner melodies]
The aching heart
The pain starts the moment I call for the one
I want to rip it off, yet it won't come apart
I have fought feeling it's bleeding song
I want to give up the struggle, depletes my power to move on...
Amazed I see it opening up
I see you, I see everything enlighten

I see the garden the paradise of dreams and desires
They were but phantoms in utter darkness until all released
To be enjoyed and seen
After, I was to realize how letting go unshackles
She made view clear, I was just filled with fear

They kicked the darkness 'til it bled daylight
Before they didn't believe in love, now it's the stars in black night
"My supposed last day you came and started off my life"
"You're truly something I thought I'd never find"

Asylum... To make the day's pain go away
Apart two hearts suffer an icicle rain
Living to breathe on each other's arms tonight

Slowly put their hands together, fingertips gently touch each other
Ice-cold, so soft
Such sensual bliss, are made for caress
This silky communication, of lips floating under uncontrollable passion's language
"The scent of your skin, your sinful sweetness"
"Velvet skin's paleness, so darkly innocent, my sin incense.."
