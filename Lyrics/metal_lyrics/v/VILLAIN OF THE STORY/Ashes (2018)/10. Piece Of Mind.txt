In the shade again
I've fallen right into the masquerade again
Can't for the life of me remember when
I got lost somewhere between now and then

I had a vision for something more
A fire inside me and I felt it to the core
So much of the world I wanted to explore
But I never made it five feet from my door

I'm done wasting away
No excuses, there is nothing left to say
Finding a spark deep down in the dark
It's far from easy but I needed a brand new start

This is the only way that I will find
Something near to happiness in this life
I can't remember the last time
That I had any peace of mind

I've fought for this, I've bled for this
There is no turning back now
And finally, I'm able to see
The place I'm meant to be

I was fixated on the expectations
Of everyone around me, I was so frustrated
I became addicted to always overthinking
Everything I did, I had nothing to give

I started disappointing everyone
Always letting down the ones that I love
This road is covered in ice and paved with sacrifice
I gave it all away and I paid the price

This is the only way that I will find
Something near to happiness in this life
I can't remember the last time
That I had any peace of mind

I've fought for this, I've bled for this
There is no turning back now
And finally, I'm able to see
The place I'm meant to be

I'm done wasting away
I'm done wasting away

This is the only way that I will find (I will find)
Something near to happiness in this life
I can't remember the last time
That I had any peace of mind (peace of mind)

I've fought for this, I've bled for this
There is no turning back now (turning back now)
And finally, I'm able to see
The place I'm meant to be (meant to be)

I'm done wasting away
