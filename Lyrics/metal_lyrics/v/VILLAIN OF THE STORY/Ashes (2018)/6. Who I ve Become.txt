The days go on and on and I barely blink an eye (blink an eye)
I have done plenty wrong, all without a clear state of mind
Somewhere along the way, I lost myself
Trying to clear my mind, why can't be like everyone else?

I'm forcing down all the hate
That I have against who I've turned into
Please just give it to me straight
Because I need to hear

The truth about what's wrong with me
So hopefully, one day I'll change all of the things I cannot see

I feel I'm living a lie
The ghosts of my past feel so alive

I can't believe that this is who I've become
I've been reflecting on the things I did and should have done
My stubbornness and arrogance have left me feeling sore
I'm a mess and I can't take it anymore

I feel the guilt
I feel the shame inside of me

I used to spend so many nights
Just staring at the empty sky
Hoping that the universe
Would take over and set things right

How could I have felt so justified?
Is there still time to make it right?

I can't believe that this is who I've become
I've been reflecting on the things I did and should have done
My stubbornness and arrogance have left me feeling sore
I'm a mess and I can't take it anymore

Forgive me, I'm begging you
Forgive me, I'm begging you

Forgive me, I'm begging you
(I used to spend so many nights)
Forgive me, I'm begging you
(Just staring at the empty sky)
Forgive me, I'm begging you
(I used to spend so many nights)
Forgive me, I'm begging you
(Just staring at the empty sky)
