You wanna point the blame for all your suffering
But do you really think your hands are clean
You wanna criticize the broken part of me
But do you think that it'll ease your pain

Destruction inside
What's left is fading away
Deception and lies
I know you're going insane

Now I don't know where you went wrong
But it's clear that you're too far gone
You've been fighting on the wrong side
If you'd only open your eyes you'll find
There's no way out for you now that you're too far gone
(Too far gone)

Don't try to drag me with you into the flames
I'm not another you can take for granted
So stop acting like you have an advantage
Don't wanna hear you running your mouth
You're so loud always talking all about yourself
And how it's been so hard being the victim
When it comes to attention you've got an addiction

You're just another disgrace
You'll never be the same

Now I don't know where you went wrong
But it's clear that you're too far gone
You've been fighting on the wrong side
If you'd only open your eyes you'll find
There's no way out for you now that you're too far gone
(Too far gone)

I've tried to keep this inside
But you can't be saved

I can't believe that this is what you've become
Why can't you see the pain that can't be undone

(Now I don't know where you went wrong)
(But it's clear that you're too far gone)

Now I don't know where you went wrong
But it's clear that you're too far gone
You've been fighting on the wrong side
If you'd only open your eyes you'll find
There's no way out for you now that you're too far gone
(Too far gone)
