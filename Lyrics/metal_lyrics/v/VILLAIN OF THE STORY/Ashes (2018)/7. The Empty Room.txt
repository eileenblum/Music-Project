I never knew the meaning of loneliness
But now I'm here in this empty room, soaking in silence
I've always had someone to fall upon
But now there's nothing, no reason to carry on

Save me
I'm fading away
Save me
I'm far from okay
I want to be okay

They see me sinking and look the other way
I wonder if they'd notice if I took my life today
They'd get on their soapbox with touching words to say
Talk about depression and how it took their friend away

Save me
I'm fading away
Save me
I'm far from okay
I want to be okay

Where did they go?
Why did they all just leave me here
Like I was nothing?
Like I never existed?

I had no value in their eyes
A useless object they despise
They despise

Save me
I'm fading away (I'm fading away)
Save me
I'm far from okay
I want to be okay
