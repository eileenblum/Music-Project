A life laid out in front of me
With my hands tied behind my back
I've lost control of the wheel
My visions turned to black

Predetermination of what I'm meant to be
Your manipulation has taken over me
Nothing but a puppet that's hanging from your string
But now my eyes are open and I am breaking free

I need to stop lying to myself
Because it's got me feeling overwhelmed
I won't fit inside these shoes you made for me
I've got nothing to lose, so please set me free

The picture perfect mask you hide behind
This role that you've been playing for the longest time
It took awhile but now I see
All the vile shit inside your mind (inside your mind)

You've had your grip on me for far too long
Thought you had pure intentions but I was dead wrong
The day I forget my passion is the day I won't know who I am
Now I regret every second that I spent with you

So I need to stop lying to myself
Because it's got me feeling overwhelmed
I won't fit inside these shoes you made for me
I've got nothing to lose, so please set me free

(I'll never walk down the road you paved)
You won't dig my grave

I need to stop lying to myself
Because it's got me feeling overwhelmed
I won't fit inside these shoes you made for me
I've got nothing to lose, so please set me free

(Set me free)
I've got nothing to lose, so please set me free
