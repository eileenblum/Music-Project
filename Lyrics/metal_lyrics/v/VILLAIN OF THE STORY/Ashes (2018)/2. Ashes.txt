I get so sick of counting down my time
Drifting further from the surface as I'm buried alive
I lose my mind every time that I close my eyes
The pressure seems too much I don't think that I'll survive

Disease
Infecting every fiber of my body as I scream
A hunger growing stronger from within me
Please
Tell me when I went so blind oh please
Just tell me when and how I lost my sight
Cause nothing I feel seems right

I need to find a way
Out of this hell inside of me
I am the cause of all my self disdain
I'm searching for a way
To escape from this misery in me

I'm always looking for something more but no matter what it's never enough
I feel stuck face down in the ground and there's no one to pick me up
My head is pounding, I get surrounded by the fear of death
And I can't catch my breath

Another day I won't make it through
I start shaking and I don't know what to do
I can't eat or sleep and I can't feel my face
I am no longer a man
I'm just a boy who can't stand to be alone
Don't know how long this will last

I need to find a way
Out of this hell inside of me
I am the cause of all my self disdain
I'm searching for a way
To escape from this misery in me

I'm sick of being scared to die
But I have nowhere left to hide
Nowhere left to hide

I need to find a way
Out of this hell inside of me
I am the cause of all my self disdain (self disdain)
I'm searching for a way
To escape from this misery in me

Disease
Infecting every fiber of my body as I scream
A hunger growing stronger from within me
Please
Tell me when I went so blind oh please
Just tell me when and how I lost my sight
'Cause nothing I feel seems right
