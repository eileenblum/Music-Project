My life feels like a painting unfinished
But the artist died and here I lie just a sliver of an image
I feel that there's a purpose for my spirit
But it's trapped in place stuck in a cage suffering from this sickness
So here I am

My mind feels like a child left alone in the dark
I don't wanna be afraid, be afraid but I'm so afraid
I've walked this road for miles yet I've never felt so far
From what I thought was happiness as I decay and fade away
Fade away

Most days it feels like I'm just going nowhere
A perfect mess progressing less as the end keeps getting closer
The world is shaking my bones are aching
I've slipped deep in a sleep without a sign of waking
So here I am

My mind feels like a child left alone in the dark
I don't wanna be afraid, be afraid but I'm so afraid
I've walked this road for miles yet I've never felt so far
From what I thought was happiness as I decay and fade away
Fade away

Discouraged and out of breath
No courage nothing left
Will I let this be the end
Discouraged and out of breath
No courage nothing left
Will I let this be the end

(My mind feels like a child left alone in the dark)
(I don't wanna be afraid, be afraid)

My mind feels like a child left alone in the dark
I don't wanna be afraid, be afraid but I'm so afraid
I've walked this road for miles yet I've never felt so far
From what I thought was happiness as I decay and fade away
Fade away
