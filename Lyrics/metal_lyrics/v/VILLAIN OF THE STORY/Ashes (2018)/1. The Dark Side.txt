I am an abomination
As unclean and impure as they come
My hate is a strange sensation
Pushing me forward and it makes me strong

You don't have a single desire
I, on the other hand, desire it all
Power, unlimited power

It's time to take what is mine, your reign has come to an end
Back down, back down, you have already lost
I've found a power inside that you could not comprehend
Back down, back down, your entire existence will dissolve

I chose the path that you could never walk, you don't have what it takes
Holding back from your potential was a fatal mistake
Your ancient books tell you of a prophecy
A chosen monarch will bring peace and prosperity

Open your eyes
The chosen one is me

This is not peace

This is the dark side

This is the dark side

Feel the lightning from my finger tips
Feel your mind slipping as fear consumes it

Power, unlimited power

It's time to take what is mine, your reign has come to an end
Back down, back down, you have already lost
I've found a power inside that you could not comprehend
Back down, back down, your existence will dissolve

It's time to take what is mine, your reign has come to an end
Back down, you have already lost
I've found a power inside that you could not comprehend
