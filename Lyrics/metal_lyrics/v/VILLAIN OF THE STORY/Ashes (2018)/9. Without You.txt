I lie awake through these endless nights
I see your face when I close my eyes
Reach out my hand, thinking that you're real
My heart skips a beat but there's nothing to feel

(Come back)
(Come back to me)

I'd give it all away, I would give anything
For another day, another day with you
Just take the pain away, there's not much more I can take
Living another day, another day without you

I still can't believe that you're out of reach
Is this the way that it was meant to be?
With you taken away from me (from me)
Tell me that this is nothing but a dream

(Come back)
(Come back to me)

I'd give it all away, I would give anything
For another day, another day with you
Just take the pain away, there's not much more I can take
Living another day, another day without you

I'd give it all away, I would give anything
For another day, another day with you
Just take the pain away, there's not much more I can take
Living another day, another day without you
