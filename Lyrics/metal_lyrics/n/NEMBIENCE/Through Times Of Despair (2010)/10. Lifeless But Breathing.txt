I wear these scars
Like a crown of thorns
Relics of my
Long dead past remains
No tears are shed
For my misfortune
There's just a black rose
On my grave

[Solo 1/2 â Martin]

Returning thoughts bring a bitter taste
So I hold on to this distress
Years of anguish left me cold
And now the sky comes crashing down

In darkness I see
Everything so much more clear
A hopeless wave lost in endless sea
Trying to reach the shores beyond

[Solo 2/2 - Martin]

Each breath brings me closer to the end
I killed to many words
These nights are paved with terror
Give me strength so I can start dying

In darkness I see
Everything so much more clear
A hopeless wave lost in endless sea
Trying to reach the shores beyond

End this bleeding - cut me open
These waters are poison
Embrace this ember and burn me
I'm lifeless but breathing

End this bleeding - cut me open
These waters are poison
Embrace this ember and burn me
I'm lifeless but breathing
