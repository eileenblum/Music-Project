Day after day we paved the way
To end this
To end this war of words
To escape this hell
The distance between us
Brings forth a great loss
A tragic ending
That leaves us colder than night

So many times I watched you bury us
And I welcome you still with open arms
Every time we bleed something inside dies
So is our life just one more sacrifice?

I will choke on these lies
And throw myself
Into the abyss of deceit
When will we see
That we are nothing but dead?
We move towards
Extinction

There is a plague
That breeds within this realm
It's a matter of time
Before our kingdom collapse
We're holding a heart of glass in our hands
And if this is
What we've become it will surely break

[Solo]

I will choke on these lies
And throw myself
Into the abyss of deceit
When will we see
That we are nothing but dead?
We move towards
Extinction
