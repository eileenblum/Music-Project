In these hard times
Of life and death
Weâre left with false hope
And broken hearts
A new darkened faith
To bury all
That we ever had
Assassination

I wonât let these shades take over
I wonât cry these tears of sorrow
There's nothing left inside me
But one more strife to overcome

We stare into the night
With fingers crossed
Knowing we will
Return to our graves

I won't let these shades take over
I won't cry these tears of sorrow

End this mourning - kill this grief
Resurrection - retribution
End this mourning - kill this grief
Resurrection - retribution

In these hard times
Of life and death
Weâre left with false hope
And broken hearts

Condemned sanity
Undying will to tear
The sickness from within
Our life is sacrificed

[Solo - Martin]

I won't let these shades takeover
I won't cry these tears of sorrow
There's nothing left inside me
But one more strife to overcome
