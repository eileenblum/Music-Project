Armed with rage
We climb the mountain
Of confrontation once again
Only to fail and fall

Rise to the sound
Of the dead awakening
Poisoned leaves
On the trees in your paradise

Into the flames eyes will see
Everything perish
Killing the hope to remain
Turn it to ashes

Years are wasted in the mist
We rush towards the end
Time has come for us
To reap what we have sown

[Solo - Martin, Jose, Martin]

Through the wastelands
Runs the blackest blood
There is no light left
All life cease to exist

Into the flames eyes will see
Everything perish
Killing the hope to remain
Turn it to ashes
Into the flames eyes will see
Everything perish
Killing the hope to remain
Turn it to ashes
