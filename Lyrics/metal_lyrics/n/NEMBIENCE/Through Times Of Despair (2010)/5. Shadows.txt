I'm standing on the edge of this world
Watching the clouds go by
I realise I am alone in the dark
No one will hear my cries

I try to escape reality
And everything between
But just like the grave
It moves on closer to me

The weight of your expectations
Pulls my face into the ground
Leaving these scars that last forever

The rope tightens around my neck
With every breath I take
And now I am left
To die alone in silence

[Solo]

I try to escape reality
And everything between
But just like the grave
It moves on closer to me

I'm still buried beneath this life
I'm still standing in the shades
I am...
