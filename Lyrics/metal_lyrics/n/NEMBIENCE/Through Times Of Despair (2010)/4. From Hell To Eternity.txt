I will turn my back on you tonight
But I wonât look back this time
The mirror's broken - can't you see
That there is nothing left?

The tears on your face burns inside
I bury your picture next to my heart
I should have left you with a broken neck
To show you how much I cared

From hell to eternity
From hell to eternity

[Solo]

Where will you be when the curtain falls?
On your knees praying for salvation
I wish you the best, I wish you death
I will bleed no more for you

I should have left you with a broken neck
To show you how much I cared
YAAA!
