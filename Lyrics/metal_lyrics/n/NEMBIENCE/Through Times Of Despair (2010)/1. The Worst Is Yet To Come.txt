A pale reflection
Stares back at me
I do not recognize that face
Youâre just a ghost
Youâre just a ghost
How could I expect you
To be dead?

My thoughts are suicidal
Alone I break
Iâm turning into fiction
You are my bride

Your eyes will curse me
Once again
Nothing will ever change
You hold my fate
In your hands
I can't escape these arms of sorrow

My thoughts are suicidal
Alone I break
Iâm turning into fiction
You are my bride

Bring me the endless night
And let me sleep forever
I pray I do not dream of you
I need no demon to hold my hand

Bring me the endless night
And let me sleep forever
I pray I do not dream of you
I need no demon to hold my hand

[Solo - Martin]

My thoughts are suicidal
Alone I break
Iâm turning into fiction
You are my bride

Knowing the worst has yet to come
I celebrate with my suffering
Knowing the worst has yet to come
I celebrate with my suffering

I am in pieces
