Mistakes made by mankind
Causing the death of others...
Shall never be forgiven

Yaoh!

Inside I feel
The fires burn
With one thousand suns
Still on this silent night
I have never felt so cold
I have never felt so cold

With this love comes my hatred
With this love I'll
Iâll end your life

To you itâs just a face immersed in pain
Just one more life to end
Just one more life to end
Relentless acts of ignorance
Shall be your demise
Shall be your demise

Heartless resolution
Tears from your my eyes
Victim of failure
Sentenced to death

Heartless resolution
Tears from your my eyes
Victim of failure
Sentenced to death

Endless years of memories
Brought to an end
Only the ashes remain
I swear upon this grave
My hands will be your judge
My hands will be your judge

[Solo - Martin]

Heartless resolution
Tears from your my eyes
Victim of failure
Sentenced to death

Heartless resolution
Tears from your my eyes
Victim of failure
Sentenced to death

This is my time of revenge
This is my time of revenge
