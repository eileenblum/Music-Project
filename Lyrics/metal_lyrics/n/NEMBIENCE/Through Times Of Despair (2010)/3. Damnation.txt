From this day forward
You're the dark light
That shines on me
Determined to break
This mean reflection
I'll smash the mirrors
Using the pieces
To cut you away

As I walk through the fire
Seven angels scream seven deadly sins
This plague has been cast down to me
By hands that brought desolation

Rain the sorrows
Of thousands on me
The hurting was yours
But vengeance is mine

As I walk through the fire
Seven angels scream seven deadly sins
This plague has been cast down to me
By hands that brought desolation

I've lost myself
Never to find my way back to life
I'm longing to watch you die
Over and over again

[Solo - Martin]

Damnation

As I walk through the fire
Seven angels scream seven deadly sins
This plague has been cast down to me
By hands that brought desolation

Rain the sorrows
Of thousands on me
The hurting was yours
But vengeance is mine
