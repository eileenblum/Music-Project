Covered in blood
A blanket of death
To keep you warm
The savior
A cold heart that beats to the sound of
Every bullet that
Hits the ground

Twisting the knife in the back of deceit
And pain becomes your salvation
Pushing the sheep into the grave
And now you're crawling to reap their glory

Endless visions of decay
Eden will turn to dust
Reaper of the innocent
This will be your end

All life raped in vain
Relinquish
Answer to your sins
And suffer

[Solo - Martin]

Look to the sky in search for answers
You coward, acid will pour on your face
The constant reign of machines
Profits are kill counts
You're crowning yourself The Destroyer

Endless visions of decay
Eden will turn to dust
Reaper of the innocent
This will be your end

Endless visions of decay
Eden will turn to dust
Reaper of the innocent
This will be your end
