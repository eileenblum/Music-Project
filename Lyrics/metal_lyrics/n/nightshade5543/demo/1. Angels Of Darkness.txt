The Time of the Apocalypse sounded 
You will live in Shade, desperate, in Hatred 
All these People of shit must burst 
The Angels Of Darkness come cut your throat 

We are The Angels Of Darkness 
Sent on Earth from Hell 
We must cut you up and devour you 
You are afraid but already Dead 

Our art is the Crime, The Song Of Darkness 
You implore us but we decide 
You never liked anything and you regret it 
As you realize that you are Whores 

Are you ready to be raped ? 
Are you ready to be opened up ? 
Are you ready to Die ? 
Your Merciful God can't anything for you 

We are The Angels Of Darkness 
Sent on Earth from Hell 
We must cut you up and devour you 
You are afraid but already Dead 

You descend all now on, you burn 
You howl for all these suffering 
You want to survive but Death is stronger 
We reign from now on Mastersâ¦ Of Darkness !
