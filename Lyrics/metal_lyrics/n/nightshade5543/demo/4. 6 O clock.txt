Six o'clock, I wake up ! No one near me, 
Where are you ?! 
No words, no signs, nothing; I give up ! 
My heart's crying, some tears are falling down, 
Where are you ?! Where are you ?! 

I need my sweat, of this thing, small, white, so good ! 
I need to feed me, I need to feel better ! 
I need to fly, to dream, to fight enemies ! 
To kill enemies, see the Devil, the Angels !â¦ 
Am I at Heaven ? Am I at Heaven ?! 

Six o'clock, I wake up ! Just a dream ? You are here ! 
What did happen ?! I look at you, you're so pretty ! 
I try to touch you, your body, so sweat ! 
Butâ¦ I feel nothingâ¦ What's happening ?! I can't think it ! 
You're DEAD ! You fly ! Transparent; like a feather ! 

I wake up ! I wake up ! 
What do I feel ? Blood on my fingers ! 
Turning head, slowly, I see you, blood-coveredâ¦ 
Terrified, I can't move ! I can't cry, realize ! 

All around me, all becomes shade 
All is moving, the shadows on the wallâ¦ 
Am I crazy ? NO ! Am I tired ? NO ! Am I heart ? No ! 
So, what's happening ?!â¦ 
Oh I know ! I understand, all is clear now : 

I think I'm dead 
No one's crying over me ! 
No tears, no deception ! Why ? 
Nobody cries ! 
Nobody mourns to me ! 
I am covered by a white sheetâ¦ 

I was a junky, 
No proud to be but it's to late ! 
The Time is coming to pay, pay mistakes ! 
So I leave your World ! 
MY World ! 
To I hope, a better World !
