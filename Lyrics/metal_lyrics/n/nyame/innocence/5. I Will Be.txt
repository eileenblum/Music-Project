My child - Prepare for new life.
My child - You'll have to fight.
The life is bitter, painful,
but listen...

When you go to bed in dark nights
I will tuck you in (don't worry).
When the boogieman is in your nightmares,
just call me (to fight!).

I will be your Angel.
I will be your Light.
If you fall, I'll take you.
Simply raise your hand.

Forgive me.
Don't cry.
I couldn't choose.

Know the strongers, help the weekers,
you'll be both of them.
Share your knowledge, learn from others,
master of your way.

I will be your white Knight
or your pole star.
Just to guide your way,
lantern of the night.

I will be your Angel
I will be your Light.
And remember, always,
I'll be by your side.

Aspetta amor, il mio afetto ritornarÃ¡.
Lascia di piangere, sognaâ¦

I will be your Angel.
I will be your Light.
If you miss my voice,
listen to your heart.

I will be your Angel.
I will be your Light.
If you miss my voice,
listen to your heart.
