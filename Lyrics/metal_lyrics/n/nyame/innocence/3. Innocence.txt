Innocence, face of reverie,
return to me and fly.

Innocence, flow from my lost days.
You, burn again and crashâ¦

All the nightmares, all the sins.
And fall with me, with me.
Destroyed but free.

Lyric flame, full of purity.
Light my way and dieâ¦

Innocence, oh, my innocence!
Save yourself.

Dear innocence:

Felt with me when she kissed me
but no with you, frozen my memories
sharpening the mirror inside,
my eyes and my soul.

Free me, oh, Sacred Word:
Eternity...
Iced kiss is a prison to me.
Love is the key.

Fall over me, candid tears.
Fall in my heart with glee, childrenâs dreams.
Fall in the ice.
Roses for me and roses for you.
