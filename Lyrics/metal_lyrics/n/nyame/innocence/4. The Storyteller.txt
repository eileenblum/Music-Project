I'm the Death.
I'm the Fear.
I'm sure you know me.

If you meet
in my way
Go, run away!

I'm a Troll.
The Black Witch
who eats the babies.

If you want,
combat me.
Ready to die?

In the night I tell old stories.
Try to listen, learn, see and fly.

Mother, oh, mother!
Pray, pray for your children.
Mother, oh, mother!
Weâre not ready to go.

In your way, in your life,
everyday the sun will rise.
We must walk with our eyes in the skyline.

In your way, in your life,
everyday the sun will rise
We must walk with our eyes in the skyline.

(I) weave your dreams
in my loom.
I am Arachne.

The Gorgons,
Ceto too,
Monsters arrive!

Drinking wine,
singing songs.
Dance with the Satyrs.

In the war,
take your shield,
unsheathe and fight!

Grace the gods, honour the heroes.
Follow them, enjoy your life.

Mother, oh mother!
Give me, give me thy strength.
Mother, oh, mother!
Please, take care of my way.

In your way, in your life,
everyday the sun will rise.
We must walk with our eyes in the skyline.

Your problems donât mind
to smile.
Land ahoy!
Follow your star!

If you want to know my name:
âThe Storytellerâ.
Children came, elder too!
Listen my tales!
