This is the end of all
This is my final call
I write my last inscription
Obituary for the long lost Earth

The world is all empty now and time stands still
Only barren wastelands and the blood red skies
Where no one ever breathes, where no one ever cries
Except for me and only me

All is gone, all undone
Armageddon has finally come
I am omega â the last man on earth
I only smile in starlight

Speak, weep and scream â it doesnât matter
No oneâs there to listen, no oneâs there to answer
Eat, sleep, in victory, in defeat
Every day is all just the same

A thousand rusted skeletons of human accommodation
Stare the dead horizon with their cold and empty eyes
Theyâre my only companions in this life forsaken land
All just magnificent tombstones scraping the sky

I am omega
I am the last man on Earth

Dark night come and cover
Bury and hide the sunlight
That reveals, that resurrects
My loneliness, my emptiness

I still remember when this was the cradle of life
Now itâs just desert littered with demise
I wish the night would descend forever
For only in starlight I unfetter
