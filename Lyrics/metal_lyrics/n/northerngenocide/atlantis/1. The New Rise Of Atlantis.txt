Timeless epitome of freedom â high seas â now infected with disease

In the deep silence, in the cold, perpetual darkness
A great mass is forming â ominous, inevitable
By product of the putrid years of technological evolution

Manmade behemoth, synthetic destroyer of world
See the oceans suffocate and food chains deteriorate
Nothing can escape the inevitable that renders all inhabitable

All seas deliver this new rise of Atlantis
Born from consumption, derived from illusion
That we can have all despite the cost

Centuries of disregard and one day of destruction
The rise of new continent reveals sins of development
That what once was disposable is now millenniums old

This artificial abomination is forever the monument of desolation
The last trace of human race is the one that never fades away
Empty seas, corrupted lands and boundless mountains of waste
