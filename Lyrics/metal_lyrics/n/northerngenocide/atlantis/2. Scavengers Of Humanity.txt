Stand up, look around, do you feel â safe?
They are watching from everywhere, you canât hide
Eyes in the sky â safety in disguise
Surveillance technology, invading your privacy
Every move you make, every word you say
All are tracked and stored till the end of days

These leeches â digital scavengers
Like titans â almost immortal

Global connections â expanding reconnaissance network
Optical fibre web strangling like iron spider web
Blind from terror, seduced by leisure
We feared the fear itself and yearned for pleasure
One step from Hell, One step from Heaven
In the name of solutions we lost our freedom

Oh, what a future to behold
When our minds and souls are sold
To the markets and corporate entities
To the scavengers of humanity
Oh, what a future to behold
When our minds and souls are sold
Left are the cold restrictions and laws
The scavengers of humanity

Desire is relevant
I am not a machine

Rise, revolt and resist their endless filth
Rise, revolt and resist these goddamn pigs
