Undead in the crowd, misfits in a shroud
Hiding beneath a mask yet screaming out loud
All is irrelevant, all is in vain
All means nothing when desire is chained

Luxuria, nocturne â second skin
FaÃ§ade in the sun â cardinal sin

Tonight the worlds collide
Wings of steel and black velvet heels
Tonight of the worlds unite
Ravenous smile and dynamite
Stare the Devil eyes wide open and
Dance in the fire of desire
Release your soul and let it storm
Behold the universe reborn
Swirling beneath the skin,
Crawling inside the spine
Surrender to the beat, empower the lust
Embrace the madness behind lashes
Feel the fever, feel it burn
