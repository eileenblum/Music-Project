In the near future
The sixth extinction is one step away
Before this fall there was life

Rapid rivers. clear blue waters
Flowing free endlessly
Virgin soil, clean brisk winds
Vast pure forests as far as the eye can see
The sun, the moon, the changing of seasons form
The great diversity of the planet Earth and the
Strong foundations for the vivid flora.
The basis of life itself

Even paradise
The perfect dream of all mankind
Eden stands now defiled
In the name of better mankind
Even paradise
Will burn in the hands of the blind
Eden at the brink demise
Utopia turned to rust

Cataclysm mankind: eradication complete
Putrid streams of all burning acid
Run in the veins of mother earth
Defiled landscapes and foul oozing breezes
The toxic wastelands are the only things to look at

The sun burns all the forms of life and
Erosion grinds what is left to die
Total destruction â the fall of nature
Dystopia formed instead of utopia
Even paradise â Eden utopia
Can not stand the rise of the blind
Even paradise â Eden utopia
Can not stand the reasonâs demise
