I have seen the battlefields
The vast jungles of light and stone
Where every single living thing
Fights for the right to shine
The brightest stars in these times
Are in the TV and on the screen
And the speed of life is the speed of the light:
Supersonic humankind

Shine bright, your time is now, shine on before itâs gone
Hear the crowds going wild if you donât want it your in denial
Shine bright, your time is now, shine on before itâs gone
The sky is the limit, the world is mine, all the stars you can see me fly
You are supernova

You want it, you want it all
You want in now
You sell my soul for the chance to glow
In the theatre of lost souls
These superficial entities, these silicon filled atrocities
Spread the disease of stupidity like blow up dolls with STDs

Eat, breath, feast
This shit bleeding

Shine bright, your time is now, shine on before itâs gone
Your 15 minutes of burning fame at the prize of endless shame
Shine bright, your time is now, shine on before itâs gone
The 15 minutes of your useless fame then you are the game
