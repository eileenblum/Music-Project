Heartbeat, supersonic
Pounding chest, appalling
Hate of thought blinding
Comprehension all the time
Stress levels bursting
Through the roof to outer space
Life is gone, undone
By the soul overload
As blood begins to rust
and organs fall apart
Time is up, itâs the end of the road
Itâs the soul overload

Full throttle respiration
Overriding body functions
with enhancing potions
Nervous system shutting down
No time, no life
No life, no time
No time to the life
tragedy of a lifetime
