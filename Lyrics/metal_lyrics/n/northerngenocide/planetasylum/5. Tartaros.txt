No faith, no escape / same fate from day to day
Rust stains, acid rain / toxic fumes melt my brain
All I see is bricks and steel / black smoke, heavy industry
Dried lakes, abandoned railroads / Broken skin and hollow bones

My Elysium is the promise of intoxication

This is the true Hell / The true oblivion
This is my place in here I must stay
This is the true Hell / The true oblivion
This is my place â this is my Tartaros
Five days, ten hours / Twelve months for forty years
Frail man, spare part / Forgotten and disposable
This is it, this machine / My place in hierarchy
If it dies, so will I / I accept this madness
I forgot my dreams / I lost my beliefs
I chose the easy way / Became content and gray
Never challenged the status quo / Never took the leap of faith
Now Iâm old, bent and bitter / Sick and defiled by my life

My Elysium is the promise of intoxication
I can not bleed / I can not feel
I donât know where I start / and the machine stops
For my heart is rusted shut
