Overthrowing the world, man is no longer the leader
Victim of his own invention, because of his own nature
Computer revolution, the new human predator is born

We have been programmed to auto destruction
We have been programmed to violate our laws

Man has no longer control, he is just a supporting role
Victim of his own scenario, because of his own system
Machanical revolution, the new synthetic brain is born

We have been programmed to auto destrucion
We have been programmed to violate our laws

Violator, the system has programmed us

Violator, pushing extreme limits to the unknown
Victim of the modern world, because of a vision obsession
Computer revolution, the new human predator is born

We have been programmed to auto destrucion
We have been programmed to violate our laws
