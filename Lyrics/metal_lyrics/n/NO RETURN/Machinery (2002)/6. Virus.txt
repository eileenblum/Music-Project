Paralyzed
They are opening my skull
My mind is being emptied by a machine
They are implanting new information
Now I am really suffering

My brain is disconnected
My soul is doomed
Souvenirs have been destroyed
I've become a zombie

We are condemned to our system,
We are condemn to be manipulated

My body's under control
They have programmed my soul
They have erased my dreams
I've become a zombie

One day will come
When machines will control us.

Everyone is controlled by machines.
