Why?
Can't I be like all the others
Do what I want'n when ever
Need to inject the substance
So alive I can remain
Why me?

No!!!
I don't want to die [x2]
I don't want to die of transmitted disease

Why?
Did she transmit this disease
That drug addict took away my freedom breeze
I am condemned, my substance
Is the only way I can live,
Why me???!!!

I wish I could kill my mother
I can't, this fucking disease has disable me
Has kept me imprisoned in my own body
I wish I could kill my mother
I can't, her fucking disease has disabled me
Has kept me imprisoned in my own body
But I don't want to die!!!
