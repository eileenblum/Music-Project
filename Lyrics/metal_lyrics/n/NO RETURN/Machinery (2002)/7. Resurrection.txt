I perceive in the distance, as if I woke up from a coma,
My eyes are blurred, parasites obstructing my vision.
My body is cold, I am no longer breathing, can't feel my limbs
Where am I???

Hanging from an endless chain, I follow the stream of corps
Implanted objects running through my body
Data programmed in my memory
I've left the recycler, memberr of the bioomechanoid army
Programmed to serve the master dynamo
Data programmed in my memory

I'm his slave, I owe him my resurrection

Pieces of familiar images going through my head
Implanted dream changing for reality
Data programmed in my memory

I'm his slave, I owe him my resurrection
Resurrection [x4]

I owe him my resurrection, I must destroy all human kind.
I'm his slave, I am programmed to kill
Data programmed in my memory
