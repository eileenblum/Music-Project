Carcass of synthetic corpse
No longer part of the human blood
Drained from my flesh, my skin is the shell
Serving me the machine

Stage of transmission
My heart disconnected
I can not see, I can not feel anymore
Victim of the modern world
Victim of the modern world
Victim of a synthetic progress,
Epidemic of the modern world

Suffocation, strangulation, as my body leaps,
Extraction, dislodging, my soul is leaving me
Operation, production, they are abusing me
Implantation, transmutation, I am a biomechanoid

Give me the strength to run away
Give the capacity to make my way
Give me the force to respond
Give me the might I haven't found

Drained from my flesh, my skin is the shell
Serving me the machine
