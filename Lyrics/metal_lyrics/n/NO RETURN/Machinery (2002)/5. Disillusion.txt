I wish people would snap out of their conditioning
But the system has already programmed our destiny
I feel so misunderstood, all turned into machines,
But the system has already programmed our destiny

No more respect...no more dialogue
We are no longer humans
No dialogue, no respect
We are no longer humans
No dialogue, no respect

Getting use to the idea we're only here for a short stay
But the system has already programmed our destiny
I wish I could live forever among my people
But the system has already programmed our destiny

Just a few moments
No time to loose, cause time is only seconds...
It's for you to see, you know where you have to be
It's your lifem your destiny
