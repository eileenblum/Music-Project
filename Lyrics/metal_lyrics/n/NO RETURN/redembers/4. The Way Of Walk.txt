Some Got No Right To Talk
Some Got No Right To Choose Their Places
Convicted To Obey &amp; Submit    
Do You Feel The Pressure They Endure ?
Justify Their Behaviours
Justify Their Opinions
Being Conditionned By The Rules
At A Walk-Pace To Be Harmless
Why Will We Always Trust The Way Of The Walk?
Always The System Breaks Their Promises

Do You Feel The Pressure They Endure?
Justify Their Behaviours

Being Conditionned By The Rules
At A Walk-Pace To Be Harmless
Why Will We Always Trust The Way Of The Walk?
Always The System Breaks Their Promises
The Right Of Expression Belongs To The People
Who Got Money'S Power
Some Talk About Democracy ?
We Musn'T Never Compromise The Control
Of Our Lives    
Not To Keep Fuckin'Pride, To Keep Our Dignity
Numbers Among The Others In This Modern Society
I Refuse To Be A Pawn
I Refuse To Be Fucked Up
Never Will I Change My Point Of View
I'M Not A Model Without Voice
I'Ll Choose My Way Forever
Why Will We Always Trust The Way Of The Walk?
Always The System Breaks Their Promises
We Must Fight, We' Must Fight
That Society Progress!
