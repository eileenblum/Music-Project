A Red Colour Of Liberty
Some Pleasures With Lustful Appearance
Some Features With Forced Laughs
Forms Of Tears To Fade The Shame
So Far From The Pictures [X2]
I'D Like To See
Some Sharp Knives Are Teasing
The Breakable Peace
 From Those Clouds Of Sad Expressions
Rain Will Fall Down Again
To Purify The Naked Souls
Empty Of Sense By The Red Embers
So Far From The Pictures [X2]
I'D Like To See
Some Sharp Knives Are Teasing
The Breakable Peace Breakable!
I Can Eel This Reality Discharging
Overfull Madness
So Far From The Pictures [X2]
Id Like To See Hings I Admit
