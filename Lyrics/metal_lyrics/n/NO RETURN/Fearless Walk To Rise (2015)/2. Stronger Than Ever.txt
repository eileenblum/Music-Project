You know there's nowhere to escape
It's carved in stone
I own your fear
I own your fate
You can pray as long as you stay afraid

No, it's time to face my hate
Keep your sticky fingers off me
I hate your stench
I hate your stench
Let me just laugh you

[2x]
Stronger than ever
You're now under my orders
Stronger than ever

I know it's better to stay alone
I own your fear
I own your fate

Took a little time before you tried to fuck me!
I am stronger than your zombies army

[2x]
Stronger than ever
You're now under my orders
Stronger than ever

I can see your misery
I'm the protector of your insanity
Of your reality

Look into my eyes
Look into my eyes
And see you fear's reflection
Look into my eyes
And feel my plan to see you crawl

Now it's time to face my hate
Keep your sticky fingers off me
I hate your stench
I hate your stench
Let me just laugh you

[2x]
Stronger than ever
You're now under my orders
Stronger than ever

Stronger than ever
