Skinning you layer by layer skin flesh and bones
Embrace the horror inflicted by me
Skinning you layer by layer, skin flesh and bones
Embrace this hatred illness I inflict you

Fear is my tool
To keep you down
Hate is my way
To hold my crown

I am learning through your pain
To feed your mind against yourself
I won't dissolve this feeling of me
Falling away from myself
Into the empty rooms of death

My mind is closed for repairs
My mind is closed so don t stay in my way

As I stand at the edge of your existence
Stay here til the windows stop burning for your dreams
As I stand at the edge of your existence
Stay here til your last breath
Toxic power attached your soul

This is the sense of perdition
My toxic power
This is the way to hold my crown
To see you crawl

Fear is my tool
To keep you down
Hate is my way
To hold my crown

I am learning through your pain
To feed your mind against yourself
I won't dissolve this feeling of me
Falling away from myself
Into the empty rooms of death
