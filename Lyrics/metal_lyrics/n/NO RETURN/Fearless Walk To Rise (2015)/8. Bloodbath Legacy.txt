Remove your tyrannic tears
And look at my leadership
Defeat is not for me
I find ways for victory
Even if I'm covered by your blood
This is the bloodbath legacy

I can feed rancour and my sightless scorn
With your blood
The beast inside me is still searching
This bloodbath legacy

I'd rather destroy myself
Than be destroyed by you
Feel the hate that burns deep in me
Beware of my wrath full of rage
Return to your dark path
Return! I know the smell of revenge

I can feed rancour and my sightless scorn
With your blood
The beast inside me is still searching
This bloodbath legacy

I won't stay for ever!
I'll be here til you die!

Open your eyes and look at the soldiers
On the ground around me
I'd rather destroy myself
Than be destroyed by you
Feel the hate that burns deep in me
Beware of my wrath full of rage
Return to your dark path
Return! I know the smell of revenge

I can feed rancour and my sightless scorn
With your blood
The blast inside me is still searching
This bloodbath legacy

Blood!
