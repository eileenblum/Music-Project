They live and let innocents die in misery
There's no mercy for the weak
No chance for you and me

Nothing lasts forever
We're not blind

I'm hiding behind the shadow of their grim slyness
I will rise above their saint-like disguise
Watching horror conspiracy

You dream of a better tomorrow
Senseless shutdowns for sorrow
I dream that the submission falls
Please look further than your window

Nothing lasts forever
We're not blind

They need to control the truth
Controlling information
They need to create confusion
Controlling your submission

You dream...

Global conspiracy led by the shadow governments
For a new world order without your miserable life

I'm hiding behind the shadow of their grim slyness
I will rise above their saint-like disguise
Watching horror conspiracy

You dream...
