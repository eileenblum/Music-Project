Many times you swore to be
Many times you're the witness
No need for sympathy, insanity runs in me!

For so long I tried to be what I'll never be
For so long I tried to find a way
To go back into the past to live

I've tried to hide my best
It sucked, so fuck the rest
Never to swore to be the best, I don't care!
Spit your poison back in my face again!

And so you hear my voice again
Just need to throw this blackness
Shake the silence and hear what I have to say
Many times I swore to be
Many times I was the witness
No need for sympathy, insanity runs in me!

For so long I tried to be what I'll never be
For so long I tried to find a way
To go back into the past to live

I've tried to hide my best
It sucked, so fuck the rest
Never to swore to be the best, I don't care!
Spit your poison back in my face again!

Follow me into your misty rain
Follow me into no more pain

Life is just the mirror of your vision you swore!
You swore!

And so I hear your voice again
When you need a friend as me
Shake your old thoughts and hear what I have to say
Many times you swore to be
Many times you're the witness
No need for sympathy
Now believe me I'm so free

For so long I tri ed to be what I'll never be
For so long I tried to find a way to go back into the past to live

I've tried to hide my best
It sucked, so fuck the rest
Never to swore to be the best, I don't care!
Spit your poison back in my face again!
