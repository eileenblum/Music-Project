I realize that everything you think is so cold
Each breath is like a last ceremony
I realize that you are locked in your own trap
You cross the line
This is your interlude of life

Your hatred plan awaits you, filled of sadness
And the revenge grows with each word from you

You must paint your world
Find a way deep into your dreams
You must paint your world
Try to flee from cruel reality

Memories need to re erased to live

I don t know why you're wasting your own time
You cross the line
This is I hi way that turns to sadness

Your hatred pian awaits you, filled of sadness
And the revenge grows with each word from you
You re as afraid as if you were sitting on a bomb
You have to change your way before this turns into drama

You must paint your world...
Memories need to be erased to live

Your regrets are looking at you, filled with sadness is
She s here to hear you with a love full of regrets
And you're as afraid as if you were alone in this world
You have to look at her
Leave this haunted sorrow

You must paint your world
Find a way deep into your dreams
You must paint your world
Try to flee from cruel reality
