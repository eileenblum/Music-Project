Reflections of demons haunting my conscience
Stretched the limits of my psychic tolerance
Trapped in a mental prison
Trapped in a dark self conception

Reality focused through self forbidden thoughts
I need to feel the fear
I need to feel the dark
Like you I am dressed in sin
Full of misery

Beyond my eyes
Beyond my words
I try to face the emptiness of my soul
Beyond my eyes
Beyond my words
I'm the echoes of my promises

These visions of my corpse haunting my conscience
I've stretched the limits of this dark astral travel
Trapped in a mental prison
Trapped in a dark self conception

Beyond my eyes...
Let me dream again
Let me breathe again

Unchain me, forgiving none
Now I can face my darkness

I've always been between another set of walls
Outside of which the world is watching down on me
I've always heard a dark silence speak inside...

Reflection of demons haunting my conscience
I've stretched the limits of my psychic tolerance
Trapped in a mental prison
Trapped in a dark self conception

Reality focused through self forbidden thoughts
I needed to feel the fear
I needed to face the dark
Like you I am dressed in sin
Full of misery

Beyond my eyes
Beyond my words
I try to face the emptiness of my soul
Beyond my eyes
Beyond my words
I'm the echoes of my promises
