Overdose of your poison
Overcome by your hatred soul
I was blind in my ocean full of flame
I was cloaked in mask
Left fearing control but my soul was observing this scene

So many times I've designed better victims
And finally I was as sad as you
So many times I've been sad cause of your lies
And finally I followed them in pain

I'm no longer lost
I've just decided my way
I'm no longer lost
I've just decide the way of your end

This is the fearless walk to rise!
Now it is my time to live
This is my fearless walk to rise!

You know the venom that I hold from you
I keep it as a scheduled lethal injection
Cause I need to see your lifeless walk to lose

I'm no longer lost
I've just decided my way
I'm no longer lost
I've just decide the way of your end

This is the fearless walk to to rise!
Now it is my time to live
This is my fearless walk to rise!

I'm no longer lost
I've just decided my way

Overdose of your poison
Overcome by your hatred soul
I was blind in my ocean full of flames
I was cloaked in a mask
Left fearing control
But my soul was observing this scene

This is the fearless walk to rise
Now it is my time to live
This is my fearless walk to rise
This is your lifeless walk to lose
