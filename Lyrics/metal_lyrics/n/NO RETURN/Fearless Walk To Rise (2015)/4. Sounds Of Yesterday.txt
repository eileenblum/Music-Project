Sweet sounds of yesterday
Becomes forbidden fires
Where the dark snake is dancing
This evil spreads in us forever
It lurks beneath my skin

Look into your heart
Black cold days will never cease
Look into your heart
Your nightmare is just at the beginning
Look into your heart
You already know you're gonna lose

Do you see the dark ruins where we've walked before
You walk on a moving ground
Where no lights, where no friends can appear

Reality screams again
And you'll soon have to pay
You'll soon have to pay again and again
Black cold, days will never cease
But believe me I'm still your worst enemy

Look into your heart
Your nightmare is just at the beginning
Look into your heart
You already know you're gonna lose

Do you see the dark ruins where we've walked before
You walk on a moving ground
Where no lights. where no friends can appear

Reality screams again...
Sweet sounds of yesterday
Becomes forbidden fires
Where the dark snake is dancing
This evil spreads in us forever
It lurks beneath my skin
Reality screams again...
