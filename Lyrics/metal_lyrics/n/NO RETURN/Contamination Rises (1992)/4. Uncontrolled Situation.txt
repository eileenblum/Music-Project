How many roads of mysteries 
Will guide us for the misery
The system we suffer binds ourselves
Now we can't live with this century
Cursed existence
Insanitary society
Imperturable machinery
Inquest on oneself, the public order
When shall we pay for the air
Great justice will often follow for your
Malevolent actions
Hypocritical conspiracy has played
With their famous power
Evicted from the right way
Refusing to submit
Suffocation in your brain
Cursed existence
Insanitary society
Imperturable machinery
Political, justice, repulsion
Business, election, franchise
Black cases, arms sales, and wars
Eviction, pollution, corruption
How many roads of mysteries 
Will guide us for the misery
The system we suffer binds ourselves
Now we can't live with this century
