Tears of blood in it's eyes
Strange madness in the mind
Follow the fate evil instilled
Demonic possesion incurable disease

Foaming at the mouth
Big eyes scan an innocent
Cut the throat of the victim
Draging the corpse inside the house

Inside the house the ritual is back violent attack
The memories will be carved
Horrible stench throughout the rooms

Mortuary atmosphere
Massacring all the rest
Captivated by the massacre
Cannibal instinct he feeds on the flesh

He feeds on the flesh the ritual is back violent attack

Scattered on the floor
Watching the work of the ghoul
Torn hairs around fingers
Vomit of disgust upon the carcass
