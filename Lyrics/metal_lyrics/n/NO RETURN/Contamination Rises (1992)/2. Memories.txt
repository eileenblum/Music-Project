I feel headache and emptiness
I have the feeling that I'm slowly dissapear
Inert. Without reactions, pictures file past in my head
Cold sweat runs from my resting body

I'm nothing anymore. I can't still exist
I'm nothing anymore. I can't still exist

Screaming the sorrow nobody will understand
My soul will speak with nature
Imagining dark shadows for my souvenirs
Those remains of the memories that chase me

They chase me as a desire consumes me
I'm only a particle drowned into? the infinite

Angels of the sky, here they can't exist
Lost in their hell, cut down are their wings
Coated into the fog that surrounds every dream
My spirit is hunted toward a dawn without end
A dimension which doesnt exist
I'll immerse myself straight on the eternal rest

I'm nothing anymore. I can't still exist
I'm nothing anymore. I can't still exist

They chase me as a desire consumes me
I'm only a particle drowned into? the infinite
