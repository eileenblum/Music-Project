Remember the pictures from the past
Generations are born and dead
Out of work, big cause of delinquency
Immigration, adaptation, permanent battle through nations
Now drugs are all around
Evolution to a certain death
Downtown you can't close your eyes
Desolation, provocation, your kid is with those guys
Need to find the way out
Suicidal reactions in his mind
Lock the door, stay indifferent
Catastrophic approbation from your part
Make your choice to survive
Your only law is your law
Dependence for a trash world
Your way will drive you to hell
Remember the pictures from the past
Generations are born and dead
Downtown you can't close your eyes
Desolation, provocation, your kid is with those guys
