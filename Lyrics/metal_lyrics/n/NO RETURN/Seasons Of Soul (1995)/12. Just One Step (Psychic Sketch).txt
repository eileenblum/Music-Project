Defeat Lusts After Victory,
From Victory Up Is Defeat,
My Short Life Has Been Forfeit.

What Do Love And Hate But Suffering Represent ?
From You To Me, That Distance I Do Not Resent.

Between Reconciliation And Estrangement,
No ! Never Have I Felt Resentment !
Attraction And Digust Fo
Each Other Were Just One
Step Further.
Only For You And Me;
Do Not Be My Enemy !

By Mire Was Such An
Ordeal, Let Us Try A New Deal !
Let Us Try A New Deal !
Let Us Try A New Deal ?
A New Deal ...
