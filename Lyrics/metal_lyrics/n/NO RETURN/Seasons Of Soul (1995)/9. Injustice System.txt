After All Your Defeats Nobody Would Comfort You
You Know What It Means To Live In Fear

All This Bitterness Wells Up Inside You
Hopeless Situation You Were Being Ruled

You Re Disgusted At Such Injustice System

You Re Accused Of Things You Ve Never Done
They Call Your Name Protest And Fight

Someone Shows An Interest In You But Would Beat You
You Must Beware Of The Hollowfriend

All This Bitterness Wells Up Inside You
Scapegoat You Must Kill Your Weakness All Your Weaknesses

Rise, You Re Nothing In Their Laws

All The Time They Need To Judge Guilty

You Re Disguted At Such Injustice System

You Re Accused Of Things You Ve Never Done
Defend Your Way Protest And Fight !
