What Do I See
Cops In Uniform
A Loaded Gun In Hand
Excessive Authority

I Hear Shots
Bullet For Self Defence

To Defend Myself I Just Need My Mind

Animal S Instinct
Urban Realities
Free Aggressions
Assholes Ready To Kill
To Steal Money Or To Wear Pleasure
There S No Justice There S Just Em

I Hear Shots
Bullet For Self Defence

To Defend Myself I Just Need My Mind

Now I Lie Down To Sleep
In This Cold Hole My Soul To Keep
If I Should Die Before I Wake
Remember Me For My Humans Sake
Humean Sake
Loaded Gun

I Remember That My Father
A Loaded Gun On The Temple
And This Reality Which Has Pushed Him
To Do Is This Act The Truth Hurts

I Hear Shots
Bullet For Self Defence

Thurdsday October Twenty Ninth
Nineteen Ninety Three
Will Stay The Day Of His Suicide
Of His Suicide

In The Memory Of Bourgeois Jean Jules 1935-1993
