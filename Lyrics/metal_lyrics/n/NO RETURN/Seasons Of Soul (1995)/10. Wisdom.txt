Rise
Pure Right Thoughts
At The First Hour
Of Our Civilization
But Now Wisdom Has
Been Transformed
In Dark Ages Of
Incomprehension

Politicians Defend
Their Ways, Who
Resolves Human Race
Problems ?

Instinct Of Survival
Metamorphosis Of
Human Spirit Like
Jackal Spirit

Dead, That'S The Way
I See It

Ideological Promise
Of Wisdom
Liberty, Equality,
Brotherhood
On The Verge Of
Ruin, Aux Oubliettes
Wisdom On The Verge
Of Ruin

If In Future Times,
We Wished To Better
Fight Against
Negative Evil Until
The End

Must Teach Our
Children
The Real Value Of Things
Until The End
