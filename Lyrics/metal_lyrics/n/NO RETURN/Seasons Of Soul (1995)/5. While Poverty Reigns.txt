I See Open Smiles
Who Don 'T Care This Reality
Each Day , Each Hour
Each Minute, Each Second
Many Thousands Of Children
Are Dying Of Starvation

Obvious Property Fortune, Leading Characteristic
Narrow Mind-Edness

You Delight In Inhuman Iron Collar
But Fellow Men Are Living In A Trash
This Rotten Fortune
Which Equals Your Scorn
Which Equals Your Boredom
And The Extreme Lusts
Wallowed In Idleness
While Poverty Reigns

Obvious Property
Fortune Leading Characterisc
Narrow Mind Edness
You Delight In Inhuman
Iron Collar
Iron Collar
Iron Collar
While Fellow Men Are
Living In A Trash
I See All These Poor Children
Who Sell Their Bodies
For Half A Meal By Day
And I See You Flirty Dog
You Who'S Hiding Disguise
The Dirt Of Your
Impure Soul
Impure Soul

Under Those Expensive Perfumes
You Stink
And I See You Dirty Dog
You Who'S Hiding Disguise
The Dirt Of Your Impure Soul
Impure Soul
I Will Be Happy If This Money
That Some People Waste Could Kill Them
