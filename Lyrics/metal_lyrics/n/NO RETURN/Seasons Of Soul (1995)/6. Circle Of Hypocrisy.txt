What'S Your Fucking Goal ?
I Want Positive Truth
You Point Your Finger.
Things Better To Do
You Talk Too Much
It'S Suicidal To Believe In
You, Malicious Remarks Are Fallacy

Argue In A Vicious Circle,
Circle Of Hypocrisy

Lies
Hasy Hurtful Scorn
Can'T Accuse Me

Why This Hate ?
To Survive ?
To Be The Strongest
Real Loud Mouth

Today You Can Crow
Who Do You Think You Are ?
You Can'T Exr Orush Over
Sometimes You Can Fall, Fall.
Hate.

Why This Hate ?
You Waste Your Time
To Be The Strongest
A Big Pleasure

It'S Suicidal To Believe In
You, Malicious Remarks Are Fallacy

Ever You Believe Crow
Who Do You Think I Am ?
You Can'T Always Win
Today, Today You Fall
