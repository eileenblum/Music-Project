Leaving My Self Existence Of Unfaith
I Abandonned Pain, Escaping Never Ending War
My Body' S Taking The Plunge In The Blank,
No Vision Of Despair
I Hate Legacy Of Brutality

Rage, Accomplished Mission, You Look Down
At My Empty Eyes, No Wink Of Life

Here Is Time Bomb, I Hate You, I Don'T Agree With Your Acts

I Never Want To Answer Requirement To Be A Soldier
Do You Feel It, Like I Feel It ?
This Is My Psychological Revenge

On The Other Side, Soul Exists
Truth Will Out On The Right Side Of The Tracks

War Must Be Stopped

Rear Rape The Children, Assassinate The Enemies
What Would You Think If You Saw Your Mother Dead ?
You Dominate Ever Again Pretties For You
Your Nation Will Offer You A Nice Burial Place
I Never Want To Answer Requirement To Be A Soldier
Do You Feel It, Like I Feel It ?
I' M Dead, I Never Feel Your Kickbacks
Criminal Acts Hide The Real
Truth Will Out
