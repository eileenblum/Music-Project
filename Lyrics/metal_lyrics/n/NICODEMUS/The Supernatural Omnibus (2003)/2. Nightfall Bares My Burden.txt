Here I ponder such bitter thoughts and complications.
Layeth I shall in haunted sleep.

Trust in my instincts...beware I shall of these appetites.
No rest for the wicked soul I keep.
A restless mind and dancing eyes...
Here I wish to dream of you tonight.
Though any dream upon this night shall suffice.

Wind ravaged curtains casts...
Shadows upon the lifeless walls.
Observations from this circumstantial slumber.
Unconscious yet wide-eyed, I await the epiphany.

Nightfall bares my burden...
Here magnified by the chilling moonrise.
When light takes leave, why is all undone?
Mistakes are always silent,
Though regrets reach us too clearly.
Why must my torment breed this fear?

Wallowing in vampyric servitude hour by hour...
For it grows more profane.
And yet what this superstition hath maintained,
A firm hold o'er minds of men...tis thy bane.
Anchor me to anything...forgive me but I fear I'm drowning.
Wheres't thing hear this night?

Allow me to give you some notion of her.
Not that first impression, whatever it may have been.
But the absolute reality of her...
As I gradually learnted to see it.
She was, beyond all comparison,
The most graceful, and exquisite woman I've ever seen.
But with a grace and beauty,
That has nothing to do with a preconceived notion.
Or previous experience of what goes by these names.

It is conceivable, that there once in a thousand years may rise.
A combination of lines, a system, a gesture...
By which is unprecedented beauty.
I remember in the course of that one day,
Perhaps I was dreaming.
You looked every now and then, as if you'd remark.
The crown has fallen from my brow.

There was a time she once would swoon at my vehemence,
But then she turned away and dropped my hand.
I beg this resolution, a vision profound, which frightens thee.

Wind ravaged curtains casts...
Shadows upon the lifeless walls.
Observations from this circumstantial slumber.
Unconscious yet wide-eyed, I await the epiphany.
