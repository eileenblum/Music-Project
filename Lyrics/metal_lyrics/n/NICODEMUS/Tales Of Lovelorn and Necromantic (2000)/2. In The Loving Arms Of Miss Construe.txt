Shadows are the lost and drowned.
A gift, for me, to resist the dawn.
A breaking voice these waves in the air.
Call me hence, in a patient stare.

In timeless beauty.

Caught within the passing ring.
Ideas that should not come to me.
Pondering this lifeless dream of mine.
I will awake to find my concubine.

In timeless worlds-ALIVE

Make these consequences dissipate.
I no longer wish to adhere to reason.
Take these understandings from my mind.
I need to feel this spiritual disarray.

Divine are the thoughts that render me.
Capable of sense and sight.
A vicious carnivore this wind.
Lick my wounds, my sins rescind.

Dispel my fear this...

Night where I find her face.
Comfort here in her embrace.
The cloudless shelter bares my swoon.
In the loving arms of Miss Construe.

In timeless worlds-ALIVE

Make these consequences dissipate.
I no longer wish to adhere to reason.
Take these understandings from my mind.
I need to feel this spiritual disarray.
Follow the words I hear her say.
I only want to hear her sounds.
Layeth me before the break of day.
Oh, but to feel the baying of the sleepless hounds.

The heavens are ablaze with fear.
And as haunted as my gaze.
The silhouette of my intentions,
Can be seen through this dark and dreadful baze.
