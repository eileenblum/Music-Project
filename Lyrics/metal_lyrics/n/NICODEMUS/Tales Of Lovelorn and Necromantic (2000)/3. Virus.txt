From immortal Eden to me hequeath.
Throw unto me your jagged spells.
Forever is a dream and dream I shall.
A promise so vain, so true, sleep well.
Through the catacombs fallen,
Through a void so deep and rank.
The harshened realm wrapped in sharpening winds.
Thusly raped by the thorns of discontent.

Walking through the worlds blind.
Corrupt and consuming me.
Sharing secrets this tender heart of mine.
Walking through the nefarious land of time.
Wandering interests benign,
Tearing secrets speaks to heart of things.
Die if I shall in this phantasy.

Necromancer dance to a flame that lures,
Shadows from their hiding.
A cruel embrace like lovers from a tragedy.
A lost servant to the breath of thy nemesis.
Lurking in every caress this bitter temptation.
Disguised beneath her sweetened cunt.
Flower of passions through air to breath,
Spores of illusion pollute my weeds.

Weaving through the hands of redemption.
This eve will glisten with the dew of this new world.
Under spells cast by moon light I welcome this parasite,
Into my temple of carnal light.
