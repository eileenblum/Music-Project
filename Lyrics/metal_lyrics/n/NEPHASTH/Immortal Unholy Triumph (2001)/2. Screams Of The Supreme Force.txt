Disturbing the dictators forces
Creating the era of supreme revelations
Immobile you do not have reaction
Feel the fury from my words

Wandering in a underworld
Your prayers did not have effect
Your attempt was frustrated
The hate becomes a tempting escape

The true acts get the impossible
Never live of beginning without any base
Do not fear your instinct
Do not drown in lamentations
Sustaining a lie, you get lost in your acts
Rotting in the emptiness

Being in death, agony in pain
The shadows of the forgetfulness
They reign on your soul
Devouring your force
Eating away your sanity

I will be the torturer in your sentence
I will turn of falsehood your misfortune
Thirsty for vengeance, I will spread the plague
I will break the crosses of your existence

Screams for the supreme force
Screams for the supreme force

The true acts get the impossible
Never live of beginning without any base
Do not fear your instinct
Do not drown in lamentations
Sustaining a lie, you get lost in your acts
Rotting in the emptiness

Disturbing the dictators forces
Creating the era of supreme revelations
Immobile you do not have reaction
Feel the fury from my words
They reign on your soul
Devouring your force
Eating away your sanity
