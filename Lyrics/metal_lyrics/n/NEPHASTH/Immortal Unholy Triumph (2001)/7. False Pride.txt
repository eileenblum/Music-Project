In the flames of insanity
Facts of the past
Freed by the coincidence
Causing disturbances

The anguish came back
Stop the torment
The voice of the fear in my mind
Never turn the light, the light of the salvation
In the dark side of my eyes
Committing the impatience
Unlikely return

Death created by an image
The ignorant force
Suspicious acts
Defeated by insanity

The shadows are spread without control
The indifference finds its space
In the decadence chained to the past
The created image
The anguish came back
Stop the torment
The voice of the fear in my mind
Never turn the light, the light of the salvation
In the dark side of my eyes

Created image
Insane force
Created image
