Created by the mind
Emerge visions of fury
Images with the color of blood
Lost in a morbid catastrophe

Words in a satirical silence
Confirming the trauma
Vomiting the rage, preaching disgrace
And challenging the spited lies

My acts makes the scenery of horror
The evil shows the intensity of the trauma
A trauma grown in shadows
Of an immortal nightmare

Words in a satirical silence
Confirming the trauma
Vomiting the rage, preaching disgrace

My acts makes the scenery of horror
The evil shows the intensity of the trauma
A trauma grown in shadows
Of an immortal nightmare

My indignation makes the fear
A sick thought
An escape in a lost world
The reality

Created by the mind
Emerge visions of fury
Images with the color of blood
Lost in a morbid catastrophe
