Unholy storms of fury - hear me
Open the hell's gate - the empire
Invade the mortal world - I evoke
Free the forgetful fire

Immortal flames of victory - hear me
Burn the Christ's church - the cancer
Master the mortal world - I order
Free the genocidal fire

Cold winds carries the flames
Blasphemies killing the holy faith
You'll see I burn this world
Fallen cross increase the lie
Enemies dying for this belief
You'll see I burn this world

Blackness, bleeding
Suffocated screams by infernal war
Nothingness, suffering
I am the silence, I am the wrath

The wrath will be the fire
The wrath will be the fire
The wrath will be the fire
The wrath will be the fire

Evil's creation, lords of curse
Merciless warriors thirsty for blood
Spreading the plague on the new empire
Reigning on the wrath of fire

Unholy storms of fury - hear me
Open the hell's gate - the empire
Invade the mortal world - I evoke
Free the forgetful fire

Immortal flames of victory - hear me
Burn the Christ's church - the cancer
Master the mortal world - I order
Free the genocidal fire

Blackness, bleeding
Suffocated screams by infernal war
Nothingness, suffering
I am the silence, I am the wrath

Cold winds carries the flames
Blasphemies killing the holy faith
You'll see I burn this world
Fallen cross increase the lie
Enemies dying for this belief
You'll see I burn this world
