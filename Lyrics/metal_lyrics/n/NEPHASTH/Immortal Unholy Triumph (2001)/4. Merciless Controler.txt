Lives are wasted
Leaded by the controller
Given up to the unknown
Constant fights with yourself

Marked present for strong conflicts
After the contact with the lie
Faithful bastards carries the martyrdom
Scattered chaos by the merciless soul

After the revelation
Prisoner of the remorse
Given up to the stranger
Wandering without pride

Merciless soul
Hidden hate in its face
Masquerade
Carry this ignorance like a slave

Beg for an absolution until remorse appears
Destroy your instinct and die like a weak

Written destiny, doomed
Irreversible way of domain
Stupid faith in the unreal
Slaving masses
Marked present for strong conflicts
After the contact with the lie
Faithful bastards carries the martyrdom
Scattered chaos by the merciless soul

After the revelation
Prisoner of the remorse
Given up to the stranger
Wandering without pride

Merciless soul
Hidden hate in its face
Masquerade
Carry this ignorance like a slave
