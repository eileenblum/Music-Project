Fear of the deception
Mortal victims
Carry it faithfully like
Slaves to suffer

Empty on me your arguments
And make me convinced that it is the best for me

Acquired desires in the sarcastic coming
My acts are eternally condemned
Improper and inexplicable intervention
Reasons that are misery

Inquiring fear!!

Evident incapacity
Your acts are false
Die and free us
Before the teaching
Freedom was emergent
Now it's a privilege

Inquiring fear!!

Acquired desires in the preaching
Your acts are false
Your words are lies
Die and free us
Of your preachings!!!

The mental devastation caused by the bible
Holy criticism of the bastards - lunatic

Inquiring fear!!

Evident incapacity
Your acts are false
Die and free us
Before the teaching
Freedom was emergent
Now it's a privilege

Empty on me your arguments
And make me convinced that it is the best for me

Fear of the deception
Mortal victims
Carry it faithfully like
Slaves to suffer!!!!
