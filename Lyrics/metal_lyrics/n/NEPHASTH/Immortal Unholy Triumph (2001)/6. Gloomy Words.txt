All reality is a mortal condemnation
For dark acts of the carnal existence
The power comes from the darkness that flames
Penetrating under divine devotion

False memoirs bleed like if they were true
They conspire over the profane humanity
Instinctive movements of the malign ego
Mediocre anger of the abomination reign about
Envy prevails destroying the sacred
It's just a simple and moral catastrophe
They are cynic values of the human alienation
The supremacy that limits defamation

Personification of the dark reality
The immortality controlling the evil
The scenary transfigured in a blood ritual
A savage and bloody testimony
The perversity is something of creation
The evil embodies the purification of the breeding
Envy prevails destroying the sacred
They are cynic values
