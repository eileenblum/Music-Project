During centuries
An arrested voice
A chained force
In the christian misery

The dry wind of the plague
Desolating the mortal preaching
Deceived empty lives
The lie finds the face of truth

Writings that are said sacred
Lost in poor minds
Fictious surrealist legend
Shelter of weak

Be truths dictated
Massacre of opinions
Defeated the false preaching
The expected victory is conquered

Giving up the existence
The bastard anger
Emerging in fire
That's determining its end
During centuries
An arrested voice
A chained force
In the christian misery

The dry wind of the plague
Desolating the mortal preaching
Deceived empty lives
The lie finds the face of truth

Writings that are said sacred
Lost in poor minds
Fictious surrealist legend
Shelter of shit
