Burning in an awful reality
Bloody visions feed the anger
A storm drops on you
Blind, you ignored your instincts

The truths passed in front of you
You were stopped, imploring salvation
Dying slowly

Pay for your ignorance
Pay with your life

All your life is given up to the stranger
The crosses of your faith are not good for anything

Pay for your ignorance
Pay with your life

The flames of supreme truth
Reigning chaos, sprouting the fury
Genocide ridiculing the weakness
Empty minds will be forgotten

Destroyed by a superficial faith
Writing provoking intense disgrace

Pay for your ignorance
Pay with your life

The darkness in the eyes of lost ones
The promised light is your intense agony

Pay for your ignorance
Pay with your life
