Impregnated excuses of manipulations
Drops from afraid minds
Ridiculous peace form
Illusion made by the Bible

A weak clutch drives him!!!

To think one will be safe is to be lowered
Only the full sanity will save you
Don't get fooled with so little

Writing lies remained like an excuse for the weak
The fear of the end preached by manipulators

Desperate souls - their end
Ready, he waits for - a trap

Arrested awaiting the apocalypse
Burning in anguish without sense
The end arriving slowly

Desperate souls - their end
Ready, he waits for - a trap

Arrested awaiting the apocalypse
Burning in anguish without sense

Writing lies remained like an excuse for the weak
The fear of the end preached by manipulators

Impregnated excuses of manipulations
Drops from afraid minds
Ridiculous peace form
Illusion made by the Bible

A weak clutch drives him!!!

Writing lies remained like an excuse for the weak
The fear of the end preached by manipulators
