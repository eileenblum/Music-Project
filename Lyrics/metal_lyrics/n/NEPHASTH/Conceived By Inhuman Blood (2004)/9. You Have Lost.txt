Now that your destiny is given to the unknown
Fear the most terrible end for your sanity
Through your stormier nightmare
We can see yours worst fears

We are those that guide the profanation
We are the truth that makes your God lessen

The mental chaos that degenerates your reason
It was created from your choice
You chose the way
You lost

The light that you seek
Blinded your weak mind
Said promises of the Greed voice
Rotten you crawl in your grave

You will die for your naiveness
Fear the most terrible end for your sanity
You chose the way
You lost

Now that your destiny is given to the unknown
Fear the most terrible end for your sanity
Through your stormier nightmare

The mental chaos that degenerates your reason
It was created from your choice
You chose the way
You lost
