Follow the blazing way of thinking and acting
Have total domain on thoughts
Without lamenting for false promises
Without tolerating false weaknesses

What you have considered sin
You wanted for centuries
Fearful stupid mortal one
Blinded by the Greed, tormented by fear

You die for somebody that is not worth one life
Surrounded by serpents, you lose common sense

Fearful stupid mortal one
Blinded by the Greed, tormented by fear

Falling in the alienation emptiness
Now crawl and beg for your life

Without lamenting for false promises
Without tolerating false weaknesses

Blind servant of putrid principles
You follow the light that is given to worms
Decadent teachings of lies and suffering
Let suffering decide over your instincts

Follow the blazing way of thinking and acting
Have total domain on thoughts
Without lamenting for false promises
Without tolerating false weaknesses
