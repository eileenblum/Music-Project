Spoiled useless souls
Followers of the absurdity
Your fine future reserves you the immensity
The emptiness of your principles

Smell the ignorance
Impregnated in the leaves of rotten writings
Compassion is your cancer
You will get what is yours

Think - the revenge desire
Poured in the lands of hate
Deep bloody rivers
The abyss of the thought will know how to impose the rules

Fearing death you'll lose the life
Destroy your weaknesses
Instinctive and free from deceiving laws
We washed with blood
We spit in your ignorance

Vomiting truth, we conceal the lie
Face to face, we avenged

Genocidal mind, ambition
Need of power
Over empty minds
Compassion is your cancer
You will have what is yours

The emptiness of your principles

Fearing death you'll lose the life
Destroy your weaknesses
Instinctive and free from deceiving laws
We washed with blood
We spit in your ignorance

Think - the revenge desire
Poured in the lands of hate
Deep bloody rivers
The abyss of the thought
Will know how to impose the rules
