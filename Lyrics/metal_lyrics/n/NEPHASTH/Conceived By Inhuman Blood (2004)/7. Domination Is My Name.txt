Surrounded by the dust of the useless thinking
I vomit impure words for the sake of being
The hate is the way to show the Reality
Impure thought
Impure thought is a principle
Absolute in the name of the lethal instinct

Domination is my name
Tortures make your poor being
Victim of the ignorance

Tormented by the stupid sense of your thought
Without mercy, I annihilate the enemy for the pleasure of the suffering
Soul conceived in the shadows of the past
Strong and immortal as the legacy of my acts

I follow the deepest way in the darkness
Terrifying visions through the eyes of the abomination
Inhuman being revenging rotten souls
Weak servants in the name of the bastard
Crawling for the mental forgiveness

I bring with me - the revenge in the name of the power
I walk in the darkness of your acts
Feeding me with your fears
I am what you fear

From mistakes you learn the truth
Wonder again and you won't reach the impossible
Dominate the underground
And burn the nazarene legend

Surrounded by the dust of the useless thinking
I vomit impure words for the sake of being
The hate is the way to show the Reality
Impure thought
Impure thought is a principle
Absolute in the name of the lethal instinct
