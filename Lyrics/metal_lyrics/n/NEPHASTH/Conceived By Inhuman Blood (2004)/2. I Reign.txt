Acts of obscurity opened a path
To be followed in hate and determination
Breaking your useless beliefs
That brings the fear to you

I wish the blood of my enemies
For my destiny - free of remorse
I run over whatever cross my way
I bring the profane knowledge

I burn, I kill, I reign
I make the sins a weapon
For my desires
For my desires

The shadows clamor a victory
I can get - I want!
Free from stupid laws
I can get - I want!
With my own infernal reason
I can get - I want!

A sinner is who believes in sins
The intolerance guides my destiny
I spread the plague to the one who disturbs me
I can get - I want!

I burn, I kill, I reign

Breaking your useless beliefs
That brings the fear to you

I wish the blood of my enemies
For my destiny - free of remorse
I run over whatever cross my way
I bring the profane knowledge
