Our victory is the result of your extermination
We proclaim revenge to the traitor
We destroy his domains with the anger of the fire
Feel the blade of the hate in your skin

The darkness is allied to us
In the existential abyss of his rotten mind
The intense flames of the blasphemy
Eat away all his weak thoughts

Bloodstained way
Martyrdom of the evil
The supreme truth is above
Of his weak words

The ridiculous faith that you have
Is the support of your weakness
Fear our huge power

We proceeded our days spitting in that legacy
We see his destiny in the eyes of death
Through the damned knowledge
We can reach the impossible

Hate Earth

Of his weak words

The ridiculous faith that you have
Is the support of your weakness
Fear our huge power
Because your misfortune is arriving soon

The darkness is allied to us
In the existential abyss of his rotten mind
The intense flames of the blasphemy
Eat away all his weak thoughts
