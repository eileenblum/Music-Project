Your tears represent my victory
The weight of your conscience
It is the proof of your hypocrisy
You cannot hide behind mediocre acts

Things pass in front of you
There are no deeds that turn important your insignificant life
Disintegrating your presence
See the darkness of your imperfect speech

See the darkness of your imperfect speech
The perfection of your dying end

Your hate supports the shades of my kingdom
Your impure thoughts feed my power

The masks don't secure your safety
Loose them you cannot hide forever
Your servitude will cost you your life
I can laugh at your misfortune

Things pass in front of you
There are no deeds that turn important your insignificant life
Disintegrating your presence
See the darkness of your imperfect speech
