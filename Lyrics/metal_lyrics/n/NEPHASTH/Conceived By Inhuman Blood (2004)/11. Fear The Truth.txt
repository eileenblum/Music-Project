Gloomy realities wallow in blood
They bring visions of abyssal destruction
Wisdom and fury guide acts of hate
Despair of those that fail

Great and feared creature
Revenge - guide the devastation
Burning in a rotten religion
Bastard inheritors of the weak reason

Your eyes will testify the genocide
Rivers of blood will drown your lies
Crawl in the presence of the revenging fire's power
Cursed is our name, Damned is our being

We will triumph without mercy
Squashing false preachings
Our acts get sorted
When your stupid God falters
Cursed is our name, Damned is our being

Lost in the emptiness of your writings
You will fear the truth
Lean on a weak knowledge and
You will die because your ignorance

Cursed is our name, Damned is our being

Carnal and instinctive
True, stronger
To lament false explanations
Ridiculous form of acting

Great and feared creature
Revenge - guide the devastation
Burning in a rotten religion
Bastard inheritors of the weak reason
