The supreme bestial
The dark infinite
Bringing the war of fire and iron
Annihilating your most insignificant principles
Weak creature, false knowledge
Malevolence acts lighting the triumphal flame

Christ crucified again

My hate means revenge
In your domains I will profane your commandments
Guided by the supreme creature
My impure thoughts will crucify your God again

In your domains
Guided by the feared creature
My hate means revenge
In your domains

Your faith will weigh when you provoke my anger
Nailed in pain, bleeding mortal laments
Blasphemies return by force of the wisdom
I follow my destiny plan in blood

In your domains
Guided by the feared creature
My hate means revenge
In your domains

Legacy written in blood
Extinct privilege in the existence
Guilt ones being acclaimed
My impure thoughts will crucify your God again

The supreme bestial
The dark infinite
Bringing the war of fire and iron
Annihilating your most insignificant principles
Weak creature, false knowledge

Guided by the feared being
My hate means revenge
In your domains
