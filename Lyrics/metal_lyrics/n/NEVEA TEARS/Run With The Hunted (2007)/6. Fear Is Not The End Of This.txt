I wish I was better with words, there's something holding me back.
My knees can't stop shaking and I can't stop digging my nails in my thoughts.
I'm left with these frail attempts of becoming a man...hang the weak, only time could help where we need to be.
I won't give up, I won't give in.
You will not see this side of me.
I don't think we can ever call it a win, how can we let it get to this?
Watch me fall and leave everything behind me and I wont let you get the best of me....
I won't give up, I won't give in.
You will not see this side of me.
I won't give up, I won't give in.
Clarity is all I need.
I feel this light envelope me.
Step into the fire with these open arms, I can't stop choking
