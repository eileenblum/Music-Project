God forgive me again, there is nothing I can do.
I woke up today wishing I wasn't breathing.
I'll die with this guilt and beg for better life.
You'll realize your faith was all in me, this is just the beginning...
With so many colors of suffering it still seems so empty.
Do not talk, don't even move.
Before I do something I regret.
Let's take a drive and get the hell out of here.
The faith I had is now my worst nightmare.
You'll realize your faith was all in me.
This is just the beginning.
With so many colors of suffering it still seems so empty.
We're not seeing what we should.
We're not breathing how we should.
Failing to see beyond our tunnel vision, we've lost our own.
I said, I said, I'll say it again.
I'm taken back by you.
I said, I said, and I'll say it again.
I'm so sick of you.
Drawing these borders, you hear no melody.
We've lost our own.
