To hell with this, I wash my hands of this wreck.
Hearts crash and ours crashed.
Dig graves for the kids.
I said I don't hate you anymore, please don't pray.
Everybody see the prize.
No it's not for, not for.
And everybody see the prize.
Know it's not for taking.
She kisses fear like nothing; she would rather live right now.
We can all pray.
Someone please save me.
Listen close, can you hear it now? Slowly creeping behind.
I'm not running anymore.
We're bleeding from our hands.
Every breath that I take, reminds me of you.
And it drives me insane.
All we are, are the odd ones...
