A tattered heart and a selfish boy will hold every second close.
The day when the last call is up begins to sound closer.
Signatures are for the self righteous.
What did I create? I must be asleep.
You move in tones.
You talk in shapes.
I must be asleep.
Waving as I disappear.
I'm better than this, and I' better than you.
This is where you beg for my sorrow.
We should not play the maker; we should hold our breath now.
Signatures are for the self righteous.
What did I create?
I wish this was easier!
I wish this was closer!
I've got nothing left; I'm so tired of all of you.
I want to go back where we came from and stab this city.
Maybe I'm just tired of a "perfect" world that we'll never have.
