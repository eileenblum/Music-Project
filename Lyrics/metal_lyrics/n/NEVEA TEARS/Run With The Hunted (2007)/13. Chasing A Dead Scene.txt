I know you'll slip away for good.
I know we're helpless our future's dead walking down these darkened stairs.
The shadow paints the wall and I'm feeling so ignored.
Show me something outside of the real(reel).
You're so hypnotic showing off to me.
We follow marks; we follow hearts that we know.
And in the end we've no place left to go.
If you care for me to throw blood on the street, it's in my heart so show a thread of life.
Breathing in the dust the powdered air always chokes.
Our new way thinking.
If this is our pride...Well I'm finished.
Show me something outside of the real(reel).
You're so hypnotic showing off to me.
If you care for me to throw blood on the street, it's in my heart so show a thread of life...
Every thing you take from me is every thing I take from you...
