We play these games.
We play these games so much.
And every inch of me is ready to break.
We play these games; now take me for what I am.
'Cause I don't look at you, I see through you.
I can't run without you here.
We gotta light these fires together.
We can burn this whole city down and leave everything behind us because I'm broken.
I don't know why it's hard to care.
We can rule the world tonight; I'm going to give you one last try.
And you said tomorrow will be like new.
You're such a liar, a pretty liar.
There's only few like you.
Don't break, you'll lose it.
Leave everything behind.
My body battles itself, everything gets left behind.
