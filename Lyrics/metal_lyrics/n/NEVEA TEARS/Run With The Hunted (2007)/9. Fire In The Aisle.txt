now I'm left alone, and I'm trapped.
I can't get out.
"Get out right now." I'm going out with a bang, we're making headlines.
And she's got the best grace in town.
Look look at my eyes and tell me I'm fucked.
You know damn well when we make love, you will never learn to walk away, and I don't think we'll make it out alive.
Hearing all these haunting voices, I'm staging acts I've never seen.
All in hopes to relieve us now.
I can't keep going on, and I don't think I like it here...
When will this ever end? Cover your eyes and be buried alive.
I'm due for a miracle and I need to pull myself together.
Our only chance for relief is under our feet, a heavy cry pinches my breath.
Bury your emotions and make it right, tonight's the night we will burn with a fight.
So tell them we're here... and be buried alive.
Living here with all these curses, showing ourselves visions of wealth all in hopes to relieve us now.
Hearing all these haunting voices, staging acts I've never seen.
All in hopes to relieve us now.
