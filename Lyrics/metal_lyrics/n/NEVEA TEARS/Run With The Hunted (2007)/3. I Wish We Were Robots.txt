There's no love left here now.
Try to hold on, but you'll fail every time.
Take a look in my eyes.
It's a violent ballad from the familiar eyes.
We blame ourselves for letting poison spill.
We blame ourselves for the retro suicide...
We're so ugly; we get pleasure in pain.
Beauty will get you fame.
We get punched in the face.
