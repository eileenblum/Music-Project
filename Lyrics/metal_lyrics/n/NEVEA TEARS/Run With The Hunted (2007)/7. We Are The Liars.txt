Blank faces keep me going, always trying always wanting.
Fake lies cut deep.
Pleading for the death of me.
Forgive me for what I did, forgive me for what I'm about to do.
Get a hold now.
I'm done trying to be so perfect.
Take a night with me, I'll show you new things.
Get ready to feel my touch.
Take me away from here.
Make sure to bury my head, so I can't breathe.
You can't make me be what I don't want to be.
Take a night with me, I'll show you new things.
Get ready to feel my touch.
You, you, you.
Versus the truth.
It's my curse.
To live with this guilt.
We are all so ugly, nothing will ever change.
One day it will end.
Everyone will plead and beg.
No one knows what happens next, how can you fear what you don't know.
Controlled by fear and yet we are all so scared.
Rip out this loneliness.
Running frantic from the shadows that hold us.
Character is the only proof.
Proof is the only character....
Cast above shadows
