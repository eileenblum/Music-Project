Wake up your time is now.
Cleanse the finest word begin.
One day we will live like kings.
Am I what you wish you could be?
Let's start a revolution baby, let's start it here right now.
I'm crawling at the lid of my coffin.
Get up off your knees and bow.
I will not beg; it's all in my head.
And I don't want to beg anymore, I can't turn my head like nothing.
It's all just show, your words don't exist.
Get back get back, don't do it.
As we start to dance.
And I will never ever follow footsteps; let's keep the bodies in the bed.
Let's start a revolution baby, let's start it here right now, I'm crawling at the lid of my coffin.
Get up off your knees and bow.
I wish I had another chance to go back and say what I wanted to.
But I can't...heroes only fear what they don't know.
Wipe your face, I'm coming home.
So come and get it, you know you want it.
You're coming back for more you beggar.
You must be dreaming.
