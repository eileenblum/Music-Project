Tonight I've fallen into these wounds of bitterness. Trapt in the moment, 
"You'd be better off without love", drill the time out now. Hold up the 
shards... That make you bleed... I broke this promise... I can feel it my lungs... 
I'm drifting away... The velvets wearing this, I'll celebrate it, I just can't 
prove I'm worth it. You said it, you said it. I'll die of paranoia. Trap the 
life of you. Hold up the shards... That make you bleed... I broke this promise... 
I can feel it in my lungs... I'm drifting away... As you touch the waters edge 
it rippled through my heart, It's drifting away. Hold a crushing beat. A 
promise in a kiss, break the pace, please remove this.
