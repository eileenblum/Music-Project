The pearls will drop at the end of the line every morning. Just a little bit

and turn off the radio. Downtown skies... (Play on our fears) are coming... 
(They knew where the cancer grows) like white horse... Riders are mysterious...

Reach out, a porcelain touch disguised with fingertips below us. Downtown 
skies... are coming... like white horse... riders are mysterious... (Mother of all 
whores, Mourn her, Dressed with pearls, Drunk with the blood of saints, she 
is dead and burning).
