One more letter unreturned. A starless night only delays more and these 
shining blue waters reflect these lights of memories. Drive faster... Maybe we 
can leave the lights behind us... But they're calling to come back... I want to 
come back... (These memories that wake breathing heavily like gold that I 
want) I want to go back... Turn around, turn around, turn around, I want to go 
back... The headlights and close calls, the missed calls. I'm coming back to 
spill the ink, drive faster... Maybe we can leave the lights behind us... But 
they're calling to come back... I want to come back... (These memories that wake 
breathing heavily like gold that I want) I want to go back... I'll write for 
the last time, decide to seal it with a kiss. She falls asleep with lids of 
words at a signing. I never meant to hurt you, I hate your every word.
