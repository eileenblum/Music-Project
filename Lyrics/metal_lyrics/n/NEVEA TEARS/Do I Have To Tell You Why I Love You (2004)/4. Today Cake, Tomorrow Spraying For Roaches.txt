Trace back fingertips of lonely men, and you will discover a certain pinch. 
Realize empty bottles and empty help a better man die slow. Trigger thoughts 
break the silence, and ancient hearts cry alone. I tried to warn you, let's 
put this all to an end. This is war... This is war... Fractions make violins 
worthy (Until we shiver white) Your perfume hides behind the candles breath, 
(Until we shiver white). Fractions make violins worthy and perfume hides 
behind the candles breath. "It's time to cover up, and this time wear your 
makeup like a weapon." We dance in perfect time and I shake when you bleed. 
We dance in perfect time and I shake when you bleed... (Until we shiver white) 
It's time to cover up and wear your makeup like a weapon... (Until we shiver 
white)... We dance in perfect time and I shake when you bleed... And God loves a 
good winner. The crowd is onto us.
