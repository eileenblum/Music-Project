To keep something and never let it change... For somethings will never be the 
same ever again... ever again... Hell, am I right? Am I everything? Shut your 
mouth and shut your eyes. I'm the cause of a rape scene. "Does it feel 
good?" It puts a smile on her face. Where lovely and loneliness is just 
another word. To keep something and never let it change... For somethings will 
never be the same ever again... ever again... Hell, am I right? Am I everything, 
shut your mouth and shit your eyes. I'm the cause of a rape scene. "Does it 
feel good?" It puts a smile on her face. Where lovely and loneliness is just 
another word. Until we shiver white, two sips belong for love. The pins form 
tight and fall in love with the sound. To keep something and never let it 
change... For somethings will never be the same ever again... ever again... I can 
read her lops as she says to me... It is so real... It is so surreal...
