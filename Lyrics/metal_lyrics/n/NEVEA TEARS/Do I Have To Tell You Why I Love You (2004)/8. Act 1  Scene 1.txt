Glamour stars sail with the worst collapsing habits. Lets let the cameras 
roll and get lovesick and drown in the glory... Arr you listening?... Can you 
hear me?... Do you see the way she's dressed tonight?... Turn it up like a 
virgin... Tonight we are going to pray for light... Lashes, motions move the 
teacher. I'm the best thing that you've ever had. Glamour stars sail with 
the worst collapsing habits. Lets let the cameras roll and get lovesick and 
drown in the glory. Lashes, motions move the teacher.
