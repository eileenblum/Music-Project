Lets start the first verse with who do you think you are? Lights of 
admiration... I drag my heels off to bed. These words roll of my tongue so 
easy, like it was already written. I create music for the insane. Let's sing 
in tune 'till notes fall young. We built the roads for you to walk on, and 
we knew you would hate this. Design these walls with a thousand words. I 
heard a voice speak against the heavy. Oh, I saw a miracle once. All I want 
to do is lay. Rejoice in the upbringing of this fantasy... Fall on your knees... 
Drop your flag and run... Let's start the third verse, with who do you think 
you are? Lights of admiration... I drag my heels off to bed. We built the 
roads for you to walk on, and we knew you hate this. Design these walls with 
pages of a thousand words. Accept it, instead of believing these fairy 
tales... Drop it... Shove it... We've tried, but our throats are bloody... We can't 
swallow anymore, but it doesn't matter... You'll be pretty down south sipping 
coffee... I'm hoping I never have to write this song again, and God save the 
Queen. I live my life to learn to hate, bastards fight freely.
