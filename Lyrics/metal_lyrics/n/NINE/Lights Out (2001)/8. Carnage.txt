I saw it coming, I saw it clear.
Itried to tell you but you just didn't care.
You saw it coming, you saw it clear.
I tried to warn you but you just didn't dare.
I didn't wanna be the one to tell you "I told you so..."
I told you so...
Never had to speak my mind, but now I do.
I have to do.
The more I know, the less i wanna be the one.
The one who picks you up.
The more I know, the less I wanna be the one
who saves you from it all.

You spend your time on what you own,
I bid my time on what you've thrown.
But in the end, they own you.
You had it set out.
You had it all.
The more you get the harder you fall.
And when it's over
and after all,
am I the only one standing tall?
