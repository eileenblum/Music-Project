They made their moves again.
And drew the lines in front of my eyes.
And all the rules are set so there is nothing in their way.
But still the wolves want more.
But what they want they don't know for sure.
It's the reason not the meaning that's the engine.
And they never will slow down.

I can't believe what I heard today.
I cannnot get, what you had to say.
I can't believe what I heard today
And I will never ever walk you way.

So what is the purpose for you?
What is the goal?
It's something that we never caught
and it's something they will never do.
Aiming in the same direction but using different arms.
Maybe seeing through different windows
we could make a different after all.

Why can't you get it?
I have some good advice for you
Why can't you take it?
It's there in front of you.
There is no option but to read between the lines.
