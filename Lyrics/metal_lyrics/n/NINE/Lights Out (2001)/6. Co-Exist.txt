Building bridges to watch them burn.
As past experience
reflects ourselves.
To make diamonds out of stone.
To change what we hear into knowledge.
To make diamonds out of stone.
To make something of what we've known.

Time for me doesn't mean true for you.
There are no true blue.
There are no true.
When truth don't exist we can interact with each other.
To create opportunities to co-exist.

It will take a whole lot of medicine
to mend illusions of something clean.
To make diamonds of stone.
To twist it into our own.
To make diamonds out of stone.
To make something of what we've known.
