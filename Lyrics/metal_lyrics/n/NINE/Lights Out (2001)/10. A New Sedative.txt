Come on in, take a moment.
Better take a break.
In need of slowing down.
Live it out, don't be afraid now.
Take it as it comes.
And feel the emptiness.

It is something that will rise.
And it's something that will take away.

No one can take it away from you.
No one can ever break you down.
Keep it in, holding on now.
It's how it's meant to be.
And nothing is too strange.
Take one breath, take one more now.
Wait now for the flow.
And let it rise and grow.
