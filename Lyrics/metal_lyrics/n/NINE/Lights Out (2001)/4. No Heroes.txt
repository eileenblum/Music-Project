Just another day.
Pulling the ropes round tightly.
Just go the directed way
and slip there neat and nicely.
It's about time to lift up your head and take a look around.
A grey mind, a grey world.
There's no heroes to be found.

All stakes aside.
Look out! Here it comes.
Been on hold for too long better move on.
All bets are high.
Look out! Here it comes.
If you took the first step, you could be the one.

Just get back in line
and maintain effective.
You just spend your time
being well productive.
It's about time to open your eyes and see where you have gone.
A grey mind, a grey world.
Conquer it and you could be the one.
