Just too many thoughts in my head.
I need a place to call my own.
Just too many of those days hanging by the telephone.
And as we said we will never die...
And now I'm feeling the dying.
Isn't it so that the truth really hurts?
Maybe it's why we keep on lying...

Again and again.

I wanna go back.
I wanna go back there.
I wanna go back.
Wanna go back there now.

Trust each other as we trust ourselves.
Another reason to dig up bones.
Building up a palace of glass.
I find myself throwing stones.
Picking old wounds until they bleed
is the main theme that we use.
Shining bright in the same old shoes.
There's no ignition without a fuse.
