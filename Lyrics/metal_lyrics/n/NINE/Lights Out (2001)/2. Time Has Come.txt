Open yor eyes wide now and face your deepest fear.
What's not supposed to happen is getting closer and closer here.
Breaking the silence, death from above, roaring engines cry.
Looking with bloodstained eyes at the backened sky.
Do your last rites, pray to your gods and hope that they can hear you.
Ask for forgiveness, give it all in, there's nothing left to do.

It's time to...
Time has come to take a final breath.
Sooner than we know we`re passed the gates of death.
Blinded by the fire burning in the sky.
No turning back: Time has come to die.

You just hold still now and wait till the damage is done.
Raging in panic, boiling in veins, waiting for the end to come.
Breaking the silence, death from above, roaring engines cry.
Looking with bloodstained eyes at the backened sky.
