You can't trust no one, trust me.
Never again I said to myself.
Ialways end up last in line.
Never getting back on track.

I don't wanna live this life no more.
Killing time is such a bore.
I don't wanna live this life no more.
No more.

Staring at the same four walls.
I never thought it would come to this.
How did I get here anyway?
I am the repeater, but cannot stay.
