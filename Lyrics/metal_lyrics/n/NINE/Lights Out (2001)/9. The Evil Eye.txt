Put your dress on, it's time for action.
Satnd up straight in line.
You know the drill, you've done it before.
So many times.
Point out the problems and find the solution.
Destroy everything that comes you way.
I see the walls grow higher and higher.
But I can't still figure it out, come on.

Waiting for the fall, taking it all away.
Burning for the fight, never got it right, no way.

Raise your flag and keep your fists high.
This is what you've waited fot.
I've said it a thousand times.
But still I can't get through.
All I know is that you're running in circles.
Caught in your ownold traps.
Burning for the fight and not the cause.
I see the walls grow higher and higher.
The evil eye grows wider and wider.
