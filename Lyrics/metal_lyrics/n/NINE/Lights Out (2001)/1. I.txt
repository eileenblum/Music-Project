You said that you trust no one, because you've been let down.
Most peo`ple hurt you, burn you, use you.
And they who don't they are grey.
And you told me that you don't care much for the world outside the window.
I know it isn't easy.

So Come on.
I know that you are bleeding.
Ican see that you are dying.
And nothing will give in.
Is there no salvation?
Is there no solution?
No one will give in.

And you told me that it`s hard to live when everything is empty.
I know it isn't easy.

Come on let's burn.
You cannot hide.
Don't let the demons come inside.
(I'll live, you'll die, we'll burn the lie)
