Today would have been our demise
If we turned thirty-three
As the prophets all said:
We made our choice
As if we ever had a choice to make
Nailed down to our hands

How much will it take to change?
And where do we draw the line?
Show me the way out of here
On our deathbed:
Regrets

Created our mold
Bored and misled
Gathering dust with far too much that sink in
Nothing ever goes away
Everyday is just the same
And the choice we are left with
It's the only one we got
Is what we should wear to our funeral

I wanted my own
Time
And time again
Now more than ever

Fade away
