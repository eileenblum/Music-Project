In these empty streets...
Now this place gives me nothing
Still it's all I've got
There's nothing that can save me now
And it feels like I'm buried alive

Now I'm sad to say
I'm leaving it all behind today
Not going back this time
It's all been seen before
I cannot stay here anymore
No regrets this time

The walls are closing in
I used to call this home
Choking, empty hollow souls
There's nothing that can save me now
No direction or no hope
You know I gave it all
I had to push it too
To the limit
It's not enough
There's nothing that can save me now
And it feels like
Goodbye
This is my last goodbye
