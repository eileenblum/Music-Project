I tried to put it behind but it just keep coming back
And I've done all that's possible
I can't keep up
And when I've done all that I can
And there's nothing left to do
I pick it up with my bloody hands
Even though I know that I can't win
Butï¿½?ï¿½

With empty hands now I have nothing
The time right, the time is now
And I will rise
I conquer it all and take everything
Taste the darkness that I bring
The time is now

And every now and then I think that I'm really close
To get what I'm looking for
To get what I really want
But then there's always something
To remind me over and over again
That it's not worth fighting for
But still I try to

I try to find things to make it easier
I try to find all those things
I gotta have something to keep me up for just another day

There's always something there
Another day, another lie
