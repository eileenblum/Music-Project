Are you down?
So down?
Slow down cuz it won't get no good
Low?
So low?
I know it can only get worse from here
It turns black from grey
There's no way of getting up now
Now when you are down
Cuz you see
I've got some news for you

There is no way of getting up
And this road will only take you to the end

So come on
It's done
No one is going to help you
And I
I lie
Yes I'd do it again
One thing you know will be there
Is your darkest fear
And now it's time for you to do what's right to do

It's just the way it's meant to be
There is no light at the end to see

Everyday is one step closer
Everyday is one step further down
And do you know where we all are going?
You follow me to the end of the road where we die
