With open arms
I embrace my executioner
With a smile on my face
I welcome you
My last breath
I beyond the point of fear
Cuz I've been afraid too many times
And when the watching crowd fall silent
I feel alive for the very first time

I am breathing
And I'm feeling
At least it's something
Compared to nothing

These few last seconds that I've got
And you know
That I'd be nothing without you
This is the time that's only mine
And I know
I want this to last forever

And I can see their eyes
From that moment
It felt like time stood still
They decided
They reminded me
That life is far too short
And I'm twisting and turning
The whole world is burning
Set me free
I stand in line for the very first time
Come
Take me away
