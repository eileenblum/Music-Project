Kneel down and prey
Innocence is gone
Choking on the ashes
Buried in debris
Drowning in a pool of blood
Cities in decay
Nothing left alive
This is the strategy of fear

When it all comes down to dust
Alone with no one to trust
We're standing on the edge of ruin
All we can do isï¿½?ï¿½

An empty sky
Where birds won't fly
The world is caving in
Everything is left in ruins
Empty cavity
And the ground is crumbling
A strategy of fear
The strategy of fear
