I can't remember when all of this began
It seems so long ago
Nothing changes I know
I thought that I had the world in my hand
It slipped through my fingers
And I thought that I could believe again
But I know
I know

Our days are running out
The voices still scream
To let us know it's time to die
Over and over again

And then I realized as I fell to my knees
That all this time I was caught in the middle
And I couldn't see
See through the lies through my bloodshed eyes
And all that I know is that life is bringing me down

As I reach the end of the rope (over and over again)
And I'm running out of hope (over and over again)
I get more and more out of touch
I lose my faith and await to die
