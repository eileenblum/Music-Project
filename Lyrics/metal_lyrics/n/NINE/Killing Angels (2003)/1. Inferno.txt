The clouds look black tonight
My will to redeem in spite
My thoughts look pitchblack tonight
To follow me on a journey inside
To climb down all the stairs where
The bad is divided from the good
And the crime of being me
Makes me burn forever

Set it all in flames
If this is heaven no angels sing
The clouds look black tonight

As I kill my leader, I kill my shadow
And I will be suffering
Until I see where I'm wrong, if I am wrong
If there is no right, there is no wrong
To be stuck in the middle is even worse
Your inferno isn't worse than mine

You tell me you know what I feel
Stop using me as an excuse for being you
When I look up I see your grin
The satisfaction of kicking me down

Set it all in flames
If this is heaven no angels sing
The clouds look black tonight
If this is hell no fire burns
Set it all in flames
If this is heaven no angels sing
My thoughts look black tonight
If this is hell no fire burns
