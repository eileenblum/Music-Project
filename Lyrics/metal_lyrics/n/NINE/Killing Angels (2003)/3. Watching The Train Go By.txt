I thought I could here you
When I was standing on the ledge
Watching the train go by
I'm leaving you all alone
Hope made me paranoid
We must take the leap
So take my hand
Lets meet the time up ahead
Something's always waiting

Let's not wait for the future to knock on our door
To do what we can do now and not tomorrow
Let's cut into the flesh of our own
Just to see what we're made of
Watching the train go by
As I throw you a kiss on my way down

The angel is singing in my ear
That I should be content
With knowing that every battle we fight
Is a battle we know we can't win
There are no battles to fight
No voices to be heard
We're running into walls
Just to see what will happen if we try

So take my hand, the unknown is waiting
Something's always waiting

Another train's passing
Another day that's gone by
