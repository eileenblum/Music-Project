I
I don't believe in the same things I used to do
But I`ve got nothing new
Cuz everything is constantly changing and moving ahead of me
Too much of those grey days
To much of those things I`ve seen before
It`s all the same to me
And I cant believe that I`m still in these shoes
Will I keep them til the end?

The day before the day
Blackout, Blackout
I can`t climb any higher
I`m about to explode

And now
Whats left for me to do?
I`m running out of alternatives
Nothing left to use
But Iï¿½ve come down to only two things
And using this exit is one of them
Too much of this darkness
Too much of this shit
I know it all to well
Just to get me through the day
I can`t believe that I`m asking the same old
Question
Again and Again

The day before the day

I keep running
Keep running
Trying to run away
Running away from the end

The day before the day...
