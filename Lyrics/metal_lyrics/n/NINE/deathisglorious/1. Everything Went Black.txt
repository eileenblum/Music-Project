When these wounds were the only thing for me to
Keep
Everything went black
This river of blood is seeping from my open sores
Everything went black
Nothing to bring me the light
Why?
Everything went black

Give me a razor
I`ll give you the truth
Nothing could bury the lies
And I
I will show the way down

How many are these temporary breath before
Everything turns black?
Nothing to bring me the light
Why?
Everything turns black

Give me a razor...

Turning the lifesupport system off
If it means taking you down with me

Death is glorious
