[Music: Cioffi; lyrics: Scrima]

In their foolish greedy the men of sunny shires
moved war against the forest. And nature in a while
rose against the warriors, against the ambition
so they were damned in a final kingdom of dark infinity

Last exile, everlasting time, damned for

Everlasting time, in change of all the wasted hours
Everlasting time, in ransom of the crashed towers
Everlasting time, in memory of trees and flowers
Everlasting time, to gain the prize for all survivors

Shade, no shade of doubt, no shade like ancestral blade
Blade, the blade of light in the dark canât penetrate
Run, as fast they run, the sun will fade away
Dark, as dark is stark, is hard to see the way

Last exile, everlasting time, damned for

Everlasting time, in change of all the wasted hours
Everlasting time, in ransom of the crashed towers
Everlasting time, in memory of trees and flowers
Everlasting time, to gain the prize for all survivors
