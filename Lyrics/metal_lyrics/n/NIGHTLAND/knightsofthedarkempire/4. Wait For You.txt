[Music: Cioffi, Scrima; lyrics: Brualdi]

I close my eyes and I see your face,
I feel your touch, your warm fucking embrace,
I always hear your voice away so far
then I realize that you're not here to hold me tight

Something in your eyes made me trust in you,
even if you're gone I know what I will do

I'll wait for you 
until the morning comes
Today everyday 
I can't take you off my mind

Staring at the skies above I see you through,
every day and every night I think of you

I remember the time we spent together,
you taught me what love is and you said it was me

I'll wait for you 
until the morning comes
Today everyday 
I can't take you off my mind
