[feat. Veronica Brualdi][Music: Cioffi, Scrima; lyrics: Brualdi]

I close my eyes and i see your face
I feel your touch, your warm embrace
I always hear your voice away so far
Then I realize that you're not here to hold me tight

Something in your eyes made me trust in you
Even if you're gone I know what I will do

I'll wait for you
until the morning comes
Today everyday
I can't take you off my mind

Staring at the skies above I see you through
Every day and every night I think of you

I remember the time we spent together
You taught me what love is and you said it was me

I'll wait for you
until the morning comes
Today everyday
I can't take you off my mind
