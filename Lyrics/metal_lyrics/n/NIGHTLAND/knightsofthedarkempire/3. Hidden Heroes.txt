[Music and lyrics: Scrima]

There was a time when mountains mountains were young,
the sun shone brightly on this raising land,
the river dived in white waterfalls.
Hidden heroes!

That was the time of the rhyme and the song,
a man was valued upon his own bravery.
And pride and glory were the masters to serve,
hidden heroes!
Save the gloryâ¦

For hidden heroes the sun will never shine anymore
For hidden heroes no light in the night evermore 
For hidden heroes the sun will never shine anymore
For hidden heroes!

The lifeâs adversities the one daily bread,
hunting and hunger: the lesson to learn.
A sacrifice, the gift for a friend,
hidden heroes!

No more oblivion for the humble in heart,
bless for the heaven and for distant stars.
A rising hymn coming from earth,
hidden heroes!
Save the gloryâ¦

For hidden heroes the sun will never shine anymore
For hidden heroes no light in the night evermore 
For hidden heroes the sun will never shine anymore
For hidden heroes!
For hidden heroes!
For hidden heroes!
For hidden heroes!
For hidden heroes!
