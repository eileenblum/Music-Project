[Music, lyrics, arrangements: Cioffi]

Crushed by the weight of time
The fragile hope lives on
In an emptiness to be filled
In an answer to be found
But winter never ends
Where sun rays canât get through
Light cannot reach the heart
That canât fight on

Dust in the eyes of a faithless mind
That fills with emptiness its dreamless life

I canât remember the warmth of a memory
The sweet and fleeting sensation of an instant
That enlightened my days

I know the shudder of pain
The deep wound that you left
When I lost your affection
So needed, so cruel

Dust in the eyes of a faithless mind
That fills with emptiness its dreamless life
