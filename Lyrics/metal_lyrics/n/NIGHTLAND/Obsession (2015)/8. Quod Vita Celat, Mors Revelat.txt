[Music, lyrics, arrangements: Cioffi]

Search, man, search within your feelings
But donât look for what you cannot find
What was life, now is death
What was everything, now is nothing

You're following a shadow, a fleeting thought,
A choice that you cannot make anymore

Don't hold on to a dream believing to fly
'Cause falling is the only way you can cross the sky

Search, man, search in your past
You will harvest what you have sown
The mistakes you weren't able to avoid
Are a stain that you cannot remove

Damnatus sit tuus cor in tenebris
Malum te dominat

Search, man, search deep down
To unearth the dreary abyss that deserve
The soiled essence of your ego
To preserve the world from it's atrocity

You're following a shadow, a fleeting thought,
A choice that you cannot make anymore

Don't hold on to a dream believing to fly
'Cause falling is the only way you can cross the sky

Damnatus sit tuus cor in tenebris
Malum te dominat
Damnatus sit tuus cor in tenebris
Malum te dominat
Quod vita celat, mors revelat
