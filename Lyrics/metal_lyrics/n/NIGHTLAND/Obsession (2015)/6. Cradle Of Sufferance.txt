[Music, lyrics, arrangements: Cioffi]

Yearning for new life
So gentle and feeble
Youâre innate will of procreation
A cruel conviction to pain
You will never see the light

Death impending before that life starts
As a nightmare coming before you close your eyes
No redemption for the cold soul of a sinner
When the sinner is mother of an impure desire

Night falls hiding the smile of a red moon
That has seen this unholy madness
Filling with emptiness her cradle of sufferance

Evil can be only the son of evil
Whatâs born from a corrupted will
Deserve not merciful hate
But the cruel illusion of love

Nightmare coming before you close your eyes
No redemption for the cold soul of a sinner
When the sinner is mother of an impure desire

Night falls hiding the smile of a red moon
That has seen this unholy madness
Filling with emptiness her cradle of sufferance
Night falls hiding the smile of a red moon
That has seen this unholy madness
Filling with emptiness her cradle of sufferance

Death impending before that life starts
As a nightmare coming before you close your eyes
No redemption for the cold soul of a sinner
When the sinner is mother of an impure desire

Night falls hiding the smile of a red moon
That has seen this unholy madness
Filling with emptiness her cradle of sufferance
