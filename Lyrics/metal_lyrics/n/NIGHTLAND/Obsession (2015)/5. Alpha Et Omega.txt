[Music, lyrics, arrangements: Cioffi]

I bend my will to your immense power,
Divine and eternal abstraction
I annihilate my reason to your law,
Thou are all-powerful and almighty

I free myself from the chains of my egoism
To submit myself forever
To the freedom of your realm,
Thou are the truth above all reason

Sum Alpha, sum Omega

Feed our hopes with the cruel illusion
Of an eternal life for the worthy souls,
Your word is absolute truth
'Cause when we are blind, you are the eyes

Sum Alpha, sum Omega

Bound in resignation to an unknown sorrow
Wait to understand the meaning of such pain
You cannot understand the root of your evil
'Cause you have proclaimed it as your savior

Bound in faith for a sacred morality
You follow a path bordered by dogma,
While uttering tolerance and freedom
You grant devotion and slavery

Bend your will to my immense power
Fragile and mortal preachers
Annihilate your reason to my law
'Cause Iâm all-powerful and almighty

Sum Alpha, sum Omega
Es Alpha, es Omega
