[Music, lyrics, arrangements: Cioffi]

Fly, man of flesh and blood,
Fly on the winds of reason
Until the fall of your courage
Until a new journey begins

Leave your prison flying higher
Donât look down to this failing world
Take a new breath as a free man
In your new world, Icarus!

Find a new sunrise over the horizon
Donât let the sun go down
Do not let the sun go down!

Leave your prison flying higher
Donât look down to this failing world
Take a new breath as a free man
In your new world, Icarus!

Fly, man of dreams and desire,
Fly on the winds of folly
Down to the depths of your soul
To restrain the whole universe

Leave your prison flying higher
Donât look down to this failing world
Take a new breath as a free man
In your new world, Icarus!
