[Music: Scrima; lyrics, arrangements: Cioffi]

Itâs not honor that guides a man to war
Not fear to make him blind
Not love to bind his heart
Not faith to make it blind

Like a cancer my perversion grows
In the shadows

Obscure temptation, eternal illusion
Grow, my obsession, deprive all reason from me

Itâs not night that obscures daylight
Not death that takes away life

My most sweet dreams you have transformed them into pain

Obscure temptation, eternal illusion
Grow, my obsession, deprive all reason from me
