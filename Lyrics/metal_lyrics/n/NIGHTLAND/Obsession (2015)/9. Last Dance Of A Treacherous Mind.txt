[Music, lyrics, arrangements: Cioffi]

Letâs begin this last dance all around this madness
Iâm a bringer of death, sufferance and pain
Due to awake the fallen ones
Calling their forces to end this time of emptiness

Rise alone at the end of the world
When the evil has come
And your mighty forces reborn
Rise again on the wasted land
When the thunder will cry
In this last dance of a treacherous mind

A candle in the night, the evil in your mind
Eating from inside and darkening your light
Will fade to shadows and fall by my hand
Becoming dust forever and ever

Rise again on the wasted land
When the thunder will cry
In this last dance of a treacherous mind

Letâs begin this last dance all around this madness
Iâm a bringer of life, power and domain
Due to awake the fallen ones
And leading their spirits to end this time of emptiness

Rise alone at the end of the world
When the evil has come
And your mighty forces reborn
Rise again on the wasted land
When the thunder will cry
In this last dance of a treacherous mind
