[Adnihilo Rationem, Ergo Sum][Music, lyrics, arrangements: Cioffi]

There is no God above my will
Since will generates power
As the reason induces folly

There is no king ruling this world
There is no man ruling his mind
âcause it belongs to me

Ancient son of dark, titan of my madness
Mighty silent presence, lead my lonely spirit into war

Creatures nourished by illusions
You kill for the earth, ignoring the heavens
You think youâre sun in the cosmic darkness
But darkness is destiny of every light

Ancient son of dark, titan of my madness
Mighty silent presence, lead my lonely spirit into war

Youâre not allowed to control the world
if you cannot control yourself

My power threatens at the epilogue of evolution
âcause every war that will be won
will be a part of sanity lost

There is no king ruling this world
There is no man ruling his mind
âcause it belongs to me

Ancient son of dark, titan of my madness
Mighty silent presence, lead my lonely spirit into war
