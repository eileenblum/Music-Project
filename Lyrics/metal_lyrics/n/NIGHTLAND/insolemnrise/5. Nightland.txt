[Music, lyrics: Cioffi]

Open your eyes, look at the world,
ainât it perfect as the life seems to be?
Turn the lights off, realise the truth:
there is smell of blood!

Gold-fingered kings in a circle of fire
have burned the secrets of an unholy spell.
But thereâs a place where the myst is still alive
and the magic has never fallen!

Lâempia realtÃ  risorge.
Bianca luna, domina!

Dragons fly on the dark lands of the night,
at the end of the time, in the never ending skies!

Full of corruption, within destruction,
the power of mankind has blackened the wisdom.
Praying for salvation in their superstition,
the men are gonna lose their mind!

Black knights are coming with magical powers,
fighting the blood-painted angels of light.
Join the evils of the darkest lands,
be one of us, or be damned!

Buie realtÃ  svelano
veritÃ  mistiche.

Dragons fly on the dark lands of the night,
at the end of the time, in the never ending skies!
