[Music, lyrics: Cioffi]

All alone in the darkness I reclaim my old forces
for rebuilding new legions, for preparing my war
Fine is the sound of my winning, near is the time of my rising!
Fear, no more leading my spirit, dying I will consume my prison

Powerful energies, dark allies of dreams
Soulprison from grace, fall in pain!

Please, Master, will you take me?
There is no future for you in here!
Iâm holding on all my dreams!
Take leave your soul, you are losing grip!

Now Iâm ready for fighting, the black army is awake
for embracing the weapons, for unleashing his violence
Raise and kill, and show no mercy, no remission for every sinner!
Donât forget, the struggle is inside, defend your soul from your hatred!

Powerful energies, dark allies of dreams
Soulprison from grace, fall in pain!

âTiranno Ã¨ il destino a cui Ã¨ piegato
lâeroe in quella prigione contrito
in cui Natura lâha condannato
seppur divino, come umano, smarrito.â

Powerful energies, dark allies of dreams
Soulprison from grace, fall in pain!

Carry on and fight along, bound to your fate
Immortal death master, lead your rage!
Carry on and fight along, bound to your fate
Eternal free spirit, leave your cage!

Leave this soulprison of pain!
