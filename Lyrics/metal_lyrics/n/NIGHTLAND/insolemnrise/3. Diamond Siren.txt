[Music, lyrics: Cioffi]

No more daylight in my lonely hours
Sinners in this kingdom are not to forgive
âRound the blackened earth trees of pain have burned
Can see no way out of my final call

Eternal power, mystical wonder
Unholy symphony of the rising chant of mighty
Diamond siren, strong like a mountain
Bright as the moonlight in the night

The spell of merciless pain
talks about a crystal bell in the rain
The sirenâs last words
can save me from this fate

When time has come wait for the end
I'm leaving from this tragic dream
Please, magic creature take me out
of this unholy eternity

Eternal power, mystical wonder
Unholy symphony of the rising chant of mighty
Diamond siren, strong like a mountain
Bright as the moonlight in the night
