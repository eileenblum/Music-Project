[Music, lyrics: Cioffi]

Down through the lands of the ice,
over the seas and winds of the north,
riding the waves of the fear,
knights of the enemy lands will invade

Heroes are coming back
moving the hymns to the moon.
White stars, our friends,
look for the gods of the war!

Thereâs nothing that heroes canât do,
the stars and the moon are upon this brave heart.
Their rise will bend the fate of these lands.

Ride
Over the enchanted woods
Over the lakes of the blood
Over the pride of our life
in solemn rise!

Hearing the roars of the thunder
I see the dead men crashed on the ground.
Angels of death now are raiding,
enemy falls in the reign of god Er

Growing fear is ruling while the invaders attack,
the keepers of the time are going to decide the end

Ride
Over the enchanted woods
Over the lakes of the blood
Over the pride of our life
in solemn rise!
