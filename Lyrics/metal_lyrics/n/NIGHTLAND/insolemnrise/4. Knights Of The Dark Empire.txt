[Music, lyrics: Cioffi]

In a time of despair, no hope left, no more time to lie
On the way of the fallen, need an aim to awake and raise again

âThe power of an immortal spirit never loses his way
Your aim is you life, your enemies: your blind eyes.â¨Find again your force, brave knight!â

Where is your daring, where is your pride?â¨in this time of despair, shall be brave, shall be allied!
Trusting the fate and awakening to die
Youâre the knights, the knights of the dark empire!

I know my quest is hard, and forever Iâll pray
My time has come to die, disclaiming my soul and my name

One more long travel is left, one more plan in my dreams
Iâll do the best in my time, before the bell starts to chime

âOnly the best can look inside their deep souls, â¨a frozen mind should blacken all the hopes leftâ¦â¨But the burning heart of the hero has found his way again!â

Here is our daring, here is our pride!â¨in this time of despair, shall be brave, shall be allied!
Trusting the fate and awakening to die
Weâre the knights, the knights of the dark empire!
