In the coldest embrace of dusk
I drown the rays of daylight
The suns, gathered in void, implode and reappear as novas
Thence the mask of night can't cover the embers of ardor
And my will of control and dominion lasts through joy and pain
I'm above the oceans of time
Father of timeless nights
Amongst the blackening skies
I am the light
In the silent whisper of night
I seal the eyes of desire
The Never filleth the hearts of dreamers enchained in pleasure
So the lack of feelings will weaken the planets' attraction
And the apathy will dip the shapes into the formless
I'm above the oceans of time
Father of timeless nights
Amongst the blackening skies
I am the light
May my solemn word be law
So I can see the emptiness and refill it with fullness
May my brightest light be unleashed at the end of time
So I can shine like a million suns, and be the
One above all
In the sweetest kiss of dawn
I devour the shadows of madness
The stars fade behind the veil of the purest Aurora
Thus the rays of Sun can't bare the blasphemous secrets
That howl, fearless, against the loudest of the thunders
I'm above the oceans of time
Father of timeless nights
Amongst the blackening skies I am the light
Above the oceans, beyond the shadows
I am the light amongst the blackening skies!
