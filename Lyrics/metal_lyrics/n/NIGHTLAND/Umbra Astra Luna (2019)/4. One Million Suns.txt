Once the craving of gnosis leadeth me
To the darkest side of the truths
The bloodstained flowers of passion
Will bloom from the wintry soil of reasoning
Where all my fears can't revive
Within the blackened sky
Never ever will the night
Hide and veil the eternal light
Of a million suns
Within the blackened sky
Never ever be the time
Fading your brightest side
With a million suns
Once the dreaming of a perfect creature
Made out of comets and stardust
Enlighteneth the utter black amongst the galaxies
I'll feel the weakness of mortality
The guilt of being almighty
The endless beyond time
Then all my fears will revive
Within the blackened sky
Never ever will the night
Hide and veil the eternal light
Of a million suns
Within the blackened sky
Never ever be the time
Fading your brightest side
With a million suns
The guilt of being almighty
The endless beyond time
Within the blackened sky
Never ever will the night
Hide and veil the eternal light
Of a million suns
Within the blackened sky
Never ever be the time
Fading your brightest side
With a million suns
Never will the time veil the eternal light
Of a million suns
