ANIMUS HOMINUM CELAT ET VIVIT IN TENEBRIS VERITAS HOMINUM MORITUR IN PERPETUUM
Lone, in the sea of awareness
I sail, fearless
Worshiped by existence, blown by
Ego's winds
Like the colorless summer
Without the glance of a shy dawn
Chasing the warmth in a spark
Drowned in the void of the utter dark
Lone, through the clouds of unknown
I fly in stillness
Dethroned by weakness, swept by the winds of love
No! The colorless summer
Burst in her shy dawn
Breaking the silence of Night
And turning her void in a supreme light
ANIMUS HOMINUM CELAT ET VIVIT IN TENEBRIS VERITAS HOMINUM MORITUR IN PERPETUUM
No! The colorless summer burst in her shy dawn
Breaking the silence of Night and turning in a supreme light
