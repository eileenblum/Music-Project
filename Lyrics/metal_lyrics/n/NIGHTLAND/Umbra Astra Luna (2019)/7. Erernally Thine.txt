In the euphoric dance of blackening
I spread the seed of madness
Betraying creation
I desecrate the empiric wisdom
O brothers of Merak, deny your temple and let Ursa fall
Into the deepest whirl of coldness that
Cosmos had ever known
Leave the essence for the absence
Let Her light fill the oceans of loneliness
Whispers in torment spread a word of lunacy
Whispers in silence blow horns of tragedy
Everything is cold, no sound breaking this silence
Nor breath, but shivering flowers wither their last spring
Where's Thy warmth?
Thy enchanting rays of pleasure
That made the whole universe fall into the abyss of love?
Thy brightness, my light, at the unison fade
Thy mystic essence, suddenly unveils
Whispers in torment spread a word of lunacy
Whispers in silence blow horns of tragedy
May my profane word be kept for my last breath
So I can forget the fullness and be reborn to learn from all the emptiness
May Thy lunar paleness be revealed at the end of time
So I can shine on
Thee with a million suns, and be eternally, Thine!
In the blackest lack of feelings
I feed the flame of passion
And burn in the coldest Winter that
Cosmos had ever known
Thy brightness, my light, at the unison rise
Whispers in torment spread a word of lunacy
Whispers in silence
Bind my name to Thee, forevermore
