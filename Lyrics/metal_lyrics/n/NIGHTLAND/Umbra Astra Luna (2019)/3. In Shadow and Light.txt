A LUCE TENEBRAE, A NOCTE AETERNUM
When the new cosmic order
Came through the ashes of Genesis
And the sons of Antares spread the red flame
And profaned the galactic seed
I was there, before time,
Before gods of creation
To redraw the laws of perfection,
And refill the void of ambitions
When the great Mother spawned
On the phantasmic soil of disgrace
And her breast fed humanity
With sin and lies
I was there, before time,
As in shadow so in light!
UMBRA â I wonder in silence
ASTRA â if I owned the power
LUNA â to howl in this night
Of shadow and light
When the gods of the prophetic Eye
Raised the tower of abomination
Cain's descent spat on their own blood
And drank it in centuries of joy"
Let us embrace, in blindness and faith"
They spoke, "in torment and pleasure"
When Y'all feasted on the weakness of men
Yet craved their mortality
I was there, before time,
As in shadow so in light!
UMBRA â I wonder in silence
ASTRA â if I owned the power
LUNA â to howl in this night
Of shadow and light
UMBRA â I wonder in silence
ASTRA â if I owned the power
LUNA â to keep you at my side
In shadow and light
A LUCE TENEBRAE, A NOCTE AETERNUM
UMBRA â I wonder in silence
ASTRA â if I owned the power
LUNA â to howl in this night
Of shadow and light
A LUCE TENEBRAE, A NOCTE AETERNUM
