Like the Never, who liveth above time
I fed the flame of the
Universe's fire
To design a new cosmic geometry
On the likeness of a divine morality
My light, my sway
Like the Awareness, who standeth before life
Now I behold Thee shining, soaring high bright
To elevate the whole Firmament's symmetry
Above the stars of Boreal sky
O Sirius!
Fade thy light to me unto the utter naught
I, the Suns, warden of lightness
I, the Fire, unto the nothingness
O Vega, Deneb and Altair,
Embrace the abyss and weaken thy fire!
Like sunsets bring moons to life
I'll obscure the galaxies to let Thee shine!
Thy light, my love unto the endlessness
I, the Suns, warden of lightness
I, the Fire, unto the nothingness!
I, the Suns, warden of lightness
I, the Fire, unto the nothingness!
I, the Suns, warden of lightness
I, the Fire, unto the nothingness!
I, the Suns, warden of lightness
I, the Fire, unto the nothingness!
I, the Suns unto the emptiness
You, the light, above the darkness
Bringer of lightness
Unto the endlessness
