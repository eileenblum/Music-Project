Pale stone carved in splendor, to Thee my word is spoken
Thine is the beauty the sweetest art could never paint, could never paint
Oh, the sweetest art could never paint
My eyes wide before thy white pure light
Shivering like feathers in a gale of wondering
Moon and stars unite
In the cold embrace of the nighttime
Moon, gleam in the blind eyes
And be my muse through the endless night
Pale stone blessed in mystery, to Thee my soul is bound
Thine is the light the darkest night could never hide, could never hide
Oh, the darkest night could never hide
My eyes wide before thy white pure light
Dancing like dead leaves in a whirl of wondering
Moon and stars unite
In the cold embrace of the nighttime
Moon, gleam in the blind eyes
And be my muse through the endless night
Moon...
Moon, inspire the barren mind
And I will be forever Thine
Moon and stars unite
In the cold embrace of the nighttime
Moon, gleam in the blind eyes
And be my muse through the endless night
Moon...
Moon, inspire the barren mind
So I will be forever Thine
