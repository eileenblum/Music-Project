Days of thunder ere roaming the land
Haze so grey, hiding ones hand
For the diviners a mystery
Deathbringer from no manâs land

The bones in blood hid the truth
The scare yonder times below any roof
So they send a messenger
To abort the pain
Tormenting them

Over mountains and seas he was sent
To find the ones to protect the land
Guardians of the forest thy were called
Avengers of wrath
A dead manâs squad

We are determined to kill
Our prophecy we fulfil
Against Attila we will fight
Without fear the heads up high

The fourth century anno domini
Brought change and grand diversity
Over the pass ye Carpathian woods
A Storm brood enslaving liberty

The certain death was waiting
Sneering in the face of the foes
Huns sans the sense of grace
Approached on their high battle steeds

FÃ¼get euch ihr Knochen im Blut
Gebt uns Rat und Heldenmut
Offenbart den Weg unseres Volkes
Gedeihen oder sind wir des Todes

FÃ¼get euch ihr Knochen im Blut
Gebt uns Rat und Heldenmut
Hildico so rate ich
Gebt sie fort mit Zwiegesicht

Now the moment of vengeance was near
Careless and proud he lay beside her
Hildico his virgin bride
Took revenge in their wedding night

Over mountains and seas she was sent
To find the one who torments the land
Hildico she was called avenger of wrath
The god sent Goth
