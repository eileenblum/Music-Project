From time immemorial
Old values reign the world
The oblivion is straight ahead
And the wisdom soon lost

My legacy
Are your ancestors words
Regard my call
Swear the oath

Loyalty in the brotherhood
Force in combat
Truth to your sword
And honor in death

Modern Warriors
I call you
Ancient Heritage
I praise you
Elderâs Wisdom
Will arise
Glaze at the sky
At the darkest time
Elderâs Wisdom
Will arise
As token of devotion
Carried up high

Till the circle of life has closed
You have to pass times of war
And times to celebrate
You wonât assign
Cause you know our heathen legacy

Everyone can choose

The rings of his chain of fate
But act with care
Even steel can burst

At the gates of Asgard
You will see them all
Recollecting your lifetime
Proud and strong

The ancestorâs legacy
You have regarded
Now affiliated
Into the circle of the brave men
