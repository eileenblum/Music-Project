In the forest of Teutoburg the lore began
When a young boy was taken by a plague
Smaller than a sword at the Romans side
As mercenary forever the foes guide

Arminius was his name
What we will never forget
A fighter for freedom
The hero of our land

In a cold autumn night
A bold plan was born
To deceive Varus, tormentor of Germania
And avenge his own blood

In the cover of the night
He gathered the clans
With the forest as their shelter
For the capture of homeland

We will banish them
Without regarding death

Avenge our ancestorâs blood
With the tenfold smash

Arminius we vaunt you
Shelter of Germania we honor you
With the sword in his hands the hero of our land
Risen up high and ready to slay

In the year 9 A.D
He wrote history
Killing an eighth of the foes army
Wrangling Varusâ ignominy
