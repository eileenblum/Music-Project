So many times youâve heard those lies 
So many times youâd like to cry 
Dazzled by their wrong words 
Perverted by their feign believe

We are calling canât you see 
We are the storm which was set free 
To break the chains they create 
And enforce the dawn of a new day

We are the void you couldnât find 
Follow us into the light 
We are the crowed youâre calling for 
Follow us once more

Sing with me my friend 
And pass by the dark end 
Come with me, I will you guide 
Trust me Iâll fight your strike

I feel our victory 
And see those bastards slain 
Our wrath is unleashed 
Stoked by their deeds

I feel our victory 
Savor our agony 
I see their misfire 
Brought down by heathen might

An institution built on lies 
A site of sand in the abyss of the waves 
Lord of the feeble tormentor of the weak 
Bastards of the cross I call you 
Die! Die! Hear my spell 
Burn! Burn! In your hell 
Redemption-idiocy 
Feigned and lied
