The fimbulvetr prays the blast of death from north
3 years of frost, 3 years of night
The final breath evaporates to the sky
To the stars up high

Skali and Hati chase the moon
Stars drop from the canopy
Fenris crashs his chains
Naglfar appears during night

The end of all no one to escape
Muspells sons are on their way
Odens son, Thor awaits them
To fight â to strike

ÃÃ¡ kemur inn rÃ­ki
aÃ° regindÃ³mi
Ã¶flugur ofan,
sÃ¡ er Ã¶llu rÃ¦Ã°ur

Ãar kemur inn dimmi
dreki fljÃºgandi,
naÃ°ur frÃ¡nn, neÃ°an
frÃ¡ NiÃ°afjÃ¶llum;
ber sÃ©r Ã­ fjÃ¶Ã°rum,
flÃ½gur vÃ¶ll yfir,
NiÃ°hÃ¶ggur nÃ¡i.
NÃº mun hÃºn sÃ¶kkvast
