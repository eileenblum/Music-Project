I take a look to my empty jar
A sense of sorrow thrills my head
Five new jiggers and five new jars
And I fall down and watch the stars

I brood about lands far, far away
Where the rivers are full of wine
Till the end of our days

Swaltjan
The brew nestles against my throat
We celebrate till the morning light
And drink and sing the entire night

I reached a time
I lost my guide
Everywhere I see
My demons alive

Nowhere I find
The light to escape
The end of the line
So endless and wide

Like in every battle singly the strongest survive
They face their demons and gloriously pass by
So I take my jar and my lovely bride
In a circle of friends and party tonight

Kling! The horns clash bright
A song thrills the night
The Barrels appear
Filled with mead inside

Come on drink my friend
And take your whore by her hand
Forget tomorrow we life now
Show yourself whatâs a dressing down
