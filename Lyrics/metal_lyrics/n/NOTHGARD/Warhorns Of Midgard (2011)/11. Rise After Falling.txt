In moments of fear
I bleed within
Deathâs so close
But still to far

I stroll through the time
Into distant lands
Once Iâve called mine

My sense of life
Lost long ago
Oppressed gasps
Are my only words
Forlorn
I set into the endless night
The burial site

Oh my heart, heart blood is black
Heading towards the end
At the edge of time I recollect
Everyone can rule his fate

From now on
I reaped the reign
Bout mind and time
About my life

Enslaved destiny
The serpent sign
Grew within
The decisions were mine

Tonight I will be free
The reign of life I can feel
So many years I wasted time
In the abyss within
Ignoring the sings
