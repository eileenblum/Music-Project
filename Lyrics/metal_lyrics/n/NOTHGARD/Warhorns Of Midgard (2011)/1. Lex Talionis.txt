Deep beneath the forest
An old shrew is in slumber
Holding the twines of life in
Her shivering oppressed hands

Branded by the elapsed eras
Sallow and gasping sitting
In a cave in which
The final breath is slowly hushed

An old saying tells us
Treat as you want to be treated
Seems to be forgotten
And replaced by scorn

Like a sword stroke
Deep in her heart
Our mother is dying
Forlorn and weak

The yarns are cut
Fenris free
I see what you canât see
Mother earth has died
Brought down by her sons

And our course is straight
Straight into the abyss of eternity
The last battle of Midgard
And our destiny is to die

The last hope is gone
Evaporated to dust
The reason for her call
Is the aftermath of us all
