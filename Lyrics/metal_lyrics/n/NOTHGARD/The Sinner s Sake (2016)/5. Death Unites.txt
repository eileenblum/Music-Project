When the blazing sun is gone
When nothing shines upon
Then you show your little light,
Illuminate eternal night

All light gone, Waiting for nightfall
Dark shades ever by my side
Voices thrill my oppressed mind
The maze of the past turns and twists
No one to help, no place to hide

Walking into nowhere
Singing this song - Singing all alone
Now it's time to leave - To leave this party
Death!

When the blazing sun is gone
When nothing shines upon
Then you show your little light,
Illuminate the night
So could it be, So shall it be
For most but not for me
I cannot see a light up high
Just a deep, empty, pitch black sky

Losing my way in the dark
Suicide in my mind
No sense of life, no place to hide

Now it's time to say
goodbye

[solo]

Mommy and Daddy and me up high
On the timber side by side only death unites

Freedom for our souls
I am coming home

When the blazing sun is gone
When nothing shines upon
Then you hide your little light,
To darken the night
I was a traveler in the dark
Who couldn't see a tiny spark
Who did not know which way to go,
Cause you did not twinkle so

Freedom for our souls
Home sweet home
