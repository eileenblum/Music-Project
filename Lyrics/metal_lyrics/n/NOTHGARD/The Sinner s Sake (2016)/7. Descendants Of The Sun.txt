Hatred - My staff of life
Lost At a forlorn site, at an island called
-I- Have lost my hope
All I see are creatures
Unfortunate and ludicrous

Pride Comes before the fall
Prepare to lick soil from our walls
See my smile

We all believe ourselves to be the chosen ones
The true and only descendants of the sun
Megalomania is the scourge of our time
When will you join the army of the blind?

Arrogance - Inanity
Virtues of our time, straw of the blind
SELECTION of IMPERFECTION
All I see Is a galaxy of self-Righteous humanity

Pride Comes before the fall
Prepare to lick soil from our walls
See my smile

We all believe ourselves to be the chosen ones
The true and only descendants of the sun
Megalomania is the scourge of our time
When will you join the army of the blind?

Open your eyes to outrun the blind
The descendants of the sun

Arrogance - Pride - Greed
those are the virtues of our time

What will Remain when the gloss has gone
Was it really enough to rise atop
Atop all others, descendant of the sun
Remember this: "Pride comes before the fall"

The true and only descendants of the sun
When will you join the army of blind?
