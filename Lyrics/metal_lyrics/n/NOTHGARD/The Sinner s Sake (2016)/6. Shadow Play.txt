Hey master tell the scum what to do
So aloof â the true ruler is you
We are the subjects you're the lord
We're unlettered â to ignore

You are neither a highness nor the light
Just a prick who likes to benight

We're the ones â the ones to fear
We're the power â drawing near
Your time of hauteur will soon be gone
You're the traitor â prepare to fall!
Bread and games
A shadow play

Can you feel the storm
Howling thunder heralds change
Resistance's born
Outta darkness of night into new light
Remember the time
The riot of masses praise the day
Fall of the blind
Out of the night into light

Resistance's born!

[Speech]

Can you feel the storm
Howling thunder heralds change
Resistance's born
Outta darkness of night into new light

Remember the time
The riot of masses praise the day
Fall of the blind
Out of the night into light

Can you feel the storm
Howling thunder heralds change

[Speech]
