Since one night in young years Impressed by you,
respect far beyond fear Death makes me lewd
I am just like you Veins frozen,
blood like ice I seek the one with the magic eyes
Love at first sight You will be mine!

Forever the forbidden fruit's the best
I want to stroke your virgin chest
Some say I'm cruel
But I just want youâ¦
The day has come
to sleep

You are my trophy Fruit of insanity
Your skin my raiment Its flawless state enchants
Love me - be me Fruit of insanity
Your blood fills up my well
Forever you shall dwell

The Beast unleashed
The time has come
To hush my darling
Don't fear the steel
Between your flesh and skin

You feel me Don't want to die OH Hear me cry
Say no word I'm your lord
A new masterpiece be done AMEN!

Inspiring mentor of my dreams
The White-chapel murders my doctrine -Leather Apron rules-
Their spirit my route
I must claim to be insane and deep within we are all the same
Inside us all We are craving for more

You are my trophy Fruit of insanity
Your skin my raiment Its flawless state enchants
Love me - be me Fruit of insanity
Your blood fills up my well
Forever you shall dwell

More - More - Give me more
Die! - Die! - To be mine
That's the scary truth I love you!
You are my trophy
Your skin my raiment
Love me - be me
Forever you shall dwell

â !YOU ARE MY TROPHY!â
