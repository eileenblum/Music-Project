You wanna know why I smile
Facing death
We ain't no ones to commiserate
You wanna see what I see
Fading light
Can you feel the sinner's sake arise?
This is the story of our demise
Downfall
Living on the edge
Living pain with blinded eyes
Nemesis
Shaking the devil's hand
Heading towards the gates of hell
Sodom ahead, no way back!
Into the cold of night
No place to hide
Caused by our own despite
We stand face to face with death
This is called sinner's sake
It's time to paint the walls black
Call the beast by name
Sinful minds delight our souls
This is called sinner's sake
It's time to paint the walls black
Call the beast by name
We all lost our halo so many years ago
Death awaits
Born in a hotbed of sin with a crown of thorns
You wanna know why I smile
Facing death
No one to commiserate
You wanna see what I see
Fading light
Can you feel the sinner's sake arise?
Yes, we stand face to face with death
This is called the sinner's sake
We stand face to face with death
This is called sinner's sake
It's time to paint the walls black
Call the beast by name
Sinful minds delight our souls
This is called sinner's sake
It's time to paint the walls black
Call the beast by name
