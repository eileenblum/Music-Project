Run! Run for your life!
Over hill and vale
No reason behind
Don't ask me why!
You're better off dead!
Close your eyes!

Death in the air
At the crack of dawn
New day - new chance
One on one
Life in my hand
The power is mine
It can be so easy
Behind iron sights

An uneven game
I don't give a shit
All I want is you
Cause I am sick
A one on one
This is Beast versus man
