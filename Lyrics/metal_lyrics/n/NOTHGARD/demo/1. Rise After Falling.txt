In moments of fear I bleed within
When the clouds hide and the shadows fall
A call thrills the endless night
A night so cold and wide

The ground of my mind so deep and grey
To the endless sky I will pray
My eyes can't see the truth ahead
Forever I will seek the freedom of mine
Big horns and wine

My heart, heart blood is gold
Brewed for thousand years
Fire, fire you light
At the bottom of my heart

With the wolves I run across the sea
Where our ships forever will be
My deepest enemies
I will fight to reach the golden light

Tonight I will be free
My lust for wine will never sleep
We wasted time, timer over time
For our treasure to unknown
