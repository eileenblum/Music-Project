A lore tells the story
Of the hero of our country
Not immortal but brave as a wolf
And his prophecy was to win

With balmung in his hands he set force
To fafnirs cave in the mountains of north
With aptness and bravery he killed the beast
And forever his strength we seek

Uns ist in alten Maeren wunders vil geseit
Von Helden lobebaeren, von grozer arebeit
Von kÃ¼ener recken striten muget ir nu wunder hoeren sagen
Von Helden lobebaeren
Hail Sigurd the dragon king

Imbruced in the blood of fafnir
An armour encased his body
Singly an oaken leaf prevented him
To be immortal against sword and spear
