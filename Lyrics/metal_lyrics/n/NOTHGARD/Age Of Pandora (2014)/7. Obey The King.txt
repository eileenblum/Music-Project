Ash and grime will hide all light
Bright red dawns replaced by night
Ice and snow so black not white
Storm and wind will rush all sites

Rise global strike
A new age of ice and snow
Black forces over earth
Devouring darkness forever glares

Feel my power see my Pride
Iâm the fortuneâs master, I rule the light
Obey my mania, I am insane
Iâm the only magistrate, my will takes place

The era of doom now begins to broach
Signs of downfall appear caused by the human scourge
Power, force and sole reign my childhood dreams
Money, might and terror my inner believe

Black clouds will cover the all-judging supernova
My dark realm begins to rise
Extinction of all life - what a nice mind
A new balance on earth I will provide

Rise global strike
A new age of ice and snow
A never-ending inferno

[Chorus:]
I can push the trigger â The lord is me
Have a nervous finger â The king is me
Better obey my madness â My will above
Deep within a child â Never beloved

[Power-chorus:]
7 Billion souls with one selected stroke
Extinction of all life is my major goal
Downfall of the world, my will be done
A supernova-storm, brighter than the sun

Feel my power, see my pride
Iâm the fortuneâs master, I rule the light

The world will perish, chaos pervades the day
War of the nations, black turns our fate
Battlefields ex soldiers, however death and harm
Cause we will push the trigger - Final super-war

Ash and grime will hide all light
Bright red dawns replaced by night
Ice and snow so black not white
Storm and wind will rush all sites
The time has come to close your eyes
Be prepared for a global strike
Death is the only solution
Life refuses any redemption

[Chorus]
[Power-chorus]

This is the final super-war
