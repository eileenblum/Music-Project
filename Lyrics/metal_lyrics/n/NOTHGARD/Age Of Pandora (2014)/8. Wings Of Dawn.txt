From ashes rising
Together we stand
Our legacyâs black
But itâs not the end
Nothing is too late
You have to fight
Open the gates of freedom
Into the light

Many years passed by
Dark clouds always attend
The sun forgot us
In dark haze I stand
Buried alive
Below the stars up high
I lose all hope for afterlife

Captured in our own ash
Buried 6 feet under at daylight

Sons of darkness
Sons of night
Children of coldness

At the blood red horizon
I can see a faint light
I feel itÂ´s heat
Still craven and shy
On mighty wings it rides
Towards our jail
I feel itÂ´s heat
So mighty and bright

[Chorus:]
Wings of dawn
Out of ashes we rise
Fallen legions
Onward a new time
Wings of dawn
Towards new light
Straight from our tombs
By tailwind to sky

Outta palace of ice
We smash our chains
Outta prison of night
Into dawn of the day
We are sons of Coldness
Of acerbity
The time has come to whet our blades
Sons of darkness
Sons of night
Children of coldness
Children of fright
We are slaves of doom
Of acerbity
The time has come to whet our blades

[Chorus]

6 Feet under at daylight
Buried by the cold night
2 steps from despair
Captured by burning air
Midnight at daylight
All hope flown by
The gates have closed we all thought
No more prayers to our gods

[Chorus]
By tailwind to sky
