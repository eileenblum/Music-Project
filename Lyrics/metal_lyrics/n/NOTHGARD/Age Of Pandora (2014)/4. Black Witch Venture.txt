HÃ¤nsel und Gretel weinten tief im Wald
Trotz Mondes Schimmer verstummten sie alsbald

Darkness surrounds two dead corpses
Stranded alone in the woods
Fear and sorrow reigned their souls
Abandoned far away from home

Nibble, nibble like a mouse
Who is nibbling at my house
The Wind the wind and dark wroth clouds
Nibble, nibble like a rat
Who is nibbling at my shack
Come in my kids, the sky turns black

Deep within the woods behind the local church
A hidden remote house where the evil dwells
This is what the rumors tell about this scourge
Are they true or false - Or just some fairy tales?

But once so they say, two children went astray
Far beyond the path they lost their way
No one has ever seen the two sad souls
Is this true or false - A far-fetched anecdote?

It is among us â Nearby among us all
The evil sits enthroned above in itÂ´s nasty hall
The witch is back on earth back from our brains banishment
Abducted children souls the punishment for ignorance

Filthy bastards exist at any time
Screams of agony will fill the sky

[Chorus:]
The night of the great hunt for vengeance and for blood
We ride on itÂ´s dark swings to wreck all filthy sins â Witch Burner
The time has come to judge all twisted male sluts
Be scared of our signs black banners risen high â Witch Burner

[Power-chorus:]
We are, we are â The new dawn
Slayer of the morbid spawn
We are, we are â The new dawn
Avenger of the tormented harm

[Power-chorus]

Nibble, nibble like a rat
Who is nibbling at my shack
Come in my kids, the sky turns black

Run you filthy rats in fear of your weird necks
The grand Warlock chase
Weâre witch hunter of modern age
The time has come to pray
Weâre hunting night and day
Be scared of our signs black banners risen high â Witch Burner

[Power-chorus]

Raven surround two corpses
In the woods behind the church
Fear and sorrow they have caused
Slayed down so well deserved
