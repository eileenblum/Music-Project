What do you think your eyes will see?
Why do you judge my peers and me?
Cause I am dumb â I am green
Mossback Children our destiny

From morning till evening working on the fields
Our neck is red - Red as hot steel
Education zero, farmer âBuckâ my hero
Farming, drinking, old shrew pounding
And a slang thatâs funny sounding

Fuck the rules, who needs schools
We have something better, our self-made booze
Thatâs our elixir what makes our day
Our flint, our urge, our manna to what we pray

Hey youâre damn right
We are dumb and boozy
Turn up the light

[Chorus:]
All rumors right, we canât deny
The mossback culture is our pride
Beer and booze our true faith
Disturbia Bavaria
All rumors right we canât deny
The mossback legacy granddadâs pride
Mountains and Woods longtime friends
Disturbia Bavaria

Look at me - Donât be shy
What can you see in my eyes?
I give you my permission
Does it fit to your fiction?

Oh nice throne was it pricey?
High above â Your life seems tasty
Whatâs the name of your high steed?
Is it hauteur? Is it envy?

Many things are not the same by the light of the day
However some are what they seem
Life is filthy, cruel and real
Some tell rumors, other lies â Some are friends, some demise
You canât hide from the truth
You ainât perfect so you lose
This is how it feels to be back down earth
A shadow of yourself
All rumors right, you canât deny

Look at me - Donât be shy
What can you see - In my eyes?
I give you my permission
Does it fit to your fiction?

[Chorus]

All rumors right, we canât deny
The mossback legacy granddadâs pride
Mountains and Woods longtime friends
Disturbia â Disturbia â Disturbia Bavaria
