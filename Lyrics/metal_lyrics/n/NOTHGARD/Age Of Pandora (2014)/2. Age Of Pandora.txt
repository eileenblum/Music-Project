Black clouds cross the sky like demons they arise
Unholy legions slay all light

In the past the lines were longer
Balance on earth much stronger
The daylight shined much brighter
Our human hauteur lighter

No i won't dare to praise 
All the bygone nights and days
But can't you see the signs
Pandora dons her deathman's sight

United by hatred - A dark corps at it's best
We will pay for our nasty sins
Bigoted Dastards - Two-edged twins

Age of Pandora comes 
Our justice, our hangman
To doom the human pride
Blood and thunder crash the site

Soon scared cries thrill the night
Carnage - Lakes of blood arise

[Chorus:]
Black clouds cross the sky
An evil army slays all light
Unholy troops arise
The demons of our tainted Reich
Black steam, the scourge of time
Prepares to overrun front lines
Unholy legions determined to slay all light

I can hear our funeral bells
see the tombs overfilled dark procession
On way to hell, Resist and arm for

STRIKE when the iron is still hot
RAISE your fist, pay with blood
FORGE your destiny
Standing tall, form new walls
STRIKE when the iron is still hot
RAISE your fist, pay with blood
FORGE your destiny
Standing tall, form new walls

The world is doomed by chaos on a course towards the abyss
Get armed for your last fight and welcome the eternal night
The time has come for us to die
Pandora rise

[Chorus:]
Black clouds cross the sky
An evil army slays all light
Unholy troops arise
The demons of our tainted Reich
Black steam, the scourge of time
Prepares to overrun front lines
Unholy legions determined to slay all light

[Power-chorus:]
Black clouds cross the sky
Like demons they arise
Unholy legions
Slay all night

[Chorus:]
Black clouds cross the sky
An evil army slays all light
Unholy troops arise
The demons of our tainted Reich
Black steam, the scourge of time
Prepares to overrun front lines
Unholy legions determined to slay all light
