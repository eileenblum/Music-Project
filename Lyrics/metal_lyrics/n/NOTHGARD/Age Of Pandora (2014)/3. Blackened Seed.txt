We all know this filthy pack
Living in a town of rats
A horde of sinners, twisted plague - Chadband - Dark seed
Authority of the holy Reich - Satanâs ever right aside

In shadow standing â Arcane acting
Wrong illusions â A holy pollution
Lies telling â Hollow-pretending
Wrong illusions - Holy pollution

Herdsmen of the weak
Our childrenâs malady
Disease of a blackened seed
Church means agony

[Chorus:]
Moribund - Arise against the holy Reich
Underdogs - Unite to smash their twisted light
Free born troops - Rush âgainst Rome arouse a storm
Procus animus mortem Vatican

Expeditio sacra deus lo vult
Inquirere letum preccatore
Thy god ainât my lord
Thy godâs dolor
Thy kirk ainât my church
Thy faithâs my scourge

The stronghold of evil evaporates to dust
Even your holy father addicts the human lust
Servants decrease demise of Vatican
Brick after brick the realm begins to fall

In shadow standing â Arcane acting
Wrong illusions â A holy pollution
Lies telling â Hollow-pretending
Wrong illusions - Holy pollution

[Chorus:]
Moribund - Arise against the holy Reich
Underdogs - Unite to smash their twisted light
Free born troops - Rush âgainst Rome arouse a storm
Procus animus mortem Vatican

Gather your force to unleash a storm
Relieve your mind
Breakup their Reich

Soon a new dawn will awake
Thousand comrades prepare for raid
You sow wind we bring storm
Your feigned lies stoke our scorn

[Chorus:]
Moribund - Arise against the holy Reich
Underdogs - Unite to smash their twisted light
Free born troops - Rush âgainst Rome arouse a storm
Procus animus mortem Vatican
