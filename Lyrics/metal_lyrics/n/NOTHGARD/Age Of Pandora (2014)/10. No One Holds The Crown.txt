It was a cold eve in November 1909
When the time has come to clear the lies
Regrets tortured his mind
He asked her to be aside
Faint - His death guide
The last what he said was this advice
For her life

Use your time, live your life
Else regrets perish your mind

Regrets cry in the head
Time is running through your hands
So many things to ask and do
Last supper and we all knew

The curtains fall
The lights turn down
The last gasp to sound

Time will take us down
Down to break apart
No one holds the crown
The end suspends all
Alea jacta est
Can you hear their call? They take us all
Hush - Donât say a word
Find your peace and bow outta earth

Rest in peace and be free
Who lived life and knew the fee
If you are yonder wasting thy
Fear the eternal sand of time

[Chorus:]
Time is the curse, our Judge
Dark figure which gives us hope
Hope to fall in love, to live our life
And the one who makes us die
Die without regrets, the head up high
âCause you felt love, hate, used your
Time, is running out for those useless
Wasting life

Time will take us down
Down to break apart
No one holds the crown
The end suspends all

The curtains fall, lights turn down
Can you hear their call? They take us all

[Chorus]

You hear my call, listen itâs aimed at all
You will never know when your leave will fall

[Chorus]

Use your time
Live your life
Else regrets
Perish your mind
