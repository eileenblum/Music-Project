I am the sentinel of my own sanity
I am the fuse to blow up your cage
Call me the void
Together we break free
I am the torch to ignite your inner rage

Feel the strength inside
Shelter your discrete mind
Feel the power within and rise far beyond
Feel the wrath inside
Shelter your discrete mind
Out of my head
I am my own god!

I am the demon to shade their devised Reich
I am the hammer to destroy your chains
Call me the void towards the other side
I am the torch to ignite your inner rage

Feel the strength inside
Shelter your discrete mind
Feel the power within and rise far beyond
Feel the wrath inside
Shelter your discrete mind
Out of my head
I am my own god!

There is war in my head
There is rage in my heart
Shut them out â free your mind
It's your turn â I win this game

Feel the strength
Shelter your mind
Feel the power
You are your own god!

Free your mind!
