Against the laws of time
In another universe
In a paralyzed state bounded to dwell
Until they sealed my personal hell

Only the devil can count
All the sacrifices
Only the devil will know
The blood I have shed

Towards the light
I left my demons behind to die
Reborn within
At terrene hell
I left my shell behind to die
Reborn within

In the mirror I could not see me
It simply fell silent
No reflection to see â darkness
In a cocoon trapped with broken wings
Until the angels start to sing my name

Only the devil can count
All the sacrifices

Into the light
My demons behind to die

Towards the light
I left my demons behind to die
Reborn within
At terrene hell
I left my shell behind to die
Reborn within
I am reborn
Reborn within!
Towards the light
Reborn within!
