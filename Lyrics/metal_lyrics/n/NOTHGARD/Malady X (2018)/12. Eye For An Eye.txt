[Bonus Track]At the edge of the world
Where the moon takes its course
An island full of tales
1701 hauteur befouled a man
Death and pain caused by his hands
He fueled the rage
Unleashed a war

47 loyal men
On command for blood revenge

Blood for blood and no retreat
Allegiance 'til death
Eye for an eye
They show no grace
Allegiance 'til death
They are Ronin
Blood for blood and no retreat
They are condemned to death

Born as war machines
Designed to serve and kill
They ain't know fear
They ain't know pain
They are carnivores
They rule the battlefield
For glory they'd die
You call them Samurai

When the clouds cover the sky
When the moon awakes the night
A last prayer and no retreat
'Til they die â 'til victory

47 loyal men
They are Ronin
Blood for blood and no retreat
They are condemned to death
