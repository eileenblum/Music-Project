Run, little rabbit, they breathe down your neck
The lurking enemies, lurking friends
Out of shadow, out of the black
In the choke-hold of the snakes

Shades get longer when night ends and daylight breaks
Signs are clear when the haze evaporates
Fear them all and trust no one
In the choke-hold of the snakes

Venom in my veins
Death will await
Venom in my veins
By evil embraced
From the bottom of my heart
I hope you will burn in hell

Stabbed from behind
In a cave of snakes
Contagious mankind
You will burn!
Between enemy lines â moribund
Awaiting the reign â of the snakes
Dawn of demise â all shall burn
You will burn!

In silence they come, bring death and pain
Share their table, play a false game
Fear them all and trust no one
In the choke-hold of the snakes

Stabbed from behind
In the choke-hold of the snakes
Contagious mankind
All shall burn â we will burn
All burn!

Fear them all and trust no one my friend!
