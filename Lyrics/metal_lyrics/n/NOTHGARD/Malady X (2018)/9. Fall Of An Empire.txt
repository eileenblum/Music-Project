Black clouds in the sky
The witness of your misfire
You failed along the line
It's better to resign!

Embraced by craven scum
Elected to number one
Afar from reality
You live your life in debauchery

He who sows the wind shall reap the storm!
Can you hear me? Can you see me?

Fall â when the new day will break
Die, bury yourself â a castle made of sand
Fall â when the dark sky will awake
Die, bury yourself â the tide begins to rise

All you touch turns into gold?
You are the God-given hope?
Just a rogue without a spine
You pray water but drink the wine!

He who sows the wind shall reap the storm!
Can you hear me? Can you see me?

Fall â when the new day will break
Die, bury yourself â a castle made of sand
Fall â when the dark sky will awake
Die, bury yourself â the tide begins to rise
Die, bury yourself Die, bury yourself when the day will break!

Oh, fall!

When the new day is about to break
Die, bury yourself â a castle made of sand
When the dark sky finally awakes
Die, bury yourself â the tide begins to rise
A castle made of sand
Die, bury yourself â the tide begins to rise
