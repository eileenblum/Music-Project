Overcome by distaste
My eyes bleed, turn into black
Abandoned by the gods â left behind
No one wants to realize
We drown ourselves in gloss and shine
Disclaim our virtues for our pride
Me and I, devil-may-care
Future is dead and present means hell

The world turns black

If you like curiosity
Come inside and take your seat
Forget about morality
Just believe!

Welcome to the show
Malady superabounds
Open your eyes and see
The insane reality
This is the world we're living in
Right before the abyss
Malady superabounds
Welcome to the show

A society on burned ground â soaked in blood
Fear thy neighbor, god is dead
We are sick in many ways â countless
No one wants to realize
We gloat over agony â mortal fear
On the wings of the weak we fly
Stitch up my lips and seal them well
If you don't wanna hear the truth

Welcome to the show
Malady superabounds
Open your eyes and see
The insane reality
This is the world we're living in
Right before the abyss
Malady superabounds
Welcome to the show

This world is a cage
No escape
Better not be weak
You can't flee
This is the world we're living in
Right before the abyss

Welcome to the show
It's better to forego
Open your eyes and see
This is reality
Open your eyes and see
Malady!
