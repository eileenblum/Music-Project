Shades of war
In my head
Shades of war

I pray to the god of time
To hold it back â the frightening night
To turn around his hourglass
And give me peace, a bit of rest
Keep the night to no escape
Give me one more day
I wither for all tears I lost
Shades of war my decay

In the beat of war
We obeyed like fucking whores
The commands were clear
There was no pain, there was no fear

Dark shades are everything I can see
Behind closed eyes â at front line
All fades, why not the pain I am doomed to feel?
Dark shades are everything I can see
Behind closed eyes â at front line
All fades, why not the pain I am doomed to feel?

On the run the wolves behind
Carnivores seek my life
Knock and loose when sight is clear
The time has come â it's him or me
Dark shades on my wall
I can see them crawl
Dark shades in my head
Gathering above my bed

Dark shades are everything I can see
Behind closed eyes â at front line
All fades, why not the pain I am doomed to feel?
Dark shades are everything I can see
Behind closed eyes â at front line
All fades, why not the pain I am doomed to feel?

Dark shades in my head
Leaving nothing but the pain
Dark shades in my head
Only sorrow will remain

In my, in my, in my head!
