In the darkness I can hear them
Writhing scratching dig and scrape
This is the mauling of the universe
What will it cost to escape

No war is good - No war is holy

In the starkness I won't fear them
As the sky begins to break
All the powers of the universe
There's no end to what they'll take

No war is good - No war is holy

Yes the Giant chokes in the mud
Ash in the street soaks up the blood
Disappears and never was
World standing just as it does

As the Giant chokes in the mud
Ash in the street soaks up the blood
Disappears and never was
World spinning and spinning, beginning again

Ride out the storm, block out the sun
Beacon glow shine ray of light
A new plane of insane dimension
Alive in the day and still at night

No war is good - No war is holy
I can't take no more - No war
