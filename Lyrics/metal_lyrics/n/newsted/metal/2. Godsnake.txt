Say god came down as a snake
How long do you think it would take
'Til someone cut off his head
And left him lying for dead
took his skin for their boots
And cook his flesh for their soup
His spine a necklace to fight
Shake rattle dance all night

Say the devil came as a child
One who always smiles
How long would we stand by
Young one that never cried

Read to see don't judge this book
I need to be uncover for a closer look
No time for apology rename reality
First glance seems to be
The wrong way for you to judge me

Say the devil came as a child
Free and running wild
Demon eyes casting a spell
Charming all the way to hell

Read to see don't judge this book
I need to be uncover for a closer look
(discover with a closer look, now)
No time for apology rename reality
First glance seems to be
The wrong way for you to judge me

Say the devil came as a child
Innocent and running wild
Demon eyes casting a spell
Charming all the way to hell

Knowing nothing - believing anything
Forgetting everything - I want to stand for something
For God's sake
