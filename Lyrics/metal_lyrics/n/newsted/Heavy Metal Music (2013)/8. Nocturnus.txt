I want to stay below the streets I want to play behind the scenes I shy away from surface freaks I stay below
Thirty stories below daylight in the channels it is always night
Between the flush of the rush hours when the surface dwellers are away from their showers
In the tunnels that slake the cities thirst so full of shit sometime they are going to break or bust
The stench of it would send you reeling cold concrete ceiling a safe warm feeling Nocturnus

Third rail leads me to home my piece of the world where no other man goes
I do not need a torch anymore to see
Satan on his porch this ain't for the weak
On the street I see you all stressed and screaming
While in my place I lay dreaming
Fight for the space on the terra dwell
I'm keeping to my heaven under your hell

Without the underworld there would be no above
Without the other-world there would be no above
Without the underworld there would be no above
Without the underworld there would be no above
Your precious topsoil would be one big flood the creepy crawler Nocturnus
They try to drive us out and burn us they are the invaders
Not we of the underbelly life above left me no room
I laugh and slither down forty flights to my womb
I want to stay below the streets I want to play beneath your feet
I shy away from the surface freaks I stay below I play below I pray below just lay me low Nocturnus
