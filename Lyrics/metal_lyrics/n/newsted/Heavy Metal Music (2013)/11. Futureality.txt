Begin the day dive in the waves
Smile in the sun swim with the rays
Laugh in the light loud is the sound
Live in the night cannot bring me down
Ancients walk on the land rising out of the sea
Planting seeds in the sand growing you and me before and after be

Into the blue bright yellow spies
Surroundings new under see life
Flash the horizon lightning strikes leap
Passionate rising fighting to keep
Ancients walk on the land rising out of the sea
Planting seeds in the sand growing you and me before and after be

Pray for the future way of the future in our hands
It is never too late to pray for the future pray the future has a chance
Weight of the future plans pray for our future I can see the future and it is close at hand
Ancients walk on the land rising out of the sea
Planting seeds in the sand growing you and me before and after be
