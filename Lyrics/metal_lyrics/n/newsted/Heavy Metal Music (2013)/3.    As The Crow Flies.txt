I spin around the sun I thank you may I have another
I am an army of one honour and respect my brother
The night is young crowded hearts are nine to four
If ever daylight comes save yourself and save your soul

As the crow flies I will make my way
As the day dies I look back and say
I look back and say well spent time today
I make my own way and I am not afraid

In from the word go bang those troubled thoughts out of your head
What you live is what you know any day alive is better than dead
Lets stay out all night and watch the shadows play in the light
And just look at us now I'm not afraid of failing I'm not afraid of flight

Beautiful in life unforgettable in death
Don't stop dreaming until the last breath
Until the last breath the hunger to be
To think and feel don't stop dreaming until it becomes real
