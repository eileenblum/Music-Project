So father if I wake up hard to conceal
What I need I take off what I want I steal
Bring me directly taste the poison
Memories reappear from the lightning sun
Been a thief of liars true to what is real
Take a look in my eyes and see what you feel see what you feel

Eternity ain't over until I can't make a sound
The magic ends up broken so long I've seen you around
Trying lord I'm dying I won't wallow in what I've done
Earth angel rising swallow in the sun
I promise it ain't over run life into the ground
Change of sea unspoken so long you'll see me around
You'll see me around I'll see you around

I take a chance by letting you in
I take a chance at getting poisoned again
I take a chance
I get stabbed in the back again
I wanna see that I want to stay
Don't wanna make the same mistake
Too much at stake heroic dose I take
