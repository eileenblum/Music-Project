Break of dawn I raise my head
Another night is gone another day is lead
Face the lights heed the stars afraid of being scared
Trace my life read the scars without you I am nowhere

Need you to embrace me hear my call
Through the darkness you take me transcending all
Face the lights heed the stars afraid of being scared
Trace my life read the scars without you I am nowhere

Live to remember not to regret fight until forever I won't forget
Live to remember keep no secret try to forever after the stone is set
Live to remember not to regret fight until forever I won't forget
Live to remember keep no secret try to forever long after the stone is set
