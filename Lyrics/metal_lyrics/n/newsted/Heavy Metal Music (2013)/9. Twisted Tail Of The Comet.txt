This is for my friend no longer here
Pick up signal in the atmosphere

Look away look above stargazerÂ 
From where you're sent to me unclearÂ 

A comet with a twisted tailÂ 
From on high resounding wail
Logical master constant truthÂ 
Cosmic master slight of hoof

Look away look above stargazerÂ 
From where you're sent to me unclearÂ 
Books of plays discover amazerÂ 
Your vision lives eternal here

Turn up guitar begin to play and I cheerÂ 
Sounds so much better when we're up here
With your hands you shine back lightÂ 
I see you in the stars at night

D'amour in my heart to stay
Up until my last dayÂ 
Too soon my friend taken away
Adieu my friend taken away

Please don't take my friend away.
