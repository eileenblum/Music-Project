Rain twists shapes and hisses fear
I kiss my tears as the ground disappears
White stones fall down from the sky
Black storm clouds groan and then they start to cry
Live while you are living because you are a long time dead

Rats in rhythm and snakes in tongues
Mud flakes and fungus are coating my lungs
Squash the doubt mankind washed out
Without machines without a prayer we cannot prepare
Fire on frost tired and lost the city into the sea is tossed liars cost mired and scoffed
Screaming pleas as mother earth breathes
Throw away the trees blow away the breeze
Live while you are living because you are a long time dead
Give while you are living share with me what is in your head

Sea to rising sea grey solar light
Wicked winds churning up the polar night
All living things under leaves gasp
Water heaves fast a feat a task beliefs are smashed a patch of grass to feed I ask
Gods wallop shatter the world at will thinning the herds with a flush to spill
All that matters scattered in the swill all that matters not enough still
