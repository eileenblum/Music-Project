Pick up the pieces that the puzzle made
From scraps of dreams out of focus and frayed
Make up the reasons for the words that were said
From scraps of dreams that trap the screams

[2x]
Take my place leading the pack
Back down from my razorback
I dig deeper to bury and find the track

I am the king
I am the king
I am the king of the underdogs
You know that's my name
King of the underdogs
King of the underdogs

[2x]
Running into the unknown
Lonely yet I am not alone
I keep looking to grind a stone

I am the king - underdogs rise
I am the king - from the flames
I am the king - underdogs rise
I am the king of the underdogs
You know that's my name
Underdogs rise
I am the king - from the flames
I am the king - underdogs rise
I am the king of the underdogs
You know that's my name

King of the underdogs
King of the underdogs

[2x]
Sworn to fun discovery
I still dream imagining
Beyond the edge recovering

Underdogs rise from the flame
Feel the sound feet to ground
Hellhound unchained
And they rise from the flame
Feel the sound feet to ground
Hellhound unchained

Underdogs rise
Underdogs rise
Unleash the hellhound

I am the king, king of the underdogs [until the end]
