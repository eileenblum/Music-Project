He Died For Me On The Cross
Took My Sins And Threw Them Away
he Lit The Fire In My Soul
At Last I've Reached My Goal

Hand In Hand Through The Fields Of Fire

No More Shadows From The Past
My Spirit Free, Free At Last

Here I Stand On The Road
The Road To Meet My Destiny
I'm Not Afraid ?Cause I'm Saved
Yes I'm Saved By A Living Truth
