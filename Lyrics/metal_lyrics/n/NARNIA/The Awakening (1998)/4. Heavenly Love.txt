Since The Day You Came
Came Into My Life
Everything has Felt So Right
You Made Me Glad, You Gave Me Love
Like None Has Done Before

For Every Step I Take
I Can Feel That You Are Near
You're Always Walking By My Side
With Your Open Arms
You're Love Shines Right To Me
I Can't Believe That It's True

I Can't Live Without Your Love
Lord You Give Me All That I Need

Everything Is Possible
For Our Almighty God
If You Let Him Take Your Hand
Recieve His Love And You Will See
How Wonderful It Can Be
