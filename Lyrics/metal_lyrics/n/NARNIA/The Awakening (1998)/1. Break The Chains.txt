Reaching For Life From The Cold
Emptiness
Ready For The Storms To BLow
But You've Heard It All Before
You've Seen It All Before
But There's Something More I Know

Something More

Thousands Of Voices Cry Out
In The Night
Tells You What's Wrong And What's Right
Never Before Have You Felt Such A Pain
Now Is The Time To Break The Chains

They Talk About Eternity
But You Don't Wanna Live Forever
Life Or Death Is The Question You See
A Simple Choice Between Heaven And Hell

Heaven

Heavenly Father Show Me Wonders
Could You Give Me A Sign
You Carried The Cross For Me
You Wasted Your Blood For Me
The Head Of The Searpent Lies Crushed On
The Ground
