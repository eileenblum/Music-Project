The Night Was Dark And Cold As Ice
I Met That Stranger From Far Beyond
My Dreams
Staring Into Those Eyes I Was Blinded By
A Light
Paralysed By The Power I Fell Down On
My Knees

It Was Never Easy To See
But Now It's So Clear As Anything Can Be
I Felt Such Warmth In My Deserted Soul
Oh Holy Spirit, Come To Me

I Stood There Waiting For The Dawn
My Tears Were Flowing And My Sins
Faded Away
The One Who Has The Power Is The One Who
Breaks The Bonds
Let The Only Son Of God Cleanse
Your Soul
