When I Look, Look Around Me
I See The Nature That You Have Created
It's So Beautiful, It's So Perfect
Oh, I'm So Charmed By You

There's Noone Like You
You Are So Wonderful
There's Noone Like You
You Are So Wonderful

I Can Feel It From Above
A Touch From You, Touch From You
I Can Feel It From Above
A Touch From You, Touch From You

Every Day, Every Minute
You Always Take Care Of Me
We Walk Together Now Forever
I Can't Live Without You Constantly
