Times Passing By, Just Another Day
Filled With promises Of A Better World
Which Seems So Far Away

In A World Of Darkness
In This Place Of Pain
His Light Will Shine So Strong
Forever And Ever

See The Sign, The Sign Of The Time
Oh, See The Sign, The Sign Of The Time

There Is No Time, No Time To Waste
Prophecy's Been Spoken
'Bout The Time For Him To Come Again
