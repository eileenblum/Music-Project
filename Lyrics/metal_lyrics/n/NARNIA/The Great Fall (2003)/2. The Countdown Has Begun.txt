I leave today
Into the eyes of death I smile
No turning back now
For power and glory and justice for all

Fight for the truth (so vague, so strong)
Bend every rule  (so pure, so wrong)
Pray for the soldier, in this cause we stand
Blinded we aim  (denying history)
We shall proclaim (our sweet victory)
Every nation bows at our feet

We fight to find a meaning, to see them falling down
Tear down the walls and build them higher and higher

I won't go back
Never again will I betray
My land or my people
Lift my eyes to the horizon
Borders to conquer and banners to burn

Fight for the truth (so vague, so strong)
Bend every rule  (so pure, so wrong)
Pray for the soldier, in this cause we stand
Blinded we aim  (denying history)
We shall proclaim (our sweet victory)
Every nation bows at our feet

We fight to find a meaning, to see them falling down
Tear down the walls and build them higher and higher
We've fought trough endless battles, but now we're falling down
Tear down our minds and make them sronger and colder

Don't run from the pain
Drowning in a memory of the times we miss the most
One day this will all be gone
Anybody smells my fear, a heart that's turned to ice
Who could tell that this would be the end that's in their lies
Hide...for the countdown has begun...

We fight to find a meaning, to see them falling down
Tear down the walls and build them higher and higher
We've fought trough endless battles, but now we're falling down
Tear down our minds and make them stronger and colder
