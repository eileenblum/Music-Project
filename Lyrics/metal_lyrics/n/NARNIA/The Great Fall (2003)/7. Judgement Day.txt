I've seen them falling everywhere
Like candles fading unaware
Imprisoned by a world of glass
We fight for freedom, but when will we face it

Sinners and saints living under the same sun
Holding the key to the world in thier hands
Our time on earth's drawing nearer the end
In the light of judgement day

We bow our heads for our pride
Hiding under the dreams that died
What lies beneath might be revealed
So we keep running, from the face of God we turn

Sinners and saints living under the same sun
Holding the key to the world in thier hands
Our time on earth's drawing nearer the end
In the night of judgement day

Sinners and saints living under the same sun
Holding the key to the world in thier hands
Our time on earth's drawing nearer the end
In the light of judgement day
