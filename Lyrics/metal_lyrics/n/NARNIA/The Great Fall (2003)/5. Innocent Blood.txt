Waiting for the hour to strike
I've been longing for this journey
To get out of my broken world and
Reacg the land of the holy
Aiming for the goal in my life
I need to clear my mind
Shelter for my bleeding heart
In the presence of my saviour

Jerusalem - here I come
Jerusalem - my live has just begun

Now I'm here at last on holy ground
To see the sacred places
Fot the first time in my life
I'm free without obligations

Smoke and fire block out the sun
Dead bodies all around
Innocent blood
Smoke and fire block out the sun
Dead bodies all around
Innocent blood

Warm blood is pouring down my face
My heavy legs are aching
I survived and what's the cost
I'm back in my living hell

Jerusalem, what have you done?
Jerusalem, you killed the only one

My God I'm asking you now
Why your holy land is falling
What is left and who is right?
I need you now to guide me

Dawn of terror, rise again
Will the killings ever end
Will this broken world be healed
Or an eternal battlefield
People dying, God is crying
Will this evil ever end?
Love your father, hate your brother
One day you all must repent

Smoke and fire block out the sun
Dead bodies all around
Innocent Blood
Smoke and fire block out the sun
Dead bodies all around
Innocent blood
