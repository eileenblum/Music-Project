I am waiting for it
Longing for the moment

When the world will see the truth
Few can hear the voice
Many hearts are frozen
Only the father knows the hour

I will be there
Stay close to you
You're in command
I'll follow you until the end

Just another day
In another world
Death will be no more
We're united as one

Every man will see it
They will feel the power
When the king is coming back
Demons bow their heads
Darkness flee away
When they must face
The creator of life

Long live the king of our lives
Into the night, into the fire
Turn on the lights, demons will
Bow their heads for the king
Angels are singing
Out of the night, out of the fire
Enter the gate into the kingdom
Leaving behind what's holding us down
All of our fears, all of our hatred
All of our wars, all of our sorrows
Dry all your tears ? heaven is open
Into the light, out of the night
Dry all your tears, heaven is open
Enter the gate, enter the gate!!!
