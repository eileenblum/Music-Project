Ice and snow along the way
The world is cold, where is the spark that we
Used to have inside?
Join together, stand united
The mighty one will lead us all the way

This is not a fairy tale
Not a silly game we play
Turn around and see the difference

Show all the world that freedom shall come
And sins were forgiven for mankind
Come closer to see the treasure now
Together we'll rise, we will...

Show all the world
We will show all the world
We are working for the master
The nights are long and the sacrifices
Are hard to face something
Into the fire in pole position
We're ready for the call, it is our mission
