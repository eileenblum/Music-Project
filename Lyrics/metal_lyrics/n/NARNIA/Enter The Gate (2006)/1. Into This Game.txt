Here I am in this world
I'm a servant for your name
Trying to make a better place
I see fear, death, pain and anger
People crying in despair
The emptiness is growing strong today

Into this game
Running through fire and water
In Christ I am strong
My vision is clear
You are the reason I live
I'm into this game for your name

I look around where is the light
Shadows all around the world
We're getting closer to the end
Give me love for my enemies
Give me hope for the broken ones
Holy spirit, show the the way

Time to move on
Gotta be strong
The road is long
It's time to move
