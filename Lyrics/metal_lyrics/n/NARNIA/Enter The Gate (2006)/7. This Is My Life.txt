I'm living my life
One more day in this world
My energy flows in my body and soul
I see the snow on the roof
The sun is shining so bright
My focus is right and
I'm ready to go your way

I'm on my way
No one can stop me now
With guidance from above
I'm on the right side
Your will is my life

This is my life in your holy masterplan
You opened the door, you paid the price

Since the day I was born
You knew it all from the start
Every second was planned for my life in this world
