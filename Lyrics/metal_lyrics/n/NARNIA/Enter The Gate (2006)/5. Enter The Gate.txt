Getting closer to the end
The final chapter has begun
You can't run, you can't hide
Face the truth, see the signs

You are falling from the edge
I saw the crisis in your eyes
Working hard to survive
One more day in fools paradise

Enter the gate into the final mystery
Forever my soul will rest in peace
Leaving the shadows far behind
I'm entering the gate of life
Break the chains and see the light

Yeah, I hope to see you there
Don't you see I care for you
All to win for you and me
Eternal love and peace for free
The eternity to win
Jesus is the open gate
Enter in and you will see
The sins are gone, you will free
