The day has just begun
It's autumn time
Leaves falling from the trees
The wind is blowing and the rain is pouring down
Darkness entering my door and it's hard to see
The light

The law of nature
Revolution of mother earth
I need to die from my selfish mind
The law of nature
Revolution of mother earth
I need to die from my foolish pride to be alive

I'm waiting for the sunrise
I'm waiting for a change
It's hidden in the dusky shadows
Longing for tomorrow but afraid to face the day

I'm just an ordinary man
In the middle of the storm

The day has just begun
It's autumn time
Leaves falling from the trees
