Winds are changing
In this world today
In this century
So many men have fallen
We are blinded by power &amp; gold
Reaching for the top of the mountain

All our lives we try
Reach the sky to find the reason

Since the garden of Eden
Eating the forbidden fruit
Man wants to go his own way
We are screaming no mercy
We're lords of this new world
Building up an empire
Reaching for the top of the mountain

We're falling, falling from the throne
Keep falling, falling from the stars
We're falling, falling from the throne
Keep falling, falling from the stars

There was a man like you and me
He paid the big prize all mankind
He sacrificed everything
The golden throne belongs to him

Winds are changing
In this world today
Man wants to go his own way
