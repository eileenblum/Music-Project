How far can we go
Alwys trying to push the limits
The modrn man of today
On the razor's edge
There's no destination and no plans for the future
We are the victims of this computerized worldy

My time is running fast
We're following the flow
No time for you and me
No time at all

Where are we going to?
We are confused and cannot see
We're asking us the question
How far can we go

Where are we going to?
Light up the sky
Show us the way
We are the victims, we are the victims

Walking the wire and playing with fire
Walking the wire and playing with fire

We're close to the edge
Time's running faster and faster
Pray for your life and search for the truth
A world full of chaos
Will we ever learn?
Angel of mercy
Please take my hand
