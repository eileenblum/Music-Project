I'm tired and frustrated
Standing at the crossroad
Which one is the right?
It's hard to choose the right way
Listening to my heart's voice
But I can't hear the words, no!

Dazed and confused
My mind is black

Chasing for fame
Chasing for fortune
Trapped in this race
Want a quick solution
Chasing for love and confirmation
Trapped in this age

When I was younger
I knew all the answers
Everything was alright
It was easy living and no responsibility
For me and my life

You see my wounded soul
Hear my silent cry
I pray to you I don't wanna die
You know my sorrow
You know my sins
I'm afraid I don't wanna die

You see my wounded soul
You hear my silent cry
I pray, I pray, I pray to you
