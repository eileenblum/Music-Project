The battle is coming
I've been waiting so long
Prepared with my golden sword
And my body is strong
In the name of the lion
Judgement will come
Holy fire is burning and I'm ready to fight

Brave men are joining the army
They will fight for the truth
They carry the spirit of the brave
They will never surrender - No!!!

The witch &amp; the lion
The battle between good &amp; evil

See the demons around me
They're dancing so wild
Trying to hypnotize me
I see the lies in their eyes
They know the battle is lost
Aslanis broken the spell
They can't face the truth
They will all go to hell (burn)

The witch &amp; the lion
The battle between good &amp; evil

Now the stonetable is broken
The battle is won
Forever and ever
