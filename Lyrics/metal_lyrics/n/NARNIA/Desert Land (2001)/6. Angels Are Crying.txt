Look and see
What we've created
I'm not proud of what I see
We are living in a world of confusion
Lies don't bother us anymore

We're the last generation
Still we live the same way as in Babylon
Oh no! We haven't learned the lesson

The angels are crying
When they see what we have done
See the angels are crying, crying

We can't hear the spirit talking
Too deaf and blind to hear and see
We're too proud to change the way of living
Always eye for an eye

Look out! Look out!
The angels are crying
When they see what we have done
See the angels are crying, crying
