My Shining Star
Oh Teach Me More
My Heart Is Bleeding
For The Lost Ones

There's So Many People
So Many Souls
Lost Without A Warning
I Can't See Them Go
The Wrong Direction

Your Voice Is Calling
Calling On Me
Lord, Here I Am

The Mission, My Mission
I Wanna Go

The Final Hour
Will Soon Be Here
We Don't Know
When The Bell Is Ringing

The Mission, My Mission
I Wanna Go
The Way You Want Me To
