I've Been Running All My Life
To Find Some Peace Of Mind
Searching For The Treasure Everywhere
I Met Jesus Christ
He's The Son Of God
He's The One Who Heald My Broken Heart

I Breathe Your Spirit
I Breathe Your Love

Living Water From The Father
Fills My Body
Now I'm Moving On

I've Greed So Many Tears
For So Many Years
Looking Out For Real Love In My Life
I Met The Holy One
Salvation Through God's Only Son
Eternal Life For The World Today

Shining Light
Shines So Bright
I'm Moving On
