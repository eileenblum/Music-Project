Always Searching For Peace Of Mind
In This World Of Tragedy
Lost And Lonely, Fooling Around
Trapped In This Evil Game

Got No Strength, Got No Love
Life Is Slowly Fading Away
Broken Promises Everywhere
You're Out Of Control

Living Hell
Fills Your Brain
When You Push The Needle Into Your Vein

Dangerous Game
You're Playing With Your Soul
Devil's Game
You're Under His Control
Now My Friend
It's Time To Break This Evil Game
Now My Friend
It's Time To Break This Circle

The Time Is Short
Your Eyes Are Blind
It's The Devil In Disguise
Hey, Wake Up And Realise
He's Playing His Best Cards
