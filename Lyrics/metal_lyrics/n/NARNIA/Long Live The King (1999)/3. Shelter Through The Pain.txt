On The Road Again
Saturday Morning
10 O'Clock
Snow Is Falling
We Believed In Love
It Should Last Forever
There're So much Whys
That I Can't Understand

Oh My Lord From Heaven Above
Help Me
Oh My Lord From Heaven Above
Give Me Strength To Carry On

Lord Give Me Shelter
Every Night, Every Morning
Lord Give Me Shelter
All Tgrough The Pain
Lord Give Me Shelter
Every Night, Every Morning
Lord Give Me Shelter
All Tgrough The Pain

Let Me See The Light
In The End Of This Tunnel
Oh Lady I Want You Here By My Side
Holding Your Arms
Kissing Your Lips
Feeling Your Body Next To Mine
