I've Been A Drifter For So Many Years
I'm Running Around In Endless Circles
Confusion And Despair
Oh, It's Always There
Oh, Lord Please Take It Away

I Am So Alone
I'm Longing Back For Home
When I Hear The Sound In The Air
In The Air

Far Away, Far Away
I Hear The Distant Call
Far Away, Far Away
It Is The Father's Call
Oh Father, Oh Father
Lost Son Is Coming Home
Oh Father, Oh Father
I'm Coming Back To Stay

I Should Have Listened To Your Words
I Closed The Door And Went My Own Way
So Cold, So Empty
It's Driving Me Insane
Oh Lord, Please Take It Away
