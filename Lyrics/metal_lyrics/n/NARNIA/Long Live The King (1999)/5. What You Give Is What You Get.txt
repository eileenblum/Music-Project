I Can See It Now
I Can See It Clear
You Taught Me What Is Wrong
You Taught Me What Is Right

Oh, When I Hear The Thunder Rise
Thunder From The Storm
I Can See The Lion's Eyes
Hear The Lion's Roar

What You Give Is What You Get
Swallow Your Pride
Before You Die
What You Give Is What You Get
Swallow Your Pride
It Will Eat You Alive

No Matter If You're Black
No Matter If You're White
We Are All The Same
We Have To Do It Right

Oh, When We Hear The Thunder Rise
Thunder From The Storm
We Can See The Lion's Eyes
Hear The Lion's Roar
