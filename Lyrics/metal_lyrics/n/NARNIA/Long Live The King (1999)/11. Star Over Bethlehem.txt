[bonus track]

I see three strangers in the east
Following a big bright star
They search for wisdom
It burns so bright inside their souls
Noone can stop them to reach their goals
They search for answers

Angel voices in the air
Sing their hymn to the King of Kings

Star over Bethlehem
The King is born
Oh, it is a mystery, mystery

I see the world with different eyes
The Son of God has changed my life
He brings salvation

He is the light, he is the way
He is the bridge for our lost mankind
To every nation
