[this song appeared in japanese release]

The sun is shining in my face
Four winds are blowing in my hair

Want to explain what I feel
Want to be with you
Want to explain what I see
When your love breaks through

Can't get enough of you
I know your love is true
Can't get enough of you
Give my heart to you

When I'm lost and lonely
I the night
Lord you give me strength
Give me strength to fight

Want to explain what I feel
Want to be with you
Want to explain what I see
When your love breaks through

Can't get enough of you
I know your love is true
Can't get enough of you
I give my heart to you
