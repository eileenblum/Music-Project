Out on a journey
Out in the fields across the land
Looking for answers
Chasing the wind again

No one can stop me
No one in heaven or on earth
Knowing the answers
Raising my throne for all to see

How long can I hold on
Am I down on my knees again?

In silence, I wonder
From where is my aid to come
Gazing out in the sky
Through deserts I wander
From where is water to flow
Has the river run dry?

Out of the ashes
Into the fire, once again
Will I be wiser
Will I surrender, once again

Yours is the Kingdom
All power and glory to You
Forever and ever
So let it be done, for all to see

Father forgive me
I am down on my knees again
