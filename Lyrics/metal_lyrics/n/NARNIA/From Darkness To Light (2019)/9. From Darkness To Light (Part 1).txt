In this time
We gather around a thousand faces
But do we care?
In this time
We're following a thousand traces
But do we dare?

We carry our dreams in our hearts
For what they were once back in time
Surrounded by emptiness and space,
Denying the void in our hearts

Hanging by a thread, I'm praying
When life has run aground
And winds have turned
I live and I learn through deserts,
Sorrow and despair

Life is frail
Love is pain when night is falling
Bu strong as steel
I hold my breath
Waiting for the phone to ring
Time is standing still

I pray in the night
Seconds like hours, passing by
And she saw the angels standing
By your side

Hanging by a thread, I'm praying
When life has run aground
And winds have turned
I live and I learn through deserts,
Sorrow and despair
Hanging by a thread, I'm praying
I'm begging You to please
Take my hand
I kneel and I trust
In all the promises You gave

I open my eyes
Freed from the burden, carried within
And I thank You
For showing me the way
From darkness to light
