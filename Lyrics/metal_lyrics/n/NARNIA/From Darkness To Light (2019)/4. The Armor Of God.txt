Arrows are flying across the sky
Piercing, sedating the spirit within
The venom is spreading
Our minds go numb
Inhaling a spirit, deceitful disguise

Bring us the light, bring on the fire
In the darkest night, lifting us higher

Put your trust in the Lord
In the strength of the belt of truth
We put on the armor of God
And His righteousness

Shapeshifter, liar, chameleon
So may names, so many costumes
Who has the gift
To distinguish them all?
Now is the time, now is the season
