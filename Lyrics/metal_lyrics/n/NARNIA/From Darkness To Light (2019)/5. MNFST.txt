When black and white
Are mixed to gray
It's time to rise
Unpleasant truths
Are traded for
Comforting lies

Kings and priests
With strings attached
Like marionettes
The walls He built
To keep us safe
Are now seen as a threat

Rise above the ashes
Shine with His living flame
Break the silence
Once and for all

I believe in the Holy Father
Who gave His only Son
I believe in the Holy Spirit
Who raised Him from the dead

A stormy sea
A distant light
To guide us home
A vivid hope
In this world
So monochrome

And endless love
In each drop of blood
How can I be ashamed?
Die from myself
And rise in Him
Born again to proclaim

I'm not ashamed of Jesus
Who gave His life for me
I believe in the resurrection
The King is coming back
