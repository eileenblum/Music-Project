You're the meaning, on You I'm leaning
You're the reason why I'm breathing
Every morning, a new dawning
Every day, another drawing

You have given, I have taken
You sacrificed though I've forsaken
Always learning, always yearning
For Your love, forever reaching forâ¦

You
You are the air that I breathe
You are the truth that I seek
I believe, I believe in You

I've been searching, I've been wanting
Confirmation and affection
Through the fires, my heart's desires
Seeking treasures that I admire

My imperfections and introspections
Through grace and patience,
Transformation
What I deserve, you have bled
Drying all the tears I shed, ohâ¦
