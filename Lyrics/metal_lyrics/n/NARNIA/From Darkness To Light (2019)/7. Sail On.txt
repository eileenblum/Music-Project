Another day goes by
Another lullaby
Another dream that got away
There has been time to cry
There will be time to die
We've all been living the lie
And gone astray

Another wind of change
Another flash of light
Another trend goes by, play the game
Another wicked way
Another blaming game to play
Don't let the flood carry you away

Sail on when tides are rising
Guided by Spirit, the Word,
By the compass
Sail on when winds are changing
One way, eternal, forever and ever

This is the time to kneel
This is the time to heal
What was lost is to be found
Searching high and low for wisdom,
Gold and silver across the land
All shall perish in the end

An ancient, wooden cross
He died and rose for us
Through final sacrifice,
He took our sins
Forgive them for
They know not what they do
Forever lasting, forever free
