They have said the day is coming soon
They have said the day is near now
One day is a thousand years,
A thousand years, one day
Divine perspective
Versus human pride and knowledge
Kingdoms turn to stone
Nations burn at the hand of man

There's a crack in the sky
Knees will bow
As the light blinds our eyes

Come, see the greatest show in history
A rumbling across the sky
Kingdoms turn to stone
Nations burn at the hand of man

There's a crack in the sky
Knees will bow
As the light blinds our eyes
A triumphant return
And from darkness we'll turn
He has come, we have chosen, it's time

Descending from the throne
King of kings and Lord of lords
Mountains are crumbling,
Waves rolling high
From the horizon,
In the blink of an eye
A final crescendo, the tide rises high
He finally opens the gate in the sky
