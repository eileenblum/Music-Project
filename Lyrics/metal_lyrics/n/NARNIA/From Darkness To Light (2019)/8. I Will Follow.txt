Days are passing by
Now I understand
No quick solution,
I've learned my lesson well
Through the motions,
Challenges arise
Fading illusions,
You opened up my eyes

I will follow,
Sing and give my praise
Face tomorrow
I will follow,
Sing and give my praise
No more sorrow

Listen to me now
I've got something to say
Jesus is my King
No matter what they say

I will follow,
Sing and give my praise
Face tomorrow
I will follow,
Sing and give my praise
No more sorrow

I will follow,
Sing and give my praise
Face tomorrow
I live to see your face
I will follow
Sing and give my praise
No more sorrow
Surrender to Your grace
