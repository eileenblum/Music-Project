There was a time, there was a place
We had all that we needed
We gave it all away and got nothing in return but
greed and hollow minds, flat screens and beauty magazines
Come, I will show you who you want to be

Time for reflection
What have I become?
Time for rejection
Enough is enough

When the rain is falling down
When the angels come to free this town
When the rain is falling down
Washing all the dust away

Out on the streets it is cold and I feel so alone
Please let me in, in a second I'll be fine
I want to see, I want to taste, I want to to fill the void
Where am I going to find peace of mind?

Time for reflection
What have I become?
Time for rejection
Enough is enough

When the rain is falling down
When the angels come to free this town
When the rain is falling down
Washing all the dust away

When the rain is falling down
When the angels come to free this town
When the rain is falling down
Washing all the dust away

When the rain is falling down
When the angels come to free this town
When the rain is falling down
