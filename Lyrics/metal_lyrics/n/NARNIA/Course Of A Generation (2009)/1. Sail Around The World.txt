Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning
Sometimes I'm trapped in a hole
I know I need... need Your protection
I wish You could take me back home

Sail around the world
Sailing ships of hope
Storm is coming
I cling to my rope
I'm forgiven
My captain set me free
On the ocean
Shelter me

Sometimes I search for an answer
Inside of my head can find
Nothing that really, really relieves me
From pressure, from guilt and from sin

Sail around the world
Sailing ships of hope
Storm is coming
I cling to my rope
I'm forgiven
My captain set me free
On the ocean
Shelter me

Sail around the world
Sailing ships of hope
Storm is coming
I cling to my rope
I'm forgiven
My captain set me free
On the ocean
Shelter me
