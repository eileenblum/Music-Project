Can you hear them calling?
Can you hear them crying out in hunger?
If I could be strong
Strong enough to face the lie within my life

I turn my head and run
Running for tomorrow
Can't face what I've done

Can you hear me?
Please forgive me!
I cry

Miles away
A million tears away

Look them in their eyes
Tell me can you see the children suffering
And now our world is falling, falling apart
Did we really take our chances?

I turn my head and run
Running for tomorrow
Can't face what I've done

Can you hear me?
Please forgive me!
I cry

Miles away
A million tears away
Miles away
A million tears away

Follow the path
2000 years of wisdom
We're still building castles in the sand
Learn from the past
The time is getting short now
Oh Father, have mercy...on me

Can you hear me?
Please forgive me!
I cry

I turn my head and run
Running for tomorrow
Can't face what I've done

Can you hear me?
Please forgive me!
I cry

Miles away
A million tears away
Miles away
A million tears away
