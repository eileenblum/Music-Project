Can't sleep at night
All I hear is an endless fight
A woman's cry, all is destroyed
Can't sleep at night
All I hear is an endless fight
Call the police to make it calm

The sound fades away
But still it's there
In our memories
Life isn't fair

What can I do
Want to be more like You
I want to be brave
But I'm scared and broken too

Still my heart is trying, trying to survive
I know the colors, I am not blind
But now Your hands are reaching, reaching out to save me
Come my child, you shall be free

The sound fades away
But still it's there
In our memories
Life isn't fair
The sound fades away
And we close our eyes
Pretend it wasn't there
It's easier this way

What can I do
Want to be more like You
I want to be brave
But I'm scared and broken too

What can I do
Want to be more like You
I want to be brave
But I'm scared and broken too

Oh... What can I do
Want to be more like You
I want to be brave
But I'm scared and broken too
