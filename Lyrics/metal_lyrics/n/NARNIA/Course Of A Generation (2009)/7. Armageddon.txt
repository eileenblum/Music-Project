The day has come, they gather here
The fallen angel and his army comes marching out of the deepest pits of hell
They're crossing the rivers, the mountains and sand
Forcing the gates of the holy land

Run away, hide way. The sky is burning
Run away, hide away. Faces turning

Fields of pain, tears of blood
The sword of Christ among the evil legions of the underworld
As they're cast into the lake of fire

Run away, hide way. The sky is burning
Run away, hide away. Faces turning

Run away, hide way. The sky is burning
Run away, hide away. Faces turning

They're crossing the rivers, the mountains and sand
Forcing the gates of the holy land

Run away, hide way. The sky is burning
Run away, hide away. Faces turning

Run away, hide way. The sky is burning
Run away, hide away. Faces turning
