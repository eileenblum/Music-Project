What's the meaning of things, such diamonds and rings
When it all gets so predictable, do you wanna know?
What's the value of life when it's ended by a knife
When it's all so unpredictable, do we even know?

What makes the world go 'round?
What's in a lifetime?

Kings will come and kings will go
He will stay the same, stay the same
Nations rise and nations fall
He will stay the same, stay the same

What do I have to bring when I settle in my coffin
Is there anything I'll need, anything at all?
You have heard of a place where there will be no trace
of those valuable belongings, or did you even know?

What makes the world go 'round?
What's in a lifetime?

Kings will come and kings will go
He will stay the same, stay the same
Nations rise and nations fall
He will stay the same, stay the same

What makes the world go 'round?
What's in a lifetime?

Kings will come and kings will go
He will stay the same, stay the same
Nations rise and nations fall
He will stay the same, stay the same
