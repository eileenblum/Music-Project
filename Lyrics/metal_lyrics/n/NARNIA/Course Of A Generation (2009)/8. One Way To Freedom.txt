How long will we carry on
To destroy what God has given us
Look at yourself, look at the world
All is falling apart
It's time for a change

Unholy rites rule
We play the game and we lose
Evil in fashion, it's time for reaction
We are drifting away from the truth
We're fading away

Pray for protection
Time for reaction

We're burning our bridges
Then wade across the blood-filled rivers
The silence around us, the darkness beneath us
And a thousand miles between us
We're fading away

Pray for protection
Time for reaction

It's time for a change

Pray for protection
Time for reaction

Pray for protection
Time for reaction
