Lock myself up in a cage, my digital domain
Never let me out unless I scream
Nobody wants to listen
In the real world
I'm perfectly happy when I'm...

Climbing higher, higher and higher
Never ever hiding from a storm
Walking through fire
Flying higher, riding higher
Falling deeper than ever before
The curse of a generation

Programming my social skills to suit the latest code
Connected to the network as I go
I don't believe in anything but virtual existence
Never let me out of here, I plead
Nobody wants to listen
In the real world
I'm perfectly happy when I'm...

Climbing higher, higher and higher
Never ever hiding from a storm
Walking through fire
Flying higher, riding higher
Falling deeper than ever before
The curse of a generation

When did we stop talking?
Who have you become?
Is all that we learned for ages to be buried in the sand?

Climbing higher, higher and higher
Never ever hiding from a storm
Walking through fire
Flying higher, riding higher
Falling deeper than ever before
The curse of a generation

Climbing higher, higher and higher
Never ever hiding from a storm
Walking through fire
Flying higher, riding higher
Falling deeper than ever before
The curse of a generation
