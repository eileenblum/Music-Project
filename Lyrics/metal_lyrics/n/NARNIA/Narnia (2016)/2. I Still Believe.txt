A hunger deep inside wakes me up at night
Where are we going
Weâre far away from home
Like a blind leading a blind
We sail away from all responsibilities
Far away from home
Tearing it down stone by stone
Raise an altar of pride, leave the worries behind
I still believe in the Maker
One by one, we all must bow down
I still believe in the Father, the Son and the Fire
Burning on, I still believe
Turning the tide, following the winds of change,
Denying everything we know
Iâve heard enough.
Your silence is deafening to my ears
Did I ever know you?
