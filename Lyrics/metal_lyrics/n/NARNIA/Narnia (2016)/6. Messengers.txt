Eyes everywhere,
Theyâre watching over every move that we make
They follow their orders
Donât let them into your mind
They are prepared to seek and find
They know the hour is late
Believe in me
We are the messengers, hear the ending calling
There is no time to lose, the world is falling
So many eyes are blind
Blinded by a lie
Will You hear me out and follow my orders?
There is one way to go
One for all of us
He paid the price for Your soul
Out of the fire
