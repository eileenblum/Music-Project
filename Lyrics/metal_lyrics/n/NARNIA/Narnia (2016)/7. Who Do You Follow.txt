Are you awake?
Many will fall asleep to the warning sirens
People will die, all for a lie
As they feed it âtil it kills
Soon the day will come
Awaiting the Lionâs return
Mankind - who do you follow?
Maybe heÂ´ll come tomorrow
Priesthood of Sweden, your castles are burning
Down, down, down to the groundâ¦
Reaching for fame
Playing the game, betrayed by the inner circle
No turning back, follow the plan
Pay for freedom, sell your soul
