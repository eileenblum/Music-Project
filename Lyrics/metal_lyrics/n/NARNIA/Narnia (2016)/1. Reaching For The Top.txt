Here we are, weâre on the road again
We travel far, to see your smiling faces
We bring the music, weâll bring the fire
Standing on the solid rock
The spirit takes us higher
We wanna follow, we wanna go
Share the joy, share the living hope
We are the people, we are the crowd
We are rebels and we sail above it all
We rock, we go, weâre reaching for the top
We rock, we go, weâre never gonna stop
We rock, we go, weâre reaching for the top
We rock, we go, weâre never gonna stop
Turn up the music and play it loud
We want to celebrate the victory on the cross
