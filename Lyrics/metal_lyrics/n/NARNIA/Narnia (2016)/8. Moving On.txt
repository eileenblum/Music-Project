Iâm walking through shadows
Is it dream or is it real?
Silence surrounds me, itâs getting lonely
So many days, so many years
On a one way street, facing so many fears
Lord let me rest in your loving arms,
I need you more than ever
God, see my heart, IÂ´m starving for your love
God, let me be a man and follow your plan
IÂ´m moving on
I know the road is long, but Iâm moving on
Where are the people
with burning hearts and souls?
A scattered nation, crumbling to pieces
Who wants to follow? Who wants to go?
Fighting the battle for millions of souls
Lord, send me out, IÂ´m ready to go
A soldier for your kingdom
