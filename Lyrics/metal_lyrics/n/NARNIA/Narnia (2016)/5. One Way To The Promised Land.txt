I see them smile like so many times before
Speaking words of benevolence
Always on your side,
As long as youâre on their side, their pride
Sucked up in the turbulence
Building temples of denial
Down is up and God is out
Rectify thy conscience, leave them all to die
Will we open the gate,
Spread the wings of our faith
Leaving all of our fears and lies behind
Hail the truth, face the lie,
By the cross it must die
There is one, only one way to the promised land
We see them die
Like so many times before.
As values are drifting, night is falling
Never asking âwhy?â
Always bowing to the latest truth
