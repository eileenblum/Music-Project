I still remember the day when
I gave my heart and my soul
Once and for all for the kingdom
Today Iâm so grateful, still the mission is clear
I want to be in GodÂ´s mystery
Follow the way to eternity
Come with me
You will see
Freedom in Christ, for you and me
We were all meant to be
By His holy majesty
Fire, set the world on fire
Shaking the heavens, the sea and the land
Setting us our souls free
No matter the ages, Godâs kingdom will last
The power of faith, a God given gift for us all
The flame of creation, the show must go on
Heaven is open for all
You just got to believe
