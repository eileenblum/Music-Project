Thank You for creation
Thank You for Your grace
Thank You for the blood, shed upon the cross
For showing us Your way, The way
I see, I need, I trust, I change
Whenever I am near You
Lead me through the night
As darkness falls, as seasons change
Your love remains as others turn away
Whenever I am near You
Lead me through the night
Thank You for the shield of faith
Thank You for the sword
Thank You for the steel,
Dividing right from wrong
For showing us the way
I see, I need, I trust, I change
Whenever I am near You
Lead me through the night
As darkness falls, as seasons change
Your love remains as others turn away
Whenever I am near You
Lead me through the night
