Follow me! Follow who? What is new?
Will I ever know?
Iâm seeking confirmation, participation,
A broader vision
Finding out the latest truth
Twenty years ago the call
To be a voice for the man who gave it all
Jesus Christ, The son of God
The solid rock The LionÂ´s roar
We are here through it all
Get up, cry out on the highest mountain
Weâre not ashamed, not afraid to fall
Stand up and fight for the truth of ages
Let us declare freedom, One for all
Read your bible, say a prayer
For your brother, itâs time to care
We all need salvation
On high horses, weÂ´re riding high
Riding blind, but still we try
Time for redemption
