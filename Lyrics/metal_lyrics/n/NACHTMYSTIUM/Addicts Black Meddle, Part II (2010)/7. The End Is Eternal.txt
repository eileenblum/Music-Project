I came that night
To purge life from me
I plunged the devils claw
Injected fear
You shivered that night
Something was crying
Then in the daylight
We didn't speak
I hold the answers
Now to detach
Now to sever
The unborn from you

Hunted down and taken out
All life's waste
Hidden down in the dirt
In small graves
Residues of our old faith
Gone to die
Left with pathetic dust
And your cries

Bury your sadness
Unchain your grief
The needles are in
The end is eternal

Some blood in the first months
Then just ghosts
