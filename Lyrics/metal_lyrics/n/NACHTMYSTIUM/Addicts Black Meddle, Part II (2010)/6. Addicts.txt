Death walks in my shadow
Always drawing close
Always here to offer
What haunts me the most
I look him in the eye
Hollowed out by lies

Make me see
Like before
All I want
Is more
Come with me
I want yours
All we need
Is more

I know lots of secrets
Some of them are true
Some of them are gospel
Sermons of abuse
From my point of view
I know more than you

Make me see
Like before
All I want
Is more
Come with me
I want yours
All we need
Is more
