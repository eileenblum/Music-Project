We are not your leaders
We are not your friends
We are thieves and cheaters
We live at the end

We don't want your loyalty
We reject your trust
We ignore your sympathy
We do what we must

Don't you want to die?
Don't you want to die?
If you see us coming, step aside
We are hellbound and high

Don't you want to die?
Don't you want to die?
If you see us coming, step aside
We are hellbound and high

Hate!

Still in control
Down in this hole
Still in control
Down in this
Down in this hole
