Fucked up
Strung out
World without color
Details are vague
Blacked out
Done in
Never making contact
No more to exchange

Used up
Bled out
Born below the land
Returned to feast
Let down
Burned up
Face down in dirt
Lie again with beasts

Unknown to the eye
Pure and petrified
Laid unto the ground
Unburied yet unfound

Shot up
Gone down
Living in a trance
And with no others
Shut out
Locked in
From a chosen grave
Return to mother

Unknown to the eye
Pure and petrified
Laid unto the ground
Unburied yet unfound

I run to you
In rivers
I reach to you
From the soil
