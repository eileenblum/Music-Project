This is the exit
I'm always lost below
Unwashed and callous
Between unholy waves
Eyes never close
Hands are black and cracked
I choose my poison
May not see me again

This is the answer
I'm living lost again
Rewind electric terror
Indulge our dying end
Drown down in ice
Just to keep my stomach full
Cursed to levitate
My spell is chemical

Nightfall
I'm cursed again
Nightfall
May it never end

Nightfall
I'm cursed again
Nightfall
May it never end

I am the wizard
I live in hell you know
You will never see me
But I exist below
