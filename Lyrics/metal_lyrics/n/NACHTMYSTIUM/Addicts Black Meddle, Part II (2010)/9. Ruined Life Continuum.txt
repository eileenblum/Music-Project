Today I awaken
To an empty room
Here we find no love
As my storm gathers
I slept behind a mask
Lied into your heart
In time you'll get nothing
My new enemy

All the lies
Rising high
This has to end
But I can't tell you when
Take your time
Take all mine
Then one day
We may be safe again

Ruined I awaken
In illusion's tomb
And just for a moment
I remember you
You followed me too close
And pried me loose
Today I'm not me
Are you still right here?

All the lies
Rising high
This has to end
But I can't tell you when
Take your time
Take all mine
Then one day
We may be safe again
