Over and over
Ruling my mind
A veil for depression
A fix for my eyes
Out of the city
Into the house
Up through my hallway
To force itself
To force itself down

Down in the night
It's taking me
Down in the night
It's keeping me
Down in the night
It's here with me
Down in the night
And I want it all

Older and older
Fooled more than twice
Used up my chances
Ruined my life
Never a reason
No one around
Nothing can stop me
From drinking it
From drinking it down

Down in the night
It's taking me
Down in the night
It's keeping me
Down in the night
It's here with me
Down in the night
And I want it all
