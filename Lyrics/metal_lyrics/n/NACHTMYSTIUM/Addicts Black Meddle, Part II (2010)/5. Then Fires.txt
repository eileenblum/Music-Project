Something has awakened
Now we call to hell
Smoke from pits
Loves my lungs
Wanting to be punished
Now we fall to earth
Time to hide
And forget

Another night inside
Another day denied
The hunger to burn
Take the light away
We destroy the day
In darkness we burn

Something starts to flicker
Crawl inside your flame
Scald your skin
Lick you bare
Reaching out to sorrow
Leave your borrowed life
Live your pain
Love your stench

I always knew
There was nothing
Standing in my way
And no one knew
I was waiting
To take away the day

Another night inside
Another day denied
The hunger to burn
Take the light away
We destroy the day
In darkness we burn

I always knew
There was nothing
Standing in my way
And no one knew
I was waiting
To take away the day
