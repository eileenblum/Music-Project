Alone
In a world far from home
To slip away
No one can find me here
Surrounded by emptiness
Depravity and fear

Flowing through me
Miasma of ecstasy
Never run never hide
Never leave me
Out of all of you
Destroy you, become you, my new slave
My new slave

In these rooms
A bitter-sweetness
Transcend the world
And all its ugliness
Rode alone
Cry unknown
Die alone

Flowing through me
Miasma of ecstasy
Never run never hide
Never leave me
Destroy you, become you, my new slave
My new slave
