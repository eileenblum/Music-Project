These truths in me, break through what lies may bring.
Inside of me, sometimes I fail to see the worth in me
Buried far too deep...locked in this dream, so sinister it seems.

Left this world, no one cared
I have escaped
Lost my hope...forgot my pride
My soul has died
I lived the lie.

We walk our paths, by our own fashioned plans
Creating a world from what barely can make sense
I know you can! Forsee what life commands
Why should I agree to such vacuos demands?

Left this world, no one cared
Lost my hope, forgot my pride
My soul has died

Even when our roads end, life continues it's advance
Shall I stand by and wait....for the few friends I have?
Transcend this pale dream, if I may be complete
Fall back into time
To only promote another lie.

Left this world, no one cared
Lost my hope, forgot my pride
My soul has died
Borrowed hope...and broken dreams

This can not be the final home for me
Somehow I know something better awaits me
Yet still I'm lost...in this dream
Lost.....in this dream
Lost.....in this dream
