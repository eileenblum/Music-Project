I am no one
I am ruined
A hollow void
Inhuman discrepancy

Through this window
Life passes by
Trapped inside myself
With nowhere to hide
I am alone here
In no place
My world burns
This world burns

Isolated in destitutes
A leper upon this world
Miserable vermin
A pathetic worm
No words now
No one cares
Extinguish this life
Your time has come

Through this window
Life passes by
Trapped inside myself
With nowhere to hide
I am alone here
In no place
My world burns
This world burns

(sample)
We have to see, we have to know
We have to see, we have to know
We have to see, we have to know
We have to see, we have to know

I am no one
I am ruined
A hollow void
A shallow discrepancy
I am no one
I am ruined
I am no one
I am ruined

Through this window
Life passes by
Trapped inside myself
With nowhere to hide
I am alone here
In no place
My world burns
This world burns
