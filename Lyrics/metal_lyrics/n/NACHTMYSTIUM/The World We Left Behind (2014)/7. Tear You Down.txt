You didn't see me coming, and you never will
I am the poison apple, the forbidden fruit
Come, eat from the tree
It will nourish your soul
Take your fill... I am now in total control

You're in my world now...
A place of mystery
Where there is no free will
Destroying you... it's me
Come... walk with me
Down this path to greatness!
Where you'll live forever... I promise
This is mine, this is me! Tear you down, set you free

Can't you see my greatness? My wrath? My prey...
Tear you down! Set you free!
Tear you down! Set you free!
Tear you down! Set you free!
Tear you down! Set you free!

Can't you see my greatness? My wrath? My prey!
Tear you down! Set you free!
Tear you down! Set you free!
Tear you down! Set you free!
Tear you down! Set you free!

Can't you see my greatness? My wrath? My prey!
Tear you down! Set you free!
Tear you down! Set you free!
Tear you down! Set you free!
Tear you down! Set you free!

Tear you fucking down!!!
