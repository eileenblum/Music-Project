On the other side I have survived
Didnât think it be
The hardest path Iâve ever walked
Alive again, alive as me

A frequal journey
I wish I never known
Lost myself
Lost everything
Lost my soul

On the other side I have survived
Didnât think it be
The hardest path Iâve ever walked
Alive again, alive as me

Trapped in mental [?] place
For too many years
Never going back
Never going fucking back
I am free

On the other side I have survived
Didnât think it be
The hardest path Iâve ever walked
Alive again, alive as me

No more sickness
No more struggle
Canât believe I did this
But today itâs gone

On the other side I have survived
Didnât think it be
The hardest path Iâve ever walked
Alive again, alive as me
