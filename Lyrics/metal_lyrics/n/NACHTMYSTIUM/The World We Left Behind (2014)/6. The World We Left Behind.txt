The hours came
The decision was made
To leave this all forever

[Chorus:]
The world we left behind
All we loved
All we held
The world we left behind
Gone now...
As we dive into hell

An abyss opens wide
Just before my eyes
An endless darkness
An absent space

[Chorus]

Black horizon dawns
On a highway to nowhere
Whore it leads no one knows
But were never coming home

[Chorus]
