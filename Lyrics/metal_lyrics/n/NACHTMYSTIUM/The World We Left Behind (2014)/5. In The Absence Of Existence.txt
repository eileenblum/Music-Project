No grace, no love
No anything, no eternal muse
I'm here in fear
No light, no joy
Every day, the same
This life is no life
Faced with fire, diseased, I cry

Never a moment to be away
Trapped in this absence of existence
Hidden away, alone I pray for a quick death every day
Never a moment to get away
Locked in this absence of existence
Out of the way, day after day
Withering away to nothing

Extinct, burned out. Nothing to talk about
Wasting away, losing time
Dying inside every day am I
Why am I still here?

Never a moment to be away
Trapped in this absence of existence
Hidden away, alone I pray for a quick death every day
Never a moment to get away
Locked in this absence of existence
Out of the way, day after day
Withering away to nothing
