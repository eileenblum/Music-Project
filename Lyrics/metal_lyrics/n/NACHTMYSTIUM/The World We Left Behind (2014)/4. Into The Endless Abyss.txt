The demon has awaken once again
Slumberness, he has risen
Taking my hand, together we walk
To the same old ground... to bring me down

This does not end
Find yourself alone again
Crippling pain endless unrest
Never are you to sleep again

This lonely place where I find a twisted peace
Lurking in the shadows, away from all life
It is always here for me... it is always here for me...

This does not end
Find yourself alone again
Crippling pain endless unrest
Never are you to sleep again

The immortal fell into this mortal hell...
When will you see?
This life can not be...
And when you open your eyes...
Witness the devastation of deception and lies
The immortal fell... into this mortal hell...
