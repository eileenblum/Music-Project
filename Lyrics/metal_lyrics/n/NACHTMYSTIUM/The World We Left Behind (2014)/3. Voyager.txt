Through all these years, after enduring so much
Place after place, month after month
Taking a moment to reflect
To decide what is next

Here I stand, a mere fragment in time
Is any of this real? Is this not all a lie?
Trampled and crushed, risen and praised
This never-ending journey is a constant maze
Striding along, year after year
This is my calling, there is no fear
Go at it alone, if I must!
No one can never take away this lust!

The vicious cycle of reverence
A hellish ride of deceit
Never know who to trust
Will you be here tomorrow or disappear into time and dust?

Here I stand, a mere fragment in time
Is any of this real? Is this not all a lie?
Trampled and crushed, risen and praised
This never-ending journey is a constant maze
Striding along, year after year
This is my calling, there is no fear
Go at it alone, if I must!
No one can never take away this lust

Here I stand, a mere fragment in time
Is any of this real? Is this not all a lie?
Trampled and crushed, risen and praised
This never-ending journey is a constant maze
Striding along, year after year
This is my calling, there is no fear
Go at it alone, if I must!
No one can never take away this lust
