After the storm, he rises from the ashes
Lust, soulless being
Into the unknown, he roams
Vengefully seeking, stolen time

Fireheart! Blazing bright
Fireheart! Resurrected this night
Fireheart! Reborn
Fireheart! Tearing down this world of scorn

I've returned...from the lowest realms
Taken a journey through my own personal hell

This knowledge is gained, this pride is earned
From walking the forbidden line and embracing the fucking burn

Nothing of this world can stop me
Leprous, underling serfs...
You can't kill this iron strong will
Beneath and below...eternally
