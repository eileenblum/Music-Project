You and me
My hatred possible
You are my angerâs perfection

All my life
Your true enemy
To bend and break
Burn your temples
Know this now
I never sleep
End your faith
Crush your chapels

I will never betray myself
Never understand your tongue
I make negative
Each molecule

All my life
Your true enemy
To bend and break
Burn your temples
Know this now
I never sleep
End your faith
Crush your chapels

In sickness, in madness
I take my place in line
Not sorry, not guilty
I make you pay for life

In sickness, in madness
I take my place in line
Not sorry, not guilty
I make you pay for life

This moment
Is over
Your oxygen

All my life
Your true enemy
To bend and break
Burn your temples
Know this now
I never sleep
End your faith
Crush your chapels
