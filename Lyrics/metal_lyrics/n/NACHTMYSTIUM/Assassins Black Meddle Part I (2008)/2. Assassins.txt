I am everything and no one
Deprave the son
And reigning king

We feel nothing
And are nothing
Travelling elitists
Rejecting weakness
We stand alone
Pride does not die
Kings in your dreams
Slaves to this nightmare

Spat upon
And aged
Yet hailed
Glorious the truth

We feel nothing
And are nothing
Travelling elitists
Rejecting weakness
We stand alone
Pride does not die
Kings in your dreams
Slaves to this nightmare

In the eyes of emotion
Injected with lifeâs poison
Kings of your dying
Feeding this world

We feel nothing
And are nothing
Travelling elitists
Rejecting weakness
We stand alone
Pride does not die
Kings in your dreams
Slaves to this nightmare
