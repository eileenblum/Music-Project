When the doctor returns
Tell him I care
Now take these tubes out
When the medicine drops
Into the vein
I pull this plug free
This prescription
Force-fed freedom
In the thick of the night
Chewing a bone
No meat to mark you
This prescription
Force-fed freedom
Itâs a fatal mistake
To rest on gold
What else do you have
Now give me your drugs
Because itâs time
To take hell home
This prescription
Force-fed freedom
This prescription
Freedom fucked
