[Moonblood Cover]

The Gates of Eternity are open
And they'll be eternity
Try to run without fear of the gate
Death awaits you
Try to run to the woods, from the gates of eternity
Their life will never end
You are trapped here forever
You can never leave this world
You can never move to the master
The offering, the sounding
Trapped in the world of darkness
In the realm of ruin
Open the dimension of eternity
