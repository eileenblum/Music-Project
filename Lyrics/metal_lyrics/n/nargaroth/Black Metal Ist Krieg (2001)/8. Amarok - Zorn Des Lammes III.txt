I have seen the wrath of the land,
as I wandered like a wolf among the sheep.
I was a part of the wrath of the lamb,
so I am a part of the wolf.
Oh I am the wolf, oh I am the lamb,
so I am (fuck) Satan and I'm (fuck) God.
Call me now Judas or call me insane,
I am what I am, I'm just a men/man.
Call me now Judas or call me insane,
I am what I am, I'm just a men/man.
Fuck yeah, arrghh...
I am a men/man.
