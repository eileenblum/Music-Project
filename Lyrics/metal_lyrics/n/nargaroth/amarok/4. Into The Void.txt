Once I walked through dark forests
As I saw a flame into the sky
Fascinated, I was staring into the gallery of lights

I don't noticed the creature behind me
So fascinated I was from the flames
It bit me into my neck
But the flames in the sky, protected me from death
And the power and the curse has gone into me

From this day, every man in my live died
I knew the reason, Me! Me!
But I handle it as gift
And so I create a void around me
'til every man died

So, I must be carefully
'cos no must know something about
My little romance with the flames in the sky....

I will kill you too..
