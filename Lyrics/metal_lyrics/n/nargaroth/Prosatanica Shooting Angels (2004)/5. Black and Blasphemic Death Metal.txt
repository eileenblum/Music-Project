Black Blasphemic Death Metal
is flowing through my Veins.
Black Blasphemic Death Metal
tears apart the Chains.

Black Blasphemic Death Metal
black Snow on my Grave.
Black Blasphemic Death Metal
I'm your devoted Slave.

Black Blasphemic Death Metal
immortal Fruit of Sin.
Black Blasphemic Death Metal
the wolf that sleeps within (us).

Demons whispers dark Desires,
deep inside my Soul.
The Whisper calls to me to kill the,
Faces outside me.

Crying Shadows still infesting,
me in silent Nights.
Takes away my mortal Spirit,
I hide inside my Art.

I will hide my mortal Spirit inside
Black and Blasphemic Death Metal.
