What may there a Shadow think,
once beside of God.
Sure he got his own domain,
he set a Throne in Hell.
But Hell is far away from Heaven,
so far away from Love of God.
The Memory starts to wither,
that he once got loved.
Now Hate he spread above his Throne,
(but) deep inside his Heart he feels alone.
(And) sometimes in the pale Light of the Night,
you might see a Tear in the face of Satan.

Who will wipe away the Tear in the Face of Satan?
Hate and Destruction,
may be his Shield to hide,
the Pain he kept so deep inside,
the Sadness he cries out at Night.

On the broken Sword before him,
dries the Tears he sheet in Aeons.
Behind all this inhumanity,
he is human as we are!
