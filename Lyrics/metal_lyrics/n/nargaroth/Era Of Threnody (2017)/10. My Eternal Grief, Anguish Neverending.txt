When all is said and all sins done
Each promise broken all vowed undone
When all I'm left with are sore regrets
Drifting and sleepless in empty beds.

And when that rock there becomes your throne
To cry upon him weep all alone
Now I'm a nomad condemned to walk alone
To face my wrong decisions that I never can disown.

Can't stay in no town as they're all named for you
Just walk to where the stone fell that I feebly threw
The world is now my home but here I cannot stay
And like the stars we once glanced at I slowly fade away.

Our fears and daemons in the shadows lurk and hide
To resize upon us in sleepless hours of the night
And they will remain feeding from the tears we shed
O despite how often we look underneath our bed.

Hell is indeed no place where we go
But something deep within us that dwells and viciously grows
You're shooting at me selfish bullets that you spew
But still I keep running keep on running towards you.

My eternal grief, anguish never-ending
