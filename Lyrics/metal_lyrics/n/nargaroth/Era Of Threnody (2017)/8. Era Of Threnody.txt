Let all I have lived
Be as if it were a dream
And anoint me with the dew
From Lethe's stream.
New scars don't exist
'Cause they are all the same,
They only to obied
Is their changing name.
Lethe, thy will
Shalt cometh and slay
The insane pikes
In the sewer of my soul away.
Chaos and order
Aren't opposite states
They're toys of a child
That it loves and it hates.
In the grave
No woman you crave
At Acheron's shore
To Elysium you soar.
That I shall forget
An old yesterdays grief
And that this threnody
Inheres my woe's relief.
O come, o death
Your brother of sleep
Take me away from
My woe and weep.
Sometimes we fall in love
With a snake of lies
But believe her everything when in
Her womb our head rest and lays.
There is nothing worse
Than to live in your own trials
As to tread nomadic
In anguish haunted miles.
(Clean)
Like a falling star
I wither away,
Silently burn
In an unobserved sky
