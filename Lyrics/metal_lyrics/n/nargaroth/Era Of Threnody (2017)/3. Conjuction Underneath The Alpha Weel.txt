Strangers that I paid to drive me
Through town that I conjunct with thee.
Gambling on a backwoods race
Throughout Vegas' asphalt maze.

One ways, driven upside down
While we crazy raced through town.
Drunk wife of the driver shout
From the backseat scolding loud.

Whispers in the desert winds
Mock me and disguise my sense.
Hasten straight ahead my fate
Through a town that's crying desolate.

Driven by a dead man's hope
Balance on a hang man's rope.
Misguided by will-o'-the-wisp
Wonder why and what's the gist.

Like springs first breath of air
That gently dances with your hair.
Like a summer solstice glare
So you appeared.

Like a prelude to a kiss
That inhere eternal bliss,
It broke the seal to my abyss
Where alas! I lingered.

The blossoms bloomed alive
And my heart stopped for a while,
When the heavens light beguiled
Me when we met...

...underneath the Alpha Wheel
Where all lies became unreal
And the maidens kiss conceal
All the woe that cometh forth
