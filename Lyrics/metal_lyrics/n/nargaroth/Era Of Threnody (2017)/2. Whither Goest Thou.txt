Don't cry my bedlam
Your lost son must go
I take your song with me
Your tears and your woe

So I'm drawn to the world
That's neither strange nor home
And crave for tomorrow
And the paths that I'll roam

I wander where stars fell
And sleep where they die
I dream where the norns sings
And where wise cranes fly

In depths of the oceans
My cursed name I hide
That no one may find it
And no woe betide

I see my grandam
That worried tears shed
Feel her withered hands
That laid on my head

I still hear her old voice
And the old Russian song
That she sung to my heart
And I carried along

I harked to far cries
The tongue of despair
The language of sinners
All humans shall err!

I howl with the arch-wolves
In silvery night
The aegis of the north star
Sets our fate alight

Ah, linger on now
Oh' thou art so fair
Shalt purify my soul
In northern lights glare

Nero once burned down
What had to rebuild
And buried in madness
The ruins of guilt

We might burn our life path
And leave all behind
But what makes us sinners
Will stay in our mind

Into the blistering wilderness, the man now walks alone. A forsaken man without a country, without a hope; his soul in turmoil like the hot winds and raging sands. He is driven forward, always forward, by a god unknown, toward a land unseenâ¦

The essence of life
Means "if", as we know
This wisdom may decide
If we rule or bow below

I'll tear off the Cain's mark
And drink from a sylph
At war with the world now
At war with myself

Into the molten wilderness of sin where granite sentinels stand as towers of living death to bar his way. Each night brings the black embrace of loneliness. In the mocking whisper of the wind, he hears the echoing voices of the dark. His tortured mind wondering if they call the memory of past triumphs or wail foreboding of disasters yet to come or whether the desert's hot breath has melted his reason into madness...
