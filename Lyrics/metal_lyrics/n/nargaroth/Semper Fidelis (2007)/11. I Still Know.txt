I still know what Black Metal is all aboutI still know what Black Metal is all aboutBlood, fire and painA fight with daemons in your Soul I still know what Black Metal is all aboutI still know what Black Metal is all aboutBlood, fire and painA black flame that burns inside Black Vinyl, demo tapes,Carries sounds and ancient spells.Black leather, Jeans patch coat,Boots, spikes, black long hair.
