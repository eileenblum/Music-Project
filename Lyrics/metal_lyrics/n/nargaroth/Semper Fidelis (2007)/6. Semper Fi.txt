Wherever I may roamWherever I am homeI take this art with meIn all eternity Wherever I will bleedMy faith I always keepMy visions only leadMe to my art, my own creed Wherever then I dieBuried and rotten lieWhenever my mom will cryBlack Metal - Semper Fi If ever I should failWith Pequod all oceans I'll sailAs Ahab I chase The WhaleThrough my occult veil
