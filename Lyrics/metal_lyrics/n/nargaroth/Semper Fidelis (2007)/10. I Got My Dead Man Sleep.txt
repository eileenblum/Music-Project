I got my dead man sleepI lived as wolf among the sheep With screaming hate I hide the tearBut at night my daemons made me fear I laid me down in autumn rainA man should not live in shame I sleep underneath red leafThe maple's gift to hide my grief I was the Ahab of my lifeMy wrath was my love and my wife I hunt through oceans for The WhaleTo burden him with wrath and fail While I dream I wither awayI'll never see the spring in May The wolves will dig out all my bonesThey scattered rot between the Stones My rest seems now calm and deepFinally I got my dead man sleep
