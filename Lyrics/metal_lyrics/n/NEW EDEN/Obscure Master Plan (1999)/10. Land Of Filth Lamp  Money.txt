So work hard now all you naives
The master screams at his slaves
The time has come to rise 
and break all these evil ties
The mighty dollar lies to all 
except their kind, kind

Now Egypt's pharaoh's rage
Will keep our people caged 
our secrets sealed for now
And all our mysteries untold
It angers Gods of old 
their praise to money grows

They bide their time with wealth and wine
They've sold their souls their greed foretold
They live for gold do as they're told
They trade their lives and sell their very soul

And will you run to join them 
when filth and money call to you
And will your riches save you 
or will your heart then stay true

Should death come quick before you know
What riches will you show
Your days in life are the treasures that you own

You fools your greed has made it's home
Your filth and money roam through the world
And to the hearts of those alone

And now the nations need all their trades
Our loving nature fades 
our filth and greed now shows
To pay the reapers toll 
our emptiness now flows
Our lust for money grows

They bide their time with wealth and wine
They've sold their souls, their greed foretold
They live for gold do as their told
They trade their lives and sell their very soul
