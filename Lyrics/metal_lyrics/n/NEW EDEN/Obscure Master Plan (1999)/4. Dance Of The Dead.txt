As I look in soulless eyes
And I see the soul-les animate
The paths in our lives
And the pass to our certain fate

Their visions of wealth
Seem to kill their sense of righteousness
No remorse is felt
As they dance with their loneliness

And they believe in the dark
And the dark just believes in it's dead
The dead just believe in the...

Dance the path
That leads the road of selfishness
None feel the wrath
As your soul reaches hollowness

And you serve the pit of greed
As you reach a realm of consciousness
You give the life you bleed
Where all you hear is nothingness

And they believe in the dark
And the dark just believes in it's dead
The dead just believe in the dance... DANCE!

Their visions of wealth
Seem to kill their sense of righteousness
No remorse is felt
As they dance with their loneliness

They dance as they follow the dark
The dark it just follows the dead
The dead they just follow the Dance of the Dead
