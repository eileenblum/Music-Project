As I sit and journal my life 
I wish on my dying breathe
That we as one won a new day 
for this world upon my death
Time sleeps on forever these words 
the last words I'll say

Read my epitaph - heed my epitaph

Light shines on my death-bed 
a last wish is to write
These secrets that I give you 
are for all of mankind
Before I sleep on forever 
heed these words, learn the truth

Read my epitaph - heed my epitaph

Reason foretold - season of old

My words will tell my world your hell
My words will tell my world your hell

Fearless ending darkness goodbye
Feeling empty my turn to die

Bravely ending my light goodbye
Feeling empty my turn to die

Read my epitaph - heed my epitaph

Leaving this world reason for all
