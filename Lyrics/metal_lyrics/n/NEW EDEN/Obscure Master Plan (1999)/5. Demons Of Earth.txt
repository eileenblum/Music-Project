Heed these words of Satan's breed
They walk the earth Humanity's Evil seed

Casey waits while Manson leads
Ramirez hates while Dalmer feeds

Tonight a freedom with you a season
To kill a reason your blood is my thrill

Zodiac and Forty-Four
They kill for fun, there is no cure

Tonight a freedom with you a season
To kill a reason your blood is my thrill

Oh bleed for me
I feel tonight, I kill tonight
I stalk the night, I walk the night

Oh die for me
I need tonight, I am the night

Please stay with me I'll relieve your pain
Please don't you run I'm not insane

I need to take your life tonight
It makes me feel that I'm all right
I need to take a life tonight
I feel I'm born to kill tonight

Now we see just what they've done
Can we believe till we're the one

Tonight a freedom with you a season
To kill a reason your blood is my thrill
