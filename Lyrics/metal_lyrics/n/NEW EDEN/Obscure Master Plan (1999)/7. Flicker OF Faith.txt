In the end when you have no place to go
you will usually find faith 
even if it's just a flicker?

You live life without hope 
you hang yourself without a rope
You're shallow and faithless 
you follow the soulless

Then one day fate tempts you 
faced with death it wakes you
Then suddenly you scream out 
and realize the name you shout

Then, then you'll see That Faith, faith is free

And is your life complete 
are you safe when you sleep
And does your mind surmise 
that your soul without it cries

You fall down you blame yourself 
your fame fades remake yourself
Your family rejects you, 
you realize faith's with you

Then the faith you see will set, 
will set you free

This is the life you need 
to believe in what you see
And does your soul surmise 
that your mind without it cries

Live life never ending journey 
now take one day at a time
Your faith should be forever burning 
when your soul is on the line

Your mind's now open 
your eyes now see the flickers of faith!

You tear down the only walls 
you walk on you heed the call
You follow and scream out 
you realize the name you shout

Then, then you'll see that faith, 
faith is free

And is your life complete 
are you safe when you sleep
And does your mind surmise 
that your soul without it cries
