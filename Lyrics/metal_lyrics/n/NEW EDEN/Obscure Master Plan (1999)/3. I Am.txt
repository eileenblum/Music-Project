Falling into life's abyss 
fate decides the mortal's test
Hands that rule eternity 
I Am the one the one to be

Self it lasts infinitely 
but your life it counts you see
Leave your thoughts and bring your soul
It's you for whom the bell it tolls.

This is who I am free of ruling hand
This is who I am who I am

Take a chance and live your fate - take a chance
You'll never know until it's late -it's too late
Leave your hate open the doors -leave your hate
Destiny it can be yours -destiny

Hands of time reality universe eternity
Enter realms of the damned
Never really understand "I AM"

This is who I am free of ruling hand
You are who I am who I am
