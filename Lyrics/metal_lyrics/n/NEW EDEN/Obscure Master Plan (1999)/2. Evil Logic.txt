Invention watch as we grow
Business a profit must show

Evil Logic

Teaching at twice the pace
Religion @ cyberspace

Technology will you save us
Internet in which we all trust

Cyberspace

Running faster and longer
Sailing into our future

Technology please are you with us
Internet cyber-god we trust

All we are-science All we see-evil
All we know-logic All we see-evil

For machine or man kill them if you can
Machines now rule our land read out reads the end

Flying as fast as we can
Raping our only land

Technology don't you need us
Internet Devil's incubus

All we are-science All we see-evil
All we know-logic All we see-evil

For machine or man kill them if you can
Machines now rule our land readout reads the end
