Deep inside I have all these feelings
They've been with me since my creation
I drink, and hope to drown all these sorrows
If I don't there'll be no tomorrows

The shots I drank they just haven't helped me
Still I have this fire inside me
I drown myself with bottles of liquor
The flames they rise higher and higher, 
Higher-Higher

This life gives me nothing but trouble
It's so insane I'm feeling so helpless
My loyal companion you know how to help me
Where are you? I need you so badly

The shots I drank they just haven't helped me
Still I have this fire inside me
I drown myself with bottles of liquor
The flames they rise higher and higher, 
Higher-Higher
