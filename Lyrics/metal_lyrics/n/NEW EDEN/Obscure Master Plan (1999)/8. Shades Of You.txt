Love and vision is what I see in you
The mirror an image a reflection of truth

Oh feel the pain in me; 
oh I knew this love wouldn't be

Please make it stay, the love you have shown
Please give me the words to say today

Please don't go. Stay with me today.

Tender words can't express 
what I feel deep inside for you
A song, a scent that reminds me 
our love was true

Oh take this pain from me; 
oh I knew love wasn't free

Please make her stay, a love, 
a love that will grow
Please give me the words to say today

Please don't go. Stay with me today.

Violence, screaming, memories, bleeding
Silence, screaming, feeling, reeling

Oh shades of you; they are all
Of you. Oh shades of you

Sirens, screaming, dying, breathing
Visions, reason, faithless, season
Silence, bleeding, memories, screaming

Oh shades of you; they are all
Of you. Oh shades of you, oh!!
