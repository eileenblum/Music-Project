I now begin my final descent, eternal voyage into the void
In form of spirit I've been set free, no start or finish just eternal breath

False truths, true lies are here revealed, no coin or mortal here to lie

A place for thought and my final rest, a place for laughter, devoid of tears
Replaced by knowledge are all the words, scripture and verses now speak to me

Reveal you essence, unveil your face, unbind my vision, bequeath me sight
Kingdoms and empires reclaimed by dust, tomorrow's ruins forged in your blood

The rhymes and riddles hide your name, divides and separates all men of blood

One final scream and one final breath, cried out in thunder by all in fire
In common planes here, returned to you, I look upon our past life and plead to you

NO ILL INTENT WAS MEANT
ALL SIGHT BLINDED BY DARK
NO ILL INTENT IS MEANT
PAST BLOOD HAS PAID THE PRICE

And now the Earth's center has opened up, gone are all things of yesterday
And life seems to be frozen in your time, the steps of the wicked cut down
And life seems to speak and call out our name, but time pushes on eternally
One final breath then begins our descent, into obscurity we fall

The rhymes and riddles hide your name, divides and separates all men of blood

One final scream and one final breath, cried out in thunder by all in fire
In common planes here returned to you, I look upon our past life and plead to you

NO ILL INTENT WAS MEANT
ALL SIGHT BLINDED BY DARK
NO ILL INTENT IS MEANT
PAST BLOOD HAS PAID THE PRICE

NO ILL INTENT WAS MEANT
ALL SIGHT BLINDED BY DARK
NO ILL INTENT IS MEANT
PAST BLOOD HAS PAID THE PRICE
