From my first move to my last breath my life predefined
There is no escape
A pointless fight and aimless sight an endless fight for life
There is no escape

Your eyes mystifying me
Your words hypnotizing me
Your mind mesmerizing me
Your hold ever reaching lie

I am not your soldier-sent to kill in vein
I am not your soldier-I won't march without a name

A pawn for the king
A pawn for the king

Our lives always expendable
Our blood flowing towards the sea
Our dreams trapped in your light
Our souls damned to be damned

I am not your soldier-sent to kill in vein
I am not your soldier-I won't march without a name

ohh.......ohh..
.......ahh.......ahh

But what will our kind conquer and what will fools create
What will we hold as truth that allows the lie to age

Your eyes mystifying me
Your words hypnotizing me
Your mind mesmerizing me
Your hold ever reaching lie

I am not your soldier-sent to kill in vein
I am not your soldier-I won't march without a name

A pawn for the king
A pawn for the king
