With souls encased in steel, we climb into forbidden skies
We thrust into new realms, inseminate and desecrate

Ever seeing eyes, look deep into infinity
The ever-knowing minds, make paths and lead us into our demise
One true agenda, to claim the sun, and claim all that is nameless
Our hidden meaning, lost in the stars, our aim displaced by our greed

Lost in our vanity, sold to insanity
We are chosen, to enslave the dark
Defy power, they too are mortal

Lost in our vanity, sold to insanity
We are chosen, to enslave the dark
Defy power, embrace knowledge, defy power, embrace knowledge, counteract today

The dust that became us and the breath that awoke us,
have now given us the time, just time enough to breathe.

The God of old now fading, a distant smile and time its Judas
A final cry and breath, that cracks the sky and lets us in

Our myths and tales, now yield and fade, loose grasp to our tomorrow
All faith abandoned, replaced with fire, that burns across the heavens

Lost in our vanity, sold to insanity
We are chosen, to enslave the dark
Defy power, they too are mortal

Lost in our vanity, sold to insanity
We are chosen, to enslave the dark
Defy power, they too are mortal
