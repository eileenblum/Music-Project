darkened skies as worlds collide endorsing death and genocide

on we march into destruction
inhale the stench of mass corruption
new laws will pass we all collapse
disarray into the void we dissipate

new world order police the globe
enslave the people under mass control
pure deception still we see no wrong
eye of surveillance microchip the population
withholding knowledge for their own use
a flock of sheeple Emptiness of a black tomorrow

life and death joy and sorrow
Emptiness of a black tomorrow
yesterday put the plans in play
a world betrayed a dictator to oversee all

new world order police the globe
enslave the people under mass control
pure deception still we see no wrong
eye of surveillance microchip the population
withholding knowledge for their own use
a flock of sheeple Emptiness of a black tomorrow

"high and higher the flames will rage
til' we revolt and take a stance
we all fall down heel to the crown
deep and further into the hole"
