All becoming forms of hate symptoms rising now take control
My limits ending they rip and tear hear the nightmares hear their cry

The levels rise and reach new heights emotions flood the serpent bites
Mental meltdown torn within anger fuses right and wrong

Taking form through hate and drive taking form with every strike

Your rise and fall a joker's tale laughter's cry now unveiled

You're pushing the limits, I'm fed by the fury the Threshold of Tolerance
Burning raging ansanity fed by the fury the Threshold of Tolerance

Temper rising - more and more - my temper's rising - beyond control


Rhyming senseless feed the deaf return to nothing from whence you came
Formed from nothing born to fade play the poet what do you say

Your rise and fall a joker's tale laughter's cry now unveiled

You're pushing the limits I'm fed by the fury the Threshold of Tolerance
Burning raging ansanity fed by the fury the Threshold of Tolerance

Temper rising - more and more - my temper's rising - beyond control
