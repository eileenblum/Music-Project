Reflections of dark times Frozen are my memories
Reaping only misery When will I learn from my flaws

I put myself in this danger The consequence is now overdue
Now I must pay the toll

Frozen inside my cold stare In darkness consumed
I pray for the light Inside I am screaming
regret of the choice I've made In suffering I've exposed the lie

I know there's no one to blame for the wrongs I've done
So ugly this monster I've become Submerged in this blackness
I'm desperate to change my ways The darkness has got the best of me

Freezing my dark side The evil of my nature
Temptations of desire devour My every waking thought
The answer is hiding The truth is it lying?
Enslaved to the dark of my fear
Frozen resistance is my instinct suppress my dark desires
afflicting all my being
Frozen destroy the hatred Frozen compelled to find the answers that freeze my soul
Frozen darkness hides Frozen I will find Solace from my darkest side

Reflecting the time gone by I question all that I believe

I put myself in this danger The consequence is now overdue
Now I'm much closer.....

Closer to my grave a death race my soul to save
Redemption seems far beyond me now
Haunting this presence Surrounds me a dark cloud
The fires of hell awaiting me.

Freezing my dark side The evil of my nature
Temptations of desire devour My every waking thought
The answer is hiding The truth is it lying?
Enslaved to the dark of my fear
Frozen resistance is my instinct suppress my dark desires
afflicting all my being
Frozen destroy the hatred Frozen compelled to find the answers that freeze my soul
Frozen darkness hides Frozen I will find Solace from my darkest side
