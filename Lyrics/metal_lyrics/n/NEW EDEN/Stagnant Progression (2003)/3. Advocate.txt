we can all believe in lies and ancient tales or we can choose to Advocate
be the one who makes new paths, reject the ways of yesterday

a primal voice inside will lead you to your fate grasp your immortality
be the one who makes new paths, reject the ways of yesterday

all hail the whisper that tells you that you must fight
within your temple lies the source
take hold the light you are now its advocate

feel the voice inside, it tells you its real and not a dream
stand, stand tall to all, you know the truth, the truth inside

we can all believe in lies and ancient tales or we can choose to Advocate
be the one who makes new paths, reject the ways of yesterday

all hail the whisper that tells you that you must fight
within your temple lies the source
take hold the light you are now its advocate
