Feelings of emotions trapped in shadows
Longing to be free and not in chains
Love is not pain. And pain is not love
Tomorrow will close the door to sorrow
Today we walk in hand in silent pain
But what will you do for my love

I bare this cross in your name
Bringing darkness to your pain
Giving light unto my own, my heart screams

Open hands that let us be.
Understanding what's between.
Open mind and open heart.
Understanding our new start

With all of this I have done freeing the one that I love
Saving you from yourself, saving you for myself

The knowledge of what's in you brings me closer to the truth
To accepting what's within, understanding my own love

What will you do for my love will you do as I have done
Saving me from myself, saving me from this hell

With all of this I have done, freeing the one that I love.
Saving you from yourself, saving you for myself.
With all of this I have done freeing the one that I love.
Saving you from your self but what will you do for my love our love
What will this do for our love?
