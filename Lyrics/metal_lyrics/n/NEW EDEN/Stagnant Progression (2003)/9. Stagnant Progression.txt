The flame that burns insight, it gives me life it pulls me in.
Holding nothing back, I give it all then more, til' nothing's left.

To be or not to be, to create destiny, or fall infinitely
Inside of me, all my fears, they strive for life and drain my soul.

Hopes, and dreams, in sleep, til' my
Blood can flow into new veins.
Then my stagnant dreams reborn again, "begin the progression"

Seasons pass and faces age, the passing time, makes cold their fires.
Stand and fall and laugh and cry or leave this world without a trace.

To be or not to be, to create destiny, or fall infinitely
Inside of me, all my hopes, strive for life, they drain my soul.

Hopes, and dreams, awake, can my
Blood now flow into new veins.
From a dreams cruel lie I now awake, "time of change"

Frequencies in song help liberate.
Stagnant dreams forever trapped inside.

Stagnant progression, an elusive evolvement.
Progression hides in fields of change, elusive always taunting me.

Watch the fears they lie and hold you back
The price is time and always paid in death.

Stagnant progression, an elusive evolvement.
Progression hides in fields of change, elusive always taunting me.
