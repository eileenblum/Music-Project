Head first into the darkness
Every night into the street
Mindless nothing can stop him
Steaming with power he's hungry for speed

Full blast driven by madness
Blinded by the disease
Every night no one can stop him
Nothing can quench his insatiable need

Pistons pumping inside his head
Push the needles into the red
None can stop him until he's dead
None can stop him he's bullet head

Long lost all of his reason
Chase the night his only creed
Endless driven by madness
Lost to the power lost to the speed

When I've seen him late at night
Racing the darkness at the speed of light
Pushing the limits of man to extremes
Pistons are pumping mechanical dreams

Pistons pumping inside his head
Push the needles into the red
None can stop him until he's dead
None can stop him he's bullet head
