Dormant in bed but not your mind
Let your soul go let it be you
A fear inside you dormant till now
What is it that scares you''.that scares you

Holy nights bring silent dreams
Silent for all but you
Down in the depths of your soul
You'll find your destiny

Lost in hate bloody hate
Anger in him deep within you
Is it your fear to let him be free
A fear that you have a fear that I have

Holy nights bring silent dreams
Silent for all but you
Down in the depths of your soul
You're gonna find your destiny

In your mind you run and run
Where do you run and why do you run
Have you seen reality don't be scared
It's your nightmare it's your nightmare!
