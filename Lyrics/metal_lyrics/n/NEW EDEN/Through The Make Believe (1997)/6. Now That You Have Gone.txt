I have lost so many times
but now I must win
fears had kept me near to you
but now I found someone new

high up above I found a new love

you know just how to love
you know the way I feel
fears had kept me near to you
but now I found someone new

high up above I found a new love

and now I'm fighting my own wars
now that you have gone

and now I cry tears of joy
now, now that you're gone
