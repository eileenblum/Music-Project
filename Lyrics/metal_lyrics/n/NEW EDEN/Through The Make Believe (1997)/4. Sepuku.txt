Like the sun fades away so shall I'..

I thrust my self into the darkness once again
To nether worlds in search of madness' I descend

I speak the words that bring the thunder I speak the name
I close my eyes and I surrender to the pain

Pain sacred pain through you found my way
Precious fury blessed madness evermore

The spirit winds swirl around me to keep me warm
I gave my soul and through the fire I was reborn

Pain precious pain through you found my way
Precious fury blessed madness ever more

I gave my flesh there at the altar unto the flames
I gave my soul and found euphoria through precious pain

Pain sacred pain through you found my way
Precious fury blessed madness take me home
