Beyond the illusion 'I AM' the only truth you will find
Leave all the lies behind you come fill your eyes with my light
'I AM' the ever present fire
'I' I can fulfill your destiny

Though you've chosen to be blind
And in darkness lost your way
Though you've called the dark sublime
I have come to seek your face
I am calling out your name

Unlock the door let me enter
Unlock the door let me atone

Beyond the illusion 'I AM' the only truth you will find
I came in my due season and I have paid the price for thee
'I AM' the only reason you need
'I' I have fulfilled all prophecies

Though you've chosen to be blind
And in darkness lost your way
Though you've called the dark sublime
I have come to seek your face
I am calling out your name

Unlock the door let me restore
Unlock the door !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
