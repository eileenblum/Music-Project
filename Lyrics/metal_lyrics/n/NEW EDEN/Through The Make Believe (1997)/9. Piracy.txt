Piracy on the high seas Piracy on the high seas

Life and death are reality
When you, you sail on my ship

Piracy on the high seas Piracy on the high seas

Just like Abraham just like Noah
Mortal men you are
Follow me till death but do understand
Death knows all of you

Can't you understand life and death are real
Even on my ship
But do not turn away for if you die today
You'll be far from my reach

Life and death are reality
When you, you sail on my seas

Piracy on the high seas Piracy on the high seas
Piracy, Piracy on the high seas
