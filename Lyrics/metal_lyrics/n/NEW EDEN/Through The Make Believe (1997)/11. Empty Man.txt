Broken one now here lays broken since he began
Lost to his vanity victim of his mind
Son of a fallen age bound and distorted man
Bound by the modern ways hopeless empty man

A modern man of highest learning
Evolved from nothing to human state
He's got his science he's got his reason
He waits for logic to dictate
He says that judgment will not be coming
He says the system is all a fake
Yet in his heart exists a yearning
For hidden things but still he can't believe

Shadow of a man
Who's reason has led him astray
He has outlived his usefulness
And logic can not find his way
And science can not heal his pain
The emptiness made him insane
And from his mind the light did pass away!

He waits for death to come and thinks behind blank stare
That if he had a soul he'd offer his last prayer
Death upon him now and he wonders in distress
Will the earth that fills his grave fill his emptiness
Will it fill his emptiness

And there he lay awaiting death, empty and lifeless;
never having believed in anything.
