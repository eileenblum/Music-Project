Terrorizing ways of the insane
Mass destruction, infliction of pain

Here they come again
The hunters for their prey
Like the reaper searching for more souls

Agonizing, millions lie in wait
Patronizing, a past that wasn't real

Here they come again
The hunters for their prey
Like the reaper searching for more souls

Oh why can't you see
A prophecy on the screen
As the madman keeps singing his
Anthem of hate

[Solo: Horacio Colmenares]

Sick and twisted, a mind has gone array
Close your eyes, pretend that isn't there

Here they come again
The hunters for their prey
Like the reaper searching for more souls

Oh why can't you see
A prophecy on the screen
As the madman keeps singing his
Anthem of hate
