Visions in your mind, calling you
Haunting you
Bringing you back to the time
When the steel of the knife in your back
Was still cold and bled

Your eyes can still remember
Your heart still goes on bleeding
Subconscious always knowing
Constant never ending pain
That spins your hate out of control

The emptiness consumes you
The call of death is on you
Forever in a tail spin
Your life is without meaning
Aggressions arise,
The anger is in site now
Subconscious always knowing
Constant never ending pain
It makes you hate

Just let it go
And will you let it go
Expel it into the night
Rise let it go
And will you let it go,
Expel it into the night

Visions in your mind, calling you
Your eyes can still remember

[Solo: Horacio Colmenares]

Visions in your mind, calling you
Haunting you
Bringing you back to the time
When the steel of the knife in your back
Was still cold and bled

Your eyes can still remember
Your heart still goes on bleeding
Subconscious always knowing
Constant never ending pain
It makes you hate

Just let it go
And will you let it go
Expel it into the night
Rise let it go
And will you let it go,
Expel it into the night
