It is hard to tell
The days become longer still
I feel
And the spirit within
Won't let me give up on this fight
For life

And now I understand
That nothing in the world will remain
Forever
And the pain I feel
Will be left behind altogether
Forever

For as long as I can breathe
Till I have the will to live
No matter what life throws at me
I'm fighting for my life
Fighting with all of my might
Not willing to surrender

Standing tall, I will never, ever fall

I can do it, I know I will
I believe now
I will remain in the race
One more round now
Before the end
Hear the crowd as
They keep on calling your name

Don't give up
Don't give up
Don't give up

I shall remain strong
Give me the strength to carry on

[Solo: Tim Thomas]
