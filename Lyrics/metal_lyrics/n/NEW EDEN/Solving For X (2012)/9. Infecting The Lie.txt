This is the time to speak and fight
Our human rights were left in a file
It's up to me, it's up to you
It's up to us

Open your eyes and you will see
Their hatred within
Hiding the truth
From you and me
Look to the left, look to the right
Hide behind, curtains cover the facts
"Innocent children" we look to you
We are growing up, and coming for you

Open your eyes and you will see
The lies that we eat
All sugar coated but nothing's true
They think that we're stupid
They think that we're dumb
Slide of the hand
Everything's right
We ain't buying the stories
That you want to sell
You are getting no money
You are going to pay

Finding the fire within
It's where it all begins
Having the will to survive
Choosing the sword for the fight
Nothing will stand in our way
History is written today,
Today

Chasing our future
Is now our task
Tomorrow begins with
There here and the now
