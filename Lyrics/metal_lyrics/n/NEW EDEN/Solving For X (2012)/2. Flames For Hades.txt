You you can see it all around
Hear hear the crying of the crowds
Are we living in the final days

Bombs hits them fast and hard
Blood flowing through their towns
Now could it be judgement day

Reality, mortality
The millions that will die today
Can you believe, that you and me
Are feeding the flames for Hades

There, there is panic in the streets
Death, body bags, no trick or treat
Innocence blow away

Reality, mortality
The millions that will die today
Can you believe, that you and me
Are feeding the flames for Hades

How many more will have to die
People cry out genocide
Two wrongs never made it on

[Solo: Tim Thomas]

Wasn't me then who's to blame
Stop the nonsense anyways
Their blood will remain in your hands

[Solo: Tim Thomas]

There's no hope, there's no end
Human kind's decadence
Dreams that are rusting away

But there is hope, open your eyes
Stop the violence, the genocide
This world it's all that we have left
