Some things are easier said than done
To bring some change
To a world that is damned so damned
(I can help it) (We can hep it)

We blame the weather and disease
For a decaying spirit within deep within
(Who can change it) (Let's just scrape it)

Who can change the world
Who can change our world
Who will save this world from humanity

We keep on trying our best
But our best is like the rest
Just like the rest
(I can help it) (We can hep it)

We do the same things as before
Yet we are expecting a different result
Than before
(Who can change it) (Let's just scrape it)

Who can change the world
Who can change our world
Who will save this world from humanity

What are we to do
To prepare for our doom
Should we sit and wait for rain
Close our eyes and wish again

(Let's stand up) the time is now
(Together) we can turn it all around

Don't delay don't delay

What are we to do
To prepare for our doom

[Solo: Tim Thomas]

(Let's stand up) the time is now
(Together) we can turn it all around
