In these heartless times, the blood will flow
Pave our streets, taint our gold, define our name
Now the shameless rise, they claim the crown
Dressed as fools, with plastic smiles:
We all bow down!

In a moment's time, it all can fade
Dissipate, evaporate, leave no trace
Save all will you save all that is you
Take a stance, take a chance, while you still stand

No more crying - to the skies
Bare your arms, hold it down reclaim the crown
No more waiting - take it now
Brainless minds, keep the gates, giving all away

Mindless brains: brainless minds
Simple minds with complex lives
Mindless brains: brainless minds

[Solo: Horacio Colmenares]

Mindless brains: brainless minds
Simple minds with complex lives
Mindless brains: brainless minds

[Solo: Kragen Lum]
