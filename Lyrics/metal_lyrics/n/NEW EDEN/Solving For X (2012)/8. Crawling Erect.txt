Rise and stand tall
You've evolved into man

Stop, crawling erect
Make use of your spine
Walk straight without fall
Lend, freedom some time
Give it your brain
And get back a mind

Fire in you
With blackened heart
Bringer of pain, maker of hate
Down on the ground
Your slither and crawl
Just like a snake
Got to watch for your bite

[Solo: Horacio Colmenares]

See, not what it shown
Colored and born
Of deceptive minds
Scrape, beyond the grime
That paves our time
And write your own lines

Fire in you
With blackened heart
Bringer of pain, maker of hate
Down on the ground
Your slither and crawl
Just like a snake
Got to watch for your bite

[Solo: Kragen Lum]

Fire in you
With blackened heart
Bringer of pain, maker of hate
Down on the ground
Your slither and crawl
Just like a snake
Got to watch for your bite

Fire in you
With blackened heart
Bringer of pain, maker of hate
Down on the ground
Your slither and crawl
Just like a snake
Got to watch for your bite
