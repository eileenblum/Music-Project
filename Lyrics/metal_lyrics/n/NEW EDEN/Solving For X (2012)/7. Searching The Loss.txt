Alone in the dark, here all is clear
The face inside still looks outside
And searches still
Your fragmented voices still call

Seeking away to see your face
Chipping away at mountains high
The name I call is still alive
So far away
Untouchable, distant from me

Now far from home
Tired and torn, I'm still alive
Still wanting more
Slipping and falling away

Where are you, where am I
An emptiness just filled with void
Is all I have
Take me, take you
Make it all as one
Searching for what I had
Searching the loss

[Solo: Horacio Colmenares]
