[Lyrics: Ingo Haltermann]

[Dark Angel]

My eyes are closed but I can see you coming
Without a sound I can hear your longing sigh
My skin awaits your aching kiss on my neck
I'm awaiting you, my dark angel

So take my hand with your bloody claws
Let us fade away on raven's wings
To take the great emptiness beyond the sky
The castle of silence, my dark angel

All the fears made my brain rotting
And slowly till infinity
I'm drifting into insanity
But I know that you will come

Come to drink me red wine from me
Take it with my sorrows
I'm longing for your bloody kiss
Do not leave me alone, my dark angel

My eyes wide open, I perceive your shadow
I open my lips for my last cry
Open your eyes, it is just a dream
When will you come, my dark angel?

Take the aching cry from my lips
The silence of oblivion is what I wish
Heal my wounds with your gift
Show me eternity, my dark angel

[Beyond the Sky]

When I walked through the gates of oblivion
Screams of the forgotten died in my ears
And the voice of silence started to cry
Welcome the great emptiness - beyond the sky

Hands of despair seized my heart
When I fell into the eternal darkness
The corridors of timelessness
Squeezed my conciousness - beyond the sky

I passed the door of no return
And the wind whispered a requiem
In empty throne covered by frost
In the castle of sadness - beyond the sky

And when I ascended the ancient throne
I felt everlasting emptiness
And as my brain starts rotting
I saw eternity - far beyond the sky
