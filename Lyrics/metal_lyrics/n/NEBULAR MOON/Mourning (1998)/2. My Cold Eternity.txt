Now eternity in taking my soul 
And I feel like I?m frozen alive 
In my heart, there is only keenly emptiness 
My blood is yet again like red, cold ice 
I, I'm the last one in this cage 
Dying for your child, for human race 

[Chorus:] 
Now I'm seeing your sin, my god 
You are the liar of all this past years 
Might, it was your only destiny 
I wish, that I die alone, without your heed 
Let my soul pass away 
I don't need your grace - I won't serve 
I don't want survive in your world of lies 
I'm not your slave, I'm ANTICHRIST 

Fall, fall again from grace 
Into burning fields of truth 
Fallin' down, on earth 
Without hope in blind eyes 

Now I'm seeing myself in a buried word 
Silent screams I hear deep inside my soul 
Freezing dreams comes true im my pitch-dark night 
From my barren land you can hear me cry 
I remember the time, which is pass away 
And I feel, that I don't want to return 

[Rep. Chorus.] 

Time of my low is born - I'm your heir to the throne 
Hear my complain - I will raise from my grave 
Dawn of my lordship you see, your kingdom is blow away 
Pay for your treason now - You will be mine
