When their arms reach out for you 
They seise thy heart for an atrocies embrace 
With demoniac fingers the shroud covers your face 
And then you know:  thou shall die 

Pursued by nothing zhan your fear 
But their steps resounding in your tortued ears 
Tormenting your soul, no place to hide 
No sword to fight:   thou shall die 

You struggle when you hear them coming 
And every step you run, thousand pursue your poor soul 
Demoniac laughter when they tear off little parts 
You're bleeding when times and feelings come off and die 
Every tick of the hand a part of you 
When you crowl to the tombstone of thine 
You know 
You die 
In pieces
Time to resign 
But you are already dead.
