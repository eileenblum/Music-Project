Sitting on her deathbed 
Narrating tales of love and pain 
Seems to be a cold comfort 
Oblivion, increasing with the time 

Looking at her dying eyes 
Closing for the very last breath 
Just a moment when she dies 
A wave oin the ocean of time 

Holding her hand in mine 
Her body tires the last time 
Laying in the open coffin 
Grain of sand in the desert of space 

Standing at her lonley grave 
Reminiscences of love and pain 
Unititing to her whole short life 
Transory, whistle of the wind 
A wave in the ocean of time 

Seeing her sorrofull eyes 
Overshadowed by pain 
Darkness is surrounding me: 
A moment like infinity
