The Sun
Is entering in me
And now I follow
The inside path of the unknown

I have learned
To let my heart take over
Like the sun
Who rises over the desert
To be the one
Who falls in love with all the Earth

In love with the Earth

There is no God
But the unique eternal
Creator of the light
In whom all is contained

It takes millions of forms
Staying in unity
Nor god neither goddess
A spiritual state
His life is endless
An androgen being

Now listen to his call

It calls you too
