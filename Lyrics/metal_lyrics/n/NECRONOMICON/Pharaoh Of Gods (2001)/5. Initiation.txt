The time is coming
To take the truth
Into your temple
Surrounded by light
It's hard to swallow
It's hard to breathe
It just begins
It's just a test

Offer it to the Source
Like a present
To be purified
That kind of medicine
When you are bitten
You feel the poison
You're becoming it
And you transmute it

Now you are dead
And now you reborn
Feel this new world
On the initiate's way

Walk back on the Earth
Be one with the Earth
A raised Cobra
On your ajna
