In the right hand of the Gods
The right form of the cross
Synthesis of the spirit
Who takes a human form

The spirit who accepts to take a form
In a body to transcend all humanity
For their return at the Sun

The Divine incarnated
Among the mankind
To show them the way
For life there's really no end

You'll be alive
After your life
Forever, Alive
In unity, with the light
