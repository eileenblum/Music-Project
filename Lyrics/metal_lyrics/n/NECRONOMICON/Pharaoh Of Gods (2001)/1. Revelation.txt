On many lands we live again
Divine blood flows in our veins
Descendants of these islands
Amenptah was called our land
Here we stand again
Scepter of Life in hand
For this world it's soon the end
The secrets are well hidden

In the future, from the past
The secrets of all mankind
Was brought by the Redmen
Coming from the Great Homeland
We are here to purify
We are here among the lies
We are here across the time
And we help you to die

We have made the secrets
The great mysteries
Of all humanity
And we know your destiny

Die!
Of course you will die
Just a question of time
And time is just a lie
A lie who blinds your mind
That's why you have to die
And re-open your eyes
To see what's the real life
