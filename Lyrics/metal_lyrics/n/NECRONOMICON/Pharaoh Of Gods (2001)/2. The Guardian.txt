Hands on the Sun
Under the Sun
Seeing the remains
From the past
The time has past
So very fast
Memory cries
Another time

Another time, another life
Another body, is it me
What I see, is not a dream
It's really me, another realm
Between, the hands
Of the, Guardian

It's the way to remember
It's the way to understand
It's the way to heal
It's the key of mysteries
