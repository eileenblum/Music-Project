Rise of the Sun
A new life begun
Face the East
On your knees

Raise your hands
To the sky
After the Sun
Touched your eyes
Bow to him
Feel the energy

Rays almighty
Entering your body
Back to your knees
For a second time
With your hands
Form a triangle
Focusing on
The Third Eye

"In my hands
I behold all
Life and love
I'm the light"
