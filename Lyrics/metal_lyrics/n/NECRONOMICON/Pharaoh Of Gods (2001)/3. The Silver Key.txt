Mind's door from the outside
Thirteen spheres of the light
Him who lives in darkness
Him who lives in emptiness

The soul of chaos
The heart of the lion
The cycle of time
The all in one

Mind's door from the outside
Thirteen spheres of the light
Him who lives in darkness
Him who lives in emptiness

Show me, Silver Key
I want to know the truth
I want to see the past
I look through the window of time

The soul of chaos
The heart of the lion
The cycle of time
The all in one

Now I'm all in one
I know the truth
I've seen the past
I cross the door of time
