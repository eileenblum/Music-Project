Life after life 
I'm back once more
Stronger than before
With the wheel of time and the gods on my side
I walk the wind and make love to the sky
One with earth and the fire in my eyes
From aeon to aeon I had a thousand forms
Descending in the flesh at the altar of time
Where the true sinners lie waiting to bring me down
Hundreds of knives have stabbed me
Thousands of arrows have pierced me
My blood have been spilled through history
My name spread fear to my enemies
Here I am
From my ashes I live again
Here I stand
Resurrected to fight until the end
