Blessed now by the sun
Living god now I'm the one
Destiny in my end
Of the entire land
Worship me when I die
Sailing down on the Nile
Crossing the underground
Reaching the other side
Among the gods now I am
They come to me and take my hand
Vision of future is in my hand
I let myself go into the light
The rays of the sun are millions
Touching everything that lives
The hands that carry the spirits are the seeds of mankind future
As I am immortal through time and space I live again
