Rise my friends
The time has come
Lord of this world we are
Bringer of light, whisperer in the dark
Prophet on another aeon
Masters of thousands legions
Deep in the temples of the past
The voices are calling
The witches are gathering
The words are spoken, the sign are drawn
In the tongue of the lost world
The deep slumber is now over
Numbness is leaving, power is rising
Gods of the gods, lords of the lords
Energy is descending the gate way is open
Time is stopped, death now dies
The true gods are coming, now it's time to kneel
