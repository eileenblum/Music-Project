The lies are falling in the kingdom of the cross
For what they're saying the end of times is at the door
As the weak are waiting a salvation that will never come
We walk the earth and take back what is ours
Free from slavery
We are the masters of our destiny
Blinded by hypocrisy
They cannot see our divinity
Let us rebuild our former knowledge and wisdom
The end of times is where mankind is born
The lies are burning in the kingdom of the cross
For what they're saying the end of times as come
As the weak are dying I give my hand for their salvation
The end of time is when their world is no more
Free from slavery
We are the masters of our destiny
Blinded by hypocrisy
They cannot see our divinity
Mankind never be the same
The true gods are coming
Spread the word and listen
