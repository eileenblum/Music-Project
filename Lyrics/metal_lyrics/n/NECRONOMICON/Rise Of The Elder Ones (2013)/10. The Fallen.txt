Thunder and lightning strikes the earth
The battle is not yet over the scent
Of the smoke dominate the air of the night
The sky is red from the flame of the burning cities
And here I stand where my doom was supposed to be
Surrounded by what's left of those who tried attack
Daring, defying the storm coming at me
Ready for the end, for this moment I've been living
The wave is striking many falls in the first minutes
Friends around are dying but I havae to keep moving
There do I see my father
There do I see my mother 
And my sisters and my brothers
There do I see the line of my people
Back to the beginning
They do bid me to take my place among them
In the halls of Valhalla
A sea of corpses as far the eyes can see
Blood and water are one in the rivers
Agony spread is wings on the battle field
When only I still alive
