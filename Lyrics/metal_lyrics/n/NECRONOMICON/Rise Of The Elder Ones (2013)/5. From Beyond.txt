What you can see after the light
The world is clear everything is bright
Odors and colors are endless
Everything is simple and flawless
You can tell all you've ever been
With a simple thought or with a dream
All things that were locked into your mind
Are now right here before your eyes
Now life and death is but a dream
Compare to what we are meant to be
Be one with all it's what we are
Some of us are even from the stars
Forbidden knowledge is free in here
From those who try to destroy it
It's when you look to see what is God
You find the truth abaout who you are
We are from beyond
No fear is dwelling into the sanctum
From beyond is where we belong
Life and death is one with what we are
From beyond where we are born
