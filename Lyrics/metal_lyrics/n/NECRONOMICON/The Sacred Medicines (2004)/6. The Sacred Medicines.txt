Given by the one
For those with pure heart
The gift of power
From the creation
"Around the sacred fire we are gathering singing our chants with a clear
voice to call upon the four directions to call upon the Great Spirit"
Mother, I call you the Earth
Father, I all you the sky
Brothers the air in the sea, on the lands
Share with me, your mysteries
Respecting all forms of life
Respecting even the night
Life is within everything
Night is a part of our being
Around the circle we smoke the pipe
Friend of the eagle in the sky
Those are the Sacred Medicines
