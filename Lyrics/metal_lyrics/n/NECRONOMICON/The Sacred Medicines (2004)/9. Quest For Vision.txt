Fire
Let me be with the flames
Learning
That I can be my worst enemy
Earth
I'm taking root within the body
Sacred
This nature where I become a man
Alone in the dark
All the creatures are around
Scream and cry in vain
It's the mind who suffocates
The illusions are strong
So many things are wrong
In this world of hatred
Faith in you
The visions are true
Stronger in the dark
With the spirits now you are bound
Singing your new faith
It's your true name they evocate
Faith in you
The visions are true
Your power is true
The vision is you
