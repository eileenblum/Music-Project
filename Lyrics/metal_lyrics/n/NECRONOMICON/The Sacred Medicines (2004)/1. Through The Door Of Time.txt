As I walk
Through the door of time
I knew what I have been and
What I've become
So many lives
And experiences
To reach this stage
To Be Awake
Now I've returned
Down to the Earth
As a Messenger
As the Door Keeper
Now Understand
That life is endless
And your body
Is a leaf upon a tree
Deeper you've fallen (The soul of chaos)
Higher you'll be rising (The Heart of the Lion)
Death is a dream (The Cycle of time)
The leaf is also the tree (The All in one)
As I walked
Through the Door of Time
I knew what you've been
And What you've become
You will return
Down to this Earth
As a Messenger
As the Key Bearer
