At your side I've always been
You were blinded by the belief
Too blind to see that I was here
Too blind to see that I was near
Let me see deep in your heart
Cause I am the light guiding your path
I am the one who's from the sun
Take my hand and follow me
To a land where you'll be free
Behind the Mask of anyone
It's your true self that you will find
Leaving the mark
Leaving the mass
Behind
