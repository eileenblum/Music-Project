Speaking to the Gods
All the truth they cannot see
I know the cost
That I pay to be the one
I spread my wings in the dark
Cloaking my light with the night
To take the hand
Of all the ones who've fallen
I use the Dark Arts
Casting out deception
A silent flight in the night
You only know when I strike
Walking in the world of sorrow
Walking Among the Shadows
Waking the dead is my goal
