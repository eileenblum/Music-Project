Descending from the sky
To guide them out of t he dark
Thousands of years have passed
And he returns at last
Flying (Through the times)
Guiding (In the hearts)
Hiding (Waiting for the time)
Rising (Wings of the light)
Venimous love
Translated by the words
Wisdom of the past
Reflected in his acts
Messiah
For the ones who talk with the spirits
For the ones who walk among the fields
For the ones who are grateful to the sun
For the ones who know his true form
The enserald light
Coming from the heart
Soon will be a rebirth
For the people of this Earth
The time has come for my people
Raise your head and be proud
Your call has been heard
By the divine that I serve
As long as your heart understands
That I'm the one who has been sent
To connect you hand in hand
With the one which you descend
