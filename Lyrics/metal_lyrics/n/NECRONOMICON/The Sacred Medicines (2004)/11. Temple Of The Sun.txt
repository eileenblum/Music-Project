Entering by the crown
Connected with the Divine
Filling your soul
Putting you in control
To speak without the mind
To speak no more lies
Healing everyting
That's been hurting
Awaken from the bottom
Lighting the seven suns
Rising to the top, all the doors are now open
For the one
Channeling, that pillar of light
From Beyond
Who will dare to be the first
Who will dare to cross the threshold
Who will dare become a God
In the Temple of the Sun
There is no more fear
There is no more hatred
There is no need for all that pain
Where love has been awakened
Love is a state
Starting with faith
Open your eyes
Dare be the one
