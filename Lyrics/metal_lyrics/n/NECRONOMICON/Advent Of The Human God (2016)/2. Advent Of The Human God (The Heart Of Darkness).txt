The end of despair, the coming of a new heir
The lord of outer planes, on the threshold disperse the pain
Many time visiting, this world of misunderstandings
Dark forces are not, what people know and shout
Pagan eyes cry, for this world no one cares about
Mankind's living a lie, from creation forever apart

Eons of slumber are not even enough
As time passes we are still standing
Ghouls are rising, it will not be in vain
Marching forward, fear will be slain forever

For whom concerned about the faith of the world
For whom concerned about their loved ones
The path is open, for the lord is coming
The path is open where god becomes human

The end of despair, the coming of a new heir
The lord of outer planes, on the threshold disperse the pain

Rejecting what have been imposed
Renouncing what have been forced
Reunite with what you are
Is awake the god that you are
