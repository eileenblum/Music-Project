The spawns of the crucified, said to dwell among the clouds
Leaving their lands, for gold and riches
Sailing the seas to convert all human beings
In the steppes and the lands beyond the Andes, my people arise
Hands opened toward the sun, offering what we have done
They bring the crown of thorns to corrupt all of our sons
The flesh of their god, they eat, and his blood they've sworn to drink
Lord of pain and suffering, calling misery on their kin
Hailed for a life of numbness, giving their soul to emptiness

Around their neck, wearing the accursed cross
Symbol of pain and those who are lost
Thousands of years of devious preaching
In out time, our culture is slowly dying
Of this bread, I won't be eating
Because I'm a true human being
