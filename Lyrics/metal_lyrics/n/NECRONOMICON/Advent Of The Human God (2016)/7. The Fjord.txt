High as the mountains
Deep as the water
Harshness of the tongue
Thickness of the skin
Bold and proud
Strong and loud
Fire and Ice
Women and drinks
Proud jewel of Vinland
Living place of the giants
The voice of the ancients
Thundering in the land
Endless forest
Purest rivers
Jealous and fierce
Laugh and tears
Coldest nights
Northern lights
Warrior hearts
Conqueror of the north
The will to fight the world
To build something better
Traveling land and seas
To fulfill our destiny
Where man and beast share the same kingdom
Warrior from the day we're born, from father to son
Fighting to the very end, on a faraway land
When I'll die on the distant shore, bring my body back to the fjord
