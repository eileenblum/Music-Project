I'm master and lord of this kingdom
In the world of man, I am wisdom
The emerald sun, the power of the one
Avatar of the purest form

Dark times are fading, joining hands with fate
Destiny at the door for the one looking beyond
Knowledge from the stars channeled through the verb
Words of truth from the mouth of the fallen

I am the god sun
i am the atom
I am Viracoche
I am Kukulkan

I am the shining one
I am bringer of dawn
I am the morning star
I am bringer of light

Under my wing, the power of fire
The elder sign, protecting the wise
Sitting on the throne of death
Holding the scepter of life

If you walk the path of the snake, be ready to shed your own skin
At peace with darkness, at ease with hellfire
Fall of the lies, I have risen as the god of darkness
To realize that I am one with the cosmic truth
