I'm born from Hermes, Hyperion elected me
Without Iamsoph, I'm destined to perish
The moon and the sun, Venus' divine breath
The first number of the form, a triangle pointing down
First, to be a vessel
Second to create the spark
The ritual of polarities
Communion of the opposites
Blood and mercury have found
By dexterous art, have been bound
Nature learn to imitate
Teaches how to circulate
A single circle in the middle
Triangle with the proper symbols
Simple material prima
Beginning, middle, and end
Human at the core of the flower of life
Cosmic wave enter the crown of light
Roots of the mother rise to the Anahata
Golden aura, purity the karma
Humankind cannot gain anything
Without first, giving something
In return, to obtain something
Equal value, must be lost
When god and blood are joined, creating the cosmic spawn
As one and one are two, flesh and god become one
