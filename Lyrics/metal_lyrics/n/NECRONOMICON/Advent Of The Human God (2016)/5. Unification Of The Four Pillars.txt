Witness the wonder, the fact that we are the storm
Crushing the weak wherever we take form
Cleansing the world back to its purest form
The truth emerging from the deepest part of the earth
Shattering the mirror of life-long lies
To reveal reality against all odds
Appearance deceives the untrained eye
Who will dare defy the sons of the gods?

The values of their world is nothing in the universe
Darker is the shadow, brighter is the light
Let our hearts beat with the pulse of the earth
Cosmic consciousness over the matter of the flesh

The pillars united to open the path of heaven
The thousand year god, a myth that will not return
Lightning strikes, fire scorches the ground
The earth trembles, waves crushing the world

As Gaia awaken to the cycle of purification
All life enters a universal rebirth
