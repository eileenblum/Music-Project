As we are one, we are light and darkness
Father and son, the golden gods
Leading the fight, on the field against the mass
The rotten core, indoctrination
We are the fruits of the secret garden
Enlighten now, the truth is out
Taking our place, forging our legend
Kingdoms are falling, false name are burning

Ascending to the sphere of consciousness
Transcending hatred to knowledge
Gathering the fallen angels

Spear of destiny
Sword of truth
Alpha, Omega
Ashram Sana Elah
Occultist trinity
From traitor to savior
From lead to gold
From darkness into the light

The blood of ages
Nectar divine
We drink the wine
Come drink with us
