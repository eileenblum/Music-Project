GRIND !!!

I bow to you - spirit of the night
I praise your power - beholding thy might
Like Panzer roaming battlefields
This storm is pure Vernichtung
Till I die - I raise the banner, crush the crown of light

serve until I die

Flesh and Blood - grateful victims devoted unto thorns
This Black-Metal was forged in the unholy halls of the eternal frost

Thou art might - old blacks right

Storming crusade - revealing endless hate
