Elder horns announce the silent age of blindness
Machines with a cold black within
Armed messengers of boundless disaster
When peace comes forth as a collateral damage

Granted inventions, as symbols of progress
Releasing the dawn of infernal mischief

High developed minds into a bastards of a circle
Hailing future as a purpose of its own
Foolish men follow willingly their preachers
Unveiling their weakness, devoted to their doom

This is the end, led by minds depraved
Failed humanity is the answer of disharmony

By conquest of that sensible minds
We're predicted to fight the total war
By discovery of our god-equal minds
We're free to destroy ourselves

Sick belief - but never religion
Worshipping ourselves - a new humanity
Denial of ethics - cursing the good
By healing the world - world has to die

Mankind has to die
Boundless crematory alive 

By conquest of that sensible minds
We're predicted to fight the total war
By discovery of our god-equal minds
We're free to destroy ourselves

So Grind !!!
