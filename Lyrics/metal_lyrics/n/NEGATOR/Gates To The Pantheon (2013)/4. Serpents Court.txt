Through me the way to the suffering city - Through me the
everlasting pain - Through me the way that runs among
the lost - Abandon all hope you who enter here

By passing the gates I enter the realm where Lord Minos holds
court - Snake-tailed judge of those condemned - Sniffing the
blood of the wretched to expose their sins - On the edge of this
world I'm longing for Charon to ferry me into the fire -
The cold, the everlasting darkness - A region where there is
nothing that can give light - Profound darkness

As I descend deeper - Accompanied by virtuous pagans -
I pass the hordes of Lucifer - Hell-beasts and fire-demons -
Weird worms, vile torturers

Sentenced to death - I have passed the gates
Bereaved of existence - The path to hell awaits
Cast out from heaven - My divinity has died
Embraced by darkness - I decline the holy light
