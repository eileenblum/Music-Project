Through this Eucharist of living flesh we summon you
Almighty one come forth with madness

Trietenious liber baechus jaechus

Blessed be thou twice-born god
Offspring of the winter solstice
Thracian god of ecstasy and terror atonement
Guilt and death

Io ischuros
Io athanatos
Io abrotos
Iao sabao

Ecstatic from the east we await
Orgiastic pleasures bring them forth
Bail to flesh
Bail to lust
Bail to sin
Bail to glory

We conjure thee by the fire of Girra
Rise from the pits of ancient holocausts!

Loud-roaring and rebelling son of Semele
Primeval two-natured
Baechic Lord
Hearken to my voice
O blessed one
Breathe on me in a spirit of perfect kindness

Come bull-faced god conceived in fire
Come blessed and leaping god and bring much joy to all

Thracian god of ecstasy and terror atonement
Guilt and death

Khaire Phale
Khaire Pamphage
Khaire Pangenetor
Hagios Baphomet
