God of darkness, lord of war - Grand dragon, covered in
entrails - Fill the channels with blood - Feast on the lifeblood
of man - You set your face towards Kurnugi - The dark house,
dwelling of Erkalla's god - To the house which those who enter
cannot leave

Seven gates you have passed - Seven rituals you have prevailed

To the road where travelling has one way - The house where
those who entered where deprived of light - Where dust was their
feast and clay their bread - They were clothed, like birds, with
feathers - They saw no light, they dwelt in darkness - You tore
Ereshkigal's robe away - Sodomized her womb - Stole her
kingdom - Became her king

Raise up the dead here - Consuming the living
Behold Nergal - King of darkness
Gatekeeper, open your gate for me
