In the fountain of chaos, at the edge of time - Where neither
light nor darkness exist - Where time was born to guide the
foolish - There I rule, there I reign

I am the torch - I am the vanguard - I am the stanchion -
The zealous slaughterer - I am the venom - I am the wisdom -
I am the scepter's bearer - The urge for battle

When I rise from my dwelling the equilibrium of heaven and
earth will disintegrate - Bright day will turn to darkness -
Whirlwinds will rise and the stars of heaven shall fall

Ill-winds will blow and the eyesight of man will be darkened
forever - Demons will rise and seize the race of man -
The waters will rise and sweep across the lands
