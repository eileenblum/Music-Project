Hail! Apollyon! King of the demonic locusts
Hail! God of the sun! Conqueror of Christian souls

The fifth trumpet has sounded - A star is falling from heaven -
Unholy wrath is unleashed - Armageddon has come

Hail! Abbadon! God of death and pestilence
Hail! Falling star! lock-keeper of the bottomless pit

The seed of Adam withers - The futile lives of humanity torn
apart - Their souls destroyed by tearing pain - Air and light
turn into black

Scorpions and Snakes, enunciators of the end - Horses prepared
for battle, golden crowned, a thundering roar - A spreading mass
of darkness and wrath - Conquest, War, Famine, Death

Angel of the abyss! - Ominous be thy name!
From his throne of truth - He commands the end!
