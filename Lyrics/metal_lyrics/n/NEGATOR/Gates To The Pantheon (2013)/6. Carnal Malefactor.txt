These violent storms are sweeping away my bliss 0 No hope for
rest and none for lesser pain

The vice of lust became so customary that license is now a
burden - Among these sufferers, there is no hope that ever
comforts them - Carnal malefactors are suffering in here -
I witness the punishment - Accompanied by fear - No rest is
granted in this abyss

Among these convicts I face my own sins that I've committed,
they hunt me down - Here deep in this kingdom where the
craving for flesh is a fear - I suffer with them in punishment

Amid the gust, the whirlwind and the flaw of rain and hail-
stones, sinners need not tell their sorrows

But I have to move on, on this wretched course - Darkness still
calls me, that unutterable force - My body falls deep into
coldness - Like dead bodies fall...
