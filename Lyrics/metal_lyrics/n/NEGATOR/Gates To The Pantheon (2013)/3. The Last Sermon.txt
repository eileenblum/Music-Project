I've travelled the realms beyond heaven and hell - Reaper of
souls, ender of worlds - Feared slayer of kings, guardian of the
path - I've shaped all your deepest beliefs

I was there from the beginning - I will exist at the end of all
things - I've stood witness to every feeble passing - I've stood
witness to every great atrocity

In every strife - In every war -
In every revolution - I have left my mark

Executioner at the gallows - A lone hunter -
Soldier on the battlefield - Criminal in the shadows

All who live know my name - All who oppose me shall know

In every strife - In every war -
In every revolution - I have left my mark

At the end, mine will be the last face that you see
