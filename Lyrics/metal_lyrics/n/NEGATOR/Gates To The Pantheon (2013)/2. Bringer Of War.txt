When on high no name was given to heaven - Nor below was
the netherworld called by name - Apsu was their progenitor and
Tiamat was she who bore them all

Gigim Xul! Uggae! Evil spirit! God of death!

They were mingling their waters together - No cane brake was
intertwined - Nor thicket matted close - When no gods at all
had been brought forth - None called by names, no destinies
ordained - Then were the gods formed within these two

In the cella of destinies - The abode of designs - The most
capable, the sage of the gods - The Lord was begotten -
The mighty firstborn - Champion of his father - Hastener to
battle - The warrior - Marduk!

In the midst of Apsu Marduk was formed - In the midst of
holy Apsu was Marduk formed!

Gigim Xul! Uggae! Evil spirit! God of death!
