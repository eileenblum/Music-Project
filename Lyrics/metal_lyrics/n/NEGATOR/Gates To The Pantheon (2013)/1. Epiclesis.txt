Harken me! Oh slaves of god! - Your time has come!
I'm your downfall! - Serpents are my crown - I'm the flames
of the sun - Fire and air shall sweeten my path

I am the flame, which burns in every heart of man -
Which burns in every core of the stars - I am the life and the
disposer of Life - Therefore the knowledge about me is the
knowledge of death - I call upon the ancient names of the
elders - Darkness shall rise!

Rise! Azrael! Angel of death - preserver of names
Rise! Samael! Twelve-winged ruler of the serpent
Rise! Uriel! Father of false worship - companion of Sabaoth!
Rise! Leviathan! Serpent of the seas - Bring forth damnation,
herald the fall of mankind

I am the flame, which burns in every heart of man - Which
burns in every core of the stars - The earth will tremble, below
my feet - No one shall live without my name engraved in skin
