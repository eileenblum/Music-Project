Dogmatic living - forced to serve an abhorrence
Cursed to fight a battle already lost

Damned until eternity
Blinded by the God above
The wretchedness of their existence
Infects the weak and the foolish

The cross as symbol of disgrace
Disguised in a frame of mockery
An incarnation of true evil
Used to forge a new slavery

Your feeble lies let them stigmatize
Your wrong-believe hallows their sadness

Glance with me into the darkness
See the sins you're praying for
Smell the stench of putrefaction
And inhale the poisonous truth
