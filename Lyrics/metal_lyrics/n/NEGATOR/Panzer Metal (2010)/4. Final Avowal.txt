Whisperer of shadows
Tell me where I belong
Take my soul away
Exhume me from this mortal frame

Reveal the secrets of pain
Show me desires of the flesh

Remove all doubts
And guide me into darkness

Mark me with your words
And wash my sins away

For I deny the world above
And I denied the light
Let me dwell within
The supremacy of the night

Omnes vulnerant, ultima necat
Omnes vulnerant, ultima necat

This final avowal is all you deserve
To all of you who lost the verve
To the supreme black metal art

Which lives in us few
Which lives in our hearts
