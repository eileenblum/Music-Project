Monotonous staccato heartbeats set the pace
Fueled by stupidity
Driven by disinterest

Unconscious martyrs
For a mechanical religion

Gears in the clockwork of degeneration
An inward spiral of blunt allegiance
Hailing the prophets of enlightened deceit

Followers of darkened paths
Dogmatized by birth - unborn

Fire as a catalyst
To sort out the elite
