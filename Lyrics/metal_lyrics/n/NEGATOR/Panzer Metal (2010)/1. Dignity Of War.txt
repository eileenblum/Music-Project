Standing on this battlefield - again prepared for war
The banners back up to the front
New weapons loaded - unsecured
Awaiting the call to march

The dust of previous battles has lain down
Still the stench of fire fills the air - pungent

Back to the front
Everyone will fight until death
We will hook them all
Upward the devilhorns

Panzer rolling again
Under the glorious star of the north

Back to the front
Everyone will fight until death

No prisoners
No retreat

This is the dignity of war
Which lies upon us all

Fear the new army - a force you cannot stand
A furious storm of speed and strength
