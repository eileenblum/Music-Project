I call Einodian Hecate, lovely dame
Of earthly, watery, and celestial frame
Sepulchral, in a saffron veil arrayed

Pleased with dark ghosts
That wander thro' the shade
Persian, unconquerable huntress

Hail!

The world's key-bearer
Never doomed to fail
On the rough rock
To wander thy delights

Leader and nurse
Be present to our rites
Propitious grant our just desires success

Come to me! O Hecate
Join me! O Hecate
Weaver of lives!
