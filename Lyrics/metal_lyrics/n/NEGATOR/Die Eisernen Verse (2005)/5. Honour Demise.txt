Farewell, separate from meaningless life
That remains in everyone an every find
Take the last exit to the blue room and smile
The merger with nothingness

Neither misery nor sorrow
Just a cold black inside
In pain is glory
The pleasure, the honour of demise

Faith was her name, desperate illusion
Whore of the blind, bitch of my dreams
But itÂ´s always harder
To discharge the gleaming hopes in my mind
