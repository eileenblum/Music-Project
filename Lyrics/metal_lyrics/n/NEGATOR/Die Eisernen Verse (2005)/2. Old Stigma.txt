Arriving at the ancient gates, watching the road behind
Fog rising fromn the graves, frost rising from inside
Under the banner of wolf Â the sign of devil
Stigmatized as elder evil

Marching on and on
Upwards the devilhorns

Holding the power to create but the will to destroy
More than a lifestyle Â more than going out in uniform
Knowing the might of disastrous decomposition
Faustian eyes gazing thee Â speaking of wisdom

We are the substance
TheyÂ´re the accuser
Every single word is a lie

HoolÂ´em all!
