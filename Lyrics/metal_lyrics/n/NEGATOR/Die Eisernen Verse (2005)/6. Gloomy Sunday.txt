[This song is based on ÂGloomy SundayÂ originally composed by Reszo Serress in Hungaria 1933.
In relation to many suicides it is also called the Âhymn of SuicidesÂ.
It was forbidden in some countries for several years because of the assumption that this song influences peopleÂ´s mind guiding them to take their lives.]
