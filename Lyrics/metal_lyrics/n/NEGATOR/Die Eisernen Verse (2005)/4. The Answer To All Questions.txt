A Man went to enter war
With burning anticipation
They brought him back in coffin
It was his last instruction

For the tyrant left the hall
Fallen power, broken eyes
He called the matrial court
To command his own demise

Ten million activists
Were sent out to pray peace
Were shot between the frontiers
And buried in nameless graves

Ten billion humans
Fought for the last piece of grain
Struggled for survival and to be
The last sinner on earth

And the dignity tied minds above
Bursting with good advice
Watching the world collapse
Boundless crematory alive

Noones but my eyes can see
Noone but my mouth can speak
God is the answer to all questions
And god ist dead
