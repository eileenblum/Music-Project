From the cold darkness of night
A wounded Angel came to me
Her wings are broken, her spirit's pierced
Her smooth, bronze skin is scarred I see

But one day she'll be free again
A wish that burns in her eyes
To release herself from the shackles of this world
And fly away to crimson skies

But how can a mortal help an Angel?
What can I do to ease her pain?
While those questions were tearing my mind
She sadly looked the stars in vain

Then she fell into my arms
I felt her body shaking like a leaf
Tears were running down her face
Her gaze faded in endless grief

Then I touched her face, and she looked at me
In my mind I heard a thousand silent cries
Gracious and sad, I closed in my head
And softly kissed her eyes

A smile replaced sadness and grief
Her body was healed, her wings were whole again
In that precious moment when she regained her strength
I felt tender pain as my life was slipping away

Now the Angel stands alone
Under crimson sky
Looking at the lifeless body
Never asking why

She looks up, spreads her wings
Beautiful and selfish, now she flies
Down below, in the cold darkness of night
Lies a man with tears in his eyes
