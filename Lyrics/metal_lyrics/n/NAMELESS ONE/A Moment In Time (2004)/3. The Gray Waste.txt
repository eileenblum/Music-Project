The sky is gray, the sun is black
Another day for me in this empty no-place
My life will soon fade from this cursed shell
And now that my soul is out of trace
Regret is the only thing that I can feel
An endless suffering makes this wasteland so real

Forbidden, soon forgotten, I wander alone
On the colorless horizon I see a familiar sight
Rays of pure light are dancing in the night
Glimmering silhouette now stands before me
In Her hands She holds a small, dark sphere
Vision flashes from a time long gone
End of my quest is now so near

My soul is Yours, it is obvious to see
Everything I am now belongs to Thee
