Have I seen too much of this world?
No
But I think I've seen enough
And what I saw I don't like

[Servus:]
From the top of the mountain
He is watching his frozen field
Harvesters of sorrow
Are doing well their jobs indeed

[Servus:]
Obviously satisfied He turns his look
But I see no happiness on his face
He walks slowly to his throne
A ruler of dark, forsaken place

[Servus:]
My Lord, is there something wrong?
Haven't all your orders been fulfilled?
Haven't all your enemies been destroyed
And their bodies buried deep in the silt?

[Emperor:]
No, Servus, nothing's wrong
Except the certainty of my fate
The fate that I have chosen
Since there was no choice to be made

[Emperor:]
We live our lives in a game
That someone else has made
We must play by their rules
Until our purpose begins to fade

[Emperor:]
So you see
It is my destiny
To watch the end of days

[Emperor:]
So far you have served me well
But if you could make a choice
Then what would you rather be?
Servant in Heaven or king in Hell
