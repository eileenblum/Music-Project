A seldom fair struggle between the strong and weak
Even absolute beginners are playing hide and seek
Chasing on each other in a race of love and hate
A race that never ends until time says it's too late

Then these killers of emotions now aware of their crime
Desperately try to catch a small moment in time

They live to suffer and feed on someone else's sorrow
Their souls are empty, their minds are hollow
Seeking love and happiness but their hearts are cold as stone
They build themselves a cage where they'll end up alone

Then they scream from their cage, praying for release
But the time has now run out and they'll never find their peace
Again

So they stand alone, scarred for all time
Pale, lost souls without a word to say
The game ends in silent agony
Tears of regret that fall can't wash the pain away
