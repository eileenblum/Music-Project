Centuries of preparation
Pulling the strings from behind the curtain
Patience is key to their crusade
Supremacy design

Dynasties, affiliated bloodlines
Chosen successors
Selected lineage
Interbreeding, incestuous purity
Methodical transfer of power
Perpetuate the line
Conservation of the sovereignty
Afraid to lose their well established reign

Deep-rooted societal values
Favors the belief in the mask
Erasing the true rationality
Of the ignorant

Privileged descent
Impregnable realm
Elite rulers
Well protected meticulous upper-class
Carefully guarded circle of command
Shameless syndicate intently willing to dominate
The credulous masses

Stranglehold on vital resources
Favors the belief in the mask
Erasing the true inference
Of the ignorant

Born not to become slaves
Our dignity is inalienable
Never to be dispossessed of our humanity

Nothing is unforeseeable in great disasters
No accidental events
Everything is part of the master plan
Seen as saviors
Protectors of normality
Wipe out the inferior ones
Reduce the remains to subjection

Providing the solutions to the problems they created
Favors the belief in the mask
Eliminating the judgment
Of the unaware

Born not to become slaves
Our dignity is inalienable
Never to be dispossessed of our humanity
Bred to become the ones
To refuse the oppression of the masters
The inner rebellion will overthrow their dominance

Awakening
Take the lead
Brace yourself for the transition
Choose to become a parasite
Terminate the barriers to allow the revolution
To flood the elevated consciousness

Rise against the perpetuators of ignorance
Refuse to believe in the doctrine
Demystify the traditional convention

Donât acknowledge
What they expound as
The absolute truth
Unspeakable mystery

Despise the appalling collusion
Conspiratorial machination
Asymmetrical war

Tyranny soon to be disintegrated

The uprising begins
Universal renewal
Advanced awareness
Revolt of the manipulated ones
Uncontrollable perception
Time for unification
Eradication of the master plan

[Chorus]
