Broken dreams, burned pathways in front of our eyes
Manipulation of our minds, visions of paradise
Allmighty leaders have sent us to Hell
Indoctrination of the youth
Defend the flag

We are the Nationâs offspring
Vital fluid feeding their frustration
Absence of humanity
Ever-continuing repetition
Identical consequences

Walking the path of glory
We try to deny our guilty conscience
Condemned to suffering
Fake principles we have never believed in
In our lifetime
Are what we fight for
Bound to a one mindâs will

Rotten Mankindâs pathetic issue
Self-destructive world
Greatness through destruction
Glory through chaos
In the end whatâs left?
Broken lives and tortured minds

We are the sceptical generation
Accept no guidance
Personal concept of existence
Our own beliefs are opposed to your
Addiction for domination

[Chorus]

What will the next generation look like
If we pass down this heritage
Desperate mankind, helpless robots
Programmed to
Accomplish its will

Forced to face the conflict
Unwilling fate
Follow this unreal vision
Perpetual

[Chorus 2x]
