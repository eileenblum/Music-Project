Madness has overwhelmed the sanity inside my brain
Connections start to weaken as my awareness grows
Those bright lights blind my barely opened eyes
I canât make the difference between thoughts and reality

Wandering through a dark despair indistinct memories
Remind my consciousness the perfect picture of the
Wholesome self I used to be
Initiating transformation
Lucidity eradication

Degeneration of the mind
Self-devastating process
Unstable mental parameters creating chaos within
Itâs the dawn of my inward downfall

Falling down
Into the depths
Of my utter insanity
Capitulating to my mind collapse

Prisoner of my own failed system
Unable to reach the light, stuck in an absence of concrete thoughts
Lost in the immensity of the cage created by the tormented soul
Unreality is absolute

Past inner euphoria has switched to a chaotic disorder inside
A new mental state where decay reigns

[Chorus]

Deviant cerebral fantasies submerging my brain

[Chorus 2x]
