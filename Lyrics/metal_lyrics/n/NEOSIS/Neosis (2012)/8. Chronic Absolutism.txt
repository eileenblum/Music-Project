Whereâs the passion?
Whereâs the light?
It has turned to black
Our feelings ainât dead
They have just evolved
These scars will eventually disappear
Itâs wide open
Read the back of my mind

Mind domination
No acceptance, no complaints
Thatâs how I fix problems I create
Infiniteâs my reign on your soul

Iâll run away
You wonât
Rule my sad life anymore
I wonât take
This pain (this pain)
I donât need to feel anymore

Kneel down to me, consider me
As your God, settle for obedience
Youâre not as strong as me
Youâll always pay for my mistakes
Thatâs how it works, happily linked
By this ring, I dominate I have all the rights
Itâs wide open
Read the back of my mind

[Chorus]

Whatâs left?
Great nothingness
Your heart and face
Have been torn to pieces, will you
Will you finally realize
Those empty promises
Will lead you to nothing

[Chorus]
