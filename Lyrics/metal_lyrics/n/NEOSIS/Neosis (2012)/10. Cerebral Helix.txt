Sweet memories of a once-perfect life
Thoughts free from this ugly guidance
Vital system not yet poisoned by the rottening fluid
Fake certainty soon to be blinding your mind

Take an outside look at your existence
Analyze of the past motivations
Flawless feeling, disorientation
Counterfeit mental bliss
Is your vision of life perfected by the liquid injected?
Losing all bearings
The faultless essence your tortured mind has created
Has overflowed into substance

Escaping whatâs real
Plunging your mind into this internal eclipse

Perpetually surrendering to nothingness
Sadness and guilt eating you away from the inside
Dragging yourself along
New acquisitions leading to self-destruction

Virtual serenity
Artificial

Escaping whatâs real
Plunging your mind into this internal eclipse
Synthetically
Reaching the thoughtlessness state youâve always desired

Lost in this cerebral helix
Ecstatic sensation
Chemical hysteria
Synthetic elation

Pure confusion
Has overwhelmed your yet weakened lucidity, lucidity
Impenetrable mind
Uncountable warnings
Locked inside your own head
Damaged vision blinded by your craving, your craving
This downward spiral seems to be endless

Flawless feeling
Counterfeit mental bliss
Artificial solace

[Chorus]
