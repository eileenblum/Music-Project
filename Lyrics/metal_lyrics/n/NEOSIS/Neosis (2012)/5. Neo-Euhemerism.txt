Genesis of humanity
Engineered by the advanced breed
Impulsive evolution
The alpha civilization

Mesmerizing gleams of light descending from the skies
Analogous life form emerging from the
Intensely bright halo
Inconceivable dream
Celestial creatures
No alternate truth

Creators from
Beyond the stars
Deified by inferior kinds
Develop a stammering humanity
Misunderstood technology

Worship the wise
Primitiveness
Ignorance is king
Anachronistic artifacts
Missing link

Undeniable greatness, higher intellect
Defectless enlightenment, absolute wisdom
Subjugated masses easily impressionable will be self-enslaved
By their invented beliefs
Sudden progress, intelligence, enhanced civilization
Illogical self-acquired knowledge
Assumed theories, apocryphal hypotheses
Certified history

[Chorus]

[Post-chorus]

[Chorus]

Worship the wise
