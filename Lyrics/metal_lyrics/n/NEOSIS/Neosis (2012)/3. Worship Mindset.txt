Defective decisions have been taken in the name of divine worship
Misinterpretations always lead to suffering
Eternal chaos
Everlasting martyrdom
Endless conflicts, bloodshed to satisfy the almighty divinity
Countless fallen souls for the sake of obsolete principles
Lives based on so-called sacred writings

Evolution
The new method will prevail
Witness
Behold the metamorphosis
The change will arise

Delusive idols will fade
Self spiritual

Dedication, complete devotion
Serve the master of all, sacrifice your existence to access the
Promised eternity, kingdom of light
Mystical place for the believers only
Sinners will find closed gates
How is that for righteous mindset?
Fearful life
Awaiting the judgment day
Purified slaves
The absolute being will never be wrong
Mankind to blame
Justified mayhem
Condemned to bow

Transformation
No archaic symbols to venerate
Activate the change

Delusive idols will fade
Self spiritual
The fabricated deity will die
The ignorance is gone

Never asked for authentication
Man-made creed
Personification of the daylight star
The worshiped is the answer to the unknown

The cult divides people
Time to reunite harmonize the humankind
Abandon the deep-anchored beliefs
Find the true light
Dig inside

Revolution
The new method will prevail
The new paradigm

[Chorus]

Find the light
