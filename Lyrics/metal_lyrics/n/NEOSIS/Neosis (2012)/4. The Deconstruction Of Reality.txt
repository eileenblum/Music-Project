Reset the brain
Erase the sane
The so-called real substance
Your eyes have witnessed
Soon to be disintegrated
Shattering your dreams

Customized vision generated by
The architect of the daydream
The great designer, the entity behind
This deceptive masquerade

Let go of the beliefs
And look at the fabrication
Distrust this false illusion

Below the surface of our human perception
Beneath the Believerâs perspective
Lies the Creator drawing the blueprints of our reality
Feeding its greed on weak minds

Prepare yourself for the grand awakening
Time to reveal the essence of existence
Contemplate, deconstruction of reality

[Chorus 2x]

Reach your boundless perception
Infinite awareness
Trust the connectedness
Defy the lie

Deep inside the inner self
Seek for the common light
The connections
The brightness is the generator
We are the mankind
Not a reflection of it

Not a reflection of it
Iâm the Creator itâs my reality
The reality is ours, the absoluteness
My world, my rules, my laws, my reality
We are the result of the projection
My greed, my mind, my thoughts, my reality
Brain conceptions of the universal mind

[Post-chorus]

[Chorus 2x]
