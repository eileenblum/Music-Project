[Lead Davis]

For one more day I stayed alive...
Trying to find another way
A path to sanity...
Like a shot from a gun I feel!

Conformation leads to ecstasy
I couldnât find another way...
A run for guns, agreed!
Living in this world of fear!

[Bridge:]
Release me for Godâs sake!

[Chorus:]
Now your time to die has come
Out of control
Beyond this point I go alone
Taking their lives
I donât even cared about you
Iâm out of control!
Out of control!

I will get you now my friend...
Donât try to escape from me...
Iâm the first rebellious...
Like a saint in hell you said?!

Resurrection leads to ecstasy
Never found another way
A run for guns, agreed!
Ruling in this world of evil!

[Bridge / Chorus]

Trusted by God I still believe
In the will of Heaven

[Lead Gustavo]
