Here comes the fear of been caught
They come to me after midnight hour!
What is the truth behind
that ancient nightmare?
They have sadness in their eyes,
and shadow deep in their souls!

They come from everywhere,
And everywhere is dark!
The loneliness of existence
destroyed all my dreams!
I went beyond in the land
of ancient nightmare,
trying to stay alive!

[Bridge:]
(The dark path)
Their search for paradise,
lead them to dark,
eternal pain!

Walking trough a valley of shadows...
Waking up, screams of fight!
To contemplate a life of sins,
Staying outta light!

[Bridge:]
[Chorus:]
From darkness, theyâre waiting, Iâm not alone!
Their voices echoing, before the light!

(Eternal sorrow)

Waking to sleep...
and take my walk slow...
Thinking about my fate, I cannot fear...
I learn by going where I have to go...

[Lead Marthus]

[Chorus]
