For my country I walk on the rain...
Bringing the death and leaving the pain!
Riding steel horses and striking at night
Fire and torches, blaze in our heart!

(A desperate fight)
Arrows crossing high
Flying through the skies
Listen to their cries...
Lord, please save us!

[Bridge:]
Charge!
And take their lives...
Fight!
We came to win and not to fall!

[Chorus:]
Marching we go
through the batlle we fight!
We fight with our heart!
Death and glory weâll find!
Steel believing in power and might!
Might of the Metal!
Hail and Kill!
With leather and spikes
we made the Metal...
March!!!
