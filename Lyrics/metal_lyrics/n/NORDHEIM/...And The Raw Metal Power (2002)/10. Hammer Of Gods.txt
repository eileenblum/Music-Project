Born in a royal family of gods!
A steady warrior, he rides the wind!
Crossing the skies, so fast and so high..
So high as the Spirit of war!

Thunder and bolts are coming from skies!
Striking their hearts, shattering their souls!
He fight, he is proud, he is a pillar of gods...
Defending his kingdom from hordes of Hell!

[Bridge:]
A sign of might...
And it will remain...
Remain until his kingdomâs fall!

[Chorus:]
(A fatherâs pledge)
From Rainbow gates...
Gates from stars!
He came to fight...
I came to fight trough the worlds
and timeless plans!
He came to kill...
I came to strike!
He came to fight...
I came to fight trough the worlds,
the hammer of gods!

(Repeat first verse)

Despite his fate he kept on fighting...
A terrible foe, a gift from his brother!
Death like reward he didnât care!
He defended his kingdom from hordes of Hell!

[Bridge / Chorus]

Unholy, unholy
Unholy alliance from Hell

[Lead Davis]

Destroy them, and crush them
No mercy for these bastards

[Lead Gustavo]
[Bridge / Chorus]
