Dark factories lie ahead of us
A dark sun burns!
These false prophets never...
Told us what it has

Behind this
A dreadful symphony
Behind this
A hollow tree of seed
Behind this
Denying all we need
Behind this
Despiteful world we live

[Bridge:]
How could it be our tomorrow?
If there arenât any shelters
How could they lie to me?
And if you say you know how
To live without sorrow
Then you are lying to me

[Chorus:]
There is no more time for me,
Many things I saw...
Many things I live
Thatâs my doomsday
There is no more time for them
Many things they know
Many truths they sold
Thatâs their doomsday

Foul words spreaded around us
A red star burns
Their false propaganda
Always lives

Inside your minds
Donât think, just believe
Inside your minds
All truth you need weâll give
Inside your minds
A lovely life to live
Inside your minds
Inside your minds if we need...youâll start to kill

[Bridge / Chorus]

[Lead Gustavo]
[Lead Davis]

A dreadful light above us
A red sun burnt
Their lies never meant any threats
To take the world
