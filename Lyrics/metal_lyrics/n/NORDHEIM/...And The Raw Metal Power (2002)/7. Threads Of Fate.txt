[Ridersâs Voice:]
Weâre gonna play God forever?
When weâre gonna learn?
To live our lives without regrets,
And always be the same!

[Bridge:]
On the threads of fate wise men walk...
From the threads of fate dead men come!

Wicked voice:
The chain of life has come to end...
Dissoluting void!
What came to be a human?
Look inside yourself!

[Bridge:]

Evil Voices:
Blood...feed me now!
Your life belongs to me!
Youâll never rest in peace!

[Chorus:]
No! I have no tears to cry,
when I close my eyes...
The shadows tell me to do what they want,
have no choice!
Iâm condemned by the night...

I feel like burning in hell,
far away from light...
The shadows tell me to do what they want,
have no choice!
Iâm condemned by the night!

[Lead Claudio]

Wicked voice:
Staying outta human cycle...
Awakened soul!

Riderâs voice:
Emptiness...
Sacrifice...
Fading outta life!

[Bridge:]

Evil Voices

[Chorus]

[Lead Davis]
