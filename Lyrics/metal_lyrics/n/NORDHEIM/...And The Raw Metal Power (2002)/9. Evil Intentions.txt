Twisting minds and souls of people
âHoly preachersâ
Victims of own schemes!

Envy, lust, geed, gully,
not shall rob or kill,
Deny this path and you
gonna find the guiding light

Landless lords manipulating
Theyâre abusing
Weâre victims of their sins!

Envy, lust, geed, gully,
not shall rob or kill,
Embrace this path and you
gonna find the darkest light...

see the grasp of the damn...
in the still of the noght!

[Chorus:]
Death and glory they found
Feeling the taunt of time
where this glory was found!

Frightened people called weaklings
They are their herds
Victims of their schemes!

Envy, lust, geed, gully,
not shall rob or kill,
Embrace this path and you
gonna find a twisted light...

Mesmerizing and controlling
Spreading their words,
Always living with fear!

Envy, lust, geed, gully,
not shall rob or kill,
Embrace this path and you
gonna find the final light...

Feel the cold of the dawn
In the still of the night!

[Chorus]

[Lead Gustavo]

Purest evil...
