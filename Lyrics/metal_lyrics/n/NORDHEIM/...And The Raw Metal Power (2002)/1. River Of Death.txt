From their hidden iced world...
Too many bravemen came!
They came to search for wealth and lies...
But all that they found was disgrace!
Even the strongest fight and fall...
Before the powers of death!
And if you hear this just try...
Donât wast your life in vain!

[Bridge:]
Maybe you donât believe my friend...
Maybe youâll never understand...
If you go down...down by this river...
The place of dying men!

[Chorus:]
If you hear this sound,
Maybe youâll never fall...
Listen to my prayers!
Coming from the ground,
Killing all around...
The place of dying men!

By passing this tale weâre trying to release...
The soul of the brave men from dark!
Even the strongest fought and fell...
Before the powers of death!
Those from above are caring for us...
Praying for triumph and glory!
And now this tale is finally over...
The curse of the dead will go on!
