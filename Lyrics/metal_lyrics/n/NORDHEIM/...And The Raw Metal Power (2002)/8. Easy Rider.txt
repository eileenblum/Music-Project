Itâs time to take off
And live the life at fastest speed
And feel the fire, live the pain
Sorry pal, but I gotta go!

There are times you let go,
But there are times you must stand
ground and fight!

[Bridge:]
Living on the edge
Growing up in flames
Screaming!
And feeling!
My pain!

Burning tires, wheeling flames
Riding outta hell, Iâm an easy rider!

But now itâs time to return
To get back the things youâve lost
And live in fire, heal your wounds
Thatâs the pace of life, my friend!

[Bridge:]

[Chorus:]
Burning tires, never tamed
Riding outta hell, Iâm easy rider!
Burning tires, heart in flames
Riding outta hell, weâre easy rides!

[Lead Davis]

[Chorus]
