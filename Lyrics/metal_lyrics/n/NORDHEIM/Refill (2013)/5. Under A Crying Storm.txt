Alone in the depths of my mind 
For me, no light to find
Bound to the curse of my kind 
I drown... in wine

The thirst I can't fight
Someday will blow my life
No I'm better
I am your fire

Under a crying storm they lie 
Under a siege of sorrow they'll die 
They'll live damnation tonight 
Damnation...

Alone in the depths of their wind 
For them, no light to find
Bound to the curse of their kind 
They drown... in wine

The thirst they can't fight 
Someday will blow away their life 
They're not better
They'll burn forever

Satan awaits!
In the rotting flames of hell
For the lives you tore and break ...and broke
Time to awake

Repent! Regret!
