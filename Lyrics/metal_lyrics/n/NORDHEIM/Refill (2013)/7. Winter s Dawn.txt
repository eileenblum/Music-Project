Snow falls and rules through the land
In this winter's dawn
Icewinds will blow forever
Making my beer cold as the north

Oh! Yeah!

Making my way through the storm, 
searching for a place, warm
Finally an inn, a beer and a slut, 
a place I can call home...

We're fighting, we're fucking, we're drinking to death
And we're taking a piss down the hall

YEAH!

There's tucking ice wherever... I see 
There's way too much for me 
There's no more juice to feed our amps 
That's why the vikings didn't stand a chance

THEY DIED!
