With no ambitions I crawl
Waiting for a life to come to me at once
Chimeras aren't real but pain is as cold as steel
Nothing but failure I feel
The day is a witness of these broken dreams
Which makes my joy disappear
Join me in the night, to this shit we'll be blind
And rum will take us for a ride

As shadows pass by, I drink to the night
Reaper of sorrow, this joy so hollow
As shadows pass by, this night will be mine
Jon us and bring In some wine
(don't spill the wine)

Morning light struck, your brain is completely fucked
You come back to your pool of broken hopes and weep
The day has been right, you're way too weak to fight
You better get your ass back into (the) night. Eaah!

[Chorus]

Now strong I am, never weak again, never again
The sea of star is now more than an illusion
Time to awake!
As the wind in the sky now free I fly

[Chorus]
