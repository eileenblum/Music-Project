Lurking in the shadows he waits,
threatened again
Howling to the stars for a bloody wake
Under a frozen sun,
His gaze pierces the flesh
Staring at the ones that'll soon be dead

The frost in the eyes
The anger inside
As he wears now the mask
of the banned one

Night be on his side
so that his foes be blind
Grant him vengeance through
the bleeding of the flesh
Shadows will hide him
with a cold embrace
