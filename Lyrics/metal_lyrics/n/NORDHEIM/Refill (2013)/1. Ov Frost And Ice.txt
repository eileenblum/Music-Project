Under the northern star, I've found my heart
Ice cold wind I breath darkness fulfills my dreams
This region of ice will stand through time

The kingdom of mine is built ov frost and ice
Landscapes all painted white
Not even shadows are safe from this cold

Winds blow colder,
the storm gets closer
Come almighty winter
Got rid of all this tucking world

Deaths, obsessions, drugs, addictions 
We bury our dreams tit we all disappear 
And sorrow wraps us all with his cold

A neverending nightmare
leading to nowhere
A kingdom so black and old 
From ashes to ashes, I am done

A soul tortured by hate
and this soul was mine
I hope you'll never find

A soul tortured by hate
and this soul was mine
Hope that it never awakes
