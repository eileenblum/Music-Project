Soldiers of Thor
now rot under the ground
Swallowed by a land so cold
Fuck off! This ain't no place for the weak! UH!
Winds, snowstorm, ice, sorrow, thunder, war! [2x]

Winter killed the hopes
of your ardent tribes
Here we stand proud

This is where we lived and we'll die
Fading in the storm
We'll raise our horns high
As we watch the raven die
