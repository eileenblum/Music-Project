Fearless warrior fucking kills the mass
For glory and fame
Humping girls, saving realms

He'll destroy the evil, dwelling in his cave
Drunk and brave
Fuck him up, get his scales

Searching for soulblood hidden in the dragon's heart
I will kill him until he dies
I will kill him and so his child

He went to that cave to slay the mighty dragonlord
With blood and sweat he paid his place on the throne

Now he reigns, he's got many slaves
And he'll drink ale until the end of his days
