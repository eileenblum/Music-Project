My tears turn to frost
Then die on the ground
Soaked by sorrow of many
I am done, ashes to dust

The grief tears my soul
Left on my own
As lifeless winds blow colder
Sorrow tainted my heart
Now ethereal
Now ethereal

Why grief won't you forsake me!
I won't live until you turn away!

Tortured by time
A shadow rules over me
A nightmare awake, neverending
Loved ones forgive me...
Forgive me
