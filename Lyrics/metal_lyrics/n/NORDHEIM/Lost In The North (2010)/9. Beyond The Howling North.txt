Gracious and controlled by wind she wipes
Out the warm
Unbearable coldness defying my life... i fear
Mountains stand, majestic, we are charmed by
The beauty of the north
A dark charisma in a land so pale is killing me

Her mouth shouts the snow
Her veins bleed the wind
Her tears.. the frost

Only the stars and time can see beyond the
Howling
Only stargazers have learned the path
To go within the endless dreams and chase
Reality
Winter is queen in here

Glowing in the night with silver light, day's
Demise

Beyond the howling north
Beyond the howling north

Gracious and controlled by wind, she wipes
Out the warm
Unbearable coldness defying my life... i fear
Mountains stand, majestic, we are charmed by
The beauty of the north
A dark charisma in a land so pale... is killing me
