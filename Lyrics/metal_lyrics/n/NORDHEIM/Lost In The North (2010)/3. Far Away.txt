Lost in the cold fields,
Where the wind blows
Aching, raging, freezing our eyes
Our wisdom, failed
And our swords shattered

We paid the price, for a lost fight
Brothers, sisters, devoured by them
Our children, died
Why all this bloody mess

Will i reach my land again
Far away, far away
Will i reach it once again
Fuck it all, not at all
Will i reach my land again
Far away
Will i reach it once again
From this madness be free

Farewell brothers, fly high, with the fire
Farewell brothers, fly high, with the fire

I see again their teeth, piercing our flesh
Shouting and jumping, tearing us apart
Odin grant me a wish, please
I want to see a troll die

Farewell brothers, fly high, with the fire
Farewell brothers, fly high, with the fire
