Strong warrior that fought across the
Land
One man army waiting for foes
A gaze that could pierce into the dark
To find those who hide black hearts

It's never been
It wasn't proved

Old crazy man we're sick
Of your damn talk
We wont get fooled... no!
Old crazy man screw you
Get out of my face
I'd rather say... fuck you!

Supposed spawn of a troll king
A dark one that wears black wings
Imposing one that wakes at the dawn
And slays those who walk alone

What's wrong with you?
Just get drunk you too
