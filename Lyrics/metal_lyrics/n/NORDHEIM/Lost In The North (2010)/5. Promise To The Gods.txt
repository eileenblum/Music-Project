Up north there's a land
Legacy of our men
Once soiled by blood

Wait for the sky to show the way
To wash our tears away
To heal the wounds of our severed heart

Why can't we break
Through the pain
Cant chase the black out of my veins

Another night another dawn
I'll promise to the gods
(that) i'll fill the oceans with their blood

Embraced by sorrow
Caressed by a curse so black
Washing, tainting my soul

The coldest fear in the strongest one
A storm came and broke their heart
Brave men fought until a claw... came
Kiss their skull

Up north there's a land
Legacy of our men
Shattered by trolls

Wait for the sky to show the way
To wash our tears away
To face the darkest day

Why can't we break
Through the pain
Can't hide from that bloody rain
