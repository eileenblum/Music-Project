Deep in the night... dark night
A warrior will rise... for the fight
Blood in his eyes

Out from the fog... dark fog
Fist hard as rock... to knock
Fear he knows not

And rising, above all soldiers of time
Floating in the memories	
Hiding beneath the stars
In the infinity of the sky
He is born from the night
Swimming and wandering in our
Thoughts
Forevermore... forevermore

Nightborn, sword in hand
The one for you to become
Faceless fiend in eternal night
Nightborn, the one for you to become
Arise now and die

And rising... above all soldiers of time
Floating in the memories
Hiding beneath the stars
In the infinity of the sky
He is born from the night
Swimming and wandering in our
Thoughts
Forevermore... forevermore
