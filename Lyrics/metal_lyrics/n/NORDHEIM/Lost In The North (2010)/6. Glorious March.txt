Swords and bones clash on the shore
Fighting for glory
Fight for your land

Blood, guts, pain all around
Smell of death surrounds me
Charge for your pride

Fueled by the snow that covers the
Mountains
And by the wind that rages in the north!
March to your death... to your funeral
Go on your way... go (and) feed your blade

Sorrow drains fear out of our men
Rage takes control of us
Bury your own heart

Ravens fly as people die
Blinded by darkness
Feeding on our corpses

I went on (the) mountains high
So i can see odin in the eyes
He granted (to) our tribe wit power and
Might
So now warriors stand and stay alive

Swords and bones clash on the shore
Fighting for glory
Fight for your land

Blood, guts, pain all around
Smell of death surrounds me
Charge for your pride
