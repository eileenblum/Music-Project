Lost in the north, the men sing
Lalalalala!
Through the storm
Until the dawn
Riding on the roaring sea
Lalalalala!!!
As we are sailing the drakkar

Lost in sea, i feel the winds battling me
Strong and fierce, i shall survive

Waves whip, the dragonheads then sleep
Wooden gods, off the coast

Thirty men stop the ship for a fight
Drawing swords and their spears high

From (the) seas, we have come once more
To conquer (the) coasts once for all
