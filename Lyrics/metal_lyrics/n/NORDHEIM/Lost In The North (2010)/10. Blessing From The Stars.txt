I have seen in a dream...
A perfect, cloudless night
Where suns are shinning
Bright as candlelights

Never, such beauty can be forgotten
Never, such emptiness can fulfill my heart

I am seeking... your wisdom
I am seeking... your guidance

And again i'm lost in the pool of of my
Thoughts watching the night sky
Led by the lights,
Gazing at the northern star
