The sky is turning brown and the trees are shriveling up
Pollutants are rising, colliding, and raining down
We thought the end would be aflame, with deadly shrieks of pain
We thought the fury would pour straight from our very souls
And the bastards' heads would stare down from the tops of poles
But we started at the end
We started at the end...

Unwittingly, we mimic society
With our sub-sects, genres, and in-fighting
Not realizing that our constant agitation
Has roots in our need for transient migration
To exist like this is a constant struggle
And sanity is a state of mind reserved for the passive

We stopped watching the news 'cause we couldn't take it anymore
We've been a plague upon this earth since a long long time ago
We try and try to stop the tide, but we know we're all doomed
We're drowning in our own confusion, reaching for the moon
We squirm and twitch as our nature persists
Telling us we can't live this way, we must resist
We're dreamers, wide awake amid comfortably sleeping sheep
Lazy grazers, passively placid, constantly telling us
"Rest your head, you worry too much"...

I woke up in a cold sweat from a dream that has come true
The end times are upon us and there's nothing we can do
We're pollinating hatred at a rate the bees can't match
And the Devil's mouth is open and we're going down the hatch

Apocalyptic nightmares seem so quaint compared to this
A creeping, slow decay of life which we all seemed to miss
And what we miss is always all that nature seems to catch
We've ripped the earth wide open and we're going down the hatch

The padlock on the gates of hell hangs from a rusty slot
And keeping that thing locked seems like the only chance we've got
But we invented hell and that's why we're the key that turns the latch
And the Devil's mouth's wide open and we're going down the hatch

Why do we participate so willingly?

A dependent stain
In our isolation
We remain reluctant, fawning parasites
Rising, colliding, and raining down
