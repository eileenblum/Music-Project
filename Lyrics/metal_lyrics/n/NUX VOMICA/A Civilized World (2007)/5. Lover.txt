So you want your emotions on the table, revealed? Heartfelt hatred for all the injustices, unfairness; love for individuals in all their imperfect beauty; intolerant of all the jabbing, stabbing ugliness of humanity. Emotions so unstable, you're married to your ideals, and
with all the passion you hare, you're splitting at the seams. But ho the fuck are you cheating on, lover? Who's the last person to look in your eyes, remember the lies, and give you everything you couldn't return? As you take another stab at the so called "system", and all
the people you burned demand the respect they're earned, will you start to see the metaphor that is your life? Will you start to recognize yourself as a cinder block in the foundation of this house you want razed? Overestimated your loyalty once again, as you stepped out of
and into character, not really knowing which was which, and dwelling on the guilt just long enough to give yourself one more little jabbing, stabbing pain in your head the conflict ensues.
