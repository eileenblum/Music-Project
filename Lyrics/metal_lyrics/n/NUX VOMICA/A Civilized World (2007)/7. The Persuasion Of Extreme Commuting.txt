Your ancestry of vile acts filters down into your daily life without you knowing. Voices of the past whisper in your ear, in your sleep, in your ear... insisting that you must hurt, you must take, you must destroy, you must eat delicious succulent hamburgers from squeaky clean
fast-food restaurants, you must shop at places in large buildings with large parking lots of fluorescent lights, you must see a comforting familiar logo everywhere you go, when you traverse the city, you must forget that everything you see was and is supposed to be a forest, a
swamp, a valley, or just plain underwater. But you don't do anything bad. You don't rob, murder, rape, slaughter, cheat, steal... that machine in your driveway has these concepts built right in, from grille to pipe, tread to antenna... from the foundry that made the bolts to
the Colombian farm that harvested the plants that produced the beans to make the coffee in the cup (with the logo) in the cupholder next to your shifting rod. You smile as you make your merge, safe in the knowledge that if it snows, you still get to work a full 8 hours...
under the fluorescence of progress.
