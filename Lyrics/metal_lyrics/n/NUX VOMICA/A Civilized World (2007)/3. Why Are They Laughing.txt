And there's a crowd laughing. And a year from now, or a few, they won't remember what they where laughing at, they'll just remember laughing. They'll remember how they laughed, and where they laughed, and how it felt when they laughed, and that they laughed, and they'll
laugh, and they'll talk about how funny that was, and they'll not remember what was that "that" was, but that "that" was what they did: they laughed. And there's a crowd laughing. Why are they laughing. Why are they laughing? Do they know why they're laughing? And there's a
solemn crowd, and a sobbing, loud cry. And a tear falls on a pile of bricks with a broken arm sticking out. Sirens and gunshots don't turn a single head, as common as the sun and moon and stars as they shine on every one and everything. And they'll never forget why they where
crying. They'll never forget how it felt, how it feels. In another place, an imread paperlines in a trashcan. A headlines reads "37 killed in some place you can't pronounce", and the crossword and the sports section are tucked under someone's arm, and that person is laughing.
Why are they laughing? Do they know why they're laughing?
