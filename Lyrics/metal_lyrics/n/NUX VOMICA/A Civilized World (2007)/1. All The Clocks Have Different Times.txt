The strangest thing was realized
By a thoroughly depressed, detached, angry, confused young product of a ridiculous, hypocritical, bloated society:
All the clocks have different times

The time spent fumbling for the keys in the house
Was lost in the car where the time stood still
Rush hour started right on time
Only to continue until it became
Rush day...rush week...rush yeah...rush millenium...rush age

When the clock strikes one, the clock strikes many
When the clock struck twelve, it struck hard
It struck again and again and again and again
Hour after agonizing hour
Like clockwork
Until one person realized

All the clocks have different times

Like so many monumental moments in history
Some rejoiced, while others fell flat on their faces
Most just stuck to their routines,
Watched the clocks,
And checked their watches

Trying desperately
To keep them all the same
