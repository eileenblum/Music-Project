Crushing everything in sight, the invaders begin their bloody onslaught
They scratch and scrape and cut and pick at the ground, the trees, the rocks, the streams, and every living thing
Poking holes in the dirt, drilling and extracting, sending microscopic dragons up to burn holes in the sky
Brutish machines, all hard lines and heavy with technological baggage, flatten the mountains and block the rivers

Killing seems to be synonymous with existence to these invaders
Without mercy they spill the blood of anyone they see as a threat
And slaughter just about everyone and everything else
Just in case

A confused and childish bunch, these stupid fools don't fall in line with their natural surroundings
They try to manipulate nature
To fit their needs, fit their plan

They build straight up while trees branch outward
They dig straight canals while rivers meander
They pour hard concrete on the cool soft soil
They pump oil to the surface while underground it has a purpose

Level the forest to live in a box
Fences, walls, and doors with locks
'Cause the fools don't even trust each other
No tribal mentality
No sisters, no brothers

Their lives are full of lies and deceit
You can see it on their faces
No inner peace, such anger and tension
Treacherous villains full of hate and agression

Worst of all, they seem to think
That what they're doing really matters
