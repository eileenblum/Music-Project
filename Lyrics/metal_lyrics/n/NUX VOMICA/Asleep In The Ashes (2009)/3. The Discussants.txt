The discussants on the panel have all the answers and all the questions
The discussants force the issues, leaving no question left unbegged, no stomach left unchurned
Let that acid burn, burn, burn...
Burn a hole straight through let them see what questioning has done for you

The discussants lie in bed and twitch, discussions leak from their parted lips
They dream they're a wave that lies to the shore, they roll over, snore, and lie some more
When they're done lying down, they get up and fly, and their discussions shoot across the sky

From state to state and station to station, they're playing hardball, defacing the nation
Through channels and airwaves they get in your head, making you think that you thought what they said

And you see them again, nodding heads, wearing ties, gesticulating and animated
Professional discussers through and through, they'll discuss a hole in you
They disgust you over dinner as they fill you with discussed issues skirted by a curtain of lies
Which washes away with the tide, leaving the shoreline exposed

And the questions pile up like driftwood, old and withered
Once towering in height, now hollow and light, beaten, battered, and scattered
And you realize what questioning has done for you
You've never had a question answered, always had your answers questioned

Never had a chance to ask a question your way, never had your say...
And a question has never increased your pay. Never.
Question.
