Traveling across a vast expanse
Long canoes and handmade rafts
Navigational skills unsurpassed
The first to walk upon the golden sands

A thousand years, perhaps a thousand more
Island dwellers for centuries form
A union with the sky, sea, and land
Their history taught with legends and chants

One fateful day an usual sight
On the horizon, exotic ships
Tall masts with colorful flags
God-like figures with tri-cornered hats

Bedraggled sailors from an unknown place
Pale faces with mischievous eyes 
Cast their gaze upon a glorious prize
Landfall is made and the captain steps down

From this day life is never the same
For the settlers of the island chain
Haole came and Haole took
So the islanders kill captain cook
So begins the sad and steady decline
Of a people from a simpler time...

More and more and more outsiders come in 
From every corner of the Earth
And everyone wants to educate
And show the primitives the modern times
Christianize, industrialize, imperialize, and the natives confusion and disillusion 
Leads to their diffusion and their demise....

Pulled all direction for 200 years
The last of the monarchies falls...

Polluted city sprawls across the southern rim
Rush hour has the buses stuck in traffic again
A man stumbles, children pointing at him
He's not conditioned for a world this grim

His eyes are burning like two tiny suns
He wonders what happened to his paradise
He holds a bottle and stares at the street
Cup full of coins is sitting at his feet

His family camps illegally in parks
Shantytowns of tents, trailers, and tarps
Their legacy is now a tourist hell
Tiki torches burn outside of the mall

KAUMAHA...
