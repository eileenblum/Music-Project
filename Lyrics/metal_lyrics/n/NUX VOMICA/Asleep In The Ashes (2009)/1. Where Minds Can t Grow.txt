In a section of the city seldom seen by the scene
Sectioned off from the world of intellectual educated affluence
People live lives and people die, beautiful lives, meaningful deaths
Leaving behind a wealth of evidence initials on a sidewalk
A broken baby carriage, spent shells and pink barrettes

Arranged in the dirt with chunks of cement, a collage of sights that nobody sees
A barrage of sounds too loud to hear, a cycle of despondent generations surrounded by depressing scenes on desolate streets
Crack whores, liquor stores, boarded up doors
Where Minds Can't Grow

And children don't know there's more, shards of glass smashed to sand in the pavement
Blowing in the diesel wind of a yellow bus bound for a haven of corruption and mistrust
Paint chips, red rust, and a failing system teaches the youth that there's not enough money

And a failing system can't trick the youth into thinking that its working
Wealthy racists keep the schools from educating youth
Poverty is violence, ghettos are the proof

A kid gets jumped on the way to school, he shows up ten minutes late
The principal gives him a lecture about the importance of education
The kid says "My mother's in a coma, my dad is gone, my brothers got shot, and they all went to your fucking school!"

He gets up, runs down the hall, walks out the door, turns around and says "Fuck you!" 
"Now its payback time." He's looking for the kids who jumped him
Another angry youth in the street....
