My God is dead
My Goddess is dead

Infected with deceit, rabid and sadistic
Resisting our potential, self-loathing, schizophrenic 
Unworthy, lowly, filthy, diseased, materialistic
Our God is dead
He's turned his back on us
Our Goddess is dead
She had no faith in us, she has no use for us

Orphaned we pray for an afterlife
Abusers - While we  make the life we have
Building - Towers to house our giant egos
Erasing - Ideals and heroes
Losing - Our ability to function naturally
Unaware that our time's up
In denial of our own death

Running through the dark, we convince ourselves it's light
We laugh and carry on, while all day long it's night
Deserted and forsaken, our hope's a flimsy veil
Our existence is cosmetic, our lives are all for sale
Eternal guilt and infinite regret
Our sentence is a mirror, and we deserve it
Leave a hole in the side of the coffin
So you can reach out and drive the last nail
And as the dirt gets piled on, rest assured in peace
Cause your check's in the mail

We are deserted
We are abandoned
Dead
