A king of obscene delights, a hopeless life
A sick attempt to perpetuate grimation
The torment built in me, I took no fright
When the time is right the cracks will start to break it down, down!
So my will was not found, a grimace that embodies the late is undone
I'm amoken and hell bound, suicidal thoughts â seduction all around
So my will was not found, a grimace that embodies the fate is undone
I'm amoken and hell bound, suicidal thoughts all around
This is farewell for now, I didn't know that I could...
No passion lives in here, I still don't know if I should...
My world will shepered me, condemned by everyone
A man in tears â embracing lunacy
I'll make the devil wither, he's still hiding behind the sun
When the time is right the cracks will start to brake him down, down!
So my will was not found, a grimace that embodies the late is undone
I'm amoken and hell bound, suicidal thoughts â seduction all around
So my will was not found, a grimace that embodies the fate is undone
I'm amoken and hell bound, suicidal thoughts all around
finally emancipation, it hammered in my brain
Again and again and again and again...
I'm shedding skin to rid my self from the lies
And from the painful truth of life demise
No bitter sight and no fear left in me
New man is born, I king obscenity
I'm a new man â a king obscenity
