Come winds of time, come swallow us
Spitting out our hatred, burned and found the past
No goddamn sun reflects in no goddamn light
A fevered circle, each day and night
The beautiful wounds from within
Go hand in head with my dreams of sin
With the corruption that lied at the end
The fire burns within us
Out through the sacred gate
Check out your files, collect the lies
The lament novel of a soul demise
All of it true as I stayed in the cold
To count the dead hours
?????????????
How could I declare, that I liked them all?
Those who mourn and turn away my soul
I put the last nail in your mental coffin
Sent it to your loss
Straight into your fears

Did you ever danced, with your demons inside
For just inflected wounds
Have you ever danced, with the demons that surround you, once, to face the
truth
Hand in hand, this fear I hear
From your voice, getting clear

We believe in silent empire
We adore our fields of dreams
We paint your empty god in black
And set ablaze your circle of dreams
