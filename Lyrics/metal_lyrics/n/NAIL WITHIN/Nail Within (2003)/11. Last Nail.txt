Knife will cut your flesh
Sinful hateful crime
Touch the colored knife

Clock is ticking back
With obscene delight
In my arms tonight...

Ripping all their minds
To your own demise
Paint your god in black
And the colors inside...

Pictures of our pride
Like a knife that cuts to me
I wallow in melancholy

3 dimensions of the "I" not in vengeance
And the power lied inside
Swan song from the rotten kingdom
And a place of mine
In my sleep, the nightmares fade
Disappeared the bleeding dark
I live in a strengthful kingdom
Nail within the facts...
