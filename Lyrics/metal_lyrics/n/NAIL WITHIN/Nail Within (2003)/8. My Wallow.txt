I've told you once and I'll tell you again
The game that you play only brings pain
Make up your mind, put my care to an end
I want to hate you but I really can't
The stare you gave me was full of pain, like a knife that cuts through me
The stare that made the difference is the one that sets me free
The stare you gave me was full of pain I wallow in melancholy
The stare that's made the difference is the one that sets me free
I've told you once I'll tell you again
I have nothing to lose and the world to gain
My wallow bestows me, never descent
I want to hate you but I really can't
The stare you gave me was full of pain, like a knife that cuts through me
The stare that made the difference is the one that sets me free
The stare you gave me was full of pain I wallow in melancholy
The stare that's made the difference
Is the one that sets me free
Black are the feelings that live inside me
I wallow in melancholy
If I could turn back time I would...
Black are the feelings that live inside me
I've been waiting patiently, but your embrace is long forgotten...
In a bed of lies you lay!
And I'm living for today, I through my pain all away!
No time to linger in dismay, but your getting in the way...
Would it be different today â in a bed of lies you lay
You still have many hearts to slay, I'll wallow along the way...
