Time passes as only time knows how
Scared tissue always stays scared and out of sight
Don't seek comfort in my arms tonight
There is no care left in me
Elastic we, with vanity I scream upon the skies
Quick to despair quick to demise
Forgotten how to bleed, forgotten how to will ignites
How your heart ignites
Elastic we, not hard to see â we always end up the same
Elastic we, no guilt in me â for we always end up the same
No care, no loss, no pain for we â always end up the same
No care, no lost, no pain, I'm free
Your gagged eyes can't fill the holes
Once I'm seductive, once I'm disposed
Elastic we, not hard to see â we always end up the same
Elastic we, no guilt in me â for we always end up the same
No care, no loss, no pain for we â always end up the same
No care, no lost, no pain, I'm free â and you are lonely again
Standing here I see tomorrow pass by casually
So brief, so pail, a living memory time passes as only time knows how
Scared tissue always stays scared and out of sight
Don't seek comfort in my arms tonight
There is no care left in me
No care, no loss, no pain for we â always end up the same
No care, no lost, no pain, I'm free â and you are lonely again
You are lonely again!
