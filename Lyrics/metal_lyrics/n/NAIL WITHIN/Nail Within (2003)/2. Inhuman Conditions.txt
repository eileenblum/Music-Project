For this I declare as bleeding hope
Where skin touch skin with a frozen mind
For this I declare as bleeding soul
Where skin screech skin in the frozen sun
Gathered for altering the elements of hope
Bodies filled with rotten minds

Eyes stared in fever, as mine stared in gray
Hidden by a pistol's crime
Where all been written on skin, upon bones
Feeding a weeping mankind

Skin upon skin upon bones over blood
Spiritually military crime
"paint it red", a requiem of words
till the sound of the end just smiled
oh take me down to the place I've been
here the blood shall bleed like a blood red wine

Eyes stared in fever, as mine stared in gray
Hidden by a pistol's crime
Where all been written on skin, upon bones
Feeding a weeping mankind

GATHERED FOR ALTARING THE ELEMENTS OF HOPE
BLOODY RISE OF THE DIMENTIONS YOU'LL NEVER KNOW
NAILED BY THE HIGHEST FORM OF INNER LAW
ONE BY ONE...

Eyes stared in fever, as mine stared in gray
Hidden by a preachful crime
Where all been written on skin, upon bones
Feeding a weeping mankind
