Hours surrounded by the codes of despair
Touch the skin, embrace the tears of farewell
Spirits' infection was under the roar
Fingers touched a broken glass, wounded &amp; cold
The razor, are we to feel his tongues?
Or is it a path to cover the loss?
Eyes to find and hold it within
Emotion's flood or purest blood but not untitled as "sin"

Impure, by a million eyes
An inner strength from me to your soft delight
At dawn...

Is this your farewell? I still doubt if I could
But passion lights my sign, I know I should
As worlds rattle in me, I know I'll fight
No man in tears is embracing lunacy
I'll make the devil wither behind the sun
As the time has come, to break it down

Impure, by a million eyes
An inner strength from me to your soft delight
At dawn....

I looked back to face those codes of despair
And sent a spark, a sign, a moment to be heard
Remembered, he found silence home of the brave
I smell your skin through the fears and our grace
I shredded my skin to rip myself from the lies!!

I looked ahead, a pair of eyes staring in
Wave of truth from what they call sin
Empire â under the earth
With chains of bronze it's locked for no one to break
At dawn, we felt embraced
I'll lead you through THEIR way to OUR promised place
Where flames burn higher, but those flames are for good
We built our kingdom in the world of the wolves
