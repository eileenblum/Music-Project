Comes as a dirty colored knife
Bright in mirrors' gray
One by one, a symbolized blood, reflected pits of pain

With these eyes, mesmerized, by power infection that brutally died
Hours, another dimension of moments
Moments, reflection, the countdown clock is thrown aside
Ever scarred, skinless can bite

Comes from corners, shadows might
Wounds that never heal
Scarred by time a pistols' crime
Declare the things I feel
Bleed, feed, hateful sinful crime
Bleed, feed, mankind

with these, my eyes, I remember years I've been told
"ignore, our crimes, trapped skinless and cold"
with these, my rites, I'll remember years I've been told
"ignore, our cries, trapped, skinless and.. trapped, skinless and... cold"
times of loss ever scarred again reflected pits of pain

times of loss mixed with fever and dust
in the dawn hour they cry
ever seen, ugly faces of fear
ever scared

times of loss scarred again, reflected pits of pain

With these eyes, mesmerized, by power inflection that brutally died
Hours, another dimension of moments
Moments, reflection, the countdown clock is thrown aside
Ever scarred, skinless can bite
