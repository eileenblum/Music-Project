It feels tight
An aggression, naked skin colored red and bright
Is it failure of minds? Or a matter you always feared to declare as right?
Hear their cries â your pathetic mental world stated: numb-deaf-blind
And the clock strikes ten, kill your boundaries again
As it lashes you...

WHIPPING ALL THOSE CROWDED NAMES
WHIPPING THEIR MINDS
CROWN OF THORNS IS WHAT THEY WORSHIP
WILL LEAD YOU TO YOUR SELF DEMISE
AS A SNAKE WHO THROWS HIS SKIN â THROW OUT YOUR KNIFE
BLEED THEIR WOUNDS
FOREVER OPEN
WHIPPING THEIR MINDS!!

Cry out inside
You're locked in chains of the past painted gray &amp; might
As the color of (your) life
Can be seen on skin painted red/ gray/ bright

WHIPPING ALL THOSE CROWDED NAMES
WHIPPING THEIR MINDS
CROWN OF THORNS IS WHAT THEY WORSHIP
WILL LEAD YOU TO YOUR SELF DEMISE
AS A SNAKE WHO THROWS HIS SKIN â THROW OUT YOUR KNIFE
BLEED THEIR WOUNDS
FOREVER OPEN
WHIPPING THEIR MINDS!!

Cut! the oppression!
Adore the hypnotic cleansing of your mind
Definition! they dominate your flesh but failed in their minds
Impression! spit in the faces of the ones who ignore your soul
Pain obsession! never allow their needs to taint your goal!!

As you hide
As they hit your skin to satisfy their crimes
As you're tied up naked, bonded and they hide..
No surrender for the ones who will take your soul..

Whipping their minds â nail them to their coffin â eternal lies â turn it to
their demise!!

Turn it to their demise
Make their liberty a game
Use your strength to rise
Let them live with bleeding hands
It feels right
An aggression from grownup skin and a grownup pride
It's the failure of mind
And a question â you know the answer â it's down inside!!
