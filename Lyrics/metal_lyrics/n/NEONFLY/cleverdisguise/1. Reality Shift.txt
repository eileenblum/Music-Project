A Nocturne painted on the wall
Eyes looking from the canvas beckoning me
Come with me and set me free
Your senses deceive you
Come with me and you will see this isn't a dream

Afraid I try to run and hide
The colors in my palette seem to have run dry
Take your chance and step inside
A new life is waiting
The voice is not inside your mind the voice is alive

I wish I could see the world I have painted
Step inside make the artwork complete
And those eyes staring back like a mirror
Shift reality

Now I know there's no chance to hide, no chance to get away
No chance to pretend that I don't hear it calling
Come with me and set me free
Your senses deceive you
Come with me and you will see this isn't a dream

I wish I could see the world I have painted
Step inside make the artwork complete
And those eyes staring back like a mirror
Shift reality

Come with me,
Set me free,
Come with me,
Set me free,
Come with me.
Come with me,
Set me free.

Contrast and harmony the painting is complete
There's nobody there, silent and empty
I have come to set you free
I have found the answer
Trapped inside a world of dreams, where's reality?

I wish I could see the world I have painted
Step inside make the artwork complete
And those eyes staring back like a mirror
Shift reality
