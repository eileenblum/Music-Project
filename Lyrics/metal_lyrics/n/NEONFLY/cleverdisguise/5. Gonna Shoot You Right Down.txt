Heartbreaker
Caught in a web of broken dreams
When you face reality
Life's not as easy as it seems

No time
To cry
This time we take no prisoners

Smile for the cameras
Until you choke on vanity
You'll make the headlines
You blow them all away, you're only seventeen

Dream of life among the stars and shiny silver diamonds
There's a price to pay for that, and a gun that's gonna shoot you right
Down!
And a gun that's gonna shoot you right down

Heartbreaker
You're back again out on the streets
Just because someone broke your heart doesn't mean
That I'll be there to dry your tears

Take all your chances
And try to steal the show from me
No easy feat babe
My weapon's loaded and the devil's on the scene

Heartbreaker

You can spend your money and spend your time
You can waste your life if it gives you peace of mind
Then you change your ways and pretend you're fine
You're not fooling me!!!

Dream of life among the stars and shiny silver diamonds
There's a price to pay for that, and a gun that's gonna shoot you right
You thought you had a chance but nobody cares and nobody wants
To see you on that screen they're always gonna shoot right
Down!

And a gun that's gonna shoot you right
Heartbreaker
