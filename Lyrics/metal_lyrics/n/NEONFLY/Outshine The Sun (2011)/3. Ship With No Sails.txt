There's a rumor in the night,
A distant face that memory
Has brought back to my door

I assumed it would fade away
Time didn't kill it after allÂ...

Why do we try to hide from yesterday?
Erase our footsteps in the sand

The gate is open but it's cold and dark
The siren calls from beyond
You pay the price - and you pray for salvation
But all you get is desolation

Hear the sound of the clashing waves and the wailing wind as a new day dawns
All your dreams washed up on the shore are now faded and gone
Always standing on the edge of paradise, but you never took that step
There's a ship waiting on the shore and you cannot find the sail

Seasons wasted wondering why
You were too weak to move on
A silent scream, an empty cry for
Someone to carry you home

The demon tries to take control again
Nightmares appear in your mind
Afraid to fly - like a bird in a cage
No chance to leave this earthly prison

Hear the sound of the clashing waves and the wailing wind as a new day dawns
All your dreams washed up on the shore are now faded and gone
Always standing on the edge of paradise, but you never took that step
There's a ship waiting on the shore and you cannot find the sail

There's a newborn star that lights your way in the dark
You have to reach out and take it.
All the poison you drank will be drained from your heart
Come and dance with the minstrel - Leave your fears behind
The vision's fading,
The winds are blowing,
But no one answers the call

You always tried to hide from yesterday
Remove the traces of your past

Hear the sound of the clashing waves and the wailing wind as a new day dawns
All your dreams washed up on the shore are now faded and gone
Always standing on the edge of paradise, but you never took that step
There's a ship waiting on the shore and you cannot find the sail
