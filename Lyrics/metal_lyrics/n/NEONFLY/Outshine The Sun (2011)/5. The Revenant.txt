I heard the sound of the closing door
Woke up to find no one was besides me
Morning had come and caught me unaware
The devil never gives signs of warning
Is tis the price I have to pay?
For all the beauty my heart plunders

If you set my soul on fire, who will put it out when youâre gone?
The fires of hell surround me; saints and sinners wait for your call

I canât remember, I canât recall,
The steps I took on the road I travelled
I fell asleep on a quiet summer day
I lost my way in the heart of darkness
And still I find it hard to tell
The devilâs music plays, I wonderâ¦

If you set my soul on fire, who will put it out when youâre gone?
The fires of hell surround me; saints and sinners wait for your call

There, where my memoryâs laid to rest
And the serpents crawl and kiss
Underneath the marble weights
Where my heart still beats Iâmâ¦

â¦ Turning Iâm twisting, revolving, retrieving,
When the hour strikes again
Iâll be reborn

If you set my soul on fire, who will put it out when youâre gone?
The fires of hell surround me; saints and sinners wait for your call

If you set my soul on fire, who will put it out when youâre gone?
The fires of hell surround me; saints and sinners wait for your call
