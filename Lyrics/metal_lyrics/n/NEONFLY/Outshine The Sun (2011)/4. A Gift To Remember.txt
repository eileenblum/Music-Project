Once I had a gift to remember
Warm and glowing shard like the ember
Of a fire that wonât expire

Sealed away and frozen in time
Like the love we tried to consign
In jealous hearts, torn and ripped apart

In your eyes a million stars arise but the clouds wonât let them shine
If we could have braved the stormy nights Iâd have held on to your heart, so dearly

Fiery hearts about to conspire
Set ablaze and cause a misfire
Getting close to the final sacrifice

Creeping like a silent assailant
Growing stronger thirsty for vengeance
Running blind lost between the lines

In your eyes a million stars arise but the clouds wonât let them shine
If we could have braved the stormy nights Iâd have held on to your heart, so dearly

You choose your path but then you lost your way
You found yourself again in darkness tears and despair
Pale figures linger at the break of day

In your eyes a million stars ariseâ¦

In your eyes a million stars arise but the clouds wonât let them shine
If we could have braved the stormy nights Iâd have held on to your heart, so dearly

In your eyes a million stars arise but the clouds wonât let them shine
If we could have braved the stormy nights Iâd have held on to your heart, so dearly
