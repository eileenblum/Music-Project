Your empty eyes are looking my way
I know you've tried it many times before
A broken glass is all you need
You see the white light and the open door

A world of lies and shattered dreams
Has tossed you in the gutter
You try to fly with broken wings
But you keep on falling

Rise above the ashes
Don't be afraid
To stand and face the masses

A one-eyed prophet
To lead the blind
To kill the outcast
Stand up and fight

Stand up and fight!
Stand up and fight!

You live in fear and segregation
All fingers point at you and you don't want
To play their game and have your share
You have the power to resist the floods

The fools are gathering again
Fighting for the spotlight
Turn your back and walk away
Now!

Rise above the ashes
Don't be afraid
To stand and face the masses

A one-eyed prophet
To lead the blind
To kill the outcast
Stand up and fight

A world of lies and shattered dreams
Has tossed you in the gutter
You try to fly with broken wings
But you keep on falling

The fools are gathering again
Fighting for the spotlight
Turn your back and walk away
Now!

Rise above the ashes
Don't be afraid
To stand and face the masses

A one-eyed prophet
To lead the blind
To kill the outcast
Stand up and fight

Rise above the ashes
Don't be afraid
To stand and face the masses

A one-eyed prophet
To lead the blind
To kill the outcast
Stand up and fight

Stand up and fight!
Stand up and fight!
Run Free, run free, yeah!
