You sit upon a throne but built so high
You gaze at all of us with spite
You pass your sins for everyone to bear
With hearts so rueful and contrite

We call upon grace and might but all you do is crush our dreams and erase them

Hiding away behind your disguise
You pave your way bigoted lies

You try to kick us while weâre down
The word has got around thet in this town
Youâre the enemy

The enemy, youâre the enemy
The enemy

Standing face to face
You make the blood boil in my veins

Now time has come for all to see
What weâve become weâre proud and free
We refuse to live in misery

Iâm sick and tired of all plans and schemes
The way you pass your judgments as you please
Like fools you try to lead us by the nose
Fill our minds with thoughts we never chose

But weâll no longer heed your cry
Your days are over now âcause to me
Youâre just the enemy

The enemy, youâre the enemy
The enemy
