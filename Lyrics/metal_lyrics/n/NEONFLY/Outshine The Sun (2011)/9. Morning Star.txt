The skies are bright with lightning
Confusion strikes the plain
The coming dawn is frightening
The choice is yours to make

Follow me, follow me blindly
The trick is not to see
Iâll never let, you slip through my fingers
Iâll never set you free

I climbed the highest mountain
I called upon the Lord
I towered above the masses
Pride comes before The Fall

Follow me, follow me blindly
The trick is not to see
Iâll never let, you slip through my fingers
Iâll never set you free

Architect of, all your misfortunes
War in heaven, no peace in hell
I will make you drink of the poison
I will lay waste, pollute your world

I dreamt tonight of my soul taking flight on the shining wings of freedom
I dreamt tonight that I lived in the light of a raging Morning Star
I dreamt tonight of no wrong and no right just a burning will for freedom
I dreamt tonight that my heart would ignite like a raging Morning Star

I am the great deceiver
The one who wonât bow down
My light will last forever
Until the coming dawn

Follow me, follow me blindly
The trick is not to see
Iâll never let, you slip through my fingers
Iâll never set you free

I dreamt tonight of my soul taking flight on the shining wings of freedom
I dreamt tonight that I lived in the light of a raging Morning Star
I dreamt tonight of no wrong and no right just a burning will for freedom
I dreamt tonight that my heart would ignite like a raging Morning Star

I dreamt tonight of my soul taking flight on the shining wings of freedom
I dreamt tonight that I lived in the light of a raging Morning Star
I dreamt tonight of no wrong and no right just a burning will for freedom
I dreamt tonight that my heart would ignite like a raging Morning Star
