Wipe the dust away, from a box of levity
Stirs a memory, a lifetimes breadth away
Too scarred to close my eyes, the past floods in like tears
One more wordless cry fills the empty night

No bleeding heart could ever stand in my way
When, I played upon the foothills of depravity
No hearts and no minds were in my gift to bestow
I Canât believe in life when deathâs the only real God I know

They said, the truth will set you free,
They said, no harm would come to meâ¦

The ends of sanity, drowning in profanities
The cost of savagery. A slate that wonât wipe clean
No guide to light my way into unknown places
Silent partners stare, but thereâs nothing left to sayâ¦

I was the messenger, the means to an end
Unleashed, to crush belief in far and broken lands
No conscience, no reason, no map and no plan
Destroyed the lives of those who never stood a chance

They said, the truth will set you free,
They said, no harm would come to meâ¦

No bleeding heart could ever stand in my way
As I play upon the foothills of depravity
No hearts and no minds were in my gift to bestow
I Canât believe in life when deathâs the only real God I know

They said, the truth will set you free,
They said, no harm would come to meâ¦
