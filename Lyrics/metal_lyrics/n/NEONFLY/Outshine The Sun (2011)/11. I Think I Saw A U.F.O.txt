What's that thing above the clouds
Making circles with its tail
I know I haven't seen that thing before

Could it be they're finally here?
Have they been waiting all these years?
And could that thing be called a UFO?

I know they're green I know they're fast
I know that Elvis is alive
They took him more than 20 years ago

And maybe they're outside your door
Alien footsteps on the floor
You know you're never coming back no more

Unidentified flying object in the sky
I'm not out of my mind

I think I saw a U.F.O.
I think I saw a U.F.O.
I think I saw a U.F.O.
I think I saw a U.F.O.
