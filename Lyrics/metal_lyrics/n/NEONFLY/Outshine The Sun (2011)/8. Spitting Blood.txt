Treason rides again as a rumor rides from within
Running dogs of hate, sow seeds of disorder
Whispers on the street as the shadows stalk the city squares
Cold and pale like the sun on a winter morning

Running and hiding from the endless night
Timeâs running out on your life
When it comes to the kill theyâll look you straight in the eye
When your numberâs up donât ask me why
When your numberâs up donât ask me why

Marching to the beat of the drums of dissidence and fear
Steps so turbulent they make mountains crumble
A single shot rings out and the balance falters from within
When thereâs hunger for blood, it will all spill over

Running and hiding from the endless night
Timeâs running out on your life
When it comes to the kill theyâll look you straight in the eye
When your numberâs up donât ask me why
When your numberâs up donât ask me why

When your freedom burns in silence and the final curtain calls
When all oaths are made in violence and the final heads have rolled
When the saving hand of liberty has turned away from you
When theyâve finally taken over, they will feast on flesh and spit the bones

Running and hiding from the endless night
Timeâs running out on your life
When it comes to the kill theyâll look you straight in the eye
When your numberâs up donât ask me why
When your numberâs up donât ask me why

Kill in the womb before it sees the light
The Promise is left unfulfilled
Cause Iâm running and hiding with a gun by my side
Spitting blood and sleeping when I die
Spitting blood and sleeping when I die
