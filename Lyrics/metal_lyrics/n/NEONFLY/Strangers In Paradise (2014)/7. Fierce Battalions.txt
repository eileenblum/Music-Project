Take me to the place
Where the fires are burning
Ere you stood your ground,
Now your fates are turning

We make our enemies cower
A hungry lion that feasts on blood of men
We crush your pride and your power -
Taunting the heavens,
Your destined end awaits

Fall with all our might upon the thickest of the fight

Don't run in fear now
Come try my spear now
I'll leave your flesh and your bones
For the vultures, yeah
With dark wings coming
To devour their pray

My thundering cry brings men to their knees
Like furious storms that lash at the seas

Take me to the place
Where the fires are burning...

Take me to the place
Where the fires are burning
Ere you stood your ground,
Now your fates are turning

Our ranks are braking battalions
Furious onset that withers lives of men
Don't turn your back like a coward
The earth shall drink all the blood you spill today

Through the sun-starved night,
Until the morrow brings the light
Saffron-clad at dawn; Aurora.

Lying dead for all your sorrows
Shattered shield and bones

Fire, fire, fire, fire!

Fire on your high walls
Burning down your towers
Ravaging your white halls
Offerings to Ares

Raven of destruction
Perched up on your towers
Taming down your war lust
Slay or be slain
Only death shall remain!
