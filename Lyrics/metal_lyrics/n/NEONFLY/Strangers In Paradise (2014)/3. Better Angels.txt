Dawning spring when vows were spoken
Summer flames are not meant to last that long
When daylight fades away,
Make your mind up leave or stay
The door's tow open

Autumn paints the skies of twilight
Winter nights hide everything under snow
Receding in the cold,
Dreams that can be bought or sold
With faithless tokens

And when the sun goes down
I still hear you call my name
Among these shattered bonds
It's too late to make amends
You forsake your better angels on the battlefield
Only broken hearts are real

Cloaked in mist you hide your daggers
Passed the hours from morning 'til midnight tolled
Whilst faithful by my post,
I can hear the mournful ghosts
Of swains departed

Can we bridge the distance between us,
If you spend your nights on the run?
By the river wraith-like whispers make me shiver
When you trample logic and reason,
Treason can be seen from afar
Monster, sneerer, creeping, crawling, coming nearer

And when the sun goes down
I still hear you call my name
Among these shattered bonds
It's too late to make amends
You forsake your better angels on the battlefield
Only broken hearts are real

Angels on the battlefield
Only broken hearts are real...

I turn my head and see you slipping away

And when the sun goes down
I still hear you call my name
Among these shattered bonds
It's too late to make amends
You forsake your better angels on the battlefield
Only broken hearts are real

I'll pay the ferryman so you cross the Acheron,
You call my name; echoes of the past still remain
You forsake your better angels on the battlefield
Only broken hearts are real
