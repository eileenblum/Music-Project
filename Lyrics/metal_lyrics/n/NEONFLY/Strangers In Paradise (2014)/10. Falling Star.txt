Like a light, that fades
Receding down a highway
Like the last flicker in an old man's eyes
It's the cold touch
Of winter on your shoulder
You've gone too far

From the start

When the sunset
Broke your heart into a diamond
And to sleep meant a dream of endless skies
In the white heat
Of pride that drove you further
You ride on through
Midnight will find you

Sending out a signal
It's on the air tonight
A scream becomes a whisper
You're welcoming the night
Close the door behind you
You're never looking back

'Cause you're far away like a falling star baby
Far away, but you're burning in my heart

Steal a breath, take a care
'Cause the men don't like a drifter
They wanna close your eyes
And shut your dream time down
Every map has an end
That hides a new horizon
You saw that too
You went the distance

Sending out a signal
It's on the air tonight
A scream becomes a whisper
You're welcoming the night
Close the door behind you
You're never looking back

For so long
You left your sorrows behind you
For so long
You wove your secrets around you
You're gone
You left when I found you
Far away like a falling star baby
Far away like a falling star baby

Sending out a signal
It's on the air tonight
A scream becomes a whisper
You're welcoming the night
Close the door behind you
You're never looking back

'Cause you're far away like a falling star baby
Far away but you're burning bright
Far away like a falling star baby
Far away but you're burning in my heart

Don't ever look behind you,
You're flying free
You're never looking back...
