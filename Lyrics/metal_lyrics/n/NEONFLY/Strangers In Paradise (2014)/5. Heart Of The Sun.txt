Come sell your soul
Chase the crested wave
Brave the siren's call

Beyond all control
With no kings and no crosses
Atrocities out of sight
Sail at first light

Stand and fight
Rip through the night
Come and join me
You won't believe your eyes

Princes of freedom
Blaze into oblivion
Eyes gleaming
The sons of perdition
Killed the dream of Eden
Stained crimson
They'll never stop me now
We're the wrath of God

So come take my hand
As we trample down these virgin sands

Cursed to a man
God will drown in this jungle
Away from the promised land
High command

Treasure bleeds from the heart of the sun
We will win, we are strong, we're young Arcadians
They will greet us as gods, yeah

Seven seas couldn't keep us away
Victory by the break of the day
We'll save our souls
And burn them at the stake

Princes of freedom
Blaze into oblivion
Eyes gleaming
The sons of perdition
Killed the dream of Eden
Stained crimson
They'll never stop me now
We're the wrath of God

Please don't treat me like a renegade
Don't put out my eyes
Don't take the sun away
As I take my first steps
Over the edge of the world
I tell you

My name is written in eternity
This isn't the last you're gonna see of me
I don't want no last chance
Bring it on, I'll advance and taste my freedom
Freedom!

Princes of freedom
Blaze into oblivion
Eyes gleaming
The sons of perdition
Killed the dream of Eden
Stained crimson
They'll never stop me now
We're the wrath of God
