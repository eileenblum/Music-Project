No one looks twice at the runt of the litter
An evil cradling, a saviour embittered

The dark is stealing the light
Fear let you in but your secret's not for sale
Madman chasing the night
Dead souls give birth to a world beyond the pale

The fools entrusted the keys to the kingdom
Blind men who planted the seeds of destruction

Standing alone and you're caught in my dream
Sleeping at night and I can't hear you scream
Sacrifice you and I'd sacrifice me
You're a drop in the ocean of my vanity

You scarred us all
But then you rose without a trace

The dark is stealing the light
Fear let you in but your secret's not for sale
Madman chasing the night
Dead souls give birth to a world beyond the pale

You had it planned
Planned from the start
You took a chance
And burnt your heart away
A million men
Just couldn't stop
The chosen one
Who lives to be obeyed

Another lie
Deceives the eye
But two wrongs can't make a right
A blackened heart
Too late to hide
The loneliness inside...

And if you want it
I know you're gonna take it
Ride the road to ruin
Greed is your salvation
Stop it!

Are words you can't conceive of
Ends defy the means
We're marching to damnation
Suffer!

The ones that you ignored
The ones without a hope
The child without a future
Nothing!
Can satisfy the hunger
That destroys the peace for paranoia

In faraway places, hidden from sight
A burning ambition snuffs out a life

A smiling face masks the stench of corruption
A rejects dream brings a world to extinction

Standing alone and you're caught in my dream
Sleeping at night and I can't hear you scream
Sacrifice you and I'd sacrifice me
You're a drop in the ocean of my vanity

The dark is stealing the light
Fear let you in but your secret's not for sale
Madman chasing the night
Dead souls give birth to a world beyond the pale
