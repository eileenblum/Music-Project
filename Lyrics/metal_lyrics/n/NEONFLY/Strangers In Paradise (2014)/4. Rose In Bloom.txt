Ooh baby don't you cry
I know you're lying
Ooh I can see it in your eyes
Though you keep on denying
Did you really think that I would be the one
That waits by your door
My heart's back on the road
Our memories will...

Fade away
Just drift away
Until they're sealed in time
And locked from view
A fragment of both me and you
You keep on banging on the wall
You're not getting through

Ooh pictures on a wall
Of sunshine embraces
Ooh 'cause you thought you had it all
Now it's all lost and wasted
No one hears you when you cry
Alone at night
You're down on your own
The dawn's a lonely friend
And loneliness won't...

Fade away
Drift away
Until it's sealed in time
And locked from view
A whisper of both me and you
You keep on banging on the wall
You're not getting through
Can't fight this emptiness
Broken in two
Don't throw your heart in vain
Baby...

Once our love was like a rose in bloom
Rose in bloom
Now it's lust a lost horizon
Pale like a winter moon
And all the dead flowers
That adorn your room
Broken dreams and lost horizons
I'm telling you

Once our love was like a rose in bloom
Rose in bloom
Now it's lust a lost horizon
Pale like a winter moon
And all the dead flowers
That adorn your room
Broken dreams and lost horizons
I'm telling you

Lovers fade away like shadows
They turn into fleeting shadows of the past

Ooh pictures on a wall...
