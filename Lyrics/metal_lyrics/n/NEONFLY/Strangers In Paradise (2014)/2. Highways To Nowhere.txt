New flesh arise, so synchronised
Their bodies spasm to the score
Evangelise their weakened minds
I leave them hungry for more...

I medicate, obliterate
And leave you drowning in my wake
Your last mistake, you can't escape
My stranglehold on you

Wasted dreams
Stigmata burning me
Bleeding hearts just don't beat
The madness
Screaming with laughter
On highways to nowhere

Desensitised and ostracised
The hunted stalking the hunter
I paralyse, I neutralise
You'll wear a new mark of Cain

Eradicate the human trait
That separates the simian
I'll desecrate, eliminate
The good that's left in you

Wasted dreams
Stigmata burning me
Bleeding hearts just don't beat
The madness
Screaming with laughter
On highways to nowhere

Young and free
The crowd is your natural enemy
So keen to stamp your identity
An individual heresy
You're nothing out of the ordinary
Just like me....

No strength survives this genocide
Of mind and muscle in decay
Self satisfied and pacified
You watch your life slip away

You mutilate, self flagellate
A standard bearer for the plague
A life undone, somebody's son
Blue-black insanity

Wasted dreams
Stigmata burning me
Bleeding hearts just don't beat
The madness
Screaming with laughter
On highways to nowhere
