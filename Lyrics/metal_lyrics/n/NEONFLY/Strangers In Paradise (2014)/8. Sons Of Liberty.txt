Silence can't save skin and bone
Face down the diamonds of crushed glass on stone
Sound the warning, hear the marching feet
Running out of the shadows, they're back on the streets

The endless slaves of tyranny
In flames you'll fall
Give my blood for liberty
For one and all

Chanting of the same old song
Just taunts the memories, of the fallen ones,
And when we meet them on the barricades,
We'll get straight to the point at the edge of a blade

The endless slaves of tyranny
In flames you'll fall
Give my blood for liberty
For one and all

No tears if we fall by the wayside
No tears if we fall on our swords
Every nation gathered around us

Trust our fury

And we'll rise up tomorrow
It's time to cross the line

There's no retreat
We'll take the streets
We'll never stop
Until we beat

The endless slaves of tyranny
In flames you'll fall
Give my blood for liberty
For one and all

Trust our fury
