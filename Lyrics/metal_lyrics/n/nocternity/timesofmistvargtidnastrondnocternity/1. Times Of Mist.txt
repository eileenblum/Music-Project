[performed by Nocternity]Tell me, what burnt - within my chest.
where is it gone - there is no trace.
I searched for it - I lived for it.
I'm empty now - nothing remains - that keeps me alive.

the snowfall of ages that now
covers my hands - and acts...

times of mist - 
ashes of forgotten dreams.
sands of time are running fast.
times of mist - 
meaningless, the worlds fate

are these - the times of mist,
which show me - my path out of these woods?
shall I go - and leave everything?
shall I go - and leave everything?

flames of rage, with fire I built my life
now ashes in my hands.

what fires burnt my chest,
where are they gone now, I'm cold.

flames of rage, with fire I built my life
 - now ashes in my hands.
in my hands.

are these the times of mist,
which show me my path?

flames of rage, with fire I built my life
 - now ashes in my hands.
are these the times of mist?
Ashes ...
