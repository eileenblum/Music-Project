"Not by rancour does one kill but by laughter."
Nietzsche's Zarathustra

Murder is not a crime as taught:
The only crime is to get caught.
Murder ought to be planned and thought
From every angle.

Sin? The sin is to be meek.
Cowards turn the other cheek!
One can't afford to be weak
Here in this jungle.

For wolves, to slaughter sick sheep
Is an act of citizenship.
It's a moral duty to strip
The vile from their lives.
Eye for sight and tooth for jaw:
My reading of the jungle's law.
Even when it's served cold shall
My vengeance arrive.

Murder is not a crime as thought:
The only crime is to get caught.
Though this days 'tis better to kill
One too many than one too few...
