An aeon passed since her lungs turned to quills
The passing of time had her childish wombs heated
Like the Goddess she praised she began to seem
And she was baptized the queen of the deep

All of the sea creatures bowed and loved her
As she was the chosen of the sea mother
She played with the dolphin and danced with the eel
Hung with the whale, and ridded the seal

Promised to guard her endless domain
To keep this blue land ever the same
Gifted with powers to mortals unknown
And the passing of time would not take its toll

Eternal glory that's promised to her
In ancient underwater ruins she dwells
Atlantean memories forever tied there
Brought down by time and a goddess unfair
