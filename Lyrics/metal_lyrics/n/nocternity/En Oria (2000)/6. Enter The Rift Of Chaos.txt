A water current carries us in haste
With the speed of a maelstrom
Our only light created by the glowing seas
As we advance to the unknown

Know, the abyss is here
Feel the tight grip of fear
As the creature draws near

See, enthralling light glowing
Now, the portal is opening
The stars decide: The rift is complete
One time in a thousand years

To reveal the true force of chaos
A formless thing a blasphemy
A thousand tentacles
With a thousand eyes
All crawling to reach us

My hands have a light grip of my sword
Now, there's no more fear
Just a heightened sense of things

The priestess behind me
With silent spells she calls her queen
Umberlee, the dark mistress of the sea
To aid us against what would undone reality

My magic sword slashing left and right
Chopping tentacles in two
And green blood flows
But it is a matter of time till I'm caught

The eyes spinning, it is painful to look at
As are the lost souls of mortals
Staring in eternal horror and agony

The lord of chaos is trying to make me lose
What remains of my sanity
But I rage and slash and back again
As a tentacle grabs my leg
I feel the pain - but I still fight
I'll teach this thing how mortals fight
And now a mortal bravely dies
Before it holds my soul
At the time my sword arm is caught
And I paralyze, soon to be lost
The waters shake, the spell is complete
