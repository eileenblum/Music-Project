A hundred years before my story did unfold
What I saw in dreams was happening for real
A vessel hits the waves, the journey is in vein
A fate that no one wants to sing

Among the crew she stands so pale
Natassa, thy beloved one
She's to share the fate of all the males

And as days passed by in waters calm
Showing no sign of what's to come
A storm was brewing to the north
The rage of sea come forth

There came storm clouds black
The waters darkened, oh so fast
As instant they were caught
In the middle of a fierce sea storm
All in the ship was shivering
Knowing not what was happening
And only she could really see
And stared in awe the figure near
A woman dressed in jellyfish
With eyes like pearls, and hair like seaweed
Like garments she wore seals
From seashell were her fingernails

The huge form near the ship
Laughs in delight
The girl stands petrified
Meaningless the efforts of all aboard
As she knows the source of the storm
A female voice echoes in the girls mind
Asking her now to dive
Accept the waters cold embrace
To have one last chance to change her fate

In agony the choice is made
The girl is thrown into the waves
To be one with the creatures of the sea
From this moment and eternally
And she did drown but did not die
Choosing to sit by the Goddesses side
Promising to take the pain of loss away
Such strange the games God's play
