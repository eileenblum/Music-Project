Deep down at the midnight of soul
I awakened to find myself all alone
Struggling between the wet sheets
I've been dying in the midpoint of reality - and dream -

My heart it pounds by the vision I've seen
And I truthfully hope it was merely a dream
That the gods ain't showing an omen to me
Holding the key to my destiny

A ship without hope caught by the sea storm
A seaman's curse, nature rears its ugly side
And onto the deck, she's but a girl
Unfair fate, she's to die a nasty death

Torrent of darkness, showering despair
The crackling of thunder, the waves take her under
Below she
Gasps for air

Life soulless dolls, sailors fall to the sea
Their cries over silenced by the bowling winds
They meet a merciless watery doom
Tomorrow I travel; will I end up doomed, too?

In my journeys I've traveled in paths yet unknown
As I am a man, who calls no place home
Even if the end lies so near I know
I won't give in to fear

In the night I go, to pay homage
To the Goddess of the sea, the bitch Queen Umberlee
The shrine has been built there since years
To let a seaman get rid of his fears

There is a need for such a wicked belief
To praise the Queen, to quench all her anger
As anyone who ventures to her domain
Puts his life in her hands
