What loneliness crawled in her heart like a snake
She chose the best man of shipwreck to take
And with a kiss, she never gave the choice that she had
To take her lover below, so sad to know
That when they part he will die

Queen of the deep with a kiss you save
A drowning man from his fate
Queen of the deep with the coldest blood
I know I'll drown when we'll part

Then a day the goddess appeared to her
To assign a task to rid of a curse
In the abyss lies a rift to the worlds
And from the abyss the lord of chaos will come
And the law of land, sea and air
Shall be lost, it must be stopped

Queen of the deep I've seen you in my dreams
I should have never come your way
Queen of the deep now our fates will join
As I ignored the omen

Umberlee has decided
And so my vessels sunk
And all were drowned, but one
The choice of a hero is done
Her eyes shone in her shining face

As she kissed me again in a cold embrace
My last gift was given to me
Making love to the queen of the sea
And as the yarn of my fates unfolds
Now, I know the abyss has a woman's soul

Now that my fate is shown to me
I know I will fight in the deepest abyss
A creature crawling from the outer world
To give time to be the sea-witch to save us all
To complete the spell that will close the rift
And seal it for a thousand years
With this quest in mind we moved
To win or to witness our doom
