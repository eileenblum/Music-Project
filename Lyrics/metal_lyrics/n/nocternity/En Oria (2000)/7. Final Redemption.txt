Finally this battle came to an end
A fight no mortal could hope to win
As I am caught by the cold grip
But yet is there a hope

The deep is trembling
And I even feel a moan from the chaos thing
I look from the corner of my eyes
That the priestess is in her prime

Her hands unleash a shinning pearl
An a water current hurls it
Upon the bloated skin
Of the chaos lord

I feel the thing cursing
As the portal is fading
Forcing it to withdraw
Back to its hateful world

Water swirls all around
In a great mad storm
And all blackens for me
As I loose my consciousness

The demon sinks as we float above
And far away from the abyss
Defeated, doomed to try again
After a thousand years

When I open my eyes
She holds me in her arms
And I still lay floating
Paralyzed from the fight

Her eyes gleam softly
And I know somewhere
Deep inside there's much sadness
She hasn't felt for year

Then she gives me
The choice that she had to follow
But I deny
I know already by the look in her eyes
My life has ended
With a kiss she takes my final breath
She ends the spell, this story I won't live to tell

My last picture; she floats in shining waters
As I sink in welcoming darkness
