Shadowy images come into sight, betokening the arrival of the night
Heed the wind and its tale of woe, summon ghosts forth from below

Ancient darkness, undying grimness, chthonic shrine of the gods

Faces encrusted with blood and grime
Scavenging throughout the obscurity of time

Titans, usurp the throne
A pitch black palace engraved in stone
Titans, emerge victorious
Titans, titans, titans

Through the ruins of Necromanteion, wraithlike deities loom from beyond
Countless years eclipsed in silence, the oracle of death rise to eminence

Ancient darkness, undying grimness, chthonic shrine of the gods

Dead but dreaming in vast antique empires
Ascend in flames of the funeral pyres
Who dwellest in the void place of the squall
