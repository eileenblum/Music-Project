Twilight over vast horizons
Like dead black stone they tower
Archway to the kings of old
Heirs of the shadowed deep

Bring on the night, bring on the pledge
Bring on the night, bring on the dead

While all the courage they devour
Upon unearthly screams they tower
Weeping willows, dead black stone to sire
Archway, swallow whole the plea

Bring on the night, bring on the pledge
Bring on the night, bring on the dead

Bring on the night, bring on the pledge
Bring on the night, bring on the dead

Lock the seven thrones of death
Hold the seven thrones of death
Until she will return
And open The Black Gates
And conquer thy fate
