Shattering the walls of time
Blows of a hammer, old, sublime
No sleep, no respite, desire
Adept of an ancient art, admire

Blackening rain onto eternal flames
Forge in fire, in all the pain
No sleep, no respite, ascension
Titan of a dark dimension

Harps in undertone, weaving oldest might
Pitching spells in sparkling light
Breathing the glare of eternity
At one with the dark, internally

Unutterable strength from the unknown
Pouring all that is thy own
Blows of thy hammer, meld the spell
Forge a just will, on the anvile of hell

The crowned, the titan, the seer
Blacksmith of a dark dimension
