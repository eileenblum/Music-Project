The seeker's eye, tearing and tired
The veil to fall, in truth's denial
A thousand keys, but none to find
A thousand dreams, but none to bind

The seeker's heart, aching, grown old
His dying eyes, bleeding cold
A thousand men, but none with urge
A thousand ghosts, but none to purge

No one ever knows, no one ever told
The veil will fall, when it unfolds
A thousand words, but none to speak
A thousand lives, but none to weep
A thousand blades, but none to wield
A thousand deaths, but none to yield

For you I am what I am
A Blind Opaline Eye Of Death
