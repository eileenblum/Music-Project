A crown of unbegotten stars
Amidst the temple walls
Conjuring what has been gone
Conjuring what is to come

Fading, the keeper of space
Fading, the keeper of time
In the steadily pounding heart

The light of unbegotten stars
Glowing into waning flesh
Closing in the temple walls
Drown in chants, come forth

Void sets the yearning heart alight
Amidst the ever pouring skies
An altered mirror in disguise
Andromeda burning now bright
