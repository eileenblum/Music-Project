Centuries in marshes, infested in the exoskeltons
Lies the elder wyrm, watching and awaiting the moment
A huge form, covered in the blackest scales
With claws like scimitars and fangs like spears
Eyes like two fullmoons
The Onyx Dragon will awake
With a single slide, in dismal waters
Poisoning, and deciding the fate of all
Ancient wisdom of the Ophis
Circular movements of time
And the fate of the world
That was built upon
Two cosmic reptiles
Their cyclic embrace that shields Cosmos
They love and hate each other
As mortals, hate and love themselves
The night that it will abandon, it's slithering domain
Then it will leave liquid Earth
Flying above to the unworldly dome
And with a swing of its feathered tail, and with a hiss
It will make the silver chords, the state of all
And the astral wind that blows
To ever-know its cosmic hate
