"Do you want to wake the Dragon?"
Fear cuts deeper than swords!
But full of heart, and breath of hope
We trek landscapes, and sail to all shores
On a game of thrones

Khalakka Dothrae mr'anha
Rakh! Rakh haz!
Fire and blood
Blood of the Dragon

"I am the Blood of the Dragon"
She told as she took the stallion's heart
In both hands, lifted it to her mouth
And plunged her teeth, into the tough stringy flesh

Khalakka Dothrae mr'anha
Rakh! Rakh haz!
Khalakka Dothrae mr'anha
Rakh! Rakh haz!
Fire and blood
Blood for the Dragon

The false will wear the burning crown
The iron vicious crown
And death will claim them
But fire,
Fire cannot ever kill a dragon...

Our standards will ever boldly fly
A three headed dragon, red on Black
Our heritage of Silver hair, and indigo eyes
Those who escaped the Doom of Valyria

The Conquerers of the Seven kingdoms!
Awake the Dragon!
