The Spiral Archway of thought
The deeping well of memory
The silver fountain of Inspiration
The brazen vessel of knowledge

Oh, distilled drop by drop
Goldengreen nectar, gathered by yearning petals
Sliced out of the raw surface
Of the Eldest Tree, and root of the Earth

Oh! How we crave to know!
Oh! Countless the skeletons of this tomb!

Sacrificed, in olitude, lives
As candles that slowly meld into Darkness
Is Truth hidden there?
Is this a part of the Masterplan?

Ask thy shadow, to slowly crawl
Entangle your head
In its long fingernails

And the chill of the grave
To lean over, to your ear
And whisper to you a single truth

Awake!
...all but in vain
Kept in captivity lie their children
By liars of old
Deceivers and enemies of man

In Vain?
It's our turn now...
Do we lay silent?
Or, choose to know

Awake! Ask thy shadow!
Awake! Choose to know!
