A monarchy of solitude
A king on the Jade Throne
Submitting his will
To a call from within

Orb of truth
Crown of deceit
To take his place

The throne room, becomes a prison
Jewels lose their gleam,
Our silver swords scorned
As time has finally caught up
An amber doom, embodied
In an emerald reign

Now, faces summoning eternal song of Doom
Answer the dreaming one - called by entropy

The serpent prince has granted all his wishes
And now the vessel of time,
Long awaited has arrived...

Cursing in despair
Knowing within
The stars are eyes
Of the endless cold skies
They all reach upon us

Ashen arkanae
These liquid neon spheres
The stars are descending
This memory was true.

...Tonight we die our deaths,
A human never has,
For a thousand years...
