From so far away,
Comes a storm
From within

These distant shores
Grey, silver and cold
We call home

Embedded in shadows
Displacing illusions
The thunder's purest truth

The bite of the wolf
Clinging to the chain
Touching the wind
Calling of the waves

Caught in a land full of noises
Still I can hear only silence
Wouldn't even dare to reveal
The deepest of secrets

Nevertheless,
Embracing emptiness
A meaning crystal clear
Withdrawing shade of fear

This journey you'll set upon
All you know, are now forlorn
All that you knew, must be left behind
To wander, to seek and to find

To Wander, to Seek and to Find...
