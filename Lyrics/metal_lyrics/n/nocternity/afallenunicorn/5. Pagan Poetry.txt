[BjÃ¶rk cover]

Pedalling through
The dark currents
I find
An accurate copy
A blueprint
Of the pleasure, in me

Swirling black lilies totally ripe
A secret code carved
Swirling black lilies totally ripe
A secret code carved

He offers, A handshake
Crooked, five fingers
They form a pattern
Yet to be matched

On the surface simplicity
But the darkest pit in me
It's pagan poetry
Pagan poetry

Morsecoding signals
They pulsate and wake me up
From my hibernate

On the surface simplicity
But the darkest pit in me
It's pagan poetry
Pagan poetry

Swirling black lilies totally ripe

This time
I'm gonna keep me to myself
This time
I'm gonna keep me all to myself

And it makes me want to hand myself over
And it makes me want to hand myself over...
