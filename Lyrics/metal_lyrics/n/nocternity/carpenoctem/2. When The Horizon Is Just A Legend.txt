Towards daily duty drowsy I go
Even before the sun to his own attends
When cold winds blow and whistle with sorrow
The very last moments before night ends.

With only the moon to witness my doom
Bound to come soon in this night of Autumn

Litten by scarce streetlights, with their shy glow
That dares not shed its beam too far, the land
Lies covered by such thick fog one now vows
That the horizon is but a legend.

With only the moon to witness my doom
Bound to come soon in this night of Autumn

In these moments before the fog dispels
When the sky blurs and dyes all blue at dawn
Building a bridge between worlds parallel
And we breathe deep the clouds, which are still down
My body follows to the sunny hell
Yet in spirit, in this magic I drown

While routine shall keep my now empty shell
With the mists my soul shall forever dwell...
