I have two dear fathers
One has given me life
The gift of another one
Is the deathless fame
The life of my second father
Is cheerful and marry
Each day he has a fight
Each day a feast

I have two dear fathers
One has given me life
The gift of another one
Is the deathless fame
Father? please don't be sad
That we won't meet no more
Filled by the secret honour
Is name of yours among us.
