Hail, dragons of the sea!
That sprouted by s dread
Wood of spears, covered by fame
Not once you tore vermin meat

Enought for you in foreign lands
To wander behind alien table to
Sit strange song to listen
You come back home

You see at home bread
Is tasty and feet by ground
Easy go, where the glory yours
For hundred leagues files before you

In battle are invincible
Not one dissected wolves belly
Each step yours here legend
Each feat yours here song.
