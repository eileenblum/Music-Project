The ice chains will be broken by the first coming rill
And sleeply mighty hands will feel free again
Refreshing vital juices will run thru young veins
Drive out the drunkeness and waking the life up

You hear the voices ofthe ancestors around
When the mountain top is red-stained by the dawn
And a ship isrolled on surges from impstiens
Just when your palm touch the hilt of a sword

Be ready for the trials new life is coming on
You'll hear the greatest voices
To take the place beside
They call you. In the kingdom
Where forever brave man live!
