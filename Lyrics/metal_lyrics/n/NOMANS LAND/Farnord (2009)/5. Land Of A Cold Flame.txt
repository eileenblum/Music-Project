Land of a cold flame
Kingdom of the North
Your breath is like ice storm
Land of a cold flame
Kingdom of winds
You are shining like a white star

The lightnings sparkle on the edge of Odin's spear
Hammer of Thor burns bright flame
No one can prevent the Giant from winning
In kingdom of the North

Hammer on a neck is like hammer of Thor
Warms your life in white emptiness
Cold eyes of Thurs penetrate through
Not giving forces to raise your axe

When breathe freezes in your chest
When your heart turns to a stone
And your blood can't flow anymore
Behind the phantom wall of mist
