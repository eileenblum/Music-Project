Breathe of ancient Gods
Among silent rocks
The cold wind sings
Time has frozen in ice

Doom grey sky hangs
Above a striped sail
Among fjords and mountains
The red sun will rise

Lightnings...
Lightnings strike ribs of rocks
Shield...
The shield sings under deadly blows
Fighting axe...
The fighting axe dissects life
Sail...
Sail with bloody-red stripes

Hard as a stone
Will save the warrior from wounds
The sea  bear holds before itself
Shield of Northern fjords

Arrows are broken and swords are blunted
The shield sings under deadly blows
The victorious song flies over the sea
People and Gods will hear
The song of the Northern fjords
