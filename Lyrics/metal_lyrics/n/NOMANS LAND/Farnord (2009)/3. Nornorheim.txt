Sol swept past along the scope of sky
And gloomy warrior marched into his land

Heavenly dome the trees is bent to the ground
Thor is thundering through the dark of deepest night
Soon the World of people will host the only one
The only one who is coming the whole mankind

And the waves are fondling stones
Sea sparkles as bright fire
Falling on dark lifeless coast
Drawing runes on the ground

Sol swept past along the scope of sky
Wolves raised their howl in the ring of light
And the waves are fondling stones
Sea sparkles as bright fire
Falling on dark lifeless coast
Drawing runes on the ground

The shroud of night has covered forest
Which is watching all the world
The white Moon's wisdom like the eye of Odin
Will guide the warriors to fearless fight
