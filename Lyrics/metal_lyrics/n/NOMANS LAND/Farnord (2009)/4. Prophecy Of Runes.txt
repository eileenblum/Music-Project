Awaiting victory and defeat
Like wild wolf waits for its prey
And glory will never die
Saving the world from damnation

Aces are in need of powerful soul
Norns are spinning his doom
Born, and glory power will shine
Far foreseen by the runes

Awaiting victory and defeat
Being strong like sea wolves flight
And glory will never die
Wolf's roar hushes the clang of swords

All they see is clear
Clear vision of fierceful fights
All they know is future
The clean mirror of the coming end

Awaiting victory and defeat
Like wild wolf waits for its prey
And glory will never die
Saving the world from damnation

Aces are in need of powerful soul
Norns are spinning his doom
Born, and glory power will shine
Far foreseen by the runes
