Steel water flows round the World
As time flows from the beginning of time
But nothing can change all those nine worlds
Oars strongly scratched by the swords

Among high rocks and ice
In the heart of ancient winds
Spear pierced old grey-haired man
Wisdom of winds has hidden in skies

Among high rocks and silvery ice
In the heart of ancient winds empire
Spear pierced old grey-haired man
Wisdom of winds has hidden in skies

Blood and the time boil in your eyes
In your heart is storm of steel
Northern winds whisper to you
About furious battles and clang of steel

Scream of swords it's a clang of swords
Sing a song on the battlefield
Storm of steel is in your heart
Your soul is burnt by burning flame

Steel water flows round the World
As time flows from the beginning of time
But nothing can change all those nine worlds
Oars strongly scratched by the swords

Storm of steel is in your heart
Your soul is burnt by burning flame
Clang of swords at shields break off the night
Noise of the sea sings about fights
