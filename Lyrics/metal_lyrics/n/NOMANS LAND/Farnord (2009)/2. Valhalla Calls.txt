Bright light as an arrow steel
Shining a way to the hall of Vikings
Will lead you over the tops of trees
Nearer to the doors of the sky

Odin!
We are screaming when we fight
Accept our victory as a gift
Odin!
Your daughters fly
Taking warriors away to the feast

Wolves howl and ravens croak
Welcome you before the gate
Day by day you lift a cup
To hear again a clang of iron fight

When the Valhalla calls
Raise your sword to Valkyrie flight
At the feast of swords and arrows
Hey!
