Frost enslows your blood
Can you hear the whisper of the sea?
Will you sing the song for Northern wind?
Is the wolf singing stroking your ears?

The song of North is burning
And burning is the flame in your heart
Like the colour of your blood
The sunset is reflected in the face of Father North

I see your face in every rock in snow
I feel your breathe in the Northern wind
Your sons perform the feats
For them I lift the horn
Your sons become the heroes in the name of you

The flame is flying to black sky
And touches coldness of the stars
The whisper of the sea and dragon flight
Remind you of forerunning fights

The flame is flying to black sky
And brushes coldness of the stars
The whisper of the sea and dragon flight
Remind you of forerunning fights

And we will lift the horns
And we sill sing with Northern wind
In hold of our destiny Norns are
We live the life for Father North
