Battle with the wolf is nigh its next of kin,
Earth Belt will arise from water baring its fangs
He who begins the play of the swords
Will cast his gaze at the sunrise
Earth will come back from the sea
The radiant one will return to the chambers of Gods
He will never forget the deeds of courageous men,
Who gave their lives for the glorious days

The sacred abode of the one eye God
Is full of courageous men,
A coward will never find glory or his way
To the revel within radiant walls
