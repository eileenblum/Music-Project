Moon path lays before you in your dreams
Armour is too heavy on your shoulders
Standing on Drakkar gazing across the seas
Touching your sword, and recall

How you waded
Into the Northern Sea
Thor did help you to guide
The seastead without fear.

You never know how the tangle
Of Nornirs will unfurl
It may lay quietly, or issue coils
Smoke coils upon the sea
