Odin's birds like wolves in battle
They spread their black wings,
Like swords, like oars,
In the water of Njord

Open your eyes, and behold the radiant rays,
That Sol is sending along.
Open your eyes, behold the maidens battle.
Smile for glory
And victories lie ahead.

Odin's birds like wolves in battle
They spread their black wings,
Like swords, like oars,
In the water of Njord

Sailing where the triumph of victory
Is overwhelming,
Where lust for battle possesses you,
Quench its hunger, your battle snake
