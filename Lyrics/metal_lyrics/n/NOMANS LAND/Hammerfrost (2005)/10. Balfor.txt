White blade falls upon coils of steel
Flickering as it flies
Mighty warrior is dead, who put the Ting
Of swords together
In search of glory he travelled far
His battle snake knew no defeat
No defeat or tiredness
Under the storm of spears

The hordes are silent
Harking to the skald's song
He wrote for him, who let the play of swords begin
The hordes are silent
Harking to the skald's song
He wrote for him, who let the play of swords begin

Warrior is joyful at the Aesir's feast
Odin's call for the battle waits
The Balder of the warrior - Viking, he is
The giver of white rings
In search of glory he travelled far
His battle snake knew no defeat
No defeat or tiredness
Under the storm of spears
