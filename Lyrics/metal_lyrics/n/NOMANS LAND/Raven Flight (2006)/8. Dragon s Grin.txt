Dog of war was howling
When Drakkar left the shore
And bloody steel snake
Pierced into the warrior breast

See dragonâs grin
Is reflected in the battle shield
And bleeding maple ting
Brings the victory dedicated to Aces
He fell on the ground
He drew his last breath
And sound of swords
Screaming for him

See dragonâs grin
Is reflected in battle shield
And sound of swords
Screaming for bold warrior
