Dispersed a mist
Strike on the ring of steel
Burning flame from
Darkness heaven
Will fall on the frozen earth
Warmed blood of giants

And last Battle of Gods
To more heaven and earth
And Ermungand will rise
From black sea

Thunderbolt of Mjolnir
Flash for the last time
As if wailing of the wind
Cur begins to howl!

Flash on the hammer
Is the power of the North
Flash on the lightning
Is a pattern of Thor
Flash on the hammer
Is power of north
