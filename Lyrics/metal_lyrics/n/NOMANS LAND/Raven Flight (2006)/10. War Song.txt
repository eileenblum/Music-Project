Swords entrusting
In battle mighty
The boldness is better
On ting of armours

Northern wind carries
Pain and death
Cold and horror
Initiate a deal

Song of war is a voice of glory
No one will ever stop it
Warrior of a Northern wind
Song of war is your depth

Warrior of a Northern wind
Your scream is a voice of glory
Warrior of a Northern wind
Your sword and hands are gory

No one can stop great Northern wind
Who brings pain and death
Horror and cold go over the lands
Wolf screams the song of war!
