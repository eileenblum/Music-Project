Summer sunset lighted a way
To the konungs dragon
The scald was going to meet him
He was the bringer the mead

Sagas he told next summer
Thunder of steel went on
But when the sadness came
Turned to the silence song

He cane to ask for favor

The master of Dragon Sea
Mountains waves filled
With white foam the jaws of the wolf

Lord of shield has fallen in sorrow
Brave song was again beginning
Saga remained a noble konung
Which man for him was singing
