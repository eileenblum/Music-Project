Smashing ice and flame
You walk through your pain
And hissing of iron snakes
Moon coldness will reflect on your face
Youâll hear the noble words
Which steel is speaking for you
They lead you to the chambers of Gods
Drakkar is singing for you

Hail Normann!
Now you may pass through Valhallaâs gates
Hail Normann!
And Aces will greet you with their reward hails!

The dragonhead
And sea waves rage
Will show you the way
And youâll behold
Two flying arrows
Which bring you
To your victory!
