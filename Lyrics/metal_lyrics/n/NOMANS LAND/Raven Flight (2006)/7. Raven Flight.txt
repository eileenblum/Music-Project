The eye of black will mirror the sea
The wing will write runes in the sky
The saga about the warrior who gave
A drink of his blood to Drakkar

Grimâs bird! Can you see
Warrior lies on the shield
Grimâs bird! Can you hear
A sea dragonâs cry for the killed

One flap of the wing â and the black arrow
Is leading the ship again
One flap of the wing â and the cry of the raven
Is waking the one who is slain

The flight of Odinâs bird is writing
Runes in the Northern sky
The flight of the raven sends black arrows
Piercing the stormy night
