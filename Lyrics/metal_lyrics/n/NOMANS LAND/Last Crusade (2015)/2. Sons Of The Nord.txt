Severe Nord taught us
That misery makes you strong
Hunger makes you a hunter
In the sufferings we are all alone

Dark northern sky showed
That life is to perish soon
Take what you can in allotted time
Die free with no sorrow

Our thoughts are grey clouds with the rain
Our will is the edge of the steel
Our anger is breath of the cold
That's why strike with our swords on the spot

Mighty rocks made us
Skillful and unbreakable breed
Many were crushed with our shields
Like waves by the shore

Northern sea made us
Friends with the winds and storms
We appear from nowhere
Suddenly fall like the doom
