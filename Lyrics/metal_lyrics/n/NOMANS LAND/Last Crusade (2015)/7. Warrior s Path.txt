No way to find the glory
At our silent fjord
Your bravery and devotion to Odin
Will show the way to Valhalla gates

From now on, drakkar is only -
Home for the rest of your life
Those, who stay with you shoulder to shoulder -
Your family till you die

Forward! Let waves bring us
From North to unknown east
Many of us will never see
These hills are in the mist

Forward! To serve the battle
Try how strong is your faith
Bring your will - the will of Odin
His glory and victories

We are ravens of Odin
Fly all over the world
In battles and mistery -
Heavens we search
Our axes in blood -
It is will against will
We are victors when we clear
And Gods in us

Forward! Let rivers lead us
From mighty Holmgard to south
We shall bring northerns storms on the edge of swords
Those unlucky, who cross our path

Forward! To serve the battle
Try how strong is your faith
Bring your will - the will of Odin
His glory and victories
