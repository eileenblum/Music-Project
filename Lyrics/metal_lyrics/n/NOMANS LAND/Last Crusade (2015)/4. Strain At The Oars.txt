Hey brothers! Strain at the oars
Let drakkar glide like the vulture soars
Hey brothers! Strain at the oars
The sun of victory rises for us

We are people of fortune, people of will
Our destinies in Odin's hands
We have nothing to lose and nowhere to step back
Throw out the sadness from your heart

If we die or nor - we shall drink our mjod
Let's sing our cheerful songs loud
Our Father is a jolly God
When the arrows fall like a cloud

Hey brothers! Strain at the oars
Let unlucky years stay behind
Hey brothers! Strain at the oars
Today the sun of victory shines
