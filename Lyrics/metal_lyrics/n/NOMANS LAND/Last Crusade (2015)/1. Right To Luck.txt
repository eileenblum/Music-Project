Fire, take my gifts
Smoke, lift it to Asgard height
Father, I decided
To win a fortune or lose the life

By birth, I've got the right
To take what I want from this world
No one can judge me for that
Except the battle outcome

Oh-oh, wind and snow
Be the witness of my oath
Oh-oh, wind and snow
My oath - it is my choice

Father, I surrender
The poor and infamous life
Let my sword and skill prove
That I am worthy of your rewards

Odin, my fate belongs to you
In this fight I will know the truth
I swear to follow the oath till I die
If the age and the disease will not prevent
