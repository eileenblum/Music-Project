[Music: Ramstedt, Sterner]
[Lyrics: Sterner]

Mournful, silent is the night
In white, the nature lies asleep
Whining winds are blowing cold as ice
Frozen is the valley of shadows

Damned to perish
Darkened forever
Merciless annihilation
In ruins it will drown

Wolves are howling through the darkness
As the thundering blizzard returns
Down from the ravines once again
To the empire buried in snow

Hear the cries of the frozen empire
As its beautiness withers away

[Lead: S.R.]
[Lead: M.H.]

See the sparkling winterland forlorn
Its hidden secrets will never be unveiled
Sorrow coloured the horizon
The coming of the eternal dusk

Hear the cries from the frozen empire
As its beautiness withers away
