[Music: Halfdan, Ramstedt, SidegÃ¥rd]
[Lyrics: SidegÃ¥rd]

I strike upon the earth with pain and misery
I will forever be
I've opened up the gates to twist your feeble minds
I'm the cleanser of mankind

You christian cunts
You miserable whores
Your souls will burn
There shall be no remorse
Save your prayers
They are forlorn
I am the bringer of destruction and mourn

It's the dawn of crucifixion
Earth, Air, Water, Fire
All shall walk with me to Armageddon

I come from the sea
I rise and start to seek
I've come to drain the weak
I grow in the earth
I come as storm from the sky
Servants of light shall die

Declare war
Let the feast begin
Come forth you hordes from hell corrupted in sin
One way war
No way back
The flaming chaos breed has come to attack

It's the dawn of Lucifer's rising
Earth, Air, Water, Fire
All shall walk with me to Armageddon

Amaymon! Paymon! Egyn! Oriens!

I am the blackest of hatred
I am merciless salvation

[Lead: S.R.]
[Lead: M.H.]

Eliminate enemies
Leave no survivors
Time has come for the revenge of the primals
Strike with hatred and they'll fall in despair
Turn Mother Earth into a living nightmare

It's the dawn of the age of clavicula
Earth, Air, Water, Fire
All shall walk with me to Armageddon
