[Music: Halfdan]
[Lyrics: Sterner]

Awakened by the call
To haunt and deprive
I've drained myself of life
I've become what you fear

I am the demon
That serves the savage
I'll come for your soul
To please my morbid lust

I am the unhallowed
From time immemorial
I was the one
That raped the soul of Christ

I'm the priest
At your Holy Communion
In God you trust
When you drink the blood of Christ

See my scornful eyes
Which makes you aware
This was your last supper
As I fed you death

I am the unhallowed
From time immemorial
I was the one
That raped the soul of Christ

[Lead: S.R./M.H./S.R./M.H.]

I'm the root of all evil
The nocturnal knight
In the shape of the dark lord
The christians I slay

I'm the tormentor
I ride the black wings
Lost ones, walk with me
I travel in sin

I am the unhallowed
From time immemorial
I was the one
That raped the soul of Christ
