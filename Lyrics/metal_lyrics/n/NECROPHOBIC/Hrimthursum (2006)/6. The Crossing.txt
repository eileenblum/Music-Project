In the spiritrealm, the dark abyss of Hel
In the water cold I swim for the deathlike shore
My blood is frozen and my mind is in a daze
Through the pouring rain I can hear the grumbling dead
So this is it...
I'm crossing the river at last
To live eternally
In the shadows and the glory of the past

Death, death, death is everywhere
Lust, lust, lust is in the air
Step, step, step into the unknown
As the goddess of Hel takes me to her womb

Crossing the river cold...

Listen to the haunting choirs of the dead
They sing their hymns in horror and ghastly dread
They chant in reverence for all bewildered souls
They gather, they call us, they keep us forever

So this is it...
I'm crossing the river at last
To live eternally
In the shadows and the glory of the past

Death, death, take me, I'm incomplete
The life I've left behind feels obsolete
Open up your bosom and let me in
Goddess of Hel, I am yours

Crossing the river cold...
