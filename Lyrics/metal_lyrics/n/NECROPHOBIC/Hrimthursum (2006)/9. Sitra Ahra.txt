Ride with me through hidden flesh tunnels
They're pulsating around us and it is hard to breathe
Our journey is long, we're heading for Golachab
Into rebellion and fire we ride
I cannot see, it's way too dark
I think I can hear them move but the night is stark
Twisted demonic faces revealed around me
I'm trying to interpret and understand what we see

Chaos, Magick, Fire, Death - We call upon thy mighty forces
Chaos, Magick, Fire, Death - We're coming closer Sitra Ahra
Chaos, Magick, Fire, Death - We call upon thy mighty forces
Chaos, Magick, Fire, Death - We're coming, take us Sitra Ahra

Longing for solitude, to sleep with the dreaming dead
In the icecold heart of the totenreich we shall live our lives again

Chaos, Magick, Fire, Death - We call upon thy mighty forces
Chaos, Magick, Fire, Death - We're coming closer Sitra Ahra
Chaos, Magick, Fire, Death - We call upon thy mighty forces
Chaos, Magick, Fire, Death - We're coming, take us Sitra Ahra

I shiver in lust but yet there is pain
The nightside of Eden moves in many ways
Can you feel me inside you? I'm licking your strength
O mighty Satariel show us the treasures

I cannot see, it's way to dark
I think I can hear them move but the night is stark
Twisted demonic faces reveal around me
I'm trying to interpret and understand what we see

Chaos, Magick, Fire, Death - We call upon thy mighty forces
Chaos, Magick, Fire, Death - We're coming closer Sitra Ahra
Chaos, Magick, Fire, Death - We call upon thy mighty forces
Chaos, Magick, Fire, Death - We're coming, take us Sitra Ahra
