Spinning, spinning tiny threads
It's all connecting, the giant cosmic web
Deep in the forest into sleep I fall
Dream in acid I think I see it all
Nightly visions of endless disaster
Horrifying images take form in my twisted head
I see the future, chaos, pain and despair
Consequences impossible to repair

The world is falling, it's falling apart
The earth is trembling in fear of the giants' wrath
So now you are standing with woven hands
Praying to a god that don't exist, tell me how foolish is that

We all are falling, we turn into dust
We are cast into oblivion, into the shadows of the past
Can you sense the nearing? The frozen rise from below
This is the bitter end for man, she is dying, bleeding at heart

Mighty powers from below I am yours
Rise up from the shadows and resurrect my soul
Let me be part of this new darkified world
The age of the giants has returned

Thurisaz, Hagalaz, Thurisaz, Hagalaz

Downward spiral leading to the netherworlds
Layers of darkness, shades of pale
I am the spider in the centre of the web
Forever I'll continue to spin my wily threads

The world is falling, it's falling apart
The earth is trembling in fear of the giants' wrath
So now you are standing with woven hands
Praying to a god that don't exist, tell me how foolish is that

We all are falling, we turn into dust
We are cast into oblivion, into the shadows of the past
Can you sense the nearing? The frozen rise from below
This is the bitter end for man, she is dying, bleeding at heart
