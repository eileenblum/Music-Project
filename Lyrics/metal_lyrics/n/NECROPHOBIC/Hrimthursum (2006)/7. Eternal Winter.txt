Through a frozen eye I watch
A dream of hollow hope
Through a frosted lens
My hatred awakes so cold
He who bares the sky
On his iced shoulders knows
The wind blows cold, merciless old
And nothing awaits above

I am winter, I am death
Frozen still, but not dead
The blind preach visions of divine glory
Of symphonies blessed speak the deaf

My children have betrayed me
And so they will be slain
A new breed in winter will come
As the storm blows wide and far

The sun will never reach the sky
When the eternal winter comes
There will be neither men nor gods
As the world lies under snow and ice

See me falling, I am snow, cover surface from above
See me colour it all white, dazzling endless in deadly bright
Let me spellbind, let me shine, let me enter your narrow mind
I am winter, I am death, I will kill you with my breath

Been here forever
Invisible, silent, wise
Now the world makes a final move
And the wind turns into storm

I watch the mountains turn white
And I celebrate the snow
In the forest deep I cool my wrath
Not dead but sleeping in woe

I am winter, I am death
Frozen still, but not dead
The blind preach visions of divine glory
Of symphonies blessed speak the deaf
