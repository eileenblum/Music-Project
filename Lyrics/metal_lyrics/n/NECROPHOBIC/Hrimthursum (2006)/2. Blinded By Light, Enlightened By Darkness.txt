I...
Was blinded by the light
By luminous spheres
Burning in the sky
I'm...
Enlightend by the dark
By the spirits of the night
Blackened as they rise

Them...
I've always felt them near
Reflected in my eyes
Like shadows they appear

Flesh...
Cancer of the soul
Vamper of the mind
Imprisoning my will

The path...
I've known for centuries
The flesh that clothes my soul
Was never meant to be

Dead...
Look into my eyes
Like mirrors open wide
I'm already there...

...as I walk through the gateway

...To join the dead
...So let it bleed
...I walked undead
...Now I can see

Time...
Through aeons I have walked
The paths of ignorance
Enchanted by the fire

Death...
The blade that cuts me loose
In a cloudburst I leave
Into darkness so cold

I...
Was blinded by the light
By luminous spheres
Burning in the sky

I'm...
Enlightend by the dark
A spirit of the night
Blackened I rise...

...as I walk through the gateway

...To join the dead
...So let it bleed
...I walked undead
...Now I can see
