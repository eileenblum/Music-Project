Disturbing silence rises and descends
Filling every inch with venomous fear
Figureless dark evil awaits
Demonic glowing eyes burning red and clear
Devastation, desecration, annihilation, Black Hate
It's gonna swallow you limb for limb, you're gonna drown in Black Hate
Devastation, desecration, blasphemic, Black Hate
To destroy and to crush all men create, Black Hate

Total destruction will reign
Structures built on blind faith, nothing will be saved
As the flame burns out
Their breath fog the night, frost upon their graves

Centuries of war
Upon the burnt skin that covers her tortured womb
Dark ages to come
The beasts roam the sacred ground robbing every tomb

Run like the dogs you are
The black hate will forever lurk, you will not run far
Cast yourself into the obscure
Your spirit will be extinguished like a dying star

Devastation, desecration, annihilation, Black Hate
It's gonna swallow you limb for limb, you're gonna drown in Black Hate
Devastation, desecration, blasphemic, Black Hate
To destroy and to crush all men create, Black Fucking Hate
