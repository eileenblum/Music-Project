Beneath the cracked surface of the earth
In Jotunheim where the soil is glowing
A cosmic phenomenon grows in scornful hate
It will burst out to seal your fate
You cannot escape what eyes cannot see
A wall of blood, a raging tide
All of your kind he will exterminate
What you don't know you cannot stride

The sun is burning your human skin
The radiation is stronger than ever
Blood is pumping, boiling deep within
The air reeks of hopeless fear

The serpent slowly awakes
He opens up his bloodshed eyes
He rises in might, hatred and scorn
Jormungandr is reborn

Run for your lives, dogs
He cuts like a blade, hate
Tsunami of blood
Age of chaos comes

Fire in the skies, burn
The holocaust is present, die
Turn into animals, kill
In chaos we shall drown

Blood is everywhere, the pouring source of life
Molested bodies lie in piles, decomposing in the sun
Death is inexorable, lifeless and hollow
Those who still stand will soon give in and follow

The black matter fills the atmosphere
Immense powers from forgotten times
The cosmic chaos he will canalize
Primordial being, rise...

The serpent slowly awakes
He opens up his bloodshed eyes
He rises in might, hatred and scorn
Jormungandr is reborn
