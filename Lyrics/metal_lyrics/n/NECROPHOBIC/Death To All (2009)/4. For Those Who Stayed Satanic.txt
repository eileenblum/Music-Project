[Music: S. Ramstedt, T. SidegÃ¥rd, lyrics: T. SidegÃ¥rd]

For those who stayed Satanic
and Spat on the words of the Christ
We shall rise volcanic
with the black flame burning in our eyes
For those who believed in the dark lord
Rebelled for the rights of the Strong
The Prince of darkness calling us,
in the hoofs of Goetes we belong...

I sold my soul to the devil many blackened years ago
To gain in life I traded my soul
to the bringer of light below
I was lonely but determined, Lucifer lit my way
The angels of heaven were weeping
knowing they were to be slain

I cast myself to the abyss and I fell a thousand years
I learnt how to breathe in the fire,
controlling the farthest in fears
Through torture and self bondage
I opened the passage of time
Travelled between the dimensions
In my destinies shimmering prime

We're the riders of death culture,
the prophets of the flame
Muslim, Christian, Orthodox
your lies are all the same
Join us in eternal pain, a pleasure beyond all
Come my son, into our realm,
we'll catch you when you fall

For those who stayed Satanic
and Spat on the words of the Christ
We shall rise volcanic
with the black flame burning in our eyes
For those who dared to stand Loyal
and never turned their backs
Solemn you shall be rewarded
when the Morningstar attacks...

Satanic rites in lust and fire
Exploring the pleasures of flesh
Manhandle all the witches I might come across
Let our fire within coalesce

Travel through time and dimensions unknown
We fall and we laugh as we burn
Convert to us the burning dark
In wait for father Satan's return

I sold my soul to the devil many blackened years ago
To gain in life I traded my soul
to the bringer of light below
I was lonely but determined, Lucifer lit my way
The angels of heaven were weeping
knowing they were to be slain

I saw the essence of chaos, grew stronger every night
Rituals black and unholy
in the brightness of Lucifer's light
Like a raging wave we shall crush the shores
without mercy for the weak
Earth shall be flooded in Christian blood,
of slaughter it shall reek

For those who stayed Satanic
and spat on the words of the Christ
We shall rise volcanic
with the black flame burning in our eyes
For those who believed in the dark lord
Rebelled for the rights of the strong
His day has come, he's calling us,
in the front of the Goatgod we belong...
