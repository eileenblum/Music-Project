[Music: J. BergebÃ¤ck, lyrics: T. SidegÃ¥rd]

A haunting wind from the frozen
It carries the message of death
It howls and whistles and whip through the night
It's storming towards Nazareth

As the fool is cast from the tower
To drown in the waves below
The tower is shattered of lightning
And through conceit his weakness will show

Arrogance can't breed forever
The path of the fool is foretold
As the storm is whining around him
He struggles to stay in control

The darkness is the salvation
Burning and freezing its path
The key to rise from the dead again
To grow in the storms' aftermath

Revelations of the truth
Exposing all the hidden
A burst of insight
Seeing through the riddle of the forbidden

Black flame rise within, black flame burn eternal

The storm is raging over sea and land
But yet he's standing straight
Trapped inside a wounded womb
To grow by inner faith

He will erupt in anger
His fortune will now take a turn
When facing the truth of his arrogance
First finally then he may learn
He's forced to breathe in the sulphur
He's destined to nakedly burn

Revelations of the truth
Exposing all the hidden
A burst of insight
Seeing through the riddle of the forbidden

Black flame rise within,
Black flame burn in guidance
