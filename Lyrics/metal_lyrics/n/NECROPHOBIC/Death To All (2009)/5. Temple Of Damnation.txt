[Music: S. Ramstedt, lyrics: T. SidegÃ¥rd]

Deep in the cursed wastelands
A temple in ivory white
It has shone up the nights for thousands of years
And shimmered in hatred and might
Rise mighty reptile, from the ashes of our existence

All purity now slowly decompose
The innocent rotting to perish
Eternal hate shall forever reign
All leavings of Christ shall vanish
Rise blackened phoenix, darken the brightest of stars

It is better to rule down in hell
Than forever to serve above
Let me guide you up from the darkness
Enlighten your path from below
Rise mighty reptile, from the ashes of our existence

Like phoenix the bird it will cover
The sky with its fiery wings
Descend down upon our altar
As the hymn of death it'll sing
Rise blackened phoenix, in an aura of fire and violence

I'm the stream of life in which you flow
I'm the path of your stagnation
The blood of time in which you go
Through the temple of damnation

Blood sacrifice, sacrificing lives
The process have begun, life termination
Revel in flesh and blood to celebrate the goat
In the sacred temple of damnation

Raise the blade of hatred
Colour it red in blood
The banner of retaliation,
Is hoisted up from the mud

Electric it sparks in the darkness
In the vein of light it pulsate
It throbs and whips in frustration
To rise in tremendous hate
Rise mighty reptile, from the ashes of our existence

A blaze of hope in the sky
The signal for our vengeance
And burning he shall fly
For our independence
Rise Blackened Phoenix,
in an aura of fire and violence

I'm the stream of life in which you flow
I'm the path of your stagnation
The blood of time in which you go
Through the temple of damnation

Blood sacrifice, sacrificing lives
The process have begun, life termination
Revel in flesh and blood to celebrate the goat
In the sacred temple of damnation
