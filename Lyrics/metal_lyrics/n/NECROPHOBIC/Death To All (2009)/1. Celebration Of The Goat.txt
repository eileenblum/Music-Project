[Music: S. Ramstedt, lyrics: T. SidegÃ¥rd]

See the silhouettes sharp over bloodred skies
Like serpents we shall intertwine
Lost in forever, forever as one
Ecstatic on Dionysus's wine

We perish together and float through the spheres
Defying the limits of time
Our world is in downfall and cosmos collide
Exploring the mysteries 9

An unholy communion is sworn in the night
Sexual rites for the one
Set churches on fire in twisted desire
And the war towards Christ has begun
Breeding the seeds of shadows to grow
In times of the righteous and free
When missions complete my bride of the night
You'll soar eternal with me

Goddess of lust and delight,
Fuck me like ever before
Bonded by death and sinful desires,
Forever thou shalt be my whore
Priestess of death and dark lust,
Shadowborn mother of all
Unspeakable acts of secretion and blood,
Celebration of the goat

Emotional outburst beyond human sense
Electric we hold to unite
The scent of your skin, the grace of your soul
Together we trespass the light
I'll walk you to death and death we become
To keep all your purity free
In the eyes of chaos I will end your life
To soar eternal with me

Goddess of lust and delight,
Fuck me like ever before
Bonded by death and sinful desires,
Forever thou shalt be my whore
Priestess of death and dark lust,
Shadowborn mother of all
Unspeakable acts of secretion and blood,
Celebration of the goat
