[Music: S. Ramstedt, lyrics: S. Ramstedt]

I writhe in torment, in adamantine chains and fire
the infernal serpent, from the skies into the dark
against the throne I stood, with chaos I'll return
For I am greater, through the walls I will embark

Rise...
Hell...

With mighty wings outspread,
rise from the vast abyss
Over doleful shades,
where peace and rest can never dwell
I raise the three-pronged iron spear into the sky
I'll inflame these lands
and enthrone them as the lord of hell

Rise...
Hell...

I ride the storm of hell on scorching flames
By fire embraced I'll reign
I claim this dark domain and the shadow throne
infernal enlighten gloom
I spread the wings of death and majesty
come triumph, rise cleansing fire
and god shall fear my name
Aaaaah...

through infernal thunders
tortures turns to horrid arms
In wrath not woe we rise and storm the towers high
march from this den of shame and go to open war
strike without fear, for what is dead can never die

Rise...
Hell...
