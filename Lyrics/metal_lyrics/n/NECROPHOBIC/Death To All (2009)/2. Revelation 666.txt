[Music: S. Ramstedt, lyrics: S. Ramstedt]

Damned is he that hears these words
For the time is at hand
Under a black sun and a blood red moon
Hell erupts on sacred land

On a creature pale, death will strike
With hunger, beast and sword
Avenge our blood on them that dwell
The lands of the holy lord

Blood and fire
Tormented souls in thrall
Cast upon the earth
DEATH! TO! ALL!

For the great day of his wrath is come
Black smoke risen high
In the bottomless pit the beast is crowned
As the stars fall and die

Now that the seven churches burn
And the lambs of god becomes our prey
He that hath an ear,
Let him hear what the Spirit of Satan saith

Blood and fire
Tormented souls in thrall
Cast upon the earth
DEATH! TO! ALL!

Thou shalt join the dead
From Hades over Styx
In synergy obscene
Revelation 666

In a cosmic cataclysm
Forced apocalypse
Profane the cursed shall rise
Revelation 666

The elders fell before him
That sat upon the throne
Under the black banner
They all cast there crowns

And I stood upon the sand of the sea,
And saw a crowned beast rise,
Having seven heads, ten horns
And blasphemy in his eyes

The seventh angel silenced
And the spawn of hell proclaimed
Over the kingdoms of this world
Lucifer shall reign

Blood and fire
Tormented souls in thrall
Cast upon the earth
DEATH! TO! ALL!

Thou shalt join the dead
From Hades over Styx
In synergy obscene
Revelation 666

In a cosmic cataclysm
Forced apocalypse
Profane the cursed shall rise
Revelation 666
