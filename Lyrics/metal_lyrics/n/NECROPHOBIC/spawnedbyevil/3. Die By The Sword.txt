[Originally performed by Slayer]

Live by the sword and help to contain
The helpless minds of you all
Die by my hand in pools of blood
Clutch yourself as you fall
Mindless tyranny, forgotten victims
Children slaughtered in vain
Raping the maids, in which they serve
Only the words of the lord

Die by the sword
Die by the sword

Watch as flowers decay
On cryptic life that died
The wisdom of the wizards
Is only nurtured life
Black knights of hell domain
Walk upon the dead
Satanas sips upon
The blood in which he need

Die by the sword
