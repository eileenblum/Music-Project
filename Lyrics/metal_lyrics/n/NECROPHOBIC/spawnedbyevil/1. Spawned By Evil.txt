As a cloak of darknes is streaming down
A grayish mist hits the ground
As moroii leave their graves
They suck the blood of all thy race

Communing with the ghosts of the ancient dead
Summoning the spawn of the dark
Bloodlust inside of me, I need to feel
Warm human blood float through me again

I'm moroii
Nosferatu, spawn of the night
You're turning pale
Your life is fading as I suck and bite

I cast an ancient spell, raise the undead
Out of their tombs they slowly climb
Hunger inside of me, I'm feeling weak
I need to feast on a human child

I'm moroii
Nosferatu, spawn of the night
You're turning pale
Your life is fading as I suck and bite

Spawned by evil
Spawned by shadows

Lord of lords, god of gods
Lead me to the altar
Where the virgin waits for me
I suck and drink from her cunt
