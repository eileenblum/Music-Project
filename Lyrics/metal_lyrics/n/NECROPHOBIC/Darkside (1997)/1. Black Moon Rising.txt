As I walk into unknown forests
Coldness spreads in my soul
I gaze upon the twilight skies
And behold the scornful moon
Through the winds I whisper the names
To summon the silent storms
Entering the wastelands
Where no living soul has been before

As I hear the call from the darkside
The moon turns to black
Wolves gather in the twilight
To please their thirst for blood
Possessed by spirits of evil
I watch the eclipse of the moon
The black moon I shall follow
Through the endless night

In the twilight skies
I see the black moon rising
Through the freezing night
I follow the sign of the rising moon

In the twilight skies
I see the black moon rising
Through the freezing night
I follow the sign of the rising moon

Black moon rise!

As I walk into unknown forests
Coldness spreads in my soul
I gaze upon the twilight skies
And behold the scornful moon
Through the winds I whisper the names
To summon the silent storms
Entering the wastelands
Where no living soul has been before

In the twilight skies
I see the black moon rising
Through the freezing night
I follow the sign of the rising moon
