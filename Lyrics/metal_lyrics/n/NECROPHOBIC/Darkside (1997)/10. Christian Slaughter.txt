We are the darkened souls
By nightfall we arise
The gates are open wide
The holy blood shall flow
Demonic desires to sacrifice
We burn the Christian ground
Crushing all that's sacred
Jesus Christ dethroned

Peeling the skin off the priests
Burn the holy bible
The horizon turns to black
Darkness and evil unleashed
The horde of infernal souls
Inverted is our cross
In the name of Satan
We summon the lord of hell

Christian slaughter
The season of Satan invoked
Christian slaughter
The unholy flame now burns

Gathering the darkness
To initiate the dark age
A time filled with hatred
Expulsion of all light
A creation of a shadowland
Where the wasteland lies in ruins
A realm darker than black
Eternally silent and cold

Under the diabolical moon
Legions of hell arrive
Descend upon the weak
As eternal devastation awaits
Welcome down to the abyss
The kingdom of pure evil
Where the fires forever burn
Where lord Lucifer possesses the throne

Christian slaughter
The season of Satan invoked
Christian slaughter
The unholy flame now burns

Fran nedan vi nalkas
Som natten har avlat
I drÃ¶mmarna dunkla
Om fasor fran fordom
Â 
VarfÃ¶r sÃ¶ker ni solen?
Hon giver blott smÃ¤rta
Livet Ã¤r lÃ¶gn
Din moder Ã¤r mÃ¶rkret
