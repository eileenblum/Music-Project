Under the blackened sky
I roar to the moon
Purest hate within
My revenge is coming soon
I am the one
Lucifer's one born son
I lead his legions in the holy war
I won't stop until I'm done

Satan - lead me all the way
Holy priest - forsaken you shall pray
Hate - sense my anger, wrath within
Burn - the flames will take you away

Hear the call of a thousand demons
The return of Satan's scornful legion

Purest hate
Purest hate
Inside of me

You fuckers

We're gathered here
To summon the dark forces
With purest hate
We tear your souls apart
Feel our wrath
And purify your souls
From the fiery abyss
We come to take revenge

Hail the dark wind
That sweeps away the ashes of the weak
Hear my words
Their prophecies were false
Risen - forever we'll be lusting through the worlds
Ye, he cometh
Never to fall again

Hear the call of a thousand demons
The return of Satan's scornful legion
