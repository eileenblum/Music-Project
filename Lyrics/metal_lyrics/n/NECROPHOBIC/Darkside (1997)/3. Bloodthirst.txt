In the darkness I walk alone
Through the forest of the dead
On a path where evil reigns
From the land beyond the dark moon

Sent here by my master below
To suck the blood from a human soul
The time is near, I feel it within
Bloodsoaked I must become

Bloodthirst
Bloodthirst

Deep fear, you know I'll come soon
You say a prayer and grab your cross
Fuck your god
That loser can't help you know

As you lie asleep I enter your life
With my blood aching teeth I bite through your flesh
I could have left, leaving you to die
But with a laugh I ate you alive

Bloodthirst
I have risen to drink your blood
Bloodthirst
Kneel for me, you and your god

In the darkness I walk alone
Through the forest of the dead
On a path where evil reigns
To the land beyond the dark moon

Through the wind I hear my maser's call
I must return before the sunrise
Once again evil has won
So it shall be written, so shall it be done
