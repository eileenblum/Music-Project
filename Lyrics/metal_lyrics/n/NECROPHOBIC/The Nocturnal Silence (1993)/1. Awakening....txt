My prayers have been answered
I'm no longer a victim of God
I died for the right master
The one that I will serve
They'll believe my soul is resting
But how can they be so wrong
This is where life begins
Where it will be everlasting
As a reincarnated soul
I'm rising in this unholy kingdom
A paradise made for the immortals
Where your corpse shall be our feast
Underneath the blackened ground
An unholy ritual is soon to begin
Gathering for a black mass
As I speak the words of Satan

As darkness falls
Spirits are set free
As darkness fall
Awakening of the dead

From the chalice filled with blood
We drink and increase the immortal power
United in a dance of death
To cause damnation against the false
As you call upon your fake God
Devestation is filling the air
Rising trough the gates of hell
Retaliation of the evil ones

As darkness falls
Spirits are set free
As darkness fall
Awakening of the dead
