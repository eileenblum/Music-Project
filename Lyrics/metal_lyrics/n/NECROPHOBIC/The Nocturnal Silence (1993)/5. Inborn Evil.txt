[Music: Parland/Sterner]
[Lyrics: Parland]

Born in the hands of the church
Nailed to the cross forever
Insanity of denominations
Trapped in a spell of evil
Father, give me the power
To enter the gate of time
The passage of burned and crucified souls
I must pass before I die

Peace in my mind will never be found
Betrayed by life, servant of suicide
Born to earth with visions of hate
Evil spells surrounding me
No escape from ones fate

Countless predictions of lies
The dying enter heaven
You must invoke the lord
So you shall be forgiven
Recieve the mercyful blessing
Confess your sins to God
By the gracious name of Christ
No mercy for those who are evil

Insanity - has soon taken over me
Hypocrisy - to die is my destiny
Sacrifice - soon I shall rest in peace
No escape - from the gates of immortality
