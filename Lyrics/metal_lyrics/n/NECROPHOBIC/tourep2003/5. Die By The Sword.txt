[Originally by Slayer]

Live by the sword and help to contain
The helpless minds of you all
Die by my hand in pools of blood
Clutch yourself as you fall
Mindless tyranny, forgotten victims
Children slaughtered in vain
Raping the maids, in which they serve
Only the words of the lord

Die by the sword
Die by the sword

Satan watches all of us
Smiles as some do his bidding
Try to escape the grasp of my hand
And your life will no longer exist
Hear our cry, save us from
The hell in which we live
We turn our heads toward the sky
And listen for the steel

Die by the sword
Die by the sword

Watch as flowers decay
On cryptic life that died
The wisdom of the wizards
Is only nurtured life
Black knights of hell domain
Walk upon the dead
Satanas sips upon
The blood in which he need

Die by the sword
