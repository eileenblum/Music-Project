In emptiness I roam
through the sombre dawnings
I am a living dead
haunted by shadows

End my fucking life - I will not cry
Let me fucking burn - I feel no pain

A life extinct, drowned in sorrow
Dazed by hate and deceit
I sense but immense apathy
when I hear the deathbells toll within

Mourningsoul in torment
Dwell in the obscure
Forever to lurk the unknown
Where will I find my fate

Spread your deadly wings
Let them embrace my soul
Fly me through endless nights
Let me enter the dark domain

Bury my soul among the storms
when I step into an age of darkness
I yearn for thy blessing
Invoke the beast in me

I seek redemption, not for my soul
My salvation is not like yours to behold
The darkest sky beares scars of light
And even death is much to bright

Without a heart one cannot bleed
What is already dead can never leave
The utter cold is what I choose
With a frozen soul and my eyes closed

Take me down to hell - I'll swear the oath
Mark my bleeding soul - I'll sign in blood

As I watch my final sundown
surrounded by past recollections
In the gathering dusk
sorrow is exceeding me
When I close my eyes one last time
I see my burning wrath
