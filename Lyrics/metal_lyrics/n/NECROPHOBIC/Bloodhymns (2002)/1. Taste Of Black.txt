Ancient Beast
Buried, hidden since time before time
A new awake
Risen and ready to feed

I have returned
To consume, to devastate
Set the world in flames
I'm the one you speak of in fear

Calm is over
I gather storms, I rip the heaven
Outbursting rage
Spreads like a plague across the earth

Watch me now
I'm revealed in front of your eyes
How does it feel
when I deform into your worst nightmare

Prince of darkness - hellspawned, the spirit of evil
Prince of darkness - hellspawned, the angel of death

Confront me now
Weak, inferior christian filth
Turn to your faith
My resurrection will be your fall

I'll lay your world to waste
I'll bury your dreams divine
I will erase your history
I will bring storms of mayhem

New dawn arise
Where evil reigns and the cross is burning
The wicked are unleashed
to rejoice and revel in primitive lust

Join us now
Sign your destiny to me with your blood
Feel the taste of black
In Nomine Dei Nostri Satanas

Prince of darkness - hellspawned, the spirit of evil
Prince of darkness - hellspawned, the angel of death
