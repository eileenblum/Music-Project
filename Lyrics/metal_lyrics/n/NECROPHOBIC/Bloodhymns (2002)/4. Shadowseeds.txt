Ancient evil whisper through the winter breeze
Predatory creatures in desperate need of human blood
Hear the deaden choirs as they rise up from the abyss
The fallen angels condemned to wander endless nights

Metamorphosis, a last step into the unknown
From Faust to Mephisto, from light to dark, it has only begun
Float through Baphomet to coalesce with the unholy goat
The world is ours, the earth is now in our control

Nosferatu, prince of death, I speak thy name
Immortalized you haunt the night and thou wilt slay

There she lies with angellike face so peacefully
Palewhite skin, unscarred, speaks of her innocence
She looks so calm but in her dream she twist in despair
Hallucinating of a rising burning hell

Incubus enter her dream
Fertilize her virgin womb
Plant the astral shadowseeds
Let her fucking burst

Destructive visions appear of the apocalypse
The holocaust is here, it's rising from the abyss
Fire and ice is one cosmic catastrophe
A triumph for the cursed ones, the growing shadowseeds
