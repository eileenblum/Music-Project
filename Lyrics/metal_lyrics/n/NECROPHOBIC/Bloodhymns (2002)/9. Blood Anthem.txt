Soon it is time to join the immortals
I strike on command, defeat leads me forward
Dust in the air, the bitter taste
Of death in my mouth, soon I'll be there

I am but one of thousands to go
The beast in my heart is all that I know
I slay to the ground all that I see
Death by my hand is all that will be

Up in the sky circling above us
Awaiting our death, awaiting our fall
The carnivores smile, the shadow of death
A vulture all black, but I have no fear

Soon it is me who is stabbed to the ground
My soul flying free, my spirit unbound
The greeting of death as my life fades away
Left on the ground my limbs to decay

Bloodhymns now loud and clear
Bloodhymns as life disappears

As I stand by the sea of blood
And bodies raped by silence
I hear the souls, the immortal ones
Sing a hymn for the dying

A new day will dawn and I will be gone
The blood that is spilled will dry in the sun
The sadest of songs still in the air
The anthem of blood will always be there

Wherever I go I still will be blind
Whatever they do, I'll always be numb
Infest my soul, devour my flesh
Scatter my dreams, only hatred is left
