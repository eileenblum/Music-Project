In the twilight hour at the dusk of my life I face the reaper's  smile
I leave all fear as I cross the gates and begin my journey down
I found myself anaesthetic to dwell forever in sin
But slowly I awoke to feel my hatred burn within

I have sailed my ship on a sea of blood, ndless deep and red
I hit the shore with sails all torn, wounded, almost dead
Stranded in the underworld, growing like a seed
But I will find the ones above and I will make them bleed

Sinners come, sinners burn, sinners never leave
I'm not like them, I will return
My vengeance you will see

I punch my fist right through your flesh and tear out your fucking spine
Bending as hell until it snaps, now you are truly mine
Where is your almighty father now, forsaken you weap in pain
Wishing you where on that pathetic cross of yours as I mount you again...and again

This is where I've always been and what I always meant to be
A spirit in the shadow of Satan's mind, now finally I can see
The flames of hell burn in my soul and Lucifer's wrath is mine
Hell will be wherever I go and the reaper will be my guide

Superlunary orbital cosmic ecstasy
Out of the sky I burst in might
My vengeance you will see
