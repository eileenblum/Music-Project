The time will come when heaven will face our last attack
And hell will be among us under a sky solid black
Eternally dark and silent, their final destiny
Whose souls are put on fire by our hatred burning free

We strike with wrath upon them, born of christian blood
And so they meet the reaper, stripped of all their faith
The sea of blood is boiling, with rage it hits the shore
Their kingdom and their glory swept away forever more

Ooh...helfire
Aah...helfire
Aah...helfire
Ooh...helfire

Hidden in the shadows, about to seal their fate
Gathered in fury, we are to storm the gates
Darkness now is growing stronger than the light
In silence we're awaiting the long eternal night

The father and the spirit, their holy bastard son
As lies they'll be remembered, unholy we have won
Soon they lay forgotten, buried underground
Of heaven they'll see nothing, nor ever hear a sound

Ooh...helfire
Aah...helfire
Aah...helfire
Ooh...sweet helfire
