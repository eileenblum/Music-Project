The eleventh horn to follow ten kings
A son of perdition against the most high
A beast about to rise from the bottomless abyss
Going into destruction to bring down the skies
The tail of the beast through the welkin tore
And the angels were swept from heaven to hell
The stars of glory thrown to the earth
Where the fallen revolt, where the fallen rebel

The lord of lords and the king of kings
Will assent and follow the beast
Heâll watch the world marvel beneath
In contempt his wrath is released

The antichrist is said to arise
And speak the words of blasphemy
Like countless before opposing the throne
Only this time, triumphantly
The blood of the lamb shed on the cross
The stench of rot in his lungs
Will guide the path as the command is howled
With seven heads and seven tongues

The lord of lords and the king of kings
Will assent and follow the beast
Heâll watch the world marvel beneath
In contempt his wrath is released

Hellspawn into the dark
A devilâs child of the wasteland
Hellborn he lights the spark
Ignite the flames of the necrogram
The rain of a thousand tears divine
Vaporise in flames covering their shrine
Hellsworn he bears the mark
He bears the mark of the necrogram

Come! O death
Rider of the creature pale as winter
Bring down your sword on the emerald throne
Let them all be slain, let them lie forgotten

The serpent stands with fangs all bared
Awaiting the birth to devour their descendant
He will bear the sign, the blackest of stars
Forged in hellfire the devilâs pendant
Luciferâs child will subdue and deny
The kingdom of heaven, the kingdom up high
For the day has come and the path is mine
As the end draws nigh

The lord of lords and the king of kings
Will assent and follow the beast
I watch the world marvel beneath
In contempt my wrath is released

Hellspawn into the dark
A devilâs child of the wasteland
Hellborn I light the spark
Ignite the flames of the necrogram
The rain of a thousand tears divine
Vaporise in flames covering their shrine
Hellsworn I bear the mark
I bear the mark of the necrogram
