The king is climbing down to take control
Raise up now the forceful flag of hate
Fangs of death will rape your soul
In the flare of black flames beyond the gate
Belial gobbles with furious gluttony
Screams of anguish devour humans whole

Crown of horns - angel of death
Crown of horns - Beelzebub's reeking breath
Crown of horns - ancient God
Crown of horns - let there be blood

Since the dawn of time
Old gods and chaos reigned
Lord of fire in his prime
Blind obedience reverence chained
Yet again black angels are rising
Reapers of the good, legions of the vile

Raise your hate, embrace the darkness
The night that spreads will be starless
Army of the damned will be fearless
Our evangelical majesty will be crowned by the horns

Brimstone and ashes through the mist
Smokeless fires, blazing flames like whips
Fangs of death will rape your soul
From the bottomless deep reawaken Antichrist
Sons of Abraham, you will die
Screams of anguish devour humans whole

Crown of horns - angel of death
Crown of horns - Beelzebub's reeking breath
Crown of horns - ancient God
Crown of horns - let there be blood
