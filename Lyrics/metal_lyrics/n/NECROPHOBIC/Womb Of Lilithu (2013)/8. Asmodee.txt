I summon thee Asmodee, archangel of impurity
Disclose before us Shemhamforasch
I conjure thee Chashmodai
Spreading chaos Anno Domini
Lepaca Aeshma Lepaca Daeva

Exhilarated lust by carnal desire
Now that lust comes the 7 deadly sins

I am daemon king Sidonay
Under Lucifer my emperor
Violent taking throne of Salomon
Then aim to disgrace Tetragrammaton

I summon thee Asmodee, Ye that knoweth astronomy
Raging fiend who foretell future
I conjure thee Chashmodai
Come chaos come mystify
Lepaca Aeshma Lepaca Daeva

Exhilarated lust by carnal desire
Now that lust comes the 7 deadly sins

I am daemon king Sidonay
Under Lucifer my emperor
Violent taking throne of Salomon
Then aim to disgrace the whole fucking Tetragrammaton

The one who fall to Asmodeus ways
Will be sentenced to an eternity
In the second level down the abyss of hell
Deleriant to fumble astray

By the powers of Amaymon
We call thee Asmoday
To giveth ring of virtues
And showeth where treasures lay

I summon thee Asmodee, halfbreed of incestery
Tubal-cain mated sister Naamah
I conjure thee Chashmodai
Belches fire, purify
Lepaca Aeshma Lepaca Daeva

Exhilarated lust by carnal desire
Now that lust comes the 7 deadly sins

I am daemon king Sidonay
Under Lucifer my emperor
Violent taking throne of Salomon
Then aim to disgrace Tetragrammaton
