Wings of fire shall upblaze the Sky
Let enlighten my spirit, wheneth sweeping by
Ye who harvest in fortune, while singeth sweet notes
Ye marquis of balance great from the realm of thoughts

A distant songster, singeth like child
Innocent it calleth thee to walketh by its side

Winds of the west carry my words
Let them be swept far beyond, let them be heard
Turn space into void and void into time
Ye poetry fire flier of words sublime

A distant songster, singeth like child
Innocent it calleth thee to walketh by its side

Now come forth, I conjure thee
Let thy silhouette majestic encircle the sun
Now come forth, marquis Phenex
Reclaim thy righteous destiny in the order of thrones

Communing clairaudient since darkest of times
Yet under your wing there's a child to be found
Bestial angel of liberal science and art
Fulfil my desires within devour my heart

Black shining feathers fall away as thou flies
Hunt to devour souls striketh night burning skies
Entrance thine victims when singeth soporific tones
Hopeth to return upon thy righteous seventh throne
