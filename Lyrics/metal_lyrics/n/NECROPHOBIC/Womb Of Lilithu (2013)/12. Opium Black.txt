By this sign and hieroglyph
I summon thee from ancient myth
Petrified in history
My invocation set thou free
Bound but only by my will
To banish space as time stand still

Risen power energy
Confined in genius and insanity
Let silence seal this wicked vow
As serpents slithers crucified upon the Tau

Ancient one, hear heed my call
And rise for me Lilitus spawn

I'm drugged I'm drunken on oriental poison
Manifests in visions and many voices
Traitorous lord of lies
With split forked tongue and deadened eyes

Ancient one, hear heed my call
And rise for me Lilitus spawn

I Invoke thee from thy desert abode
To reapeth harvest of seeds unsowed
Cast thy shadow opium black
Upon altar and temple from beyond and back

Traitorous lord of lies
I praise ye by bloodied virgin sacrifice
Feared above all mortal fright
Arise Mahavatar cloaked in night

Ancient one, hear heed my call
And rise for me Lilitus spawn

I Invoke thee from thy desert abode
To reapeth harvest of seeds unsowed
Cast thy shadow opium black
Upon altar and temple from beyond and back

Ancient one, hear heed my call
And rise for me Lilitus spawn

I Invoke thee from thy desert abode
To reapeth harvest of seeds unsowed
Cast thy shadow opium black
Upon altar and temple from beyond and back
