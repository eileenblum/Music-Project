Furfur furfures
Duke of darkness, earl of hell

Intrude our realm let be revealed
In corners three we summon thee
Ye who speak in riddles
Ye of truth unveiled
Lesser key of greater secrets
Rise now as we summon thee

Ye who cryptic speaketh poisoned words
Furfur
Ye who's turning nature furious
Flaming earl
Ye carnal ego spirit unsanctified
Black hellfire
Immerse our world evoked from triangle
Furcifer

Cruel commander of nine and twenty legions
Wire up yourself in chaos of fire
Upraise to ablaze by the presence
Upraise in violence on telluric latitudes

From underworld and shadows deep
We summon ye oh darkened key
To break the spell, untie thou bonds
We crush thou chains, we set you free
Aftermath in emptiness
Global grieving gruesome death
Wounds cut open, cut to bleed
Draining death in misery
Bestial angel flagrant fallen
Violent speaketh with a hoarse voice
Raiseth lightening, blast and thunder
Cometh with tempestuous storms

Furfur furfures
Duke of darkness, earl of hell
Ye who rideth storms chaotic
Cold destructive winds qlipphotic

Ye who cryptic speaketh poisoned words
Furfur
Ye who's turning nature furious
Flaming earl
Ye carnal ego spirit unsanctified
Black hellfire
Immerse our world evoked from triangle
Furcifer

Cruel commander of nine and twenty legions
Wire up yourself in chaos of fire
Upraise to ablaze by the presence
Upraise in violence on telluric latitudes

Ye who cryptic speaketh poisoned words
Furfur
Ye who's turning nature furious
Flaming earl
Ye carnal ego spirit unsanctified
Black hellfire
Immerse our world evoked from triangle
Furcifer

Cruel commander of nine and twenty legions
Wire up yourself in chaos of fire
Upraise to ablaze by the presence
Upraise in violence on telluric latitudes
