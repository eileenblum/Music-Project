Thee I invoke, from the order of dominations
Thee, that lurketh in the shadow of Taurus
Thee I invoke that ruleth two Hundred legions
Thee that weareth the crown of a king

Appeareth with a thundering roaring,
as in Circulo Salomonis
One out of the eight sub-princes
Obedient only to chief rebel Lucifer
Beelzebub, Magot, Asmodee, Astarot
Oriens, Amaimon, Ariton, Paimonia

Thee I invoke, great daemon king infernal
Thee, who dwellest in the void place of the spirit
Thee I invoke, to reveal the mysteries of the earth
Thee that giveth dignity and confirmeth the same

Appeareth with a thundering roaring,
as in Circulo Salomonis
One out of the eight sub-princes
Obedient only to chief rebel Lucifer
Saraph, Tirana, Morel, Malutens,
Melhaer, Mermo, Ekdulon, Moschel,
Katini, Chuschi, Rachiar, Nagid,
Emphastison, Hear me, I conjure Thee, Paimon

Teach me about art and science
Discover unto me what the earth really is
What holdeth it up in the waters,
and what is mind and where is it

Attended by princes Bebal and Abalam
To be observed towards the west
He who rideth the dromedary beast
To be revealed on conjurers request
Appeareth with a thundering roaring,
as in Circulo Salomonis
One out of the eight sub-princes
Obedient only to chief rebel Lucifer
Beelzebub, Magot, Asmodee, Astarot
Oriens, Amaimon, Ariton, Paimonia

Come Forth Paimon
Come Forth Paimon
