Gha'agsheblah Hell salamanders
Midst a furious storm, up blazing wind
Thy darkness infringe hither upon us
The arrival of thee devouring prince

Whither thou goest, we shalt go

Chief rebel governor, first hierarchy
Fowled angel with black feathered wings
Holdeth viper majestic dragon beast carried
Within circle ceremonial let be revealed

Whither thou goest, we shalt go

Imperium magnum infernalis
Ash-Taroth Ash-Taroth
Ash-Taroth Ash-Taroth

Thou was one of the seven princes of hell
That on earth paid a visit to Faust
One of the celestial angels that fell
Rebelling the dissidents cause
Now times of vengeance has reached us at last
The wind turns our way into rage
United we stand in a circle of death
To welcome this new darkened age

Now answereth truly the matters
Of future, the present and past
Ye provider of liberal sciences
Ars goetian daemon bombast

Whither thou goest, we shalt go

Hurtful angel poisonous cometh
Alongside disease and cold death
Followed by forty legions of spirits
Stunning immense with noisome breath

Whither thou goest, we shalt go

Imperium magnum infernalis
Ash-Taroth Ash-Taroth
Ash-Taroth Ash-Taroth

We summon thee our fallen prince
We study the knowledge thou teach
To master the past and the future we claim
In exchange we give in our full loyalty

We kneel thy majestic arrival
Lord of all fortune and wealth
Commander of legions infernal
Master of silence and stealth

Whither thou goest, we shalt go

Infatuate with your presence
We drown in your infinitive eyes
Treasurer of hell, chaos born
Let kingdom of Astaroth rise...

Whither thou goest, we shalt go

Imperium magnum infernalis
Ash-Taroth Ash-Taroth
Ash-Taroth Ash-Taroth

Thou was one of the seven princes of hell
That on earth paid a visit to Faust
One of the celestial angels that fell
Rebelling the dissidents cause
Now times of vengeance has reached us at last
The wind turns our way into rage
United we stand in a circle of death
To welcome this new darkened age
