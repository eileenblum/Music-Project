Shake shake
Seal listen
Emptiness, fullness open
Thaumiel, my star, you have thrown us into Nothingness,
Amen,
Lucifer, Ouia, Kameron,
I love you, into the void of... to the border of...
I hear you now! A voice in the silence

I never thought I'd see your face
I do. Vonton, Uli, Socierno PÃ¨atan,
You are here, master, you are here
Your sin made us eternal
Venite Lucifer

Shake shake
Seal listen
Shake as the eye opens
A flash. Silence, silence
Come to me, embrace me
You eternal infernal

I never thought I'd see your face
I do. Vonton, Uli, Socierno PÃ¨atan,
You are here, master, you are here
Your sin made us eternal
Venite Lucifer
Amen.

Aliscor, Mandusemini, Poemi, Oriel,
Madugruse, Parinoscon, Estio, Dumogon

Shake shake
Seal listen
A face in the middle of the shadow, in the circle
You are the highest
Your horns are your crown

I never thought I'd see your face
I do. Vonton, Uli, Socierno PÃ¨atan,
You are here, master, you are here
Your sin made us eternal
Venite Lucifer
Amen.
