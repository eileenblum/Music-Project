Prowler of the endless night
Helvetical Earl upon gryphon ride
Ye, soldier weareth thine Duces crowne
When cometh accompanied grand trumpets sound

Shemhamephoresh
In the Gibbous eighth hour after sundown
Shemhamephoresh
I summon thy spirit MurMux daemon

Necromancer, Shadowdancer
Constrains deceased come forth and answer

O' spirit that knoweth philosophie
Unto witches desire generously teach, absolutely
Ye whom commune the shades of the dead
And oblige chosen souls of the deceased

Shemhamephoresh
Blaspheme the name of the hebrew god
Shemhamephoresh
Whence, comest thou MurMux daemon?

Necromancer, Shadowdancer
Constrains deceased come forth and answer
Divinations infernalis
Insight cometh Necropolis

MurMur Necromancer
MurMur Shadowdancer

Encircle the subconcious to strengthen the sorcerer's astral body and armour
Let from the Beyond voices speak inwards
And enligteneth the magician with tremendous celestial insight
Evil demons of matter and the shells of the dead once cast out of order of thrones
Now in transmutation as becometh demonic divine

Daemonic moonshine on worried skies
Soon engulfed by dark lunar side
Gibbous zenith darkened light
Necropolis open wide

Shemhamephoresh
The lesser key to the great shadowless
Shemhamephoresh
Ye whom fullsome bequeath, MurMux Daemon

Necromancer, Shadowdancer
Constrains deceased come forth and answer
Divinations infernalis
Insight cometh Necropolis
