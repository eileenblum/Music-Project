Under the grace of evil
Vultures gather on the fields of death
Darkness layers have failed
Blackened soul rode to watch the liars
All they stand in a circle
By the one they hail. Hail

Black night raven
Black night raven

As the dawning breaks
Burst out its prevailing rage
A Militia of newborn beasts
Crushing through the light of wicked embrace
None can turn away
Further guided by a spirit dead
As initiated to the legions below
Resurrecting hell. Hell

Black night raven we summon thee
Black night raven to discard the enemy
Black night raven soaring my field
Black night raven shadow of defeat

Rise now Andrianas, rise
Piercing sulphurous blades
Draining the sacred fluid
To distract the condemning race

Evocation of christians in demise
Vanish in the absence of apocalyptic angel witch
Riding upon proving grounds
Like a shaft of lightning he rideth
His furious slaughtering hound
Cursing the race of mankind
Nor to be seen nor to be found

Rise now Andrianas, rise
Piercing sulphurous blades
Draining the sacred fluid
To distract the condemning race

Sway to the winds of the north
Conjuring the spirit of Seth and come forth
Heading towards the borders
To crush the reapy wheat
Quaking the lure in our world
To serve its master and its evil deeds

Black night raven we summon thee
Black night raven to discard the enemy
Black night raven roaring on the field
Black night raven a shadow of defeat

Rise now Andrianas, rise
Piercing sulphurous blades
Draining the sacred fluid
To distract the condemning race
