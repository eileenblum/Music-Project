Darken roams the beast, wicked ruler of the sixth world
Upraise now, black light and most vicious flames
Forces superior infernal to come
Trembles the earth soon to succumb

Black hilted blade of barbarous evocation
Driven by murderous faustian hunger
Adversarial dagger forged by the black flame
Seeketh flesh, devour children and blood sacrifice
Spirits of western gates, evil twilight and grave
I summon ye forth, twisted faces of death

Hekas Hekau Hekas,
by all Jupiter moons

Lord of Djinns, Mattan Buka
Ye that lurketh the shades by Jupiter moons

Black hilted blade of barbarous evocation
Driven by murderous faustian hunger
Adversarial dagger forged by the black flame
Seeketh flesh, devour children and blood sacrifice
Spirits of western gates, evil twilight and grave
I summon ye forth, twisted faces of death

Darken romas the beast, wicked ruler of the sixth world
Upraise now, black light and most vicious flames
Forces superior infernal to come
Trembles the earth soon to succumb
