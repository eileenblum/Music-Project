Join the sabbath
The cult of Hades
Inhale the wisdom
The demonic ways
I am the prophet
I speak his will
My acid blessings
Demands a sacrificial kill

The truth I chant for you to abide
Follow my path, embrace the divine

Place your soul on the altar
I slay the heathens with your hand
Hades, the unholy master
Had made me at one with the gods
The gods!

I breathe the toxins of Delphi
Dionysos enslaves my mind
I summon the goats, I harvest
Your dreams, your despair
Take my knife and destroy
In the name of the lord
Slaughter the nonbeliever
And drink the poison

Embrace the oracle! Obey!
OBEY!
