Dwelling in the abyss
I protect the gates
Beyond my unholy kingdom
The underworld awaits

But I hear a warning of danger
From a griffin - watching from the skies
That a pestilent "hero" approaches
And he's armed with a fistful of lies

You may have vanquished my brethren
With your corruptive, deceitful ways
But I am the three headed hell hound of Hades
I am your bane to be faced

As you beheaded the Hydra
The typhoon beast of the sea
You have passed your eleven labours
On your quest to enslave me

Yet I laugh
At your futile attempts
I am Kerebros
And I'm fuckin' hell bent

Past the black pillars of madness
Is the portal to my nest
Surrounded by a halo of vultures
Ready to tear into your flesh
All that is heard is
The sound of crushing bones
As you enter the domain
I revel in my triumph
Herakles is slain!

Twelve titanous thresholds
Twelve labours of death
Twelve offspring of typhon
Twelve depths of Hades
