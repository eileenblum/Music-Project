Black mass!
We congregate in the night
To sacrifice
To the bull abandoned by light
Slay the virgins!
Let their blood run through his maze
As the horned fiend of Chandakas
Feeds upon his prey

Into the dungeon
Face his hellish grin
The Minotaur is ravenous
Let the ritual... begin!

A bronze spear emerges
Over the tomb of Ikaros

Drenched in the poison of the Athens
But this venom is not the end for us

A vengeful force of corruption
Idolized, appraised
Enters the Tauren chambers
Wielding daggers of deceit

But the demon's horns are piercing
Black sails are raised
The Daedalean cemetery
His martyrdom, his defeat

Succumb to the labyrinth
Obey the vulture priest
Hail the coven of the Minotaur
Worship the beast!
