Leaving the realms of Helios
To consult the seers
I seek the truth beyond the Erebos
The blood of goats I bear

Step down into the abyss
Sacrifice the blackest of the black

The prophet is summoned
Gather the blood wisdom

Guided by a blind demon
Revealing the path into Hades
To escape the wrath of Poseidon
And relinquish the light

Take this crimson offering!

Hail the ghost with the scepter
Take revenge on the gods

The prophet is summoned
Gather the blood wisdom

Ingesting tiresias
As madness unweaves
The odyssey resides in us
With the truth of Thebes
