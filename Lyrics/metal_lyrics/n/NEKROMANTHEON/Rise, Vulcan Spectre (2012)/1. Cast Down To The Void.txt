Devoured by the titan
Usurpers of the harvest, bastards of god
The eternal, the suppressor
An heir to the throne, father of the sky
Saturn consuming
His blood, the storms of Olympus
To castrate the sky
And face infernal comeuppance

Saturn almighty from beyond
Destroyer of truth, let no demon overthrow
Your ominous golden age
Xylokastro remains eternal

Abolished from your stronghold forever
Cast down to the void
Condemned to the pits of Gehennah
Cast down to the void

Procreation of Typhon
The beast that swallow the stars
Summoning the storm daemon
With viper coils, and fire from his eyes
To conquer the cyclops
And slay the hecatonchires
But destined for chthonic wrath
Under aetna, the beast must lie

Enslaved in the infinite
Tartaros takes his soul
The soothsayer foretold
Kronos, the titan must fall

Abolished from your stronghold forever
Cast down to the void
Condemned to the pits of Gehennah
Cast down to the void
