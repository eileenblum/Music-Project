Devastation is at hand
Face impending doom
Lashing out for the golden fleece
And our volcanic blood
The imminent fall of Syracuse
Dangling over the throne
A vindictive razor, a venomous fang
The lex talionis

The face of death from above
As the titan releases the mother of all
But our ancient evil grows stronger
We already breathe the ashes

Embrace the destruction
Let them ravish the land
Strike the sword of Damokles
The usurper command

Sulphur storms
Smoke from the burning flesh
Acid rain
Pouring down the twelve depths
An envoy of mutated corpses
Twisting your spine to a coil
And the nuclear winter empowers us,
Makes our blood boil

The fear is plentiful for tyrants
No aegis to withstand the attack
We feed on the toxic radiation
And summon the crows in black

Embrace the destruction
Let them ravish the land
Strike the sword of Damokles
The usurper command
