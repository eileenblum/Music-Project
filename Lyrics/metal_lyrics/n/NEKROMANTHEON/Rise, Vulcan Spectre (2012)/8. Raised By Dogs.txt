Offspring of Ares, children of war
Left like lepers to die
Thrown in the river to rid you of shame
This is where legend began

Bred by Lupus, raised by dogs
An empire emerge from the pack
Bred by Lupus, raised by dogs
Our legion is ready to attack!

As deadly as the three headed
Cerebrus of Hades
The alpha begins to slay from his own clan
In a conflict determing their might and power
His death and demise, the birth of eternity

A king brought up by wolves and whores
Legions of war, raised by dogs

Brute force of conquest
Face annihilation
