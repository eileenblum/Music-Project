A blistering bloody apparition
Devoted to the underground
Only he can break the chains
He is summoned to eradicate the filth

Ascend from the ashes!

To wield the axe
The divine craft
To control the flames
Of volcanic might

Rise, vulcan spectre
Lord of the ancient arts
Rise, vulcan spectre
And scorch the earth

The phantom of Hephaistos returns
Hammering metal for the gods
Creator of the thrones in the palace
The fallen blacksmith, arise

Banished from the thrones in Olympus
He fell nine days and nine nights
Now is his time to return
To resurrect the ways of the old

Rise, vulcan spectre
Lord of the ancient arts
Rise, vulcan spectre
And scorch the earth

A wraith possessed by madness
Spawned from the necromancy
Of a thousand unholy demons
The spectre is unleashed

To slay the false
With his hammer of death
Eternal hails
To the phantom knight
