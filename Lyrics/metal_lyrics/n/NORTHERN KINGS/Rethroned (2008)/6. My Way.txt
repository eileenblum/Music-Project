[Frank Sinatra cover]

And now
The end is near
And so I face
The final curtain

My friend
I'll say it clear
I'll state my case
Of which I'm certain

I've lived
A life that's full
I've travelled each
And every highway

And more
Much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets
I've had a few
But then again
Too few to mention

I did
What I had to do
And saw it through
Without exemption

I planned
Each chartered course
Each careful step
Along the byway

And more
Much more than this
I dit it my way

Yes, there were times
I'm sure you knew
When I bit off
More than I could chew
But through it all
When there was doubt
I ate it up
And spit it out
I faced it all
And I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved
I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill
My share of losing

And now
As tears subside
I find it all
So amusing

To think
I did all that
And may I say
Not in a shy way

Oh no
Oh no, not me
I did it my way

For what is a man
What has he got
If not himself
Then he has not
To say the things
He'd truly feels
And not the words
Of one who kneels
The record shows
I took the blows
And did it my way

Yes it was my way
