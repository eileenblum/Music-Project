[originally by Tina Turner]Out of the ruins
Out from the wreckage
Can't make the same mistake this time
We are the children
The last generation
We are the ones they left behind
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change it
Living under the fear till nothing else remains

We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond the thunderdome

Looking for something we can rely on
There's got to be something better out there
Love and compassion (love and compassion),
Their day is coming (their day is coming)
All else are castles built in the air (air)

And I wonder when we are ever gonna change it
Living under the fear till nothing else remains
All the children say

We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond the thunderdome

So will our story shine like a life?
We leave only a mark
Will our story shine like a light
Or end in the dark?
Give it all or nothing

We don't need another hero!
We don't need to know the way home!
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome!

We don't need another hero!
We don't need to know the way home!
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome!

WE ARE THE CHILDREN!
OH, I WONDER, IF WEâRE EVER GONNA CHANGE IT!
(Nothing else remains...)
THE LAST GENERATION!
(HM, WE CAN LEAD YOU OUT OF THE RUINS!)

OUT FROM THE WRECKAGE!
(OUT FROM THE WRECKAGE!)
