[originally by Jethro Tull]

Fallen on hard times
But it feels good to know
That milk and honeys just around the bend
Running on bad lines
Wed better run as we go
Tear up, tear up the overdraft again

Oh, dear prime minister
It's all such a mess
Go right ahead and pull the rotten tooth
Oh, mr. president
you've been put to the test
Come clean, for once, and hit us with the truth

Looking for sunshine
Oh but it's black and it's cold
Yet, you say that milk and honeys just round the bend
Giving us a hard time, my friends
Handing us the same line again

Fallen on hard times
And theres nowhere to hide
Now they've re-possessed the rolls royce and the mink

Turning on the peace sign
And it's back to the wood
Soon there will be raised a holy stink.

Somebody wake me
I've been sleeping too long
Oh, I dont have to take this lying down
You can keep your promises
Shove'em where they belong
Dont ask me to the party
Won't be around
