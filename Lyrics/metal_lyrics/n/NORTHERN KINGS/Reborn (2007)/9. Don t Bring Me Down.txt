[originally by Electric Light Orchestra]

You got me running going out of my mind
You got me thinking that I'm wasting my time.
Don't bring me down,no no no no no
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

You wanna stay out with your fancy friends
I'm tellin you it's go to be the end
Dont bring me down,no no no no no no no no
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Dont bring me down

Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down

What happend to the girl I used to known
You let your mind out somewhere down the road
Don't bring me down,no no no no no
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

You're always talking bout your crazy nights
One of these days youre gonna get it right
Don't bring me down,no no no no no
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down

You're looking good just like a snake in the grass
One of these days you're gonna break your glass
Don't bring me down,no no no no no no no no
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

You got me shaking got me running away
You get me crawling up to you everyday
Don't bring me down,no no no no no
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down
