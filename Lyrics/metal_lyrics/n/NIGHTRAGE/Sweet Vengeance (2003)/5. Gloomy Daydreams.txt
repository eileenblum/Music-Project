Destroyed monuments and strange sounds,
a frightening sunbeam overshadow the screams of despair,
roaming at the endless plains of grief,
hiding from a world so cruel searching for the light.

Walking around demolitions and thorns,
waiting for the charming fairies,
pain and destruction, miserable pleasures
and black and white jollity.

[CHORUS:]
Slaughtered this fragile world composing
The requiem of the cardinal song of youth
It's too close the road between madness and sanity.

Guided from pure emotions which squeezed from warlike outcry,
chasing away the black destiny and overcome
the fathomless path of the dusky malady.

[CHORUS]

[1st LEAD - Gus ]
[2nd LEAD - Marios]

Destroyed monuments and strange sounds, a frightening sunbeam
overshadow the screams of despair,
roaming at the endless plains of grief,
hiding from a world so cruel searching for the light.

[CHORUS]
