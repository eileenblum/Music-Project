Desperate into shadows of pain, you never believed,
I've heard it all before, beyond the frontiers of his miserable world,
blazing souls abandoned in a perpetual journey.

The pain distorted his face, killing one another, and after,
there was dead silence, hypocrite I don't believe in your idle words,
everything he said, rings hollow.

[CHORUS:]
The horizon was ablaze with the setting sun,
everything is like the glow of the setting sun.

[BRIDGE:]
Suppressed voices, smothered laughter.
