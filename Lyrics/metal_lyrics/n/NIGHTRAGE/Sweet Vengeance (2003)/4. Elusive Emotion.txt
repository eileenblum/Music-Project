A tortured soul, this fear preyed upon my mind,
how I wish to get away from this ill-fated circle of hallucinations,

It's beyond my comprehension,

I was deceived into believing that he might mend his ways,
don't delude yourself, a fixed match, as the evening wore on,
stranger in a strange land, it's so tragic.

You lose everything you love, without a touch of emotions, frozen.

[CHORUS:]
This life is only like an elusive emotion, the years rolled on,
his face clouded over with sorrow.

[LEAD - Marios]

You lose everything you love, without a touch of emotions, frozen.

[CHORUS]
