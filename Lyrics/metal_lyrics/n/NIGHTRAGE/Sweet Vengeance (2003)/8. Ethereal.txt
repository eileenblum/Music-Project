With borrowed smiles and masks,
selling values and frightening
spirits which had nothing to give you.
I want to know if you live or if you are dead.

Dressed in mourning cursed beings,
cut out since the beginning of time with the original sin.

I want to speak and look so profoundly inside this debris heart,
can you hear me?
She wrapped with ethereal veils and shrouds.

[CHORUS:]
You tried to see behind wounded eyes
Doomed to float in the maelstrom of war.

You sit there and wait they had nothing to give you
Sinful passions and leer glances want to rending your soul.

[HARMONY LEAD - Marios / Gus]

[1st LEAD - Marios]
[2nd LEAD - Gus]

Dressed in mourning cursed beings,
cut out since the beginning of time with the original sin.

I pity you for your wretchedness
I don't think that you have ever lived for me you were always dead.

[CHORUS]
