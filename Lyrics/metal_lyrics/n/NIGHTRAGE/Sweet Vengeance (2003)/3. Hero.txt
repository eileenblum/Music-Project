Hoping for a vision, think of all the dreams you have lost,
your actions will resound forever in eternity,
can anyone listen to your heartrending lament this last time.

You build castles in the air with an ingratiating smile.
The road of the solitary traveller, psalmodys and elegys
that had been heard and forgot in the vale of tears.

[CHORUS:]
Speak to me now lord of the skies
You are the only one who knows
Hero in a world of demons.

[1st LEAD - Gus]
[2nd LEAD - Marios]

[BRIDGE:]
The code of honour follows a course
When all is said and done
Your actions will resound.

Hoping for a vision, think of all the dreams you have lost,
your actions will resound forever in eternity,
can anyone listen to your heartrending lament this last time.

[CHORUS]
