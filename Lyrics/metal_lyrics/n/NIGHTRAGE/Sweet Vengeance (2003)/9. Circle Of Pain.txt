I thought you were my friend, I was trying to find myself,
in pieces so lonely and desperate.

You hurt me, I'm a fool and now I understand,
dark person punished my soul so bad.

You can't hurt me no more, you'll never understand,
don't look at me, I pay for my mistakes.

[PRE-CHORUS:]
Liar, Hypocrite, Evil, Self Destructive, So full of Jealousy.
Don't invade my dreams, just walk away.

[CHORUS:]
In this eerie night I will fly. I will dance in the circle of pain,
walking in this unknown empty land,
so confused for what's wrong or right.

Searching for my inner power.

[1st LEAD - Gus]
[HARMONY - Marios]

[CHORUS]

I thought you were my friend, in pieces so lonely and desperate,
and now I understand, you punished my soul so bad.

You can't hurt me no more, you'll never understand,
don't look at me, I pay for my mistakes.

[PRE-CHORUS]
