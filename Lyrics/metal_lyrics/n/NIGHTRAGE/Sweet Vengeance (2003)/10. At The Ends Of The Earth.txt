Full of superficial words,
anxious to find the real essence of the human nature.

Love, hate, colours, feelings, bitterness, anger, disappointment,
a rainbow of words so alien for you.

You broke down in disgusting pleasures.

[PRE-CHORUS:]
Compressing dreams you destroy to save your own insecurities,
drifting and drowned in a sea of lies.

You think that you got it all,
but you need to protect your fucking ego.

Misery, hate is the only way, life is a big game,
stop to be blind lost inside dreamlike illusions,
you have to watch for the light,
giving hope, so far away from lies.

[PRE-CHORUS]

[CHORUS:]
At the ends of the earth I don't want to be drowned,
through the emptiness of non-existence.

At the ends of the earth the seas of eternal silence,
invocations of the testimony of the cursed Gods.
