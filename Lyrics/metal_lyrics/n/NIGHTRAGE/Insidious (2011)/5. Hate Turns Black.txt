The approach of the things we have forgotten
An episode of a lasting light
Manipulate the same old strings, overcome these delusions
In contempt of the facts brought before us

Another spy comes to justify their lies
Will we make it while their hate turns black?
Fate of the unborn
No fight left in our lives
A noble minded injustice
Hate turns black

Trifling values
You gave the power to control
You saw the truth in their conduct
You saw their soul
Step into ignorance and leave your values at the door
Don't worry
Hate turns black

Scalding tears, all over my soul
The promises unfulfilled
These dreams are broke with a foul intake
A quiver ran through my past and it always comes back
Instability
A behavior that lies, full of misery
