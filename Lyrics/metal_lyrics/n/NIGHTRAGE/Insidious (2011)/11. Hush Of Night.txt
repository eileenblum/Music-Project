Imposition
Shattered principles
Enlightenment
With every fateful decision

You turned a blind eye
On the verge of truth
All that i love turns to dust

So empty
So cold
So far from the light in our hearts
My enquiry of life
In the hush of night

Hear the hush of life
Enthroned
Stop dancing in the horror of your past

Crawling through life's path
Are your sins in control?

At the end of the storm
I hear echoes from the night
They hum their tune of pain

Hold your pride and sorrow
Don't let this sadness go
