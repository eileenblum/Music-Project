If you could live forever what would you live for?
A damned aversion of a black soul
Or an everlasting love?
For this lonesome voyage

Remembering this is not a sham
Remembering there is only pain
Remembering those sad lonely screams
And everything will soon fall in place

An everlasting love
The lessons we have attained
Remembrance of a dying world

I'm sending forth a wasted heart

Lust and madness make an abysmal soul
It you have chosen is what you have always said
The unappeased ardor

Remembering this is not a sham
Remembering there is only pain

Of eerie worship
With wailing in the night
And sensation without sight

I'm sending forth a wasted heart
