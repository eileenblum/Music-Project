Ending all this pain fired up our hearts
The dark matter of life
A journey of blank images
Lost in the mists of time

Nothing in your words
We're half a world away
Blemished and heartlessly left in vain
Feeling dead and stigmata bound

Believe in your heart
See the truth before your eyes
Feel what i feel
Deny the living
Show me the truth at the utmost end of pain

The decomposing pain
The course you have chosen to engage
The dejection you have found
The evil you have felt

Dark lullabies of your destiny
The beauty of my freedom
Painless executions lay in ruin
The things you have taught me

Is it worth it to be yourself?
Raindrops of lost themes
A burning desire and one triumph of passion

Believe in your heart
See the truth right before your eyes
Feel what i feel
At the utmost end of pain
