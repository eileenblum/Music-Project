A slight mist overhung my dark thoughts
It gave me the things i have lost

Maybe it's too late for me
Embers of my dying pain

Wallow in this dream state of mind
Forgiveness; as the earth begins to tremble
I won't follow nor be deterred
From these poignant memories

Breaking the circle
Finding the truth behind my words
Breaking the circle
Divided from what i've been through

My eyes are full of blood and anger
And furious courage
One real inner power
The things that i have never felt

Hush of night

Imposition
Shattered principles
Enlightenment
With every fateful decision

You turned a blind eye
On the verge of truth
All that i love turns to dust

So empty
So cold
So far from the light in our hearts
My enquiry of life
In the hush of night

Hear the hush of life
Enthroned
Stop dancing in the horror of your past

Crawling through life's path
Are your sins in control?

At the end of the storm
I hear echoes from the night
They hum their tune of pain

Hold your pride and sorrow
Don't let this sadness go
