You turned me into a monster
This was a long and winding road
Hungry for glory and fame
I feel the wolf inside begin to grow

Begin to grow
Now you're the prey found laying in the
In the dead snow
Disgusted to experience this pain

Fell under the stabs of affliction
As the silver blade sunk in
I found myself covered in wolf skin

All your hopes crumple to dust
All your testimonies fail to succeed
The glory of equanimity
Now you see your skin begin to show

Begin to show
Now you're the wolf killing just to glow

The hideous aspects of ego
You see yourself cloaked in wolf skin!

Fell under the stabs of affliction
Affliction!
As the silver blade sunk in
Like sin!
I found myself covered in wolf skin
