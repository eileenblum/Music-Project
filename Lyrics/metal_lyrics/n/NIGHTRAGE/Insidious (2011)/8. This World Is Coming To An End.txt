Just accept and follow
The truth lies within your hands
This transcript is misleading
Offer yourself now a dying man

An underground sense of fear
With blind control upon us
We have to fight and welcome this ray of light

To make light of the innocent
Symbolic and seething
To make light of the innocent

Endeavors from this cruel existence
With unperceptive hate
Walking through a secret passage
What have we found?

This world is coming to an end
This world is going to die
We are all responsible

A new beginning
The dawn of an era new
All that we've ever dreamed for

This world is coming to an end
This world is going to die
We are all responsible
