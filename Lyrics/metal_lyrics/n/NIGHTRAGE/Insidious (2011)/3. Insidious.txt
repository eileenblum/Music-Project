Indescribable pain with the healing obtained
Can you spite this hate out for me?
Reliving the last unforgettable past
Please abort this hatred out of me
The evil in your eyes

Never again will you shove your thoughts down my throat
A bloody mind using lies
One day you will pay
Insidious
This was your life story
Insidious

I saw it with my own eyes
Deep down you knew the truth
Burn everything down
You knew the truth
Take the past and fix all the new
A need for redemption

A jaunty air
Born to be a loser
You have done this to yourself
A jaunty air
Made so unfair
Since i saw you
Convince the untrue
No one thought it would ever come to this
