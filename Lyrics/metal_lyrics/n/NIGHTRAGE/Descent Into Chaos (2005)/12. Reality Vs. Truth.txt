Ideas and visions cursed. In the dust of sorrow lost.
Old memories and dark recollections from the silent past.
When wilderness weights heavily on the world. A faint light flickers in the distance.
A decree of fate this empty presence burned into sins. Silent massas.
Curses showered down.
All hope is lost. The scorching truth burning bright. The enemy within the ever growing fear.
A silent wasteland all cold inside.

[Chorus:]
The recurrence of the same mistake. The misery the dirty lies.
A decree of fate this empty presence.
Burned into sins. Silent masses.
Ideas and visions cursed.
In the dust of sorrow lost.
Old memories and dark recollections from the silent past.

[Chorus]
