Oh faithfull ones we are lost again.
In this violent sea of entrapping lies.
We are gathered here as long ago.
Others like we in search of clarity.
The mighty gifts they blind us with.
Reaching in and stealing our only dream.
That dream of freedom found dead its cradle at dawn.

[Chorus:]
By fear plagued since birth.
Will i ever find release?
I walk a barren earth.
In search of sanctuary.
Truth as medicine for a poison heart.
Take what is left of me while the gods do sleep.
This emptiness.
This solitude.
This darkened heart.
It will be your doom.
Someday my fears they will grow.
They will outgrow us both.
And now the demons are back again howling, scratching, tearing at a tortured soul.

[Chorus]

As night falls like a curtain.
A cry is heard through the roaring darkness.
My soul left as a prey for these angelic yet deceitful vultures.

[Chorus]
