Perished are all doubts. Perished are all fears.
Perished into nothingness. I found that nothing dies.
Stop to reflect. Stop to resist. Might as well stop breathing.
And cease to exist.

[Chorus:]
You will never get to me. I see things you cannot see.
And i will never be, part of your righteous dream.

Let the winds how. Let the sails fly. Victorious i will rise.
Now watch your deceit fail. And my vengeance rise.
Jubilant my deafening soaring cry.
You spawned the darkness. Planted deep within.
I can see beyond the veils of all your evil schemes.
My world painted black. Stare with empty eyes.
At the ruins you left behind. Of what once was my life.

[Chorus]

You... you turned your back... you... you starved my dreams. You, a ghost, a memory.
You... you turned your back... you... you starved my dreams. You, a ghost, a memory.

Perished are all doubts. Perished are all fears.
Perished into nothingness. I found that nothing dies.
Stop to reflect. Stop to resist. Might as well stop breathing.
And cease to exist.

[Chorus]
