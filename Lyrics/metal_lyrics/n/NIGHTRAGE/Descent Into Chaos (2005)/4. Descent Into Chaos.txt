Revenge will strike hard without any mercy.
Invoking dark clouds to cover silent lives.
In ancient sermons by man long abolished.
You and I find comfort once again.
A lesson learned too late.
Waiting to seal our fate.
You drive the poison,
Into the wounds of my heart.

[Chorus:]
As we descent into chaos. Through the pain of a thousand lifetimes.
What have we learned?

You drive the poison,
Into the wounds of my heart.
In blind conformity I praise you my opiate.
Detached from all that is real.
Ravenous from the lies that you've fed me.
I hail thee mother of all enchanted nights.
A lesson learned too late.
Waiting to seal our fate.

[Chorus]
