Empty dreams.
Vacuous life.
Where in lies the truth?
Where is the world that we have dreamed of?
A well constructed wisdom.
Stormy thoughts.
Spirited obstinacy. And the moon was obscured by the clouds.
A vicious circle. A smouldering fire.
Far away from the hopes of the soul.

Deserted paths mysterious murky scenery.
Humming in the silence of the night, my soul's inner light.
Lie down with fortitude.
At every little howl of the endless without rhyme of reason fervour.

[Chorus:]
The silent solitude of the hysterical smothered tears,
Collapsed and bleeding emblems of the blidder sin.
Where is the world where i was looking for? The world they promised me?
Where is the world where i was looking for? The world they promised me?
The silent solitude.
Where is the world that we dreamed of? The silent solitude.

The sirens of madness. Listening silently at the constructive aura this world is so cold.
Poisonous deadly pleasures and tearful past.
How long will it take? How long will it take? The silent solitude.
Where is the world that we have dreamed of? The silent solitude.
