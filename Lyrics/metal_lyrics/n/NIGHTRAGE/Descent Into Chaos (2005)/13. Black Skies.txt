[Japanese bonus track]

Crawling across the sea of time
Fear and pain it's all I feel
Exorcise the dark shadows that haunting me
Asking for questions that cannot be answered
Searching for the truth
The truth in me
Beneath the ancient wisdom
The legacy of pain guide you
To eternal atonement
Of heart and soul

I have sinned with an innocent soul
The black raven is trying to steal your thoughts

I must cross this road
Full of monsters and wolves
And then I will know
Nothing is easy
I'm waiting all my is this the right way?
As the years passed by your kingdom of madness

Grows all the time they think that you will loose
