All our mysteries remain unsolved. Now when my blindfold is cast.
No judgement cast upon them.
They who broke their vows that i trusted in and all that i saw of their eyes.
Was the dead stare behind their masks.
A new desease is born.
Uncurable and scorned. Watch as their smiles go black.
Stabbed in the back.
Oh, the solitude and the days of pain.
I'm awake through the nightmares of life.
And your thoughts never travel to them.
Them you stepped upon to reach your place.
And all that i saw of my dream.
Was the laughter behind my back.

[Chorus:]
And now the waves they clash.
Upon those distant shores.
Their mesmerizing sound.
Fills the air I breathe.
Awake through ages.
Of a life of shallow tears.
I take flight, aiming for the land that knows no fear.

Dark is the night of the loneliest journey.
Down paths forsaken and rarely tread.
No light to guide these steps to freedom.
All hope would be lost if I stopped believing.

Our mysteries remain unsolved. Now when my blindfold is cast.
No judgement cast upon them.
They who broke their vows that i trusted in and all that i saw of their eyes.
Was the dead stare behind their masks.
A new desease is born.
Uncurable and scorned. Watch as their smiles go black.
Stabbed in the back.

[Chorus]
