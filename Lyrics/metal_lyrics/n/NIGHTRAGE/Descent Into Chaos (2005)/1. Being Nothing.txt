Bring on the darkness.
The mutiny... strike down upon the insanity!
Silent wastelands our homes to be...
Condemned to harvest our broken dreams (broken dream)
I am the fear within your hearts.
Flags of War drenched in guilt.
The desperation I leave will shake.
The Foundations of the hell you have built.
Alone in your dream your phantasy.
Fevered and drunk from your prophet tears...
When will you reach clarity?
Your thirst your only weakness, your desease.

[Chorus:]
Side by Side, Being Nothing. All dead inside. Being Nothing.
Side by Side, Being Nothing. All dead inside. Being Nothing.

And like A leper I walk through your dead world.
And like a break of light. Strike down upon your herd.
I am the fear within your hearts. Flags Of War drenched in guilt.
The Desperation I leave will shake.
The foundations of the hell you have built.

[Chorus]
