Every day, every hour, every moment.
Why don't you say something?
The surface politeness, these are the faults that can't be remedied.
Is it joy or sorrow?
Human beings are made to destroy eachother.

[Chorus:]
You believed in those people.
You never understood.
You believed in those people.
Bad omen.

You believed in those people.
You never understood.
You believed in those people.
Bad omen.

Freindship a word that looks like a lie.
Destroyed distant relations. His spirit never broke.
One little sweet human action.

[Chorus]
