This hunger that lures inside
It can never be ignored
Unfailing bloodlust
We blame our acts on gods
As we wash our hands
Far south of our heavens

The blood
That colors our path
Will never ever be enough
The blood
That runs through our veins
Will drive us in the search for more

A thirst that within us resides
Will lead us towards our downfall
This hunger for flesh cannot be stopped
A ghost that feeds upon our own extinction

It taints our lives
Destined forever
To thirst for blood
A heritage we can't ignore

The blood
That colors our path
Will never ever be enough
The blood
That runs through our veins
Will drive us in the search for more

The blood
That colors our path
Will never ever be enough

It runs through our veins
Never to be enough

It taints our lives
Destined forever
To thirst for blood
A heritage we can't ignore

The blood
That colors our path
Will never be enough
The blood
That runs through our veins
Will drive us in the search for more

The blood (the blood)
It taints our lives

The blood (the blood)
A heritage we can't ignore
