The screams of the undead
Is cutting through the air
As light abandons us
We can touch the fear
The path we left behind
We will never walk again
As we embrace the darkness
We know that this is the end

This is the end
On this day of wrath

We walk into the darkness
Leaving no regrets
Our souls are lingering
As we are possessed
A soulless carnal vessel
With powers from beyond
Human emotions forever
Free from its rotting bond

A surge of power that you never felt before
A hunger for the dark that you can't ignore

Dies irae
Dies illa
This is the day of wrath
Dies irae
Dies illa
Leave all your hope behind

A destiny
To wreck the walls of life
In tyranny
We've been held back for far too long

This is the end
On this day of wrath

A soulless carnal vessel
With powers from beyond
Human emotions forever
Free from its rotting bond
The path we left behind
We will never walk again
As we embrace the darkness
We know that this is the end

A destiny
To wreck the walls of life
In tyranny
We've been held back for far too long

Dies irae
Dies illa
This is the day of wrath
Dies irae
Dies illa
Leave all your hope behind

Dies irae
This is the day of wrath
Dies irae
Dies illa
Leave all your hope behind
