As our lives are forged in battle
We're in search for an answer
All innocence since long we lost
Now! As we're dragged along the undertow

Reflections
Of all our past mistakes 
Domination
The glory of our prime 

Can't you see my empty shell forlorn? 
Reflecting an empty past
Blackening inside of my Affliction
As we sow now we shall reap 

On our path we march as cattle
In search for a meaning 
Our destination in clouds concealed 
Still claiming to be in control

Reflections
Of all our past mistakes 
Domination
The glory of our prime 

Can't you see my empty shell forlorn? 
Reflecting an empty past
Blackening inside of my Affliction
As we sow now we shall reap 

Can't you see my empty shell forlorn? 
Blackening inside of my Affliction
