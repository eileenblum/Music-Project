Our destiny to stand apart 
Firmly written in stone from the start
A demonic wish we could never resist 
Deeply rooted inside of our hearts
Black angel wings and a vipers tail
Still a smile that we could not resist
A deeper sense of sanity
Since the first day ceased to exist

We are the only cure
To the poison we spit
Time to wipe away
All that we became

Breed the Venomous 
We thrive, under the spell of Marchosias
Our goddess of conflict and war

Our journey on the face of this earth
Has now forever left its mark
An endless search for more
Drove us straight into the dark

We are the only cure
To the poison we spit
Time to wipe away
All that we became

Breed the Venomous 
We thrive, under the spell of Marchosias
Our goddess of conflict and war

All hail the Venomous
We dance to the beat of the glorious
Hear our gospel of conflict and war
