As our world is trembling
We're destined to self-destruct
As the structures of life
Rupture and collapse
Nothing more than rubble at our feet
As our souls on this last day collide
No one left to remember
Our trail so vile

Disdain the lies
Eliminate these feeble ways
A trail of ghosts from the past
Left as dead leaves to decay

We're destined to burn
As we are embracing oblivion
We march towards our end
As we are embracing oblivion

Now our castles are burning
And the last tear is shed
As the fruits of our life
Has fallen to the ground
Just lying there
Rotting on our streets

Disdain the lies
Eliminate these feeble ways
A trail of ghosts from the past
Left as dead leaves to decay

We're destined to burn
As we are embracing oblivion
We march towards our end
As we are embracing oblivion

As the fruits of our life
Has fallen to the ground
Just lying there
Rotting on our streets
As our souls
On this last day collide
No one left to remember
Our trail so vile

Disdain the lies
Eliminate these feeble ways
A trail of ghosts from the past
Left as dead leaves to decay
