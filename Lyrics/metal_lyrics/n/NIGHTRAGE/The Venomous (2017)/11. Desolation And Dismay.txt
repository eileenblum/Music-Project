Along these roads
That we have paved with misery
Degradation of our human soul
A pestilence of our mind
Illustrious pleasures
While being at the end of our rope
Searching for a glimpse of glory
To the cost of all our hope

Preaching the lie
Till the end of the line
Fend for your dreams
Without them you wither and die

Dehumanize all what you fear
Just trying to survive
Destroy what all the others built
Conform to another lie

Preaching the lie
Till the end of the line
Fend for your dreams
Without them you wither and die

Endless purging in fossil dreams
Just wanting to get away
The only way of being free
In desolation and dismay
Defend your dreams
Keep all others at bay
The only way of being free
In desolation and dismay

Preaching the lie
Till the end of the line
Fend for your dreams
Without them you wither and die

Try to wash the guilt away
By shifting all the blame
Worn out and torn empty phrases
Won't hide the shame

Endless purging in fossil dreams
Just wanting to get away
The only way of being free
In desolation and dismay
Defend your dreams
Keep all others at bay
The only way of being free
In desolation and dismay

Defend your dreams
Keep all others at bay
In desolation and dismay
