Too many words unspoken
So many thoughts untouched
Fed up with being broken
Can't stand another lie
All the goals that I set for myself
All the ones that I shot to the ground
All the things that I wanted to feel
All the feelings I feared to be real

Feel the cleansing rain
A soul so scarred, trying to rid the pain
Wash away the stain
This purgatory of my heart

Another promise broken
Another fish unhooked
Words out of fury spoken
Wishing for someone to die
All the words that I kept as the truth
All these lies that been keeping me be back
All the things that we thought to be real
All too real to be able to feel

As a cleansing flood would wash away all shame
Black acid rainfall will do the same
A catharsis to clean these wounds
Black acid rainfall to end it all

A constant mind intrusion
None of your thoughts untouched
One million grand illusions
Another million to come
All the things you were set to believe
All the words that you took as the truth
All the things that you wanted to feel
All the feelings you feared for far too long

Feel the cleansing rain
A soul so scarred, trying to rid the pain
Wash away the stain
This purgatory of my heart

As a cleansing flood would wash away all shame
Black acid rainfall will do the same
A catharsis to clean these wounds
Black acid rainfall to end it all

Since the ancient days
This plague has ruled the earth
Unchallenged domination
A cancer to this world
Now in purgatory
The cleansing will commence
This catharsis
To end it all

Black acid rainfall to end it all

As a cleansing flood would wash away all shame
Black acid rainfall will do the same
A catharsis to clean these wounds
Black acid rainfall to end it all
