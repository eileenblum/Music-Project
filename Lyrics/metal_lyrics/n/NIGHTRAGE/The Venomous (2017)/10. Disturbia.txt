You live in denial
Decieved by your fears
You've perfected the lie
Just to hide the tears
You sacrifice pleasure
To run from the pain
You think it's weak to cry
So you hide in the rain

The serpents of lies
Will rise as our senses collide

These lies you treasure
You nurse them in vain
It's your last mistake
You have nothing to gain

The serpents of lies
Will rise as our senses collide

Dystopia!
Where are we now?
Since birth
We all have been led astray
Disturbia!
Our end has been foreseen
The dawn of tomorrow
The start of our decay

At the end of this ride
We're checking out
Leaving all our pride

Dystopia!
Where are we now?
Since birth
We all have been led astray
Disturbia!
Our end has been foreseen
The dawn of tomorrow
The start of our decay
