The true intentions of all
Acts ever performed
All essence of our being
In its purest form
Since the cradle of existence
We rose above the sun
Scorching the earth we walk
In the name of "the one"

A falling sky
Can't hold the weight we apply
The end of the line
In abhorrence
We're waiting to die

The source of all malicious
Acts born out of the abnorm
A scent of foul decay
That follows through the storm
At the brink of our extinction
We flourish at our best
We reek of decomposition
As we're laid to rest

A falling sky
Can't hold the weight we apply
The end of the line
In abhorrence
We're waiting to die

The true intentions of all
Acts ever performed
All essence of our being
In its purest form
The source of all malicious
Acts born out of the abnorm
A scent of foul decay
That follows through the storm

A falling sky
Can't hold the weight we apply
The end of the line
In abhorrence
We're waiting to die
