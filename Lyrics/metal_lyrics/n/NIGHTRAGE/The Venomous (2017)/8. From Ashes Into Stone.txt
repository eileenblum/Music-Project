My broken bones
They heal to grow stronger
From ashes I rise to remain
All those tears, I shed them no longer
A heart forged in stone
Oblivious to pain

Rise up from the ground
Use the anger
Mark the spot with the stains of my blood
All these years
I don't need them no longer
All I want is cold vengeance on your god

From ashes into stone
This is what I learned
Vengeance to the bone
It is what you earned

My broken bones
They heal to grow stronger
From ashes I rise to remain
All those tears, I shed them no longer
A heart forged in stone
Oblivious to pain

As my essence from the ashes arise
Rise!
Slowly
I'm turning to stone

Rise up from the ground
Use the anger
Mark the spot with the stains of my blood
All these years
I don't need them no longer
All I want is cold vengeance on your god

From ashes into stone
This is what I learned
Vengeance to the bone
It is what you earned

As my essence from the ashes arise
Rise!
Slowly
I'm turning stone

From ashes into stone
This is what I learned
Vengeance to the bone
It is what you earned
