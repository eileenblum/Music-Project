[Music: Iliopoulos/MÃ¶rck, Lyrics: Iliopoulos/HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen]

Never turned like the slime that I always knew you were
Can't stand this life my soul lay in a pool of blood
Egocentric high ideals and rotten ways

Hatred, heartache
A few of my modes
Hatred, heartache
More than you will ever believe

Dominate, recriminate
Your slave infected role
Time after time I stare into vacancy

Deteriorate, investigate
What drives you to goal?
Lie after lie is my only reality

A solitary spot
A soul lost
Shed the blood of my inner fears

Searching into the silent beauty of a nightmare
Near empty cold lines and tribulations

SHED THE BLOOD

[1st solo: Olof]
[2nd solo/harmony: Marios]

As passion slips by your side, once again I SHED THE BLOOD!
