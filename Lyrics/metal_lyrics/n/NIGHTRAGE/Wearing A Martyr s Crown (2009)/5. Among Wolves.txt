Here is the truth that's lying
Deep within your grasp
My heart was blinded
To the facts you resurrect
Withered and unforgotten
This treachery at hand
Welcome to my world
Wit tears that turn to sand

An attribute to the strength I never had
Ashamed to look towards you as a friend
My time is pain; some questions never asked
Do you feel my sorrow?
Let's play your little game!

(Lose to regain)
This knowledge made in vein
(I will abstain)
This path to true arcane
(Renounce success)
A portion never told
(Denounce assist)
A tortured dying soul

Pride and trust is a luxury I have
Wallow in your lust we'll see how long it lasts
Pulling out your mind
Behold the jackal's nest
Travelling the poison seems to have effect

All misery, and the hypocritical role
Are these their best ingredients?

Your time will cease to exist
Crowned and torn
Life will make you a slave
We are Among Wolves!
