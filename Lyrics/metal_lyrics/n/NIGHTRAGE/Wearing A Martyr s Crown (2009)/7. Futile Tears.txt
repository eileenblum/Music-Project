I'm sick of this fight
I'm sick of these lies
Entering into solitude

Thorns rising up
Deleterious effect
Enter into futility

Of all we fear, of all we've done. Of all we've seen
Is that wrong message?

We cannot find a meaning
In this endless search

These futile tears are all I have in a time of nee
These futile tears are what cloud my eyes
I'm sick of this fight
I'm sick of these lies
Entering into solitude
These futile tears are what cloud my eyes

It's like a sickness burning deep inside
It's like the flood
It's like the tide
It's like infinity
It's like a door that never shuts
It's like the flood that rises up

Everything I have left (battle-scarred)
This blind hatred growing strong in my veins

These reasons I find
A self motivation to never back down
So leave it behind
And open the doorway to keep you alive

Incomprehensible ideas
Emotions of terror
A redeemer of pain
Damaging my entire soul

These futile tears are all I have in a time of need
Surrounded by this eerie atmosphere
I'm sick of this fight
I'm sick of these lies
Entering into solitude
These futile tears are what cloud my eyes

These futile tears are all I have in a time of need
These futile tears are what cloud my eyes
