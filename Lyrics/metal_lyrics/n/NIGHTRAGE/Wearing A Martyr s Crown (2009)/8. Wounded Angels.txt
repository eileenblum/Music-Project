Fatally I sleep with your sins
And truthfully I lay in your hate
A long version we had
A painful path of dark shadows

Blind obedience; if only they knew
What was coming?

An ancient mystery of prime honor
My actions so bright, the darkness I'll fight
I am the true king

Wounded angels arise from pain
Wipe the tears from your eyes
Wounded theories and waves of shame
Keep the spirit alive

Light the unknown
For those who will fall
A way to salvation
Close all the doors
For no one will call
The name of temptation

Favoring the truth
For all eternity they will be remembered
