This grim reality casts a gloom in our hearts
A grim struggle
The night of death
The day that life was cold
Pleading in the moonlight

In the fullness of time we live and learn
And we die soulless

This is not a dream
This is only reality
By and by you hear my words
You can't deny morality

(Hold on) Hold on to your dreams
Please don't let go
Of life's distress
(Hold on) Hold on to your dreams
It makes you feel more alive

Inspired by a past of pain
The only sense I have to make me alive

Life is hitting so hard,
Without a true meaning
This is my only shallow heart

Hold on
Please don't let go
Of life's distress
Hold on
It makes you feel more alive
