Lost and cold in our dark cave
Alas the reaper of loneliness
Something was way out there
Like a solitary tree

In the garden of dead landmarks
I don't want to die alone

I saw a star of incredible friendship
One way that allways shines
Through the hardship of the soul
To be hidden like a wintry smile

I don't want to die alone
In a world created for fools

Is there any end?
Is there any choice?
Is there just false hope?
Goodbye cruel world

You're mocking my modesty
A negative feeling
Made from a false birth
The road of deceptive words

You're mocking my modesty
Goodbye cruel world
