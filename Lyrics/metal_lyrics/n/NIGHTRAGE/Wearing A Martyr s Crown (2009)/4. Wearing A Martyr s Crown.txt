[Music: Iliopoulos/MÃ¶rck, Lyrics: Iliopoulos/HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen]

The crown of emptiness,
As night descended slowly
Maybe it's an illusion,
One fake dream, one grey plastic
Reality of tears and of repentance.
I felt my life crossing like
A stream of sadness

Wearing a martyr's crown
The crown of sadness
The crown of emptiness
Mortified by his rudeness

Souls sunk in despair
Futile actions the enemy of life.
Like an ego
That's trying to rip
Your heart out
I felt the fear for what I saw;
Trying to save something
This incredible heap of mistakes,
Stigmatized my soul

Wearing a martyr's crown
The crown of sadness
The crown of emptiness
Mortified by his rudeness
I felt the plainness and all
The errors, of this tragic truth
Wearing a martyr's crown

I felt the waves of sadness
Breaking my heart
I felt the fear of what I saw
I held my head up high
Wearing a martyr's crown
This crown

[1st solo: Marios]
[2nd solo: Olof]

I felt the waves of sadness
Breaking my heart
I held my head up high
Wearing a martyr's crown
