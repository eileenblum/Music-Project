[Music: Iliopoulos/MÃ¶rck, Lyrics: Iliopoulos/HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen]

Alas is it true or a dream?
Magic or reality?
Treacherous currents
I couldn't believe my eyes
Belated honesty is what they served
Abandon!

A vicious cycle, poisonous face,
And values lost in agony
Mendacious statements
Promises from angelic figures

I wish to turn back, to see things more clear
All this time and all these thoughts
Naked fear and arrogance
Was it all that I saw?

Abandon your heart
Abandon your pain
Abandon your life
We live and learn while the sun
Goes down. Abandon thee, for all time
The brand of your kind
To stand for all life

Listen to me
Show me your face
Fearful, soul-destroying act,
An absolute conceited creature
This was all that I saw
