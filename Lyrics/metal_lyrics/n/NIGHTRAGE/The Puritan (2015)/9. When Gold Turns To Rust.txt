We have always followed, all these unwritten rules 
A betrayal of our agonized existence 
Always pigeonholed, ignored and put aside 
Abysmal endless torture, a blackened putrid tide

We became our own enemy 
With no one else to trust 
We're at the twilight of our legacy 
When gold turns to rust

In sacred violent bloodshed
We lost what we once loved 
In the shadow of the grotesque
In the prayers of the dead

We became our own enemy 
With no one else to trust 
We're at the twilight of our legacy 
When gold turns to rust

We lost the grip on our destiny
All winnings turn to loss 
We'll he forgotten in eternity 
When gold turns to rust

There's no way to avoid it
The end has been foreseen 
We are piloting our downfall
We're crashing this machine

When gold turns to rust
