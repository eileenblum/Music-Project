Puritan looking back
All these dark recollections
The old times
The pain and desperate
Remedies
Your soul's inner fears

Clashing with madness
And all the terror
This is the life
That I have chosen

Like a pure sin
It's time for a change
This drug of a black thought
Between the demons and the rage within a light
The path to redemption

You will all see the light
That blinds at the path of redemption
Can you make the sacrifices needed to walk that way?
You will all see the light
That blinds at the path of redemption
There will be no turning back
If you stop and walk away

Clashing with madness
And all the terror
This is the life
Brought upon me
Puritan
The path of the righteous
Path of the pure
Blinded by lightning
You're back for more

Like a pure sin
It's time for a change
This drug of a black thought
Between the demons and the rage within a light
The path to redemption

You will all see the light
That blinds at the path of redemption
Can you make the sacrifices needed to walk that way?
You will all see the light
You will all find the path of redemption
There will be no turning back
If you stop and walk away

You will all see the light
That blinds at the path of redemption
Can you make the sacrifices needed to walk that way?
