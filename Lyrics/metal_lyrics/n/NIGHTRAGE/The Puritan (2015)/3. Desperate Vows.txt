As this life is passing by
Recollecting all the dark times
A slanderous touch
A voice from the past
These forgotten vows of mine
Comes to life again

I wandered this void too long
Re-design my life
I can't dwell in the dark no more

Desperate vows
I lost the faith that I had
Dark recollections rule my mind
Desperate vows
To claim what once was mine
Like a new found light
For tired eyes gone blind

Looking towards the end of the road
All lies left behind
Re-direct my goals
I wandered this void too long
Re-design my life
I can't dwell in the dark no more

Desperate vows
I lost the faith that I had
Dark recollections rule my mind
Desperate vows
To claim what once was mine
Like a new found light
For tired eyes gone blind

[Solo]

Desperate vows
I lost the faith that I had
Dark recollections rule my mind
Desperate vows
To claim what once was mine
Like a new found light
For tired eyes gone blind
