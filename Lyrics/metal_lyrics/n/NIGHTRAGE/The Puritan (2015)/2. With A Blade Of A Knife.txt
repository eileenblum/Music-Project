A tragedy wedged 
Into an innocent mind 
Trying to find the answer 
Why they all stood blind 
With surgical precision 
They abort all hope 
In lack of intervention 
They hand you the rope

Underneath the surface of pale unspoiled skin 
Dwells the human waste deep within

Under the impression of living a life 
Searching for an answer with the blade of a knife

Repressed memories 
Of a life you should know 
Buried with your ruined soul 
Burnt not king ago 
This mental incision 
Infected by their filth 
With maculate intentions 
They violate, what you have built
