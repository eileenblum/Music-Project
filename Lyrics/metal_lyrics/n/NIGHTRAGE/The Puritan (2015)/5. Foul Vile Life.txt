Through ages, of endless battle
Intrinsic pale pages, of my dark life
Nobody could ever imagine
How I feel inside
This terror of my conscience
Makes me crumble and die

I wanna escape this reality
Full of fake images
Dreaming, through this agony
Break away from this fear

I will never change it seems, endless and black
It's like a dream within a dream, I'm lost and way off track

Foul benighted and false
Vile holy vows
Life and death swallowed

Foul benighted and false
Vile holy vows
Don't wanna listen to these lies no more

I wanna escape this reality
Full of fake images
Dreaming, through this agony
Break away from this fear

Nobody could ever imagine, how I feel inside
It's like a dream within a dream, I crumble and die

Foul vile and life
and death you swallowed
