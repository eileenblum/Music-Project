In the heart of a sycophant

In the shade of our forgotten past 
When the truth is nothing but a lie
Self -deluded, believing that we will last 
Overconfident that we will never die

A chaotic co-existence so vast 
A poisonous breath from your lungs, a lie 
This far from the truth nothing win last 
Overrun by the reality, you defy

This amorphous, meaningless motion
A kiss of a Sycophant

This orifice, dried out ocean
The heart of a Sycophant

This amorphous
A kiss of a Sycophant

This dried out ocean
The heart of a Sycophant
