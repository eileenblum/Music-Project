The fathomless
Uncontrolled dimensions
Of corrupt behaviour
In your realm there is no truth left
No truth to guide the light
No reasons
To conceal your deception
Like a plague on this earth

Turn your back, waiting for the worst to happen 
Your actions, your treachery, feeding this plague

Fathomless unremedied
You think you are above us all
Fathomless this pain in me

Fathomless unremedied
Waiting for the world to burn
Fathomless this pain in me
Fathomless unremedied plague of this world

A nauseating decomposing convulsion 
Of delusions of grandeur
In your heart dwells nothing but lies
That drowns the light in darkness
To conceal your true purpose
As the plague of this earth

Turn your back, waiting for the world to burn 
Your actions, your treachery, feeding this plague 

Fathomless unremedied
You think you are above us all 
Fathomless this pain in me

Fathomless unremedied 
Waiting for this world to burn 
Fathomless this pain in me

Fathomless unremedied 
Plague of this world
