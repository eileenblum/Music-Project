Severely violated in motion out of control
Regretting actions, you can't recall
Unwanted insertion, of guilt not yours
If the dreams don't stop, you'll end them by force

Demeaning the purpose of life, refusing tomorrow
Not part of this game, still you're cheating
This bitter past is all you got, to guide you through life
Thoughts of distant future, so meaningless to you

Son of sorrow, damaged life
Lost the path that leads to light
No tomorrow, no end in sight

Son of sorrow, damaged life
Lost the path that leads to light
No tomorrow, no end in sight.
Torn apart and left to die

Severely violated, in life refusing tomorrow
Still part of a game, you can't recall
Bitter past is all you got, and guilt not yours
You turn your back on the future, without remorse

Son of sorrow, damaged life
Lost the path that leads to light

No tomorrow, no end in sight
You're left for dead

Son of sorrow, damaged life
Lost the path that leads to light

No tomorrow, no end in sight
Torn apart and left to die
