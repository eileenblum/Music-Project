When the truth is revealed, when emotions are
Frozen, a sky suffused with darkness.
Eyes swimming in tears, a deadly sense of reality.

The restless cycle of life.
Returning from an empty past.
All that I lived through passions and views bury
The hatchet, it there any true (meaning on this life?)

Falsification of the human touch, waves breaking
with a roar. Falsification of the human touch,
sickly pallor, formless mass. His scathing character.

Walking by this dark river rising up from the
Dirty lies. All that I have lived, everything that I
Care, you become stronger with positive thoughts.

Fulfilling the dream
His life was embittered
Is there any true meaning on this life?
Embittered
Fulfilling the dream
This empty reality
(His life was embittered) By his actions.
A so-called friend.
Scathing.
