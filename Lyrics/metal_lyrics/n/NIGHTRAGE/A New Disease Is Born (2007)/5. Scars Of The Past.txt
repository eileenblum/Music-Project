All my life I've been walking
In the shade of your dark world
Blinded by fears of this frail world
You've created. My mind my senses
Are totally numb. Falling deeper
Into your reality. A never-ending pain
is pounding my head from the inside.

In your arms
I fall into knifes
In your life
I'll breath
All your lies

Am I all that you got?
I reach out my hand
But every time you just
Push me away

These memories hurt me all time.
Now I'm left with scars in my mind.
With scars in my mind.
