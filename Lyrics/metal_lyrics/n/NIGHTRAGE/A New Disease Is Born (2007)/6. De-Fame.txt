All I knew all I realize
A scornful look,
That seemed like respect,
What I care
All the bad memories.
What I felt
Only the negative signs

All I realize
Was the bitter end
Never again sirens of madness

Separate falsehood, from the truth,
Seems so hard, to find the right answers.

Broken dreams,
Tears without a meaning, faces with false
Laughter. No place to hide, too cold inside...

Broken dreams,
Tears without a meaning, faces with false
Laughter. Defamer you were you will always be.
