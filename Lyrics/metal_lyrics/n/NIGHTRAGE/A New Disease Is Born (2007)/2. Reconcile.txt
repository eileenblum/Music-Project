Your ordinary life goes on.
These memories of what happened so many years
ago are long gone.
Laid too rest. Deep inside of you.

But the time is now. When the past
becomes your future.
I am all that you need.
You're second place to dirt.
I bring what you deserve.
Now you're first place too.

Reconcile. I am leaving no trace.
You will be forgotten.

Reconcile. My hate crime is shaping up.
This is my vengeance.

I am sucking your marrow out. Sucking you dry.
Walking so empty entered this chasm of mine
In this world for you.
I am sucking your marrow out. Sucking you dry.
Walking so empty like a casket without a corpse
I have been re-inventing this world for you.
