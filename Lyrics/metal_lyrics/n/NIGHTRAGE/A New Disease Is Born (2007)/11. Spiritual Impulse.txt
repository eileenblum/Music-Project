There is no way I can escape.
Barbwires around my wrist feet and neck.
Electric wires connected,
Within a caged inbreed
Penetrable for all and everything
On chemical ground I stand

On my dead wings I fly the sick earth,
The ground is piercing me when I walk it,
Parted from the soil, I'm parted from life itself.
Parted from you.

It makes me go insane
All my senses, numb
This hell surrounds me every day
It makes me go insane
All my senses, numb
Nothing can save me now.

So you really think that this is all over and gone?
So you really think that this is forgotten?

Selected. By spiritual impulse,
Selected by random design
This possessing reality has followed me
Within a caged inbreed
Penetrable for all and everything
On chemical ground I stand

It makes me go insane
All my senses are numb
Nothing can save me
