This is the real news.
Old animosities that have surfaced once again.
Virtues and faults of a hypocrite race.

Inmost recesses of the soul.
Thoughts those were whirling through my head.
Dead feelings of my dreamy world

Arising from this ancient land
Looking back at the beautiful
Thing that we have lost
Makes me scream.

Love, Compassion, Eternity, Freedom.
I gave my blood for this honour.
Love, Compassion, Eternity, Freedom.
Always believing that there is
something good in this world.
Death-like silence.

There's only one way to find out.
I need to give my hand and I will
Be flying away again before the end comes.
Everything is turning in my head.
The air is like a big pile of empty
Thoughts. I can smell the flowers of anger.

Love, Compassion, Eternity, Freedom.
I gave my blood for this honour.
Love, Compassion, Eternity, Freedom.
Always believing that there is
something good in this world.

Redemption of the immortals.
The innocence of the sinner's.
Always believing that there is
Something good in this world.
