Always I'm split in billions,
Always I hide,
Always I'm not so sure, That I would try to marry you,
If you were young,
But never believe me,
It's never me you're talking to, It's you who makes the wrong decisions.

Form almost anything, I've worked it out,
Now I understand so well, Just what it is that I am doing.

I sort of wish that I gave a fuck about all of you,
And I kind of wish that I gave a fuck about all of you,
But I don't.

You would forgive me, If you could understand,
But you never think, Just draw your own conclusions.

You were almost always right, But you think too much,
And this time you're just forming things. Forming things.
But I love, and I love, and I love.
