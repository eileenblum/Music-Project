Itâs hard to hear your voice again
Havenât heard you for a while
Itâs hard to see your face again
Havenât seen it for a while
All your things are spinning round
All your things are spinning now

Down by the trees where the rain comes falling
Is how her body hides
Down in the shade where the young girlâs crying
Is where here body lies
Down by the trees where the rain comes falling
Is how her body hides
Down in the shade where the young girlâs crying
Is where here body lies

Itâs now or never the voice says Itâs a long time down the line
Itâs a crystal ring Itâs a big decision Itâs not hard to find
The leaves are dead This place is stone A body moves Didnât move at all

Down by the trees where the rain comes falling
Is how her body hides
Down in the shade where the young girlâs crying
Is where here body lies
Down by the trees where the rain comes falling
Is how her body hides
Down in the shade where the young girlâs crying Is where here body lies
Spin
