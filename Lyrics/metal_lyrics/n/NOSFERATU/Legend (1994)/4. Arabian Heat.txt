Kneeling down to yellow flowers
Plastic tubes and sun
The wine was bitter,
we drank and grieved I cut your spitting tongue
Day gone dark,
a shining sea,
Let's torch this sky and bleeding city
Sand was cool, the ice sank ships and the breeze kissed lips like flies

But you're falling, away.

But she don't see the angels coming down
Spinning all their way down under sand
She don't see the lips all spitting sky
She don't love.

The kiss was sweet, Sharp and cold,
Spitting like a child.
The rock was smooth, Kept us cool, And the beach blew like disease.
Day gone dark, a shining sea, Let's torch this sky and healing city.
Sand was cool, the ice sank ships and the breeze kissed lips like flies.

But your falling And she's falling
