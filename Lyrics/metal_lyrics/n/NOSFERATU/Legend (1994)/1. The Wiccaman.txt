The day is lost to the given daughters
Broken lives with men like him
Girls in groups with blackened hands
Knights in shining shattered limbs

The time has come for you to lose
All you fought for a living soul
The time has come for you to lose
All you fought for
All you ever never had

Flicker the flames burn your hands
You know he'll take you down with him
Flicker the flames burn your hands
The Wiccaman, he'll trade with you

Girls in black with blackened hearts
Knights in shining rested armor

Flicker the flames burn your hands
You know he'll take you down with him
Flicker the flames burn your hands
The Wiccaman, he'll trade with you

Times that change, the wind that blows
The realms of beasts are given souls
The girls in groups with blackened hearts
The shapes of Angels, their noble hearts

Flicker the flames burn your hands
You know he'll take you down with him
Flicker the flames burn your hands
The Wiccaman, he'll trade with you
