The voices take me up,
And snakes come twist about,
Tell me what this knife is for,
And tell me how to cut them out.
The voices give me love,
And the voices sell me dear,
But show me how to smash them up,
And show me how to leave them here.

And the darkness sings to me.
And the poison bleeds me dry.

Darkness, just throw it away
Darkness, six feet below just isn't a fix.

The poison don't come cheap,
And the voices don't come slow,
But I can see a shot inside,
And power rising six feet below.
Some god give me strength to disbelieve,
These voices and the things they preach,
Some God give me strength to disbelieve,
These voices bring the death of me

Darkness, just throw it away
Darkness, six feet below just isn't a fix.

The voices take me up,
And snakes come twist about,
Tell me what this knife is for,
And tell me how to cut them out.
The voices give me love,
And the voices sell me dear,
But show me how to smash them up,
And show me how to leave them here.

Some god give me strength to disbelieve,
These voices and the things they preach,
Some God give me strength to disbelieve,
These voices bring the death of me

And the voices sing to me
And the voices bleed me dry

Darkness, just throw it away
Darkness, six feet below just isn't a fix.
