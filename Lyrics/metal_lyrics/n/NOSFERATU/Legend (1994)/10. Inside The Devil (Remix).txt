If ya come inside I can't help outside
You can't cry but you won't need to
Baby has found a way to surround
Surround herself in sorrow
If ya come inside I can't help outside
You should learn And God you'll need to
Baby has found the way to survive yeah Baby has found the solace

Get down, down, down inside the Devil
Get down, down, down inside the sun

If ya pick up things that don't belong
Something you will need to borrow
Your baby has found her God above
Yeah baby until tomorrow

If ya come inside I won't help outside
You can't cry You don't love
Baby has found her God above
Yeah baby don't need tomorrow

Get down, down, down inside the Devil
Get down, down, down inside the sun
I guess I know

Come see the fish on the waves
Call it fun I don't know
If your wish or desire should take hold and bury you
Under the earth
Under the earth
Under the earth
