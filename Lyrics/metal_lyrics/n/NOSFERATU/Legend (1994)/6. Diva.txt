Deeper Diva
In the hollow smiles of men that dance
The wheels of might in wasted miles
The light shines bright for you
And the night comes down

The corn grows tall in hallowed fields
The flames burn high
The bodies yield

Keep me halo

Your life has burnt in harvest yield
Your soul transcends what once was real

Keep me halo Keep me deep down Halo
Keep me halo Keep me deep down Halo

Deeper Diva
In hollow cites Men that dance
Fields of might Wasted miles
Your soul transcends
What one was real

Keep me halo Keep me deep down Halo

In the hollow smiles Of men that dance
The field has claimed The hollow man

Keep me halo Keep me deep down Halo Keep me halo
Keep me deep down Halo
