You've just been bitten once again
And I've been infected by your pain
Don't lose the soap
Next time we have another bloodbath
Remember that it's just as red as the blood itself

Miss Brown, your blood tastes oh so great
You know I'd like to excavate
Every single thing alive or dead
To get inside your walls of red

I'm just a sucker for your love
Red liquid sent from up above
Out of your veins into my mouth
And back again

Far far away out to another world
Where love is free
And blood seeps from the necks of girls

I'm just a sucker for your love
Red venom delivered from above
Out of your veins into my mouth
And back again

Now, there are days we live on each other's blood
All night and into the day
When we're in our 300's
Lets hope the fun will stay

Far far away out to another world
Where love is free
And blood seeps from the necks of girls
I stumbled on the place where I found you
Every day since the day
The holes in your neck they flow, flow, and flow
And so did you

We passed her time
And I'm a fool
All day we lie asleep
In a double coffin
And as long as we can keep it this good
We'll never stop rotting

Miss Brown, your blood tastes oh so great
You know I'd like to excavate
Every little thing alive or dead
To get inside your walls of red

Far far away out to another world
Where love is free
And blood seeps from the necks of girls
I stumbled on the place where I found you
Every day since the day
The holes in your neck they flow and flow and flow
And so did you
