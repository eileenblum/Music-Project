No stone is left unturned
Leaving coats of darkness on the earth
Blocking out the light of day
The shadowmaker's on his way
No man is left unhurt
No woman spared from oblivion
In a little time you'll see that
The sun is history

Darkness in the open deserts
Darkness on the polar centres
Darkness as I look at the trees and the light is Falling

Even in the light of day
Open up to the shadows made
People screaming in the street
Don't shade me, don't cloud me, don't feed on life from me

Gloom sets in, no return
Blind frenzy spreads right through the earth
People screaming in the street for
Something that they can not see

Even as I told before
When you walk right through your door
People running aimlessly
Through forming clouds they cannot see

Don't shade me Don't hide me Don't cloud me Don't feed on life from me

No stone is left unturned
Leaving coats of darkness on the earth
In a little time you'll see that The sun is history

Darkness in the open deserts
Darkness in the polar centres
Darkness as I look at the trees and the light is Falling

Even in the light of day, open up the shadows made
People screaming in the street, don't shade me
Don't cloud me , don't feed on light from me

If I had known before
I'd have left the planet long ago
Shadows cannot form in space
I'll be up in a brighter place

Even in the light of day
Open up to the shadows made
People screaming in the street, don't shade me
Don't cloud me, don't feed on light from me
