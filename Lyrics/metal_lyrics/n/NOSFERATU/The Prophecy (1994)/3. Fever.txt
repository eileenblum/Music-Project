Without trace we can hide
Let the fever turn the tide
If the audience knew, they would laugh too

I'll see you later behind the cage
I'm falling off a higher stage
I'm getting lost in my head as you lie in bed to

Find a way out of this mess and run away with me
Keep having fun Remember we're on the run with the fever

Oh little girl from far away
It's nice to see you're back again
If you only knew, you would laugh too

See you soon in the usual place
Don't think that anyone will find our space
We can throw away yet another day to

Find a way out of this mess and run away with me
Keep having fun Remember we're on the run with the fever
Have another lethal dose Don't hide away from me
Keep having fun Remember we're on the run with the fever

Without trace we can fall
The audience will call
But they won't see neither you nor me no more
And when the fever wipes the last
We'll fade into the past
But we'll still be here without a fear to

Find a way out of this mess and run away with me
Keep having fun Remember we're on the run with the fever
Have another lethal dose Don't hide away from me
Keep having fun Remember we're on the run with the fever
