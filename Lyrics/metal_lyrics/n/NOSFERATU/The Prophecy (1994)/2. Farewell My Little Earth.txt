I ran into the night
Chased after horizons and rainbows to see
If I could catch up with them
They stayed in front of me
But I could never reach them but turned around to see
That they were now behind me

I wanted to go back Find the right and left
And the between, the front and back
The spectrum colours rose and span.
I teleported, I transported to a ship on the way to Titan
I saw Saturn's rings and patterns
Lifting me up as space got brighter

Farewell my little Earth
Hello my biggest dream
My breathing space is awesome
No one will believe where I've been

I wanted to know
Why no one had discovered
What I was going through
But then "What the Hell?" I thought, as I said

Farewell my little Earth
Hello my biggest dream
My breathing space is awesome
No one will believe where I've been
Farewell my little Moon
I'd rather look at Saturn
Taking up the sky
Ascending me to heaven

You can go anywhere if you wanna see
That you're not in the only place that you could be
If you wanna go an eon or two ahead
Space and time are immaterial within your head
Through the galaxies or all of the universe
Make a blessing out of everything that is a curse
There is no such a thing as big or small
When you have all the access you need to all
You can do anything that you wanna do
Just develop all the power you have in you
Throwing off the restrictions of hell
And the chains that prevent you from doing well
There is no end to anything you want to see
And no better place than the galaxies
You can dream all the dreams that you wanna have
Don't care if all the people think you're mad

I tried to remember
Just what it was that I had done
To get here in the beginning
So I could find my way home
I teleported, I transported To a ship on the way back home
I saw Saturn's rings and patterns
I waved them and departed alone

I wanted to know Official secrets stopped me
And I thought a lot about
How no one would believe me

I ran into the night
Chased after horizons and rainbows to see
If I could catch up with them
They stayed in front of me
And I could never reach them
but turned around to see
That they were now behind me
