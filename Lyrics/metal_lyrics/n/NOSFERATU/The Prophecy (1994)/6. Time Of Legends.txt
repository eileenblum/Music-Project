I know a way to eternity
So follow if you will, follow me
Through the window to the time of legends
All you have to do is just believe that

Dragons fly as winter falls
Giants crush their way through storms
To sleep at night in warm places
And find fortune in the sleeve of aces
Giants fly as ogres scream
It's oh so hard to believe that Demons live
They're made of flesh
So pray it goes on and on forever

I'll bring you in if you trust me
Through the castle gates, beyond the trees
Along the path to the dungeon cellar
All you have to do is just believe that

Dragons fly as winter falls
Giants crush their way through storms
To sleep at night in warm places
And find fortune in the sleeve of aces
Giants fly as ogres scream
It's oh so hard to believe that Demons live
They're made of flesh
So pray it goes on and on forever

You never told why you could never Fly in the land of zero gravity
When all you do is follow me
The darkness won't bite you
It shouldn't frighten you
It should take you through
It should take you through
Though the portal to the make-believe of your imagination [2X]

[Chorus]
