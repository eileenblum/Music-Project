A million miles away from where the sun is shining
The keeper calls your name from the house Where he guards the gates And through
the night I weaken With the feeling of him reaching out for you
Find me drained and helpless lying on the floor
On the floor as you grow stronger

Look into the sky
Can you feel the rays descending down the white light
With your protection would you fly away tonight ?

The keeper calls your name
Waiting for the flames to burn my way

As the keeper calls your name my shell is fading
Feeling like I'm losing my strength To another, another I'm waiting
To end this way, to be so brave To call the keeper, pleading he should save me
Save me from the hell
Save me from the spell
Don't leave me here to die

Look into the sun
Can you see the light descending down on you today
Without direction will you fly, fly, fly, away?

The keeper calls your name
Waiting for the flames to burn my way
Through another flame
The keeper calls your name
Waiting for the flames to burn my way

Keeper, Don't rip me up inside no more, Don't rip me up inside
Keeper, There is no place for me to hide no more
Give me back the strength you have stolen from me

A million miles away from where the moon is rising
The house where the keeper guards the gates is falling down
And through the night I strengthen
With the feeling of you reaching out for me
I find you drained and helpless lying on the floor
On the floor as I grow stronger

Look into his eyes
Can you understand the sun is calling you today?
With your protection would you fly, fly, fly away?

Through another flame
The keeper calls to you
Dream until it's true
Waiting to come through
To burn my way to you
