With the trick of the light With a running risk
She'll lift you up With her magic bliss
She'll feed your soul To the full with joy
You'll be feeling great Now that she has a toy
With the flash of the light When you're feeling bliss
She'll feed your heart With her savage kiss
She'll rip you up She'll spit you out
It'll be up to you To get out now

With a flash of the light
When you are feeling
Caught in a trap
With the passing of time
When you are feeling Like you've made one grave mistake

She will come with a vengeance for you
There's nothing that you can do to stop her
Tearing up your soul Your soul will be what she destroys

With a savage kiss With a savage bite
She'll lift you up If you're alone tonight
You'll be okay 'Til you're back is turned
You'll feel the knife When will you ever learn

With the twist of the moment
When you are feeling The pleasure of her pain

She will come, she'll be looking for you
There's nothing that you can do about it
She'll tear away your soul and kill you When she knows she can

Can you get out of here?
Before you are in danger Or will you fall in her trap?
To feel her anger Will you feel her knife?
Or will you get on the train? Out of here tonight? Out of here tonight?

With the trick of the light With a running risk
She'll eat you up With her savage kiss
She'll tear your soul And drain your brain
Now she has her toy She's feeling great
With the feeling of danger
When you are trying
To run away from murder

She will come with a vengeance for you
There's nothing that you can do about it
She'll rip your head to shreds and bury you at any time
She will come, she'll be looking for you
There's nothing that you can do to stop her
She'll tear away your soul and kill you When she knows she can
She will come with a weapon for you
There's nothing that you can do to stop it
You'll be as good as dead
There is no way you can escape
She will throw a knife at you and feel no remorse about it
Tearing up your soul Your soul will be what she destroys
