Sound of her soul,
She has sound in her soul,
She writhes for her heart,
In a foreign land of confusion.

Way above the earth, way above the crowd, Way past you.
Somebody's inside, Body's alive, Body is blind to you.

Love is dead, I said her love is dead,
And her siren red lights take the lonely ones,
And her siren red lights take the lonely ones
