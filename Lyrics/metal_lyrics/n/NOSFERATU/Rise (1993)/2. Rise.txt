I know the Devil's lady,
She don't look too good in white,
Keeps her dragons on the naked backs of all she might.
I know the Devil's coming,
Gonna help her with her detailed pattern changes every evening,
For a chance to spread the light.

One more kiss and we say goodbye to angels in her eyes
One more look and we kiss hello to Heaven.

Chance would be a fine thing,
Keeps her where she's teetering,
Knife-edge cold promotionals won't move her to a flight.

One more kiss and we say goodbye to angels in her eyes,
One more look and we kiss hello to Heaven.
In between the sky and earth I'm waiting for a rise,
In between this Hell on earth forever.

Screaming while she takes the poison,
Burns her throat and holds her arms,
Something painful isn't always Something that isn't nice.

If your witness isn't subtle,
Cast your witness still aside.
If your need is buried deep, Then bury me, come deep inside.
