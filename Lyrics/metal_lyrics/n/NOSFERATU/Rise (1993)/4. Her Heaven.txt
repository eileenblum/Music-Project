He saw through her eyes at the movement inside,
The thoughts that were dawning and falling outside,
The life she was leading, the people she knew,
The things that she loved, and the people she was married to.

To be free, I see your hands, Take these things away from me.
To be free, So I can see the sun.

She knew how to dream and how to become,
Everything she'd grown for, everything she was leaving for.
And learned how to see, with ice in her eyes,
Learned how to call, and smile with surprise.

To be free, I see your hands, Take these things away from me.
To be free, So I can see the sun.
To be free, To leave my soul, Break me down and carry me,
To be free, to feel the warmth burning me.

A line formed between her Heaven and her sins,
I'll never ever dream again as long as I'm with him,
But she knew she'd never leave alone, And never feel within,
That anything he could know could ever bring her back again.

To be free, I see your hands, Take these things away from me.
To be free, So I can see the sun.
To be free, To leave my soul, Break me down and carry me,
To be free, to feel the warmth burning me.
