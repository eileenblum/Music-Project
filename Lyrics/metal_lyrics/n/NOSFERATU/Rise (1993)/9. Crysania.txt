In the cruel wind
In what happened in here
In the darkness
She thought she knew the world
In my cell on my floor It broke her apart And we pushed it inside Till she fell
In the sound of submission Of little decisions And some futile search For
solution

And I still see tomorrow
And I still understand
Why I chose to believe
But you're so far away

Crysania believe in me

Don't you see how it works
The men kill their children So they never grow old
And I still have the strength To reach out for you But you're wrong again.
And I still have the strength To reach out for you But you're wrong again

Crysania believe in me

And I still believe to my heart
In your love of the dark your life
And your need for my blood
We can never return to the child in your picture
But still it's believing In something of yours

Crysania believe in me

I see stars I see angels I see living on earth And falling alone

Crysania believe in me
