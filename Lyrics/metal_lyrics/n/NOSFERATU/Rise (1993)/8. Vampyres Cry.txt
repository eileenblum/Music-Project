She took my hand,
Pulled me down to fall to where the air was ice,
She thought she'd find some peace inside and borrowed what was left of mine.

Vampyre's cry,
It comes down to you.
Vampyre's cry,
Like God and always.

Starved of blood and sick of head,
Inside her broken doors and shatters,
Kneeling down, cutting sky, She cupped her hands and reached for life.

Wave come down and pushing through,
Carry her where she wants to go to,
Wave come down and pushing through,
Carry her, carry her.

Vampyre's cry. Pull me down.
