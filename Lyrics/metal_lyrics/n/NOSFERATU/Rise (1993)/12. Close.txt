Josephine,
your eyes ring black,
But Josephine,
your thoughts are pure,
And Josephine drowns you.
And Josephine loves you.

You turn back blackened stone and cold,
Meet before the man you man you know,
Treasure in you,
There's treasure in you,
Heaven in you,
Lost surrounds.

And once before the black winds came,
Took your love on bended knee And close, close, close.

Took a hand out,
to a point,
Last is best of no returns.
No relief, no belief, No exchange delays or dispossession.

And once before the black winds came,
Took your love on bended knee And close, close, close.
And time again the black winds take you,
Shake your love and try to make you,
Close, close, close.
And time again the black winds shake you,
Break your love andf try to make you
close, close, close.
