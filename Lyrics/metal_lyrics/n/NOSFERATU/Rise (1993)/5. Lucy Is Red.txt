Lucy is dressed in a long black hood
A gaze that blinds and a pointed stick
She talks about love like all the other songs

Lucy is dressed in a pointed hat
Black steel heels and a black skin bag
She changes colours on off days When she moves

But no one tells Lucy When black turns to tears
Yeah, no one tells Lucy What she needs to know

Lucy is red

Lucy doesn't speak to the other girls
She twists and turns like a haunted man
She's all alone and ugly and stupid and lost
Lucy can't run and Lucy can't hide
She gives it away and she doesn't know how
She pouts and fucks and sucks And screams and kills

But no one tells Lucy when black turns to tears
Yeah, no one tells Lucy What she needs to know

Lucy is red

She's falling away from herself
Like she's falling away from The world that's so bright
That it kills her

Lucy is red, Lucy is red, Lucy is red
