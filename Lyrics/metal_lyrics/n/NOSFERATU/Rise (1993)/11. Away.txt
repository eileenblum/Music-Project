You make me a charm, gone and lost my way,
You hide from all you cannot say,
Shadow all that you should flaunt,
Bare it all up so I might see you,

Fall from grace.

Your light is alone and soft as scarlet,
Three people in one as she tries and she gives it

Away,
And all I hear is away,
And all I see is away,
Then all right in here is the way.

You're as bright and as lonely as your lost guitar man,
Gonna keep it inside, gonna wait for his hand,
Gonna save it all up till you've wasted your scarlet,
Hope you never wake up to find your love gone

Away,
And all I hear is away,
And all I see is away,
Then all right in here is the way.
