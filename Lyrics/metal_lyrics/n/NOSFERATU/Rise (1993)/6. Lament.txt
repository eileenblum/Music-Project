All that's bright must fade
Like your hand on heart
All that's dark must hold
All that once was thrown
All that's bright must fade
Like your hand in this
All that's dark must hold
All that once was thrown

Too close for comfort
But it's all that I can do
Too hard to feel
But it's all that I can see
Too hard to sleep
This isn't made for two
Too much to say
But it's All that I can do to you

Lament, tearing me apart
Lament, tearing me away

All that's bright must fade
Like your hand in this
All that's strong will break
Any ground that's ever made
All that's bright must fade
Like my heart in this
All that's strong will break
Any ground that's ever made

Don't you know that summer's just killing with you
Don't you know that breath
Stains like a rose tattoo
Don't you know that winter's just killing time for you
Don't you know that love
Stains like a rose tattoo

All that's bright must fade Like my heart in this
All that's dark must hold
All that once was stone
