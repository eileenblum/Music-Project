Hahha ha ha...

You... my flame flower
As a warm... little hell in my winter world
Born from the black light of hellfire
Mesmerizing...

Dance of dirty sin, as the black rose of my bloody coffin...

Every diabolic moon,
You haunting me, on my lonely tower windows
Brides of darkness, countess of glorious madness
Hypnotise me with your black magic spell...

In the altar of moonlight
With the bless of cosmic skies
Fall of heaven, with blood of fury
I enthroned you!
