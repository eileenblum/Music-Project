Moon baptism frozen heart... unchained mighty curse in the throne of darkness
Winter thousand years, painful thousand memories infiltrate from fallen light
Bestial lust of vein, haunted for silent pain flying from the shadow... whisper from the wind blow
Speak on the riddle an oracle without eyes under the pale horned moon
Desire... blood...
Sadistic... evil...
And never give mercies
Instinct... body...
Curse as deadly weapon
Holy... terror...
As silent night invasion
Illusion... delusion...
Is a vampiric vision
...blood...
