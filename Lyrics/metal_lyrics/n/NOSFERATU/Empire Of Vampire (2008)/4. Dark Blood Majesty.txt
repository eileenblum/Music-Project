Heyy all the vampire!
arise from your hibernate!
out from your dark castle!!
awaken to fight!

For all humilliate us!!
for all bellitle us!
horns up the sword..!
shout the war!!

Let conceited flow in heart us
because we are too hard to defeat
our fortress too much sturdy to colapse 
our world too dark to light them victory way

Litten battlefield with all blood from all the enemies
release sacred lust to carvo our victory 
let your heart to be poisoned of hatred powers
sadistic seems like harmony of pleasure

For glourious of darkness 
we must unite to fight
keep the flames of hate!
keep the flames of hate!!

Maybe we will die on battlefield
but not die before the war
make our soul never defeated 
although our body sprawled.. die..
