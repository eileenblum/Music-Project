Bright colors bring empty eyes
Solitude the finest place
Trapped in the civil war of brain waves 
Rotted out from disapoitment 
Repelling from hatred
Impulses grow
Regret tears into the soul like razors

Undersized caskets bring forth repulsion
Charred and buried into the fruitful soil
Innocence locks the eyes, preparing for eternal disapoitment 
Emotionless pits walk the street

Marrow of hearts break in heats
Staggered, limbless divergence from slumber
Corruption overpowering clean hands
Follow the dark paths without thought
Winds blow the putrid stenches
Screaming in anxiety 
Silence is easier to search than find
Desire for release never found

Undersized caskets bring forth repulsion
Charred and buried into the fruitful soil
Innocence locks the eyes, preparing for eternal disapoitment 
Emotionless pits walk the street
