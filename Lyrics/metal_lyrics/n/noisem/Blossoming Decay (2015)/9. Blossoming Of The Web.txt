lacerations layer skin
just to see what pours out
this window opens
but the water melts inside
bellowing in this pain
ripping into my stomach
i only live to see myself bleed
the only rush i can understand

the hollow lung is finally filled
interconnected
driven into a pulse
unable to escape

locked in a coffin of lies
the spikes led into a corroding consciousness
eyes removed
i see nothing left of the world
projection of blurred thoughts
manifested in flowing falsity
the air is running thin
submerged in a body of self inflicted misery

the hollow lung is finally filled
interconnected
driven into a pulse
unable to escape
from the frame, residing in my mind

bonded bridge of fallen delusion
crashed into ceaseless dreams
canals of eternal seclusion
fogged vision through red streams
an end to my insanity
my final plea to duplicity
casted flowers to the sea
from people who never knew me
