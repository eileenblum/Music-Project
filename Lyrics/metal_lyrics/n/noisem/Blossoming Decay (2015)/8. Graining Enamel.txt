sinking stomachs, repulsed memory
grow miles up veins
creep like vines into the soul
entangled, unable to detach
twist and rot, to the beat of life
with the failed attempt to adjust
thrown away, growing today
the suffering can no longer stop

it bleeds blue
dwelling in the color of fingertips
shouting silent
as the agony firmly hits the wall

the greying skies become earthbound
stuck in the dirt below me
cascading the walls
surrounding the landscape
dimming time approaches
ripping lungs rupture
the stomach sinks deeper
as the knife protrudes quicker

the nightmare still lingers
within a thread
woven into a barren mind

seeds of your insanity, impregnated my words
years pass, yet the clay still molds

nothing
