wandering along this path
the flowers bloom around my ankles
with every step
they rip from their roots
reincarnate into shards
adding another slice of flesh
disabling the will to live
disemboweling a decaying conscience

dropping out from the normal cycles of life
the rivers of thought halted
staring in the mirror tragically different
aggression stalks into a once untouched spine

this trail dwells among me
stuck in the sea of blood
the emotion has been ripped
and beaten into a pulp
a sense of regret
stabs at my abdomen
a tension had become too much
layer these flowers in memorial

dropping out from the normal cycles of life
the rivers of thought halted
staring in the mirror tragically different
aggression stalks into a once untouched spine

the chapters wonât end
yet the pages turn
time taken for granted
as the hourglass goes empty
