disappearance of thought
brittle, bright and shade
epidermal existence
ripped through and right
patient dragging scars
glass breaks shining
only thought lonely brought
presence declines and stops

you bleed, you kill
you rip, you cry
runaway, never today

closing doors leaking drops
waterfall of the cracks
standing in front, to watch endlessly
the slow and painful escape
it burns and burns, it never ends
time throws itself out
wasting a life, driven to die
it takes time to do nothing

you bleed, you kill
you rip, you cry
runaway, never today
you shed, you drag
you break, you die
abandon, without thought
