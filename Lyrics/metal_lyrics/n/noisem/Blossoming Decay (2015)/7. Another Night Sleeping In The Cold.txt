conditioned for the concrete
an icy slab of ruptured grails
it grows colder every night
marinated in sliced animality
raised with a sense of duplicity
the needles pierce harder
layer the streets with flesh
the slices grow thinner with every cut

jaded to the knowledge of flames
i live to be fucking burnt
i dig to find an answer
but its already dead
i only love what i cannot have
i only kill the ones i love
pray for the orchids
may they be planted when the slices cease

left to be alone
for one more night in the cold
