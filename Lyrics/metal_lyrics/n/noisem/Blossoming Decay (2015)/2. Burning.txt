breaking into pieces
hearing the screams
anxiety burdens the piercing pitches
frequencies
stabbing and pulling at heart strings
sliding into unlit nervousness
shivering
aching
the heat of the argument does not warm
but only freezes away

all love lost
nothing gained
a plastic passion grows like a tumor
on these cell connections
as a reason to live is lost

endless, suffering, breathing, again

the mood regulator grows slowly entombed
behind the thoughts of slit wrists and loneliness
yet to feel the endless dawn
yet to feel the warmth of the end
predicted to come
but only now creeping

all love lost
nothing gained
a plastic passion grows like a tumor
on these cell connections
as a reason to live is lost
this crypt of lies consuming
porcelain innocence laid to ruins
faithful to insolent
endless, suffering, breathing, again
