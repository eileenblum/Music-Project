Realtiy brings fetal positions
Skins burn into haze
Entrapped within the rights of thought
Buried within rubbles of life

Excepts of nightmares consume 

Aching under the pressure of lungs
Lacking the compassions to escape
Devoid of emotions 
Lusting days that I can feel again

Excerpts of nightmares consume 

Colors run together on surrounding walls
Light begins to fade
Encrusting boils wretch over eyes
Enslaved in this corroding conscience 
I will never feel again 
Consumed by my own iniquity
