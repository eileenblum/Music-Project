My occupation is to tag the bodies, And throw them in the drawer
My sickness is to play with them, Behind closed doors
I lacerate the body, Then after I sew
When I am all alone, They never say no

Removing organs, Post annihilation
The voices return, During desecration
They know it was me, Defiling all the corpses
The more I disturb, The stronger the forces

When I penetrate, I start to feel a chill
Soon after with voices, My head starts to fill

The voices in the morgue, Are calling my name
The voices in the morgue, Are driving me insane

My occupation is to tag the bodies, And throw them in the drawer
My sickness is to play with them, Behind closed doors
I lacerate the body, Then after I sew
When I am all alone, They never say no

I lock myself in, Grab my twelve gauge
I take my own life, My body will now fade

The voices in the morgue, Are calling my name
The voices in the morgue, I'll splatter my brain
