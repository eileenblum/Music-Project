In the air, a stale taste of concrete.
On my back. Broken place where I sleep.
Two hands, brings my world to me.
Wash them. In gutter water from the street.
Long Haul. Long Haul.Long Haul.
feels warm tonight heat from a radio.
Tucked in sleep tight tomorrow starts.
Another fucking curse. Another fucking curse. Another fucking curse. Another fucking curse.
Myself by myself. Myself by myself. Myself by myself.Myself...
KILL ALL REDNECK PRICKS
