Taking bite after bite until my gut is full.
Its always been a fight but thereÂ´s no one IÂ´d like to hurt more.
Fake grace high fives. Picked Benedict out of the crowd.
Hold my enemies close. They will feel my knife.
These all begin to add up.
Time to get out the wallet and pay my balance down.
Honest. Disgust. Honest. Distrust.
CÂ´mon, love give us a kiss.
Thighs like lies, your fake face in torn lace.
