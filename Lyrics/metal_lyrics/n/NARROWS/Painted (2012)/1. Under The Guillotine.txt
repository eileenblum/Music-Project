The Crown is worn by a sullen son.
Today is the day, time has come.
Hearing black mists you spray.
Will you know victory today?
Breaking ground,taking the the head of the hound.
LetÂ´s cut the head off this.
In time the swords are dawn.
This is the sand that you canÂ´t stop.
Arrows away.
Night blocks out day.
