Father, the race is on. Build us a place of filth and see the trails covered with layers of death.
LetÂ´s walk the long road out, bring up solutions now.
Mother. wash yourself.
You donÂ´t want to stand out.
Such a sight to see tracing footprints we leave.
It makes no difference. See want we see.
It makes no difference. WhatÂ´s come to be.
