Awaken beast from deep in the dungeons of Earth.
Open your eyes.
The rite is done, the blood you need is now spilled.
Flames will cover this world.

Destroy them all, unleash the fear.

Here comes the storm, the roar of thunder shakes the land.
Skies will crumble.
Humans scream, their eyes behold the end.
Fury of nature's unleashed.

The ancient beast comes for you: There's no escape.

Thunder and lightning will roar.
I can feel the darkness embracing our souls.
The sky above will fall,
Now the fury of nature is unleashed.

Raging clouds darken the sky above the land.
The beast comes, I see his eyes: they're full of death.
The last chance to catch a glimpse of light.
Our lives are condemned.

Slay them beast, erase this race from the Earth:
Rip off their hearts.
Punish them, make their blood cover the land.
Nature will be born again.

The ancient beast comes for you: This is the end.
