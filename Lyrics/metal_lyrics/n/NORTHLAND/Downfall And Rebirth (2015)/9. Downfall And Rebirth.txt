Here we stand, upon the highest tower made by man
Contemplating their dreams turning into sand.
Compassion is lost, as lost as human lives
Whose hearts, strangled by roots, foresee their death.
Scream, cry, suffer and die.
Awaken mother, slay their souls once and for all.

Mankind drain the essence of my sacred land.
Arrogant creatures of mine,
Possessed by the blindness of greed.
Ignorants sentenced to demise.
(to demise)

Mankind, tainting the nature, the earth and sky:
Coward creations.
Scream and cry, feel the pain.
Suffer and die once and for all.

Darkness has come to stay.
Behold the Earth's rebirth.
The light is fading away.
All hope is gone.

Clouds of doom
Wash the grime away.
Downfall is about to begin.
Nothing will stop the rain.
Humans await your demise.

Now, when the end is here,
Fear arise but your regrets are in vain.

Feel the fury of mother earth.
Home is what you destroyed.
You never deserved this dwelling.
Just your death will make it reborn.
Cry and die. You felt no remorse for nature;
Now nature feels no remorse for you.

This is the end of your existence.
It's time to let nature breathe.
The pain you brought is the pain you will feel.
Leave this world alone.

Your demise washed the grime away.
When downfall came to an end
Nature felt its rebirth.
