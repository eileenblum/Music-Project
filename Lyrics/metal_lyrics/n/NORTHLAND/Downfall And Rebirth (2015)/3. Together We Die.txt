Feel this:
This is the sign of death
Invading your bones and flesh
Devouring your soul.
Insanity reigns.

Fear us:
We are the strength of the wind.
We're made of storms. We're made of ice hailing fierce.
We're fire in hell.

As one we march into the brutal war,
Strong, unbeatable we will be.
(Together we die)
Many of us won't see the dawn again;
We know victory is our destiny.

Wake up:
The cold invades your veins.
Madness controls your brain,
'Cause you know today
Is the last of your days.

Bastards:
I'll nail down my sword on you.
Deep in your guts,
I want your blood coming out from your throat.

Arrows fly,
Hammers crust their heads.
Brothers kill them all.
Gods are on our side.

Together we ride.
Together we fight.
From this day on, and forever,
Together we die.
