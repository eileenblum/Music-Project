The old ancestors have fallen,
Leaving their place for a newborn light.
The eternal circle keeps flowing:
Light turns to dark and dark turns to light.

Explosions in the midst of cosmos
Create the spark for a new flame of life.
Storms of energy when time is ignored,
Clash in an ocean of colliding stars.

Forces will awake time;
Time will awake life.
Fire will burn.

Flames of life and death
Battle in cosmos again.
Your light will shine tonight
In the veil of the night.
Astral lord, newborn star
Astral lord, newborn star...

Spread your might.
You're a lord of existence;
You're the essence of souls.
Dwell in the skies as the sun
And as a star for those in the distant nights.
Guide them through the unknown paths.
Be their inspiration from afar.

Forces will awake time;
Time will awake life.
Fire now burns.
