Blood flows, burning like fire through my veins.
The threshold is now broken and
Your nightmares are awake.

Run:
You can't hide.
I'm your pain.
I am death.

Taste your last miserable moments
Take your sad last breath
For you released your sentence and
Your life is the price you will pay.

Die:
By my hand.
Spill your blood
On my face

Darkness and shadows will fall on my way.
Sunlight will guide my sword.
When nighttime falls for a new red dawn,
When light kills the dark,
My eyes behold the blood red sunrise.
My eyes behold the blood red daybreak.

Feel the coldness of my blade
Piercing your bones and flesh.
The morning breeze devours you
Die you bastard, scream in pain.

Blood:
Stains the sky.
When you bleed
Night dies; a new day begins.

I am the slayer of the eternal night
Essence of the day creator of the dawn.
I die and I'm born every day.
When I rise darkness falls away.
