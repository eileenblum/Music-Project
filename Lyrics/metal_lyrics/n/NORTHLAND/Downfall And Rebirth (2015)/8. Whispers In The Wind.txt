For thousands of years living in slavery
Obeying the tyrants who sentence us to die.
The time has come:
We'll slay the enemy
As soon as the night falls after the crimson sky.

(rise, fight)
Follow your heart
Spirits of the dark land
Please hear my call:
Kill the false king
Freedom is a right for us all.

(rise, fight)
Don't look behind
Rise up my brothers, fearless and strong.
United we're thunder, united we won't fall.

Bloody clashing swords make the song of freedom
While the rain of arrows falls from the dark.
The spark from our hearts lights the revolution
And the shade of the past will soon meet the light.

"Sons, hear the call of revolution,"
Whispers the wind.
The sun will rise. After the pain
We will be free.

United we ride
(rise, fight)
United we fight
(rise, fight)
United we die
(rise, fight)
No matter the price,
The tyrants will be sacrificed.

Strength fills my heart.
We need you 'cause we can win.
Fire burns inside of me.
I'm waiting for the hidden sign.
Waiting for the hidden sign...

"Sons, hear the call of revolution,"
Whispers the wind.
The sun will rise. After the pain
Tyrants will fall!
