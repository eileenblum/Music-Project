I am alone,
Surrounded by shadows,
And far is the light of the moon.
My pulse is fading.
My blood is freezing.
Death will take me soon.
The voice in my head
Keeps whispering words
Of what I left behind.
Step by step I sink into the unknown.
Madness get out of my head!

A lonely soul
Spirit in darkness
Fights and cries alone.
His eyes are closed.
His memories torment him
For tears flee from his heart.
Hollow desperation
Defeat after defeat
He keeps breathing: Alive.
Suffering time, enduring pain
He knows this sacrifice won't be in vain.

Hear my cry.
I'm still alive.

Beneath the darkness and shadows
I will rise!

Thousand flaming arrows could pierce my heart
And it will keep beating for you.
An endless river could flow from my eyes
But nothing existing under the sun will make me give up.

I will climb the mountains
And sail the seven seas
For as long as the light of my star
Shines in the night.
I will face the storms
And run against the wind
And someday I will rest by your side.
