Sleep and dream child of the night.
I will be by your side.
Dark secrets unfold
Under oceans of stars.

Close your eyes, feel the calm
The light of day is over.
Hear the wind whisper songs.
Join the dark, I'll watch over you.

Moon in the sky will you be my guide?
Show me the way though the darkest nights.
Child take my hand.

Deep inside of your thoughts
Dwells the torment of your soul
I will let my light bathe your spirit,
You and I will dream away.

Fly with me, rest among stars
In this solemn night, we will become one.
Fly with me, rest among stars
In this solemn night, we will become one.

Sleep and dream child of night
I will be by your side.
