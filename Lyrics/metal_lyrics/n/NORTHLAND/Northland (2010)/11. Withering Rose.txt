Those glory days vanished into the past.
Fury of time is taking your life.
No one can ride forever.
At the end of all paths light turns dark and death.

You've seen many days turning into night.
And many fallen stars lost in the sky.
Did you find a reason to fight for?
Did you find love to die for?

The withering rose is dying.
It's life has come to an end.
The darkened leaves are falling,
To a better place.
Carried by the wind they will rest in eternity.

Far away I left storms behind.
Through blizzards and rain,
Through love and pain,
Eternal silence of death,
Calmly drowns my soul.
For i can feel nothing again.

The gates of cosmos are closing
Frozen for centuries to rest in peace,
Fragments of my life are vanishing in time,
This lonely night.

I'm leaving this world tonight.
Sorrow and pain will be gone at the down.

Those glory days became part of the past.
Fury of time has taken your life.
Your spirit will never ride forever.
Where the path ends a new life begins.
