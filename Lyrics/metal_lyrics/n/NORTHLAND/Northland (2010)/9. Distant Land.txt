When the sun rase far in a distant land
Silence died with the night
Four riders set on a journey
Of no return

The wind blew softly across the land
Their eyes portrait home in memory
Their lives and homes they left behind
Into the mist they we're gone.

Now that you have reached the end of the path
I hope that you can hear my voice once more

I have seen many moons since they left us
Alone in the darkness I cried
The light of the star they followed
Into oblivion is gone

Autumn winds will you spread my sad song dar away
My shadow, now rides towards death,

Now that you have reached the end of the path
I hope that you can hear my voice once more
My eyes now stare at the end of the path
I know we will be together again.
