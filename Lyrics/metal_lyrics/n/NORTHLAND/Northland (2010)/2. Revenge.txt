Revenge!

When the darkness remains on your way,
There's no stars to follow in the night.
Awake my son, your heart will be your guide,
Walk and walk, forward.

When the arrows cross your lonely heart,
And the bastards scream for victory!
Raise your sword, their heads soon will fall,
Their blood will flow away.

In the name of my Gods, of my King and my Land,
We will fight till we rise again.

We want revenge!
Destiny is now by our side.
For what you did you all will pay.
Someday you will taste my revenge.

From the darkness to the light, I will ride day and night.
Enemies on my way will pay, what they deserve.

When the light is shining on the way,
and the stars that we follow bright so high.
We raise our swords!
And together we scream!

In the name of my Gods, of my King and my Land,
We will fight till we rise again.

We want revenge!
Destiny is now by our side.
For what you did, you all will pay.
Someday you will taste my revenge.
