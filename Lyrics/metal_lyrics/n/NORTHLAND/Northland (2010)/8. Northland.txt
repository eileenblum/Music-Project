Rising sun in the east, I will go with you...Where the ocean ends, my home beginsNorthland is calling me! Far away from the lands we know,beyond our rivers and seas.I have come 'cause my land is calling me again. I will sail the ocean many nights and daysI will sail far beyond your eyes can see. My land is calling me, I have to goBright moonlight calls me. Rising sun in the east, I will go with you...Where the ocean ends, my home beginsNorthland is calling me! My land is calling me, I have to goPlease take my hand again 'cause I'm lost for youI am so alone, lonely night guide me.Please take my hand again 'cause I'm lost for you!
