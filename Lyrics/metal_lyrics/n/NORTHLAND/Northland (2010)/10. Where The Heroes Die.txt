Together we march! Towards the battle!With our powerful heartsStarlight guide us! Show us the way!Its cold light reflects our victory(Victory) 10.000 men to the glory they rode, and they fell!Where the heroes die...10.000 dreams to oblivionremember them forever more. Clouds are hiding the pale moonlightwe smell the death close to usI promised give my life and fulfill the prophecybut the gods failed us the stars are coming down(Like arrows) Altough we'll fight, we know we'll die!As heroes we'll fight 'til the end! 10.000 men to the glory they rode, and they fell!Where the heroes die...10.000 dreams to oblivionremember them forever more.
