Sunlight takes the darkness away,
Springtime calls the spirits of the land.
A mystic forest is my home,
Where wind blows with an ancient beautiful song.

Awake my forces to leave!

Immortal forest song!
Echoes of the past.
Immortal forest song!
Remain as silence eternally.

Night falls for the wandering spirits,
Thousands of souls will feast in the dark.
No one knows the secrets of the land,
And forgotten tales of the past.

Spirits tell me your fantasies,
Let me hear your weak voice.
And fairy tales will be told,
'till the end of time.

Immortal forest song!
Echoes of the past.
Immortal forest song!
Remain as silence eternally.

Weak wind of the inner forest,
Let the bloomy flowers grow.
Take me through the endless seasons,
And where the sun is gone.

Awake my forces to leave!

Immortal forest song!
Echoes of the past.
Immortal forest song!
Remain as silence eternally.
