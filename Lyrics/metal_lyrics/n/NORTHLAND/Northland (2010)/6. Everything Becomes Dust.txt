A pale light guides through the dark pages of my life.
Blood is ink in my book of pain and sorrow.
Which I write and I ignore. when this is going to end?
Is there any way to escape?

Faithful dreams of glory now fade away.
Falling down to the ocean like rain.

The dreams i once had, now they're fantasy.
Death closed the door blinding my eyes.
From the light that i cannot see.

When the rain caressed my skin,
When I faced the raging wind,
My spirits was alive but now is dead.
I feel nothing but pain i feel nothing but hate.
...and everything becomes dust.

I've been all my life chasing falling stars,
Through the dark paths day and night.
The light that once shone to guide me home,
Now is gone forever more.

Shadows dance in the horizon,
As i wait for the end.
Nothing but ashes will remain.
The dust that once was me.

When the rain caressed my skin,
When I faced the raging wind,
My spirits was alive but now is dead.
I feel nothing but pain I feel nothing but hate.
...and everything becomes dust.
