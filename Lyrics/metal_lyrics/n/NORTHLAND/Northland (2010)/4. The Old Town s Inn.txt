When nightfall comes and covers our land,
The last ray of light fades far away.
Moonlight reigns up in the sky,
Thousands of spirits wont sleep tonight. No!!

The gate of a new world opened for a while,
No sadness no fears shall pass.
Death and sorrow we leave behind,
our laments soon will be past.

There's a light in the dark that never fades away,
There well spend the rest of our days.

Raise your pint!
Take a swip!
This is the Old Town's Inn.
Where endless nights are drowned in beer.
Where pain and sorrow disappear.
Raise your pints!
Take a swip!
Sing songs of victory,
Drink for those who are not here.
Until the stars disappear.

This time will last forever.
Time has come for the spirits of the land.
The moonlight spell is about to end.
A distant light shines far away.
The sunlight brings a new day.

Raise your pint!
Take a swip!
This is the Old Town's Inn.
Where endless nights are drowned in beer.
Where pain and sorrow disappear.
Raise your pints!
Take a swip!
Sing songs of victory,
Drink for those who are not here.
Until the stars disappear.
