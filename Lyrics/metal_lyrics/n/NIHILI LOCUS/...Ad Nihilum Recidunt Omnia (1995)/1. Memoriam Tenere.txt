Huge trees dominate the immense.
They're without a natural color.
Only the night, darkness, obscurity
drawn on'em wonderful esoteric shadows.
I revived in my memories (But I don't live).
I'll blot out my memories.
I revived, I live in a pale light that is on my walk.
Doom is written!
Memoriam Tenere!
I still see your cerulean eyes, fixing me and
hiding behind - White candles -
I see you, you run, you escape
But it's useless - ha ha ha ha -
You know it's too late, doom is written.
- Memoriam Tenere -
Don't use your tears, I'm heartless! - ha ha ha ha -
A drop of your blood,
drop by drop - slowly -
The death will come, a drop of my sperm - will be -
The child of hate, of my hate - you... -
Don't be afraid, you won't die under - the hot sun -
the mantle of Novembre will tie your chains
- And you will slowly die -
slow your suffering, slow my pleasure
Memoriam Tenere - Worshipping your dead flesh -
Memoriam Tenere - Smelling your stench -
