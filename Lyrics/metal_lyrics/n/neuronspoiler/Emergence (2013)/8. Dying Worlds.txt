Dying worlds haunting my existence
Life's been taken away â a gift that can't be taken back
All that's left are the memories and your influence on me
Although I wish when it's time
I'll go as you did with your head held high

Yesterday I was someone
Today I'm someone else
Nothing comes between us
The living and the...

I fear there's something coming to an end
It fills my heart and soul with emptiness
No matter what I'll never break the chain
The rest fades away but your legacy remains

Dying worlds wanting me to surrender
Telling me to forget and leave the things I love in darkness
They forsake the journey we have taken and yet
The last word hasn't been said
The last song has not yet been written

Yesterday I was someone
Today I'm someone else
Nothing comes between us
The living and the dead

I fear there's something coming to an end
It fills my heart and soul with emptiness
No matter what I'll never break the chain
The rest fades away but your legacy remains

I fear there's something coming to an end
It fills my heart and soul with emptiness

No matter what I'll never break the chain

Dying worlds haunting me
