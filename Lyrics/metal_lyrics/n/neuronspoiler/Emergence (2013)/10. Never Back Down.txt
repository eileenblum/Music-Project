Everything you say or think about me
Is irrelevant, it'll vanish with the wind
To me you're just another obstacle in life
That at some point I will leave behind

I know I have the strength and the courage to fight
No matter how hard and treacherous is the land
I will bleed my enemy when it comes to a fight
I won't be an easy prey, never...

You call yourself the puppet master of the show
But you really are a worthless waste of time
You'll never see the end of me it's your demise
And remember that what goes around comes around
You're coming down

I know I have the strength and the courage to fight
No matter how hard and treacherous is the land
I will bleed my enemy, when it comes to a fight
I won't be an easy prey, never

I will never back down

Never back down
