Run away from the real world
The sights just make me sick
Easier to shut the doors
And flick though fantasies
So in tune with selfish dreams
I think I joined the club
Should I eat this rotten apple?
I don't know anymore
I think I joined the club

So-called heroes rule my thoughts
They always take it all
But it seems alright somehow
A lifestyle to admire
Never mind the imbalance
Wealth just for a few
Could this be the core of injustice?
Still, they won't let it go
Still, they won't let it go

Well it's all or no one
Dignity will bring peace if we can ensure
You're exempt from privilege
We can no longer pay for the human race
You're exempt from privilege

If only you knew the feeling
Of having no prospects in life
You'd see it doesn't take much
To reach the joy you can't find

Well it's all or no one
Dignity will bring peace if we can ensure
You're exempt from privilege
We can no longer pay for the human race
We're exempt from privilege
