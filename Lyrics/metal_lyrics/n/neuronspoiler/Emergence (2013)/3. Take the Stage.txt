Well I'm off to the races
What a rush you can't replace it
The time has come for me to get my fix again
I'm runnin' on adrenaline
I'm headed for another sin

I won't make no excuses
I'm an animal that's on the loose yeah
I hear the voices and they're screaming out my name
I'm runnin' on adrenaline
I'm headed for another sin
Just tell 'em get out my way

This time is my own and tomorrow I'll be gone
I won't stop 'til I take the stage
And now I'm not alone so the feeling will live on
I won't stop 'til I take the stage

Where I belong, I'll find the place before too long
Known since I was born, up there in lights where I belong

Watch as I light the smelter
As the chickadees are getting hotter
But the remedy for killing time is working too slow
There's nothin' left to satisfy me so
I try to keep from going crazy
And my Momma never told a lie she said I'd wind up dead
I'm runnin' on adrenaline
I'm headed for another sin
Just tell 'em get out my way

This time is my own and tomorrow I'll be gone
I won't stop 'til I take the stage
And now I'm not alone so the feeling will live on
I won't stop 'til I take the stage

Where I belong, I'll find the place before too long,
Known since I was born, up there in lights where I belong

This time is my own and tomorrow I'll be gone
I won't stop 'til I take the stage
And now I'm not alone so the feeling will live on
I won't stop 'til I take the stage

Where I belong, I'll find the place before too long,
Known since I was born, up there in lights where I belong
