A war to possess your body and mind
Affordable lies robbing you blind
Deciding what you should revere
Power decay feeding your fear

I want you to listen
And heed my dangerous words
And so you will witness the dawn

Irreverent
(Won't pay respect not earned)

Mirrors reflect an illusive dream
Work hard and pray you'll be redeemed
Your name is next for the sacrifice
Ready to pay the ultimate price

I want you to listen
And heed my treacherous words
And so you, will witness the dawn

Irreverent
(Won't pay respect not earned)

In truth you do hold no real merit
It's for show it's just a show

Irreverent
(Won't pay, respect, not earned)
