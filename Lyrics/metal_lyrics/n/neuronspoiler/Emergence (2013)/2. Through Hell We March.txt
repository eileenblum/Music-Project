We've traveled this road for as long as we remember
And chased it on to the dawn of forever
Heeding the call we are the chosen few
Break down the wall and follow us through

Never doubting for one minute
That we would conquer all our fears
So now we sing aloud in celebration

Never bow to the blade
Stand and fight, seal your fate

Through Hell we march

Steel is our strength together we are brothers
We conquer all â to hell with the others
Don't let them sway from what you know is true
We hold the course our spirit renewed

Never doubting for one minute
That we would conquer all our fears
So now we sing aloud in celebration

Never bow to the blade
Stand and fight, seal your fate

Through Hell we march

Never doubting for one minute
That we would conquer all our fears
So now we sing aloud in celebration

Never bow to the blade
Stand and fight, seal your fate

Through Hell we march
