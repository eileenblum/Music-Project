You get your fix
Degrading us mortals for fun
But you should know
Your lordship, you stand on your own

Glamour devotion attention's a must
Longing, belonging to a life of illusion
Shallow and distant and soul-less to those all around
That is why you are

Just a fool on your way up
But some day you are coming down

Your main strengths
Achievements that won't pass the test
So you should stay away
And look at your life through your waste

Misleading, indulging, deluding yourself
Open your eyes, feel the pain you're creating
shallow and distant and soul-less to those all around
Forever you shall be

Just a fool on your way up
But some day you are coming down

Just a fool on your way up
But some day you are coming down

All the way down
