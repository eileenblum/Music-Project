I've been fooled by dirty thieves
Caged within these walls of steel
I have vowed to take revenge
Broken dreams I will amend

Never had to run
What I did was for you son
and I will prove them wrong
I have changed, my will is strong

Take you along for the ride
Reach out your hand, touch the sky

I am the invincible man

From the day that I was born
I could see the setting sun
Now the moment has arrived
Hold my breath and close my eyes

Swear that I will be
Never conquered and always free
Hell, give me fire
So my wings can take me high

Take you along for the ride
Reach out your hand, touch the sky

I am the invincible man

Rescue me, rescue me
I am the invincible man
Rescue me, rescue me
