Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever loose the need to prove myself
Always wanting more, always unhappy with all around me
Never willing to accept a world of emptiness and falseness
And feeling there must be someone who feels the same somewhere, someway

It's been many years chasing for something
Trying to find the place where I belong to
All I've ever wanted was to go home
But this is a place I've never known.

I tried so hard to make things change 'til it was the time to stop it all
I realise there is no point in trying to change the narrow minded
So I've gotta find my people, I know they will embrace me
As if they were receiving a lost brother

It's been many years chasing for something
Trying to find the place where I belong to
All I've ever wanted was to go home
But this is a place I've never known.
