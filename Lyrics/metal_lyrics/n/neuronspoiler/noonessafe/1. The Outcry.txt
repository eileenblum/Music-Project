Years and years building up such anger hard to contain
Discontent with a world that will never understand
He has chosen to take his chance always living on the edge
No second thoughts 'cause after all, well, no one's safe

And a cold sweat starts running down his neck
'Cause he's feeling the danger out there, waiting to be faced
Again, again and again

It's the point of no return
Time to stand to the future
Not accepting anymore
This is the outcry!

He's in no need of any praise, got it all deep inside
Revolt, confront, reject, defy; to no rule he will abide
Considered profane, considered a threat; hundred bullets got his name
He knows he's pushed his luck to the limit, eager to see what's beyond

The establishment shall never get him in its ranks.
