Not so many hours in the day life just slips away
Still I'm here wasting precious time with your same old argument
Showing off is the way you get your point across
Firing false eloquence to say even the simplest thing

Cut the crap
Tell it straight
To the point
Get it right
In your head

Words, words, words
I've just had enough
How worthless is to listen
You do make me bored

So easy to open the mouth and make all sound big
The truth is you end up with expectations you can't fulfill
Just realise that facts speak louder than whatever you say
'Less is more' works better when understanding is the aim

Cut the crap
Just get on
With the task
Get it right
In your face!
