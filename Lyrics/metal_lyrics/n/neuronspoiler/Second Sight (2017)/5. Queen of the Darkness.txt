It's not enough for you to see the fire
And yearn to feel the heat
You must step inside engulfed by the flames
To know that you're alive

There's a quiet voice inside of you
That bravely whispers on
It's haunts your dreams and takes control
But you're right where you belong

There's the hint of madness in the air
And it whispers secrets you can't share
Feel the fire burning deep inside
As she takes you on your final ride

Queen of the darkness
Bane of the light
Be my temptress
Bring me the night

Ashes burn in the witch's urn
As she recites and cries your name
A little girl so powerful
To her it's just a game

I've been cruel enough times now to know
My reality is torn
The siren calls you to your death
Consider yourself warned

There's the hint of madness in the air
And it whispers secrets you can't share
Feel the fire burning deep inside
As she takes you on your final ride

Queen of the darkness
Bane of the light
Be my temptress
Bring me the night

Queen of the darkness
Bane of the light
Be my temptress
Bring me the night

Queen of the darkness
Bane of the light
Be my temptress
Bring me the night

Queen of the darkness
Bane of the light
Be my temptress
Bring me the night
