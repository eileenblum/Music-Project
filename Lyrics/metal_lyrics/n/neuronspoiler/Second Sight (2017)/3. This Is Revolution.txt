Calling all denizens, prepare for judgement day
Guardians of the lies will answer for their ways
Profiteers of deceit, reveal themselves at last
Ghostly descendants of echoes from the past

I will return, to clear my name
Your tears will burn... burn again

This is revolution
Against
Self-destruction

Modern day slavery imposed upon the meek
Media selling fear, persecute the weak
Plastic distractions here but empathy so rare
No longer will endure, war has been declared

I will return, to clear my name
Your tears will burn... burn again

This is revolution
Against
Self-destruction

This is revolution
Against
Self-destruction
