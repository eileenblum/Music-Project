Hey you!
Who constantly breathes a scent of distrust
Always in the air
You try hard but you find something's
Just out of reach
Something's constantly in the way
I know how you're feeling left out
Let down and sold out
Things don't look up, don't work out
Systematically ruined, you blame yourself or
Could it be someone else behind this?

Items undisclosed
Fear, suspicion, hate
Don't ever listen to
The mouth without a face

For there's a hidden agenda
It's not to understand, you're no fit
For the hidden agenda
Take your place, stay away
From the hidden agenda

We're so used to rumours of fishy tales
And somehow those tales still have an echo today
The new world order, circles of power, ancient sects
You've heard them all
People might say I rebel without hour cause
But the cause is out of sight, out of mind
Still I want to know how on earth do we learn
To accept unacceptable

Items undisclosed
Fear, suspicion, hate
Don't ever listen to
The mouth without a face

For there's a hidden agenda
It's not to understand, you're no fit
For the hidden agenda
Take your place, stay away
From the hidden agenda

Is there someone there
Not willing to share
What we ought to know
He's messing 'round with our heads
Is there someone there
Who hides from the rest
And thinks he's in charge
Of our own destinies?

Hey you!
I'll see you on the day when we make them
Face the music
We'll remove every mask
We'll take down any crafty, anonymous,
Spineless puppeteer!

Items undisclosed
Fear, suspicion, hate
Don't ever listen to
The mouth without a face

For there's a hidden agenda
It's not to understand, you're no fit
For the hidden agenda
Take your place, stay away
From the hidden agenda
