One path for us all
Behind unbreakable walls
Barbed wire from side to side
In an endless queue to death

Blood, tears and lifeless bodies
As far as the eye can see
They wash your spirit away
And drain your vital force

Locked under surveillance
By the keepers of the path
Watched by cameras day and night
You'll be lucky to survive

People forget about this
It's the only way they've known
No one can see beyond the wall
We're cattle going to slaughterhouse

Don't let 'em decide
Reclaim your path

Everyone tries their best
To pursue the same goal
Same leaders, same lies
And no reward left in the end

Some try to escape this
By climbing over the wall
They're trapped without redemption
Just like cattle going to the slaughterhouse

One by one we'll do our part
Making little cracks in the wall
May the light guide our new path
Let's taste the flavour of freedom

Don't let 'em decide
Reclaim your path
