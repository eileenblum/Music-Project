Jesse was a pour boy, he died the way he lived
Sleeping on the back streets for a
Couple packs a day
Caught between the shadows of corporate
Heavyweights
Scrape him off your shoe on your way to work

Won't you miss me you give it away
Give it away, give it away
Murder city you give it away
Give it away, give it away

Then they came for everything that dare remain
A generation, a nation of human ammunition
Locked and loaded, the wrong survive
Only if you let it, what will you choose

Won't you miss me you give it away
Give it away, give it away
Murder city you give it away
Give it away, give it away

Won't you miss me you give it away
Give it away, give it away
Murder city you give it away
Give it away, give it away
