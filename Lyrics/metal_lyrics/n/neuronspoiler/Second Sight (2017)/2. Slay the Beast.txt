Time will steal your days without mercy
So prepare your farewell
I am here to take what I know is
Mine by right through history

Am I strong enough?
Am I brave enough?
Am I tough enough?
To reach the truth within

All I know, I learned from your graces
Now I'll write my chapter
You're the same or don't you remember
Like me you were once a promise

Are you strong enough?
Are you brave enough?
Are you tough enough?
To reach the truth within

I'm here to slay the beast
Kindness will not hold my hand
Legacy of dust and sand
Slay the beast
Weakness will not hold my hand
Legacy of dust and sand
Slay the beast

Time will hold on to the truth, when we will see
Through your lies
For years a devotee, abandoned with such ease
You'll never bring me down
Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown...

Yes, I'm strong enough
And I'm brave enough
Yes, I'm tough enough
To reach the truth within

I'm here to slay the beast
Kindness will not hold my hand
Legacy of dust and sand
Slay the beast
Weakness will not hold my hand
Legacy of dust and sand
Slay the beast
