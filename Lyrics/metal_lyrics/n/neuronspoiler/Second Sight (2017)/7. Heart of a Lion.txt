Crashing through the city streets
Caught in the glare of the midnight sun
I've got wings upon my feet
But locked as I run

Now you're just a breath away
From knocking me senseless to the ground
No escape I hear you say
You're never safe from a

Heart, heart of a lion
Heart, heart of a lion

I close my eyes I see your face
Seems like I'm trapped inside your spell
Will I ever win this race
You're moving in

Hear my name cried from the sky
There is a thrill that cuts the air
In your hold, I know that I
Will never find the love from a

Heart, heart of a lion
Heart, heart of a lion

All around I hear the sound
Of your mighty roar
As I hear the thunder
You are calling out for more

All around I hear the sound
Of your mighty roar
As I hear the thunder
You are crying

Heart, of a lion
Heart, of a lion
Cold heart, of a lion
Heart of a lion
Cold heart, of a lion
Cold heart, of a lion
Cold heart, of a lion
