Day by day, all the same, I can't wake from dreaming
Of a time, when my mind, will overcome these feelings
To betray, what they say about what's right and wrong
Follow rules, we're all fools until the day we're gone

The snake encircles, coiling 'round my eye
The venom surges, inside

Here lies the brave one, humble and true
Destitute victim, pray it's not you

In this game, just a name, that's all we're really worth
Flesh and bone, blood and stone upon this wretched earth
Like a child, run and hide, the future's insecure
Speak the truth, here's the proof your message will endure

The snake encircles, coiling 'round my eye
The venom surges, inside

Here lies the brave one, humble and true
Destitute victim, pray it's not you

Here lies the brave one, humble and true
Destitute victim, pray it's not you
