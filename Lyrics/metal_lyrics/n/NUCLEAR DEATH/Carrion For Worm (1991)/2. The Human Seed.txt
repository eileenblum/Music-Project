I planted a row of fetus this morning
found them in the garbage behind a clinic
I grow impatient after a week of waiting
they have yet to show sign of growth
I gave them vitamins and gave them my feces.
and yet they remain unseen...

I dig them up but I find only one.
and I planted six - six - six
the fetus is black and covered in all manner of insect.
I cannot harvest this fungus covered meat
I notice that it has been set upon by small teeth
and I notice rifts in the dirt where the other five
burrowed away...

I realize now where I went wrong.
too many vitamins and not enough of my feces
but alas it is too late...for they have returned
they woke me so they could eat
And all I ever wanted was to raise children of my own.
My father must have pulled me too early from the ground...
