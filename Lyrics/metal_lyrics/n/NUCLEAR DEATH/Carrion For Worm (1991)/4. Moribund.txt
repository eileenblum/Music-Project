No one plays here
they see only darkness
and when I eat with my friends
I can smell them...

Sometimes my friend leaves
and I'm alone with them...
So I wonder among the corpses
until I find the smell I crave...
it's lying on it's stomach
backside in the air...
it's a male, but my hardness doesn't care...
I thrust and enter and there are no objections...

Sometimes my friend finds me atop of a corpse
and he threatens to take away my hardness
but then he shows me his hardness
and we are friend again...

No one plays here
they see only darkness
and in the morgue when all is still
I run among the corpses, barking...
