Little boy with little penis
plays his organ in the dark;
his lust will forever be
with the feces of his homosexual lovers;
the boy will forever dine
on the feces of his homosexual lovers;
Little boy, perverted boy
don't grow up--- just die...

I've always been with him
in the dark, out of sight...
all these years he's sickened me
he's gone the way of the 'fairy'...
he's come out of the closet
and he's tasted his lover's penis
after it's been in his own anus...
the bastard sickens me--- I must leave...

So this is how the tale ends:
A boy grows up to be a man
who loves other men by way of anus...
and the monster in the closet comes out and leaves
taking with him the fairy man's penis
...feading it to the first hungry dog he finds...
"Wake up fairy man, your corpse smells..."
