A dog playing in garbage
an image of hyenas and detahs leftovers;
a dog plying with a dead fish
found admidst the debris...

He smells the air -
the juices of the spoiled fish
the sour garbage and the sex of the dog...
As the sky turns to dark
he follows the dog by way of alleys.
He has an erection...

He rises up out of the dirt
and he pretends to breathe
the beuty of the setting sun
brings a depraved glamour to his night...

He is the corpse that kissed the leper
and pulled away with the lepers tongue.
He was seen by the roadside
fucking something dead...

It rises upout of the dirt
and it pretends to breathe
It is the corpse of a dog
and it is pregnant...

Children playing in garbage
an image of hyenas and death leftovers;
Children with tails and coarse hair
barking at something dead...
