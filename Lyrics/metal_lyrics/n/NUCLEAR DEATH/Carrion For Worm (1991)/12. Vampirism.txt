I tell myself
vampires do not exist
but the woman took me to her world
and blessed me with her toungue
then I came to my senses
and became aware of my surroundings

torches cast light upon the many skulls
dried viscera adorned the walls
and a disemboweled little boy smiled at me
and I knew he was food...

the woman and I then laid upon her lords tomb
and I was inside her
giving the old thing life
and her vagina had teeth!

At first there is nothing
only the dark, the unknowing
... not even the pain
then my eyes opened
and I was aware-
aware of my padded surroundings...
the woman did not kill me
even worse she let me live
and I remember all to well
HER VAGINA HAD TEETH!
