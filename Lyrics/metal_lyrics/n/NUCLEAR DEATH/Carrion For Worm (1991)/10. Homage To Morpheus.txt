Look at me... is the world still here?
Has it changed from blue to black?
There are many holes which cover my body
I need more veins...
Will no one remember me?
the way I cry and shake and tremble
the way I smell of sour mold
the pale tissue which portrays my flesh...

Will anyone remember me?
the way I moan and beg for more
the way I sell myself for money
so many diseases call my body home
Look at me... is the earth still here?
Has it changed from blue to black?
there are many scabs which cover my body
WHERE ARE MY FUCKING NEEDLES?!

Praise to the syringe
and praise to the almighty heroine
for thine is the kingdom of filth
the power of illusion
and the glory of worthlessness...
... forever and ever...
