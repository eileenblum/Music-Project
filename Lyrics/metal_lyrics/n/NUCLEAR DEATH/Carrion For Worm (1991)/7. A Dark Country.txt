Radiation's children taken by the hand
and led to darkness
Chemically wasted warriors roam the land
in search of madness
What's left of freedom matters no more
death is always here
In the world of darkness and death
innocence lives in fear...

Salvation is lost, death is god
faith is damnation
Radiation's children taken by the hand
and burnt to blackness
Whats left of life exists no more
death is always here
World of darkness. world of the dead
will rise...
