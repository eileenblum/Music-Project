The corpse of the little girl
shimmed beneath the dim glow
of the green light hanging above her...
we six tried to bring her back
with our minds -
channeling our energies
into her still-moist lifeless form...

...but we are only human
and we have no spectacular abilities
so instead we ate her
to make her part of us...
