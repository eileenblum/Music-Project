Stare in silent disbelief
As the walls come crashing down on me
Lost a brother, lost a friend
Lost a life that came to early end
All that's left are memories
Visions of one I can no longer reach
Filled with violent suffering
All your demons are making their way into me

I fight this battle. I face this war
I curse the hands of death
As they're knocking at my door

Emptiness, loneliness, helplessness, I crave relief

Will it come to me?

Day by day by day
The void you left doesn't go away
I feel the pain that you felt
And now I'm trapped in this living hell

I wear the stains from your pain on the edge of my sleeve
I feel the weight of the world, left with nothing

Left with nothing
This won't be the death of me
These scars won't fade away
