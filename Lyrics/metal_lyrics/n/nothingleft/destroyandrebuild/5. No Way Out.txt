All we know are bitter thoughts
Crooked smiles and crooked hearts
Spreading hate to ease the pain
Another slave to the system

They've drawn lines in the sand
And told us who to trust
Rejecting all that is different
It fills me with disgust

This silent indifference
We can never escape
Frozen in fear
Shackled and chained to our past mistakes

There's no way out
Our hands are stained
There's no way out
If it just stays the same

There's no way out
There's no way out

Death takes us all
Witness the downfall

Born into a broken world
We are the swine that
Have swallowed the pearls
We abandon the things
We have sworn to defend
Watch it fall apart in the end

Born into a broken world
Left in this broken world

All we know are bitter thoughts
Crooked smiles and crooked hearts
Spreading hate to ease the pain
Another slave to the system

Another slave to the system
We're all just slaves to the system
