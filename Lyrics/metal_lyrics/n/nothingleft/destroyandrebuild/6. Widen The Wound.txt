Worn down
Dismayed
Ripping at the seams
I'm torn apart

My hope is torn apart
Embrace the pain

Stabbed in the back
By the ones that I used to trust
This is a downward spiral
Embrace the pain

Once again
I'm overwhelmed by ignorance
It widens the wound until it consumes
What's left of our innocence

The sand is always shifting
Another season of endless decline
Lower down still sinking (Sinking!)
Buried alive

Fight for survival
Don't live in denial
Fight for survival
Don't live in denial

I will never trust humanity again

Lost hope in humanity
Widen the wound
Lost hope in humanity
Watch it consume
What's left of our innocence

Lost hope in humanity
Lost hope in humanity
