Choke down every word they say
They speaking poison
Lie to get what's left to give
A promise means nothing

Watch as the cycle repeats

Close your eyes
Fall in line
A flawed design
To keep us silent
Through the noise
From the void
Raise your voice
Eternal defiance

Land of the free
Lost in decay

Tearing us down to
Build themselves up
When is enough
Finally enough?

Tearing us down to
Build themselves up
When is enough
Finally enough to-

Choke down every word they say
They speaking poison
Lie to get what's left to give
A promise means nothing

Death will always follow you
Death will always follow you
Death will always follow you
When you tip the scales of justice!

A promise means nothing

Death will always follow you
Death will always follow you
Death will always follow you
A promise means nothing!
