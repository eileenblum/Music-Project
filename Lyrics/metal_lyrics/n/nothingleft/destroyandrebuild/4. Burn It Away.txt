Burn it away

Screaming at the sky
The black cloud appears again
I didn't see your face
I caught your stench in the wind

Will I break or fall apart?
I'm out of control
Peeling back the flesh to see
All that is left of my soul
This pain is haunting me
Haunting

This waged war
It burns in me
This waged war
It still remains

Burn it away
Burn it away

We're not the same
I am not the failure
That my father has become
Two paths remain:
Make the change or
Refuse and die alone
Refuse and die alone

Oh
When I look in the mirror
I'm disgusted by the face I see
All the pieces of you
Reflected in me

I will shed the dead weight
I won't carry this guilt to my grave

Shed the dead weight
I won't carry this guilt to my grave
Shed the dead weight
I won't carry this guilt to my grave
