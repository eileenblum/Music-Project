Rage consuming the light I have
Slipping away. It's slipping away

Separate these shades of black
Lost in the memories
Of a broken past that holds me back
Tear out the hooks of regret

Sever the ties
See through the lies
Destroy and rebuild

Separate from the world outside
I'm pulled deeper into my shame
Left alone, I'll never find a way
To dig myself out of the grave

Afraid of what I'd become
Another failure that's running from
A past I can never erase. Wasted days
Sever the ties and rebuild

Constant suffering
Reminds me of what I used to be
A past I can never erase. Wasted days
Sever the ties and rebuild
...and rebuild, and rebuild

This is where light and dark collide
Shattering memories that plague my mind
There is no turning back
