HvaÃ° er meÃ° Ã¡sum?
HvaÃ° er meÃ° Ã¡lfum?
GnÃ½r allr jÃ¶tunheimr,
Ã¦sir ru Ã¡ Ã¾ingi,
stynja dvergar
fyr steindurum,
veggbergs vÃ­sir;
vituÃ° Ã©r enn, eÃ°a hvaÃ°?

Surtr ferr sunnan
meÃ° sviga lÃ¦vi,
skÃ­nn af sverÃ°i
sÃ³l valtÃ­va;
grjÃ³tbjÃ¶rg gnata
en gÃ­fr rata,
troÃ°a halir helveg
en himinn klofnar.

[Past]

How is it with the Ãsir?
How with the Alfar?
All JÃ¶tunheim resounds;
the Ãsir are in council.
The dwarfs groan before their stony doors,
the sages of the rocky walls. Understand ye yet, or what?

Surt from the south
comes with flickering flame;
shines from his sword the Val-gods' sun.
The stony hills are dashed together,
the giantesses totter;
men tread the path of Hel, and heaven is cloven.
