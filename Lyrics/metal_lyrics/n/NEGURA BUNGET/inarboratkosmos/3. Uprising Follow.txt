I wring the secret out of my body...

Drowned in the unknown of this Black Sea,
My forever swallowed body,
Whirling grows to my deepest fright
Into the darkest depths of nothingness

I dip my head into the water,
The pressure that drains my shape,
Pushes me away beyond my limits,
Pulls me back in the warmth of the known.

...I strike away...
but my twin is rising...
...and vibrating together
With the diaphanous flow.

Splashes in a thousand drops of awareness
Oceans dragging me together,
Washing away all fates
And all that could ever be.

I look at the great well of the universe,
Where my body lies still hanging.
My visceral seethes are sweating.
Dissolving tissue in this pain
Through living, roughs become alighted.
Liquefying my subtle substance,
From stone to flesh
And flesh through wit.

The steam is tearing out of me.
The vapors are breathed 
Into the plasma's newly born cavity,
With enlightened viscosity.

In the womb of Kosmos
A glistening hoard has been woven...
A virgin ethereal globule springing
In a pneumatic living.
Heir of an old heredity,
Heightening until the Octahedron is gliding
The final step into the uprising follows.
