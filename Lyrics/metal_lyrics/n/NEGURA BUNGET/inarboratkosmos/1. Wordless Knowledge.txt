Sol Ler Sol
Sol Argent
Sol Flu
Sol Faur Alchimia

My eyes were glimmering behind the mirror
As my face still stands in front of myself.
I change the worlds, I switch the lights.
An unspoken rule lies beneath my will
To shield my silence from within

Crossed is the space from within.
Between my mind's concentricity and beyond,
From there the great unknown is purling!
I turned to left my sense of seeing
Where drawling dwells in dull stillness
I felled awake into profundity
In a thoughtless perennial state.

A gentle wind drifting me to the other side
Makes my soul wander through the ancient stones,
Under the hermits of old reigns,
Sought visions enriched my wisdom
Through Sabian symbols I step and gain
The maturation of my aim.

I Crest the Strength,
Into the Depth of Kosmic Tree
And as I Stand, in Front of Me
Universe's Hollow Swallows Me
I Watch Within, the Depth of Me
And as I Stand, so Close with Me
My Eye's Trans-lucid
I am One With Myself.
