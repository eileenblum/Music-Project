Surviving the architecture of God 
I lay low in the mountains of eternal darkness 
Confused by my physical existence 
Illuminated by betrayal 

Let me transcend 
To the beyond 
Awaken by unholy self 
And end this pestilence 

Save me from this false doctrine 
Of religion 
Anguished by the dogma of ancient philosophy 

Unholy wings of death 
Fuck your holy flesh 

Behold the second coming of nemesis 
And you will no longer will be worshipped 

Unholy wings of death 
Fuck your holy flesh 

Save me from the false doctrine of religion 
Anguished by the dogma of ancient philosophy
