I born of seven dimensioned hell 
Bleed the agony 
I who manifest the planetary circles 
And don't exist in duality 

Do not speak to me of his existence 
He is just a lie hiding behind morality 

I born of nectar of paradise 
Free from slavery 
And the circle of life and death 
That loops all your sufferings 

The forests whispers 
The name of the one 
Lingering in the shadows 
Of great mountains 

I float weightless 
In the spirits of crimson skies 
Talking to the winds 
Away from the sun 

uneasiness of the dawn 
Inglorious serpent 
Move away against 
All our howls
