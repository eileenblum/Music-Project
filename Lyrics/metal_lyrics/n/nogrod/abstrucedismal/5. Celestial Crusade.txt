Destroy the glory of the heavens 
Nectar of immoral race 
A supreme ruler 
Deserves heavenly reign 

Let my golden chariot 
Tear you apart 
Let my sharpest arrow 
Pierce your heart 

Let the sorrow spread in four direction when I'll rule the underworlds 

Let my golden chariot tear you apart 
Let my sharpest arrow piece your heart 

Let this plague of lies end 
And the era of knowledge begin 

Destroy the glory of the heavens 
Nectar of immortal race 
A supreme ruler 
Deserve the heavenly reign
