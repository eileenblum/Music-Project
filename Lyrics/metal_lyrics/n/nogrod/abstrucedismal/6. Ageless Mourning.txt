When the earth burns 
By morally blind 
Where is your messianic presence 
When I only see violence 

In the name of God 
In the name of religion 
My eyes wet the earth 
Waiting for submission 

A thousand bodies I see 
In front of me 
Where is your morality 
Where is your humanity 

Open your eyes to see the everlasting illusion 
The multi dimensional truth that holds your flesh and bones 

In the name of God 
In the name of religion 
My eyes wet the earth 
Waiting for submission 

A thousand bodies I see 
I front of me 
Where I'd your morality 
Where is your humanity
