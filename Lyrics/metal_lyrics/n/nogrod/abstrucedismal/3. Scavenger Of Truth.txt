Innocence in the mind of a common man 
Is his eternal sin 
Devastated by the storm of corruption 
Laid waste in our believes 

Raped , murdered and tortured 
Still our hands are tied by the so called law 

Witness this mental degradation of humanity 
Open your eyes to see this obscene reality 

Invade the fire 
You'll not burn
