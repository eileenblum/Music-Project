Contagious Pain, serve the empty truth.
Warm Blood drains out the body.
Impetuos day to die again
I sense this fall, feels like
loosing the Soul.
Obscurate mind, Obscure is blind.
Cold dead hands find, lock your body.
Turn into Night, broke in pieces,
in this Unlife feels like
loosing the Soul.
Control effect reality fed to your fail brain.
Mind control, insanity, is poisoning you.
Pre-made pills of fantasy straight into your dead brain.
Your weakness creates supremacies, they`re poisoning you.
Decomposing died in vane, funeral of mankind.
Lethal doses of endless Pain, is poisoning you.
Fear behind your destiny Fear into you dead brain
Fear as Chains for humanity, is poisoning you
