Consume Control, suffer your fate.
You're hatefull and brainwashed, unconscious slave.
I am turning Rot as our life dwells in Misery.
The world ends, you see Misery, Death.
Trapped like rats in cages of gold.
I am turning Rot as our life dwells in Misery.
A sea of Lies, a sea of Death. A sea of Lies, a sea of Blood.
In my Hands, in my Eyes, through the Veins.
I am turning Rot as our life dwells in Misery.
