My soul will descend into darkness.
I erased my time before time.
Breathing machine, I became senseless.
Breathing machine, holding hands with the
End of all.

Inhale.
Exhale.

Hopeless.
Soulless.
In endless pain, merciless like war.
Breathing machine, I became stronger.
Breathing machine, holding hands with the
End of all.

Abortion of society,
Neglected son of a cunt.
Forgotten child of the dark,
To be able to see, he blinds his eyes.

Inward, seek inward.
Seek within yourself.
Reverse your eyes,
To be able to see you must die...

Break me.
To rebirth, you have to die.
Break me.
To rebirth you have to suffer.
It's a struggle of the senses
From the moment you were born.
Unlearn all you think you know.
Progression is forgetting all.

Breathing machine, I became senseless.
Breathing machine, holding hands with the
End of all.
