Seeking the right path,
Walking through the unknown.
Spirit reaches farther,
Wanderers of hell accept the darkness.
Growing old, a broken stone
Carved with my name, it awaits.

Beneath the graveyard,
Beneath the graves.
Enter the wasteland of souls.

Underneath the lower level where no light
Shines.
Buried alive was my body
And bones are all that is left.
Now where darkness dwells, my remains are
Turning into dust.

Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

No need for redemption
We're going back to the grave,
Back to the grave.

Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

We're going back to the grave.
No life matters more, beneath the world.

Beneath the graveyard,
Under the graves.
Welcome to wasteland of souls.

Why are your hands cold?
Why don't you smile?
We can't get hurt
Now that we have died.
So if the wind blows
Beneath we hide.
We won't get old,
We will survive.
Why are your hands cold?
Why don't you smile?
Beneath we'll hide.
Beneath.
