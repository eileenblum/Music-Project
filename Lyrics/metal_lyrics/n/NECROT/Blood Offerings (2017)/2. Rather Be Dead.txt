Night comes,
Break the light that was day.
Empty space in our mind
Keeps us awake.
From sorrow we run,
If into the shadows we'll fall
Leave us, 'cause we would rather be dead

Than alive in this world.
And you! Wouldn't you rather be dead?

Loss awaits, hiding behind a face you trust.
A voice you've heard,
A thousand times before.
To die for what you live for.
Another day, another time awaits you. Wouldn't
You rather be dead?

Than alive in this world.
You! Wouldn't you rather be dead?

To feel, you bite, the rain.
Your mind, now craves the pain.
Your face, is turned away.
A life, you can't embrace.

Time will erase.
Crossing through.
Suffering pain.

You! Wouldn't you rather be dead, than alive in
This world?
You! Wouldn't you rather be dead?
