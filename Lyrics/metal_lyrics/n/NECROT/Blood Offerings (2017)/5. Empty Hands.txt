I know. I have been.
I have seen how it always ends.
Rotting, growing old.
Certainty of being deceived.

Fire burns the world.
Fear is leading the way.
Dreams are turning into dust.
Left me with empty hands, with empty hands.

A torture, a nightmare is life.
Losing all, a chase with no escape.
Life you believed, now you grieve.
Certainty of being deceived.

Fire, burns the world.
Fear, is leading the way.
Dreams are turning into dust.
Left me with empty hands, with empty hands.

Am I? Am I still awake?
Am I screaming in vane?
Bound by a lie, we die.

[Solo: Reinhardt]

Are we? Are we human?
Words don't seem to be enough to cut through you.
Spilling blood to drain you.
Hate consumes us.
The masters spread it.
We turn on each other,
But we are all the same.

[Solo: Reinhardt]

Fire, burns the world.
Fear, is leading the way.
Dreams are turning into dust.
Left me with empty hands, with empty hands.
