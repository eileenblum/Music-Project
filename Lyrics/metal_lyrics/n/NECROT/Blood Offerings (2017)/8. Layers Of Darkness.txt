A crown of nails on your head,
A crown of gold on mine.
An army at my command,
Nothing in your hands.

No one to protect you,
No one will save your soul.
God is a lie I invented,
A poison for you all.

In a totality of hate
To keep your thoughts in fear,
I set you against each other.
My work is done, the end is near.

Layers of darkness cover the sky.

You're sinking in your own blood,
I bathe in liquid gold.
Playing with your little lives
Makes me feel like God.

Puppets in my hands, you are.
I crush you with my hate.
I use you as I want and please.
Gracefully enslaved.

Bow to us, we dominate.
Obey or die in pain.
It's natural selection.
We rule and you obey.

Layers of darkness cover the sky.

Born to die in pain.
Consume, obey
And bleed serving the machine.
Serving the machine.
When you are the meal for predators,
Get used to being the prey.
Trapped into a maze.
Death will come, don't be afraid.

No one wants to see.
All attached to lies.
When the infection spreads,
People start to die.

We belong in the absence of light.
Craving the absence of life.
We rejoice in the past.
We are seduced by the emptiness
Of what is lost.
Now this nothing is all that we have.
