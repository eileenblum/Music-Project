Blood!
From man to man.
From night 'til the sun, will rise again.
Can you see the end?
Of all that you hold close to your heart?

Blood offerings, like water spills red.
Freeze time, observe the world falling into
Darkness.
Blood offerings, as it burst into flames.
All that you thrived for is taken away.
Blood offerings, a fight 'til the end.
Sacrifice you owe to time.

Blood!
From man to man.
From night 'til the sun will rise again.
Can you see the end?
Of all that you hold close to your heart?

Blood offerings, resisting the threat.
Shaking in fear, you're already dead.
Close to the end, divided we'll bring emptiness
Forward.
Blood offerings.

Fear
Set us apart.
