Nothing but shadows and light.
Nothing more than someone else's thought.
When you close your eyes, you'll be gone life will still flow.

Shadows and light, nothing more than shadows and light.
We are dead.

For what you perceive of time,
for what your eyes can see,
for what your heart can understand
therefore you believe you exist.

Heavy the weight
of all that we carry with us.
We stand and face
the eternal curse.
Ready to die,
we never hoped for more.
Ready to die,
bring us back
into the shadows.

Shadows and light, nothing more than shadows and light.
We are dead.
