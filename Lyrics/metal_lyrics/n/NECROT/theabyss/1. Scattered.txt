Scattered, broken pieces
Worn out by miseries of this world
Too old, too old to die
Why must we rot? Why must we die?
Scattered broken pieces
Worn out by misiries of my soul
Too old, too old to die
Why must we rot? Why must we die?
Cursed forever, forever cursed
Cursed forever, forever cursed
There for the creation of broken bones and lies
Forever will last the anger
Brothers of infection, our destinies are one
Fragments of light scattered we are
