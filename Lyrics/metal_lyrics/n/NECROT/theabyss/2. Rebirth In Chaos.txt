Death to this world
The sea of tears is crossed
Emptied through time my spirit vanished
Lost humans leaving in chaos
Blind from birth won't strive to see are we really meant to be?
Servants of time, born in chains, morbid human nightmare
As the night takes us all we are causing a ruckus
In blood we were born we will rebirth in chaos
Eternal life your morbid nightmare, your spirit rises lifeless
Leaving in chaos, guided by fear, rebirth in chaos
In chains I was bron, I will rebirth in chaos
