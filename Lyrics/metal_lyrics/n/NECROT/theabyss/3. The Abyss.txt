Morning falls, awaits for the call
Endless time till the day comes
When you die you leave behind the bones in a hole and then carry on
Dead sky take me away, why've you left me here alone in the dark?
Dying soul will you ever forget this world?
The people you leave in this nothingness
In the abyss all is gone, in the abyss you die
In the abyss all is gone, in the abyss you live
