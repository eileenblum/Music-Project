Nothing is yours, nothing is mine, nothing.
What is forever? Everything dies in this world.
Plague of fools, of selfish minds. We fear. the end.
The End awaits for all. The circle ties. Is it our turn to die?
Imperialistic darkness = Reality. We trust lies.
We hate each other. We`re men in fear. We deny the end.
The End is calling you. The circle ties. Is it your turn to die?
We crave destruction. We`re spoiled brats. We eat shit. We drink death.
Dead eyes, nothing left, you go to sleep you`ll wake up dead.
Lost in a spiral of pleasure and pain, the fear cold will freeze the veins.
Love is a poison we drink to forget. Your shadow is chasing yourself.
Suffering intensified for the ones who fear the End.
Rise or Rot.
