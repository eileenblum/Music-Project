Into the Labyrinth of insanity, hard is to see light, hard is to breath.
Into the Labyrinth of society, the world is infected. Hate as disease.
Suicide she chose suicide. She dies, we`re dying, she dies.
Into the Labyrinth of insecurity, stolen perceptions, drifting from dreams.
Into the Labyrinth of yourself, can you be the master of your own destiny?
Suicide she chose suicide. She dies, we`re dying, she dies.
No way out, too late, could n`t find a way to escape the Labyrinth. Darkness took her away.
Into the Labyrinth. Into the Labyrinth. Lost in the Labyrinth. Into the Labyrinth.
Into the Labyrinth of your self, can you be the master of your own destiny?
