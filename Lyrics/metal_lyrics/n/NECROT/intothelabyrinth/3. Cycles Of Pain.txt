Death storm. Frightening sky. Tear apart we lost our minds, hope, time,desire of light.
In the dark we rest, we wait. We all pay to die. We`re so far when grief divides.
Everyday alive but dead inside we fade away. This world is dust, Cycles of pain.
Wading through blood, your own. Spilled through life in vain. Our price the air.
We all pay to die. We can`t avoid the night to come. Fear divides
Everyday alive but dead inside you fade away, this world is dust, Cycles of pain
Everyday alive but dead inside you fade away, this life, dust, Cycles of pain
Open your eyes. The Dead awakes. A new day. Cycles of pain.
