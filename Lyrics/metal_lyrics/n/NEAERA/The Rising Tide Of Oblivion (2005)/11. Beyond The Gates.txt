I'll make you bleed for
What others have done to me
Words are written on my tongue
Scars of torment carved into each corner of my dying mind
Inhabited by self-hatred
The day has ceased to breathe
Night no longer sleeps
Words unable to express
This loss of dignity
Inflicted by your ignorance
Countdown is set for the implosion
A million hands that maim my feelings
And put out the dying light
By fear forever haunted
Watched by lying eyes
No returning from what you made of me
I'll reach out and drag you down with me
