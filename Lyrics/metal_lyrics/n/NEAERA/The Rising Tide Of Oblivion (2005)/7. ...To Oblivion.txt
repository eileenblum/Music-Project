There are vast oceans of flames in me
Ruling me, penetrating me
Letting me speak
But I can't scream no more
Can't you hear my thundering silence?
Can't you hear my silent screams?
They're so loud
Where have you been roaming lately?
Have I seen you passing by?
Or has it only been your shadow&amp;?
Let in some hot cold water
And take a short bath in your wasteland
Embrace this rush
Enjoy the phases
Can't you hear my thundering silence?
Can't you hear my silent screams?
They're so loud
It's here and now
It won't stay forever
How come I've been carried away to these shores?
How come you're not here?
Have I expected you in vain?
