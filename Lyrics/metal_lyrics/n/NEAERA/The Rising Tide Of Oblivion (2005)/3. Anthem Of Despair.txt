Starting slowly, globally unnoticed, ignored
Plans are made to add another black chapter to history
Condemned to an ocean of shame
A lunacy beyond my empathy
First blood
The beginning
A civil war
The first dead night in Rwanda
A nations' eye is installed
A prophet of peace and justice
His eyes are sharp, but his hands are bound
Hate of the past grew between the two tribes
Soon all hell should rise
"Exterminate!" they shout
(An entire people to be erased???)
The beast in man was unleashed, in ecstasy of blood
(Eight hundred thousand were brutally murdered and slaughtered)
In just a hundred days
