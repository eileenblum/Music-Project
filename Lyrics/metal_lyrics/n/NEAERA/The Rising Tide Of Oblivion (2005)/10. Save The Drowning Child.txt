If thoughts were tears...
Are you sick of yearning?
This invisible fortress, this isolation
Is your heart's cancer
There's no reason hiding
Your great walls of self-defense
Pull them all down
No need to retreat
Your great walls of insecurity
Pull them all down
Listen to what isn't said
See what is not shown
Learn this language free from words
Don't be deceived
Becoming numb
Is the sound of decay
Self-censorship and deadening only false friends
There's no reason hiding
Your great walls of self-defense
Pull them all down
Remaining forever thoughtful
A curse?
No!
It's the bold star to reach out for
This is the path of prosperity
A prosperity within
This is the path of prosperity
Made of thorns and broken glass
