I left you alone
It's only my fault
I'm dying faced with all this uncertainty
God, I'm begging, please
Bring them back to me
Seconds become minutes become hours become days
In my dreams
I hear him whisper
Laugh
Their cry for help
They shout my name
Seeing his fucking face
Which I hate with every fibre of my heart
Words can't express my disgust for you
So young, so innocent
Bring them back to me
