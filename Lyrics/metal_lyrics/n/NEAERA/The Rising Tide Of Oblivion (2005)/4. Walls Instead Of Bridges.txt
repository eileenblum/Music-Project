Ears deaf - eyes blind
Mouth shut
Day by day
Victim after victim
Blood runs softly down the screen
Degenerating
For the lifeless and the weak
Degenerated
Minds off - heart cold
Into the state that leaves the blind unvoiced
More illusions - (more viewing figures)
The great rebellion against reality
Truth versus media
Obey the Pied Piper of this century
There are barricades instead of trails
And walls instead of bridges
Walls instead of bridges - I can't fight no more
Walls instead of bridges - Shall I fight for
Walls instead of bridges - For this fucking doom?
Walls instead of bridges
Tear them down
It's time to wake up
No longer be a part of this nightmare
In which violence and lies dominate
