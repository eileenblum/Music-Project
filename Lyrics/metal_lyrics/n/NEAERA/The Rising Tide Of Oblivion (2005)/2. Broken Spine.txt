Cut my threads
I'm nothing but a marionette
Lies and cliches harm and ruin
Our exchange of views
Never thought this could be me
To weak to resist the flow
Isn't it useless to speak of freedom of speech?
(When we only try to adapt other people's opinions)
Cut my threads
I'm nothing but a puppet
I get frustrated when I look into the mirror
I can't be proud of this face
Smiling at me
No, I don't want to follow
No, I can't stand my face
Bleeding, dying, torn
Enmeshed in disillusion
Stand the flow
