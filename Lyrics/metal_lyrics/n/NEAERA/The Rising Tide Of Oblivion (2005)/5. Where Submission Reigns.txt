Submission reigns
Where independent thought sleeps
Blindness rules
Where apathetic minds slumber
Jihad, crusades, persecution, genocides
Human lunacy in the name of god
To justify the unjustifiable
Religion - the great invention of man
Mankind's crib of chaos
The question of meaning and existence
The great desire to belong
To praise and submit
Belief - your invention was a necessity
But fanaticism is sheer abuse
God's will or your will?
This is fuckin scapegoating!
A great home for thousands
Providing temporary shelter and hope
A god to trust in and find salvation
... yet a perfect source of abuse
