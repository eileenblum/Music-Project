A Nation Chose It's Side
A Vote that Justifies
Corruption, Deceit, Torture

Blind Faith in Selfish Leaders
Whose Only Religion is Greed
Imposing (their) Beliefs on the World
Perverted Picture of Democracy

Trade Your Freedom
For the Illusion of Safety
Is it so Much Easier to Bow?
In a State of Control

This Tendency to Trust in
What Controls You
Has Left Your Nation Paralyzed

Trade Your Freedom
A Constant Climate of Fear
Maintained by the Power Hungry

The Abolition of Free Will
A Divided People's Truth
Isolated from the Eyes of the World

The Ministry of Thought
Blessing or Curse?

What a Choice to Make
What a Signal to Send to the World

[Chorus]
