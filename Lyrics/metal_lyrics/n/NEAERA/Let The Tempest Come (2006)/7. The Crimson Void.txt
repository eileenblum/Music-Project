If You Stare Into the Void for Too Long
The Void Will Stare Into You

I Will Wash Away All Pain
May the Great Cleansing Begin
Yet I was Waiting in Vain
For the Sea To Come in

I See the Vultures Circling
Over the Remnants of My Soul
Thier Greedy Eyes Upon Me
But They Will Only Find Carrion and Holes

I Throw Myself Into
The Oblivious Sea of Nothingness to Dwell
To Cleanse and Escape
From the ever-changing World of Sight
But Deliverance Never Comes
I'm So Yearning for Angels Inside
And Hounds of Hell I Reap
And Bloody Hounds of Hell I Reap

If You Stare Into the Void for Too Long
The Void Will Stare Into You

Embrace, Deny
To Breathe Life
Release Tonight
To Feel What's Inside

[Chorus]
