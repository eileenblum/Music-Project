They Hurt Us Where it Hurts the Most
Freedom - The Holy Substitute
A Struggle Fought on the Battlefield of
Innocence and Religious Abuse

Your View of Religion
Sheer Insult to Your God and Prophet
Divine Words to Unleash Your Fear
The Non-Believers are Only You!

You Trigger a War of Civilization
Increase Xenophobia and Divide
Empty Thought
For a Paralyzed Breed
Murder, Hate, Wrath - Your Holy Trinity

Promised a Velvet Seat in Heaven
But You Gain a Bed of Nails in Hell
The Sacred Slaughter is Holiness to Sell

They Hurt Us Where it Hurts the Most
Freedom - The Holy Substitute
A Struggle Fought on the Battlefield of
Innocence and Religious Abuse

Empty Thought
For a Paralyzed Breed
Murder, Hate, Wrath - Your Holy Trinity

[Chorus]
