This Country Suffers from a Plague
That Nevers Seems to End
We Must Eradicate
This Sickening Disease

The Incarnation of Inferiority
Your Strength is True Weakness

Unite Against the Bastards
Who Dare Deny Our History
Who Twist Our Common Truths
Into Their Aryan Lies

We Must not let Our History Be Perverted
How Many Atrocities Do You Need to See?
(You are the) Heritage of Filth

A Plague - Maggots in the Country's Flesh
A Thorn - Inside the Country's Soul
Puppets - Disciples of Insanity

The Leaders - Shameless Desecraters
Mourning for a Sinister Past

The Power You Gain
Results of Social Misery

[Chorus]
