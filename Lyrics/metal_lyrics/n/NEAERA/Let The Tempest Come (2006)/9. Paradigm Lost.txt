We are Generation Greed
We are Generation Soma
Our Desire is More
But More Will Never Be Enough

Welcome to the Shores of Plenty
Where Possession Equals Happiness

We are Generation Soma
Generation Greed
In the Lungs of Abundance
Paradigm Lost

We are So Sick as to Choke on Too Much
Instead of Starving on Too Less
We are Flooded by a Tidal Wave of Poison
Slowly Polluting Our Minds

Our Prosperity
Is Based on Explioting You
Your Poverty and Weakness
Will Always Ensure Our Wealth

Peace of Mind Lies Hidden Deep Within
It Can't Be Sold or Bought
This Illusion Can Protect You
This Illusion Will Also Swallow You

Welcome to the Shores of Plenty
Where Possession Equals Hapiness

[Chorus]
