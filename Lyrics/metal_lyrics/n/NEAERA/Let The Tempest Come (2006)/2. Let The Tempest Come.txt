I Stand on Different Lines
And Dance on Twisted Knives
And if I Fall the Fall
You Will Not See Me Crawl

The Gravitation's Fading
Who the Hell am I?
The Muddy Waves of Chaos
They Take me in and Rise

Let it Come Down
Let the Tempest Come
"It Will be Rain To-night"
Let the Tempest Come

These Wounds Won't Kill Me
They'll Make Me Grow Inside
I Will Try to Use Them
And Wear My Scars With Pride

[Chorus]

Fear, Failure, Hurt, Wrath
Won't Take my Lust for Life
Solace, Love, Courage, Grip
Will Make Me Survive

[Chorus]
