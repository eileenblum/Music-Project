I am the cure of my own poison
The guardian of my ashes
Conductor of chaos
Anchor to the storm

Refusal to watch your yearning
Has led you astray
Your choice to be a martyr
Is comfort in decay

Buried yourself
Within yourself
Without yourself

I am the cure of my own poison
The guardian of my ashes
Conductor of chaos
Anchor to the storm

Buried yourself
Within yourself
Without yourself

Cynicism
Is compassion left for dead
A glance at glory lost
A lifetime of regret

King over barren lands
Last to come to your throne
You are reigning over nothing
You are reigning alone

Refusal to watch your yearning
Has led you astray
To complete you
You chose to glorify the lie

I am the cure of my own poison
The guardian of my ashes
Conductor of chaos
Anchor to the storm
