Arms have stretched
Beyond their reach
Craving for a false perfection
Safe
Under self-deception's wing
Craving for a false protection

Illusion is solace
Reflection is pain

Nothing loved - nothing lost
Nothing tried - nothing lost

I called on despair to guide me
Summoned the cold again
I bit from the grapes
Of seduction
Because reflection is pain

This is my wasteland
Empire without a king
Where resignation rules
Slaying the wolf within

Nothing loved - nothing lost
Nothing tried - nothing lost

Illusion is knowledge!
Rest in peace!
Illusion is solace!
Rest in peace!

I called on despair to guide me
Summoned the cold again
I bit from the grapes
Of seduction
Because reflection is pain!

This is my wasteland
Empire without a king
Where resignation rules
Slaying the wolf within

I would rather sense
Nothing at all
Than sense
What is true
