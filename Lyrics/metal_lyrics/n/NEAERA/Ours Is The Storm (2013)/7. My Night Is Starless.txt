My night is starless
But I forge my faith
My night is starless

My light is darkness
But I pave my ways
My night is starless

Stormwarning
Corruption of the soul
My center lies
Outside the circle

Stars of guidance
Unknown
Clarity
Uncrowned

My night is starless
But I forge my faith
My night is starless

My light is darkness
But I pave my ways
My night is starless

Forewarning
Seduction of the soul
My center lies
Outside the circle
Failure lurks
As you make a stand
Certainty
Uncrowned
Send forth your burden
You don't need your past
Destination
Unknown

Abort your servitude
Exhale your death
Defy all certainty
Inhale your self

Your night was starless
But you forged your faith
Your night was starless
Your light was darkness
But you paved your ways
Your night was starless
