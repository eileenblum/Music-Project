[Bonus Track]You tried to mask the yearn of what
You lie master you

Pain has disrupt your might
We all yearn to the chains
With pain
And disrupt your might

We all bury utopia
In a flame of resignation
We are burning our world to dust
In a moment of redemption

We're all rising beyound the death of our future
[?] yourself of dignity
We are realising beyound the day of our grace
Wondering what we come to plead
Pain disgust

Creation of the world
Love, remorse, without

Penitence reanimate the weak
Labor and rise up

You tried to mask the yearn of what
you lie master you

We all bury utopia
In the flame of resignation
We are burying our world today
In a coffin of protection

My heart is boiling
My lenses are [?]
My heart is aching
My soul is filled with pain disgust

Creation of the world
Love, remorse, freedom

Answers reanimate the way
Labor and rise up
The dead eyes of a skeleton [?]
Harvest of my skeleton
