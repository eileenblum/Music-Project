A thousand holes
One thousand spills
Corporate corruption
To end your will
A wasted nature
A grace that's choked
A precious well
Under a greedy spell
Let your wrath boil
Like the minds of sulphur

Let your wrath boil
Redeem your soil
Like the minds of sulphur

The nurturing womb
Now a black tomb
A casket of black
A sea of regret
A pain to neglect

Let your wrath boil
Avenge your soil
The trail of life is cold

A wasted nature
A grace that's choked
A precious well
Under a greedy spell
A green paradise
An oil-plagued genocide
A precious well
Under a greedy spell

Our teeth of profit
Driven
Right through your wealth
A delta of violence
Draining relevance
