And we are carrying the fire
Each the other's world entire

Starved
Exhausted
Sick with fear
Gather your sources
Become unhere

Life dismembered
All hope entombed
Losing heart
In this autistic dark
Loved ones lost and dead
If only my heart were stone

And we are carrying the fire
Each the other's world entire

Starved
Exhausted
Sick with fear
Gather your sources
Become unhere

There were few nights
Lying in the dark
That I did not envy the dead
In the fire's heart
Amidst all dooming
Faintly colored worlds
Of human love

Like a grave
Our hearts are like a grave
Yearning at judgement day
Yawning at judgement day

And we are carrying the fire
Each the other's world entire
And in the face
Of total termination
A light shines
