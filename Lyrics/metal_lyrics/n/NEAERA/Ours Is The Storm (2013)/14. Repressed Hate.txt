[Bonus Track]Will you hear from me
When it come to you

The disgust
The tears
And the shame

Will remain forever

Every night you open the door
Spread your wings

Hypnotized
Assaulted
Petrified

Is it wrong to protect her
From this monster [2x]
Godfather, Monster, Godfather

Gwa!

Can't scream the shame
From escape

I once shall bring an hope
Feel the pain, Pain
And now, feel the pain
Always remembering the sight

The blood
Your torture screams
Your son screams
The day, the day will come
That they make you scream, and scream, and scream, and scream, and scream.
