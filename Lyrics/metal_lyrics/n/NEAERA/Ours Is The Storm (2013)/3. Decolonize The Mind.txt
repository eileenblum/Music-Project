Rise beyond the selfish throne
Think beyond your endless own
Rise above
What harms your soul
To uphold strength
And capture fear
You need a soul
That wants to steer

Decolonize the mind
Leave the strains behind

Break the chains
Kill the pains
Light the flame
Of what they want to stain

Rise beyond the selfish throne
Think beyond your endless own
Rise above
What harms your soul

To uphold strength
And capture fear
You need a soul
That wants to steer
Build yourself
An open space
Where you can grow
Withstand to bow

Decolonize the mind
There is no peace
Outside the self
Decolonize the mind
Leave the strains behind

Break the chains
Kill the pains
Light the flame
Of what they want to stain
