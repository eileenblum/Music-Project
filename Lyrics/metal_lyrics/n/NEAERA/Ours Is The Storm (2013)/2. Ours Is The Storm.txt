Conviction and desire
Will not obey to hate
Life is ours to conquer
We become the war we wake
Beaten to the dust
But never jading
Choking on lies
Never suffocating

Ours is the Storm
The bold, the strong
Ours is the Storm
From piles of nothing
We're forging something

Ours is the cold
Virtuous wrath
The strong, the bold
The first to last
Beaten to the dust
Yet never jading
Choking on lies
Never suffocating

The darkness
Of our past defeats
Will brighten the light
Of our victories

Blinded with tears of blood
Searching for a distant dawn
Ranks close to brave the flood
To embrace the new day's spawn

Ours is the Storm
The bold, the strong
Ours is the Storm
From piles of nothing
We're forging something
