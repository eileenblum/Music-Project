All we lost on our ways
We will reconquer
We will prevail

Who will win this fight
Insignificance or the I?
How can I free myself
From these faithful chains?

A sleeping demon is not dead
A demon laid in chains
Remains untamed

The day I stop to wonder
Is the day I die
From this grief and hunger
A new spirit shines

All we lost on our ways
Our souls and dignity
We will storm back
All we lost on our ways
We will reconquer
We will prevail

I bury something deep inside
Belonging in the open wide
I harbour a pain to grow
Breed a cancer within my soul

The day I stop to wonder
Is the day I die

All we lost on our ways
Our souls and dignity
We will storm back
All we lost on our ways
We will reconquer
We will prevail
