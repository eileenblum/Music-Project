Ascend to chaos
And reclaim your throne
Let freedom ring

From hibernation
Eternal slumber
Braving oppression
Your hearts a thunder
This fortress of falsehood
Is built to burn
You don't need to stand
What is made to fall
You don't need to trust
What is unjust

Ascend to chaos
And reclaim your throne
Let freedom ring
Ascend to chaos
And reclaim your own
Exile the king

Let submission break
Ignite your hell
Let courage prevail
Abandon your shell

The strength
That gathered you here
Will spark the night
Through ache
Into the unknown
You dare the light

Cast out your tyrant
Kill the silence
Unearth the hatchet
Create a stampede
This fortress of falsehood
Is built to burn
You don't need to stand
What is made to fall
You don't need to trust
What is unjust

Ascend to chaos
And reclaim your throne
Let freedom ring
Ascend to chaos
And reclaim your own
Exile the king
