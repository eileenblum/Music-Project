Command your armies
Lead the charge

They say
That their future is now
They say
That your future is not
They claim that you
Who are battle-scarred
Have never fought

To the countless souls unmourned
Their suns eclipsed
To the broken lives unsung
Whose chances are missed

Shed your sloth like faded skin
Make a stand against
The doubt within
Command your armies
Lead the charge
Pave the path
That is yours to march

To the countless souls unmourned
Their suns eclipsed
To the broken lives unsung
Whose chances are missed

Desperation follows desire
Despise is love in disguise
Walk with fearless composure
Through treacherous flames

They say
That their future is now
They say
That your future is not
They claim that you
Who are battle-scarred
Have never fought

Shed your sloth like faded skin
Make a stand against
The doubt within
Command your armies
Lead the charge
Pave the path
That is yours to march
