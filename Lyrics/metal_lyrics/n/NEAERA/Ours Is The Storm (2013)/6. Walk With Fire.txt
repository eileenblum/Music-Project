We are strangling
Our souls every day
Our sacrifice
For the Modern Age
Dispirited
A ghost to our selves
Alienated
Lifeless shells

We are so sated
And we are so much
But we will never be enough
Our hearts are breaking
Without a sound
Fighting freedom
Losing ground

The path I take
I'll walk with fire
I'll earth myself
And seek the higher
The path I take
I'll walk with fire

Peace of mind
A gift for the gifted kind
The haunted breed
The language I speak

Into this sound
I carry all that's bad
My hopes
My demons
My regrets

We are so sated and
We are so much
But we will never be enough
Our hearts are breaking
Without a sound
Fighting freedom
Losing ground

The path I take
I'll walk with fire
I'll earth myself
And seek the higher
The path I take
I'll walk with fire
