It is begun
We are become the vengeance
Awoken by a call
To shed the blood of generations

Invoke the cleansing
The dawn of a new mourning
Bring forth the lasting scars
Save your sentiment for the extinct
Genocide - a human theme
Redemption - a shallow dream?

Devastation gathers
Drench this soil with tears
Humanity at zero
Remorse - shattered
The conscience wronged
Let the risen speak for the fallen

We dig compassion's grave
Eight thousand sorrows deep

Evolution's blood-stained crown
Shall be ours to keep
We dig compassion's grave
Eight thousand sorrows deep

Devastation gathers
Drench this soil with tears
Humanity at zero
