Through the alchemy of fire
Braving the Rubicon
Through the alchemy of fire
Reaching beyond - Braving despair

Every time the walls are closing in
You choose to grow or shrink
Every challenge you reject with fear
Makes your pride and spirits disappear

Fear and doubt have gone
Strength and weakness melt into one
This turmoil I will harness
This drought I will stand

Upon barren soil
I'll build my throne
No vast kingdom
A solid ground

Praising freedom in a cage that is myself
But who is not a slave?
When you think yourself a victim
There will never be salvation
