And to Posterity we sent a Plague
Creating destruction - Forging decay

Who will ever grant us absolution
For the crimes we daily commit?
Who will wash free our hands
From the blood that sticks with them?

The faceless screams of misery
The catalogue of pain
Should make the stones weep

You can't enlighten the mind
Without blackening your soul

We should bear the fiercest grudge against the unjust
Yet our wrath is choked

This silence is false
The silenced are falsed

Thanks to reikjavik08 for sending track #10 lyrics.
