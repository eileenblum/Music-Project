On my path to self-destruction
I passed a source of hope
And on fear and hatred I choked
On my path to isolation
I walked the fields of nowhere
In a valley of false salvation
I breathed despair

If you aim for the source
You must swim against the grain

On my path to self-illusion
I bowed to standards
And from the truth within I fled
On my path to self-surrender
I denied the I
And without teeth or spine
I tried to survive

Sirens of Black
Evoke the abyss from its fathomless depth
Benighted we stand
A spectre of fear and lies in our hands

From carpets of unbroken glass
Phoenix will never arise

If you aim for the source
You must swim against the grain
What you have in you
You can't extract - only reconcile

On my quest for peace of mind
I almost lost my anger
And in a stream of cynic
I float
