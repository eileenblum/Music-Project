Arise Black Vengeance
To revenge of suicide

Harpoons of avarice
Piercing your black skin
Draining your blackening veins
A wound refusing to heal

Abysmal martyrium
Bleeding of blackest blood
Deepwater pandemonium
For Horizons of growth

A descent into the depths of risk
To quench our growing thirst

You can kill your conscience
But you can't kill your guilt
You can fuel our hunger
But you can't still your guilt

Draining on your blood until you've bled white
Denying the end of supply

This dust was once man
