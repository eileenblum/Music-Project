We have unleashed
A cold disease
With a fragile core
And an iron shell
The masters have become the slaves
Control deprived we crave and crave

Enmeshed in the machinery
knowing only one direction:
F O R W A R D

Crowning greed with a halo of need
No one foresees when everyone seeks
The masters have become the slaves
Control deprived we crave and crave

We have sacrificed the source
To worship the stream
The mind is obsolete
Where means are absolute

A system to serve mankind
Mankind to serve the system
Closer and higher
Until the world's on fire

A system to serve mankind
Mankind to serve the system
Closer and higher
Until the world's on fire
