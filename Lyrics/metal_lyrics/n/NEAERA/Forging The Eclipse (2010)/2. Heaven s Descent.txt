Arrogance is not strength!
There is no grace in apathy

In the veil of stasis divine
You preach obsessive concealment
Heads held high in falsest pride
Steadfast in the storm of truth

There is a fury that bears your name
A call to break this vow of shame
This is your judgement
Repent, Heaven's Descent

You follow the bygone belief
That time erases guilt

The higher you place yourself
The deeper you fall

Those who turned to you for guidance
Received the seed of woe
A gift from the core of filth
How does it feel to murder a soul?

A waning light, a slow descent
