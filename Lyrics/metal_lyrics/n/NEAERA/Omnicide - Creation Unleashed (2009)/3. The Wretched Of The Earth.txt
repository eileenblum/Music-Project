Abducted to the thousands
Carried off to dust in brightest day
Nurtured with illiteracy
Besieged by rage
Gradual infanticide, internally displaced

Shadows of souls
Children of ghosts
They make you murder your own
They teach you to kill
Kill yourself

Programmed to annihilate
Drugged to kill
Brainwashed to retaliate
No mercy
No regret
The Wretched of the Earth

Innocent, guilty lives
Coffined in caskets of glass

Dwelling in the underworld of guilt
Numbed below conscience
With every shot you tear your souls apart
Erase the last chance of healing
