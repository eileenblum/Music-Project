Obscurity overwhelms the earth
In embrace of my shattered mind
The storm comes closer to reap
The darker seed of my  thoughts
But with the dawn approaching
I rise and feel my strength return
My will cuts through the gravest ice
And kills off the pain

Frost stabs the ground
Cold spreads its wings around my soul
Emptiness airs cries of mourning
Irrupting my heart to fill my veins with misery

I am significant
Not nothing, no shadow of myself
I will overcome my fear
To make me as strong as I appear

I know this day will come
When you will be stronger than the strongest one

What does not kill you
Only makes you stronger
What does not kill you
Only makes you stranger
