The White Man's Burden is yours
We pierced your dignity,
Feasted on pride
We stamped you deep into the ground
Still harvest the fruits from the rape

I Am the Rape
The torch of our belief
White light to black darkness
We taught you western civilization
A lesson in oppression and greed

The cradle of life you never leave
Identity and history pushed aside
We came to rule and Other the unknown
To conquer, exploit and enslave
