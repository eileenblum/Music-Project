Armed to the teeth
Destruction within peace
The civilized disease
Creation Unleashed

Deforestation
Torture mother earth
Quenching the lungs of our shells
We pierce our spades deep into the earth
Cutting our veins through

Balanced nuclear armament
To yield means putting peace at risk
This you call the civilized world
Enlightenment in black

Armed to the teeth
Destruction within peace
Omnicide
The great human stain
The civilized disease
Creation Unleashed

You equalize development
With the greatest power of destruction

Lords of war fuelling conflict
Hunting for profit, aiming at peace
Human dignity as oil for the machine
Exploitation altered on prosperity
