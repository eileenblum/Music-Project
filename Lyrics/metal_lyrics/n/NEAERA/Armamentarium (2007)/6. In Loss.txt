The tree grows sturdy
The rock withstands the raging floods

Fate wields the axe
Turns the tide that will one day
Cause the stone to break

Inside this painful dissonance
I commend myself to dark oblivion

Petrified and crippled

My safe harbour lies in ruins
A life never to be lived
Joy never to be felt
Laughter never to be heard again

Never to be healed again

Estranged and marked by loss
I lash out at the unreachable
Disposable creature
Denying the uncomfortable

Your soul will never cease to pulse inside me
