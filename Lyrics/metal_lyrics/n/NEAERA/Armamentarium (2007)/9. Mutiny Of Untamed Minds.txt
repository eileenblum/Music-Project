I am the breeder of my fear
Apathy is my tender liar
Immerged in leeches pond
Cowardice the disgraceful vice

Widower of my delusion
With disobedient flesh
I refuse to gorge
The bowels of decay

Paralyzed by barking jaws
Hurricanes become a whisper
Claws of the powerful
Enchain angry raised fists

Afraid to bow down again

In the dungeon of submission
They flagellate rebellious hearts
Close mutiny of untamed minds
Where boldness will be first mate
