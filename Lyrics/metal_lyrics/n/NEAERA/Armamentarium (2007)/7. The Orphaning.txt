Storm and sea
Punish us piece by piece
But world economy must grow
If we drown, we drown in luxury

Why should we save lives we'll never meet?
Why should we not destroy?
...ourselves

We're dancing to the end on volcanoes
Screaming pantomimes in our ears
At night, we set our beds ablaze
Orphaning the future - orphaning ourselves

The change we cause
Will slowly destroy your tiny world
And you have nothing to say
You're helpless
Consumed

Why should we save lives we'll never meet?
Why should we not destroy ourselves?
