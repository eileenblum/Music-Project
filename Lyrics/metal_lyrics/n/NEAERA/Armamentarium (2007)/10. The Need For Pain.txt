You curse the inner demons
Condemn all that aches

What you thought would kill you
Also keeps you alive and breathing

Don't deny your inner demons
Don't try to kill them away
Make use of your passion and pain

Grief, melancholy
Sources divine to creativity

This life is just a fragment of a dream
What would drive us if we were complete?
The desire anchored inside
Is haunting, but makes you tick and move

What has died in you that must be resurrected?
What has died in you that must yet be buried?

Some things you simply cannot tame
The need for pain
Sometimes you simply cannot tame
The need for pain
