Fit out for the dangers of our century
It's not the time to disarm
Arm against social decay
Anonymity, decadence, neglect

Armamentarium
Get armed against the poison
Armamentarium
The antidote is almost under way

Get armed against social cutback
Unemployment, divide
Arm against social terror
It creeps through the veil of democracy

Get armed against withdrawal
Only offense will survive

Beware of depression
Your soul shall be a palace
Get armed against yourself
The roots are always within
