I have been thinking the wrong thoughts
Misread the signs
Walking on false paths
I misjudged life

I was chanting the wrong songs
Too deaf to hear
Playing nostalgic tunes
Anywhere, but here

You can't get the right answers
When you're asking the wrong questions
Following familiar tracks
Is seldom the best

Strength is not how high you can climb
But how you cope when you bounce
We are all in the gutter
But some of us are looking at the stars

Don't let the past
Reign you forever
