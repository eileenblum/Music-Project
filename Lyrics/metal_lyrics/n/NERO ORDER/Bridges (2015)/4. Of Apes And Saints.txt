Rescind our days
The road is paved in horns
And good intention lights the gleaming way
In every flame and shadow
Pralaya beckons

This is not sustainable
That which is our sustenance
Fall upon the attainable
Fall away in merriment

The path was made
From the fire of souls
And the grasping of bone
The flesh its own grave, a mere churning of soil
As we become the unknown
Unchanged essence; ascendant bloodshed
In stillness the truth is shown
Nothing is not
Still a great rest comes
Our stars all implode but their light lingers on

Of might and circumstance
And the will to rise above
Our dreams come and end
Shared plight of everyman
Some fall beneath their load
A new dawn comes
Its light is cold
But in the heart of man burns the coal
To raze or resurrect the ways of old
And for an hour the earth prostrates
Unto his dominion

Between two poles around we go
Between apes and saints the spiritâs strewn
Evolution takes its toll
Extinction escorts to the throne

Abscond the reins
Acumen fills with smoke
Good intention lights the way
Ensconce our shame in gold
The road is paved in horns

Endless upon end
Observe the raising hand
That wields the means
The reason to be:
Naught; The void increase
Surge and the surcease
Of God and Beast
The vacuum draws the day
Into the night
A lapse of light
Reset our names
Make null our claims
Lay waste the way
Rescind our days
And all of this
Falls away
