Born in freefall and in blood, we carve our marks in dust
Of towers crumbled we ascend; panegery of naught
Enter in cold, brought forth in pain, product of our lust
Interred in clay â remnants of a past that never was
Weâre not here

Rise! Wrest the day!
Archetype of imperator enthroned â Hail Caesar!
Decay ushers the strange
In the wake of our evolution

The fires of the firmament are the same fires of perdition
The fight against impermanence yields their invocation
And at the taking of the earth, so do we reap the sky
On a burning bridge we stand our ground
And fly

Violence crawling; silence calling; that is not which is
The reason to fall â the engine of all, world without end
Unresting the thrones, a loosing of stones â so emanates solemnity
The face of the foe to legions bestowed â futility is the landlord of the world

The dazzling clash of lead
Oblivion rears its head
Our flesh bound to the dead
surreptitiously
The hounds have had their fun
Unpursued, still we run
Our race is finished
We are damned; we are free
Every breath a swansong
And every step a swan dive

We ride the writhing tide of maya
over all the boundaries,
The crests crash down
into a wall of nothing.
In rows we stand upon the threshold
Flames await us anxiously
Grace unmarred
We spread our wings and fail
