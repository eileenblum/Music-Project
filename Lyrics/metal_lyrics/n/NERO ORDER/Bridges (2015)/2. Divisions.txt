The line
Formed between the two
Divisions and bridges
Born anew

Words will never speak the truth
All our ships have sailed; the winds are loosed

Crime
Born within our hue

A curse in every gleaming tooth
The mists, our veil; the whip, our noose
We take flight
Like shells to fall

We set fire
Blazing the roads
So descends the soul
Bring in night
The absence to goad
Still, stillness enfolds
The reason why

Gathering
Against the tide
Ranks shall break
We abide
Songs we sing
Visions bright
Joining hands
Say goodbye
Every thief has its fight
Severing blade casts its light

Stones
Amidst the sea
A sinking ship
Our harmony
Gleaning hope
The crests to reach
Dressed in bone
Blood beseech screams to the sky

To tear the order
To willâs to war
Descension under
The abjured throne

Thine eyes have seen the glory
That we, we shall meet again
In peace or cleaved in anger
Residing, residing in our end

We stand and pave
The great and grave
And untrod waste
To burn this place
(Of songs unsung
And divisions)
