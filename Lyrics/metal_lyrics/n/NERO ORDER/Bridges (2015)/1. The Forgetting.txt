Say all your goodbyes âtil there is no self to say them
The waves of stillness carry all
Your words and symbols scrawled fall meaningless as we evolve
The bridge we build to be just where we are

Weâll say hello to the ever-present stranger
In letting go inviting all
In bursts the liminal claws â in feeding this, the faces fall
To exist is to be not where we are

Rising!
The wave collapses, has the sea changed?
Knowledgeâs folly falls and what remains
As all meets naught?
Silence singing through
The pulse of revelation beat by none
We are the heart and the teeth of an endless sun
Wise and blind, we know
He also is in the
Forgetting

Sounds that greatest sin
Our quiet din belies
Now drowned in endless
Brighter than our light
Contained inside
Not swallowed, but descended
Climbing through our fall
Let one and all
Partake in this madness
Resting in our time
Erase the lines
And come away from sadness

Falling!
The wave collapses, has the sea changed?
Knowledgeâs folly falls and what remains
As all meets naught?
Silence singing through
The pulse of revelation beat by none
We are the heart and the teeth of an endless sun
Wise and blind, we know
He also is in the
Forgetting
Soul incarnate
Of no mind
Of this day
And in the world
In tooth and claw
Strive to carve
As we fall
To our fate
Make recompense
To the king
Impermanence
We are shapes
On the wall
From a fire
Eternal
That is not
Points we plot
Of no dimension
Lines begotten
In the void
Bringing form
Thus descended
We are born
Into our fall
Ascend
The throne of nothing
By fire
Or blood
Or silent waiting
The path
Is laid
The lines are empty
Face nowhere and receive the reward
