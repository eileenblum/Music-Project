Whoa! There rides Geburah 
From the right arm of man
He scribes five!
As the surgeon of the skies, grinds he all
Limitless, volcanic sire of war
He brings fire!
Â 
The blade cancer invites
Completion renewed in strife
All is slaved to Fear
Fear is one with Justice: The scourge of God
Â 
Fortress crumbling, upheaving light
Whatâs been denied is stirredâ¦
Â 
Locusts come and hum the song of knowing
Receive the swarm and find divine insight
Â 
Wellspring exhausted, cups now dry
Stagnant waters putrefy
Thus ferment and so transform 
In great torment change is born
Â 
VISITA INTERIORA TERRAE RECTIFICANDO INVENIES OCCULTUM LAPIDEM
(Visit the interior parts of the earth: by rectification thou shalt find the hidden stone)
Â 
He hath come and set alight in katabolic sacrifice!
Â 
VISITA INTERIORA TERRAE RECTIFICANDO INVENIES OCCULTUM LAPIDEM
(Visit the interior parts of the earth: by rectification thou shalt find the hidden stone)

IGNI NATURA RENOVATUR INTEGRA
(All of nature is restored by fire)
Â 
Every value overturned
The universe is renderedâ¦
Â 
We are beyond apology. 
The time now has come to make things right.
Inner shadow, wishes consummate
We all are invoking our end
Â 
As failure crashes upon our heads
We imbibe the blood of success
And so it has been, and so it is written, and so it is done
