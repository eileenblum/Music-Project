Looking back with sight beyond time
An aeon changes at the rest of the celestial I
Â 
Destroyer lifts a heavy lid
Itâs sure felt like a while
A great exhalation and a parting smile
Where all paths converge and fade to an aether of blood
Procession unto the final stage
Gaze at the face of all weâve loved
Â 
The towerâs coming downâ¦
Â 
We come in reveling
Great day of leveling
Our symptoms are all the same
These Cities of the Plain
Â 
Now walk against the ash of all weâve sown
With embers of the old, the new way shone
Within the burning hall of shattered thrones
The fallen shall not rise
Still something builds a home
So marks an end to all that we have known
The dead past quickly fades
The gates crash closed
And the walls crumble as we greet our foes
The jaws open; flames enclose our world
Â 
No words spoken
Figures broken
Pouring from the opened skies
Surmise reason
âBecauseâ stops breathing
Witness at the melting of our lives

Lay waste!
Â 
Receive: God Mind
False belief falls away
Open:  Great Eye
Lightning enlighten the soul
Â 
And so unfolds
The augursâ prognosticationâ¦
Â 
Now great birds paint our horizon black and red
And in a swoop devour nations
While on the microcosmic plane
So too do old structures fall
Â 
Ride forth on splintering wheels
How our world reels as its engine stops
Â 
Our answers came for us today
Theyâre all we dreamed
Though not as we hoped

And so it goes sometimes
And so it goes away
Â 
Babylon, Babylon
Upon the Beast she rides
It is one, as we fall down
The future is bright!
Â 
All fall down like children, tumble like statues, fall like great Rome
Rise, rise, rise like monuments, like crucifixions, like ascending Gods
Torrent crash forward, clearing the way, breaking old forms
Current rush onward, love under will igniting our blood
Â 
The drawing storm clouds look like war
The struggleâs over
Thereâs nothing left worth fighting for
And likely, there never was
Now in unity: Cessation
Â 
Here as flames rise and owls descend
Songs all once sang no one sings again
But laid in the tarot and cast in the runes
For a new aeon there comes a new tune
Â 
The stars are revealed and fall from the sky
The pyre weâve lit devours the night
The decree is given, great Order arise
In glory crowned we meet our demise
Â 
Walls to the heavens we built with our hands
Rendered to the void, they forever stand
Striking the shell, that vast enemy
In ruins of self, at last we are free!
Â 
And now the rites of old are black
End of a universe; last vision â look back
To an evaporating road of marrowless bones
As one eye opened the other closed
