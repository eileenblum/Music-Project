Welcome the spear for the sake of love
Light penetrates; this wound lets darkness celebrate
An invocation to upheaval at faults
The ruin is divine as all boundaries dissolve

Bind!
If thine eye be single then the whole body shall be filled with light

So surrounding shadows riseâ¦

As ascensions are traced with blood
The hordes resound, believing the light is warm
But the cold was kind and the Sun is growing

In blinding truth ignite the sphere
The eye of God opens and the walls all come crashing down

Welcome our fall and the rising tides
Love the adversary dissolve and thrive!

As oceans dry the buried depths shall be brought to light

Recognize the cycles of no again
All worlds end

In perfection we are as noneâ¦

Particles strike!
In blinding truth ignite the sphere
The eye of God opens and the walls all come crashing down

Amidst the rubble, the wretched feeding
Then from the darkness, a light comes streaming
From the mouth of the morning a song is keening
And in their wounds is offered a meaning
