[feat. Alex Teyen of Black Tongue]Manipulation is your strong suit,
Fucking up every chance you've had at redemption.
The lowest of the low, your putrid stench unbearable.
Say my fucking name again I swear to god I'll cut your tongue out.

[Alex Teyen]
Your words fall on deaf ears.
I will bathe in your tears.
Are you listening to me?
All you do is hide behind this false sense of importance.
Anybody can see your crippling insecurities.
You ain't tough, you ain't real and you have hell to pay.

Kill yourself, you fucking bitch.
Kill yourself, you piece of shit.
