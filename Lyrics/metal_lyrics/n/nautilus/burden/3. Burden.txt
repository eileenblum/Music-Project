Out of sight and out of mind,
To everyone I've left behind in my life.

Nothing but a fucking burden;
A fucking useless annoyance
A problem child at it's finest.

Once I'm out of sight, I only wish I could be out of mind.

I can't close my eyes at night.
The burdens don't outweigh my use.
Won't you grant me the gift of sleep?

So watch me tear your life apart and slit your throat.
