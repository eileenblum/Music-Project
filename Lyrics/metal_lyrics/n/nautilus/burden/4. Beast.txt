[originally by TAS ]
[feat. Tyler Shelton of Traitors]We all come from broken homes, broken hearts and broken bones
We will live and die alone, we will live and die alone
Welcome to the end, tonight we will descend
We might not be enemies, but we cannot be friends
I want to go on record and say that I want to live to see the day
Where the world screams gasping for air, unanswered cries because nobody cares
I want to breathe my final breath knowing you died a painful death
The fucking world is an ugly place, but I will die with a smile on my face

[Tyler Shelton]
My life is a shooting range, people never change
My life is a shooting range, people never change

We all come from broken homes, broken hearts and broken bones
We will live and die alone, we will live and die alone
Welcome to the end, tonight we will descend
We might not be enemies, but we cannot be friends

[Tyler Shelton]
My life is a shooting range, people never change
My life is a shooting range, people never change
My life is a shooting range, people never change
My life is a shooting range, people never change
