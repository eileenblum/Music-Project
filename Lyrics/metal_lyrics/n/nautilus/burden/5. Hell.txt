This is the most fucking livid I have ever been.
And I promise you, that I will be doing anything in my power,
That I'm capable of, to make your life a living hell.

Captivating and controlling the minds of the public.
From birth it is taught.

Killing has become second nature.
Death of those defenseless for nothing but pleasure.

Pure hatred for anyone in defense of this
Pure hatred for anyone who claims it does not exist.

I beg and hope every single day that
You rot in your own waste.
One more day until your death.
And your wrath ceases to exist.
I guarantee from the bottom of my heart;

The earth will be a better place when you die.
