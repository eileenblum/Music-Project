As I am
You will obey

But be aware and deprive the soul from
Hesitations and fear
Immersed in the blood of Christ
Feast on his flesh
Uplifted by spirit and faith
Blindfold the rebels and erect gallows
Because the time will come
And you will be what I am
From death comes life
And like white maggots with swollen guts
Carnivorous creatures
Prophecies obedience.

Kephas listen: the light seeps from the walls of pride
Like the dark in the throat of Galilean seers
Pray disciple. On christian knees
You that listened, that believed, preach your word
Where the swine amuses itself.

We will be your apostles
But remember we can never hear your voice
Because you served the most vicious dog
And the slipperiest serpent
Who sits at the right hand of the father

Vade poste me christe
Vade poste me christe

Through the keys of a kingdom with no king
Into hell's fire, in the jaws of the beast.
