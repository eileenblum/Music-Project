Armed servant and saint executioner
Which weapon sculpted legens
Man whose repentance will become pitch
In the revelation's wound.
From resignation an order chocked
A thousand babies crying
Roman soldier you4ll drown in
The blood of the Jewish king.

Watch longinus, Christ is dead
And prey so that darkness will reign again.
Watch soldier, Christ is dead
And prey so that darkness will reign again.
Watch longinus, Christ is dead
And prey so that darkness will reign again.

Armed saint we'll dinner with your progeny
We'll steal your spear and turn it christian relic
We'll hide it between sharp nails and bloody robes
Where kneeling down, we'll kiss precious rings.

...et continuo exivit sanguis.

Witness and preacher,
Tell us of cloacked skies sentences and sepulchres
Roman centurion, cold wind that from the (high) Sinai
Pulled from his mouth the breath of errant preachers,
We'll cry together tears of piss
And snakes will crawl on marble steps and keenlers of thorn.

Watch longinus, Christ is dead
And prey so that darkness will reign again.
Watch soldier, Christ is dead
And prey so that darkness will reign again.
