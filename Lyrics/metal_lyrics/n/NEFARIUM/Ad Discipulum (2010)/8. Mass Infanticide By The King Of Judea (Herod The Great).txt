Land of god who takes away
The sins of the world.

We will never bow down,
We will complete your plan and burn it
To erect the flesh

Herod was the rain that cleanses the soon of your lies,
We are the snow that buries the will of a stupid rabbi
We will never bow down in front of imposed rules

We will drag christian bodies towards the calvary

Ad satanas qui laetificat gloria meam
Gloria satanas
Sicut erat in principo et in secula seculorum

He was the mud
To dirty the cloak of the withest lamb
Pull out the faith from me.
