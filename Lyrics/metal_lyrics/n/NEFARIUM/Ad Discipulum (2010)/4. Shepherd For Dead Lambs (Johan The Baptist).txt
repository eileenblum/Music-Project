Fuck the priest
Rabbits offal
In the mother's womb
That feeds in one brood
The father and the son
Lamb's blood to mark
The impervious path

Johan the baptist and his tongue
Which was a cavern for locusts
And raise the beast of god

The lamb of god
Between hate and deep revenge
We will be punishment
And we will be construction
For flocks and shepherds

Johan the baptist
Spread the sand of your kingdom
And wait, slithering eternally for
The grains that never rest
Johan the baptist
Spread the sand of your kingdom
In hope to hate again

We will the lamb with barred wire
After it has grazed on the grass of shame
Its flesh hung on the highest pole
Will your blood to create rivers

Johan the baptist and his tongue
Which was a cavern for locusts
And raise the beast of god
