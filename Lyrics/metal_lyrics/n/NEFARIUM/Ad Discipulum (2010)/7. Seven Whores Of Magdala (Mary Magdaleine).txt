From Ephesus grave and from the words
Spoken by Gregory the great
Seven were the chosen to oil the feet
Of who was looking for adultery

Demons of magdala, thorn from the crowd
Sleeping observers to serve the sin
Marry magdaleine
Witness of death and resurrection

From the flesh whose life spread legend
And on his face
From the high crucifix, pain

Demons of magdala, thorn from the crowd
Sleeping observers to serve the sin
Marry magdaleine
Witness of death and resurrection

"maria, de qua daemonia exierant"

From flies nest and the shelters of beasts,
From which pride gives birth to the infinite.

Invisible reflection of groans
And luxury, announce the resurrection
And scatter illusion, kingdom of sand.
