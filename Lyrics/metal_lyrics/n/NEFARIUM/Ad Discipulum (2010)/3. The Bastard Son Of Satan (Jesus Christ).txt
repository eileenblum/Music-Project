Uproot my faith and
I will kiss your brow, Nazarene
While drops of your sweat will plough deep wrinkles
Strip off my will
And I will repay you with prayers and confessions
But bless the sick focus

In the name of the father
Arise Christ and
From the height of Golgotha pray to die again
Arise Christ to die again

In the name of the father
Spew Jew king
Souls for the beast and fire for vicars,
Falling in pain,
Sate my conscience with your body
And quench my rage with blood
Teach us master, to fall in pain.
We were full of your food,
Drunk with your wine and we rested together
On the meager blanket of straw.

In the name of the father
Arise Christ and
From the height of Golgotha pray to die again
Arise Christ to die again

Uproot my faith and
I will kiss your brow, Nazarene
While drops of your sweat will plough deep wrinkles
White were the clouds that dirtied your sky
Like the eyes of they who handed down the testimony.

And listen to the toad croaking in the swarm of the impure
And pray to die again.
