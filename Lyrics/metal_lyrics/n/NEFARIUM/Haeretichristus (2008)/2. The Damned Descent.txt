Be happy in your most intense moments, now,
Because we will have
Deeper moments to give you

Make union your sword,
Since the warm embrace of hope
Will be ice.

Just to break in front of the will of our sons,
Not chosen descendants,
The incontestable rulers of the present and future.
With the extermination of bodies, purification will triumph in the baptism of future generations;
A damned descent will knock soon at your doors,

...and it will not be death time immediately,
This is suffering
A unique commandment, a universal law
The future doesn't know. You will be nothingness
And we will be the universe,
You will be the beasts
And we will be the chiefs
And the sheep will be ferocious dogs,
Ready to revolt against liars.
You will see our actions as the only truth,
Digging our teachings from the now arid terrain.

Damned descent
Our sons will accompany you by hand
To the only road, putting credulity aside
In favor of submission. Beyond darkness
There is only darkness, close to us.

You will be nothingness
And we will be the universe,
You will be the beasts
And we will be the chiefs.
