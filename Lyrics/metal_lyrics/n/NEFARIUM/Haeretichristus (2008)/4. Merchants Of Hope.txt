The light
In a motionless spirit can illuminate
Only itself, creating shadows of loneliness
And making invisible those that promulgate
Plans for earthly life. The ambitious journey
Towards the hostile unknown
Slowly dissolves
Every possible revolution,

While creation quivers in the body
And the soul vacillates on the fundamentals of rational
Fear and sterile instability.
Air will shake pure spirits,
Bodies generated in series,
Givers of knowledge,
Greedy searchers of fame.

Doubt induces the eyes to look for the shadow
In the dark through steep paths of clarity
Air will shake planners of salvation,
Merchants of hope,
Extreme blind antithesis
In the sight of men,

1000 chains
Will hide behind the most
Ambitious project, in the name of  resignation

And while the cold hand that will hold bloody bandages, will be laid
On the mouth of infidels and sad rebels,

The eyes will be induced to look again
For the shadow
To extinguish the infinite hope.
The blame must be punished and in a  reality
Of life and death,
Words and thoughts embedded and closed
On themselves in graves...

Punishment and resignation,
Extreme antithesis between life and death,
