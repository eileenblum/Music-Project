In the remembrance of a damned angel,
The word of a man without past
Resonates and the pain of that whip which
Gave obedience to the lord
And anger to the slave.
In every laceration,
Between blood and powder,

Lucifer's betrayal, pronounce your words and debone the celestial beast
Lucifer's betrayal, making its winged parasites shedders of blood

There was rebellion, but without shape
And for an act of unkindness,
An army of soldiers
Arose to climb over horizons
Which disappeared among the clouds,
Descended to touch nobody's lands

Vassal and then lord,
Free and our liberator,
He watches over us

From tall trees
On which stars escape,
Lit by the divine lamp,
Dragged by the eternal conflict

Let the devouring flames shine and heat
The coldness of a sterile paradise
Between drunk jugglers,
Blessed brothers and sleeping fortunetellers.

Lucifer's betrayal, pronounce your words and debone the celestial beast
Rebellious angel, making its winged parasites faithful servants.

Lucifer's betrayal, pronounce your words and debone the celestial beast
Rebellious angel, making its winged parasites shedders of blood.
