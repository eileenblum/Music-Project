The storm becomes stronger
Clouds darken the sun
We hail a new era
As Wotan returns

A lightning from the sky
Crushes down the earth
A thunderbolt of his arrival
A sign of rebirth

The raven sings songs
To celebrate his return
On the peaks of mountains
The fires burn

Hearts will awake
The seasons will turn
Life dwells again
As Wotan returns
[repeat]

The wolves howl to praise
As he appears in the mist
Light defeats the darkness
Life will resist

Hearts are beating faster
Gungnir is thrown
And the false gods die
Upon their golden thrones

Their towers are falling
Midgard will be free
A new sun will arise
From the blood of victory

Hearts will awake
The seasons will turn
Life dwells again
As Wotan returns
[repeat]
