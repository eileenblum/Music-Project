The days of joy - are so far away
Just sit and rust - in the age of gray

All so meaningless - all without sure
Just forget &amp; forget &amp; the leaves just dance

By the smile of the wind - the circle around
Ending moment in time - they cover the ground

And all the hope is gone - it won't appear again
The gods hide their faces - from declining men

Nothing to believe in - nothing to expect
The sun cries blood &amp; Balder is dead

Midgard starts to freeze
The heart of the worlds seems to die
And the tears that are falling
Just touching the sky

A grey day in time
The loss of all might
But there's still life
That's burning inside

Like the autumn leaves that fall
Life just fades away
To feed a new age
That also dies one day
