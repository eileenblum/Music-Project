There is a voice deep inside us
Speaking through the flow of blood
Speaking of heritage &amp; loyalty
The voice of our gods

Through the centuries of echoes
Since the beginning of time
The tribe of Jarl, of Heimdals sons
The dawn of our kind

A chain of blood that can't be broken
A golden bond to the ancestors and Odin
To those before me I'll stay loyal
I'll stay true...Asatru

The spirit of our ancestors
Once forged between fire &amp; ice
Out of the blood sea arising
Blessed by the gods with life

A chain of blood that can't be broken
A golden bond to the ancestors and Odin
To those before me I'll stay loyal
I'll stay true...Asatru
