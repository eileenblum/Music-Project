The full moon shine guides our lonely path
Through landscapes of ice &amp; death
Where the fallen are covered by snow &amp; frost
In solitude they took their last breath

Endless seems that final march
The stars sparkle from far away
All light is gone, all hope is lost
...

The northern wind is becoming stronger
Like a hand is grasping for life
Tired and weak through deepest snow
But unconquered the will to survive

No life dwells here; we carry on
The horizon so dark; the march so long
Through that desert of winter so cold
Through that valley of sorrow so old

We keep the secret of a kind yet gone
We keep the memory to the children of the sun
The ancient cradle is calling &amp; we return
Following the path into the north

As our homes are destroyed; in the fog we'll hide
Our solar cross is shining so bright
Guiding our path through that endless night
Until we will see the hyperborean light
