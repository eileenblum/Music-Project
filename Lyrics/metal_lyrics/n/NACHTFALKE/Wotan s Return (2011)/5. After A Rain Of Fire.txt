In the depths of isolation
A new kind of strength is born
As the darkness seems eternally
The oath of blood is sworn

As the times are slowly changing
The world is rotten to the core
Awake the wrath of Fenris
And unleash the final war

Turn the runic might of Algiz
To spread the poisoned breath
As Yggdrasil is falling
The world shall face death

Channeling the cosmic powers
Into a Blitzkrieg against life
All prayers remain unheard
And Nidhoegg will arise

The sunwheel is swirling
The horizon stands aflame
A new age is now dawning
And a new kind will reign

For we left the ancient path
We just get what we deserve
After a rain of fire
Shall arise a new earth
