Upon the black northern sea, a ship is sailing
a ship full of man proud and brave
they're looking for new ground to live on it,
with swords, axes of steel they're armed
and sailing to the end of the world
afraid to fall into the abyss, into their sure death

Left their home, their wife and children
and sailing into uncertainty
warriors, they are brave
and only the courageous could sail
after months it was done
hungry and without any power
they reached the green land
few of them sailing home
few of them were staying, to build villages
and waiting full of hope

Upon the black northern sea, a ship is sailing
vikings were on the quest for new ground
they come back with last power, back into their land
land of brave warriors.
