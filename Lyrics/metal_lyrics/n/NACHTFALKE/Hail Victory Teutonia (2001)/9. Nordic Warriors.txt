Thousand warriors roaming through the northern lands
and only related with Odin still.
One thought drives them along to fight
and die for their northern land
war, misery, fear and death to spread
it is a commandment no respect for life
only here to kill you just the warriors pray to Odin
Blood and honour - for life and death
Blodd and honour - is the warriors hightest law
Blood and honour - Odin
