Two ravens are flying over the my head
and when I was looking around
they dissappeared in the mist to Asgard north

In Valhalla, in Odins holy halls
On his shoulder they are telling
Fenris spites his cold breath
upon Midgard. Yggdrasil is frozen
and the people staring to death...Odin

Screaming they ask themself
Has gods left us
With roaring thunder voices
Odin is calling
bring Thor and his warrior
and let them move out to prevent Ragnarok
... Odin
