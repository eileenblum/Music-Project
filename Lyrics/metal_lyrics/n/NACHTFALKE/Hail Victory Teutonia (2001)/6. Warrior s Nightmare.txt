I was walking to the tree Yggdrasil
and laid myself unter its mighty crown
i wouldn't see anything drying i was sleeping

No sand, no lake, no waves
I didn't see Midgard nor Valhalla
only a yawning abyss
Ragnarok... the Ases fall

Under midgards sail another one was watching the black
red cockin the halls of hel
axe age, swordage, shield crash
wind time, wolf time
our army of brothers is fighting
against one another before Midgard falls
in a dreamI died with big pain
a sword bored deep into my heart
there I stand in the golden hall
where warroirs enjoy their honour
I'm falling in the battle
and Odin takes me into his legions until
