A horde of giants
Who pollute and exploite
Punished by Wotan
Who was betrayed

Christ greed and profit
Turned their hearts into stone
By thunder and lightning
They fall off their throne

The soul of Midgard
In mountains and trees
By the power of MjÃ¶lnir
Will again be free

Tornados and earthquakes
Lightnings and fire
Destroy the false world
Mother Nature's desire

The revenge of nature
Storms coming down
The wrath of old gods
Hail the new dawn
