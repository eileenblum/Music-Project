I fought many battles
Sacrificed you many men
Now the time has come
To see my ancestors again

Let me die Allfather
And awake in Valhall
My blood runs for you
That you can hear my call

My soul will be free
By a kiss of the valkyrie
Who takes me to Asgard
Wotan honours my bravery

I saw my last sunrise
Said my wife goodbye
Prepared to leave the world
Wotan let me die

My final battle waits
To show my loyalty
Dying with the sword in hands
I die to live eternally
