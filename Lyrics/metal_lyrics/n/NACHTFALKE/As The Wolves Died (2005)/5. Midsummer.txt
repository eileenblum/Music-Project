The longest night
Rhythmic beats of a drum
Coldness is going
A new summer will come

The golden sun disappears
behind the horizon
The quickest night
Before a new rising

Midsummer
Gives new life
Midsummer
Gives new strength

The marriage between
Darkness and pure light
Between earth and sun
Giving hope and pride

We will celebrate
That folkish event
For the new prosperity
Of our land

Midsummer
Secures the harvest
Midsummer
Gives new warmth
