The smell of blood
Grey shadows in the night
A wolfpack hunting
Comrades side by side

The dawn of the ancient
Of pagan wisdom
The old way awakes with
battle pride and freedom

Geri and Freki
Symbols of the great hunt
Ulfhetnirs might
For glory they are bound

Anger and fury
Let their eyes burn
Paganism will awake
When the wolves return

Free your heathen soul
Hunt and kill
For gods and ancestors
Hunt and kill
