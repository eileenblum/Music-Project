Time of the Leaving moon
hordes appear on the horizon
wild screams in the morning
the horn sounds the warning

Asgard prepares defiance
invaded by giants
weapons for the Einjerjer
so starts the nightmare

Wigrid - the battle place
armies stood face to face
naglfar arrives
to end the holy lifes

Ancient Yggdrasil fall
fire destroyed all
Midgard died in flames
Odin, Thor - only names

Sun's daughter rises
humanity survives
Yggdrrasil got back it's might
Asgard shines in new pride

Ragnarok - Endkampf
reiews the world
Ragnarok - final war
destroys the old
