The landscape of mountains
the peak white of snow
wide fresh meadows
joy and pride they show

The beautiful forests
with old holy trees
the souls of earth
forever will be

Glorious nature - glorious past
pagan spirit will everlast
wolf and raven - symbol of creed
we awake - Wotan will lead

The shores of fatherland
the blue clear sea
with white fine sound
part of our identity

Sun and moon are watching
protecting our heathendom
from the Alps to Baltic Sea
our immortal home

Glorious nature - glorious past
pagan spirit will everlast
wolf and raven - symbol of creed
we awake - Wotan will lead
