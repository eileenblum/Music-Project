When the Sun died
only the strong survived
hear the song of the immortal ones
hear the song of Odins sons

Wild and fearless like the beats
they killed the Romans. Arabs and priests
one eyed Odin nailed these men
in peace and when they attacked again

Berserker - rage comes from the heart
Berserker - let the bloodly battle start
Berserker - With the sword of the holy steel
Berserker - that's the Triumph of the will

Magic drink let your hate grow
they fought on sea, in dessert and snow
couldn't be beat by Christian scum
Pagans awake! Our time will come!

The mystery of the endless hate
in our hearts eternally waits
till the time fight goes on
and the final war is one
