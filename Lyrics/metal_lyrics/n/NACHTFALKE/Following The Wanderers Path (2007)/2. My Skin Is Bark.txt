Beneath the great elder
Dissapearing in cold night sky

Gazes down
From those heights
Begins to drown
Into my eyes

And was mortal was once
Weak and meaningless like you
Changes slowly, painful
Changes flesh and bone

And my skin
Turns pale and
Runs dry while I

Gaze into 
The darkness
Overwhelming me

And was mortal was once
Weak and meaningless like you
Changes slowly, painful
Changes flesh and bone

Beneath our fathers 
I become a part..

Of the night and
Of the woods
I adore

Of nature
And the rune
Who armores

In me

I'm
Drowning down
What was shall never be again
Drowning down
What lives shall never rise again
Drowning down
Become one
Drowning down
Become one

What was 
Shall never be again
What lives
Shall never rise again

The sun who rests behond the hills
The runes among the hidden land
The seas of light and endless fields
The pounding gearts in living men
