As the stars encloake the earth
The moonlight silver dims
Enlights the falcons nightly skies
Above these woods unseen

Black the wolves eye hunting shades
Beneath the mourning trees
Dark the place where stags gathered
Listen to the whispering leaves

As a falcon through the night

A lake between those wooden hills
Lies gazing at the night
Keeps secrets drown-reflecting bright
Upon the falcons eye

And ancient runes carved deep in bark
Beware our heathen souls
Carried by the winds up high
As a falcon through the night
