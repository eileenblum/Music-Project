Where no sunlight breaks
The blind eyes of those
Who wait for their death
Hidden by earth in the halls of Hel

Surrounded by the river Gjoell
A golden bridge
For all lost souls
For all lost lifes

No return no more
No time, no space
Nor hunger, pain
Nor blood in vein

Halls of darkness
Halls of emptyness
Indifference and
Deaf insanity

To walk these halls
In every night
To see the few
Who were once near

Awaiting just the crow of Fialar
These dreams of death
All yours now
The northstar calls
