For us to feel,
The immortalitys proud,
For us to see,
All the lifes that were bound
and noone knows
when the time will arrive
when we march out
for the end of all live

now time has come
and wodan calls us by
weÂ´re riding out
side by side
eternal life
will now come
to an end
into death
weÂ´ll ride

three years of war
and the winter passed by
stars are fallin down
and the earth has gone dry
naglfar sails
fenriswolf spits its fire
giants march out
gjallarhorn calls the fighters

oh father
let you never break our hearts
now that the time
has arrived
final battle
will end of all our lifes
still weÂ´re marching on

under the sign
of the hammer we shall die
the great father leads our way
this is the time
the world will burn afar
this is RAGNAROCK
