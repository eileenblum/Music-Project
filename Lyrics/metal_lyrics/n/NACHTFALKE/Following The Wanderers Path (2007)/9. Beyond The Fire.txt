So much time
spend to watch the sky
Waiting for a sign
All the things
dear and precious ones
all dead and dying
Will go by
For ages
I am here
So long for thee
Here to see
Fire burns the skies

Many lifes
Lost to save our home
Noone's left fighting
The sun is dead
Water drowns the fields
Nine worlds are dying

Time
Passing by
Through ages
Will it end?
Am I here?
So hard to see
Life and Dead at once/in one

Time
Has gone by
For ages
We were here
So far away
Now to see
Few steps to go

See new life
Dwelling from within 
A new kind rising
Another sun
follows in it's mother's realm
Still runes are shining

See 
Once again
My brother, than
Close your eyes
Forevermore
To see in the skies
The gates are opened wide
