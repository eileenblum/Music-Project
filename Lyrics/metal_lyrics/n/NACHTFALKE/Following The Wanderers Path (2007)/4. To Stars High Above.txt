The twilight fades, embraces dark
My eyes, my heart and soul
From ages passed by so far I
Hear what ancestors have sworn

"By the sword in my hand
And the everdark forests
By the elders whispering galdr
And the scream of the ravens"

The flowing time surrounds my heart
As I stand on mountains high
Watch the land which torns apart
Sleeping beneathe silver lights

"By blood flowing through our veins
And the everlasting hunting wolves
By the golden hall awaiting us
And the one-eyed father

"Those woods we hid our wifes and descendants
These hills of heathen pride
These swamps and fields we buried our fathers and brothers
Shall be ours again"

These words kept deep inside
From spirits guiding me
From now my journey starts
Regain this land and set it free

To stars high above I raise my sword
