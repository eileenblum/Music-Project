[Intro]
Beneath the Mountain's arm
Within the wizard's vale
A great ring-wall of stone
Like towering cliffs
Stood out from the shelter
Of the mountain side
Through years uncounted
Had stood that ancient place
That man called Valhall

Welcome, my lords, to Valhall...

From the north we came
To a battle we ride
Hold high our hand
With Odin on my side
With axes of steel
And bloodred swords
Killing the enemies
In the name of the Gods

Valhalla - open the gates
Valhalla - home of the Gods
Valhalla - open the gates
Valhalla - A warrior's dream

The skyline's in flames
By the power of Thor
The hammer crushes down
Our victory is near
With power and might
Warriors of steel
Hallowed by the fight
Valhalla is near

Valhalla - open the gates
Valhalla - home of the Gods
Valhalla - open the gates
Valhalla - power and might
