Great battles under the north star
Fighting for honour and blood
With iron will under the sun wheel
Hallowed be the fight

Remember the fallen heroes
It's a fine day to die

Heroism in the blitzkrieg
Baptized with flesh and steel
Bounded by the sun wheel
Hallowed be the war

Remember the fallen heroes
It's a fine day to die

Marching through the ruins
Hold high our right hands
Killing under the sun wheel
Hallowed be the death

Remember the fallen heroes
It's a fine day to die
