In just one breath
Your dreams will fade
A moment in time
For fear to embrace

The future... is my enemy
Long days.... and endless nights

Pain awakes my sleep
And ends in a silent barrage of calm

Look at me though jaded eyes
Forever see the mask I wear
Never feel pity for me
It's the way my life lives

Beaten by the only life I know
Forced upon the spirit seed
I only wish I had the strength
To say goodbye

At what time did you turn your back?
I pay for this with every breath
And all you do is preach through man
Of how merciful you can be

Then you shall not fail
For every time you close your eyes
I'll be there to greet you
