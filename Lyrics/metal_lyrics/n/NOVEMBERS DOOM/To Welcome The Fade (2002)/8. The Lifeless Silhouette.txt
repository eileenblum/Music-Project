I just want to close my eyes
So I can forget about today
Forget about what lies tomorrow
And only take place in the realm of paradise
To be beaten each day
And lower my head
As if its my own fault
Forgotten about as night falls

Restless nights that are filled with guilt
And invite me into their empty embrace
I never saw this coming
And I now know that i'm not alone
I can only wish that i'm the last
And no one will suffer my fate
It would take an eternity in hell
For my heart to rest in peace.

To strike down this hate filled soul
And give back the pain you've caused
Would only satisfy
My craving for blood.

I will see you in the end
And I will laugh at your pain
So I damn your fucking life
And I pray you suffer long
And all the angels turn their backs
From the site of your pitiful face
No God will save your soul
For there is no love for you
You left that all behind
The day you learned to fucking speak
