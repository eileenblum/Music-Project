On the days you long for me
And the cold nights of grey

(Hear me)

I ask you to forgive me
And bow my head in shame

(Feel me)

I promise, I will never leave you
I will not go on without you
If the light calls upon me
I will remain, waiting for you

(Live for me)

I've never felt so empty before
I never cared more for us

(Pray for me)

I promise, I will never leave you
I will not go on without you
If the light calls upon me
I will remain, waiting for you

Somewhere along the days of my life
I found my faith in you

(Cry for me)
