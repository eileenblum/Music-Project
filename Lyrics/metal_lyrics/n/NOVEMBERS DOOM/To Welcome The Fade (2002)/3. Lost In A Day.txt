I can't control when I was afraid
So far away, from any choice I have
Here in this day, I continue to fear
Simple as I am, It's always on my mind

Somewhere inside, a voice is heard
To remind me that I have lost control

I have lost my will, to continue this way
With every waking breath, I decide...
How I live my life is far from normal days
See my downward fall, and allow me to lie

Somewhere inside, a voice is heard
To remind me that I have lost control

I give into my life, and color it with black
I listen to my heart, and hear nothing
If every day is cold, and the skies have turned to gray
Only then will I be happy with this pain

I have come to realize, my trials are before me
These are the rules set forth, to be lost in a day

I can't control when I was afraid
So far away, from any choice I have
Here in this day, I continue to fear
Simple as I am, to be lost in a day
