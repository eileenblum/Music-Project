She once told me the box is where it lives
Within those six sides, the enemy hides
The power escapes under its cold breath
And itâs my responsibility to watch it die.

These years provide the stepping stone
And it grows stronger before my eyes
I chose to keep it alive
I will choose when it dies

No prayer, no hope, no wicked way
A violent path of a fantastic mistake
Dark corners where seclusion resides
A funeral to escape her fearful gaze

These years provide the stepping stone
And it grows stronger before my eyes
I chose to keep it alive
I will choose when it dies

A sickening sound of clawing, trying to escape
Sealed tight, no air, and no light
It needs nothing more then hate to exist
I inherit this curse

Like the scientist before the dawn
A poison I create with stunning envy
Asphyxiate the war that lives inside
Remove the life and silence the cries

Donât you dare attempt to understand
You couldnât pretend, not then or now
Iâve fathered this prison for too many years
Kept alive to one day crush all dreams

Within six sides, the enemy hides
The power escapes under its cold breath
Itâs my responsibility to watch it die
I once told her the box is where it died
