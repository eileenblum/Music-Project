The dark host where green stands tall
The emotion of Summer fades
Conscience versus consequence
With a pure possession of fall

This is the law, the law of the land
Where Angels earn their keep
The dark light, the dark light curse
We cheated our way to midnight

Enjoy the season before Winter arrives
And bitter cold kills vibrant life
We await our ghost, and it will bring pain
I hope you enjoy your fall

This is the law, the law of the land
Where Angels earn their keep
The dark light, the dark light curse
We cheated our way to midnight

Black is the soul of a dying sun, just before aphotic calm
The moment the darkness arrives, be strong and be bold

Remember the day, you said âforever?â
Itâs so unclear exactly what you meant

Cloud cover erased the sunlight
Itâs much too late to wish for day
No oneâs listening to empty prayers
Autumnâs spirit gathers our hearts

Here we are in the absence of light
Where the nightâs chill touches our skin
This is the time where nothing matters
When clouds cover in nightly shade
Where are the friends who promised loyalty?
I never realized how wonderful it was
I look back on that day of promise
And now I understand âForever.â

Black is the soul of a dying sun, just before aphotic calm
The moment the darkness arrives, be strong and be bold
