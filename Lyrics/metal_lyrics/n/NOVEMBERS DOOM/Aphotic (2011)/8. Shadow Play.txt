A single movement attracts my attention
A quick turn to see it disappear
My struggle to witness what is real
Thoughts prey on a realistic view

Here is where the daylight fade
Darkness leans on a morbid cain

Thoughtâs deprived of sterile day
A haunting by the shadow play
So very still and silent I lay
To trace your steps through shadows way

The shadow represents a time before I knew
A presence felt, cold and by my side
I am your captive audience
Show yourself, and prove I am not mad

Here is where the daylight fade
Darkness leans on a morbid cain

Thoughtâs deprived of sterile day
A haunting by the shadow play
So very still and silent I lay
To trace your steps through shadows way

I can hear you. I know you are there.
Your outline against the wall betrays
Standing in the dark, lurking in my dreams
I can hear your breathing across the room

Insignificant within the infinite
A road I have travelled many of day
Swallowed by the black in nights sky
Left to admire the beautiful failure

Not much will become of me this night
Not any night when the gallows fill
Sleep will find the deserts sand
This crushing fall steals my breath away

Thoughtâs deprived of sterile day
A haunting by the shadow play
So very still and silent I lay
To trace your steps through shadows way
