There's no easy way to see it disappear
Always dreaming of what could have been
Who will be there to hold you
As the morning light breaks
We long to be there for you
And we can only hope you knew

Deeper scars then any wound could be
Cold is the way, and it will never leave
The great healer, was our deceiver
It's hard to close my eyes in the dark

We'll never know what could have been
As we try to understand this
We miss so much, what we never knew
As we carry on without you
When the rain begins to fall
We protect pure innocence
Empty arms, we're changed forever
When two hearts break together

Deeper scars then any wound could be
Cold is the way, and it will never leave
The great healer, was our deceiver
It's hard to close my eyes in the dark

We'll never know what could have been
As we try to understand this
We miss so much, what we never knew
As we carry on without you
When the rain begins to fall
We protect pure innocence
Empty arms, we're changed forever
When two hearts break together
