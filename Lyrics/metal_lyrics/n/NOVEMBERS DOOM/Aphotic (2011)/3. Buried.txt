I will drag you down to the earth
I will torture you as you once did to me
I will fill your soul with pain
I will make you pray for your death

The darkest place is where I make you mine
Deep within the human heart
Hidden away from the eyes of your kind
No hopeâ¦ No faithâ¦ No light...

I will bury your flesh in the ground
I will cover you with soil
I will never allow your remains to be found
I will die with the truth

The darkest place is where I make you mine
Deep within the human heart
Hidden away from the eyes of your kind
No hopeâ¦ No faithâ¦ No light...

When temptation grabs ahold
To sing a dirge of defeat
This weary soul can not shake the agony
No patience for believers
Despair bleeds hopelessness
These thoughts leave me drained
Futile and frail where light has died

The darkest place is where I make you mine
Deep within the human heart
Hidden away from the eyes of your kind
No hopeâ¦ No faithâ¦ No light...

I have been broken a hundred times
Beaten and battered forever scorned
Living life with the rope around my neck
Just one push from the edge of life
