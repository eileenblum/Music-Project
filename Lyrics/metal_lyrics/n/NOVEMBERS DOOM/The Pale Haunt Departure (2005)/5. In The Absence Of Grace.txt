Heaven is so far away from this Hell, Carried by the wings of shadows pain
Why did you turn your back, And leave me without your grace
Fallen so far away from the light, Courage will no longer be by my side
I stand here all alone, Waiting for you to see my need

I'll give my life for you, You'll see the fallen man

Heaven is so far away from this Hell, Carried by the wings of shadows pain
Why did you turn your back, And leave me without your grace
Fallen so far away from the light, Courage will no longer be by my side
I stand here all alone, Waiting for you to see my need

I'll give my life for you, You'll see the fallen man

I had trust in you, no more lies, I end this now, and walk away
So pathetic it's come to this, If you only could see my side
I live with this every day, and the struggle overwhelms me

For the loveless, And for my wake

Only when I close my eyes, And the day draws to an end
Thoughts of you stronger then me, increase my faith in hate

For the child, And for my heart

Only when I close my eyes, And the day draws to an end
Thoughts of you stronger then me, Increase my faith in hate

Always dreaming of better days, Since cast out from your sight
I'll live with the life I lead, And smile that you're no more

Why did you turn your back, And leave me without your grace
Fallen so far away from the light, Courage will no longer be by my side
I stand here all alone, Waiting for you to see my need

I'll give my life for you, You'll see the fallen man
I'll give my life for you, You'll see the fallen man
