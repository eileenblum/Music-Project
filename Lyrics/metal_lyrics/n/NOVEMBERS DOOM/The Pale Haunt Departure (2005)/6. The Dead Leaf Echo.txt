Since the day I let you believe, that a grand life I would provide
I am haunted by the failure you see before you, consuming the echo
To travel the road of our dreams, with my back against the wall

All I can do, is look the other way, and pretend that your face held a 
smile.
Not to see your sullen eyes, staring past my soul, into the darkness of 
night.
I feel I've failed you, when we both know, I never had the chance, to say 
hello.

Far away from your warmth I fade
Silently, I bid you farewell, and wallow in the moment

So very small, this distance between us, to travel so long, and gain no 
ground
The very face I see in the mirror, knows the truth behind the lies
For my trust, I hear the dead leaf echo, and the answer awaits us on the 
other side

Far away from your warmth I fade
Silently, I bid you farewell, and wallow in the moment

Looking back to the days when we were poor, and all we had was each other
You looked so sad, and almost ashamed to have me at your side

In circles spins my mind, and the vertigo makes me sick

All I can do, is look the other way, and pretend that your face held a 
smile.
Not to see your sullen eyes, staring past my soul, into the darkness of 
night.
I feel I've failed you, when we both know, I never had the chance, to say 
hello.
