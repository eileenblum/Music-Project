It's all so clear to me now
A fraction of the man I used to be
For every breath I take draws in the fear
Only I know that the worst is yet to come

I live in a dark world, where no light shines through
I carry this burden with every step I take
Thrust myself into a new days end
And focus on the hour glass, to help pass the time

Day to day I push myself on
My facade can fool the strongest mind
And my loved ones can only watch from afar
A single mirror to view the void

Tragic yesterdays, and unseen futures sleep
Footprints in the blood from my wounded heart
My dark world is where I call home
Until the day comes, and the light calls my name

My arcane cell is covered in resent
I never asked for any of this
I follow the path which leads me to nothing
Searching for my smile I lost long ago

I stand alone in the company of none
Cheated by reality, philosopher of the gray
A brave inner child stands strong in refuse
A treasure of impurity will find a way to breed
