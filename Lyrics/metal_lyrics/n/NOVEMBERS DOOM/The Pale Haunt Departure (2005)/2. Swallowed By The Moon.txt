I'm sorry you will never know me,
But know I always loved you.

Will you remember when I kept you safe?
Will you remember when I made you smile?
Once again the daylight fades, and I'm swallowed by the moon
Will tomorrow bring a new day of hope?
Will this experience fill you with rage?

The enemy time, knocks at my home
I can no longer hide
Please forgive me, I never meant to leave
But know that I had you as my final thought

Will you remember when I held you tight?
Will you remember the sound of my voice?
Once again the daylight fades, and I'm swallowed by the moon
Will this experience scar your fragile mind?
Will you remember when we would both laugh?

Memories is all that you have
And I'm sorry I failed you in life
I wanted more for you then I could provide
Be strong and make your mother proud

Don't cry... The tears in your eyes
My time... To say my goodbyes
Heaven waits... My soul to arise
Torture, torture... My pain finally dies

Will you remember that I tried my best?
Will you remember the father I was?
Once again the daylight fades, and I'm swallowed by the moon
Will you look back and smile for me?
Will you remember me when I have gone?

Memories is all that you have
And I'm sorry I failed you in life
I wanted more for you then I could provide
Be strong and make your mother proud
