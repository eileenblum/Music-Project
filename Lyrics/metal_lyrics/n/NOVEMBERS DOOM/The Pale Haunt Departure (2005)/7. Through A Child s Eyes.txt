I once had a vision
the beauty of two graced the sky
It left me with nothing but hurt
For I knew this couldn't be true

Looking back through a childs eyes
I have been betrayed by time
Now I dream with a sense of pride
And I grieve the shame of mankind

I once was left behind
All the promises and empty words
Forced me to walk upon the earth
Alone in the shadow of man

Looking back through a childs eyes
I have been betrayed by time
Now I dream with a sense of pride
I grieve the shame of mankind

I once had a vision
The fall of man before its time
Again I knew with innocent eyes
You should have saved us all

Looking back through a childs eyes
I have been betrayed by time
Now I dream with a sense of pride
I grieve the shame of mankind
