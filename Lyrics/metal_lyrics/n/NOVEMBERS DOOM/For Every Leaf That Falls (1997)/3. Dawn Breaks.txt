Dawn Breaks
And here we walk eluding the night
Telling you tales of how I am lost
You know things now that I can't explain
And I must avoid your beg for words

I can see by the look in your eyes
The trust you once had is gone

I can't hide from what I am
Come with me and leave this behind
Close your eyes and dream of me
Waste not your time for now dawn breaks

Shield myself from the tears on your cheek
Open my arms to greet your embrace

Hold me closely and absorb my warmth
Let me go now and tremble alone

And here we walk eluding the night
Telling you tales of how I am lost
You know things now that I can't explain
And I must avoid your beg for words

I can't hide from what I am
Come with me and leave this behind
Close your eyes and dream of me
Waste not your time for now dawn breaks

Together we can hear
The screaming butterfly
United as one
Gods will fall to their knees
