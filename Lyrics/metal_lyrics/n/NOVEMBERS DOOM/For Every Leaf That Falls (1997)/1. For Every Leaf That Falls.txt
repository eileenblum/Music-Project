Embrace the silence
And listen to me
Our time is short
And my words are pure
For every song the angels sing
And for every leaf that falls
I will be thinking of you
And I'll blow you a kiss
I used to dream of the blue in your eyes
Now my dreams are color blind
Clenching my fist to crush this pain
Its always the hate in my smile that devours me
Transcending down far beneath my means
A final breath of you to keep with me
Infantile tears are melting the morning snow
And shiver I will, for the heat in you is gone
Never forget to smile
As you look upon this world
somewhere I'll remain alone
thinking of the morning past
