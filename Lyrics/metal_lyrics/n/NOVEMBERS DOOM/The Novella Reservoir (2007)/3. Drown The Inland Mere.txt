A gray line divides where the shadows blur
There is nothing left within your empty smile
Nothing will change, the tide will still rise

Hold me under water
Drown the inland mere

Into this darkness I forever hold my loss
Only a moments time to scream my name

A shell of what I was, Iâll never let you go
After all you said in vein, a weaker soul am I
This is my final struggle, this is my dying day

Hold me under water
Drown the inland mere

Into this darkness I forever hold my loss
Only a moments time to scream my name

No brother to man who rapes his own
A cell to rot the fabric of flesh
Why are you still smiling?
Itâs pity I feel for the life thatâs yours

The haunting voice of liberated souls
The death knell proudly chimes
Nothing but slaves in the unwilling fall

Hold me under water
Drown the inland mere

Into this darkness I forever hold my loss
Only a moments time to scream my name
