For many years youâve been my life, Iâve been thankful for our time
From rainy days to snow filled nights, youâve always been there for me

And nows the time I say farewell, for Iâm leaving this all behind me
To walk away with tears and pride, mourn not the loss, honor the memory

For lives Iâve touched, and those returned, this was only a moment in time
I need you to know before Iâm gone, Itâs always been for you

And nows the time I say farewell, for Iâm leaving this all behind me
To walk away with tears and pride, mourn not the loss, honor the memory

I will miss our days of glory, along with the hardship and loss
Itâs all been a friend to me, in the end, this reflection Iâll embrace

And nows the time I say farewell, for Iâm leaving this all behind me
To walk away with tears and pride, mourn not the loss, honor the memory
