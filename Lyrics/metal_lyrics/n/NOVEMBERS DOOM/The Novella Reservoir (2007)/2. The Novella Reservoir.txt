Hurtful summoning of Gods left behind
And with great cause youâll suffer in pain
Your words fall upon deaf ears
Never again to swallow the lies

Youâre not the savior of this world, a simple life has come to pass
Youâre not the answer to my faith, Iâll never give you what you need

I am the darkness in your dreams
Your vile heart keeps me alive
After all the pain that youâve been through
Do you believe that heâll be there for you?

Youâre not the savior of this world, a simple life has come to pass
Youâre not the answer to my faith, Iâll never give you what you need

Novella reservoir tortures me, only the broken remain

Final days arrive and the curtain drops
The only face youâll see is that of shame
Where do you think he gets his strength?
Drawn from the mindless and empty as them

Youâre not the savior of this world, a simple life has come to pass
Youâre not the answer to my faith, Iâll never give you what you need
