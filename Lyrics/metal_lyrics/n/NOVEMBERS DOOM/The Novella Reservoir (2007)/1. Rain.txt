Becoming one with madness, a chaos to embrace
Struggling for my sanity, clear skies turning gray
My demons stand before me, and taunt my every thought
The only way to cleanse my soul, is drown my dirt with rain

Water now engulfs me, it burns my sins away
Enemy preys upon my flesh as darkness burns the sky
Surface drifting further, taken from my sight
The only way to cleanse my soul, is drown my dirt with rain

No one to save me, a promise to be made
For heartsick memories, below the murky wake

In shallow water, I will drown unfeigned
My death knell rings below the flood
To wash away my sins of yesterday
And give me the chance to murder your name again

Becoming one with madness, a chaos to embrace
Struggling for my sanity, clear skies turning gray
My demons stand before me, and taunt my every thought
The only way to cleanse my soul, is drown my dirt with rain

In shallow water, I will drown unfeigned
My death knell rings below the flood
To wash away my sins of yesterday
And give me the chance to murder your name again
