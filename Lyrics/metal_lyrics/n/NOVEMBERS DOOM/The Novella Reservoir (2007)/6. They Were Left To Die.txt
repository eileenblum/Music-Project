Drawn upon insight to purify
Voices call to a sinners world

One by one, gagged and bound
Hollow eyes, they were left to die

Right from wrong, lines divide
Black and White, obey his word
Follow the path those blindly walk
Life of fear for the dying weak

One by one, gagged and bound
Hollow eyes, they were left to die

No remorse for tales told
Cities burned in perfect wrath
Cleansing life for eternal bliss
Paradise for those who fall

One by one, gagged and bound
Hollow eyes, they were left to die

Drawn upon insight to purify
Voices call to a sinners world

Glimmer of white to pierce the throat
Crestfallen, youâre the only one
Bathe in moonlight against his law
The cold grip of lust is powerless

Will you repent and follow his lead
Before time steals the only life you have
Beaten and torn, displayed for spite
The strong are nailed and cast aside

One by one, gagged and bound
Hollow eyes, they were left to die
