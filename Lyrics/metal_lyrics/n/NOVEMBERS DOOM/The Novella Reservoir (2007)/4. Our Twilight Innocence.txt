I wonder what she dreams about?
Perhaps my arms that hold her tight?
Or the love that warms her heart?
Peaceful sleep till dawns new day

I will always keep watch over you
To keep you safe when you are scared

Before her sleep, she lies awake
With wonder and angelic thought
So much to learn in one lifetime
Hand in hand weâll walk for hours

When the water becomes to deep
Iâll be the one who pulls you free

Your dreams Inspire me to be the best man I can be
To never let you down and make you proud of me
Someday youâll be on your own
Memories will make you smile
Think back to those dreams to remember me

I wonder what she dreams about?
Perhaps my arms that hold her tight?
Or the love that warms her heart?
Peaceful sleep till dawns new day

I will always keep watch over you
To keep you safe when you are scared
