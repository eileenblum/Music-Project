Cowards form the veil. Sampling of the salt. Desire looking glass.
In evening they shall come. Pity stains our hands. Insects bite my
eyes. Forever calling home. Reaping forest calm. Long painful
hymns, a dirge of blackened day. Falling to my knees to kiss the
horses tongue. Moonlight invades, cancerous lust. Drawing a smile,
bold men have tried. With sugar we taste, through darkness we
fall. In memories lost hope, I seal my eyes. Through vertigo's
touch, and a northern winds breeze, onward I search and forever
I'm lost. It feels like an eternity since I last saw the light on
your face, and if I recall, you left me the wind and taught me to
fly. I must have you for one last time and I will pay for my sins
with one thousand lashes from the roses stem across the very chest
that holds my beating heart.
