Embrace the silence and listen to me. Our time is short and my
words are pure. For every song the angels sing and for every leaf
that falls, I will be thinking of you and I'll blow you a kiss. I
used to dream of the blue in your eyes, now my dreams are color
blind. Clenching my fist to crush this pain, Its always the hate
in my smile that devours me. Transcending down far beneath my
means. A final breath of you to keep with me. Infantile tears are
melting the morning snow. And shiver I will, for the heat in you
is gone. Never forget to smile as you look upon this world.
Somewhere I'll remain alone thinking of the morning past.
