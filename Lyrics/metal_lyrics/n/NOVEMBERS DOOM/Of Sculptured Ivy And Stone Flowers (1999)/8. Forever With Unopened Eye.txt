Enjoy the sunlight and ride the winds. Forever warm, for I see
now, happiness facades my sorrow. This outer smile is torn by
grief, and my sunlight soon fades away, and I watch in silence.
Lost here in a poetic trance, my paradise pounds inside my chest.
I remember the days forever with unopened eye. As quickly as it
all began, the darkness overwhelms my joy. How is this so? How can
it all be gone? Is there no solution? Welcome to my mind. Is there
no help for me? Forever with unopened eye.
