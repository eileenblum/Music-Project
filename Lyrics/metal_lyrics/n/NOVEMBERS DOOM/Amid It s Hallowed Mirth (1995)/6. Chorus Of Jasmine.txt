Between my love, and my heart lies a weeping willow. Shading the
secret of our yearning. This perfect place is ours. But the
sunrise is mine. It will always remind me of our passion. Gaze
into It's beauty and lose yourself in my arms. For this is a night
of pure perfection and nothing can take that away. Now my Eden has
a queen and I will stop at nothing to give you my rhapsody. Please
accept my life and in exchange, give yourself to me. You will have
no fears. I will protect you until I die but without you, my death
is certain. You're my inspiration. You're my thoughts and dreams.
I need your love. I need your sunshine. You're the one.
