Gorge in my darkness, for all to laugh at me. My undying love,
that you hold in chains. Bound by reality, controlling my every
thougt. Visions of your beauty, deep in my memory. Please try to
forgive me. The pain always returns. Yesterdays smile is tomorrows
tears. Oh God, What have I done? Our love together was strong. A
bond between two souls. Lost within my slumber. Tonight I sleep
alone. My mind no longer lusts, My heart no longer loves. Half my
life is gone from me. A mistake I must endure. Containing my
emotions, from time we spent alone. Surrender to my past, live
with a false sense of pride. Every time I close my eyes I yearn
the sweet scent of you Always remember the love we made and
cherish It's silent beauty The softness of your touch, the warm
glow of your skin Is in my every fantasy. Your velvet lips upon my
neck will release my torture inside.
