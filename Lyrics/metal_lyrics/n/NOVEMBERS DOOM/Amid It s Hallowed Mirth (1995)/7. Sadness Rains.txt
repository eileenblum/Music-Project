Mournful overcast, sorrowful state. Gray distant sky, pensive
turmoil. In heavy spirits, wretched, forlorn. Joyless and dismal,
stricken with grief. Lightning evades a world overhead. Angels in
tears, sadness rains. Pouring tear drops, from heavens above.
Essence of purity, on hell stricken land. Blind to the fact, no
shame in unleashed. Buried in agony, the storm prevails. One with
sadness, joined eternally. Wallow in misery, 'till death do us
part.
