Fear not my angel for the silent dove will take flight again. You
will never need your tears as long as the air is free to soar. So
smell the flower of hope and indulge in its sweet pollen. Examine
your body for it is a product of extreme beauty. Never enter a
state of lust without a vision of me and together we will rock the
pillars of heaven through a state of ecstasy. We watch the sun set
deep within the sky. we lose all thoughts of yesterday. Look deep
into my eyes and see the trust in me for I am a power stronger
then man. I am poetry in its purest form. Open your heart. Release
your soul Let me show you wonders you could only imagine. Let me
show you Amour of the harp.
