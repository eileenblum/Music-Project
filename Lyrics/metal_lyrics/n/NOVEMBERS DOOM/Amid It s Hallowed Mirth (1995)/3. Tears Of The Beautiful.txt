Please walk from the shadows. I want to see your eyes. They shine
of lost souls and compassion for life. I don't understand why do
you cry? The tears of the beautiful dry like moisture on a winters
day. Such happiness in her face and radiance in a smile. Although
I cannot hear her voice she speaks with the tongue of an angel.
Two souls dance in Novembers air depending on each others trus.t
Silently turning in circles following the soft violins. Can I be
so bold, as to ask for a kiss? All I dream is her, I've known her
forever. Please take my hand now And I'll lead you to the light.
Yet still confusion erupts. How can beauty as such weep in sorrow?
Embrace me and I promise the pain will diminish.
