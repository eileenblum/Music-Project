Sipping wine from the grail of vitality I seek the answers. Chosen
few have smelled this nectar And fewer have tasted its erotica The
focus of my journey Will shine the light of harmony. Lick the
drops of wine that trickle from my lips. Taste its sweetness For
you are closer to your God And I am a warrior of lost souls. Could
I be the God you seek? No. I am but a lonely man. A fool in the
eyes of the infinite. I crave the light of those who drink of my
grail. I get no response. A man with no tongue speaks no truth
Although, a women's scent speaks a thousand words. Do you
understand me now? It is I who wallows in Aurora's garden. You
must leave I now seek tranquility. Can this be found in the arms
of you? No. I think not. Smell upon my rose. Its fragrance is of a
virgin, pure and sweet. Its petals, soft like skin. Caress it.
Enjoy the feeling of life in your fingertips. Hold me close Let
our bodies become one. For then we are strong. Fear not, the pain
will soon be gone. A life of pleasure now begins. Here in Aurora's
garden.
