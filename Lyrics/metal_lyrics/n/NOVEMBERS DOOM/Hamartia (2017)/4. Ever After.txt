Waiting for the sun to shine
Fever grows to burn the soul
She's left in the cold of ruin
Left alone by your selfish pride

In the ever after
Where the sky opens to black
Wash the painted face away
And hide from the shallow

I refuse to accept your lies
The absent breath breathes down my spine
Decency is lost, The body shivers
Not from fear, from your vile way

In the ever after
Where the sky opens to black
Wash the painted face away
And hide from the shallow

Incapable of love
Intolerable shame
Voice denies the truth
From birth to the ground

Wading through fragments of her broken heart
Your name is carved onto every piece

In the ever after
Where the sky opens to black
Wash the painted face away
And hide from the shallow
