Wading though the days of old
Splinters pierce the skin
Finding no reason to hold the past
I wave goodbye with bloody hands

Burning bright, I'm lost in your light
Pausing my will to absorb the moment
Here at night, each time I touch your face
The days worries melt away

The only way for me to carry on
Was to awaken my devotion
I could never have the strength alone
This new life belongs to you 
To you

Burning bright, I'm lost in your light
Pausing my will to absorb the moment
Here at night, Each time I touch your face
The days worries melt away

Indifferent past, modern scars
Forward tomorrow, twice as far

We walked across the borderline
Take a pause and one deep breath
Meeting our eyes before we step
Forever forward, no turning back

Holding hands, knuckles white
Never greater to feel so alive
Moving on and side by side
Together a new day begins

Guided by the morning light
Illuminated through the distant dark
Moving fast and forging on
A great distance, effortlessly

We walked across the borderline
Take a pause and one deep breath
Meeting our eyes before we step
Forever forward, no turning back

Indifferent past, modern scars
Forward tomorrow, twice as far
