My god, what have you done?
Poison from the slime of the leech
This body bleeds black
Shadows of the cold bring hate

I'm the one who sees your best
I'm the one who feels your worst
I'm the one who smiles
I'll never be your fool

There was something in your eyes that night
Bleak and cold
I was the witness of your collapse
Through all the wallowing she rose

I'm the one who sees your best
I'm the one who feels your worst
I'm the one who smiles
I'll never be your fool

The harmony builds in starry skies
I remember when this was real
A gentle breeze that moves my thoughts
I won't remember you for long

A vast and open sea watching dusk arrive
My fleeting love drowns with the sun

Fade to obscurity

I'm the one who sees your best
I'm the one who feels your worst
I'm the one who smiles
I'll never be your fool

I'm the one who sees your best
I'm the one who feels your worst
I'm the one who smiles
I'll never be your fool
