I have never loathed so madly
To see my path so clearly
I am still breathing the poison
Crawl from the air that's burning
Survive your plague just one more day

Transcend the hatred violently
Waves in the red cloth
Wipe the blood pooled in my eyes

Striding fair beyond the boundaries
The ravaged earth I walk alone
A simple glance to see it all

Crawl from the air that's burning
Survive your plague just one more day

Transcend the hatred violently
Waves in the red cloth
Wipe the blood pooled in my eyes

Transcend the hatred violently
Waves in the red cloth
Wipe the blood pooled in my eyes

Careless are the whispers who scream out loud
No secrets will die with me
The vast and open sea will carry the word
Across the ears of the deafened morrow

Transcend the hatred violently
Waves in the red cloth
Wipe the blood pooled in my eyes
