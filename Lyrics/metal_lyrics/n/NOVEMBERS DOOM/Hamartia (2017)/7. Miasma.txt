Approaching the moment we knew would come
The time where you must leave this place
I wish that you could speak to me
To hear your voice againâ¦ Again

For all these years
You were my reason to love
And I begged you not to leave me

There's no life without you
I will always be alone

In this room you wither away
Praying for your end of days
I'll hold your hand until the end
My heart will never let you goâ¦ Let you go

For all these years
You were my reason to live
And I begged you not to leave me

There's no life without you
I will always be alone
There's no love without you
I will always be alone

I wish you could hear me
I have so much to say
My words are suffocating
Miasma steals my breath away

For all these years
You were my reason to breathe
And I begged you not to leave me

For all these years
You were my reason to love
And I begged you not to leave me

There's no love without you
I will always be alone
