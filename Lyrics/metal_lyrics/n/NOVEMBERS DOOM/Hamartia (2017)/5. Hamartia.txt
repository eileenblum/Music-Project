Reach for the stars
I want it all
Right here where the storm begins
Diminished by waste
Cursed by the one who stands
You can't steal my thoughts anymore
Crawling through these halls of misery
Who are you to say that love is dead?
This has always been about the heart
I have told so many lies protecting the drowning bride
You can't steal my thoughts anymore
Crawling through these halls of misery
Who are you to say that love is dead?
This has always been about the heart
The first side smiles with a certain charm
It has fools all those around me
