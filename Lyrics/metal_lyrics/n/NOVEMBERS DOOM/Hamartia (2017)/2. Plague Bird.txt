Dawn the mask to filter the scourge of love
Filled with juniper, mint and clove
Seen though the eyes of the plague bird
Bloodletting straight from the heart

Heavily waxed and sealed from the air
The vile presence burns the lungs

Rise the stench of black death
Rebalance the humors that bind

BREATHE - This air is poisoned with the past
SEE - My heart bleeds in misery
VEIL - To hide my eyes from the truth
RUN - Far from this life I knew

Drape of lies embrace the soul
Distracting sight from forward growth

Seen though the eyes of the plague bird
Bloodletting straight from the heart

BREATHE - This air is poisoned with the past
SEE - My heart bleeds in misery
VEIL - To hide my eyes from the truth
RUN - Far from this life I knew

Aromatic plume blankets the cold
Born with a consuming burn

BREATHE - This air is poisoned with the past
SEE - My heart bleeds in misery
VEIL - To hide my eyes from the truth
RUN - Far from this life I knew
