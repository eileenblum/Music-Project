Dense fog burns the sky
Vile air blisters earth

Run, run while you can
Every turn brings pain
Run, run while you can
Fear will collapse the lungs

You found me
Even through my best attempt to hide
I can feel this presence creeping so suddenly

I'm haunted by the ghost of yesterday
Visits my dreams and steals breath away
Relive the moments, I'm desperate to ignore
I don't want to feel this pain anymore

You show me
The mistakes in life I've made
I can see the disappointment in there eyes
And I know that I will likely die alone

I'm haunted by the ghost of yesterday
Visits my dreams and steals breath away
Relive the moments, I'm desperate to ignore
I don't want to feel this pain anymore

Shades of the past awhile [are vile?]
Impossible for the dark to cover

So run, run while you can
Soon
Your haunt will devour
