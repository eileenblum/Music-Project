I'm waiting to be someone else
When I can look back through the vacancy
Visit the grave where my soul is trapped
And tip my hat to the demons before me

In the glow of Devils light, I can seen the face of God
To judge the man that stands before the flame
It burns bright, cast the Devils light, my soul is in pain

Just once I want to see a tear
A small sign to show me you care
Stomach ache, heart acheâ¦
I'd rather die alone.

In the glow of Devils light, I have seen the face of God
To judge the man that stands before the flame
It burns bright, cast the Devils light, My soul is in pain

The limit of my mind has reached its end
I'll become the monster you say I am

In the glow of Devils light, I have seen the face of God
To judge the man that stands before the flame
It burns bright, cast the Devils light, my soul is in pain

In the glow of Devils light, I have seen the face of God
To judge the man that stands before the flame
It burns bright, cast the Devils light, my soul is in pain
