Not one day goes by that I don't realize
You're nothing without the pain
Deep within my heart, I know I've lost control
Temptation, you're dead to me

Pray to your God
Mourning the Lazarus regret

As the sky turns black your face remains the same
No beauty, just denial
All these years pass by, I tire of this life
I'm soulless, the aura fades

Pray to your God
Mourning the Lazarus regret
I'm crucified, to be the last one alive

The worst is not over
Nightmares have just begun
The demons of my future
Taunt me in my sleep

Torment within this test
Seclusion cannot be had
No serenity for the broken
We harbor the far between

Passing judgement over vile words now silent
Focus on death's disease
Anticipating my life's damnation
The first sign, it now begins

Pray to your God
Mourning the Lazarus regret
I'm crucified, to be the last one alive
