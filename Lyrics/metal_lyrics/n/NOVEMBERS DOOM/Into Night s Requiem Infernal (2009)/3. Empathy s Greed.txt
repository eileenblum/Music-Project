How could I know, just how you feel?
The deafening silence is too much to take

With just one wish
For morbid bliss
To seek the heart
And collide as fools

Drown my thoughts in a sea of laughter
Take in the air and seal my fate

With just one wish
For morbid bliss
To seek the heart
And collide as fools

Heal me, and forgive my past
Memories show me the dark
Bleed with me, To forget my sins
Set me free, I need this to end

Become the lie in the moment of truth
Cleanse my soul with imperfections glow

With just one wish
For morbid bliss
To seek the heart
And collide as fools

Heal me, and forgive my past
Memories show me the dark
Bleed with me, To forget my sins
Set me free, I need this to end

Distant vows conceal the hate
Empathy's greed is far away
