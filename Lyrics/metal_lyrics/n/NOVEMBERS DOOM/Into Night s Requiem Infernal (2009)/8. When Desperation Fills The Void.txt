The parting is now upon our kind
Dividing the weak from the strong
Left alone in the moonlight dance
Day to day we drift further and further away

I refuse to die for you
My scars are more then I need to prove
Tomorrow brings a life without grief
The powerless cause leads me to light again

You've turned your back on me for the last time
I close my eyes to ignore your black painted world
Forever tired of pretending I once believed
Punish me, but I'll no longer live this lie

I refuse to die for you
My scars are more then I need to prove
Tomorrow brings a life without grief
The powerless cause leads me to light again

The innocent no longer feeds my guilt
I have yet to walk away from the numbing fate
This passion I seek slips through my hands
The blood is my life, and I'm filled with envy

This is when you scream out loud
When the desperation has filled the void
Begin your walk, for the miles await
Bear your cross through destiny's end

I refuse to die for you
My scars are more then I need to prove
Tomorrow brings a life without grief
The powerless cause leads me to light again
