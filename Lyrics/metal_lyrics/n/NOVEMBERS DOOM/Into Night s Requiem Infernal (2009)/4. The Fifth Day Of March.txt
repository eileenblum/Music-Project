Where have you gone, so much was left unsaid
Just one more chance to speak to you again
I find myself at a loss for words
My search for answers only you would provide

All those years we watched you live your life
With sacrifice, the honor and the pride
What to do now, I have nowhere left to turn
The unknown calls to my deepest loss

I've lived the darkest day
On that fifth day of March
Words can't begin to say
Just how much we've lost

Time and time again, you told me you weren't scared
And I believed in your faith
I wish I had your strength, I wish I knew the truth
So hard to accept this is for real
If you only knew, the guilt I live with now
What if I made the wrong choice?

Go to her. She needs to know your safe
She would walk through fire to hear your voice again
She'll never be alone, I'll always keep her close
But you're the one she'll never leave behind

I've lived the darkest day
On that fifth day of March
Words can't begin to say
Just how much we've lost
