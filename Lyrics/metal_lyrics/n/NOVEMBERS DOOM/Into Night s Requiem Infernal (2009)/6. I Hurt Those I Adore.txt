The victim of fools that divide
Torn between right and wrong
Knowing change will bring rebirth
All but time that has passed me by

Please hear me now
Just before I fall from grace

Carry me far away
I can't stay here anymore
Fearful night, the dream is real
I hurt those I adore

It never ends, this hell, my foe
The failure of those who surround me
I cannot hide the truth anymore
Is there no one to save me?

Please hear me now
Just before I fall from grace

Carry me far away
I can't stay here anymore
Fearful night, the dream is real
I hurt those I adore

Why would I think you could save me
when you couldn't save yourself?
I've called to you for years
Never once have you listened to my plea

Please hear me now
Just before I fall from grace

Carry me far away
I can't stay here anymore
Fearful night, the dream is real
I hurt those I adore
