Falling down, far from Grace.
Confusing me, for these gifts I have received.
Challenging, the faith I have in tomorrow.
Open eyes, to witness this miracle.
Cure the sick, or destroy a world, this gift is mine, to wield its strength.
What's right and wrong,
It's my decision, no man alive, can deny me that.
Cloudy skies, and blood-filled moons, worldwide plagues, and raging tides.
Seven signs, To the end of time, this is all lies, I hold the only key.
why can't you see, I can show you his face.
If every fear of your life, can only be swept away.
Believe in my sanity, carried by faith,
the truth that binds, the words I speak.
Thunder claps, and angels cry, inside this prophet,
behold a new Messiah.
I can take you far away, far from your scarlet lives.
I hold tomorrow's fate and grip this entity.
Trust in me, I'll tell you all of final beauty, and dying smiles.
Put your faith in me.
Falling.
