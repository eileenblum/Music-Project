The scent of you is always on my mind,
searching for the strength to carry on.
Buried deep within my soul,
your memory will punish me.
I no longer see a future with your smile.
When shadows fall dark upon your stone,
and dying leaves have covered all the words,
I hold the answers to the questions that I dare not speak.
In this darkest hour I'm alone.
A careless walk through fields of virtue,
and calling out to every shattered dream.
Circling the innermost thoughts,
for this is the day I have truly died.
The scent of you is always on my mind,
searching for the strength to carry on.
Buried deep within my soul,
your memory will punish me.
I no longer see a future with your smile.
When shadows fall dark upon your stone,
and dying leaves have covered all the words,
I hold the answers to the questions that I dare not speak.
In this darkest hour I'm alone.
