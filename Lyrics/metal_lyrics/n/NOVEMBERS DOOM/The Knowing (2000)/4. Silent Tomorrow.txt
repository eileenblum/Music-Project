Eternity - A gift I no longer want.
Forever - I can't go on with these endless nights.
My sanity has been stripped away.
Everything is beauty, and I have no love to share.
Silent tomorrow, I want to live my life once more.
Visions of grandeur, I want to taste the void extreme.
Each time I close my eyes, I only wish for my end to come.
No angels sing for me, and the light of my life dims away.
Silent tomorrow, I want to live my life once more.
Visions of grandeur, I want to taste the void extreme.
Destiny awaits me, I cannot carry on this way.
Coward of the dream,
In silence I will rest my eyes.
Crippled by fear, the sights I see.
No means to this end.
This is my only way.
Silent tomorrow, I want to live my life once more.
Visions of grandeur, I want to taste the void extreme.
Destiny awaits me, I cannot carry on this way.
Coward of the dream,
In silence I will rest my eyes.
