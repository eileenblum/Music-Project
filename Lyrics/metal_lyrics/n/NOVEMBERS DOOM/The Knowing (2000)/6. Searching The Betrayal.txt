I have searched for the words and emptiness is all I find.
The countless lies of love that fell from spoken dreams. (her)
What do I say to a man who knows my thoughts?
I thought I loved you in the lifetime we shared,
but I always knew you were never the one.
Even though you made me your queen,
the feelings for you never grew.
Wasted time in life pass by, shattered mirrors we built as one.
An aging world of broken hearts
and I am added to the long list of souls.
I'll never regret giving my all for you and to my grave,
your betrayal will die. (her)
If we could go back, and repeat this life again,
I would stop at the day my love failed you.
I would pray to above for those feelings to return,
and not let my wandering eyes take me from you.
Know in my heart, that there is a place,
that your disappointment has broken.
