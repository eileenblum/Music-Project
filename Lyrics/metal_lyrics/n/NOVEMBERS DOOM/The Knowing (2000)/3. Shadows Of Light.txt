A dream, shown to me by countless shapes.
Visions that will never leave my mind.
Voices that cry out to me.
Saddened by the wars within,
and lifted high above the crowds below.
Spirit felt promises that wind the clocks of time,
and pass me by in a sudden rage of light.
In shadows I am prophecy.
In sunlight I am death.
On water I will always walk.
In fire no one burns.
Falling far from crimson skies,
all eyes rest upon me.
Enchanting winds that call your name,
and place fear in your smile.
I have been shown the end of my world,
and the beginning of the new age.
Red is cast upon my eyes.
I dream of the rain and smile.
Vary your speed to which you live,
and count every last grain of sand.
Clouds invade my thought no more.
Sunlight has drifted away.
May the moon above guide me, and save me from my pain.
Forgive me not, I'm losing control.
I fear the dreams that dance within.
How can I ever leave?
The goad of your tongue plunges into my soul
