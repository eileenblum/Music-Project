Tread lightly through the shadows
Out of sight from your God's eyes
In the city we walk for days
The mission of life's most awkward lull

Dodge the sun for the light is wasted
Searching for the criminal who stole your heart
Scour the dark while hunting the scum
The vile scent burns the air we breathe

He has what is mine, and I need it back
Taken without warning from the wounded one
Without permission makes you a thief
And your punishment will be bold

Dodge the sun for the light is wasted
Searching for the criminal who stole your heart
Scour the dark while hunting the scum
The vile scent burns the air we breathe

I live in animus to tear your world apart
I breathe the hate and my hate is pure
I'm hunting you down, that you can be certain of
And when I find you, may your God have mercy on your soul

The distance I travel, so far and so vast
My blood leaves this trail to find my way back
The flesh turns white for color is lost
This body is weak and slowly drying out

I will not hesitate when the time is before me
To strike the heart of the beast who dwells
Extinguish the life of that selfish sin
And carry your heart home in a golden case

Here I live in animus to tear your world apart
I breathe the hate and my hate is pure
I'm hunting you down, that you can be certain of
And when I find you, may your God have mercy on your soul
