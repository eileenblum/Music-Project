The air is thick, no stone unturned
The failure was yours to remind me
I tried my best for the waves of joy
But the darkness was overwhelming

One more song that belongs to me
To remind me of the days of my hate
The life, the pain, the shattered hope
For one last time, this is goodbye

The fight is gone, I have nothing left
I've long begged my final plea
With heartfelt hate, I prayed for your death
My implore was answered, I loom atop your grave

I wish you pain for eternity ahead
You deserve to suffer with this fate
looking back to the joyous days
So very few of these to draw from

The fight is gone, I have nothing left
I've long begged my final plea
With heartfelt hate, I prayed for your death
My implore was answered, I loom atop your grave

I've been waiting for so long
To see the life leave from your eyes 
I had a dream that you were scared
And it brought me so much joy
I hope you suffered at your end
You bled me out of my fear

The fight is gone, I have nothing left
I've long begged my final plea
With heartfelt hate, I prayed for your death
My implore was answered, I loom atop your grave

I'll visit your remains every chance I have
If only to laugh at your demise
I'll show you I have no regret
And we'll both indulge the lie

I can only hope that Hell is real
Where demons are eating your soul
The life, the pain, I love to hate you
Beneath the earth is where you rot
