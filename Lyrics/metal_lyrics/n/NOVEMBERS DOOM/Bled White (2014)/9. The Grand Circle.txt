When the cowardice reigns
Truth to be revealed
for this life is endless torture
And the failure continues to breed

Round it goes and doesn't stop
Like a drop of blood, perfectly shaped
The grad circle of life we live
The pain returns with a different face

What goes around, comes around
For every soul is alike
One betrayer, one deceiver
One of many, they all shatter the heart

Round it goes and doesn't stop
Like a drop of blood, perfectly shaped
The grad circle of life we live
The pain returns with a different face

Slipping between my fingers
Any hope of seeing the light
When the time and place is not my own
A ruthless game we play

Why must we be punished
For the crimes we did not commit?
This day is filled with disaster
And I fall between the lines

Waste no time on those undeserving
A hidden strength to drive your soul
You mean the world to those around you
And we'll dance until the sun shines

It took a lifetime to get here
And it starts anew
My voice will help guide the way
To show you salvation

What have you become
The thief of broken hearts
Collecting each piece along
Trophies for the ego's mind

Round it goes and doesn't stop
Like a drop of blood, perfectly shaped
The grad circle of life we live
The pain returns with a different face
