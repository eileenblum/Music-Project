I imagine the mirror on your wall
Reflecting years of forgotten past
Looking deep into the eyes that hide
I'm wishing for brighter days

Just breathe beautiful one
As life hands you a stunning smile
Wear the crown and hold the future
It gets better from here, just breathe

Lonely hearts with spirit crushed
Disrespecting from a venomous tongue
Turning blame onto yourself
In a world where the fault is not yours

Just breathe beautiful one
As life hands you a stunning smile
Wear the crown and hold the future
It gets better from here, just breathe

This is simply yours
All the people's force to bring
This is my attempt to heal your heart
To restore your faith that was taken away

Don't fade away
Stay where you are
I can give you my strength
And pick you up when you fall

Brighter days are on their way
For the darkness will carry on
Embrace the moon and see the stars
I know it's all for you

It gets better from here
Just breathe
