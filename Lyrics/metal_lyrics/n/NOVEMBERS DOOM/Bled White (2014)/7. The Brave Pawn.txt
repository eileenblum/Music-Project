I curse the day I believed in you
For I put my trust in your heart
I'm punished for the seeds I've sown
The fool had cost me more then words

I am the one possessed by night
The bastard who broke you down
Torturing the pawn in pure delight
I am the king without his Crown

Every time I lift my head
My hate for you grows more
I was innocent in the eyes of just
No prayers can unbind my hands

I am the one possessed by night
The bastard who broke you down
Torturing the pawn in pure delight 
I am the king without his Crown

I accept the burden for the calling of the brave
I abstain from giving you the power that you crave
Each and every silent day that pass before my eyes
Proof of non-existence and your cold pathetic lies

I release you from my site
Leaving me with this hand of fate
Passing judgement before I was alive
Until my death, I shall see you burn

I am the one possessed by night
The bastard who broke you down
Torturing the pawn in pure delight
I am the king without his Crown

I accept the burden for the calling of the brave
I abstain from giving you the power that you crave
Each and every silent day that pass before my eyes
Proof of non-existence and your cold pathetic lies
