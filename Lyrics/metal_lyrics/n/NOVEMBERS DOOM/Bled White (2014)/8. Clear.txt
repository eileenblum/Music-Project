Sitting in Silence
And the still is more painful than words
I say to you, dream on my dear
And I hope you find what you need there

It's been for you so very long
This time it's for me

I always looked through the eyes of the blind
Into he night where it all dies away
Where dawns sun shows a new path
Now is the time I need to clear

One the day the sun died
With an empty stare, I wasn't cold
All I wanted was belief in you
I don't believe you anymore

It's been for you far so very long
This time it's for me

I always looked into the eyes of the blind
Into the night where it all dies away
Where dawns sun shows a new path
Now is the time I need to clear

What lies in the wake of a life now lost
Would shatter the hear of the pure
This facade we wear like a mask of pride
It only hides the disappointing truth

It's been for you far so very long
This time it's for me

I always looked into the eyes of the blind
Into the night where it all dies away
Where dawns sun shows a new path
Now is the time I need to clear
