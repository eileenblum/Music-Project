Reaching high above the realm of reason
In your absence the heart bleeds dry
I know you share the sickening hurt
The more you love me, the more I die
The years I've waited, the lonely, the foul
I curse the very day the city brought light
Rising hope for the crippled we fear
The heart now severed, I've been bled white

Dreams only go so far, It's never enough for me
The yearning for something more
Forever doesn't seem long enough
When you consider the time now lost

The years I've waited, the lonely, the foul
I curse the very day the city brought light
Rising hope for the crippled we fear
The heart now severed, I've been bled white

Burning for the color in dark
When no one hears the sound of my heart
The absent tries to hollow my soul Bleeding!
I have been bled white!

Sifting through a million words, hunting for yours
The cold distant lost embrace
Longing the hours until we will meet again
Desperate to be saved, I pine in wait

The years I've waited, the lonely, the foul
I curse the very day the city brought light
Rising hope for the crippled we fear
The heart now severed, I've been bled white

Burning for the color in dark
When no one hears the sound of my heart
The absent tries to hollow my soul
Bleeding!
I have been bled white!

If I'm accused of a thousand crimes
And the sun hides from my sight
There is a positive to behold this day...
I don't have to watch you walk away from me

The years I've waited, the lonely, the foul
I curse the very day the city brought light
Rising hope for the crippled we fear
The heart now severed, I've been bled White

Burning for the color in dark
When no one hears the sound of my heart
The absent tries to hollow my soul
Bleeding!
I have been bled white!
