When love is not enough, and darkness clouds the light
A short-lived brilliance, leave us in the pass
Your gift to touch so many, in your absence so many more
Your broken heart has shattered us all

I only hope you found the peace you were searching for
I pray your smile is now pure
With a life full of unrest, clear to see in print of bold
You are missed with broken hearts

Never a regret, with forward sight
The impossible wait fractures the soul
All I want was this not to be
And saying goodbye is all I can do

I only hope you found the peace you were searching for
I pray your smile is now pure
With a life full of unrest, clear to see in print of bold
You are missed with broken hearts

Despite my knowing the logic within
This madness of loss takes control
I can see you had your reason
Cage your soul to calm the unrest

This never ending cycle
Hope brings familiar pain
The vast wealth of knowledge
The same mistakes are made
This circle of life goes around
Delivering the crushing blow
Each time it makes it's pass
Breaking me more each time

Broken hearts battle the ache
What will become of our tormented minds
How can we understand the depth of your being
When we've lost the man that was

I only hope you found the peace you were searching for
I pray your smile is now pure
With a life full of unrest, clear to see in print of bold
You are missed with broken hearts

Despite my knowing the logic within
This madness of loss takes control
I can see you had your reason
Cage your soul to calm the unrest
