I have fashioned a secret room
Within my mind where memories hide
Between you and I, where life thrives
For we own the nights stars

Face to fate, I breathe your breath
I can see your soul through those eyes
And with a smile from your lips
I am happily lost in the memory room

Chasing lost years without a single find
Wishing for more time between our lives
The culmination of all that is grand
And our salvation resonates deep
Within the memory room

In this place we'll hide from light
Under the stars and sharing the night
An autumns breeze or summer heat
We'll plant the seed of tomorrow

You have saved me once again
From the depth of my own misery
To feed my youth and repair my dreams
Born with a fear for dying alone

Chasing lost years without a single find
Wishing for more time between our lives
The culmination of all that is grand
And our salvation resonates deep
Within the memory room

There is no key to open this door
This place is ours to determine its yield
And it is here where I cherish your love
For the smile was all I ever needed

Chasing lost years without a single find
Wishing for more time between our lives
The culmination of all that is grand
And our salvation resonates deep
Within the memory room
