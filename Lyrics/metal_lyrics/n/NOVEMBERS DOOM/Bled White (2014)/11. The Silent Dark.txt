Here in the silent dark
The emptiness reveals my heart
Why are you so ashamed of me?
Living in a secret that no one sees

For all the tears I have cried
Embracing the sins of my past
It's those who surround me
And I see the worst in them all

I struggle with my demons
These are mine to bear
I can see your constant smile
That is, until you look at me

Dying alone where my legacy ends
The trumpet wave through audible air
The final breath that I draw in
Death rattle groan that no one hears
I've done this to myself, I created my own hell
What a fitting place for my end, for my end

I have bled my final drop
No longer can I stop the ache
Bleeding out all the honesty
Leaving an empty shell of doubt

Who is it you seek comfort in?
What is it I cannot provide?
I know of stealth in the cover of dark
That thief in the night was me

Dying alone where my legacy ends
The trumpet wave through audible air
The final breath that I draw in
Death rattle groan that no one hears
I've done this to myself, I created my own hell
What a fitting place for my end, for my end

Fading away at the forefront of pain
This mind is trampled by my very soul
I've done this to myself, I created my own hell
What a fitting place for my end

My last step on this earth
With a desperate look in my eyes
Now is when I need you to believe me
And know this was all for real

So I wait at the shore of failure
And I know it could happen to me
I just may deserve the exact same fate
And my path in life is bending

Here in the silent dark
The emptiness reveals my heart
Why are you so ashamed of me?
Living in a secret that no one sees

My last step on this earth
With a desperate look in my eyes
Now is when I need you to believe me
And know this was all for real

So I wait at the shore of failure
And I know it could happen to me
I just may deserve the exact same fate
And my path in life is bending
