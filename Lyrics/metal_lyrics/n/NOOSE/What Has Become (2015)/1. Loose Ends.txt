You are the worst
Person in existence
They say everyone deserves a second chance
But I don't believe a single word of it

My perception of the world is distorted
From all the lies &amp; pain

You set the flames &amp; now I can't control what's going to happen
I'm a mad man
&amp; my vision [2x]
Is so fucking blurry

I'm seeing white
The only thing I can sense anymore
Is a disgusting presence
&amp; it's tearing me apart

You can go back to your evil ways &amp; I will be there
Four walls surrounding me

Separated from
The rest of the world
Rotting from the inside out
