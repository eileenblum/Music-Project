Sometimes I like to believe
That everything has a meaning
Sometimes I like to believe
That everything is what it seems
His eyes as blue as the ocean
The man in black
He follows behind me

Every time from the corner of my eye [2x]

You see me but you can't see him
What happens past this point is out of my hands?
I lie alone asleep at night
Everyday a step closer to seeing the light
It begins

A start without an end
How are lives made from this
Watching every move we make
Mistake after fucking mistake
His eyes are closed but I feel them on me now

I am releasing the fear in me
We will all die the same
[2x]

My time has come
