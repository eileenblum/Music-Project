The best ways stay alive
Is to stop fighting yourself
Just breathe [2x]

I'm at a point in my life, where I don't care if I die
You can try to change me, but no one really knows who I am inside

Inside my head
Lies a man
Inside my heart
Lies a purpose, to what I've become

I sit &amp; try to believe, but there is something stopping me
I sit &amp; try to breathe, this isn't how I wanted it to be

The best way to stay alive
Is to stop fighting yourself
Just breathe

Before being consumed with pride
I hear them call my name
But I'm not listening
What have I become?

What have I become?
What have I done? [2x]
I don't know what I've become
