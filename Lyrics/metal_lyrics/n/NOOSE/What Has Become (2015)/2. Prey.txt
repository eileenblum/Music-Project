Humanity is in a race for fame
Rabid to the point that we have no shame
It's part of the game we play
We are all the fucking same

To breath is not to live
We take before we give
We all have one thing in mind
To live or fucking die

Society has lost all innocence
It's kill or be killed &amp; we've got nothing left to lose

We are all fucking animals [3x]
Stop the silence &amp; start the violence

I have the gun pointed to my head
I'd rather be the hunter than the hunted

We are part of a dying breed
As if the world will ever listen to me
We are all animals

We are all fucking animals
Animals
