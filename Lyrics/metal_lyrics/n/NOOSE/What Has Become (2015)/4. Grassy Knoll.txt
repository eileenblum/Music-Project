A traitor hiding, in the shell of a man
Waiting for his time to strike
But not yet
Things are just getting started

Heard but not trusted, the words you speak
Slither out of your mouth like a motherfucking snake
People are starting to notice something
Things are changing

All eyes on you
You look around &amp; realize there's nothing you can do now

To the darkness, you will descend
Eternal torture awaits you as you lose consciousness
Awaken in a world much darker, crueler, than you could ever imagine

Now you're just a lost soul waiting to leave purgatory
Waiting forever, you're just a beggar

Beg &amp; plead to get your life back
An empty body slowly fading into nothingness
Just as you feel your breath come back
There's a fucking blade in your chest
You're better off dead
