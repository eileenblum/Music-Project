You say heroes will survive,
But you battalion is outnumbered. Are you blind?
It's time to open up your eyes.
The wolves are howling, yet you stay in line.

Don't lick your wounds before it's over
'Cause I'm letting the phoenix go.

Come and dance, come and dance in the fire.
Let's embrace your destiny.
Come and dance, come and dance in the fire.
Cauterise your wounds, and be a leader to the light.

Come and dance, come and dance in the fire.
Come and dance in the fire tonight.

Relax, the future will unfold.
Just realise your shrapnel's made of gold.
Hey! Does it hurt to lie?
'Cause when you refuse to fight, you choose to die.

Don't lick your wounds, we can start over.
'Cause I'm letting the phoenix go!

Come and dance, come and dance in the fire.
Let's embrace your destiny.
Come and dance, come and dance in the fire.
Cauterise your wounds, and be a leader to the light.

Come and dance, come and dance in the fire.
Come and dance in the fire tonight.

War.
Lost.
Fire.
Dust.

War.
Lost.
Fire.
Dust.

War.
Lost.
Fire.
Dust.

Come and dance, come and dance in the fire.
Let's embrace your destiny.
Come and dance, come and dance in the fire.
Cauterise your wounds, and be a leader to the light.

Come and dance, come and dance in the fire.
Come and dance, come and dance in the fire.
