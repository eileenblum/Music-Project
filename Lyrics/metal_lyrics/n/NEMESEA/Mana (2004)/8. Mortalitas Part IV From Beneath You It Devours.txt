You cannot run, cannot hide
She knows you're there
And fills her veins with your blood

Once you were powerful
and took whatever you wanted
But now she fills her veins with your blood

The magentic centre pulls you close
From beneath you it devours

The fire within is extinguished
while water rinsed your face
The air corrodes your being
so the earth can take your dust
