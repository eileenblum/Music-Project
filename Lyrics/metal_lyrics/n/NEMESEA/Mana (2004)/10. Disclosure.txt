The hearse left five minutes ago
leaving you with me

The flowers spelled out my name
while you passed me

Against my will I'm crying
Although the pain feels more like hate
While holding a hand
I'm looking at the ground

Frailty,
cancer but not as the sign of a zodiac

When you openend the door
I turned my back
Now you're waiting
'till I forgive you

And I won't
