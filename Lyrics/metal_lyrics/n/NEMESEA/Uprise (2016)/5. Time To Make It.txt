You'll can't recall his face at all
He never showed it
Through all those years and all the tears
Left in the cold
And now you're wandering, waiting,
Hopeless, lost 'till he sees you

You must move on, just carry on
Like it is over
Why do you wait, and hesitate
He left you there
And you're still wandering, waiting,
Hopeless, lost 'till he sees you

Don't let him tell you what to do
With your life
And I assure you, promise you
Just don't give up this fight

It's time to take it
Don't let it slip away no
It's time to make it
And break out of these chains
Please embrace yourself and then save yourself

You're torn by lies
It multiplies voices inside you
Stop to believe their violent screams
Please don't give in
And stop the wandering, waiting,
Hopeless, lost, he won't hear you

Don't let him tell you what to do
With your life
And I assure you, promise you
Just don't give up this fight

It's time to take it
Don't let it slip away no
It's time to make it
And break out of these chains
Please embrace yourself and then save yourself oh oh

Can you feel it?
Can you see it?
Can you feel it now?
Hope you see somehow
You can change it!

It's time to take it
Don't let it slip away no
It's time to make it
And break out of these chains
Please embrace yourself
And then save yourself oh oh

Time to take it
Time to make it
Please embrace yourself
And then save yourself oh oh
