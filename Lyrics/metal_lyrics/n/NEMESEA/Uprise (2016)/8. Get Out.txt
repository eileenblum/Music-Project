You preach when you live without sin
There will be freedom in your life
If you want it, want it
Come on and take, take it now
Take, take it

Proclaim your words hold the truth
While you're simply selling lies
If you want it, want it
Come on and take, take it now
Take, take it

Prepare
Beware
No time to hesitates
Evolve
Dissolve
Now it's time to

Hold on and...

Get out, break out all the way
Get out, break out unafraid
Go

You need to bare your own cross
And reign over your own life
If you want it, want it
Come on and take, take it now
Take, take it

Prepare
Beware
No time to hesitates
Evolve
Dissolve
Now it's time to

Hold on and...

Get out, break out all the way
Get out, break out unafraid
Go

I will leave it all behind
I am on my way today
Now I'm making up my mind
This rise will leave today so...

Hold on and...

Get out, break out all the way
Get out, break out unafraid
Go

Get out, break out all the way
Get out, break out today
