It's almost like you've never been here
You felt so lost and left behind
You felt the anger for so many years
But you kept it locked inside

Feel it
Believe it
See it
Believe it

No, it's not too late to change your ways
Got to leave behind those days
Hold on, hold on
No, it's not too late to change your ways
Got to find another place
Hold on, hold on

All those feelings that were taunting
Felt as if they would collide
When the light would slowly fade away
There was no place for you to hide

Feel it
Believe it
See it
Believe it

No, it's not too late to change your ways
Got to leave behind those days
Hold on, hold on
No, it's not too late to change your ways
Got to find another place
Hold on, hold on

Please trust me when I say
We can find another way
And I hope you understand
I am here to hold your hand

No, it's not too late to change your ways
Got to leave behind those days
Hold on, hold on
No, it's not too late to change your ways
Got to find another place
Hold on, hold on

Hold on, hold on now
Hold on
