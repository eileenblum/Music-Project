Resign, recline
Descending into quicksand
Disguise, closed eyes
Carry on as it's falling away from you

Locked up, inside
Don't let them steal it from you
You hide your pride
Hold back, keep breaking and breaking yourself

Hear me, don't you understand?
Hear me, don't you understand?

No fight, hands tied
Control, it's your domain
You'll try this lie
Carry on as it's falling away from you

Rely and thrive
On that what keeps you floating
Deny your light
Hold back, keep breaking and breaking yourself

Hear me, don't you understand?
Hear me, don't you understand?

Hello, hello, hello, hello, hey you
Hello is it you?
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hey you
Hello is this you?

Hello, hello, hello, hello, hey you
Am I getting through?
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hey you
I've got a message for you, you, you

Running running running running around
Falling falling down
Fade in, fade out, got lost without a sound
Is this the way it should be?

Hear me, why don't you understand
And take my hand?
Hear me, why don't you understand?
