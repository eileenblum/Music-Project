When I look into your eyes
And hold your hand
You say that you're alright
But you're not

These old scars don't seem to heal
We'd like to believe
That it'll be all right
But it's not, no it's not

So from now we'll play these songs with open strings
Yes from now we'll play these songs with open strings
May we light up the sky
Let us light up the sky

When the seasons pass us by
With inner cries
We say that it's all good
But it's not, no it's not, no

And now we're breathing with a smile
We know we've lost it for a while
It's time to let go
Let it go go go

'Cause from now we'll play these songs with open strings
Yes from now we'll play these songs with open strings
May we light up the sky
Let us light up the sky

'Cause from now we'll play these songs with open strings
Yes from now we'll play these songs with open strings

May we light up the sky
Let us light up the sky

Lighting up, lighting up, lighting up, lighting up
Lighting up the sky
Lighting up, lighting up, lighting up, lighting up
Lighting up the sky
