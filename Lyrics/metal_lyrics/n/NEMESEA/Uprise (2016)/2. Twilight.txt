You say you care
That you don't want to fight the light
But you just stare
Into the past the darkest night

You gaze around
Afraid to look into the light
And your heart pounds
Into the waking dark the night

Tell me that you're gonna fight to rule the day

The day, the night
Form the twilight inside
The day, the night
The twilight deep inside

You fear the day
You say you cannot stand the light
Afraid to stay
You run away into the night

Tell me that you're gonna fight to rule the day

The day, the night
Form the twilight inside
The day, the night
The twilight deep inside

You say you care
That you don't want to fight the light

The day, the night
Form the twilight inside
The day, the night
The twilight deep inside

The twilight deep inside
