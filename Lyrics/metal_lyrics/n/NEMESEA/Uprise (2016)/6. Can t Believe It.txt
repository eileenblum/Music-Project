I can't believe it
My whole life on hold
No, I won't believe it
I never went for less than gold

I can't believe it
This feels so insane
It so hard to believe it
Everything resonates the pain

And when the darkness floats around me
I want to let it go, let it go
I hope the silence comes and finds me
So I can let it go

I can't relive it
I need some peace of mind
But if I can't forgive it
Insanity leaves me numb and blind

And when the darkness floats around me
I want to let it go, let it go
I hope the silence comes and finds me
So I can let it go
And when the sadness overwhelms me
I need to let it go, let it go
I hope the silence comes and finds me
So I'll keep breathing in, breathing out

I can't believe it
I'll my lifeline go
I won't believe it
Show me what I need to know

I can't erase it
It's always been my guide
But I have to face it
I need to end this fight

And when the darkness floats around me
I want to let it go, let it go
I hope the silence comes and finds me
So I can let it go
And when the sadness overwhelms me
I need to let it go, let it go
I hope the silence comes and finds me
So I'll keep breathing in, breathing out
