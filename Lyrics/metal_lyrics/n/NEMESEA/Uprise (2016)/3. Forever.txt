Why'd you try it?
It's fight or flight response to all your pain
While you knew it was in vain
Forever
Don't deny it
Just make us understand what happened here
And what made you disappear
Forever

You hide away
Feeling lowly and misplaced
It's written all over your face
Forever
Inside you stay
You're waiting for the walls to break
To feel alive and wide awake

Come chase me
Into the light
I believe in all you are
Forever!
Come chase me
Into the light
âCause I believe in all you are
Forever!

Try to fight it
You're stuck in memories
They haunt your soul
Leave those savage thoughts to rove
Forever!

Inside you stay
Waiting for the walls to break
To feel alive and wide awake

Come chase me
Into the light
I believe in all you are
Forever!
Come chase me
Into the light
âCause I believe in all you are
Forever!

Don't deny it
You're stuck in memories
Try to fight it
Fight it all!

I believe in all you are
Forever!

Come chase me
Into the light
âCause I believe in all you are
Forever!
