Waking up in Paris on my own
How did I end up here?
Where do I go from here?
I'm taking every step along the way
I've got to let it burn
Just got to let it burn

Making up my mind as I await
The thoughts to lead the way
There's a pride I need to pay
Building from the ashes of the past
I had to let it burn
Just had to let it burn

This burning fire
Takes me higher

Every end has a start
You'll create, you'll ache and tear apart
When you first let it burn, just let it burn
Every line in the sand
Every time you to take a stand
Shows you how it burns, just let it burn

Taking up this chance to feel okay
I want to start again
Not sure where to begin
But I'm breaking every link that made me stay
I've got to let it burn
Just got to let it burn

This burning fire
Takes me higher

Every end has a start
You'll create, you'll ache and tear apart
When you first let it burn, just let it burn
Every line in the sand
Every time you to take a stand
Shows you how it burns, just let it burn

Let it burn
Burn brighter, aim higher

Every end has a start
You'll create, you'll ache and tear apart
When you first let it burn, just let it burn
Every line in the sand
Every time you to take a stand
Shows you how it burns, just let it burn

Every end has a start
You'll create, you'll ache and tear apart
Just let it burn, let it burn

Building from the ashes of the past
I had to let it burn
Just had to let it burn
