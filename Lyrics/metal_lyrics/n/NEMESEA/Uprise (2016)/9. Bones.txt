Hunger is picking her bones
Like greedy vultures
Her skin feels so tight
It hurt, like her posture

There's only one faith in her life;
The suffering hunger
Knowing it's easy to hide
She's fading out

Inside, inside

Come on and breathe in all the air
Don't let the demon get your share
Holding on to life, feeding off your strife
Don't let go
You keep on breathing in the air

Feed the guilt in her church
She'll slowly end it
Fighting the urge
Defying her limits

Shadows all hide in the sun
She'll always fake it
Waiting for daylight to run
The craving starts

Inside, inside

Come on and breathe in all the air
Don't let the demon get your share
Holding on to life, feeding off your strife
Don't let go
You keep on breathing in the air

Breathe in all the air

Inside, inside, inside, inside

Come on and breathe in all the air
Don't let the demon get your share
Holding on to life, feeding off your strife
Don't let go
You keep on breathing in the air
