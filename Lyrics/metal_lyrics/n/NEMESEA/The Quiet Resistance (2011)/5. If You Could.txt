Sadness fills up my empty heart
But you are the one that stole my tears
Safe in your arms I found my peace
Oh and Iâm so alone with all my fears now

Not crying
Lying
To find my way through

If you could see me
If you could hold me
For one last time Iâd be okay
But you just left me
You took your chance and slipped away
(You softly slipped away)

I try to find it in my heart
Something to slowly carry on

And Iâm still crying
Lying
I canât seem to find my way

If you could see me
If you could hold me
For one last time Iâd be okay
But you just left me
You took your chance and slipped away

And I know you are gone
But itâs so damn hard for me
Though I know you are gone
You are always on my mind

See me, hold me
I promise I will be okay
If you could hear me
Would you answer me today?

If you could, if you could see me
If you could hold me
For one last time Iâd be okay
But you just left me
You took your chance and slipped away

If I could only get the chance to tell you
Iâm growing stronger everyday
If you could hear me
Iâd try to tell you in a way
One day Iâll be okay
