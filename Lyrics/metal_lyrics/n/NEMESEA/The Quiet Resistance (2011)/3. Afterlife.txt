Donât shut your eyes to me
I want to make you see
Our destiny, how itâs supposed to be
And let the darkness fade
Find comfort in my shade
âCos youâre not alone, no youâre not alone

Can we see, can we feel when weâre in the afterlife
Do you know, how I know to believe in you
Because I do
Can we hope, can we love, can it be our destiny
âCos Iâm listening
Yes Iâm listening
To you

Now donât you close your eyes
Stop telling me your lies
Donât live in fear, âcos I wonât disappear no
I hope you understand
Iâll lend a helping hand
So come to me, âcos I will set you free

Break the silence
Fill this emptiness
And hope for better days

Can we see, can we feel when weâre in the afterlife
Do you know, how I know to believe in you
Because I do
Can we hope, can we love, can it be our destiny
âCos I am listening
Yes I am listening
To you

Donât break me now
Donât tell me that it ends
Let us find another way to make amends
Donât hate me now
Donât turn the other way
âCos thereâs so much left for both of us to say
