Drifting off, about to rush
Nothing straight here anymore
I am falling, flying high
Nothingâs larger than the sky, high

Away
I am loosing sense of time
Delay
In a world where nothingâs mine
Today
Everything thatâs wrong is right
Iâve gone astray
But I will hold on tight

Mindsetâs changing, visionâs blurred
Wicked spirits pouring down
Another fix, a triple dose
Makes it warm beneath my nose

Away
I am loosing sense of time
Delay
In a world where nothingâs mine
Today
Everything thatâs wrong is right
Iâve gone astray
But I will hold on tight

Today, Iâve gone astray
In this rush thereâs no delay

Away
I am loosing sense of time
Delay
In a world where nothingâs mine
Today
Everything thatâs wrong is right
Iâve gone astray
Iâll float towards the light
