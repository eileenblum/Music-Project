Boiling panic
Iâm alone, caught in the middle
Raving envy
It is all I have
Anxious moments
Iâm feeling lost, caught in the middle
Yearning, longing
âCos it is all I want

Brutal power
It keeps me locked, caught in the middle
Raging danger
And I have lost control
Dying, Iâm craving
Iâm still alone, caught in the middle
Killing passions
And I have nothing left

I want to know what it takes to find
Some peace of mind
There where I want to be
Yes I know, nothing comes for free
Just let me see
What is right for me

Burning poison
Here I am, caught in the middle
Chocking venom
Is taking all I have
Blackened visions
They keep me trapped, caught in the middle
Missing pieces
I donât know where to go

I want to know what it takes to find
Some peace of mind
There where I want to be
Yes I know, nothing comes for free
Just let me see
What is right for me

Whatâs it like to be the best
What does it take to make it last
Many doubts have crossed my mind, but I know I have to try
Whatâs the point in giving up
When you know youâll never stop anyway

Now I know what it takes to find
My peace of mind
Itâs right here in front of me
Yes I know strength will be my key
It comes for free
It is right for me
