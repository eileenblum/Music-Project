If I could tell you
That youâre the only one to blame
It doesnât matter âcos you wouldnât change
âCos you donât listen
And you donât even feel ashamed
So I donât feel the need to point your way

One day youâll see itâs not meant to be

Whenever youâre sorry you just make up a story
âCos you canât admit that you were wrong
Whenever youâre sorry you just make up a story
And I saw it coming all along

And you keep saying
That you donât want to live like this
But then you go on like you always do
And when I listen to all the foolish things you say
I just feel the need to walk away

One day youâll see itâs not meant to be

Whenever youâre sorry you just make up a story
âCos you canât admit that you were wrong
Whenever youâre sorry you just make up a story
And I saw it coming all along

So many years I have been blind
Whenever, wherever
Iâve let you break this heart of mine
And now I have to draw the line
