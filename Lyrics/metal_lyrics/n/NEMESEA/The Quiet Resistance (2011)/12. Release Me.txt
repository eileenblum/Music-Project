Tunnel vision, bodyâs freezing
Anxious moments, donât stop breathing
Uninvited black intrusions
Taking over all confusion
Boiling panic growing stronger
I am falling, common pitfalls
Drifting off and I keep sinking
Going crazy, who will save me?

Wake me up
And let the light take over
Let it stop
Iâm losing sense of time so
Wake me up
Please kill this everlasting
Insane rock
I am about to scream

Release me
Relieve me
Release me

Drawing lines but they keep moving
Flashing image, growing darkness
Eyes wide shut, the urge to run
When all is lost and all is gone

Wake me up
And let the light take over
Let is stop
Iâm losing sense of time so
Wake me up
Please kill this everlasting
Insane rock
I am about to scream

Release me
Relieve me
Release me
