It makes no sense
The way you talk
How far youâve come âtill now
Sure of your lines
How to decline
Itâs obvious youâve lost

Donât tell me youâre not aware
Donât say Iâm not aware
Donât you say Iâm not aware
Donât tell me youâre not aware
Donât say Iâm not aware no

Say it like it is
Say it like you mean it
Words are strong enough to say you care
Say it like it is
Say it like you mean it
Words are strong enough to make you swear

When all is gone
And all is lost
How can you still stand strong
Sure of your lines
You still believe
Itâs obvious youâre lost

Donât tell me youâre not aware
Donât say Iâm not aware
Donât you say Iâm not aware
Donât tell me Iâm not aware
Donât say Iâm not aware no

Say it like it is
Say it like you mean it
Words are strong enough to say you care
Say it like it is
Say it like you mean it
Words are strong enough to make you swear
