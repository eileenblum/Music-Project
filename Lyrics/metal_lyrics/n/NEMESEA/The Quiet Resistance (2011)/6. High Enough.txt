Bring me back
To the times I canât remember
Iâm holding on
To that feeling we have lost

I need to breathe
âCose these spaces are too narrow
Iâve lost control
Over frame and state of mind

Donât you know it seems like forever you belonged
To me, to me
Together forever
Was a promise that you let me make

Can you take me high enough?
Wonât you bring me down?
I will never know what you really show
Let me go
âCos you canât take me high enough

Youâre free from me
Is it what you always hoped for?
And do you know
That youâll leave it all behind

Iâm so confused
I thought what we had was special
But all is gone
And you knew it all along

It seems like forever I belonged
To you, to you
Together for always
Was a promise you left here to break

Can you take me high enough?
Wonât you bring me down?
I will never know what you really show
Let me go
âCos you canât take me high enough

I never told you nothing
No promises were made
And I donât owe you anything at all
You meant nothing to me
Now stop and let it go
Both of you couldnât take me high enough

You canât take me high enough
You wonât bring me down
I will always know you will not let go
We both know
That we can take it high enough
