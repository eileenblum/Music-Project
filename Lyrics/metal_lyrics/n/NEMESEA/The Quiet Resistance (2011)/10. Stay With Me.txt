Donât you understand?
Didnât you just listen to me?
I will never find
All that I came here for
Itâs time to understand
Itâs time to recognize the pitfall
Need to change my ways
Directions Iâm going in

Breathe with me
Come fill me, hold me, take my hand and stay with me
Honestly
I cannot carry on if you wonât stay with me, no

I sacrificed it all
Even all my great potential
Pushed through every door
Iâve lost all my will to try
Now I understand
I will never never make it
If I donât believe
This dream will come true for me

Breathe with me
Come fill me, hold me, take my hand and stay with me
Honestly
I cannot carry on if you wonât stay with me, no

These boundaries we will overcome
All this time we fought so hard and now
Weâll make it and I wonât let go
So I just need you to

Breathe with me
Come fill me, hold me, take my hand and stay with me

Agony
Wonât fill me, hold me, take my hand and stay with me
Honestly
I cannot carry on if you wonât stay with me
