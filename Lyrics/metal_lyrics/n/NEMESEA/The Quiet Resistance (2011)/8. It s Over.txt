I am waiting
Iâm suffocating
I canât breathe
The pain stays too long
Yet I linger
And point my finger 
The hard way
The urge to run is strong

Every time I close my eyes
Every time I try to hide
The panic builds up inside
All the things I left behind
Are taking over my own mind
I know itâs over now

Sometimes I cannot remember
I played with open cards
I tried so hard to surrender
Itâs a shame

How come we cannot erase all the pain
Why arenât we strong enough to overcome
Undone, itâs driving me mad and insane
Is there some other place where we belong?

And now Iâm hating
And Iâm creating
This nightmare
That goes on too long
Hanging on to
To what is untrue
I canât leave
The need to stay is strong

Every time I close my eyes
Every time I try to hide
The panic builds up inside
All the things I left behind
Are taking over my own mind
I know itâs over now

Sometimes I cannot remember
I played with open cards
I tried so hard to surrender
Itâs a shame

How come we cannot erase all the pain
Why arenât we strong enough to overcome
Undone, itâs driving me mad and insane
Is there some other place where we belong?

Itâs taking over me
I am too blind to see no oh
Iâm on the edge about to take my final jump

Iâm not in charge at all
The shadeâs too dark for me oh oh
Iâve crossed the border Iâm about to fall
