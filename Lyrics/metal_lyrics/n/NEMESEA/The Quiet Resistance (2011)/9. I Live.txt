You and me
A guarantee
All I know
And all I long for
You look at me
And let me see
All I need
And all I long for

Stay with me
Open your eyes
And let me save you
Trust in me
I wonât let go

âCos Iâd give my life for you
And Iâd die right here for you
You are the one
Weâre one and the same
You are my life
Just call out my name
And Iâll lead you through this open door

Here we are
No not so far
From where we left
From where we started
Take your time
And donât let go
Youâll know for sure
That Iâll be with you

Stay with me
Open your eyes
And let me save you
Trust in me
I wonât let go

âCos Iâd give my life for you
And Iâd die right here for you
You are the one
Weâre one and the same
You are my life
Just call out my name
And Iâll lead you through this open door

The bridges that weâve build are strong enough
The way we live, connect as one
And when I look into your eyes Iâm free
Itâs all I know, itâs all I need
