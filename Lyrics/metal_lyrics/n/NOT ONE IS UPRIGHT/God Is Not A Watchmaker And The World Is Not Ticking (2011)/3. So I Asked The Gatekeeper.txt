Love in the guise of empty purity
Writhing in their graves
Grief has set the stage
Love in the guise of empty purity
This is the end of the hunt
The jackalâs on his way
Donât return his gaze
These are the final days
Grief has set the stage
Fight back, fight back
No more time for this
Donât look, donât look
These are final days
Fight back, fight back
Writhing in their graves
I am sick of this
Empty purity
No more time for this
Donât keep silent! We are writhing in our misgivings. Grief has set the stage. Our every breath is vain. Donât keep silent, Oh God, donât keep silent!
Because if you keep silent, I have no reason left to speak.
