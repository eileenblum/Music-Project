We were born for constant joy
Step into it at any moment
For there is grace for all people
I want to see this place on fire
A million hearts burning as one
Exalt the Spirit
Praise His name alone
We are all united under one banner of hope and love
And I am convinced that neither death nor life, angels nor demons, the present nor the future, nor any powers. Neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus, our Lord.
All of You is pure
And all you take unto You
Oh Father, restore the bride youâve lost
And take away the shame
This is the kingdom!
There is a light!
