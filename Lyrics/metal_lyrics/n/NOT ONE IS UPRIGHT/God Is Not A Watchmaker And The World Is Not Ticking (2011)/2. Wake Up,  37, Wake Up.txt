You bolt the door
And swallow the key
Thatâs right, say you canât believe
Thereâs no need-when youâre freed-will to be
This is art.
Cannot see-canât perceive-cannot be
The coming of the end
Wince:
Strain to see-in this void-weâre losing it
Is the art of man
Wrench these words from my jaws, drain, dehydrate
Because these words are fallible imperfect vessels tossing in a sea of thought
I canât tell you the truth but I can tell you where it is.
Dilettante
Settle or panic,
Passion blurs your vision
Midst your stride,
Risk it
You start to fade
Drop anchors. I can show you where it is.
Drop anchors.
Unrefined, my paradigm
Function, form, and fashion:
I know that what I am saying is raw, but witness the turning wheels of this global economy, grinding up man into ever smaller pieces. I see blank eyes and restless drawls responding to the emerging crisis of modern life, ringing emotions out. Donât invent inside what is out. Reason knows perfection as thirst knows water. If youâre thirsty, then believe and satisfy your thirst. Drink from this cup. Come on bended knee. Donât let passion brand your battle, itâll only wear you out. Drink at the cross of redemption.
