Reproach with back against the wall
Violate the bride
Placed under the spotlight
Exposed to degrading things
Come thief, make your sway
Forced to bud before their time
Displayed in pomp before their lusting eyes
Through no fault of their own
Father, husband, son
Cling to her waist
Her beauty emanates in brevity
Tonight the petals begin to fade
Exposed in their shame
Thrown out, left to decay
Through no fault of their own
Abandoned by those who made them into what they are
