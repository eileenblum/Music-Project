Words ignite silent stirs in men
Repress
Keep them locked away
Deflate humanity from the man
As she travels a vacuum trails behind
The name of Christ is on the crutches of these columns strewn across the land
You are subject to his grace
Where else do you find life but in breath?
This capsule has carried us long enough
Obsolete
Fire rages behind the barrier. What point is a fire if we canât feel its warmth? While the trembling disenfranchised receive the lukewarm ashes, intangible, coals of fear and not of love glow, with the backlight of restless resentment. Division. division and dominance. But brothers and sisters, the curtain is torn, the dead have buried their own, the King is come. The King has come. The King has come.
