Flies swarming around stick thin body and gaunt face, his skin looks as if it has been tightly fitted over his bones.
Scabs are on most of his joints, as if he is starting to stretch at the seams, in tattered rags stained brown from the sooty streets, bulging belly of gas. Thatâs only the start, thatâs not even the worst.

The home has been perverted; divorce has desecrated the marriage bed. Pornography, exploitation of women, plastic surgery, abortions for convenience sake. Our sons have lost dignity and pride. What did you think was going to happen?
The object has never been to point the finger or place the blame. But the truth of the matter is that we as a people, as a nation, and as a world, are completely broken.
