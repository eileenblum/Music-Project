Detach from your beds, or at least keep a loose grip, because your hopes depend on crooked, greedy men. Donât stitch your skin to skin. With thousands and thousands of faces. The sharpest of fangs can only penetrate your skin. Hereâs to the armory, hereâs to the blacksmith. With each step I feel the ground grow a little weaker. Question after question, I am learning how to lead. Failure after failure after failure after failure. With each step, farewell.
