My heart corrupts my words. Without a thought I spill my heart to you. Besiege.
Without sight I beg for color, with no voice. I don't want my voice. I wonât promise you freedom.
Direct your eyes to the One that has conquered all. He has conquered all. Locked in, bled out.
I wonât promise you freedom. Take my misery, but only for a little bit. I tried but trying isn't good enough. Take this from me right now. God, I need your help. I wonât wager my sin on my Fatherâs love.
