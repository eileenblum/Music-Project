A broken mirror still knows your face. In mere fragments we make our moves, under cover of dimmed light. This is not His love, not His love. Not when we only know our reflections and live and die by the gun. Beneath flesh and bone thereâs a body perfected. How obsolete then is it to be chained to this earth by your fetters of fashion and rot. Charm is deceptive. We bought deception.
I can see it dancing away (I can hear it carry a tune). I can feel it melting away (I can feel it making a groove). I can taste it bleeding away, I knew just what it could do but I welcomed it anyway and now I'm dancing away, too. Step by step, we're dancing away. Breath by breath, we carry this tune.
Inch by inch, we're melting away. Hand in hand, we bury the truth. Beauty is a fleeting thing.
