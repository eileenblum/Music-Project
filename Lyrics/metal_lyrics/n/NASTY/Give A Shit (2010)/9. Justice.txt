Wanna fight for justice, this is what you get!

Fucked up trouble with corrupt society!

Your mind gets fucked, you feel the pain!

You fought for the sun but you became black rain!

Who has the spirit to stand up for justice?!

Justice!

A few places in the sky,
billions in the dust,
watching from our tower to the ones on the crust!

Come on take the first stone!

Set the fire!
