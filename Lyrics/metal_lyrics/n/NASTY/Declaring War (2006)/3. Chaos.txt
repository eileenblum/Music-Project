This is chaos motherfuckers
No one can escape this world,
Gets more than it can take
We shouldnÂ´t fuck our mother,
Fuck and rape what is done is done
Is done you canÂ´t rewind it like a tape
ItÂ´s getting ugly like Freddy
Mad like your dad after caviar orgy in your
Parents bed incoming attacks,
Earth wind and fire nature calls to arms
Cause it donÂ´t wants us any longer
(we should) better get a fuck it could be our last
Soon human kind is fucking part of the past.
