An oppressed culture on the rise
This rising army, opressers demise the time is now,
Time to go time for war,
Declare it now!
Lets wreck those buttheads lets show them
Who we are no longer will they handicap our movement
BURN BABYLON DOWN!
With music as our weapon munition in form of words
Striking from the underground
Fighting guerrilla warfare
This is guerrilla warfare pressure from the underground
This is for real guerilla warfare fighting, guerilla warfare
No longer weÂ´ll fightless acccept you threatening us bad high from your thrones n' stuff
We will angry gonna fight you like a mob
We'll fight and like kings weÂ´ll rise above.
