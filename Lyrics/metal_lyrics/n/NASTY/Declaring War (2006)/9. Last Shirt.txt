Its smell surrounds us like the air we daily breathe
It holds us captive nearly no one can break free
Root of all evil BC. Told and we agree living to earn it
Thats life fucking reality
Seduction of mankind total control the root has grown to a jungle do or die
Like hungry wolves they kill for it like blameful kids they lie for it and blinded by greed formed to aherd of sheep they even die for it killed by the wolves hungry for more
Get it on dudes sell your own mother for more
Regardless of the consequence you would do anything to upper your score
But remember you fool it comes the day you've got to drop it
Cause your last shirt has got no pockets
