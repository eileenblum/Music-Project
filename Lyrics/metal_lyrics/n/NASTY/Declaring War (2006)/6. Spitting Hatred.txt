They are taking all we've build choking our resistance
Is it a sin not to give in to those bastards pressure
We won't bow down to this plastic culture
Shit on an everything accepting disco generation lead through famous fashion fucks
This song spits hatred to humans upperclass
Swimming in money while others drown in dirt try to stop us and you'll drown in our cum motherfuckers!
This is our heartbeat never gonna give in
This is our heartbeat even if we can't win
A breed born in this war to fuck your life
We won't give in we won't bow down won't be a part of this plastic generation
You can see flames instead of nothing in open eyes when it starts
Resistance
Fuel for the fire in our hearts
