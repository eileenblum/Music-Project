You don't I do
you won't I will
you don't I do

believe in myself

you often tried to push me yet
having no clue where my limits are at
I won't let down
you are no threat
before you break me I will rather be dead

you don't I do
you won't I will
you don't I do

believe in myself

you often tried to push me yet
having no clue where my limits are at
I won't let down
you are no threat
before you break me I will rather be dead

I've got the power
