we're all the same, equal in this place
no matter the gender, the look, the race
together for some better
instead of sorrow a smile on the face

got love for each other cause this world got none
simply one for all, strictly all for one
open minded for visions of change
no longer willing in playing their games
standing straight for what we feel
so much is fake but this is real

we are all the same
against the grain, against the grain
you're falling down we'll catch you
won't let this world forget you
when all is gone this love remains

we're all the same, equal in this place
no matter the gender, the look, the race
together for some better
instead of sorrow a smile on the face

got love for each other cause this world got none
simply one for all, strictly all for one

real love

standing straight for what we feel
so much is fake but this is real

we are all the same
against the grain, against the grain
you're falling down we'll catch you
won't let this world forget you
when all is gone this love remains
