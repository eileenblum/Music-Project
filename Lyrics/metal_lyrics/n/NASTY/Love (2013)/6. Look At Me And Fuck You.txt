I have nightmares lying in my bed
you're acting tough like a skin result is Right Said Fred
oh bombs on your head you're really better off dead
looks like you just lost focus on the things we once had
we were together at war, spitting mean shit on the battlefield
now split up, split up, fighting as enemys

you can't face your own talk
look at me and fuck you

bring it, get shit done
we'll break it and get shit down

never ever believe in your words again
never ever trust in what you just said

nuff said
bombs on your head
look at me and fuck you
