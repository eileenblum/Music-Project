dig deeper, deeper, to find the buried corps
raped, pregnant, deadborn
life fueled out, scared forever

bloodsoaked streets, civil death
hell on earth when god's in rage

so you start praying through all this bloodshed
so motherfucker tell me where are your gods at
fuck that, you're sending fire just in gods sake
bellybullets hitting tell me where are your guts at!?

start your prayers!

fighting for your heaven, putting hell on earth
