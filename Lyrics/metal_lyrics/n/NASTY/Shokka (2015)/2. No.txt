Just tell me,
Say it to my face!

I know you're something better,
and I am a disgrace!

Point your dirty finger,
behind my back.

Believe me you cunt,
I don't want your respect!

No, I wont cause I simply don't follow your lead, motherfucker!
No, I wont!
No! I wont!

Point your dirty finger,
behind my back.

Believe me you cunt,
I don't want your respect!

Just tell me,
Say it to my face!

I know you're something better,
and I am a disgrace!

No, I wont! I may not fit, cause I don't fit into shit.
I am on a whole other level, on a whole different trip.

No! No!

I am on a whole other level, on a whole different trip!
