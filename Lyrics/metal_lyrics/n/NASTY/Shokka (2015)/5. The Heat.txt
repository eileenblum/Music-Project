Last chance to get real can you listen how the clock ticks?
Tick, tick times up fools like you can suck it!
You may sit high but those flames burn higher.
Your throne it's gonna burn because we set it on fire!

You can't hold down, what's destinated to rise.
Walk the walk, and we won't tell you twice.
This is ours and if you cross our way,
you gonna get hard times gonna make you pay.

You may sit high but those flames burn higher.
Your throne it' s gonna burn because we set it on fire!
Last chance to get real can you listen how the clock ticks?
Tick, tick times up fools like you can suck it!

Nuff talk, walk the walk, nuff talk.
Listen up!
A lesson for you, motherfucker!
Keep calm!
And burn, burn, burn!
