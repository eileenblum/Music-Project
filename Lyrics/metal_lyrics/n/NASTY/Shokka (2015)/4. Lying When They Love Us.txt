On my knees pleasing to never know whats on the move.
To deny the truth!
Killing with a smile! Cruel hands above us!
Killing with a smile! Lying when they love us.
Where is a hero when you need him most !?
Where's my protection from their words what is best for me.
I lost senses for my self defense.
If I don't work replacement's on the bench.
I am even less worth then expected, a simple joke for those who rule,
It is supposed to be wonderful, but it is simply cruel.
Killing with a smile! Cruel hands above us!
Killing with a smile! Lying when they love us.
Where is a hero when you need him most !?
Where's my protection from their words what is best for me.
I lost senses for my self defense.
If I don't work replacement's on the bench.
More input more meds!
More reasons to live life without regrets!
To at least have moments left!
Before it chokes my breath!
