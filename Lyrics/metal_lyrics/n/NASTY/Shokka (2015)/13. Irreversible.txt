Do you remember when you met me, when we crossed our ways.
Remember how life felt then, back in those days.
Innocent even a lil afraid,
But that innocence, it was doomed to fade.
Like the first high, you always gonna chase it,
no matter the beauty, one day you gonna break it.
no matter the beauty, one day you gonna break it.

Dreams, wishes we were full of them. A touch, kisses,
made me feel like a man. We swore eternal love,
we couldn't get enough. Neverending nights, over and above..

They say time heals everything, no folks I don't agree.
Also time will tell, but this works not on me.
Cause in the end it kills it all, like on a killing spree.
This world changes, yes and so do we, one day I understood our love was history.

Like the first high, you always gonna chase it, no matter the beauty, one day you gonna break it.

Dreams, wishes we were full of them. A touch, kisses,
made me feel like a man. We swore eternal love,
we couldn't get enough. Neverending nights, over and above...
