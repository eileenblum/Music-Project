Promising better
All gonna be good
Change is gonna come
Problems will be solved
Youâre face on the wall smiling like a friend
And people are surprised you fooled em all again

Yes we know you said that. Liar!
So we put it to the test. Trier!
Your promises not kept. Liar!
Our answer to your lies. Fire!

Money talks and you talk to get it
Increasing your wages as soon as youâre elected
How can you chow down a feast cooked by hungry hands?
Talk about equality while you are more equal than anybody else?

Yes we know you said that. Liar!
So we put it to the test. Trier!
Your promises not kept. Liar!
Our answer to your lies. Fire!

This is going to be final
Gas to the bottle
Fire to the torch
Your structures to ashes
Lies they gonna scorch

Liar! Burning your disguise
Fire! Our answer to your lies
