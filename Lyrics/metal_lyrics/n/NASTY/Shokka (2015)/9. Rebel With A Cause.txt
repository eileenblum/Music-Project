There are 1000 plus one reasons!
In this fairytale you call freedom!

I do not believe! And I do not applause!
I turn my back and leave cause I am a rebel with a cause!

And yes I gonna cause trouble, if you don't leave me alone!
And I will stand up, when you push me down!

Break those chains if you put me in handcuffs.
Speak out loud when you want me to shut up.

Rebel with a cause!

There are 1000 plus one reasons!
In this fairytale you call freedom!
I do not believe! And I do not applause!
I turn my back and leave cause I am a rebel with a cause!

And yes I gonna cause trouble.

And I scream!
And I fight!
No rest,
until the the day I die!
