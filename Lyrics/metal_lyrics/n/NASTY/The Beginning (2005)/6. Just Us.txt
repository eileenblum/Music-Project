It's just us!
Pissed boys and girls on a mission to party,
It's just us!
Drinking or X ing, meateating or vegan,
We don't care cause,
It's just us!
Kickboxing and moshing,
Or just looking and rocking,
It's just us!
Ugly or beauty, thin or fat,
We don't care cause at least we're all the same!

Break your ego, let's go!
Free the way to your heart!
Take your friends hands tight!
Cause it's just us!
