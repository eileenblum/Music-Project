World in panic, the first victim falls
Mass confusion, bloody stories told
The sounds then the colors, then blood starts to spay
As you feel your insides being eaten away

Glowing with florescence
Insectile demons fly
Tunneling though your flesh
No hope to survive

A meteor from deep space
Exploding through the atmosphere
Sending micro-insect death
Upon the world, just like a plague
Leaving colored trails behind
A whining sound from beating wings
Delivering instant agony
A living bullet enters your skin
The pain travels quickly
Never in a straight line
Chewing a crooked path
Devouring your innards

Tunnel through your...
Tunnel through your flesh!

Missing vital organs
Leaving you a wreck
Partially hollowed body
About to fall apart
Instant digestion
Their feeding never stops

Ferocious tiny creatures
Stripping bones and flesh
Numbered at 10,000
Or have they already bred?
Tiny razors in their faces
Make powder of your bones
Leaving us their mangled prey
To die a drawn-out death

The world seems to glow with a multicolored haze
Eardrums bursting as billions now attack
Defenseless we are eaten, world population shrinks
The planet now consumed, itâs time for suicide

Tunnel through your...
Tunnel through your flesh!

Tunnel through your...
Tunnel through your flesh!
