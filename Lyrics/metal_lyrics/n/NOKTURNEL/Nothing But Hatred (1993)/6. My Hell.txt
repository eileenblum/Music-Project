Falling through dimensions doors, through an evil space of time
I try and get a grip on things but itâs too fucked for my mind
Lords of chaos, hoards of demons craving human blood and souls
Iâm their prey, their hunted target, my future now starts to unfold

Doing drugs, intoxication, mangling people just for fun
I have to kill to stay alive, desecration has begun
This must be a purgatory for a life full of sin
Infected cuts all full of pain, when will the next attack begin?

This is my hell but it is the place for me
Thereâs plenty of pain and a lot of misery
Iâll be fine as long as they bleed
âCause nothing here dies and we all have to feed

Amputation of my limbs and the effects of radiation
My eyes drip blood, theyâre slowly burning, I only see a silhouette
This must be a purgatory for a life full of sin
Infected cuts all full of pain, when will the next attack begin?

This is my hell but it is the place for me
Thereâs plenty of pain and a lot of misery
Iâll be fine as long as they bleed
âCause nothing here dies and we all have to feed

My hell!
