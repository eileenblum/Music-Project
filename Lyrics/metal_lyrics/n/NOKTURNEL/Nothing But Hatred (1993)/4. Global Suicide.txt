Time eroding the surface of the earth
Consuming process increasing its speed
Ignorant humanity, not thinking of the future
Atmospheric disaster is taking its course

Seasons switching climates, fucking natureâs balance
Caustic rain burns away our grim future
Aerosol chewing hole in the ozone layer
Industrial waste, smog pumped down your throat

Burning!
Ultraviolet rays searing death
Burning!
Crusted skin from contact with the sun
Burning!
All life will cripple, lie down and die
Burning!
Global suicide!

Burned out planet running out of its resources
Natural disaster showing us no remorse
California is about to drift away
Million dollar corporations destroying the earth

The surface of the earth reduced to ash
âCause of corporate scums quest for cash
Buy our product itâs not so bad
And we listen what the fuck!

Like I should talk I buy them too
Alternative products for us to change
Whatâs one more spray can gonna do
Times one billion this equals doom!

Problems the whole worlds away
Seems like no one fucking cares
Fucks with my head to fucking think
I might get to see the world die

Planet in flames, all lives dying
Evaporation of our waters
Death comes with every rising sun

Abused planet dying quicker
Forget about a fucking future
Revolution is whatâs needed
Boycott of destructive products

Pollutants waste away our atmosphere
How will we breathe when there is no more air?
No one will care to be alive
When our planet turns into burning hell
