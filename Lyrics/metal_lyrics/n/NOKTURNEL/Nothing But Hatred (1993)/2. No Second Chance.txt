Runaway and fear itâs you I want to kill
You went too far itâs your time to die now
Had to push your luck, dickhead attitude
Without your friends here now youâre nothing

Thinking of your pain with a smile on my face
Knowing to myself it was worth a long wait
Almost in my grasp, gonna break your bones
Your talk was cheap, now fill my wrath

Got away with it once itâs my turn
No second chance!
You shouldnât talk shit if you donât expect the violence
No second chance!
You apology is no accepted
No second chance!
This is more fun than I expected
No second chance!

Splitting teeth, bloody nose
Looked diseased, smashed his toes
Sliced him up, poker in his eyes
Ripped his ears, he almost dies
Broke his ribs, pissed on him
Shit himself, I had to grin
Broke his arm, broke his legs
Took his wallet, smashed his head

Hypocrites with their comments
What really do they know?

Let this be an example
Of how my anger grows

Laughing at your lifeless corpse
Knowing not a soul would care
Iâd do it again if I had the chance
Tear you limb from limb
Laughing at your lifeless corpse
Knowing not a soul would care
Iâd do it again if I had the chance
Tear you limb from limb

Got away with it once itâs my turn
No second chance!
You shouldnât talk shit if you donât expect the violence
No second chance!
You apology is no accepted
No second chance!
This is more fun than I expected
No second chance!
