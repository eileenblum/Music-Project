Paranoia stirs my mind, but nothingâs even happening
I turn around and no oneâs there Iâm wondering if Iâm insane
Spirits taunt my mind and I feel my body changing
I sure itâs an evil presence and it stalks me for my soul

Theyâre in control
Torment my mind
They have my soul
Poltergeist

Apparitions, souls from hell
Have my mind, theyâre in control
No escaping invisible forces
Their deafening laugh makes me cringe
Thoughts of ending my life are here

Paranoia stirs my mind, but nothingâs even happening
I turn around and no oneâs there Iâm wondering if Iâm insane
Spirits taunt my mind and I feel my body changing
I sure itâs an evil presence and it stalks me for my soul

Theyâre in control
Torment my mind
They have my soul
Poltergeist
