Youâre bound by invisible chains
Stricken with terror as I spread my black wings
Waiting in line one by one
No more crucifixions, this is more fun

Dreading the thought you must be in hell
Choking on vomit, the sickening smell
A huge deep razor just paper thin
Cuts right down through the bone as I grin

Crying innocent wondering why
Is this the way that they should die?
Lead single file on through the gates
On to the slaughter all life I hate

Levitation guides their way
As the pictureâs growing clear
People being skinned alive
Sliding down a huge steep razor

Chunks of meat falling to the ground
Lifeâs now pain as it turns out
Soul awake, a painful gory birth
Sliding, still, a shredded skeletal mess

Feeling the pain of a thousand paper cuts
Gravity forcing the weight of your body
Down the throbbing pain of release
Dismembering, slicing, down though your soul

I scream, in joy as I watch you fall apart
While I play in the ribbons of your flesh
I bask in the glory of the remains of my victims
Your once human form just a pile of lifeâs pain
