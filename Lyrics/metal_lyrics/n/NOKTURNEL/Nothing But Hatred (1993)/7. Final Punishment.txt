Our worldâs destruction can only be prevented
For so long until its termination
Technological advances 1000 years behind
We have no choice, no choice but to die

Maybe by the wrath of god
Or maybe Satanâs finally won
The planet kept its fucking peace
It didnât matter, still begun
Death is here, apocalypse
No more future souls are ripped
Armageddon in the skies
All thatâs heard are whimpering cries
Not a single missile launched
Just a couple bullets fired
Natural disaster caused the earth to expire
Now!

I like that!

Earthquakes, collapsing cities
Destroying electrical power
Our source of food, cannibalism
Only blood quenches the thirst
The oceans we knew crashed themselves off
Coastlines which are now extinct
Like animals we hunt down our prey
And countdown our final days

Volcanic eruptions coating our cities
Rivers of fire causing annihilation
Acid starts to rain from blood red skies
The planet we once knew shows no signs of life
