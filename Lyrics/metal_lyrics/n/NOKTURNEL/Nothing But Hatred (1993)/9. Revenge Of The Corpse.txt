Walking through a mist towards a reddish light
I wander for what seems to be days
A vision of a child just steps away
But she remains just out of reach

I lived a normal life, did my share of sinning
Not enough to burn in hell
I realize I was wrong , my destiny is clear
Fucked over and Godâs to blame

Transformation, the demon takes its form
Attacked and dragged through the gates
Rewarded by the guards of hell
Revenge is on my mind

Evil beings inform me of my fate
They say Iâm to serve the master
Sitting on his throne heâs laughing
Knowing I will bring disaster

I burst through the earth in the form of a demon
A winged living corpse with great intelligence
Feeding on people and taking their lives
Fuck morality, I wasted my whole life

I tried to live a life of morality
Expecting a free trip to heaven
Overlooked by God to suffer for eternity
He will never be forgiven
