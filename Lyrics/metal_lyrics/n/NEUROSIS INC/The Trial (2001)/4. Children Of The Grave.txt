[Black Sabbath cover]

[Letra y MÃºsica: O. Osbourne / T. Iommi / G. Butler / B. Ward]

Revolution in their minds
The children start to march
Against the world
In which they have to live in
And all the hate thatÂ´s in their hearts
TheyÂ´re tired of being pushed around
And told just what to do
TheyÂ´ll fight the world until theyÂ´ve won
And love comes flowing through, yeah!!

Children of tomorrow live
In the tears that flow today
Will the sun rise up tomorrow bringing
Peace in anyway?
Must the world live in the shadow
Of atomic fear?
Can they win the fight for peace
Or will they disappear...yeah!!
Children of the grave...
You must be brave...
Hu!!??

So you children of the world
Listen to what I say
If you want a better place to live in
Spread the words today
Show the world that love is still alive
You must be brave
Are you children of today
Are children of the grave, yeah!!
Come on!!
Children...of...the...grave...
