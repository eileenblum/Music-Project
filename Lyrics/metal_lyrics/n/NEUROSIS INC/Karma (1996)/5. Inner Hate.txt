[Letra &amp; MÃºsica: C. Rodriguez]

My day, my day starts with a sigh
A sigh that I don't know how long will last
Every dawn I think I have a vision
Of how I will react to the world

Inner hate - react
Inner hate - awake

My hate, my hate is about to flow
When very young
We wanted to change the world
But now the world has changed us
Do I have to remain silent?

Inner hate - awake

I don't want to live this way
I don't want to remain silent
I want my reaction
I don't want any more confusion

Sometimes I hear
Voices in my head
Created
In my subconscious
Those voices
Invite me to explode
To win back
What I gave to this life

I look at life
As something wrong
The matrix of my being
Wants to reign
The voices
Are getting louder
My unconscious reality
Is coming
