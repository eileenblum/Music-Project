[Letra &amp; MÃºsica: J. Mackenzie]

She gave me her hand
Led me out of the ruins
Anaesthesia for a painful life
New eyes for a new life

She is the fountain of innocence
The glory of a battle won
A bright red river of passion
That never meets the sea
In her precious womb
My son will be born
To breed a love fallen from the hands of god

Contradict, oppose, reject, confront
The ones that say that have never been in love
Contradict, oppose, reject, confront

If you want true love pain is close at hand
Pain is a part of life and has its reward

I said I would love her after death
She did not believe but the promise is still kept
I died a few years ago and my son became a  man

She took away her hand
And led me back into the ruins
The anaesthesia was gone
And the eyes became so blind
The fountain ceised to exist
The battle was lost
And the bright red river of passion
Finally met the sea
She is the fountain of innocence
The glory of a battle won
