[Letra &amp; MÃºsica: J. Mackenzie]

Nothing remains of my past
Just a little hatred
A little fear inside
The white man has come

Nothing reminds me of my past
What I used to do, used to feel
A new life is born from today
Learn to walk fast in this game

The white man has come
Wiped out all my tribe
Killed all my best pride
Crushed all my beliefs

Now I must learn to play the dirty game
Dirty game with no honesty
No remorse, my death is sure
Disease is waiting on my back

Who discovered who?
Is the primitive man?
Who is the beast?
Who wrote the history?

The deadly white man
The man who killed my tribe
The bastards that came across the sea
And filled our lives with pain
Now there is no future for me

Technology - seems to me absurd
Technology - the way to kill fast

Who discovered who?
Is the primitive man?
Who is the beast?
Who wrote the history?
