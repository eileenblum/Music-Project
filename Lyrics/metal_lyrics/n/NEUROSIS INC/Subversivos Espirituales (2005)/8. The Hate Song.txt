[Letra: D. Melo - MÃºsica: J. Mackenzie]

Vengeance, the only escape
Neurons invaded by terror
Pain in the deepest of the heart
Madness blackening my soul

The wrathÂ´s pleasure
The hand of sin
Tearing my bowels
I should be free
My hate obsesses
IÂ´m hungry for flesh
Wrapped flesh in blood scarlet
With no regrets

Adorned with the badge of death
Pain now arrives
And my hate is flaming
Now I am free
No remorse, no celebration
Psycho control
Sealing your eyes now
Exhibits great power
LetÂ´s go to inferno
We are fucking sick
Everyone has reasons
ItÂ´s the flame again

Hate song - demonÂ´s tongue
HellÂ´s scream your own world
The last decision
ItÂ´s the human instinct
To kill, to hate, to die
Hate song - demonÂ´s tongue
To kill, to hate, to die

Your hate dominates
SheÂ´s your demon
Can you control your fucking demon?
No remorse, no celebration
Psycho control
Sealing your eyes now
Now exhibits great power
LetÂ´s go to inferno - hate!
