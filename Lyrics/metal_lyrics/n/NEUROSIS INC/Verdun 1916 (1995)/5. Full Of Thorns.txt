[Lyrics &amp; Music: J. Mackenzie]

Music is a path full of thorns
It is to be at war
Fighting everyday
Without fearing the future

Some were left in the way
And changed their convicitions
You had to be strong
And take the damn risk

I did not want to be a lawyer
Laws are relative
I did not want to be a business man
Money is ephemeral

I wanted to be a musician
Music is perpetual
And my pocket is empty
But I am fucking proud

You donÂ´t know what pain is
To suffer all these years
Opposing forces trying to crush
Surviving in a lost society

Not loved, only pain
No respect, no esteem
A brave warrior in a heartless world
Unwinding the human thoughts
A brave warrior in a heartless world
Fighting for whoever thinks the same
