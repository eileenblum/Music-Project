[Lyrics &amp; Music : J. Mackenzie]

When you die, the mysteries of life
Become so clear, eternity is near
Watch your soul, rise from earth
Flow to the skies, it does not die

[Chorus]
The eyes of the soul
In life in death remain
The eyes of the soul
In life in death remain

Now I found the answers
To the contradictions
I had on earth
Now I can rest

[Repeat Chorus]

Lost inside the nowhere
CanÂ´t find my way
To the light
Dark souls around me

Dark stories have been told
About death, another life
Another body, another life
Now I remember
IÂ´ve been here before

[Repeat Chorus]

Strange reality is this
Life after life you come here
Too many religions on earth
And only one final stage

Evolution is here
Primitive thoughts on earth
To deny reincarnation is to deny
The evolution of mankind
