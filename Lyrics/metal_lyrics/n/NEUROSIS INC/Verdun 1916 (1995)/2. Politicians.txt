[Lyrics &amp; Music : J. Mackenzie]

By disgrace our nation [x2]
Suffers from a cancer
Politicians keep the money
In their bank accounts

They steal, they rob [x2]
And no one says a word
I am sick, I am tired
Of this corruption

I donÂ´t need no lies [x2]
I donÂ´t need your rules
LetÂ´s start a war
Sacrifice their rules

Politicians, politicians
Politicians, politicians

YouÂ´re a fucking politician
I donÂ´t need no lies
I donÂ´t need your rules
