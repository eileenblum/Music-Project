[Letra &amp; MÃºsica : J. Mackenzie]

Welcome son of fatherland
To the war machine
Here youÂ´re not allowed to think [x2]
Only to obey

Many months of sacrifice
For a few men
That from one day to the other
Are the owners of your life
Here youÂ´re not allowed to think [x2]
Only to obey

Kill a brother and receive your medal
Obey the order and write
Your name for history
They say here is discipline
But I only see corruption

Slave of the high commands
Dehumanized in the lines
Confined to hard labour
This is a concentration camp

Isolated in your defense post
The hours seem eternal
Paranoia is something normal
Where fear is your only friend

Democracy is a farce
In the armed institution
Soldier of the fatherland
Disobey the order
Here youÂ´re not allowed to think [x2]
Only to obey
