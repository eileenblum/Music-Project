[Letra: H. Escobar / J. Mackenzie - MÃºsica: J. Mackenzie]

Ancient times, long time ago
The battle for fire began
The struggle for a treasure
That gods had given to humanity

The beginning, a new era
To awake, to conquer the land
The lack of wisdom
Condemned them to eternal war

The fire a dream, has been a nightmare
The way to power
Beginning human extinction

Fighting for a precious secret
Fighting for survival

A precious secret to last forever
The key to survival
And to rule over the others
Survive, kill, attack, to conquer the land...

Battle for fire - battle for fire
Battle - fire!

The battle for a sacred secret
Punishment... burn in fire

A precious secret to last forever
The key to survival
To rule over the others
