[Letra: D. GÃ³mez / H. Escobar / J. Mackenzie - MÃºsica: J. Mackenzie]

Nazi guards are screaming
Soon they will stop living
Herding the people into lines
One of them is to board
The train to auschwitz
Horror and pain soon to come...
The death camp

There are jews
Wearing their yellow stars
Poles, people from the world
Wishing theyÂ´d never been born
Suffering all the scorn

As the bombs fall - we are praying
As the bombs fall - nazis are coming
As the bombs fall - people are dying
As the bombs fall - weÂ´re still roaming

Hitler hates the human race
They refuse to fight in the war
Give their lives to die
Offer their souls to sacrifice
The blood of innocents
As the bombs fall we sit...
Here listening
