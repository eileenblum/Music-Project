[Letra: H. Escobar / J. Mackenzie - MÃºsica: J. Mackenzie]

The trial...
Vengeance
Of the first world war
Sacrifice
The helpless and weak
War
Rampant and out of control
Destroy
Human life with no turning point

Helpless and humble
The nazi leaders sat
But now the time had come
To judge and condemn
The horrors made
Holocaust not forgotten
Pain not forgotten

The trial - condemnation
The trial - not escape

Killers!
Thousands of murders
Of human bodies
The innocent they've killed
The war has finished
Only one thing is missing
To win the lost peace

[Repeat 1st verse]

No war!!
