[Letra &amp; MÃºsica: J. Mackenzie]

I have an open wound
Its right in my heart
When I watch this world
Getting worse and worse

The respect is lost
The truth has become a lie
We could change this shit
I have an open wound

[Coro]
Life means death
Love means hate
Peace means war
Life means death

Can you heal my open wound?
Perhaps if you behave better
If you stop destroying the world
You think you are so cool...

The respect is lost
The truth has become a lie
We could change this shit
I have an open wound

Life means death
Love means hate
Peace means war
Life means death
