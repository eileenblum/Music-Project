And the siienceWhen a ery of birds calms down And the silenceWhen a sound of tife dies for a momentThat's I come deeper to youI set your fear free - when I wantI change your tears in laughterCome with meForget about hypocrisy - whose wordsinvite my dreams Come with me I'll feed you with words - whose handspush me in the abyss Raging fire Burned my mind I wake my hatred I rape sleeping taste I cut heads of traitors Fallen like me They pray to god Defamed on face In the path dead human bodies Naked bodies I lead word of master I sing the track with the blood In a dungeon fuli of pain I find a voice Hurricane of swords Stop a time Burning sunrise rips my eye-lids Sharp like swords light cuts my head Joy of day pierce me with thorn Jerked in sleeping consciousness I fell bitterness, furiously pain Choke me feelers of disdain Wakes me, jerked reality Where I was Covered with blood Where did I run awayCovered with madness Who I was afraid Of crouched in mind
