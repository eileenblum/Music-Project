A stupid fucking world 
Turned against me
Nobody knows me 
Embraces me treason 
Wrote in blood and fear

I feel pain 
From hands man 
Which was my friend 
I stay alone

A conspiracy of silence 
Is present everywhere 
Binds your mouths 
You haven't a choice 
Free is only 
Your inner voice

Lies and hypocrisy 
Every - day 
Tear out feelings 
Mass suicides 
My eyes see 
World of violence 
Unknown ways 
We're other 
Deprived a feelings

We mused on us 
We're killing truth 
Hiden in words of 
Oblivion and harm
