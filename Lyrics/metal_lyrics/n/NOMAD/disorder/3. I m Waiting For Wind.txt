Forgotten eternal laws Bespited faith is silent Sculptures and temples Are flown round by that time The priest born with old sin Nature dies inside you Dust covered your face Get up and wake your life It's time to define your self The prayer silent in walls Whisper strokes my hairI wipe truth through a fear I lose with my dignity I shut with my heart I miss with my senses I amThe slave of time, vagrant of destiny, puppet in infirmity Lost joy, great abyss, lakÄ™ of sorrow Naked word, first dawn, eternal pain Lost in paths of night Looked at my time You blaspheme so Innocent I'm waiting for wind And he upon the cross is silent And cries with blood Blood flown Innocent I don't drink that blood I don't eat that body If I cry, I don't listenIf he is, I stopped to believe him Thats you move so slowly So precsisely consumes My mind and my heart I'm waiting for wind And only blood is measure of justice And only whisper leads to truth Is he truth and salvation It's so sweet to cry in dream
