Mankind war Aimless murders Eternal fighting for Authority and territory Insensibility of sinful battle Lean prisoners Left houses Orphaned children Someone draws for strings Demands blood and pain Terror and violence In exchange for tears and suffering Multilaled soldiersCrushed familiesTowns in derbisesHeaven screened by dust clouds Millions corpses Putrefying bodies Screened your aroma Crimes places
