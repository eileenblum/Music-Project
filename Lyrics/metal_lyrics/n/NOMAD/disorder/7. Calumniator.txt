My mind is shouting With voice of monster Dark phantom Hidden under the mask My eyes are screaming, too Scalded in flames Welcome to cunning demon Calumniator of each truth Blaspheming your dance Strokes like sand Welcome My sin A thorn of my heart A forge of my slip Tyrant of your pride In my heartBores the holesBites the sinDrenched madnessI feelBottom of timeDesire depthChains of timeAnd fireAt his foot was wreathingLike snake around meAnd fireWas swaddling him so wheedlesomeIn my hands flashed his glow I haunt prayer for your god Conscience covers my face secretI'm suffering in colvulsion of eternal power Dance, dance - in flame of my eyes Scream, scream - with contempt of my days l'm asiring a well of my sinsl'm stepping through calumny of my worldWarm of curse swings my hands
