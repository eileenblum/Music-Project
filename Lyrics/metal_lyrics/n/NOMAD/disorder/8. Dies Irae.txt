A head wrapped a thorn crownHanged up on a treason's crossRaise a heavy eye-lids wait for sentence The world is burning with war's tire A masses stride in bloody wave Weight of sin press my mind My soul is burning with eternal Not closed wound A woman with desperate scream Is bearing a child. And you his soul Damn with sin Before me an abyssBorn by a faultBy your sin - GodI perish! I perish! I perish! My last danceAt your respectYour damned me by wordI ashamed you Approached a great wrath's time And in a last his hour Fresh blood is floating
