Mind above all and I can't see any gods hereNothing but devilish mutter of nature Mind is first, whirling above dwarfs- I open my soul filled with keys- Open your mind filled with pearlsSwollen bones and healthy turbines of intestinesThey push the blood into the eyes of lust fulfilmentsMind above the world and no god was hereNothing but old rags and fairy-tales knocked in children's dreamsMind is a life on the throne of adored bodyHe's a sparking star, defiled by christian slaveryTight mouths send the spells, open they roar with grom of momentsFulfilled with lust I'm raisingOn wind I'm dancing with himIn the dark forest I chase my thoughtsOnce I got lost here, oh, those bloody daysAnd I remember your lips, now I became him"And I cry from happiness and I howl like a pupand I whimper like a butchered animal.My name is freedom!!!Even in an atheistic call"
