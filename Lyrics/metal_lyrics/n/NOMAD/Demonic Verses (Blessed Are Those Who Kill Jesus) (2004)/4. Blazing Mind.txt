You must die, in the hell there's no more place for youYou are already the past that fallibly beats its breastI would remain passive If your crusade didn't have such a pastAs always I can exist beyond your worldI've stopped taking care of consciousness of the foolI am the thought, the great law of needsYou won't understand, why I think in a different wayAnd I don't give a shit about the curse of the cartoon godLaughing I consider only as the nature of the past thingYou must die, in the hell there's no more place for youYou are already the past that fallibly beats its breastOh, you have to just for a moment feel your thoughts through meIn inconstant stream of supposed propheciesI am the only one who understood that lostI could have finished that long time ago or looked for confederatesEverything's got its price, only a coward misses his honour"Disgrace is the ambiguity of need""Yes, I found a grave full of the resurrected spiritand soon I felt the irony of this whole world.Because when I was taking the robe off in a big fear, I saw my corpse turned into the honey-cake."
