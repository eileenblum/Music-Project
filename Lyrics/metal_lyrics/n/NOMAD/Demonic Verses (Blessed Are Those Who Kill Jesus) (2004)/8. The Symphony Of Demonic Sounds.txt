Slaughtered by the sword of argumentsUnearthed by verses of disdainDestructive for the victims giving themselves to himLost in the souls sacrificed to himYour shepherd has forgotten what to do nextHe was destroyed by the patron of his adorationThe harvest of revenge devours the dumb orphansThe daughters of omnipotent father are tremblingMerciless wars in the name of their prophetGod - violence Mercy - deathEvil - degradation Disability - goodTears - disgraceChains - LifeEnvy - coffinPromises - trickThe dumb redeemer's days of glory have already goneSons of the cross are pushed awayTheir chopped off dead heads are still in silenceThe blood is being shed and wars for a better world still go onGod - violence Mercy - deathEvil - degradation Disability - goodTears - disgraceChains - LifeEnvy - coffinPromises - trickBurn all the coffins with the heroes of a sanctified expiation and mercyLasting debates on the better sacrifice of painful expiationdon't lead to a healthy life..."Screams about a common sense won't change anything.Each of us thinks about his stomach first.""Friendship is the god of time"And now get the fuck out you jesus experiment!!!
