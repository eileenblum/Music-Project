The anger of sea, when the nature calls the heart The anger of fire, when the mind is full of gratitude The judgement to the fool and the whip to the slavesThe arsenal of mud to the blindThe war of lies to the hypocritesI call the time a dimension of the deep seaBlow of fire is the deputy of separated childrenDawn of monuments rises between the death and the faultOh, hug me, distant is your voice Oh, tear me apart, near is your whisperNarcotic eyes, rapturous revengesFire rolls the blizzard of wavesThe veil of wind, when the blood wanders through the bodyThe velocity of sun, when bones are topped by a spellThe pulse of the running wisdomThe furious goatish bastards flounder into the hell Boughs entangled in the union are drinking new era dropsDreams of earth namesAnd speak with the voice of starsAnd dance with the blackness of colours
