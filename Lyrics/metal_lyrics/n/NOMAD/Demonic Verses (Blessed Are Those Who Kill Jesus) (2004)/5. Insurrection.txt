Hungry eyes like a windReproduction blows off naked fields slightly Frozen mouths like a whirlGusty dance of angry speechesSatiated areas of lit groansMourning flagsThe grape picking is comingThere is cool rainy duskLumped desires are bitingDragged bodies of the torture are stinkingIt's time to flog the enlightened renovationGraves of battles and bowsRavens of whispers and dyingAd infinitum I'm hitting the nameThe anger has forgotten about the tornado on dry sandsOh, skies of power Oh, horizon of phantomsOh, you trampling my hopeOh, you keeping silent in a treeHungry senses - the velvetThe fortress choir pulsatesHeart of love is like lakesThe power is flowing inEchoes are loaded in cannons of freedomLines of unhappiness are in attributes of conquerorsScandals dug in childhood upSalutes oversounded because of dirties"My friend demon has given wings to me.Like a sage with his wisdom he has calculated the bloody trait of human applauses"
