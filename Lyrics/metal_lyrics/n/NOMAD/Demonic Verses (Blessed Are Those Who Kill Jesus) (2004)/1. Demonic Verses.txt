I'm beyond that what you areI'm rising when you are passing meI'm growing nursed by the power pathI can see deeper, because my shoots are growing from the bottomI'm the centre of earth depthsDeaf like a scab you can't see anythingI'm lightning candles of death somewhere near your dumb lustFriendly graves are humming serenades for meI'm cuddling children hungry for powerThe row of my sparks is burning right next to your fearYou haven't been to me like this, I feel the touch of disgraceI'm always above that what you could think ofI'm rising inconceivable, nobody lies to me no moreI can see with the depth of what my fear's singingAs always I'm thinking in other way, because since the beginning I'm above"Pride - what doeas it mean in the eyes of victory?My silence isn't a stupidity, but the sign of bravery"
