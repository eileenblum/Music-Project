Land of excellence
Understanding without care
Paradise for the earthly life
Let's be blessed...

Oh, we belong to you, Lord
Oh, we are at your command
Oh, insatiable by our death,
Oh, insatiable by our incompetence

Let's be your eternity
Our souls necessity

Shell called the skull of worry
The mind as the power of destroying
Hermitage of the restraint for the timid
Unchecked desire for the bold
Existence full of contradictions
Crowds of exponents of one's sins
The huge ear of the god and his tied mouth
Slanderer sitting in the memory of defeats
Ego called the whim of the owner
Meaningless life in the eyes of torturer
You cut your bodies being afraid of a future
Suffering is balancing your poverty and meanness

Dressed in feathers of the nobility
Returning respect for the membership
Promises, dogma, prophets and stories
Everyone misses the leader of your unity

Now I know that the Enlightenment preoccupies madmen
Appointed in law you throw logs under each other's feet
You are one large bloody herd giving back appearances of worshiping
For the happiness of the public you put a stab in neighbours' back
You dig the dead out to be pleased by an illusion of hope.

And where this mast is which holds the sail of pride of living and where is the one giving everything back for nothing?
Since still I can hear your cry, what are these all sacrifices worth?...
