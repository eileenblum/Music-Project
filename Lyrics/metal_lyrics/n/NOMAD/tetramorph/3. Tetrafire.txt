Let me free myself
Give me some space to last
I canât get out
Iâm now a spark 
I want to be lofty
Unstable and unattainable
I want to be finished - complete at last
Unapproachable and radiant

I fuel a life
I give a delight of lasting, so
Fan me
Let me warm you up
Let your glassy eyes see me
Disperse me all over the world
I will burn the troublemakers
I will turn into dust falsehood and all the symbols

Use me as a saviour
Follow me as a worshipper 
Through life and death
Through truth and falsehood
Call me no god
Iâve got one name
And in every language I mean the same:
Fire, flame, and instability

â¦kindle me to lastâ¦ â¦water me to existâ¦
