I tread on you when thoughtful or angry
I sit on you resting or dreaming
I lie on you sleeping or loving
You, still inflexible, rush on an ellipse
You, still inflexible, donât answer

I touch or move you 
I curse or crush you 
I want to escape or take off
You, still inflexible, go around in your ellipse
You, still untamed, proceed nobody knows where

There are still so many questions about your origin
There are still so many what-ifs about your lifespan
Iâd like to bite into you so much
And how much I wish to embrace you whole
