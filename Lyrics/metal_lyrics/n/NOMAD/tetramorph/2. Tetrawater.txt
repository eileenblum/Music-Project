Penetrate my depth
Immerse in me
Look in my source
Get me out of depths
Out of unconsciousness
Let me experience a breath
Let me join with the air
Pour me into your body
Feel my grip
Satisfy my thirst
Now touch my mirror
Examine yourself in vanity
Jump into and feel a splash
You wonât get me
No fool ever would, so
Take shame off your face
Let them see your vastness

â¦This is a war on what they say about you and on what you know about yourself!
