Reveal me the secret of your power
Raise me with your gust
Cover me in your arms

Begin a whirl dance
Destroy pride and void
Rush in to my lungs

Let me scream into the world
Let it knock the fool over
Let it destroy the liars

Find me a place of the beginning
Fence me off with a screen of skies
Wrap me in a scornful mirage

Pump my veins up with your breath
Stigmatize with your name
Reward with your burden

â¦You, who whip bodies angrily and flagellate sad faces.
