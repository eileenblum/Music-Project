All stars have calmed downThe great storm has goneNow the dusk has come .And first beam of lightHow very eternal Oh word - sounding with gloryOh might - of eternal truth You are the lordThe lord of this worldThy name is damnedFor ages till the end Obliterated labor of the creatorMeans to me not so much as you Awful odor of soulsRubbed after time of his wordsFire burnt the sinAnd you among frost of waves Come to me - on thorns and mudCome to me - on blind pathsCome to me - on false words In my heart there already aren't thornsTroublesome their cloudEchoedGrowing to tone Past between the timesInvites the sudden creatureMelodies of my dreams
