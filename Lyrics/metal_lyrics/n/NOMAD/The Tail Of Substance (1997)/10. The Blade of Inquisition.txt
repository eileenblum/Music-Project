Under the big blade of black inquisitionI dragged a witch and a pile of other caresI dragged a shrew dirty and wildI mocked blaming her by the end of lashIt lasted as if two centuriesThy sick ancestors' anguishes,however carnal like me Hungry is this child with little eyesLean and in without material handsWouldn't I take it cover, feed and be with it?I can't answer myself, the bell is ringing nowIn pews the same ones saw it,it little, crying one - take Under the naked blade of thousandth inquisitionI dragged a witch - old like leprosyI dragged her by hair tearing a pavement Old was a man I will tell youHe was sitting at a wall covered as in frostHe was groaning in front of us begging mercyHe lost his legs fighting for countryHis family died because that's the fateI wanted to feed him when strange chanceMy own grandma kicked his into the cornerThat bell sounded. What to do?I'm going, There is a nice front Old was a manHa was sitting at a wallHe was groaning in front of usHe lost his legsI wanted to feed himMy own grandma kicked hisThat belt sounded. What to do?I'm going, there is a nice front Under the living blade of my inquisitionI'm dragging that witchI don't know no more from whereShe's unusual clear not to recognize.This sudden change could astonishNo, I don't believe,the witchcrafts are getting me wrongI was in pew, church poolI twisted my hands with the hopeAnd what she? And where is she?Under the living light there wind blew into herThis old witch is indeed me You are too high to see how low you are
