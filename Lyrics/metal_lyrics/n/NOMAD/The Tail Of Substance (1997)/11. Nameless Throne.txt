Protect your godStorm is comingRun away before the windAbundance of truth swellsDisappearance stupidity and hopeNow took for a refugeFoots of power and wordsOf my truth will crush you Locked gales before greedy handSilent altar bestowed a humilityNameless throne persuades to faithMadman without scruples pronounces falseYou're crawling in front of the symbol created by youYou're a puppet of your fear Wake your dry lifeUncover eyes before the truthStop spitting at concealmentYou won't revive the dead words Dictator's eyes are closedThat sight is forbiddenParadise is impossible for youI spit in tyrant's face Goes army of hungry soulsGoes disgrace of your thoughtsGoes world full of truthGoes revenge on the glory throne Power cursed for ages is comingDelight of your desires is waking upHypnotized rise to scream The dead will always cry
