Merciful fateIs wandering somewhere in mindPictures of a beautiful moment are flittingI draw the door in my heartWhile a thorny fruit of the scattered nightI'm swallowing in moonshine Yes, in that brightnessyou stayed covered with a shadeSo known but distantYou had hands covered with a dewAnd your hair was as rose shreds Wind blows away your black garmentsYour delightful touch covers me so When you wrap up my bodyby a noose of dreamYou beat thorns deepYou tear me up like a vultureMy scars bumWhite you are waiting for a step The deep of my hampered dreamsAnd thy mouth full of caninesI stop to drink ah envy nectarMade red-hot like a steel,I melt in a fogYou run away to the night like a specter Around me flowers have already faded awayAnd a bird has stirred up the wind by its wingsI hold strongly while blood is so gushingBy stream of desires I swim awayThe deep of my hampered dreamsAnd the mouth full of canines
