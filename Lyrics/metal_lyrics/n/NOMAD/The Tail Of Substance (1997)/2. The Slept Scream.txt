My eyes don't want moreTo look at this painMy ears don't wantTo hear about the sufferingsMy hands don't wantTo wash your woundsMy mouth don't wantTo blunder in your truth I creep in a swampI curse towards the sunI wash with bloodMy sick consciousness Yes, l am sinBut not the first oneBorn in this painI am lost in your fateYour pain is a passion I died for youI hate himI am wingedI drown in laughterA fate in youCome to usCome to us I am the word of my masterHis creation in your handsHis ignominy and your suffering
