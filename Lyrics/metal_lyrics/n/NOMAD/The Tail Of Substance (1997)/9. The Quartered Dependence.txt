Narrow dream in the lost storm of wordsDumb herds of sonorous grumblesKilled colonies of utopian sheets A vault of narrow cornersA pulp multiplied with unyieldnessA sight of dark vacuumWild, infernal desiresAnd you spun by a prose of mockery I rose as cold as abyssI emerged with invidious smileOf my creative bodyEmpty your eyes at dawnShy splutter of illuminated tearsYour body trembling and smallAgain you fall down like a broken glass Covered procession of besmeared caresThreatening whispers of masked brothersSilent lusts beaten by a torn heartAnd fingernails driven into a coffin lid Fabulous angel somewhere on a dream screenOld fruits of bitter wordsMinds stuck to the gospel of threats I hiss like a pulpy grainI sprout in a concrete gripYesterday I was a stream,today I'm a damOverturned I'm vomiting in a whirlNight rocks the gray curtainsYour little flame goes outWhat do you crush an infant for?Driving a nail Into the eyesWhy do you lie building a sand race?
