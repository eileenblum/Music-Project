My childhood was a monument of hypocrisyI was growing fed with my ancestors' GodI used to fall a sleep with a sing of crossWhich I never understood My eyes shinedA light of the starsDesires penetratedThe walls of bodies I look in the sky at assure of the expanseI deep insideWhere is the paradise?My life isn't laughterMy way isn't pathBattered down by you White wings are flapping without any hopeThe sad tears are flowingas blood from unwanted woundWords are emptywhen wind has already blown them awayAnd you are still killing in the name of fate Distant flame warms me stronglyA glow of its words inside meI flow a border of its truthI pace a path of my desires I'm rocking by the windFilled up with angerAnd spot the time with serenity My life is hell of your paradiseThy words are the false drowned in a mudThy curse is life a step forward My eyes shinedA light of the starsDesires penetratedThe walls of bodies
