Cicatrized thoughts in torn mindScattered remains of an awful amokA knife of stupidity cuts powerless bodiesMy enlightened thoughts and griefAre bleeding in the kingdom of my dream Oh, Lord of eternal wavesOh, Master of every truth Black suns have already died awayNow, beyond me downNaked landscape or my mindIs climbing on stairs of living words Dusk lighted up the dawnStreams of my cares calm downCalm down ravished by a windIced stream of blood pulsatesPushed by a breathIn mercy the fear Look at the world and the wayShepherd of your own fateBetrothed she meddles a stoneWrapped up she throws a voice The cryRoar of the hunger sourceTime is windPoisoned like trees The cryBurned in the sun of liesMercy took the fear awayTogether I'm lost Up to the worldInks of muddy clouds Winter of thorns of my bloodI love to speak at thresholdMy life is a fogThe stigmas already died awayI poisoned an old root
