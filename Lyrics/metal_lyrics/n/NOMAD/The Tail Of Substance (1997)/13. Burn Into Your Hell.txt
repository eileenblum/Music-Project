Under the azure of mountains blundering eyesBeyond the heads of inclining cloudsStriking in wall words pressed with a prayer Pale messiah spoke: I'm The Kingglorify my name In your songsI'm the only Son of that Father Streams as acrid as wine are flowingpain, despair and fearThoughts as black as symbol are getting lost -desire, freedom &amp; miracleHands and words with bitterness are pressing -to their master foots Don't cry when your foots are in thornsI'm yet merciful and paradise is real for you Streams groove the furrows wounded because of cryScalded by lust priests limpChildren are gathered in one basked like fish When I'm hungry bring me your foodTo my priests' earsWhen your hearts are in painPresent my altar with humility Effeminate and faded already for agesRotten and old like the world at your gatesDim and lost in verses of his own strophes Father, aren't you in my voice?Power, aren't you in my hands?Father, Father - heavenlyWhere is your merciful dog? Was to suffer given to you?Will to suffer given to you?In the name of skeleton and your God Bum in your hellFry in your pitchDead is your GodDead and dumbHe rotted long time ago!!!
