Sanctimonious
Reproduce to repent
Nurture the unloved
And drag them out as spiritual...waste - waste - spiritual waste
Move those pious hands
Off that which isn't yours
Hers are hallowed parts
Governed by her right to...choose - choose - right to choose
If as you say life is so sacred
Why is quality of life an afterhought?
Blows - to the body
Plunder and rule (that) most personal of property
"Murder" on the unborn, yet some newborn die a thousand times
And if, as you say, life is so sacred
Why is quality of life an afterhought?
Blows - to the body
The seed is sown
She reaps the harvest
Therefore she controls the earth
"Governed", "By" a right to choose
Controlling a womb
Does not make her a vehicle
She dictates the terms
