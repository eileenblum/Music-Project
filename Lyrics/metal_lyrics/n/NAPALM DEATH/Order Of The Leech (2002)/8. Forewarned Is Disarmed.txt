"Must have peace" - under arsenals in the sky
"Must have peace" - through we'll strike at aby time
"We must have peace"
Forewarned is disarmed?
Conduct post mortems
As trigger fingers twitch to right a wrong
"Must have peace" - though the megaton decree
"Must have peace" - warn the global police
"We must have peace"
Forewarned is disarmed?
Just do as we don't
And be subservient as the right your wrongs
Star Wars no more!
After all (it's) perferctly acceptable
To pervert that which you enforce
Subhuman death squads - good Christian soldiers
Subhuman death squads - good Christian soldiers
Free will is unconditional
With penace primed over your head
Subhuman death squads - good Christian soldiers
Subhuman death squads - good Christian soldiers
Forewarned is disarmed?
Never again
At least until we need to right your wrongs
Star Wars no more!
