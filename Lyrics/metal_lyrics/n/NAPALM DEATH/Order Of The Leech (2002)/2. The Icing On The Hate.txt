Cut the line - I'm suffocating
Cannot feel - without I'm aching
Desire lost - my heart is racing
I feel cursed - am I mistaken
Doomed to walk the path that's chosen
Regret - a mountain yet to climb
Belief - that pain will ease in time
Embrace - a life that I betrayed
The icing on the hate...
Trapped inside - this self-addiction
Forced to see my own afliction
Through the eyes - deseased reflections
Kaleidoscopic - death in segments
A second chance at resurrection
The high of high's seemed endless
The shapeless fear ascending
Ride the carousel of punishment
The days of dazed emotions
And spells I cast seem broken
Ride the carousel of punishment
Cards are down - a choice needs making
Look a the past - or keep on dreaming
Pulled the plug - for now I'm winning
Closed the chapter - new beginnings
Closed the chapter - new beginnings
