Admiration's one thing
Lucid submission another
Our gracious heads of state
Our vacuous heads of state!
Kings and Queens - order of the leech
Majesty? Don't patronise me
Several hundred years of burden
Taken for a ride, but it swells our pride
When you humble yourself
And you bow at their feet
You indulge these re-gal thieves
You pardon these re-gal thieves
Kings and Queens - order of the leech
Majesty? Don't patronise me
Several hundred years of immunity
Taken for a ride, but it swells our pride
Number one disfunctional family
But judge not the aristocracy
Oh, such people people
Break the backs of servants
Watch wars kill millions
Milk praise from the ruins
People people under an illusion
People people under an illusion
People people under an illusion
