In a dayz for days
Let normality blur the vision
Perseverance in trauma
I falter though I ought to take it in my stride
See the bitter narcoleptic
Sperma-downer - Narcoleptic
I'm bursting with intention
'til the cause hits the horizon
The buck's too hot to handle when it's there to be passed
See the bitter narcoleptic
Dead-eye, red-eyed narcoleptic
Constructn a weightless world to hold
Aloft my shoulders
Actions do speak louder than words
But inaction leaves me undisturbed
Free the embrace the finer trappings of a
Barely functioning being
Constructn a weightless world to hold
Aloft my shoulders
