I'd rating die probing something
Than see the urge, shot to fucking pieces
Rip that face off - who goes there?
You may - you may doubt the necessity
You may - you may feign incredulity
On break - you're toeing the line!
Quadruple standarts
For a set of ruler
So you don't fall prey
To the ill-at-ease - who goes there?
Cast out - cast out to private hell
Where the - where the loose lipped freely expel...
...Streams - of odious, twisted rationale
Streams - of odious, twisted, raving rationale
Rationale!
Be seen-and-not-heard
Balance of disturbance
Decorum? Ooh...ooh
The earnest refusal
The bleating manoeuvre
Decorum? Ooh...ooh
Streams - of wretched, heiniuos rationale
Streams - of wretched, heiniuos, depraved rationale
Rationale!
Buying the rawest deal
Dither, by dutyful
Apologish...ooh
I'd rather die doubting something
Than be consigned to anonymity
Kicking, screaming - who goes there?
You may - surrender manfully
You may - you may die in captivity
