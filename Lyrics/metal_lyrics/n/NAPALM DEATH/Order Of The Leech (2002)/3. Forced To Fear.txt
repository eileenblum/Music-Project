Scars dig deep they bleeds seeds
Within wounds I feed
The pools of life drain fast
To quench my anger
Selfish-isolating-persecution
Conquered nothing
Reckless-stupidity-heredetiry
Achievement stunted
Forced to fear
Thoughts cut hard, they burn numb
Perhaps all is done?
Has a piece of me been carved
To feed my hunger?
Selfish-isolating-persecution
Conquered nothing
Reckless-stupidity-heredetiry
Achievement stunted
Got to crack the mold before it sets
Escapist passion seems to be
The only way I really feel
The socual lair that we infest
Is pushing me towards the edge
Forced to fear the force of fear
For the first time in my life!
Reached inside my heart
Took whats pure and turned it sour
Coarse lines map my fear
The roots are soulless draining tears
Forced to fear the force of fear
For the first time in my life!
The coarse is clear in what I fear
An epitaph of apathy!
Scavengers to the carnage
The scars remain but putrify
Coiled in rage
Predators sense the weakness
Swarm like flies to pick my bones
Coiled in rage
Forced to fear
