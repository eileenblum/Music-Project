So we're still in our teething stages
As far as politics are concerned
That's fine coming from someone
To whom sensationalism be there only wisdom in words.

A self-proclaimed spokesman
On something to which prior knowledge excedes,
Championing no more censorship,
Then ridiculing our beliefs.

To appeal to your better nature,
Are we to keep our mouths shut?

Easy to discard
Constructive power
At your disposal
When ego's and sales
Outbalance opinions
On the scales.

Using bands
As pawns in your hands
Building up,
Knocking down,
Sensationalize
To suit cheap public demand.

Merging with the gutter press,
You claim to detest.

It's opened it's lid,
For you to crawl in and infest.
