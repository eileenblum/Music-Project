An integral sense
Comes with belonging to a scene
Supposedly absent of barriers
(When sexism is only one of many)

Earnest words
Calling for unity of the sexes
When she's still the chick, or stupid bitch
(Ridiculed for showing an interest).

Hidden indifference
Strikes an emotion reaction
When you see an animal being abused.

Yet un-noticed when a woman
Is abused in the same way.

The links in oppression
Stem from the same degradation
But to one our eyes remain closed.

Actively abusing the rights of one
Whilst fighting for those of another.

The 'scene' may hold a different name,
But the roleplays just the same.
Egual rights are fine,
As long as she's in her place.

Outrightly denouncing fascism
Whilst oblivious to it taking place,
Is condemnation of standarts,
All an act to save face.

Unity a stark ambition
When out abuse surpasses recognition.
