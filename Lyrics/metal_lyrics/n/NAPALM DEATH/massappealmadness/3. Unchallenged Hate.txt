A chronic complaint of dimness.
Prevails your profound ideology.
A romantic vision of a master race.
Attained through coercive forms of authority.

Your observance is negligence.
If you see the threat from difficult cultures.
We're all in this sinking ship.
Each of us together.

Where does the whiteman stand?
Where does the blackman stand?
Where do we all fucking stand/
Knee deep in the shit!

Lock into yourself and you'll find the real oppressor.
To a life of unchallenged hate.
It's yourself who's the "nigger"
