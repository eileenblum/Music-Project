Adapting to different surroundings,
changing your views day by day,
too critical of others
when you too are at fault.
Several sets of opinions
like colours to camouflage yourself.
Like a fox sly in your manuuvres,
too soon you'll get caught unawares.
Sometimes I feel pity,
sometimes I feel hatred...
Sometimes you're my friend,
sometimes you're my enemy.
I'll never give you the satisfaction
of knowing how I feel.
