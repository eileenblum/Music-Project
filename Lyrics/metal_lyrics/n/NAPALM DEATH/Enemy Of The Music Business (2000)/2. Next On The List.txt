Next on the list?
Such a smug parasite
Snug in the comfort zone
We stepped back and watched
while you violated
our effects, our spirits, our souls

Opportunist scum, think you're so immune?
Opportunist scum, we yearn to see you removed.
Opportunist scum, truly spineless cunt.
Opportunist scum, basks in his loathsome glow.

kicking against the...........
..... taking vengeance..... our cultures
our effects, our spirits, our souls

Opportunist scum, think you're so immune?
Opportunist scum, we yearn to see you removed.
Opportunist scum, truly spineless cunt.
Opportunist scum, basks in his loathsome glow.

Where once I was passive, I'm ready to snap.
A pound of flesh for those that you've taken
That smiling surround can't shield you forever
When it slips, we'll be there to fuck your world!

A slap in the face
A slap in the face

Don't turn your back, don't lower your guard
Or assume you're safe around fellow sharks
'Cause when I catch that patronizing smirk
It strengthens my will to smash your worthless bulk

A slap in the face
A slap in the face
A slap in the face

Goodbye to logic for this necessary justice [2x]
