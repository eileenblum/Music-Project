Tiresome/ out-grown/ rebel's seen the light
Re-a/ djusted? Disowned his staunch defiance.

The Anti-Christ shifts to the right
He wears his âxâ and reviled mine.

Music to righteous ears [x4]

Moved out of step, seeking distorted views
Slack-brained sound bytes/ serve his public slop
Decries our values in decline
But should we starve, then thatâs just fine.

Knee-jerk reactionary
Knee-jerk reactionary
The Anti-Christ shift to the righthis past a convenient oversight

Knee-jerk reactionary
Knee-jerk reactionary
Decries our values in decline
He'd flick the switch and watch us fry.
