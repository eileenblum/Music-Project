Name your price for progress
Impoverished settle the bill
Clear a path--coming through!
Clear a path--coming through!

Stylize
Making it easy/ on the eye
Keep our distance--too underformed to grace the sublime

Flatter to decieve
Building arthouse cosmetics
Like a mismatched prosthetic
Like a mismatched prosthetic

Spreads like wildfire
Burgeoning yuppie nirvana
Highbrow aesthetics
Decadents always crave more

Marvel at/ the sleek design
The wilting talk/ of curves and lines

A piece-de/ resistance
To banish my pig-norance

The public gets/ what the public doesn't want
What use is this/ to man or beats
It glosses over/ basic needs

The public gets/ what the public doesn't want
Access denied/ we're utter philistines
Access denied/ we're utter philistines

Caged in the exclusion zone
Pass away/ in sepia tones
The public gets/ what the public doesn't want

Access denied? Accept we're cultural slime
Access denied? Accept we're cultural slime
