Everything fits nicely into place
Higher powers take the lead
Middleman sit, pondering his worth
One great scheme to stem (the) objective urge

Decision-making
and power playing
One up-manship

Show of hands
to clasp the myth
Vote in a new scourge

Everything fits nicely into place
Higher powers take the lead
Issues are decided before we've a chance to think
And moral high ground wins the day again

Decision-making
and power playing
principles spurned

Show of hands
to clasp the myth
Favors for my friends

it's a constitutional hell
where they pontificate and yell
Where etiquette outplays integrity
It's a constitutional hell

Everything fits nicely into place
higher powers take the lead
Sleeping giants show their real worth
I'll sum up on all the good you've done this earth...

...Nothing
