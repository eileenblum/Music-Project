The rats on/ this earth/ have nothing on you
An insult/ to those which/ crawl the sewers

Devourer, plunderer, deceptor

Sniff out a/ scheme/ and leave the scraps behind
Voracious, insatiable? A nose attuned to greed

Devourer, plunderer, deceptor

Evade all traps
and come out gnashing, snarling, gnashing, snarling!

Disguises are many
Media pawn or man on the street

They'll scavenge your emotions
and leave you diseased
They'd steal a last possession
And smile as you concede

Devourer, plunderer, deceptor
