I dissolve to a dream of the past
Terminate, to remove
Falling fast

at the end of a chain thoughts collect
Execute. A degree. I defect.

What's it worth?
Sacrifice the earth? It bleeds.
Meet your needs. Devilish deeds

Reconcile. Understood. Contemplate.
Desecrate. To denounce. Detonate.

Tentative. To reject. Overdue.
Final stage. To complete. Follow through.

Far too late.
Absolute hate? this Hell
An empty shell.
Desolate cells.

A necessary evil? bargaining pleas
Held at ransom? Or souls diseased
A necessary evil? the dominant role?
There's no escape? You crossed the solitary line.
