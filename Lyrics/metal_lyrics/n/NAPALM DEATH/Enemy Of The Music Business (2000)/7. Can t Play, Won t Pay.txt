Ten years
Of all-sides sniping
Fairness under fire

Ten long years
Rubbished objectives
Two-pronged shower of bile

Dirt/ is now scrubbed
From our own doorstep
But/ around every corner
Hides a high-roller

Suited
and heftily booted
So casual and concerned

Network
make the acquaintance
Dance to soulless tunes

Dirt/ is now scrubbed
From our own doorstep
But/ around every corner
Hides a high-roller

Get this prick away from me!
Smash him and the leeching clique

Fawning grin that pulls you in [x2]
Golden handshake on the take [x2]
Get this prick away from me

(We're) Enemies of the Music Business
You corporate fuck!
Enemies of the music business
Black sheep on the cusp
Enemies of the music business

Ten years
Still didn't finish us
Much to their disdain

Ten long years
Regained the impetus
Thorns in the cash-whores' side

Dirt/ is now scrubbed
From our own doorstep
But/ around every corner
Hides a high-roller
