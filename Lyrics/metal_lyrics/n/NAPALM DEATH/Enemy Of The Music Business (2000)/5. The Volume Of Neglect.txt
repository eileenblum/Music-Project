Speculate freely
begrudge me intensely
Lacking a conscience
lacking intelligence
Lesser than nothing
Lower than everything
As you drain our vitality
To a mundane reality

A form of therapy
Without compensation
A vague psychology

Free from obligation
intercept the negligence
accept the consequence
Amongst Barbaria
Mass hysteria

Opposite in a sign to abide
When the future is ours to decide
We continue to watch and observe
Just to find out what purpose it serves

Paralyzed? A spectacle for all to see
Happiness within our grasp, but out of reach

Volume of neglect
forcibly expressed
Volume of neglect
forcibly expressed

Devastate a silhouette, calm and serene
Abandon/ an systematic insane routine

Volume of neglect
forcibly expressed
Volume of neglect
forcibly expressed
Opposite in a sign to abide
When the future is ours to decide
We continue to watch and observe
Just to find out what purpose it serves
