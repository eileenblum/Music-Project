Battered frantic, dressed in tragedy
Reach the point where time caught up, why me?
Paths we chose, the sorrows we cause
It's all forgotten instantly as pain calls

Just a fracture
in the equation of designs
Self-destructure
drawing out life

Neutral unknown, a nervous calm
Answers tactically arranged--stalling time

Just a fracture
in the equation of designs
Self-destructure
drawing on life

Second chance.
