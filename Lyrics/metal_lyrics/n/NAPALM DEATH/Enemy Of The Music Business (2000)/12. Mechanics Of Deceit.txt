Cloaks of sickness/ keeping us sweet
Delusional blackness/ fictional madness
Visionary blackness/ traps are set
Revolving mind-doors/ conspiring our downfall

Which came first? The lies or deceit?
Why did the suffering cross the divide?
The dealer sold his soul/ to hide
And left us on the other side

The business lessons for which we burn
Desolate loops in which we turn
Saga of fools, a voyage of trust
No contracts bound

Gathering dust
Which came first? The secret or the crime?
Where does the loyalty cross the line?
The dealer sold his soul to hide
And left us on the other side

Tranquilize our denial
Vengeance is mine
Capitalize/ on regret
Kick aside what aspires
Vengeance is ours
Our defence won't expire

Eat the shit with a smile/ don't be frail
Our word is bound
Face the wall; fill the mould that we take
And break with our hands
Sign the line; it's your life
Don't be squeamish
Take the time, taste the sweat
Choke back your tongue

Mechanics, mechanics, mechanics of deceit
Glorified, butchered, bathed in malice

Sign the line; it's your life
Don't be squeamish
Take the time, taste the sweat
Choke back your tongue
at the shit with a smile, don't be frail

Our word is bound
Face the wall; fill the mould that we take
And break with our hands

Mechanics of deceit [x3]

Tranquilize our denial
Vengeance is mine
capitalize on regret
Kick aside what aspires
Vengeance is ours
Our defence won't expire--so beware!
