Abstinence works for me, not for them
Intolerance, far worse things? This makes no sense

Get high on me and mine
Take the poison

Raise a voice? The art of making noise
Attacking stance? Fist in face for personal
choice

So witless? self, self, self.
Take the poison

Two polluting lifestyle doctrines in defense
Re-assess the threats to well-being
Re-direct
And clear your heads

Dialogue (is a) powerful drug?
(not) verbal poison

Abstinence works for me, not for them.
Intolerance, far worse things? this makes no sense

Take the poison
