[Dead Kennedys cover]

Punk ain't no religious cult,
punk means thinking for yourself.
You ain't hardcore 'cause you spike your hair,
when a jock still lives inside your head.

Nazi punks,
Nazi punks,
Nazi punks,
Fuck off !

If you've come to fight, get outta here.
You ain't no better than the bouncers.
We ain't trying to be the police.
When you ape the cops, it ain't anarchy.

Nazi punks,
Nazi punks,
Nazi punks,
Fuck off !

Ten guys jump one, what a man !
You fight each other, the police state wins.
Stab your backs when you trash our halls.
Trash a bank if you've got real balls.

You still think swastikas look cool.
The real Nazis run your schools.
They're coaches, businessmen and cops.
In the real fourth Reich, you'll be the first to go.

Nazi punks,
Nazi punks,
Nazi punks,
Fuck off !

You'll be the first to go.
You'll be the first to go.
You'll be the first to go.
Unless you think.
