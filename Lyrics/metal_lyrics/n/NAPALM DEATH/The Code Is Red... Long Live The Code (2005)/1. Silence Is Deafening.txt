[Embury, Greenway]

Rant long and loud
Repeat 'til you're blue in the face
Ever get the feeling you're always on a losing streak?

Their silence is deafening
From the havens of thieves and kings

Empower those who serve to deflect suspicious minds
Action and answers as likely as a reversal of time

Their silence is deafening
From the retreats of tamed apologists
Their disdain is crippling
For those whose crises they have fixed

I am your "untermensch" - a trace of filth to be scraped off
A trace of filth to be scraped off

Yet when it's you who's in their debt
The strong-arm brings you to your knees
So much for "progressive authority"
A trace of filth to be scraped off

Power for the powerless - well, where?
Screaming at the wall to make more sense...

... I melt back into indifference

The silence is deafening
The silence is deafening
The silence is deafening
