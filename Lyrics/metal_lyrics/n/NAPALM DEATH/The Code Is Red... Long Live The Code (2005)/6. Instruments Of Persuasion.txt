[Mitch Harris/Greenway]

A farce - so sincere
A farce - so austere
A farce - hartfelt pleas
A farce - shock and awe to force a retreat

Ten thousand corpses in the wake of his whims
Count many thousands more on the way to obedience

Duty - to uphold
Duty - to make bold
Duty - purity so skewed
Duty - break out the arms, don't spare the rod.

Ten thousand corpses in the wake of his whims
Waves and flashes smiles, with the gall of an unmarked man

Instruments of persuasion
Instruments of persuasion
Instruments of persuasion

Rallying calls to the wilfully blinkered
Hands on the heart and heads in the sand

Instruments of persuasion
Instruments of persuasion

Stand shoulder-to-shoulder and win the bonanza.
A sweetener from death to get back in the good books

Instruments of persuasion
Instruments of persuasion
