[Mitch Harris, Embury / Greenway]

Red's the given color if you resist the will to hate

You're a bit part
Outliving your worth
Where do you stand in the Aryan pecking order?

We are "faggots", "Jews" and traitors
Because we resist the will to hate.

Here's supremacy: To rise above paranoia
Is is others who're diseased for dismissing your flawed criteria?

You've been sold short to a scam

Survival of the fittest?
How you seem expendable, vulnerable - a runt
Better keep your mouth shut
Should they find the quirks in your pureblood

You've been sold short to a scam

You can pin all slurs to me
But I'll choose humanity

You're a bit part
Outliving your worth
Where do you stand in your preciou pecking order?

You've been sold short to a scam
