[Embury, Greenway]

... And so it comes to pass

With a shrug of the shoulders
A washing of the hands

It was war through lies on demand

Work to live to fund their egos
With bombs and shaky claims

Make the cowboy killer's day
Take one life and your's will cease
He'll take thousands (in the) name of "peace"

Selective memory and distorted words
The methods of the untouchable

Struts away and dusts off his gun
To cast more net on his "axis of evil"

Make the cowboy killer's cay
Prays on all your lethargy
Knows you'll turn the other cheek
