[Mitch Harris / Greenway]

Excuses, excuses
Fabrications, smokescreens

Manacles - no recourse
Fabrications, smokescreens

Lower than the lowest
Lower than the lowest
Lower than the lowest

Maybe, just maybe, this New World Order
Is no concept for "freaks"

Straight, true, and divine
Straight, true, and divine
Straight, true, and divine

Maybe, just maybe, plans to rein us in
Have broken to the surface

Full fronal assault on your choice
(Your) choice to spurn the flag
Waves retribution awating those who dissent

Patriot - yes, it's an act
Fabrications, smokescreens

Speak when spoken to
Speak when spoken to
Speak when spoken to

Maybe, just maybe, you're an obstruction
Blocking their assets
