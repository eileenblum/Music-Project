[Mitch Harris / Greenway]

God can take his eyes off me
Love is there - it's mine and mine alone

This soul is strong
Our bodies our own
To use, explore with no roots in those laws

Don't class me as a wayward waste
Open your eyes and shake your bondage chains.

Decreed chastity has no basis
Geared to curtail our loving instincts

Family fucking values - I've heard it all before
Passionless fucking robots - it's how we will function

So pledge yourself to you (not forced)
Pledge yourself to you

No urge to procreate - no crime to stimulate
To stem the flow of love - a weary, bygone age

So pledge yourself to you (not forced)
Pledge yourself to you

Family fucking values
I've heard it all before
Passionless fucking robots
It's how we will function
