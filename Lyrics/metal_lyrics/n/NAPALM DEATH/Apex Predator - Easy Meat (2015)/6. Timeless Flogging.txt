History consigns the post
The frame that dislocates

Ah, yes, no angry stripes
on my back

Evidently I'm spared
I've been spared?

Excruciating instruments
can be dismantled
Excruciating instruments
can be dismantled across
my every waking moment
Dismantled via a time-stretched
crack of the whip

Physicality in short bursts
might be nullified
Physicality in short bursts
might be nullified, but repackaged
as grinding daily slog
Nullified amidst plastic folly peaks

This kingdom I can survey
One king of a strong-arm state
