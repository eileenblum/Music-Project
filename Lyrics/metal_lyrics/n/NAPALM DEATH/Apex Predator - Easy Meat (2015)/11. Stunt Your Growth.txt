Spread of seed
over many expanses
Cycles
It would grow regardless out
of these behemoth's clutches

Claimants to the last drop
Patents block the begging bowls
Owned to stunt your growth
Stunt your growth

Basic subsistence hinges around
this fundamental biology
Jaw-dropping concessions
to cabals viewing anything natural
as commodity

If this is what it's come to,
we can ration out the oxygen
We can rule on replication of
bodily expression
We can wholly stunt our growth

If this is where we're heading
this is the height of ludicrousness
We could count on ruination
whenever the wind blows
Strewn - and stealthily stunt
our growth

If we waive natural liberties,
the GMO literally consume
to control
