[B-Side Track]Vital organs of substance
Unified in social silence
Through mayhem and malice
Find the point of least resistance
The fracture is unquestionable
Disabling the sphere
Technology in its own infancy
Specifically adhered
And as the Earthwire centres in
Between the aftermath and second skin
Outside interference that stimulates our incoherence
Distinct frames of reference
To narrow down a choice of preference
The fracture is unquestionable
Inevitably steered
Technology in its own infancy to emphasize the fear
And as the Earthwire centres in
Between the aftermath and second skin
Nerve ending gateways to the grand design
Earthwire integrates the new lifeline
