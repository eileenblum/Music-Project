Crunch a number,
grinds your gears
Crunch a number,
root out a stiff
then tightly squeeze
Wretch after wretch

Non-expressive matter
designated to perish
Smash a single digit
Wretch follows wretch

Cleave to progress, rotate the cull
Cleave to progress, this ranks
lower than collateral
Louse after louse

Non-reflective minions
who must labour and perish
Smash a single digit
Louse follows louse

As there is no lower to plunge
No heed is paid to consequences
There's no sum when
you're not a part
