All you can eat,
on all you can feast
All that can be really
cheaply played
All a noise of nothing
but scheming
You are deftly swayed,
vigorously splayed

Metaphorically screw you

All you can eat,
on all you can feast
Tongue-lashed till you're
fucking swayed
There's a sea of impenetrable
jargon to submerge
those pauper's graves

If you please in triple-speak
- a clammy helping global hand
What it means in triple speak:
yanked down a yawning crevasse

All you can eat, on all you can feast,
you're crammed with triple-speak
Not a trickle through the floodgates
The dumping ground of fabled
inclusion can't dissuade
the deftly swayed

Based on need in triple speak
they've metaphorically screwed you
