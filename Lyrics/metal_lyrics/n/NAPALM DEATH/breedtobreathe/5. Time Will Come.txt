Pushed aside the feelings
jeopardising all.
Caught the chain reaction,
rolling with the fall.

Forget the friendship,
the points made loud and clear.
Where was the kinship
for which we endear?

Soulless execution -
mixing guilt with blame,
breaking point in contact -
No more vain demands.

Time will come.

Pleasing all to punish,
stepping up the race,
pulling all resources,
pushing up the stakes.

Time will come.

Growing from the sadness,
living day by day,
learning from the madness,
paying all the way.

Time will come.
