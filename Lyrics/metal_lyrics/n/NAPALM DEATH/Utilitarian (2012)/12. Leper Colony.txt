Depravity, feral traits
- line drawn in the dirt
Dense unconscious streams,
it seems - line drawn in the dirt
Our inconsistencies
in singling out the human

Line drawn in the dirt

Smack us senseless through a lens
- least for the lesser
Burden's fit for scabrous waifs
- least for the lesser
Let the unsophisticated go unheard.

Least for the lesser

Line drawn in the dirt
Least for the lesser

Sweep back to the recesses
of furthest thought
Recoil and blank out the atrocities
meted out

Disembodied, disenfranchised
- introverted understatements.

Relax in the sheltered neutrality
of furthest thought
As observers we trivialize the
cruelty meted out

Line drawn in the dirt
