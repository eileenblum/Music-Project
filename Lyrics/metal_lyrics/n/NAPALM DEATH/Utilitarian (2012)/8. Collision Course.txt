Our lives seem set
On a collision course
A history we cannot change
Or will not change
The years and happiness
Mean everything and nothing
If we cannot fit the final piece 
Into the puzzle

We have to strive to push
The boundaries further
We have to strive to push 
The boundaries further
Or all our lives are set
On a collision course

The stress is mounting,
We fail to breathe
What was important now
Seems pointless
Perhaps it's time 
To flip out world upside down
Embrace our lives
For all that they are worth

We have to broaden
Horizons of understanding
We have to broaden
Horizons of understanding
Or all our lives are set
On a collision course

Death will take us all in the end
Prepare for bitterness
But live it 'til the end

This world I can gladly leave behind

Profoundly naive,
Scrambling lost within
Searching for self-gratification
Anointing obsession
Disarming purity
Fracturing with poetic tragedy

Death will take us all in the end
Prepare for bitterness
But live it 'til the end
