Normal?
Run-of-the-mill?

Errors in the signals
(Off gender)
Errors in the signals
(Down-and-outer)

By the very shadow you cast
Clawing at the vapid pseudo-love
Called 'respect'

Errors in the signals
(No aberrations)
Errors in the signals
(Moral fail-safes)

Couldn't flee much quicker
From the adolescent (in you)
Clawing at the vapid pseudo-love
Called 'respect'

Errors in the signals
