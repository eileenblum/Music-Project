Quarantine isn't all it might seem
Drifting so, isn't this just a cinch?
Unhindered - always the option
To flee?

Shielded through happenstance
And cultural decree
Confined as they are
Let us thrive in relativity

Libertine
Snipe at will, digging deep
Malcontent
By approval you can be

Take a hammer to (stifling)
Traditions - don't treat carefully
Yes, we presume with no exceptions
- Freedom is for free

Quarantined, Quarantined
Quarantined, Quarantined
Quarantined, Quarantined
Quarantined, Quarantined

Surge with the mainstream
Temper your ire further afield
Surge with the mainstream
Tune out skulking shadows
Within the democratic,
Autocratic, theocratic

And sleepwalk through every
Damned systemic derivative.
Through every curtailed
Human prerogative

Quarantined, Quarantined,
Quarantined, Quarantined
Quarantined, Quarantined
Quarantined, Quarantined
