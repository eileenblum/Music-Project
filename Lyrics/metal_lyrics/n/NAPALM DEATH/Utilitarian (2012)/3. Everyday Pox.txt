Crack a wry smile
For the gravest of fortunes
You illuminate the room
Here - a toast with urine
To empathy

Too far removed
To indulge or divulge
Extend my hand
And your flesh crawls
Touched by asinine mongrels
You're rife with everyday pox

Suspect foreign bodies encroaching
On your space - they obstruct,
You detest, you obstruct,
They detest

Unwashed interferers multiplying
Out of range - They obstruct,
You detest, you obstruct,
They detest

Steady diet of hearsay
Rumour, primed yo up the fervour

Just rife with everyday pox

Ramming home prejudgements into
Every smirking face - air drainer
Trespasser 

Everyday Pox
