Analysis paralysis

If you are looking for the guilty ones
We only need to look in a mirror
Facing our reflections
we are scarred - scarred but immune

To our negative impact on others
We scream at the wall
and turn away from the advice
That might make us better men

We scream into the walls
It's analysis paralysis
We hide our heads in the sand
or run away
It's analysis paralysis

Analysis paralysis

Frowning on the positives
One mans meat
is another man's poison

Equations and discord
divide but never unite
Drowning in the negatives
Will we ever see
the wood for the trees?
Hating the truth, denying the hope
It might make us better man

We scream into the walls
It's analysis paralysis
We hide our heads in the sand
or run away
It's analysis paralysis

Thriving in the disarray
Our bridges burn in tribute
Wash away the ashes and failure
with the tears of understanding

Another epitaph
and an heir to wretchedness
