For the common good,
That glare so piercing
It will burn through your back
Reach, re-educate the soul
(Even though this is feigned)
because you need to be taken to task

Obscure my face
In shadows I'll consolidate
Unmasked, I'd be whipped into shape
In shadows, I'll consolidate

False alarmist
- They will brand it on your back
Or maniacal sadist,
When you are barely defence minded
Because you walk right out of step

Obscure my face
Effectively decapitate
Unbowed through
The smear campaign
Effectively decapitate

Effectively, socially,
Protectively decapitated

White-out in the blackout
So everybody's running scared
White-out in the blackout 
Rank and file and all upstanding
With selective downplaying
White-out in the blackout

White-out in the blackout
So the oft-duped
Are grossly impaired
White-out in the blackout
Startled, unsettled
Thus curiosity expelled
White-out in the blackout

Homogenous
- I'm surplus to this time
That's well contained
Sullied rat in basement trap
With vital exposÃ©

For your own protection
For the retardation...
