An alias, it's how I'm known
A sideshow to a great unknown,
My best side is the furthest from...me!

A nobody
In all my exertions
Eeking out an era

Undermined, Underling
I'm sub-standard without a name

A somebody
I'm since endowed
Clambering across the feeble

Unrivaled, unequaled
Peerless standards
around my name

Undermined, Underling
Kept behind so you would
thirst for prestige
Unrivaled, unequaled
Selected, refined
- stand and applaud
