[Bonus Track]Keep up, deadbeat
- a construct in ascent
Do not relent, in ascent,
do not relent
Statuesque
Or drop out, deadbeat
- hoarder in ascent
Do not descent, in ascent,
do not dissent
- Keep up, deadbeat

Into the monopoly, we wish you well

Is longevity all in the accessories?
Not content - is real prosperity
gauged materially?

Aim without an aim
Aim without an aim without an aim.
Aim without an aim

Spectacular transparency,
we wish you well

Live fast
- am i revolutionary
travelling at velocity?
Will prosperity lead
to your serenity?

Keep up, deadbeat

The facade comes to embody
all the thing you desire
All the details concise
All the things that comply

Drop out, deadbeat

The objects we attain come to
handicap adventurous desire
All the details align
All the riches comply

Aim without an aim
Aim without an aim without an aim.
Aim without an aim
