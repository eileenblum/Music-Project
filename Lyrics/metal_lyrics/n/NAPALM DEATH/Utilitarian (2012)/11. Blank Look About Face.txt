Confidante
Here goes a breach
of a piss-weak pact

Upright, On-point,
staunch subordinate
Blank look, about-face

Sycophant
Trade plaudits neat
and matter-of-fact

Flatter in a charismatic haze
Blank look, about-face
Elective confidante,
Adopted sycophant

Poised to sweep the cynics away
Blank look, about face

Clear the ground!

Clear the ground for a drunken
power melee

The mob is phased

Clear the ground for a weakening
sting the tail

The mob drinks in praise
The mob's wit wanes
The mob deflates
The mob's displaced
The mob's contained
