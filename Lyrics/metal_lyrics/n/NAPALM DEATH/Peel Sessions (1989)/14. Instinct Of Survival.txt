Advertise the product you make
Never give but always take
Kill and lie for security
Your shit on supermarket shelves to see

Instinct of survival

Advertise the product you make
Never give but always take
Clingfilmed flesh and genocide
A contented life while millions die

Instinct of survival

The multinational corporation
Makes its profit from the starving nation
Indigenous people become their slaves
From their births into their graves

The multinational corporation
Takes its profits from the starving nation
Another product for you to buy
You'll keep paying until you die
