[Music : Napalm Death]
[Lyrics: Nick Bullen, Justin Broadrick]

On your own again, trapped alive in your grave.
You're gonna die wasted, no way to be saved.

Private death, private death,
private death, you're dead again.
Private death, private death,
Private death, you're fucking dead.

No point in fighting, your life is already lost.
Try to escape: you're nailed to the cross.

Private death, private death,
private death, dead again.
Private death, private death,
Private death, you're fucking dead.
