[Music: Napalm Death]
[Lyrics: Nick Bullen, Justin Broadrick]

Take it out on others - that's what they do.
See what makes it work - that's what they do.
Feel my hatred surge - that's what they see.
AVENGE THEM

What Man can do - destroy, destroy.
What Man can do - destroy, destroy.
Destroy, destroy, destroy,
destroy virtually anything.

Pointless pleasure - my point in hate.
No point to a slow genocide.

What Man can do? Virtually anything.
What Man does is destroy virtually anything.
