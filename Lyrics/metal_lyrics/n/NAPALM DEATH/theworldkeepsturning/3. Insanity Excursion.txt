Dragged down deep in the shit,
an unemotional vacuum.
Fatigue replaces concious thought.
Awareness ends.
To carry a cross we cannot bear.
Falling hard without an end,
chaotic insight of times to come.
Pressuring insane demand.
The tightening noose of the consumers
might snaps in time.
To feed the fire or feel the flame.
Falling hard without an end,
chaotic insight of times to come.
Relentless and leaning,
no fair warning.
Falling hard.
Pushed against before we stand.
Chaotic insight, which way to turn?
