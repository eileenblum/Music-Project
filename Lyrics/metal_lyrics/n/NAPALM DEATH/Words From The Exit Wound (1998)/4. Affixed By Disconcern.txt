One nation under god;
see through the charade.
Deliberated fraud;
now it serves no purpose.

Prefabricated screams taken to extremes
to limit our dreams;
now they serve no purpose.

Increasingly pessimistic,
Conscience - you can't resist it.
A thought to coincide a lifetime supply...

Stimulate your curiosities,
expose yourself to generosity.

Mind control to what extend?
An astronomical event
to seperate beyond the hip.

Fail safe to make decisions.
Conceded premonitions.
Guilty we coincide a lifetime supply...
