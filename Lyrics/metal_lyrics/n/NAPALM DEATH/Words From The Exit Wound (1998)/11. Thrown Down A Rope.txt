Someone wants me dead
from the neck and upwards.
Rope weaved by these hands,
box of my toils.

Coerced - dazed by a suckerpunch.
Reeling - believing that these are the dues.

Pitch back - throwback to a chastised youth.
No quarter - stifled under a stich-up hood.

To be made an example
will stauch my deviant flow.

Held a lever that only I can pull.
Need a trauma to silence my loose tongue.

Bigots want my head
on a plate to sound-out.

Probing - exposing delicate core to full view.
Damning - programming etiquette to suit.

To dissect and reset
will staunch my deviant flow.

Held a lever that only I can pull.
Need a trauma to silence my loose tongue.
Group constrictor.
Throttling a bond.
Call a cull to silence our loose tongues.
