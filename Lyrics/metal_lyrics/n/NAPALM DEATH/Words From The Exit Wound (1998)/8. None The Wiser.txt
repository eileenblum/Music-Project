I'm impervious,
this subservience demeans a mental gait.

It' insensible,
just be digestible and tether down that rage.

No ignoramus (or) sufferer for art.
big windows smudged so play a part!

Since when did we discard perception as the years went flashing by?
Will characterless enigmas brake the degenerative slide?

Not in deep for a dress to impress,
won't go tired on vast space to defend.
Not in deep for a dress to impress,
won't go tired on vast space to defend.

If maturity wipes the slate carefree,
keep me infantile.
Major humane drop to the comfort zone.
Smooth earth now to ride.

Hereafter believable - legitimate.
A model of transparency - freeze up my gaps.

Since when did we discard perception as the years went flashing by?
Will characterless enigmas brake the degenerative slide?

Self-harming on the climb to my box.
The cancer's not eating -
others holes it has clogged.

Time is a climb
dragging your chains,
One-way parade.

Glued to the rail,
fixed on a tail.
Side-step barred.

Jump with no push,
not to devoid void
but aching places.
