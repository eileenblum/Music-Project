Spurned my own motives.
Can I vacate these premises?
Siphoned off,
Sealed my walls.

Strike a light then screw the vice.

Callouses that keep my peace - blemished blissfully,
torched off in a fiery sea,
defiled first degree.

Searching flames darkens embrace.

And lost crimes laid raw and bare,
guarded eyes with intruded glare.

Incendiary incoming

Picking out thoughts like carrion,
cannot put the finger on.
Un-brotherly love sears
worse than those unknown.

Shards of spite cut lines of sight.

And lost crimes laid raw and bare,
guarded eyes with intruded glare.

Incendiary incoming
