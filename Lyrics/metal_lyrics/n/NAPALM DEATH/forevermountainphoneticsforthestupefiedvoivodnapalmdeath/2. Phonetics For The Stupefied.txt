[performed by Napalm Death]Torrential flow where anything rolls (from the tongue)
Addled - it's so verbose
Shrill then sickly then so verbose
A self-advancing spout that's so verbose

Grating, reverberating

Stupefied, but everything's hurting
Addled - this wretched blurting
Strafe a simple point - this wretched blurting
Pile on guttural disconnects - this wretched blurting

Coruscating, reverberating

Phonetics for the stupefied
Phonetics for the stupefied

Glaringly a ploy, can't you hear?
Withering pitch, technicolour drawl
If only laughingly dismissed

Shit-mouthed

Pronounced as if emancipation's getting near
From larynx to brain, subjugated only further as you speak

To the stupefied
