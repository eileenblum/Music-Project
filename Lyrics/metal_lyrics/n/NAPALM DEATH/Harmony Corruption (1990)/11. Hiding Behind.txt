[Lyrics Greenway - Music Harris, Mick]

Search for purityi leads to insecurity
Individuality an incapability

Trapped within outside theories

Ideals adopted, agreeable on basis
Yet to question aspects a cardinal sin

Should self expression mean social loss of face
Labelled unaware because you beg to differ

Hiding behind a shroud of belief
Staunchly involved, highly confused

Confidence in your firmly lodged thoughts
Yet take a back seat while others speak for you

Should every single thinking moment
be saturated with political stance

Striving for perfection
Fear of group rejection
Better to be at mental ease
Than harbouring thoughts not mutually agreed

The spoken mind and reasons why
Dictation by others be denied without fail
