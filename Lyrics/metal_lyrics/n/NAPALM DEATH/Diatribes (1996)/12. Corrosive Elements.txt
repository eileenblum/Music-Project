[Music: Harris, Embury; lyrics: Greenway]

Staying on an even keel.
Keeping a gauge.
Sanity hags in the balance.
I could go either way.

Celberal half life.
The darkest summer days.
My pressure defences melting away.

'Cause I can't level this brimming, seething dread.
My pressure defences melting away.

With anxiety I'm burning! [x4]

Stripping down to the core. [x4]

Corrosive elements, corrosive elements inducing.
Corrosive elements, corrosive elements that sap being.
Corrosive elements, corrosive elements inducing.
Corrosive elements, corrosive elements that sap being.

Corrosive elements - joy toxin.
Corrosive elements - please cleanse me!
Corrosive elements - joy toxin.
Corrosive elements - please cleanse me! [x5]
