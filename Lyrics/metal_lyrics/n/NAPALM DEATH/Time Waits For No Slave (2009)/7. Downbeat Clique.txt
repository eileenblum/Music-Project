For independence we alone define
Open-ended, not monopolised, it's just as it is.

Does not need overstatement
Don't broadcast it from the rooftops
It's we alone that convene

But radical actor there you are
The radical statesman picking holes
But radical actor there you are
The radical stateman's checklist of faults

But radical actor there you are
In radical terms this target's soft
But radical actor there you are
In radical terms it's power to your lost soul

But radical actor there you are
The radical heights of alienating
To be a cut above - or below.

Infighting starts to establish
A clearly marked distance because image is at stake

Mindlessly stifling, downbeat clique
Down-at-heel, downbeat clique

Infighting starts to establish
A clearly marked distance because image is at stake

Pitifully sniping, downbeat clique
Re-branded morality, downbeat clique.

Exactly what are YOU achieving?

The faithful patron of one conclusion
With reflection, effects are null and void,
It's just as it is

But radical actor there you are
The radical statesman picking holes
But radical actor there you are
In radical terms it's power to your lost soul.

But radical actor there you are,
The radical slip into social structure,
And your threatening alliance with the norm.
