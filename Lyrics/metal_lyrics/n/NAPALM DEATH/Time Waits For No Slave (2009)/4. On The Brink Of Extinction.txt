Born between chaos and hatred - a lottery of fate
We sit on the brink of extinction
The world lies in wait
Just a scratch on the surface
Of time that will wash away
We delude ourselves with the notion
That we are here to stay

As life starts to shrink
An impending state of neurosis
Will we awake from this negligent narcosis?

On the brink, the brink of extinction
We're on the brink, the brink of extinction

Locked together in a mindless campaign
It's only now we see
Appreciation is the one redemption
For all that lives and breathes
Like a virus it's conscious - impure
We have farmed disease
It's time now to step back
And find an inner peace

As life starts to shrink
An impending state of neurosis
Will we awake from this negligent narcosis?

On the brink, the brink of extinction
We're on the brink, the brink of extinction

Will we avoid a natural selection?
Do we have the right to survive the failures?
Nature, its force - the scales unbalanced
What's the next step? How do we evolve?

Can we avoid a natural selection?
Do we have the right to survive the failures?
Nature, its force - the scales unbalanced
What's the next step? What can we resolve?
