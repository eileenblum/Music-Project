Push the envelope further from reality
Banishing the hope, interrogating strategies
Inhumane aggression, isolation jails
Forcing a confession when all else fails

To stand in judgement of a so-called offender
That represents immortal behaviour

Push the envelope from the civilised norm
Push the envelope, catastrophic storm
Stripped of life and limb by this torture germ
Stripped of life and limb just for standing firm

Naked and bound, pain and consideration
Extremely profound, grotesque cooperation
Cruelly implied, no sense of divide
Particular intensity, deception and lies

To stand in judgement of a so-called offender
That represents immortal behaviour

Government task force questioning the source
Widespread abuse
Innocent victims of power misuse

Push the envelope from the civilised norm
Push the envelope, catastrophic storm
Stripped of life and limb by this torture germ
Stripped of life and limb just for standing firm

Psychological intimidation
Traditional methods of interrogation
Polluting our culture, it's prolific, outright
For nothing more than specific insight

A dire killing thrust
To satisfy the lust
When beaten to their death
Lingering aftermath
