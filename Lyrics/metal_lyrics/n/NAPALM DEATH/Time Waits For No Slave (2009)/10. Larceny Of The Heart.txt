Now that the time has passed,
We look back in angst at the past
Now that the dust has cleared,
The ugly head of fear has reared

Was there ever a guiding truth -
A light to silence the cries?
Suspicion is building a case to coutner-attack the lies

Now that time has moved on,
Can we look to the future with hope?
Now that the dawn has returned,
Forget not the sense of pain
Is the world still a masquerade - a deja vu of trauma?
Hidden plans and corrupt ideals
Molest the true spirit to live

We cannot fight what we cannot see
Larceny of the heart
We can't take back
What we didn't know was taken
Larceny of the heart

Now that the time has passed,
We look back in angst at the past
Now that the dust has cleared,
The ugly head of fear has reared
Now that time has moved on,
Can we look to the future with hope?
Now that the dawn has returned,
Forget not the sense of pain

We cannot fight what we cannot see
Larceny of the heart, we can't take back
What we didn't know was taken
Larceny of the heart

Stripped to the nerve we obey
A shadow empire lies in wait
Stripped to the nerve we obey
The pounding pulse of deceit

We cannot fight what we cannot see
Larceny of the heart
We can't take back
What we didn't know was taken
Larceny of the heart
