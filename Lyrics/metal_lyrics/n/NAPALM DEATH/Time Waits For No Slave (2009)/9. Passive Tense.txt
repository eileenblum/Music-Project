Overbearing drive to break loose,
But not to inflict any wounding
Back-breaking social codes
I'm hurtling toward apoplexy

"Conduct inappropriate!"
Cry misappropriating know-alls
Conduct inappropriate!

Institutional oafs break loose
Care to neutralise us human germs
Guidelines they so staunchly espouse
Adjustable once they are exposed

"Lifestyles disproportionate!"
Cry misappropriating know-alls
Lifestyles disproportionate!

Verbal diarrhoea
Virtuous fawning makes my flesh crawl
Are you some God, King and Sage?

Superfluous slurs
Resent, interject, intercept and molest
Superfluous slurs
Entrap, double back
They collapse and entrance
Superfluous slurs.
