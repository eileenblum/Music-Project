Played out, wide off the mark
Genie develops
Skin to fiction
More then in a world of fact

My own worst enemy
My own worst enemy
Lifes feel treachery
My own worst enemy

Dams of emotion build
A dull and turbid scream
Cloudlike veils of black
In fungles of hopes oppressed

[repeat chorus]

So many times,
For no reason
So many promised punches
For what reason?

Ceaseless decay
Parallel obscene and flagreaf
Ceaseless decay
Restrained my mind cells

So many times,
For no reason
So many promised punches
For what reason?

Ceaseless decay
Parallel obscene and flagreaf
Ceaseless decay
Restrained my mind cells

[repeat verses 3 4]
[repeat verse 1 and chorus]
