Without own fate people scorching burns

Turned to back trails the wrong visor waste most by terror
Without the world come treat to would that borsch 
Scorned in withed of trots
The wrong visor severed from all senses 

You're rein no reason

Coming flame from twisting and chop the chosen
Termed me you're be injection of bacon ways

Save us! Don't make fights passing in that lies
Filled brake ways you're nothing pulsate
Save us! The wrong visor, common visor!
