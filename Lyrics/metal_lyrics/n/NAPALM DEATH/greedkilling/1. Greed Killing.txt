The wrong time, the wrong place
Our smiling face of distrust
Buried, the sand deep in all our hands
Prepared ourselves for the fall

The greed killing!

Instinct to mistrust
Instinct - the lust
Their butchery of feelings
Geared for the greed killing

The greed killing!

Not now, then when?
Not now, then when?
When? [x4]

The lust denies the need [x5]

Existence is the steady flow,
The moulded image grows
No care, no faith in what you are
The pressure builds right from the start

Could it be just sour grapes?
Or have we failed to fit their shape?
It's always give, and never take
How much more can we give?
How much more can we take?
