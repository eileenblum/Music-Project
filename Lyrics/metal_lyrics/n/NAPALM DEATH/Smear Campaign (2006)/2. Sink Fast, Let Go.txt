[Music: Harris, Lyrics: Greenway]

As always, the will and desire
Passed off as a fault of the unlearned

Sink fast, let go

To live this, but not to subscribe (to God)
Means we can halt our own rapid decline

Sink fast, let go

No product of an almighty here
Cast in no creators image
Trust in our own complexities
To exit, not degenerate

What joy to linger
Sink fast, let go
At behest of the appointed
Sink fast, let go
Dregs for the appointed

No product of an almighty here
Life's not precious at its fringes
He didn't help you though trials and tribulations
So you can't bar the exit door

Scream out for shutdown
Sink fast, let go
At behest of the appointed
Sink fast, let go
Cling for the appointed
Dregs for the appointed

Life pushes major choices
And this is the most informed
We do as we please

When all we finally possess
Is the shadow of our former self
We do as we please
