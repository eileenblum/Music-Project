[Music: Embury, Lyrics: Greenway]

Cheated the way from fringe to elite
Clique of stylists
Rounded illogic skipping a beat
To a dead cert

Dry-heaving charges and bursting the abscess
With a forked tongue
Bloated with courage
And spewing with cloying self-importance

Drop your targets
Aim sights lower
Leave unblemished those with real power

Smear Campaign

Stroke two faces
Nests to feather
Leave unblemished those with real power

A thousand cuts
Beat yourself proud
Leave unblemished those with real power
