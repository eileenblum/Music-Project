[Music: Embury, Lyrics: Greenway]

In and out of boxes
And herded into packs
Get swept away on a current to mediocrity

Forcing pleasure visually, not offending their ears -
How tedious
Maximum restriction, Minimum enlightenment -
How tedious

Approval to be worthwhile
Toiling to make the grade
Don't relax on a wide view
Seek pardon toward the grave

In and out of boxes
And herded into packs
Get swept away on a current of inadequacy

Swallowing what's 'right' and 'wrong'
Grasping the unproven rule -
How tedious

Approval to be worthwhile
Toiling to make the grade
Don't relax on a wide view
Seek pardon toward the grave
Living to actually live
Mercy without faith's weight
I'll relax on a wide view
No apologies toward my grave

Drudgery prevails on the checklist of faith
So little time given moral restraints
Cut loose the sinners who can barely be named
Drudgery prevails on the checklist of faith
