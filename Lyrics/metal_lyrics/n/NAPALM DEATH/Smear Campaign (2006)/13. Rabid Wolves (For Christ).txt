[Music: Embury, Lyrics: Greenway]

Believing is deceiving
The Earth is to be scorched
Doctrines crushed underfoot -
The very doctrines that perpetuate your cult

Archaic ways that would take the place
Are just an inverted spin on the regimented code
Divisive and regressive from the harmony of all

Must shoulder the fallen
The weak are not mere fodder
And that's what's called free-thinking -
Distanced from ALL Gods
