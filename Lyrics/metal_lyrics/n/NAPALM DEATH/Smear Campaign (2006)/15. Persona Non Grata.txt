[Music: Embury, Lyrics: Greenway]

Trodden down like shit underfoot
Be the downside to others upsides
Last one to the table - just starve

You'll get what you're given

This is set in stone from the ivory towers
Perception above all -
When you're face down in the dirt

Irreversibly persona non grata -
A figure off ill distinction
Persona non grata -
The place for blame diversion

No matter the plaudits I earn
The whoring and scoring for points
To strive to be superficial
I'll live by your status

This is knowing your place beneath the ivory towers
Not a going concern
But a lowly beast of burden
