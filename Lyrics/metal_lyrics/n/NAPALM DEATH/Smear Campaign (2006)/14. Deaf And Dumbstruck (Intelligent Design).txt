[Music: Harris, Lyrics: Greenway]

Roll out a yarn incessantly
Tracing the thread to where?
Deaf and dumbstruck -
Plugging up holes with dead air

Gone deaf and dumbstruck
More piety to dumbfound us

When they can't wave the head of the prophet
Natural life needs some spin
Deaf and dumbstruck -
Inanimate myth gets an in

Gone deaf and dumbstruck
More piety to distract us
Deaf and dumbstruck

Try to walk with some proof before you can run
On all the conjecture embraced with aplomb

Come enthrall us

Miracle workers - these false orators
Set back life itself with fairytale laws

Come enthrall us
