[Music: Harris, Lyrics: Greenway]

Ethically aligned to the cause -
Or so I thought
A cause that decried the exploits
Where masses are coerced

Often, social justice is a cynical smokescreen
Only at their bidding

Close-circuit reach - don't overstep my boundaries
Such boundaries that crumble under order

Sincerely you serve your own ends -
Do as I do
I can't tell my left from my right -
Corruption blurs

Face the wrong direction
And we risk containment
Whilst they sanction murder

Close-circuit reach quickly erases all travesties
Such travesties waved away with feeble ease

It's adjudged to be uncivil
You should be at a lower reach
Bound over
Because open thinking is an act of complicity

Leaders are leading by example
'Rights' and 'wrongs' on a sliding scale
Sit atop the order of importance
You too can reap the power harvest

The 'deviant' young get in the way
We become suitably distraught
Whilst their judges take lives near and afar
And reap the power harvest
