[Music: Harris, Lyrics: Greenway]

Mandated since none of them knew
How to transcend moral codes that are presumed

Unthinkable?
Inconceivable?
Cower in a corner and keep the heresy stowed

Freedom is the wage of sin

No universal (theoretical) force of influence
Should dictate behaviour that we can't handle ourselves

Freedom is the wage of sin

Permission - the abdication of our self-determination

Think... think for a minute
Of centuries of perpetuating
Bloodshed, deception, oppression

Think... think for a minute
Of centuries of subjugating
Martyrs superstitions

The evidence is damning and conclusive -
That intervention
Is not advancing or easing hardships
Still we're strangely so duty-bound
