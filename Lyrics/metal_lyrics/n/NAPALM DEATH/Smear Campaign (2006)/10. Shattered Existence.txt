[Music: Embury, Lyrics: Embury]

Chained and shackled, besieged with mistrust
Life a handout that pushes its luck
Betrayal a virus that hides in us all
Buried deep down where integrity has drowned

Oppression ruled by bloodshed
Is this the feeling of a shattered existence?

Bound and gagged, no value or use
Unjust enforcers policing the truth
Visceral dictatorship stripped to the nerve
Designs of entrapment that fake its concern

Oppression ruled by bloodshed
Is this the feeling of a shattered existence?
Punished or purified - who has the answers?
Deliver us from a shattered existence

Morality poured down the drain
Sickened from the germs of our atrocities
Chameleon serpents breed in the corruption

Ground down in squalor
Their negative bacteria thrives on the innocent
Cancerous corporate elite

Instincts of fear awakening our resistance
Marauding hordes
