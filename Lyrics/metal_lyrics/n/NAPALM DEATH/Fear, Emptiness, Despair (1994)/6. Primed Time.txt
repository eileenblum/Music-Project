I've walked to the ends of the earth, and glanced into the eyes of
those who were going the opposite way.
They failed to bridge the gap, first contact was a threat and you
could taste the surging unrest.

Who wrote the law that opposites attract?
Who could be so naive?
Everyone trusts no-one.

Looking out for number one.
Ours is a primed time.

The finite thrill of the loathing - a streak in our life bearing
dreams.
It strengthens to soothe the open wound, but ours is a primed time.

It strengthens to soothe the open wound, but ours is a primed time.

Bonding? - Do you think I want the upper hand?
Broken contracts, we sow infertile seeds and reparation pales.
