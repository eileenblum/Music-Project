A chronic complaint of dimness
Prevails your profound ideology
A romantic vision of a "master race"
Attained through coercive forms of authority

Your observance is negligence
If you see the threat from different cultures
We're all in this sinking ship
All of us together

Where does the white man stand?
Where does the black man stand?
Where do we all fucking stand?

KNEE DEEP IN THE SHIT!

Look into yourself
And you'll find the real oppressor
To a life of unchallenged hate
It's you who's the nigger!
