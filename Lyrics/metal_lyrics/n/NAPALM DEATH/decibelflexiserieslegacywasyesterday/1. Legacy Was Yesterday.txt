[Music: Embury / Lyrics: Embury / Greenway]

Sealed maze of confusion
The mind is perplexed
Faith in the life you choose
A stake in being yourself
Who else can you be?
What else can you be?
True to yourself and forge ahead
And deal with the fucking consequences

By turns we are bemused
We will be stretched taut and ordered
Give a thousand apologies
Trying to work through the guilt
Lashed down to this legacy that was yesterday
Old friend, youâre reviving the pettiness of all the worst memories

From minefield of childhood
to melting pot of frailty
Didn't we grow up?
Or did we just grow apart?
Always looking back - why be so afraid?
Be True to yourself and forge ahead

By turns we are bemused
We will be stretched taut and ordered
Give a thousand apologies
Trying to work through the guilt
Tripping through this legacy that was yesterday
Old friend, youâre reviving the pettiness of all the worst memories
Persisting in this legacy that was yesterday
