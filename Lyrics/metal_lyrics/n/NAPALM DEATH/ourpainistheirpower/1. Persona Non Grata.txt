Like shit, like shit, like shit

Trodden down like shit underfoot
Like shit, be the downside to others upsides
Like shit, last one to the table, just starve
Like shit, you'll get what you're given
You'll get what you're given

This is set in stone from the ivory towers
Perception above all
When you're face down in the dirt

Irreversibly persona non grata
A figure off ill distinction
Persona non grata
The place for blame diversion

No matter the plaudits I earn
Like shit, the whoring and scoring for points
Like shit, to strive to be superficial
Like shit, I'll live by your status
I'll live by your status

This is knowing your place
Beneath the ivory towers
Not a growing concern
But a lowly beast of burden

Irreversibly persona non grata
A figure off ill distinction
Persona non grata
The place for blame diversion

Like shit
