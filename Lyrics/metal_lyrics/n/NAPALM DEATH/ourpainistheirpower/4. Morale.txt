Odds are stacked with hooks to catch
The creeping doubt that strains the cracks

Morale â blitzed â morale
Culled â morale
Morale

Invite the plague to hasten the conversion
Or piss upon the incorrputible
Deny a way in

Morale â sheared â morale
Drained â morale
Morale

The pasage of the scapegoat
In acceptance
An endgame from a platform
A mortal wounding

Morale
