I'm an empty, vain shell
Detached and stricken
Bereft of richness from your faith

Restrain this runt
Neutralise this runt
Behead this runt amid pillars of salt

Knives out and poised
The balanced fall - consumed
And onto their own blades

Restrain this runt
Neutralise this runt
Behead this runt amid pillars of salt

Disabled in limbo
Enabled if I stand down
And fall onto my own blade
