Wayside's again my lonely brink
While my distant ships to insignificance must sink
Travelling well leaves no trace to see
The keeper needs neither lock nor key

Once I had fully known, the sleeping truth in memories overgrown
Still weak and soft, but strong in tone, the waters flow and grind the stones

Five colours make me go blind!
Five heads circling around my mind!
Then she appeared with shaking ground, a phantom black - a devouring cloud

Lady giant tall as mountain, fell-minded walks the land for the death of men
Lady giant tall as mountain, fell-minded walks the land for the woe of men

Showing me her valley soon
Where her eye is the sun - her heart is the moon

Lady giant tall as mountain, fell-minded walks the land for the death of men
Lady giant tall as mountain, fell-minded walks the land for the woe of men
