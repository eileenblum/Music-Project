Step outside when three moons change
And your horizons turning strange
A crimson lady will be joining thee
To lead you into mystery

A widow black lies in wait
In her cobweb that is silver made
The lady takes you to willows'end
And the harpenists play is close at hand

"Come to my fathomless pond
Through the pearly curtain see
Hear my notes from far beyond
I'll drown thy woe and comfort thee"

He sits on olden stone
To welcome you at home
And with its weaving chords
The water tells with hollow words

"Come to my fathomless pond
Where it is so gently cool
Hear my notes from far beyond
Pick the rose and I will rule!"
