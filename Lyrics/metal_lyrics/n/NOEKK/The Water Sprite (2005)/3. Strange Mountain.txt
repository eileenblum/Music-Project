I'm searching for things forlorn,
I'm marooned and sneaking along life's forest.
Water sings over ageless rocks,
The air is dump and within me.
I can hear the leafs whispering!

But where are the clouds,
My constellations have changed.
No signpost to walk for!

I'm wearing limbs of stone and wide yawning valleys,
While the sun moves on and the fading light paints distant echoes of life...
