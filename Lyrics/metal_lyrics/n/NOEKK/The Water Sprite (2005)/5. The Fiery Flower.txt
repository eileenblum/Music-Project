In the deep forest by a yearnings side
Is a flower growing in the still of the night.
Moonlit night with her would blend - if you break her:
Your life must end!

And the lonely night sky does his moonshine send,
To caress that flower in no-mans-land.
Moonlit night with her would blend - if your break her:
Your life must end!
