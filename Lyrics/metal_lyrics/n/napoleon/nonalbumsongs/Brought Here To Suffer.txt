I wish I had wrote down everything I ever wanted to say
I can't remember a time where I haven't been this scared
I am questioning everything
What has led me here
I am stood here on the outside
On the outside looking in
Listening to you has to be the biggest mistake I have made
Come on now lets be honest
You never cared for me

Living on the outside is not such a bad place to be
I cut my ties long ago

[Chorus:]
Don't control the innocence
Just drop the script and run
Where did the good people go
Stay with me, Stay with me
I need you all to realise
This is wrong
I won't just stand back and let you tell me that this is the way that this is, this is the way it's supposed to be

Corrupted by power
Dominated by greed
You are the hand that feeds
Just let us breath
Just let us breath

[Chorus:]
Don't control the innocence
Just drop the script and run
Where did the good people go
Stay with me, Stay with me
I need you all to realise
This is wrong
I won't just stand back and let you tell me that this is the way that this is, this is the way it's supposed to be

I wish I saw this coming long ago
I can't live this way
Things will never be the same
Do yourselves a favour
Forget everything you know
The strings bind you now
You are not your own
I won't just stand back and let you tell me that this is the way that this is, this is the way it's supposed to be
