Take a look around,
Does this look familiar,
Was this really where we crossed paths,
All was fair in love and war,
The here and now has its flaws,

Build, Re-build,

This is not what our forefathers expected from us,
They left a legacy,
Their words of truth,
They've turned their backs now,
And so have you,
This is a dynasty,
We must see this through,

This Process, Build, Re-build,
Repeat Process, Build, Re-build,
What have you done,
What have you done,
Must we start again,

We were martyrs,
With a sense of price,
Building structures,
All brought down with our demise,
What have you done,
What have you done,
Can't you see,
We've done wrong,

Have some respect,
This is our home,
I can not believe,
That this means nothing to you,

This Process, Build, Re-build,
Repeat Process, Build, Re-build,
What have you done,
What have you done,
Must we start again,

End process now,
End process now,
End process now,
End process now,

We've robbed,
Of all dignity,
Something they've earnt,
That we carelessly,
Lost,
We've been robbed,
We've been robbed,
We've got ourselves to blame
