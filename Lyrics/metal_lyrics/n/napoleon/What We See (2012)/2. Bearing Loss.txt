Let them fight alone
Itâs too late
The second hand
The fear of the unknown
Something has to give
Something has got to give
To go our separate ways
To lead ourselves to the darkness
This is how it feels
This is how it feels

When we younger
Living life for a time
Never for we be the maker
These times for living, living the life
Little did we know time was passing us by
(Passing us by)
(Passing us by)

Grab hold of the torches
And call off the search
(Calling off the search)
Follow your senses
Youâll be alright
Itâs always alright
Share us the truth
Itâs always alright
Tell us the good

These things between us
Is tinkering in time to fight
Between the reality of my dreams
And the dreams a reality
And the realization
We weren't the same
(Passing us by)
(Passing us by)

Grab hold of the torches
And call off the search
Calling off the search
Follow your senses
Youâll be alright
(Itâs always alright)
Share us the truth
Itâs always alright

Weâve blown all our chances
Left the shore; it missed us both
(Weâve blown all our chances)
(Left the shore; it missed us both)
Weâve blown all our chances
The only thing I know was that we had a shot
That we had our shot
But I got the best of us
