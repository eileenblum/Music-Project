The sand slipping through his hands,
One broken shell of a man we once knew,
His wrong choice clouded our futures,
Forgive him father,
He did what he thought was right,

The thoughts of a man in a world that he thought,
Was his own, answers to no one,
Lives by his own rules,
Just look at the mess you got yourself in too,

There is nothing left to choose from,
Thereâs no hope in hell,
Weâre staring at a loss,
Weâre living on borrowed time,
I will not bow, I will not give in,

Call yourself one of us,
You are the last friend I can trust,
Looking back on the things that youâve done,
You didnât care,
You never truly loved,
And now oceans between us,
Youâll float away on a pitiless course for one,
And when the clock stops,
And you need our help,
In the time you have left, you can only blame yourself,

Going somewhere,
You look like youâve seen a ghost,
The truth hurts,
When the lies arenât true,

There is nothing left to choose from,
Thereâs no hope in hell,
Weâre staring at a loss,
Weâre living on borrowed time,
I will not bow, I will not give in,

Donât ever come back,

Donât ever come back,

You are not so well connected,
If the buck donât stop,
We can never climb this fence,

You are not so well connected,
If the buck donât stop,
We can never climb this fence,

I forgive, I shall never forget,
Childhood memoryâs lost,
I can only ever, look back,

Ever look back,

I can only look back,

I can only look back,

I know the ones I need.
