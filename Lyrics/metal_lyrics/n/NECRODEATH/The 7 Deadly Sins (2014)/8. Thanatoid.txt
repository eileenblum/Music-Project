I hear the voices around me
Burning the regions of mind
The thoughts are growling together
I gaze at the walls of frustration
Bewitching my last sanity
Sadistic death takes my fear of death

Thanatoid

My chance to arrest this torment
Is vanished by passing of time
I get confused in a austral disease
The deadly complex is pounding
And twisting the walls of my heart
My mind is crossing up the threshold
I die

Thanatoid

Nerves on edge, paranoia's near
Explain the growing sorrow years by years
I see my victims turning from the ways of the past
They release my days of disgust

Senses, searching for life
Conceiving breath after breath
Drastic measure to recharge my brain
I watch in splendour at the mass

Old dreams, (of) paranormal life
Psychoneuroses deny
Seeds of anguish, unfold their roots
Inhaled desire, I want to pass away
Stop my human waste
