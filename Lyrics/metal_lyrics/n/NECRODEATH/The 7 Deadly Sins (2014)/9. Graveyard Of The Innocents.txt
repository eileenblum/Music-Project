Holding child in the lap of death
No feeling the touch of life
Denied pleasure, enormous sin
Sanctify your strife
Alive
In limbo
Chanting priest victimizes souls
Glorifying his useless God
The open ground receives the corpse
Earth purifies my blood
Nefastus stench of rotten bones
Footsteps on the earth I lie
Morbid hands will sign my grave
Torment, immaculate

New born's death
Slaves their mind
No return
In limbo I die

They enter my domain with lust
Relentless much on holy ground
Blackest candles burn my soul
Violence, trespass


New born's death
Slaves their mind
No return
In limbo I die I stand at the gates of limbo

Entering, I walk
Innocent blood I lost
Men on earth torment my ghost
Nothing I command
Deranged is my mind
Falling to the sand
Cannot open my eyes

My tablet has changed (Sign!)
Signed with morbid
Colours (Sign!)
Death rules my veins

Trapped in this dimension
I've never known my soul
Now I feel the dead they call
I see decayed face
Appears from his lie
Feel the burning grace
Cannot open my eyes
