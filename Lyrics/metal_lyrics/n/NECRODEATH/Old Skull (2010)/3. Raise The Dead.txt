[Originally by Bathory]

"Dust to dust"...
I gasp for air
I scream for sight
and fight against
torment and dread
Calling the vengeance
I tear at the lid
and promise to raise
from the dead

RAISE THE DEAD (RAISE THE DEAD RAISE THE DEAD)

Black witch of beauty
all hell's necromancers
give me the powers of hell
Mistress of curse
reapers and vultures
Demons stand up
and chime the bell

RAISE THE DEAD (RAISE THE DEAD RAISE THE DEAD)

Suddenly powers comes
from within
Muscles and mind are
filled with wrath
I burst out in frenzy
powers of hell
and break up the
tomb and the dark

RAISE THE DEAD (RAISE THE DEAD RAISE THE DEAD)
