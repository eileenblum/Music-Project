Inferno's book symbol of blasphemy and fear
Unveils the still upbraided sign of death
Mothers unite as one in shape of evil itself
Darkness, tears and breathes

MATER TENEBRARUM

Vision of inverted, fallen destiny in sight
The slave of hers inside of me
Jezebels scream for your defeat by smell of vault
Sacrifice your eyes to see

MATER TENEBRARUM

"BELLUM, MORTEM, CRUDELITATES
SUBTILES ET IMMENSA FEREMUS,
INQUIETAE SUMUS ET INSATIABILES,
ODII SATURAE, SUBIECTAE ANIMI IMPETIS,
FASTIDIUM, INVIDIA, DISCIDIUM, INTER NOS, SACERDOTES
SATANAS STANT."

Fires, devils, from the depth of horror
Mothers demand the orgies of blood
Threw your lighted candles to the ground
Blest be the man that spares these sounds
Dance, around the pale
Uprising chalice holds my veins
Obnoxious mind, cursed souls
Desire of death, praying' to meet ghouls
Mothers, contend the reign
The Antagonist, claims God's domain
They will break they will twist
They will burn they'll destroy
