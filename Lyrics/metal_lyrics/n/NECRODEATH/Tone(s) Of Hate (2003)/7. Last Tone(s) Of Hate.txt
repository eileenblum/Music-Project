[Lyrics: Flegias - Peso, Music: Peso]

Raping The Souls Of Unlucky Monks
Against The Bodies Of Innocent Peasants

Lucifer

Looking For The Terrible Secret
Silent Annihilator, Here To Kill Again

Last Tone(s) Of Hate, Last Tone(s) Of Pain
Last Tone(s) Of Hate, Last Tone(s) Of Pain

His Anger Fell Down On Soldiers Of God
And Still Today The Evil Stain Is Visible

Lucifer

Looking For The Terrible Secret
Silent Annihilator, Here To Kill Again

Last Tone(s) Of Hate, Last Tone(s) Of Pain
Last Tone(s) Of Hate, Last Tone(s) Of Pain
Last Tone(s) Of Hate, Last Tone(s) Of Pain
Last Tone(s) Of Hate, Last Tone(s) Of...

Phosphore Redde Diem Quid Gaudia Nostra Morarir
Phosphore Redde Diem Quid Gaudia Nostra Morarir

Lucedio Come Buried Into The Macabre Silence
And Monks Lie Mummified To Watch The Surgery

Silent Annihilator, Here To Kill Again

Last Tone(s) Of Hate, Last Tone(s) Of Pain
Last Tone(s) Of Hate, Last Tone(s) Of Pain
Last Tone(s) Of Hate, Last Tone(s) Of Pain
Last Tone(s) Of Hate, Last Tone(s) Of Pain
