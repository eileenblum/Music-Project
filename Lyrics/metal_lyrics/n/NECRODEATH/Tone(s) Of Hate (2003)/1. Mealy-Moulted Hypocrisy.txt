[Lyrics: Peso - Flegias - Angela, Music: Peso - Claudio]

Choose The Silence
Nec Superi Vellent
Choose The Silence
Hoc Licuisse Sibi

Released To Kill Again
Released To Rape Again

Dirty Beast Implores Redemption From Your Sins
Sinner Animates Hide Beyond The Cross
I Don't Want To Hear Your Disgusting Words
Sinner, Animates Hide Beyond The Cross

Released To Kill Again
Released To Rape Again
Released To Kill Again
Released To Rape Again

While The American Church Is Denouncing The Scandal
And The Vatican Is Exposing The Apologies,
Greedy People Abusing Of Children
"We Have Ministries Of Church Taking Advantage On Kids,
No Chances To Declaim Against Them, It's A Road With No Way Out"

Ne Mea Sint
Ne Mea Sint

Mealy-Moulted Hypocrisy
Everything We Know Never Will Be Payed
Mealy-Moulted Hypocrisy
A Hidden Reality Beyond The Cross

Malignitati Falsa Species
Libertatis Inest

Mealy-Moulted Hypocrisy
Everything We Know Never Will Be Payed

Released To Kill Again
Released To Rape Again
Released To Kill Again
Released To Rape Again
