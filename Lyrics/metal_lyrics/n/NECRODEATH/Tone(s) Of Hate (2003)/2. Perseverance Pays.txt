My Home Is
A Top Security Prison
I Will Never Be Released
My Home Is
A Top Security Prison
I Will Never Be Released

Perseverance Pays
Perseverance Pays
Perseverance Pays
Perseverance Pays

My Home Is
A Top Security Prison
I Will Never Be Released
My Home Is
A Top Security Prison
I Will Never Be Released

Perseverance Pays
Perseverance Pays
Perseverance Pays
Perseverance Pays

From The Files Of Murders

Only Death Can Release Me
And I Will Wait For It
Only Death Can Release Me
And I Will Wait For It

As Patiently As I Can
As Patiently As I Can

A Life Beyond The Cage
A Life Beyond The Cage
A Life Beyond The Cage
A Life Beyond The Cage

Missing
And Feared Dead
Missing
And Feared Dead

A Life Beyond The Cage
A Life Beyond The Cage
A Life Beyond The Cage
A Life Beyond The Cage

Missing
And Feared Dead
Missing
And Feared Dead

My Home Is
A Top Security Prison
I Will Never Be Released

Perseverance Pays
Perseverance Pays
Perseverance Pays
Perseverance Pays
