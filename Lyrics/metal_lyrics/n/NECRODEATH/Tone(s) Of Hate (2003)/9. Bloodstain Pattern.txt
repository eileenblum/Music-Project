On Her Back Motionless
Drowning In A Bloodbath

Affiving Home On That Fucking Bloody Wednesday Night
About Five Minutes Past Eight O' Clock

Bloodstain Pattern

On Her Back Motionless
Drowning In A Bloodbath

To Discover That His Honeymoon Had Ended
In A Lurid Tragic Story Of Murder

Bloodstain Pattern
Bloodstain Pattern
Bloodstain Pattern
Blood...

Shocked Moments Of Discovery
Hypnotised By The Signs
Throttled Into Unconsciousness
And Then Stabbed

They Should Be Able To Prove Scientifically
Who The Killer Is From Handkerchief Bloodstains
Molested And Raped Horror, Terror And Lust
Rejected And Refused Horror, Terror And Lust

Forensic Science Crime Detection
An Insatiable Sex Urge Caused The Beastly Assault
Rejected And Refused Horror, Terror And Lust
Forensic Science Crime Detection
Forensic Science Crime Detection
Forensic Science Crime Detection

Bloodstain Pattern

Shocked Moments Of Discovery
Hypnotised By The Signs
Throttled Into Unconsciousness
And Then Stabbed
