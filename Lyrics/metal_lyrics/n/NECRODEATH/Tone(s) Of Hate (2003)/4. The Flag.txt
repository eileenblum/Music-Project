[Lyrics: Ingo, Music: Claudio]

Pray With The Creeping Chaos
Denying The Holy Cross
Istantaneous Demon Is Released By The Force
Satan Orders All Of Us
In The Pentagram Of Blood
Defeat The Priest Of Lies And Attack The Place Of God

Rise... The Flag

Belial At My Fucking Side
You Pray The Unblessed Grave
Symbolical Dimension Places My Body Rots Away
Biblical Verdict Of Heaven
Accept The Words Of Hell
Sign Your Desperation To The Sudden Death In Spell

Rise... The Flag Of The Inverted Cross

Pray, The Altar In Mist
The Soul Of Christ Denies The Beast
Summon The Force That Regrets My Domain
To Find That Someone Will Pay
Asceding From Emptiness
Evil Strikes For Me
Unveil Your Satan's Flag
Calling, Inside Your Head

Antichrist, Debris Of Flesh
Death Rips You Apart
Annihilation, Victims Of Pain
Serve Your Necrolust
Evil One Comes On The Wings Of Hell
The Death Of Christ Is Obtained
Defiled Crosses On The Altar Of Hades
Unleash Your Disgust Today

Yog - Sothoth
Hee - L' Geb
F' Ai - Throdog
Sabaoth

Flag Of The Inverted Cross
Waves Down In Hell
Resurrection Is Not Unveiled
Lunatic, Demoniac Spell
Back The Soldiers To Re-Twist Your Soul
Feel Death That Creeps Inside Of You
Endless Torment, Inflicted Pain To See
Defeated Priest Vomits Witches Brew

Yog - Sothoth
Hee - L' Geb
F' Ai - Throdog
Sabaoth

Dungeon Of Eternal Horror
Indulge Desire And Lust
Sacrifice By Satanism
Evil Nature Of Disgust

... Sabaoth ...
