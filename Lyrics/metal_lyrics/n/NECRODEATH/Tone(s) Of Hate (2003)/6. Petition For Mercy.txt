[Lyrics &amp; Music: Peso]

Brothers Appear To Have Been
The Dupes Of An Artful Woman
Execution Arrived
Implicated In The Crime
While She Escapes Justice
Execution Arrived

Seven Months Of Fear

Each Of Them Delivered A Paper
Whitch Declared Their Innocence
Execution Arrived

Seven Months Of Hope

Clemency Has Been Denied
Clemency Has Been Denied
Petition For Mercy

The Fear - The Hope - The End

They Were Hanged Together
And Were Long Remembered
Execution Arrived

Sevent Months Of Fear

Clemency Has Been Denied
Clemency Has Been Denied
Petition For Mercy

The Fear - The Hope - The End
The Fear - The Hope - The End

For Half A Minute They Stayed Entwined In Death
As They Had Been Before Birth
And Their Hands Remained Locked Together

The Fear - The End
Petition For Mercy
The Fear - The End
Petition For Mercy
