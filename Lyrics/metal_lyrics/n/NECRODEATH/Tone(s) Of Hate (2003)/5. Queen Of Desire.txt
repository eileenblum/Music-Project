[Lyrics &amp; Music: Peso]

An Only Child
Orphaned At Eight
Accomplished Coquette
Countless Men
Enjoyed Her Company
Insane Lover

I'm Caroline Rudd
Queen Of Desire
I'm Caroline Rudd
Mistress Of Lies, Lies, Lies

Unscrupulous Woman
Great Personal Charm
Insane Lover

I'm Caroline Rudd
Queen Of Desire
I'm Caroline Rudd
Ambitious, Malicious And Sexually Precocious

She Killed The Twins - She
She Killed The Twins - She
Killed The Twins
Killed The Twins

Gaudia Non Remanent
Sed Fugitiva Volant

Husbands And Lovers
Gowns And Jewellery
Troubles And Debts
Protesting Her Innocence
They Hanged In Pain
Insane Lover

I'm Caroline Rudd
Queen Of Desire
I'm Caroline Rudd
Mistress Of Lies
I'm Caroline Rudd
Queen Of Desire
I'm Caroline Rudd
Ambitious, Malicious And Sexually Precocious

She Killed The Twins - She
She Killed The Twins - She
Killed The Twins
Killed The Twins

Queen Of Desire
