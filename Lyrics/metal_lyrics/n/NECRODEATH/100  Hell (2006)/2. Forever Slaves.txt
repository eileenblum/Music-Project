Extremely â inhumane â conditions
Practice of slavery dates from ancient times
Behind the punishment of life
Close to the real suffering
We still remain Forever slaves
Extremely â "super-comfort" â conditions
There are more slaves today than yesterday
Behind the illusion of progress
Close to the unreal emancipation
We still remain Forever slaves
You are a slave for everyone
Segregated in this world since your birth
Tied up by invisible chains
You'll die enslaved in your own prison
Break the chains of your bondage!
Forever slaves
