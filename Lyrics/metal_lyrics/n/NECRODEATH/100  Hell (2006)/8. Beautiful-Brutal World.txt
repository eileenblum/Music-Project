In a world which seems to become more violent
And bloodier each day
Where most of the population
Is working hard just to survive
Local news stations compete with each other
To show the most sensational crime
Violation is glorified as exciting
Intriguing even desirable
Beautiful â beautiful â beautiful brutal world
When we can replace the cheap trills of violence
With the excitement of creativity
Maybe then things will start
To get really interesting
Television, papers and all kind of media
Fight against to sell more cynicism
Violation is glorified as exciting
Intriguing even desirable
Brutal â brutal â brutal beautiful world
Every day
Every night
Someone else wanna die?
Turn off the radio!!!!!
Without shame
Without decency
Without mercy
Without remorse
Beautiful â brutal â brutal world
Beautiful â brutal â beautiful world
