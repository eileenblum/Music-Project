Walking for steep paths
Regardless of the obscene mutation
Inebriated by sickness
Repulsion and horror
Torments of the intellect
Paralysis of the mind's states
Catharsis of the unconscious
Repulsion and horror
Risen from reality
Getting out from the tunnel
Of bestiality
Repulsion and horror
Nightmares in my mind
Bodies massacred
Necrophiliac embraces
The pleasure of death
Death
Death
I proceed to the unknown
With open arms
Blazes don't graze me
Repulsion and horror
In league with
You my master
Screams don't stop
My journey to hell
Hell
Hell
The circle is closed
Also the terrestrial life
Here's the destination
Of my wander
I invoke you
My great spirit
Show me the way
And your brightness
Hand me the burning sword
Forged by your demons
And let me start
My journey
Death
Death
I invoke you
My great spirit
Show me the way
And your brightness
Hell
Hell
Per me si va ne l'etterno dolore
Per me si va tra la perduta gente
In the name of evil
In the name of sacrifice
Or discendiam qua giÃ¹ nel cieco mondo
Misericordia e giustizia li sdegna
In the name of evil
In the name of sacrifice
Quivi si piangon li spietati danni
Morte per forza e ferute dogliose
In the name of evil
In the name of sacrifice
Barbatos
Arimon
Agares
Marbas
Aiperos
Abigar
Nuberus
Buer

DEFUNCTAQUE CORPORA VITA
MAGNANIMUM HEROUM
IDEO SECONDUM QUOD GRAVIORIBUS
PECCATIS IRRETIUNTUR DAMNATI
AT ME TUM PRIMUM SAEVUS

EGO DIXI IN DIMIDIO DIERUM MEORUM
VADAM AD PORTAS INFERI!!!!!

100% hell
