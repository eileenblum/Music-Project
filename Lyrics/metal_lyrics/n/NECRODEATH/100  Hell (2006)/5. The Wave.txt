The Ocean chooses to arrive
Coming without warning
Devastation
Destruction is brutal and indiscriminate
Suddenly the water from the sea rises up
And chaos erupts
Inundation
Destruction is brutal and indiscriminate
This is the wave's long reach
Dead exceed 250.000
And many missing people
Annihilation
Destruction is brutal and indiscriminate
This is the wave's long reach
Quake-spawned waves sweep all in their path
Washing..... lives away
Swimming with the death
Flying without hope
Chaos erupts
This is the wave's long reach
