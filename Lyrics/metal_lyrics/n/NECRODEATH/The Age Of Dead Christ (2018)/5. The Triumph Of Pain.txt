Looking through your darkness
Living without hope
Denying all humanity
Permanent damage
Negativity, decrepitude
Debilitation and disease
Permanent damage

Behind your smile
Behind your eyes
The silence talks
Illusion, delusion, confusion
Here to rise
The triumph of pain

Persecuted by an adverse fate
Chase the dream of your life
Hiding in a universe
Where there's no way out

Fear, anger, sadness, agony
