For so many years
My story was theorized
In vain they have narrated
Truth instead betrayed
The pleasure of the blood
The atrocity of my deeds
Always enchanted you
I'm the dream of the dark side

I'm the slayer, the maniac rapist
The maker blade
Of the corpses of Whitechapel

Six feet under I cannot
Tell you anything
May my spectral thought
Reach a mind
Listen to my voice
Mother of the dead
And tell who I am
The master of mayhem

I'm the slayer, the maniac rapist
The maker blade
Of the corpses of Whitechapel

None of your theories
Corresponds to reality.
I'm one of you,
A perfect stranger,
The ideal neighbour,
The husband, your friend

Voice of the dead reveals
My face, my life
He might conceal near you
The new murderer
No theory, no trauma
Just the pleasure
Of taking souls away
