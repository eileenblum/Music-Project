For the Black Goat
The Goat of Mendes
The Order rises

In honor of the fertility of the ground
For knowledge and for freedom
I create and seal the black disease
Spreading into this world
Fight and steal, rape and sodomize
Observe and follow the true light

I ask loudly to reverse
The order of things
My point of view
Is black or white
Satanic dancers
Floating around me
Creating circles
In honor of the King

The sky shines
In the day of the undead
The sabbath calls all the real men
In the center stands a black shadow
Claiming his throne
Commanding from the first row

DEUS SATANAS EST FONS VERITATIS ABSOLUTUM
MIHI IN ROBORE TUO AEDIFICARE ALTARE

For the Black Goat
The Goat of Mendes
The Order rises
In honor of the fertility of the ground
For knowledge and for freedom

VERUM
SERVUS
MALEDICTI SUNT
CONFIDELIS
THE ORDER OF BAPHOMET!
