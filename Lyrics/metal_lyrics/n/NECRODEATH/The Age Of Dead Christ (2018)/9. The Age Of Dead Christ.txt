Judas betrayed Christ to the chide priest
For thirty pieces of silver
Judas betrayed Christ to the chide priest
In the garden of Gethsemane
Fu crocifisso per noi sotto Ponzio Pilato
MorÃ¬ e fu sepolto
Il terzo giorno Ã¨ resuiscitato
Secondo le scritture
E' salito al cielo
Siede alla destra del padre

The apostles spread Jesus' word
And few years later
Carnages in God's name began

People killed and tortured
Jesus betrayed with a kiss
People killed and tortured
Jesus nailed to the cross
People killed and tortured
Jesus the son of God
People killed and tortured
Father, into your hands I commit my spirit
