In country of Essex, -sex, -sex
As in today's world
False accusations rage
Control is lost

And the media massacre begins
Envy is the fuse
The egocentricity
Gunpowder

Hundred forty-four are the suspects
Hundred forty-four condemned to death

You are the scum
You are the witch
You are hysterical
You are the whore of Salem

Gossip and frustration
The seed of doubt
The farce trial extends
With the court of the pigs

Judges are coming
Prophets sent by the law
The priests of disgust
And the clerical slaves

Burn in hell
Damned infector
Snuff it in agony
Twisted in remorse

You are the scum
You are the witch
You are hysterical
You are the whore of Salem

Like today in front of the screen
They're all ready to judge
Crowned by themselves
With no life to live

The deception continues
At Salem as in the net
No justice for witches
Only the certainty of the punishment

Hundred forty-four are the suspects
Hundred forty-four condemned to death

Burn in hell
Damned infector
Snuff it in agony
Twisted in remorse

Hundred forty-four are the suspects
Hundred forty-four condemned to death

You are the scum
You are the witch
You are hysterical
You are the whore of Salem
