The defending litany of drums rises
Blasphemous hymns of dark gods
The universe graveyard is in chaos
Ancient giants bend on his return

The Messenger of the Gods unfolds his wings

Priests speak language of crows
The harlot flutes are heard
From the inconceivable rooms

He is the one
He is life
He is death

He is the one
He's back
From the crypt of Nyarlathotep

The unnameable will come back on earth
The prophet of darkness has risen
His flight on the world
Spread nightmare
Peoples submit
The the Great Ancients era

The Messenger of the Gods unfolds his wings

Deformed serpents are coming out from his mouth
And chilling quills form the unwatchable body

The cross between a toad and a dragon
No time between the past and the shadows
The black menhir enthroned on the meadow
Romantic screams announce the tornado

Light is just a memory darkness dominates
Great are its screams that annihilate

The creeping Chaos madness still reigns
Raising splendid altars to the crypt of Nyarlathotep
