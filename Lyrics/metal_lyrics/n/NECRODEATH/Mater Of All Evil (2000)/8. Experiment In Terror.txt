Violence has its price and I'll pay 'til you die
In your blood I will see the revenge of my life
Get up early if you are another man's life or money
The sleeping wolf will seldom make a kill or a warrior, win lying down
Violence has its price and I'll pay 'til you die
In your screams I'll satisfy the revenge for your crimes
Get up early...
Into the room I line up the blades I dominate
Now you will see what I can do to your bloody face
I move the hand I cut the air this is your end
I choose the best irrational experiment
Get up early...
Into the room panic around you pain just arrives
Terror in your eyes you wonder why you see my smile
You see the wolf you loose the sense now you can die
I choose the best irrational experiment
Get up early...
