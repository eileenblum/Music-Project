It has been sleeping for centuries and centuries
In R'LYEH it resides forced by sleep
By them who want to reject the eternal obscurity
And they want to fight the human race
Human destiny is graven it will arise
It will fight the ancient master and will tear the human souls!
Earth will meet the night when sunrise will be dark
YOG-SOTHOTH knows the seven gates
When stars will be faded and moon will never shine
Everything from deep will burn through a bleeding sky
Human destiny...
The creature re-appears from darkness
They will come back and the gates will be opened
It has been...
Human destiny...
