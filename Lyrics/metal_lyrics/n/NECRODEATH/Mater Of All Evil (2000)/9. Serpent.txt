He wants to bring you in the threshold of his door
He wants to show you the ancient secret of magic art
He is the viscid demon that will change your life
Terrible keeper with inexepressible face
The serpent master of infernal abysses full of light, he expects
The fruit of shame that they'll give you is forbidden
Honour and glory to the original sin
Temptations of a future that nobody knows
Terrible keeper with inexepressible face
The serpent...
ET MORTUS EST DEI FILIUS PRORSUS CREDIBILE EST QUIA 
INEPTUM EST ET SEPULTUS RESURREXIT
CERTUM EST QUIA IMPOSSIBILE EST Lucifer is his name
I am the serpent and I listen only to myself 
I am the serpent and without laws I live
