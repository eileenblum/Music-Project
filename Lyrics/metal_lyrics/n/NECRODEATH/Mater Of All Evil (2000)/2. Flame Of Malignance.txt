An archaic atmosphere surrounds me like flaming snakes in Lilith's womb
Three candles mark their inner boundary and the night creatures stop their charts
I gather the winds, I rend the clouds
The evil nature has arrived under the kindly glance of the moon
Your serpent eyes control the faded pages custodians of unforgotten words
I bring storms, I unchain flames
Flame of malignance nature of disgust
Flame of malignace burn in the dust
An avid hand are preparing the circle protected by the supreme flame
The shining pentagram is burning now and your malignance will arise
I gather...
Flame of...
PHNGLUI MGLWNAFH, CTHULHU R'LYEH, WGAHNAGAL FTHAN
The shining...
I bring...
Flame of...
