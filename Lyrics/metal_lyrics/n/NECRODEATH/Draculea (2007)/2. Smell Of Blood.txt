Chemical floods your joints
Adrenaline burst through your system
Pushing you
Run away
Fell the iron sharp aroma
In the forest of the impaled
Sharp - distinctive - primitive - instinctive
Smell of blood
See the dark red plasma
Across the enemy skin
Sharp - distinctive - primitive - instinctive
Smell of blood
Eradication - strangulation - amputation - castration - mutilation - bowdlerization
I wanna feel the taste of your fear
I wanna feel the pain of your soul
Fight - fight - fight
This is the way of war
This is the way of war
This is the way of war
Smell of blood
Die into battle
