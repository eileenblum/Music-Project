"Do you want to be without cares
Lacking nothing in this life?"
Vagrants and beggars responded positively
No one survived
The burning of the sick and poor
He issued an invitation to come to Tirgoviste
And after the guests ate and drank
He ordered the hall boarded up and set on fire
No one survived
The burning of the sick and poor
Welcome to my reign - no more poor in my realm
Welcome in my reign and enjoy the night
None of them escaped the flames
No one survived
The burning of the sick and poor
Welcome to my reign - no more poor in my realm
Welcome in my reign and enjoy the night
Vagrants and beggars responded positively
No one survived
He ordered the hall boarded up and set on fire
No one survived
Blood - party in Trigoviste
Screams - party in Trigoviste
Pain - party in Trigoviste
Death - party in Trigoviste
