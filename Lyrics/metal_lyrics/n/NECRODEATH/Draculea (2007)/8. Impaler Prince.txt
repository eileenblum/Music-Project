Vlad then began his killing realm 6 years long of hate and revenge
During which he committed tortures and cruelties warfares and bloodbath
And revenge and hence established his controversed reputation hate and revenge
I'm the prince of the darkness I'm the devil Vlad Tepes
Beware insane desires his name becomes famous and infamous in the blood
Bodies impaled as an art master in the tortures
The torture must be slow and painful
He scared his enemy by the sign of 20000 impaled Turkish prisoners outside the city of Tirgoviste
This gruesome sight is remembered as "The forest of the impaled"
Maniac and psycho, ruthless and paranoid he often order people to be
Skinned-boiled-blinded strangled-handed-decapitated
Crazy and schizo, pitiless and perverted he often order people to be
Burned-roasted-hacked-nailed-stabbed-buried alive
Kaziglu bey the impaler prince he also like to cut noses ears genitals and limbs
Arms feet fingers and eyes the impaler prince
The torture must be slow and painful I want your blood I want your life
Beware-insane desires
