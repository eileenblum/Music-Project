Back to a world that belonged to me
Where my youth was stolen by facts
Watching my past and tasting my present
And closed in myself I dream of my future

In the tunnel of time
Nothing has changed and nothing will change
In the tunnel...

I see the place where I used to play
I see the place where I'm walking now
I see the place where I'm gonna die
I see the places of all my life

Time never dies
Walking by a way without end
Time never dies
Rain will not delete what I left behind

Memories reality and dreams...

I would live all my life again again in a cycle that has no end...

Tunnel of time would take me back to the roots of my life
Same feeling, same thoughts, same spaces, same visions

That was the final stage!
