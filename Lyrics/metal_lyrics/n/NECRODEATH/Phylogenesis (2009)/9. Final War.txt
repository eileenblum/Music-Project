You will see the arch-merchant
That's for me it's another infant
And forget the devious gap
The screams overlap

Cathodic hypnosis brain necrosis
Final war

Open the gates open your eyes
Scourge sacrifices in the name of lies
Open the doors open your mind
Intoxicated by the new liar

Give me the force forevermore
Final war

Moments of sublime induced sodomy
Sacrifices in the name of catholic whore
Final war

Defacement of the infant lamb
Disguised as laid mothers
The final war

Mesmerised by purple light
Redundant frezy of ephemeral amazement
Final war

Ancient law has been forgotten
Your pride fallen and rotten

Metamorphosis of the brain autonomy
Inebriated by the new liar
Smell of non-human burnt flesh
From delirious rectangle
