Gory evidence of an entertainer's death
Along with the remains
Of several rare horses
Animals which appear to have been

Sacrificed as well

Were found in the ruins
Of a building at a site called Tell Brak
Which was once the ancient
City of Nagar

Sacrificed as well

2000 years before Christ

They enter the room of pain
Bizarre sacrificial ceremony
Kind of ritualistic performance
That culminated in death by beheading

Sacrificed as well

2000 years before Jesus Christ

Propitiation of the Gods

Centuries of gore
Countless wandering souls
Thousands of victims
In the name of the Gods

For the elitist crowd, they performed
Their most precious tricks, wonderful show
Perfection of moves
Aesthetic, symmetric, ecstatic

They enter the room of pain
They enter the sacrificial room

Propitiation of the Gods
