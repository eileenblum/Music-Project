I was sure of what I was doing but did not expect that end...

What I saw was unmentionable in a tunnel of surreal pictures and horrid inhuman sounds...

I feel something changed the normal course of my thoughts...
I feel I shouldn't have done that...

I had cracked up, schizophrenic, lunatic, mentally sick, insane, monster...

Extreme emotional shock
Odd dimension, where am I?
Extreme emotional shock
Odd dimension, what do I do?

Falling down into catalepsy, dreaming all about life
Falling down into catalepsy, dreaming all about death

I was him
He was me
