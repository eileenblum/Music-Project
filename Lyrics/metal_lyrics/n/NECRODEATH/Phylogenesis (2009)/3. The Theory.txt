They have come from the outer space
From the above they have arrived

Fertile working ground, bizarre atmosphere
even after the primary extermination
Evolution's neverending

This is the theory of the primate-man
This is the theory of the new generation
This is the theory of the primate-man
This is the theory of civilization

They have crossed unheard distances
From another galaxy they have arrived

Willing to achieve an objective
The right one, the chosen one... It's time to act!
Evolution never stops

Biological mutation, clockwork evolutionary mechanism
Mutating organic material in a new life!

Life springing forth with the right chemistry, dawn of a new era...

Unearthly massive control
The primate has been chosen
Earth is our laboratory
Monitoring cell activity
Inject DNA
Intervention concluded
Experiment succeeded
Evolution starting now
