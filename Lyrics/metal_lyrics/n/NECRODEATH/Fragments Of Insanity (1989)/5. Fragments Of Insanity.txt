Art form of the butchers, forgotten tales of death
Flashback of dementia, fearing myself
Poetic infliction, fix your body to the core
Skinned alive, as terror grows

[Chorus]
Smell decay of sorrow
Infinite to follow
Neurocranial terror
Celebrate my horror

Pseudoexophoria, irrational psycho reflex
Extreme desire, forgotten itself
Behind progression, breath my death through the air
Aroused by carcass, I found it there

[Chorus]

Hollow laughter, childhood cries
And when I turn, in rhyme with silence found my crimes
Wound in a coil - inborn to myself
Absurd vision-caress again
Love and life means nothing to me
Fragments of fear, of my sanity

Fragments of insanity
Far beyond
My last friend
Neuronophagy

Burst illusion, madness fry
How do I feel, 'n now intake a dream survive
Look to the dance - of my lunacy
Matters forming - 'n plagues all of me
My confessions - neurosis die
Psycho catharsis of my genocide

Fragments of insanity
To recipe my mind
Rise - the ovation
Feel to die
