To the void - your minds disappear
Last inner corpses denied
Dream in blood - scleromeninx feel
Scorn in sight - the victim tears

[Chorus]
Death's claws (of) denial prepare
Fear corrodes your smelling flesh

Clinic death - your procreation's dying
Blood's cyophoria reject
Mother's torment - suicidal will
Still untouched - by those who kill

[Chorus]

Screams of anguish, approach your face
Blood drops flowing behind
You wake up lying, through cries and pain
Fear will take your life
Torment - your sight disappear
My last dream's fading to death
Time pass slowly for the insane mind
How can you relieve yourself?

It's a fight of bodies that still dominates
Misery reflects in your tears
Innocence is turning my deranged fate
Consciousness is burning - stillbirth!!!

[Repeat 3rd verse]
