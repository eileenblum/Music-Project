Enclosed into my cage to satisfy emotions
Many times had passed a process to erosion
Descending to the cellar my bride "death" tolls the hour
Face your brutal fellow, it's time for no tomorrow

[Chorus]
Future! - Summons image of life
For the past! - I spread the wings of dying
... and choose your death

Torment of the lash, looses the ties of  blood
Sweetest dream realized, my deals front your God
Repulsions of conception, psychoactive evolution
I gain your last dishonour, burst the sound of sorrow

[Chorus]
Chosen victims, call suicide
My dimensions, commence to arise
Killing by shears, fills my body
Trim your out limbs, nailed down your feelings to mine

Once I had to return
Echoes of deception
Worms creep slowly along corpses left
Cold spread my evolution
Let my existence fries
Blood is mixing tears
Still the silence reduce my breath
The rage rebounds in fear

Choose your death! [X 3]
