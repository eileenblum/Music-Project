Darkness wrap my locus
Modifying my cells
Fast suicide
Haunts from the birth
Implant myself in death
Atrophic arts my feel
Psycho syndrome
Cerebroidal will

[chorus]
Masochism, praise myself
Draining of my own life
Tasting blood in convulsion state
Somatic injury to die

Necroctomy on my body
Autophagy's before
Limbs removal
And bathe in blood
Traumatism is pleasure
Neurotic spasms dead
Cerebrospinal
Outside my back

[chorus]
Playground of torment
Suffice my need to kill
Electro surgery
Psychophiliac's will

Fragile soul - ignored by peace
Effective search for pain
Furious breath - smell abuse
Self - punishment to gain
Points of dying - reach the top
As penetrance diminished
Scorching days surround me
Massacring to finish

[2nd chorus]
Tensile pains
Aroused together
Ceratoid eyes gaze
Aberrant stomach
Lymphatic vessels fried
Get torn forever
Recto dermal tumour
Works up to climax

Body's relief - the brain commands
Demented urge to die
Dried is blood . harms to dust
My aftermath demised
Reach beyond - to shift inside
And decadence frenetic
Deformed corpse remainder
Forgotten an atrophic

[2nd chorus]
