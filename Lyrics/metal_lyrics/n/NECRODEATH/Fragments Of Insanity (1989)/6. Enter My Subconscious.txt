Faces! - of death - closed souls appear
Brain's falling' - emotion points to hell
Mothers of death - living upon my bed
While the timeless sand I cross - the end is birth

Focus lens directed to fear
Alone I'm weeping last sadful tears

[Chorus]
Enter - the elders of death
My subconscious - smell my emanations
Enter - collide to the earth
My subconscious - nefarious emotions
Enter - the spirit commands
My subconscious - dephased to fear
Enter - somewhere they are...
... process to pleasure... again and again

Dancing! - On deathlike child of fire
Mercy killing - formation erodes in pleasure
Decoding the end - methods upsurge my head
Now the turning tide's above - the eyes of all

Focus lens directed to fear
Alone I'm weeping last sadful tears

[Chorus]

Dreams in rhyme with the nightmares
Behind the others morn
Sectors of madness
And oceanic falls
Shocking dreams of elusion
My bitterness is here
Sun rays on desolation
Anecdotes are real

Reminds old days of the fire
Behold the potency past
Tightness of pleasure
In transparent dust
Spontaneous worlds evolution
To ecstasy's eye
Chemical reign of deception
My kingdom of ice
