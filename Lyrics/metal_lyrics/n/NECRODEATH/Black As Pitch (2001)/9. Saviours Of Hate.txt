I feel the resurrection
Another morbid reincarnation Souls back in new life
Ghostriders without time

[sub-chorus:]
We are the saviours

I hear a black procession
Blazing creatures on the horizon
walkin' fast in new life
Ghostriders without time

[sub-chorus:]
We are the saviours

Death of life it's just the beginning
Death of life it's just the beginning

Reflected light coming over the shining edge
Into the deeper temple of the saviours of hate

[Chorus:]
Ghost of darkness rise from hell
Ghost of darkness rise from hell

Now a deadly silence decorates the way

[Chorus:]
Ghost of darkness rise from hell
Ghost of darkness rise from hell
Ghost of darkness rise from hell
Ghost of darkness rise from hell

[sub-chorus:]
We are the saviours
