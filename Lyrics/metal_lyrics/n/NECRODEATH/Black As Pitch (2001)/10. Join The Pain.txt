Acrid smell of burned candles on her naked skin (murderous glare)
Black impenetrable eyes unavoidable truths (murderous glare)
Astonishment and tears agonizing in passion (murderous glare)
Primal look of fear no one could hear... (murderous glare)

Motions denied! Ready to die?
Motions denied! Ready to die?

[Chorus:]
Join the pain - Join the pain

Back into darkness turned away in in disgust (murderous glare)
Despair and luxury way with no return (murderous glare)
Claustrophobic chastening attractive and passionate (murderous glare)
Eyes filled with terror but blind with pleasure (murderous glare)

Motions denied! Ready to die?
Motions denied! Ready to die?

[Chorus:]
Join the pain - Join the pain
Join the pain - Join the pain
Join the pain

Humiliated and confused
Screams and blood
Humiliated and confused
Screams and blood

[Chorus:]
Join the pain - Join the pain
Join the pain - Join the pain
Join the pain
