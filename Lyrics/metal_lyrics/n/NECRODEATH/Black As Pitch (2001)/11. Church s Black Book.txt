Dark sky began growing pale
From above counting the victims
Mass immolation extermination
Holy slaughter in the name of church

Church's black book - Glory turns into shame

Thousand of innocent massacred
From the army of god without remorse
Morbid violence inexplicable rage
Holy slaughter in the name of church

Church's black book - Glory turns into shame

"Nel queror  infernas quamis cito
Rapta sub umbras
Non potui fato
Nobiliori mori"

Dark sky began growing pale
From above counting the victims
Mass immolation extermination
Holy slaughter in the name of church

Church's black book
Church's black book
