Coming from that circle reflecting new light
With his sinister mind a new messiah arrives
Self-glorification in black euphoria and lust
Unaccustomed luxury a new messiah arrives

I'm the one who will open the gates
I'm the one who will save your soul

Don't trust the words of Jesus Christ
Another place in your life
All kind of pleasures all kind of vice
I burn and deny the holy design

"Stent astra licebit.
Non derit populo.
Te veniente dies"

Self-glorification in black euphoria and lust
Unaccustomed luxury a new messiah arrives

I'm the one who will open the gates
I'm the one who will save your soul
I'm the one... The only one!
