Closed in a black cage feeling the smell of female
Over-forced life temptation and desires
Unecclesiastical faith celebrates the night
Inexorable conscience infected by melancholy

[sub-chorus:]
Insensitive? Immaculate? Insensitive? Immaculate?

Unecclesiastical faith celebrates the night
Inexorable process of violation

[Chorus:]
Insensitive? Immaculate? Insensitive? Immaculate?
Shut in your secret and tormented by your twisted fate

Dreaming to fly away in sin
Dreaming to fly away in sin

[Chorus:]
Insensitive? Immaculate? Insensitive? Immaculate?
Shut in your secret and tormented by your twisted fate
