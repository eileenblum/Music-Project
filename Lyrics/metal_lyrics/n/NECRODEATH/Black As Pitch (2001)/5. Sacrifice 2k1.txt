Rebirth of the "Magick"
In macrocosmical reign
Archetype of the circle
Vibrations of the heavenly names
The ancient are one
Unite by the fathers of time
Out of the mirror await the spirits revive

[Chorus:]
Eucharistical sacrifice - To heaven gates - Sacrifice

Glorified by the last storm Atlantis arises
Yperborea's birthday reflects in cabalistical eyes
Shapeless chaos re-enter perpetual illusion
Superior vegetals ostiary turns to salvation

[Chorus:]
Eucharistical sacrifice - To heaven gates - Sacrifice

"If I come to fall in error
When the jackal's freed from the cage
Let the carrion sounds its horror
New glory in one thousand flames
Pranayama calms emotions
End it now tomorrow's will
Iron lungs for mechanical pressure
The atomic cult of fear"

Emulation denied
Universal altar burns
Black stars enflamed
Eternity dies

[repeat 1st verse + chorus]
