The night was a riot
A riot of stars
The light was so strong
To see reality
A corpse without dresses
Lying on the grass
Fearing the worst
Dead terrified

[sub-chorus:]
Riot of stars-Black sky has burst
Riot of stars-Black sky has burst

Discovering what it means/ To be truly alone
The light was so strong/ To see reality
Discovering what it means/ To be truly alone
Fearing the worst/ Dead terrified

[chorus:]
Riot of stars-Black sky has burst
Riot of stars-Black sky has burst
Heavy lidded - Impassivity
Heavy lidded - Impassivity

Mouth open in a silent cry of agony
Tongue protruding slightly

Heavy lidded - Impassivity

Flushed face burst blood vessel on her cheeks and eyeballs

Heavy lidded - Impassivity

No statue of limitation on murder
No presumption of innocence
Death had frozen her expression
and from the sky stars fly!

[repeat chorus]
