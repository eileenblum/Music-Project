{Black as pitch to horrify- Red as blood to sanctify}

Lying on my bed dreaming to enter in the horror room
Nightmare is here no words to explain the intense horror
Desperation Aberration

[sub-chorus:]
Blood delivered to pain shockin' my dimension
Blood focused into fear releasing my repulsion

Mutilated bodies . Wretched torment inflicted
Horror decorations . Death rains from above
Final Repression . Decapitated heads
Homicidal Punishment . Death rains from above
Desperation aberration

[Chorus:]
Blood delivered to pain shockin' my dimension
Blood focused into fear releasing my repulsion
Blood gorgled like vomit falling from ceiling
Blood splashed in bright globules burstin' like a bomb

Strong Effluvion of death
squealing with excitement
Collapsed into a tragedy of a double murder
The horror images dissolved
The horror images reformed

Black as pitch to horrify- Red as blood to sanctify

Wake up from nightmares
In a pool of sweat
Feeling a cold iron round the sweaty wrists
The horror images dissolved
The horror images reformed

Black as pitch to horrify- Red as blood to sanctify

[repeat chorus]
