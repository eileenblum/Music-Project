Anguish and fury tears and blood
States dissolution physical decay
Determination with fear
Final war is near
"Ciner gloria sera venit" - Armageddon

[Chorus:]
Open your eyes until you die
Open your eyes until you die- Killing time!

Gods of war are ready
Persecution is wasted
Breakin' the silence
Danger lurking everywhere

[Chorus:]
Open your eyes until you die
Open your eyes until you die- Killing time!

Out of the black depths,
Cry to you oh my lord
Cry to you oh my lord

[Chorus:]
Open your eyes until you die
Open your eyes until you die
Open your eyes until you die
Open your eyes until you die
