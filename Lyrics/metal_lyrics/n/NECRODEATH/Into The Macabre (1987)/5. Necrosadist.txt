Beyond the boundaries of evil and death
Where soul obscenity is true
Violence on animals, desecration of corpses
In pray to putrefaction
Bestial, bewitching, satanic embrace
With the endless tormented body
Exhumation of lies of woman and man
Children die in the wind

Violator of deadly pale 
No one rests to be saved 
Hitting with the unholy knife 
No fearing the soul of Christ

Necrosadist takes your life,
Necrosadist...

Butchery of zombies, he enjoys while his victims
Relentless run to decay
Animals, children, old women, whores
Know the unbound agony
Vacher, one of the greatest exposures
Demon of bloody sadism
The upbraided and wild lust of nightmare of death
The horror becomes reality

Violator of deadly pale
No one rests to be saved 
Hitting with the unholy knife 
No fearing the soul of Christ

Necrosadist takes your life,
Necrosadist...

Slow, perfect in his rush of fear
Turning in the blackest sky
Spirit of the obedience
Smash! You're paralysed
Descend into the crypts of hell
Praising and deteriorate
See the colours of bones disease
Bleeding of the lifeless bodies
Satisfy his every must
Intense desire still alive
I will arise
Sucking' in to cause your death
Pay for endless decree
The flame of death burns black in mind
Slow death, eternity
Inform the lord of fire and pain
Look down the grace of spell
The old woman is twisted and slaughtered
Send her soul to hell
Deny the wrath of God
Pledge to me a slave
Drink the blood of the masses
Exhumer of your grave

Necrosadist takes your life,
Necrosadist...
