Poisoned souls, exposed by me
Death's increase
One thousand lies of burning shame
In morbid soul
Consecrate the chosen one
Life of me
Carry your hand in my prophecy
The blood will flow 

Morbid oblivious
Sickened corpses left beyond
My deception in your darkened mind
The sinners arise
To gaze the sacred lie
Internal, death, decay...

Germs of dismay, by carnal of life
Infest your blood
My son is light and fragrant soul
The days fall
Kneeling before dubious altars
The wise chose
Silent death of human soul
The pain wins

Morbid oblivious
Sickened corpses left beyond
My deception in your darkened mind
The sinners arise
To gaze the sacred lie
Internal, death, decay...

You will live in misery
By the spell you cannot lie
Yield your hands to prophecy
Bursting' of death, ... now you die!
Serve the wishes of the gods
Rule supreme in monarchy
Incantations of the gore
Sanctify your death to me

Distressed entrails
Palsy stricken
Sigmoid colon
Precious blood

Portrait of lust, front the accused
The bench of hell is reborn
Pieces of brain impaled on the tree
Disturb the sight of the weak
Living in chaos, perish in silence
Supreme annihilation
Infected breaths, reappears the plague
The sign of intoxication
My redemption fades to dust
Shows the symbol of lust
Infest your corpse, latent disease
Create the downfall of disguise
Morbid erosion, tearing of flesh
One thousand mutilations
Fallen doom, possessed bodies
Retting pit's declaration
