Ice in sight fear his soul
The ship awaits the land
The camp of death, placed in pain
Ruins of city are near at hand

Mountains of madness

Ancient visions, inside his head
The blood has marked their way
Enormous rocks derange their eyes
The others men are slaved

Mountains of madness

The Creature appears from darkness...
Breaking the ancient gates...
Their minds are twisted with fear...

... Comes? ... Death?
They will die!

The flight toward the dead begins
A vast tableland appears
The Ancient begins charm my soul
Enter new world of fear

Hide... or die in the abyss way

They're bounded in a cage of stone
Seeking safety in flight
The visions from Necronomicon
Ways of salvation are open wide
Hide... hide... hide...
