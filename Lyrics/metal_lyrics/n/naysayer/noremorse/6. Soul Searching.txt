Deceived, you lied
Filled my head with empty promises
Thought that this was real
Guess I was wrong again
No surprise
Should have seen through your disguises
But I fell victim to your fucking games
Fool myself
Into thinking you still care
But the truth is
You were never there

Tried to sleep it off
And lied awake for days
The shit you put me through
Has left me insane
I'm barely holding on
What the fuck do I do
This isn't just goodbye
This is I hate you

Soul searching
And I came across some answers
To the questions you would just ignore
Stuck in desperation
Just avoiding the truth
This isn't what I want anymore
You offered up excuses
That's all you ever gave me
Looked past the obvious to make things work
But you tore it apart
Afraid to get hurt
I saw a light in your eyes
And I got burned

I tried to sleep it off
And lied awake for days
The shit you put me through
Has left me insane
A bitter fucking taste
Is all that's left in my mouth
I should have seen through
Fucking sooner than now

I turn my back on the ones who turned on me!
