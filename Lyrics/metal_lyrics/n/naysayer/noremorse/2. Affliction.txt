i'm at the end of my rope and i'm slipping
losing my faith in humanity - i'm falling fast
i've lost my grasp on reality

daily struggle is weighing me down
society tries to pull me i underground
another year has passed - everything's the same
nothing's gotten better - am i to blame?

my own demons drag me down everyday
in this world of death, deceit, and decay
fucked in the head - don't stand a chance 
this wretched world has me fucking trapped
