Walking down the street
Thinking about everything
'cause I can't fucking sleep
Look what you've done to me
So fucking miserable
That I don't want to speak

Lying to myself
Saying things will be fine
But this is where we're at
I can't turn back time

Before you go I just want you to know
I didn't fucking want this and I'm not happy
Now I hope you're just as miserable
Where did we go so fucking wrong?

Temptation surrounds
So easy to give in
To the hand that feeds deception
Looking around
Now you're nowhere to be found
I can't go back
I know where we stand
Had me trapped
Caught up in your lies
But I'm not wasting anymore of my time
I just want some peace of mind

What will you do when they turn their backs
And become just a part of your past?
Times have changed now you're someone new
And that's fine
I'm better off without you
