I see the world for what it is
Not what I want it to be
They'll try to fill your head with lies
So fucking hard to believe
It's a goddamn jungle
Where nothing's as it seems
They'll try to catch you up
In their fantasy

Burned my bridges
I'm not making amends
Decisions been made
Lines drawn in the sand
Do what I gotta do
Just to get by
Do what I gotta do
Just to survive

Think of all the times you lied
I must have been fucking blind

You don't know the struggles that I face
Shit inside my head
That I can't erase
But I should've know you would'nt last
Now there's no fucking turning back

Burned my bridges
I'm not making amends
Decisions been made
Lines drawn in the sand
Nowhere to turn
When nothing's the same
Only time will tell
In this twisted fucking game
