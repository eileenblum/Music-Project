There's one thing you need to know
You won't string me along anymore
I'm not holding anything back this time
No more biting my tongue

Life is pain
And no one's safe
That shit's been drilled into our fucking brains
When I see you now you look the other way
How's it feel to be so fucking fake?

This fucking cesspool
Has got me drowning in hate
And I don't know if I'll fucking last
I'm still searching
For something more
Still dealing with my past

Put my life on the scales
The bad outweighs the good
