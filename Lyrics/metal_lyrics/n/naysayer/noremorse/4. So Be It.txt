Feeling drained
Nothing left but hate
Empty words
From empty fakes
Their fucking lies
Mean nothing to me
I turn my back in disbelief
Been fucked over too many times
To expect a thing from anyone else
Everything in this fucking world
You gotta take for yourself

Take or be taken
Kill or be killed
Surrounded by foes
Where will you turn in the end?
Searching for truth
Finding nothing but lies
I won't become what I fucking despise

Turn my back
Watch society bleed
Push them to the side
Like they did to me
I'm only getting older
As time slips away
Just trying to find my place
In this day and age
With time comes pain
And nothing's getting easier
Still feel like everything's
Just out of my reach
But I'm still fighting for something more
I won't sit back and let it swallow me whole

Turn my back
Watch society bleed
Push them to the side
Just like they did to me
Turn my back in disbelief!
