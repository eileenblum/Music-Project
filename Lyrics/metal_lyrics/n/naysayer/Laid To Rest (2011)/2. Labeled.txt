Labeled as freaks, losers, misfits - We're outcast
Never meant to fit into their mold
They set their standarts
Then they sit back and judge
The choice is yours
Think for yourself - Or do as you're told

Living in a world - All our own
They'll never understand - What we have
Standing on the outside - Looking in
I'd never want to be like any of them
You look at us - You say that we're to blame
Or is it because - You've made us this way

Day after day - It's all the same
So sick of playing - Your twisted game
It's hard to be the better man
When everything seems like a fuckin scam

Pay the price - For the shit that we do
There's no one looking out for me or for you
Searching for something that can't seem to be found
Another day leaves me laying on the ground

On the fucking ground
