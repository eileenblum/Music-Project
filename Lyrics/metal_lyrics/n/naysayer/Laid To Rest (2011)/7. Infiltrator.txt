I've watched you come and go - So many times
Put on your act - Spit out your lies
No heart, no soul - In those words you speak
Say what you think we want to hear
Not what you really believe

Too many cheaters, liars and fakes
Involved in what I love
Seek out the true - Leave the rest in the dust
No room for them around us

Won't let you infiltrate
There's no room here for snakes
Within these walls we've built - We're a family
I'll look out for everyone of you
I would hope you do the same for me

Won't let you poison their minds
We're wise to your kind
See through your every disguise
You won't lead us down your trail of lies
