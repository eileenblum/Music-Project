Ask nothing from me - I'll ask nothing from you
You're nothing like me - I'll be nothing like you
Different morals - Different ideals - Different truths
With my friends by my side - I know that I'll make it through

I may be down - But I'm not fucking out
No matter what this life throws at me - I'll stick around
I know I'll make it - I can't fake it - This is all I got

The choices that I've made
Have made me who I am today
No easy answers - I learn from all of my mistakes
Can't live life on my knees - Wondering why
I'll keep on fighting - I know I'll survive

I'll Survive

I may be down - But not out
Won't be defeated - Or pushed around

I may be down - But not out
This fucking world - Won't break me down
