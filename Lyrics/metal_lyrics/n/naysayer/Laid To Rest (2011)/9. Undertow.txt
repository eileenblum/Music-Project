All that I've been given
Is this pain that I've been living

Done things I can't take back
Made my share of mistakes
But my path was my own - And it led me here
Been fucked over and used
Left behind - And abused
But through the pain - I found proof

Through the pain - I found proof
Through the struggle - I found strength

All that I've been given
Is this pain that I've been living

Learning more about myself everyday
Put an end to the things - Destroying me
Learn to adapt - Move on from the past
I can't continue down this self-destructive path

I won't get caught in the undertow

Through the pain - I found proof
Through the struggle - I found strength
To overcome my weaknesses
Put them behind me
Moving forward - No looking back

Set me free
