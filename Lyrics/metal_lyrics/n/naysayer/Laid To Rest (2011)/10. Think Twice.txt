A choice I made because it works for me
Cut out the things in life - I don't need
Make decisions based on what you think
Not what others tell you to believe

Why waste your time?
Use your own mind
What would you do?
If someone wasn't there to tell you

Could you figure it out for yourself?
Or do you rely on their help?
