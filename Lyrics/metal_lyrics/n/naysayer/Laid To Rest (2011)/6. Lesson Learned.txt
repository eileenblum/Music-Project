Fooled again - I let you back in
Refused to learn my lesson - Now I'm played in the end
That's OK because I'm not hurt
When you play a game with liars - You should expect to get burned

But that's fine - I learned the hard way again
I'm probably better off to know - You're not a true friend
No surprise - You fed me lies
Well, I was lying to myself
Pretending you were worth my time
In the end - Things will work out fine
You're just a little stepping stone - Forget about in due time
I'm not concerned - I'll keep the scars
A scar is a lesson learned - A lesson learned hard

So go ahead - And play your games
It seems you're still stuck in your same old ways
Give it up - It don't impress anyone
Your role is no longer needed - That shit is tired and done
Thanks for the memories - I'll try to forget
Not talking shit - But letting go
I hope the message gets sent
When will you see - You're kidding yourself
So take that foolish act - And put it back on the shelf

But that's fine - I learned the hard way again
I'm probably better off to know - You're not a true friend
No surprise - You fed me lies
Well, I was lying to myself
Pretending you were worth my time
In the end - Things will work out fine
You're just a little stepping stone - Forget about in due time
I'm not concerned - I'll keep the scars
A scar is a lesson learned - A lesson learned hard
