Turn your back - I'll be just fine
Changing for the same - Just a matter of time
But I won't change my mind
As for you - Shouldn't be surprised
I watched you drop - Right before my eyes
You fall - I rise

I hope it's worth it (to you) - To make that change
It doesn't make any sense to me
What's the matter - You lost your faith?
It's still important to me

Now I'm waiting to see what's next
What's gonna come from all of this?
Fade away - Will you disappear
We're probably better - Without you here
Time changed - And you changed your mind
I hope you enjoy it - What you're trying to find
But, I won't follow blind

And now you take the ride
Well, that's just fine
What are you trying to find?
I won't follow blind...

You won't change my mind.
