It's a new day and age - There's no room for your hate
I won't let you explain - 'Cause I don't care what you say
I rarely see you - But I know you exist
Just the thought of having you around - Makes me fucking sick

We don't need you - We don't want you
Or the bullshit you create
We don't have a thing in common
And we will never relate

You're fucking scum
We won't let you in
Racial prejudice
Doesn't make any sense

Come here for release - From the outside world
Won't let you bring that bullshit - Through these doors
This is a place for open minds
Keep walking - You're wasting your time
