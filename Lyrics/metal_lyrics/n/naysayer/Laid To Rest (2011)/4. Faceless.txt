So much time - Spent focused on the wrong things
Can't sit back - And wait for things to change

Run your mouth - When we're not around
Saying this - Saying that
No fucking clue what you're talking about
The rumor mill strikes again

Your empty words - Fall on deaf ears

You know you're safe - Hiding behind your screen
No one can get to you - So you do as you please

I think you're weak - Faceless enemy

Behind our backs - Is where you attack
You're a coward - You get no respect
Point and click - That's all you do
It gets you nothing - Fuck you
