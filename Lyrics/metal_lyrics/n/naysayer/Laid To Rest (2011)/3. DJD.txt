Things ain't how they use to be - And they ain't goin' back
What's done is done - That's how it is - So leave it in the past
It's sad to say - I wish it didn't have to be this way
Yea, I still think about you almost every single day
So much was shared - Memories I won't forget
Fighting in the streets - We once stood back to back
Never thought that we could break that bond
Crazy to think - That it all got lost

In a world where nothing's sacred - Who am I to fucking trust?
People turn their backs - So quickly they forget - What once meant so much

Here I stand watching you fade away
Watching you turn into what we use to hate
What we once stood so strongly against
Has now become your every breathe
What can I say? Some people change
Friends grow apart - Go separate ways
I think it sucks - But who's to blame?
I will always remeber those days

And now you're gone
We still cross paths - Every now and again
But it ain't the same - Such a fucking shame
Those days are gone - But not forgot my friend
I hope this ain't the way - It fucking ends
