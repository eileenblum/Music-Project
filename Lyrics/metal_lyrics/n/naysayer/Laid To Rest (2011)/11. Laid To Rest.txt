Living lost a reckless youth
Didn't give a fuck - Only put trust in a few
Living life with a bitter mind
No salvation - For me to find

If you could see the world through my eyes
Maybe you could understand my pain
Thrown into this world of lies - How am I to blame?
For accepting a life of sin
Not too many things I believe in - Anymore

Told I was nothing - And I wouldn't be missed
When I was young - His only kid
Still I go back to that day as a child
Living in fear - Wondering why I was around
Years spent searching for a place where I fit
Tried to forget all of the things that were said
So I moved on and left that shit in the past
Went down that road and never looked back

If you could see the world through my eyes
Maybe you could understand my pain
Thrown into this world of lies - How am I to blame?
For accepting a life of sin
Not too many things I believe in - Anymore

I was living in hell

So many stories of my life I could tell
All of the times that I was living in hell
But I moved on and left that shit in the past
Another memory - I've laid to rest
