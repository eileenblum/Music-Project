Inspired by the will of death
With hell in our hearts, insane and slaves
We build and we crowd our cities
Like Frantic automata would build their tombs

We work for the devil and he will overcome us
And if god exists, inevitably embittered
Impotent facing our organized funeral marches
He would envy our mortality

The youngest believe in nothing
Debauchery and illusion are their only attributes
The elders are dying in absolute disinterest
Going back to nothingness like they've come

Our destiny is to breed always
In order to perish innumerable
For we need believers, soldiers, and consumers
We're glorifying war, nuclear, madness, and death
These are the new gods of the masses of sleepwalkers
And we're sacrificing ourselves in crowd on their altars

We're rising into the nothingness
That fills our lives and will be our death
Disaster is near, the forecasted apocalypse
By dint of multiplying deserts by impoverishing our souls

We will walk united towards darkness without
Returning and will die
Accompanied by our absurd gods and criminal values
Only ruins of our daughters of chaos will remain
Our edifices will become our cemeteries

We have means to destroy ourselves a thousand times
And it won't be differently
Blinded by our religions promising an afterlife
While only nothingness is opening its arms to us

Let us accept the obviousness
Eternal chaos is waiting for us
It's too late to go backwards
We're evolving towards our sublime extinction
