I vomit for being born human
I spit my disgust for all that is
At an age where nothing pleases me
And where joys are reduced to physiological needs

Every night I fall asleep
With the expectancy of never waking up
Getting lost in oneiric eternity
Avoiding he brutal return to ephemeral reality

Happiness this degrading delusion
Supreme insult to intelligence
Leads us to naively marvel
At the worst mundane silliness

I'm moving with lucidity as my only light
Through darkness of the masses of decerebrate
And useless parasites
Towards absolute nihilism
Into the crystalline firmament of cold purity

Complete destruction is the basis of purity
To timelessly deny the world
Leads to absolute wisdom
Otherwise only hate and contempt remain

My heart has changed to stone
When I realized that anything we believed
In as children
Was actually lies destined to fill our
Meaningless existence
Of stinking carcass avid for vain and low pleasures

The only way to recover from nihilism is to go
Back to chaos
Rejecting all we have learned
More than killing ourselves
It's going back to that unborn state to choose
To never come to life
