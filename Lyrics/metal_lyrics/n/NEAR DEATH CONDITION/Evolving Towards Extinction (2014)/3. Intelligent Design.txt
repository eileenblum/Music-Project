Emergence of life without law or chance
Evolution turned towards empty complexity
Creation of the insignificant from naught
There must be an intelligent design!

Absolute imperfection made man
Our disgusts defining us more than our likes

Creature that is not inclined to love
But that rejoices with the disappearances of his fellow man
And though doesn't give up procreating
Perpetually organising the crime
Creature coming from the mire
Having mediocrity as single utopia

Wars and concentration camps
Undoubtedly the most completed of our works
Have no equivalent in barbarity
But our foolish and soul-destroying entertainments

Love is but a malevolent excuse that leads us to fuck
Reminding us our condition of hideous beasts
Predators in search of easy preys

Begging to be sacrificed on the altar of lust
Devoting ourselves to the worst vices in a cascade
Of debauchery
Teenager intoxicated with sex, rapists
Of offered virgins
Woodlice copulating with sluts to give birth to
Diabolic creatures
Engendering new obscene torturers that will call
To believe in humanity

Dereliction only weapon of the thinkers
And the lucides
Annihilating everything it can heal and save us
From the eternal curse fallen
Unto the Ark's descendants
After the madness of Noah desiring to perpetuate
Such an absurdity

Then yes, there must be an intelligent design
But only the Devil can be the perpetrator
Of such a malediction
For created in his hideous image
From birth to death humans have nothing good
