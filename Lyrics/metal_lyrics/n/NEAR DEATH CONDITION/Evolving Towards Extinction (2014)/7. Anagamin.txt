The day I'll be totally indifferent
To the human misery
It will be time for me to put an end to my existence
And I profess without emotion
Human life has never been as empty as now

I have enough of this world shaped by madness
Of seeing throughout history the same mistakes
From this pathetic species I'm realising myself
To never come back through any form of life

Time has come to ruse upon the mass of perdition
Leaving this spermatic automata-infested world
In order to integrate in rapture
The divine constellation
And to sit on the throne of the god of the gods,
Mysteries and death

Let us celebrate death
And praise the loss
I deny your sickening reality
I want to recover from emptiness

Ultimate metempsychosis
Divine transmigration
I deny your putrid reality
I want to recover from life

Lightbringer who will never return
Prophet of modern times
I leave you in misery and suffering
You're too selfish to accept the absurdity of existence

Dying is the first virtue
And believing in humanity is an intellectual crime
I bid you farewell humans in disgrace
Without even holding my hand out to you
