Impure seeds have spread on the garden of Eden
Malediction from the netherworld grown into human forms
Walking cadavers with no intrinsic value
Spending our time consuming in the name of death

No compassion in our sight
Heart filled with the weakest feelings
Brain case full of mire
Controlling the lowest instincts
With the need to procreate again
Giving birth to hideous creatures
And to destroy everything we touch
In deadly indifference

It is time to summon purification
Communing with emptiness
Let us gather in impenetrable darkness
To celebrate the arrival of the great reaper
Let us join hands in a funeral farandole
For harvest time promises to be successful

Behold the majestic death on its funeral chariot
Raising its glittering blade above vermin
Draped in darkness, its look empty and cold
Death is descending onto earthly hell

[Solo: Patrick]

The scatterbrained woodlice swarming on their tomb
Rejecting evidence of the eternal void embracing us
Wanting to escape their inevitable fate
This certainty that death will always overcome us

Heads are severed with with unprecedented precision
Impure blood is spilled on the ground
The stinking carcasses are falling like waste
In a blissful apocalyptic orgy
These cadavers using to gesticulate like worms
Are reduced to ashes by the fires of hell
The earth is purified of human vermin
We are but one with absolute emptiness
