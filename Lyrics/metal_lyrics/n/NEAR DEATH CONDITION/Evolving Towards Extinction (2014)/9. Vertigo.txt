A simple glance into the past and I suddenly realize
In a maelstrom of bitterness and disgust
That dreams enlightening my childhood
Have been shattered like waves against the rocks

Thus looking towards the future
There is nothing but emptiness and decrepitude
Of a life that fills with hate and frustrations
At the rhythm of my painful heartbeats

Contemplating the celestial sphere
This great void surrounding us and making us cease to matter
Reinforcing my conviction that god has forgotten us
In eternity of nothingness that our extinction
Would not undermine

[Solo: Stephane]

I finally turn my eyes towards the most absolute emptiness
The one to which the noblest feelings are assigned
Catalyzer of suffering, overwhelmed by debilitating emotions
That only dereliction can annihilate

Focused on our miserable and dusty existence
Insignificant while we're contemplating this world
From the seat left vacant by god
Long gone to cry the bereavement of his creation

Nothing is immutable, nothing stays
Sentenced to roam into the throes of time
Enslaved by flesh, real infirmity of mind
The need for a mean to annihilate ourselves remains

Vertigo
Above the void of existence
That makes me lose my marks
I can give no sense to this
And need to end it all
But it's my addiction to suffering
That still keeps me alive
