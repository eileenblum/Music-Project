Disgust comes with the awareness of unhappiness
Turning this life into an annex of Hell
Universal disease for which there is no cure
Without causality, we must accept it
As a negative miracle
For all human beings are deeply unhappy
But blind, most of us cannot see this obviousness
And nothing can stop us from bleeding
In our delightful quest for absolute despair
And even our superhuman disregards
And our revulsions
Our armour of disdain, the height of despair
Are futile in face of the agony of existence
That millennia of dogma have tried to erase

We have forged God without and reserve of energy
Anthropomorphic projection of our anemia
Poor and puny picture without interest
In which no-one could recognize himself
For it is the Devil who resembles us
Lord of war, intelligent and petty
But arousing our disgust, men hate
And repudiate him
They recognize themselves in him too much
To praise him
No prayer is addressed to the Devil
And he has no altar
For worshiping him would be praising
Ourselves introspectively
He is the evidence and reality is not
An object of worship
But dressed in black, he is mourning
Our lives and virtues

The air of the creator's sin is unbreathable
For despair and evil are everywhere in the heart of men
Everything disgusts me, men, life, this world
Everything disgusts me but the salutary death
