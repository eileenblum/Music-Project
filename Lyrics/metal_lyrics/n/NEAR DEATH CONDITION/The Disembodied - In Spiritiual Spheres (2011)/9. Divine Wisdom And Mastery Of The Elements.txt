[The Alpha]

After centuries of a relentless divine quest
Of meditations taking me away from the remaining humans
I've reached this state of divine wisdom
Where the weak human feelings have vanished

Endlessly reincarnating to bring plague to all eras
I now rise upon your insignificance
To reach this state of grace
Where I have the right of life and death on all plains of existence

I am divine
I'm the darkness you fear
I hold the blinding light
That you dare not see

[The Omega]

My breath turns into a wrenching tempest
Destroying your houses and sweeping your possessions away
A hurricane of unprecedented intensity
Leaving from your lives just desolation and cadavers

Quake! The earth collapses under my footsteps
Releasing energy that is equaled just by my wrath
In a gaping split, the gates of hell
You fall from the height of your ignorance

I am the annihilating water, tsunami stronger than ever
I sweep everything away on my path
Inundating in a split second what you've built in so many years
Leaving just plague and putrefaction

I am the purifying fire, hellish flames
That set ablaze your impious lives
From the inside I consume your soul
Leaving from your lives just ashes and smoke

I attach no more importance to human life
I just enjoy your suffering and death
Your prayers sound like a need for suicide assistance
In wisdom I have become the Almighty God Of Negation
