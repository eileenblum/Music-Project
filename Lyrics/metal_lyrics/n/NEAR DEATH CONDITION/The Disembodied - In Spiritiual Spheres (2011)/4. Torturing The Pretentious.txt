When you have crossed my way
With pride you have displayed your certitudes
Glorifying the human race
Pretending the truth was at your hands

This night your life will change
Your theories becoming your weakness
The darkest side of mankind growing in me
I will show you what we really are

After having bound you with barbed wire
I hit you to break all your bones
Have you imagined a being as cultured as you
Could suffer so much?
I can see through your eyes
As I blow up your organs without cutting your skin
Your sudden desire to die
But it would be too easy
I want to keep you alive until the last moment
Although it is involuntary
You now are my accomplice

I sprinkle you with acid and boiling water
Struggling you are skinning yourself
But you are disappointing me a little
Because you are no more telling me
What is right and what is wrong
And what I am supposed to be as a worthy human being

Cruel like Dinah and Moumine
I play the game of death with you
I cannot imagine that this vulgar pile of flesh
Once was pretending being intelligent
