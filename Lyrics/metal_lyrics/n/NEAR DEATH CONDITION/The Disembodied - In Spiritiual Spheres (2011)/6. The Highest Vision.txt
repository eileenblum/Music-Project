Grant me the gift of seeing through death
O', mighty upholder of the firmament
For I can disclose with delight
The mysteries of divine condition

Bestow on those who have awakened
Symbolic death of their human waste
For the spirit can rise and open the gate
To the eternity of divine condition

With wisdom I praise the end of life
Impatiently waiting to leave my mortal shell

I'm gazing at our suffering
Contemplating our decline
I'm gazing at our misery
For clearing up the meaning of life

The void of existence I have revealed
As I've seen beyond life and death
Please give an end to my earthly mission
For I can shine in spiritual spheres

With wisdom I praise the end of life
Impatiently waiting to become divine
