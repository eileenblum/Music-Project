Entropy's tide built an empire
Carved from the very flesh of time
Whence he came, whence he crawled

He of the thousand blades
He of the machine mind
Perfection man-made god
Our Lord of the tree of thorns
He was designed to create pain
And to collide philosophy
With technology
He the machine messiah
The pain generator
Alluring empathy
Stifling sympathy

Rise in scorn in agony
Grant us our ending
To become deader than death

Almighty but insentient
Taming time but conscienceless
Surhuman or Subhuman?

Harbinger of the ultimate intelligence
From the bosom of time
Far beyond human
