This world in decline has no more reason to exist
Time has come to beg for its destruction
In the name of Rudra, the destructive storm god
We initiate the ritual of the end of our world

Look at the kind of values the humans are living for
And you'll understand that mankind deserves to die
Fortunately the end of the world is near
Make place to the ineffable Universal One!

As thy instruments of death on the earth
We distill thy purifying venom through our veins
Chosen and proud to fulfill the ultimate massacre
We initiate the cosmic dance of the world's annihilation

Dancing Lord who, in a perpetual movement
Crushes with wrath the ignorance of the world
May thou make the earth quake with violence
And tear the sky up in terrifying din

Exhilarated by the divine strength bestowed on us
Rejoiced by the vision of the word in flames
Amused by the panic violently spread over mankind
We fulfill our divine task of salvation

Cleansing and purifying, the universe from the human waste
It's the triumph of the divine knowledge over the human ignorance
From the sidereal void left a new world will arise
A world where the spiritual values won't be obscured by the fleshly
