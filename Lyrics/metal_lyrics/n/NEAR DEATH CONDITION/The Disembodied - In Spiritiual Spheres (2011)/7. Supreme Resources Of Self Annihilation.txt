There's no greater freedom than the one of eliminating ourselves
It instills into us a swelled force that makes us
Dominates the burden of life
And humiliates religions that see in it the absolute disobedience
This freedom is our only gate to the real salvation

The idea of killing ourselves is one of the most comforting
Act that God himself is unable to fulfill
It makes us triumph over the cosmic carrion
That can take anything but our own death

The worthlessness of life and its infinity of vacuity
Have been revealed in the course of my existence
Through reflections, meditations, and disillusions
Having forged my black heart now painfully beating

But awakened far too late, my instincts established and guides
From the innocence of childhood to the wounds of youth
Stunned by the findings of my reflections
I have postponed the time of my own annihilation

I can't remember having loved life one day
But my hate towards the existence has grown stronger
Now that I've perceived the divine beyond death
And my self destruction has begun

As the only arbiter of my existence
I have honorably chosen the day of my demise
Like the ancient wise men I'll take my life
Rather than accepting the agony of the natural laws
