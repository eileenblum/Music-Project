Every day, every step closer to death
I strive to annihilate any trace of humanity in me
To find the end of my existence
Without the morbid delusion of a meaning in life

Trying to find a meaning in this existence
You've obscured your inner spiritual light
Devoting yourselves to the flesh worship
Refusing the finiteness and the decrepitude of the body

Just caring about what's superficial and perishable
You've moved away from the brilliant mystical path
Sinking into the depths of ephemeral pleasures
Instead of developing the absolute divine knowledge

But what will remain of this sanctuary of vice
Of this vile body on the blessed day of our death?
I can tell you. A stinking putrefying carcass
A lifeless body as insignificant as wastes

I hate this sick and suffering body that withers day after day
Creature in decline that has been disposed by God
Prison for the spirit tamed by the weakest animal impulses
Insult to the greatness and limitlessness of the Universal One

Every human's death is enjoyable
The seeing of this putrefied carrion comforts me
In the idea of the absolute nonsense of existence
And the need of releasing my spirit from this mortal shell
