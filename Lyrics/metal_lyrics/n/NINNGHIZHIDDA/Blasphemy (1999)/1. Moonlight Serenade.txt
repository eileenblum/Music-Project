The final sunlight , fades in the dawn
It's time to celebrate , the spell of the moon
The profane , and weak will flee
When we embrace , the velvet darkness

The frozen stars , that shine above
(Left) a silvery gleam , over the midnight forest
Winterwinds , that groan and whisper
Ancient wisdoms , of the glorious past

Listen to the sweet music of the night
Is it the howls of my darkbrood ?!
Yes , the wind carry their salute

My fellow wolves come walk with me !!!
My fellow wolves come bark with me !!!

The gentle touch , of the moon
A caress , on my shivering skin
This night shall last , eternally

My darkbrood and me , have to fulfill
The infinite quest , that last on thee
The final moment , of our ritual is near
To end our mediaeval , midnight symphony

Listen to the sweet music of the night
Is it the howls of my darkbrood ?!
Yes , the wind carry their salute

My fellow wolves , share the night with me
My fellow wolves , let us share eternity
This night shall last , eternally
