Symbols gathered , thoughts set upon , the pinnacles blaze
Bring forth ,the messenger , of voluptuous , delight

Invoked under a brooding moon , dark ones to appease
They shalt weave a web , `bout the one on whom thoughts alight

Oh pale majestic , please appear

Her presence , a fire , admist the gloom
Together we cling , and dominate the night

So angelic she first seem , she feels the snearing flame unseen
The flame of lust , dark desire , consecrated by Lord Satan's fire

Demon from the void of night , stand with rod athrust
Yearning to feed upon , the witches flesh

Lust to enflame , her demons to release
Together we cling and dominate the night
