As flesh entwines , and passion burn
She fixed me with , a basilisk stare
I saw the fire , dancing in her eyes
I've been caught , (in) an everflowing stream

My heat inside , her fuels the furnace
She bewitched me , with her angelic smile
Lost in realms of , carnal ecstasy

As demons writhe , in lewd abandon
Under the spell , (of her) infernal beauty

I give birth , to flowing life
Warm nectar , fills my body
As I give , the essential essence , of life

To her trembling divine womb
What has always been banned , now shall be done

As throes of dawn , are send from heaven
The end of our , time has come
Under the pale moon she stands , renewed and full of desire

The flame of lust , is burning higher
Oh my goddes , our love will never die
(but) the elder ones , returned her to their side

And no one can silence my pain !!!
