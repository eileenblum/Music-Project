Cast in the pit , under false morality
Asphyxiated by the christian creed

I call to thee , ERESHKIGAL , queen of darkness
Condemned , for seeing , through their web of lies
Oh Lord grant me in my depths , the purchance to dream
Self rightous priests cling to their hipocrisy
Mother of chaos , hear my forlorn call

Accept the gift my demons bring that I might pass the gate
Confront me now , ERESHKIGAL , confront me now with thee!!
Oh Lord grant me in my depths , the purchance to dream
Slaves of sanctomonious wretch , obey the true father of lies

Follow the way that leads , into false morality
Thou art dictator , icon of filth , enslaver
Our path unveils untold pleasures
Ever the praises of the faceless DOG 
Your death will be my fame

My wisdom undefiled , the flesh shall prevail
The age has dawned , and time has come
To rise against the fools of christ , with hate and despise
In fervent visions and dreams I still see
The unholy communion , against the christian race
Crucify the lambs of christ , to crush their web of lies
Oh Lord grant me in my depths , the purchance to dream
I call to the , ERESHKIGAL , queen of darkness
Goddes of desire ,hear my forlorn call
