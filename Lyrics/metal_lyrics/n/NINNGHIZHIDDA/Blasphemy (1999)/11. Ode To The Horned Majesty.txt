Darkness my mate I still wander , (under) your perfect shelter
At shores of night I raise my wings and praise the divine

Extinct is the light , that extinct the night
It now seems like , the dark is calling

Bearer ot mortality , bringer of delight
Let me taste the essence , of your delicious wine

We live by our desires , in the pagan way
We come to cleanse this world , with everlasting fire

We leave the treshold , (to) your realm behind
We enter the regal world , so splenderous and wide

Toward the gates , we march on 
To complete our reign , with the throne of stone
