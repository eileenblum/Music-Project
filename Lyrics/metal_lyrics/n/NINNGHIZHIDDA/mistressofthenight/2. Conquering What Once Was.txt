Beyond the plans, where the chaos reigns
We brood beneath the stars while ages past.
revel in the ancient spheres, where no life dwells
Captured by the sacred songs and spells of the Witch !!!!!

The wind of the vortex, that swirls amongst the stars
will guide our path, from the ultimate void
Unseen and loathsome we descend to strike forth
We lie in wait, till the stars stand right, to come .........

Arisen, in Blasphemy, oh Lord, of hell
ear the howl of the serpent, whose roaring fills the sky 
Sleeping, (in) awaiting, dead, but dreaming
The legions of the horned, will rise up from their slumber
Never, scorn, to wear, the horns
Our servants do homage, celebrate the arrivel

Treasures of darkness, treasures of night
Open the gate, that I can fell your might

Conquering, what, once, was
We are tryin' to take control, we are tryin to take them all
The choir, of the damned, whispers, hunting requiems
We summon the storm, that annihilates the land
We choose, to live, our life, in Blasphemy
Darkness shall be eternal, when all shall bow (be)for(e) our throne !!!!!!
