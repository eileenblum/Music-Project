Nightfall dreams (of passion) were granted
Religious thoughts are shattered
Nights of passion,nights of pain
Flesh is weak, lust is strength
Hidden obssessions, of the virgin
will blame, thou art dictator
Heaven's on fire, Satan's desire
Who will rule, the world next

Feeble church, crumbles, sacred rites, desecrated
The wolves, on the hill, howl with thee

Your skin I yearn to share
The secret taste,the hidden pleasure

Beloved, in darkest night I feel your spell
Can't resiste the origin of sin
The recollaction of temptation is too strong
Temptation takes control

My precious gift I offer you
Spread your legs, unveil your throne
I feel me deep

Feed the burning desire, that breeds in me
Your caress cuts like a serpent fang
And makes me shiver

This moment shall last forever
I love the screams she made
My triumph my reign
