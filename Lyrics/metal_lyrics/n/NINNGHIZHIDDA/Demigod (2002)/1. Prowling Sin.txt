I prowl amongst the night,
With my beloved at my side,
Take me to places I've never been
Seduce me with her lascivious shape
Naked I bath in deepest sin,
Naked I bath deep within
Death do us part our bond is broken the wind disperse her fragrance
I remember the taste of her skin I remember everything
The gift of life is what I crave for the secret of death is what I claim for
I would bleed for an answer a whisper is all I hear
I yearn for the secret that's yet not revealed
an endless dark seance my incense before me,
All the mantras and spells invoking her with a pure heart
It will never fulfill what I desire and outmost admire
The end has no meaning for nothing remains
Prowl amongst the night,
With my beloved at my side,
Take me to places I've never been
Seduce me with her lascivious shape
Naked I bath in deepest sin,
Naked I bath deep within
