Burning horizons of grief and storms raging in my heart,
from sunset to sunrise, throughout the night,
I prowl at places, where we once kissed !!!!
Do you hear my hymns tonight,of ancient truth and broken sorrow
or (do) you walk a path,where my lament can't find you !!!!
My saviour my treasure, (you) drown all that hurts
Oblivion drinks my fears
Prepare to receive, the gifts of my might
beloved Mistress of the night
The everburning fire strengthen my desire
The starlight is dying with the veils of it's throne
Funeral winds turn back to thy realm
the moonlight kiss the ocean and dawn is close at hand
the rushing of the wind the sigh of the breeze
Oh powers of the night hear my demand
The flower, they carry away
had once been mine, mine...
Don`t leave me alone to crawl through the night,
in forlorn places I weep
I give you my heart, my life and my fears,
with my warm nectar that enters your womb !!!
Grant me the power to still the waves, that I might her her call
Ignite the flame that ever burns, that light the way to me
Sirens sing with ancient tongues, songs of feeble things have gone
Sirens sing with ancient tongues, songs of feeble things have gone
Do you hear my hymns tonight of ancient truth and broken sorrow
or (do) you walk a path, where my lament can't find you
