Majesty of the horns god of all gods
I stride at night the moon is my shelter
Into the depths I cry to you oh lord
The memories of our past rest in my dreams
I found the passage to the place once before
I don't need to be guided my way leads into the dark
I join the circle gathered for the feast
Whispering voices from down below
Immortal screams from far above
The chalice is passed I drunk the unholy water
Join the hands to summon the dead
Blasphemic prayers recitated by the priest
Rites to remember rites to forget
The ground moves thy breeze makes me shiver
Burning souls is what I smell
The divine splendour of the leathered wings
Blind my eyes trapped me in a spell
