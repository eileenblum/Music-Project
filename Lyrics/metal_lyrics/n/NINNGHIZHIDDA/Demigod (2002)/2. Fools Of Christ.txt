The fools of christ are blinded by a not existing light
The splendour af a realm that built on lies
Blessed are those who follow the rules of a false god
Your god your faith I spit on deny what the prey
Hiding their deepest desires in a veil of remorse
Swallow the sermons of the priest
ruled by thoughts of another mind
The only escape the choice they make
Hope is weak believer of the truth beyond every lie
Only the pure shall pass the gate
to the deceivers throne enlightment has failed
