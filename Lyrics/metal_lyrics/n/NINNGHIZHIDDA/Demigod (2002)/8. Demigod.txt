The root of all evil, the seed is sown
The reign of the ancient one, will be reborn
To forces of darkness we are sworn
Forces of darkness will return
The five pointed star is the key,to blasphemic unity
In desolate places our rites are performed
Infernal names are spoken
To forces of darkness we are sworn
Hail the arrival of our lord
The five pointed star is the key, to eternity
Demigod leader of the minions
Father satan let me fell your caress
Answer the cry of the servants, answer the cry of your servants
In desolate places our rites are performed
Infernal names are spoken
To forces of darkness we are sworn
Hail the arrival of our lord
The five pointed star is the key, to eternity
