Entombed in stone, disgusted by light
Of our lives once so bright
Silently I screamed, patiently I longed
For my afterlife to come

To this domain I'm reborn
From aeons that once were silent
yet they screamed to lead us there
In triumphal wrath and fury I conquered infinity

Pantheons of decay
With gates built of lifes
Nauseating lifes
Tremendous obscurity

Moonlight in chaos shone

Far beyond life's light I wander
In a desert of divinity
In this chaos I'm searching
searching for death everlasting

Pantheons of decay
With gates built of lifes
Nauseating lifes
Tremendous obscurity

As moonlight in chaos shone
My life passed before my eyelids closed
