A fiendish wind swept across
The landscapes of my mind
All emotions slain
No feelings for life remain

Towards infinity I walk carrying the keys
To Inferno and afterlife at hand

When moonrise is upon me
My attempts to pass seem to fail
Visions of the inverted
Elysium flashing by

Towards infinity I walk carrying the keys
To Inferno and afterlife at hand

Silent, shapeless
Untouchable for human lies
Dry-iced, limbonized
Are you trying to tell me there's another way to paradise?

Soul turning black burning death yearning death yearning death

Silent, shapeless
Invisible to human eyes
Humanized, paralyzed
Are you trying to show me a rousing sight of paradise?

I try to reach the end of the tunnel
But something, someone's holding me back
With a lingering grasp
Around my neck

I bear the sinful burden
