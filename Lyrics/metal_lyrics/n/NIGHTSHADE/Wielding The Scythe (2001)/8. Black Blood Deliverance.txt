Come forth to me you spinecrushing storm
Consume, enchant, possess me
Mistress of Death, demonic ruler of souls
Enslave me

Godless and with abominable splendour
She's thirsting and bleeding at dusk
An enigmatic demoness in mortal disguise
Unearthly living, exalted existance

In her veins runs the blood of uttermost blackness
With a taste bitter as death
In her veins runs the blood of uttermost blackness
With passion she bleeds

666

She takes us into realms of ecstacy
I'm drinking her poisoned blood, astral fluid so cold
My emotions are more intense than ever before
We are drawn towards the light of a new day
As our desires unite for the last time
In the mist of the dawn she's leaving me crying, begging...

Hell-realm majesty hear my calls
Filthy devil-queen by moonlight born
Astoreth, dreamlike possessor of mine
Sinfull demoness behold my anguish

Majesty set over ghouls, demonic ruler of souls
Give to me your blood, let me drink the venomous wine of sin

In her veins runs the blood of uttermost blackness
With a taste bitter as death
In her veins runs the blood of uttermost blackness
With passion she bleeds

Her emerald eyes tear my sanity and give birth to my pain
Frozen in mind, spirit and flesh, deserted by life itself
I perish
I'm dissolving my soul
