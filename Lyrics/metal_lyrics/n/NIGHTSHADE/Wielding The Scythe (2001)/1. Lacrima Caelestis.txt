When heaven cries

During these dark hours of the night
I gaze into the sky and its beings
But the stars of heaven are so pale
Due to the cloud that closes heavens eyes

The witnesses of the ancients
What great secrets they bear
Will I ever be able to reveal
Their knowledge and wisdom

I gaze into the sky once more
But the stars no longer bring forth their light
Due to the great black cloud
That makes heaven cry forever more

As the stars have lost their lustre
I realize there`s no purity in light
While my heart is turning black
In this realm of mourning fields

When heaven cries in these dark and doleful
But still so beautiful wastelands of grief
No light reflects in these endless creeks

I gaze into the sky once more
But the stars no longer bring forth their light
Due to the great black cloud
That makes heaven cry forever more

When heaven cries in these dark and doleful
But still so beautiful wastelands of solitude
I feel so pure, so wet, so cold...
Pure fucking darkness
