Dead seed is planted in the black soil of my heart
By death I'll be awaken, behold this repulsive art
Life has been rejected as if taken a step out of time
I find rejoice through suicide, I kiss this life good-bye

The gate is revealed to the second awakening

I know death a true friend of mine
I am through, reborn but dead
Entering a life of another kind

Dead seed is planted in the black soil of my heart
By death I'll be awaken, behold this repulsive art
Life has been rejected as if taken a step out of time
I find rejoice through suicide, I kiss this life good-bye

The gate is revealed to the second awakening

Shining steel through fragile veins
Exiled from sordid flesh

The gate is revealed to the second awakening

I know death a true friend of mine
I am through, reborn but dead
Entering a life of another kind
