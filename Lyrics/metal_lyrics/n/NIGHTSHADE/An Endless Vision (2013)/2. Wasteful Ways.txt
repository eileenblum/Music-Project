I had it all
Only thinking, I would have more
Letting go of the knot
This chain of desire
I wanted for so long
Waited for as I grew
All the nights spent with a grasp
Only to watch you wash away
Wishing for something like you
As the sky goes from night to day
Remembering if I had made the right choice
Only self-doubt consumes this body of mine
Fires burn within like a captured moment in time
If the past played in a different way
Who knows the man I would be today
Where did I go
I left this bond
Of the only person that I grew to know
I'm wishing for a new start
Watching you waste away had only left me torn apart
I wanted more
Skies are turning gray
I thought I moved on and started better days
Thought the reasons where good enough
Left with it all but you astray
Knowing nothing that was coming my way
It seems my ideas have got the best of me
Leaving me cold and lonely
This mind flustered and torn
Between the world and the world I loved
My head held tall when my back turned away from you
I realize what I did wrong
Wondering now if I ever knew what I had
The action was easy to accept at first
I would take it like the ocean does the sky
The distance can't keep me apart
The memories bring me right back to the fucking start
TO THE FUCKING START
I thought I would have more
Then watching you wash away
I HAD IT ALL
