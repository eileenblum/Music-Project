You said you want to be the one
All you do is waste my time
You don't realize the chance you've got
Choosing the most apathetic way
Thinking everything will come to you
Always complaining, using bullshit excuses
This is real, stop dreaming
Take control of your life
Without work nothing happens
Without the effort nothing becomes true
Your motivation, fuels the fire inside you
So stop talking and, choose what you want to do
I never said it will be easy
You got to go the distance
Let's find out your limit, see if your worth existence
So make a choice
Cause nobody can do it for yourself
So make a choice
And never give up until you succeed
