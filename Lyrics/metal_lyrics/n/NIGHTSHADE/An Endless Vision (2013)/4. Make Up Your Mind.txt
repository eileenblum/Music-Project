Walk out that fucking door
Like you always do
Always you but never true
Leave us with nothing
Just an empty sight
An empty home a bare heart
As you tear this world the fuck apart
Once again we have a new start
Do you feel like you have won?
Are you happy for?
ARE YOU HAPPY FOR?
What you have become
The feeling of being all alone
Now realizing you're on your own
An emotional time bomb
Clicks away
You were the one who made this a reality
You thought you would be better
But you were wrong
You thought you would be free
And forever gone
Even though you're not here anymore
I have risen above the problem
I have found the solution
Times were hard
But since you left I am stronger now
More than scared
Look in the mirror to find your own victim
I never thought you would be the liar
You have made
Congrats to you, you fooled us all
Now claim your prize with shame.
See what you have done
You can't finish
What you've begun
Life is short
Learn from the past
Now let's see how long you last
What choice do you take
Stay true to the one you make
What choice do you take
Stay true to the one you make
