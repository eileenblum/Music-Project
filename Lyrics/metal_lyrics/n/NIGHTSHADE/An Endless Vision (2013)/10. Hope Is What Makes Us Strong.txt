The world is fucked up
How can everything happen this day
Why the fuck is this supposed to be like this
The monsters are still living their lives
How are you supposed to go down that road
When after just one step someone you love falls
WHEN SOMEONE YOU LOVE FALLS
Burning a part of me
Makes me want to finish this life
Cancer or any other fucking decease
You can't really destroy
Trying in vain to keep them alive
To just be there for their last moments
The future is uncertain
So live each moment to the fullest
The future is uncertain
So live each moment to the fullest
TO IT'S FULLEST
All their souls are staying around us
For the rest of our life, tracing our way
They will always be in our heart
They wouldn't want to see us crying
We need to do our best every day for them
Please remind yourself of the best memories
Be strong, be strong, remember the best
Never forget them, they keep you alive
Their hand on your shoulder
Never too far away
Cause dying is just finally a word
JUST A WORD
Whoever they were
They will help you build your future
And be a part of this one
