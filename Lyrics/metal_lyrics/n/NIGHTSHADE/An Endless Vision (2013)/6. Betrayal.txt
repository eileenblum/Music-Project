You are blind in your own mind
The images fall right through you
Sit in front of your face you have no place
Like someone else is in the mirror.
The ground has lifted,
The sky has fallen,
Suffer for the time that's wasted.

Let the past slip through you
Could you live on with your lives
Why are you such a waste fucking waste
You are running out of time

Twisting sensation a halted transit within
A head of dilution we burn for his sin
This is not what we know, this is what we will learn,
This is not what we are, it's what we become

Fighting for nothing
When it's all in front of you.
Don't be the weak, don't be weak
You will never see right.
Think for your self
Only you can reveal the truth.

Question Everything
