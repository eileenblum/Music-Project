Youâre all just a waste of life!
â¨A wasted mind, wrapped in a sheetâ¨.
A blind path with the whispersâ¨.
Of a somatic idea straying you along.
â¨Like slaves of a bookâ¨.
What do you know, what do you believe in.
Followed with the training of the so called truth.
Letâs see the way.
â¨Prove how youâre all fucking wrong.
Keep believing you hold the power
Arrogance is the best advantage
â¨When you can't even see your own footsteps
This mess has to be destroyed along with the rest
Who can say what is right or wrong
â¨I will find out what I like best
The weak or the hungry
â¨Which mentality leads to a better doing
The shallow water is only bound to flood
Letâs watch you all fucking drown
Community grows along with our sight
Of the choices wrong and rightâ¨
We can't decide what others do
â¨With their own life
