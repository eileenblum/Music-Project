Forget the past
Forget the missed out days
The worn out memories
Awaken your minds
See through with your eyes
Find the truth
Look past all of the lies
Reaching for the gold
Always wanting more than simple
All of my time of freedom has been sold and gone.
Who would have thought
I would be the man I made
Only left with breathing for his final days
Sounds of silence are distorted and blank
It must have been fate
This can't slow me down
This is a new time a new chance
To become more then nothing
Be the one with the power
Have you under my influence
With each scream you make
Move around, shake the floor
Time has frozen but don't stop
Breathing becomes heavy
Within is hate
A face of angry expression
But the feeling is so great
As the people watch me grow tall
My fall will be the softest of them all
Fighting against the great
But that won't stop me
I just started this game
It must have been fate
This can't slow me down
