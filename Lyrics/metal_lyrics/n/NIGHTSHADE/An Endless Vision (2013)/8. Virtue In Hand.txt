This is the time!
Who are you
We drop the meaning
We destroyed the purpose
Nothing is right, this can't be right
They are the powerless
Yet they have the control
Minds split open
Sucking the meaning of life right out of us
Look at whats right in front of you!
This is okay as we dismember the truth
Right from your fucking tongue
Blood poring like the debt running from our eyes
You want the help but not the savior
Awakening the cracks through the seal.
Step by step come fourth
Let all stand in line for judgement
You did this, you are the reason
These feelings running through our hearts again
Our time is running out hurry up this must be done
Among us they will watch grabbing our hands
They will throw us away as if were nothing to them
These feelings running through our hearts
Time is running out
Hurry up this must be must be done
Among us they will watch.
Grabbing our hand
Throw us away as if we were nothing to them
These feelings running through our hearts again
Our time is running out hurry up this must be done
Among us they will watch grabbing our hands
They will throw us away as if were nothing to them
