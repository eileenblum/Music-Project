Stand up for what you believe in
Judgment is creation of mankind
What is right?
What is wrong?
Only you decide where you belong
Dreams can be a reality
As long as you are who you want to be
Days are short so what are you waiting for
Another day thinking is another day of waist
Search for what you're looking for
So you can take your creation and let it free
Stand for what you believe in
Stand strong for however long
Wake up for the time is right
Be strong to withstand the fight
Others will want to watch you burn
Let there be a lesson learned
But the ones who wanted to watch you fall
Can only be the biggest failures of all ideas of a man's mind
Is not to be judged by another but yourself
Find the reasons for life
Explorate everything
To find the light within
Stand for what you believe in
Stand strong for however long
Wake up for the time is right
Be strong to withstand the fight
