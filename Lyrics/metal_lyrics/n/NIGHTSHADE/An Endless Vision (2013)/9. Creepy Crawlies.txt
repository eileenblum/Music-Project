What will you do when were all out of time,
The planets align,
The stars show us
The air is still as we sink into the deep
We will sit and watch and weep
The final day has arrived we're all out of time
No dusk only dawn
The brighter light is upon us now
Feelings are bliss
What is there left to do
Take another swing but we missed and so will you
Only if we had knew
Reach for the sky asking why
Screaming to kill the silence and break the void
The answers are here with the only conclusion
But no image of the here and now,
The blind is now forbidden
They are alive creeping around
From up above and beneath the ground
Where they live can't be found
There's no chance to make a sound
