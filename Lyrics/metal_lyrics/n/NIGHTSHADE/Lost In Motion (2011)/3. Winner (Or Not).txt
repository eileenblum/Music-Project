Look at them, leaving.
And cry your soul out.
Promises don't make sense to you.
And your words don't mean a thing.
Always, it's all for you.
You'd like it better to watch them die.
As you are walking out the door,
These words will slip to the back of your mind.
Get on your knees like you always will,
And join the army of the unfulfilled.
Leave your heart pounding in your chest,
As the rest will grow.
This intricate plan in my head will
See to your failure in the end.
This intricate plan in my head will
See to your failure in the end.
You won't have a second chance,
Just your tears.
Not even one.
No one's around you anymore.
No hand, no chance to help.
You're from now on all alone,
In front of your remorses.
No one's around you anymore.
No hand, no chance to help.
You're from now on all alone,
In front of your remorses.
Fuck.
Rotting in our asphalt burial,
Smothering the precious flame.
The weak have blinded our wisdom,
Instilled the portrait's promise.
Conforming words consume our feeble minds alike,
Fueling the giant atrocity mutually.
Feel it moving
Your life is coming to an end.
