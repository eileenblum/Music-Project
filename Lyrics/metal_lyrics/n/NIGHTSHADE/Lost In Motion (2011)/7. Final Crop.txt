I can paint the sky,
I can reach for the stars,
I can feel them under my fingers.
My feet don't touch the ground.
I am flying,
Living in my dream.
It was meant to be.
It was meant to me.
I won't go alone.
The road to my fortune is now open to me.
If you wish to come to cancel all the pain,
If you believe in it as much as I do,
Then the road will be marvelous.
Let the weak burn down.
Let them rot on the ground.
Because we mean nothing to them.
With this soul of gold,
I can finish our goals.
Feel the light of the sun on our skin.
The energy of the gods.
Ourselves within,
Was the key to success from the start.
I pray for nothing.
I live for these dreams.
A collection of stars in our heads.
Ideas forged from thought alone.
Bleed.
Make some fucking noise.
