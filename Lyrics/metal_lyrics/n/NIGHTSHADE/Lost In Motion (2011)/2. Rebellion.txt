What you want?
What you need?
You wanna be better,
But there's poison in your veins.
You're not reliable.
You're weak,
And in your mind and looking for another way.
Your words are bullshit.
(Bullshit)
The words promised don't exist.
Your only wish is our failure.
We only can count on ourselves.
Having trust in no body.
You venerate me.
(You venerate me.)
I'm your god.
I'm your shield.
So implore me.
Get on your knees.
I'm free to decide.
(To decide)
Unleash the rage.
Crying my rebellion.
Unleash the rage.
Taken with me.
In my dreams,
My thoughts are burned alive.
I breathe alone,
Sanctified inside my head.
Forever to die alone.
Leave your heart yearning inside your chest.
Feelings will subside alive,
When the source is lost in time.
We'll see to the end of our kind.
Realize.
Burning in sin,
Our flames sanctify within.
The sweat drips off my face,
A blistering illness,
A scar on our hearts.
While the unworthy rest,
I'm free to decide,
And don't want to be like you all.
I live for my dream,
And it lives for me too.
He's my faith and leads my steps.
You don't deserve my attention,
And will never deserve it.
I'm alone in this war.
I'm alone in front of you,
But I'm not scared.
You're nothing to me.
You're nothing to me.
