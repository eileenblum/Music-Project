As his hands lay on my shoulder,
It inspires my confidence.
Sharing the same passion,
The same wishes.
One common goal.
One dream.
But his eyes are false.
His words sound so fucking faint.
Show me your hands.
Wipe out your soar lies,
And ask yourself.
There is no forgiving.
The faults are present.
And the future in front of my eyes.
From me you will receive nothing.
You're diluting yourself.
Here comes your reward.
Don't regret it.
You have deserved it all.
I will walk without you,
As I perceive the light.
You are slowly disappearing into a shade.
Your shadow is fading out the door.
Your shadow is fading out the door.
