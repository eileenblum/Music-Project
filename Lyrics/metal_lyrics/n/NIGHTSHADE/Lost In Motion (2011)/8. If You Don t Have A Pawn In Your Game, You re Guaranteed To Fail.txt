Dice are tossed.
The party can finally begin.
There's no place for failures; Betrayers.
The challenge is too important.
We are fitted with a weapon.
We have to fight to stay alive.
Mutual aid and motivation.
Cowardice and abandon.
Pawns will be sacrificed.
To achieve our goal,
Life's too short to be neglected.
Each second,
Each minute bust be sacred.
Fear must not exist.
You've signed a contract.
And it's up to you to stick to it.
You thought you were strong enough.
To encase all the shocks.
You can't achieve sight.
Against us we'll be the same.
We are immortals.
Ready to fight for our valor.
The same blood runs within our veins.
And this melody resonates in our heads.
Despite the people that surround us.
Despite the daily battles.
We fight for glory.
The decline does not relay.
The game's over to you.
(To you)
Nobody around to pick you up.
Destined to wander in doubt and fear.
Erased.
A king without a pawn.
You're dead.
Checkmate.
An old desire of mine.
A blank expression within.
To your hearts desire.
Your game is coming to an end.
The lines align.
Your life is in place.
Check mate my friend.
Your game is coming to an end.
Rest for now.
But your future shall bleed.
Your voice speaks your mind.
And you have nothing to say.
As all life ends.
Out greetings shall part.
Our farewells are true.
I still hate you.
Your soul's interlude.
You can't speak to me with
Mere words.
As out brain connects with electricity,
You cannot connect with intricacy.
A king without a pawn.
Check mate my friend.
Breathe until the end.
You say it's just enough.
Although you know it's not.
Check mate my friend.
Check mate my friend
Check mate my friend.
