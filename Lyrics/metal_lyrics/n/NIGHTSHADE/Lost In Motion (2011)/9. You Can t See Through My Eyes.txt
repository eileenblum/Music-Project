My quest has come to an end.
This long awaited goal is finally at lay.
With a heavy heart I make the choice of my life.
What I always dreamed about is you.
I know she will be fine.
I know she will forgive me.
It will be hard, it will be long,
But the better one will step out.
Our lives will be marvelous,
And the memories will be encased.
My eyes are begging me to stay,
My heart is asking me to let her go.
Because life wasn't made for every dream,
And so me require sacrifice.
My love for her is unprecedented.
Her body and mine make one.
But we will be together.
I wouldn't say âI love youâ enough times.
Not even wipe her tears.
I leave I run away Leaving behind everything
I've wished for the longest time you were my every line.
Regard less if this ends in tears,
You need to understand me.
Keep your head up high.

My heart still only beats for you.
Just know that now I'm a new man.
