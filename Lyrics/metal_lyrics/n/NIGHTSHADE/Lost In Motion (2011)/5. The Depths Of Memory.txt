Locked out in a far away past.
Confined in my pure memories.
Pulled out by the need of restart.
Again again.
The face of a disappeared
Period is behind me.
It never stops looking at me,
Fighting for our feeble minds.
It never stops.
My eyes are getting pierced by memories.
Where are these sweet memories?
Into the depths of our minds,
Our thoughts race at speeds unparalleled.
It speaks words so untrue cut into our thoughts.
This memory must die.
This memory must die.
This single thought remains,
Into the depths of memory.
Always turn back and regret.
To refuse,
I close my eyes,
And never want to go on that path.
Bitches like that.
Can you see it glow in the night?
I cry to my soul.
Make it all end.
Can you see my suffering?
My blood runs cold.
All I know is my fate.
Until the end this soul is blank.
Taking my heart to the end,
On our night make it all.
Through the fire I walk by day.
My flesh is melting,
Mental decay.
I try to reason myself.
Pain.
Truth is our lost memory.
