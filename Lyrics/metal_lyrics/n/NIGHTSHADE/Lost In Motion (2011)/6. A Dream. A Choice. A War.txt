My heart palpitates,
My hands tremble,
Everything seems unsettled to me.
Fear is coming.
What am I supposed to do?
Some say that destiny is inscribed in advance,
But I'll decide on mine despite the doubt.
Life is an everyday battle.
I won't drop anything.
I have to crush ones that want to break me down.
Pick up those who support me.
Your hands in ours.
Braving prejudice.
Our body is humble,
Our soul is pure.
They want to see us drown.
We will succeed by our hand.
We must carry on.
We always will be there to live our dreams,
Even if it has to be against the grain.
Against the grain.
