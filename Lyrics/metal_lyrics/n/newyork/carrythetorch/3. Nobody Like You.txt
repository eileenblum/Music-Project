Well, I travelled this country both far and wide had a million women by my side
Loved them in the East, loved them in the West searching for the one that suits me the best
Once in a while I thought I found the one only out for loving and some fun
Then one lonely night in a little old town you shook me up, and tore me down
I never had nobody like you nobody, had nobody like you

Well, I looked you over and it felt so good
I hoped that you might, and you said that you would
Nobody, had nobody like you
When you took me home you really gave it to me
It hurt so good I had to let it be
Nobody, had nobody like you
