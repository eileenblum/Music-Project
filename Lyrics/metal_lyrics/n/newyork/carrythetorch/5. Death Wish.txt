Daredevil, in your own right you're going down tonight look out
Death wish, coming on strong death wish, what went wrong
Death wish, here it comes again the Reaper always gets his man

You're feeling funny, but you don't know why there's a mist in your eyes
Death wish, coming on strong death wish, what went wrong
Death wish, here it comes again the Reaper always gets his man

You chase the dragon every night and pretty soon you're going to feel his bite
Death wish, coming on strong death wish, what went wrong
Death wish, here it comes again the Reaper always gets his man
