You think you've seen her so many times before you thought you knew her, when she walked through the door
But you were sadly mistaken, the love you have taken is all in vain and she leaves you wanting more
She's a teaser, with the same old line
You can't please her, you're wasting your time and she's gone

The times you've told her your love for her was real the times she's hurt you not caring how you feel
I'm telling you, you can't take it she's stolen your heart, now she'll break it and leave it never to heal
She's been teasing it's the same old game
With no reason, a face with no name and she's gone

You think you've seen her so many times before you thought you knew her, when she walked out the door
But you were sadly mistaken, the love she had taken is all in vain and she left you needing more
She's a teaser, with the same old line
You can't please her, she's blowing your mind and she's gone
