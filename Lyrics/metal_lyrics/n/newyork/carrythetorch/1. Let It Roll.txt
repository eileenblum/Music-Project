We hit the streets with the neon lights get ready tonight
We let it go when the feeling's right it's a Saturday night
Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll, tonight
Let it roll, let it roll it's a Saturday night

We're razor-sharp and we're ready to deal well, that's the way we feel
You couldn't stop us if you wanted to there's nothing you can do
Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll, tonight
Let it roll, let it roll it's a Saturday night

It's a Saturday night Saturday night, Saturday night all right
We are hot-wired and we are ready to go we are going to steal the show
We are overloaded donât you know we got to let it go 
Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll, tonight
Let it roll, let it roll it's a Saturday night
