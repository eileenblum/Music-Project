Is that a stranger, lying down below
If he could talk, what would he say
His face seems so familiar, like someone I should know
See him in the mirror everyday

I leave my mortal body, and drift up to the sky
My mind and soul are one now, as I begin to fly
The knowledge lies within me, to know what I should know
With only thoughts to guide me, the power only grows
Night Flyer

I am the moon, I am the stars, I am the speed of light
Racing through the heavens, flying low
My senses at their peak now, I pierce the dead of night
And leave the sleeping city far below

Is that a stranger, lying down below
If he could talk, what would he say
His face seems so familiar, like someone I should know
See him in the mirror everyday
