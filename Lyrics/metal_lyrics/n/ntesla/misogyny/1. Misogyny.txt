Autumn breath erased my calm
And brought back separation
Inside four walls it is so cold
I know my heart is frozen
Flowers on my window turned to dust so quickly
The fact that I have the last chance
It makes me sober

Sometimes fate blocks our ways
And we loose each other
Donât waste your time
Donât say goodbye
If you want to see her again

Going down becoming pale
Iâm your observation slave
My eyes are hostages of your
Incredibly attractive face
Iâm driven by obsession
It s just my life's engine
I recollect all the things we had
Our love and passion

Just so you know I wonât bring you down
I'll make myself better than ever
Just so you know the only one thing
I'll be right here with you

I twist my soul to the underside
But you reject my revelation
Your stupid ignorance kills me
Without any purpose
Donât hide yourself under this mask of cold indifference
Please donât make me wait for unbearable frustration
