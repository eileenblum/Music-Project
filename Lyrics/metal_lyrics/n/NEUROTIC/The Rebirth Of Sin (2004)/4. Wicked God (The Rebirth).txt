I'm the Temptation you can't resist
I'm everywhere hidden by mist
I'm mysterious, obscure
For me there is no cure
I'm the questions you're afraid to ask
I'm the answers you're refuse to listen
I'm the one who lives in your mind
I will be your best friend in a short time

My Sweet Angel,
So pure, so innocent
I am your only Fantasy
I'm your yearned Ecstasy
I'm the voice that calls you
I'm the one who comes for you
I'm the demon that once
You feared and now desire
You're only thought
Your heart is on Fire

I'm A Wicked God
Eternal, I can't die
You all fight in vain
This world is my domain

Just Surrender To My Charms
And In Rapture You'll born again
In a Reality Beyond Your Wildest dreams
You will relish the sweet taste of sin

Fallen Angel
Fallen from Grace
The Expression of Horror
Marked in your Face
Your screams of pain
Are all in vain
I laugh out high
As your innocence is erased

No one can face me
It's a War you can't win
In the new millennium I am Reborn
I am sin deified by mankind

I'm the Unholy paradise
Where God is deicide
I'm the immortal parasite
Through life and death side by side
You're souls are mine
Our destinies are entwined
I'm Your Master
You're my slaves
Weaklings
Forever in pain
