Religion blinds you
Consumes you from inside
It keeps you sane
Hiding the pain

It breathes, it lives
It Feeds of your Soul

Trapped in a unbreakable cage
Built of ignorance and lies
It can only be destroyed
If you open wide your eyes

Everyday you kneel and bow
To your God of repression and guilt
For salvation you must pray
As your life slowly slips away

A systematic denial of what is real
Self-Defense for Fear
A search for serenity
Leading To insanity

As your God dies
The Truth you realize
Now you burn in regret
Knowing Salvation Is Death

Your private World of Fear!!
