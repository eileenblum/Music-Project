All those words I repeatedly hear
Keep Rebounding Strongly in my Mind
And I wonder what could they means
Told by a ghost that I cannot See
They are being told to the undone
Crushed by The Hammer of Life
Doomed to Wonder inside my Mind
Lost in darkness Murdered by Greif
Where should I go when I'v chosen Dark
Where is the Salvation Promised to me
My life has made me see
Why can't Thee leave me be
Weeping eternally 
Deprived from my vanity 
In chained by those memories 
Prying for reality
Prying for salvation
Asking for some mercy
Why ? all this cruelty
Tormenting me Eternally
And in the light I can barely see
What the time has done to me
my path is clear and vengeance is sworn
I will rise inflamed to clad the sky
And the void will be clear
So are all my misery 
My path lays beyond the sky  
Up there where mystery lies 
And the pain has turned to anger my soul a blazed with flames
Unleashing all my hate upon those who made me die
Crossing to the realm of vengeance
Unloosing all my rage
Redemption at my hand
And the traitors fall
Destroying all in front me with passion in my heart
And the sword in my hand I shall behead my enemies
I shall devour their lives
Then walk among the stars
For there's lays my path
The path toward my freedom
Beyond behind the crimson gate
Of all the ancient wisdom
Of The Tainted Souls
And all the fading stars
Blinded by eternal rage
Forever seeking vengeance 
Lucid dream of salvation
Are the visions of his life
The rage was unleashed
From deep inside
