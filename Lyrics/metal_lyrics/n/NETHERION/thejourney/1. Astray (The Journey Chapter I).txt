As a walked through the forest 
Memories start Returning to me
And I see no deliverance
Or salvation 
The wind that blows in my eyes
Freezing the blood inside my veins
Cutting through my skin 
Freezing my soul
Lost in Darkness by my self
Alone on the road of my pains
Feeling remorse for everything 
Dying inside losing my sanity 
No one around can hear me
I am alone in my misery
I lay here between the ghost
Of my shredded memories
Eyeless faces is all I see
They keep moving around me
They are the ghosts of my life
Creeping around to torment me
Why must I suffer and feel this pain ?
And from the dark 
I can hear a voice
Calling my name
And the voice I shall seek 
And see what does she want from me
A voice so sweet in a Nightmare
I know that she won't hurt me
But the question is 
Will there will be a hope for me ?
Trembling deep in the dream 
To her voice I ran
Then a thunder Stroked sky
Every thing turned black
Now I know there's no hope
No way out for me
I scream in my pain
Seeking the light but the light is not there
No lord to answer my calls no one to help me
And the voice stopped calling me
This my life as always
I see a way out then I realize its just another pit
From now I'll embrace the pain
Embrace the suffering for it will lead to something new
Something creative
Another way to move along
Above the clouds lays my path
Towards the light towards the dark
Itâs the same
I feel no shame no regret no remorse
