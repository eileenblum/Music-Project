Awake 
Rise against the superstitions 
Legends and laws had been fabricated 
In order to rule the feeble minded 
With books filled with insincerity 
Feeding lies over centuries 
Separated in Communities 
And yet they fight free will with obduracy 
why ? 
wars was raised under the flag of the lie 
crusades and Missionaries 
killing each other for no reason 
slaves to your conceptions 
methods evolved while minds did not 
lock and load prepare for the attack 
why can't you open your eyes and see 
Sectarianism is ruling the earth 
Slay the Deceivers 
For every lie 
Slay the Deceivers 
For every lie 
Minds was conquered with deception 
And false promises of Deliverance 
methods evolved while minds did not 
Sectarianism is ruling the earth
