The world has drowned in the dark 
Comprehension in a lack 
Conceptions build on lies 
a truth you cannot deny 
thoughts are looming black 
chaos rule this land 
the shepherded turned his back 
the cattle lost and damned 
behold the Chronicles of hypocrisy 
values was built on profanity 
feeding the ignorance with heresy 
forcing slavery on humanity 
in denial trying to survive 
bound with the chains of slavery 
false promises seems endearing 
no salvation for humanity 
freedom Turned to blasphemy 
Enslaved 
Fear ... pain .. torment 
agony 
Always looking towards the sky 
Seeking salvation from above 
Eternally dreaming of paradise 
Wishing to see behind the skies 
Waste their lives for a myth 
Foolish shallow empty minds 
Forever live in fear and refuse to open their eyes 
Forever follow a dream that cannot be achieved 
Forever they will wait for a sign from the sky 
Forever they will be slaves for the Tyrants inside their minds
