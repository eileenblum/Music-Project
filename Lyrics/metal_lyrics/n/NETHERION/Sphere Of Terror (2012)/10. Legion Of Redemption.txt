From the depth of hell 
We rise again 
To kill those who manipulate 
To invade the ignorance 
With the knowledge 
Spending aeons without freedom 
Living in darkness and refusing to be 
Free and deprived of your own 
POWER 
We have come to scorn the earth 
Burn the lies and get revenge 
On the falsehood we are 
The possessors of the might 
Destroyer of the mighty alter 
Armed with logic and free will 
To declare a war against the hypocrites 
We are netherion 
Avatars of the vengeance 
Bringers of the demise 
Blood rain from the sky 
War against those who deceive 
to earn the control 
we are the legion of the freedom 
came from the void to enlighten ye 
and take ye away from thy 
woe 
arise 
We have come to scorn the earth 
Burn the lies and get revenge 
On the falsehood we are 
The possessors of the might 
Destroyer of the mighty alter 
Armed with logic and free will 
To declare a war against the hypocrites 
We are netherion 
Avatars of the vengeance 
Endlessly spinning in circles 
Born with dept to pay 
Endlessly they'll suck your blood 
Endlessly they'll take your lives 
Slaves to the law of the office 
The demons in suits are owning 
Now the time has come to rise 
Let your voices reach the sky 

Rise up from your pits 
Awake in this day for itâs the time to 
Get your redemption 
Claim all of your rights 
For once become the evil creation 
No help will come from above no sign from 
The architectures 
Strike with all your might 
To slay their corruption
