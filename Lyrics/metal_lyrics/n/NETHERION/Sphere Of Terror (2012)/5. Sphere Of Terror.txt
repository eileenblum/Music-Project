Dwell in darkness 
As the blood of reality was shed on the floor 
Forever torment 
In the prison of the ultimate demise trapped 
Lo and behold 
the masses was deprived of their logic and their lore 
false salvation 
was promised to those who prey to the lord 
superstition was made 
to enforce the holy order 
free will was cremated 
slavish existence was enforced 
see them all who stands around me 
all divided by the falsehood 
they were rated by their dogma 
slaughtered by the holy order 
walking blindly upon the earth 
forfeited was their minds 
lost in the sphere of terror 
drowned in their Misconception 
overwhelmed by the horror 
and the darkness of the abyss 
following the tyrants' order 
stunned by the worm of ignorance 
wasting their lives for a myth and the fear of the leaders 
choosing slavery upon the freedom to live by the will of the deceivers 
dreams was crushed needs was deprived by the order of the preachers 
lost in the sphere of terror and the legends of the makers 
Dwell in darkness 
As the blood of reality was shed on the floor 
Forever torment 
In the prison of the ultimate demise trapped 
Lo and behold 
the masses was deprived of their logic and their lore 
false salvation 
was promised to those who prey to the lord 
its time to be back to the nature 
and claim our own freedom 
our rights cannot be forsaken 
our will cannot be denied 
its time to escape from the 
overwhelming sphere of terror 
its time to control our lives 
its time to decide our fate
