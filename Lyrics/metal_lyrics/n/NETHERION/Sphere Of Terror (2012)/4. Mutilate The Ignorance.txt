Blindly following their conceptions 
Enslaved and succumbed to misconceptions 
Fooled and promised with salvation 
Tenacious minds hard to conquer 
I can see them wasting their lives 
I can see them walking blind 
Living like animals without will 
Driven by instincts without sense 
Blindly following their conceptions 
Ignorance just runs through their veins 
When will they awake from slumber ? 
When will they find the truth ? 
the time will come 
And revelation will unfold 
Redemption is at your hand 
Awake from your dreams 
arise and look at 
your world from 
a different view 
for you have been blinded for long 
its time to cast the lies out from your mind 
it is time to rise and defy the tyrant that lays inside your mind 
Embrace your life or fall reason 
hear my words and walk toward your freedom 
Living like animals without will 
Driven by instincts acting without sense 
Your Blind Beliefes 
Retards your Evolution 
ratefied in the delusions 
Of the divine illusion 
Blindly following their conceptions 
Enslaved and succumbed to misconceptions 
Fooled and promised with salvation 
Tenacious minds hard to conquer 
I can see them wasting their lives 
I can see them walking blind 
Living like animals without will 
Driven by instincts without sense 
When will they awake from their slumber ? 
When will they find the truth ? 
the time will come 
And revelation will unfold
