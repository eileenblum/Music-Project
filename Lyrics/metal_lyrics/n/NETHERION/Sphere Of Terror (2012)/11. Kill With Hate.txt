Feel the hatred turns and twist inside of me
It's time to come out and reach my surface
I'll look into the Eyes of my Enemies 
And aim straight at their souls 
My Hatred is my Weapon
i'll strike through the heart with no mercy
Let the fear consume those who tortured me
Hear there. screams and see them kneel 
In front of me
For I am the Reaper now
I am in control
And I will shed the blood 
On the ground
Because I have been waiting for so long
And now
Itâs the time to get my revenge
On those
Who cast my soul in depth of hell
And now 
Its their time to feel heat
The sound of an angry soul
Keep pounding between those walls
Speaking of nothing but the hate
And malice kept inside for a thousand years
Itâs the time to burst the flame
And spread my burning wings of hate
A perdition has come to life
The Beast Awakes from Slumber
And unleashes a battle Cry

See the flame burning all around the scene
Hear the screams Deafens who can hear
The deed is done and vengeance is sworn
You can't run for so long
The terror was unleashed
And blood will flow
See the flame burning all around the scene
Hear the screams Deafens who can hear
