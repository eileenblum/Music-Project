Feeling the darkness slowly taking you 
Feeling the pain and rage inside of you 
Doomed to die and no one can help you 
scream with hate but no one will hear you 
time to die and no way to escape 
time to be buried beneath this ground 
Pain and torment is all that awaits you 
the tide of darkness shall devour you with agony 
I hear your screams from deep within 
I feel your fear .. I see your tears 
I hear your screams from deep within 
I feel your fear .. I see your tears 
Do not scream no one can hear 
Do not fear or shed a tear 
Behold the scene that you can see 
Crucified and burned alive 
Blood on the unholy ground 
And the ghosts gathered around 
To take your soul To increase your pain 
Dare not to stand Or raise your head 
You will be Drowning forever more 
Falling now to end up by my side 
It is time to walk among the dead 
You are lost and domed forevermore 
To wonder the dimension of nether 
Where suffering become your last vision 
When the soul was ceased to be 
Eternal mourning â¦.you realty is your pain 
Eternal tormentâ¦.your wounds are open wide 
Eternal Darknessâ¦.. Imprisoned in your own cage 
Eternally Fallingâ¦..and drowning in your Abyss 
Eternal mourning â¦.you realty is your pain 
Eternal tormentâ¦.your wounds are open wide 
Eternal Darknessâ¦.. Imprisoned in your own cage 
Eternally Fallingâ¦..and drowning in your Abyss 
Feeling the darkness slowly taking you 
Feeling the pain and rage inside of you 
Doomed to die and no one can help you 
scream with hate but no one will hear you 
Impresioned in the Flames of perdition 
Feel to worms eating your flesh 
Feel the Reaper Claiming your soul 
Behold your last moments before the fall 
Embrace the last breath you can take 
The time has come for you to die 
Fall to End up by my side 
Eternal mourning â¦.you realty is your pain 
Eternal tormentâ¦.your wounds are open wide 
Eternal Darknessâ¦.. Imprisoned in your own cage 
Eternally Fallingâ¦..and drowning in your Abyss 
FALLâ¦. BURN â¦â¦DIE
