Living in deny still trying to breath 
cripled by their fear and cannot 
Wondering for ages searching for the creator 
Forgetting that we are born free 
Rejecting to live free 
embracing the preachers lie 
Closing their eyes walking blind 
on a path to a cold demise 
wondering why are you in pain 
Hearing only the cursed words 
Choose to be enslaved for life 
Deprived of their free will 
Drowned in the misconceptions 
Waiting for the resurrection 
In this fragile Construction 
infected by Deception 
Separated by a dogma 
that was made out from deceit 
Paralyzed by their fear 
paralyzed and cannot hear 
Sending our massage with logic while they forced their concepts with might 
We built the towers and reached the skies while they still marching around a stone 
we claimed this earth as our own and they surrender to the fear of the lord 
at the end they'll walk defeated with eyes on earth and head held low 
once 
I've seen a child 
start gazing into the stars 
Asking from where and why 
What lays behind the skies ?? 
Then his father came along and the vile book was held in his hand 
Son this universe was made by god he who created this land 
With those words he filled his mind killed the innocence with those lies 
Forced him towards the decline into the riddles of wasted times 
This is the curse of men refuse the truth and hold on to the unknown 
Believing in what we cannot see thinking we're free to be
