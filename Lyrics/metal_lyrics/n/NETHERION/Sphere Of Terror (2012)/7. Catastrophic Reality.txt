The truth was obliterated how can you see now 
Black ring on your eyes you have been placed in the dark 
and with mud you filled your ears can you hear me now 
Walking on the vile path your are doomed to die 
Living in the Fear of blasphemy believing the repeated lies 
Spreading like Cancer inside minds how will you survive 
I cast those lies out of my mind and shred the holy writes !!!! 
Look upon your lives and see the goodness of the light 
Drowning in famine 
living in pain 
Dying in sickness 
Rotting in faith 
Your souls in profanity 
Far from reality 
Without morality 
Gave away your sanity 
Salvation lays behind the door 
The door you once locked with your lack of comprehension 
With your childish dreams of the unknown 
And the key of that door 
Is burning the preachers conception 
With the knowledge flame 
Turn your backs to the mad shepherd 
And the truth will now come clear 
There's neither heaven nor hell 
No salvation in the sky 
sacrificing your selves 
only to be lost forever more 
trapped behind the mighty walls 
of the sonorous falsehood 
Defying sanity 
shielding your faith with obduracy 
Denying reality 
dubbing the freedom heresy 
the truth will now come clear 
There's neither heaven nor hell 
No salvation in the sky
