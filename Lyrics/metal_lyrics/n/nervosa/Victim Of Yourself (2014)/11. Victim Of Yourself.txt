The real you isn't what you show, you're not authentic
Blame others for your flaws. it's easier than admitting them

A lack inside, hidden by pride
Victim's the hurt child lying inside

Victim of yourself

It is the only way to get your needs' satisfaction
It is the only way you'll get attention
It is the only way you'll deserve compassion
It is the only way you can feel you're special

You think you're always right
Never swallow your pride
Don't admit you're wrong
Hurt the ones who love you

Created a safe, lunatic world to run from yourself
Afraid, you know you'll be alone when truth overcome the lies
(Your) freak attitudes will come back to you
Don't say you got nothing to do with the disgrace around you

It is the only way (you) play the kid forever
It is the only way you won't admit you're shallow
But beware you're creating your own prison
You'll only become crazy, faker and alone!
