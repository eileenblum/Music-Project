[Lyrics: Fernanda Lira / Music: Prika Amaral/ Fernanda Terra]
Â 
You cannot hide
Camera eyes are everywhere
Then you must lie
Cause "friends" are nothing but a mask
Â 
[Chorus]
Lock your mind
Invisible opression
Thougths' disguise
Invisible opression
Â 
Freedom of speech
Taken from you silently
There's no way left
Succumb to their dirty web of lies
Â
