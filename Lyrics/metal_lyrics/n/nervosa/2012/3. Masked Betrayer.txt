[Lyrics: Fernanda Lira / Musica: Nervosa]
Â 
Attention whore
Hate the way you selfish self comes out
Ya' hide it well
Pretend to be a saint behind your wall
Empty mind
Feed your jealousy with my disgrace
Empty life
Laugh at my despair through your mind games
Â 
A devil inside, you can't fool me, i know the real you
Your lies for me are useless, i know your mask will fall
Â 
[Chorus]
Stabs the back
Masked Betrayer
Integrity lack
Masked Betrayer
