[Lyrics: Prika Amaral / Music: Prika Amaral/ Fernanda Terra]
Â 
Civil war, internal chaos
The city is dominated
People flee, people die
Guilty and innocent
In a place without opportunities
In a place without hope
We can only wait for death
Â 
[Chorus]
Threatening reaction
Threatening respect
Cause an extremely keen sense of vengeance
Time of death
Time of death
Â 
Real life, real situation
Critical mind, critical obliteration
Real life, real situation
Critical mind, critical oblietarion
Â 
Insanely disturbing reality
Feeding a big freak show
Â 
Time of death
Time of death
Time of death
Time of death
Â
