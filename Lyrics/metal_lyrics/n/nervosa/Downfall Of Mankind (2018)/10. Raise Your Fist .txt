This one goes for the activists
This one goes for the militants
If you believe a cause, raise your fist!
If you believe equal rights, raise your fist!

Raise your fist!
Don't fear!

Unity!
Strength!
Fight!
Resist!

Dream of freedom
Dream of justice
Fight oppression
Fight for a change

History is shaped by those who takes a stand
And fight for change
Let them know they can't bring us down!

Raise your fist!
Don't fear!

March!
Protest!
Confront
Deny!
