Shadows moving in
Leaning over me

Paralyzed, no breath
Not tonight!
All darkness looks alive

Horror, Horrordome!

You know who we are
Let us in, let us in!

Hearing footsteps
Around my bed

Paralyzed, no breath
Oh, not tonight!
All darkness looks alive

Horror, Horrordome!

We came for a visit
And you know we'll never leave

Never, never, never, never!

Horror, Horrordome!
