The world made you ambitious
Working to create an inheritance

Your life needs to be a standard
Your time invested for wealth

You are completely blind

What do you want for your life?
What do you want for your fate?

It's fixed in your mind
You are not able to make
A dream come true

Afraid to leave the comfort zone
You are a prisoner of your happiness

Remorse will be your future

What do you want for your life?
What do you want for your fate?

Nonsense is keeping money for something
You're not sure you'll be alive
Alive!

Nothing is guaranteed, life can change
You have no control over future

Working for a lifetime

What do you want for your life?
What do you want for your fate?

And never living any dream?

Confict!
