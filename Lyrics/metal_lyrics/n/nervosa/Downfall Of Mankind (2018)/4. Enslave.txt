Why do we extinct?
Why do we exploit?
Why do we experiment?
In the name of welfare?

We keep the slaughter
We keep the abuse
We keep the torture
In the name of welfare

Why do we enslave?
Why do we enslave?

Nature's not a property
People are not tools
Creatures are no products
But violence is our rule

Why do we enslave?
Why do we enslave?

Damage, kill, destroy, kill

Doomed destructive race

We keep the slaughter
We keep the abuse
We keep the torture
In the name of welfare

Why do we enslave?
Why do we enslave?

Nature's not a property
People are not tools
Creatures are no products
But violence is our rule

Why do we enslave?
Why do we enslave?

Damage, kill, destroy, kill
