Blame the victims
Victimize the ones to blame
Exploit but feel exploited
When consequences make'em pay

Vicious circle
Equality in peace rests
Justice is only
A game of interests

Justice, says justice
We must be treated as equals
Justice, says justice
According to their needs
Justice, no justice
Same old privilege
Justice, no justice
The revocation of rights

Should your gender become a cage?
Should your race determine your rights?
Should religion determine your will?
Should your roots determine your wealth?

That's why I stay in the edge of society

And Justice For Whom?
And Justice For Whom?
