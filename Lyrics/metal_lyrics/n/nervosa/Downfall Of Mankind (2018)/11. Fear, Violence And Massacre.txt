Seed of hatred
Rooting deep
Rising hell

Taste of fright
Smell of threath
Terrorism everywhere

Religion, money, power
Foundations of war

Destruction, chaos, decay
The aftermath of war

Fear, violence, massacre
Fear, violence, massacre
Fear, violence, massacre
Fear, violence and massacre

The anguish suffocates
The end is coming

The illusion of fighting
For a greater good
Killing and dying
For nothing that's true
