Just for yourself
No remorse!
Your excuses are
Bigger than respect

Everything is about
Your own satisfaction
Your bad actions are
Justified by your good intentions

Selfish battle
Selfish battle

Everything is about
Your own satisfaction
Your bad actions are
Justified by your good intentions

Nobody feels guilty
Everybody fakes
Nobody cares
Everybody does the same

To keep your world safe
It's crucial to lie
To be selfish
Is to be alone

Selfish we are!

Metal!
