Burning inside of me
Panic in my head
Sorrowful thoughts
Drowned deep in misery

Hyperactive mind, no sleep
Stress so high, no life
Searching for escape, abyss
Crawling in grief, slavery

Bleeding, bleeding
Inside of me

Under pressure, madness trip
Maze of confusion, despair
Rolling in my bed, awake
Endless hours, killing time

Bleeding, bleeding
Inside of me

Voices in my head
Disturbing me

Degrading my sanity
Maze of torture
Infernal affliction
No escape from torment
