All we hear is an opinion not a fact
All we see is a perspective not the truth

no absolute truth
no absolute view

is it right to think what you think is right?
is it right to be inflexible to other minds?

Arrogance - no Arrogance

weakness disguised
lookout

a wise person is not the one who is always right
a wise person is the one who realizes

blinds into ignorance
blinds into intolerance

is it right to think what you think is right?
is it right to be inflexible to other minds?

Arrogance - no Arrogance

weakness disguised
lookout
arrogance
