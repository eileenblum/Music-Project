The dripping blood
The open wound
The blurred vision
The hours waiting

So many are even worse
There is no cure, no remedy

There's no remedy!

At the hospital we're hostages
Of public money we're hostages

Hospital! Hostages!
Hospital! Hostages!

Hostages!

The dripping blood
Pain dominating
Throbbing and constant
Strewn through the aisle

Neglect!
Contempt!
Suffering!
Torture!

There's no remedy!

At the hospital we're hostages
Of the government we're hostages

Hospital! Hostages!
Hospital! Hostages!

Hostages!
