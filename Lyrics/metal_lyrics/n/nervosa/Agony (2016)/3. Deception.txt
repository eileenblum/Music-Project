Trust of the innocent is liar's ally
Don't trust mirrors people are what they hide
Open your eyes a half truth is a whole lie
Inconvenient truth or reassuring lie?

A naked truth
Or a well-dressed lie?
An honest fool
Or a clever liar?

Fake words or decent actions?
Raw reality or hurtful deceptions?

No expectations, no deceptions
No expectations, no deceptions

No expectations, no deceptions
No expectations, no deceptions

A naked truth
Or a well-dressed lie?
An honest fool
Or a clever liar?
