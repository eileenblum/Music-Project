Devastation - I can't breathe
Devastation - no future
Devastation - killing innocents
Devastation - no life, no future

Cause we don't use intelligence in our favor
Cause we do use our feelings to fuel our selfishness

Devastation!
Devastation!

Devastation - I can't breathe
Devastation - no future
Devastation - killing innocents
Devastation - no life, no future

We don't know what will kill the world
But we keep on living, keep on making mistakes

Devastation!
Devastation!

Devastation - I can't breathe
Devastation - no future
Devastation - killing innocents
Devastation - no life, no future

We keep on spreading the disease
Even having reasoning in our favor

Devastation!
Devastation!

Devastation - I can't breathe
Devastation - no future
Devastation - killing innocents
Devastation - no life, no future

The world's epidemic
The plague of biodiversity
The cancer of the ecosystem
We are foolish intelligence

Devastation!
Devastation!
