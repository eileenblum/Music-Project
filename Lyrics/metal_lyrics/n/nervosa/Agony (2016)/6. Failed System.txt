No righteous way
Corruption is the new way
No honesty
Slave of the system's wheel

The system corrupts
Greed blinded good will
No way out!

Hard worker
The fuel for a system he gets
Nothing from
The powerful decide our fate!

A system with useless bureaucracy
A system with abusive taxes and fees
A system with low life quality
A system with lies to cover the shit

Failed system!
Failed system!

Failed system!
Failed system!

The system corrupts
Greed blinded good will
No way out!

Hard worker
The fuel for a system he gets
Nothing from
The powerful decide our fate!

A system with poor education patterns
A system with dying in hospital aisles
A system with crisis in all basic sectors
A system with no hope for those who need help

Failed system!
Failed system!

Failed system!
Failed system!

The money talks louder than principles
Ruined future
The country is rotten to the core

The system corrupts
Greed blinded good will
No way out!

Failed system!
Failed system!

Failed system!
Failed system!
