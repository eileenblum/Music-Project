So many times we think, we think, we think we have no choices
And we're always between the right and wrong
And all is left is to risk
We don't know where this path will lead
But no matter what your destiny is - you have to face it!

There may be rocks in your way
But you will need to use your force
And you will need to believe in your force

Wayfarer!
Wayfarer!

There may be rocks in your way
But you will need to use your force
And you will need to believe in your force

Wayfarer!
Wayfarer!

Sometimes the hardest thing is the right thing to do
You must take a chance or your life will never change
Because you are the choices you make
So give up, give in, give it all you got!
Life is nothing if you don't risk!
So do something today that your future self will thank you for
And hold on to your dreams not to your fears!
You are free to make your choices
But you ain't free to choose the consequences!
But have in mind if you win you will be fulfilled
If you lose you will be wiser!
