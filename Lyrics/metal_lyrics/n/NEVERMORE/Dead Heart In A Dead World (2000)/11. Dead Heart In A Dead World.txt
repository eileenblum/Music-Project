To see the last survivor fall
To see their bastards sons against the wall
To see the emptiness as we decay
I see the world is dead, I am betrayed

Dead heart in a dead world
Dead heart in a dead world

This rotten hole that I call home bled dry again
This lesion marked upon my soul
Left an empty hanging man

Across the fields, into the sea
To find the light from within
Out of this lake I've tried to crawl
I think I'm there and then again I fall
Again I fall

Burn your gods and kill the king
Subjugate your suffering
Dead heart, in a dead world

We must remember wounds so deep
Take time to heal
And sometimes though we struggle still
Life seems surreal

Emotions turned to cold dead wood
Can still have life once more
The door that slammed upon your heart
Torn away, torn away

Burn your gods and kill the king
Subjugate your suffering
Dead heart, in a dead world
Burn your gods and kill the king
Subjugate your suffering
Dead heart, in a dead world
Dead heart, in a dead world
