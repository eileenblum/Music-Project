[Bonus track]

We make you feel safe
When you feel warm
That's when I rise, that's when I crawl.
Gliding on mist, hardly a sound
Bringing the kiss, evil's abound
In the dead of night, love bites.
In the dead of night, love bites.
Into your room, where in deep sleep
There you lie still, to you I creep.
Then I descend, close to your lips
Across you I bend, you smile as I sip
Now you are mine, in my control
The taste of your life, and I own your soul
Softly you stir, gently you moan
Lust's in the air, awake as I groan
In the dead of night, love bites you
Invites you to feast in the night
Excites you, delights you
It drains you to white
Love bites.
You knew at first sight, you'd enjoy my attack
That with my first bite, there'd be no turning back
So come in my arms, I strike any hour
I will return to trap and devour.
In the dead of night, love bites.
In the dead of night, love bites.
In the dead of night, love bites.
In the dead of night, love bites.
Love bites.
Love bites.
Love bites.
