I am the poet
The prophet in the pit
Like a hollow-point bullet
Straight to the head
I never miss
You

Within the dark communion of self awareness
There lies a void called ego
An endless fusion of stillness and chaos
To bring its death can bring rebirth
I want to freeze the time
(dissolve into gray)
As we disintegrate the light
Let the rain come down,
Let the solitude surround
I want to change the lines
And purify the divide
Are we ever free or slaves to technology
Outside the fallen walls of pride and prejudice
There is a voice that speaks in circles
Empty illusions still fall before us
There is no future so profess your pain
