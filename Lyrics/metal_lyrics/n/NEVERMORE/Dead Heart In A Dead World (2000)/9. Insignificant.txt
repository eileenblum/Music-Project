Ours is not to question the reasons why
Crippled indecision repeats the path I once denied
Insignificant, am I?
The color of sundown, of crimson sky
The beauty that breaks down
And gives the day unto the night

[Chorus:]
And then one day you'll realize
Just a speck in the spectrum
Insignificant, am I?
And then one day you'll realize
The beauty that breaks down
Never knows the reason why

Scan my horizon as blue turns to black
The sky is gone again
And all beneath are born to die
Insignificant, am I?

[Chorus]

The brother of sundown
Has bleached away my past
To look into the sky
If only for one last time

[Chorus]

The brother of sundown has bleached away my past.
To look into the sky if only for one last time

[Chorus]
