Regret nothing, resistance is remorse
All feeling is to now be without consequence
Truth has become media controlled
Open wide and eat the worms of the enemy
Reality is distortion of perception
We are the enemy

There is no stronger drug than reality
Twist and change, time is nothing, regret everything

Young hearts are pure like violet drops of rain
Until life teaches us to be stoned or ashamed

There is no stronger drug than reality
We are the enemy
