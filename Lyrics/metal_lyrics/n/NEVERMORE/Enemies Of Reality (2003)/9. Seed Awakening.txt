There is no stronger drug than reality
Twist and change, time is nothing, regret everything

The execution solution, we're weeding out the weak
So condemn their revelations, the masses love the death show

We are cold when we are strong
In one breath we can still grow

We are cold when we are strong
In one breath we can still grow
These curious moments of shattered clarity
Stained sentient portraits of our damaged sanity

If this is our perdition, will you walk with me?
We are sentient shades of our subtle mortality

We are cold when we are strong
In one breath we can still grow
These curious moments of shattered clarity
Stained sentient portraits of our damaged sanity
Stained sentient portraits of our damaged sanity
