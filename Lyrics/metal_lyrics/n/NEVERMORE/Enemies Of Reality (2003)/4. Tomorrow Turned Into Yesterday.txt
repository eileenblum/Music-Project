Inside black decision concealing what no one knows but I
To regain the vision that my freewill once cast aside
Tomorrow Turned Into Yesterday
The sweet downhill sadness of our slow decay

Tomorrow Turned Into Yesterday
And I see the fault of the steps that I mislaid

Tonight the north wind spoke to the trees
And said, "Open your eyes"
Deep silver glimmer slither, drip down
And emoition dies, emotion dies

Tomorrow Turned Into Yesterday
And I see the fault in a chance that never was taken

Tomorrow turned, tomorrow's gone
But did we learn, where we went oh so wrong

Tomorrow Turned Into Yesterday
Tomorrow Turned Into Yesterday

Tomorrow turned, tomorrow's gone
But did we learn, where we went oh so wrong
Oh so wrong
