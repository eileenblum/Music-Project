Rise, rise, rise
Rise, rise, rise
Rise, rise, rise

What do you want from this world
What do you want from this life
what do you want from this season of sorrow
That's waiting to swallow the light

Rise, rise
From the poison

Rise, rise
To your throne

Rise, rise
From the poison

Rise, rise
To your throne

Your poison throne is obscuring,
The lesson required before the burning

What do you want from Humanity
Are we Hollowed and stained
Maybe we're all just useless
Or maybe we're all enslaved

Rise, Rise,
From the Poison

Rise, Rise
To your throne

Rise, Rise
From the poison

Rise Rise,
Assume your throne

Your poison throne is obscuring,
The lesson required before the burning

Sit upon your poison throne you little drone
Make your plans and shift your dreams
And smash them all to hell

[Solo]

Rise, rise, rise
Rise, rise, rise
Rise, rise, rise

Your poison throne is obscuring
The lesson required before the burning

Sit upon your poison throne You little drone
Make your plans and shift your dreams
And smash them all to hell
