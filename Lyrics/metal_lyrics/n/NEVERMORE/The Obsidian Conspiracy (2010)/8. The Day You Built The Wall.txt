I am the black lord
I am a slave
Our world is dying
We are all naÃ¯ve

I am the darkness
I am the grave
I am the voice you love to hate

Blame the world or blame yourself
Or just accept what cannot change

Your shameful burden burns into your skin
Suffer your sins

I am the black lord
I am a slave
You are the aftermath
The blue insane
You are the shamed
You are the drained
You cannot change the world
You cannot change

Blame the world or blame yourself
Or just accept what cannot change

Stack your stones with blood and bones
And build your wall of separation
Smash yourself and kill your friends
And build your wall of separation

The day you built the wall our world was dying
The day you built the wall you were the bastard

[Solo]

The day you built the wall our world was dying
The day you built the wall you were the bastard
