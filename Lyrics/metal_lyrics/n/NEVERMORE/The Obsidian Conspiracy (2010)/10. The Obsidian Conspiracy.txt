Blank in your selfish state
And enraged

Never should one die
That cannot decide the truth
Never should one cry
So suffer the children

The snakes arrive to assist and surround the stage
Black expression is force-fed rage

Create, and deny
Your subversive wings
The obsidian conspiracy is rising
Justify your shame
The obsidian conspiracy is rising

Regardless of the consequence
We drown inside our arrogance
We choose to bring our nameless
To this false place so shameless

Never should one die
That never could see absolute
Never should one cry
Let nothing destroy them

The blades align in indifference they feed the plague
This black agenda of hate is born of pain

Create, and deny
Your subversive wings
The obsidian conspiracy is rising
Justify your shame
The obsidian conspiracy is rising

The coming waves in silent rage
Will storm the sea of glass
And in its wake all the burnt remains

[Solo]

Never should one die
That cannot decide the truth
Never should one cry
So suffer the children

Create, and deny
Your subversive wings
The obsidian conspiracy is rising
Justify your shame
The obsidian conspiracy is rising
The drowning sage can't feed the silence
The firestorm can never be heard
These are my last words
