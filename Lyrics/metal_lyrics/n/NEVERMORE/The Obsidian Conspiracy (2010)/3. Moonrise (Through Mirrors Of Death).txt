Turn to the left, turn to the right
If you judge me for my faults
My soul searches for flight

Awake in my violent daydreams
I am lucid and torn
Asleep, dreaming in the netherworld
Obsessed and reborn

I feel the moonrise inside my head
I feel the consequence of everything you left unsaid
And now you're dead...

Is this soliloquy or psychosis
Or self-hypnosis

Burn to the right, turn to the left
If society won't accept you
You scream into the gray

Welcome to the underground
Welcome to your grave
Welcome to your beautiful mistake

I feel the moonrise inside my head
I feel the consequence of everything you left unsaid
And now we're dead...

[Solo]

Turn away from the light
Turn into the right
If you judge me for my faults
My soul searches for flight

Welcome to the underground
Welcome to your grave
Welcome to your beautiful mistake

I feel the moonrise inside my head
I feel the consequence of everything you left unsaid
And now we're dead...
