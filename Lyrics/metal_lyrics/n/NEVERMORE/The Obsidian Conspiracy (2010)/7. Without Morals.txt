Thread the path of sin and sorrow, swim into the red
If you slowly pull the noose
You choose to walk as if you're dead
Choke until you cannot feel
The pressure never ends

Without morals we wither
We might as well be gone
I believe in the other world
We cannot right our wrongs
If you lie to me, you slander me, this is why I hate you
Your petulant seed is a dying breed, this why I hate you
Scream into the grave

Unrelenting and unrepentant
Suffer guilt in shades
Choke until you cannot die
The lines refuse to bend

Without morals we wither
We might as well be gone
I believe in the other world
We cannot right our wrongs
If you lie to me, slander me, this is why I hate you
Your petulant seed is a dying breed, this why I hate you
If you lie to me, you slander me, this is why I hate you
You lie to me, you slander me
This is why I hate

[Solo]

Roll the dice, the plot device is fatality in disguise
Choke until you until cannot feel, the pressure never dies

Lie to me, slander me, this is why I hate you
Your petulant seed is a dying breed, this why I hate you
You lie to me, you slander me, this is why I hate you
You lie to me, you slander me
This is why I hate
