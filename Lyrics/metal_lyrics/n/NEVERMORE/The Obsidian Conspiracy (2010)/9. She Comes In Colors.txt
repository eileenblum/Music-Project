Destiny followed the sun and infinity bent
Into twilight's last slave, into the gray again

Until tomorrow, follow the sun
Until tomorrow, in your eyes

She comes to me in waves of shock until I'm drained
I accept her orders, I accept her pain
Until tomorrow, follow the sun
Until tomorrow, she comes in colors

She likes to play acid mind games
Within our faults and without blame

Until tomorrow, follow the sun
Until tomorrow, she comes in colors

She comes in colors and waves until I'm drained
She comes again

[Solo]

Until tomorrow, follow the sun
Until tomorrow, follow the sun
She comes, she comes in colors
She comes, she comes, she comes in colors
