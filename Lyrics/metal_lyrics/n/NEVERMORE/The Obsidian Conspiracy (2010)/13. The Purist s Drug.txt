[Japanese bonus track]

If murder is the purist's drug
And the needle is the new black
Take your steps carefully
Slip into the grey

The learning is still incompleted
No pressure
only lessons
Serve you still

Who do you follow
In a world so hollow?
The last of the flesh has been picked away
And we decay

Tell me something pure
Tell me the truth
In fractured future dreams
I am the used

If murder is the purist's drug
And the needle is the new black
Take your steps carefully
Slip into the grey

The learning is still incompleted
No pressure
only lessons
Serve you still

Who have you wasted
With your mistaste
And your velvet tongue

Who have you disgraced
And erased
With your lies

Tell me something pure
Tell me the truth
In fractured future dreams
I am the bruised

If murder is the purist's drug
And the needle is the new black
Take your steps carefully
Turn into the grey

The learning is still incompleted
No pressure
only lessons
Shall serve you still

Where is there sorrow
Within tomorrow
That never dies

Tell me something pure
Tell me the truth
In fractured future dreams
I am the used

If murder is the purist's drug
And the needle is the new black
Take your steps carefully
Slip into the grey

The learning is still incompleted
No pressure
only lessons
Shall serve you still
