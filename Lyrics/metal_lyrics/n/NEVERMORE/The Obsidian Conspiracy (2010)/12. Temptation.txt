[Bonus track]
[THE TEA PARTY cover]

Driven by restrained desire
I want what I need
Shacking as her sex takes hold
I've lost all control

Drowning in a sea of rage
I taste the embrace
Helpless as it steals my soul
I've lost all control

We exist in a world where the fear of
Illusion is real
And we cling to the past to deny and confuse
The ideal
Once inside, we can conceive and believe in a god
we can't feel

Destined by a fate so cruel
And drugged to delight
Laughing as these lies unfold
I've lost all control

Temptation
It never lets me down
Temptation
One foot in the ground
Temptation
You satisfy my soul
Temptation
I've lost all control
