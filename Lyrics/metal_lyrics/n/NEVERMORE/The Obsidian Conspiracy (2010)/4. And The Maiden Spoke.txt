She was born in 1617
She tasted like the wind always chasing her dreams

She was a tortured soul in pain
She whispered this dark refrain
"You're not alone, so never be afraid
We are the cold and beautiful, you are the blue insane"

Sometimes she moves the chairs downstairs, and runs away
Sometimes she makes yourself known to those unawake

And the Maiden spoke
In stuttered streams
As if her soul was dead
She spoke of nothing

She is the infinite
She is the deranged
Her sorrow drips the blood
Of the unfortunate and pained

She was a shameless soul stranded in the rain
Her redemption never came, as she slowly went insane

Sometimes she whispers in my ear
"There's nothing to be afraid of"
Sometimes she moves the chairs downstairs

And the Maiden spoke
In stuttered streams
As if her soul was gone
She spoke from the land beyond

And the maiden spoke to me

[Solo]

Sometimes you whispers in my ears
"There's nothing to be afraid of"
Sometimes you moves the chairs downstairs

And the Maiden spoke
Inside my shattered dreams
As if her soul was gone
She spoke of the land beyond

She was just another system slave
Just another system slave
Being led to the grave
