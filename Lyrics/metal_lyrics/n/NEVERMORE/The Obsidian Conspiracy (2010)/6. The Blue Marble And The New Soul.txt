Welcome to planet Earth

Tread your steps carefully
For the ground can twist and turn

Tread your steps carefully
For the ground may twist and turn
Choose your friends wisely
For just when you think you know someone
They could abandon you with scorn
Oh little one

Your mother will hold you in her arms
Your father will teach you his dignity and charm

Welcome to planet hate, to this emotion that I berate
Yet some people force me to feed my violent seed
What have we become, the damage remains and cannot be undone
Oh little one
Your brother may stab you in the back and laugh
Your sister will love you unconditionally as all love should be

What have we become, the damage remains and cannot be undone

[Solo]

Stare into the sky with newborn perfect eyes oh little one enjoy your time
There will be heartache there will be rain and joy I can't explain
My precious little one explore your time

Your mother will hold you in her arms and smile
Your father will teach you his dignity and charm
