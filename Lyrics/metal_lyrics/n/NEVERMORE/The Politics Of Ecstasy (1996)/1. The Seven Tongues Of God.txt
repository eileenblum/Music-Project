Every man will ask the questions, and every man will suffer blame and loss
Every day you die a little, understand the change
and choose your path without disdain
The seven tongues of god are in my mind, they speak to me in ancient DNA design
I have never seen god, you have never seen god
And when they speak to me and the seven tongues align
programmed to desecrate the pretensions in your mind
To further complicate I will now state that your convictions lack definition and form
Every day there is a bleeding , every time I watch the world slip by
Focus, the blind pretension underscoring pain, the path to solace felt in vain
The seven tongues of god are in my mind, they speak to me in ancient DNA design
I have never seen god, you have never seen god
And when they speak to me and the seven tongues align
programmed to desecrate the pretensions in your mind
to further complicate I will now state that your convictions lack definition
And when they speak to me and the seven tongues align
programmed to desecrate the pretensions in your mind
To further complicate I will now state that your convictions lack definition and form
To see the light is the purest form of reward
