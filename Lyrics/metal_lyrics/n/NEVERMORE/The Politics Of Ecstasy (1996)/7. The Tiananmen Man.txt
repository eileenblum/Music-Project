On june fifth, in the year of eighty-nine, he was unarmed with focused mind
Deflance glared down the barrel of the gun pointed from a tank in tiananmen square
And he stood there:
To control, to manipulate, the media his power slave
He knew the world was watching, knew he had a plan
To confront the powerful tyranny in the square of tiananmen
Ecstatic youth played with fire, freedom wash over them
Democracy their desire, the tiananmen man had a plan
Manipulate the media
He used blind faith in the face of anarchy, the cybernetic rapture has begun to envelop me
Freedom is the rush, adrenaline high, choice of the oppressed wiling to die
Like a hostage the government holds your drug
To control, to manipulate, the media his power slave
He knew the world was watching, knew he had a plan
To confront the powerful tyranny in the square of tiananmen
Ecstatic youth played with fire, freedom wash over them
Democracy their desire, the tiananmen man had a plan
Manipulate the media
His act was a cybernetic gesture
His act was a cybernetic gesture
He knew the world was watching, knew he had a plan
To confront the powerful tyranny in the square of tiananmen
Ecstatic youth played with fire, freedom wash over them
Democracy their desire, the tiananmen man had a plan
Manipulate the media, manipulate the media
Manipulate to control
