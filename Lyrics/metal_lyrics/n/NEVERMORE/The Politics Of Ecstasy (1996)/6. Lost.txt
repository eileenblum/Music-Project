Learning ways to fly, just never too high to die, pushing limits into the ground
Until I never come down
Burning through lifetimes without form, pure energy I am the shattered norm
I'm the lost one chasing colors to the sun, colors bleed but never fade
I'll just fade away
To swim these sentient seas, windows into eternity, never afraid to scale the wall
The lunatic never falls
Forfeiture of reality seeds sown, constructure of this path is not my own
I'm the lost one chasing colors to the sun, colors bleed but never fade
I'll just fade away
Why should I come down? From here I can see forever:
I'm the lost one chasing colors to the sun, colors bleed but never fade
I'll just fade away
Remember in the end, such a long strange trip it's been, so I sing this song
For the lost one
Why should I come down? From here I can see forever forever
I can see forever, I can see
