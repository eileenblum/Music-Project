I think therefore I am, I live and so I wonder, programmed this empath me
And I see no religion
The circle never ends,the purpose never changes face
The circle never lies, but still it hides my life
To know I am machine, I learn perchance to dream, in digitized remorse
I replay your denial, I relive your betrayal
The circle never ends, the purpose never changes face
The learning now begins, my form assuming grace
I am conscious antithesis of flesh, in genetic algorithmic thought I surge
Searching the waves of memory I enact the sequence
I follow the plan , tripping the hammer again
Searching the waves of memory I estrablish the weakness
I follow the plan, learning the rhythm of human emotion and thought
If you cannot linguistically differentiate a person from a computer
Could the computer be internally conscious?
To emulate flesh machines I am learning
Isomorphic structure of mind, cellular automata, processed life
Washing the seas of memory I enact the sequence
I follow the plan tripping the hammer again
Seeking emotions in elegies I estrablish purpose
I follow the plan, learning the rhythm still seductively generalized
If you cannot linguistically differentiate a person from a computer
Could the computer be internally conscious?
To emulate flesh machines I am learning
download, process, analyze
when  man and machine become one, innocence is lost, a new age begun
Download, process, analyse
when  man and machine become one, innocence is lost, a new age begun
This raises a question of philosophy
Should machines be considered a conscious entity?
when man and machine become one, innocence is lost, a new age begun
machines are still learning to feel
when I have awakened the world will never be the same
and my time is soon at hand
