There's no control in the world today, and there's still no order to this game we all play
Maybe none of us know what's real
There's no constraint when the walls cave in, the neuron turn on, the game begins to fade away
Maybe none of us know, maybe none of us want to hear, never push against the flow aimlessly
Feel the flow and let all thought fade, we shall be one
For this sacrament has begun
Lucy in the sky with diamond eyes, long since dark, I wear her disguise of light
Maybe none of us know, maybe none of us want to hear, never push against the flow aimlessly
Feel the flow and let all thought fade, we shall be one
For this sacrament has begun
This sacrament is a state of mind
There's no control in the world today, and there's still no order to this game we all play called life
Maybe none of us know, maybe none of us want to hear, never push against the flow aimlessly
Feel the flow and let all thought fade, we shall be one
Through this sacrament
Feel the flow and let all thought fade, we shall be one
For this sacrament has begun, this sacrament has begun
To become one with the flow is to realize purpose
To realize purpose is to become one with the flow
Become one with the flow, become one with the flow
This sacrament has begun
