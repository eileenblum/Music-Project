I am throes of my denial,logic in me crumbles,i take this fateful ride
Through my mind
Daydream fluid thoughts washing shores of warm confusion
I'm one with this beautiful disorder
Another world, wasthis the transition?
Slowly I returned to the familiar,spiralling in costant flux
What have I created?
The experiment is over
