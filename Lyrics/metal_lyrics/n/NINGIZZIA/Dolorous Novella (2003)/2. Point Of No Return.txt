My,
dismal soul,
eternally bleeding,
as I witness,
the falling mankind.

I cry for their sins,
eternal tears,
this hateful existance,
our final,
doom.

With tearfilled eyes,
I stare towards the sky,
my spirit free,
flies into obscurity,
obscurity.
body, degenerating,
ora, feeding my soul,
truth, revealed,
at last,
I,
am,
born.

Through the everlasting night among the stars I fly,
with the soaring eagle leaving my past behind,
the point of no,
return.

The whispering voice of my corpse on earth calls to me,
it wants me back,
spellbound by it's magic I start to fall,
the soaring eagle imprisoned in pain,
empty soul struggling,
again.

Destiny awaits,
the evil whispering voice,
it decays as it witnesses the revival of my soul,
of,
of my soul,
the,
point,
of no,
return.
