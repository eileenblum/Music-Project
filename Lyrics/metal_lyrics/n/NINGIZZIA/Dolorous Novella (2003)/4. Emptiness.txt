Rejected like the falling angel,
cast out from this life,
I am a victim of my desires,
a monument of my pain,
an empty shell devoid of  emotions,
in ivory black I am painted dead.

Enthralled by beuty,
yearning for bliss,
oh I sacrificed myself,
to fulfill my dreams,
I saw sun,
and I felt it's warmth,
and I reached out my hand,
to love and life,
embraced by melancholic euphony,
I knew,
I was at the mercy of the parasites,
like fallen fruit,
to be drained from life.

And I cried.

In the midst,
of my,
ebony meadows,
I was dancing with the dead,
I was lost,
in a strain of silence,
I was one with emptiness.

At the shore of the black sea,
where the birds are silent,
I cursed her name,
I saw the death of the sun,
I tasted the tears,
of heaven,
and I saw it all,
pass by.

Bleeding dry
loosing hope
I used to love
I used to care
now deprived from all that matters to me,
my words mean nothing
my emotions are dead
my dreams are empty,
if she only knew
oh, I wish she knew,
I close my eyes and I sigh.
