Between the remains of a sadistic ritual
The dead tries to get rid of me
In a moment of total confusion
A mystic strength takes my soul away

Visions about heaven, but it looks like slaughter
A terrible place where god seems to dwell
Doomed are the ones who are in this misery
They will only suffer a severe existence

Visions from behind the light
The nightmare will destroy all souls
There is no turning back
Visions from behind the light

...Neverending holocaust

The time has come to reject all forms of religion
And destroy the holiness till nothing is left over...

Visions about heaven, but it looks like slaughter
A terrible place where god seems to dwell
Doomed are the ones who are in this misery
They will only suffer a severe existence

Visions from behind the light
The nightmare will destroy all souls
There is no turning back
Visions from behind the light

Prophecies about the truce of the messiah
It all dies between a storm of fester
The religion suspect is becoming stronger
When you see what heaven is for real

The time has come to reject all forms of religion
And destroy the holiness till nothing is left over...
