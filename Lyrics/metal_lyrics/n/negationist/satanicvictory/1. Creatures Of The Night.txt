When the light fades away
And our candle burns out
When the wolves begin to howl
And our flesh becomes weak
The creatures of the night
Gather and unit
Fire shines out of their eyes
It is time to kill and sacrifice

Creatures of the night
Drinking blood from the mortal soul
Killing, hunting, destroying
With nocturnal might
Kill to survive, Blood is life

When the sun has lost his light
And darkness invades
Evil spirits rule tonight
Searching for their prey
The gather and unite
The creatures of the night
They crush with nocturnal might
They don't spare a life

When the sun has lost his light
And darkness invades
Evil spirits rule tonight
Searching for their prey
The gather and unite
The creatures of the night
They crush with nocturnal might
They don't spare a life

Creatures of the night
Drinking blood from the mortal soul
Killing, hunting, destroying
With nocturnal might
Kill to survive, Blood is life
