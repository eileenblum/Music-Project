Before the birth of chrisitianity
When the sword ruled the land
Pride and honour
The spirit of ancient times
Christianity came and took it all
Years of oppression went by
For all that has been done
In the past and the present
We will destroy the Christian deceiver

You betrayed me and many others
Now we betray you and break down your cross
We disgrace you and slap in your face
Turn your other cheek, so we can see you weep
Die you false pretender, feel the sword take your life
And remember our smile as we cut you in twice

Bow to us you liar, we are your crucifier
Your dying day has come, burn in our hell-fire

Christianity slayed down, it was meant to be
Satanic victory
Victory of life, victory of pride
Return of the ancient times

You betrayed me and many others
Now we betray you and break down your cross
We disgrace you and slap in your face
Turn your other cheek, so we can see you weep

Satanic Victory
