Captured by dark feelings
When hatred fills me up
Burning from inside
When darkness conquers the light

Feelings I cannot describe
When hatred takes over my life
Emotions of pure evil
As black as the night

Possessed by demonic thoughts
It is time to sacrifice
Evil breeds in me
It is no use to deny, it is no use to deny

Filled with flames, burn
Evil breeds inside of me, evil

Awakening at the burial ground
Lying on a nameless grave
Another victim has been made
Never it shall be found

Filled with flames, burn
Evil breeds inside of me, evil
