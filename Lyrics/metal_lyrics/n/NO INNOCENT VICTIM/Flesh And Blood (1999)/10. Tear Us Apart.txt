I will not
I will not deny the truth
I will not
I will not be chained
I will not
I will not deny the truth
I will not
Watch my soul decay
The truth that lies within me
You may choose to attack
But there is nothing you'd say or do
To make me ever go back
If I walked in my own strength
Maybe then you'd defeat my heart
But my life is in His hands now
Nothing can tear us apart
Tear us apart
Nothin can tear us
Tear us apart
