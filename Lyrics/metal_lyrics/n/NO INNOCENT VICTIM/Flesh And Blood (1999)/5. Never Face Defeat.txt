Once I fought on my own
And I couldn't stand being alone
Then one day I was found by the faithful and true
Who will fight right beside me
I'll never face defeat
I believed all your lies
Then truth's love opened my blind eyes
When I thought I was fighting for me and for mine
I was fighting for the other side
I'll never again face defeat
I defected from the world
I'll never again face defeat
Never again misguided
I'll never face defeat
A thousand armies you could send
I'll never face defeat
I know who wins in the end
I'll never face defeat
I might get knocked down but I'm winning the war
Won't listen to you no more
I might get knocked down but I'm winning the war
You will never even the score
I'll never face defeat!
