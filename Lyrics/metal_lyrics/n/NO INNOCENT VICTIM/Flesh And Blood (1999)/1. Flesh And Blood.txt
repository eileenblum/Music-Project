Can't you see our hearts
We don't come here to fight or settle score
So get it out of your head
That you'll finish it out there on the floor
We don't fight flesh and blood
We're fight spiritual powers
We don't fight flesh and blood
We're fighting the powers unseen
Why meddle in vain agruments
Our war's not against people or a man
But the spirit behind a dark agenda
Is the real battle that we have at hand
We're not here for a physical battle
We're not here for a fist hurling brawl
Our fight begins when we wake up every morning
And with His strength
Not ours
We will win this war
Flesh and blood- we don't fight
