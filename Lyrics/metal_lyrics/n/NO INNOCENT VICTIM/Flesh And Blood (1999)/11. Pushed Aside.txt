Brand new life
Traded away
For those games you play
Newness of life
Pushed aside
For the things you try and hide
No one sees you so you think
This double life that you now lead
You drag His name on through the mud
I don't understand how you think
Is it only lies you sell?
Because I can't tell
Make so I can't figure out
I'm not the one to worry about
I love you like a brother should
I just don't what I could say
We walked this over once before
And then you pushed me away
When I tried
You just pushed me aside
