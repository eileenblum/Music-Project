Some say that we should not be part of the hardcore scene
Whether you think what we say is right or wrong
This is where we belong
Never giving into pressure from the outside
Staying true to our convictions
Having been tested and tried
Hardcore family of equality?
No on viewed higher or less?
"doesn't matter who you are"
Unless it's Christ that I profess
I know you have stereotypes
Carved into your brain
Push them aside though we have differences
We have so much the same
I thought hardcore was about
Standing up for what you believe in
I thought hardcore was about
Standing up for what you believe in
'cause I would die tonight for my beliefs
