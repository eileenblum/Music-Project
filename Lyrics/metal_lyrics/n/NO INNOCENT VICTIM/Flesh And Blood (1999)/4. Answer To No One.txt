The only reason why
You're sucked into the lie
Because you don't want to see
Accountablility
Just live your life
The only way you find
A somewhat peace of mind
Blame your anxiety
On society
It's not your fault
Answer to no one, He's a myth and a crutch
Evolution not creation you've bought
But if there's a God then answer you will
For every single word and thought
Can you live with that
Can you live with that
Can you die with that
Can you live with yourself
