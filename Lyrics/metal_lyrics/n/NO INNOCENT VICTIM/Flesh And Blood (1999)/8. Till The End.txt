Running the race with endurance
Always pressing on toward the goal
I pace myself for the winning
Stopping only makes me grow cold
Sometimes I might trip
When I lose my footing
Or maybe when all my energy is gone
As the hard times come
And the hills get steeper
My minds say stop
But my heart says press on
Running the race with diligence
A main part helping me make it through
Always follow the straight and narrow
Encouraging others to run hard too
I'm not out to gain a prize
Life is like a race I run
Striving till the end
And hopefully hearing the words well done
