Pressures to the left of you
Hassles on the right
Pushing on through
The week with only one thing in sight
A time for you and friends to let it all out
No attitudes just energy
You know what I'm talking about...the floor is yours!
Rush the stage pile on
Grab the mic and sing along
Only one rule and I ask no more
Leave all the footballs at the door
This ain't about how hard you can hit or how many you knock down
No attitudes just energy my friends
Know what I'm talking about...the floor is yours!
It's your show let's tear this place down
I can't wait for the next show
I can't wait to play and I hope that all of you here all feel the same
