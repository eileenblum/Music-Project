The night sky, draped in black.
Overcome with hate, I yearn
for the end of the legacy of christ.

Clouds of war ...
are born.
Fear ...
overwhelms their thoughts.

Prophecies foretold this fate
for years unheard.
A hate that has bred
since the dawn of christ in man.

Shrouds of war ...
untorn.
Fear ...
will bring their fall.
