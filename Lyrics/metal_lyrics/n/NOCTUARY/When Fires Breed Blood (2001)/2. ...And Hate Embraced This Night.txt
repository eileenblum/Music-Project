Rejoice in hate
under storm cloud's rain.
A scourge in the eyes of god.
To regain strength once possessed
before the hands of faith
claimed their blood.

To enter this realm of dreams,
our time has come on Earth.
A vision so vast in lunacy.
Annihilate the words in stone.

And in your faith
you trust to save your soul,
to free your sins.
So when you fall
the reality of life becoming
Beyond comprehension.

They will not take.
I seek my soul reborn.
We are the thorns
piercing their minds.
