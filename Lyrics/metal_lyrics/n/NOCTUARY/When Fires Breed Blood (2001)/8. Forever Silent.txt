In the shadow of all past.
All the did exist, in end.
In life, we long to celebrate.
Virtue in shame relate.

In what the future lies
I seek Blasphemy Divine.
To bring our minds ... await
the birth of our blissful rage.

A falling star.
I gaze through this heart.
Again they seek, a power so weak.
For we can only observe,
to create and preserve,
this foundation we have built.
Upon our thrones we serve.
