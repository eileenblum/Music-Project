From the skies come forth,
soldiers of the night.
For years awaited the return
of the age before light.
Enslaved in mind, for centuries,
deceived in fear.
To bring forth the truth in all.

I call...
In this we hear the march of war.
We call...
to advance through the fog.
I call...
I call for you to teach my soul to fly
We call...
I fall again.

I beseech our fathers of forgotten wars
To tear their souls apart.
I died for years in thought
to hear the battles roar.

I call...
In this we hear the march of war.
We call...
to advance through the fog.
I call...
I call for you to teach my soul to fly
We call...
