Heed redemption to return.
Lies entombed, for years,
from scars we learn.

And I step back
from the seas so vast.
Again create.
Rape the laws
then receive thy honor.

Do sail on through mists and time
to bring the world the truth of life.
Not through this can they hear the call
of mind so free,
They are enslaved no more.
