Centuries have passed,
return to us the truth.
To avenge our past,
all that is holy destroyed.
Again they fall...
for that which is weak in mind,
is weak in all.

The rain now falls...
down below, victory is ours.
And on the Earth, the ravaged
weak now lay.
The searing cries of war
heard across this land.
The last of his children
have fallen.

...And in twilight,
we claim our world once more.
Now this black Earth
is ours to reign.

To crush their feeble ways,
Their holy war was lost.
this kingdom now ours.
No more deceit, no more lies.
