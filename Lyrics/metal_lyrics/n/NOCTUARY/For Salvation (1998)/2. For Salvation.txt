They die again, forever.
for god they lived to suffer.
Suffering for life, 
to die without a soul.

Remains of a dying light, 
the son, of one, was followed.
For years they suffered in pain, 
never healed by their faith, they die.

Wasting their lives, he brang
nothing more than pain.

In your eyes, your god, we kill.
In our souls a god never revealed.

His kingdom a wasted lie, 
to die you will all fall.
Reason beyond sight, 
a vision all will see.

Wasting their lives, he came
to destroy and force their hate.

To destroy the divine light, 
for god they suffer.
