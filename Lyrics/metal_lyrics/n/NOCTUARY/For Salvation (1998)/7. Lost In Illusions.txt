Behind reality I await to believe in trust.
Lies of infinate blindness thrown to the world.
Vengeance has taken in a form of destruction,
pain has brought fear in them to end all in haste

Now they cry for us to let them be.
Running from inevitable fate from words they made to truth.
Illusions of false reality taken back from lies, 
we return the truth to all hidden in them.
