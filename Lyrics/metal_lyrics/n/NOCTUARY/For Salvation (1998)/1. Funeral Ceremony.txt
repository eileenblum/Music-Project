Here now I lay, in this casket, so cold.
Embraced by darkness I die alone.
Overcome by fear I attempt my escape.
Alone I die, leaving forever.

Silence, Darkness, I weep for my soul.
Bleeding, it rises away.

I am dead, in my casket, so cold.
From above I close my eyes.
I fall unto eternity.
Endless pit of darkness encases me.

Silence, Darkness, I weep for my soul.
Bleeding, it rises away.

Falling through the endless darkness, 
frozen winds of the end I breathe.
