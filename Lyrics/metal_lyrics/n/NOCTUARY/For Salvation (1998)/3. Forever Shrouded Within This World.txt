In solitude, in desolation
I walk amoung this Earth.
Alone we crawl in the shadows
destined to thrive eternally.

Strength arise, my entity freed.
My mortality left behind.
Cries of life, forsaken by god.
I wander aimlessly.

Towards another light, 
the light of darkness.
Hope has arisen our eyes.
Prophecies behold new life.

Strength arise, our entities freed.
Our mortality left behind.
Cries of life, forsaken by god.
I wander aimlessly.
