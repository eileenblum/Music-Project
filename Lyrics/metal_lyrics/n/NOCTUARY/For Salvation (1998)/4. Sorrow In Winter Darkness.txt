Alone again, I move on.
In darkness purity dies.
Fathoms deep revive my soul.
The cold brings me life.

End return, 
bring to me emotions,
never again.
My tortured soul 
revealed to me
sorrow, eternally.

Breathe upon my soul, 
sorrow dies away. 
I call forth again,
to prove myself forever.

Again I find myself alone,
the black veil shrouds my eyes.
I know I don't belong, 
my soul, true, is gone.

Below I trust 
in darkness.
To tame my thoughts, 
untouched. 
Believed to be in black.

I await the coming, 
the truth unveiled.
With Winter's darkness
my final breath was gone.

Final my return, my end.
The darkness, brings me no pain.
The cold dies away.
Eternity brings me peace.
