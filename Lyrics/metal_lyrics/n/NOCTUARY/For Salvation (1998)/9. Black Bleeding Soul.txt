Release my soul
from a heart so cold
To emerge from pain, 
to become one with agony again.
I wander in this shell, 
my thoughts known only to me.
My soul torn in this world so cold.

Our thoughts torn apart.
In blackness and pain I arise.
My soul forever destroyed
my pains never revealed.

Agony, bring to me death
Sorrow, leave me
