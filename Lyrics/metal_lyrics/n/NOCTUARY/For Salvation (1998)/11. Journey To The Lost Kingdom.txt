Reborn again, I rise from my soul.
Journey to the landscapes of time.
Are laid to rest, the blackened souls.
Ancient wisdom, the kingdom beholds.

Desolate, these lands we dwell.
Bestow upon, the knowledge of gods.
Rising, to take the kingdom.
Tyranny, in this land forlorn.

Warriors rise, in this quest for knowledge.
Battlegrounds, bloodshed for victory.
Lives lost, in the name of our kingdom.
Victory shall be our fate.

Desolate, these lands we dwell.
Bestowe upon, the knowledge of gods.
Rising, to take the kingdom.
Tyranny, in this land forlorn.

Battles fought in the name of our kingdom.
Angst and agony, loyalty through blood.
Retribution in the face of death.
All was one, dead warriors march
