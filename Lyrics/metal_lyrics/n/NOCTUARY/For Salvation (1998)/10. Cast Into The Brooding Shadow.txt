Killed by the darkest light. 
In darkness my soul escapes.
To live as one with the shadow
to rise with all, our souls.

Their god has taken their thoughts
to forever lead them to blindness.
And when all their souls destroy them
our entities will reign.

Born into the blackest shadow.
In darkness our souls belong.
To live as one within
to rise with us our souls.

Their god has taken their thoughts
to forever lead them to blindness.
And when all their souls destroy them
our entities will reign.

Their blood has spilled upon us.
Our souls reigning forever.

They fought with weakness they lost
we killed with vengeance we won.

We have taken their thoughts
to forever lead them to darkness.
And when all of our souls are brought together
our entity reigns eternal
