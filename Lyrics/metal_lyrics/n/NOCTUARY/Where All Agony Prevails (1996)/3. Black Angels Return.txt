Writhing you. For I don't know. Of all the things ever lost. Rising, dying. 
Now I know. I am in my final chapter. I will avenge the life. Fall into the 
rising cold, To yearn for black angels return. The death I know too well. You 
gave me life, And for this I die by your blood. Heal the dying, frozen, alone 
again. Searching, where are you? I cannot see, And now I find, I must be 
wrong.
