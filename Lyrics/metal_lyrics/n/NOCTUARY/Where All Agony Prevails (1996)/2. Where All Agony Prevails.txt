Left to die among this Earth, My soul cannot escapeThis boundary of 
flesh...Screams of those among, my corpse still awaits (the coming of their 
god)How feeble thy man, Is it worth to die, For god and his lies.Fools to 
seek the light,Suffering in constant agony,Praying for something you'll never 
see,Preaching all those feeble lies,(of a never existing paradise)How feeble 
thy man, Is it worth to die, For god and his lies.Where all agony 
prevails,There is no hope.Where all corpses lie...Suffering eternally.
