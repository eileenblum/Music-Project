My dark lord, take me away...Parish amoung darkness, transcend into 
obliveon...Ancient words enchanting, I must die....Deep in the 
darkness,Beneath the black Earth, A valley of the forsaken, Never 
forgotten,Their immortal souls shall Reign again.Forever amoung my 
thoughts,These demons Call to me, Pulling my senses, Twisting my thoughts.I 
feel their rage. I know their hatred.My dark lord, take me away...Parish 
amoung darkness, transcend into obliveon...Ancient words enchanting, I must 
die....I call the forsaken ones, arise.My flesh is yours to live, My soul is 
yours to take.Free your vengeance,Take this Earth.Live once again.
