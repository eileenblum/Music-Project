I'm a loser, it's tearing me apart
But I've got some news,
I'm not going down this time
Wake up your fools 
'cause you don't stand a chance
If I stand or fall,
I'll rise no matter what

Doomsday's bells (Doomsday's bells)
Hear the prophe's word
You're a liar and a thief,
by my hands I'll make you kneel

Burn in hell, Burn in hell
By my hands I'll make you kneel

Choke on the pieces of your past
Nowhere to run, the luck will take it's turn

Doomsday's bells (Doomsday's bells)
Hear the prophe's word
You're a liar and a thief,
by my hands I'll make you kneel

Burn in hell, Burn in hell
By my rage and fury fall

Wake up, you fools don't stand a chance
If I should fall I'll rise again.
