Iâve rushed a million miles, havenât moved at all
Just like the rats, I will keep on going
Iâve severed all my ties, set up for my fall
And just like that, Iâm back at square one

Take me, somewhere
Wake me from this nightmare
Hear me, call out to the world

Someone, somewhere
Save me if I fall, youâll be my savior
Lead the way; I call out to the world

All these countless bugs, crawling in my skin
Iâm losing hope, and Iâm, going nowhere
Iâve heard a million lies; my patienceâs wearing thin
Up to my throat, and Iâve, heard it all before
