Father, father, help me
I have sinned again
I just killed my last friend, can I go, can I go?
Father please relieve me
From this cross I bear
Couldnât help myself, canât we let it be?

No, never again
Never the same, my friend
I owe my lesson learned
Never again
Iâll never crash and burn again, again, again

Father, father hear me
I am on my knees
And our dirty secrets, I wonât tell, I wonât tell
I got the shortest straw here
Youâre really nowhere near
To each his own, Iâm better off alone

Youâll never, youâll never learn
Just burn your bridges
Iâll never, Iâll never fall again
