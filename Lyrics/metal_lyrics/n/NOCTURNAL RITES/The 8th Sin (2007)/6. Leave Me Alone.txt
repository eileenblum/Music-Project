Name the sin, count me in
Remind me that weâre dreaming
Bleed me dry, then hang me high
And call me the fool that Iâve been

Hate this state that Iâm in

Cause weâre back
Weâre back to the same old story
Weâre back
So leave me alone, leave me alone again

Pour me out, run me down
And bore me till Iâm done for
Wash me up, say no more
Leave me whatâs left on the floor
