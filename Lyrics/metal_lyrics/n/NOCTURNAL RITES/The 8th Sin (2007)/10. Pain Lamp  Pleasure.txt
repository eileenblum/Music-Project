Hear you call for me
Itâs too late, canât you see?
Couldnât help, they spit on you, and called you fool
I believe it just slipped my mind
That I left you behind
I canât help, you died that day that I betrayed

On and onâ¦

Pain or pleasure
There is no distinction
You will see, someday
That pain is just one step away
Pain or pleasure
There is no distinction
Wish I could explain
That pleasure is equal to pain

I am over you
I keep telling myself
Couldnât help,
They made you plead,
Made you bleed
I am sorry for what they did
Wasnât me, god forbid
It hit me now, Iâm just like them,
Or worse somehow

Now youâre goneâ¦
