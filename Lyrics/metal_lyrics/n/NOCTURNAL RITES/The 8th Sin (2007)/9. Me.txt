One, just one more drink
One last cigarette and I am on my way
Oh last night, itâs all a haze
Here I pave my way through filth and broken glass

Something is not the same
Something is different from before
Guess that I, guess I died inside

When thereâs nothing more
When Iâd tried it all
Come undone, when the odds were close to none
When the momentâs there
The divide I beware
Then itâs me, only me

Torn, still torn and bruised
But Iâve had my run, and Iâll, Iâll see it through
All for you, my sweet farewell
Oh, I canât believe that I survived this hell
