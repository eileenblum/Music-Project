On this dead end road
You just sold yours souls
Buying in on what they told

High and mighty you
And your washed-out smiles
Tell me now, whoâs fooling who?

Wonât be afraid no more
Here you found what youâre looking for
Settle for less, round up the clowns,
Obliterate this mess

Say your prayers, little one
And tell me, yeah tell me
After all is said and done
Tell me now, tell me now

I see right through you
How you cry on cue
Thatâs just all youâve left to do
