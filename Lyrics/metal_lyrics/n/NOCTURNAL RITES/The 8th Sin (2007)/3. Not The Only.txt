Lying awake, alone in my bed
Voices are calling from inside my head
Youâd be surprised, if you knew what they really said

From my dark rooms, Iâve shut the world out
I hide from the word canât you see,
(itâs) too painful to talk about
Iâm not what I used to be

Some things we leave alone
And wish that weâd never known
And sometimes we go too far
To hide our scars

I am not the only,
The only one who runs
No, I am not the only one
And when itâs down
To wire we all run
Iâm not the only one

Break down the door;
Let in the light
Iâm not the same anymore,
I have to come clean you know
These loose ends just got to go
