Woke up today, no hope for tomorrow
What I thought would wash away
Needless to say, Iâd kind of lost my way
So Iâm right here, waiting

No more, no more
Wonât stop trying till I know Iâm alive
No way, no way
No denying till I come alive

I turned on a dime,
And counted my blessings
So no more wasting time
Wiped out the slate,
And finally turned the page
And Iâm right here, waiting

No, thought I still believe in nothing
Never crawling, never falling
Iâll never be like you
