Itâs time to go,
We know thereâs something calling
Thereâs nothing left out here at all, noâ¦
Weâre going crazy, itâs no illusion
Weâve had enough, so here we are

Who walks a thin line?
And whoâs running on the edge?
This time we know itâs real
Weâre falling face down, right into the ground

We are not like you, we are not the same
Not like the fools who follow and live their lives tomorrow
No, we are not like you, we are not the same
And so the story ends, we will never be like you

Weâve had enough, there must be something better
We turn our backs and walk away
Weâre getting tired, of all you liars
Weâve heard it all too many times
