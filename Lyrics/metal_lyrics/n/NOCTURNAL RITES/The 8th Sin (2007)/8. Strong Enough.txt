One bad seed in this filty gravel
One bad turn on this crocked road
Took me here, to this path I travel
Made me pay for what I owed

One black cloud on my silver lining
One bad turn that I canât through
Someone else when I look in the mirror
Someone new in the tainted glass

No, I canât stand it

Here I go, all alone
Itâs time I made it on my own
They tried to make me, tried to brake me
But Iâm strong enough

Tried to mold, shape and make me
On my back, like a bad tattoo
Here I am, still torn and ragged
Half a man, thatâll have to do
