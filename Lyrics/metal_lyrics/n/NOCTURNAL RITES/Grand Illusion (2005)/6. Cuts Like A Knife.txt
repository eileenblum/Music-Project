There it comes the ship of nails
Down the river it's setting sails
Now I see why they're all so pale

(I carry the dead and the bizarre, I am Naglfar)

What would you recommend?
Could you help me to comprehend?
Will this mean I'm forever condemned?

(Well, that's what you get for killing your best friend)

Don't get me wrong
I killed him all right,
But he stabbed me first
I'm not the one, but that's not the worst...

It cuts like a knife
(An eye for an eye)
It cuts like a knife
(I've come for your life)

I don't know, what to do
Can't you see what I'm going through?
Here I am, if I only knew

(I'm back to reign again)
