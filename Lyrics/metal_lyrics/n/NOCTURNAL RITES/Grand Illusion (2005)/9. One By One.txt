Ease the pain, no more dying
It's the answer that takes you higher
Just find your voice, that inner fire

Break the rules, and, point that finger
They're all trying to pull you down
Just walk up straight and let them know
You lost your faith

Never turn and walk away
Just spit back in their face
Forget those games they play

We're hungry
Until we come undone
We'll travel down
Those empty highways
There's no way
Before it all begun
We're falling one by one
One by one

No more fear, no more hunger
Let them know that it's all in vain
Now who are they to tell you
What to think and say?
