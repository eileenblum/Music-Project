Here we are, travelled on forever
Thought we had it all, never got that far
Carry on: tell us what we're fighting for
Free us from what we are

Why is nothing meant to last?

Forever and ever
Trying to leave it all behind
We're all afraid to walk away
Forever, wherever
Trying to find our peace of mind
Fighting for something undefined

Hollow one, on the edge of never
Thought you had it all, in the barrel of a gun
Point the way: shoot those blanks into the dark
Tell us we're moving on

In the future or the past?

Leave it all behind...
