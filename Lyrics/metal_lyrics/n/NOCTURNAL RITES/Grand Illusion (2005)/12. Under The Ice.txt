[Japanese bonus track]

The sinners are waiting in line at the doorway to hell
As they're rubbing their bellies and pushing the crap that they sell
Now send us your money and we'll give you blessings by mail
We're building empires and no one will stand in our way

And they know, you're walking the endless mile
Your colours are fading, the hangman they smile

Cause you're under the ice
And now you are fated to pay the price
While heaven is waiting
The sinners are laughing alone
You are under the ice
Just like the others have been before
While heaven is waiting
You're all going under the ice, again

Follow the masses, obey like you're puppets on strings
In the eyes of the world you are sacred, it's making us kings
