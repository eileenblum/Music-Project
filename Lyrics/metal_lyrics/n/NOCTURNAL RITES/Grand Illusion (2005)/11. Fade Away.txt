[Japanese bonus track]

Tell me who would not be weary
When hours turn to days
And all we are, just rats within a maze
So who justified the hero?
That broke out from this cage
Spoke to the madness, then left and burned the stage

Nothing can save us
We're fading away
No one can help us

Fade Away; we'll never be the same
Playing this foolish game
We're destined to fade away
There's nothing to reclaim
Playing this headless game
That's why we all fade away

When the hourglass is broken
And all is plain to see
That is when we're asking to be free

But It's all a grand illusion
It's already too late
Nothing can stop it, no, not even fate
