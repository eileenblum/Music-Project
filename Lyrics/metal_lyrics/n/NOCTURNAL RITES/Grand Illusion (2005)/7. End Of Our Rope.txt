I've been too blind to see
It's not the world I know
You promised me
But sometimes we hide
Who we really are
You say you're not sorry for all that you did,
For going too far

While we are trying harder,
Falling deeper
But we are only what we are

Nothing can help us from falling
Hoping we'd come to the fore
I'm not afraid, and I won't be
Your slave anymore
No one can stop us from trying
Hoping we'd settle the score
We're at the end of our rope
At the end of our rope

What's left to know on the other side?
Maybe it's time I rest my troubled mind
Well sometimes we fight
What will never die
Seems like we know that we're trying
Too hard, it's sucking us dry
