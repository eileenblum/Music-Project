Follow the light, do as they say
It's never ending
Unlock the beast you keep inside you

Swallow your breath, wait for the call
You'll walk the thin line
Welcome to our destiny

Do like the others
You won't be afraid
Fall to the ground and pray again

Never ending
They're all waiting for the call
One step away from it all
Never ending
Always trying, never finding
Shelter from the storm

Wake up the world, all playing god
Won't feel so hollow
The silent voice is there to guide you

Slipping away? Reach out your hand
They'll give you shelter
Welcome to eternity
