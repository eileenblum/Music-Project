I tried to leave you
But there you are
Feeding me your point of view
So why'd you come here
To smother me
When I can't make you disappear

And you, will never betray me anymore
It's true they say, that time will tell, what parts we play

Never trust a stranger
No more trials and endless wars
Never trust a stranger
Before your final day,
Then come what may

We did it your way
Now look at me
Then tell me what you really see
I know it kills you
And I don't care
I'd like to drag you down here too
