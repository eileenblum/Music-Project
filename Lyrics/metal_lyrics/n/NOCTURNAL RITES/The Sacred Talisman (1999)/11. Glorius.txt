My hands are tied here, in the darkness
I'll never find out what went wrong
I'm being punished, and sent to die
These cold and icy walls will end my life

In the dungeon where the holy rule
Can someone ever ease the cross I bear

And my death will be Glorius
When my mission is done
And my death will be glorious
My task is complete, my journey will come to end

Their fate control them, I'll never loose
Te chains will hold me, hold me to the ground
I hold the answer, inside my mind
But in this prison I'll see the end
