[japanese bonus]

In the fire
Where the fallen await
Blinded to all of its glory
See the fear, in the eyes of the dead
The circle's to close once again

Close you eyes for a dying world
Death's command won't betray

[chorus]
Hell, calls
A cry from the new world
The dream lasts forever
Man, falls
Into the unknown
The new generation

Hear the silence, the process of death
The mind is an opening grave
No denial, the blood turns to black
No giving in to repent

Close you eyes for a dying world
Death's command won't betray

[chorus]

Mind torture, flames burst
Cast into the fire
Act of death, stop breathing
Machines will take control

Close you eyes for a dying world
Death's command won't betray

[chorus x2]
