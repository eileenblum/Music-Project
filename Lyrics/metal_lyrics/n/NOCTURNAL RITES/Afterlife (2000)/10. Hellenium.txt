See them as they come, from blackened sun
Riding'cross the sky
Fear you'll be the one, hunted on the run
A refugee in mind

Dream that this blessing
Will lead you into the light
Blessed by the devil's kiss
Revealing the entrance to hell of night

Hell of night

Stare into the dark, don't look upon the face
Hiding in the night
Degenerated soul, fear it's your disgrace
Lost inside yourself
