I never thought I'd stand
On the edge of the world
Holding one foot off the ledge
And I can't believe I'd see
My life in reverse
Playing out inside my head

But I lost my compass
And went astray
Now I'm drowning in this hole

I'll come alive the day I know
I've rid all the demons inside
It never ends, it won't let go
'Til all of my shadows are dead
And then I'll face the ghost inside me

I never knew I'd crawl
To the ends of the Earth
On my bare and bloody knees
And now I'm numb, can't feel
Though I know that it hurts
Like a thousand knives in me

In my darkest hour
I can't wait
I just have to face it now

I'll come alive the day I know
I've rid all the demons inside
It never ends, it won't let go
'Til all of my shadows are dead
And then I'll face the ghost inside me

The ghost, the ghost (hey)
The ghost, the ghost (hey)
The ghost, the ghost (hey)
The ghost (hey)

I'll come alive the day I know
I've rid all the demons inside
It never ends, it won't let go
'Til all of my shadows are dead

(I'll come alive) come alive
(The day I know) the day I know
(Ah, ah)
It never ends, it won't let go
'Til all of my shadows are dead
And then I'll face the ghost inside me
