Let's go through my sins
Let's run down the list
Before I go

I cheated, I lied
I betrayed and I stole
I want you to know

Please
If you talk to God
'Bout the flaws, the failings
Where I went wrong
Can we keep this between us two?
This one little thing
I need to have told
Before I go

The meaningless sins
The life that I lived
It was ages ago

I've battled the guilt
I've paid what I owe
I need you to know

Please
Can we make a deal?
I beg, I plead
I'm on my knees
Can we keep this between us two?
If you do this for me
I'll trade you my soul
And I'll leave you alone
One secret to keep
Between you and me
Before I go
