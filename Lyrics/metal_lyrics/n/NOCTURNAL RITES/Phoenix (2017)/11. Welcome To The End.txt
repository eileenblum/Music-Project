Whoa, take a look at this troubled world
We, the people, that never learn
Just watch our nations burn

Now, with democracy overturned
On the news, have you not heard?
We're at the point, the point of no return
Ugh

Here is the retribution
We're gearing up for revolution
Line up at the barricades
We'll lead the way
We are the resolution
The end of all this destitution
Looks like destruction comes again
Welcome to the end

Oh, now the gutters are red with blood
And the bodies are piling up
Now we know that it's begun

No, public enemy number one
Making peace with a loaded gun
We're at the point, the point of no return

Here is the retribution
We're gearing up for revolution
Line up at the barricades
We'll lead the way
We are the resolution
The end of all this destitution
Looks like destruction comes again
Welcome to the end

Here is the retribution
We're gearing up for revolution
Line up at the barricades
We'll lead the way
We are the resolution
The end of all this destitution
Looks like destruction comes again
Welcome to the end
