Welcome to the new age
Where our views are warped and bent in shape
To fit the mold, the flavor of the day
All the numb and the pacified
It's a new world the stage is yours tonight
Sign up at the dotted line
Oh... come and join the ride

Can't someone save us
We just waste away
This is the new world
It's our darkest day
We keep on building fences
When freedom's up for sale
Can't someone save us
We just waste away

Look at all the righteous
Standing tall upon their own empires
The two-faced ones so good at faking smiles
Take a look at the games we play
Another headline all the world's stage
One more to fuel the hate
Oh... It's like we waste away

Can't someone save us
We just waste away
This is the new world
It's our darkest day
We keep on building fences
When freedom's up for sale
Can't someone save us
We just waste away

Can't someone save us
We just waste away
This is the new world
It's our darkest day
We keep on building fences
When freedom's up for sale
Can't someone save us
We just waste away

Just waste away
