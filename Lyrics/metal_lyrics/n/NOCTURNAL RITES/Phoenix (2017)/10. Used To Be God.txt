Look into the mirror
See someone else than me
Nothing but a poor excuse
Of who I used to be

Tell me how I got here
How I stooped this low
Tell me now, I need to know
Just shove it down my throat

What have I done?
What have I become?
Something I know that I'm not
I am one
And nothing in the world can save me now
That's tough when you used to be God

Said you'd be my savior
That you would not betray
Rewind me back to yesterday
And start me up again

What have I done?
What have I become?
Something I know that I'm not
I am one
And nothing in the world can save me now
That's tough when you used to be God

What have I done?
What have I become?
Something I know that I'm not
I am one
And nothing in the world can save me now
That's tough when you used to be God
