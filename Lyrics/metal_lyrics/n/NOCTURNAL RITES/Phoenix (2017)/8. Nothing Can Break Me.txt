Down this nowhere road I go
Trading pieces of my own soul
To highest bidders and lousy thieves
Who all want a piece of me

They try to break and hold me down
But I won't give in, no, I'll stand my ground
Wipe the slate, my head up high
I'll crawl back up again
Today I come alive

I break away
Let the world come down
Can't wait forever
Before I come undone
I'll pave my way
While my heart still beats
On the edge of never
Then the world will see
That nothing can break me

The weight I carry, the cross I bear
The thousand voices that I still hear
Reminding me of my every sin
The battle I can't win

They grab my throat and pull me down
Drag my face through the filthy mud
Wipe the slate, won't bend or break
I'll crawl back up again
Tomorrow starts today

I break away
Let the world come down
Can't wait forever
Before I come undone
I'll pave my way
While my heart still beats
On the edge of never
Then the world will see
That nothing can break me

I break away
Let the world come down
Can't wait forever
Before I come undone
I'll pave my way
While my heart still beats
On the edge of never
Then the world will see
That nothing can break me
Nothing can break me
