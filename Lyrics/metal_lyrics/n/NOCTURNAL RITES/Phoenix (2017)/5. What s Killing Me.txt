I can't breathe because of you
'Cause everything you do is choking me
You keep pulling on that rope
Like a leash 'round my neck, my neck

Still it's all I ever wanted
Every little drop of poison was my cure
When nothing is left to destroy
I want more, more

I can see finally
Now I know what's killing me

I'm falling
It's pulling on my soul
Something's awake in me
I'm calling
From now I'll walk alone
And nothing will stand in my way
'Cause now I know what's killing me

What am I supposed to do?
Now that everything I built is gone
And all of the things
I wanted are lost, lost

Where am I supposed to go now?
When every road I try leads right back again
And every drop of my blood
Was in vain, in vain

Now I know what's killing me

I'm falling
It's pulling on my soul
Something's awake in me
I'm calling
From now I'll walk alone
And nothing will stand in my way
'Cause now I know what's killing me

Now I know what's killing me

I'm falling
It's pulling on my soul
Something's awake in me
I'm calling
From now I'll walk alone
And nothing will stand in my way
Now I know what's killing me

(I'm falling)
(Something's awake in me)
(I'm calling)
From now I'll walk alone
And nothing will stand in my way
Now I know what's killing me

(Hey, hey, hey) you (hey, hey, hey)
