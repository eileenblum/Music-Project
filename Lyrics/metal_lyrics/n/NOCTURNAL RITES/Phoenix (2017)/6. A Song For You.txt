Tell me, did you ever fell
Like a ship way out at sea
Just waiting to go under?

Crashing waves, heavy rain
The wind is tearing up your sails
Like you sink into the water
Again and again and again

Here's a song for the ones
Everyone that come undone
The ones that stood their ground
Here's a song for the ones
Everyone that broke the mold
This song is just for you, you, you

Tell me why we're playing god
To cover up our flaws
What really makes us who we are

Must conform, get in line
Never break out from the norm
Pretend like you are someone else
Never, never, never

Here's a song for the ones
Everyone that come undone
The ones that stood their ground
Here's a song for the ones
Everyone that broke the mold
This song is just for you, you, you

Whoa, on this trail of broken halos
You pave your way and carry on
Whoa, though the world is on your shoulders
You carry on, carry on, carry on

This is for the ones
Who always chose to carry on

Here's a song for the ones
Everyone that come undone
The ones that stood their ground
Here's a song for the ones
Everyone that broke the mold
This song is just for you, you, you

(Here's a song for the ones)
This song is just for you
This song is just for you

Here's a song for the ones
Everyone that broke the mold
This song is just for you, you, you
Is just for you
