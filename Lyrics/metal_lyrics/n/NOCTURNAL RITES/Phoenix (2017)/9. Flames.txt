Today I met myself
On a road that lead to somewhere
Far away from here

I listened when I spoke
'Bout picking up my halo
The dues I owe

I know that I can turn around
But on I go somehow

Flames, burning brighter
Washing the daylight away
Flames, my world's on fire
A beacon to keep me astray
I light up in flames

When I close my eyes
I hear this lullaby
Repeating every night

About who I used to be
'Bout picking up the pieces
The little left of me

I know that I can turn around
But on I go somehow

Flames, burning brighter
Washing the daylight away
Flames, my world's on fire
A beacon to keep me astray
I light up in flames

Flames, burning brighter
Washing the daylight away
Flames, my world's on fire
A beacon to keep me astray
I light up in flames

(Flames burn)
I light up in flames
(Flames burn)
I light up in flames
