I
I'm digging my way
Down through the gravel
A hole to my grave

Death
Is coiled 'round my neck
Cheering me on
As I lower myself

Save me
I've lost my bearings
I'm falling free
Spare me
If you help me I swear I'll
I swear that I will repent my sins

You
You're the leech in my heart
The one that's been bleeding me
Dry from the start

And now
I'm knee deep in filth
Down in the quicksand
Against my own will

Save me
I've lost my bearings
I'm falling free
Spare me
If you help me I swear I'll
I swear that I will repent my sins

Save me
I've lost my bearings
I'm falling free

I will repent my sins

(Save me)
'Cause I've lost my bearings
I'm falling free
Spare me
If you help me I swear I'll
I swear that I will repent my sins
I will repent my sins
