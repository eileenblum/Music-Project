The world was growing colder
They watched from far away
How man was weakened still
In his final day
How fear became his shadow
The feeble lead the blind
Another hell begins
You're next in line

From here we see forever, this place is ours you know
Our time is drawing near

One nation, one world
And forevermore, into an everlasting war
One nation, one world
And we heard the call, the future lies within our hands

Another shiny empire
Of evil come divine
Built your house on sand, it's over now

Time has come at last
Killing fields, gone at last and forevermore
