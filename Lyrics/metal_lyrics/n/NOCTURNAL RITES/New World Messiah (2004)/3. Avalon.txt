In the void, long before time, the entity broke into five
The elements of life once came alive
Genesis, womb of the world, god of time
Bringer of all
Spring out of the dark, behold the light

Stand up in a land of flames
Gods at war, battle forevermore

Rise, Avalon
From the veil of mystery
The birth of time will soon begin
For all to see
Rise, Avalon
While tomorrow fades away
Welcome to the promised land
As all towers fall

Brave New World rise to the sky
The wonders of man crumble and fall
Man appointing Gods, unfold our fear
