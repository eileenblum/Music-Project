Don't ever run, and live a lie
Rise above it all
Spread your wings to fly

Don't ever climb, the ship of fools
Sailing on and on
Face the truth

Hear the cry, destiny calling you again
Point the way, allow you to fly away
Following the silent voice within

Break away, rise anew
By leaving the memory behind you
Break away, carry on
Only the strong will live on

Your darkest hour, the final day
Looks you in the eye
Turn and walk away

Blackened soul, a heart of stone
Clown behind the mask
Let it out
