The painting is fading now
The color's wearing thin
Her eyes in the broken glass
A stare that chills within
She cries only crimson tears
The eyes are burning with fire
Once beleived, made her strong
Once deceived made her wrong

Sorrow and pain
Closed her eyes to see through the unknown
Nothing's in vain, 'cuz the flame
The flame will ever die

The lines in her ashen face
Reveal a heart torn asunder
Twisted ones,bring the pain
Throw your first stone again
