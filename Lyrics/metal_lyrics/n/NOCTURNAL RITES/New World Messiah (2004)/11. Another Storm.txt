[Japanese Bonus Track]

I'ts getting hard to breathe, with a devil on my back
I''m tired, lost and confused
It feels like all is gone, I'm brought down to my knees
You pull me away without warning

My eyes are furious
But nothing is ever what it seems

Another storm is over
Make me see, or leave me be
Another storm is over
They're carving my name in stone
As I walk out into the storm

My mind's at war again, I'm waiting for the end
Tying to break out of here
It feels like all is lost, nothing to attain
It's always trying to drain me
