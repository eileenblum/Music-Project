Alone in a world of silence, I'm crawling in you
I won't ever betray your trust, feel me - I subdue
Trust you seek, and you'll find messiah
Take the stone 'round your neck away
Don't you ever display my fear
I'm yours - so come what may

Oh, and I opened the door
The cold's forevermore
So don't you see, you are your own enemy

So I'll fight, stand or fall
Choose my fate, feel how it's calling to us all
Stand or fall, the new world messiah
And the dawn of man

There are times when beckons to me,
Grips my throat and just pulls me in
Here I am but a shadow's worth, to wash away my sins
