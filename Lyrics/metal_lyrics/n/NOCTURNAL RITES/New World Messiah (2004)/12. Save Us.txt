[Japanese Bonus Track]

Here we are, a dying breed for ever more
Will we ever see the day?
Cast away, thrown into to the underworld
It's time to rise up from the dark and see the light

Save us, Save us
From this pain and misery, is this our destiny?
Save us, Save us
Chaos and despair, get us out of here

Silently, we close our eyes and meet again
Inside this prison full of souls
Wide awake, no one keeps this flame alive
We know we're trapped inside this hell forever more

Save us, Save us
From this pain and misery, is this our destiny?
Save us, Save us
Chaos and despair, get us out of here

Is there a light ahead, leading out here
Will we ever see the day?
It's coming closer now, the light begins to shift
Is this real or is it dream


Thanks to Izumi Maturika for sending tracks #11, #12 lyrics
