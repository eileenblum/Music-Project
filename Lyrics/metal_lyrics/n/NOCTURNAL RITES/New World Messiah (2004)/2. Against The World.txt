They taught him right and waht to believe
How to live by the rules
They all restrained his hungry heart
With time he would conceive

Walked the path of a righteous man
Taught him how to belong
A winding road, and now it seems

No, the world is on my shoulders
I'm the one against the world
The one they lead astray
But I'll know till my dying day
I'm the only one against the world

Never stray from our way of life
Vent your anger within
Betrayal, it makes a bitter man
The truth cuts like knives

Now look at him and what he's become
He still kneels for them all
A broken pawn, about to fall

There he stands alone again
While his world becomes unreal
Forever astray
