To wake and wipe the sweat away
Like so many times before
Pray to see the light of day
There's something wicked in us all
We meet inside our dreams
When awake we can't recall

No sleep till dawn
To wander endlessly, set us free
Twilight, dream time defines our glory
In silence we conquer it all
Midnight, dream time conceals the story
We're alive in a nightmare

His idle hands, when aware
We all chant the rhyme in fear
Speak the killing words again
Dream maker. sing your little tune
Make us dance to what you play
Dream time is coming soon
