Now the sky opens up before my eyes
The vision blinds me
On the bolts of fire cast upon the earth
Out, out of the void the riders come
Through hail and flashes
In the distance hear the seventh horn still sound

No one is innocent
No, I will return again

The sky divides in two
The final revelation
Out of the void, see the riders emerge
The prophec is true
The final revelation
Feel the fire, as it's cast upon the world

No ripples upon the sea of glass
The shrine is open
As I wait the final sacring of my soul
I, I open the scroll and know my fate
The peals of thunder
When I know the secret of the seven seals
