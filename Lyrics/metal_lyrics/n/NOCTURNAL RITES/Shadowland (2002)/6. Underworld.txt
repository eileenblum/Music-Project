An entity, living inside me
Scraped away, the flesh from my bones
Come on in and feel on my hunger
Welcome to my underworld
Come on in and lust in the darkness
Grasp away the skin from my face
Be the mask, defer to the master
I feel the lesion tainting me

Will the faces reader
Will the mask reveal
Will I bleed in splendour
How this silence is killing me
(In this silent underworld)

Don't defy, the mind is the altar
Raped away, in pretends to be me
Hollow soul, the beacon is fading
Welcome to the sin divide
Desecrate, the memories will haunt me
I am God, the festering wound
Empty eyes, a stare that still beckons
I feel its will, it's tempting me

Save my soul, give me peace
Let me through this hole, I'm dying
My soul is gone, you're killing me
