Another genocide, a masterplan foresaw the fall
A resurrection reversed
There's a brave new world, a soulless sphere that penetrates
It's the seal to our fate

Your gods have failed
Our will be done

The fiery chains that held but cut the fatal thread at last
Condemned eternities pass
Another motor spins, machinery of hate begins
And still crumbles and grinds

Black souls that seem unreal
Cold empty hearts
The formless hollow shells of man

Time, times of evil
The birth of chaos, regain of the earth
Time, times of evil
The birth of chaos reborn

The endless pain begins and torture breeds the suffering
Another destiny fades
A second sacrifice, a last revenge of human kind
Enslave the last one alive

Strapped to the offering god
The slaves of the earth
A blank stare is all that remains
Witness their birth
