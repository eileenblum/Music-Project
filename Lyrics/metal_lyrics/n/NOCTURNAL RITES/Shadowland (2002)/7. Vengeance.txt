Into the void, an image of nothing is fading
The venomous grey, dissolves into pieces of me
The carrion calls, entices the pest, they're falling
The Charon he waits
But no one can see the flames at sea

I'll have my vengeance
My kingdom come
I speak in silence
Last mind astray, lead me the way

Flames over ice, the visions are false
Wiat for my vengeance
See how it dies, outside the walls
The memory purged from my eyes
My vengeance calls

Aeons ignite, inflicting the visions forsaken
Begotten in sin
The womb holds the souls that will be
The ravenous hole, swallows the dirt it has taken
Even in death, a dead man is never free
