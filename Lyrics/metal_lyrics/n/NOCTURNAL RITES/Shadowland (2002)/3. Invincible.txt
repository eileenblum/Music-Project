Across the desert plains
They come as though invincible
Out of a fallen land they walk away
Over the shallow seas
With bleeding hands they carry on
Towards the distance in the open sea

New dawn raging
The whips and chains are one
Out of a land without a reign

They come as one, as one they go
Out of the wasteland
No one to fall, Invincible
They will return

Proclaim awakening
To hail a god perpetual
A war in heaven knows no victory
