Hear the calling
From the shadows in the deep
Won't surrender
We are standing at the edge
They call for arms and we'll stand our ground
It's neverending
When the power comes alive
Never falling
The truth is in our hearts
Rise up and stare the beast in the eyes

Wandering souls, never betray
The last of our kind, our eyes are ablaze

We'll never die
NEVER DIE
We're masters of the earth, coming alive
We'll never die
NEVER DIE
We're masters of eternity, fighting a world to be

Another aeon
And the endless sands of time
Everflowing
We rise above them all
Witch how the world turns into our throne
