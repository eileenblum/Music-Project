[lyrics by Bjoern Goosses]

I wanna walk these wounds until they shut their bloody mouths
I wanna cut my tongue until it speaks these words out loud
all I want is darkness, some total fucking darkness
all I want is darkness, forevermore
now walk with me, right through the wounds of black
I walk the wounds of darkness now and anywhere
I walk the wounds that I should wear
I wanna walk these scars until they draw their final breath
I wanna cut my throat until it spits the word of death
all I want is darkness, some total fucking darkness
all I want is darkness, forevermore
now walk with me, right through the wounds of black
now this is it, the very end of all things
I walk the wounds of darkness now and anywhere
I walk the wounds that I should wear
now walk with me, right through the wounds of black
now this is it, the very end of all things
now walk with me, right through the wounds of all youÂ´ll ever be
now this is it, join the neonecrononsensetrip
