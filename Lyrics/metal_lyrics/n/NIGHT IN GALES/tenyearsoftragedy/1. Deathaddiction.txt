[lyrics by Bjoern Goosses]

a handful of bloodrhymes and a dozen dead tongues, now this is how far we can get
a mouthful of napalm and a dozen dead songs, now this is how far things can get
call it a day and hope for decay
pure deathaddiction all through my head
a headful of hearselights and a dozen dead lies, now this is how far we can get
a heartful of nothing and a dozen dead cries, now this is how far things can get
call it a day and hope for decay
pure deathaddiction all through my head
deathaddiction through my veins my heart my head my damn remains
