[lyrics by Bjoern Goosses &amp; Jens Basten]

I am nailed at mouth and throat, this wormtaleÂ´s never been told
tombtrippinÂ´ through the dark, while I tear that sulphurharp
meet me, flamerainseeds, with branded skin, bled from light
this is where all our demons died
this the blackwormÂ´s ride, the plaguewormÂ´s night, the deathwormÂ´s fight
get killed or die trying, follow me...
get killed or die trying
some say itÂ´s the neverworld, a deadly word
they claim itÂ´s the word of the wrong, a word that rips the fuckinÂ´ tongue
meet me, flamerainseeds, with branded skin, bled from light
this is where all our demons died
this the blackwormÂ´s ride, the plaguewormÂ´s night, the deathwormÂ´s fight
get killed or die trying, follow me...
get killed or die trying
sundrugged worlds throwing poisonbolts
with blackened blood for a blackened birth
the planets are out of line, under morticiansÂ´ light
the planets lie mummified in time, itÂ´s a pussoaked madmouthnight
this the blackwormÂ´s ride, the plaguewormÂ´s night, the deathwormÂ´s fight
get killed or die trying, follow me...
get killed or die trying
