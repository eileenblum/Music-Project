when the lightning starts
thou shall dwell in tears
a serenade of cruelty
which teaches us how to bleed
we came down to touch the earth
now our tears fall
through the well of equilibrium

forlorn in this entity
between blackness and fear
the woods of my lightforsaken travesty
running with thorns in my flesh...
to reach the power of tranquillity
seemingly endless time

an eternal kiss
and the rain still falls
eyes blind and white
as the sky's clouds
the crown of pain is my blood
sardonic, sarcastic
like this fevering spirit by my side

everflaming
evershining
everlasting
eternal sunfire
flying skysoul...
like a spark in the crimson eclipse...
