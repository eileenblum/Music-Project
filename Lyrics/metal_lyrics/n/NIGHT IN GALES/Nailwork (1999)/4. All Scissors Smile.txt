woke up with a mouthful of planets
and a fistful of salt
some sundrugged words through that deadhead
and all scissors smiled
been out for more pulsedrivin' whoresound
spinning those cadavercircles
with a wormnail thru' my tongue
and all scissors smiled
heard the hearselights sing
watched the twisting saltwordsoil
ate all these inkscented things
and all scissors smiled
comin' down on the carboncaravan
within this orbcoroner's coil
saw necronauts and quasarmen
and all scissors smiled

silversonic solarblow
astrotrippin' slaughtershow
be it this word from the morgue
that makes my deathnectar flow

all scissors smile all scissors smile

silversonic solarblow
astrotrippin'slaughtershow
be it this word from the morgue
that makes my deathnectar flow

all scissors smile all scissors smile
