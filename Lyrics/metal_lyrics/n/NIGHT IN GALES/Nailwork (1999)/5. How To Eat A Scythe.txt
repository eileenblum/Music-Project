stardrugged upon that worm's back
the casketcrew is in for the show
of psychophonics from below

down the sunpus course
for a word of all that never was
stoke up the silvermouthmachine
and snatch its terrortongue with a grin
gonna give you some more killing ink
some more unlight
and i'll show you how to eat a scythe

throatkickin' bladefood at astrospeed

ink to rain and rain to ink
all planetflesh to poisonsoil

down the sunpus course
for a word of all that never was
stoke up the silvermouthmachine
and snatch its terrortongue with a grin
gonna give you some more killing ink
some more unlight
