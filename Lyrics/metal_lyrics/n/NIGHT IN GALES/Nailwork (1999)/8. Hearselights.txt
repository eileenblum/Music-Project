so now it's grinding time
for coroners' poisonrhymes
electric heads and snipersongs
something killing this way comes

diggin' the days, the words and all space

so now it's grinding time 
for coffinstalker's silverlines
whorefood and needletongues
something killing this way comes

diggin'the days, the words and all space

hearselights
eating songless flies
hearselights
somewhat rainscented tonight

so now it's grinding time
for morticianwords in fine 
laughterthieves and solarthongs
something killing this way comes

diggin' the days, the words and all space

hearselights
eating songless flies
hearselights
somewhat rainscented tonight

somewhat rainscented tonight
