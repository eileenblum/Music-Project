feeding on terrorwhores
sulphurscum for silversouls
and the coffincrow still smiles
a cadaverlaugh from afar
saltnails driven through hymenhearts
and i swallow the scythe

tonight's the night of the worm
that speaks with nailwork's tongue

bittermilk and unlight flow
twinkletint for murmurshows
and i eat some rainbowflesh
another wormsong from below
stalking down the gallow's pole
and my words bleed afresh

tonight's the night of the worm
that speaks with nailwork's tongue

schizophonic astroride
to the wormland's vacuumnight
rippin' the tongue
that spoke of this song

tonight's the night of the worm
that speaks with nailwork's tongue
