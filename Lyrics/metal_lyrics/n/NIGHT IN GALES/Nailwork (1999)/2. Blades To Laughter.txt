if blades were laughter
each nail a smile
my scissorsmouth 
would spit the soil
for words of napalm
none below
for hymenmurmur's
poisonshow

if blades were laughter
each knife ten teeth
i'd dye the words i breathe
all black

if blades were laughter
each pile a grin
my starscumwords
would twist and spin 
the murmurfather's
silverthroat
that spat the soil
for what i wrote
