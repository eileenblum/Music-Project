attack...!!

for as light wept upon the unsilent horde
we were enrobed in crystals of none and all
lustrous, yet from ascending thornsuns torn

full many of them the chaoskings bear
but none as black as the mark i wear

the nightart of fallen feathers shall ever haunt the dawn
alike the wingsoul tribe
that so proudly lusts for impaled spiritflesh

be it fury, be it pain...

the spark that fed the starborn's dance
now trampled by the nightart's sons
enter my lightslaveworld, hear the crystalthorns' call

be it fury, be it pain...

a call of starlit grievance
a call of spiritflesh
another thornking's triumph, the filthspawn attacks...!
