born of nightseed's unfastened tongues
i carve my thunderspeech
in the naked waters 
of a silverrain eclipse
the starchoir's soulflight chant
conquers the sulphurfields...

their bloodbladehymn
a bestial emblem for my feverfight  

...raging through aeons of the 
everthirsting and the flaming
my wounds are blackfleshed
as the slain winterdancer weaves 
cadaverdreams of wingless grace

behold me impaled, herald none and all...!
hasten..!!
amidst starving swans i rush from this ashen betrothal
towards the fleshlit citadels
for they are my fallen painkings !!
