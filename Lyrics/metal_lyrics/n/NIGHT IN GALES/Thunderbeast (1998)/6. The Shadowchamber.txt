crowned by an elder shade i am
yet of burdensome origin
a wrathvision, a scar...

i and pain
as one we bled from light
with blackened marble eyes
we cascade onto the impaler's feet
...harlots of splendour and tragedy

onward, harbinger of silverrain...!
eat my darkness and burgeon !

i command the sphere of featherflames
and battle those of crystal kind
for yet another marbleaeon
the shadowchamber's mine !!

erupting from stardust i devour
the infinite furydream
fanged by lightstorms entwined
