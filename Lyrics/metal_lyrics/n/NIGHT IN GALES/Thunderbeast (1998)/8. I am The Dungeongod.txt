this is my dominion
a painrealm torn from light
on crimsonwings i storm 
through its trembling feverskies

down, down...to the impurest ones
down...to prowl the tearspheres with none below

i rule as dungeongod upon sunken thrones

this is my featherpalace
lay your eyes upon its glorious plague !
berserk battles between bloodart and flames
the crystalwar rages within my breast...!

away...awaay...!!
even the stormlegions fled from those 
adorned with thorns and tongues
the scions of tragedy, the children of mine...!!
