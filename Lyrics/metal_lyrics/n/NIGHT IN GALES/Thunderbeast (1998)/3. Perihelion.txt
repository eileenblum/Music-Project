through thousand razorages i carried the mark
of yet another thousand tragedies

we are the chaosdeath warriors
spat from damnation's feverthorndreams
the glorious plague is ours !
...fed by the warslut's travesty

the mark that, in rapture and pain,
once bejewelled the skyslave's robe
a lightshroud woven of embers and scars
ever to burn, fever to bring...

perihelion...
slaughtered 'neath the horizon's whore
we..we kill the stench of heaven..we kill...!!
