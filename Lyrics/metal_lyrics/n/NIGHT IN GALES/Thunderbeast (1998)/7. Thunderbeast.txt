paleskinned invader, of bestial kind
starlit impaler, shackled upon this thornthrone of mine

beware !
he bears a bejewelled crystalsemen
his spawn's a wrathful plague
behold !
here comes the thunderbeast
prepare for attack !

marblewings, sulphurskin, its nectar burns the air
...the flaming fluid of a feathered fall's flare

i am the thunderbeast
a creature bred from storms and wars

with thousand thunders in my throat
and bladesong from a blackfleshed heart

scavengerstaves and vultureverses
an armed ode for the orphans' orator and savage creators
of chaoskings, carriots and calyxcannonades...

eat the universe !
sculpt my starmaid scars !

for i am the plunderer of magenta grandeur
nightstalker and maelstromrider berserk
maggotmaster, deathdancer's disease
firefed predator, i am the thunderbeast...!
