javelins hither ! envenom my breast !
...as minstrels of pestilence
intrude ! penetrate !
blacken the fount of chaosraves...
a rapturous onslaught
bastardblade stampede
sparked daggers stabbing onward
to each and every thornwombsleep...

intruder, intruder...! the dutcrown is yours
intruder, intruder...! persecuter of the pure

thousandfold thunderkiss
a deathborn predator's hiss
carnivorous as hymens in savagery
and skyclad words of furious breed

my speech...!
torn by the intruder's carrionscythe
a bewildering razorharp
its song damns marble eyes to see
only memories of nightfall's feast
that brings terror and tears...

terror and tears...!
