With a silent bird in my weak trembling hands
I declare this the end

This is the end
And all the world has turned to stone
Unheard goes the last living song

Fade away, fade
Let's fade away

I showed them how to eat a scythe
Now the bloodwork's done
The silent bird still lives the lie
Til we're all gone

Let's trip the tombs and I'll be fine
Another darkness will be mine
Deader than dead, blacker than black
The zeronaut is back

This is the end
And all the world has turned to stone
Unheard goes the last living song

Fade away, fade
Let's fade away
