Ridin' the rays of a ouicksilvehsun
I won't forget the days of perihelion
Now go get some death
Welcome the numbness of black
All bloodstars extinct, all firmaments wrecked

Five coffins aligned, five wormhearts overdue
No sylphlike song could unravel their truth
Wren all scissors smile and raging razorblades scream
Get killed or die trying, cause I know where you've been

This neon grave will eat us all

Shadowpaths traced but still on the run
Kissing the tombwomb, a life to be won
Now go get some death, welcome the coldness of black
All bloodsongs extinct and death grabs your neck

Five unsouls aligned, five funerals in bloom
No sylphlike song could unravel their doom
When all scissors smile and furious feverfeasts dreah
Get killed or die trying, cause I know where you've been

This neon grave will eat us all

Foe or friend, all firmanents fall
This world's at its end
A neon grave to eat us all
