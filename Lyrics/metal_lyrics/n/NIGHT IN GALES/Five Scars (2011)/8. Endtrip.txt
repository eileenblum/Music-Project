Life's a neon coffinride
A million frowns and inbetween a smile
Pushing deadmoutb daisies from below
Brawling songs of something, tunes of woe
One mile to go, five lives have been lived
A canorous downfall, nothing left to give

Five tragedians cutting their throats
Done final hunt down the feverfeastroad
A tune for the lost, a rhyme for the wrong
The zeronaut's singin' his last living song

Now here we die
We ride the one way ticket tonight
Now here we die
With a smile on our faces and our sins side by side
Now here we die
We ride the one way ticket tonight
Now here we die, we die, we die and it's alright!!!

A tune for the lost, a rhyme for the wrong
The zeronaut's singin' his last living song

Now here we die
We ride the one way ticket tonight
Now here we die
With a smile on our faces and our sins side by side
Now here we die
We ride the one way ticket tonight
Now here we die, we die, we die and it's alright!!!
