The scumstars I once praised and evoked
Now dim and pale to the bone
Blackelectric empty words now shine
Where guts and glory once shone

I'm dead and cold, I'm stardrowned
Fallen from ebony skies

All thunderbeasts gone, all darkzone anthemns sung
It's time for darkness to rise
Each and every drop of my lifesblood's been spilled
So let this darkness be mine

Death and destruction, right here on my tongue
Ten thousand tragedians just can't be wrong

I'm dead and cold, I'm stardrowned
Fallen from ebony skies

Death and destruction, I'm stardrowned
