Between ashes and ends
The zeronaut stands
Begging for a twilight kiss
He bites the feeding hands
Schizophonic songs
And deathdrugged crooked lines
Upon his tired tongue
Down his ouicksilverspine

But all he ever knew was...

Every single day we die
Every single life denied

Between foes and friends
This tombsong now will end
While the weary slavesun will
Never ever set in this land

But all he ever knew was...

Every single day we die
Every single life denied

Every single day we die
(Everybody's counting flies)
Every single life denied
(But still every body tries)
