The walls are closing in, the shadowchamber's locked
Start counting flies hen the death ship is docked
Some new red is born, some old red is torn
This robe of black soil waits to be worn
Our dead end diaries all written and closed
Nothing remains when death is morose

Five drops of red, five men drop dead
Five brothers bonded no more
Five drops of red. five men drop dead
Five hearts on the floor
Five tongues and a funeral
Five times we've heard the call
A doomdrugged call that bodes our fall

Now go get some death and scream out loud
With blood down the throat and all tongues ripped out
Life won't shed a tear wren all scissors smile
Cause death will embrace me like a long lost child

Five drops of red, five men drop dead
Five brothers bonded no more
Five drops of red five men drop dead
Five hearts on the floor
Five tongues and a funeral
Five times we've heard it all
Five lives, five-sins, five scars upon our skin

These scabs will eat us alive
Yeah they will eat us alive
These scars will eat us alive
And they will breed the night
