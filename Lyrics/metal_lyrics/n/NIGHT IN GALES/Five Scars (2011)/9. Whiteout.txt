A one eyed han once travelled far
Spurred by songs of hope and war
He took a gander, long and wide
Yet all colours died inside

Down the reeking streets of pain
He swore be won't come back again
Step by step into the light
That was nothing but a dirty white

It's a whiteout, evehything blurs
It's a whiteout, life reversed
It's a whiteout, everything blurs
It's a whiteout, life reversed

The colours cut right to the bone
A dirty white, the stain has grown
We've lost somewhere between
What was and what will never be
A necrodynanic downward spiral
For those who'll never see

Life reversed
Refuel the hearse
