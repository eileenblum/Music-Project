I hate this world before me, sailing in sincerity,
forged in the flames of infinity, I'm dead but still full of...
you dance through my spheres
and leave with a dead soul in the end,
is this the way life was meant, torture, despair, my descent?
my fears were born in your winterland
Ii'm left with the coldness of ominous tears,
autumn water, burning like the fire of winter-fall,
it's feeding my sadness,
autumn water quenches the thirst of all my fears,
forever and more, november in my heart...
when winter rises through the dawn
you take the light and close my eyes,
you take my fears and bring them back, I thought I could cry..!
but never again fire's heart is ablaze.
