into the fire! fire... burning so bright is there
a mournful being like mine was before?
eyes shut forever, infesting imagination inside
where serenity fades seraph, into the abyss!
no god will rise above to give forgiveness
to this essence of damnation isn't it art to feel what is life,
to feel the warmth of floodlight in this non-divine cosmos?
I deny, I'm divine, I defy a lie...
to punish all extinction humanity, release my agony,
in the name of fire, burn me! eternity has just begun,
oblivion when I see the sun turn your eyes
and feel your wounds bleeding!
extinguish the torment of this hell which never ends!
with crimes you content and suck the blood of unnatural innocence...
emotions like silence calling, shadows in motion,
burn this vision of thee and take what's in your chaotic heart!
take this starlike beauty in this world of decay,
show me disorder 'til sunlight breakes my eyes with silent fury...
