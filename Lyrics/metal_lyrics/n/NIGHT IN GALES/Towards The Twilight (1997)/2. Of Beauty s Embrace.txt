is this the day I cross the worlds
of beauty's embrace and darkened dreams?
inherit the fears of beauty's belief!
is this your vision, a timeless story of lunar-fire and memory's stain?
I followed the wide fire in which I believed...
if desperation can burst like silence, why can't I?
uncontrolled is my wrath within a grip of twilight anger,
this one I could drown...
the key is supremacy, "come with the wind " I cried
to the loneliness that was sent to me...
daughter of the rising sun,
embrace me in this season of harmony, release me..!
