a limitation to utilization,
my vanish is desenvated by semblance of banish,
struggle for fatal strength shall rise
my vanity is just usurpation through violation,
concealed to descent, it's my time,
flying through born horizons, bells chime,
born in flesh, pray for mystery, it's the revelation,
my throne of elevation...

you my god - the life gets my thoughts,
you my god - give me reincarnation,
you my god - take me to the garden of origin,
you my god - of upcoming downfall...

with my hands I can feel eternity,
went to empty skies to assume history of eternity,
made this part consumed genocide, mightiest apocalypse rise!
sound of invisible time, sing last souls' songs!
get the speech of my repertory...
I come to live, avoid secret vanity,
just heard the burden of wrath,
colours of selection to renew,
struggle for fatal strength shall rise
my vanity is just usurpation through violation.
