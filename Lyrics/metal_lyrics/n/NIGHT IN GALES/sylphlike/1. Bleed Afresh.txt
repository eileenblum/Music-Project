i walk on ways of sadness
to see the frustration of truth
hope that it will be endless
to see that i am real
you say i'm a sacred one
one to devastate
my soul will bleed afresh
my echo is one of few
thoughts full of helplessness
captured and deceased
a god should never be so blind...
but there's a time when
everything falls apart
won't someone tell me
that i'm just created
won't someone tell me in time
won't someone call a break
of breath in my ear
i took this way into reality
to see the frustration of truth
war of the merciless
won't they understand
what i feel
i just touched the 
chain of the moon
a chain that beats me down
my soul will bleed afresh
my soul has seen the view
