the evanescence of responsibility
sudden outward cease
the deliverance of mindspawn
quantum quiescence
for the paragon of heinousity
insecure inuendo
parsimonious feelings
mindspawn
initial injustice
despot by dawn
senseless scorn
mindspawn
exodus i see
ogre with fear
eternal education
not to think
mandatory illusion
your profound life
deception is born
sieged swarm
mindspawn
emotional experience grows
by daydreams
for innocent life which is lost
in their pride
mental animosity to awake
forever anaesthetized
by eternal silence
...seems to end in
journeys to disappointed centuries
am i guilty that truth hurts ?
am i guilty ...
forbidden abandoned life
