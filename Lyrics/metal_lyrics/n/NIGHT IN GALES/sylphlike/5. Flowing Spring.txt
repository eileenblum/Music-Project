i'm sinking through gates of time
future to past
everlasting dreams
reality to dreams
everlasting time
travelling the beauty of shadowed eyes
into the grace of the stars
through fusion of elements i am
my drawn energy
my outer dimensional phenomena
scary...what is it for ?!
the tales of flowing springs
creature creates creature
follow the path of the nameless
my force, my soul is frozen
by the end of time
i was born in the flowing spring
i am lifeless
i will be eternal
my affinity is my weapon
fire circles cross my way
to the worlds, the deserts
the material will become the entry
to the place beyond
the relief of the mountains is only
the decay of my mindstream
