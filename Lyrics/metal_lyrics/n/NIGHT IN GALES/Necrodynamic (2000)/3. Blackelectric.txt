Drank that link for way too long
Guess ever since it fuelled my tongue
For this blackelectric song

It's blackelectric
Somewhat blackelectric
And I wonder what this song is for
It's blackelectric
Damn blackelectric
I bet it's for the dead next door

Drank that link for way too long
But ink must flow where ink belongs
Right thru this blackelectric song

It's blackelectric
Somewhat blackelectric
And I wonder what this song is for
It's blackelectric
Damn blackelectric
I bet it's for the dead next door

Drank that ink for way too long
But it's alright
Drank thaat ink for way too long
Go get some death tonight

It's blackelectric
Somewhat blackelectric
And I wonder what this song is for
It's blackelectric
Damn blackelectric
I bet it's for the dead next door
still wonder who's the dead next door
