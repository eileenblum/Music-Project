Stalkin' down the smilin' bone
Goin' nowhere fast
And somewhere in between these lines
Another words at last
I'm comin' for the kill
Yet this song of something will
Rippin' all the tongues within
To be emptier still

Stalkin' down the electric graves
Goin' nowhere fast
And somewhere in between these lines
Another song at last

I'm not comin' for the kill
Yet this song of something will
Rippin' all the tongues within
To be emptier still

Stalkin' down this song of something
Goin' nowhere fast
And somewhere in between these lines
Another death at last
