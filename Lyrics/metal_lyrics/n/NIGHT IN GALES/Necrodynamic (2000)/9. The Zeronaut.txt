A mouthful of silence and words left for dead
Someone is heading for thing left unsaid
Inkdrugged smiles spittin' blackacidlights
I guess the zeronaut is on the go tonight

Twist a tongue and turn this song down low
The zeronaut is on the go

An eyeful of blackness and colour mislead
Someone is heading for ink left unbled
Got that guy with scythe by my side
I guess the zeronaut is on the go tonight

Twist a tongue and turn this song down low
The zeronaut is on the go
Twist a knife and turn this life down low
The zeronaut is on the go

A handful of nothin' and lives left unbred
Someone is heading for lines left unread
Be sang this song each time he died
I guess the zeronaut is on the go tonight

Twist a tongue and turn this song down low
The zeronaut is on the go
Twist a knife and turn this life down low
The zeronaut is on the go
