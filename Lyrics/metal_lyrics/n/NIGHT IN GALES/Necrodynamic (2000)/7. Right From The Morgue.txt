This words cuts deep
Right thru the bone
Though I've never ever been what this damn rotten word has shown
I'm bleedin' backwards
Been dead for a while
Don't give a fuck
Cause I'm dyin' with style

And another word from the morgue
But I guess it's the word to die for
Sometime in between now and then
It's a word right from the morgue again

This song cuts deep
Right thru the bone
Though I've never ever been what this damn rotten tone has shown
I take these words
Tear'em in two
And sing'em just for the reaper and you

And another word from the morgue
But I guess it's the word to die for
Sometime in between now and then
It's a word right from the morgue again

Gonna hit the graves now
Gettin' my inkin' thrill
Me and this word from the morgue
We're in for the kill
