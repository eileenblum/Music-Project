Go get some death in between these lines
The words aren't dead yet but I keep tryin'
Wonder what they're all about
Pushin' bones thru my damn rotten  mouth
Go get some death in between these lines
The words aren't dead yet but I keep tryin'
Sounds like a song for the wrong
Sung out of tune for way too long
Maybe that's why I'm somewhat dead again
But

Dyin' felt damn good today
Go get some death and damn decay
Dyin' felt damn good today

Go get some death in between these lines
The words aren't dead yet but I keep tryin'
They're gettin' blacker line by line
Just gimme another tombhearted try
Go get some death in between these lines
And if they die
So do I
