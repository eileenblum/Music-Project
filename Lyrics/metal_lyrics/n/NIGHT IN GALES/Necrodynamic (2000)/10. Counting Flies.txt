Give me another doomfix
Suck the nonblack from my eyes
Syringe me with electric ink
And watch me counting flies
Bleed me another deadlight to the rythm of the scythe
Drug me with tombstonedaisies
And watch me counting flies

Counting flies
Guess their colour's the one with none
Counting flies
It's the one with none

Spit me another endword
Smilin' right between your thighs
Fuel me with neonapalm
And watch me counting flies
Build me another catacomb
Eatin' silinet cies
Cleanse me with quicksilver
And watch me counting flies

Counting flies
Guess their colour's the one with none
Counting flies
It's the one with none
