No it won't be easy
There'll be scrum on the graveyard and a nail thru my tongue
No it won't be easy
There'll be some tombtrippers and a song for the wrong

Come trip my tomb tonight
And I'll getcha in between these lines

No it won't be easy
The hearselights won't shine but the scythe will set the tone
No it won't be easy
When I'll run out of ink while the muse sucks my bone

Come trip my tomb tonight
And I'll getcha in between these lines

No it won't be easy
To trip the zeronaut's tomb
Nor to stand this rotten laughter
No it won't be easy
There'll be some doomdrugged words
And silence ever after

Come trip my tomb tonight
And I'll getcha in between these lines
