I walk this barren wasteland looking for survivors, for my hunger for mankind draws near.

And i lead them to a sense of safety, then i shall unmask my true form and unleash myself upon their flesh.

Welcome to the ark, this is where you die.

They scream one by one.

Their crimson waters spray upon the walls.

Breathe, die.

Welcome to the ark, this is where you die.

Defile the flesh of innocence.

My bloodlusts satisfied, my hunger for flesh is complete. But when will they strike again?

And now my hunger grows deep inside until my bones whither away,

while the vultures circle above me tearing my skin.

And spreading my curse.

My realm has come to an end this world will burn in blood.

Why? Why? Why? Do i fall?
