[feat. The Juliet Massacre]Now do you feel alive?

Do you feel as i've ripped your fucking heart out from your chest?

Do you feel alive? Do you feel as i'm howling for your blood?

Run, run away from me i am coming for you, theres no escape from me.

You fucking bitch when i catch up to you i'll make you suffer for the pain you've caused me.

I will make you suffer, oh i will make you suffer.

Get on your knees and pray to your god to save you, i want lightening crashing down on my head.But i wont feel a thing from your pathetic praying, and i shall bludgeon your head into the ground.

I smile, you scream.

I'm avenged, you are dead.

What makes you think i will let you be? Your existence is what i want rid of. And as you see my face you scream for your deity to save you.But now, Divine intervention won't save you.

And no divine intervention will save you.

You drained, there is no life in this fucking world.And you don't pray for an Afterlife?

You find a way to preserve your soul,

And there is no life, the time is set for you.

I crave for your blood on my hands, i crave for your blood. And whats it like?

Having no deity cannot  save you. No hope is left for you. 

There's no holy power.
