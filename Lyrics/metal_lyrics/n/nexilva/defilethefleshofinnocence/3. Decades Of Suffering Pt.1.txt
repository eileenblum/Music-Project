Now this is your time to turn against the masters of the world as they attempt to control all of you. Break out your shell it is time to rebel and render this world free forever.

Break through these chains of morality, break through these chains.

Imprisoned for far too long this is now your uprising, it is time to spill your gods blood. No more mindless wars for a god that never shows his face.

The decades of suffering have come to a final close now that religion has finally fallen.

Mankind can finally flourish on this world forever.

Nail the usurpers to a cross and stand in awe of their demise.

As they beg for mercy pierce a blade into their hearts.

Hear them scream, see them cry.

Earth is now free from tyranny and no more blood will consumed from the ground,

and no more wars for a martyr who died for all our sins.

Now the rain shall wash away your masters blood cleansing the world of filth.

The decades of suffering have come to a final close, now rejoice in the entrails of dictation.

I see this world in chaos it blinds me and suffocates me.

Rise.

Now the rain shall wash away the filth of lies.
