Now this demon's within you and your fate will be a horrible end,

so embrace the reaper with open arms and await your fucking torment. Descend lower into hell as you see others suffer around you.

Run as you maintain your hope of escape, the darkness invades your mind.

You're now a slave to his will now you shall be sent back to earth to carry out a task of evil. Now take this chance to be redeemed for your sins and barter your way into the light.

But the devil has control of your soul and you will never have peace,

now watch your hands constrict around your kins throat.

All shall fall.

Mankind fear their futile end.

All shall fall. Manipulation is your fate.

Now hell will take you back and the chains will wrap around you piercing your flesh,

to give an illusion of blood raining from the sky.

Now give your soul to the devil and watch you burn.

Burn forever more.
