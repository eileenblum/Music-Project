Twenty-two short years
The smallest grain of sand
Without my arms to comfort
Without the help of my outstretched loving hand

Facing the current
Accepting the pain
Tears tearing at my skin.
Not the same
Pieces of what's left
Remembering your name
The light's no longer akin

I return to your home
Nervously we approached an empty shell
Dreading the sight of her sadness
No words seem right for comfort
Wake me from all this madness

Unforgettable times of togetherness
Knowing that we could just be ourselves in this bliss
I slowly open the door

My palms sweat and my abandoned stomach churns
Everything is alien to everyone
I slowly open the door

Pictures of you cycling through my head
Like an unstoppable carousel
Yearning for a final goodbye

How should I feel?
Where should I go?
I don't belong but
This is my fucking home!

Reduced to a comic box
Lifeless
Nothing but numbness and this pain in my chest
That just will not rest

Pictures of you cycling through my head
Like an unstoppable carousel
For a final goodbye
Makes it harder just to let you go

I walk the earth for you
Searching high and low
Just to find any remnants of you
In denial push against the flow

I cannot cease these dreams
Of what could have been
I can't stop the machine

Travelling
Witnessing
We are one

There is a peaceful silence
The flicker of a burning candle
And even with all that is lost
I don't feel alone in a building of disbelief
The sickness feels all too much for me

Can I save your dreams

How should I feel
Where should I go
Like a mountain of emptiness
Never set in stone
