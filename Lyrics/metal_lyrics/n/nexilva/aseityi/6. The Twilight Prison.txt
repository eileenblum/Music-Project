Impulsively awakened I thrive
Among the minds so abnormal to mine
Their abrasive lies
Forcing me to cross that line

Their paradise of indifferent awareness
Dragged ever further from my grasp
I long for a second of silence

In this searing temple of fire
An awful prison in twilight
Alive at night

In every dwindling spire
There's an interior fight

The doors are barred and hell is inside
As I attempt to hide
I'm encased
As if evil had ever felt safe

My surroundings are bleak
Though these notions will find me enslaved
It won't let me escape
My body is weak

Face to face I embrace this being
And it's terrible aura unknown
Where once was ever sweeter dreams
It finds me cold and alone

Again
Dead inside and stolen
Begin
Reborn eyes in hoping

Your hands are shaking
Let me resurge
I can shine though your body is aching
Let yourself die for I am the light

I accept
I have lost the fight

As the everlasting night returns I change
Swallowed by the darkness, infected

Falling into the flames of despair
As they flood the halls with terror
Forever they endevour

The blistering might of their power
Shown full force in their stature
For this will never be over
Ever be their nature entombed by their master

Heed my words
Know my will (I know you will erase me)
You feel my burn
Your world will turn

Down paths I could never follow
He speaks to me
Lines I could never cross
In daylight I'm at ease
Through every little toil
He weakens me

The spite that he murmurs clothes me in scorn
So embedded I can't escape
Ingesting my soul
I wish to be reborn
And emerge some place in day

Falling deep in secrets
My patience wanes
As I attempt to hide I'm encased
As if evil had ever felt safe

The doors are barred
And hell is inside
I've made my choice to die
Taking time to close these eyes
Where eternal twilight goes to thrive

The doors are barred
And hell is inside
I've made my choice to die
Taking time to close these eyes
Where eternal twilight goes to thrive
In hell I find my mind
