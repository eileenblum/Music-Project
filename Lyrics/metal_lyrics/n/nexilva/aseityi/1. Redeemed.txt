So here we are
Alone with the options we thought we'd never have to face
To emerge or cause to immerse again
We depend on our actions
Can our time in black be corrected?

Dragging on again
So distant and here we stand
Nothing to lose
But nothing left to gain.
Near and far events
Across ocean and land
So distant here we stand
For intentional affect

No more can we dwell on what's been taken from us
Carry on and venture into madness
And those who try to bury us, or strive to complete this
Could never live up to the name
For one and apart we weren't the same

Boundaries set in giant leaps and bounds of time
In their design they challenged those
Lacking the means to interchange another race

They fled into hell, never thought to return

We couldn't forget and remain
Inevitable

Unable to stand against the demons we faced
We turned to quiet in everyday
Almost ashamed of our dismay
Angered by whatever we couldn't say
As if there was always another way out

Years passed in our desire
As though time had accelerated around us
Abandoned us

Through their worn and aged eyes we are found
Their salvaging gaze cast deeper underground
An end to the darkness as it was

The fall of pitch black confidence
An end to darkness as it was
But after all the time I could never find
I can not forget where I came from

Redeemed, retrieved
It's only what's missing
Is this all that you will recieve
Reawakened, replaced
It's in our convictions
We can't be fallen from grace

For all the time that we were underground
I never thought we could surface
Or if we even deserved it
We can't stand the silence
You won't be deserted in our time

Life won't be cut short in our eyes
You won't be deserted in our time

Rediscovered, regained
It could all be meaningless
A life yet to be fulfilled
We return, reborn
To shatter the still
Through their eyes, aged and worn

We are now found
