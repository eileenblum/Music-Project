Taking strides into foreign land
Where time is my only currency
Holding memory high in my growing mind
Breaking the dull ties of our normalcy

The forgotten ones are said to remove our sight
Our potential to recognise the future
Our gift from the temporal divine

I've been left behind and it all remains
My vision of hours behind this sudden change

Unable to make sense of my new reality
Am I remembering or am I alive
A momentary glimpse of all of time

Imagine living in a feared idea
Where chance is our only option

A choice never made is the only way
To remain divided in perception
A parallel dimensional looking glass
Never taking away the possible alternatives
Forever alive in every decision
Beyond anything I could imagine

The distance flaunts
Memories born of my thoughts
The hours, they turn into days
Another life

How would we survive in detached isolate
Where there should be only one, there is forever
We could dicipher our timeline
We could utilise strength
And break the design

I saw every little move I made
Sewn together in an open grave
Paving the road to my dismay
If the future's this close to me
How can I live in every day

I saw every little move I made
Sewn together in an open grave
If the future's this close to me
How can I live in every day

Tracing back to every single path I take
Through open doors to all of my mistakes
If the future is unknown to me
How can I see it in my own disease

I feel I'm spread to thin

Floating on a wave through the tranquil
Feel the water and it's energetic embrace
Lying in a translucent splendour
Lucid journies become one

An epiphany for progression
The elegant truth of what is felt inside
Notions of beauty swarming my mind
Still dead alive
Magnetism to the other side

Traversing further through the stream
Collected memories become the reality
One entity
Travelling to witness the light
Reaching the handle to become
No one
