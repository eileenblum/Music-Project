In truth we are fragile
More than we know
In existence we're the futile
More than we show

We hang against a backdrop of the infinite
We're on a vessel in need of a cognitive shift
We're blessed to witness this
For it will change the very path of our consciousness

Looking down from the outside
Straining as the glares radiate
From a sun in a black sky
Alive

Overview
In the haze I see colours
And suddenly it all makes sense
Overview
In the haze I hear a calling
So openly I see the signs

Our time can seem so much shorter here
As thin as our degrading lifeline
Disbanded in time
Detached from being and dreaming
Inside
And fall within

Entrusted with the protection of our saviour from the sun
This bountiful oasis she's trusted us to uphold
Keep her from harm as you would your own
Obeying together
The promise of old

For the gift of life we should be grateful
Poles apart it's farther from the truth
For our siblings here can be so hateful
Guiding her to the fatal noose

Ocean storm cloud swarm around
Up here there's true peace to be found
Dancing curtains of auras flutter the skies
A vision of the line where
Day and Night divide

The heavens before us
No separation to ground us

Overview
In the haze I see colours
And suddenly it all makes sense
Overview
In the haze I hear a calling
So openly
I see the signs

You only have to live
Just let go
