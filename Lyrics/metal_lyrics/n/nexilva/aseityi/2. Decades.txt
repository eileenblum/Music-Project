How hard do I need to look
To find weapons that justify my need for peace
How far must I walk down this road
Among dwindling pieces of agony that feed my disease

My naivety serves as sweet justice
Dissolving everything I stand upon
Evolving all that I pride myself on
Over and around my every restraint
This danger is awake
To lie to my brain to remain

Living death
I long for dreams of reality
Where crying is heard over laughter
And I find that my demons infect me

They grow higher than I've ever seen before
Longer than I can percieve
An end to the madness inside of me
Is no longer a tale I can believe
A tale I can believe

Only now do I see

As I'm coerced into climbing
Though my freewill is tiring
I breath
The higher the dream
The greater, the faster it feeds
As though I'm forced into dying
The extent of all I see astounds me

Every step recedes abhorently
The trail I'd expect is reduced to nothing in front of me
As far as I can see

Can I continue to climb these demons of mine
Or will I be deserted in my time

Only now do I see
This journey I constructed in fear
Is nothing it was made out to be
It was all a conspiracy

Every step recedes abhorently
This winding path is no longer free
And sadly
For every stone that I turned to defeat you
Every bone that I broke has betrayed me

To fall in line,
A struggle I just can't seem to end
I can't help but defend the upper hand

Awake from effortless sleep
I fear I've gone to deep
There's something i've been missing

Clear skies await
Upon the realisation of this
My journey diminished by fate
For longer I can climb, this forever line
Of misery over time

Only now do I see
This journey I constructed in fear
Is nothing it was made out to be
It was all a conspiracy

Every step recedes abhorently
This winding path is no longer free
And sadly
For every stone that I turned to defeat you
Every bone that I broke has betrayed me
