The prophecies have come full circle on this day and we will die.

The scriptures tell of fire, covering the world. Mankind shall scream simultaneously.
As the pain courses through the nerves. Sending fucking countless souls to hell.

And now the devil has enslaved an army to overrun heaven itself.
The saints and angels will never stand a chance as the mortal souls storm this pearly gates.
God stands ready on his throne but the hoard is overpowering, now they send his fucking corpse to the ruined earth.

All hope dies with him too. Light shall die as well.

Now earth stands lifeless and desolate and dark. Satan sets his course for other worlds.
To reign an empire upon the unknown. His army swells as each world is obliterated
And no being can oppose him for his power is infinite. Flame is the only element now.
All will burn forever.

The stars fall from their rightful place. Creating a million suns. The remnants of the planets fuse together.
To become one. We were all deceived. Satan has become God. Memories are wiped from the souls of the dead.
To begin earth again and this shall happen once every one million years. The ancients will predict the end once again.
An endless repeat for eternity and the next devil will overthrow the current king.

Humanity has no say in this. This is what must be done. To insure direction and maintain the balance between the light and the dark. This is the endless prophecy forever we will fear the wrath of the gods.

Evil will prevail.
