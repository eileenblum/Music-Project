I've seen a vision to the end of the world. Thousands try to seek safety from the flame of hell but the attempts to flee are futile. For the flame shall cloak the world killing all it touches.
Now i feel unstable to face the world.

Face the fucking world

This unknown fear it fucking sickens me, I run forever i try to hide myself.

I'm all alone in the plains running from my premonition. Sickened, stricken, embracing what awaits.
to the point of surrendering to fate. But god has learned of what I've seen now his servants shall hunt me to the end of the world.

Now I've become enslaved no light shall cross my eyes, gods disciples shall hide me from the world to prevent my warning reaching innocent ears.

Into the sky. I've seen a vision of unholy demise. I've seen the children scream and tear out their eyes.
to hide from the horrors at the end of their lives.

The world shall burn while i am chained to the walls of the vatican, i have failed humanity,
the cardinals shall watch the world burn in despair, with a grim look on their faces

Evil will prevail. The end has come.

We've been betrayed this vision was the only means for us to be saved. The disease has lived for far too long.
