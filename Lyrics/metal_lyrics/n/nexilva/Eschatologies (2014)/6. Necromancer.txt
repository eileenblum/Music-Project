Heresy has gone untouched this night to bring forth the gravest curse, the world has ever seen.
Bring them back from the dead and prepare the invasion of the surface. World of the living will fall this night.

Reanimate their bodies so their heads behold the light. Like a child emerged from his mothers womb.
Behold as they await their masters call.
Ever grateful for their gift of false life, tied to his life force they shall become puppets of the necromancer

Forever fucking slaves to his will obeying without question. They walk the land, prepare yourself to join the undead.

The necromancer rules.

They walk the land prepare yourselves to join the undead feel this infection loosen your mind.
Feed on the flesh of the living.

Their hunger is endless this contagion manifests in your flesh. Infecting your mind, shutting down all attributes within.
Replacing them with the instincts of a carnivorous cannibal of night. Watch the rest of the world run away from you from grave fear of your intentions. But now the necromancer rules the world, as the only living man on this planet.
That was already poisoned from the start and hear this silence forever.

Undead from now to infinity.

This is the end of our curse.
