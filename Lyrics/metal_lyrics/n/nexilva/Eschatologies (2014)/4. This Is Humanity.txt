We are the monsters of the world. Always wanting more, it never satisfies.
And we take it while ignoring consequence, un-bewildered by the change of atmosphere.
And we set off hate against each other. To begin a war that never ends.
Always dealing death to stay ahead of the pack.


They're lapping all their power up, leaving thousands in their wake at the hands of starvation.
Make the peasants pay the price for their poor chance of luck.
Fucking bind them till they break! (Fucking bind them till they break!)

Dealing death to reach the top. Always wanting more.

Filthy oppressor, over privileged defiler!
And the time will come when you lead us to doom

Now the snakes have deceived their way on the throne.

Witness the tragedy that we fulfilled. And break apart the tranquil feeling
Erase it from the texts.
Let no one feel the joy of the sunrise.
Nor the apex of the sky, colonise us to think the same. Let us become one force, bowing to your every whim.
If you feed our addictions we're yours to serve.

And now the hate has consumed us now we reign this nuclear filth upon ourselves.
It will show our true form, a monstrous mutation. We will end the world.
