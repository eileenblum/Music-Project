No amount of effort will achieve global peace, for human nature is feral and mendacious.
We are the parasites in the blood of a dead world, slowly infecting it till its last breath.

And now we disguise ourselves as saints, harbouring a fatuous idea.
That we serve the lord to justify our actions and enslave others to steer humanity in one direction.

Evil will prevail we're all fucking blind
Evil will prevail we're a species of hate and we seek completion from possessions to feel false pride. And we fear all difference so we make our ways known to all.
To create an excuse for war.

War will never end. Violence for every generation.

We have been fighting since the beginning of time war will never end if we continue to place deceivers upon thrones. Revere them as heroes, endure the truth of being colonised.

We are all enslaved to the weaker ones.

Oh Humanity we resonate misery. Feel the pain of war.

The end has come. Everything is destroyed. The earth is nothing but dust.
At last we've achieved peace. Achieved Peace

Hear the silence of the galaxy no more selfishness for mankind.
Embrace the change of ages. Breath freely now.
The fumes have disappeared, salvation!
Nothing will outlast me.

And now the stars can finally heal what's left.
And the Earth will recreate.
