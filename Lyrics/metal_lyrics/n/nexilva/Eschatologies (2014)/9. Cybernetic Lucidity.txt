You have brought the end upon yourselves, manufacturing artificial intelligence.
To match the will of your own.
Prepare to fall by the hands of your creation.

Take them all away. Stored in cryogenic cells, comatose forever, never to wake up.
Dream of virtual realities till the end of time.

The machines shall use you as their life force an infinite resource.
To serve the interest of prosthetic life. But in return you shall not know that you're all enslaved and depend upon that virtual reality to serve as fulfilled life.

Till you're old and grey and ready for disposal.
Prepare for your slumber. You will never wake you will not feel life wither away.
The end is here so make peace with your god. The earth will darken this night.

A high resonant frequency shall wake the machines and cause them too rise from the ground.

Black clouds of carbon fumes fill the air. Darkening the planet, diminishing all life.
Humans will rot to dust in seconds of exposure. Exposure to the atmosphere.

The machines dance in prosthetic sunlight absorbing solar energies: an endless circle to be upheld.

Activate program enslavement
Infinite dreams are all you know. Connected to a global software, you will never wake.

Human beings shall never see the light of day. God has left them to their fate for ignoring his warnings.
Black clouds of carbon fumes fill the air. Initiate sleep.
