The invasion has begun. Behold the end.

They have come from hell to put this afflicted world out of its misery. As they charge through the boarders of each land. Every victim joins their cause.

They lie and deceive with the promise of sustainability and peaceful existence. But all i see is fucking hopelessness. And mass control to keep us in the ranks of their evil system.

They have taken form as a state of mind corrupting those with the power of control.
They are drunk on their power. Its time to tip the fucking scales.(Time to tip the fucking scales)
We should not conform, lets fight back, snatch out their all seeing eye.

And know their addictions will die, rendering all conflicts inert of their purpose.
Its time to fight. Fight back.

And once we end this blight upon our world will it be a better place.
to think nothing of the wars that have passed.
They shall be nothing but a memory.

And now these days shall be tranquil and free but this will not last.

We are human after all.

A species of filth.
A corrupted race.
A self righteous cause.
A destructive lie.
We will end the world.
Evil will Prevail.
