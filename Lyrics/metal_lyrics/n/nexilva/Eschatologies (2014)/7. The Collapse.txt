We are gathered here today to witness the unthinkable. A bellowing sound echoes through the world,
no man can withstand they shall fall to their knees.
They look up to the sky to witness god falling from the clouds.
Where will you go when the end comes?

They shall scream in their pain, knowing all hope has disappeared.
The shackles of society wither instantly.

Return to the wild who will fight to survive. Who will live? Who will die?

But on the horizon, a gigantic hand fills the skyline. Followed by a more powerful figure.
Run this is Lucifer, in the flesh. Mercy does not hold him back.
Look into his eyes. An exact example of the hell that awaits, that awaits us.

This is the end. This is armageddon we have no fear for the death of a false god.
For we are saved. Nothing can stop him. Run this is Lucifer. This is the end.
