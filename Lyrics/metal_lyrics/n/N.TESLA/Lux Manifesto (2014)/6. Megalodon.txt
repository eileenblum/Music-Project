Ice-cold hours on the water
There's not enough heat for us
To show how deep we are under the ground

Day one. We were fed by the hatred to our brothers
The world won't become better when I lay on the shore suffocating
Day one. The anger did not become stronger
We were hunting alone but were afraid to be left alone

We have not become stronger
