Keep your heart quiet
The ocean of life is between the beats
The lies are among the dreams

Rip out the constant ignorance
Millions of stars separate you from (your) home
Your home is harmony

You are a friend to everyone
And the host of nothing
The morning will succeed the night
The universe will replace calousness

You are a passenger
Of the silent train
The part of this puzzle was lost

No matter who you are
Your number's not the last
