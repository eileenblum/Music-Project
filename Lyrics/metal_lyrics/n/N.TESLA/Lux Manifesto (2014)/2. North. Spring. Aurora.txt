The North is my breath
Three suns are always with me
Long distance calls me

I could come the first
But I will be the last
It's getting warmer
Steam goes out of my mouth

I should sleep three days, three nights
My eyes are like the frozen planets
Inside burns a flame

You are the first who knows my North
Has come to end
You, the first who lives
In the spring tent

Between the spring and me is only North
