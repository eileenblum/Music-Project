where?
where?
where do we go?
to the light of high lamps
where?

those people, fallen from the roofs
lay motionlessly
laughing, but sobbing inside
run to the edge

We will be afraid inside
And I am afraid
not to be afraid of death

Someone's calling out of the window
"come home!"
I stumble....
I break the bones of disappointed

light is dimming in the sky
I need, the Light!
