Give them all that you believe
Your way is infinite and blessed
Just take my hand and let's go there
Where the purple fog is born
The words don't need to be
Here speak only birds
Turn back,
Plains are shed by the light
Emptiness is filled with the sun
You worth our hearts
You're everywhere, so far away

Our desire has dried out
Hands felt on the knees
But you're not afraid to leave these plains
You're their purple hope

Fragile like the glass, the snow
Is falling slowly
Fog is already at the eyes
It's time to sleep
This fog is for us
