[Music by Libor KrÃ¬vÃ k / Lyrics by Lucie StryckovÃ ]

I won't live it up tomorrow
poisoned blood runs in my veins
my soul's sinking into sorrow
I'm wearing someone else's face
I beg for days when all my steps weren't lacking sense
I had no clue there was just a nick of time
I am more than sure than I will lose this game
how will I know please give me just a sign
Wind is strolling eempty railway
I have missed my last train
I won't make it through the freeway
dust and tears and endless pain
here come the days when all my steps are lacking sense
I'm a tiny fly that sinks in a glass of wine
I am more than sure that I've run out off time
just tell me when and give me a little sign
RAIN, FALLING ON MY HEAD
GETTING ME DOWN ON MY KNEES
PAIN DISAPPEARS AND I'M OVERWHELMED
BY THE FEEELING THAT I'M FREE AND CLEAN
RAIN, FALLING ON MY HEAD
GETTING ME DOWN ON MY KNEES
PAIN DISAPPEARS AND I'M OVERWHELMED
BY THE FEEELING THAT I'M FREE AND CLEAN
