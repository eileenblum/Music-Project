[Music by Libor KrÃ¬vÃ k / Lyrics by Petr VyslouzÃ¬l]

Humiliation no longer
cross your daring quest
set on the run you crave after rest
Abomination to weak
entwined your soul to crime
Blindfolded Faith
is holding the line
Welcome the stirring world
be brave and bold
play for a higher score As reaching beyond the top
where no one can stop
your demands for more
GATHERED AS ONE
BOW TO IDOLS OF TIME
ENVISION PAST PASSING BY
PROGRESSION'S BLAST CAN'T SINS
TO BE UNDONE
TRAPPED IN FALSE DREAMS
WE'RE E-MAZED AND STRAINED
THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOUR LIFE GREAT
Unleash the fury
Blow out a doubt in raging gale
no turning back
only the best prevail
but Running out slowly
time comes to pay for dirty deal
great but enslaved
you're the servant of will
Facing the endless may
you're leading astray
in day by day game
GATHERED AS ONE
BOW TO IDOLS OF TIME
ENVISION PAST PASSING BY
PROGRESSION'S BLAST CAN'T SINS
TO BE UNDONE
TRAPPED IN FALSE DREAMS
WE'RE E-MAZED AND STRAINED
THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOUR LIFE GREAT
