[Music by Libor KrÃ¬vÃ k / Lyrics by Petr VyslouzÃ¬l]

Mighty empires sowing disease of war
Signs of definace will burn at the stake
World in the fire bleeding from thousand wounds
buried last hope in the mankind's awake
Show carries on for their sake nations die
heading damnation, untill all is gone
Witness is gallows exacts obedience
Power is hungering for a forbidden fruit
Reaper's our fellow ruling with scythe of death
treads mercy under the infantry's foot
We are just pawns on the chessboard of might,
holding a sword, waiting order to flight.
Kingdoms are falling governors imaple
Fortune ca be volatile
Just soldiers are marching no matter who's right
Gravestones bring the memories back of bravery acts spreading
the fright
RIDE A WIND, SHARPEN YOUR STEEL
HOPE THE SUN ABOVE WILL RISE FOR YOU TO LIVE
WITH HONOUR AND PRIDE
ONWARD ARE GAZING OUR SIGHTS
FAR BEYOND, AT THE EDGE OF TIME
Kingdoms are falling governors imaple
Fortune ca be volatile
Just soldiers are marching no matter who's right
Gravestones bring the memories back of bravery acts spreading
the fright
RIDE A WIND, SHARPEN YOUR STEEL
HOPE THE SUN ABOVE WILL RISE FOR YOU TO LIVE
WITH HONOUR AND PRIDE
ONWARD ARE GAZING OUR SIGHTS
FAR BEYOND, AT THE EDGE OF TIME
Hear me, Thunder Lord
I'm summoning your name
Don't let me fall a victim
to this seamless game
Hear me, Mother Earth
On your wrinkled soil we trail
we wait for your cold embrace
in a moment of our fail
RIDE A WIND, SHARPEN YOUR STEEL
HOPE THE SUN ABOVE WILL RISE FOR YOU TO LIVE
WITH HONOUR AND PRIDE
ONWARD ARE GAZING OUR SIGHTS
FAR BEYOND, AT THE EDGE OF TIME
