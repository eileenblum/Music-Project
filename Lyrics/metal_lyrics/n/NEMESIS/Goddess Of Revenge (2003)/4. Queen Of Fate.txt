[Music by Libor KrÃ¬vÃ k / Lyrics by Petr Kratochvil]

I'm the one who rules your life
I hear your hopeless cries
I know all of your dreams
Feeding the flames of war
I bring the thunderstorm
Shaping the fortunes of all
I'M YOUR STRENGHT AND I'M YOUR WEAKNESS
I'M THE SOURCE OF ALL YOUR HATE
YOUR PROTECTOR
AND YOUR TRAITOR
I HAVE ALL YOUR LIFE IN MY HAND
STRONGER THAN GODS - QUEEN OF FATE
HEARTLESS KILLER
THE LIFEGIVER
Slavery and liberty
Richness and poverty
I bring you hope and fear
Your can lament or cry
But you can not defy
I'm neither evil nor good
I'M YOUR STRENGHT AND I'M YOUR WEAKNESS
I'M THE SOURCE OF ALL YOUR HATE
YOUR PROTECTOR
AND YOUR TRAITOR
I HAVE ALL YOUR LIFE IN MY HAND
STRONGER THAN GODS - QUEEN OF FATE
HEARTLESS KILLER
THE LIFEGIVER
