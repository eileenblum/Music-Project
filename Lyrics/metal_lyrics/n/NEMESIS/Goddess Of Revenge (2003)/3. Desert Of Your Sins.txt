[Music by Libor KrÃ¬vÃ k / Lyrics by Petr Kratochvil]

Shadows of your dreams
The thoughts that you fear
Life is a cobweb
Made up of your guilt
THERE'S NO ESCAPE
NO TURNING BACK FOR YOU
FROM THE DESERT OF YOUR SINS
THE MOON IS RED, THE LIGHT IS DEAD AND GONE
WHEN THE CREEPING SHADOWS COME TO YOUR MIND
So turn your back to
The face of the demon
Or take your chance and
Pay the price in blood
SORROW AND PAIN, THE SMELL OF SUFFERING
IN THE DESERT OF YOUR SINS
YOU ARE THE ONE, WHO RULES YOUR FATE AND LIFE
AS THE SANDS OF TIME ARE RUNNING DOWN
