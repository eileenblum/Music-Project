[Music by Libor KrÃ¬vÃ k / Lyrics by Lucie StryckovÃ ]

Path that you are walking
leads to a shabby wall
strange voices talking
of heaven's fall
All you're been faking
will come back to you
giving aand taking your heart and soul
your bloody and dark memories
night's falling on empty graves
promises broken
poisoning your soul
hear words unspoken
and heaven falls
Walk in the moonlight searching for the peace
forget the dark side
of your memories
burn your house, throw away the keys
day's breaking I beg you please
BREAK THE CHAINS
CLEAR UP YOUR POISONED SOUL
TURN YOUR SIGHT
YOU'RE NOT WALKING ALONE
KEEP THE WAY
FOLLOW YOUR INNER VOICE
THE FREEDOM GIVES YOU CHOICE
Snowflakes are falling
on a quiet empty all
inner voice is calling
and heavens fall
thin ice is breaking underneath your feet
lying and hating
all of your friends
who lived their lifes just for you
start thinking what you can do
BREAK THE CHAINS
CLEAR UP YOUR POISONED SOUL
TURN YOUR SIGHT
YOU'RE NOT WALKING ALONE
KEEP THE WAY
FOLLOW YOUR INNER VOICE
THE FREEDOM GIVES YOU CHOICE
