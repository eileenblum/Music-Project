[Music by Teloch, Lyrics by trad. Edda, translated: H. A. Bellows, adapt. Cpt. Estrella Grasa]

Youth o youth
Of whom then youth
Are you born
Say whose son you are
Who in Fafnir's blood
Your bright blade reddened
And struck your sword to my heart

The noble hart my name
And i go
A motherless man abroad
Father i had not and lonely ever i live

If thou mightest grow your friends among
One might see you fiercely fight
But bound thou art and in battle taken

Who drove you on
Why were you driven
My life to make me lose

Though your name on the day of my death you hide
You know that you do lie
