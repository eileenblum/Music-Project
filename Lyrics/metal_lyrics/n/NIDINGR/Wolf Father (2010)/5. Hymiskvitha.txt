[Music by Teloch, Lyrics by trad. Edda, translated: H. A. Bellows, adapt. Cpt. Estrella Grasa]

The mountain-dweller sat merry as boyhood
Like a blinded man he seemed

The son of Ygg gazed in his eyes
For the gods a feast shalt thou forthwith get
Word-wielder toil for the giant worked
And so revenge on the gods he sought

The far-famed ones could find it not
And the holy gods could get it nowhere
There dwells to the east of Elivagar
Hymir the wise as the end of heaven

Forward that day with speed thay fared
From Asgarth came they to Egil's home
Goats with horns bedecked he guarded
They sped to the hall where Hymir dwelt

But the other fair with gold came forth

Eight fell from the ledge and one alone
The hard-hammered kettle of all was whole
Forth came they then and his foes he sought
The giant old

Much sorrow his heart foretold when he saw
The giantess' foeman come forth on the floor
Then of the steers did they bring in three
Their flesh to boil

By a head was each the shorter hewed
And the beasts to the fire straight they bore
From the beast the slayer of giants broke
The fortress high of his double horns
