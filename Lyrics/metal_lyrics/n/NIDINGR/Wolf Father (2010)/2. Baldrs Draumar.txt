[Music by Teloch, Lyrics by trad. Edda, translated: H. A. Bellows, adapt. Cpt. Estrella Grasa]

Once were the gods together met
The goddesses came and council held
And the far-famed ones
The truth would find why baleful dreams
To Baldr came
Then Othin rose the enchanter old
Thence rode he down to Niflhel deep

And the hound he met that came from hell
Bloody he was on his breast before
At the father of magic he howled from afar
Forward rode Othin the earth resounded
Till the house so high of Hel he reached

Then Othin rode to the eastern door
There he knew well was the wise-woman's grave
Magic he spoke and mighty charms
Till spell-bound she rose and in death she spoke

What is the man to me unknown
That has made me travel the troublous road
I was snowed on with snow and smitten with rain
And drenched with dew long was i dead

Speak thou of hell for of heaven i know
For whom are the benches
Bright with rings
Bedecked with gold

Here for Baldr the mead is brewed
There is a shining drink and a shield lies o'er it
And their hope is gone from the mighty gods

Wise-woman cease not i seek from thee
All to know that fain would ask
Who shall the bane of Baldr become
And steal the life from Othin's son

Hoth thither bears the far-famed branch
He shall the bane of Baldr become
And steal the life from Othin's son

Wise-woman cease not i seek from thee
All to know that fain would ask
Who shall vengeance win for the evil work
Or bring to the flames the slayer of Baldr

Rind bears Vali in Vestrsalir
And one night old fights Othins son
His hands he shall wash not
His hair he shall comb not
Till the slayer of Baldr he brings to the flames
