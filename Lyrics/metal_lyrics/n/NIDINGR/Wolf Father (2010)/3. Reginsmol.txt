[Music by Teloch, Lyrics by trad. Edda, translated: H. A. Bellows, adapt. Cpt. Estrella Grasa]

What is the fish that runs in the flood
And itself from ill cannot save
If thy head thou wouldst from hell redeem
Find me the water's flame
If thou seekest still
To live in the land of men

What payment is set for the sons
Of men who war with lying words
That one to another utters

Now shall the gold bring their death
To brothers twain
And evil be

For a maid shall kinsmen clash
Heroes unborn thereby shall be
I deem
To hatred doomed

The gold so red shall i rule
So long as i shall live
Nought of fear for thy threats i feel

Gifts ye gave but ye gave not kindly
Gave not with hearts that were whole
Your lives ere this should ye all have lost
