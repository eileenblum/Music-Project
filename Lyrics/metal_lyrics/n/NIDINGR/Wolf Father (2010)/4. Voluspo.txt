[Music by Blargh, Lyrics by trad. Edda, translated: H. A. Bellows, adapt. Cpt. Estrella Grasa]

Of old was the age when Ymir lived
Sea nor cool waves nor sand there were
Earth had not been nor heaven above
But a yawning gap and grass nowhere

I remember yet the giants of Yore
Who gave me bread in the days gone by
Nine worlds i knew the nine in the tree
Hidden deep beneath the mold

Then sought the gods
Their assembly-seats
The holy ones
Then council held and names they gave
To the noon and twilight

Then Bur's sons lifted the level land
Mithgarth the mighty there they made

Hearing i ask
From the holy races
From Heimdall's sons
High and low
