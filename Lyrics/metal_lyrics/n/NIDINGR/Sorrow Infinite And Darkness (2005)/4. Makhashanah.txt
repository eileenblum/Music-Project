daughter of Nuit
lady of the stars
the Bride of them that are vowed unto loneliness

she has the moon for a crest
and it is blazoned on her heart
she walks cursed in silver

the queen of all them that dwell in Heaven
the queen of all that are pure upon earth
the queen of all that sorceress of hell

blaspheme her
then suffer knowing her
for she is cold as your are cold
and she burns with your fire
