Who are you
that would penetrate the mystery
it is hidden unto the end of time

Sorrow is not
save in the darkness of the womb by whom
evil came

time is not
save the darkness of the womb of her by whom

in the aeon of my father there is no sound nor silence
in the aeon of my father there is neither life of death
in the aeon of my father is a god with clasped hands wherein he holds the universe crushing it into the dust that you call stars

and whoso has power to break open the sapphire stone shall find therein four elephants upon whose backs are castles those castles which you call the watch-towers of the universe
