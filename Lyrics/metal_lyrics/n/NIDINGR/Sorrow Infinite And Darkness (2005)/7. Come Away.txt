come away
out chariot is drawn by doves
of mother-of-pearl and ivory is our chariot
and the reins therefore are the heart-strings of men

come away
every moment that we fly shall cover an aeon
and every place on which we rest there shall be
a young universe rejoicing in it's strength
and we shall flee away
comforted

come away
the price of the journey is little
though it's bane be death
and you shall die to all
that you fear
and hope
and hate
and love
and thing
and are
