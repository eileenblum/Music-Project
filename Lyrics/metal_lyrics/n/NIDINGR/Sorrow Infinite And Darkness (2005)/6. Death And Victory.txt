my teeth are letters of the reverberating name
my tongue is a pillar of fire
and from the glands of my mouth arise
four pillars of water

blow all your trumpets
for I will loose my hands from the mouth of the lion
 and his roaring shall enkindle the world

I am the that swallowed up
death and victory
like the ash of dried leaves
the worlds are blown before me

let the stars burn in the fire of my nostrils
let the gods and the spirits and the demons and the angles be as motes dancing in the beam of my eye

it is hell unquenchable
bondslaves of the cursed
we give nothing
we take all
