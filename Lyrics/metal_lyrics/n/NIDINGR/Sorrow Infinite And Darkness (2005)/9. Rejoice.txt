Rejoice with me
O you Sons of the morning

gather yourself up upon me
and we shall play together
in the fields of light

I have gone forth to war
and slain him that sat upon the sea
crowned with the winds

I opened my eye and dissolved the universe
I put forth my power and he was broken
I gaze into the seven spaces and there is naught

rejoice with me
for you are born intro the new Aeon
you shall not suffer death
