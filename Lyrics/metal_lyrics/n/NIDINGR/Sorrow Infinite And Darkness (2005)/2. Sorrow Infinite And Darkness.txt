a sky of darkness covered
with stars of gold
angel wings hide all heaven

the terror of God
upon mankind
in Skies tremble
Aires fall

let the Sons of Earth
keep silence
for my Name become as that to death

cursed be the earth
for her iniquity is great
let Your Mercy be lost
open your eyes of Flame and Light
upon the wicked

I have conquered
but pain
sorrow and infinite
and darkness are invoked

mother unveiled herself
sister violated herself
the World is desert
and motion is ended for ever
