I AM the Child of Silence
I AM the surrounding of the four
I shall bring forth a universe of Darkness
I AM War

Lift your heads
my Father goes forth to judge the world

no man can hide
from my Fathers eye
in the Day of Judgment of my God

until the Book be opened
until the hour sound
until the voice vibrate
until it pierce my Depth

no hope
no god
no resurrection
no end
I fall
