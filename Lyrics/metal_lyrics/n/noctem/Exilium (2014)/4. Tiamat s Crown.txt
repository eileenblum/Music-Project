Trapped in the black veil of the night
Beholding the rupture of his dark sky
Indelible, immortal
Queen of the abyss
No order, no blame, no glare
Ancient inhabitant of a sterile land
Smilingly with contempt to the earth

His might is so above as below
The oceans shine in their hands like a gleaming sword

An evil older than men
And more extensive than the universe

Wake up and take your crown, mother of the depths

Show me the secrets of the ancient times
Give me the will, give me your throne

An evil older than men
And more extensive than the universe
