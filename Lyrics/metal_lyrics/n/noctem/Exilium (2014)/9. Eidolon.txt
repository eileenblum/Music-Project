Thamuz
Bring star of the morning
Lords of the worms and flies
Proclaimer of death
Emerge from the depths of the west
From the north sea
From the icy mountains
From the deserts of south
Devourer of deads
Reaper of youth
Defiler of corpses
Decimator of life
My body lies
On plain coiled snakes
Your wings surround me
Like branches with thorns
Come and crush the seven gates
The dead will rule the land
Wrap in fire my ulcerous body
Pulverize my bones
Sacrifice the beasts
Consume the forest in flames
Poison all the waters
Infect the air
The eternal flames of might dwells
In the impious flesh
Look at my eyes
I'm your creation stained of blood
I walk on whirlwinds as servant of hell
My body lies
On plain coiled snakes
Your wings surround me
Like branches with thorns
Ereshkigal queen of the dark dressed in silk
Honor me and receive my mortuary offering
Mother of violence and vengeance 
Enveloped in shades
