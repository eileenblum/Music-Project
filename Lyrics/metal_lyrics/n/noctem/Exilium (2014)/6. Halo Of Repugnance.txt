The empires fall down, transformed in useless ruins

Nobility of thought? In a material world inspired by desires
The dead hands of religion sterilize the wisdom

Mass of confused beings vanish in an atrocious fanaticism
Avid for love, needy of forgiveness mired in ignorance
Abstainers of the eternal pleasures, victims of massive fraud
Blinded by the faith for a puny god

Glorious ability to enslave a depraved animal
Through immaculate awareness

Redemptor of puritans, proclaimers of self-deceit
Orators of fraud with hypocritical complacency

Under the yoke of a fruitless falsehood
Commanded by the enthroned liar
Embraced by his eunuch host
The ice age of religious thought comes to an end

Sing praises to the wasteland
behold a forsaken and inglorious earth

("Faith means not wanting to know what is true."
âFriedrich Nietzsche)
