("And the forgotten gods will rise again, forever kings of the empty world, forever kings of everything in everywhere, taking of belongs to them, overthrowing every thing remains today")

Inglorious creator of the primordial earth,
God of the temple of tears,
unleash the hell from the abyss
The sordidness will gobern the earth

You wander on the edge of the void,
destined to defeat the skies,
you have sullied the sanctuary of blood,
lord of dishonorable sepulchers,
king of the black cript of pragmatism,
guardian of the spiritual beliefs.

Seeds of darkness, planted in the chasm,
cultivated between pagan rites

The wind crawl the stench of the death deity

Apsu take my voice, my will,
spread the truth across humanity

Lord of the great twelve kingdoms,
bless me with the breath of the eternal life

by fire or by sword , darkness light my way,
bring me the head of God.

The wind crawl the stench of the death deity
