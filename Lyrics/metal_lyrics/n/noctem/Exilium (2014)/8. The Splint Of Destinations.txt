Universal laws, enjoy your own suffering
Pathetic life, live on your knees

Govern all things, spread brutality

Weak-minded man, like an atrophied tree
Nazarene on the cross, filth larvae
You will be forever vassal, scourge of abject
Like straw on cyclone, disoriented beings

Design the future, yield all things

I raise the banner of the impure, sign of inexorable invasion

Glory to the strong they shall inherit the Earth
Cursed the weak they inherit the yoke

Destroyer of false hope, you are the real savior

Blessed iron hand, death to the weak
Worshiper of the gods, sheared sheep
Each verse is a bonfire, every word a flame
Abundance to the strong, poor moldy-minded man

Victory is the basis of all right
The truth sets to all men's free
Glorification to the mighty, free of a stifling dogma

("Cruelty is one of the oldest festive joys of mankind."
âFriedrich Nietzsche)
