("And they take the word of God as an easy auto response to the questions and designs of the natural order. At which point the man lost his connection with natural... At which point he rises as a cruel assassin against the Earth... Humanity is in a new age, the age of fight between mother and son.")

Can you feel that stench?
Is the human life, their bodies rot slow in time

Deification of mediocrity, exaltation of the rotting flesh
Glorification of pettiness, idealization of feelings

Oh! Shamash lord show me the path
The real sense of the human's life
Slaves of hope, blinded and weak
Embraced the torment and agony

Proud and frail, insolent men's race, owners of all things

As disease infecting a body, like a parasite feeds it's host
Arrogant and feeble, pathetic error of the gods
Ungrateful universal disgrace, unworthy animal
Your eyes reveal your misery you are the stigma of the earth
