Ia sanctus regnum mors.

Lifeless body, hear me now,
Open your eyes and listen my words,
Enforce my will, wake up and talk,
You who had a name, recover the will,
Rise up furious in the dark night illuminating the skies.
Livid and rigid, spread your death breath,
Look at me with your lifeless eyes,
Talk to me with your broken tongue
And whisper me the secrets of the beyond.

Cold in the cold land they lie,
Expiring their sins, slowly transforming in dust,
I call your soul once again,
Spirit of the night escape from your prison of flesh.

Come to me from the worms and dying flesh
Reborn from the grave, break your eternal sleep.
Lord of torments liberates this unholy soul,
Let that lead my path they who now belongs to the earth.
