Hail queen of the corrupted flesh,
Enlighten me with your cadaverous glare.
Dance among the coven flames.
Manifest! Dressed with infernal fire.

Ulcerated cadaver involve me in your scent of death,
Bereavement exequies and empty graves.
Ascend in furious fumes, spit in the calm waters of life.

You who fill of dreams to empty men,
Claim this soul exiled from the celestial realms.

Behold the wail of thousands souls...
I question everything; I don't accept asphyxiating dogmas.
There is no point to living in desire without hope.
Behold the wail of thousands souls, so tormented that fills the
Hearts with melancholy and shrinks the mans soul.

Morning star of sorrow, your roots rest in a silence garden,
Rises strong like an oak, in your branches lie the laments.
