I drown in a sea of prayings and sermons,
Blinded by a disappointing celestial light.

A cold fury, a bitter frustration.
Forbidden words, too many things to hide.
Cold blood, veins stopped and frozen hearts.
Mouths stitched and closed eyes,
God hasn't any plan for us.

I banished all my humanity, 'til my soul has been frozen and dark as night, clinging to a splinter of light at the foot of the altar of agony.

Wandering through the deserts of my loneliness,
Shrouded in an unsatisfied search for gifts.

A non-real life stagnant in human skin,
A non-real life in a land of wails,
Mouths stitched and closed eyes,
God hasn't any plan for us.

The will vanishes in an aura of pain,
Is this the torment inherent to the human life?
