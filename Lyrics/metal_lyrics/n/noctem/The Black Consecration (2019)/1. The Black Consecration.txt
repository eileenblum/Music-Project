I carry in my throat the bitter gulp of death,
I can't remember when I lost my faith and strength,
But I can see them in the distance judging me with contempt
And I just can admire his purity and firmness.

My body knows about the pleasures of pain.
My heart knows about its own delusions.

Under a storm of misery, with a lack of dignity,
Carving my sins in a land of lies.

I unearthed the ego roots dissolving my own essence.

This is the moment I began to believe, God is real... and he hates us.

I am nothing but a great stain on the light,
Only darkness can fill this total emptiness,
Let the storms take me away, to reborn as a new sun,
To conquer the skies, to illuminate this desolation.

[Chorus: Salve Belial, Salve Valac, Salve Asmodai, Salve Satan.]

I lost myself in a field of wounds, in the deepest of my humanity, transformed into ignorant and selfish flesh, walking alone in a path of thorns, as a naked figure, feeble in front of an hostile world.

[Chorus: Salve Belial, Salve Valac, Salve Asmodai, Salve Satan.]

This is the moment I began to believe, God is real... and he hates us.

May the wings of the winds carry my voices.
On earth only the worms await me,
But in the depths of hell our father.
