The twilight has arrived,
And from the night we emerged as the shining light.
The flames of hell burn virulently and purify our mangled souls.

Rise up like a sinister wind that freezes the unholy souls,
Revive those dark fears for us to drink once again from them,
Enveloping me with your shadow form,
Let me tell you my wishes in a mournful lament.
Come and profane my feeble body,
Come and embrace me in bitter agony.

I wasn't born to kneel for faith,
From false illusions, the hells are built,
There is no trial that humble me,
With a will harder than steel.
Wise of your own lies,
I am the sword that cut the winds,
A chalice full of truth, the light for the blind.
I am strength, the judgment, the death.
