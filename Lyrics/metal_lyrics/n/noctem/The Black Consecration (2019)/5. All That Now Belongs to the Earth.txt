Ave mistress of the flies! Queen of the larvae, keep scraping your strings loud.
Angel of death, raise the spirits of the Earth once again.

Exterminating angel, let your funerary veil fall,
This cold winds carries melodies and moans.

So full of life and death, cold a stone and a burning heart,
Lying inert and pale there where decrepitude and death converge.

Away from the right hand of God, accompanied by darkness, the Death setting the tone in his dark waltz.
Like the wolf that beholds the moon, in a perfect solitude, in a perfect silence, hushed and lethal, only accompanied by the stars, vanishing in the depth of the night, leaving no more than a sigh.

Chants and harmonies, the cracking of bones,
Cadavers yearning past times, along the devil's path.

Cold like a stone, so full of life and death,
Setting the tone of the waltz of the dead.
