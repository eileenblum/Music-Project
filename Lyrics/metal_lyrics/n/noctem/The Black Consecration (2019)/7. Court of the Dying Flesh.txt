Oh! Inert cold body, remember what one day you were,
Only memories accompany you, and the torment of your sins.
Dust to dust announced the false prophet,
Evidencing the tragedy of an end.
Embrace his eternal cold kiss,
Covered with the dark veil of death.

Delight me with your cruel pleasure,
Be the flames that turns me eternal.
Exhaled your last breath, letting scape your human essence,
Now you ride the freezing winds, bathed in infernal fire.

Carrion empire, angel of cadaveric fauna,
There is no peace, there is no eternal rest.
Eternal damnation, only bitterness and hatred remains.
Bring fright to the heart of the living.

Shine with your ominous light, in the dead of the night.
Deceased body your flesh rots but your spirit lives.
