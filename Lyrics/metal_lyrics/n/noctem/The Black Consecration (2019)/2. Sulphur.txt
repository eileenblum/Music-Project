Walk through the winds, infect my being,
Poison the earth, with the poison of truth,
Darkens the heavens, reborn again from your ashes,
Water your anger with the angels blood.
Be the voice of blasphemy, be the scourge of the weak.

I lost the shadow of compassion,
Beholding the eyes of a dying hope,
Searching to myself in the deeps of my darkness.
My hate has the hardness of a diamond,
He is the air that I breathe,
He impregnates every cell of my being,
He is the only one that dominates me.

My intelligence has fallen so many times
That prefer to live on his knees,
Then I discovered I know nothing,
I never was anything and I'm too tired to feel.

Death laid eggs on the bleeding wound,
My destiny is sealed in sulphur.
