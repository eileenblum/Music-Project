[Prelude:]
During the battle for supremacy, the spectra of destruction begot the Elect in the Earth so that, in case of defeat, this warrior could complete his fate sowing destruction in his path. He was not endowed with the gift of willpower not to become corrupt by the sad values of land; he was only blessed with the supreme gift of total destruction.

[Berserker of the destruction:]
Ia krol.
the deified by the death
carry me in your sword
blood for my gods
blessed at night
the son of the wrath
Reborn once again
abstracted in the infinite hatred
lacking of emotion
explodd in cholera
crossing the seven doors
discovering that he would never come back
you'll desire to die before the agony
just suffering
I'm a semi-god between the humanity
destroy your dream
I sacrifity your blood in the name of my god.
Ancients gods of destruccion,
Assume corpus meun bless my soul
Give me the force to spread the horror
my avidity for soul doesn't have end
nos servi, domini ex imber sanguine sumus.
Meg gods opplyse med det blod av din barn
men who walk to the light will have to see the shadows
you'll desires to die before the agony
just suffering
I'm a semi-god between the humanity
destroy your dream
I sacrifity your blood in the name of my god.
Ancients gods of destruccion
Assume corpus meum bless my soul
Give me the force to spread the horror
my avidity for soul doesn't have end
nos servi, domini ex imber sanguine sumus.
