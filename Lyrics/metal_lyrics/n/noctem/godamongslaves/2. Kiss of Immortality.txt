[Prelude:]
They lived together in perfect harmony, mortals and immortals, cradled by the uncertainty of years to come. Humans, clung on to a material world, swapped their original customs and traditions for an endless number of absurd cultures. Inmortals, reconciled by their need for sustaining themselves with the mortal blight, decided not to wipe it out thus coexisting with their faulty relatives in the eternity of shadows.

[The kiss of inmortality]

Sick thoughts in my mind makes me a mad hunger reborns in my soul. I'm crazed by the desire to kill. Fell my wrath
In the night the human lie in their eternal dreams
dipping in the trance, rotted by their ambition.
Desirous of power, harmless in the darkness
It's better to die than drink rotten blood
adulterated blood of putrid human.
Cloaked by their grey ladies the sky lying,
in it's moment of nocturnal life and moon beams start showing suddenly between the sad clouds.
the blood of the innocent'll always be the life
in one kiss, fear in the eyes, a scream that'll never be free
the innocent girl cry
my fangs in her throat are a crime
her sweet blood rains in my poisonous tongue
I don't know the mercy
the purity of her soul will be destroyed
Pleasure rivers bathe my sick mind taking me to the past
the piano plays a melody out of tone
while my body is bleeding,
crawling in search for response,
but alone I see the shade of my memories,
the blood flogs my evil heart
another star die in the far sky
the tenderness of an infant is added to my soul
a cruel pleasure in a murderer's life
the excitement the blood gives me the eternal life
Depriving things which are pure
Sowing the absolute wickedness
