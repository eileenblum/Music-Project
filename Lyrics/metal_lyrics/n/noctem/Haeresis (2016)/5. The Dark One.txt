Oh lord! Why you leave me?
I am your humble servant
Why you judge me like vermin?
I feel your divine look of scorn

Breaking Wheel Pear of Anguish, Judas Cradle, the Rack

Praying for mercy in disobedience to saint will
Without a fair trial, without absolution against transgression to the holy law
Clergy like hyenas, behold with satisfaction the suffering
Lucero "The Dark One", collector of martyrs for the pyre

The populace is horrified beholding his divine assignment

In the cold path to the scaffold
Shouting they curse the name of God
Eviscerated martyrs decaying
Insane devotion to the Lord
