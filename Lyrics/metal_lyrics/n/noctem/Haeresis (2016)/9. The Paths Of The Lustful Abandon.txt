Come to me between the shadows of the night
As the messenger of voluptuous pleasures
Be the mistress of my lewd and dark desires
Accompany me through the paths of lustful abandon

False god-fearing puritans

Adulterers addicts to the drip of the nectar of harlots
Fornicator, you rejoice in your sins
Like animals searching for satisfaction
For sweet flesh, for ecstasy, for pleasure

Slaves of the orgiastic pleasures
Being an lecherous progeny from the abyss
Lascivious creatures eager of obscenity
Eat and drink from me
