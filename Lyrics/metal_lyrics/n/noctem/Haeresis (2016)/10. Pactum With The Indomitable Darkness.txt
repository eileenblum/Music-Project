Arise strong! Lord of the immutable fire
Revealing the truths of the beyond
I find myself among miserable beings
Blinded by the heavenly light

Fearful creatures of the earth and sea
The darkness will descend on you once again
What torments you?
Hidden between empty prayers

Your revelations open my eyes and mind
I hear your secrets carried through the wind

Show me whe mightly darkness beyond
Damn this world stained with christian blood

Laurel wreaths at your feet
Lord of depravity

Liberate me from my inner pain
Caressed with the poisoned kiss of the earth
Spiritus, come from the lakes of eternal fire
I march on the unholy path alone

Laurel wreaths at your feet
Lord of depravity
