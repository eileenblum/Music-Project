Let me die, I raise myself to a new life
I want to be like death and bury my sins
I am a blasphemous creature of God
Behold what you have made me become

No man should bear such a heavy weight
On his shoulders, my penance is carved in my flesh

Do not fear the battle of men in the earth
The real war is being waged in heaven
There's no light in this impious soul
All that inhabits me is corrupted

This life is a paradox, amirror of confusion
I am like a candle without oxygen
I am a spirit lost in my latent hate
My wings are thorns, my eyes are lifeless
I am cold as the horns of death
