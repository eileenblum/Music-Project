Behold puritans! Your demented lord, amorphous creature-god, master of the lies, the last hope of the naÃ¯ve

Eunuchs legions, unwary and fool are added to your ranks
No more glorious days, you are a flash of deception in a sky ablaze

Ad nauseam! Lord of the weak
The heavens will crumble again
Like ashes in the eyes
Burning flame of self-deceit

Open wide the gates of hell
The heavens will serve at your feet
Be my light, guide my hands
Be the strength in my will

I am a blasphemy, a fragile mortal
An abomination to the eyes of god
I walk on the land with feet of fire
To be myself is my own law

Eunuchs legions, unwary and fool are added to your ranks
No more glorious days, you are a flash of deception in a sky ablaze
