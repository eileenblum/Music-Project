Alere flammam peritatis et lux in tenebris lucet, da mihi animas, caetera tolle, fiat lustitia et pereat mundus

Crowned as graceful instrument of God
An angel of holy judgement
Scourge of the blasphemer
Extirpator of confessions, eradicator of sins
Broken bones, agony melodies, suffering at the gallows

Sinner horribly disfigured for the rest of his life
Drowning in their own blood expiring their sins

De inquisitoribus lords of the pyre
De inquisitoribus against human sacrilege
De inquisitoribus of depraved souls
De inquisitoribus of heretical thought

Towers of lifeless bodies rise up from the world to the feet of your lord

Redeemer of deceased bodies
Tormentors of human souls
Damned faces of leering and drooling
That lack of the last breath of life

De inquisitoribus collectors of confessions
De inquisitoribus punishers of heretics
De inquisitoribus of adultery
De inquisitoribus of depravity

Messiahs of human agony, exercising divine will
