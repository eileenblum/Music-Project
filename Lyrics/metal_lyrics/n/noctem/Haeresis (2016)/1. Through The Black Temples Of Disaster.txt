Exsurge domine et judica causam tuam, fatum fatis ego perea

I've walked through the kingdom of the filthy ones
Justice accompanies tragedy and death

Temples erected to reach the stars
With its roots in the depths of hell
Lewd priests in search of power
Praying for cruel heavenly saints

Pyres of fire burn thousands
Souls purified with the flames of hell

Ministers of greed, ambassadors of the cross
Golden cloaks and sermons about children dying of hunger
Their lives are turned off
Like a multitude of living lamps

Queen of misery light my way through sin

I've inhaled the vapors of hell itself
The moon turns pale before me
Look at my eyes! I would like to storm the heavens and look for answers
The bright star of sadness hangs over the world to give justice and death

Contemplate the face of bitter pain that envelops the world of aridity

Walking through the black temples of disaster
Where light has turned into darkness
