A bitter confession plucked from her torn lips
Her words announced the end of her suffering and life

Auto-da-feÌ, ritual of public punishment
Auto-da-feÌ, burning at the stake

Yellow sackcloth, a procession in front of a court
No tears can reconcile with the cross

Using the sword to appase the enemies of faith

Consumed by the fire in an orgy of screams
Desperation, pain and suffering, enveloping her in flames
The fire melt her white flesh turning it black
Shedding her young body from her bones

Her body fat dripping from her corpse over hot coals
The wicker woman burned embracing her sins
Her yellow hair in flames is cradled by the black smoke
Teeth yoke from her burned face, showing an expression of horror

Being transtormed in thin powder
Thite ashes to ashes, thrown to the wind
