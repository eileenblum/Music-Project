[Contemplate in the eons of time the more biggest empire of the universe.]

Rejoice at your misery, as smudges of your imperfect world, disappear like whispers in the wind.
remain among the passing times, unknowing your brutal destiny.

[And the most powerful realms will fall shamed on our feet.]

Thousand battles, the destiny in his hands, 
You can contemplate his perpetual purity, the brilliance of his challenging look to the infinite appearing against God's wreath.

to acclaim IhÃº children  
khalÃ¡ bhu-hu children of Lhot
The masters of the light have met enraged by your decadence
cold as his look, imperishable Kings.

Contemplate me, I'm eternal.
I reborn with the power of a storm. Trapped by hatred and ire
My eyes are empty of harmony, Deep as the abyss.
Sons of the soberness, forged among steel and battles
elected to be the supremacy.

It will born a new tomorrow in which we will be praised like gods, Remembered among the course of the times
the skies are opened to host us in their protection, we have been elected by the power of light

[They will never ever be able to understand our power.]
