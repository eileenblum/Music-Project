can you feel it? It's approaching now.
Your body without response can only embrace the silence.

The monoliths are illuminated under the thin moonlight, 
the prayers were flooding the temple, 
Already can't  feel the breeze of the night yet.

you will not feel the roar of the storm in your skin, 
The heart doesnât remember the call of the battle

Time and space, they are stuck in sounds of cataclysm. 
You initiate your way beyond.
The path of the times appears before you.

Everything you know gets lost
A star leads you to Heleimâs Throne
The trumpets now acclaim your arrival across the gates.

Length is the path that governs your way, Darkness covers your soul
the shades of the spirits that have always been inside you.

Everything kneels down before you
your brands are distinctive of nobility.
The empires yield under your absolute might.

Your inside, nobody knows about you.
Cold like the steel that you clutch, 
your hands are stained with blood and now you prepare yourself for the glory. 

Length is the path that governs your way, Darkness covers your soul
the shades of the spirits that have always been inside you.

The monoliths will continue being illuminated by the moonlight, the prayers were resting in the temple
And your essence will be part of the roar of the storm
