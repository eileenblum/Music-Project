gigantic beams, messengers of death, reduced to ashes the whole men's race. Their corpses remained unrecognizable ... 
their hair and their nails were separated from their bodies... objects, houses, they remained pulverized.
its light, the one of ten thousand suns desolating this part of the land. 
All the force of the universe seemed to fall down on this region of the world 

The animals, birds and fishes, as the men, remained white. The trees dried off and all the food, got damaged.
All the force of the universe seemed to fall down turning all into thin powder.... its light, the one of ten thousand suns.

As a rain of fire, the divine punishment, the buildings crumble under the furious skies 
The deafening sound of the lands breaking under the feet, the fear invades upon the soul.

The shouts waved between the hurracaine winds, the cold of the water silencing the divine ire.
The biggest of the known civilizations sentenced to the failure, semigods condemned to the oblivion.
