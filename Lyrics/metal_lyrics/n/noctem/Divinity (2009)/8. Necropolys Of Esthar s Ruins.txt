Can you put your eyes in the distance? in the line of the horizon, 
beyond the twilight where the stones narrate their story, 
you can hear their sighs pushed by the wind.
EstharÂ´s the damned and desolated capital before the veil of the centuries.

The disease saddens and rots the inside of their hearts.

The weak light of the morning shows the putrid piled up of corpses
The enthronement reflex of the absolute chaos in the earth.
A world plunged into the horror, the infected air floods the streets of the town.

The strength of the divine ire that turnes up your world in misery.

Black death feeds your soul,
tortured spirits invaded by the rage.

The strength of the divine ire that turnes up your world in misery.

The moon governs in the peace of  the night when the corpses belong to the past without their skins. 
searching in your entrails it suppresses your sins the black crows devour your flesh.
The winds of the pestilence invade the valley submitting all of them to the devastation.

The strength of the divine ire that turnes up your world in misery. 
The vast and desert lands have been destroyed by the curse of the black death.
