A look, a sigh, a divine caress, a dream to fulfill.
I can touch with my hands the favor of the divine gods.

Ia set! Of the eternal deity, nourish yourself with mortal flesh.
The craniums are accumulated under your throne,
They glide with your golden wings.
Take my soul beyond of the stars,
let's overthrow the sons of Geb.

the lunar eclipse the might of a sun announcing death.

Apophis! more ancient than the memories,
beyond the line of the horizon
takes my offering divine. 
conquests the kingdom of flesh.
crown me beyond of the stars.
grant me the sacred eternal life.
