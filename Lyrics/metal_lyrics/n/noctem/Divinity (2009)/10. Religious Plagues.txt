you can now pray to the stars,
The sins excite you.
The hatred mar your senses 
And  feel the rain down on you, 
Getting wet your disfigured face,
crawling in the mud 

You liked to play with human lives. 

Trapped by the Celtic moon, you can't cry incessant suffering. 
Your face is the reflex of your soul
Captivated by the northern winds 
In the center of the storm of swords
You will never rest in peace

Do you think that I can't break your faith?

Sacred father bless me with your golden throne
The ancient gods are ashamed in their holy niche.
An inherited world corrupted by the ignorance. 

Death, war, disease, hunger, this is your future.
