Million legions line up behind our backs
The clamor resounds within the whole plain
The ecstasy overcomes our men
It's an honor to be in the first battle line

Attack with ire. Break his rows. 
Untie your fury. Sow the panic.

Stab his heart. Break his shields 
Transform him into a hero, a blood bath.

Destroy his towns. Burn his flesh.
Honor the gods, enslave all of them.

Take out his heart and steal his unholy soul 
sentenced by the eternity to be your last slave.

You feel the power in the battlefield 
Enthroned as a prince of the war 
You can't dominate your wrath and your hands tremble
Being the elected one before the very god's eyes
Born to reap lives

Take out his heart and steal his unholy soul 
Sentenced by the eternity to be your last slave.

Everything that has been murdered by you in battle will be your servant in Heleim.
