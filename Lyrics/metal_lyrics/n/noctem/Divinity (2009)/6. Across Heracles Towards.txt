The dark night shelters me with his mantle of stars and
the shy moon hides itself behind the subtle clouds,
when the rumor of the sea rocks the soul.

The calmed sea reflexes the infinite in all its radiance.

And more distant than the extensive oceans 
the constellations judge us like gods.
Can you feel now all the energy of the universe?

The flavor of the wine lulls my tongue
the cold sand from the shore makes me relive my defeats
the fragrance of the sea encroaches upon my mind

And for the first time feel the cold steel dancing on my wrists, 
It carries me to the infinite.

The tears begin to show up in your eyes, 
and a smile shows itself in your lips you know that your trip has started
The last war cry comes out of your throat. The cold encroaches upon you.

And more distant than the extensive oceans 
the constellations judge us like gods.

The tears begin to show up in your eyes, 
and a smile shows itself in your lips you know that your trip has started
The last war cry comes out of your throat.
The cold encroaches upon your universe.
You will never know a dawn.
Everything that you loved will be lost 
the eternal rest captures you
And you feel once again as the life escapes from your hands.
