âMaster of my thoughts, slave of my wordsâ¦ I am.â

The world was plunged in old age.
The sky became pale and the stupidity reigned over intelligence.
It dim and fade in a tormented life.
The whisper of the winds blow poisoned,
the green fields become gray,
the putrid waters remain in their absolute darkness.

Mangled and Infected.

Beyond human understanding,
in the eternities to come.
My soul is above the celestial laws,
Iâll never need to kneel down to a cynical god.

Shrouded in the darkness to escape a degrading and permanent enslavement
my body breaks down due to its physical decadence,
but my wild spirit will be free for the eternity.

Beyond human understanding,

Iâll never need to kneel down to a cynical god.

Shrouded in the darkness to escape a degrading and permanent enslavement
my body breaks down due to its physical decadence,
but my wild spirit will be free for the eternity.
