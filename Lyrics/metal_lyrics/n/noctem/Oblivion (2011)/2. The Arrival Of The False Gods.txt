"There would never be found enough words toÂ alleviateÂ the miseryÂ thatÂ CortesÂ took to MesoamericanÂ lands.Â Weâll neverÂ perform enough actsÂ toÂ redeem SpanishÂ barbarismÂ at the gatesÂ of the kingdomÂ ofÂ Yucatan.Â Not even each andÂ every dropÂ of bloodÂ fromÂ FrayÂ Diego deÂ LandaÂ will return theÂ descendantsÂ ofÂ YucatanÂ the codicesÂ and memoriesÂ he orderedÂ to burn..."

Axe, can you feel the flavour of glory?
The impious constellations rise up with me.
I'm on the real way to destroy the life.
Iâm the sovereign of all things. 
Decrepit vision of a dirty god,
slave, the whip will never leave your back.

A million souls in sorrow, your suffering are deserved.
Angel without wings, show me the face of your god.

Storm in my head, nature burns.

A million souls in sorrow, your suffering are deserved.
Angel without wings, tell me the name of your god.

Algol with his glow illuminates my way to madness.

Daring servant of double moral, 
unpleasant preacher's sermon.
Sinner embrace the divine impurity, 
larvae mass Mountains.

The unbearable true, 
death is the freedom, 
purity withers on your hands.

Forgotten exploits of the Messiah. 
Sacrilegious speakers of an abhorrent god. 
Turned into flames, 
Fire tongues are throwing silent prayers.

The blood of the forgotten Christ, 
carrions of a new world torn out from the bowels of the earth.

Angel without wings, the purity withers on your hands.
