âGovernedÂ by theÂ wheelÂ ofÂ life, where yearsÂ go by likeÂ ephemeralÂ secondsÂ inÂ aÂ spiral that connects lifeÂ withÂ death.Â  What would happenÂ if,Â by whimÂ of theÂ universe, deathÂ andÂ life are basedÂ onÂ a hypotheticalÂ temporalÂ paradoxÂ  whereÂ life and death areÂ mergedÂ together with millions of universalÂ stimuli whereÂ justÂ for once, theÂ moment ofÂ lifeÂ and deathÂ would leadÂ toÂ theÂ same being...?â

Dormant in his golden throne,
awaits me dreaming on the beyond.
Walking on the wind, orders to the stars.
Prevails over the light, lives on the flame.

Even the divine will succumb to the desire.
Thousands of gods like slaves incline for you.
Youâre being adored by ephemeral human lives.

Feathered snake, life and death emanate from you.
Millions of servants in the whole world,
magnificence of a true god.
Wrapped by funeral shade,
crowned with the pestilence of the divine death.

Dominant and proud, his death essence ends up prevailing.
You, who dwells forever and since the first dawn.

Feathered snake, life and death emanate from you.
Millions of servants in the whole world,
magnificence of a true god.
Wrapped by funeral shade,
crowned with the pestilence of the divine death.
