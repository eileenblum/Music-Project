Emaciated creatures, animals of the night
that move and look like us.
Abominable orators on the abyss gates,
with a semi human degraded being.

Hails to the sons of Hun-Vucub born between worms and grime.

Immaculate traveller from the far stars,
enjoying the misery of men.
His soul is as empty and dark as the night sky.
Up to the eternity youâll roam.
I am empty inside, but I carry the hate in the blood.

Hails to the sons of Hun-Vucub born between worms and grime.

Inhabitants of a larval life that are nourished from death.
Meanness offer,
source of infinite might,
carry me with you transforming my human soul.

Bless me father of the ancients, beheader of gods.

Take me; consume me in your frantic disease.
Ablaze my flesh, I burn plethorically,
Bless me once again beheader of gods.
