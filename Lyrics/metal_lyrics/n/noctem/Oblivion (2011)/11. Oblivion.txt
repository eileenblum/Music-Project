"FromÂ firstÂ toÂ lastÂ they will allÂ disappear.Â The cycleÂ will end and a new one will start,Â in the memoriesÂ ofÂ men they wonât be found and in those in which they are time will erase them, becauseÂ ancientÂ civilizationsÂ and religions,Â togetherÂ traverse theÂ pathÂ of oblivion.Â "

Iâm burning.
IÂ´m the ashes of my decay,
from the deep of my ruins.
sinners addicted to the forgiveness of a malicious saint.
Puppets of reduced will.
Handled at the whim of the master.
Rewarded with the oblivion gift.
Adepts to the infantile lasciviousness.
You sink between lethargic minds.

They Humbly pray into despair,
fade away in an ephemeral sigh of life.
My last willâ¦ Dethroning the corpse of Yahweh.
