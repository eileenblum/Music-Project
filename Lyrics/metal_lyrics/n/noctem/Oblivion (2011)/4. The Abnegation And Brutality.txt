âAndÂ thereÂ I found him. I could see him, immaculate,Â sitting,Â watching me.Â AndÂ I couldÂ feel his being,Â and I couldÂ feelÂ his presence.Â We were face toÂ face,Â his eyesÂ lookedÂ into mine.Â It wasÂ a cold stare,Â challengingÂ ...Â and only aÂ gestureÂ made meÂ realize thatÂ notÂ allÂ human livesÂ were worthÂ the same.â

Only aspire to the beauty while you rot inside.
You observe me like a whore, with desire and dirty repugnance.
But you drink of me to satiate yourself.
Youâve crossed the threshold, youâre victim of your desires,
glorified among the mediocrity, indoctrinated by prosaic beings.

âThe screams will never hold back the relentless fall of the blade.â

Possess the control of cities of bronze and stone.
The masses are controlled under the hands of terror.
Vanal crowd, writhing in pain,
between screams acclaiming for a semi god,
stupid scions aligned before a fickle messiah.

Unattainable, on the granite steps,
Sat in your throne,
you will soar over all things,
those beyond good and evil,
deciding the fate of the human life.

The blood shedding of your victims will never be in vain, with it you illuminate your path to eternity.
