"IÂ feltÂ victorious today,Â I felt undefeated.Â Among hazyÂ memories, embracedÂ to theÂ dimensionÂ of the dream,Â I livedÂ an extracorporeal trip which introduced me toÂ thousandsÂ ofÂ millionsÂ of lives.  ThisÂ eternalÂ journeyÂ took me along the linesÂ ofÂ space andÂ time,Â whichÂ myÂ mindÂ uninhibitedÂ performedÂ in a fewÂ minutes.Â There wasÂ onlyÂ oneÂ beingÂ thatÂ I felt and could notÂ findÂ on myÂ journeyÂ just likeÂ Friedrich NietzscheÂ saidÂ "GodÂ is dead orÂ perhapsÂ never existed"

On the loins of the feverâs deliriums
I crossed the hells of opium.
Without my eyes I can see beyond all the stars.
Iâm the writer of the Emerald Table,
Pythia at the Delphic Oracle,
Iâm a Babylon whore.

I see the ancient races, the immigrants of Atlantis and Lemuria, the billions of lives that have preceded me.

I'm an Isis priest, a slave in Egypt,
Tarpeya crushed, pupil of Socrates;
I parade with the imperial legions,
the Aeneas descendant.

I take a billion forms, I know all the lives,
I feel the entire universeâs knowledge,
but where does the divine grace hide?
Where are the wasted prayers thrown into despair?

I exist in all beings and all beings exist in me,
I feel myself in communion with the earth,
but god isn't in me.
