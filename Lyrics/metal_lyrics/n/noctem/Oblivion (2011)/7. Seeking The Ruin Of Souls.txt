"DamnedÂ in theÂ victoryÂ andÂ condemnedÂ in the memory.Â ItâsÂ theÂ storyÂ of us,Â the white bearded men,Â we findÂ theÂ newÂ land for the soleÂ purposeÂ ofÂ carrying ourÂ misfortuneÂ and expandÂ ourÂ brutality.Â "

Damned under the rays of the waning moon,
heâs buried in a blackened sky.
The mad will open the ways that afterwards the wise will cross.
There is no redemption in your homicidal lineage
tuck up your shame and despair.

No other sound than screams,
No other smell than death.

Unleashing death and destruction over his mangled souls.

Corrupted by greed,
blinded by your avarice,
he hides behind the hands of an inert god.

Unleashing death and destruction over his mangled souls.

Proud of your heritage? A legacy of death.
