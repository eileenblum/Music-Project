âBetweenÂ constellations IÂ await, hiddenÂ in an immeasurable iridescence, beyondÂ human understanding observingÂ theÂ continuousÂ twirls of the lifeÂ wheel. A newÂ cycle begins, endingÂ the one ongoing.â

Knelt down under the black veil of night,
Watching the eyes of an enraged sky.

Wrapped around the twisted trees,
The darkness of the marsh reflected his sheen.
To observe the eternal stars he was falling through the sun.
Fleeting fragments illuminate the human journey.

The glow of his decadence, the brightness of his purity.
Once again the infinite chaos is raised above all else.

Sacred Q'uk'umatz, awake from your sleep, spread your divine wings.

The stars rise up above all the infinite,
Until the spheres have turned twenty-six thousand years,
to line up the axis of the heavens and the past will come to you.
