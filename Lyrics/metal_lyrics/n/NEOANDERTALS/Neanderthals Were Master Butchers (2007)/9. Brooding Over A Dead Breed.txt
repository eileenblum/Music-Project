Hominids:
Australopithecus robustus with sagittal crests
Massive grinding teeth in a large lower jaw

Slave shells -- tough materia that needs a lot of grinding
Deformed creatures of a misshapen breed

Humans:
Slave masses traded in the neo-Neanderthal world
Valleys and roads with marching slave rows
Human meat has become a brand
A dead brand for a dead land
Last breed of man
Signals of the end of the progression of human history

Neo-Neanderthals:
An evolutionary dead end in the creation's chain
Butcherings through dead continents
Neo-Neanderthals the master butchers
