Homo neanderthalensis
A physically impressive species

Long ago, ancient ones were all foes

Struggle to survive
Systematic cannibalism
Pushed to Extinction
Anatomical beauties / monsters

A flattened cranium with a heavy brow ridge above large eye sockets
Higher muscle mass, wars among the proto-humans will last

Evolution's created perfect butchers
It's the lawless extremity of nature

Butchering -- the half-dead wallowing in their guts
Cutting the carcass in half starting at the pelvis
Cutting haunch from loin, rump from haunch

Separating the shoulder from the shank as close to the joint as possible
Sawed-off limbs quivering on the ground

Shank for chop meat
utilizing neck meat

Cutting through nerves, arteries split in two
The sound of slicing fills the air all around

Immersed in butchering, precise disemboweling

Ribs away from spine, separating chuck from the loin.

The pre-human butcher is obsessed with the bedimmed procedure
The epic ambition of this work is to separate flesh from the soul
Thick fat away from chops

No signs of charring, the flesh was eaten raw
Skinning their own kind, cannibalism within the ancient tribes
The skin will come loose from around the meat

The skinned carcass was stripped of meat and marrow

Dead trees seeing all the killing and skinning and cleaning and gutting that hath
been done
This is the dark side of the pre-human coin

Never its mysteries are exposed
To the human eye so unclosed

Neanderthals were master butchers
