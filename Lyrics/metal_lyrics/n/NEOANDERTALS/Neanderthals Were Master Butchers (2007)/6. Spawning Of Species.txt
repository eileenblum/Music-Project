Restoration

With spawn of the ancients, there appear different forms of the ancient hominids

Respawn from the caves of Atapuerca
Neo-Homo antecessor reclaiming dead Spanish ruins
In dark Africa the undead neo-Ardipithecus ramidus -- a forest dweller -- consuming local tribes
The lessons of Neander Valley are not over yet
The main cave site for the undead breedings
The shells of the dead reawaken
Spirits moving musically back to the mortal coils
The not-defleshed ones growing back dead flesh
Yellow light revealing dead tissue on half-dead beings
Ancient Neanderthals have stillbirths and procreate as dead ones

Self-destructing continents enslaved to concrete aggression by the ancient breedings
