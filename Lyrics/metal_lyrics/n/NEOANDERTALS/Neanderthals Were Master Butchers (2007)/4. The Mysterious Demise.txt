The demise of an era...
The dying of a species...
The vile work of death...
The purifycation of blood...
...is the will of evolution

Before the bright red sun
A shrouded, massive monolith of clouds, a scattered living maze
In Neander Valley, a crust of sleep laid on them...
A group of men wrote the human history by driving all the remaining Neanderthals into Neander Valley and decapitating them
The last dead Neanderthals were not defleshed -- the shell can meet its ghostly owner once more

The mysteries of evolution/ the birth of the first human myths
The mysteries of evolution/ systematic births and deaths lead to chaos
The mysteries of evolution/ stocky and intelligent humanoids meet death
The mysteries of evolution/ the birth of death

A time will come when dead Neanderthal forms breed and feed again...
