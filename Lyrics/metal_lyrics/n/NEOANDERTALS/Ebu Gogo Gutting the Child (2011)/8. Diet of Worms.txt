For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Girl: a cold body and beautiful hair and blood and a cunt.
Here lies their love all cut, the young daughter in the dust
Victim of primate lust
Slowly spewing pus

The carrion worms are holding a feast
Craniums with barely some skin on them
The corpse as skinny as a skeleton
She is mighty pretty
Touching gently her awesome body
All ribs under her skin revealed
Just gorgeous
Matching the grey bone structure of the walls
A woman's death, perfected
The empty shell is being torn and worn

Tonguing through the maggots
Hardly reaching her pussy
Still wet from rot
You should lick that - not

Breasts taken with a blade
Left to decay in a shallow grave
The remains cast into the cave river hellish red
Worms in ears
Some graves the tropical jungle bears
Over and over again
