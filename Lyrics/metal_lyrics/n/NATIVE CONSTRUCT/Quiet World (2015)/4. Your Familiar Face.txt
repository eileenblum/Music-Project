You and I
Could be entwined in love for the rest of our lives
And yet I can't begin
To utter words of my affection within (to you)

But love always finds a way to speak out
I'll write the words I can't form with my mouth
And I'll wait for you to change your mind
And to find - find the love you keep inside

I'll write you these letters that speak straight from my heart
I'll tell you my secrets and share all my dreams with you
But love is lost on you, as it seems
So I try to move on, but still
Your familiar face lingers around

You should be
Composing symphonies of love with me
And yet it's he and not me
This world was meant for only two and not three (two, not three)

I suppose it isn't your fault you don't care (not your fault you don't care)
'Cause no one said that this life would be fair
But when you scatter these letters across my heart ('cross his heart)
You leave (him) - leave me with a burning scar

I wrote you these letters that spoke straight from my heart
I told you my secrets and shared all my dreams with you
But love is meaningless, as it seems
So I try to move on, but still
Your familiar face lingers around

You will never understand what
It is like to be torn down and forgot
To live life ever needing what
Will forever be outside of your clutch
You have left me alone with my mind
You have left me to discover my sinister side

But still, your familiar face lingers around...
