I am marched to the gallows, for I've done so much wrong
She was just a child, but now
In Silence she lies
With all her innocence gone
I have begged for forgiveness 'till the days grew too long
For my mind and my soul to hold and endure the disgrace
But death will rid me of this state

Silence has called me back
To let me be with you at last
I'll feel your innocent face again
I won't hesitate to return
(Bring him back)

Bring me back
(Let this noose start your passage)
Bring me back!
(Let it bring you back!)
Bring me back, for I still long to see her
Without the weight of this misguided place
I will transcend thee
Misery, oh how I've wished to suspend thee
Harmony, I will befriend thee in death

What is this horrible place?
Why aren't my torments erased?
Where is my coveted piece of harmony?
They promised I'd feel your fair face

Oh Sinister, your trickery!
This was your plan along
Condemning me for my devilry
I was wrong
And now I know that there is no escape

I could beg for forgiveness as these foul winds howl on
But my soul is wreathed in black
Perhaps this is just where I belong

And finally I see her face
"My precious darling, how I've longed to hold you!"
But as my hands approach her face
She turns to a wraith to rule my fate
I am cursed to eternally face the sins I have wrought
Her eyes ablaze, she tells me I will never see light
