Laughter, in every corner, the devil smiles within me.
Creeping shadows, hungry eyes, thirsty claws from dreams torn free.
A spectral masquerade, in eerie veils of dark,
the ghosts are gathered in a fleshless Danse Macabre.

Silent whispers - the beast approaches - an itching breath upon my naked skin.
Monstrum horrendum, informe, ingeus, cui lumen ademptum.
Demon claws streched out for meâ¦

But when I close my eyes it disappears. I'm still alone within myself.
Oremus!
Munda cor meum ac labia mea. "The void is dark and so is thee".

Behind the mask of weeping stars, a black and bloodless heart,
behind the shield of mirrorglass.

With broken wings in the dust they crawl,
the angels feathered in dark, as dying slaves of a withering god.

A voice to strangle me, like dead fingers upon my throatâ¦
"Obey me! Let me sculpture thy flesh to reflect my dreams,
purge thy blood to be, from death and darkness - forever free".

I close my eyes to fall asleep, within the dust of blood and shattered memories.
Another dreamâ¦ De profundis clamaviâ¦
