Darkside whispers draws me closer, obscures my mind with dreams.

From the lurking dark a serenade. Emotions in rapture are dancing my way.
Chimerical shades of diabolic plague. The overture of dreamers ballet.

Mesmeric voices of the Empyreal, like velvet hands that caresess me.
The enchantment of Sirens, as within a dream that I'm bewitched to see.
With tired eyes as the bewitchment to fade,
I'm able to see beyond the masquerade.
The Sirens hands, now harlot claws that shreds,
my naked skin, to taste my innocent flesh.

Naked pale incarnation of night. Riding forward over blood-shedded skies.
Erotic huntress, for thy pleasure I bleed, like wine my blood shall nourish thee.
Midnight Diana like a flickering dream. Revelation, me from life shall redeem.
Moonlight jewelry in her ebony hair,
as one with stars in her spellbinding shimmering glare.

I taste a kiss from her sinister lips, within my veins now flows,
the blood of the angel of death.
Like the whispers of night through the shadows.
By wisdom drunk from the fountain of dreams to come.
A silhouette towards the drama of nightfall,
in silence I remain - my time will come.

I close my eyes, drunk by the knowledge of secrets.
I drown myself in the fountains of time.
I hear the sound of angels weeping,
to greet my sleep among the dreamers, in the land of divine.

Nocturnal voices through the shadows of dreams,
towards the twilight, draws me closer to thee.
Thy mirage beckon me to see the unseen,
a fleshless spirit upon the moonlit scene.
I dance with fallen stars, above the icons of gods.
My mind is free to soar, within the spherical dark.
I vanish into thee, oh mistress of mysteries unseen.
My heart shall beat as thine, as we embrace under the blood-shedded sky.

I taste a kiss from her sinister lips, within my veins now flows,
the blood of the angel of death.
Like the whispers of night through the shadows.
