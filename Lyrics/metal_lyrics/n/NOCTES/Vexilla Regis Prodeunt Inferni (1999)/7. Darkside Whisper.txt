[The voice of a feminine divine power]
"For I am the first and the last. I am the honoured one and the scorned one.
I am the whore and the holy one. I am the wife and the virgin...
I am the barren one... (and many are her sons)...
I am the silence that is incomprehensible... I am the utterance of my name".

Chaos... Gaia arose from the shadows, to spawn,
the most ancient, tremendous gods.

Erebus unfurls his cloak over Arcadia, his eyes as dark as sin.
His sensuous gaze is yearning for, the gentle light from Eos face.
Selena, pale and tender goddess, on the twilight sky enthroned,
the tenebrous waves of Nyx, with silver sparks,
like ice and diamonds, she strews.

From the Olympus heights, the palace of gods,
the wrath of the vengeful Zeus, like thunder and rain,
to flood the oceans, united in grand deluge.
All is dead, an ocean lies vast and silent,
covers the earth - to drown the sins of mortal life.

The blood-stained Parnassus above the ocean,
to behold a new aeon as Eos raise.
The rebirth of Chaos, life and plague,
another dream to flourish, in the Arcadian soil.

From the shadows of a dark serenade, the origin of legends and tales.
An ode to the undead, the divine and forlorn.
Like whispering voices in me, from the Olympus hymns torn free.
From the Parnassus heights I see, the arriving nightfall to be.

A new dominion, another creation, as gods to walk the earth.
Shadows spawned in the deep, ghastly creatures
emerging from the surgy ocean, so black.

I now can see, no longer blind.
Bloodthirsty tongues speak within me,
Incubi wrath within my dreams
the voices of the maleficent gods, like a crescendo of dark.

Chimaerical whispers from mythical dreams, entices me,
to see with their eyes, the mysterious landscapes unknown,
yet hidden from the blinded mind.
