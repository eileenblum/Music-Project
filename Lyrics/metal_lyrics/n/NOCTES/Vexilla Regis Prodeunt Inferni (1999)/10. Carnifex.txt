With ebony-feathered wings through the dark I fly.
I am the night-spirit.
Like a shade upon the star-spangled sky.
Alone, like a voyager of dreams - unknown.
I fly away - through the shimmering moonlight.
I ride the frozen winds of twilight until the end of time.

The sun has fallen from the sky, into a roaring sea of blood to drown.
Never again to spread its tainted light,
upon the flooded shores of Eden.
Never more - will the sun arise from the horizon.
All is dark and silent.

My raven eyes, like astral fire, beholds the desolate lands below.
I feel the pulse of nocturnal wisdom - within my heart.

Enrobed in black - above the meadows of Eden.
The moon reflects upon my - somber wings.

So endless dark, the aeons to come will be.
I soar into another dream.
I am as one, with the night that burns in me.

From the gardens of stars a carillion serenade,
invites me to the twilight, invisible, ballet.
Dancing with ghosts I darkly parade,
as a shade in their grotesque act of masquerade.
Behind a smile of revelation I hide, under the cloak of time.
I'm the misanthropic Messiah in disguise, from the shadows to rise.

The drencher - divine. A deluge from my celestial skies.
Spattered in blood, my angels I deign to drown.
Dei gratiaâ¦Carnifex.

Another dream, from sinister tongues, whispers crawls in me.
"The vast is thine - without form, and void".
All is calm. Beneath my wings the plain lies dead and silent.
Another dawn, a new beginning.
Another breath before the dark.
