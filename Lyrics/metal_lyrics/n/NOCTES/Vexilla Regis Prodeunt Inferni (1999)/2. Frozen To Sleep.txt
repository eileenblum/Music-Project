My canvas smeared with blood-red tears. Lachrymation of the dead.
By life betrayed to endless sleep, to live within a dream.
Once dressed as white as winter snow, now drenched in blood I lay.
The pulse within, like ice still pounds, like frost throughout my veins.

In blindless crawls, through the maze of time,
through the sinister dark, the meander of dreams.
My hear is cold, every beat now hurts.
As a sculpture of stone I rest.

As a statue with a broken heart, in my gallery of dreams as art,
as lifeless drawings to behold and explore, my life within the dark.
Embraced within the veils of death, encircled in its web.
To witness life beyond the dead, on dreamers doss I lay.

A reflection of my past, from the unknown mirror glass,
beholds my sepulchral rest.
As a shadow of me from death torn free,
to walk the path of dreams.

My canvas smeared with blood-red tears. Lachrymation of the dead.
By life betrayed to endless sleep, to live within a dream.
Once dressed as white as winter snow, now drenched in blood I lay.
The pulse within, like ice still pounds, like frost throughout my veins.

I follow his call from the other side and leave my petrified flesh behind.
With the part of me that never died, I finally unite.

Across the twilight sky I fly, to greet the final death, to die.
As an entity I leave this world, eternal sleep awaits me.

The pulse within, like ice still pounds, like frost throughout my veins.
