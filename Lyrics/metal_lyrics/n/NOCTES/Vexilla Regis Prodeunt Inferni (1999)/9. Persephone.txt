Fingers cold as ice to strangle as together we lay in our deadly embrace.
The winternight fullmoon proclaims our marriage,
our funeral romance under the shadow of death.
Behind her smile, within her body they crawl, maggots feasts upon her.
My bride now to be, as with her rottening lips, a venomous kiss she gives me.

As lovers we lay, while the darkness we sway.
United in death in our deadly embrace, in hedonic disgrace.
As silhouettes wrapped in somniferous plague.
I desire for thee, oh pestiferous queen,
amorous bride in lustfilled sensuous dreams.
Together with thee in phantasmagorian sleep.
A field of unknown pleasures, fruits of passion for us to reap. An erotic tragedy.

Symphonic memorial requiem, as whispering tones to our grave.
An orchestral ode us to welcome, to Hades domains of the dead.
By darkness caught in its smothering snare.
Lifeless we lay under the corpsecandle flare.
But the fire still burns in our hearts.

Persephone. I crave for thee as I, slowly dies.
Like poetry, thy whispers in my mind. Forever to dream under the cloak of time.

Like visionaries of the dark we merge, together to explore.
Our passion, hidden, from the depths of our hearts, now to reveal our sacred love.
As lovers we lay in graven glare, by ambrosia drunk in somniferous atmosphere.

Behind her smile, within her body they crawl, maggots feast upon her.
My bride now to be, as with her rottening lips, a venomous kiss she gives me.

As lovers we lay, while the darkness we sway.
United in death in our deadly embrace, in hedonic disgrace.
As silhouettes wrapped in somniferous plague.
I desire for thee, oh pestiferous queen,
amorous bride in lustfilled sensuous dreams.
Together with thee in phantasmagorian sleep.
A field of unknown pleasures, fruits of passion for us to reap. An erotic tragedy.

As moonlight spreads its ablazing gaze upon the realms of Hades.
Frozen in a raptured embrace as sculptured art of frost, as one,
accreted in our death we lay.
Her face is pale as wintersnow, her body is numb and bloodless.
