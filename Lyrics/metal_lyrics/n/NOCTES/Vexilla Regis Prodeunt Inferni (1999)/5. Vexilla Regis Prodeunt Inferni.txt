Beware-with the dark I ride as one. When my legacy I reclaim.
As a fallen god, with the lunar legions by my side.
On dragon wings I fly. Behold - the ethereal shades of night.

Pletoric formations of dark dancing past the aeons of the eleusinian vast.
Within a dream, my honour to last, to sprout throughout my blood,
to strengthen my heart.
The heaven torns apart as twilight shreds and thunder.
With a vampire breath I whirl the frost, to storm within my kingdom to come.
Dead winter enthrones.

Vexilla regis produent Inferni.
As a phantom of night I ride, by thy side.

The Archangels revocation of the dead.
The apocalyptic revelation.
The arrival of plague and death.
The Armageddon revolution - to come.

Astral sparks of fire, descending to ablaze.
The landscapes drained by sulphur rain
from the canopy licked by flames.
Shadows walks the earth, to ravish life and glee.
To walk the fields of reverie, sowing dark in dreams to be.

Beware-with the dark I ride as one. When my legacy I reclaim.
As a fallen god, with the lunar legions by my side.
On dragon wings I fly. Behold - the ethereal shades of night.

Claimant - the silence - as blood to my ears.
The battle screams echoes has vanished, faded into the past.

The black sun is falling into the abyss,
with the lakes of dark blood to merge.
The sky is aflame, when I ride through the night,
as a phantom through fire I fly.
Armageddon... The final redemption of wrath.

Dies Irae...
