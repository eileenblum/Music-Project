I am the wizard, thy inner mirror, of thy unconscious
presence. A demon from within.

I am the frozen memories, reflections of the past.
In dreams I reveal myself to thee, exploring
the meander of thy mind.

I'm reviving visions left unknown, to make thee see,
thy life to be. I whisper secrets in thy dreams.
I show thee fractions from beyond, thy conscious life
reality. I am thy inner, predacious entity.
In a higher sphere I welcome thee to resign
thyself to me.

Within my dream dominions, I am supreme.
Thy soul is mine to shape, a naked canvas,
to project my paintless drawings,
my demonic fantasies upon.

Colder than ice my black heart pounds.
Within thy thoughts, I am as god.
I am thy inner voice from deep inside.
I make my will be thine.

I thrive inside of thee, thy soul is mine to conquer.
Thy weakness makes me stronger, thy thoughts
is mine to devour. Within thy mind corrosion,
my worms will gnaw.
My tongue commands the legions, of malicious
whispers from the dead, the voices laughing
inside thy head.
I am the wizard, thy inner mirror, of thy unconscious
presence. A demon from within.

I will not rest until my nightmare - is thine.
I'll never free thee from my spell, thy soul is bound,
to within darkness dwell.

A demon from within...
