A noble szejke born and bred 
Full loftily I held my head 

Great Attila my sire was he 
As legend he left to me. 

A dagger, battleaxe and spear. 
A heart to whom unkown is fear 
A potent arm which often has slained 
The tartar for in fields and plains 

The scourge of Attila the bold 
Still hangs amoung us as of old 
And when this lash we swing on hig 
Out enemies are forced to fly 

The szekle proud then learned to know 
And strived to become his foe 
For blood of Huns runs in his warm 
And will know to wield his arm.
