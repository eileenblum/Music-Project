From dreams of prudence I shall rise, 
to flee the grave where I was bound 
With wings of knowledge beyond divine 
and ride the winds through landscapes wide 
My ancient wisdom shall be spread, 
within the vast of goodness fed, 
On waves of time, as one with dark 
among the stars aeons yet to spark. 

Upon the the cross of might I'm crucified 
paradise-no place for me to dwell 
Within the heart of diuvnal harmony 
eternal-as one with the dark, 

My eyes devours the rays of glee 
the lurks its way through the shadows 
I'm guarding secrets soon to bloom 
in the dust of Edens meadows 

In prophecies unspoken Im to seek 
the black strain of dawn. 

From dreams of prudence I shall rise, 
to flee the grave where I was bound 
With wings of knowledge beyond divine 
and ride the winds through landscapes wide 
Within the voids of endless dark 
I'm still waiting for an eve to come 
when my ancient wisdom shall be spread 
within the vast goodness fed. 

Roses spawn from moonlight streams 
to disperse the seed of evil dreams 
Encircles me with necromantic thorns 
to shred the grace of paradise 

My eyes devours the rays of glee 
the lurks its way through the shadows 
I'm guarding secrets soon to bloom 
in the dust of Edens meadows
