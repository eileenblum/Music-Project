Midnight-from starlight caressed by silver shades of the mon 
the nightfall-my darkness to sway 
As I lay undivulged-embraced in the darkest of tombs 
to spawn the purest of wombs 

With claws of darkness angels shred the beauty in my holyness 
and cast me down through the voids of endless time 
from the throne of life 
As memorial choires penetrates the silence where I breathe 
Nocturnal hymns of blasphemy-pleadings for my goddess to rise 

Oh quess of death serve me thy nectar 
let me taste the blood of immortality 
Ler me see the pleasures that awaits me 
in teh stupor passion of dying 

My lungs burst by wisdom 
as I breathe the secrets of ancient dark 
aroused by the queen of shadows 
to hunt as one with stupendous nights 
I am to rise above consumption 
mesmerized by wisful thoughts 
Amonth the darksome dreamers flowing 
on waves of living lifeforms loss 

Each fraction of a day-nocturnal patience 
Purgatory Temptations 

The angels slained and smothered brings me flesh to my bones 
Incarnate from my cradle I'm to rise from below 
Unhallowed by the specious, a new messiah in sickness form 
to decieit the feeble mortals and the celestial sphere usurp 

My lungs burst by wisdom 
as I breathe the secrets of ancient dark 
aroused by the queen of shadows 
to hunt as one with stupendous nights
