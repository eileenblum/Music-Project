Pale and speechless in reflection gazing past 
as diffusion to adorn the vast 
As the crescent moon adept in glare 
by the flames of evil in my stare 
Broken by the spell invoked by time 
Grim but gracious through the landscapes wide 
the drapes of nightfall once again to ride. 
Through apertures in the web of stone 
shadows sweeping through my dungeons walls. 

As the sun in frailty sprawls to rest 
in the haze of dreamers nest 
Across the sky the angels sweep 
drawing sunset with the dayrays left to reap. 

To cherubic tones of hymnody 
the winds of medieval plague to dance 
Towards the scenery agaze, 
at the canopy ablaze. 

Oh how I envy thee, oh pagan gale to travel. 
In the twilight elysium to ride. 

As the sun in frailty sprawls to rest 
in the haze of dreamers nest 
Across the sky the angels sweep 
drawing sunset streams. 
As the night approaches me to reave 
the remaining rays of daylight stream 
I dream of sunsets yet to be 
when the twilight spell will set me free 

Twilight Elysium
