I raise the chalice high 
cursing god, and his crucified son 
I drink to ease the pain, to forget your acrid treachery 
the beauty you took from me, to decay into eternal sleep 
I drink the blood from thee 
oh graceful bride below the deep 
In silence, I can hear you calling me 
In silence, within the heart of despair 
In silence, from a distant dream, I can hear you scream 
Am I the one to set you free? 

Usurper of dreams, of blight and disease 
undivulged in a world of desires 
Let me fall from this earth, for a dismal rebirth 
in the land of the countless departed. 

My love, I crave for thee 
let me join you in your direful dreams 
I leave the diurnal light 
to grope trough the domains of eternal night 

Wanderers of dark, let me sour through the gates 
let me perish among these immortals 

World of dreams, open your arms 
let me perish among these immortals 

Usurper of dreams, of blight and disease 
undivulged in a world of desires 
Let me fall from this earth, for a dismal rebirth 
in the land of the countless departed. 
In sparking art of shimmer 
my gaudy bride appears 

She sails in darkly beauty, pure she greets my eyes 
approaches me like an angel, beyond all life she flies 

She takes my hand and whisper, this life is not for thee 
Good-bye my sweet beloved, we weren't meant to be 

World of dreams, open your arms 
let me perish among these immortals. 

From flames of darkness, I can feel my mistress beckon 
In dismal drams incarnate, in a distant world of disillusions 

A memory of passion, remains within my heart 
I am to die now, to join you on the infinite path 
Oh sceptred mistress, from dreams of passion spawned 
My queen of beauty, through darkness we will walk.
