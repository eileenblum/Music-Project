The oath of dark enigmas-my return 
Requiem-my memorial prevail, the graven 
stench aurora to inhale 
The latent dreams to burst from moonlight streams 
within the cryptic woods that I pervade 

Noctabulant-redivivus to reave, in nightmares to encyst the Empyreal, 
Incestous-A nightwalker to be, to stumble pathways for eternity 

Impious nymph in blood-stained bloom, an astral incarnation 
Amourous night enrobed in black-Lamia of dark temptations 
Appears before my eyes 

The curse of time I've laid on thee, to taste my tragedy 
I banish thee to my dader dreams, predacious in my 
primacy 

Lamia 

Noctabulant-redivivus to reave, in nightmares to encyst the Empyreal, 
Incestous-A nightwalker to be, to stumble pathways for eternity 
Ominous the darkness heaves by shados opaque plethora 
Burn! 

She casts her vesture over me and bites my neck 
so blood pours free 
I let her drink from my pounding veins 
the essence worn that flows within 
O Lamia in blood-stained blood in darkness dressed 
as one with night. Embrace my soul in dreamers death 
unchain me 
from the aching waves of breath 

Lamia-Nightly ornated nymph 
I let her smother me, while precious pathos whine 
flows free 
I watch her eyes like burning stars upon the nightsky 

The exquisite bride of sombre shades now turns away 
to darkness fades 
Ophidian born dark entity, to meet her master, 
his sable majesty 

Alone I stand as shadows calls, with clamant 
pleased for help they fall 
As sunlight spreads its sparkling glare 
yet behind my back I feel her spectral stare 

Lamia-Nightly ornated nymph
