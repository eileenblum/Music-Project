The sunlight sky is fading, in different shades of dark 
A spellbound day has ceased, and drowned within the past 
The mighty sun is dying, the fairness torns apart. 
Those silent days are over and disappears within the dark 

Tones from spheres pulsating, the darkest eve arise 
The gleaming sun is drowning in ancient lakes of time 
Alone I watch the sunset, pale and dead inside 
The sunlit sky is fading, and just like me it dies 

A lightning stream of sunlight is brightening up the dark 
The dawn of a new beginning as I wake up once again 
Kissed by holy sunshine, blessed with sin I'm raising 
Over dewdrowned fields I soar, a godless butterfly 

A sparkling ray so bright, with sacred angel flies 
Through dreams thates fed with light, where daylight never dies 

A butterfly, a holy one 
a spark within the dark 
I dare the night, I soar with thee 
U dream the sights, you'll never see 

Kissed by holy sunshine, blessed with sin I'm raising 
Over dewdrowned fields I soar, a godless butterfly 

But dreams are never true, I'm back were I began 
Where daylight fades to dusk and darkness overwhelmes 
I wish my dreams were real, but life is not to be 
that harmless butterfly, that dies inside of me
