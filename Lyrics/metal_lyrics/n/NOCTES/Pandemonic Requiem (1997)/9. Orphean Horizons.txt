Within the winter full moon gloom, where global frost endeavours 
Life fragile shades the angels dance, to bless my soul in evil 
Enigmatized-Enclosed in white, the path of dreams I wander 
To seek the landscapes I decieved, to hunt the lute of endless life 

Symphonic orisions- to guide my journey through the night 
Orphean Horizons-seduces me towards the light 

Gazing past the winter scene, the fields of dark contiguity 
Obliged to see the myth reveal, I submit to the bounds of soverignty 

Life no longer serves my pleasure, broken by the worms of time 
I yearn to greet eternal slumber, enshrinded within the depth of death 

Dispersed across the winter sky 
the lost ones that from death have fled 
Like lucid art divests the heavens 
in pulsating waves of patterns red 
Swirling storms of dust 
embraces me to blind my sight 

[Chorus]

I Close my eyes to die in peace, no longer life can me deride 
I lay myself to greet the vast, to fade away within the night 

[Chorus]
