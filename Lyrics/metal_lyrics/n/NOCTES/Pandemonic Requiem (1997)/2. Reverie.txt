Archangel dark in raven garb. 
Revelation of dreams to follow. 
Apocalyptic shade triumphant the night. 
Aroused to guide my shadow. 

Wings of twilight carries me. 
Through graven dreams and mysteries 
Upon the moonlit wintersky 
In midnight drama I greet the silence. 
The dreams I reap Hedonic feast. 

An ode to flesh and darkness 
Euphoric tones inveigle. 
From the shades ululation whispers 
To lure me through the veils of time. 

Demons-Departed souls of the dead. 
The decipies of dreams 
I'm driven to their depths. 

From my reverie awaken 
Frostbitten by the snow 
Lying dead but dreaming 
In winterdoss entombed 
Buried in the semblance 
Of a nightmare yet in afterglow to sprout. 

Wings of twilight carries me. 
Through graven dreams bad and 
Upon the moonlit wintersky 
In midnight drama I greet the silence. 
The dreams I reap Hedonic feast. 

Mysteries unknown reality past 
Visions from dreamlands so dark. 

Midnight drama dreams flows free. 
Aeons past in Reverie 
Embedded in the veils of time 
Mummified Embraced in rime 
Voyager of depths unknown. 
Sceptred with a thorned crown 
My soul is bound to seek again. 
Within the voids where life and death descends 

Reverie
