Your soul is ready inseminated their thoughts their love their hate broken muppet you must survive gaze inside no more soul desperation altered in high performance machines devastated like an afterwar field what you lose of yourself try to triumph over this scum thrown in this their reality lab of their will you have to share your world with those snakes please don't stop your own production of venom thrown in this their reality slave of that your cupidity never no more never no more my choices were yours my life was yours but will it change.
