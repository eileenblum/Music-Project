Let it bleed cause it shuts the doors the same doors you thought slammed in your face does bleed you've just thrown yourself against what you did hate them for makes you bleed makes you proud warns you when and why to feel sad drags you deep down in your own mud makes you bite the dust just before this rude awakening could be the stepping stone of the rest of your life but this rude awakening will be your gravestone it's the price of your lies  what do you hide behind your locked eyelids you walk away that's not yours cause you're ruled by your own old fears live a life that's not yours but its own the slave of your self-apathy you won't find cause you're ruled by your own old fears living suffering gloving cursing dying frightening life try to hide cut its throat but you can't because it's yours reveals you as cold as you seem reveals you as lost as you are.
