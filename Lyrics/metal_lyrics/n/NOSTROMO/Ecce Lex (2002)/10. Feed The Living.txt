The sky was not burnt people were not grey shadows children did laugh people could live people could die whenever they wish whenever they had to however they wish as dusk had just been born time did flow like water not blood blood meant life not death but this was before the war war the dead feed the living deadly air burns our lungs I think I'm thinking but I 'm not think I think I'm born to die but I'm already dead I'm dead I'm slaughtered I'm murdered.
