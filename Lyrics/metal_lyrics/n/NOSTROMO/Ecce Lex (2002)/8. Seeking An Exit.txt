Could I sink deeper in the swamp stench into which I did dive your helped to my loss just let me help myself no more time to lose whith your stupid advices no more blood to spill seeking an exit walking down a stairway which leads behind me I'm seeking an exit again and again Seeking an exit can't get out of my despair burning my skin until my flesh is black I'm still poisoning myself seeking an exit needing the exit the despair within hope is a false friend trusting is lying in reality there's no light ther's no light bearer.
