The birth of the earth, the birth of our ancient race, they have seen it all.
The flashing giants above us all, a view to the past, to the years forgotten.

I float between the stars and time.
Lost in the dust so thick, on the edge of darkness.

I climb to the hill, near the clouds, place of the stones of pagan rites.
Set the fire so great, that even the heathen gods could see the flames.

Im alone with the runestones and two ravens.
Screaming for the stars to unfold for me.
The hidden truth, the hidden secrets.
You hold the answers of time and an eternity.

I step into the flames, The gods are waiting for.

Touching the clouds, floating with stars, the magic stones will light my path.
I have fullfilled my mission, Wotan!
Take my spirit along with these flames!

Carry me into the stars, deep into the cosmos.

Im ready to leave, ready to rise with the flames.
By the moon, by the sun, to the freezing darkness.
Towards the stars so distant, light so bright.

Im ready to leave, ready to rise with the flames.
By the moon, by the sun, in the emptyness I drown. Reaching to the stars, stars so distant.
