Crows sing in cruel dark clouds Murder descending Cross red skies Parched wind
Howling in the ears of dust caked dead
Dreams rotting in a pit All spilt blood coughing Over / Death's caress
Clown God is Dead! Ascension through martyrdom
Beast is loose. Black Seed Sown. Bloom through blood rich soil
White flash of sonic doom. Tidal wave of blackened flesh
Cries of loss turn to dust CHAOS falsehood killed by truth 
Utopian dreams Drown in piss With no other use
The Highways of abuse Burning pages of a book Nowhere left to look
Images of angels Impaled unpon red meat hooks 
Aeons Come Aeons Die Chaos Lives forever...
Hope finds no consolation here for a word like never Seraphim set your worlds ablaze
Mince the holy cows Metal rusts in the whirlwinds of War / Fall to Dust
Black mist wake Shines trail of destruction Landscapes of entropy
Gates open for the Maggot King Kings return Death throne
