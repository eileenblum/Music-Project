Night times violent shadows consume you Predatory passions ignite
Sublime the sanguine that edges down your spine Your fading pulse beats merging 
with mine Your subsiding breath fading pulse A kiss filled with need A need filled with
hunger Veins hymen broke over clotting black lace Shredded nylons pulled over your
pretty face The grass dies beneath you red flowers wilt cut moist glistening Nails
Lays to waste, like tainted teeth smiles Soiling Sex Sex Sex
Like leaks out Saw mascara smudge Missed a heart beat Your lords empty call
Osiris pact presents Immortal ends, What Joy! of infernal love Eternal laugh 
When trends rot in fields of Mars 
Sun shines Maggot blood Tree roots Under suns set
Under the ground Under the Sign of lifes living end, ever
Lifes living end for good and for Dog Under the earth awaiting Lillith's call
  Bind Love Blind Hate Living in eternal wake
