Wandering Aboard at night
Purpose rapine and ravishment
Sate thine bloodlust revenant of death.

And sweep across the vast land.
Steppes and moorland
sierra and wold
upland, fell and plains

Victims to a morbid wolfish hunger
all consuming to a pinnacles of the spirit

The symbol of night &amp; winter
Of stress and storm
the harbinger of death

I am the tempest
