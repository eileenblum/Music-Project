To stand armed and dangerous before the bloody fields of history

Ready to carve, defy the transient
Stabbing forth with penetrative will,
Strain every leash, howling down the mountainside (of Man)

To immolate world upon world
With this stunning blaze

Let them all sing that we are here, as Masters
Among failing mankind

Our being took form in defiance
To stand before your killing gaze
And now to travel from flame to flame
And tower from will to glory!

Tower from will to glory!

AGIOS O BAPHOMET! AGIOS O LUCIFER!

I am the blaze

I am the blaze.
