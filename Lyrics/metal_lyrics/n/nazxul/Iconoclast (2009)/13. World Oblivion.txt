[Prelude:]
(And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth
And to him was given the key of the bottomless pit
And he opened the bottomless pit, and there arose a smoke out of the pit
As the smoke of a great furnace
And the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit)

The pale landscape, ice and debris
Incubation jilted, perfect surround
Foul thrust, insipid sperm
Enter madness blossoming spitting new death

Vestibule of ribbed charcoal
Essence of misery held
Opening veins running a river
To turn to dust, dust to turn this earth

Three points of the trident
Through shroud dividing
The other side, penetrated
Three wills, three heads, three minds

Bleak sky veil
Breaks all hope
Devoid of light
Shadows endless
Stream through their eyes, left blind

And to them it was given, that they should be tormented

And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth
And unto them was given power
As the scorpions of the earth have power

To the end of this world
To the end of all worlds

I am oblivion.
