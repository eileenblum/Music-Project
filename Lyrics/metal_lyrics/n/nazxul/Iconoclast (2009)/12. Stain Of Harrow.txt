Come with the reek, putrefy my being
Flesh will burn and cinders will float
Souls inhuman their heinousness engraved
Orchestrating the trenchant massacre

Noonday's rancorous sun frigid of warmth
Names the hours merciless birth
All of creation bathes in a light unholy grey

Seeping awareness of an overthrown rule
Callous of end shards of dusk reborn
Welcome the coming of night
Darkness of the ages...

And then i know the mist is drawn
A lucid veil from coast to coast
In the dank, like a spectre
Thy tablet glimmers to the dawn

Infected empires of man
How you decay with brilliant perfection
To you i am your enemy...

I am your pestilence
