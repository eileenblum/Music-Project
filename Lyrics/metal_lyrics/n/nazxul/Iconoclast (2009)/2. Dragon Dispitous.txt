More cunning than any beast God hath made
The serpent deceiver, freedom of will
Take the veil from thine eyes
To see the light and falseness

Black eyes burn with fury
Overpowering senses bewildered
Serpents and crosses, splintering entwined
Merging organ melee, from life to death, death to dust

Ascend the scaffold of piety
To shatter the alabaster spheres
Destroy transient temples, host hives
The dragon dispitous

Birthed and bred with Belial
Wode werewolf, worme and scorpion venomous
Lucifer's laid foul fiends face infernal
Sodomy celestial brought unto them
Redemption forebode

I am the Morning Star

Joining to form an army
No host ethereal, can withstand

I am the Morning Star
