The bringer of life's adversary, messenger of death
Hathn no peace, shadowed master
bless thy cause,appear and rape without mercy
poison them with all your misgivings.

Iscariot, usurper, destroy divine
one thousand stars burn at the arrival
the circle is complete, shining with fervour and ultimate darkness

The oceans shall boil, a burning flood
to consume and smite the children
on black wings ride, weakness of life crucified.

White gown of the angels severed wings
horn-ed heads crowned like many kings
three sides of death brings the equatio of truth

I am the deluge.
