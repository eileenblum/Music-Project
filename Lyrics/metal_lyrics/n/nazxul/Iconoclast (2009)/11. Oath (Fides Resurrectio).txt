From the rising of the sun to the ends of the earth
Hail the true body born of the virgin
You who truly suffered and were sacrificed
On the cross for the sake of man

From whose pierced flank flowered water and blood
Be a fortaste for us in the trail of death
Sounds fallen only unto those who see

Lamentations embraced with serpent coils
And no light on the path, born to be destroyed

To the glorious Celestial host
We bring betrayal, we bring corruption

My body will undo what has been done
Unto Salvation's end,

I am salvation
