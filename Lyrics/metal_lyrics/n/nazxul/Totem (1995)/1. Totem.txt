The seal of wonder
The mark in blood
The one true symbol
Of everlasting fear

They will find it, they will fear it
The mighty mark
In bloody merciless madness

Totem
Thy mark, my mark
The winds will speak, when the storms die

Unbound to thy clan
Visions of solitude and hate
Gripping thine own mark
Like a child in dementia

Flame winds will carry thee
To the heart of mercy
To the geist that guides
The walk to madness

Totem
Inflicted as honour, the power of hate
To die for, when the war breaks
