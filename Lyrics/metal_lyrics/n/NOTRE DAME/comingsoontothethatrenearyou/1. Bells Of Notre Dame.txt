From afar by the breezes carried through the dense and
impenetratable fog rings a church bell so dull and eerie,
towards the sound draws nightly stroll at this hour
is someone getting married?
As I come nearer chamber music I hear
behind the shrine there's a hidden stair case,
the moment I enter the music stops,
in the chamber stands an old church organ
with wax candles and pipes that reaches all the way up
In the web buried dust of the ages,
which is weird after what I've just heard
Hello, don't be afraid, I don't need to hide in the shadows no more
These are my ladies, aren't they beatiful,
each one speaks with a lovely voice
I call them the belles of Notre Dame
Bells of Notre Dame
Bells of Notre Dame

"Ring, Ring, I said Ring for me
Let them ring for the shallow beauty, but for whom?
If only walls could speak, every stone has a different story
Grey in shade to your poem epique, listen
The Bells of Notre Dame
The Bells of Notre Dame"
