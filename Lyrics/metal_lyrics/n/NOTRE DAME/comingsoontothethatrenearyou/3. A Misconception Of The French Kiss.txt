Excouse moi madame, "L'Arc de triomphe?"
La tour eiffel ou Notre Dame - un tourist demande
A devil in disguise - fangs madame voila
Krumlour of Paris it's beau and romantique who are you?
She then ask - first pious then grotesque
If this is all there is then it must be some mistake
Is this what I think it is a mistake
Is this what i think it is, a mistake of the world famous kiss
With etiquette and finesse - I ask for some adresse, then - en touriste?
Oui oui - I show no mercy
