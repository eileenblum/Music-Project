A funeral procession encircles the globe, reflecting the tragic signs
how black is the planet in 2001, we burn the electric sun
Monsieur Nostradamus, a king or a clown, but still he wrote history
Our age has been written, foreseen and foretold
god knows we've been awaiting... the Old
Is this a new dawn then? - No it is the beginning of the end
see birds fall from the skies
I've seen it in New York, Paris and in Rome
it all seems so crystal clear now - Doom
