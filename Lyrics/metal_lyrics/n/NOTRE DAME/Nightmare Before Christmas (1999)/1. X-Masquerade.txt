"They broke an old tradition, because the new
millennium rearranged a celebration they all
enjoyed, yet there's a costume contest
Who'd draw the ace this christmasquerade
remained mysterious best disguise would be
announced when the clock strikes twelve and
then dis-masque at midnight. Roll out the
blood-red carpet, champagne and cheers and
fireworks, very soon we reach the climax,
count-down begins drum-roll! And the winner is...
that man disguised as the Devil himself

The red horn-clad demon complete with tail
and cloven hoof devil-man you're so authentic,
all shouted; reveal yourself! They had their life's
surprise there... or should I say their death's
Half-drowned, had drained a vineyard, One still
pronounced unwillingness as they tried to strip
the winner all hell broke loose! He'd crush the
crystal ballroom... chandeliers fell into a flaming
inferno the old mansion burnt to the ground on the
very first day of the year 2000, preview to a new
hellenium, all the ninety party-goers is but a
charred memorium, all ninety... all except One"
