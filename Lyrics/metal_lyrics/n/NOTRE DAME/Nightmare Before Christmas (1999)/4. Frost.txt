Enchanted I'd seek thee I froze in front of these carefully carved
sculptures. As if by a magic stroke with a bite so cold it burns on
nightfall I saw - Frost

Afraid the blood would freeze my veins I began roaming towards the
gates when a magical blizzard will drop the swirl that surrounds
me and then as I looked up - Frost
