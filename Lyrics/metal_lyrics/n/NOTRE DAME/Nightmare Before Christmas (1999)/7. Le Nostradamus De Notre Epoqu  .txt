Like Nostradamus I foresee - a world of pain and misery
I'm Notre Damus from Paris - sightseer, hear it's elegy
save me, save me
According to what he saw those centuries ago
the entire world will blow up... eventually
it's not that he's been right before, but a fool can see the signs
saw war, a black planet in 1999
Today! I thought it over, why should I waste
my mind/time - it's over
I see neo-holocaust, world war III rage across/crush Europeople
he predicted the French revolution and I see the second coming
I've seen the dark megalomaniac, his name is xxx
boy, there's black clouds on our horizon. We can build ourselves
rockets but we can't escape our destiny, our destiny
Today! I saw it over, why should I waste
my time - it's over
Today! I thought it over, why should I waste
my my mind - it's over
