Behold the king of terror as he rises like a sun, a fitting tribute
to the new and dark and millennium, resurrected the Anti-Christ
because he knows the time is short...
The dark prophetic poÃ©ms has been accurate before,
Napoleon and Hitler, now the current third world war
All figures, names and numbers - everything turns upside down...
1999 - the true believers claim it is the year we all shall die
1999 - an united group of sceptics says they're all way out of line
somewhere in a hospital a newborn was swapped
A small miscalculation where the month was missed with one,
the seventh son of seven overshadowed the August sun
The countdown has begun, it's the beginning of the end...
1999 - the mass of misled mongers couldn't read between the lines
1999 - when Charon takes his ferry across the seven seas of rhye
1999 - why!
1999 - a wake up call, we got to kill the monster while it's small
1999 - if we cannot heed the warning, then at least we can recall
1999 - the words of Nostradamus will accordingly...
fall into oblivium while he is uprising with strength wins the peoples immovable trust
then takes us by the hand on a walk to the ends of the earth
