Surprise!
Help me blow out the candles? - isn't that what you meant
who brings the nicest presents gets my dead presidents
don't wish me happy birthday - don't wish me happy birthday
yes, I know what you're up to - you scavengers! Hip Hip Hooray!

Put in a special paragraph in my testament
everything goes to charity, in case of an accident
don't wish me happy birthday - I am not happy!
Watch it, is that a bowie knife to cut the cake
Hip Hip Hooray

"for he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow
that nobody can deny" die, die, die!
