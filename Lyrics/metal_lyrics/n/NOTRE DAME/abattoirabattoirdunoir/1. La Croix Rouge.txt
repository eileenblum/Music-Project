On blood they built their empire
By offering help and providing themselves
A clan of modern day vampires
Despite their wealth a considerable loss
And they named their hoax red cross
We all need blood to stay alive
And so do they in a civilized way

Light sensitive activities, one may wonder why
Why it wasn't brought to light
Who question the authorities
Well some they did and then later on died
With the cross turned upside down

A chain that's international
A blood red cross and a slogan that does
Appeal to your bad conscience and
make you feel great every time you donate
No member bites the feeding hand
There's lawyers and cops politicians and such
And the truth is you've been fooled!

Give blood - save lives
