Yesterday we children played
Hyde'n'zeke like every week
One day bloody Sunday
Sought all around, she wasn't found
Looked inside that storage room
If they don't find me soon
Butchers knife where's the butcher
I was terrified di da da

Searching, seeking
Weeping, screaming
Seeking but not finding...

Abattoir, Abattoir
Abattoir Du Noir

Yesterday is far away
On a floor of blood and gore
Free from sound lay our playing ground
My friends went home - left all alone
Anyway it took 'em days finding that gruesome place
From that on I have become a vegetarian na na na...
She will never forget what she saw

Searching, seeking
Praying, crying
Regretting I was hiding in...

Abattoir, Abattoir
Abattoir Du Noir
