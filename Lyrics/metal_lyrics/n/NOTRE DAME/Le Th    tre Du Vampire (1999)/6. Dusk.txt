After sundown, I am gone - I am going home, home
So refreshing, at pre-dawn being reborn, born
Something I desire, it's something I must have
Few things I require but this I do demand, this I do demand...

Bathe myself in darkness, like balsam for the soul
Shadows growing taller at...
Lay myself in darkness and slowly fade away
Don't wake until after the... Dusk

Peaceful moments deep into the twilight zone
Enter darkness sweet &amp; cold refill my soul

Bathe myself in darkness, like balsam for the soul
Shadows growing taller at... nightfall
Lay myself in darkness and slowly fade away
Don't wake until after the... Dusk
