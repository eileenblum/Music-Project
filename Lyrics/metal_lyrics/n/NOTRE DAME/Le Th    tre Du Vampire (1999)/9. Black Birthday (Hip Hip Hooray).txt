Surprise!
Help me blow out the candles? - isn't that what you meant
Who brings the nicest presents gets my dead presidents
Don't wish me happy birthday - don't wish me happy birthday
Yes, I know what you are up to - you scavengers
Hip Hip Hooray!

Put in a special paragraph in my testament
Everything goes to charity in case of an accident
Don't wish me happy birthday - I am not happy!
Watch it, is that a bowie knife to cut the cake
Hip Hip Hooray

"for he s a jolly good fellow, for he s a jolly good fellow
That nobody can't deny" - die, die, die!

Hip Hip Hooray
