[bonus track]

- the problem child, the outcast and the plague
They say it is I who ruin their perfect world,
I am the virus and the Anti-Christ
Virus - polluting the atmosphere, it's carried through the air,
Male version of Linda Blair, he's got to get out - I must get out of here

And I - I'm a Satanist, the blackest of sheep that is I
Virus - polluting the atmosphere, it s carried through the air
Male version of Linda Blair, he's got to get out - I must get out of here

Last Sunday when I turned eighteen we had a nice little barbeque
For the well combed community with their picked fences at
Their service. I watched their picturesque little church go up in flames
BURN!
