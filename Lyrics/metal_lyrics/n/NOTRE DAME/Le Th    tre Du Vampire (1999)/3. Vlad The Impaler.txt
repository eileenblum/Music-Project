Once upon a time in a place not far
From here lived a prince in a
Castle with his lovely fiancÃ©e

One day she got bit by a bat and grew
Paler and paler. She died later that
Spring in the arms of...

- Vlad The Impaler outcast from the
Arch. Only fools dare to whisper his
Name after dark:

"Vlad is the Devil", that's what they
Say; but he's so very generous on
Fangs-givings day!

Vlad The Impaler sings a lullaby
For naughty, naughty children;
The time has come to... die!

Vlad has a hole where his heart
Ought to be, he knows the "life at
Stake" process by heart, see

Vlad The Impaler crawls out his den
Like itsy bitsy spider he crawls back
Again

If Vlad would have a penny for every
Time he's bad, then Vlad would have
Plenty... but no-no

Vlad has a bad breath caused by
Tooth-decay when stalking his victims
Bad breath gives him away
But he was more known as... Dracula!!!
