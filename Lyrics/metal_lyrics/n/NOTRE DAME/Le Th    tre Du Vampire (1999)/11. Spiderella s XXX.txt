Once you're trapped inside her net there's no way back
She's a supersexy widow and she's black
She's a man-eater in bed, and won't leave until she's fed
Now I am trapped inside her world wide web

She's a nightmare but she's every young mans dream
As you know no things are really what they seem
Then a thought went through my head, she's always newly wed
And they're all inside her world wide web

Venomous, her kiss has poisoned us
Torturous, she love to do to us
Hazardous, world wide notorious
Bouncing back and fourth on every thread inside this world wide web
Hang on tight, grotesque's her appetite

Venomous, her kiss has poisoned us
Torturous, what she loves to do to us
Marvelouz, she is dead-serious
Bouncing back and forth until you're dead inside this world wide web

Spiderella keeps a harem for her lust,
As an inborn mating instinct it's a must
Spiderella must be fed, she won't leave you 'til you're dead
When you're trapped inside her world wide web

World wide web
World wide web
Web...
