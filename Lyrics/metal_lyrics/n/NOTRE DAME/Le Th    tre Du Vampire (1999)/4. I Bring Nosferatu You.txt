Well if you're dying to be dying
- I'll bring Nosferatu you

And you're sick of all the suckers
Then - I'll bring Nosferatu you
The price of your entry is sin
I know you're lying when you're
Saying yes - I bring Nosferatu you
And now you wonder about that
Hunger - well I brought Nosferatu you

You're terrifying so stop whining
- I brought Nosferatu you
The price of your entry is sin
So, if you're dying to be dying
- I'll bring Nosferatu to you too!!
