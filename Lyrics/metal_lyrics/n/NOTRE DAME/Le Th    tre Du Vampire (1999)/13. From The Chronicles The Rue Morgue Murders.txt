[bonus track]

When the day has gone to sleep
Two and two they walk the streets
Shadows lurk as widows weep
Claiming there's a wolf among the sheep
Walk the street of rue morgue
It leads you straight to the morgue
Murder, murder, murder, murder, murderer in the rue morgue

Last night's loss goes in repeat
Empty streets and blood stained sheets
The girls are either scared or scarred
A nail in the coffin for the whore-house of cards

Walk the street of rue morgue
It leads you straight to the morgue...
Murder, murder, murder, murder, murderer in the rue morgue
