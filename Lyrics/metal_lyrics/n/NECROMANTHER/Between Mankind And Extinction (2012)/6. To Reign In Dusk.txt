What I've seen shall never be erased
Am I really dead?
I don't know why I still think
But these images are haunting me

I am the narrator of my hallucinations
I live in Hell
In this kingdom of darkness
Beneath the shadows of a demon

Between walls of flesh
And rivers of blood
I do my journey

In this decaying space
I'm on my way
Through these floating bodies

This reign of dusk
Built with human pieces
Was after all a familiar place
But I can't remember which

Where am I now?
I see a crucifix
Made of human limbs
Hanging inverted

What a demented place
Will I live here forever?
From my dreams it came out weal
But now i'm in misery

The intensive heat
Makes me loose my will to continue
And I faint
Madness continues to follow me

Between walls of flesh
And rivers of blood
I do my journey

In this decaying space
I followed my path
And finally... I got out
