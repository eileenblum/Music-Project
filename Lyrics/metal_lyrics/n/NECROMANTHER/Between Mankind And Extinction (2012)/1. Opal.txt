The tree of life
Dropping its fruits
Surrenders to Death
And restarts its cycle

(Aren't you?)
Afraid of loosing
Something so close
That always stays on your mind
(Aren't you?)
Afraid of loosing
Someone too close
That always shines on your heart

Born to feel - pain inside
Born to feel - nothing at all
Die to live - in the past
Live to die - in a grave

Welcome to
Your fear

Fear of your own life
Fear of your own death

Everything dies
And forever shines

Welcome to your fear
Fear of your own life and death
Everything dies
And forever shines
