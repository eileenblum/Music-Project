She was wearing this dress
With a scarlet tone
As she was approaching
The dress was loosing its colour

What am I seeing
Why doesn't my mind turn off
Of images without sense or Death
If I already died a few hours ago?

I still feel pain
I still see things
I can't believe
I'm not dreaming

If this is a dream
Why can't I wake up?

I know it's not
She's coming, I can smell

A charming perfume
But something's wrong with her

She falls on the floor
And the scarlet becomes toneless

The world is dying
Everything turns dingy
She was the metaphor
Of the end...

Everything disappears
But I am still here
Sorrow doesn't go away
I am now in emptiness
Forever...

I still feel pain
I still see things
I can't believe
I'm not dreaming

If this is a dream
Why can't I wake up?

I know it's not
She's dead, I can tell

By the carrion of her body
That spreads without stopping

She fades away
And the dress... I kept it with me
