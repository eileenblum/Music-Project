I take this way
Hoping to find the exit
To this infinite war
Where I strangely am

Why do we live in a chaos
Where relligion controls us
If there's no God
Nor life after death?

Between us there's Nature
Which is superior to every human being
We can't continue to destroy
For something that doesn't make sense

I want to get out of here
And build a new world
I want to start it again
And find my destiny

I want to find the passage
That for me it will be sacred
I want to see nature
Without being overthrown

Is it possible to witness this
Without hallucinating,
Completely lost?
