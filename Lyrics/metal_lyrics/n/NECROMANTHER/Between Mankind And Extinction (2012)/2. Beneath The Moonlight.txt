Through darkness
And
Colossal mountains
I
Carry on
Against the storm

The arduous path to the castle
Becomes harsher more and more

I feel weak and cold
But I have to go on
It seems like I'm seeing ghosts
Must be the end of my days

And the arduous path becomes harsher
More and more...

I open the gate
And the macabre image rises
I came here
To see corpses beneath the moonlight

Frozen flesh
In a dark winter day
Who could have done this
What misterious strenght...

I must get out of here
I am haunted
I never felt like this before
I'm freezing to death

Through darkness
And colossal mountains
I turn back
To the storm
I feel weak and cold
But I have to go on
