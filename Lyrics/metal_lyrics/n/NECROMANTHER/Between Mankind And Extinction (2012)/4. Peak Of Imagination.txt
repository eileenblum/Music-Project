I've been told of a relentless being
Like a demon from nature
I decided to find him

Can someone explain me
Why there's an awkward heat
Coming from beneath a snowy ground
Between the mountains at winter?

So I continue
A strange power seems to call me
I fall on the descendent floor
And what do I see in front of me?

A throne of bones
In which lies a demon
Coming from my imagination
I have to stop this...

The hallucinations torment me
I am feeding the creature
That wants me dead

Dead!

I have to run away from my mind
It's terrorizing me

I want to forget this
I gotta get out...
