In a downward spiral
Of complete madness
I reach the most
Negative point

Imagine your body dissolving
In a giant pool of putrefaction
Will I go further than this
I believe it will be impossible

This is most likely
A portrait of obscurity
The drawings of my delusions
And of my corruption

Eternally I am
A lost spirit
That escapes from this
Once called body
The final days of my life
The asphyxiant dream

Going down again
Entirely uncontrolled
Pictures of brutality
Stuck in my mind

Down!

I am drenched in blood
My entrails are flushed
With vomit through holes
Once covered with flesh

In a downward spiral
Of complete madness
I reached the most
Negative point

Where the body lay
Only remains its traces
Gone with the wind like sand
Upon the hillside

This terror seems like it never ends
I only want to be remembered
As I fall on the ground like rain
For the world to feel me again

Eternally I am
A lost spirit
That escaped from this
Once called body
The final days of my life
The asphyxiant dream
