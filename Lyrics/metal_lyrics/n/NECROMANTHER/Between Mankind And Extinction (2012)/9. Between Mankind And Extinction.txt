Stay away from my dreams
'Cause you are the cause of my madness
But I am no longer insane
And you don't belong to me

When darkness has fallen
They bled out to death
Tormented by the wounds from his sins

A book forgotten in time
Waiting to be reopened
Once again

I need to find
Some peace in my mind
After all this lunacy
I left behind

I'm not afraid to kill you
The demon I carry with me

Wasn't so hard to eliminate
The memories from the past
For all the war that was fought
I now take revenge
You did left fragments of madness
In my mind
But I know that I am
Stronger than you

This is the end
As I watch you drown in flames

Now that i'm rid of you
I can go on
The delusions are gone
And you will not return
