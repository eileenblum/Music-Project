Those solar explosions
My refuge against your cries
The twisted immersion
Under a layer of fire.

Come up to the trapeze with me
Brush my perspective
My arms stretched out
Like branches into the pathetic truth.

Sometimes I feel my teeth
Falling down my smile,
Sometimes I feel Iâm losing my steps
Through this empty desert.

When I achieve to pull out
The fishhooks from my eyes
Bring me back my cycle
And donât show the tattooed wound.

Stay...walk on my fingers
Let out the sun under your tongue
The perfect spiral
Straight up ways again

I donât vow remembering....
