Emptiness was such a lonely place
So it led me to begin a long and hard course,
To search what my heart was crying for.
I wasnât conscious, but you were there
Awaiting me for long.

I wasnât conscious, but I walked all the wrong ways,
In time I just turned the correct corner
And you were there, not gone.

Only your eyes were enough
To hook me to the hardest
And most beautiful drug,
Sometimes in the flight
We joined together , I feel fragileâ¦..

Only your eyes are enough
To make my wings dust stronger,
Only your eyes are enough
To make my wings dust stronger,
Only your eyes were enough
To hook me to the hardest
And most beautiful drug,
Sometimes in the flight
We joined together , I feel fragileâ¦..

Like a butterfly in a storm.
