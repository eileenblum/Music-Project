I wake up on broken glass
My golden teeth shining
Reptile through my fingers
It is time to disguise the murderer.

Siamese! Your secret face
I am far away (from you)

Fever licking my feverish smile
A 360 degrees eye embraces me now,
Best lover of myself, me
The lover of the lowest being itâs me.

Siamese! Your secret face
I am far away (from you)

Lost in my condition (freak)
Words that never hold
Turning to anger, your sympathy
The mirror of the Siamese painted muse.

Siamese! Your secret face
I am far away (from you)
