I canât recognize, I canât remember
Who I was before the start
I know itâs not a mystic trance
Only a floating window, on a new black layer.

I begin to forget the colour of my cries.

My veins stayed on the way
Tied to my old stars, dragging
Were you the pain creator?
I should erase the traces forever
Should I kill my architect?
But Iâm only sure thatâ¦.

Youâll never find this place
I hide my limits in the no-room
Youâll never walk this way
My legs were serpents going nowhere.


But Iâm only sure thatâ¦.

Youâll never find this place
I hide my limits in the no-room
Youâll never walk this way
My legs were serpents going nowhere
