Donât worry about the miles
You never drove
Cause theyâre there, outside,
Waiting for your tyres.

Donât worry about the things
You never said
It doesnât matterâ¦
They will listen.

Today sunshine ainât the same
Its rays are described
With an optimistic pen.

Hope grows inside a wound,
An accelerated culture rides
Inside my veins,
And the youth I left years ago
Is resurrected in my mirror.

Don't worry about the words
You never wrote
Cause theyâve never been forgotten
And your mind never removed them

Donât worry about the things
You never did
Theyâll be done
And everything is gonna be okay.
