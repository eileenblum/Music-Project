Only you
alcoholic and herbaceous bitch
wake up the sleeping beast of my
caverns and Polyphemus blinded
eye can see again

Happiness hugs me thinking of you
ecstasy catches me when you're inside
of me and my face smiles again

Only you
liquid partner flow in my veins
killing the child that sometimes
drives me mad and digresses
in my brain

Yes, you know I'm on a high
but you're provoking orgasms
to my cells and ejaculations
of joy to all the parts of my soul

Come in! green by my eyes
with your bitter smell
play with my tongue
burn under my palate
vulcanize my blood and
mix it with my thoughts

elevating me to the top
to the summit of my craggy
and mountainous existence
