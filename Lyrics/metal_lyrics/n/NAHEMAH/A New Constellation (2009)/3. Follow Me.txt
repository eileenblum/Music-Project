Follow me, don't care if you come from the land
where fire doesn't burn and sun doesn't blind
Follow me, don't care if you come from de land
where hearts lay extinct and bodies are deprived
of their wings

Follow me, mix and liquate your being here...
Melting down your flesh with the melted stone
melting your wings flapping
with the air you're breathing

Follow me, I will make you burnt and blind
I'll bring to the land where you'll find
heartbeats as eruptions
Follow me, to an igneous place where air and body
are one and the blood flows slow, dense
and incandescent like volcanic lava

Follow me, mix and liquate your being here...
Melting down your flesh with the melted stone
melting your wings flapping
with the air you're breathing
