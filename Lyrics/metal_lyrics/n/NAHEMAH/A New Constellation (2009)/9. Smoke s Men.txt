Trapped by smoke's men whirlpool...
which squeeze me out from the inside
they explode my head temples
and surround my stomach with that
burning blue fire

Trapped by smoke's men whirlpool...
which cover my fluids with convulsing
spasms and tint my fears with the
blood that, bubbling, flows outside
of me

Trapped by smoke's men whirlpool...
which tie my entrails and pull out
my soul by the mental retchings of
the feelings

Trapped by smoke's men whirlpool...
which dissect my eye's cover
breaking the acid blink of my
sobs and aphonic weepings
