There's a building in my mind
full of people wanting to cry
and a dark room in my heart
that nobody, wants to see inside

never was the same way
thoughts going far from here
to erase the past
and see who i am
to reach the stars
dead words will say

close to resolving the equation
solutions will be, painted in the picture
and a mixture of fragility, and rage
will be signs, links of the chain
chorus repeat

can you hear me? I'm inside!!
in this circle where nobody wants to try (inside)
it's a castle, of broken glasses
in this temple, nothing changes
there's only one thought in my mind
i'm hungry and I can't taste
all these flavors, they make me sick
and split!!
in the table there's a light
but I can't see, I'm too blind
to complete the search
