Behold the palace
And it's scared princess
Ravens flooding the skies
An endless funeral
Of dimensions and times
Unleahses her cosmic distress
Night is falling
In unmeasurable majesty
Stars, shining in malice
Sibylla, raising thy mighty chalice
Tearing the curtains
Through blasphemy
Clouds shiver with fear
Awaiting the sanguine blaze
And infernal entities
Feather their wings to ascend
With such rage beneath their souls
As our spirits can comprehend
The seals are open
Thy reuqest has been sent
A voiceless crowd
The silent servants of Satan
The universe, undressed for thee
Unveiled its unborn secrets
Thou hast drown in a trance
Caress the sands of the depths
Sorceress supreme
Intoxicate our dreams
Bringer of pure evil
That emanates from prophecies

Our blindness will be thy eternal force
