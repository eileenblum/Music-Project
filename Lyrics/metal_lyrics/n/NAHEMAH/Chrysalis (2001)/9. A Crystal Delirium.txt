Across the waters
Blind sirens fly
Waving their crystal scales
Oh delirium!
My mind's so frail
My body dressed
In sharp cold nails
A soporific whirlpool
Of fever and dread
Sailing and raping
The wattery red
The sun becomes
A diffuse nest of vipers
Perception fades away
Lungs are filled
With a fetid rain
Penetrate the dream of the oceans
Where the night is a broken day
And a million submerged temples
Show their treasures when the sea
Is mirrored on the surface
Of the moonfields
Behind the crystal curtains
There's a world
Distorted and lost
A frozen dimension
A fancyful delirium
