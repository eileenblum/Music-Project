Light springs in her shadowy eyes
Like greenshine moons
Exploding the skies
Wide-opened portals of pure essence
Towards the ochre mantle
Shrouding her stare
Desecrated canvas
Of morbid inspiration
A fire chrysalis
Squirms within the nucleus
A mind's extent meandening
Blindly nibbling
The mutilated reality
Across the intangible temples
Among scattered constellations
Of ideas and yearnings
The flaming hand emerges
And carves the communion
Between flesh and soul
Ecstasy released your image
Buried beneath the ruins
Of my golden empyrium
Casting your ravenous light
Between the emaciated pillars,
Enchanting my concience
Slowly the blood traces a memory
Spilled senses in turbulent cadence
A momentary god drunk with vertigo
Eternity disgiused in art's spheres
Hysteria drags me down
Painting in death your image
