Green eyes hypnotizing
The astral rites
Fired by a grey-cratered sun
The blackness of her dress,
Luficerian mistress,
Hiding the jewelled knife
Snaking,
Within the crowd she advances
Trailing for the scented prey
Fevered and stained
With a devilish hate
Crawls to swallow the light
Deafening laughs all around
Carnival Masqued
In horrible sounds
Colorful hysteria
A queen whithout crown
Who rides the sin
Beyond bounds
Drenched in wine
She drinks the las dance
The smelling of crime
A poisoner trance
Eyes raping the skies
When she tears the bolts
Of a bloodstained carnival
Drenched in wine
She drinks the last dance
The smelling of crime...
Eyes raping the skies
When she tears the bolts
Of a bloodstained...
Of a bloodstained carnival
