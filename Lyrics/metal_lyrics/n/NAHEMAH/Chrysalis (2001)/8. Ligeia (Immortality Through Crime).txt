She spread the wings of her languidness
Through the nightshadows of charming
The moon wept each birth of dawn
Her soft marbled skin
And red velvet lips
A dark nimph that angels sohuld crown
In the depth of her eyes
Archaic secrets conspire
A misterious purpose
Shrouded in longing desires
Possessed by dread
She danced entranced with Death
On your mourning beauty I bleed
Falling into the clutches of an insane dream
Ligeia!
Wherever thy image may be
No magic shall sever
Thy music from thee
Silent she lies
And my kiss goes through the black shroud
Truth lurks beyond her vieled eyes
Come to me
And embrace my sorrow
Till the anguish of awakening
Thirsty for oblivion
I crept towards the bleak shores
Of a second maid
But winds yell her name
Spreading the seed of my shame
That bites my feeble heart
Beneath nocturnal rain
Death reverts to breath
In return for my sins
Flagelating the hopes
With a cruel tragedy
Madness
Entangles her soul
Stoned by disease
In return for my sins
Shining venomous tears into wine
Siletn she lies
And my stare goes through the black shroud
Truth lurks beyond her veiled eyes
Come to me
And embrace my sorrow
Till the anguish of awakening
Her veins start to shine
With livid crimson light
Eyelids tremble
Immortality through crime
Ligeia awakes
From shadows arises
Frost burns to uncover
The truth that lurks beyond her eyes
