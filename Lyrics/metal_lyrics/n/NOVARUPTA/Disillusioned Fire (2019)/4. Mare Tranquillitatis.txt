The swarm is a chaotic source
Projections and movements
Moving pictures of violence and hate
A grind, the endless grind to consume emotions

A fire split in two, leaving the ash
A spark that turned into arson
Your house of venom needs to burn
The purge to eradicate your plague

A celestial ocean of collective future
A new universe parallel to the hive
In a slow fall I fell into this calm sea
With heavy eyes I drowned you in heavy water

Your house of venomâ¦
Needs to burn!
