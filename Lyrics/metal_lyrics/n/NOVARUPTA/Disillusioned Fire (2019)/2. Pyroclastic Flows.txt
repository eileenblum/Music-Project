The air breaths slow ash
Pyroclastic flows burn through
What once was turned to embers
In the valley of ten thousand smokes

The fire burns below the water
Floating in the black light
The smoke screen that hides
Threads that weave the flames

Survive fires burns weak
Lights of the world grows thin
Bones spins that sparks
Like glistening tar from the mouths of the gods

What was never ours we laid to waste
With cinders we begin anew
