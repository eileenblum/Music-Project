There is a dark star rising
In our name
There is a black hole hiding in its shadow
For we whom stole the light from their hands

Into chaos
For we are but dust

In time the wolves will claim the crown
In time only the wind will know our names
In time only the dirt will know our graves

This line is a blade that
Cut right through
As the fabric rips, it all pours out
This line is a blade that
Cut right through
Hear my sirens! Like thunder
Like lightning!

Your god weeps as the
Sky crash down
