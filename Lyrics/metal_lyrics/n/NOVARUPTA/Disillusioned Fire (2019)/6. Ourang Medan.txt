We fell to the ground from the silent blast
Disoriented, cold â trying to stay awake
If this isn't the first time, it must be the last
The mouth a desert, the eyes a void

Harsh rain like nails to the skin
Swiftly thinning air, seconds went like days
Chilling the marrow, freezing within
From parting waves to parting ways

Suddenly, a presence
Could it just be the wind?
Boy standing straight, observing everything
Some kind of slumber will embrace us

In this moment, frozen in time
Looking for direction, starry eyed yet blind
The sky awakes, pointing fingers at our flaws
We've been sleeping days now

No ocular damage, breathing through mud
Boy seeking shelter, moving slow, scouting slow
On the deck, sleep through the flood
We belong to someone else now

Where is the tide when we need it the most?
The muffled silence, the rumble of feet on hollow wood
Losing grip, drifting into blackened light
Boy seeking refuge in a blaze of white

We rest our heads on the freezing deck

And we re-create the features of our loved ones
As we venture further into the fog
