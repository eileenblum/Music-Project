Stone, burn, walk, inhale decay
Spine, void, break, I will fall if I stay
As I lay in bond, embrace the crown
Defeat the face, walk in gust
Let them all go but keep it close
Endless pace, clouds of rust
Let it all go but feel it grow
As I lay in bond, embrace the crown
As I lay in bond, embrace the crown
