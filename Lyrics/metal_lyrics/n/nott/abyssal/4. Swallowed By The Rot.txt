Behold: divine obliteration.
Conjure an absolute ruination.
Praying to their gods as if theyâll save them,
Deprived of all their putrid, useless skin.

Collapse at my feet as I initiate.
I see them wither away.
Ravenous faces stare aimlessly upward.
The world they once knew, erased.

Swallowed by the rot.

Banished from being,
Realize your ruin.

Force-fed hemlock
Past their shards of teeth,
For once I feel alive.
For once I breathe.

Clutching to their tongues,
Their purpose now defunct.
Eaten by the surface tar;
Swallowed by the rot.

Origin of hubris,
Witness mass extinction.
