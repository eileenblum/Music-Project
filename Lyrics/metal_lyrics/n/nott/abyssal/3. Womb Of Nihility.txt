They gaze in rapture
Of my sermon.
The ashen abyss
Of this wasteland of hate.

Where are you now?
Quarantined to nothingness.
What have you gained?
A final stillness;
Praying for anything but this.

Despair.

I bid you welcome
To this womb of nihility.
Fathom a dimension of nothing
And feast upon the plague.
