In the silence of desolation,
I breathe.

My seismic footfalls,
Their trembling limbs,
The forest shudders
As I walk beside them.

The stench of death
That seeps beneath
Constricts their roots of life
That I now seek.

Gone are the days of filth,
Yet still I cannot see.
The black liquid fills my eyes
And reflects the mire deep.

Tar pours from my mouth.
Silenced; a world wiped clean.
A promise eradicated:
Their remnants line the canopy.
Devastation.

As I stand here, towering
Amidst the smoldering flesh.
Judgment falls upon this earth:
The congregation of disintegration.
