Extracted from existence
Immersed in nothingness
Like a drain torn from the tit
I drown in thirst for substance

My veins bled dry
All marrow sucked from my bones
The weight of my cognition
Disordered, illogical

Eternal sleep eluding me
I drift through voices left unfound
My vision oscillates unmeasured
Once I obtain the ground

The undefined wall between myself and matter
Evaporated
The first light of the aeons past
I struggle to stand
Traversing the gap of realms I imbibe my
Vigor once again

My might restored
Her fate is sealed
