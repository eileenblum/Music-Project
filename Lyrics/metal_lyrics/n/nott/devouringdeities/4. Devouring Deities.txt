Trampling the weak
Splintering underfoot
Crush the trees
From whence the voices came

Rend the bodies from the earth
Kneel my subjects
Breaking backs and wills of man
Kneel my objects

From the clouds of chaos
Her hourglass is seen
She too has crossed
To the realm of dreams

Her body tangible
The black fades green
Her many mouths screaming the scream of
A mute banshee

I tear out her throat and I swallow it whole
