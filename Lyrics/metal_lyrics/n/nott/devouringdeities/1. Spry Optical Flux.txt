Murmurs from the grove tell tales while I slumber
Her tongue tracing my only ear
She sways with the breaking branches
While her shadow lie dormant in fear

The limbs split with my subliminal self
Separating us at the soul
Failing to see what sheâs done in the darkness
Although apart we are still one

Counting the waves of a shattered illusion
Reassembled, struggling for clarity
All sense torn through murky lenses
I see reality crumble before me

Writhing through inescapable space
My arms chained to the ever-falling floor
I spiral through my own existence
All that was is now never more

The world stops as we contort back to one frame
Deep fog penetrating my flesh
Her laughter echoing off nothingness
As Iâm trapped in spry optical
Flux

Dangling over the abyss I cut the strands of certainty.
