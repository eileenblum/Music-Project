Her mountains
Collapse at the sight
Of domination imploding

Her oceans
Rage infernally
As the voices permeate my

Memories
Returning as falsehoods
What in this world is real?

Her frame lies before me
With short, quivering breaths
Her struggle hypnotic
My hand gave her death

Debris becomes one with
Her fragmented soul
As the life leaves her eyes
The light leaves my own

Trapped in the orbit of time
Ahead of us lies the past
Through death she cannot leave
And our fates are never met
