Trapped in the obsidian sea,
My shell once lay dormant.
Severing the serpentâs vise,
Iâm unleashed to my element.

Wake from the endless trance.
Emerge from the black.
Churn the depths; writhe upward.
The oceans are peeling back.

Rise.
Ascension.

I hear the storm ahead.
Aperture depths,
To leave the chasmâs black.

Rise of Leviathan.
Rise; Iâm Leviathan.
