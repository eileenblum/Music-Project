Chaos; natureâs absolve.
My storm. My reckoning.

A silhouette, I saw,
As my wake blotted the sun.
Hail danced the wraithâs veil;
Dead, weâre never gone.

Her droning wail; a bloody reverie.

Never again will I sleep bound,
The punishment begins.
I cast her shadow to sink down
To dissolve under oblivion.
Sink.

The mortals cower
As they peel back their ears.
Watching me kill their god,
I am what they know as fear.

Your glass god is dead, yet still I stand.
Iâll drag you under promised land.

I will drown you.
