I shatter your lens of lies
To rid your mind of false hope.

I stand before you monolithic,
Everyone you know will die.
Into the water, Iâll send them,
And consume all for the sacrifice.

Annihilation: the purest cleansing.

The heavens shudder to watch
Me dole immeasurable pain.
Baptizing your lifeless forms;
Welcome to your new domain.

Drift forever downwards,
Convulse through the deep.
The penetrating cold
Draws you into my keep.

The ouroboros broken,
My wrath brought End.
Decay in the depths,
My swarm of Dead.
