[Lyrics by Alex]

Demon in a land of war, hungry of the eternal blood lust
Living with consecrated fury, enthroned with sharp steel edge
The skyline stands in red, burning in flames of hatred and blood
Decorated with deep desolated forests...

Land of the Heathen,
we, eternal lineage.
Land of the Heathen,
in eternal warfare.

A wall of shadows, a wall of fierce warriors
a battle cry and steel shining through red...
This is the night of all nights,
the time is now, and we are the eternal triumph...

As one flesh, destroying by my will!
All together, crying with one voice to fight
Feeling the strong wind, feeling the enemyâs death...
Embracing the glory...

Land of the Heathen,
we, eternal lineage.
Land of the Heathen,
in eternal warfare.

My veins are fed by pagan victory...
The battlefield recreates a merciless domain...
All braves in a victorious ecstasy
This is a land of war, this is the pagan land....
