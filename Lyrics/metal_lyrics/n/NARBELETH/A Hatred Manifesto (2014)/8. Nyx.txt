[originally by Urgehal]You were not Jesus neither god
You were the crucifer not the crucified
Oh you showed me the right way
When I was in despair

Ghastly night of hate and horror
Fortify me and feed my desperation
Oh Nyx mother of death
Sister of darkness
Spread your black wings
And drown Heimera

Oh Luna you're the black night's eye
Who fills us with hunger
Feel my power
Feel my craft
I'm no longer me
I'm blasphemy

Come on haunt me you endless night
So we can become one forever
