Hear my voice growling among the fire
like thousand thunders of hate and intolerance
a hell hammer of abomination
crushing your faith, divinity and grace

I was made from dirt,
from lies, and broken words
I beheld the end of this world
And I survive, your idols not, you don't

Rotten to the core
I am monstrosity, I am the godless one
Rotten to the core
hatred is my fuel, I hate you all

Hear my voice, is rotten
it sounds like night, like cold night of death
is the void of sky, of darkness
Is the Earth calling his sons, the kings, the braves
