Yeah, it is me
the one who conspires against you,
I hate you kind,
I hate, yes, with my every breath.

Oh I hate, and this hatred is strength.
the force within me, to stand away.

away from you, and your disgusting crowd
where I can breath, where I can be...

The chains of misery shall torn you apart
brainless worm infecting my world
as you destroy yourself, I enjoy the overkill,
meanwhile all I need is:

Total isolation!!!

In conspiracy with Satan
In conspiracy with evil
with the armies from the abyss
from the abyss of my soul

Isolation as the path!!!
Isolation as an ending!!!
Isolation as a weapon!!!
towards a new aeon
Of darkness, of fire, of chaos...

Total isolation!!!
