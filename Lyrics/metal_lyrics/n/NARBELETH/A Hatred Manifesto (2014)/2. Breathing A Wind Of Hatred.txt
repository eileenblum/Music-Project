Creed of Black, of sorcery,
no bless at all, and damned to the core
Still primitive and raw,
my dark cult, as heritage from the old gods

Total destruction of your holy shit!
Breathing a wind of hatred
enjoying the smell of your putrid flesh
Breathing a wind of hatred

I live, you die!
you suffer, I rise!
pestilence, shall fall
on you, and your generations to come

This is my spear, with poison in the blade
direct to the chest, IÂ´ve never failed a shot
thousands swords in one single hand
killing with fire, with fire!

Total destruction of your holy shit!
Breathing a wind of hatred
enjoying the smell of your putrid flesh
Breathing a wind of hatred

A never ending way
a warrior and his doom
All Hail! Fire and Hell!
