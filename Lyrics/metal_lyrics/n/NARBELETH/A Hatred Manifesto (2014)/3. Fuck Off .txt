Fuck Off!
I release my demons,
I begin my journey,
I unleash my fury.

Fuck Off!
I deny the world,
I forgot IÂ´m human,
I enjoy what you hate.

This is my journey
I build every step,
I create every single detail
of my destiny ahead.

In every dimension
lies my will,
as a solid rock of eternity,
an everlasting growing tree of chaos

Fuck Off!
I release my demons,
I begin my journey,
I unleash my fury.

Fuck Off!
