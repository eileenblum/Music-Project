Searching for light in a cold house,
is a desert, infinity of vacuum
coins of lies asking for a place in heaven,
in a first row that have been never there

Worms eat the words
hypocrisy and a rotten dawn
you will never know
you will never see that light

YouÂ´ll find no answer there
the truth lies inside
ignorance is paid with death
your shouts just fade in darkness

This is a hatred manifesto
these are the principles of chaos.
Triumph must be certain,
and it takes violence.
For the ages to come,
with sword in hand,
with the fire by my side,
IÂ´m in war!
