From the east they appeared
From ancient lands of hatred and desolation
hellish blizzard storms
five demons and a witch

In weird tongues they spoke 
and the being was spawned
Destronork is the word
to describe the horror

Et diabolus incarnatus est... Et homo factus est

Harsh beats, spears, thunders
master of the black temple
feed with humans heads

Lightning across the sky...
devastated land, and hearts...

Today I have nothing to say
just the smell of leather, 
the taste of the spikes on my skin...
I find shelter in silence
But still invoking the beast...

Again the sentence in my head... 
the breath of night in my face...
cold... grim... unforgettable
