A reign of dust
unholy charms
buried beyond the time
beyond the shadows of the start
About cold, darkness and hatred
about centuries of quiet misanthropy

Silet per diem universus 
nec sine horrore secretus est

what means human?
what means hate?
what means god?

Raw Hatred!!!
Towards stupid human kind
Raw Hatred
Toward bastards goats of god

Silet per diem universus 
nec sine horrore secretus est

A reign of dust
unholy charms

beyond the shadows of the start
About cold, darkness and hatred
