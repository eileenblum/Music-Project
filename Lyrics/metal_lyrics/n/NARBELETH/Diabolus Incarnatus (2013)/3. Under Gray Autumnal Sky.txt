How different is life
within solitude embrace
under grey autumnal sky
no fucking light shed

No human flesh, no breathing
no senseless rotten society
Visions of endless glorious times
away from the ancient plague so called mankind

No redemption...
No salvation!!!
Purification!
All will die!!!

No human flesh
No human breath
Oh! I just need a knife!
This is my sacrifice!

No human flesh, no breathing
no senseless rotten society
goats to the slaughterhouse
blood is the redemption now...
