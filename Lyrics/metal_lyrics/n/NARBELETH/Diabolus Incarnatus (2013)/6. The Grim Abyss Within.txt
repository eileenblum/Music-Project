Is again the night a battlefield
and I stand alone!!!
A new cult unleashed by the fury of hell
A new path to the grim abyss within

The winds are getting stronger
Feel the storm arrives!
The thunders are getting closer

Is again the night a battlefield
and I stand alone!!!

I am hate in flesh!
I am blasphemy in voice!
And I am... the enemy!!!

Behold...
My kingdom of black fire!
Behold...
The fall of world!
Behold...
The grim abyss within!

For us, the lost of our kind...
It's time to arise again!

I am hate in flesh!
I am blasphemy in voice!
And I am... the enemy!!!
