Eternally in darkness
I must dwell
IÂ´ve tasted the winds of hell
more that one can say

Intense as thousand nights
are my paths on earth
unholy altar of madness
condemned to my own kingdom of hate

I invoke thee, breath of darkest night
immortalize my soul, my mind...
While I walk unholy paths

Heavens cries over blasphemous land
the devil is cleaning my jewel throne
no remorse because the deads by my hands
and for the corpses under my boots

This inverted cross means you are empty
and my spikes are your torture
this raw sound is the song of your death
and this face, your reaper
