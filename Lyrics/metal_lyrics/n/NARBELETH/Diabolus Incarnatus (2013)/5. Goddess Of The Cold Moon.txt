She was born where the sun is black
A realm of grim creations
A world made from the depths
where darkness draws itself
Goddess of the cold moon
so far from my nights
another day of sorrow
fills my veins and makes my heart darker

YouÂ´ve pierced my armour
With your spear of shadows
And I do of thee my sign 
From your flaming eyes... and yourself
I will do my sacrifice
When the fullmoon lights the earth
My mind is thirsting for more
My body is ready to rise above

My Delirium! 
Take me in your night embrace
Carry me with your poisoned lips
I'm thirsty of your grace
let me ride with you again... and again...

I'm dying
Of burning desire
my claws scratch the walls
my veins clamor to be filled with more
I agonize
through eternal voids
save me from the light
I clamour to fade within your black fire
Goddess of the Cold Moon
