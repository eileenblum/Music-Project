In desolate landscape
with a cold moon above
as a door to eternity...
(we shall cross...)

Infinity opens
before the solitude,
from in side to the eternity
and beyond

Once again it' s Black Metal
from distant grimness
raw as the stone
isolated in blasphemy

In desolate landscape
with a dark cliff below
as a door to eternity
we shall cross,
once and for all.
