I've seen the battles of ancient times
I've heard tha war call of the horns
I've been inside the great wood's mouth
And the dark leaned into my eyes.

I've seen the torches flames
dancing in the obscure nights
I've seen the grim revenge
of pagan blood in darkest path

He's waiting for the nightfall
He's smelling each step
ancient spirit of the underworld
for the pride will ride again
As we are the midnight hordes
shall the sun rise black again.

I've seen the battles of ancient times
I've heard tha war call of the horns
The grim revenge of pagan blood
in the darkest path shall rise again.
