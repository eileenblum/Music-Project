Like a roaring cacophony
militant sound of Black Metal
ripping down to a posoned aura of hate
holding the seeds of forbidden.

Isolated dissonant sounds
frostbitten in time, in darkness

Genuine demons in human form
creating his own on the underground.

Ahead dwells a deep, dark impenetrable night
legions born from the flames of nihilism
weapons are blasphemy and fire,

a heavy artillery of sounds,
powerful and infernal impulses
dark primitive cult.
