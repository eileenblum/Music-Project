[C. Orlando, Pagliuso, G. Orlando]

Uncomfort within the improper feelings of this song
I'd rather grey instead of marbled pearly skies
Its imprint is alive like a post-war Stalingrad
A sense of broken Atlantis capes alive

Underside, underwater miles
There's a treasure for you just to find
Light sand stars, precious minerals

A treasure to find
You are my treasure to find
A caress of water, caress of life,
A caress of aquamarine water

Someone is wrong
A lifelessness alive
I won't be long
The time to ask the night
How could it go so abominably wrong
Someone is wrong

A caress of water, a caress of aquamarine dark
A caress of lifelessness alive
A lifelessness alive
