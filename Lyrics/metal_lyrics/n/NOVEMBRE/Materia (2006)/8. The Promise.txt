[Le Bon, Rhodes, Taylor]

Testo The Promise (Arcadia)

Whose tears on a gaping voice
Who's stretching arms match
The hunger of mine
There lips will they never join
But always draw me closer
And further entwined
With a promise dealer understand
All freedoms fade away
To a point of view
Where many different pathways meet
And we're standing on this precipice
With nothing much to gain save
But the deep blue screams
Of falling dreams
With our next move

Heaven hide your eyes
Heaven's eyes will never dry

The shades of a thousand steel
Come flashing by my face
In the fury of war
In desolation and abandoned fields
The hungry make their stand
When they'll stand for no more
Hear the passion in their voices
See the heaven in their eyes
Their hopes and schemes are waiting
Dreams of less than paradise
And sometimes we make promises
We never mean to keep
For blackmail is the only deal
A promise dealer sees

Heaven hide your eyes
Heaven's eyes will never dry
