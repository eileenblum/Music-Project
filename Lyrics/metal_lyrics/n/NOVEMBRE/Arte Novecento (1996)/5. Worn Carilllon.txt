I saw your daydream shattering to countless flakes of falling snow
They were bright as stars, and each of them were a magic wish to come true
But sometimes they hurt, unbearably they hurt
And that joy is now pain and it's consuming me day by day
The cloud of love which once you used to envelope my dry heart
has been blown away and now just find the darkest starless night
And your eyes now hurt, they wound me deep inside
And your love is now pain and it's consuming me day by day
And now you hurt, unbearably deep inside
And my hope now it fades, and it's fading day by day
An arson of pain leaves me kneeling in flames
Your weary silence draws my landscapes with rain
So take my last wishes with you far away
And give me one more minute for my last prayer
The silence of time wears all that has been 
And you like the time numb the feelings I feel
There is no splendour, nor dream
Just the ruin of our crumbling realm
