The water's flowing down the river of the memories of days without a sound
The waters carry away the memories of days lost in the abyss of my dawn
Back to your lonely eyes
I'm remembering you wandering through
empty rooms of what used to be our paradise
The waters carry away memories of your eyes found in the album of my mind, found in the pages of my dawn
Forever kept inside my heart
As year erase all names and memories of what we've done
I miss something in this life
As the joining thread has broken and our paths are split
I realize that thing I miss is you
