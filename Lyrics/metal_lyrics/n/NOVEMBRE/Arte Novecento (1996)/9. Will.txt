Hey you creature who came from the night
Why do I feel the need to lose myself deep in your eyes?
Is it the same reason for your face tells of a cry?
Or is it simply our longing arms just willing to entwine?
Tell me what divides our lips from the so yearned unending kiss
What is this misery joining your rainy sky with mine?
Can you hear me screaming?
Can you hear me screaming from inside?
