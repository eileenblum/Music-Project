There in those tears where I had to leave you drowning
My pearl, you went to face the most cruel of my gifts
And now I'm here to face the cold of what I've done
Not finding anything to calm the pain that came to wash my faults
Misunderstandings, of what our hearts said
I've lost what of purer I could find in the sky
And now I could never forget the void I daubed in your eyes
Those eyes I would hold in my hands, your tears in which now I'd die to drown
Beating the strings of a guitar to pay for the weight of my blames
the shade of your loss burns my soul to the bone
And now I'm here to heal the wounds your unjust pain has left to me
just not finding anything to calm the rain
Misunderstandings, of what our mouths had never said
We've lost the last glares we could find in this sludge
