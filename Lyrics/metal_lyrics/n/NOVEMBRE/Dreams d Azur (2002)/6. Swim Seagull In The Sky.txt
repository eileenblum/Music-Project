[Classical guitar solo: Carmelo]

Speechless
Unreal
Drowning in an abyssal silence

Slowly moving this immensity
I fly, swimming in this dark blue sky
It's cold, I'm scarred and besides rust
Even ice covers these doors

[Solo: Carmelo]

God knows how I'd be awake now
God knows how my eyes would tear now
God knows how I wouldn't lose my way
God knows how scared I am
How the seagull would pass away

[Solo: Carmelo]

Swim seagull in the sky

[Solo: Carmelo]
