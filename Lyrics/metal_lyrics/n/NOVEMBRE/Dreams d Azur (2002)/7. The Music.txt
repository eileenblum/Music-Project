Incomprehensible like life
Unexplainable like infinity
My lord our god
An abstract entity the music is

Inconceivable like life
Immeasurable like infinity
My god our lord
It witnessed our beginning so the music is

Annihilating, upsetting
Mirror of joys and sorrows

It lives outside reality's walls
And we are its doors to our dimension
It comes through our emotions
It runs through our art
And come out from our veins
From our pains

And so we use it right annihilate
And so we use it right to upset
Coming out from our pains
From our veins
