Life blows cold at my face now
And I see it and I suffer it again
A frame after the other
A second after the other

A guitar screams as I reach my last shore
In front of me there's just a sea
The immense sea of a last goodbye
And behind me, emptiness
Just the emptiness of a life

I've tried, but I can't see nothing else
No more romanticism in this waves
No more poetry in the eternal hate
Between the sea and the sky

Hate, hate breeding the unreachability of the horizon

I felt the fury of centuries eating this rocks away
I've seen the millennia sweeping away millions of mortals
Dying still searching for the meaning of this striving in vain
Striving just to disappear into the oblivion of an abyss

These waves to infinity are calling me know
And I'd never thought their call could ever be so irresistible
I join them, I drown in them, I lust with them, I pass
I pass away by them as I'm as one with them now
