Steal a diamond and pierce my heart
with its point
And take three silver drops of blood
to sow your dried flesh
Use the harvest you get to appease the hunger
of your crowd, which drains
you day by day, draining you away

You wanna eat my pearly eyes
to fill the void you've got
Inside, sweet child of mine , you've got inside

The pearly gates you dream of, are made of
mortal hopes you stole away
The pearly gates you long for are made of
Innocent night beings, heavenly unpure
and yet so pure

I feel ashamed for your soul
This war seems to reach a crying end
But why your very tears they never fall?
your very mask it never fades away?
your very face ain't going to be shown?
