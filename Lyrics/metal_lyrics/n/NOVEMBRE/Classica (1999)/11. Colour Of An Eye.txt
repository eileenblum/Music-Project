[2008 remastered version bonus track]

And drain me to the core
This fenceless crown of stars
Dissolve all those benumbing clouds of frozen grains of rust
The forest of the weak has burnt away
Caught from a solar wrath
It's been swallowed from inside

And curl me up inside,
And kill the rain with its thunders
Take me on and drain me to the soul

Please come inside my house
And take the treasures from my safe
No need to claim this hollow land, it's yours
Please step inside my eyes and draw the colour off my iris
Paint a landscape with a cry of joy

And curl me up inside,
And kill the rain with its thunders
Take me on and drain me to the bones

Look deeper in my eyes
And find another world
And all those words that I do not say anymore
This senseless crown of stars dissolve
Those benumbing clouds of rust
I've got inside


Thanks to daxrulez for sending track #11 lyrics.
