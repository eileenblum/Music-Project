I'm watching outside the (window) glass
As street light diffuses through the hall
Somewhere (Winter)'s lifting shades of war
Chilling me in the darkness of this fall

The Piano falls

As shadows watch the rain we tremble on our bed
In sheets of silver silk, as the world's heart loses its feel

The old town greets the pain with monuments of shame
This clock slowed down its hands,Its echoing the rain
Stop begging me to stay, stop begging me to stay
Just let me run away

This season's out time
Events sculptured in time
Through everlong time-rain

Sing one Wintersong the way you've always done,
for me
A Wintersong of pain the way you've always done,
for me
