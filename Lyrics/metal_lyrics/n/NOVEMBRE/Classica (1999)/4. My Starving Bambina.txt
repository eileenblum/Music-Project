Now that the leaves are descending down
I'm piercing the heart of the Sun
'Cause Summer gave you back to the ground

My "Leaf" you've been taken away
That goddamned night filled the sky
Shading your rays of life

Your spirit always takes me back to streets of
starving cries
But now take me, please, with you away

Don't know if I'll give in now, but I'll meet you
Patrizia Again
I swear
