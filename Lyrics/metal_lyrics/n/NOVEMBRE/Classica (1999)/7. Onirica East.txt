And I leave your world
As a little alien, broken hearted
Night stained eyed
Solitude-stained eyes
As I jump in my shuttle
Away through the ocean sky
With my dolphins guiding my ride

Across the Sirengates I ride
Scattering the ashes of your portrait
With wells of hate among stars opaque:stars

C'e un luogo a nord di Arcadia oltre I mari Esei
Dove non c'e mai veglia ne perche:
:Onirica

[TRANSLATION:]
There's a place, north of Arcadia
Beyond the Esei seas,
where there's no wakefulness nor reasons
