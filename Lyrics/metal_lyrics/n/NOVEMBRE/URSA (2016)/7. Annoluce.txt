I used to come here
Textiles all over, and lamps
And colours of centuries flash from the stands
Do not lose my hand now
Weâre in a tempest of sound
Our stranger wind brought us here from afar

A journey through lightning ending now
A song made of light spreading around

I just wanna end this ride
That life has turned into this rusting pile of pipes
Cos I believe that there is more than meets the eye
In this script of anger
Brought to tears until the Sun died

And a journey through lightning ending now
A song made of light spreading around
A million eyelids closing down, A million eyes

I saw the files that they have on me, 
I saw the chambers of new bright opinions they sewn in your flash
I saw the files that she has on me, setting this astral conjunction against 
all the reasons and odds

I used to come here
Storms have swept it apart
a swirl of memories hitting the land, with the wind and the sand
Do not lose my hand now
Weâre in a âlagerâ of sound
Which brought us here in a light-year of bleeding and screaming and cries
