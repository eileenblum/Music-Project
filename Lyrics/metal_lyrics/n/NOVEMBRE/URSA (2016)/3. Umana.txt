Thereâs something in the fringes of your mind 
That keeps you up all night 
The Spirit of the Ages softly whispering in your head 

Youâre out of your mind - it says the higher mouth 
As in this sorry nation two and two results in shame 

Iâve tried to confide in someone 
Find shelter from decay 
My hand leaned on someoneâs 
To feel the acid in the taste 

But Iâm not afraid 
And Iâm not humane 

Our souls float, unaware of the scale of the awakening 
The fear is whole, consuming us through the crisis 

âThe crisis - is a crisis in consciousness, a crisis that cannot any more accept the old norms. Man is still, as he was, brutal, violent, aggressive, competitive, and he has built a society along these linesâ
[Jiddu Krishnamurti 1966]
