The bearâs arms around me
Am I an empire of sadness, and time
The Ministry of Nowhere
Declared me an apostate of State
But I stole nothing, in a world of plague
Is there a den to hide in, hide

All this is sad and senseless 

Inside the barn, thereâs a congress of ingenuous eyes
The world I see is ending tonight, please stay inside
Distance and ice in this animal sovietica

Crawl to where the crow died. It kept the sadness alive
For what? You thought your thoughts flew up there, to a just sky

All this is sad and senseless

All these years of snow and sleep perennial
Mirrors of a sin aeternitas
In a rainy Reich, mirrors of my losing of your hand 

If weâre to die youâre the one Iâd rather be beside
The world I see is ending tonight, please stay inside

Listen, tonight youâre the one Iâd rather be beside 
Donât wanna see what happens outside, please stay inside
