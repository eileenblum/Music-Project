Oh, you feel the night
Dancing its soul all the way

Iâm gonna strip down the sky
Of all its lies 
Where hopes are bred and thrown away

Oh, you feel the dance
Filling all the rivers and your veins
Oh, you feel the dance
Piercing through the withered yesterday

Why did it have to die?
Why did it have to die?
When are you coming back?

All you feel inside
Is merely all the breathing universe
All you feel inside
Frees us from the famine and the pain

Atomic dawn,
In which you sealed the sound of your name
You no longer swim in this sludge

Why does it have to die?
Why did you have to die?
When are you coming back?
