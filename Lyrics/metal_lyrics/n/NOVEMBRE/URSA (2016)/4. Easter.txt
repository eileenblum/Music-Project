Here in this shroud of light
Centuries staring at me through the haze
In a slow demise
Lines of a song looking away

In a slow demise
In a low streaming of scent
In a touch of Gloria
I see your face

Letâs have the night
And drink from the chalice 
In rivers of Saturn
Bodies pass me by from the tide
In this sin

A desire, pollutes the skies of the town
Determines the upraising
The oldest breach of the caste, roaring out loud

Here in a shroud of fright
Pages of madness staring at me
Lines of a song atavic
Veins of a son taken away

In a slow demise
In a low streaming of scent
In a touch of Gloria
I see your face
