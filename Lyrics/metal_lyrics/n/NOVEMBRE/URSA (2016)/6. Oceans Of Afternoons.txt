Letâs just stay in this spot for a while
Quite with the Sun at our backs
As it ceases to bathe us
A panorama of cyan

And these senses enfolding the heart
Slow as a flood of blue magma
And deceiving the morning into night
Spaces entwining with time

And running far away
And then I fled the world 
And then I failed the world
An unrepentant world

Here in a cinema of flowing time (of tomorrow)
You gave me kisses of breeze and sky
Sooner or later Iâm coming back
Finding all the things I forgot
And reason why I got lost in this fog

And running far away
And then I fled the world 
And then I fled the world 
And then I failed the world

And Iâll stay till the morning will come
