Life blows cold at my face now
And I see it and I suffer it again
A frame after the other
A second after the other

A guitar scream as I reach my last shore
In front of me there's just a sea
The immense sea of a last goodbye
And behind me emptiness
Just the emptiness of a life

I've tried it, but I can't see nothing else
No more romanticism in these waves
No more poetry in the eternal hate
Between the sea and the sky

Hate, hate breeding the unreachability of an horizon

I've felt the fury of the centuries eating these rocks away
I've seen the millennia sweeping away millions of mortals
Dying still searching for the meaning of this striving in vain
Striving just to disappear into the oblivion of an abyss

These waves to infiny are calling me now
And I'd never through their call could ever be so irresistible
I join them, I drown in them, I lust with them, I pass
I pass away by them as I'm as one with them now
