[SOLO - Carmelo]

Speechless
Unreal
Drowning in an abyssal silence

Slowly moving through this immensity
I fly, swimming in this darkblue sky
It's cold, I'm scared and besides rust
Even ice covers these doors

[SOLO - Antonio]

God knows hoe I'd be awake now
God knows how my eyes would tear now
God knows how I wouldn't lose my way
God knows how scared I am
How the seagull would pass away:

[SOLO - Carmelo]

Swim seagull in the sky

[SOLO - Fabio]
