I can't say where you are
Can't see where you are
Can't stay in the Sun
And I wonder, why am I even here right now
Attending this slow parade
Of massive figures and clouds
And I'm going to kill you
For you have slain my child
Enchained me in this maze
Of your eyes and your bluest lights
Leftovers of my mind
To witness what once was
Ice in endless columns, alive
I can't see where you are
Can't say where you are
Can't stay in the sunlight
In a sentimental requiem held until today
A last sparkle of renascence leading me the way
Blind, I'm facing the Sun
Drag my bones onward
Yet nobody's son
Yet another last beauticracy of yours, again
And in sapphire coldest rays
There's rescue under the rain
A chance to prey,
The horror is through the air
Much too dark here
Pull back the curtains and let the Sun in
