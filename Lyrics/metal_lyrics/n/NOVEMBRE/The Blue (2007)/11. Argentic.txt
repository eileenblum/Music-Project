I lit the sunlight with my hands
Knowing there's to be some reason
For this ever coming dark
All I want to find is a way
For these cardboard wings to fly
Their blackened feathers up again
Not a tiny breadcrumb trace
To retrieve the lost Argentic pathway leading us away
Oh, my naked angel face
Now it is my turn to drag you to tomorrow
All your light faded away
'Cause you have given all the strength you had
To someone else
Touch me and relieve me from the plague of sorrow
Touch me and heal me with your silvers colours
Touch me
I lit the sunlight with my hands
Knowing there's to be some reason
For this ever coming dark
Not a tiny breadcrumb trace
To retrieve the lost Argentic pathway leading us away
Touch me and relieve me from the plague of sorrow
Touch me and heal me with your silver colours
Touch me
I reached the Sun myself and found nothing there
To clear the reason for this ever coming grey
And all there's left to find's the way (back) to the fields
Of silver colours you once used to share with me
As this nights beholds no dawn
