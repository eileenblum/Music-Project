It flows out from inside
It builds cities and fairytales
Reachable from here through a stairway of dust
But fail to restore
The themes and rhymes and the frescoes half-lights
And then smear'em with everlasting paint
It flows out from inside
Arising architheme of the Earth
Nazarene of filthless time
Spare me your goddamned wonders
And give us back the day
Reach out from the weight of the debris of the Earth
(Reaching out from here with more cries
Debris of the arcade of the Earth)
And I stand under the vaults
And find just the meaning of the end
As I finally walked the Sorrowful Way
