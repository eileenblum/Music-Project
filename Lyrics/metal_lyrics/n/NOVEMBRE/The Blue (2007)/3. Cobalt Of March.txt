Sceneries far from the Sun
Far from the dust
Glide into dusk
Cobalt of Match
I see your eyes above the arch of your smile
Lost in this nighttime through the daze of its dark
I see your eyes lost in the quietness of March
In the striations of the cobalt of March
I see (that) this numb mourning dies
I see (that) this orchid was born to be taken away
I see your eyes above the arch of the sky
I see your eyes throughout the gaze of the night
I see your eyes closed, in the coldness of March
Lost in the glaciers of the cobalt of March
I see (that) this numb mourning dies
I see (that) this life
Was just meant to be taken away
Centuries under the Sun
Biting the dust
I fade away into September
My soul is gonna return
And it will be for just one time
To say that nothing truly dies
And I've seen (that) the world
Has stopped since that time
Singing lullabies to make us all forget
And that same world fell by its own fire
And I try to cope but still cannot forget
