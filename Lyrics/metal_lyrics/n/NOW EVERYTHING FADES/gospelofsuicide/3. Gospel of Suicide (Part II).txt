Baptized in distress and desolation
Crucified on a stake of futile doctrine
The divine blood of my thoughts
Is the only covenant to endure

The sacrament of self destruction
Is burning the heresy of holding on
As the idols of deliverance
Are worshiped by all those memories

The angels are heading toward the gallows
For merciful slow painful death
Even the demons are trembling
In a scene so tragic, despotic

Let there be loss
Let there be lost
Let there be anguish
From the womb to the dust
Let there be mourning
Let there be pain
Let there be ravens
Again and again

The hanged angels are chanting
Profane voices, suicidal choices
A prophecy for the miserable
This fate is horrible

Build a shrine here
Their cries must be heard
And pray for the nihilist
Pray for the apostate
