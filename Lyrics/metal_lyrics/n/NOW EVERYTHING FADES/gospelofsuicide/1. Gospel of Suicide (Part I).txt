In the church of self-loathing
Internal grief and anger
The prayers to break reality
The chants of suicide

Where the angels wash our wrists
And god's tears drown us alive
On the altar of ropes and razors
I pray for the last time

As the night hits my temple
The faith will fade away
The fallen cathedrals inside my chest
Are bleeding for atonement

Another confession
I am sick of being the martyr
Or the saint of agony
The salvation is here

Where the angels wash our wrists
And god's tears drown us alive
On the altar of ropes and razors
I pray for the last time

Inside my head
A Gospel Of Suicide
where death is my religion
And living is the sin
