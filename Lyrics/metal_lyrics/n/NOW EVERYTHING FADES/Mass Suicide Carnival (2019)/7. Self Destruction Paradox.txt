I cut to breath
I bleed to live
Self-destructive patterns to cope with life
I slit to feel free
I get numb to forget
Self-destructive motives to cope with existence

I live to cut
I breath to bleed
I can't cope with your existence
I am free to slit whatâs left of me
I am numb enough to forget your reality

Escaping from self-awareness
Finding my inner peace
Releasing all the grief inside
Facing my hidden fears

Running from ultimate guilt
Forgiving my mistakes
Running from the memories of abuse
Forgetting all the past
