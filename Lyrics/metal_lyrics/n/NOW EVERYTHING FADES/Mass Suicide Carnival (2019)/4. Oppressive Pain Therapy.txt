What happened to me?
How did I cut myself this way?
I donât understand anything anymore
How did I survive last night?

The constant noise is killing me
Am I really awake now ?
Can anyone find me here?
What a miserable life...

What am I doing here?
Is this the end of my sanity?
Should I just leave this place?
Should I wait for some days?

Will death stop the noise inside?
Will death end this misery?
Please stop the life from spinning
I can't take this anymore
