We're marching out
Dressed up as human beings
With masks of strength and faith
Leaving a trail of blood
Floating around the earth

These costumes we call flesh
Are torn enough to cover these veins
The masks are feeble
The masks are falling down

We're marching out
Listening to the melodies of razors and guns

Feeling the ecstasy with ropes around our necks
Leaving a trail of razors
Floating around this shell

Its the last carnival on this filthy planet
With voices louder than the sun
We curse this ugly race
