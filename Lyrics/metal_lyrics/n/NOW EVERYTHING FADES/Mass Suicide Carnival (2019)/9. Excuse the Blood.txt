[Tribute to Dead]

I am not a human being.
This is just a dream,
Itâs all in our heads
But soon..Soon I will awake

These cuts got deeper
Every single day
These buried clothes doesnât smell anymore
Bury me again, Bury me forever

The dead crow inside my breaths
Was giving me the strength to scream

Its April now, and I am alone
I'll let my wrists scream with my throat
And the shotgun will do the rest

Excuse the blood
