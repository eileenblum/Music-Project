I am heading there
Far away into the heart of the sea
Until your city look small
Where peace can devour me

I'll take away with me
All disappointments and woes

And wash myself clean
Away with the color of the ocean

The water is so cold today
Colder than my world
The waves embrace my thoughts
My oppressive thoughts

My cold ocean
I choose you to be my savior
Rise and swallow my worthless existence
Rise and cover all these scars

I am surrendering to your waves
Come and take me away from here
I refuse to breath their air anymore
Let me drown please
