Itâs getting dark again
The worst days are yet to come

Will I choke myself again?
Will I forgive myself this time?

The guilt tortures my reality
Every night is my execution night
Every day is my funeral
Someday I'll set me free

I forgot how it feels
To live without guilt
To live without fear
To live like all of you

I see an ugly figure in the mirror
A person that should leave
A person that I despise

Itâs getting darker today
This day I might let go
I am choking myself again
I can't forgive anymore
