Can you hear me screaming?
Hallucinating in pain
I am here to burn myself
Into worthless ashes

Listen to the fire consuming me
Cracking and squeaking
A symphony for the living corpses
An ode to the miserable

Every scream in agony
Releases a thousand memories
As the melting flesh surrenders to the power of the scorned flames

Dance with me
To the sound of suicide theater
Sway with me as I am leaving this stink
Into worthless ashes

Life pushed me to the edge
Sorrow consumed the meaning
Love burnt it all
I want nothing but the end
