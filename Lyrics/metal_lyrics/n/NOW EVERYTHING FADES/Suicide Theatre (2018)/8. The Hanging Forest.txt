In the hanging forest
We tie the knots so tight
The thirst for peace is eating away
Surrendering to the force of gravity

I hear the birds weeping
While I am catching my last breath
Eyes can't stop rolling
Seeking for the end

I am joining the fleet of hanging bodies
Drawing an artwork with flesh and bones
Releasing all human emotions free
Merging what's left of me with the forest

I feel like I am the conductor
For these orchestral mourning trees
The birds will chant my name forever
But the ground will never devour me

The rope is now my only savior
The forest is my only home
I am turning into nothing
From Nothing to nothing
