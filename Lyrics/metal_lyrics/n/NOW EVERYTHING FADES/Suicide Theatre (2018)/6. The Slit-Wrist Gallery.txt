For all the tragic scars on my wrist
You are the written history
And every drop of bleed I shed
Fed me the strength to go on

All the blood around me
Are turning black as the night
Black as the falling sanity
The color of space and time

In the shadows of solitude
Cast your shades on this torn wrist
Spill the hope
Spill the dream
Spill the pain

In this full-moon dusk
Only one wish remained
I hope you all die slowly
