I am so tired
I am getting old for this nonsense
These empty rooms are lonely

For those who left,
I wish you misfortune for the life to come
For the pain you dig inside
For leaving all these pages empty
Why did you leave?

For those who died,
I am coming soon my dears
I don't belong to this life anymore
I am packing my memories to meet you all

I am so tired
I am getting old for this nonsense
I've been waiting death for years
I am writing my own ending
God's version I don't accept
It's way too cruel
