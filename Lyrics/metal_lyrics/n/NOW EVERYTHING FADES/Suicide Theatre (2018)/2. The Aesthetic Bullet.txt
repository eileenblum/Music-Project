The echoes of desperate woes
The chants of self-destruction
The prayers of the lost
Are melting around my finger

Pull the trigger
Feel the memories stain the walls
The color of love and hate
The artistic way to leave

I am no longer afraid
I am not coming back
Feel free to curse my soul
The struggle was always mine

Pull the trigger
Feel the beauty burst the skull
Paint the scene with bloody shade
Dance around my corpse
And sing with your loudest voice
