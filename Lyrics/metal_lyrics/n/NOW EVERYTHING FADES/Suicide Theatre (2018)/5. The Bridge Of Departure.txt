It's been a long life
Nothing new to see, feel and hate
Deception and greed
Betrayal and loss

Down below
The voices inside will fade away
Crossing to the other side is just one leap away
One breath away
Nothing more will happen today

Let the winds carry my will
I'll smile before reaching the ground
I promise,
I'll fly away from all of you
You pathetic creatures
Let my hate scatter all over earth

Let the wind play my music
I'll sing the scream all the way down
I'll be the god of my own symphony
The god of all misery

When the scene is ended
Don't wish me peace
I got none when I was breathing
I want none out there
