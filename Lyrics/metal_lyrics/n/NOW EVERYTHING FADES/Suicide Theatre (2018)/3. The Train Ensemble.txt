Let me stand between your arms
I beg for mercy for the last time
Crash my body into a thousand pieces
And spread what's left of me
All around your iron rails

Orchestrate the ending
Caress my bones and shout
Deafen my eyes and soul
Blind my eyes and heart

Embrace my torture
I don't want to live for another day
I am taking myself to the last ride
Along the blue skies above

I can hear the choirs getting louder and closer
In this church of bitter railway..
I stand for the last time
