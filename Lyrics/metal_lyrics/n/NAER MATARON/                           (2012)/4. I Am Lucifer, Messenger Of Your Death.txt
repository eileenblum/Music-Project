Pale humans, pale causes
Petrifactions, orphans of sickness
Hideous, rotten to the core
Soaked, bigots from the east

You swear to your lies, the holy bible
You testify your lies against all that is vigor
You are the last tinder before your final doom
Lies...

After the final veredict they will be through with you
The golden hair leader will smile with irony
And nod the beginning of your end

They shall wash away the filth that engulfs you
For you have chosen your future
For you have destroyed our holy tree
Sworn enemies, plunged in lies

You swear to your lies, the holy bible
You testify your lies against all that is vigor
You are the last tinder before your final doom
Lies...

Fabrications of denial
You, who cannot bear ugliness
You detest everything beautiful and vigor, of divine essence

I take charge to be the conductor of your torment
I am lucifer, messenger of your death
When the light of the eternal phoebus returns
Will crush your ugliness, your weak pathetic bodies
