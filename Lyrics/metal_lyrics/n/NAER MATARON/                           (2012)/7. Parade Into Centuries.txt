One year is swept away
The novel one arrives
And from the yester year
I carry within my heart
And soul the moment of the mist
One glimpse around the fire
One breath of sacred night
Sanctified to the invincible sun

Throughout the centuries
And into the great idea of our dreams
Around a sacred flame,
Feasting the everlasting worship
Saluting with the eternal way
We sworn our oath again
Hallowed oath, sworn to the dead
Sanction to the immortal idea

Forlorn by time we guard
The secret meaning of existence
One spark of insobriety
Divine and inner joy
The whispers of primordial past
Rest alive inside our hearts
Amongst the atrocious sounds
Of an unworthy age
