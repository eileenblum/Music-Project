The greatest wind of all
Son of Astaraios and Eios
With his power he can tear your skin
With one blow he can move a mountain

From podogrous born
The winged horses of Achilles
A mighty demon-god
From the depths of the netherworld

He is the messenger of spring
His symbol the winged horse
A great warrior
Winged, powerful and proud

Oh, mighty Zephyrous
Give us thy strength
Crush all our enemies
With your dragon sword
