Full moon the night's silence
The murmur of leaves, a hope
Into the dark, happiness the rain
His work room got brightened by a lain
Old books, dim images
Dreams and primal sacrifices
Experiments, medieval voices
Occult writings, the notions (beliefs)

Wotan's statues with emeralds
Rivers' ancient deities
Flowers that blossom at night
And mortuary effigies of Gods

Into the abyss, the love, the magic
And the stone, life everlasting
Proud he is marching
Towards the Elysian Fields
Along his way, the shadows and the dead

Zeus (Wrath of the Gods):
For years they were silent
Forgotten by their followers
Who forgot their ancient power
Who forgot their terrible wrath

Wake up masters of my soul
Your disciples are waiting for your call

Now Zeus has risen from Olympus
And sit on his golden throne
Aris has gathered up the hordes of doom
To regain the lost realm

Wake up masters of my soul
Your disciples are waiting for your call

Artemis slays the unfaithful
With the help of Aris lord of war
Soon all the kingdoms will be fallen
And Zeus will be the ruler of this world
