Son of Europa rise up your head
Wherever you see plain
Before it was a forest
Under the ice, have remainded
Our traces of our arms!

When it's full moon
When the wind blows
Along the path, you can hear a song
A song which tales, where we begun
To fight invisible enemies
Along the path we crossed by
Between us different languages, but one tradition
Between us different nations, but one legion

We begun spring
The woods where green (and) the trees in bloom
Beyond these mountains
There, where we stopped
Wounded by winter
We the new soldiers, while our hearts
Inside the tanks
We silver eagles
We, the frozen Eagles

From the path we will not return again
You young of Europa, do not forget us!
