The Sun has set behind the poles
And the hardest time begins
Ruthless ice reigns supreme
Even the hardest ones will bleed
Times of darkness, death and ruin
The streets awake with scents of pain
Troops of death desire to kill
Warriors crave the warmth of blood

Uprooting the Hyksos!
Uprooting the Hyksos!

Thatâs the world of my days
So beautiful, angelical
Silence byes a place in it
Deny your faith, bow and crawl
An old tradition now revives
Barbarism the desert borne
Your corpses taken from your kin
Burned and scattered to the winds

As then, remember? Thousands of years ago
Like every time I seized a city
Against the darkness of the measureless
The light will be always carried by a child

Uprooting the Hyksos!
Uprooting the Hyksos!

Uproot the Shepherd People
Tear down the Shepherd Kings
Embody Tethmosis, Amenophis, Ramses

Uproot the Shepherd People
Tear down the Shepherd Kings
Embody Tethmosis, Amenophis, Ramses

Surrender to the Typhon of your cowardness
To earn a place beneath the Sun
Of this immoral, rotten state
Deny your faith, bow and crawl

Begone! Infected people!
Lepers of the mines!
Flee unto the desert of Avaris
The city of Typhon

Uproot the Shepherd People
Tear down the Shepherd Kings
Embody Tethmosis, Amenophis, Ramses
