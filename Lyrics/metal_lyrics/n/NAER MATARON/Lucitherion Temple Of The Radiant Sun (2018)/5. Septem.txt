Septem
Aghios! Aghios o Drakontas!
Aghios! Aghios Athanatos!

Hear me Dragon! What more you ask from me?
You laid me bare of clothes and saw me naked
You put me in chains but I won't shed a tear
For you and I, we become one
Come Dragon! Let us become one!
It's the moment when the hunter becomes prey
We will unite for an unholy act, a greater cause
Our fame will precede us
