The human cannot bear too much reality
I bet in man's instinctive urge to hope
I make use of him, bypassing reason and judgment
And set the rules of psychological deceit

Connecting to the unconsciousness
Images of voluptuous lusts
Seizing your desires, unraveling false delusions
I steal your will away, deceitful ways

I will finally grant you the fix you crave so long
Pretending to block your dive into the chaos
Through brutal humiliation, scoff and mockery
You'll sign the pact of inhuman slavery

You shall immerse in famine!
You shall immerse in defeat!
You shall immerse in famine!
You shall immerse in defeat!

You live in profound decadence
Addicted to your fix
Dependent on the demagogues
Believers in nothing

Forever your life in distress
Unbearably drown in iniquity
Swamped by a persecution against quality

You shall immerse in famine!
You shall immerse in defeat!

Parasite, sadistically tormented
As your offspring's soul is crushed
Humanity is abolished
Masses depraved
All hope is lost
Carthago Delenda Est!
