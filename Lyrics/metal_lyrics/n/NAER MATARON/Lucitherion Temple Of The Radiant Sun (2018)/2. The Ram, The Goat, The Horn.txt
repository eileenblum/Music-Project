My King!

My head is boiling, I suffocate
With the desire to unveil what I saw
My vision freely I reveal to thee
Your humble servant, I

The fires shall burn! Sanctuary purged!
The temple shall fall! Sanctuary purged!

I lifted my eyes and I saw a Ram
At the shores of river Ouval
Bearing horns, rising grand
Striking them unto the North and the South

The fires shall burn! Sanctuary purged!
The temple shall fall! Sanctuary purged!

And Lo! Behold! Here comes the Goat of Goats
Storming the earth with great speed
Between his eyes he bears the Horn of Horns
I saw him come against the Ram

He was enraged at the sight of the Ram
He thrashed it hard and crushed its horns
The Goat attacks! The Ram is crushed!
And he becomes the Goat of Goats
Glorious! Supreme!

Upon his greatest glory
His great Horn was crushed
And in its place four new Horns grew
Unto the East and unto the South
The greatest Horn rose up to the skies
And pierced the skiesâ¦

And a part of the stars fell down
And the men set their feet on them
And the men of god were captured
The Sanctuary of Jerusalem was purged

Subdued by the Man with the Horn
The temple of god laid to waste
Godâs people scattered to the Earth
He smite godâs holy flock

The fires shall burn! Sanctuary purged!
The temple shall fall! Sanctuary purged!
