Yes the battleships shall blaze once more
The thunders of our revival shall crack once more

Through the giant cannons of our battleships
Our troops will storm once more
Unto the south and unto the north
We'll crush the enemy and establish the new order

The time has come
The ancient race of Sodom is declined and corrupted
Our bodies are filthy and infected
Never had we been so dirty

Demonic Beast - men suppress us from high above
Slaughtering us without conscience

Why don't you seek a hell in the other world?
As not hell the world we live in
And the one that burns within us?

From within the celebrations of the unchained divine man
We can conquer the whole world
The fire could burn
Until sparks burst from the barrels of our battleships

The time has come
The ancient race of Sodom is declined and corrupted
Our bodies are filthy and infected
Never had we been so dirty

And the gunshots shall blaze
And order restored
A new clergy shall rise in the land of Sangreal
Shall rise from the ancient soil
And shall chain the apes of Sodom
