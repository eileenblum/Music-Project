From the longest night in the year
From the deepest darkness of human existence
From the despair and the resignation
Sol invictus is reborn in the solstice in December

Let's turn our eyes inside
Our race's bloody river flows
There where our ancestors live
Let reach out our hand towards them

The fire will burn until the twelfth night
In the mirror of the sky
In the circle of the twelve immortals

Let's turn our eyes inside
Our race's bloody river flows
There where our ancestors live
Let reach out our hand towards them

As the days and the nights of autumn and winter
The veil that separates the world of mortals
From the spirit world, becomes thinner and thinner

Unfold the banners light the candles and the torches
Flame up in your hearts the flame
Which lights the darkness of denial of our faith
Forge the power of your action
