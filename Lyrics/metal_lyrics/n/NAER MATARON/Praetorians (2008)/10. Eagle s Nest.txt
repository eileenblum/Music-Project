Getting on the eagle's nest
Walking through the red forest
Ascending the rough snaky way

Up from the clouds in the snowy mountain top
Always to be followed by the sleepless eye of the eagle
He holds in his talons the eternal snake
Surveying proudly the parade of his army
Above the maps of Europe
The last sacrifice - The republic and the solitude
Fire! To burn the paradise
Water! To extinguish hell
There up high, they sign again that eternal song
The eagle is perching and he rises as a giant
Above the graves and the ruins
He jarres from the foundation the leaden land
Exciting with his wings the unholy silence

The last sacrifice - The republic and the solitude
Fire! To burn the paradise
Water! To extinguish hell
There up high, they sign again that eternal song
Playing the drums of war
He flies interial in the sky
Observing the viper's seed
As an eagle from above, an avenger
Chanting that cursed spell
Inculcating the black hordes
Getting on the eagle's nest
Walking through the red forest
Ascending the rough snaky way

He Holds In His Talons The Eternal Snake
Surveying Proudly The Parade Of His Army
Above The Maps Of Europe
