Death thousand drops of blood
Over white marble
Harmonically created
Upon sacred and holy soil
Noorished with pure virgin blood

Each time you are brought by the dawn
Each time you are taken by darkness
You look scarlet to the world
Reaching everything through nothingness

I wear the black tunic with eternal symbol
Of father Sun embroidered
Embroidered with gold purple yarm
Secretly weaved by fairies in magical times

Your blood bath immortalizes
Immeasurable beauty

Each time you are brought by the dawn
Each time you are taken by darkness
You look scarlet to the world
Reaching everything through nothingness

Eternal light the shine of the Sun in the dawn
Unquestionable loyalty to the Gods
Secret moment the sacrifice
The blood pumps thick
And my horse lies dead upon the soil
