We will come a night when even these stars are extinguished
Darkness will prevail in your hearts
And you won't know if you are dead or alive
But we will come, bringing thousand stars, our souls
And a bloody sun, our flag!

Death cast a shadow over you
Ancient desire, but the hand is new
Beware! Beware of me!
Before we return in the night
There where the skull sings
There, we, the intrepid will return
The flags will wave again in the wind

Death cast a shadow over you

Exiled we are on the fringe
Living elsewhere, but between you
We care for today, we care for this
Out of the system
We have chosen our own way

Unrepentant obstimate
We are everywhere and nowhere
The last loyal
We who will be the first in the new world

Death cast a shadow over you
