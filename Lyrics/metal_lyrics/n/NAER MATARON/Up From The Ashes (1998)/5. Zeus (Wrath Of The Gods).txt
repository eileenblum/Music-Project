For years they were silent
Forgotten by their followers
Who forgot their ancient power
Who forgot their terrible wrath

Wake up masters of my soul
Your disciples are waiting for your call

Now Zeus has risen from Olympus
And sit on his golden throne
Aris has gathered up the hordes of doom
To regain the lost realm

Wake up masters of my soul
Your disciples are waiting for your call

Artemis slays the unfaithful
With the help of Aris lord of war
Soon all the kingdoms will be fallen
And Zeus will be the ruler of this world

Wake up masters of my soul
Your disciples are waiting for your call
