Hades, god of the underground world
Son of Kronos and Reas
The mighty king of erevos
Brother of the great Zeus

Into the darkened world
He sits on throne which is made of gold
Invisible into the clouds
With Cerberus sitting beside

With company the Katachtonium Kirres
Arpies and Erinues
And his wife the beloved queen Persefone
The collector of human souls

Judge the of the human life
Punisher of the unfair
Who nothing can save them
From your destructive revenge

You, king of the dead
I praise you as one day
I'll come at your silent kingdom
To live forever there
