From the darkest depths of Hades
As the black flame my soul burns
The dark visions is always there
To bring me (His) blasphemy

You born again, oh chosen one
To bring up their message to bring up their words

From the fire
And the rituals of our fathers
You're now born again
From the blessings of the masters

You born again, oh chosen one
To bring up their message to bring up their words
