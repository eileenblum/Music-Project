[performed by Naer Mataron]A shadow race of monstrous beings
I said to lurk somewhere between the distant hills

In the deepest woods with the highest tops
In the deepest gorge that even the wolves avoid
Let the voices of the cultists rise

From the wells of night to the bays unto the space
And from the bays of the space in to the wells of night
To the eternal glory of Cthulhu the great
Of mega Tsathogua and the One who is not allowed to be named

In the deepest woods with the highest tops
In the deepest gorge that even the wolves avoid
Let the voices of the cultists rise

To the eternal glory and abundance
Of the Black Goat of the woods with a thousand young
Listening to our invocations
Aiming with the wings of night
Beyond the space
Beyond the final gate
Roaming in the black ether, at the edge
Shocking, putrid nightmares of secrets of that are revealed
With defined status I sanctify this passage

In the deepest woods with the highest tops
In the deepest gorge that even the wolves avoid
Let the voices of the cultists rise

In the deepest woods with the highest tops
In the deepest gorge that even the wolves avoid
Let the voices of the cultists rise

The whisperer in darkness
