On a chariot with wings I move on and observe
Distant visitors, bright meteorites
Indefinite pleasures, pure tranquility
Blessed with excess, hallowed to create.

Alchemy, ancient knowledge
Magnetized by orbit bewitched by sight.
The bright light blinds my face
Between spaces, discovering unfathomed paths

Astro-Thetis-Cosmos

Around the globe of creation
Lead the source of light, reach the twelfth night.

I am Agkaios who seeks the Knowledge
I know the motion of the stars
I am the one who cuts the yarn
In a season that lavish defines life!

Ouranos, Kronos, Zeus-the Son assassins the Father
...And restores the cosmic order!
Gaia, Rea, Ira- the mother bursts
...And devours the seed of chaos, in lust!

On a chariot with wings, I move on and observe
I stand in time that defines evolution
I blow the circular move of planets.
I OWN THE FUTURE AND PAST OF COSMOS
