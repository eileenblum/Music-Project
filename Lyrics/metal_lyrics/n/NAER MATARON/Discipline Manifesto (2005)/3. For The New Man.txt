A metaphysic idealism
Is the creation of a new man
A new form of civilization
Aiming at the achievement of physical
And artistic excellence

With courage and boldness
We will overcome the past
We will evolve a new civilization
Where man shall be a wholeness

Willing to move to acts of total destruction
Even to mass murder
For âcreative destructionâ
We aspire to refine the true essence of the natural, and a human being

March of victory...
... The boldness sunray!
Fire in the battle...
... The rite of crimson dawn!
Inexpugnable the flame...
... The eons blaze!
The sun in the darkness...
... A fountain of light!!!
