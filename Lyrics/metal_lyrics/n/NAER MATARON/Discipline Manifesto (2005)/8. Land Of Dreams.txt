I draft the meaning of the word of life and history
I am the son of mother wisdom
The essence of the secrets of the mind
That mutined the folks out of oblivion
To give meaning to their ideals
And knowledge on the years of their ancestors

I am the description of history
The philosophy of existence
Throughout the word of the Heliad to the frozen Wotan
And from Edda to Zarathustra

I unite the Gods with you
I possess the secrets of religiousness
And still your fears and your vanities
I am He who crushes the truth of simple life
To instruct your Godhood and Heroism

From the sanctuaries of the forests and the temples
To the secrets of the cliffs and the birds
Resist to the lie that bolts to the woods
Envy the seed of the divine that we hide inside us

My body is myriads of black and scarlet banners
And endless runes and symbols of the land of Europa
That stole the fire from the moon
And gave it to thousands of children
As they saluted through their shadows
