[originally by Sarcofago]Behind the gates only death
Burning your mind you hear the bell
The gates are open for your entry
Light of the day turn to the darkness of hell...

Nightmare

Skull and putrid corpses
Sads and somber places
And you cry tears of blood
Because you are dead

Now you will go prown on endless night
Remembering yours blasphemes and lies
I will never give mercy to you
B ut satanas want your sinner's soul

You will never return
Never...
