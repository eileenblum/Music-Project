why many voices are heard tonight
coming from the church?
-it's time to make a call for the magus
and throw him to the pyre
-why from the city came today
bishops and messengers of the pope?
what does the inquisitor and his men
want to our little village?
-they're here to trial the magus today
-why do the villagers gather wood
what are they going to make from it?
why early in the day
the priest was carrying burning oil?
- later tonight they'll throw the magus into the pyre
for having secret ties
to satan's occult powers
-and how did the priests found out?
-they heard him shouting the day before
that he found a cure against the plague
a magus, i 'm telling you, a messenger of satan!
