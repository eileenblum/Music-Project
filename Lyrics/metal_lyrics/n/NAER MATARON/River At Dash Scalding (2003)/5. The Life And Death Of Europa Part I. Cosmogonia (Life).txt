TAAOROA, father of all Gods
Through the eternity of time
You sit inside a seashell in Skotos Aenaon
Without stars, without land, without sky
Everything is an impervious darkness

A conception brought the idea and originated growth
From growth the thought, from thought the memory
From memory the consciousness: the desires
Knowledge become fertile and produces (the) night!

SKOTOS AENAON, now God RU is being born
Cosmogenia, a breath in the void space
666, IAPETE, father of the fifth rage

Put your sperm in the womb of a warrior woman
EOSFORE, transport the festive news!

Today is being born the ovERMAN
The architect will tremble the creator (TAAOROA)
Knowledge is in the hands of PROMETHEUS

SKOTOS AENAON, now God RU is being born
Cosmogenia, a breath in the void space
666, IAPETE, father of the fifth rage
