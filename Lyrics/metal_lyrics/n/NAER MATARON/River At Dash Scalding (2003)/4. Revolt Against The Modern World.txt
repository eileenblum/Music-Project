Which is the best Glory for you
Than to be laurel crowned in battle?
But how much greater is the glory
When you conquer the field of battle
An immortal crown?

Being killed you will have the Elysian Fields
The triumphant will rule over the earth
For that rise determined war
Place at the same level of worth

Pleasure and pain!
Profit and loss!
Victory and defeat!

Be prepared for struggle you Arjuna, ancient warrior
Now it is vital time for a prime and in depth action
Until the rebirth of Europa, beyond the ruins of the world
Which will have been overthrown, and doomed?
