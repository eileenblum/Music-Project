Devastating rain is coming over me again tonight
Follow the leader back home
Endless ringing bells tell me that I should stay away from me
I can't get back home

Bring me home
Guide away
Don't leave me now
Right away
Gift me love
I fly away
I need you now
My light today

All this lights
I don't follow them, they bring me to sacred places
Leave the path!
Turn around, look how endless faces walk through you with a guilty smile

Bring me home
Guide away
Don't leave me now
Right away
Gift me love
I fly away
I need you now
My light today
