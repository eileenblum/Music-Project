Storm shatters the surface
i feel the falling of the sky
when i wake up in this morning
it was devotion i could smell

This disease will cause a purgatory in my heart
for the ones that are willing to break out
the wind is gonna catch us all
on the run

What if i feel the night?
What if i say no to life?
I feel a touching embrace when i see it dawning
a tiny shimmer of light splintered by an eyeleash

What if i canât see the light?
What if i let go all the fright?
Thereâs no given way for me to take
the longing me fades away

This disease will cause purgatory in my heart
What if i feel? I feel a touching embrace
What if i say? There is no given way

What if i feel the night?
What if i say no to life?
Liberating embrace, iâm endlessly falling
thereâs no shimmer of light splintered by an eyeleash

What if i canât see the light?
What if i let go all the fright?
Thereâs no given grace to be. Farewell!
The longing me fades away
