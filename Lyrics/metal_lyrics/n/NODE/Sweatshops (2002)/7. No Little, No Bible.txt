You and your honesty: I don't care, is not real.
Your hypocrisy is your only deal.
Crash, you're going to crash: your end now is near.
Crate, your life's a crate: I'm free, I will not change

"Rocker, obey! Transform yourself.
Obey! Believe in my spell. Obey!"
Never! I fell my end in your success.

Your gold is to much: I feel drunk.
You! You solve my pain: your money again!

"Rocker, obey! Transform yourself.
Obey! Believe in my spell. Obey!"
Never! I fell my end in your success.

Golden crisis: grave where you are dying.
Feeling business, feeling the end of art.
Obey! Remember! Obey!
Obey! Forever! Obey!
Rock!
