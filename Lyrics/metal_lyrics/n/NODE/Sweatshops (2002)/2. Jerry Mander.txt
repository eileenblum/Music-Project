Nobody, nobody, nobody can put him out of game:
an injustice for the whole world...unless...
somebody, somebody, somebody, at the risk of loosing his life,
can try to scream to him:
Just I will catch you by the arm your body feels the uselessness
"Das Kapital".
Just I will catch you by the arm your body feels the uselessness
"Das Kapital".

To call a spade a spade he is the right man in the right place,
while the middle man (J.M.), with his role completely wrong,
defends the wares he paid, he gained,
Like the bitch he bought, the bitch he sold, the bitch he thrown away!
Like the bitch he bought, the bitch he sold, the bitch he thrown away!

Are you, Jerry Mander?...
