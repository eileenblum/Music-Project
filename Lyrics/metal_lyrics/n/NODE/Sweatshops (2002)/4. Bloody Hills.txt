Constantly, to be on a war footing and to be at war with someone,
must seems to people simply a war.
But wich war? The war that people realized is a war,
because I don't know if people can understand what's war...

What is war, what is gore, what's a dead man, a genocide!?
Bright jet-fighters, no heavy tanks, tanned flyers.
The dead man thanks for what you don't believe to be a war,
but you don't see that it's a simple war.

I don't make a distinction between a fighter or a tank but is clear
That the dead man says: "Thanks for the present".
Vertical order from the bloody class of trade,
they say "war!" and many innocent guys die
'cause they have many plans, plots and fakes.
Masters that we will lock up!

What is war, what is gore, what's a dead man, a genocide!?
Bright jet-fighters, no heavy tanks, tanned flyers.
The dead man thanks for what you don't believe to be a war,
but you don't see that it's a simple war.

They want destruction, your life's sacrificed.
They want supremacy, but if you give it you will die.
Their wars that don't belong to us!
Their wars that we have never chosen!
