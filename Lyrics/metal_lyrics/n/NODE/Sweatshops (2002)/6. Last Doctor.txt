Hey man, it's a deal!
Look at your "scientific and sanctified"
equilibrium between demand and supply:
no food! Damaged goods in cover-market are unsaleable.
Are unsaleable, are disagreable, rotten products,
this smell disgusts me like your absolute ignorance,
lack of evidence, stand in fear of your end.

Send for your doctor (I'll come to you I'm last doctor).
See the last doctor (I'll come to you I'm last doctor).
Send for your doctor (I'll come to you I'm last doctor).
See the last doctor (I'll come to you I'm last doctor).

Your hell is my hate, your hell is my hate!

(He) looks at me, he bring me down inside (me)
the bound of knowledge throught the end of times.

(We're) Bleeding for fuckin' sweatshops
of damaged goods, bleeding for fuckin' kingdom.
You can't blow out the candle: strifes in every countries!
You can't blow out the candle...
No piety, no forgiveness for...
...whom did me out of my job,
there's no more sugar for the rest of their lives.
...whom did me out of my job,
there's no more sugar for the rest of their lives.

He's swimming in money (I'll come to you, I'm last doctor).
He's swimming in money (I'll come to you, I'm last doctor).
He's swimming no more.
Your hell is my hate, your hell is my hate!

(He) looks at me, he bring me down inside (me)
the bound of knowledge throught the end of times.

of damaged goods, bleeding for fuckin' kingdom.

I'll come tomorrow, I'll come tomorrow and I will be your last doctor.
I'll come tomorrow, I'll come tomorrow and you will be my last patient.
I'll come tomorrow, I'll come tomorrow and I will be your last doctor.

Why should we die for the glutton's glory?
