Go! In this time of wars, revolts and counterevolution.
When the world is hot, we feel the end of a period of exploitation.

It's the time to scream,
It's the time to shoot,
It's the time to call another revolution.

Go! We have to find a solution without their laws,
'cause everyday your name is "pain",
you're called "slave", your name is "sweat".

It's the time to scream,
It's the time to shoot,
It's the time to call another revolution.

No! Why this crime still go on, never stops?
Why we never walk against their laws,
against their wall, called "sweatshops"?

Alone, alone...you'll never win, alone.
Alone, alone...you're locked up, alone.
Alone, alone...you haven't choice...

They fought for us before...for everything they need before.
They're burned for us before...
We must remember, we haven't choice.
We have no reason to stop the show,
We can't forget the past and so...
Don't pray, don't speak, don't cry, don't scream, don't claim, don't shoot, don't play, don't
fight alone...

Go! In this time of wars, revolts and counterevolutions.
When the world is hot, we find the final solution: revolution.
