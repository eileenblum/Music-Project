Don't kill, don't die my friend.
Your prison cell is your hell.
My heart is true, I feel...you never, you never.
My life is so close to your hate.
You never were betrayed.
I always was betrayed.
Remember, remember!

They scream so hard!
They are now dying!
Remember all this time now, try if you can.
And don't speak about the past now, about our friends all died.
You never were betrayed, I'm here for you.
Remember the time I was here, for you, for whom...I know.

In your mind you know that every day is hard.
Your lost in this new world, you are apart.
The game of massive fashion is very hard.
Be careful of your weekness, you could fall, you could fall!

They scream so hard!
They are now dying!
Remember all this time now, try if you can.
And don't speak about the past now, about our friends all died.
You never were betrayed, I'm here for you.
Remember the time I was here, for you, for whom...I know.
