The rot in the abysmal fire...
To go to heaven...
Alive and paralized in the our paradise.
Paralized with fear, we trust mysticism,
mind in agony: deception.
We die of fright to fear to die.

Timeless is deadly silence
of human life that will not die.

Why in this silence must we die?
Why is it so timeless our time?
Paralized with fear, we trust mysticism,
mind in agony: deception.
We die of fright to fear to die.

It's easy talking about doing something,
but it's another thing to do it.
Death is a part of life, it doesn't care.
So never hope, nevermind, never...once again!
