Desperationâs gone out there
Nevermore I will be the next
Truth is everything I want
Never I will trust unto your talks
I understood the drift of what you said
I understand
Iâm still alone
Now I know which was my place
Listen just a word of my disgrace

Itâs just begun around me
And slowly flooded in my head
Iâm planning on our sweet death
Never so much as spoke
Today I kill

Turn around the things you said
Through Fail and Foul
This was my place

The bed is dripping on the floor
Silence is the only way for us
Desperationâs gone out there
Nevermore I will be the next

Itâs just begun around me
And slowly flooded in my head
Iâm planning on our sweet death
Never so much as spoke
Today I kill

Turn around the things you said
Through Fail and Foul
This was my place
Please, let me save you
Please understand me
