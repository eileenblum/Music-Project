Once for all
Donât call me devil
Donât force me to show
What I think about your freedom
I could hurt you all
Violence, rape, abuse, overwhelming, deception
You know well whoâs paying the price of power
Whoâs dying for

Controlling the knowledge
They donât know what you know
Abusing the violence is the better way to know
They are gonna teach you that you are loosing control
So I recommend a new crusade to win the war
To win the war

A new crusade to free the world

Come on tell us they are wrong
We are right and they are wrong
We are white and they are black
Justice, freedom versus hell

Old Nick shows
Life goes on
