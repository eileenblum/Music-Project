I close the door of my mind
Thatâs the way to refuse your soul
Before the insanity will crush my brain
And I will leave you alone

I say âGodâs will be doneâ
Thatâs my own way
Godâs will be done
I red his call on the wall
It was right in blood
His call on the wall
Device: Redrum

The little ball was rolling near the half open door
Blood falls in my head
Blood thirst around me
Red is what I saw
Behind the line of normality, thereâs no safe for me, for all
Daddy wanna cut my head
I dislike this hell, what the fuck

I say âGodâs will be doneâ
Thatâs my own way
Godâs will be done
I red his call on the wall
It was right in blood
His call on the wall
Device: Redrum

I need to hang me
To free myself, to leave this world
But I hear his call
A claustrophobic atmosphere
In this black room of a thousand
A thousand thoughts

Godâs will be done / Godâs will be done / Godâs will be done
Godâs will be done / Godâs will be done / Godâs will be done
Godâs will be done / Godâs will be done
