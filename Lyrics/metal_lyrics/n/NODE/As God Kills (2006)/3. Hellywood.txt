Watching the hallucinated vision of the world
You see the strongest army fighting for your sons
Behind the mask of a shining lie you swallow them all
We fell thatâs the right way but the battle is lost

See the real things
Do you know where?
Watch behind the screen
Do you feel this hell?

I donât mind everyday which is the way
I donât know what you say
I know my name

Before you say another fuckinâ stupid word
I see the death I see the pain I see the blood
Before you tell me thatâs the only way you know
I have to say I saw your sister on the road
Sheâs a whore

See the real things
Do you know where?
Watch behind the screen
Do you feel this hell?

I donât mind everyday which is the way
I donât know what you say
I know my name
