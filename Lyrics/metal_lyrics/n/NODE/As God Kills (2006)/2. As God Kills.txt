Innocents, bleeding through the eyes of innocence, they pray
Falling bloodless to the ground
Crushed under the feel of all the crowd
Your bombs make me smile
You destroy my enemies
Now they believe in my lies

As God Kills: in mind an illusion
In the hands the weapon-desperation
As God Kills: in mind an illusion
In my head a new war declaration

Every blessed day: cutting the heads of all the blessed son of yours
I did not taste the unfaithful blood
I pray to win this blessed Scriptureâs war
Donât tell me these lies
You donât want to spread your faith
You donât want to give me your oil

As God Kills: in mind an illusion
In the hands the weapon-desperation
As God Kills: in mind an illusion
In my head a new war declaration

As God Kills: in mind an illusion
In the hands the weapon-desperation
As God Kills: in mind an illusion
In my head a new war declaration
