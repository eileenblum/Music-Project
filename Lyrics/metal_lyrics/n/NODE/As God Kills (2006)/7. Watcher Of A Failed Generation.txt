Maybe you donât understand
I wanna live another game
Donât wanna be like you
A fuckinâ motherfucker
Before I say goodbye
Before I cross the line
Before I find you dead
I told you âbout this hell

Watcher of a failed generation
Right
Watcher of a failed generation

Maybe I donât understand
I donât feel Iâll never end
Hey man Iâm talkinâ with you
A fuckinâ motherfucker
I dislike your pose
I dislike your nose
I dislike your dose
Youâll never save my soul

Watcher of a failed generation
Right
Watcher of a failed generation
