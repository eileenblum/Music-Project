The man who spoke to me was a liar
Washing the young brain, he told me lifeâs a gift
Never ending, never ending lie
Youâll never tell the never ending crime

Truth is out
You know well
Truth is out
Itâs ringinâ in your head

I donât want your forgiveness
I donât ask for you death
I donât care about your children
I donât believe in your heaven

Truth is out
Understand me
Truth is out, you know?

Do you want to make me stupid?
Do you need my ignorance?

Truth is out
You know well
Truth is out
Itâs ringinâ in your head

I donât want your forgiveness
I donât ask for you death
I donât care about your children
I donât believe in your heaven

Truth is out
Understand me
Truth is out, you know?
