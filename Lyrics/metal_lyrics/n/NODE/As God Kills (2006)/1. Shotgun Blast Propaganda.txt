Merry Christ-Massacre
Donât forget that Iâm your preacher
I am the guilty for your fault
Today you will be the best
Today you will be the next
Today you will be the carnage

Thereâs no reason to be sad
You can bring your gun and set your freedom to kill

I wanna ransom a prisoner
You are The Elect today
Because Iâm sure youâre stronger
Than the soldiers on my movie-games
Pray the Lord and send to him my greetings
This is the best blood fest I ever planned

Thereâs no reason to be sad
You can bring your gun and set your freedom to kill

Pray the Lord before shooting
Are you looking in the eyes?
Thereâs a little baby that is dying by fear, never mind
Are you watching your teacher?
Sheâs praying the Lord like you
âCause âin God we trustâ but this time their God are you

Your freedom of Trade
My freedom of speech
The first will prevail
And Iâm guilty for him?

Behind the life, behind the death
A funny game, the shotgun blast
An easy way, the propaganda

Look into their eyes and press your trigger
Look into their eyes and press your trigger
Right!

Behind the life, behind the death
A funny game, the shotgun blast
An easy way, the propaganda
