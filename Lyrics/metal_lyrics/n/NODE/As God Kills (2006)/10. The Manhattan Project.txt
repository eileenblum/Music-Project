There was a race
A great competition
Yeah!
To be the first
Building destruction
How much time is left?
There will be a new test

The doomsday clock will strike again
U-234 carries the pain
The doomsday clock will strike again
The Final Solution

There will be the race
A free competition
Yeah!
To be the first
For the reconstruction
How much time is left?
There will be a new test

The doomsday clock will strike again
U-234 carries the pain
The doomsday clock will strike again
The Final Solution
