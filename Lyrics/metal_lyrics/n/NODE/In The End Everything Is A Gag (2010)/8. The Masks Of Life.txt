Living in a nightmare made of shadows, 
Instinct takes over, you forget your being  
You trying to remember a past time, 
You donât find a way to soothe your loneliness.

Any face is wearing a mask, every sentence hides another one 
You are devoured by the doubt that who is loving you, sooner or later will hate you. 

Taking away any kind of suffering. 
In the end everythingâs a gag 
Immutable suspicion conditions, 
You judge everything around you just to be prepared.

Any face is wearing a mask, every sentence hides another one 
You are devoured by the doubt that who is loving you, sooner or later will hate you. 
I will force you to remember the past! 
To show you which is the way! 
You are the supporter of your destiny, 
You are the creator of your illusions, 
You are the first who does not believe 
You are the author of your end. 
Any face is wearing a mask, every sentence hides another one 
You are devoured by the doubt that who is loving you, sooner or later will hate you. 
Everyone around you becomes nasty 
Any news bored you, any change deceives you, 
You Leave the world outside, itâs not my business
