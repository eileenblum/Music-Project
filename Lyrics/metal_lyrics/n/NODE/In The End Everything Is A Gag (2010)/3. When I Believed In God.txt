My mind has been guiding my emotions for too long 
my heart beats with the rhythm of the rage 
and it has reached its collapsing point way before 
when I think back to my life, the desire for revenge is always more intense.

Were the days when I believed in god 
those in which the lies were the ideals 
and the hypocrisy the wagon which led it.

I am my God, I am my Devil 
And no one can worship me except me. 
when you're alone under the weight of your pain 
no one can give you the strength to get up.

Only the eternal flame of your life will help you. 
It will feed your courage when you feel weak 
reducing to - ashes all - those who - would be 
your nemesis.

I am my God, I am my Devil 
And no one can worship me except me. 
when you're alone under the weight of your pain 
no one can give you the strength to get up.

Iâve learned to control the flame during the darkest night 
Iâve brightened that night with my suffering.

I am my God, I am my nemesis 
I can end my life when I want, 
But I hate this world too much to accept the defeat, 
the days when I believed in god 
those in which I never had the courage 
to believe in myself.
