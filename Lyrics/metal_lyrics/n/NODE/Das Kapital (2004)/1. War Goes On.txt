Time is not the cure for every kind of human mistakes
And there's no a commandment
XIXth century: the "British-Pax" was an illusion
'cause thy controlled all misery

They control, they control our voice: war goes on
They control, they control our choice: war goes on

Balcan question, under aggression
What about British-balance there?
Russian aggression, German domination
... what about crazy Italy?

They control, they control our voice: war goes on
They control, they control our choice: war goes on
War goes on, on our blood, on our broken cries
... on our fantasy, on our hands, on our little eyes

Four years to fight, four years to kill these guys
Four years to save their own economies
Four years to say: "German will pay"
The price will be another tragedy
One year to see Russian destiny
Became a new way of existence
One year to see the U.S.A. to be
A new balance of euro-system

They control, they control our voice: war goes on
They control, they control our choice: war goes on
War goes on, on our blood, on our broken cries
...on our fantasy, on our hands, on our little eyes

[Solo: D'Eramo]

Their control-point is invisible from here
Take a look behind you, they control you everyday
