Glorious victory of democracy, nothing now have to change
The French revenge is done, the "U.S.-PAX" will comes
Through dollars they have to loan for all

Now there are no more lines
Now there will be the ruin for all: 1929

1929: they've lost control
1929: the dream fall alone

Visions of misery: the western freelands of gold...
Meanwhile in Germany someone tell something strong
He knows in Italy another 'prophet of smoke'
A new idea to condemn the scapegoat

Now there are no more lines
Now there will be the ruin for all: 1929

1929: they've lost control
1929: the dream fall alone

[Solo: D'Eramo/Botti/D'Eramo/Botti]

The "west-coast" see the "east-ghost"
They need a wall to protect all
They need the outpost where now there
There is a weak... pawn: German pawn

Now there are no more lines
Now there will be the ruin for all: 1929

1929: they've lost control
1929: the dream fall alone
