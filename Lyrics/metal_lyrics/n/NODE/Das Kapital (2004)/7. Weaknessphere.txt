[J.B.:]
They want their blood
The blood of other innocents
There's no more time to hope again
Behind this war they know, nobody wins again

Blood call blood, no control, two destructions
Civil wars, nations call reconstructions
'43: Italy change direction
There's no hope, people call revolutions

[J.B.:]
They touch the freedom, they see the light
The black cross is next to die
They don't know that they are the instruments...

...to protect western lands from red "Bolshie"
Weaknessphere, now is clear, you're surrounded
Weaknessphere, uselessphere, we can tell you:
"Thanks a lot, the 'red-ghost' is our friend now"

Is our friend now
We need your division

Weaknessphere you're fall down
Weaknessphere you're alone
Weaknessfear pay your pound
Weaknessfear pay with us

Pay with us now
We need your division
Pay with us now
We need to take your control
