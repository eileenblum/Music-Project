Now you can put these dreams
Up your big fuckin' asses
The lies you tell we don't believe
These children are your soldiers
These guys follow your way
The problem is: which is the way?

You gotta one way
You give us laws
You gotta one way
You kill us

The end of century, the end of tragedy:
Begin the new dictatorship
Too much to say it kill you?
Too much to say it sucks you?
Look at this generation fucked

You gotta one way
You give us laws
You gotta one way
You kill us

Our minds (... are the new game)
They control (... in this new age)
They call (... freedom this new choice)
We gotta one way (... the new line)

Bring the illusions, take new lies again
Feel the noise that helps you die
And take your daily dose in brain
Check it out now this new way
