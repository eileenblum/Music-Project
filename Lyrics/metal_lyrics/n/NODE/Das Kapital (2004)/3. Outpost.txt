"... There's no freedom without laws
In this land there's no control..."
In the middle of Europe
Once again they got destruction
Revolts have failed....
They need to transform the weak pawn in the 'outpost'

It will be the black wall of control
It will be the black wall

A new black, red, white flag and a rearmament
Of a nation that come back...
This is the new pawn of the control
For the west coast they call free

"... There's no freedom without laws
In this pawn there's no control..."
In the middle of Europe
They pay to build a new monster
Revolts have failed...
They need the black wall, fuck the freedom:
This is 'the outpost'

It is the black cross of the new ghost. It is the black cross

This is the new ghost of control
For the west coast and its gold
These are the new lands of brutality
But they don't see all this blood

[Solo: Botti/D'Eramo]

What's wrong? We have to stop the red advance
What's wrong? We have to build the new balance
What the fuck!? The Outpost signs a new deal
What the hell!? They don't believe it, they don't believe it

It means a new war, but they don't know
This is the last one for all Europe
