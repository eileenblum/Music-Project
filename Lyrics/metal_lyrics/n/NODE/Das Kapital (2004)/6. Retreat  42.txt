The deal is broken now
The black cross is falling down
Today to die it's easy there
In Stalingrad someone wins today

Too much the enemies
Too weak the other friends (shit!)
U.S.S.R. is coming here
In '44 is in Germany

The 'East-Ghost' now is alone
And they cannot believe it
And now it's taking control
They need to stop it
