The end of the Russian tragedy
Became in 1917 here
They cried for a lot of centuries
They obtain the final victory [x2]

Rescue them! Memory...
Rescue them!
They cannot hear you
Rescue them! Memory...
Rescue them!
They cannot hear you

Why is the black cross now you best friend?
Why do you sign this new deal?
Why don't you fight them?
Why don't you see the black cross is you enemy?

Rescue them! Memory...
Rescue them!
They cannot hear you
Rescue them! Memory...
Rescue them!
They cannot hear you

Why is the black cross now you best friend?
Why do you sign this new deal?
Why don't you fight them?
Why don't you see the black cross is you enemy?

They killed the first men, they're killing Trotzkij*
They killed the first men, they kill in SpainÂ° now...
