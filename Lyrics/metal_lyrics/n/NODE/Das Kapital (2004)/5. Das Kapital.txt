Which is the way you kill 'em?
Which is the way you kill us?
Why do you need this blood now?
Why do you kill your son?
Sometimes I want you death
Another man needs your life
There is a conflict inside all our nations

Das Kapital
[J.B.:] This blood is what you are
Das Kapital
[J.B.:] Which is the god you trust?
Das Kapital
[J.B.:] This blood is what you are

They're fighting for the new lands
Is there religion or faith?
Their only god is "DK"
They've to remember...
They've to remember always
To say in this fuckin' fourties:
"You are the heroes, soldiers of our nations!"

Das Kapital
[J.B.:] This blood is what you are
Das Kapital
[J.B.:] Which is the god you trust?
