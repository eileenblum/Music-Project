Hey,
Weâre burying ourselves in the mire
Donât want to know what's going onâ¦ right now
Throwing our souls in their fire... just dying

Wan light
Cannot guide
Hail the night
Stay inside

Calm night
Avoid the light
Itâs all right

Trying to get out of nothing
Onto the soil
Attempt to fly -
Wings are smeared with oil

Wan light
Cannot guide
Hail the night
Stay inside

Calm night
Avoid the light
Itâs all right
