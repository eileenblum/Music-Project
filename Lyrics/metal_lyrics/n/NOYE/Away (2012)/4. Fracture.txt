Deaf and blind
Fed with lies
Lost their land
In the end

Inside's blooming silent obedience

That's in our eyes
Intentions are lost
Meanings are ruined
Our hopes are crossed with the confident signs
Staring at their wings
They're crossing through our skies
Bringing death gifts to those who were so

Deaf and blind
Eager to die
Lost their land
In the end

Raging greedy lust and hunger

That's in our eyes
Intentions are lost
Meanings are ruined
Our hopes are crossed with the confident signs
Staring at their wings
They're crossing through our skies
Bringing us rebirth with their fire

Deaf and blind
Lost their mind
Sold their land
In the end
