And we stopped
Cramped by the ice
No way out
Desperate tribe

Frozen sails
Broken masts
Cry my dear
Our guest is near

Under the black cold sky
We tried to keep our light
But laughing at the way we pray
This night has taken our hopes away

Resist the one who wins
Brave sallies wonât harm the beast
Waiting until all is done
Heads up
There's no help from a gun
