Pleased by the dusk. Wrapped in the silence
Deferred life. Praise the comfort
Guards are on watch. Blades in the scabbards
Wait for a cause. Cleared for action

Dim light wonât shine through this cage
Beacon is never sending signals
Isolation creates cosiness
Mind is fading
Willâs atrophied

Desolation absorbs our common sense
Cell was not intended to be home
But who cares about the difference
If warden lies - itâs an obvious price
Safe shelters should always be paid

Put on this yoke
Then bend our feeble knees
Thirst for delights
Will draw us down to the bottom
And then will leave us
Dead as stones
