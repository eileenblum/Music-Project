Here comes the fire that
Burns down grounds of our reason
Here comes the light that
Blinds the eyes of our seers

Watch the ashes
Spread into the air
Ruthless sun -
Accomplice of the insights

This is the last of my debts
I have to pay you now
I'm tearing out my maimed ego and
Throwing it into your greedy mouth

Now Iâm free from your
Rusted hooks
And in the end
I'm prepared to step into the fire

Tension is broken now
Our blood is flowing out
Our hearts are filled with pain
Skinâs being thrown off
We're slowly
Changing our name
