Alone, I awoke
With no body nor limbs
This role of the observer
Seems so lonely
For eons, Iâve watched them grow
Repeating an endless circuit
Their beauty is found
In perception of self

At least thatâs how I think of it
I simply observe without interfering

So I form this story
But for them
I feel so sorry
And yet I am envious
They look so happy

I wonder and wander
The landscape of the stars
Staying so close but never too far

Trees will bear
Many fruit if left to ripen
But time has grown
Funny after all these years
Presently, I fear
Futures will fall to repeating parts
This sensation is not easily worded
A feeling of empty
They canât cure

There are worlds
Other than this one
And one day, they may
Learn of me
But for now
They donât seem ready
So I take my leave
In search of creatures other than these
And endlessly roam this starry sea
