Living day to day
As though you'll live forever
Wasting away life
As though you'll have another
Not understanding
That what we have is a gift
No matter how we were created
We should be thankful to exist

Youâre always thinking
Of what you donât have
You really never
Appreciated what you were given

Are you afraid to accept
That death awaits
You'll realize what you
Took for granted
When you lose everything
Donât be afraid to accept
The fate we all face
Some may never know what itâs like To have anything

And yet youâre always thinking
Of what you donât have
Do you even realize
All that you have

I want more
The chant of our
Generation
Selfish minded hordes
The silence of those with nothing
Is louder than a selfish cry

Can we change at all
Or will we be trapped inside
Our never satisfied minds
And hide behind
The frivolous items that we all buy
Like a plague
Infecting newborns immediately
With human defects we find perfect

Can you describe colors
To a blind man
Can you explain parents
To an orphan
A girl in a coma
Can't feel her sisterâs touch
You cry over petty misfortunes
When you have so much
Take a step back
And see how lucky you are
Your time is running out
Faster than you know
