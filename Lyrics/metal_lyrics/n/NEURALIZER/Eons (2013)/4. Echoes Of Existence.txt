Running, hiding, fighting, thriving

Face your fears
Or youâll die here
Donât believe
That this canât be
This is real

You have been
Given a
Second life
Donât lose sight
This is your last chance

Is it wrong to feel this way
To believe this was meant for me
Knowing the suffering it has caused
This epiphany should taste bitter sweet

This growing feeling of existence
Could not have manifested in the old world
Purpose and meaning were cast aside long ago
But a life of survival has given new hope

Lying, wondering, dying, living

This is what
You wanted
If you back down, youâll forever bow

To many, this would seem like the end
And they would be deemed right
But to some, this would be so much more
The inception of something greater than before

This growing feeling of existence
Could not have manifested in the old world
Purpose and meaning were cast aside long ago
But a life of survival has given new hope

Is this what the world has become
What have I now really become
This is not what I envisioned

Will I ever come to understand
Or will I forever confuse content with comfort

This growing feeling of existence
Could not have manifested in the old world
Purpose and meaning were cast aside long ago
But a life of survival has given new hope
