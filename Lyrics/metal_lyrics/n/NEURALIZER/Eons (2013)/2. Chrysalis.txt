I respect no kings
Who do nothing for me
I'll kneel before none
And die for as many
I believe no words
From the fountain of lies

My whole being
Built in rejection of authority
What has become of divine rule
Who have we allowed to control us

The silence from the mouth of man
Is the most righteous proclamation
The silence is fleeting
Might this be our end

He doesn't create
So, he destroys
All the ends of the earth
Turned to dust in hands of man
An imminent future
From our opulent past

Brilliance is lost in translation
To those who will never understand
The meaning of it all

The silence from the mouth of man
Is the most righteous proclamation
The silence is fleeting
The end times are nigh

All progress
Is being lost in waves of forgetting
This notion
That we might be the height of the paradox

I need to believe that this is not
The best of all possible worlds

Let me create the world I want to see
Free from all forms of enmity
A world where we are one
My will be done
