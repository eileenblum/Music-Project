Strokes from a brush
The work and the artist
A dichotomy to separate us
Until we can create on our own

Our greatest flaw
Not seeing what matters most
Not believing what weâre told
Until we see the whole

To create is to give of oneâs self
To empty in hopes of touching another
But is hope enough
When there is no certainty
Is fear enough to feed a passion

And we'll be one soon
Unite and make whole

We are the gallery
We are the work and the art
When we can create on our own
There is no dichotomy

Unite to be whole
Destroy to make whole
A dichotomy with the same outcome
Do I truly have a choice

To find inspiration
Leads us for only so long
If we lose sight
Dreams are lost in progress
