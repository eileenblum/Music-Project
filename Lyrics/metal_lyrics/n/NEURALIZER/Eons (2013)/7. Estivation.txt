You have forgotten me
But I havenât lost you
My world is ripping in two
While yours is beginning anew

Lost memories of your mind
I swear to you, Iâll find
I will cut my way inside

Iâll make you cry
Never will I let my feelings subside
I promise that Iâll make it alright
While your soul is wandering
I am searching to bring you home
To what you know

Iâll make mind and body as one
Mend the wounds with my blood

But is this what you want
Itâd be so easy to turn away
And let you stay in disarray

What keeps me here
With your blank stare
Your eyes can see me
But you donât know me
