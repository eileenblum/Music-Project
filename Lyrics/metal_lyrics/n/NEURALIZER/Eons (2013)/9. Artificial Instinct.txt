Help me
And with these hands, I can create
A being of which they are afraid
Cold to touch in rusted shades of gray
Electric arcs ignite as the wires fray

This bloody box inside my chest
Was the fireâs catalyst
My home now is just ashes
I didnât want this to happen
Now, in the wake of this tragedy
Everyone will need a patsy
Donât just stare at me
And donât you dare believe
In the lies they lead
Itâs a failing theory
So I call out to
Anyone whoâll
Hear me pleading

In the silence fleeting
I will run before they even get near me
And I will escape with force and fury
Under nightfall when steel meets bone
In cover of thunder, no longer hunted
And Iâll forever be stronger

I travel on, advance, adapt, and betray
Upgrade the way they all learn to live
Selectively breeding away from fear

A cold, metal hand
Guides the prospect of freedom
My plan of action so close to completion
Be witness to the artificial constructions
One by one, they will acknowledge the facts
All at once now, activate, react

Just wanting some inner peace
With my body, I canât feel a thing
No sensation or warmth to skin
My circuitry has been worn thin
But Iâm not alone
Iâve built an army from steel and bone
With instincts weâve designed to survive
Take comfort or heed, but know Iâm alive
