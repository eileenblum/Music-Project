Crawl deep within depths
What will you see, if anything

On hands and knees
Shifting rocks behind
Trudging on with stubborn dreams
Claustrophobia setting in
Shove the sides out
Your chest, now tearing from within

Hyperventilation, fear
But that's not why you're here
You didn't come to see how far
But to find something new
Something far from it all

And now you question them
The what ifs scour your confidence
This is a black hole, but no dead end
You took the risk, now finish it

You strived to better yourself
Where greed is the only name for it
This was never about superiority
But growth
Sprouting life and planting hope

Where can you go
When all has been explored
The details of everything
Deconstructed into raw data
The meaning, the beauty
Stripped when put in words
Every book, every article
The incomprehensible mapped out

What room is there to dream
When art is just a combination
Of colors and shades
Where poetry Is just
One character after the other
It seems so meaningless

So you left it all
Ventured from the light
Your eyes rendered useless
All smells combine
Senses fail
Your only drive Is for beginning anew
Risking death for what could be nothing

Some say you're glory personified
Others hope you rot in ignorance
Just keep your eyes straight
Away from light, from known life

Just remember one thing
You're reaching the end
Where you will find salvation
