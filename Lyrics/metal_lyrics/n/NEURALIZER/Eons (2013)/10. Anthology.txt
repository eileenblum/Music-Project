No more, no more
No more days of constant wondering
If this will ever get better

Maybe it will Maybe it won't
How will you know if you don't try
To work from new perspectives
Gathering insight to combat the darkness
Of waking every day to sunlight
And reminders of how things are right now
But know that things can always change
Just take a breath
Take a breath, take a breath and

Breathe in
Tomorrow's rising
Can you feel it
Can you breathe yet
Can you see the dust
Floating through the air
Drifting in legions
Not a single care
Pretty, but pointless
And now you realize
That time is drawing near
Soon, you'll wake and soon, you'll hear
The first words
Of your tomorrow
Starting today

One day, these words won't mean a thing
You will forget the content
But none of the feeling
None of the meaning
Of what it is to break free
You will remember the way it felt
Knowing that everything will be ok

Everything will be ok
Everything will be ok

Fears will come and go
We'll all be scared again
Our bodies will crumble and rebuild
There's scars to keep and wounds to heal

And don't you believe for a second
That you cannot handle it
You are stronger than you will ever admit
Stronger than you'd ever know
And everything that tears you down
Builds you up again
Better than before
Better than yesterday
What more could you ask for
That is all you'll ever need

Just take a moment
To enjoy the night
Take in the moonlight
Nestle in the silence
Take a moment
To breathe in deep
And for that moment
Forget that you exist
Appreciate the life around you
This is what life is like
Knowing that you're free

And you can always be free of this

Wondering if you will ever be the same
Should be of no concern
You're better now

So, understand

Fears will come and go
We'll all be scared again
Our bodies will crumble and rebuild
There's scars to keep and wounds to heal

But I know
How hard it is
To believe that
It's all true
That everything could sway your way
And make it seem ok
That everything which happened
Could be put aside
To clear a way for a new path
Absent aftermath
But it could happen to you
And it's okay to feel helpless
To feel lost
To feel

And if you forget, I will remind you

Fears will come and go
We'll all be scared again
Our bodies will crumble and rebuild
There's scars to keep and wounds to heal

Remember, remember
Everything will be ok
