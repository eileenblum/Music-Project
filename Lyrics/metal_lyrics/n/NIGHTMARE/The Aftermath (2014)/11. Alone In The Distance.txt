Our life goes on in the distance
It's heavy like chains of steel
I feel we loose our existence
Maybe now we pay the bill?
Our secrets day by day
Have nothing more to say
A dangerous game that we play
At miles away

Our love will carry on
And we can't stop our feelings
A vision's moving on
On all the things we're sharing
Our love will carry on
And we can't stop our feelings
A vision's moving on
On all the things we've shared

Don't turn your back on me
This is our destiny
My heart is calling out
It's what I shout!

A vision's moving on
And we can't stop our feelings
Our love will carry on, oohh carry on...
A vision's moving on
On all the things we've shared

I am the beat of your pulse
I can't hide what I know
Our fates are upon us
There's more in me that what it shows

Our love will carry on
A vision's moving on
And we can't stop our feelings
Our love will carry on
A vision's moving on
On things we've shared

Our love will carry on!
