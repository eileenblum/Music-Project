Forever and ever...

The earth has no existence
It's full of shadows
A whisper of subsistence
Hides there so long ago
The eye of the beholder
Is watching over me
Cause I'm the true survivor
Of our destiny

I am immortal
I sail across the skies
At the nearest from the eagles
I am immortal
I sail across the skies
At the nearest from the eagles

How can I know who's alive
Under the moonlight?
I can't close my eyes to survive
Something is still alive
I feel his breathing so hard
What is behind me?
Trying to escape of that
Angel of mercy

I am immortal
I sail across the skies
At the nearest from the eagles
I am immortal
I sail across the skies
At the nearest from the eagles...
