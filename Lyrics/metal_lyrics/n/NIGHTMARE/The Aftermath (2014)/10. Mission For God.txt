Legions of the anarchists
Are spreading the disease
Where targets for the terrorists that noone sees
Children full of explosives
Are waiting for their task
Nothing to identify behind this deadly mask

Pleading absolution
Terror on the nations
Is this the only way to find the truth?
Another execution to continue the fight
Any sacrifice whatever the price

Anger... and hatred...
(This is fucking war... There's no place to go)

Soldiers of silence
Follow the message of your god
In the spiral of violence
It's another mission... With no code!

All the world is paralyzed
Awaiting for a blast
There will be no compromise
They would be the last
Masters of delusions
Ages of confusions
Leaders of the world
Are on their knees

Anger... And hatred...
(This is fucking war... there's no place to go)

Soldiers of silence
Follow the message of your god
In the spiral of violence
It's another mission... For god! For god!

(This is fucking war... There's no place to go)
Anger... And hatred...

Soldiers of silence
Follow the message of your god
In the spiral of violence
It's another mission...
