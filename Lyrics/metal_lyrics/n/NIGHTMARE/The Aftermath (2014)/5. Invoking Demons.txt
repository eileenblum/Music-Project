I see the planet crumbling down
Feelings of rage are coming to me
How can we stop this mayhem around
This fall to darkness of immorality?
Nations fake a debate
While strangers are controlling our fate
Hellfire's drawing nigh
Betrayers are the symbol of hate

Can't breathe, I'm choking on venom
Malice and no religion
Shall we, give up the hope
And start invoking demons?

I feel a disaster that noone knows
They spread the curse, affliction and fears
I know this life is full of sorrows
The triple six now will appear

I can't breathe, I'm choking on venom
Malice and no religion
Shall we, give up the hope
And start invoking demons?
Shall we, give up the hope
And start invoking demons?

I can't breathe, I'm choking on venom
Malice and no religion
Shall we, give up the hope
Should I believe in evil
And start invoking, demons?
