Do you understand
That your chance is gone
Alone in your madness
You're spiting on the cross
Locked into your lies
Awaiting for the dawn
Living in disgrace
You run to your loss

If you don't take my hand
Your towers will fall
I am your only friend
Can you hear my call?
Just give me a sign
And you'll see the light
Now you're not alone
In your danger zone

You're going anywhere
Necromancer

Fall into the sky
Across the walls of fire
Necromancer
Fall into the sky
Across the walls of fire
Necromancer

Your memories rush back
And you'll be born again
If you don't loose the track
In this dark crazy game
Look inside the eye
Of death and its might
You have to realize
There is no peace of mind

You're going anywhere
Necromancer

Fall into the sky
Across the walls of fire
Necromancer...
