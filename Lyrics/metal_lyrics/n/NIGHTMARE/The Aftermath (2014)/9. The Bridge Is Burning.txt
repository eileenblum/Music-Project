Will I see the light? (Is it my temptation?)
Is there a sunset for tomorrow?
(A sunset for salvation)
Am I out of sight?
I feel the shivers cold and our sorrow
(The shivers cold...)
Will I see the light? Is it a sacrifice or a chance?

So I know that your world is going to burn
From now there will be no return
Ohh I don't know who I am, the story's over
Revenge is always so much sweeter
As you burn in the fire
Taking my dreams
Trying to hide all your sins
You're just a disaster
Consuming my mind
How could I've been so blind?

As a fallen angel
And I will never never fail, fail again!
In my resurrection... Oohh, I'll find the answer
And draw the line over the past
In my resurrection...
And I'll draw, and I'll draw the line over the past

Now you're calling out my name
It's easy to blame
I don't understand you're a shame
You're just a whoremaster
Killing me inside
How could I've been so blind?

As a fallen angel
And I will never never fail, fail again!
In my resurrection... oohh I'll find the answer
And draw the line over the past
In my resurrection...
And I will draw, and I'll draw the line over the past...
(I feel the shivers cold...)...
