"The spirit will never die..."

They hail the mountains
They ride the storm
And stare us from the skies
Indians in their domains
Are like a swarm
Of crazy lullabies

When they're out in the plains
There, you'd better beware
Cause they've broken their chains
Noone really cares

Into the lair of the forbidden tribe
Wisdom is much stronger than our lies
So many tears that they ever cry
And their spirit will never die

What brings them down?
With white men's greed
Their wounds are open wide
They must be strong
Their nations bleed
More than meets the eye

When they're out in the plains
There, you'd better beware
Cause they've broken their chains
Noone really cares

Into the lair of the forbidden tribe
Wisdom is much stronger than our lies
So many tears that they ever cry
And their spirit will never die...

Into the lair of the forbidden tribe
Wisdom is much stronger than our lies
So many tears that they ever cry
And their spirit will never die
Their spirit will never die!
