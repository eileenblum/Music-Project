I walk away from my reflection
And I feel I couldn't hide a tear
I look in the mirror for a direction
But my destination is unclear
Am I a monster
A demon in the ruins
Lost in the corridors of time and space?
Am I just a shadow of a human being?
I can't see myself, this is not my face!

Melting together
Attracted by the void of darkness
Reflecting together
In a mirror that is black
Melting together
Driven forth into that blackness
Reflecting together now!

I live in the dark again
I'm a ghost in the mirror
I live in the dark again
I'm a ghost in the mirror of my life
I live in the dark again
I'm a ghost in the mirror
I live in the dark again
Ghost in the mirror, in the mirror!

I'm dying in the dust of my illusions
My freezing emotions wake my fear
This looking glass is all my isolation
All I want is just to get out of here

Melting together
Attracted by the void of darkness
Reflecting together
In a mirror that is black
Melting together
Driven forth into that blackness
Reflecting together now!

I live in the dark again
I'm a ghost in the mirror
I live in the dark again
I'm a ghost in the mirror of my life
I live in the dark in the mirror...
