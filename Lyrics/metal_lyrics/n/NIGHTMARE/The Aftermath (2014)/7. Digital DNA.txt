The machine takes control
Trying to make us fall
We live in a fantasy
Of a cyber reality

Brave the fire!
Face the void!
Ready to dive!
Into megabytes
All the liars
Fill the lines
And change the code
Of your DNA

We've been too far to come back now
It's not an illusion
And it's too late to change the course
Of this mutation

The machines never speak
The world is too much weak
It's just a contamination
Of a blind generation

Cure the cancer!
Face the void!
Ready to die
For those megabytes
See the vortex!
End of a time!
Do we have to change our way of life?

We've been too far to come back now
It's not an illusion
And it's too late to change the course
Of this mutation

We've been too far to come back now
It's not an illusion
And it's too late to change the course
We've been too far to come back now
It's not an illusion
And it's too late to change the course
Of our extinction
