Something in the air
Loom as a threat
I should prepare myself to kill

Black birds in the sky
Seem like dark omens
Should I fight the fears I feel?

Inside my heart there is no faith
My only reason is the fear
The dying world goes away
The final days are growing near

Hiding like a rat
Waiting for the upcoming madness
Just after the blast
The future falls in eternal darkness

The world collapses
There is no protection
Bloody mantle waves as a banner
Transmission failures
Incomunication
Everyone is on his own

Life outside is only pain
Death in eyes is so unreal
Nobody knows who starts the game
Itâs time to make the devilâs deal

Hiding like a rat
Waiting for the upcoming madness
Just after the blast
The future falls in eternal darkness
