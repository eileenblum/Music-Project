We are the war force in command
That protects the nation
From the evil minds from out on this cold war
Receive your orders and intrude be a spy and kill
You have to lose your feelings or
You will die for sure

That life weâve chosen
Without repentance
We enjoy to feel the rush

To move in the night
And sabotage their minds
Soot down their satellites
And make their systems crash

At night!

We infiltrate our forces
Into their nuclear weapons sector
To steal information
To control this state of war
No time to make mistakes, no time to hesitate
Evade their security systems
And dynamite their power code

There are no betrayers
We keep our honor codes
And need no cowards here
