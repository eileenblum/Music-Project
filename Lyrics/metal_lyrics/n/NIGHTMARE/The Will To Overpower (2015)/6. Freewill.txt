Day after day he has broken his back
Without a just reward
Making efforts to find the way
To survive his own war

But now that man is tired
Starting now heâs gonna break the chains

Running free, running free!
Heâs gonna live his dreams
Running wild, running wild
Heâs living on the road

Years of frustration have been left behind
Now he is feeling free
Nobody cares if heâ is a simple man
Among the ones youâre used to seeing

But today the man is stronger
Itâs no easy, but is what it should be

Running free, running free!
Heâs searching for his dreams
Living fast, living fast!
And playing rockâ nâ roll

Right now his band is here
Tonight the stage is going to explode

Running free, running free!
The spotlightâs shine on you
Running wild, running wild!
Heâs living on freewill

Running free!
And playing rockâ nâ roll!
