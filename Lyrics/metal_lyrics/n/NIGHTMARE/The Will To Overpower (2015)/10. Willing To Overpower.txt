Iâve realized today
Iâve been down and out for long
Itâs time to stand and fight
The tyrants who control
The world will tremble when I scream
The enslaved ones is my name
And my willing is conviction

Extinction is the future of their kingdom
Their idols and their laws will fall apart

Iâm willing to overpower
They thought would never strike back
Their money will not seduce me
With sword in hand my frantic legions go
Of their throat and their blood
Tonight

Hunger, pain and scorn
Are the marks they left on me
Many times my wretched sons
Have felt the cracking of their whips
But now the hammer of the masses
Is coming down on them
My chains will break
And all my souls will be free from these cells

Extinction is the future of their kingdom
Their idols and their laws will fall apart

Iâm willing to overpower
They thought would never strike back
Their money will not seduce me
With sword in hand my frantic legions go
Of their throat
