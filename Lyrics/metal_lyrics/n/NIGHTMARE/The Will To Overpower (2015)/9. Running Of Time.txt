You know, you're young and
you've got the life before you
it's easy, the world is in your hands
one day the mirror
reveals a stranger in front of you

Time in your hands runs away
are you feeling the pain you didn't feel before?
time in your hands goes away
you have some scars in your heart
and some time it hurts

the days are shorter and
you run to reach the sun
the time goes on and
it's running faster than you
the book is older,
But it bring new pages written by you

Time in your hands runs away
are you feeling the pain you didn't feel before?
time in your hands goes away
you have some scars in your heart
and some time it hurts inside

Do you think the moments of happiness
have been worthwhile?
or these have been a life's trap
to keep you captive?

Time in your hands runs away
are you feeling the pain you didn't feel before?
time in your hands goes away
you have some scars in your heart
and some time it hurts
