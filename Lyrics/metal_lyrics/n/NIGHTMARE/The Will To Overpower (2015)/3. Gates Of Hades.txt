Victim of fate, I fell down to the
river of death, wishing revenge,
'cause my enemies sent me to hell.

Here in the unknown
I can't feel anything anymore
And a heart that doesn't beat
is calling for me from the depths.

[Chorus:]
At the gates of Hades
My soul starts to crawl
At the gates of Hades
My soul starts to burn

Picking up blood of the timeless
That I've been nowhere
an outbreak of souls I see fall
to the depths of the Styx

Here in the unknown
my thoughts stop to flow
and a heart that doesn't beat
is calling for me from the depths
