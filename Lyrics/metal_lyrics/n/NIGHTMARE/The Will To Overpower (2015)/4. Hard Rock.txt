I know you hear the calling
Itâs like our destination
Youâve felt this trapped desire
That now rises from inside
Itâs magic, itâs fire
Take a ride on the wind tonight
Stone gods are voiceless now
And youâre man enough to take command

I want to hear the tune you always play
I need you here to play

Play it hard! Play it loud!
Rock tonight!
Hard rock
Power is burning and running wild

High voltage guitar riffing
Then an endless rolling thunder
The walls shake as the amps are roaring
Itâs the best when theyâre loud as hell
Itâs magic, itâs fire
Rule the world as a king tonight!
Iron chains are broken now
And nothing stops you to take command
