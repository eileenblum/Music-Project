Theyâre riding free on through the highway
See their motorcycles full of black and chrome
A peaceful evening on a peaceful town
But when the band gets here the metal show will star

Beware of the flames
They ride on night
They ride on tonight
Thereâs no bounds
To the speed
Of their fire horses along the highway

Hell child!
Ride the fire
Break our chains
And take us higher!

They made us free and wild
With their music of madness we awaken
When rock and roll power was brought to my ears
I started to burn and shout

Beware of the flames
They ride on night
They ride on tonight
Thereâs no bounds
To the speed
Of their fire horses along the highway

Hell child!
Ride the fire
Break our chains
And take us higher!
