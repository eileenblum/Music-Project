I feel their energy and every time that I look at them
My soul fills with fire when I listen to the evil chants.

Now I watch their hands rising with my power
Because I give them force
So that they sing with me and make my soul
Burn in the flames of hell.

Living a dream of a rocking man
Whwn singing we're burning in the infernal songs
Rising your hands, screaming so loud
To give me your power and make me strong.

Angels of darkness
Sing with me this song
Let me hear your voices
To feel all your might.

Spread your wings
Angels of mine and take me high again
Drink my blood and teach me
There are not boundaries anymore.

Now I watch their hands rising with my power
Because I give them force
So that they sing with me and make my soul
Burn in the flames of hell.

Angels of darkness
Sing with me this song
Let me hear your voices
To feel all your might.

Angels of darkness
Sing with me this song
Let me hear your voices
To feel all your might.
