I know the night is done
And your game goes on since long ago
I kept promises but you were
Always breaking laws
Mistreating my mind
You teach me it's not worth
Expecting love from you
Expecting lies from you.

The time is right 'cause I'am strong
I ain't the loser anymore
Night after night I've lost my dreams
You'd better get away.

Out of love, I'm out, out of love!!!

I've paid the price for being fool
For being blind
Now, I'm deaf to your lies
I'm heart of stone out of love
You used to have charm
You've lost your touch
You're out of my heart
Now, I'm alone in my way
To live my life as I want.

The time is right 'cause I'am strong
I ain't the loser anymore
Night after night I've lost my dreams
You'd better get away.

Out of love, I'm out, out of love!!!

The time is right 'cause I'am strong
I ain't the loser anymore
Night after night I've lost my dreams
You'd better get away.
