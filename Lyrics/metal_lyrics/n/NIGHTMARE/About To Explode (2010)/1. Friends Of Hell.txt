I've known some strange guys
They seem to be like you and me
But they've sold their souls to hell
And now they're friends under disguise.

They will make their rites with blood of the dead
They will invoke our doom as the devil's laugh.

Friends of hell they deal with Satan at night
When the sacrifice's done
The ancient ones will be summoned.

This is an evil game they're going to play till the end
No matter if they're sentenced to burn below
Envenomed are their minds and hearts.

Black magic symbols drawn to call the demon lord
Like zombies they will dance around the pentagram

Friends of hell 
Drink the blood of the dead
And deal with Satan at night
When the sacrifice's done 
Drink the blood of the dead
The ancient ones will be summoned.

They will make their rites with blood of the dead
They will invoke our doom as the devil's laugh.

Friends of hell drink the blood of the dead
And deal with Satan at night
When the sacrifice's done 
Drink the blood of the dead
The ancient ones will be summoned.
