A rain of fire is falling from the sky
All that you can see around are flames
The screams of fright are silenced by thunderbirds
The city is burning in raging flames.

The war machines ride on the wind
Black angels spits death.
Women, children and men
Made of sun, wind and sand...
...Will take their last breath.

Total storm consumes your bones
All is dust, blood and ashes
One thousand souls burn in fire
The Satan's army attacks tonight.

The world's not only witness of their force
But witness of their lies
It will be written all about this war
Where they were savior angels of good
But someone else will tell the truth.

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
The evil forces will kill them all tonight
The winged demons have no mercy of your cries.

Now, they are waiting for the moment
To rip the sand and suck its black blood.

The war machines ride on the wind
Black angels spits death.
Women, children and men
Made of sun, wind and sand...
...Will take their last breath.

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
The evil forces will kill them all tonight
The winged demons have no mercy of your cries.
