Tired of this chains in my life
On the run is how I want to be
I've shouted to the storm
I've walked against the wind
Freedom is my belief.

From this jail I'll be set free
My blood is T.N.T.
The world will know I'm here
Alive, hot and mean.

The time has come to go over the walls
'cause I'm about, I'm about to explode.
The time has come to go over the walls
'cause I'm about, I'm about to explode.

The oppressors of the law are after me
For the power of my youth
But they all are bound to lose
Their time is running out
No chains can hold me down
Like a lion in a cage is how I feel (tonight).

The time has come to go over the walls
'cause I'm about, I'm about to explode.
The time has come to go over the walls
'cause I'm about, I'm about to explode.

The time has come to go over the walls
'cause I'm about, I'm about to explode.
The time has come to go over the walls
'cause I'm about, I'm about to explode.
