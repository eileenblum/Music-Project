Enclosed in your own wall of fear
You thing you had fallen
The sadness and the shame that you feel
Make bigger the wall.

Praying to heaven that is now against you
Pointing out to you
Mercy confess and regret and then maybe
Your demons will be gone.

Remember innocent child
The oath that you made
You promised to always be good
The lie was just said.

Praying to heaven that is now against 
You pointing out to you
Hunger, the knife in your hand needs another one 
Who spread his blood to you.

They're offering to wash you're conscience
With a single bunch of prayers
But there's too much death in your hands
And you know that it won't be enough.

Praying to heaven that is now against you
Pointing out to you
Mercy confess and regret and then maybe
Your demons will be gone.
