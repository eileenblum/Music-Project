Late at night at the new local bar
We're gonna be there 
Everyone will rock there
The sound there is raw, the sound there is loud
So, Rock and drink 'till the morning comes.

There's fire there, there's madness there
See the banging heads tonight
Girls and boys in leather and studs
Gone wild in trance.

Leather, studs and Rock and Roll
Ask the D.J. for Heavy Metal
Feel the power 
Lose control.

Feel the blow of the Rock and Roll sound
With our favorite bands, we lose control
Got no time for hanging around
Our burning hearts want action tonight.

There's fire there, there's madness there
See the banging heads tonight
Girls and boys in leather and studs
Gone wild in trance.

Leather, studs and Rock and Roll
Ask the D.J. for Heavy Metal
Feel the power 
Lose control.

Those who thought we were down
And out are gonna know we will take control
So bang your heads and fists against the wall
Looking rough and mean we're the lords of the night.

Leather, studs and Rock and Roll
Ask the D.J. for Heavy Metal
Feel the power 
Lose control.
