Taking over through the land
We've got the power
Descending troopers from the sky
We spit fire
Our guns are blazing in the fields
The enemy shall die
They will be gone to burn in hell
And now we've got their land.

We spread our wings into the night
So there's no way to fight us back
The target is waiting for our attack
We'll fight like hell for glory's arms.

The lords of war, they fill our hearts
With hate from hell
In rebel lands, now wastelands
Burnt to the ground
The prisioners of war, our slaves
They claim for mercy
The other tribes we reign as kings
But the war is endless.

We spread our wings into the night
So there's no way to fight us back
The target is waiting for our attack
We'll fight like hell for glory's arms.
