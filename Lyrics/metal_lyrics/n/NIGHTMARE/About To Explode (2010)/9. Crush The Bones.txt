War is here
Death is comin' in 46 tons of iron
You're hiding in the trench
Waiting for the moment to start to fire
The cold of humid mud added to fear
Paralyzed your mind
Wishing run or wishing fight your basic instincts
You don't wanna die.

While you pray your last prayer 
and regret the things you never did
Hear the wheels of the killing machine
The jagopanther was made to kill.

And crush the bones, and crush your bones.

And crush the bones, and crush your bones.
