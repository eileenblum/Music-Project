A day of 1999, an angel came on your way
A power staring the light, entered your mind at the end of the day
You're walking on the other side, when you reach the end of the dream
You feel a whisper in your heart, it's the sign of a new beginning
You stand alone in the dark, the master is calling your name
Sinner you know who you are, but in fact you're not to blame
Look in the eyes of the stars, the world has nothing to say
In the heavens you are so far, another spy on the highway

Somewhere fly a glory knight
Somewhere in the skies...in the skies...

Remember when you paid the price, when the poison was feeding your veins
You'd lost the forces to fight, when you saw the rules of the games
You told us once in a lifetime, that you were dying again
And now you can understand, the needles killing your brain

Somewhere fly a glory knight
Somewhere in the skies...in the skies...

He's a legend alive...

You were no more than a child, when your life began to burn
You were following the line, but you had nothing to learn
You stand alone in the dark, but it's too late too break the chains
See God wake up and fight, now it's the time to keep the flame

Somewhere fly a glory knight
Somewhere in the skies...in the skies...
