Don't you see, the visions of another world
In a time you must provide the future
Don't you hear confusions into their words
Everywhere you go, you're feeling like a sinner

Too late, politicians rule the lands
To take you to their power games
Too late, politicians rule the lands
To take you to their power games

Preachers, howlers of insanity
Dreamers, rulers of the century

Don't you see, the desolations will survive
Tears and pain will always be the winners
Don't you think your life is not a paradise
Everywhere you go, you'll never cross the borders

Too late, politicians rule the lands
To take you to their power games
Too late, politicians rule the lands
To take you to their power games

Preachers, howlers of insanity
Dreamers, rulers of the century
Preachers, howlers of insanity
Leaders, controlling your destiny...
