I'm working at the school of life
Living in a space without any chains
You'll never face my distant eyes
And my heart is getting cold, I can't explain

Don't you understand that I'll rise again
Into a spirit which calls my name

Heart of fire
Deep inside my chest
Heart of fire
Believe in my quest

Heart...reveal my medications
Fire... recall my revelations

I'm walking on the edge of time
Living in a circle without any chains
I am the victim of mankind
But I will never stand out in the rain

Don't you understand that I'll rise again
Into a spirit which calls my name

Heart...reveal my medications
Fire... recall my revelations

Heart of fire
Fire... fire...
