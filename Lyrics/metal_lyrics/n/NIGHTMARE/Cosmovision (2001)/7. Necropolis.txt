Somewhere in the desert storm, a temple rises from the sands
The relic on each walls, tells the writings of this lands
On the west Nile riverside, the Re child deals his legacy
At the expense of their  lifes, slaves are marching on their knees

[Pre-Chorus]
The shadows of the sphinx
Are the keepers of a kingdom shining
The symbols of the kings
Are the sign of a empire falling

[Chorus]
Temples of Necropolis
Awaiting for sign, asign of Osiris...

A nation of strangers, is the victim of slavery
For the glory of master, slaves are dying in their misery
The remains and the scribes, are the treasures of humanity
And the tyrants of the past, are raging for eternety

[Pre-Chorus]
The shadows of the sphinx
Are the keepers of a kingdom shining
The symbols of the kings
Are the sign of a empire falling

[Chorus]
Temples of Necropolis
Awaiting for sign, asign of Osiris...
