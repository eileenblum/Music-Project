Fly away in the brain, spiral... Madnes...

I never know when the need is calling
Another pile to face, it's time to leave again
Stand at the door, it's a new beginning
Just another state, that you can't understand

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm lost inside somewhere, in the stairs
It is the tolling of the judgement bell

[Chorus]
Fly away
Fly away inside my brain
In the spiral of madness...

I tried to break the walls of silence
Eradicate the voice, it's driving me insane
I always try to take the distance
Rounding-up again, the will that makes me stand

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm lost inside somewhere, in the stairs
It is the tolling of the judgement bell

[Chorus]
Fly away
Fly away inside my brain
In the spiral of madness...
