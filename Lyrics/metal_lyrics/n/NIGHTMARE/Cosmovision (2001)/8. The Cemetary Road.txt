Listen to the tales of the old man's fears
About this distant place
Don't you know the spell, it's comming near
You fall into disgrace
Time has spread the ashes of the dead
In this sanctuary
And the power of the shadows never dies
And disappears

[Chorus]
And it's dangerous to stay, so run away
Don't let your children play
And it's dangerous to stay
You'd better run away
Don't let your children play

[Post-Chorus]
On the cemetary road...

Nineteen sixty four, you`ve lost your child
Was this the end ?
Your pushed the doors of this
Forbbiden site
It's your final stand
You tried to rise your son from the dead
But the devil said
" I entered his mind to rise again "

[Chorus]
And it's dangerous to stay, so run away
Don't let your children play
And it's dangerous to stay
You'd better run away
Don't let your children play

[Post-Chorus]
On the cemetary road...
