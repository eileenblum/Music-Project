There's a little town in Carolina, where black ravens spread the fear
When clouds blacken the skies, no gleam to guide your eyes
There's a mourning in this town, a soul never been found

[Chorus]
Break out! There's no time to waste
In the deepest of the dark
Break out! And hold your breath
When the priest is back
In the church, his haunted church

The stoty tells that in moonlight, they've made a sacrifice
When the phantoms of the past, return to guide your eyes
There's a cold chill in the air, a feeling of despair

[Chorus]
Break out! There's no time to waste
In the deepest of the dark
Break out! And hold your breath
When the priest is back
In the church, his haunted church

Once upon a timein Carolina, avil visions strike again
The danger lies in every sight, many nightmares catch the night
The deadly silence break the fury, the priest is back for eternety

[Chorus]
Break out! There's no time to waste
In the deepest of the dark
Break out! And hold your breath
When the priest is back
In the church, his haunted church
