You walk alone when the night cold
Searching her face in the falling rain
You talk to shadows in a final course
You have a mission that you can't explain

She knows...
When the skies are changing colours
She is...
The victim of a dream

[Chorus]
Searching...
The lonely faces in the dark
Feeling plasure, to kill for him
Searching... the lonely places in the dark
Feeling pleasure, to kill for him

You sign the end of your desperate fall
And sell your soul to this screen
Marching alone under no control
And you'll believe that you'll reach your dreams

Midnight...
You're standing on the edge of time
Riding...
A mission you can't feel

[Chorus]
Searching...
The lonely faces in the dark
Feeling plasure, to kill for him
Searching... the lonely places in the dark
Feeling pleasure, to kill for him
