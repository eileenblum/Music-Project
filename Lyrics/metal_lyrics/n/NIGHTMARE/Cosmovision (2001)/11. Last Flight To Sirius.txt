Black is the season in the kingdom
Time has come to slide the paradise
Dark is the reason of wishdom
Riding a nation where you can rise
For centuries, you led your disciples
For not sinking, into oblivion
In blood, you're filling up your legions

[Pre-Chorus]
In the chaos  braving the storm, gathering the chosen ones
They are praying for salvation, there is no return
Don't feedus with your promises, don't whisper no more lies

[Chorus]
Somewhere on a distant shore
You fly... to Sirius
Somewhere on a distant shore
You die... in last flight...

You enter a void that never ends
Hiding your crimes, you will dominate
Calling the lord of a promised land
The realm of lies, you will celebrate
You say you take, the crusader's ride
Crossing the gates of perversion
You dream alone of domination

[Pre-Chorus]
In the chaos  braving the storm, gathering the chosen ones
They are praying for salvation, there is no return
Don't feedus with your promises, don't whisper no more lies

[Chorus]
Somewhere on a distant shore
You fly... to Sirius
Somewhere on a distant shore
You die... in last flight...
