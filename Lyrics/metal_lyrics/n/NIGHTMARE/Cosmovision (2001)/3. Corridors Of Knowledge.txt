I enter the computer's mind, the power of my senses
And I feel the orders are mine, as I know my science is endless
I'm loading my datas in the files, to control the means of this age
I've passed around and hypnotized, the data code of their cells

[Chorus]
I stand alone
In the corridors of knowledge
I seat the walls
To edify my rage

I'm storing the laws of the human race, to turn the rules away
I'm a virus inside without a face, in a virtual world I play,
I'm loading my datas in the files, to control the means of this age
I've passed around and hypnotized, the data code of their cells

[Chorus]
I stand alone
In the corridors of knowledge
I seat the walls
To edify my rage
