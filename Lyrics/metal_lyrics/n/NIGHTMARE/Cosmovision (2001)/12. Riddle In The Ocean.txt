Did you hear about a story, lost in the heart of a town
Did you hear about it, a city never found

[Chorus]
Antigua Atlantis
I wanna prove your existence
No more silence
Can you feel the glory of this age
Can you feel the mystic trails

[Post-Chorus]
In the deeep of the ocean..., we solven the riddle,
We changed the colours, we got the answer from the sea...

In the deep of the ocean, far on the brinks of this town
Do you dream about it, the secrets of this ground

[Chorus]
Antigua Atlantis
I wanna prove your existence
No more silence
Can you feel the glory of this age
Can you feel the mystic trails

[Post-Chorus]
In the deeep of the ocean..., we solven the riddle,
We changed the colours, we got the answer from the sea...

It was a new generation, aiming for eternety
A model of evolution, a promising society
You lie... deep in the sea
You dive... into the nil

[Post-Chorus]
In the deeep of the ocean..., we solven the riddle,
We changed the colours, we got the answer from the sea...
