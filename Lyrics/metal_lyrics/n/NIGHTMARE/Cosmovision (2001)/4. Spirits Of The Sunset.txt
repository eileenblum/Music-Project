I walk on the crests through the valleys of Nar
Revealing a sacred land
I will escape this starway to death
Trying to believe
Approaching the mountain, the twilight is near
Touching the sky with my hand
Beholding the reign, controlling the fear
Ready to believe

[Pre-Chorus]
Himalaya, you're the temple of all divinities
Above the skies, you're the kingdom of all prophecies

[Chorus]
[in the] spirits of the sunset, here we are the kings
reaching the stairs of our dreams
[in the] spirits of the sunset, here we are the kings
reaching the final dream

I walk through the mist at the borders of light
Crossing a no man's land
I am the heart, a vision divine
The guardians of Devil
Setting the links of a new religion
Giving my life for this land
I've found the gates of of resurrection
The way to believe

[Pre-Chorus]
Himalaya, you're the temple of all divinities
Above the skies, you're the kingdom of all prophecies

[Chorus]
[in the] spirits of the sunset, here we are the kings
reaching the stairs of our dreams
[in the] spirits of the sunset, here we are the kings
reaching the final dream
