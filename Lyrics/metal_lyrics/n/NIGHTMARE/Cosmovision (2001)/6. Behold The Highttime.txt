I'm on the run beholding the sunrise
Searching what the story told
I'm onthe run like a sailor in the sky
I deny the day I will be old

[Pre-Chorus]
Ride-up! The thread of the time
Ride-up! At the speed of light

[Chorus]
No one believed in me
When I tried to cross de seasons,
For freedom
Playing the fool
Breaking the rules

[Post-Chorus]
And i will behold the nighttime...

I understand beholding the sunrise
I've made a breach throught the time
i..., I understand
that the future can be mine

[Chorus]
No one believed in me
When I tried to cross de seasons,
For freedom
Playing the fool
Breaking the rules

[Post-Chorus]
And i will behold the nighttime...
