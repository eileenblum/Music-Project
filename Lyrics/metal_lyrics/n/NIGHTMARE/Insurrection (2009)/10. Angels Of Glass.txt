She's looking through the window of her life
when life is only scars
she can't realize she's dreaming
about the distant stars

How can she find her paradise?
Sparks are shining in her eyes

Even the angels can't fly
painted angel of glass
even the angels can't fly
even the angels can't fly
even the angels can't fly
broken angels of glass

She's looking through the sorrow of her pain
she feels so hurt inside
she can't realize she's dying
with no one by her side

How can she find her paradise?
too many dreams left behind

Even the angels can't fly
painted angels of glass
even the angels can't fly
even the angels can't fly
even the angels can cry
broken angels!

Broken angels... Broken angels...

Even the angels can't fly
broken angels of glass
even the angels can cry
broken angels
Even the angels can't fly
even the angels can cry
angels of glass...
