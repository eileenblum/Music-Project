Can you see regrets in my eyes
I'm sure I couldn't take that promise
handing over all my friends
I pull them to the end
I vanish for so many years
and i try to disappear
I've been so long on the run
ho, I feel like I'm done
time is playing with my life
I feel I will never be free

My revelations
turn my life upside down
my revelations
now, I'm a target for revenge
my revelations
but there's no way to turn back
my revelations
what have I done?

You think it's a treason
I call it a deal
they're taking me out of prison
for my precious reveals
the ones I've killed before
are now the ones who are protecting me
i was respected like a god of war
now the children are degrading me
I'm waiting for my time with dignity
I have no fear of the judgment day
there are creeping shadows in the dark
I see a bull's eye on my heart

My revelations
turn my life upside down
my revelations
now, I'm a target for revenge
my revelations
but there's no way to turn back
my revelations
what have I done?... My revelations...

My revelations
turn my life upside down
my revelations
I am a target for revenge
my revelations
but there's no way to turn back
my revelations
what have I done?
my revelations... you've saved my soul...
my revelations...
