We're living in a world of rage...

There is no place for innocence
we have so much blood on our hands
what's going on?
are we gonna stop that fire?
there are no places to be free
over the time and history
do we belong, to the race of the liars?

The anarchists raise the fist
Nazi skin: son of the bitch!
the terrorists set the list
all the fascists... praise the beast
how can we find a reason to believe?

We're not alive...
we're living in a world of rage
we're not alive... now or never...
we're living in the razor's edge

Many people carry the cross
the human race is on its loss
what's movin' on?
are we gonna change that failure?
we're only marching on the knees
we have no friends, just enemies
it's on and on...
we need to find a life... ailleurs!

The anarchists raise the fist
Nazi skin: son of the bitch!
the terrorists set the list
all the fascists... praise the beast
how can we find, a way to live in peace?

We're not alive...
we're living in a world of rage
we're not alive... now or never...
we're living in a world of rage

The next insurrection... is a revolution...

The anarchists raise the fist
Nazi skin: son of the bitch!
the terrorists set the list
all the fascists... praise the beast

We're not alive...
we're living in a world of rage
we're not alive... now or never...
we'll never die!
we're not alive...
we're living in a world of rage
we're not alive... now or never!!!
