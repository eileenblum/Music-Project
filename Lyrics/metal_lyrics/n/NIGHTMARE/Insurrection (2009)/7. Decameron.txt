1348: a piece of history
1348: in the North of Italy
the black plague spreads the fear
people must escape from here
the smell of death is everywhere

History tells, how they used to live
in a world of love and hate... and demons...

Searching a way to live in harmony
another world to reach their destiny... their demons...
fooling... to live in harmony
another day to reach their destiny

10 dark bloody tales to prove debauchery
10 dark bloody tales betray insanity
crazy people laugh and cry
lazy girls give love and die
the scent of spell is in the air

History tells, how they used to die
in a world of love and lie... and demons...

Searching a way to live in harmony
another world to reach their destiny...
fooling... to live in harmony
another day to reach their destiny

Searching a way to live in harmony
another world to reach their destiny...
fooling... to live in harmony
another day to reach their destiny
