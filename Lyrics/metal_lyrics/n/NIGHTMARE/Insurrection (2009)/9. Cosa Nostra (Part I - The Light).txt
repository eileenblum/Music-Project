I am a man in distress living my life in sadness
all of my fellows are lost and gone
I just feel only disgrace, when I walk in this darkness
I dream alone only before dawn

I am a dreamer
watching my fathers
building their lives since 200 years
I am a sinner
I miss my mother
I have compassion for all her tears

Cosa nostra...

There is a code of silence to join the dark allegiance
Is it my freedom: a secret place?
But there's a call of vengeance, that will let me any chance
The cosa controls from their base

I am a dreamer
watching my fathers
building their lives since 200 years
I am a sinner
I miss my mother
I have compassion for all her tears

Cosa nostra...
will dive in my dreams...

I am a dreamer

I am a dreamer
watching my fathers
building their lives since 200 years
I am a sinner... I am a dreamer
I miss my mother
I have compassion for all her tears... all their tears
I am a dreamer... I am a dreamer
watching my fathers
building their lives since 200 years
I am a sinner, I am a sinner
I miss my mother
I have compassion for all her tears...
