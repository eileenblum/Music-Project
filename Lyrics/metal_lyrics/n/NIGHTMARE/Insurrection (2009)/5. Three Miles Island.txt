"Good evening! The world has never known a day
quite like today. it faced the considerable uncertainties
and dangers of the worst nuclear power plant
accident of the Atomic Age..."

Watch the walls falling down to pieces
watch the blue lights coming from the fission of steel
see the warnings, it's a radiation crisis
there's no actingsÂ but just the truth to reveal
don't believe them! The NRC tells a lie!
it's an emergency of radioactivity
the China Syndrome is still a danger alive
losing control of technology

The core of the plant is burning
the heart of the beast is sleeping
the core of the plant is burning
the heart of the beast inside

How can we? how can I forgive them all?
what will be the finality of this world?
no one sees...

"An accident in the water cooling system in the
Three Miles Island nuclear power plant in Harrisburg
(Pennsylvania) forced the company to call a general
emergency and shut down a part of the plant
for an unspecified period..."

Watch the world that cannot face the danger
see the newslines selling their bunches of lies
see your blessings, it's a radiation cancer!
there's no escape for the future of our life
just believe! see the end of mankind!
you've sold our destiny for twenty centuries
kill the factory!

The core of the plant is burning
the heart of the beast is sleeping
the core of the plant is burning
the heart of the beast inside

General emergency!...
