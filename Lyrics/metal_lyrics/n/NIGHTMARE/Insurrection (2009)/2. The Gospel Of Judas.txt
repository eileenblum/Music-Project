I am the tyrant
maybe a preacher or a spy?
breaking the rules in religion's lines
I am the regent
in a gospel of a new kind
I'm calling out, I scream so many lies

I blow, I spread
the winds of delusion
when Jesus returns
I blow, I spread
the winds of confusion
and Jesus learns

I am the traitor
maybe apostle of the dark
changing the lines of the bible in black
I am the actor
in the gospel of Jesus Christ
I'm breaking out, to keep my head up high

My final words will be the lasts
here is the gospel of Judas...
...forever change, thy kingdom!

I blow, I spread
the winds of delusion
when Jesus returns
I blow, I spread
the winds of confusion
when Jesus will learn

The gospel of Judas...

My final words will be the lasts
here is the gospel of Judas...
...forever change, thy kingdom!

I blow, I spread
the winds of delusion
when Jesus returns
I blow, I spread
the winds of confusion
and Jesus will learn!!!
