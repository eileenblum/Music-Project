Welcome beyond the mirrors!
the mirrors of damnation...

There is a demon in my soul
and I'm just out of control
for a night of domination
I make the rules, you play the parts
but nothing will never start
this is your disillusion
with all the things I keep inside
there is a devil in my mind
the pain you feel is perversion
hungry for men, I am tonight
and you're the slave that I will bite
for my sweet satisfaction

On the floor, you're lying awake
to the shores, you just sail away
with no escape from the cages
on the floor, you're lying awake
to the shores, you just sail away
to a bed of black roses

Welcome beyond the mirrors!
the mirrors of damnation...

Tonight, I'm not what I seem
I'm not a vision of your dream
this is your desolation
don't look beyond my crystal eyes
and Iâm the lady in disguise
and a shade of illusion
I order things that you will do
you gotta get the message through
and you know that you'll be mine
when I can see you want some more
I will bring you to the final shore
as you feel so hot inside

On the floor, you're lying awake
to the shores, you just sail away
for ever sail away!
on the floor, you're lying awake, you're lying awake
to the shores, you just sail away, just sail away

On the floor, you're lying awake
to the shores, you just sail away
for ever sail away!
on the floor, you're lying awake, you're lying awake
to the shores, you just sail away...
