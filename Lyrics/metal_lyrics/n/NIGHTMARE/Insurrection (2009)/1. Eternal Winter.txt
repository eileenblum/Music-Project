The night's descending, the sunset is black
And crimson skies are burning
This is a warning, for the final impact
But there's no savior for the dyings
Is the future we made, the only solution
Or just the progress of a chain reaction?
Time after time, blind lead the blind
So do we deserve to survive?

Now we can feel the winter
as we realize that we're all dead
Now we can't feel no whisper
No signs of life,Â our callings are in vain
Now we can feel the winter
Will the sun shine again?
Now we can't feel no whisper
And we will see... it will never be the same...

The ground is shaking, the planet will blast
Our foundations are falling
The only remains are the shades of our past
Into a world that keeps on burning
Is the future we made a desperation
Or just the process of a change of seasons?
Over the time, the rise of the ice
Has broken the cycle of eternal life

Now we can feel the winter
As we realize that we're all dead
Now we can't feel no whisper
No signs of life,Â our callings are in vain
Now we can feel the winter
Will the sun shine again?
Now we can't feel no whisper
It will never be the same...

It will never... never be the same...
