This is the code of our pride in a wartime
To cross the line of a no return
We feel the rage when we stand at the frontline
We feel the heat when the fire still burns

How many dreams of war have turned to nightmares?
The battle rages on, it's time to die
Across the lines, we are the winners
There's no way back for the losers... die!

We are the legions of the rising sun
Fighting to be free
We are the legions of the rising sun
When we feel no fears, we build the next empire
We are the legions of the rising sun
Fighting to be free
We are the legions of the rising sun
When we feel no fears, we raise our spirits higher

We are the kings of Chinatown
We spread the chaos all around
We are the devils in the dark
It is your time to surrender
In death, you'll find the answer

We are the legions of the rising sun
Fighting to be free
We are the legions of the rising sun
When we feel no fears, we build the empire
We are the legions of the rising sun
Fighting to be free
We are the legions of the rising sun
When we feel no fears ... et s'envolaient ailleurs

We are the legions of the rising sun
(We are one for all, we are all for one...)
Fighting to be free
We are the legions of the rising sun
(We are one for all, we are all for one...)
When we feel no fears, we build the next empire
We are the legions of the rising sun
(We are one for all, we are all for one...)
Fighting to be free
We are the legions of the rising sun
(We are one for all...)
When we feel no fears, we raise our spirit higher

It is the code of our pride after midnight
To cross the line of a no return
It's not a game, we will fight âtil the daylight
We have no shame and the fire still burns

One for all... and all for one...
