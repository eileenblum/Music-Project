Living souls are fading lights
Wrapped in shadows
You've hurled your fears into the depths
Where you will find me

If you let me feed your passion
I'll let you live in reason
Mysterious memories unfold
Where I will find you

Hiding your secrets can not keep us apart
I'll take you back to the start

Enjoy the journey
Through walls of shame
Stillness is writhing
Try to remember your name

[Chorus]
I will grow inside of you
Master of your sleepless minds
I'll remain under your skin
Shine upon your darkest nights
I'm the fire, I'm the fuel
Let me take your breath away
Intoxicating... Break the rules
For at least one thrill a day

Hiding your secrets can not keep us apart
I'll take you back to the start

Enjoy the journey
Through walls of shame
Innocence burning
Erasing my name

[Chorus]
