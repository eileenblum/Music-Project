Despite the darkness
I wouldn't listen to what they said
That early morning, just around the corner I prayed
Why
Should I give into the grey
And let them rip my heart away?
I feel what your eyes can't see
I won't live on my knees

[Chorus]
They tore our wings but we head for the sun
We are stronger than ever
We shelter our dreams far from the rain
We live when too many have gone
We love when so many will hate
I think you and I were meant to see
Another day

What can be done when
Tears are painting hopeless scenes?
When tears are flowing
There ain't no different color from skin to skin

Why
Should I give into the grey
And let them rip my heart away?
I feel what your eyes can't see
I won't live on my knees

[Chorus]

I think you and I were meant to live
Under a dead sun

[Chorus]

I think you and I were meant to live
Under a dead sun
