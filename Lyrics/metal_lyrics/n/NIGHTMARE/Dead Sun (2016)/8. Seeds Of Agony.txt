There's an eye above the dark sky
That sees the world as it falls
The hourglass is losing sand
We held the future in our hands
Turning pages in a tale that's been foretold

When the storms are rising
It's the final warning
And no one can be safe from the plague that we breed

[Chorus]
We hold the ashes
Of stolen tomorrows
How can we dream
When the future is hollow
If we're out of the game
We all deserve to know
No need to pray

Lost in anger we denied
Fated to die before we tried
Despite our call for a rewind
Our gifts are buried with our pride
Turning pages in a tale that's been foretold

When the bells are calling
It's the final warning
And no one can be safe from the plague that we breed

[Chorus]
