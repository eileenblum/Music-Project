You blew me off
Birds of prey
You threw me off
It's a give away

You crossed the line
But you hold the gun
The evil creeps
It cannot be undone

You sold my name, you stole my soul â You owe me
It spun out of control
You owe me life for the starry skies gone black
Before I crawled into the light

[Chorus]
We're drowning in fiction
Unfold before our eyes
Exhaling contradiction
We learn to breath between the lies

Your sense of right and wrong
Got twisted in the early hours

Any suspicious, any doubts
Couldn't stand in our way
I can't believe we're meant to be the minority

Building dreams to look upon â we are all
Playing games that can't be won
You owe me life for the starry skies gone black
As we fall into the dark

[Chorus]

We're drowning in fiction
Unfold before our eyes
Exhaling contradiction
Now the starry skies are black
