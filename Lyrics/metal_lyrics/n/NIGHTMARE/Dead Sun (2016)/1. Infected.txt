If I follow, who'll stop me?
Pulling the trigger, I will destroy
Beyond the shadows, beyond the lies
Led by the masses of a different tide

You've got to leave
Defying, breaking away
No need to hide 'cause I will find you
Convicted of your crime

[Chorus]
Horizons all seem to fall apart
We only fear what we deny
Staring at the scene
To find out who we are
And realize...

We are infected!

Spit out the poison, we are infected
Ain't no escape, we're disconnected
Scream out in passion, no time to heal
Make your decision and seal the deal

[Chorus]

We are infected
We're disconnected
In the twilight of our alliance

[Chorus]

We are infected!
