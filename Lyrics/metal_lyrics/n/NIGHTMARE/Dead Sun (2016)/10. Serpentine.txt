There's a virus invisible poisoning your mind
No way to stop the infection!
There's a creature invincible slithering down your spine
Coiling around its possession

[Chorus]
The venom is inside
Burning your soul with dark delusions
It's haunting your lonely nights
Spinnin' round, you're lost, drowned in confusion
It's just a one-way-ride
Oh! And you're out of time
Frozen as the tapestry unwinds
Kiss your foe â Serpentine

As the madness begins to dance in the corner of your eyes
Fear claws and twists its reflection
Suffocating beneath the weight of an ever-growing tide
Breathless, you scream in affliction

[Chorus]
