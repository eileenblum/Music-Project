The streets are empty, here I walk again
I see the lonely trying to deal with their pain
Passing a brave soul with a grin on his face
Shadow's a shelter, ain't much peace in this place

[Chorus]
I am the bitter silence â I am in vain
I am the empty bottle killing your pain
I am the coldest winter chilling the night
I am the the echo, the echo of your pride

I won't burn, I won't fade
I am easy to catch
In this world that I have made
Find me after the crash
Would you care if I confessed
That I don't care at all
After all I am the reason
That the reason has gone

[Chorus]

Watch the beauty left behind
Could you do that for me?
I can't see I anymore
I assumed I was free

[Chorus]

Would it really change the world
Does it matter at all?
Love or hate, it's all the same
When the reason has gone

I decided to walk on by
Like the leaf drifts high and dry
I decided to walk on by
Like the wind will turn and die
