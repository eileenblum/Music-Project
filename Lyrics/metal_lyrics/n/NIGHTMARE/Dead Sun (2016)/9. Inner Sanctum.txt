Angels watching over me
They used to be our innocence
Changing our destiny

Angels live eternally
It's hard to face their absence
Endlessly

Lost in time

[Chorus]
We're turning on the sorrow of memories gone by
We can reach you brothers
We behold your shadows, they light up the sky
We can see you brothers

Time has overcome a wound
I didn't want to heal

Is there a heaven far beyond your star?
Is there a sunset in the place where you are?
Bring me the secret you are keeping inside
So many broken hearts you have left behind

[Chorus]

And here I stand
We can't find the tears
Time can make us hollow

And here I stand
After all these years
I find it hard to swallow
