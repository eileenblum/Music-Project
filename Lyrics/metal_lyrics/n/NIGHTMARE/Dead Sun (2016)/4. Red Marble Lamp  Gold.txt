Accusation â persecution
Violation of freedom
Empty souls, chasing power
Quelling empty desires

The present world you uncreate
Is the tomb you'll populate
Your lust and greed, your envy and pride
The deadly sins you glorify

You're running out of fools
To keep the blood from your hands
Making laws we can't afford
In the name of God or some pasty lord

Rise and fall
The wolves are howling
Rise and fall
The wheel is turning

[Chorus]
You're digging your own grave
Of red marble and gold
Your time has come
As you're striving for the throne
With your heart made of stone
Engraved with all your misery

Desperation â annihilation
Destruction of wisdom
Twisted fools in bloodied towers
Crumbling with their empires

Admire your tomb from within
A holy place for all your sins
You are just the devil inside
Your progeny's plastified

Trading your red marble and gold
For treasure in ashes cold
See how the rivers turned to red
Before they dried up our land

Rise and fall
The wolves are howling
Rise and fall
The wheel is turning

[Chorus]

The wheel is turning
The wolves are howling
