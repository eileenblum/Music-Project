Trespass in my life, you're starting a war
Living in a glasshouse throwing stones
Poison words, rotting the core
There's nothing left to save here anymore

Who would have thought it would be you?
I'd no longer consider true
Over the edge the ladders have fallen
And vermin get through

[Chorus]
As the years are passing by
We are drawing the line
Ain't no changing who we are
Enslaved to abide
We're as close as we are far
We keep crossing the line
Forever bound to who we are
Why can't we grow?

Trapped on the board, wasting rounds
The cord's been cut but still rebounds
This double edged sword is cutting us down
Tangled in the roots we can't deny

Who would have thought it would be you?
I'd forever be shackled to
Over the edge the ladders have fallen
And I'm left here with you

[Chorus]

Who would have thought it would be you?
Forever bound, I'm left here with you

We keep on crossing the line
I'm bound with you forever

Tangled in the roots
