Inside you woke a storm
Yet it's like the rain has gone
I won't stand another drop from you no more
It's gonna lift me right up off the ground
There won't be no escape, no turning round

[Chorus]
Come to me or leave me out, I will deny you
Shut or open wide my eyes translate the other side
Tried so hard to steal my smile, burning out lie after lie
That's how the story goes, but this one won't be mine

I'll skin you alive â no you won't bleed me dry

I kicked your threats and your weapons overboard
There won't be no way back, my power's been restored

[Chorus]

Set me free or leave me blind, I'll fly above you
Gone forever wild, I'm reaching for the other side
Destinations grown apart, with different stories in our hearts
I couldn't care for yours cause this time I got mine

Come to me or leave me out, I will deny you
Shut or open wide my eyes translate the other side
Tried so hard to steal my smile, burning out lie after lie
That's how the story goes, but this one won't be mine

Set me free or leave me blind, I'll fly above you
Gone forever wild, I'm reaching for the other side
Destinations grown apart, with different stories in our hearts
I couldn't care for yours cause this time I got mine

i'll skin you alive â you won't bleed me dry
