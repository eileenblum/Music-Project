Time is coming for a prince to take the power
His father the king has ceased to lead
The prince is in love with the throne
The king has left him the diamond crown
And the queen feels jealousy, she's the dark face of reality

Look for the diamond crown...

The diamond crown is in a tower
Find it you're a winner
And lift your dream higher
Bring your imagination
To the place where there's the diamond crown
And the queen feels jealousy, she's the dark face of reality

Time is coming for a prince to take the power
His father the king has ceased to lead
The prince is in love with the throne
The king has left him the diamond crown, diamond crown...
And the queen feels jealousy, she's the dark face of reality
