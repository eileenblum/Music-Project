In the heart of the city, where you are a prisoner
You still remember when you were a killer
Victim of a treason, you will feel a rage
Look for a weapon, get out of your cage

Try to open the gates, or like a flower, you'll fade
Remind your sorrow, and you'll know, you'll know

Let's go, out of jail, let's go, out of jail...

In the cold of the morning you run, you're a free man
Everywhere you've been to bring back his name
You've never found his trail, see another life
Don't return in your cell, see the paradise

Try to open the gates, or like a flower, you'll fade
Remind your sorrow, and you'll know, you'll know
