Can you hear inside your soul
The sound of a mystery voice
Here is you master, can you feel his call
You're still a blind child but your time has arrived
To trip far from the hell, where your angel has ring the bell
Follow the winding way, until the holy door
And now you have to pray to see a magical world

Glittering visions of a new horizon
You're in the homeland of silence, but you're far from violence
Do you remember this place, you've ever seen it before

Follow the winding way, until the holy door
And now you have to pray to see a magical world
Follow the winding way, until the holy door
And now you have to pray and look over the wall

Invisible world, give me your eyes
I wanna see the real life
Invisible world nearest from the light
Let me shine in your road with no more lies...
