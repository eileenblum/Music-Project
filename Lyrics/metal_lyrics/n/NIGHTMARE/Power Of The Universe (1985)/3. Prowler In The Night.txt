He's here like a prowler feeling himself to be the best
Walking as a tracker in his stricky dress
He's here in the jungle going on his fate
On through the traps, lost in the shades
He only walks on, he's still alone
But he's waiting for his victim of the day

Don't meet the tiger on his way, he's danger, he's the hunter
Don't meet the tiger on his way, he's danger, he's the hunter

Here comes his enemy, ready to the fight
He'll win for the glory 'til the end of the night
We're in the jungle, the place where we must hide
To survive 'cause he's born to be wild
He only walks on, he's maybe gone
So beware, you're his victim of the day

He's here like a prowler feeling himself to be the best
Walking as a tracker in his stricky dress
He's here in the jungle going on his fate
On through the traps, lost in the shades
He only walks on, he's still alone
But he's waiting for his victim of the day
