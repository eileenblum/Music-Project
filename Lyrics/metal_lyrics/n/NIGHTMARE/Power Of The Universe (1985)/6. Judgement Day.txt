They spread fear in the subway all day long
Armed and ready to rape, women in the town
They live in new York city, they're coming from the Bronx
They use to play the warriors all night long
Watch for them, catch the thrill, travel at the speed of sound
They're the leaders of the world, masters of the steel

They must beware of the last warning
The law is on their back, he's coming coming...

Here comes the judgement day, oh they will pay
For their crimes, for their murders and for what they say...
Here comes the judgement day, oh they will pay
For their crimes, for their murders and for what they say...

Hidden in the darkness of a cell
So lonely they will wait for the last rings of the bells
Bring them in the realm where are the warriors of hell

They must beware of the last warning
The law is on their back, he's coming coming...

They spread fear in the subway all day long
Armed and ready to rape, women in the town
They live in new York city, they're coming from the Bronx

They must beware of the last warning
The law is on their back, he's coming coming...

Here comes the judgement day, oh they will pay
For their crimes, for their murders and for what they say...
Here comes the judgement day, oh they will pay
For their crimes, for their murders and for what they say...
