I've been a slave of her law
At the first gleam of the dawn
She's my fairy in these days
And I only wanna be her pray

Princess always on the run
Princess of the rising sun
Heroine of my story, she's still away

I would go in her direction
I would follow her action
But I'm only in a dream
For me life is a stream

I would go in her direction
I would follow her action
But I'm only in a dream
For me life is a stream

Princess have you seen the run?
Are you still on the run?
Are you still in my story, running away?
Princess of the rising sun
You've been my fairy in these days
Are you really, really a princess?
