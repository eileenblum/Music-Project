It's easy to feel me, I'm the breath of your life
I give you reality with many lies
I've created the mountains, I've created the sea
My life is a game, my name is energy

I'm the power of the universe
And I'm living inside you, oh I'm your light
I'm the power of the universe
And I'm living inside you, I'm the power of the universe

I give you a sign, my fires is in the sky
Look to the sun and burn your eyes
Fight back your tears and I'll come inside your mind
Control your fear, please love me one more time

Power of the universe...
