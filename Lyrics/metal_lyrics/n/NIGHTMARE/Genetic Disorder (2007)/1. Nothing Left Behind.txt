It's been so fucking cold here... and all the prayers I've made tonight have somehow lost their meanings...

I watch the ceiling of an empty room
Where all my memories are falling down
In a dead end, I'm lost and doomed
I wanna stop this spellbound
There's a smell of death outside
I even forget my desires

I'm searching the answer which never exists
I'm pulling the trigger, I couldn't resist

I'm leaving behind all the past
When I close my eyes, it's coming back again
I'm leaving this life much too fast
When I close my eyes, it's coming back... again

Its' been a long, cold and lonely ride
My loved ones are so far away
'Til the next day I will close my eyes
I wanna take this highway
There's a scent of blood in the cell
It was the right time for a farewell

I'm searching the answer which never exists
I'm pulling the trigger, I couldn't resist

I'm leaving behind all the past
When I close my eyes, it's coming back again
I'm leaving this life much too fast
When I close my eyes, it's coming back... again

Searching the answer which never exists

I'm crawling...
I'm leaving behind all the past
When I close my eyes, it's coming back again
I'm crawling...
I'm leaving this life much too fast
When I close my eyes, it's coming back... again
