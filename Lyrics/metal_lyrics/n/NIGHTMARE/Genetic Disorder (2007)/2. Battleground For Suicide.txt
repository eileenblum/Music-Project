We had no faith but no will,
We've lost our pride the night before
We took this word for real
We search a secret door
A sacred God will deliver us
A million stars will shine upon us
But we travel so far to a holy world

Lead us, we give you our faith and our mind
Lead us, there's nothing left behind

We brave the fires of the sky
Our battleground for suicide
Follow the leader... his call...

There is no one at the gate
Follow the priest or stay alone
There is no time to waste
'Til the last one is gone
But it's too hard to erase
Our memories before it's too late
At the end of nowhere
We will find the truth

Lead us, we give you our faith and our mind
Lead us, there's nothing left behind

We brave the fires of the sky
Our battleground for suicide
Follow the leader... his call...
