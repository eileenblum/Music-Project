Is there a reason to loose my soul?
Alone in the dark, lost in the grip of my poison
Is it reality to play this role?
Is it the final dance with the white demon?

I fear the silence
On through the night
I'm surfing on the line
I fear the silence
I touch the skies and I feel so high

There's no solution to cure my pain
Only the needles in my veins wash my delusion
I live a real trance going insane
Was this the only way to my redemption?

I fear the silence
On through the night
I'm surfing on the line
I fear the silence ... and I'm alone
I touch the skies and I feel so high...
