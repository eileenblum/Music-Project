In the deep of your heart you're alone
But the love that you hide will shine again
To heal your wounds, to clean your pain
I wanna see you from the inside
I wanna feel that your world is mine
But you still think of the past
In your dark and twisted mind

In the heart of a savior
You're the queen of love and pain
You control my behaviour
You know: my life is not a game!

Take my hand and we'll walk to the other side
To a dream that is real for you and I
To break the spell, to build our mights
I wanna save you from your shadows
I wanna know that you've cut your claws
Then our hearts will still beat
Together and ever as one

In the heart of a savior
You're the queen of love and pain
You control my behaviour
You know: my life is not a game!

This time our love will dwell
in the name of Azrael...

You're the star, and I'm the shining

In the heart of a savior
You're the queen of love and pain
You control my behaviour
You know: my life is not a game!
You're the queen!
