I am in the state of chaos
I hug the walls 'cause I'm afraid
Shattered by the vision of my life
I dive in the heart of madness
Explore the depths of my distress
There's a venom in my blood
And my blood is black

A voice is calling back, a voice is calling

I feel a presence
Is the devil watching?
A sense of conspiracy
Can someone help me?
Do they control my privacy?
Can you silence that voice and I'll be free?

I am in the heart of the dark
Where I deny my only friend
Shattered by the vision of my life
I jump in the dead of darkness
I'm gonna die without witness
There's a dagger in my chest

A voice is calling back, a voice is calling

I feel a presence
Is the devil watching?
A sense of conspiracy
Can someone help me?
Do they control my privacy?
Can you silence that voice and I'll be free?

I dive in the heart of darkness
To explore the depths of my distress

[Voice of the devil auto-reverse]

Tell me lies if the truth is burning my eyes
Do you think I'm fucking mad?

I feel a presence
Is the devil watching?
A sense of conspiracy
Can someone help me?
Do they control my privacy?
Can you silence that voice and I'll be free?
