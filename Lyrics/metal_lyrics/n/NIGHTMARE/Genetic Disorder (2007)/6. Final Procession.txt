Humans are sailing to their final stand
With the feeling to be free
They play this game until the end
Dreaming of eternity

Digging the graves of their children
Sailing through the dark

You know deep down in your mind
Before they break into the night
Oh no, don't follow the blind!
Don't trust the sirens!

The blinds are marching to their final curse
They don't know why, they don't know where
They have crossed the universe
They are dying in despair

Digging the graves of their children
Sailing through the dark

You know deep down in your mind
Before they break into the night
Oh no, don't follow the blind!
Don't trust the sirens!

You're not at heaven's gate
But somewhere where I fear the light
Day after day, pain after pain
Obeys the sirens in your head!

You know deep down in your mind
Before they break into the night
Oh no, don't follow the blind!
Don't trust the sirens!

You know deep down in your mind
Don't trust the sirens!...
