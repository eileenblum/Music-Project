Your greed of power made the masses crawl
You're the tyrant of the earth
You've raised a giant shield of walls
Now everywhere you've spread the worst
(And) the battlefields are burning
The people pray for their deliverance

Awaiting the day when you will fall
We live under your weapons
Awaiting the day to break the wall
We're dreaming to be free

You lead our children to their graves
You are the leader of the masquerade
You are the only one to blame
You're lying to hide your masquerade

Your father's planned the desert storm
A crusade in the sands
Spreading around his hellfire
You've done the same you've stand your hands
Extending your empire
To shape the world to your convenience

Awaiting the day when you will fall
We live under your weapons
Awaiting the day to break the wall
We're dreaming to be free

You lead our children to their graves
You are the leader of the masquerade
You are the only one to blame
You're lying to hide your masquerade...
