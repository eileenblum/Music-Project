There is a blaze into the valley of shadows
A mystic power is sending us a sign
Deadly whispers are coming from the shallows
And dead bodies are drown up on the riverside

Can't you that the world is crumbling down
And all the lands are burning
Can't you see the thunderstorm that breaks the time

We are the last in line
Dancing alone in the limelight
Beyond the borderline
Ready to fly out of time...

Welcome to the dawn of darkness

A vision of apocalypse is rising from a sea of flames
We're like strangers under a frightening sky
In a kingdom that we will have to tame
We have one last hope: this is to survive

Can't you that the world is crumbling down
And all the lands are burning
Can't you see the thunderstorm that breaks the time

We are the last in line
Dancing alone in the limelight
Beyond the borderline
Ready to fly out of time...
