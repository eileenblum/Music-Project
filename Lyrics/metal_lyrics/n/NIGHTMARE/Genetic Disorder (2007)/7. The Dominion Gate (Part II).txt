There's a blast in the vortex
A direct access to Hell
The DNA has mutated and failed
The machines breath, the men are dead

The bringers of the holy fire
The bringers of the light
Are shaping the boundaries of infinity
Creating unhuman beings

We're realizing a dream
But do we know, this future is unreal?
Shall we fly on cyber skies
In the eternal void?
Shall we fly on cyber skies
Are we becoming androids?

Waiting for the twilight
We need a world to believe
Our path is open wide
'Til the last we'll live

[Devil voice auto-reverse]

Why do you tell me these atrocities?
I'm sick of your lies and your fallacies

We're realizing a dream
But do we know, this future is unreal?
Shall we fly on cyber skies
In the eternal void?
Shall we fly on cyber skies
Are we becoming androids?

Do you remember the time before
Where our dreams were allowed
When we were free with no fear for tomorrow

It's a cyber domination...
The mechanical heart will annihilate the human race...

We are at tomorrow's dawn
Now it's our time to be free
With no fear for tomorrow!

Shall we fly on cyber skies
In the eternal void?
Shall we fly on cyber skies
Are we becoming androids?...
