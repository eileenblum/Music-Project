I am the chosen one
The evil child in black
I am the angel of sin
Endoctrinated, ready to attack
The blood I spill, Fuck and kill
The enemies of God!

Another child is riding a mission
Another child is sacrificed
Another child is a symbol of salvation
Another child will die
In the winds of sin...

Is he a bloody war
In the middle of the fight?
I am a victim of God
Full of hatred, I sacrifice my life
Preach for hate, save my soul
And die for my land!

Another child is riding a mission
Another child is sacrificed
Another child is a symbol of salvation
Another child will die
In the winds of sin...

The winds of sin...
