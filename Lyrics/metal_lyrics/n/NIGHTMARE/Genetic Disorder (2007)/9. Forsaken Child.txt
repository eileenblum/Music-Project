Explain to me the real sense of so many dirty lies
The agony of innocence
It reveals a bloody rite, the plunder of their eyes
The mutitalions of their bodies for their parts

Now and then their pain is real
Do you know what they feel?
How can you still live in peace
(When) you hear them crying?

Marching through the window of eternal night
They'll never see the sun
Blinded by the street light
They're always on the run
And they can't stay alive... without guns

I walk alone in the void
No one can understand me
Nobody sees that I'm destroyed
I have lost my liberty
There's no future I can see
I will have no haven, no sanctuary

Now and then their pain is real
Do you know what they feel?
How can you still live in peace
(When) you hear them crying?

Marching through the window of eternal night
They'll never see the sun
Blinded by the street light
They're always on the run
And they can't stay alive...
