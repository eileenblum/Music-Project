On the edge of the night you were ready to die
They caught you by surprise challenge you with a sight
While awaiting for hell they locked you in a cell
And they switched on the flame burning down in your brain

You'll see from the skies like a blinding light
Remember the time when you were running wild
Running wild...

Can you hear a message written down in your grave
The meaning of your death so hard and so restless
You can send on your way at the gleam of the day
They make you loose your mind and forever you'll be blind yeah

You'll see from the skies like a blinding light

On the edge of the night you were ready to die
They caught you by surprise challenge you with a sight
While awaiting for hell they locked you in a cell
And they switched on the flame burning down in your brain
