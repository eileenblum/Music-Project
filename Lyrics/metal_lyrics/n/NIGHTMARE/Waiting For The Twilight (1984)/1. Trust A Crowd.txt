Classrooms are fool but your lessons are so far
Since you dreamed one day to play guitar
I've been talked about by so many friends and now
Your favourite band's gonna play in the town
I feel something special when I see those teenagers
Running out from school to the show
It seems nothing has changed and it makes me remember
As I was few years ago

[Chorus:]
Get up of your seat! join the crowd!
Get up get the beat oh yeah!
Get up of your seat, trust a crowd
Get up get the beat oh yeah!

Classrooms are fool but your life is outside
And you wanna see the sunshine in your eyes
They stole your brain but your heart stays for the night
Where there's no teachers where we trust a crowd
I feel something special when I see all those teenagers
Running out from school to the show
It seems nothing has changed and it makes me remember
As I was few years ago
