Out of the way through the rays of the light
She used to sell what all men want to buy
She makes a gleam of delight shining on every guy's mind
Standing on the streets she throws you a little smile
She says give you my lips if you're ready to pay the price

But I've seen it in her eyes she would like another life
But today's too late... too late
Today's too late... to change
Today's too late... your way
Today's too late

She wanted to be free so free so she fell down in this sad jail
And she cries when she sees a red light shining on a daze

Out of the way on the rays of the light
She used to sell what all man want to buy
