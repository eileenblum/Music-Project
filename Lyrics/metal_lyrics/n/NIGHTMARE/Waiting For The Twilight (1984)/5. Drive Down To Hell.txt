Drive on a way 'til the end of the day 'til the middle night
The noise of the wheels the crash of the steel will echo in the sky
You're ready to win only livin' in the power and the rage
For the sake of speed you're still runnin' to lie in your grave

Look around you everywhere see the danger now you dare

[Chorus:]
It's the same old game that you always play
When the sun is going down
The same old game the same all the days
Won't you change the road you're on

Now accelerate and play with your fate 'til the early morning light
Follow the line just like a blind who's no chance to survive
You feel your race as a flight in space but you're no more than a dust in the wind
Can you hear the bells calling you to hell where you fell because of your sin

Look around you everywhere see the danger now you dare

It's the same old game that you always play
When the sun is going down

Drive on a way 'til the end of the day and you will see the fire
The noise of the wheels the crash of the steel will echo in your mind
You're ready to win only livin' in the power and the rage
For the sake of speed you're still runnin' to lie in your grave

Look around you everywhere see the danger now you dare

[Chorus:]
It's the same old game that you always play
When the sun is going down
The same old game the same all the days
Won't you change the road you're on
