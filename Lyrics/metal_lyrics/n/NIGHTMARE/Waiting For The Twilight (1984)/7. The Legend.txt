Listen once upon a time a fairy came on my way
She told me which record to buy to find a way to learn to sing
I was no more than a child and they got the world still stay on my lips
Sweet child in time in the dark in the black knight you will shame
Lazy girl know who you are but in fact you're not to blame
And your speed king in your car you can drive far far away
You got no chance so good you are to reach the stars of the highway

Somewhere fly the glory knights
Somewhere in the skies
Can't you see...

Fire's always good for them remember burn one of the best
When smoke on the water went then they knew the smell of success
And now you can understand these fires burning in my chest

Somewhere fly the glory knights
Somewhere in the skies
Can't you see...

It's a legend alive...

I was no more than a child some of their songs still stay on my lips
And I've dreamed one of these night god will come back and take the lead
Sweet child in time through the light we win much more then unchained
See god wake up and fight to see the stars of the highway

Somewhere fly the glory knights
Somewhere in the skies
Can't you see...
