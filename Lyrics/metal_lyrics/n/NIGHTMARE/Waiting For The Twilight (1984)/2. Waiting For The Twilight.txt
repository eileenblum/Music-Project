6 o'clock my job is done and I walk in the streets
Girls don't care I'll become the man I've dreamed to be
Come back home come back hell, turn on the radio
I start to dance with myself face to face with the mirror

Waiting for the twilight, my time will come
To shine in the light of rock'n roll
Waiting for the twilight, my time will come
To shine in the light of rock'n roll

Come on I play the man, driving girls crazy
And soon all those pretty girls seem to me so crazy
Then I will stop to play those games of sounds and steel
All what I have to say is the loneliness I feel

I pay for my precious life my past is still haunting me
There's no way to die for all eternity
My life is made of toys please god say my soul can be saved
Pray for the little boy lost in the light of day
