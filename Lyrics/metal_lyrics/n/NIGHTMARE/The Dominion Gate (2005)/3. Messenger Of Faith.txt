I've been sailing so far
In a sea of strangers
I know there is no turning back
I am the last passenger
I will defend my crown
The trail is open wide
I forsake my kingdom
Nothing else to sacrifice

Like a soldier under command...
I am a messenger of faith
Ready to die a hero's death
I am a messenger of faith, I am a messenger

I find the golden age
I defy the thunder
Still there is no turning back
I am the last warrior
I have to civilize
A million miles away
I erase my wisdom
I lost my soul but I will stay

Like a soldier under command...
I am a messenger of faith
Ready to die a hero's death
I am a messenger of faith, I am a messenger

You can't take my dreams away
I will live another way
I can't live another life
And see my life passing by
I won't shred another tear
I don't want to live in fear...
