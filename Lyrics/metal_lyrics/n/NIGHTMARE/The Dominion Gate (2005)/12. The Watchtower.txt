You preach for a new god but he's the Antichrist
The curses of this god are the curse of mankind
The once who followed you have been dehumanized
You march alone led by the blind

You search the night, the silence of the lamb
Hailing the demons of hell
Hell is revealed but you don't want to understand
That the watchtower is casting a spell

You spend your time dreaming of tomorrow
Winners or losers?
You build your religion on pain and sorrow
Saints or sinners?

You are the unicorn that cannot ease our sorrows
You are the devil's eyes, our road to the gallow
You're spreading out the plague with your battalions of hate
You are the ones to wear a robe of state

You search the night, the silence of the lamb
Hailing the demons of hell
Hell is revealed but you don't want to understand
That the watchtower is casting a spell

You spend your time dreaming of tomorrow
Winners or losers?
You build your religion on pain and sorrow
Saints or sinners?

You pretend to speak in the name of god
Preaching for immortality
You descend from an ancient kingdom that's gone
Prophets of humanity

You search the night, the silence of the lamb
Hailing the demons of hell
Hell is revealed but you don't want to understand
That the watchtower is casting a spell

You spend your time dreaming of tomorrow
Winners or losers?
You build your religion on pain and sorrow
Saints or sinners?
