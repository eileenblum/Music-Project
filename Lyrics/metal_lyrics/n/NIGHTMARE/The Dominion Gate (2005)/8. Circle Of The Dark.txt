We like to play a dangerous game
When the dusk is hiding the moonlight
Inside our brains, no rules subside
Desperation, divination
Who knows we will cross the line?
Celebration and say good bye to your mind

Be a part of the cast, sign your name
Be a shade of the past, carved on the wall of shame

Here we are, in the circle of the dark
We live our life at the dead of the night
Here we are and the hounds will bark
And we're gonna die after midnight

We try to taste a dark sensation
When out soul is reaching afterlife
Inside our heart, it's cold as ice
A new dimension, annihilation
A light is shining bright behind
Condemnation...
We're lost in space and time

Be a part of the cast, sign your name
Be a shade of the past, carved on the wall of shame

Here we are, in the circle of the dark
We live our life at the dead of the night
Here we are and the hounds will bark
And we're gonna die after midnight
