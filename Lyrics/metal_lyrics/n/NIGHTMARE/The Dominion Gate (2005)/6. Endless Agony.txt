A piece of my story in cell number 3
From this jail, there's no return
Freedom has a price, there's nothing I can do
When will my dream come true?

I'll never see the sun
I'm a victim on the run

I'm screaming out of pain
Shout it loud to be free!
I'm screaming out of pain
Shout it loud! Freedom, life... I wanna prosper!

My place had no glory, my town had no hope
I had to learn to be strong
They wanted to command what I had to do
And put me away for so long

I'll never see the sun
I'm a victim on the run

I'm screaming out of pain
Shout it loud to be free!
I'm screaming out of pain
Shout it loud! Freedom, life... I wanna prosper!
