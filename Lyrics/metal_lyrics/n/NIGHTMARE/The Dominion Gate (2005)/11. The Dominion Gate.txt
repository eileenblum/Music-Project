Is there a place full of silvery stars?
Somewhere to hide our shame
Is there a way to erase our scars?
An existence with no one to blame

We've found the key to a new world
Where no one has done before
Where no one has gone

Casting shadows
Can't you see, the ghosts are awake?
The stair at the window... to the dominion gate

After the fright, after the final storm
A total new order will rise again
From far beyond, a new kind is born
Will we be safe in a place gone insane?

We've found the key to a new world
Where no one has done before
Where no one has gone

Casting shadows
Can't you see, the ghosts are awake?
The stair at the window... to the dominion gate

Behind this gate, death has no name
Behind the gate, the dreams we have are all the same
In this new world, freedom is the key
Life is sublime, this is what we want, what we want to see

We've crossed many borders and left so much behind
Nations in ruins, a cry from a child
Hate and despair as the sign of the time

Now and then we have a chance, we have a dream
To create a new life
In this place, you will want to stay, will want to stay with me
Forever by my side

You and I, we have to try, we have to realize
To forget our pride

From this place, you will have to learn, have to learn and cherish it
The cycles of life... of life

We've found the key to a new world
Where no one has done before
Where no one has gone

Casting shadows...
The stair at the window...
I can't stand our distance, let me break the silence

Behind the gate, death has no name
Behind this gate, the dreams we have are all the same

Is there a place full of silvery stars?
Somewhere to hide our shame
Is there a way to erase our scars?
An existence with no one to blame

We've found the key to a new world
Where no one has done before
Where no one has gone

Casting shadows
Can't you see, the ghosts are awake?
The stair at the window... to the dominion gate
