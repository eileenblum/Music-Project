I see a distant light
My blood is running cold
Smell of destruction
Madman's obsession
No one can hear my calls
I feel a whisper grazing me

House of fear, in the lair of the beast
For the dressmaker, I'm a simple peace

A prey of the carver
...of human skin...

My hands are strongly tied
And I'm screaming out to die
I smell his dirty breath
His eyes are filled with death
Mortal destruction, with no salvation
The hangman is by my side
I feel a whisper grazing me
House of fear, in the lair of the beast
For the dressmaker, I'm a simple peace
A prey of the carver

...of human skin...

I can hear a sound
He drags me across the floor
I feel a blade cuts my flesh
Hurting me more, more and more...
Don't worry, I will finish my work...

Smell of destruction
Madman's obsession
No one can hear my calls
I feel a whisper grazing me
House of fear, in the lair of the beast
For the dressmaker, I'm a simple peace
A prey of the carver

...of human skin...
