As the driver I'll stop at the end of the road
I step among the dead and dyings
Stalking the night at the scene of the crime
Everywhere and anywhere
Holding out, I'm facing the troubles
In a spiral of madness

Lost in a temple of tears
I'm cold and I'm alone
Lost in a temple with my heart of stone...

Our stretcher has seen all the pain in the world
Everywhere I can hear crying
All by myself in the heart of the town
From everyone and anyone
I'm always there, the human savior
In total oblivion
I carry my painful distress

Lost in a temple of tears
I'm cold and I'm alone
Lost in a temple with my heart of stone...
