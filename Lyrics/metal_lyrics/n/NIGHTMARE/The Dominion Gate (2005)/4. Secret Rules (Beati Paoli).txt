I hide behind a veil
The mighty code of silence
I ride a masquerade
To the sign of the cross, you dance
I feel the fire for the glory of our society
(In nomine dei paoli) I'm the keeper of honesty

Secret code of silence, secret code of fear
Is not just a legend, it is so real

All this time, I hold a pledge
I adore the ancient runes
Secular, magic rituals
Come celebrate! The secret rules

I lead the seven knights
And I feel eternally free
I hide the holy rite
For a pledge of secrecy
Fighting unfearness
In this endless battlefield

Secret code of silence, secret code of fear
Is not just a legend, it is so real

All this time, I hold a pledge
I adore the ancient runes
Secular, magic rituals
Come celebrate! The secret rules!...
