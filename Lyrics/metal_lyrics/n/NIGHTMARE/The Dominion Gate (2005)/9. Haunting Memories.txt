When I look at this picture
Searching a reason to stay alive
I realize when I see your eyes
That I can't bet on the future anymore

I still remember our life
I still recall everything we did together
I still remember our life
I'm still... missing you

I break the silence to hear my pain
I search your presence but I know it's in vain
I recognize the sacrifice to put in order
The fragments of the past

I still remember our life
I still recall everything we did together
I still remember our life
I still recall...

Cry a diamond!

Haunting memories will never fade
Cry a diamond wish I could go with you
I still remember our life
I still recall everything we did together
I still remember our life...
I'm still missing you...
I still remember our life
I still recall everything and every day
I still remember our life...

I'm still... missing you
