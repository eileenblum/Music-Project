In the past, I was serving the preachers
The masters I implored
Sometimes, there's no more beliefs in my fate
I say no prayers no more

And by the flames I will be burnt
I'm a defender of god
I feel it deep down in my guts
I feel his glowing fire

The judgement is done
I bring with me all the secrets of the knights
The sentence will come
I take with me all the riddles of the rite

All is gone and my soul disappeared
I left blood on my soil
Sometimes, I'm denying the sense when I prey
I can't find my god anymore

And by the flames I will be burnt
I'm a defender of god
I feel it deep down in my guts
I feel his glowing fire

The judgement is done
I bring with me all the secrets of the knights
The sentence will come
I take with me all the riddles of the rite
The riddles will die with me

Fighting in the fields
The unbelievers must be hunted down
Slayers on the hills
A smell of death is all around

And by the flames I will be burnt
I'm a defender of god
I feel it deep down in my guts
I feel his glowing fire

The judgement is done
I bring with me all the secrets of the knights
The sentence will come
I take with me all the riddles of the rite...
