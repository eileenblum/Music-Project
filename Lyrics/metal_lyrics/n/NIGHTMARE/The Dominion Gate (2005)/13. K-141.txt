I'm gonna tell you a well known story
A sacrifice of innocents
24 days of agony
How a last dive, gave them no chance
Somewhere in the arctic, the Russians were telling a lie
Forgotten by the world
In the rescue chamber, flooded with water
A.D. had to die

Hell awaits the enemy, somewhere in the Barents sea
The system is failing
Hell awaits the enemy, victim of hypocrisy
The system is lying

They will never come back home again
And I've lost another friend
They will never come back home
They are the victims of a vicious game

Commanders of the Russian fleet
Decided to conceal the truth
Somewhere down in the deep
The wreck revealed, they could have saved you
In a grave of steel, the truth was so real
Locked in the shell, their own private hell
One day we all will know why

Hell awaits the enemy, somewhere in the Barents sea
The system is failing
Hell awaits the enemy, victim of hypocrisy
The system is lying

They will never come back home again
And I've lost another friend
They will never come back home
They are the victims of a vicious game...

They will never come back home again
I will never see my friend...
