Prisoner of the system
Witness of a rising fear
I feel it's like a fast moving train
Passing us so near
Something's working hard to change the rule
Something's trying hard to kill the fool

In this wasteland
Walking on a desert plain
In this wasteland
Aiming for a goal without end

Living for another day
Emerging for the mist
Hoping for another day
I'm fighting to exist... to exist...

Prisoner of illusion
I am victim of this trail
I am yielding to temptation
Is it heaven or is it hell?
Is this a destination where I can go?
I was skilled by imagination
I'm beyond recall

Living for another day, emerging from the mist
Ohh... it's a fight to exist...
Living for another, emerging from the mist
Ohh... it's a fight to exist...

Prisoner of the system...
