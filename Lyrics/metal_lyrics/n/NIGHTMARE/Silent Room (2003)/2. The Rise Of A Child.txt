His innocence is gone
His time will come
With his despair he walks alone
His innocence is gone
Desperate for a place to hide
No father to tell to open his eyes

Sometimes... he has a strange behaviour

Do you realize
The rise of a child
His lonely days will come
The rise of a child
His lonely days will come

His innocence is gone
His time will come
Without a friend he's alone at night
His innocence is gone
His room is dark there is no light
His mother cries he's beyond control

Sometimes... he turns into a different soul

...You're lonely Kenny...
