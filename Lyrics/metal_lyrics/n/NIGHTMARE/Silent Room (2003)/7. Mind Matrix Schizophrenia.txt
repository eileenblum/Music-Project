I'm paralyzed with staring eyes
I see spiders on the walls
Conveyor of suicide
No one expects my calls
Hypnotized, scrutinized
They are crawling over me
I need time to decide
What is my destiny

[Chorus:]
Mind matrix schizophrenia
Diagnosis: criteria
Mind matrix schizophrenia
Prognosis: hysteria

I'm a slave of evil drugs
They will never wash my sins
Hallucinations never fade
I've got my needle and my pin
"After dissecting his brain
I see paranormal activities..."
I got disorder in my brain...
"Paranormal activities"
