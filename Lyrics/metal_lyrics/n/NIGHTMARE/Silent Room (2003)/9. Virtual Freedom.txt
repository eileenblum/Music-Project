Day and night in a room cell
Are changing my behaviour
I'm still denied access to the game
But nothing can't prevent
What happens in my brain
Every minute I'm supposed to be the same

I feel the power from the game
"The child's rebellion" starts again

I need my freedom
Freedom... dominate! celebrate!
Freedom... the role that I play
I need my freedom
Freedom... dominate! celebrate!

Wakin' up in the morning
The child has disappeared
This time he has access to the game
No one could have guessed
This child would suffocate
And the curtain's falling down but it's too late

I speculate in evil anger
Where I go there is fright
Breakin' my chains I'm a runner
In the coldness of the night
