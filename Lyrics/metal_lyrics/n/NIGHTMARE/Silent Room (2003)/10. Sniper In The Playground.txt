Evil eyes, the height of violence
Slaughtering the innocents
Satisfied by such a revenge
I know this is your final dance
Realize your murders
25 is your number
Are you just a bystander
Or the fairgame of a dream maker?

[Chorus:]
A sniper is somewhere
Is taking aim at the playground
The killer is everywhere
And now we know Kenny's still around

Can you feel the haunting silence
Whispering a bloody victory
It's a sign of this vicious game
Colliding with reality
Realize your murders
25 is your number
Are you just a bystander?
Or the fairgame of a dream maker?
