I'm lost inside the playground
To follow the game is my only chance
Running through a no man's land
My trigger will be my only friend
Crystal mountains high, justify my evil role
Through the space and time, I'm reloading my soul

Travel in the spheres of dreams
What I feel is no fantasy
Battles in a world of sins
And what I feel is my destiny

Racing with no mercy
To save the hero is my only quest
Where is my reality?
Why don't you think I could be the best
Silver fountains deep swallowing my sanity
Welcome to my world, this will be my tragedy
