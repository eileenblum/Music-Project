There is a poison in my spirit
Subtle vibrations bring me high
Out of control my mind's going old
It makes me wonder
Will I be blind? oh out of my mind
How can I change? how can I change?

Nowhere to run
Shades in the night are so real
Nowhere to hide
Shades in the night are so real

I'll never reach the peace of mind
I see the fear in your eyes when I leave
The rule of the game is always the same
It drives me crazy
I must believe what I deceive
When will it change? when will it change?

There is a poison in my spirit
Subtle vibrations bring me high
Out of control my mind's going old
It makes me wonder
Will I be blind? oh out of my mind
How can I change? how can I change?
