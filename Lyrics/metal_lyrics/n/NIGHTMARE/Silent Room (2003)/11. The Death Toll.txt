I will surrender I've got no way out
Nothing to remember just the F.B.I.
I am ready to strike I have nothing to share
My surge of anger is a scream of despair

They're counting the dead
The death toll is rising
They're counting the dead
I am the clue of the slaughtering

One little boy too young to die
A moment of despair
One little boy who wants to cry
No one seems to care

My world is broken they push me to the floor
I can hardly breathe they're beating me some more
The battle is over, the battle is lost
Am I a number or just a ghost?

They're counting the dead
I am your nightmare... fuck you!
They're counting the dead
I am the clue of all this

I will surrender I've got no way out
Nothing to remember just the F.B.I.
I am ready to strike I have nothing to share
My surge of anger is a scream of despair
