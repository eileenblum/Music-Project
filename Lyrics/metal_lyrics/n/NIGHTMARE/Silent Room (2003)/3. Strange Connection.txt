It was time to create
And riding to fame
And the time is my fate
So I download a game

It's called " the child's rebellion "... end of the line
Check the rules for the next addiction.. and save the files!

I found a strange connection
I found a new direction
Look around, nobody knows what I've found
I'm so self destructive
Evil with wrong directives
Look around, you won't see what I've found

Distant signs of danger
From the other side
Do you know this stranger
This devil in disguise
