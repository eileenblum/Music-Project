I seal the night
I enter in the twilight zone
A scene of a crime
Mother tell me what's going on!
Is your life gone?
Keep on searching for the truth

I feel a storm in my head
Blowing my will
I'm lost I'll leave my spirit soon
I face a power insane
Blending the real
Alone in a bloody silent room

Endure the pain
And see the blood running around
I'm screaming again
Mother tell me what I have done!
Your life is gone
Keep on searching for the truth

...Mummy!...

Why is the night so black?
Is madness my reality?
I've gone too far to turn back
Is there a gate beyond my screen
Or is it a dream?
Maybe this game hides the truth
