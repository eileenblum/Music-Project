[Spoken:]
III - Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things that are written in it, for the time is at hand...
IV - John to the seven assemblies that are in Asia... Grace to you and peace from God who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before his throne,
V - And from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kinds of the earth. To him who loves us and washed us from our sins by his blood...
VI - And he has made us to be the kingdom, priests to his God and father... To him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever... Amen...
[The Book Of Revelation - Chapter I]

You never face the rising force,
The spellbound of your dark father divine
As the enslaver of the cross
Preacher of a new kind

Can't you feel the heat of his fire
Burning from the frozen skies
If you reach his evil desire
You will be burnt inside

In the dark, you realize
The your blood is cold as ice
Let your soul fall deep in disguise
And you're gonna live the inner bluster,
The power of his forceful sign

The rise of the preacher

Evil spirits light the moon
Cause in the Dark you can feel the pain
When the creature's coming soon
To make you bleed again

Can't you feel the heat of his fire
Burning from the frozen skies
If you reach his evil desire
You will be burnt inside

In the dark, you realize
The your blood is cold as ice
Let your soul fall deep in disguise
And you're gonna live the inner bluster,
The power of his forceful sign

The rise of the preacher
