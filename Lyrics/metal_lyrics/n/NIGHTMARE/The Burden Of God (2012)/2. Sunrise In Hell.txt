Do you hear the voice of the sirens
Rising away from the sea
The screams of your demons are coming back
Like a burden for eternity
What you recall is what you feel
In a demon's attack

I can't feel you
All your visions 're going black
I can't stand you
I feel I'm stabbed in the back

Do you remember
The sunrise
You life in fairytales
Do you remember
The sunrise in Hell...

Can you imagine the distance
Taken from reality
All your delusions
Are going to crush you
You're dead inside, before you're gone
Trying to reach what's your ideal
Even when you'll fall apart

I can't stand you
I feel I'm stabbed in the back

Do you remember
The sunrise
You life in fairytales
Do you remember
The sunrise in Hell...
