The last eruption
Is painting the colours of the skies
Setting the world on fire
This premonition
Is breaking our power and its lies
Raising our spirits higher

Friday...
The sun and the earth on the same line
Mayday!...
It's the final sign
Doomsday...
Breakin' down the cycle of Mayas
Friday...
From forgotten times

A revelation
Beyond the last breath of the age
The only path for heaven
Is it a fiction
Or just the end of a presage
Where will we find a haven?

Friday...
The sun and the earth on the same line
Mayday!...
It's the final sign
Doomsday...
Breakin' down the cycle of Mayas
Friday...
From forgotten times

Mankind will return to dust
Cropped into the darkness...
It's a Friday of December

Ancient Mayas have believed in their visions
A bloody thunder will come from the past...

Friday...
The sun and the earth on the same line
Mayday!...
It's the final sign
Doomsday...
Breakin' down the cycle of Mayas
Friday...
From forgotten times
