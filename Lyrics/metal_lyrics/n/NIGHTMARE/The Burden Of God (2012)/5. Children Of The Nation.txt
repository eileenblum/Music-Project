In the time, when the days of glory have arrived
The last in line have saved our sons
They've trained for years for their awards
To pay the price or die
They make you feel the kisses of their swords
Until you lie

You are the soldiers of another time
You are the ones
Who can save the future
You are the makers of another crime
Your are the ones
The children of the nation

Children of the nation...

Bring your flags, and sharpen your blades of steel
Face your enemies, cause in death they trust
Their blood will soil the furrows of your fields
In a sacred return to the dust
You prey to make your triumph becomes real
In a blind rage of lust

You are the soldiers of another time
You are the ones
Who can save the future
You are the makers of another crime
Your are the ones
The children of the nation

Children of the nation

Children, children...
Of the nation
