Why God, did you create
A world of innocents
In which, we're searching for a source of harmony?
When God, can you stop the chaos of your land?
Your heaven's not a dream, just heresy

And everyone is here
Calling out your name
Everyone will wait for the savior
Everyone is here
Oh entering your game
Everyone is drawn into your flame

Oh God, did you give us
Beliefs for legacy?
And then, do you know the holy war, you generate?
Haesus, can you end this hidden prophecy
And let us be the masters of our fates?

Everyone is here
Oh... entering your game
Everyone is drawn into you flame

And every stars are falling down again
And all the scars are driving us insane
And every stars are falling down again
The feel the scars...

And see the stars...
