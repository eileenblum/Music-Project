[Bonus Track]Afterlife...

Tommy's lost his mind
What he feels inside
Is too hard to carry on
He walks away
Like a blind
His life has no replay

Awaken his mind
He travels to the afterlife
Forsaken inside

Afterlife...

Tome walks alone
Staring at the skies
Wandering what's going on
He wanna pray
Say goodbye
Die another day

Awaken his mind
He travels to the afterlife
Forsaken inside....
