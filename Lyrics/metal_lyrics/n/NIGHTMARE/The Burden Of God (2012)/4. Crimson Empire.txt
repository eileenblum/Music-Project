There's a place where we can play the kings of fools
Where imagination lay down with no rules
There's a magic in this quest of paradise
We never give up cause we are the slaves of the vice

Dreams
Charmers
We're living in the wreckage
Liars
Deceivers
Living on the edge

Tease me
But never buy my silence!
Believe me
Follow my allegiance!
Save me
But never buy my silence!
Relieve me
Follow the allegiance

Of the crimson empire!

There are orgies into the court of the king
Where the naked whores are only seventeen
We are living in the garden of delight
We'll never get out 'til somebody will stop the night

Dreamers
Charmers
We're living in the wreckage
Liars
Deceivers
Living on the edge

Tease me
But never buy my silence!
Believe me
Follow my allegiance!
Save me
But never buy my silence!
Relieve me
Follow the allegiance

Of the crimson empire!
