"We're realizing a dream, but do we know, this future is unreal? Shall we fly on cyber skies in the eternal void? Are we becoming androids?
(The Dominion Gate - Part II) (Genetic Disorder: 2007)
(The Dominion Gate - Part III) (2012)...
Historians believe that Esther was the queen of Persia during the time of the Sassanid empire... but in face, she is the messenger of the apocalypse that will rise from the middle east... " The end of the world is near...and this is the end of the trilogy.]

[THE NARRATOR:] A riddle in the sands
Forsaken promised land
[ESTHER:] Beyond my realm, I'll be your queen of Hell
[THE NARRATOR:] A temple without laws
A grave for your dead heroes
[ESTHER:] And from my kingdom I will cast a spell
[THE NARRATOR:] No country can divide
[ESTHER:] But now the world is mine
[THE NARRATOR:] You please tell me why?
[ESTHER:] Cause I'm the chosen one

Leave me free, I'll never surrender
Please give me, a new life to wander
From long ago, you always bring me down
All the tales that you know....
We rape, enslave the world
The human race, you rape
Enslave the world, in my name I shape

[THE NARRATOR:] The coldness of the sun
The end has just begun
[ESTHER:] Ohhh I am here to light the way
[THE NARRATOR:] You spread your seeds of hate
Beyond your dominion gate
[ESTHER:] This is the only game that I can play
[THE NARRATOR:] Freedom in story lines
[ESTHER:] But only one tale is for life
[THE NARRATOR:] Your knowledge is confined
[ESTHER:] No! I rise and shine!

Leave me free, I'll never surrender
Please give me, a new life to wander
From long ago, you always bring me down
All the tales that you know....
We rape, enslave the world... enslave the world...
The humane race, you rape... there's no turning back!
Enslave the world... The picture is black... In my name I shape...
