Why me and you?
Does freedom has a price?
Shall I take you for a ride?
Will I find you
Beyond this borderline?
Cause every day my life goes on

Back to life
Or desillusion?
Live or die
In cold emotions

No way back from where I belong
Cause I've been waiting for so long
And you had no reasons to turn away
Yeah, you slammed the door without saying goodbye
I know that your promises were lies,
But it's too late for me to change this way

Back to life
Or desillusion?
Live or die
In cold emotions

Maybe you know
That after my love is gone
It's the time of the final outcome...

Back to life
Or desillusion?
Live or die
In cold emotions
Cause freedom has a price
Back to life
But never back home
Live or die
It's the final outcome
