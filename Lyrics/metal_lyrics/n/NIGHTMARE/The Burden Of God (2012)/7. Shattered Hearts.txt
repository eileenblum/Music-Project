I know that words are sometimes hard to say
I'm feeling that we're lost within a silence
When I see the fullmoon turning white to gray
Then I think its time for  us to hold the distance

Ghosts
Staring out
Breaking out
Our towers of stone
Ohhhh
You mesmerize
Stop your lies
And you'll be alone

Your distant signs of darkness
Are the oceans of my sorrow
But the time will fade my sadness
It's the key to save my soul...

Tell me lies if the truth only reveals your love
then I feel that I chance another romance
Tell me now another lie from above
Cause your freedom is the secret that we must enhance

Ghosts
Staring out
Breaking out
Our towers of stone
Ohhhh
You mesmerize
Stop your lies
And you'll be alone

Your distant signs of darkness
Are the oceans of my sorrow
But the time will fade my sadness
It's the key to save my soul...
