Tonight the underworld
is blowing up to the earth.
Without hope of any future,
in brimstone we will die.

[Pre-chorus 1:]
The witches sing their song
destroying our ears.
Pure raging heavy metal
from the lungs of hell.

[Chorus:]
Heavy metal outbreak! [x3]

We raise our metal banner
proudly straight to the sky
The bands are playing so loud,
driving us insane.

[Pre-chorus 2:]
The black serpent's poison
is running through our veins.
Pure raging heavy metal
to bang your head
against the stage.

[Chorus:]
Heavy metal outbreak! [x3]

[Solo: Ripper]
[Solo: Edison]
[Solo: Both]

[Pre-chorus 1:]
The witches sing their song
destroying our ears.
Pure raging heavy metal
from the lungs of hell.

[Chorus:]
Heavy metal outbreak! [x3]
