As I crawl to the shadows
the air is full of threat,
My instincts lead me,
someone will die tonight.
I can feel it, I'm restless,
I'm ready to explode.
The chase has started,
but I don't want to set me free.

[Pre-chorus 1:]
I'm trying to resist,
but my poison's flowing.
Oh God what I've done,
I don't want to be a killer.

[Chorus:]
Feel my high speed venom
As it burns in your veins.
Feel my high speed venom
As your lungs gasp for air.

The damage's done
and I have to creep out,
But this is not the last,
I know others will follow.
As I realize my crime,
so lethal, so fast,
My blood is growing cold,
but the threat is always there.

[Pre-chorus 2:]
I can't forsake my sins
and I bite once again
Oh God what I've become,
I'll burn in hell for sure.
