His journey has begun,
thy sword is by his side,
Both together fought in war,
his life was written in blood.
I take his place in the throne
because the king is gone.

[Chorus:]
He died into the battle
as gods ruled.
Within the Asgard realm
guided by the valkries' fly.
A place is waiting for him,
Odin proclaims his name.

Thy blood he bled to fight;
Thy crown and ring are mine.
His body burns in flames,
thy remains rest oversea.
The horns give their last farewell
Burning arrows cross the sky.

[Chorus]

[Solo: Ripper]
[Solo: Edison]

His journey has begun,
thy sword is by his side,
Both together fought in war,
his life was written in blood.
I take his place in the throne
because the king is gone.
