Oh Satan can you hear my call
from the foul world where I stand,
To light and guide my every step
with the power of your hand?

Open wide the gates of hell,
let the demons come and dance.
Break the spells that have you caught.
Some day the earth is gonna burn.

[Chorus:]
Come to us kingdom of fire.

My soul is damned and sold.
I've read the spells of death tonight.
I know the shades are lurking there,
where my minds and dreams are one.

Let us see your final sign,
when all high heavens will fall down,
Damnation tunes will toll the bells,
and the royal armies of the night
will attack.

[Chorus:]
Come to us kingdom of fire.
