This night is evil and moonless
And the shadows are blacker than ever
Lunacy is in the air
And the darkness will reign us forever.

[Prechorus 1:]
Tonight we shall prepare that rite
To free our father from this hell
Tonight we shall prepare that rite
with sacrifices in the dark.

[Chorus:]
Run away When hell is out of control
When satan is out.

All metal maniac is coming
To join our circle of fire
The portal of madness is opened
And now you shall run away for cover.

[Prechorus 2:]
Doing that ritual tonight
We sacrifice the crying ram
Doing that ritual tonight
Beware of us and hide your wife

[Chorus:]
Run away When hell is out of control
When satan is out.

[Prechorus 1:]
Tonight we shall prepare that rite
To free our father from this hell
Tonight we shall prepare that rite
with sacrifices in the dark.

[Chorus:]
Run away When hell is out of control
When satan is out.
