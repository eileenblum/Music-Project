When the bright in my eyes had gone away,
And the chance to see my flying forward
I forgot in the jaws of my doom.
Through the bitterness of my will
I could see that angel in black,
And her wings were ready to take me so far away.

This tired life I left behind.
No chains, no bounds to hold me anymore,
'Cause she was the mother of the night.
C'mon mistress of the dark.

I don't care if you're evil or good,
I only wish to touch your pallid lips
and lie forever in your mortal embrace.
But tell me Death why are you leaving me now,
I couldn't stand this solitude without you,
and to awake to an awesome sleep.

But I know soon we will meet again,
'Cause I've drunk your whisky and lost my mind for you,
'Cause you are the mother of the night.
C'mon mistress of the dark.

[Solo: Ripper]

Mistress, mistress. Take me away, take me away.
Tonight is the time. Hear my call from this hell.

[Solo: Ripper]

Mistress, mistress. Take me away, take me away.
Tonight is the time. Time to flee from this hell.
