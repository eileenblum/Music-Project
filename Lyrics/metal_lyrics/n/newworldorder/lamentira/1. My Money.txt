My money!
God!
Riding through the world, dead brain,
Shoeing nations, without God or pray,
With no pity, I devastate, I don't remember,
Illuminated I am, and I will scourge them!

I take a walk on the red carpet!
In the world, I am the king!

I rule to the rats in my throne...
To their, weak minds!

Forgotten without reason, dead heart!
The new order I am, without
God or pray!

In the sky, the ashes.
On the ground, the agony.
In mind, the memories.
In my hands, your brain!

The ashes!...
The agony!...
The memories!...
In my hands, your fucking brain! [2x]

Ruling...
I laugh...
New order...
My money!
