Death! (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)

In the deepest jungle
you can hear the Screams,
The death comes for you,
There is blood in your eyes,
You are damned to lose,
And they cut your life!

They cut your life!
Kidnapped from home,
They cut your life!
Forced recruitment,
They cut your life!
Damaged without reason,
They cut your life!

In the jungle, you remember your mother.
Bullet's... rain
that you are dodging.
Your childhood... runs off between hands.
Your toys... deadly weapons are now!

Wanting escape of the hard reality.
You try to imagine at yourself in a better place.

You're crying without imagining
That your short life
Will the end!

They cut your life! [2x]

At nightfall,
Your body remains inert,
A small life
Lost,
Because
Fucking ignorance's fault...
Of men!

Death! (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
