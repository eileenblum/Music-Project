[feat. Plini]I've been hearing you murmur about a thousand times.
The minutes are running like rabbits and I'm chasing words.
It's almost midnight,
You're probably already sleeping,
The sandman by your side.

So we'll meet in our dreams.

I've been far, for so long.
I swear, soon I'll be home.
If my heart is cold wrap it up please, warm me up.
I see the miles pass one by one on the rear-view mirror;
Driving, 'til the night's end, foot on the gas,
Leaving all the rest behind.

It's 5am and I'm miles and miles away from home.
Frozen.
Following the sings along the road.

I've been far, for so long.
I swear soon, I'll be home.
If my heart is cold wrap it up please, warm me up.
I see the miles pass one by one in rear-view mirror;
Driving, 'til the night's end, foot on the gas,
Leaving all the rest behind.

I miss your presence, I need you by my side.
I wished a thousand times upon these shooting stars to see you cross that door
'Cause I feel half alive since you're gone.
