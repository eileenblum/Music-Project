You're just a goddamn liar, playing a fucking a role,
bragging that perfect life you've never had.
The tables turn, kid.
I just can't wait to see it.
I wanna know what you are made of.
Oh

You just don't know who you are,
there's not much left of yourself.
How could you even see with your heart?
You can not see the whole world around.

There is no chance to..
..to cover this hole.
I can't see where your heart takes place.
There's nothing clear in this game you play and you're losing yourself.
Because you're living a lie,
you don't even know who your friends are.
Do you feel the gravity?
Just come back down.

Alternating the reality,
you heart is blinded by the that lies you told.
You want a life you'll never have,
leading yourself to your motherfucking downfall.
Open your mind to the world around
or you will never make it out alive.

You just don't know who you are,
there's not much left of yourself.
How could you even see with your heart?
you can not see the whole world around.

There is no chance to..
..to cover this hole.
I can't see where your heart takes place.
There's nothing clear in this game you play and you're losing yourself.
Because you're living a lie,
you don't even know who your friends are.
Do you feel the gravity?
Just come back down.

Open your eyes all your loved ones are faking.
You're getting caught up by your lies,
I just can't wait to see how this will end.
Oh, you'll never know how to animate
your empty heart.
You'll never feel that fire.

You feel nothing.
Your chest is empty, you can't fill this space.
Your heart is gone for good, leaving you loveless.
It's been a while that you're life is a mindfuck.
How the fuck could you live with yourself?

You're just a goddamn liar, playing a fucking a role,
bragging that perfect life you've never had.
Facing the mirror, you just can't be yourself,
feeling the reality slip between your fingertips.
