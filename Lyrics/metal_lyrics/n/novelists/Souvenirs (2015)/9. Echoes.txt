I'm always striving to see clearly
Through all my troubles
I need a break
This can't go on and on
I'm near from the breaking point
Get me out of my routine

My life is a mess
And if it's a little bit late to change it
Then how could I even change myself ?
... Yeah how could I change ?
I gotta believe in myself
Rely on my feelings

Just let me see the dawn
I'll find a way through the morning
A life for the night and some hope in this promise

My demons entertain me
When I'm haunted by all your murmurs
My mind tends to break (by itself)
I revel in illegible images

Oh, God is laughing like a fucking brat who plays over an anthill
Yeah, I do pray, I pray to stay outta reach (far from his eyes)
I sway with that bottle of brandy in hand
I'm alleviating my soul when I drift through the void

I have to say that all this is all making me deeply sick
It echoes in my head
To save things never been part of my plans so I should just play dead
But that's not my type

Even sell my soul won't make a difference
That's never ending (never ending)
I'll sing as long as I don't know where I'm going to end

Just met me see the dawn
I'll find a way through the morning
A life for the nights, a shelter in the glitter of all these lights
If you let me... see the dawn
I'll find a way through the morning
A life for the night and a meaning at all this

I'll find a meaning at all this
