Itâs getting harder to breathe,
Harder to feel free.
Itâs getting tougher to write,
Tougher to feel things.
Itâs getting harder to live,
Harder to pay bills,
Hard to feel alive.

Itâs getting harder to breathe,
Harder to feel free.
Itâs getting tougher to write,
Tougher to feel things,
I need help.
I feel sick of taking these pills.
Life must be sweet once weâre fucking dead..
Yeah, once weâre dead.

Sometimes I drown in the sound like trying to find the silence.
Lost in the noise of this world,
Show me the way through the darkness.
I gotta pay.. pay for a daydream.
Look at my soul,
Trapped with the bailiffs.
I might die, starving to death,
Biting my own tail again and again.
I canât hear myself think,
This fucking room must be talking âcause I can hear it.
I see me kissing death between these walls.
Life must be sweet on the other side.

I donât wanna pay for a fucking life that I donât want,
Because the rats get fat while the brave men die.
That ainât a lie.
Itâs sad to say but thatâs how the world fucking runs.
No, this is not for the money,
Put your doubts aside.
Music is not about filling a fucking bank account.
Thatâs what they want,
Not what we fucking wanted.
It makes me sick,
Sick of seeing motherfuckers ruling the world whereas it burns.
Sick of living in a world that I donât understand.
Amongst the wolves,
Sometimes I drown in the sound like trying to find the silence.
Lost in the noise of this world,
Show me the way through the darkness.

If Iâm a basket case,
This casket will welcome me with open arms like an old friend of mine.
Just like an old friend of mine.

Oh, I need a room to breathe.
No, I canât go on like this.

Itâs getting harder to breathe,
Harder to feel free.
Itâs getting tougher to write,
Tougher to feel things,
I need help.
I feel sick of taking these pills.
This life must be sweet once weâre dead.
Fuck.

Hell is full, donât you see?
Hell is full and weâre dragged into the depths.
Oh shitâ¦ Heaven doesnât exist.
We dance between the devilâs hands.
