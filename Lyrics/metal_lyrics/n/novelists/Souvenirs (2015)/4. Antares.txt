There's more to life than what could ever meet the eyes.
So don't take a step back,
The crowd's wild, and I'm ready to feed them.
They need this, a big mess.
I'll keep spitting in this mic 'til the feast's end.
I'm stressed out, but I breathe here.
Oh, I could die for this.

Can you hear me loud and clear now? (clear now)
Why can't you sing along?
Sing your fucking heart out.
I'm sure you'll make it out alive.
You'll make it out.alive.

This place is all we have, here and now.
I'd like to live this forever (forever)
I want to feel the ground once the bottle sounds hollow
The show is over.

This is all I'll ever have I guess.
This is all I've got to light my way,
And those moments are priceless.
I can't forget the miles, I walked.
I can't forget a single step..
Since I left the warmth of a "home".

I'm so tired to see that I have been mislead.
It was a long road 'round the core.
When your eyes devour me,
I think that my only will is to simply look alive..
'Cause I feel dead when I'm out.

I can't bear my heartbeats in my chest,
And my mind is such a deep mess
I can't stand to see
This fucking disaster the world made of me,
I'm so sick.

I'm just a man, a son of this pitiful world.
I can't feel the touch on my skin unless it burns.

Am I alive?

Can you hear me loud and clear now? (clear now)
Why can't you sing along?
Sing your fucking heart out.
I'm sure you'll make it out alive.
You'll make it out.alive.

This place is all we have, here and now.
I'd like to live this forever (forever)
I want to feel the ground once the bottle sounds hollow
The show is over.
This place is all we've got here and now,
It's time to let us be
Can you hear me loud and clear?
It's time to let us live.
