I left behind me the comfort of a normal life
Traded it all for my sake
I never questioned my choice, or even felt that I should
It's always crystal-clear

I spent more time in this room to write all this
Than with my family and all my friends
I traded my everything
To feel free to walk my own path

I won't be the one who forget his dreams
I'll make sure to remember them
I'll take a glance at the Earth
When I'll be on the roofs of the world

The dream will be mine
For now I wanna be the one who lead his life
I might have took the longest way to leave my dream
But every miles will bring me closer to it

I'll build it all of my bare hands
Will follow the sun on its journey
I wanna tame this heart which is mine
Feel that I'm leading my life

I hold the key in my hands

I left behind me the comfort of a normal life
Traded it all for my sake (I never felt a regret)
I never questioned my choice, or even felt that I should
It's always crystal-clear

These lines that I write are the mirror of my soul
Like a letter to this kid who played alone

Now... this kid do feel like a man
He bear the weight of his dreams
Stands just before your eyes
He found a meaning at his life

He wanna know...
He wanna know what this life can bring him
He wanna know where this road will lead
So take him away and show him places he'd never seen

I remember the promise that I have made to myself
The kid I was has grown up, but all his dreams stayed the same
The souvenirs of his words linger inside of my head
It's like crystal-clear

This is us versus the fate

I wanna know...
I wanna know what this damn life can be
I wanna see where the road will lead
So take me away and show me these places I've never seen

I left behind me the comfort of a normal life
Traded it all for my sake
I
