[Bonus Track]We all live different hells
Some might live with but some just can't
So why should I live a different way?
Yes, a different way

Already twenty years have passed and I still can't live at ease
Oh, come on, fuck it
They claim the fame, but all they give is a spit at our faces
When they're playing their bullshit

What does it take?
What does it take you to forget your pride?
What does it cost?
What does it cost you to pay the price?

It's not only a game based on what you reflect to others
Although they want it to be
I can swear to you that I am probably the most blamed
Because I shout those fucks I lived
Fuck your false feelings, your appearance
'Cause the best are often the most rotten inside
So I'll put the truth right in front of your eyes
Right in front of your hearts

Fuck your false feelings
'Cause the worst are the brighter inside
I'll put the truth right in front of your eyes
Until they dry from the inside out

From the inside out

I'm gonna prove to you
That we're all dying to make a place down here
We're all dying to make a place down here

It's not only a game based on what you reflect to others
Although they want it to be
I can swear to you that I am probably the most blamed
Because I shout those fucks I lived
Fuck your false feelings, your appearance
'Cause the best are often the most rotten inside
So I'll put the truth right in front of your eyes
Right in front of your hearts

Already twenty years have passed and I still can't live at ease
Oh, come on, fuck it
They've made the game, but all the need is a spit at their faces
When they play their shit

We all live different hells
Some may live with but some just can't
So why should I live a different way?
Yes, a different way
