IÂ´m going away.
IÂ´ll follow the sun on its journey
to lead my steps.
No matter the winds,
no matter the rain, IÂ´ll keep on walking,
IÂ´ll see where it ends.
I tried to live through these souvenirs.
I have talked to this man IÂ´ll never be and
wiped all of these tears.
I tried to be what they wanted...
To be the saviour theyÂ´ve called here.
But all i needed was to find my place.
