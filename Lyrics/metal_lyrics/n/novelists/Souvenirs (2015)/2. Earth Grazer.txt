Life ainât a gift.
Youâve grown up in the shit like most of us, mate.
You feel like dreaming awake.
Youâre staying distant from the man that you really are.
Itâs hard to swallow the pill, right?
I know.
You would have loved to deal with, without any problems.
Hey mate, we can see you through your fucking bubble.
Why canât you see the people right before your eyes?
You need a cure, a remedy to fix this all.
A remedy to your pain.
Youâre sleeping awake,
Dreaming eyes opened.
You do behave just like all these fucking sheep.
You hate it.

God ainât a shepherd. You followed the wolves in their den but youâre just a lamb,
Like lost in the woods.
The world will turn,
With or without you my friend.
Weâre only passengers.
We live then we die.
Youâre only wasting your time.

You better wake the fuck up.
Youâre sinking a little bit more in the depths of the mirage.
Do you wanna run away from this hell?
You need a cure, a remedy to fix this all.
A remedy to your pain.
Youâre trying to fit in this world where you live but youâre feeling like an outsider.
Just wake up. Thatâs a dream.
You are dreaming your eyes wide open.
Whatâs the fuck? Wake up.
Thatâs a dream.
You are dreaming your eyes open of your life.
Wake up mate, thatâs a dream.
You are dreaming of your life.
Wake up
Whatâs the fuck?
Wake up mate.
Wake up mate, thatâs a dream.
You are dreaming of your life.
Wake up
Whatâs the fuck?
Wake up mate.
