[Bonus Track]Those heartfelt feelings that I got
Are getting a hold of me
I gotta let them be
And this is why I need to tell you the things that I feel
How much it means to me
How much it counts to me

You were into my heart before it locked itself
You're all I can save from the shallowness
You're the key of my soul
But my soul is lost when love's a door that we fear to leave unlocked

Even the worst we've lived could never change my mind
You're bringing back the pulse in my veins
You've seen the the back of my mind
But now it's hard to mean something

I found this fire burning into your breast
This love has never been much brighter than what I could guess
The things we've lacked could have changed us
For a better version of ourselves

No matter what they can say
Or the price we might have to pay for this
They can't change the way that I feel
The way that I feel when you're away

There is always a way to cross all the miles
That will pave our fate
We just can't change
And the world can stop
I won't give a fuck
Cause I've got something that counts
And I will never let it leave

They spit the venom, I gotta take it out
Love is a hushed bird you shouldn't cast out
Well if it's meaning a break, they shouldn't have lied
Shouldn't have spent a whole night riding a fat ass
I can't feel a remorse, I can't have time to find why you're that addictive
'Cause a sad heart cannot fake feelings
It's not the first time that love is dead living

It makes me sick, cause all of the mistakes we've done
Were meant to make our path
Snakes will keep spitting
But we remain faithful to our beliefs

I'm so tired of these shits, no matter what
And how many times we've to rebuild on ruins
A structure that can hold us closely

No matter what they say
Or the price we might have to pay for this
They can't change the way I feel, they can't
Nor your place in my heart when you're next to me

Even the worst we've lived could never change my mind
You're bringing back the pulse in my veins
You've seen the back of my mind
But now it's hard to mean something

I found this fire burning into your breast
This love has never been much brighter than what I could guess
The things we've lacked could have changed us
For a better version of ourselves

The winter has passed
I was hoping you'd hold on through those nights in the cold
You don't know how much I'm hollow, how much I miss you
The summer is coming
I'm awaiting the day when I can finally take you home
'Cause this time I'm gonna show you
How much I love you
