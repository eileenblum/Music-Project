You wanna play the man, kid?
Arenât you afraid to play with the fire?
So letâs play this game.
Gimme your best shot or you will get shot.

Weâve been like bros you and Iâ¦
Oh, I know, Iâve been too nice.
All this time you lied like you breathe.
Fuck.
You lie like you breathe.

There is a place for you in one of these body bags.
You better watch your back.
Iâll slit your throat with the dagger that you left in my back.
You bastard,
I curse your life.
I curse your life.

Iâll put you inside the trunk of an old Cadillac.
Youâll be found dead in a bag,
Next to a foxhole.
Youâll be the star of the newspapers main lines.
I swear to change your life in a fucking hell.
