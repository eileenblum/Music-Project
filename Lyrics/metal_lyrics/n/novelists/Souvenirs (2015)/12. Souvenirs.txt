Let's go.

I know I can't define this life
I know you can't see through these answers I'm seeking for are way too deep to be found

My life's reflected through the wet film of my eyes (my eyes)
I've been betraying the kid that I was.
Do you think this life really deserves an anthem ?
Iâve been changing

It reminds me when I was younger and useless.
My heart beats, covered in bruises.
I saw this room slowly turn to a coffin.
As locked in, but I'm not dead yet.
I did my best to show you that I've been changing,
and what I've been through to see clearly through myself.
through myself.

I was such a mess before this
I don't miss it, no, I don't miss it.
My heart has braced itself.
I'll set this world in check,
I finally found myself.

I've got my dreams and all my memories in my head.
I don't wanna be the one who can live without this.
All that I can see is the distance since these days.
I wouldn't recognize myself without the mess of what I've done with my life

I will never let you define my way of.life.
I thought we've been watching the same sun but we're way too far to finally feel warmed.

this is my time to speak
this is the time to forgive.
I've been betraying the kid that I was.
Do you think this life really deserves an anthem ?

I didn't think the show would last so long
Though it should last forever now.
I was seeking for this,
having a chance to speak to try to feel better.
I see your face when your eyes are staring back at me.
I can fake it, it's not as hard as it seems with the detachment the drug brings

I've got these dreams to stand for,
got my voice to speak
despite the lies around me now
but this bitter taste that they're leaving won't let me feel anything. (delay feel anything)

It reminds me when I was younger and useless.
My heart beats, covered in bruises.
I saw this room slowly turn to a coffin.
As locked in, but I'm not dead yet.
I did my best to show you that I've been changing.
and what I've been through
to see clearly through myself.
through myself.

I was such a mess before this
I don't miss it, no, I don't miss it.
My heart has braced itself.
I'll set this world in check,
I finally found myself.

I've got my dreams and all my memories in my head.
I don't wanna be the one who can live without this.
All that I can see is the distance since these days.
I wouldn't recognize myself without the mess of what I've done with my life
