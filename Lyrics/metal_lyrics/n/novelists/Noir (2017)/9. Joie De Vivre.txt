It comes in like a cold wind
The spirit of the world we live in
I'm holding a wave
Go give it away 'cause...

Are we looking for the answers?
Or are we dropping to our knees and giving in?
I'm running again
Stop running away 'cause...
'Cause I feel exiled inside of my head
Existing through this vivid dream

Say that I'll feel the same (it's not your time)
Say that I'll feel the same
But it's now or never
And I keep running away
(Existing through this vivid dream)
I keep running away (it's not your time)

So I'm chasing the joie de vivre
Not really knowing how it works
I'm holding on a dream
Even if everything around me collapses

So turn and face your fears
Thoughts rise, your mind it clears
I feel it again, oh I feel it again
Because I thought I needed somewhere to run
Looking for home, like night for the setting sun
Oh I'm shining again, oh I'm shining again

Say that I'll feel the same (it's not your time)
Say that I'll feel the same
But it's now or never
And I keep running away
(Existing through this vivid dream)
I keep running away (it's not your time)
