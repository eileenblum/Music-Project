I'm so sick of these moments with you
Of staring at all these stars
Hand in hand like two liars
I swear sometimes I'd rather be dead
Just like the lights in your eyes
The lights of the town don't shine like they used to
How could I let this be?
Oh how could I let this be?
What have we got left except this long silence?
We're fading out as the night falls down
What have we got left expect this fucking distance that is standing
Right between us?

We're standing together on the edge like ready to burn
We're staring at each other, fade along the days (we're fading)
Denying a bitter end

Our fucking dance is endless
And sometimes, I'd rather be dead
I'd rather watch us fucking burn

Endless, our fucking dance is endless
We're dancing on our graves
I'd rather watch us...
I'd rather watch us burn

We're standing together on the edge
Denying a bitter end

We're standing together on the edge like ready to burn
We're staring at each other, fade along the days (we're fading)
Denying a bitter end

I've had enough of your fucking bullshit
To relive each of these lies
Hand in hand, like two liars
I swear, sometimes, I'd rather be dead
Just like this hole in my heart
My pain keeps growing like it used to
How could you let this be?
Oh how could you let this be?
What have we got left except this long silence?
We're fading out as the night falls down
What have we got left expect this fucking distance that is standing right between us?

Our fucking dance is endless
I'd rather watch us fucking burn
