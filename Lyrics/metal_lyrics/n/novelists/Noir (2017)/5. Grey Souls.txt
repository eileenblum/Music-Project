I see the eyes of a thousand suns
Staring at all these lonely beings of carbon
Lost in the desert of their souls
Seeking a meaning to their existence
A sense to their lives

We are the desperate souls
The children of a bottomless chasm
We are the shadow of a dying world

We're thousands, dead inside
No constellation in our eyes
Just dead stars
(My poor friends what a sorry state we're in)
You'll find no source of light
Nor any answers in our hearts
Just grey souls

To numb the pain devour the soul like a black hole
And let us fade along these monotonous days
We're broken, seeking a way...
Seeking a way out of this endless hell
Confined inside the back of our fucking skulls

We cower to hide from the light of the stars
Back into the mire
We're hopelessly drowning
Our evils meddle with each fucking day
This nascent fire will forever consume us

We're thousands dead inside
No constellation in our eyes
Just dead stars
(My poor friends what a sorry state we're in)
You'll find no source of light
Nor any answers in our hearts
But grey souls
