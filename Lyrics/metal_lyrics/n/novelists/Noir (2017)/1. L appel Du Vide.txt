I cannot explain this feeling I'm having
When I'm looking at these pictures
Yellowed by the sun
This weird emotion is sticking at my soul
It numbs me to the bones

These moments are battles I can't win

Everything that I love is killing me
And these lies won't save me any longer (can't save me anymore)
I've destroyed one by one every beloved thing
Right before my own eyes
Slowly but surely

One day I'll be part of the ghosts on your photographs
And you'll forget about me when other ones come

You will replace one by one every memories
They will fall away and merge in the afterglow

I cannot explain this feeling I'm having
When I'm hearing these hearts singing
Burdened by their dirge
This weird emotion that's echoing with my soul is all I ever feared

These moments are battles I can't win

Everything that I love is killing me
And these lies won't save me any longer (can't save me anymore)
I've destroyed one by one every beloved thing
Right before my own eyes
Slowly but surely

I'll never get used to this acrid venom
That's shooting through my veins
I'll never get used to this ice that stands beneath my skin
