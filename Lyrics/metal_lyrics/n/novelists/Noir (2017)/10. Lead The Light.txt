I've never really been proud of my life
I've made a lot of bad choices
But the chance that I was given helped me to change
You know I've been running after something I was dreaming of
And somehow it brought me the strength to still believe

I'm not holding any fucking answer about that life
Iâm just trying to live mine
Without putting my feelings aside
I keep on trying to find my place in this world

Let the light come in
Show me the way before the night calls me again
And if there's any price to pay
Then just take everything I have ever owned

I've never really been proud of myself
I've made a lot of bad choices
But the chance that I was given helped me to change
The pain is sticking to these songs
It seems to never leave
But somehow that is what has always defined me
