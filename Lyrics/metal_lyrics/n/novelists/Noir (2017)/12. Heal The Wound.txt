Teach me to face what's lurking deep inside
I'm crashing down right before you
I feel broken, I feel downed
With my face against the ground
My heart is weighting me
My icy soul is afire

I'm running after bliss
'Cause I don't know what it tastes like
But I'm not blaming anyone, no
I'm way too much detached now
Insensitive to your words
And each time that I'm alone
My fucking conscience tells me:

"You're feeling sick of trying
Of trying to bury the reason
Of trying to heal the wounds in time
You wanted to...
To learn to love this feeling
That's raging in your soul."

Teach me to face what lurks within my heart
I'm crashing down right before you
I'm always hiding behind this smile
The smile on my face
So no one's gotta ask me if everythings okay

Just read between the lines
I'm wishing that you can see
My sky ain't bluer than yours

I'm way too much detached now
I think I'm too far gone
'Cause each time I'm feeling lost
My fucking conscience tells me:

"You're feeling sick of trying
Of trying to bury the reason
Of trying to heal the wounds in time
You wanted to...
To learn to love this feeling
That's raging in your soul."

I'm feeling sick of trying
Of trying to bury the reason
I wanted to...
To learn to love this feeling that's raging in my soul

I've learned to love the thunder, until the sun comes back
I've learned to love this rumble that haunts my mind
It's never ever easy
But I hold onto these lines
I've learned to love this black cloud that haunts my nights
