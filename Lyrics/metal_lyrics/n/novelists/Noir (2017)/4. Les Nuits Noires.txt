I woke up again, from this recurrent nightmare
The night has never seemed so dark
I'm being swallowed by the abyss
My life, like brought back to the ether
My shadow is getting bigger
And there's nowhere to run

Get me rid of this chronic pain
That drags me through the coldest hell
There is not much left of who I've been
I just cannot stop dreaming of the end
I can't stop and it's killing me
It's fucking killing me

Someday I might find out where the bliss lurks
Caught in a web of lies
I found out that the truth can hurt
Just like a blade, a knife
I'm about to let go
I just can't do this on my own

The pain is haunting my nights
I'm fucking scared of what tomorrow could be
And each time I try to face the light
I just don't fucking feel it

Oh please father show me a sign
The devil starts to sing for me
The light begins to fade away
I fear for my fucking life

Someday I might find out where the bliss lurks
Caught in a web of lies
I found out that the truth can hurt
Just like a blade, a knife
I'm about to let go
I just can't do this on my own
