I'm so scared of living my life in vain
I'm always always craving for better vibes
My hands are rough, my soul is heavy...
But they've always held me down
When my whole life was going south

The three last years might have changed my life forever
Now I just wanna break free from these towering walls
To get this grey out of my mind
(Just once and for all)
'Cause when I'm here alone with the silence, I can't feel whole
No, I can't feel whole

You know
The road has always been the same
But the world is changing
I am lost
Lost amongst the days I'm living
I'm dreaming of a brighter way

I've placed my heart on an altar
Have set my soul ablaze
In hope to save me from myself

Oh you know we may walk under different welkins
But when I'm drowning in your eyes

I can feel that I am not alone anymore
With the stranger

That I see into the mirror
Not alone with my fucking pain, again

So don't let me...
Don't let me think my life is vain;

I'm so far from seeing the life through their heart shaped glasses
I'm always always craving for better vibes

'Cause the world is mad, the world is crazy
And it keeps bringing me down
Each day my life keeps going south

The three last years might have changed my life forever
Now I just wanna break free from these towering walls
To get this grey out of my mind
(Just once for all)
'Cause when I'm here alone with the silence, I can't feel whole

Show me the fire, ignite me
I'm feeling so cold
I wanna know why I'm aching
Look in my eyes, tell me what you see
I'm feeling so numb
I need a sign to keep on fighting

I need a sign to keep on fighting
Don't let me live my life in vain
I need a sign to keep on fighting
Don't let me live my life in vain
Don't let me think my life is vain
