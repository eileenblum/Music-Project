Look in the mirror &amp; turn into me
You make me alive &amp; I make you bleed
Neither for money nor for a god
Hey, you know it's all about blood!

All you want to know is the meaning of life
A right time to kill and a good way to die
I give it to you - in exchange for your blood
Neither for money not for a god

There're legions of madman bonded by chains
Loosing all faith and forgotten their names
Never mind the death just never mind
Pray for suicide live for suicide!

Look in the mirror - do you see the shattered face?
Empty eyes keep the question inside hidden place
There's in you a destructive seed
You make me alive &amp; I make you bleed

We're slaves of blood we're murderers of god
With no tomorrow, we feel so proud
Proud to be a witness of collapse and Holocaust
Don't care 'bout anything we're totally lost"
