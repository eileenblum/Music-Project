I will create new world
By My wish
For restoring the flash
I've enough
Revitalizing the creatures
The ones are his
Imaginations with corpses
I realize

Reviving my creatures
I'll pack this world
Will embodied fancies
Under sun, that's cold
An my staunch legions
Will settle vow town
That has the walls and towers
Are stretching to the heaven

My beings are made by that
I've done with them
And roaring rivers has been filled
With stinking cold blood
Thear's light is crushed and screams
Are filled with pain
In universe I have reduced
To the constructions, to inlay

My beings are masterpieces I joined
From the flash
The souls of them were flying to hell
By your wish
The mechanism of flash revived them
They re bore
And now each one burns with vengeance
To you.
BEWARE!!!

Reviving my creatures
I'll pack this world
Will embodied fancies
Under sun, that's cold
An my staunch legions
Will settle vow town
That has the walls and towers
Are stretching to the heaven
