Spread the hatred - recipe for living
Smell the hatred - it is filling the air
Try to live without this feeling
I promised you - it drives you insane

Fuck with hatred - fuck 'till you're bleeding
Bleed with hatred - a perfect passion!
I hope you know life is a kind of killing
I hope you know there is no objection

Fuel for progress flame of history
Reason for compromise, dying in hysteria
Those who are free of hate, what do they get instead?
We breathe with hatred we are a new breed!
Nothing's sacred -
Only hatred!

Blessed by hatred - a holy tyrant
With every murder is becoming a god
Mass salvation through pain &amp; dying
For supreme aim we pay with blood

Pray with hatred - take frankly praying
What heaven are for you for them means death
If success costs a life - kill without doubt
So I believe with hate we breathe

Those who are free of hate, what do they get instead?
We breathe with hatred we are a new breed!
Nothing's sacred -
Only hatred!
