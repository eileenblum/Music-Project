Are you driven by pain? It's a never-ending game.
Are you begging to disorder waiting for a slaughter
I am the only key to all your desires &amp; dreams.
I will satisfy your lust &amp; explain what it means.

I am the keeper of pain that drives you insane.
I am the wish master who leads you to disaster.

I know all your secrets that you try to conceal.
I explode your mind and let them reveal.
I'm deep inside of you &amp; see right through you.
I can make your twisted dreams come true.

(You know that) flesh needs flesh &amp; lust is looking for lust.
We'll be a part of this game until we turn into dust.
You can fool yourself or try to break free.
I always will be near to make you bleed.

I am the one who shall free you of chains.
I am the one who doesn't need "Jesus saves".
Life seems like a road to the end of all dreams
Through your pain, desires &amp; scream.

(You know that) flesh needs flesh &amp; lust is looking for lust.
We'll be a part of this game until we turn into dust.
You can fool yourself or try to break free.
I always will be near to make you bleed.

I know all your secrets that you try to conceal.
I explode your mind and let them reveal.
I'm deep inside of you &amp; see right through you.
I can make your twisted dreams come true.

(You know that) flesh needs flesh &amp; lust is looking for lust.
We are part of (this) game until we turn into dust.
You can fool yourself or try to break free.
I always will be near to make you bleed.

I am the keeper of pain that drives you insane.
I am the wish master who leads you to disaster.
