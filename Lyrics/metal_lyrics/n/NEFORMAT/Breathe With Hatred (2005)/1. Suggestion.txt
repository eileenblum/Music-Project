Do You know the pain?
Do You feel the hate?
Welcome my friend
To the world we made

Full of misanthropy
And distaste
Do You have any questions?
Welcome to the quest!

It's neither a protest
Nor a call
Just how I see
What drives us all

Do You know the pain?
Do You feel the hate?
Welcome my friend
To the world we made

Intolerance Indifference Lie Commandment Me, Myself &amp; I
