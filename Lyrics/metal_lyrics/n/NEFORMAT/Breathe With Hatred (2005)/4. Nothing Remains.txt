Nothing remains
There is no God
No another life
It's a cold fact

Nothing remains
Everything dies
Hopeless truth
Makes you wonder why

Grave eats your flesh
Heavens swallow your soul
Fear of emptiness
You're forced to hear calls

From the other side -
Or just a fear within?
Blessed are the blind
Knowledge is the skin

There is no chance
To correct the mistake
All the pain you gave
With hate I take

Nothing remains
Nothings Nothing
No one to escape
No one No one
