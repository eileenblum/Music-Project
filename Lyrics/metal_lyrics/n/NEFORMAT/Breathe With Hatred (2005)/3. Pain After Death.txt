Pain is a line that separates
All your passions from all that I hate
Electric impulse heats up your vein
I give you salvation in torments &amp; pain!

Pain after death - like a blessing
Pain after death - agony missing
A naked nerve is what you're looking for
Tear off the skin - fuck the bleeding whore!

I see how you're dying
Pain turns into pleasure
It reflects in my eyes
Death is a true measure
For all of the temptations
Twisted desires
When flesh falls down
Soul flies higher

Pain after death - it's like a blessing
Pain after death - agony missing
A naked nerve is what you're looking for
Tear off the skin - fuck the bleeding whore!

Your flesh becomes a piece of fried meat
There's something that seems incomplete
Pervert solution - taste my rage
I know you will like this outrage

Feed my hate &amp; swallow your blood
As it flows down right in the mud
Pervert solution - taste my rage
I know you will like this outrage

Pain after death - like a blessing
Pain after death - agony missing
A naked nerve is what you're looking for
Tear off the skin - fuck the bleeding whore!
