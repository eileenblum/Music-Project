Terror serpit inter ordines orcorum 
Silva ante eos incepit tremere 
Sub terra gelida Charcharon procedebat 
Contra eos dispelans transitu eius omnia res 
Adesti cum omnia sua vi demum apparet...
Nigra maxima species vomens flammas 
Coperta aculeorum incepit igni concremare 
Configgere et vorare 
Exercitus dehiscit 
Orkian ruinosum equum conscendit 
Educatus nanis in spelunca iam dudum 
Figens in eius oculos gladius 
Inundans sanguine inter ululatum belvae 
Terram infra positam. 

[CHARCHARON (DEVASTANTING RAGE)]

The wood in front of them starting to shiver 
Under the cold ground a Charcharon proceeded toward them, 
Eradicating everything at his passage. 
Here he comes to reveal himself in all his power. 
An enormous black figure, vomiting flames, 
Covered by auculeses, starting to incinerate, transfix, 
Tear to pieces, 
The army flaked off. 
Orkian, jumped on the back of the devastating steed, 
Trained by dwarfs in the caves since hundreds of years, 
Thrusting, into his eyes, his broadsword, 
Flooding with blood the ground below between 
The screams of the beast.
