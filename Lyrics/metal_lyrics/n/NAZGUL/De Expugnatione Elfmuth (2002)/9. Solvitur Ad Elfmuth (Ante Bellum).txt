Extremos orcos scriptos ab copiis 
Septentrionis Kazh-Ran 
Navigii parati erant ad solvendum 
Versus Ruid-Dor sinus Elfmuth 
Theatrum supremi certaminis designatum 
Blasphema caterva ad litus 
Ex collibus ubi appropinquant 
Naves bellicae soloturae 
Intus horum servi suos dominos 
Nigris armant 
Sanguine eorum loricis adversariorum 
Defendentibus eorum 
Aura corpora atra convoluta ac sagis 
Eorum signa ferentibus. 
Nave profecta ornata capitibus principum 
Princeps remigium tempus remorum 
Pulsu metitur nanorum 
Qui a Roze-El ducti 
Templum Eldril destruxerunt 
Arcanorum artium peritissimi 
Nunc cruore manant strigitu 
Mille scuticarum quae eorum 
Duram cutem lacerant. 
Et eorum dolor, aegritudo, sudori, sanguinis 
Permixtus lembum propellit 
I portum argentatum quo sol 
Iam lassus se conduit. 
Omnia parata ad proelio sunt... tympana 
Metiuntur magna itinera orcorum 
Ac hominum deformum pugnae aviditate 
Cupiditate sola contentionis 
Ordine procedunt sub caelo cinereo onusto odiis 
Sicut domini impiarum animarum 

[THEY SAIL TOWARDS ELFMUTH (BEFORE WAR)]

When the last ogres were recruited 
By the troops of north Kazh-Ran 
The warships where readied to set towards Ruid-Dor, 
Heart of Elmuth, designated as the theatre of the last battle. 
A blasphemous horde, from the hills, 
Goes to the coast where the warship are ready. 
Inside, the servants 
Arm their lords with armours 
Now black for the blood of their enemies 
And protecting their bodies 
Wrapped by a black breeze 
And mantles bringing their insignia. 
Sailed the warships 
Adorned by the skulls 
Of the contrary princes 
The scout stresses the time of the row of the prisoners dwarfs 
Who destroyed Eldril's temple 
Master of mysterious arts, 
Who now are bleeding at the sound of thousand whips 
Which tear their skin and pain and suffering; 
The blood mixed with sweat pushes 
The ship towards a silver sea where a tired 
Sun plunged. 
Everything is ready for the battle 
The tympanums stress the forced march of ogres 
And trolls 
Eager for fighting just for pleasure. 
They parade under a grey sky 
Full of hatred like the Damned's Master.
