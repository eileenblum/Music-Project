Per multos annos sex lunarum ordinem et collocationem 
exspectaverat 
Et tandem suum iter finem habuerat...
Erat sub radicibus montis Ghor-Ad 
In cuius cacumine magnifica domus regia eminebat. 
Cum in eam irrupisset eius cognoscendi cupiditas et imperii 
aviditas 
Usque ad ianuam cellae funebris eum pepulerunt...
Duo sarcophagi positi in medio loco 
Conclavis illustrati nigra flamma. 
Incipit declamationem versuum turpium 
Excitans flammam magis magisque ingentem 
Dum magus vomitans blasphemias instabat 
Duae nigrae imagines habitibus bellicis apparverunt...
Domini Mali 
Quomodo miser homo poterat eos continere ? 

[HULTH-GARTH (He Who Summon Deads' Souls)]

For years he had waited the six moons falling into line, 
And finally his journey ended...
He was at the feet of the Ghor-Ad mountain 
On the top of which raised the majestic castle. 
Once entered his thirst of knowledge and his desire of power 
Pushed him to the death chamber 
Two sarcophagi in the middle of a room illuminated 
By black flame. 
He began to recite abominable verses, 
Animating the flame stather and stather 
To the pursue of the necromancer vomiting oaths. 
Two black figures in war clothes materialized...
He had freed "The Lords Of Evil". 
How dare a poor human being think to be able to 
Control Them?
