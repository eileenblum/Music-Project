Creeping through the darkness
Searching for your mind
Evil all around you
Battles all the time
The Earth trembles slowly
It's only just begun
Which way will you go
At the end of time
Your body begins to shiver
Got no where to run
Raging battle surrounds you
With no where to hide
No more laws to follow
Your axe is in your hand
Which way will you go
And the end of time
Enemies gather around you
You thought were your friends
Memories of your life
Confused through your head
As you take your last breath
All that's left is your soul
Which way will you go
At the end of time
