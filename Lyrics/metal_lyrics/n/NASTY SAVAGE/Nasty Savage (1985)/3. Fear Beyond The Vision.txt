Climbing up the mountain
In the preasence of
Anger, pain, and hunger
The trek is never done
I'm not from, this time and place
I'm not of the human race
I've been watching till this time
My arrival is no crime
Eyes percieve the sigil
Shown upon my chest
The penece bearing reapers
Reject Lord Vulcan's quest
Oh...Oh...OhOh.....
Fear beyond the vision
Approach all who have gathered
With mesmerizing eyes
There's no one that can see him
He's telling many lies
I will be his servant
But imprecate his word
No sign of magic power
No act of treachery
Learning all his evil
He weakens to my trust
As I plot my overthrow
His death becomes my lust
Oh...Oh...OhOh.....
Fear beyond the vision
My army stand awaiting
They won't make it through
The prophecy that I possess
Tells me what to do
Oh...Oh...OhOh.....
Fear beyond the vision
