Turn up the mayhem, turn up the night
Felling so crazy, I love to fight
Time to put on your studs and leather
Time to go out into some heavy weather
Metal knights-live on
Metal knights-rock is gone
Metal knights-stand proud
Metal knights-posers will die
I prowl the streets, looking for sin
Found my steel, so I'll go to length
Too many rockers, posers, and fools
Must have fun, to break all their bones
Metal knights-live on
Metal knights-rock is gone
Metal knights-stand proud
Metal knights-posers will die
You said you had, mayhem in your blood
Last night proved understood
You were thrashing you do belong
Listen to me you can't go wrong
Metal knights-live on
Metal knights-rock is gone
Metal knights-stand proud
Metal knights-posers will die
Metal knights
Metal knights
Metal knights
Metal knights
Wage of mayhem
