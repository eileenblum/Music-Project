I direct your leading role
You're making a scene
Isn't the act that I've created
Fit for a queen
Nightmares in disguise
I've got the rein
Spinning the wheel to choose your way
You can't remain
You can find it in your brain
Another fool for a game
Opened eye another lie
You can find it in your brain
Another fool for a game
What you feel-is it real
Cutting scars healed before
With no control
Left in pain there to cry
A darker soul
You're just a pawn in games of war
That I command
Senseless moves that goes to prove
What I demand
You can find it in your brain
Another fool for a game
Opened eye another lie
You can find it in your brain
Another fool for a game
What you feel-is it real
When you feel a warm breeze blow
On a cold winter night
The instagator alters your mind
Makes you feel he's always right
You felt my presence in your sleep
I'm never seen
Waking up to look for me
And so it seems
Crystals crack before they shatter
Don't let go
Fluent pranks, evil seduction
Don't say no
You can find it in your brain
Another fool for a game
Opened eye another lie
You can find it in your brain
Another fool for a game
What you feel-is it real
