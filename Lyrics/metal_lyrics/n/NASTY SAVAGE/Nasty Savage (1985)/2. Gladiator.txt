Born to fight, fight to kill
Day and night, night and day
Active force, threatens you
Deadly weapons, metal gear
Persue with force
Protect your soul
Dedly demons destroy the weak
Violent creatures stare at out
Approach the victim
The worthy survive
Gladiator!
Hatred, sin, lust, and fear
The ways of life are revealed
Armageddon, is not far away-THRASH!
Bodies struggle, flesh and blood
Dred the battle, corruption begins
Live or die, another day
No self control, I am insane
Gladiator!
