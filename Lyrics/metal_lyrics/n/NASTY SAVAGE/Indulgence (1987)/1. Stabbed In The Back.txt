[Music - Ben]
[Lyrics - Ben]

Living for the unknown
Only searching for trouble
Cheating and stealing from your best friend
No more job, all you do is no good

Running from the police
For stealing a car
Mug a lady of a hundred and five
That only has a dime

Who's the next victim-stabbed in the back
Terror, doom, destruction-stabbed in the back
Misleading lies-stabbed in the back
Who's the next victim-stabbed in the back

Evil thoughts cross your mind
As you buy a gun
Rob a supermarket
Leaving no visible trail
Shoot and kill a man
For a twenty dollar bill

Causing misgrief to all the women you meet
Don't even know who's your son
Giving blood as a donor
Knowing that you have AIDS
Always think you're right
But you're really wrong

Living for the unknown
Only searching for trouble
Cheating and stealing from your best friend
No more job, all you do is no good

Parents don't want you
Pay for you to leave the house
Frustrations grow stronger
These past few days

Who's the next victim-stabbed in the back
Terror, doom, destruction-stabbed in the back
Misleading lies-stabbed in the back
Who's the next victim-stabbed in the back
