[Music-Dave]
[Lyrics-Ron]

Forbidden fruits are the sweetest
Your true messiah
Is frightened by shadows
As he tries to unwind
Whispering ruins
Irresistable illusions

A coin in the well is a wish
Serve and suffer, scorn for scorn
Things could be a lot worse
When you think your down regressions
Take a look around
Razorblade maze
Shelter from your pain

There's a cyclone in your mind
It's throbbing at the end of a lie
But here and now
Life is a great indulgence
Hell is paved with good intentions
But this is our time of joy
Play with fire, love the flame
But this is our time of joy

[SOLO-Dave]
[SOLO-Ben]

Before the wild wind's whistling lash
The starred storm cloud rared on high
Singing songs to please myself
All at once things seemed so small
Your grief and mine must intertwine
Indulgence
Indulgence
Indulgence

[SOLO-Ben]

My eyes trace the horizon
Winter brings another death to a year
Give a free course a choice
It it's denied it's more intensified
Shades of blue or just the shadow of the mind
Suffered death but could not die
So here upon my back I'll lie
Gaze my fill into the sky
