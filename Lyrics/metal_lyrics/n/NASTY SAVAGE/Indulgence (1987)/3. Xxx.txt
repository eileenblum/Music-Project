[Music - Dave]
[Lyrics - Ron]

Take a trip, down lover's lane
Take that trip, it's time to play
Adult entertainment, you must be of age
Come and get wild, climb out of your cage

XXX
Triple X

You feel like your under the spiked heel
The crack of the whip brings great thrills
She soars to heights loves her delights
The foreplay is gone, the seduction is on

She's the ultimate pro who puts on a show
As she had me tied she moleste my mind
Exciting herself, I could have cried
Now I know, she loves to be wild

XXX
In her pants

[SOLO-Dave]
[SOLO-Ben]

You took a trip down lover's lane
Now you're gone, you wont be the same
Cinema fantasies, night clubs and shows
All the women, you never can know
