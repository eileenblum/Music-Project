[Music - Dave]
[Lyrics - Ron]

Eight forces of change
Hidden knowledge you gain
Time present, time past
Are both here in the future
Problems of life
Through divine channels
The melting of opposites
The purpose remains
Symbolize the shimmering water
The wheel of the law
It's destiny
Rejoice with neither fear nor favor
The inquisitor's artwork is not what it seems

Lovers sought to divine
Winning the affection of their beloved
Six parallel lines with enigmatic sayings
Unbroken traditions, it's a game of chance
An unending journey through the sky
Unfolding the story so precise
Your answers, hopes, and fears
For what you don't expect

Deal the advisory message
This is the ritual of divination

[SOLO-Dave]
[SOLO-Ben]

Deal the advisory message
This is the ritual of divination

Themes of renewal you may rejoice
Though triumph may bring it's own defeat
Confusion of your misery
Confirm the reading already taken
Search for the answer of the ressurection
Rejoice with neither fear nor favor
The inquisitor's art work is not what it seems

Deal the advisory message
This is the ritual of divination
