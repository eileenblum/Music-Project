Poles lie twisted in the ruins of Warsaw's shattered
line
The Wermacht's strength has left it's mark with
lightning speed and power
The West responds uneasily to face another war
The Axis lords plan their assults for their territory
gains

From frozen arctic wastes the battle rages in it's
fury
To blazing desert sands the land is overrun with blood
On land and sea in the air the swords of nations clash
The West is stabbed with a vicious blow and writhes in
agony

BLITZKRIEG

Continental Europe falls under Axis occupation
But England stands unfalliable despite a constant rain
of fire
The Deutsch Luftwaffe fails as the RAF stands strong
So the Fuhrer's eyes look to the east to Russia's
endless plains

The Russian's lines collapse as panzers smash the
Eastern Front
But far too large a battle feild ends all hopes for
victory
Outmatched buy vicious weather, Moscow's walls remain
secure
And an army's strength and might lie dead and frozen
in the snow
