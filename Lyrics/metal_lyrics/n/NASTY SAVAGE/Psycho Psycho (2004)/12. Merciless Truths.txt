Uncommon valor
Is a common
Virtue
Eternal disguise
For all you
Despise
A large slice
Of life
For sake of
The eyes

Merciless truths
It was a
Master plan
Define the realm
Of the cycle
Of man
Eternal disguise
For all you
Despise
A large slice
Of life
For sake of
The eyes

You hate the
Excellence
You can not
Attain
Psycho psycho
Its inside
Your brain
You loved me
For no gain
At all
But to rejoice
And triumph
In my fall
Those who know
Do not speak much
Those who speak
Do not know
He has observed
The golden rule
He has become
The golden fool

[solos]
