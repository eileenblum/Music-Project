Becon the crucifix
Behold now show the sign
Hate your enemies
A tongue of fire
The flames of hell unleashed

Open the gates
Of the infernal empire
Break away from all your
Convictions
Believe in what's best for you
Within the flesh
The carnal desire
Within the soul
Woe onto them
Without pity
Death defiant
A standing menace
To all
That is true
Pontius Pilate
He washed his hands

Did you know
How to sell your soul
Do you know
How you lost control
Sorrow and suffering
Served with temptation
What you need is
Aggravation
Becon the crucifix
Behold now show the sign
Hate your enemies
A tongue of fire
The flames of hell

Hell Unleashed
Hell Unleashed
Hell Unleashed
Hell Unleashed

[guitar solos]

Keep your friends
Close
Your enemies
Closer
The four crowned
Prince
The betrayer
Of man
Keep your friends
Close
Enemies closer
Challenge the wisdom
Of his
Thorn torn brow
Within the flesh
Carnal desire
Within the soul
Woe onto them
Invocations
In the brains
Of those
Who's respect you
Have gained
