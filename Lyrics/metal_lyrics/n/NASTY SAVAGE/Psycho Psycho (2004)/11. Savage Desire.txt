The raging desire
That burns inside me
A spiteful intent
That makes me wild
So heavy
I can't describe it
Yes I've had it
Since I was a child
It takes me higher
Savage desire
Down to the fire
Savage desire

The garden of
Temptation
Is always there for me
Sex, lust, evil,
Is all that I seek
Yes, I have to have it
Where have you been?
Bang your head like
A gypsy of sin

[chorus]

To wish or long for
Crave and request
A serious temper
Sexual appetite
A medieval prince
In the darkness of night
Who burns with fire
It takes me higher
Now I know
I have a savage desire

The raging desire
That burns inside me
From out of the fire
I try to get free
But it pulls me down
Under the ground
Don't worry mommy
I'll be safe and sound

It takes me higher
Savage desire
Down to the fire
Savage desire
