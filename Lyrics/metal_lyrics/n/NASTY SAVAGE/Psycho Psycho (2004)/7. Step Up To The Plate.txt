Your mind is a
Laboratory of an
Illusion
Jack of all trades
Master of none
Isolation of your
Anger
Perception of
Hopelessness
Lots of debt
And no regret
No plan in life
Is set
A guarantee to
Disagree
Leads to a
Killing spree
Discipline to no one
As you
Load your gun
Never will you listen
A future in prison
Lies manipulation
Promises deception

Step up to the plate
The past is full of hate
Step up to the plate
Before its too late

[solos]

Disfunctional alcoholic
Master of disaster
Take a good look
Hate is what you are
After
The excuse book is full
No more time for the lies
Talk is cheap
Action replaces words
Lies manipulation
Promises deception

Step up to the plate
The past is full of hate
Step up to the plate
Before it's too late
