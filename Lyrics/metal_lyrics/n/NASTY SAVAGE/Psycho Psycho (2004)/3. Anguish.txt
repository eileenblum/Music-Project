Enter at your
Own risk
Down the spiral
Staircase
Flesh, blood,
Muscle, mind
The sword
You live
Is the sword
That you die
Broken promise
Turning point
In cold blood
Paranoid
To see a
Laguna sunrise

Forget the
Spiral
Staircase
It takes you
To the
Wrong place
Now that you
Have the
Time
You want to
Know
What's in my
Mind

Anguish
Cross road in life
Hard to decide
Anguish
The sword that
You live
Is the sword
That you die

[guitar solos]

Anguish, Anguish
Cross road in life
Hard to decide

Anguish
The sword you live
Is the sword
That you die
Anguish, Anguish
Flesh blood
Muscle mind
Anguish
The sword you live
Is the sword
That you die

[guitar solos]

Anguish
Extreme pain inside my brain
There's no sinner
Like a young saint
Anguish
Stop this ride
Who can you trust
Anguish
Dragged threw the years
Into the dust
Anguish
Extreme pain
Inside the brain

Enter at your own risk
Down the spiral
Staircase
Flesh blood muscle mind
The sword you live
Is the sword that you die
Broken promise
Turning point
In cold blood
Parinoid
To see a
Laguna sunrise
