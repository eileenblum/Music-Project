Slave of passion
With a cerebral
Erection
Devoid the risk
Of unconscious
Aggression
Vice of the virtuous
A haunting specter
Her own obsession
Was a throbbing
Rapture
Slave of passion
With a cerebral
Erection
Devoid the risk
Of unconscious
Aggression

Christ like in blue jeans
The morning after
Always unusual like a psycho thriller
Listen to the silence
Can you hear the sound between words
Give me new birth, back upon the earth
Give me new birth, back upon the earth
Psycho sexual, psycho, psycho,

Obey your impulse
With sensual seething
Carnal knowledge the chains of being
Vice of the virtuous
A haunting specter
Her own obsession
Was a throbbing
Rapture
Slave of passion with a
Cerebral erection
Devoid the risk of
Unconscious aggression
Self loving hunger adorns ever more
