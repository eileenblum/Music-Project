In god we
Trust
That's what they say

Work that job
To earn
Your pay
40 hours
Another week
The rush
To get there
Every day
To punch the clock
Its
Ticking away
Your late my friend
One more time
And not again
12 months
Another year
You have fallen
Into
The system

In god we trust
That's what they say
Ballistic missiles
Point our way
Cautious spending
EPA, spy networks
CIA exposure levels
Justice weighs
Whatever happened
To my 401 K?
A costly state
No fixed return
That's the plan
The betrayal system

Betrayal System
Betrayal System
Betrayal System
Betrayal System
Betrayal System
Betrayal System

[guitar solos]

In god we
Trust
That's what they say
When play dies
It becomes a game
No one near
To hear your
Screams
Except the killer
Of
All your dreams
Stroke the cards
You dealt
Yourself
Amidst plenty
You will perish
Trodden under
Cloven hoof
The chains of being
Your in the
System

Betrayal System
Betrayal System
Betrayal System
