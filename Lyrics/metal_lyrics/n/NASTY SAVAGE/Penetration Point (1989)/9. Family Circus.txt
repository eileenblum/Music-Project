There's a way it ought to be
And there's a way it is
Love and hate at the same moment
Never agree about anything
Not another broken promise
No such thing as privacy
Screaming at the top of your lungs
To get someone's attention
Life is often difficult
Another miserable child
No one ever changes
This routine never ends

Family circus, daddy's little lave
Family circus, he'll put you in the grave
Family circus, mother wants to run away
Family circus, another unpleasant day

The dog got ran over
And he's still OK
The cat jumps on the table
And starts to eat your dinner
Little sister's pregnant
Brother got put in jail
Mom screams and yells at her kids
Dad screams and yells at her
A holiday is here
A day of guilt and grace
Grandma keeps telling you
How it was in her day

Family circus, arguing every day
Family circus, not another emotional wave
Family circus, it keeps going in circles
Family circus, even when you're old and grey

Kiss and hug a relative
You hardly even know
Affection, attention, concern
Is never shown around here
A psycho babysitter
Took the dog for a walk
Oh! Not another lecture
You can't make your own decision
Go out and get a job
And cut off all your hair
Or work at the garbage dump
And keep playing guitar

Family circus, endless frustration
Family circus, yelling and aggravation
Family circus, the dog never stops barking
Family circus, he just wants to take a walk
