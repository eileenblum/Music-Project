Organized sanctuary
Perfect alibi
Of the frenzy
Spawn watcher
Self disorder
Spring silver
Autumn gold
In it's wake
To be set free
The morning after
The story was told

You ate up all
The flattery
You received it eagerly
Harmony lies hidden
From the
Immoral exhibition

Hellbender
Despirate culture
Shutting the windows
Of your dishonest soul

Waste away
How amusing
Behind our eyes
No escape
You face looks
Hard and strained
Elusiveness
Ate up all the
Inheritance
Chew and swallow
Have a meal
You're not funny anymore

Take your broken wings
Learn to fly
The deeper you go
The harder you try
Search for perfection
Varying dimension
Terrified suspicion
Answer lies hidden
Like a seed
In the Earth
You ate a sin today
Just like yesterday
What's wrong with yourself
Or is it someone else
Take back
What you said
You are lying
Like in bed
The mirror looks at you
It says you are the fool

Sin eater
Loves to eat the sins
It's where the fun begins
Inside we are all the same
Eat your words everyday
Who is right
Who is wrong
To tell someone
How to sing their song
