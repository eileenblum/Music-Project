Ding dong
Is anyone home
Welcome to the block
Notice
I didn't knock
Where're you from
Were you in Vietnam
Or were you
Smart enough to duck
What about
Something for lunch
By the way
What do you weigh
You must come to my church
I know you'll
Give and give
So welcome to the block
On Saturday mornings
I mow the yard
Saturday mornings
He mows the yard

Welcome wagon, welcome wagon
Won't you be my friend
Welcome wagon, welcome wagon
Till the bitter end

I'd like to go back
To SaoPaulo
South America
Down in Brazil
Then it was off
To Rio De Janeiro
I was still thinking
About SaoPaulo
The beautiful beaches
Of Ipanemia
Wasn't long
We saw the Tonga
Over the mountains
Through the jungles
On our way to
Humberto's place
South America down in Brazil

Welcome wagon, welcome wagon
Won't you be my friend
Welcome wagon, welcome wagon
Till the bitter end

No one is home
Next time
Leave a message
On my telephone
Can you hear
Scottish bagpipes
On LSD
Listen now
Take a Ride

Don't you remember
From back in '83
You had a crush
On me
Now you wont look my way
Just yesterday
I won the lottery
Now you remember
Follow me
Like a cat
I'm with the In crowd
Drive a Rolls Royce
Let the butler
Take your hat
Whoever thought
Reality could be a dream
Just yesterday
I won the lottery

Welcome wagon, welcome wagon
Won't you be my friend
Welcome wagon, welcome wagon
Till the bitter end
