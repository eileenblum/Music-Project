Never know what you're doing
Don't know where you're going
Wondering where you're at
Can't remember where you've been
What are you going to do
Don't know when you'll do it
You don't really know how
You would rather let things go
Can't make up your mind
Trapped by indecision
Confusion surrounds you
Chaos all around

No established system
No such thing as goals
Never have a plan
Lacking direction
Constantly forgetting
People's names
Not saying what you mean
Not getting to the point
Wandering around
Everywhere you go
Calling up the locksmith
Cause you lost your keys

Never understanding
The ones you love
Is it real
Or just for money
Unexpected moments
Always around
That look you have tells me
You're just rather puzzled
