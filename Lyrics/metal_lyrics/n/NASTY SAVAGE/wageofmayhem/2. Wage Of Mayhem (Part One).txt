Get on the bus
Take a ride with us
We're going to the old school
Brandon town
Is where the scene
Went down
It started as a nightmare
Cow pastures
The Golden Mug
Who could forget
Ruby's Pub
Get on the bus
Take a ride with us
Is everybody in?
The underground
Heard our sound
Get on the bus
Take a ride with us
We're going to the old school
Thunder from the Shark
Off the wall with Austin
Ice Man Ben
Richard was slamming down
Me you see
I'm Nasty

WAGE OF MAYHEM
Don't mess with
WAGE OF MAYHEM
My TV
WAGE OF MAYHEM
WAGE OF MAYHEM

Studs and leather
Heavy metal
Banging your head on the stage
Thrashing with break neck speed
Slam dance
Take a chance
Knock someone off their feet
Stage dive
Stay alive
While dodging security
Smashing and thrashing
Than we were at
World War Three

WAGE OF MAYHEM
Don't mess with
WAGE OF MAYHEM
My TV
WAGE OF MAYHEM
WAGE OF MAYHEM

Hell yes, mayhemic destruction
Not nice boys
Savage
Coin in the well is
Indulgence
Carrying on a tradition
Abstract reality
What was the
Point of penetration?
Figure it out and see
Get on the bus
Take a ride with us
Going to the old school

WAGE OF MAYHEM
Don't mess with
WAGE OF MAYHEM
My TV
WAGE OF MAYHEM
WAGE OF MAYHEM
Is everybody in?
