A bad excuse
Is worse than
None
Cynical domination
Sanctified
Corrosive minds
Struck down by
Hit and run years
Cynical domination
Sanctified
Corrosive minds
Unreason for empty
Fiction
A living thought
With blazing scorn
Is worse than none
Sardonic Mosaic
Sardonic Mosaic
Sardonic Mosaic

Wise man
Ever wish
You were younger?
Death has no advantage
As it comes as a
Stranger
He's taking a picture
Painting a picture
It doesn't seem clear to me
A sinister master piece
Be careful
What you wish for
That's what you
Might receive

Anguish and Hatred
Sardonic Mosaic
Serve and Suffer
Sardonic Mosaic
Anguish and Hatred
Sardonic Mosaic
Sardonic Mosaic
Sardonic Mosaic

So let this be
The post script
To wishes that come true
Don't bame it
Better it
Leave it if it won't mend
Should you be warned out
Competing with
Fleeting fame
Face it out
Live it down
A bad excuse
Is worse than none
Jealousy
Is as cruel as the grave
Sardonic Mosaic
