The tides rise
The tides fall
A crash of thunder
The storm rages on
Some say the world
Will end in ice
Some say the world
Will end in fire
She has tasted
The sweet desire
And she chose the fire

All the angel sees
Turns to black
The sun burns her eyes
Her body burns
Disappears like smoke
A wild bird flies
Free from the darkness
She came
Messenger of evil
She is satans sister

Unchained Angel
Tell you lies
Unchained Angel
Mortal disguise
Unchained Angel
Wings of fire
Unchained Angel
Is just a liar

The tides rise
The tides fall
A crash of thunder
The storm rages on
Some say the world
Will end in ice
Some say the world
Will end in fire
She has tasted
The sweet desire
And she chose the fire

Unchained Angel
Tell you lies
Unchained Angel
Mortal disguise
Unchained Angel
Wings of fire
Unchained Angel
Is just a liar
