The raging desire
That burns inside me
A spiteful intent
That makes me wild
So heavy
I can't describe it
Yes I've had it
Since I was a child

It takes me higher
Savage desire
Down to the fire
Savage desire

The garden of temptation is always there for me
Sex, lust, evil,
Is all that I seek
Yes, I have to have it
Where have you been?
Bang your head like
A gypsy of sin

It takes me higher
Savage desire
Down to the fire
Savage desire

To wish or long for
Crave and request
A serious temper
Sexual appetite
A medieval prince
In the darkness of night
Who burns with fire
It takes me higher
Now I know
I have a savage desire

The raging desire
That burns inside me
A spiteful intent
That makes me wild
So heavy
I can't describe it
Yes I've had it
Since I was a child

It takes me higher
Savage desire
Down to the fire
Savage desire
