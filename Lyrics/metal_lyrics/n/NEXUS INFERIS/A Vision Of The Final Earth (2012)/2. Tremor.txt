A contrary wormhole to a pitch-black sideÂ 
Dissociative and falling into dependanceÂ 

At the helm of God's dystopian kingdomÂ 
Modern man stands in awe of tomorrow's deathÂ 
Son of sin with not a vague memory of virtueÂ 
His conscious is burning in divisionÂ 

(Outside there is nothing - Just as inside)Â 

This war has breached the core of manÂ 
My sprit is (the) resistance levitatingÂ 
Chao! In the hemispheres - Survive the blastÂ 
I feel the Tremor now!Â 

Subvert - The ghost of silent as the priest is deadÂ 
Fallout - The pillars &amp; reason tremble in the eye of...Â 

Space observing the Earth collapseÂ 
Echoes! How they haunt the ruins of the city (as it)Â 
Serenades the last contact - Tyranny! EraseÂ 

(This war has breached the core of man -Â 
My spirit is the resistance. Levitating)Â 

Birth of the silicon meridian!Â 
Synapse (and) proceed! The blood transforms to hydrogenÂ 

I feel the Tremor now!
