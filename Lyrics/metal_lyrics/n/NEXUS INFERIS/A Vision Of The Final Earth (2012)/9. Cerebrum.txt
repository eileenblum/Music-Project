Bring this creature to life!Â 
Design a nightmare - Into the real worldÂ 
A winter has possessed (all) timeÂ 
In the pressure our spines...Bend and break!Â 

Wave and pulse - Alone in a black hole!Â 
Atom bomb depression! A surrogate is the new manÂ 

The terror will divide the future! A terror will divide the Earth!Â 

Bursting the sky wider-open!Â 
A womb replete with flames!Â 
Conceived nuclear-genesis!Â 
A womb - Reserved for graves!Â 

Cerebrum: Processing the atom bomb!Â 
Bring this creature into the real world!Â 
Cerebrum: Processing.Â 
Bring this nightmare into the dream!Â 

Soulless and naked!Â 
Out of the static we rise now - Abused and alone!Â 
As we control nothing!Â 

Marvel in perspective and pray for the last time!Â 
Glazing the optics. Born and resurrected!Â 

This cold and distant continuum!Â 
Naked! Soulless!Â 
Out of the static - Immerges a new sun!Â 
The winter surpassing - OVER!Â 

One thousands suns bursting the sky!Â 
Iâve become death! Destroy the worlds!Â 

One thousands suns - Bursting the sky!Â 
This place will feel thy light!Â 
I have become death â Destroy worldsÂ 
An angel by my side!Â
