It channels through these thoughts into this placeÂ 
Glimpse not into another spaceÂ 

Receiving the archonsÂ 
The choir sings only note to discordÂ 
Communion of macrobesÂ 
Dark archons they retain their holdÂ 

Fuelled by knwoledge to reach themÂ 
Edict that breaches the soulÂ 
Reside in the final secondsÂ 
Reside in the finalâ¦Â 

Receiving the archonsÂ 
The choir sings only note to discordÂ 
Communion of macrobesÂ 
Dark archonsÂ 

The supernatualÂ 
Pulsating relentless of mineÂ 
And nothing left behindÂ 
Open through my conscious one last timeÂ 
And nothing left behindÂ 
Open through my conscious one last timeÂ 

Become the black iconÂ 
Channel through these thoughts into this placeÂ 
Glimpse not into another spaceÂ 
Become the black iconÂ 
Enochian vers fills the vast cosmosÂ 
And through my conscious one last timeÂ
