In a vision of the final EarthÂ 
Stands a man in condemned isolationÂ 
Though human in formÂ 
This fares nothing man than a maskÂ 
On the face of a machineÂ 
A digital soulÂ 
To manifest the futureÂ 
Significance lost...Â 
In a vision of the final Earth!Â 

Zero! OutsideÂ 
Both man purpose re-definingÂ 
Although it's hereÂ 
You'll never see it!Â 

The techno-Christ evolving. The program isÂ completeÂ 
To manifest the future - TODAYÂ 
A digital soul emerging. Zeros out weigh the oneÂ 
Synthesized and deceasedÂ 
A vision of the final EarthÂ 

Blackout! The heavens are weaponizedÂ 
Design! The time has come - TechnologyÂ 

Stands a man in condemned isolationÂ 
Although human in form this fares nothing man than a maskÂ 
On the face of a machineÂ 
A digital soulÂ 
To manifest the futureÂ 
Significance lost...Â 

In a vision of the final Earth!Â 
Walking though cities and urban rustÂ 
Surplus energy fields swarming at nature's pulseÂ 
Hordes of beings hard wired in ecstasy and screaming with guiltÂ 
Until there's no trace of thoughts just data...Â 
Inside the human skull!Â 

Cities! The plug is pulled - The spine is fused!Â 
Circuit! The shell consumes the silent ghostÂ 

Forces inside this being are vane and fewÂ 
And as I exit the worldÂ 
The reflection is voidÂ 
The mirror is manÂ
