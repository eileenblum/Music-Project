Where have all the great skeptics flocked?
Have preachers even begun to open their eyes?
Truth is so difficult to accept
The Dead Sea scrolls dethrone the lies
Gehenna burns with misrepresentation
Hell fires burn in the mind only
Clinging to their cross in desperation
Hoping that their faith is not undeserving
Dissection of testimonial scripture
Tells stories long twisted by time
Mountains of maladjusted logic
Wasted on the minds of insignificant fools
To the four corners of the earth
They spread their seed and their fallacy
Overtaken by a lack of foresight
Blinded by the urge to believe
Our warfare lies not in the slaughter of the flesh
Thought is the axe in this battle
Attack where the heart is the weakest
Disconnect oneself from the physical world
To the four corners of the earth
They spread their seed and their fallacy
Overtaken by a lack of foresight
Blinded by the urge to believe
So much chaos surrounds christiandom
How can one argue with a blank stare?
The intricate workings of an insane theology
Difficult to penetrate with principle or reason
Discussion and debate leads to frustration
To the sky I raise my first accursed
Damn this whole fuckin' world of slaves
Why waste my words tanting ignorance
To the antediluvian polytheistic pantheons
I give praise to all that is NOT Christian
Freed by my wisdom and foresight
Isolated by my contempt with society
Discussion and debate leads to frustration
To the sky I raise my fist accursed
I must share oxygen with this fuckin' world of slaves
A waste of breath, a waste of energy
Remember the church and for which it stands
Lies to suppress what parades on it's lands
History and knowledge have suffered the loss
There's been only Christian, he died on the cross.
[Repeat]

They drink the blood of their Nazarene
The symbolic rite of human sacrifice
Feasting on the flesh of their saviour
An ancient cult addicted to power
Thirst for blood
Deceitful love
The child condemned
History penned
Fallacious virgin goddess of purity
The bastard child condemned for all eternity
Muth and history penned by fanatics
Biblical bigotry precedes common sense
Thirst for blood
Deceitful love
Fallacious virgin
The Christ condemned

"Wherever there are walls I shall inscribe this eternal accusation against Christianity upon them.
I can write in letters which can even the blind se....I call Christianity the one great curse,
the one great intrinsic depravity, the one great instinct for revenge for which on expedient is sufficiently poisonous,
secret, subterranean, petty-I call it the one immortal blemish of mankind."
[The closing paragraph from Friedrich Nietzsche's "The Antichrist" 1895]
