Set all your dreams to go
Wake up wondering
Where you are in time
I find
No better place to go
Somewhere wandering there
I see the one
And I run, I run, I run

Here by the waterfall
Sweep my troubles all
Downstream
There at the riverside
Every tear I've cried
Washed clean
Please take my sorrow far from me

Dust never makes a sound
It creeps until your heart
is black and blind
My mind
Never knows how to rest
If I could have some peace under the sun
I'd run, I'd run, I'd run...

Here by the waterfall
Sweep my troubles all
Downstream
There at the riverside
Every tear I've cried
Washed clean
And I'll forever know I'm free
And I'll forever know I'm free
