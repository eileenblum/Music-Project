Agenda
My beautiful agenda
The one that never dies

I'll shout it in a megaphone
I'll wear it like a french cologne
I'll scream it in the telephone
Hey, hey, hey

Agenda
My beautiful agenda
To give it all away

It's shocking as a shooting star
It's crankin' like a cable car
It's sweeter than the cookie jar

Hey, hey Joe
There's a place I know
Where the grace won't blow away

And everything is fine
In the summertime
And the battle lines are grey

And everything is fine
In the summertime
And the battle lines are grey

Remember
My beautiful agenda
I'll sing it to the skies

It throws you like a boomerang
It frees you from the chain gang
It's every song you ever sang

Hey, hey Joe
There's a place I know
Where the grace won't blow away

And everything is fine
In the summertime
And the battle lines are grey

Hey, hey, hey

Hey, hey Joe
There's a place I know
Where the grace won't blow away

And your train's on time
In the summertime
And the battle lines are grey
