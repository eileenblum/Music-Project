Leave it all behind you
Time to let it go
free the chains that bind you
Let your heart go and follow the call

With every beating of my heart
Every moment of my soul
Like the air surrounds the earth
I'm engulfed in who you are

But at times we find ourselves
In a place where it all comes down
And it seems there is no hope
And forever we're falling

Far and away
There we will be
It's all there for the making
If we'll only turn the key
Close as your breath
filling it all
So reach across the moment
And come following the call

Just as life can break your heart
And I know how you feel today
If you dare the dream you'll find
When all you've got you just give away

Far and away
There we will be
It's all there for the making
If we'll only turn the key
Close as your breath
filling it all
So reach across the moment
And come following the call
Following the call

Leave it now
You know it's time
The grief you need you're feeling
But your feelings don't define
Who you are
You're more than your mind
So reach for the connection
Leaving everything behind

Leave it all behind you
Time to let it go
Peace will surely find you
And let love shine a light on us all

Leave it all behind you
Time to let it go
Free the chains that bind you
Let your heart go and follow the call
