You called me forth amid the waves
And wayward waters
That kind of trust I've never found
I always wind up sinking down
Was I really dead
And at the bottom of the ocean?
Stay the course I heard you say
But all I saw was the long way...
Down

Now I feel like I'm alive again
Spread my arms upon the open wind
Yeah, I feel like I'm alive again
Crashing away like breath upon my skin

The wounded warrior
Has no temporary shelter
Chasing down an enemy
That always lurked inside of me
Finally he killed
What he had come to think was his quarry
The man whose heart was like the sea
Was gone and he would never be found

Now I feel like I'm alive again
Spread my arms upon the open wind
Yeah, I feel like I'm alive again
Never looking back to where I've been

I can see the light
Burning in my soul
I can see the light
I know that I must go

The king of surprise
In the boredom queen
Went out to dine at the bottom line
Drinking blood red wine

The jack of all trades
And the master of none
Set out to get back at most everyone
It's not too late to get free
There's something more you used to see
Get back to where you used to be

Fly away
Lost in the place I'm dreaming
I wanna hideaway
Gone forever
Flyaway
Far from the silent screaming
I wanna hideaway
Gone forever

Daughters of angst and wretched rage
Pulled a sword from the stone
Like Al Capone
As the king of pain goes insane
Where the Pope of Rome
Meets the pope at home
And the nicotine stain goes unexplained

Fly away
Lost in the place I'm dreaming
I wanna hideaway
Where I can't remember
Flyaway
Far from the silent screaming
I'm gonna hideaway
Gone forever

Locks on a box
Holding inside
Face in a mirror
Seems to disguise
The boy at the door
Who I was before
Is more than I'll ever be

The sun kissed the day
I was well on my way
I'd love to just love you
But I've no time today
The man that I saw
Who could stand on the sea
Was more than I'd ever be

Sometimes
In the dark night of my soul
In the corner of my life
I see the man inside

Morning again
The sun shining in
The boy from the sad side
No chance to win
Has walked through the door
To something much more
More than I'd ever be

Sometimes
In the dark night of my soul
From the corner of my life
I see the man inside

Now I find
He is making my dreams alive
In the brightness of my day
I can see the man inside

The wounded warrior
With no temporary shelter
Had lost the will to stand and fight
To the enemy that lives inside

Now he's on the run
Because the King of angel armies
Has come to bring the dead to life
And quench the darkness with the light

Now I feel like I'm alive again
Spread my arms upon the open wind
Yeah, I feel like I'm alive again
Never looking back to where I've been

I can see the light
Burning in my soul
I can see the light
I know that I must go
