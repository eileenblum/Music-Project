I'm on top I'm flyin'
Down I go I'm cryin'
Help me please I'm dyin' now
(Screamin' from the mountain top)

Rollercoaster love it!
No one can control it
(fallin' from the mountaintop)

She tries to keep me on the ground
When I'm racin' ahead she says slow down
But this is my way of living

It's a grand experiment
Using every element
It's a grand experimental life
It's a grand experiment
Here it comes now there it went
It's a grand experimental life

Set me free I'm screamin'
Midnight rambler's creepin'
Morning comes I'm feeling fine
(Screamin' from the mountain top)

She's like the secret sauce
Come into my chaos
Together we're somethin' divine
(Stronger than you'll ever know)

Round and around and around it goes
But where it stops nobody knows
I still have no idea

'Cause it's a grand experiment
Using every element
It's a grand experimental life
It's a grand experiment
A well planned bizarre event
It's a grand experimental life
It's a grand experimental life

Round and round and
Around it goes but
Where it stops nobody knows and
Round and round and
Around it goes and
This is LIFE!

It's a grand experiment
Using every element
It's a grand experimental life
It's a grand experiment
A well planned bizarre event
It's a grand experimental life
it's a grand experiment
Using every element
It's a grand experimental life
It's a grand experiment
Here it comes now there it went
It's a grand experimental life
