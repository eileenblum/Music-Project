I am no one
I hide outside
I must stay in the darkness
'Cause the sun, it burns my eyes
The scapegoat leaves the people shout [Lev 16:22]
With songs of mercy ringing out

But I am lonely
And dead inside [Eph 2:1]
Clearly God doesn't love me
So I'll just wait outside
Watching the procession pass
The glory streams to earth at last
