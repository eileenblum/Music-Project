I see a man with hair as white as wool [Rev 1:14]
Whose tongue's a sharp-edged tool [Rev 1:16]
With feet like burning brass [Rev 1:15]

"Come", he says,
"I'll be your guide of sorts [Psa 43:3]
Into the outer courts
I have made a way [John 14:6]

For the unclean ones
to come into the gate [Heb 9:24]
To the weakest ones
I will give my strength [Isa 40:29]
And the lowest ones,
they will be brought higher [Isa 40:4]
Let the unclean ones
be washed in the fire" [Mal 3:3]

I am afraid I'll stay where I am
But the Spirit takes my hand
and gently leads me in [Rev 4:2]
There is the laver; He drops me in the bath
It's like a sweet heart attack [Rom 8:11]
And I hear his voice again...

Let the unclean ones come into the gate 
To the weakest ones I will give my strength 
And the lowest ones, they will be brought higher
Let the unclean ones be washed in the fire 

Sweet elation come on, come on
I'm part of the Holy Nation [1 Pet 2:9]
And the past is forever gone
Wash and see the looking glass [Ex 38:8]
Second heaven's coming fast

Seven candles so bright, so right [Rev 1:13]
The incense burns on the mantle [Rev 8:3]
As we eat the bread of life [Num 4:7, John 6:35]
And in third heaven's Holy Grail [2 Cor 12:2]
Awaits behind the final veil [Ex 26:33]

After all with our backs against the wall
We seek the temple of the living God
After all with our backs against the wall
We seek the temple of the living God
We seek the temple of the living God
