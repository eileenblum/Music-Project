Here I am more or less a man
Second rate, the last in line
One of life's little twists of fate
But here I stand
the unaccepted man [Neh 1:9]
At the temple gate...

Sometimes I sit and wonder why
I was born
When everything that I touch
Seems to turn out wrong
Though I'm a mistake
There must be a place I belong

But I'm outside looking in [Luke 15:14]
(Life looks so easy, they all seem so happy)
Yes, I'm outside looking in
(And everyone's pretty but I feel so ugly)
I'm all alone without a friend
'Cause I'm outside looking in

The plan was laid
I guess I was made this way [Psa 51:5]
I've tried before
but I just can't seem to change
Still my heart longs to belong
I wish there was a way

But I'm outside looking in
(The beautiful city â they all seem so happy) [Eph 2:21]
Yes, I'm outside looking in
(And everyone's pretty but I feel so ugly)
The celebration will begin
While I'm still outside looking in

Oh, I'm outside looking in [Gal 4:26]
(They make it look easy to love and be happy)
Yes, I'm outside looking in
(I'm cast out and ugly and nobody loves me)
Oh, nobody knows me now I'm outside looking in
(The beautiful city â they all seem so happy) [Num 24:5]
Oh, nobody sees the ones outside looking in
(And everyone's pretty but I feel so ugly)
Oh, nobody knows me now
As life goes on for them
I will stay here in my sin
'Cause I'm outside looking in
