A million people in the sun
A million people waiting for the one [Lev 16:34]
One solid reason to go on
One star that's solid as the Sun

One pillar burning in the night [Num 9:16]
One man steps into the light
One went in with a mighty shout
All wait to see if he'll come out [Ex 28:35]

It's a sacrificial sojourn [Psa 50:5]
It's the bomb, it's all the rage
As the cloud fills the temple [1 Kings 8:10]
The wonder of the age

In a world filled with people
There was only One
Who could stand in the presence
Solid as the Sun
Solid as the Sun
Solid as the Sun

A stranger had no place to stay [John 1:11]
A stranger made it all the way
Not once a year but every day
Now we can go â he made the way [Eph 2:6]

But it's a sacrificial sojourn [Psa 48:9]
With our God at center stage
As the cloud fills the temple
With the wonder of the age

In a world filled with people
There is only One
The High Priest of the kingdom [Heb 9:11]
Solid as the Sun
Solid as the Sun
Solid as the Sun

It's a sacrificial sojourn
With God center stage
As the Spirit fills the people
The wonder of the age

In a world filled with temples
We can all be one [1 Cor 12:13]
As we stand in the presence
Solid as the Sun
Solid as the Sun
Solid as the Sun

But before you enter in
Nothing more can begin
All the darkness that we choose
Lay it down it can't be used
Burn it in the fire
Burn it in the fire, burn it down
