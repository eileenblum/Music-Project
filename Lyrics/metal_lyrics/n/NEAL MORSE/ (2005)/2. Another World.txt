The tent of meeting at the center and the tribes are camped around
With the banners of the living creatures sticking right out of the ground
The brazen alter and the laver are before the Holy Place
Like Moses did upon the mountain he will meet them face to face

So sanctify every boy and girl as we step into
Step into, step into, into another world.

As you enter in the courtyard there's a smell of sacrifice
Reminding all the holy people they must pay the highest price.
It's like I'm staring out a window into another world
Where the lamb is sitting with the lion
And the beast protects the girl

My soul projection is a flyin' now
As I step into, step into, step into, into another world
