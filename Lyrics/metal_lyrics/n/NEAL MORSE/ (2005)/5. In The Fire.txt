But before you enter in nothing more can begin
All the darkness that we choose, lay it down it can't be used
Burn it in the fire

You can't offer up your guest you can't get by with second best
If you try to sneak away, the list is long the price you'll pay
Burn it in the fire
Burn it in the fire
Burn it down

Long before I came this way I thought the world would see my way
But I didn't see all the danger signs
Long ago and far away I missed the boat I went my way
And I turned into the other kind

Peter says don't wonder why when these fires come to life
Don't look down and don't think twice
You are now the sacrifice

Burning in the fire
Burning in the fire
