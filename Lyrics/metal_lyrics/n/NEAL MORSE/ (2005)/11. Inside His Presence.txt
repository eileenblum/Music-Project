And in this place of gold [1 Kings 7:50]
The ancients walked this road
There is no death [2 Tim 1:10]
There is no time [Ecc 3:15]

There is a love unknown [1 Pet 1:8]
There is a scent of home
A rainbow wreath [Rev 4:3]
A blazing throne

From a grave of stone
to a world unknown
From the smoke and ash
comes true life at last [Isa 61:3]
Among earth and sod
the very life of God is here [Rom 8:11]

From a list of laws
seeing all our flaws [Rom 8:3]
To the blind, the lame,
we are all the same [Acts 10:34, 35]
Our High Priest has come
to make us all as one in Him [Gal 3:28, Heb 4:15]

The temple of his throne [Acts 7:48]
Is now not made with stone
Your very heart is now his home [1 Cor 3:16]

He will come and live if you'll only give [John 14:23]
Him a place inside that the world can't buy
And the Holy Place is now face to face in Christ [Heb 9:24]

When he died and was born
the temple walls were torn [Mat 27:51]
And God's Spirit poured out to all the ones without
Now the temple of the living God is you [Eph 2:21, 22]
The temple of the living God is you [Rev 3:12, 1 Pet 2:5]
