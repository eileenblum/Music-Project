Sweet elation
Come down, come down
And bring a new sensation
All around, all around
A cloud of secrets fills the air [Ex 40:38]
As the lines are blurred
between here and there [Heb 9:24]

Mercy, mercy
Look on, look on
He's gone behind the curtain [2 Sam 7:2]
Where no one's ever gone
His face is shining like the sun [Ex 34:29]
Our great return has now begun [2 Cor 3:18]
