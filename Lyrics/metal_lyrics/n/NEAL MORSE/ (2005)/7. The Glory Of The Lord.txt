And the glory (2 Chr 5:14)
And the glory of the Lord
Shall be face to face
And the glory
And the glory of the Lord
Shall dwell in this place
And the Spirit
And the Spirit of the Lord
Shall be like a cloud
Be ye holy
And the Spirit of the Lord
It shall fill the house
It shall fill the house
It shall fill the house...
