And then after all, with our backs against the wall
We seek the temple of the living God.
And outside the gate the cripples sit and wait
To see the temple of the living God
To see the temple of the living God

Suffer, trespass, stranger redeemed
Leviticus 21:18
The blind, the lame, the flat nosed,
superfluous
Broken footed on burning sand
The Priest, the seed, the blood stained hand
The leper testifies and turns to dust

And then after all, with our backs against the wall
We seek the temple of the living God
And outside the gate the cripples sit and wait
To see the temple of the living God
To see the temple of the living God

Oblation, vows, the promise of faith
Atonement, the wine, oil and cakes
The sheep, the goats, acceptable in his eyes
The maimed, the blemished, the scurvy scabbed
The creeping things, the firstborn lamb
Avail his presence in the house of sacrifice

And then after all, with our backs against the wall
We seek the temple of the living God
And outside the gate the cripples sit and wait
To see the temple of the living God
To see the temple of the living God
