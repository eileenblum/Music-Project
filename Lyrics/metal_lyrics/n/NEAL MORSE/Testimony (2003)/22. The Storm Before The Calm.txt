I can't let go, I can't let go
I want to let go, I want to let go
Help me!

Princes, Principalities, legals and legalities
They have no more power before us

There's a light that we can see
There's a new reality
Can't you feel he's reaching down for us

Come on in the water's fine
It's ok to take the dive
Strike the harp and join in the chorus now
