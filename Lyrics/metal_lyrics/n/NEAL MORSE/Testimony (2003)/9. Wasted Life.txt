Hearts can turn away 
And the roots of bitterness can carry the day 
And I was done, it was over 
I'd become 
Just another heart without a home 
And I was angry that God had left me alone 

Since I had
No hope of living 
I began 
And started giving 

My life, my shame 
I gave it all to him 
My heart, my strife 
Can you change this wasted life? 

Time took time away 
But he was reaching when I was so far away 
Through many years 
Through death's valley 
He knew my tears 
I believe he allowed me

My life, my sin
Oh, I gave it all to him
My heart, my strife
Can you change this wasted life?

My life, my shame 
Oh, I gave it all to him 
My heart, my strife 
Can you change this wasted life? 

My love, my shame
Oh, I gave him all my pain
The truth inside
Can you change this wasted life?

My life, my shame 
I gave it all to him 
With tears in my eyes 
I gave him my wasted life
