Rejoice
For the king is here
Yes he's with us now
Whispering in your ear

The seed of sight, the birth of sound
The God of heaven to earth come down

Rejoice
For the king has come
Let the spirit move now
And his will be done

Reflections of God's window pane
The dew of heaven fall like rain

The seed of sight, the birth of sound
The God of heaven to earth come down
His glory lives in senssurround, yeah
