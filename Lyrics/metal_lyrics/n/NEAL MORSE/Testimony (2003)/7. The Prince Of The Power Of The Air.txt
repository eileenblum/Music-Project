With one hand retreating like one that would drink to forget 
I sunk to the depths of the deepest black forest of death 
I was under the Fatherly care 
Of the prince of the power of the air 

The prince of the power of the air 
Was calling me back out there 
The prince of the power of the air 
Was taking me anywhere 

It's the way of the movement that flies in the face of the son 
Live what you feel and watch out for what you might become 
It can seem like you're doing just fine
But the creep's creepin' into your mind 

The prince of the power of the air
Was calling me back out there
The prince of the power of the air
Was taking me anywhere

The prince of the power of the air 
Can bring you down anywhere 
The prince of the power of the air 
Can break you down anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
