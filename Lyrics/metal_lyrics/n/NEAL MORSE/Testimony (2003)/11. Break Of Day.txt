Long before he came to claim me
Things had started changing in my life (in my life)
I began the day by praying
God help me to lay myself aside (lay aside)
Show me your will for my life

Dreams pass away - Dreams pass away
Longing for the break of day
Dreams pass away - Dreams pass away
Longing for the break of day

Long before he came to hold me
I looked up to heaven and I cried (yes I cried)
Why it was I didn't know;
My heart and soul just had to apologize
And my eyes looked up to the Father of Lights

Dreams pass away - Dreams pass away
Longing for the break of day
Night falls away - night falls away
Longing for the break of day

Unlock the door and walk inside
And find the truth you seek to hide
He chased you down and brought you low
To work the change no one can know
But to go on you must let go

Dreams pass away - Dreams pass away
Longing for the break of day
Night falls away - night falls away
Longing for the break of day

Dreams pass away - Dreams pass away
Longing for the break of day
