Grace kept rolling off 
Like so much rain into a broken cup 
It stayed a while but soon was on its way 
Just like a prize fighter 
Who can hear the count but can't get up 
I'll sleep a while and fight another day 

Like a lock to the door, like a latch to the window 
Closed to everyone 
Like a lock to the door, like a latch to the window 
I was growing colder in the sun 

Mirror, mirror, in the sky I look to you 
But you can't hear me cry 
Sometimes you seem so far away 
Why give me this ocean 
That nobody wants to get too near 
And why, oh God can I not seize the day? 

Like a lock to the door, like a latch to the window 
Closed to everyone 
Like a lock to the door, like a latch to the window 
I was growing colder in the sun 

Years kept blowing by 
like so much rain into my heart 
Dreaming of the day 
When I might get that major part 
And when things didn't go my way 
I did what I did yesterday 
There wasn't any way to change my heart 

Like a lock to the door 
Like a latch to the window 
I was growing colder in the sun 

Like a lock to the door, like a latch to the window 
(Just enduring my life in silence)
Closed to everyone 
Like a lock to the door, like a latch to the window 
(I kept living my life inside)
I was growing colder in the sun 

Like a lock to the door, like a latch to the window 
(Just enduring my life in silence) 
Closed to everyone 
Like a lock to the door, like a latch to the window 
(I kept living my life inside)
I was growing colder in the sun
