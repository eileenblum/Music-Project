Somewhere down inside me there's a new sensation
Out there on the edge there is no turning back
I began to feel aware
Of a different kind of power in the air

Like a key in the door, like an opening window
Something had begun
Like a key in the door, like an opening window
I found something new under the sun

God began to deal with me in different circles
I began to hear him like I never had
While I was playing Rock 'n' Roll
He began to fill the silence in my soul

Like a key in the door, like an opening window
Something had begun
Like a key in the door, like an opening window
I found something new under the sun

Though the seeds of happiness
Had been planted in my bones
The soil had too much emptiness
To ever have a home

And when things didn't go my way
I went right back to yesterday
And no one seemed to know the way back home
I'll just find my way alone
I'll just find my way alone
I'll just find my way alone

So the key in the door, like an opening window
At some point I lost the glory
Like a key in the door, like an opening window
I went back into my story
Like a key in the door, like an opening window
Open just a crack
Like a key in the door, like an opening window
When things got rough I started looking back
