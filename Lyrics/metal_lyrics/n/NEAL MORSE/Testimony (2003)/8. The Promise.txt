Princes, principalities, legals and legalities
They have no more power before us
Dark is their reality
There's a light that we can see
Lighting up the pathway before us

There's so much that we can know
There's a godly way to go
Can't you feel he's reaching down for us
His is the best place to be
He's the truth that makes you free
Can't you feel he's keeping his promise

Princes, principalities, legals and legalities
They have no more power before us
There's a light that we can see
There's a new reality
Can't you feel he's keeping his promise now?

Princes, principalities, legals and legalities
They have no more power before us
There's a light that we can see
There's a new reality
Can't you feel he's keeping his promise, promise, promise now?

The prince of the power of the air
Was calling me back out there
The prince of the power of the air
Can lead you down, can lead you down

The prince of the power of the air
Can lead you down anywhere
The prince of the power of the air
He led me almost anywhere
