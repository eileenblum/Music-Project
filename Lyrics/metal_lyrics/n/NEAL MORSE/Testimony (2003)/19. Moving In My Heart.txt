Cherie and I got married
In my bass player's old back yard
My Mom and Dad tried
But they took my moving hard

We still didn't have much money
And soon kids were on the way
But more and more
I would go to church and pray

Like an opening door
Like a breeze through a window
Prying me apart

Like an opening door
Like a breeze through a window
Something started moving in my heart

The band started doing better
Back in 1998
I started to think
Well maybe it's not too late

That big round ball of death inside
Something that I'd always had
I woke up one day
And realized I wasn't sad anymore

And the opening door
Like a breeze through a window
Prying me apart

Like an opening door
Like a breeze through a window
Something started moving in my heart

Oh Lord, my God are you calling me now?
Oh Lord, my God I can feel you now, oh
