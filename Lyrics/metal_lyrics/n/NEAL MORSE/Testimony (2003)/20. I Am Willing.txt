Jesus, is it true what they're saying
You know in my heart I've been praying
'Cause I feel something, is it you that I feel?
Hold me and show me you're real

For I am willing and I am broken
All I want is the life you have spoken
Oh Father
If I give you my life
Will you come turn the night to day?

For I am willing, you don't have to break me
I don't know why you'd die just to save me
Oh Father
Come and take me now
Take me now

Jesus spirit deep as an ocean
I need you and not just emotion
If you can truly live here within me
Let this be our great beginning

For I am willing and I am broken
All I want is the life you have spoken
Oh Father
If I give you my life
Will you come turn the night to day?
For I am willing
You don't have to break me
Take all that I am don't forsake me
Oh Father
Come and take me now
Take me now

I am willing and I am broken
All I want is the life you have spoken
Let the sleeper. let the sleeper be awoken now

(I am willing and I am broken)
(I am willing and I am broken)

All I want is you, all I want is you
Oh Father
Come and take me now

All I want is you, all I want is you
Oh Father
Come and take me now
