Breath blew right out of me
Like wind across a window ledge
My old forgotten ways
Came rushing back on me
The world that held no interest
Gave way to somber days

So many somber days I felt so all alone
(In my suffering I was home)
So many somber days I was so unaware
Of almost anything but my suffering

How can our sight become so severely limited
We cannot see beyond
The step we're about to take, the love that we did not make
The years so swiftly gone

So many somber days I felt so all alone
(In my suffering I was home)
So many somber days I was so unaware
Of almost anything but my suffering

And I felt unsure under a winter sky
And I would waste away
Coldest sun seemed so far away
Who can heal a heart that's made of clay?

If you're feeling down today
If you're dreading your next breath
You hurt down to the bone
There is someone here with us
God is close as your next breath
He won't leave you alone

Through your somber days when you feel all alone
(All your suffering he has known)
Through your somber days
When you feel like no one cares
(Touch your memory: he is there)
Through these somber days
All these somber days
(He will walk with you all the way)
No matter how it hurts please stay here one more day
Help is on the way
There'll be no more suffering
