It's all I can do to get up in the mornin'
And get through another day
It's all I can do to just get off to work
And not hurt anyone today

It's all I can do to get by in this world
There's so many dues to pay
I used to believe I had so much to give
But now all I have to say

Is this is all I can do

It's all I can do to come home at night
And get myself undressed
It's all I can do to sleep with the zombies
and give my mind a rest

I used to believe I could be anything
And make it a big success
My dreams got smaller and smaller until they were gone
And now I guess

This is all I can do

Oh God, why have you forsaken me?
Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now

Oh God, why are you so far from me?
Can you save me now?
Can you save me now
From this world of tears?

It's all I can do to get up in the mornin'
And get through another day
It's all I can do to sell all my junk
Pack up and leave L.A.

There's no future that I can see here
The dream has gone away
Don't cry for me mother, don't shed a tear
I'll probably be back someday

And this is all I can do
