Oh Lord, my God
You were there when things were hard
Oh Lord, my God
Hear the words I say
You will not break
If my ways are mine that's my mistake
Oh Lord, my God
Come and breathe on me

(And you are) You are the tongues of angels
(You are) You are the winds of time
(That's what you are) The sould that feeds my freedom
(And you are) The dream that never dies

Oh Lord, my God
You walked this worldly boulevard
So a joke like me
Might ascend one day

(And you are) The realm above all nations
(You are) The oceans open wide
(That's what you are) The ultimate musician
(And you are) The life within my eyes

(That's what you are) You are the tongues of angels
(And you are) The voice that guides my soul
(That's what you are) The pain alleviated
(And you are) You are the only goal
(And you are)

Light the lights of man
Count the grains of sand
Form a deeper connection
Shift to day from night
Making fresh the trite
There's no greater affection

('Cause you are) You are the tongues of angels
(And you are) You are the winds of time
(That's what you are) The soul that feeds my freedom
(And you are) You are so magnified

(That's what you are) You are the wealth of wisdom
(And you are) The voice that guides my soul
(That's what you are) The pain alleviated
(And you are) Your love is my only goal

Oooh, you are my soul
