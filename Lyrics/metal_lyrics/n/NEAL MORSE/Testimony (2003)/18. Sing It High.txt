Can somebody shout Hallelujah?
Can somebody give an amen?
The church sang and danced
And the band cranked up to ten

They talked about living water
Oh, they sang about Jordan wide
I never felt so out of place in all my life

Sing it high, sing it low
Sing it everywhere you go
Jesus will deliver you from suffering

He's the way, he's the goal
He's the song in your soul
Listen with your spirit and you'll hear it ring
Can't you hear it ring now?

Somethin' kept calling me back there
Oh, the love of the people so strong
Soon I was dancing and clapping and singing along, yes I was

Sing it high, sing it low
Sing it everywhere you go
Jesus will deliver you from suffering

He's the way, he's the goal
He's the song in your soul
Listen with your spirit and you'll hear it ring
Oh, you'll hear it ring

Come on, wooh, come on
Woo hoo, wooh

Sing it high, sing it low
Sing it everywhere you go
Jesus will deliver you from suffering
He's the way, he's the goal
He's the song in your soul
Listen with your spirit and you'll hear it ring

Sing it high, sing it low
Sing it everywhere you go
Jesus will deliver you from suffering
He's the way, he's the goal
He's the song in your soul
Listen with your spirit and you'll hear it ring
Oh you'll hear it ring?
