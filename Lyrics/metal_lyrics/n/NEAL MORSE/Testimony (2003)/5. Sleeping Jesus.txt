But during that time 
Of darkness and doubt 
I began to search for something 
Looked up and down 
But I barely knew the difference 
Between the sky and the ground 

Sleeping Jesus 
Awaken in the man 
Send your spirit 
Touch him with your hand 
He can't feel you 
He cannot see the sky 
Sleeping Jesus 
Awaken in his mind 

The veil of tears 
Was wearing quite thin 
The weight of wasted years 
Left no way to win 
But I began to feel his guidance 
While I was deep in my sin 

Sleeping Jesus 
Awaken in the man 
Send your spirit 
Touch him with your hand 
He can't feel you 
He cannot reason why 
Sleeping Jesus 
He's reaching for the sky 

Sleeping Jesus 
Awaken in the man 
Send your spirit 
And touch him with your hand 
He can't feel you 
He cannot see the sky 
Sleeping Jesus 
Awaken in his mind
