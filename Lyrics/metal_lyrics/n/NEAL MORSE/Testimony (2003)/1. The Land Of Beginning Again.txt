I wish there was a way to start again 
Just blink and count to ten 
In the land of beginning again 

Where no one knows the bad things that you've done 
The past is truly gone 
In the land of beginning again 

And I see a child returning to the sky 
We'll all play simple games 
And all the hard things there are soft as rain 

I wish there was a way to start again 
To wake up among friends 
In the land of beginning again 

And I love my brother more than my own life 
And no one feels mean 
All things are new 
Behold the slate is clean ... 

I wish there was 
A way to start again 
Just blink and count to ten 
In the land of beginning again 
In the land of beginning again
