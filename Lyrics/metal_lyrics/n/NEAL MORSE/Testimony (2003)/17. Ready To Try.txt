I drove out to Nashville in the pouring rain
With revolution in the air
With just my guitar, my dog and my tape machine
I thought I might have some luck out there

'Cause I was ready to try anything
Maybe my life was somewhere waiting
I had nothing to lose and less to bring
I was ready to try almost anything

I spent my first night there with a friend of mine
She was from that old party set
I unpacked my bags and all I couldn't leave behind
As it turned out I never left

And I was ready to try anything
Maybe my life was somewhere waiting
I had nothing to lose and less to bring
I was ready to try almost anything

She's a good girl
Loves Jesus like the song says
And through my madness
My heart began to say yes, yes

One day she brought me to her childhood church
Old time religion filled the air
The preacher said you're saved by faith and not by works
I thought "that's good 'cause I haven't worked in a year"

But I was ready to try anything
Maybe my life is right here waiting
I've got nothing to lose and less to bring
I was ready to try almost anything

I was ready to try anything
(Don't want to be a lock to the door)
Maybe my life is right here waiting
(Don't want to be a latch to the window)
I've got nothing to lose and less to bring
I was ready to try almost anything
