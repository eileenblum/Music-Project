In the middle of the breaking through
There was still more that I was clinging to
That fear you feel like when you're almost gone
When you want to jump but you're still hanging on
Come on!

And as I stood there praying in my mind
I saw the things I couldn't leave behind
The heart conceals what we cannot know
As he revealed I cried out, "Let it go."
Let's go!
