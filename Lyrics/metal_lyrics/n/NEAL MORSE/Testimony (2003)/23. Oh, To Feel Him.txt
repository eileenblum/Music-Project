In quiet solitude
I lift my heart to the sky
To the mountain so high
My life is on the altar
With music all around
His spirit enters my soul
Like nothing I've ever known
Like stillness on the water

And I knew it was him
I knew it was Jesus
The beauty of his love inside
Letting all my pain be crucified
And I knew it was him
I knew this was Jesus
There my heart was cleansed of sin
I could have the world but oh, to feel him

In a moment lost in time
My life in front of me lay
From my birth to that day
I caught a glimpse of freedom

And there I stayed
While the people prayed
Until he came in at last
I waved goodbye to my past
And walked into the kingdom

And I knew it was him
I knew it was Jesus
Like the wind you cannot see
I felt his spirit touching me
And oh, to feel, to feel him
I knew this was Jesus
There my heart was cleansed of sin
I could have the world but oh, to feel him
To feel him

Oh, to feel him, I can feel Jesus
Like the day of Pentecost
His love poured out to all the lost
And oh, to feel him, oh to feel Jesus
The power of his love inside
Letting all my pain be crucified

Oh, to feel him, oh, to feel Jesus
There my heart was cleansed of sin
I could have the world but oh, to feel him
(To feel him)
To feel him
