Maker of the sun and shade
The plans were made before the morning
At a time when no one knew
He left a clue and sent us a lifeline... It's fine

Then along came a man like me
With everything laid out before him
Then it all came crashing down
A man can drown from thoughts in his own mind

Like something deep inside my soul
Was sinking fast; I was the hole
When I was almost out of time

He gave me a lifeline right down to my soul
He gave me a lifeline that I might grab a hold

Suffering was nothing new
My days were few without a let down
Something down there deep inside
Dissatisfied with everything I'd find

And in the clouds he sent the sky
Into a desert running dry
He sent a river full of life

He gave me a lifeline right down to my soul
He gave me a lifeline that I might grab a hold
He gave me a lifeline when I was cast away
He gave me a lifeline right up from the grave

He sent me a lifeline when I was on my own
Far from the borders he came brought me home
He sent me a lifeline when I was down the hole
My world was like an ocean raging out of control

Send me a lifeline
Send me a lifeline

Once upon another time
He made my mind a different color
Painted on my destiny away between
The black and lonely sky... Let's fly!

He gave me a lifeline right down to my soul
He gave me a lifeline that I might grab a hold
He gave me a lifeline when I was cast away
He gave me a lifeline and I'm alive today

He gave me a lifeline
He gave me a lifeline and I'm alive today
He gave me a lifeline
Jesus is my lifeline
