I came to a place in my life
When I looked out at many roads
There must be a way that'll deliver
I looked for the one that was right
Stood frozen in my soul
Show me the way of the believer
Lord, show me the way of the believer

[I. So Many Roads]

Kind of feel like I'm reaching forward
Like a wave on the ocean tide
But there's so many roads to nowhere
So many places I could try
But I feel there is one that will go there
One for me is really right
And I know that my family loves me
But I gotta go and take this ride

Cause there's so many roads to nowhere
So many places I could try
But I feel there is one that will go there
One for me is really right
I've waited so long in maybe
Maybe it's time for me to fly
And search for the one that will save me
That will lead me in the light

Roads to nowhere taking everything I have
They say, "come on now", you won't ever feel bad
Come and you'll be glad
And I feel like I have a calling
But is it only in my mind?

So many roads before me
So many places I could hide
But still there is one that is calling
Maybe one I haven't tried
I've waited so long in maybe
Maybe it's time for me to fly
And search for the one that will save me
That will lead me in the light

So many roads, so many roads,
so many roads to nowhere
So many roads, so many roads,
so many roads to nowhere
So many roads

[II. Star for a Day]

Come on in son our works all fun
You gotta getcha some California sun
If you're not sure, who you are
No personality?
Well we'll invent you one
We'll make you a star for a day
You'll get so high that you can fly away
In a semi-perpetual way
You'll be living the life
out on the king's highway
Hey, be a star for a day

The stadium cheers for Britney Spears
Let's forget about the wounded tender years
Convertible car, a house on the coast
Just take the gig that will pay for the most
We'll make you a star for a day
You'll get so high that you can fly away
In a semi-perpetual way
You'll be living the life out on the king's highway
Hey, be a star for a day

We'll make you a star for a day
You'll get so high that you can fly away
Why don't you put yourself into the play
I'm telling you son this is the only way
Be a star for a day

So many roads, so many roads to nowhere
So many roads, so many ways to fly
If God would just show
Show me the way I'd follow
Surely I'd go, but there's so many roads
So many roads

[III. The Humdrum Life]

Ho ho the humdrum life, here is your security
Make sure that you survive, a wonderful destiny
Have kids and raise them up,
take a picture of the family
And once in awhile you show up, to let them see
you're happy while you work your life away

Ho ho take it slow, check it all thoroughly
Make sure you don't stand out,
this is not the way to be!
Give up your silly dreams, living life fully
Come down the surest road, you can be happy
While you work your life away
Work your life away

Give up your silly dreams, living life fully
Come down the surest road, fulfilling is a fantasy
Dreams won't pay your bills,
you better come and be like me
This is the best way to be

So many roads, so many roads to nowhere
So many roads, so many roads to nowhere
So many roads, so many roads to nowhere
So many roads, so many roads to nowhere

[IV. All the Way to the Grave]

Get a load of him, he's so insane
Here's some stuff that'll set fire to your brain
Forget it all you can party everyday... Hey hey
Live it up! You can be stoned all the way
All the way to the grave

It's the only thing I really like
I can do what I want with my own life
Forget it all you can party everyday... Hey hey
Live it up! You can be stoned all the way
All the way to the grave

Forget it all you can party everyday... Hey hey
Live it up! You can be stoned all the way
All the way to the grave

So many roads, so many roads,
So many roads, so many roads

[V. The Eyes of the Savior]

Behind door number two there is another life
One that will satisfy more than you'll ever know
Now it may not appear beautiful in your eyes
But there's a place where the spirit flies
That'll lead right up to the throne

Before your time is almost gone
Look in the eyes of the Savior
Turn your darkness into dawn
Look in the eyes of the Savior

If love is the greatest and God's love is greater still
Come whosoever will and let Jesus fill your heart

Cause your time is almost gone
Look in the eyes of the Savior
Turn your darkness into dawn
Look in the eyes of the Savior

Cause your time is almost gone
Look in the eyes of the Savior
Turn your darkness into dawn
Look in the eyes of the Savior
Look in the eyes of the Savior
Look in His eyes

[VI. So Many Roads Reprise]

As I look to the grand horizon
Gazing out at the auburn sky
There's so many roads before me
So many ways that I could try
But I'm seeking the One who will guide me
How else can I know what's right?

If I trust in the one who loves me
He will lead me into paths of light
And there's so many roads before me
Don't let me go down the road of pride
I know if I only trust in Jesus
He will lead me to the other side

I came to a place in my life
When I looked out at many roads
Show me the way of the believer
