Running from a destiny I wasn't sure was mine
I chose a life of obscurity and I left my dreams behind
I traded my ambitions for the safe and simple life
But lately I feel far away and inside I feel like I

Can't find my way home
Can't find my way home
And if I stay here too long now
I may never find that place where I feel like I belong
Can't find my way home

Seeking out fulfillment in a tiny plastic jar
There isn't much to go around when you don't know who you are
And I know that I'm a child of God but He seems so far away
And it doesn't seem to help me much when I kneel down to pray

Can't find my way home
Can't find my way home
And if I stay here too long now
I may never find that place where I feel like I belong
I know that when I find it I'll have known it all along
I feel like a dark cold night that's reaching for the dawn

Can't find my way home
Show me the way home
Cause if I stay here too long now
I may never find that place where I feel like I belong
Show me the way home
Show me the way home
Lord show me the way home
I know somehow I'll find that place where I feel like I belong
Show me the way home
