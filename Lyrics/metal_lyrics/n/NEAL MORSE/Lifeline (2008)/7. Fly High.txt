Life like a razor can shave you clean
Or it cuts in a moment and leaves you to bleed
And in fear you have settled for what you have found
You're safe, you're comfortable, but you're stuck on the ground

Fly high, fly straight through the open sky
Give up everything you have for what you could never buy
It's time, if you seek you can't help but find
What you give up you'll gain, you will be lifted high

What is holding you, is holding you down
You might have to take off that rock-and-roll crown
But what you think is your identity is not really you
Let it go keep breaking till we break on through

And fly high, fly straight through the open sky
Give up everything you have for what you could never buy
It's time, if you seek you can't help but find
What you give up you'll gain, Jesus will lift you high
Fly high

Fly high, fly straight through the open sky
Give up everything you know for what you could never buy
It's time, if you seek you can't help but find
And what you give up you'll gain, Jesus will lift you high

Fly high, fly straight through the open sky
Give up everything that you have for what you could never buy
It's time, if you seek you can't help but find
Just give it all up and you'll gain, Jesus will lift you high
Fly high
Fly high
