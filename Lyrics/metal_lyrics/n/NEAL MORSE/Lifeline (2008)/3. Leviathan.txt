Praise ye the Lord from the earth ya sea monsters
Stretch out your necks let us see ya breathe fire
Out of the depths of the sea comes Leviathan
How many heads will there be on Leviathan?

The serpent was small but swiftly uncoiling
From Pharaoh to Caesar he grew his blood boiling
Out of the depths of the sea comes Leviathan
How many heads will there be on Leviathan?

From his mouth a blazing torch
With sparks of fire leaping forth
And form his nostrils smoke comes dank as death
He sneezes and bright light comes out
He's king of the sons of pride, no doubt
And when he turns on you
YOU BETTER LOOK OUT!

In the day of the Lord He will slay the sea monster
He will punish the dragon that rose from the water
Out of the depths of the sea comes Leviathan
There will be no place to flee for Leviathan
One day we all will be free from Leviathan
