Try as you might, you can't understand it all
And you were living the life,
but then came your tragic fall
And if God's love was real; why the suffering?
But if you ask him to heal on a desert plain
He'll send the rain

The storms may weather, but He will never
God's love won't let you down
When you've fallen under
You don't have to wonder
God's love won't let you down
God's love won't fail
He'll never let you down

You promised yourself
you never would love again
And you tried hiding out,
but your heart just can't stay shut in
But there's a love that is real
that won't turn on you
Just reach out and you'll feel
what He said is true
It's all for you

The storms may weather, but He will never
God's love won't let you down
When you've fallen under
You don't have to wonder
God's love won't let you down
God's love won't fail
He'll never let you down

Let those asleep be awoken
Come to the city of light
He is life, life
He is life
The storms may weather, but He will never
God's love won't let you down
When you've fallen under
You don't have to wonder
God's love won't let you down
God's love won't fail
He'll never let you down
