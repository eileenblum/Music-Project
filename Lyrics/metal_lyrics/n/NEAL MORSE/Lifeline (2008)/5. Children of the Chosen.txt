Come inside the coast is clear
Watch all your troubles disappear
God is love and all is free
won't you come inside and see
You'll have all you ever want or ever need

We are sunlight, we are golden
We're the children of the chosen
We are sunlight, we are golden
See us dancing in the sun
We're the children of the Chosen Holy One

Aren't you tired of the rules they made
The bondage on your backs they laid
Shake it off you've got liberty
there is more than we can see
God loves you and He wants you to be free

We are sunlight, we are golden
We're the children of the chosen
We are sunlight, we are golden
See us dancing in the sun
We're the children of the Holy One

We are sunlight, we are golden
We're the children of the chosen
We are sunlight, we are golden
See us dancing in the sun
We're the children of the Chosen, Holy One
