Come out of her my people ...

I saw the light of a thousand angels taking it on the chin
I saw a hundred demons raging suffering blights upon their skin
Just as the woman lay deep in quicksand ready to take the dive
I saw some men with tattooed foreheads
I saw them laying down their lives

But before she disappeared I heard them cry
They set her on a wing bound for the sky

It was a long night's journey
A long night's journey into day
Such a long night's journey
A long night's journey into day

I saw an angel come down from heaven glorious as the sky
Crying that 'Babylon has fallen and every nation has drunk her wine'
My children will not be stooped within her tricked by her sorcery
It's time to come out of her my people
It's time set the captives free"

And then I saw a woman bright and clear
The marriage of the lamb is almost here

[Chorus]
