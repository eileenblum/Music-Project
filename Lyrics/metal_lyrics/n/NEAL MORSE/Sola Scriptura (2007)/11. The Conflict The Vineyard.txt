A wild boar has entered in the vineyard
We'll burn his books and skin him alive
And we'll do him like all the rest
He never more will rise

You are Babylon the destroyer
You destroyed the truth with all of your lies
And you will go down to the grave
And never more will rise

A wild boar entered in the vineyard
We'll burn his books and skin him alive
And we'll do him like all the rest
He never more will rise
