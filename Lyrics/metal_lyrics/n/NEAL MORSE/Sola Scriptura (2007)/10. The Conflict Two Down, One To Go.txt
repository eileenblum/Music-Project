The woman's found a place to go
Where she's gone to nobody know
But Martin's words are like wild fire
Spreading fast as pine on the pyre
Two down, one to go

Columbo sailed in '92
Guttenberg did his thing too
And Calvin came on right away
The human clock reads a whole nother day
Two down, one to go

The woman fled into the dark
From the darkness of man's heart
But she's coming from her hideaway
And I believe she still is today
Two down, one to go
Two down, one to go
Two down, one to go
