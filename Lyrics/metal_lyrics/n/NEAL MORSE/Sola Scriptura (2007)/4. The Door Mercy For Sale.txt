In the name of God you must pay your penance
If you don't well that's a crime
If you want to buy your way to heaven
We'll indulge you every time
Would you like to come
We'll eat in secret
My water's stolen but it's fine
If you want to know much more about me
Take a look in Proverbs 9

Mercy, mercy we're selling mercy
We are Christ and we'll bless you well
People crying Lord have mercy
But they've gone in through the gates of hell
It's true, look out we're comin' for you!

If you think the whore is only history
Are there those who teach her lies?
Wherever they believe what came out from her
The same spirit is still alive

Mercy, mercy we're selling mercy
We are Christ and we'll bless you well
People crying Lord have mercy
But they've gone in through the gates of hell
It's true, look out we're comin' for you!
