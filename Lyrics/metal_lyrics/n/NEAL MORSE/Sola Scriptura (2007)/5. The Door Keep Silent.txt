How can I keep silent when I know the truth?
How can I stand idly by with the privileged few?
There's criminals in power; the keepers of the lie
They say you've got salvation when they know you're gonna die

I don't wanna be the one to bring the curtain down
I'd much rather stay at home and keep what I have found
But Jesus didn't call me to do what I would do
So how can I keep silent when I know the truth?

What is it that binds me? What can keep me down?
In my very heart of hearts, who shall wear the crown?
But as I read and as I bleed, oh, my heart is fixed
And if I follow blind men, well, we'll fall in the ditch

[Chorus]

Oh Lord I can't justify what the ones above me do
Oh Lord I can testify nothing more or less will do
And I'll be your witness in the wild
The dragon stands in front of me
The virgin's been defiled, Oh God ...

How can I keep silent when I know the truth?
I ask myself one question: What would Jesus do?

[Chorus]
