Sometimes comes a moment when there is no escape
A man by candlelight reads "The just shall live by faith"
And a rushing ray of light comes and hits him at the core
I will write my words upon the door

History is hinged on him playing out the role
The dawn is coming after the dark night of the soul
The simple act has changed our world for evermore
I will write my words upon the door
I will write my words upon the door

Martin saw the jailer with the woman in her bed
With simple words of life he struck the seventh head
The witness stands before the dragon and the whore
I will write my words upon the door
I will write my words upon the door
I will write my words upon the door
