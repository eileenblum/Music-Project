All of me is down and the waiting days are over
I must face the crowd on a dark and dreary day

But there's something burning inside me
There's something deep within my heart
Telling me go on through
I am here with you, no matter where you are
So in my hour of pain and sorrow
Jesus will walk me through the dark
'Cause if I die with him I will rise again
With heaven in my heart
Oh God help me to have heaven in my heart

My God he has a plan and I can do no other
God help me, here I stand, this is the only way

But there's something burning inside me
There's something deep within my heart
Telling me go on through
I am here with you, no matter where you are
So in my hour of pain and sorrow
Jesus will walk me through the dark
'Cause if I die with him I will rise again
With heaven in my heart

When he comes to find me I'll have my hand to the plow
Like he said his kingdom lives inside us here and now

Something's burning inside of me
There's something deep within my heart
'Cause when my Savior died
I was crucified with Him on that cross
So they may come and they may kill me
But they cannot kill what's in my heart
'Cause when I died with Him
I surely rose again
With heaven in my heart

I've got heaven in my heart
Heaven in my heart
And the world can't take it away

Oh God, help me
Though I walk through hell give me heaven in my heart
