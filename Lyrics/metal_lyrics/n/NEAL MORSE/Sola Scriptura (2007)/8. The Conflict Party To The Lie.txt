Who is this who challenges the ruling of the crown?
Father we must crush him and he never will be found

We must find a way, the man will surely pay
And when there's nothing left to try ...
He must take it back, this is the only way
We can't be party to the lie
Party to the lie

Something burns inside of me that you don't understand
I'm under the authority of God and not of man

God will make a way, He will decide my fate
And whether or not I live or die
I won't take it back, this is the only way
I can't be party to the lie
Party to the lie

God will make a way, He will decide my fate
And whether or not I live or die
I won't take it back, this is the only way
I won't be party to the lie
Party to the lie
