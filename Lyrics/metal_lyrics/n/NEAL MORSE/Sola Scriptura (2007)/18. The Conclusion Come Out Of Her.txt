Giving up the life we had now Jesus is around us
Filled up with the Holy Ghost we're ready now to fly
But spiritual captivity it still is all around us
I believe the time has come to stand up and to cry

Come out of her - There's a place where your spirit can fly
Come out of her my people
MY PEOPLE!

Not just from the mother but the daughters of the harlot
Everything that comes from her it must be left behind
Her rituals and teaching smells of death and bloody scarlet
Like Martin did before us let the scripture be our guide

Come out of her - There's a place where your spirit can fly
Come out of her my people
Come out of her - The angel will suddenly cry
Come out of her my people
MY PEOPLE!
