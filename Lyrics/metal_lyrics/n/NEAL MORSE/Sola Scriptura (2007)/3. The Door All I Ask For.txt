Free me - know me
Only you can make the morning mine
Lowly, humbly
As the sunlight lights the way

This is all I've asked for
This is all I've wanted to do
Is to live with you forever
And feel the beauty of your truth
This is all I've asked for
To live a life that's pleasing to you
And be there ever after
You know my heart; you know it's true

Bravely, strongly - You have left the veil of death behind
Something drawing me out into your way

This is all I've asked for
This is all I've wanted to do
Is to live with you forever
And feel the beauty of your truth
This is all I've asked for
To live a life that's pleasing to you
And to be there ever after
You know my heart; you know it's true

All I want is you

Oh God I seek the glory that's from you and from you only
Oh God I seek the glory that's from you
I seek your light through the veil of life
Please come and make me holy
Oh God I seek the glory that's from you
(This is all I ask for)
Oh God I seek the glory that's from you
(To live a life that's pleasing to you)
Oh God I seek the glory that's from you
Only you
