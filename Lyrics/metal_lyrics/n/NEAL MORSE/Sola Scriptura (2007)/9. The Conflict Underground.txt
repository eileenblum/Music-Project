Sun turns as black as the day
Night turns a cold steel gray
I want to stay
Where the sun cannot be found

Friends cover me in the night
In a castle of warm colored light
Here I will stay tucked away
I'm underground

I thought I was coming to die
And that's what they're thinking outside
But I will stay lost
'Til it's safe there to be found

Writing the book in the day
In words that my people can say
Here I will stay, tucked away
I'm underground
