Bravely, strongly
Watch the woman step into the light
Gleaming, leaning
On the arms of the one she loves

This is all I ask for, this is all I've wanted to do
Is to live with you forever
And feel the beauty of your truth
This is all I ask for
To live a life that's pleasing to you
And to be there ever after
You know my heart you know it's true

She's clothed with the sun
My beloved is only one
And her glory has just begun
Can you see her with your eyes?

She's prepared herself just for him
(By the grace of God she's alive!)
She has overcome all her sin
(By the grace of God she's alive!)
Let the day of the lamb begin
(By the grace of God she's alive!)
Can you see her glory rise?
