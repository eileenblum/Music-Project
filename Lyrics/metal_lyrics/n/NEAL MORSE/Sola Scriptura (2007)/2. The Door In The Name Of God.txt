Giving up the time we've got to live a life completely
Giving over to the lust that rages in the mind
The Captain fills his place with gold while all the ship is sinking
Calls himself the Bishop-Prince and blood's his favorite wine

Gardens grow as people know and sense the smell of slaughter
Every soul and Saxon senses something's gone awry
The woman in the wilderness - the beast has nearly got her
Men surround the Bishop-Prince and sing their bloody cry

In the name of God you must die
All that's not our truth is a lie
In the name of God you must die
In the name of God you must die
If you want some teeth, just ask why
In the name of God you must die

The pearl is trodden underfoot into the muck and mire
We'll take the Roman Gods except the names will all be changed
The woman's fed by ravens and her feet are in the fire
Cold and bare she's holding there 1260 days

In the name of God you must die
All that's not our truth is a lie
In the name of God you must die
In the name of God you must die
We won't let a sleeping dog lie
In the name of God you must die

And the Captain calls
If they won't pay they'll soon be scratching the dungeon walls
From the highest height to the tenement halls - it's true
Look out we're comin' for you!

In the name of God you must die
In the name of God you must die
