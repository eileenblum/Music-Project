God took the Promised Land and put it in my bloodstained hand
I can sell you grace for your soul or you'll burn in hell far below

I'm your Priest, I'm your King, I'm a Saint
This love your enemies thing's down the drain
Tell me, do you know my name?

Look I got two big horns like a lamb
Even though Peter was married I can't
Look I've got great big armies like a General
I may have a mistress but at least I'm a hetero

I'm your Priest, I'm your King, I'm a Saint
This love your enemies thing's down the drain
Tell me, do you know my name?
Tell me, do you know my name?
Tell me, do you know my name?
My name ... Tell me ...
