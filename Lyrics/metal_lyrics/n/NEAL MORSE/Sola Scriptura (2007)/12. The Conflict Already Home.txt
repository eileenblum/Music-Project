I stand accused I'm beaten used and tired
They took all my words and threw them in the fire
As they cast me down there's somethin' found within me
They can grind me dust but life is just beginning

There is a truth that I'm feeling; love full of healing
Somewhere I've never known
As I surrender completely; pure and it's easy
Like I'm already home
I'm already home

Take me away I want to stay by the water
If I pass on won't you tell my sons and daughters
When I am gone you all must go on believing
Lay down your life 'cause love is what gives it meaning

There is a truth that I'm feeling; love full of healing
Somewhere I've never known
As I surrender completely; pure and it's easy
Like I'm already home
There is place full of knowing; like it was snowing
Waking me up at last
And as the pages keep turning; yielding and yearning
Washing away the past
You can know
You can know the truth
He has come
He has come for you

There is a truth that I'm feeling; love full of healing
Somewhere I've never known (Already Home)
As I surrender completely; pure and it's easy
Like I'm already home (I'm already home)
There's a place full of knowing; like it was snowing
Waking me up at last (Already Home)
And as the pages keep turning; yielding and yearning
Washing away the past (I'm already home)

Oh God
I seek the glory that's from you and from you only
Oh God
I seek the glory that's from you
I'm already home ...
