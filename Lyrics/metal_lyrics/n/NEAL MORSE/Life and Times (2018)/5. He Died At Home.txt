William always wanted to be a soldier
"Army men were his favorite toys," tells his mother
He was going to be the hero of the story
Live with honor or die in a blaze of glory
So he joined when he was seventeen
Kissed his mom goodbye
She wept as she packed his duffel bag
With notes of love and pride
She'd never guess six years from then
Tortured and alone
William wouldn't die in fields unknown
He died at home

He loved the army, it's all he ever wanted
To serve his country and look death in the face undaunted
But after a couple of tours, the fire in him died
You can't watch friends be killed and stay the same inside
He told his mom "you'd hate me
If you knew the things I've done"
"I will never hate you
You are my beloved son"
He said, "no mom, the son you loved
Died somewhere over there"
But William didn't die in the combat zone
He died at home

He came back ill at ease with civilians
His mother woke to screaming â it was William's
The army shrugged and gave him more prescriptions
As William's mind grew more and more distant

Before he died he told his mom
"Don't bury me in my uniform
No military funeral
That's for some who gave their all"
One night he shot the soldier dead
To kill the voices in his head
They gathered at the weekly wake
They have at every army base
'Cause more will die by their own hand
Than fall in any foreign land
They covered William in the flag
But there was not a boast or brag
When asked how soldier William died
No one mentions suicide

The cause of death is hard to say out loud
The soldier who once stood so strong and proud
His mother looks away and simply moans
He died at home
