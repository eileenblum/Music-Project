Got a postcard
Picture perfect
Of a time and place
That I once called home
That I once called home

Familiar skies and
Blue skies for miles
And as I looked at the picture it spoke to me
Said "come on home now, come on home"

Headed down to old Alabama
Hope it won't take too long
'Cause I got friends in old Alabama
That's where I belong

They got love there and it don't matter
If you change your address, it's still in your bones
They don't give a damn about telephones
Fixed interest loans or fancy homes
I don't know why I don't hardly go there
And I don't know why my life has a hold on me
But when the day comes that I'm finally free
You know that I will be

Headed down to old Alabama
Hope it won't take too long
'Cause I got friends in old Alabama
That's where I belong

And when they finally lay me down
And I'm heaven bound
Please don't bury me in this cold town
Take me down

Take me down to old Alabama
Know it won't take too long
'Cause I got friends in old Alabama
That's where I belong

Take me down to old Alabama
