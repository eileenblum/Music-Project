I just thought I'd write a song
To tell you all the way I feel
But it ain't no big deal
I just thought I'd lay it down
And try my best to keep it real
Like a little Neil...Young

And I hope it makes you feel just a little lazy
Like you could take a little time and lay your crazy down

Maybe we could rest a while and do
Only what we really like to do
Livin' lightly, livin' lightly
Maybe we can hang out with some friends
Take some time to learn to laugh and love again
Livin' lightly, livin' lightly now

I just thought I'd write a song
To make you feel like you're on vacation
Ridin' out of the station
Like when you check into your room
And you know you got the whole week to do nothin'
And you lay down just feelin' so good

And I hope it makes you feel just a little groovy
Like we're livin' in an old-time movie now

Maybe we could rest a while and do
Only what we really like to do
Livin' lightly, livin' lightly
Maybe we can hang out with some friends
Take some time to learn to laugh and love again
Livin' lightly, livin' lightly now

Oh baby, talk with me a while
We can take a walk in the mornin'
Have coffee for two, me and you
You could light up the whole world with that smile
Come on honey child
There's nothin' but blue skies in our worldview

I just thought I'd write a song
And try my best to keep it simple
Keep the crashes on the cymbal down

Maybe we could rest a while and do
Only what we really like to do
Livin' lightly, livin' lightly
Maybe we can hang out with some friends
Take some time to learn to laugh and love again
Livin' lightly, livin' lightly now
Livin' lightly, livin' lightly now
Livin' lightly
