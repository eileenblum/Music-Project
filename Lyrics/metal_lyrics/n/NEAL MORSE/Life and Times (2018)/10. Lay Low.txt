Drivin' in the rain
In the take it easy lane
I might go to Maine or maybe California
Passin' through Ft. Wayne
Thinkin' bout what I became
So busy in mind the great achiever
I just had to take some time and take a breather

And I'm gonna lay low for a while
Step out of the system
I'm gonna go find that miracle mile
I'm gonna lay low for a while
Head out on the highway of my soul
I'm gonna lay low
I'm gonna lay low
Baby, do you want to go?

My list for every week
How I love to press delete
I'm sure the world will be
Just fine without me
I gave up all my control
And my old rock `n' roll
The things I thought I'd need, well, I don't need `em
It's what we give for free that gives us freedom

And I'm gonna lay low for a while
Step out of the system
I'm gonna go find that miracle mile
I'm gonna lay low for a while
Head out on the highway of my soul
I'm gonna lay low
I'm gonna lay low
Baby, do you want to go?

We're way off the grid now
We got our status hid now
All we need to pay's the highway toll
I've got no chains to bind me
I left it far behind me
Chuck all that machinery down the hole
And I'm gonna lay low
I'm gonna lay low

And I'm gonna lay low for a while
Step out of the system
I'm gonna go find that miracle mile
I'm gonna lay low for a while
Head out on the highway of my soul
I'm gonna lay low
I'm gonna lay low
Baby, do you want to go?
