The girl that I love is a little bit flighty
She does what she wants; she's the headstrong kind
We were together but she took a break from me
And I've been awaiting a change of the tide

But she's changed her mind again
She's changed and now she says she loves me
She's changed her mind again
I gave her some time to work it out
She says there isn't any doubt now
She's in love with me

When we're together, love is like lightning
She's pretty and deep as a wishing well
She loves adventure and all that's exciting
And I haven't breathed since she left for a spell

But she's changed her mind again
She's changed and now she says she loves me
She's changed her mind again
I gave her some time to work things out
She says there isn't any doubt now
She's in love with me

I live to love her, but she changes everyday
Wouldn't be much fun if she was any other way, hey hey hey

Now I'm just hoping this is the last time
To love is to risk, especially with this girl...

But she's changed her mind again
She's changed and now she says she loves me
She's changed her mind again
I gave her some time to think it out
Oh, she's changed her mind again
She's changed her mind and now she says she loves me
She's changed her mind again
I gave her some time to work it out
She says there isn't any doubt now
She's in love with me
