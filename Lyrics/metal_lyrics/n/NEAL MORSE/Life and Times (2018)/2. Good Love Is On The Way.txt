She's all alone in the city
The girl with the dull surprise
He's tryin' to make his music come alive
She's the beauty barista
He's the corny cashier
They'd both like to make their memories disappear

And hey, hey, hey
She feels so good today
And hey, hey, hey
Good love is on the way
Good love is on the way

He's got his man bun workin'
She's like a paper doll
She sees the flyer for his next gig on the wall

And hey, hey, hey
She feels so good today
And hey, hey, hey
Good love is on the way
Good love is on the way

Checkered past holiday
Candy colored yesterday
Now it's like a long cool ride
Summer's spent, winter's gone
Sunday mornin' comin' on
Something good is on the rise

Checkered past holiday
Candy colored yesterday
Now it's like a long cool ride
Summer's spent, winter's gone
Sunday mornin' comin' on
Better days are just outside
Let's take a ride...

She's all alone in the city
But this day could change her life
Something is comin' that'll set the whole thing right

And hey, hey, hey
She feels so good today
And hey, hey, hey
Good love is on the way

And hey, hey, hey
She feels so good today
And hey, hey, hey
Good love is on the way
Good love is on the way
