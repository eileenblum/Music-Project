If I only had a year to live
I'd sell my junk for what I could get
And have myself a time or two
If I only had a year to live
We'd ride off into a fine sunset
And fall in love, just me and you
I'd take some time with my sons and my daughter
Try to impart
The best of my heart
If I only had a year to live
Doo doo doo doo doo...

If I only had a month to live
What would I do? That's tough I guess...
It wouldn't leave much time to sail away
I'd try to write that song that sums it up in fifty words or less
And says everything I couldn't say
I'd make things right, make that call to my brother
The one I don't see
Ask him to forgive me
If I only had a month to live
Doo doo doo doo doo...

If I only had one week left
I'd give that kid my fine drum set
And hope he'd practice somewhere far
I'd be tellin' everyone I can how Jesus saved this lonely man
His love can change the saddest heart
I'd wrap my arms around my wife and my family
Love 'em out loud
Tell 'em how proud I am
If I only had a week to live
Doo doo doo doo doo...

If I only had a day to live
What would I do? I shake my head
What if I only had today?
There ain't no way I could do it all
But I think that I could make that call
And pass along some love along the way

'Cause no one here is promised tomorrow
Each day is the first
Or your last day on earth
If I only had a year to live
Doo doo doo doo doo...
If I only had a month to live
Doo doo doo doo doo...
If I only had a day to live
Doo doo doo doo doo...
