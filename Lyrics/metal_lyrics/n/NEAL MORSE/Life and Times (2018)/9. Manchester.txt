Are you feelin' like the underdog?
Like every day's stuck on repeat?
Come and sing a different song
On the sunny side of Oxford Street

In Manchester by the sea
How long will you wait for me?
Let's ride the magic bus again
Or maybe take the midland train to
Manchester by the sea
A revolution's happening to me
Right here in Manchester by the sea

Girlfriends hug at the coffee shop
There's every type of person walking by
It's a perfect day full stop
There's even a smile on the traffic cop

In Manchester by the sea
How long will you wait for me?
Let's ride the magic bus again
Or maybe take the midland train to
Manchester by the sea
A revolution's happening to me
Right here in Manchester by the sea

I'm givin' all my love away
Fillin' up, I'm fillin' up
I'm givin' all my love away
Fillin' up, I'm fillin' up
I'm givin' all my love away
Fillin' up, right here in Manchester by the bay

"So I was just a little confused when I was writing this song, but my friend from the UK straightened me out."

As I'm walkin' 'round the town
Singin' this new song I've found
My friend comes and breaks my flow
Says "Hey man, now don't you know that
Manchester's got no sea
That's just some bad geography
This Manchester's got no bay
That's the one in the USA"

No, Manchester's got no sea
But somehow it feels good to me
Let's ride the magic bus again
Or maybe take the midland train to
Manchester proud and free
A revolution's happening to me
Right here in Manchester NOT by the sea
