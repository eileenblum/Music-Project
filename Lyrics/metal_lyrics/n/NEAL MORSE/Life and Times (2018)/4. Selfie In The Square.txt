I got a day off in Luxembourg
I think I'll take a walk around
And even though I'm lonely
I'll walk my blues away
The stores are open, the pastry shops
Glistening red and sweet
And all the people working
It's just a normal day

But you would have made it like a holiday
I miss your laugh, I miss your mood, I miss your spicy attitude
And we could have coffee at a sidewalk cafÃ©
But you're not here, you're way out there
So I'll take a selfie in the square and post to you

Cathedral bells are ringing now
Singing of time gone by
And all the children playing
Just like they always have
In the square by the grand hotel
People have brought their wares
And there are bright flowers yellow
It's just a normal day

But you would have made it like a holiday
I miss your laugh, I miss your mood, I miss your spicy attitude
And we could have coffee at a sidewalk cafÃ©
But you're not here, you're way out there
So I'll take a selfie in the square and post to you

You would have loved it here today
In its perfect providential way
And my heart just longs to share
The timeless time, the selfie in the square

But you would have made it like a holiday
I miss your laugh, I miss your mood, I miss your spicy attitude
And we could have coffee at a sidewalk cafÃ©
But you're not here, you're way out there
So I'll take a selfie in the square and post to you

Yeah, you're not here, you're way out there
This song is my selfie in the square to post you

I got a day off in Luxembourg...
