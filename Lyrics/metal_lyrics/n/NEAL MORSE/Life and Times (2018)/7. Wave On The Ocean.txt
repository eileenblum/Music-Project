You make me feel, you make me feel
Like a wave on the ocean, a wave on the ocean
In the summertime
You make me feel, you make me feel
Like a wave on the ocean, a wave on the ocean
In the summertime

You make me feel so alive
Like somehow I'm in the right place, right time
Let's get into my car and just drive
'Cause every place we go will have this feeling
Because of what I'm feelin' right now

You make me feel, you make me feel
Like a wave on the ocean, a wave on the ocean
In the summertime
You make me feel, you make me feel
Like a wave on the ocean, a wave on the ocean
In the summertime

There's so much more I don't know
But you are like a jewel in a fountain
Let's take the coast to San Francisco
Or we can just hang out in the harbor
It doesn't really matter because...

You make me feel, you make me feel
Like a wave on the ocean, a wave on the ocean
In the summertime
You make me feel, you make me feel
Like a wave on the ocean, a wave on the ocean
In the summertime

Man, I can feel it!
A love that feels so free
And it's keeping me alive
Man, I can feel it!
A love that feels so free
And it's keeping me alive

You make me feel, you make me feel
Like a wave on the ocean, a wave on the ocean
In the summertime
You make me feel, you make me feel
Like a wave on the ocean, a wave on the ocean
In the summertime

Man, I can feel it!
A love that feels so free
And it's keeping me alive
Man, I can feel it!
A love that feels so free
And it's keeping me alive

'Cause your love is like an ocean
