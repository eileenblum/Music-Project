Once upon a time I walked upon this land alone
Livin' like a lonely stranger lookin' for a home
Then in revelry your melody began to sing
Back when it was only you and me and everything

It was only you and me and everything
Pourin' down like water
It was only you and me and everything
God loves His sons and daughters
We were so happy havin' nothing
We only had each other
And the song we'd sing
Back when it was only you and me and everything

We still talk about the good old days in the cubby hole
Me, a broken-down musician with a zero cash flow
You a 30 something, single mom whose eyes were sad
I loved you and I loved your son, thought maybe I could be his dad

It was only you and me and everything
Pourin' down like water
It was only you and me and everything
God loves His sons and daughters
We were so happy havin' nothing
We only had each other
And the song we'd sing
Back when it was only you and me and everything

Pourin' down like water
Sleepin' on a broken spring
Love was flowing over
Just you and me and everything
You and me and everything

It was only you and me and everything
Pourin' down like water
It was only you and me and everything
God loves His sons and daughters
We were so happy havin' nothing
Babe, we only had each other
And the song we'd sing
Back when it was only you and me

They were the best years I'd seen
Back when it was only you and me and everything
