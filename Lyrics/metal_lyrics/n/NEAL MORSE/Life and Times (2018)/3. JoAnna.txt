I've been lost in a cloud of "remember when"
Life was up on the timberline where we'd been
There's a place that I go and I don't always know
If it's dusk or dawn
And I wish you were her just to hear what I hear
'Cause I miss your song

JoAnna, I thought it was me you would give your life to
JoAnna, I'll always believe that one day I'll find you
There's a song in my soul
Only you and me know
And it's playing on
Sometimes it's quiet
I try to deny it
But still my heart sings for JoAnna

I do the best that I can through my humdrum day
I try to be everywhere I am, but you take me away
And I wish I could change and not feel so strange
But I'm in the cloud
And I try hard to file it away where I hide
What I can't say out loud

JoAnna, I thought it was me you would give your life to
JoAnna, I'll always believe that one day I'll find you
There's a song in my soul
Only you and me know
And it's playing on
Sometimes it's quiet
I try to deny it
But still my heart sings for JoAnna

I've hoped and I've prayed you would know
But I've made it so hard
JoAnna â I fear that it's true it will always be you in my heart

JoAnna, I thought it was me you would give your life to
JoAnna, I'll always believe that one day I'll find you
There's a place we can go
Where we won't always know
If it's dusk or dawn
We have a song that is timeless
You left it in silence
But still my heart sings for JoAnna
