[I. No Separation]

Now there is no separation
Standing in the culmination
Of the very love we've never known

Now that we are back together
Striving to be one forever
Let this be the time we call our own

One mind learning one, two, three
One voice singing ecstasy
One heart changing full and free
One love forging unity

Now the way is open for us
A sacrifice made to restore us
To be bring us back the way we used to be

As we once were in the garden
Through his son he gave the pardon
Now we can come back as priests and kings!

[Chorus]

One mind learning one, two, three
One voice singing ecstasy
One heart changing full and free
One love forging unity
It will be......oh my God...

[II. Grand Finale]

[III. Make Us One]

One heart
One voice
One love
One spirit

On our knees with open arms with worship in one spirit

Make us one

Precious Father
Make us one
Make us one
Make us one
