Author of confusion you play inside my mind and I want to run
But where can I hide?
Author of confusion your aim is to confound 'til I do not know
Which is up or down?
Author of confusion you play inside my mind and I want to run
But where can I hide?
"Author of confusion you start an endless chase; thoughts start running 'round"
Never find their place
Author of confusion your aim is to confound 'til I do not know
Which is up or down?

Low or high
The truth is I don't know

Author of confusion you play inside my mind and I want to run
But where can I hide?
"Author of confusion you start an endless chase; thoughts start running 'round"
But never find their place
Author of confusion your aim is to confound 'til I do not know
Which is up or down?

Day or night
Who knows right from wrong?

How long will stay tied to the mast?
How long 'til you reach for me at last?
Aren't you tired of living in the cold?
How long 'til you come to claim the gold?

You are like a raven in the night
You fly high but you're sleeping in the light
The waves will crash and the mighty winds will roar
Why can't we be the way we were before?

Author of confusion you play inside my mind
Author of confusion you live to make me blind

Author of confusion you play inside my mind and I want to run
But where can I hide?
"Author of confusion you start an endless chase; thoughts start running 'round"
Never find their place
Author of confusion your aim is to confound 'til I do not know
Which is up or down?
