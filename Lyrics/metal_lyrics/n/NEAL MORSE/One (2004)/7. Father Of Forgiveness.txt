Who's that up the road?
The man who went his own way
Who wasted all his winnings
Has he come home to stay?
The son who'd lost his way
Is back among the living
Let's take it back to the beginning...

Oh, Father I've returned
I'm sorry I was wrong
I feel so undeserving
After all I've done
But I see your open eyes
And I feel your spirit rising in my chest
You're the Father of forgiveness (I've come home)
You're the Father of forgiveness

Now that we are here
And after all the tears
Father what do you want from me?
All I have is yours
I don't have much to give
But a heart that needs forgiving
The flesh is tired but the spirit's willing

Oh, Father I've returned
The one who left alone
And you give me your kingdom
And tell me it's my own
And I see your open arms
And I know that I have found my place of rest (the man's home)
In the Father of forgiveness (I've come home)
You're the Father of forgiveness

No need to run
Under the son
You are a brother

Answer the call
He loves us all
Just as the other

Just take the fall in total trust
Like a child trust it's mother

Let's reach up to the Father (in Jesus Christ)
Let's reach up to the Father (in Jesus Christ)
Let's reach up to the Father (in Jesus Christ)
Let's reach up to the Father!

Oh, Father I've returned
I'm sorry I was wrong
I feel so undeserving
After all I've done
And I see your open arms
And I know that I have found my place of rest (the man's home)
In the Father of forgiveness (the man's home -I've come home -- the man's home)
Oh, Father of forgiveness (welcome home)
