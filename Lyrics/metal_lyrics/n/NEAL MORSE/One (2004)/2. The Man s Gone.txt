Cast out from the place of Eden
A mighty gulf placed in between them
Look around but no one's seen them together anymore

The favored son is now out wandering
Steeped in sin and money laundering
But very rarely ever pondering what his life is for

The man's gone to make his way alone
The man's gone to make his way alone

The mind got large beyond it's station
Took full charge of his destination
Became a God of his own creation
Everything was his

In the stocks he made a killing
Invented games that he kept winning
But never really quite fulfilling on who he really is

The man's gone to make his way alone
The man's gone to make his way alone
(We were of one mind and now he's gone)
The man's gone to make his way alone
The man's gone to turn his heart to stone
The man's gone to make his way alone
