What I feel I can't say
But my love is there for you anytime of day
But if it's not love that you need
Then I'll try my best to make everything succeed

Tell me what is my life without your love?
Tell me who am I without you by my side?

What I know I can't do
If I give my loveness to everyone like you
But if it's not love that you need
Then I'll try my best to make everything succeed

Tell me what is my life without your love?
Tell me who am I without you by my side?

What I feel I can't say
But my love is there for you anytime of day
But if it's not love that you need
Then I'll try my best to make everything succeed

Tell me what is my life without your love?
Tell me who am I without you by my side?
