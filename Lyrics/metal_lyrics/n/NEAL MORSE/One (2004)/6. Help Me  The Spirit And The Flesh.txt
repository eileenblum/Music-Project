Help me I have fallen
And I can't get up
Help me I've used razors
To heal me where I'm cut

Help me I've used chemicals
To ease the pain
What was pink is now purple
What was clean is now stained

Help me I'm in danger
I just know I am
I've become a stranger
In my own homeland

Fear has crept upon me
Like a shadow from the grave
What I thought was freedom
Has now chained me like a slave

Help me I have fallen and I can't get up
But I believe that you can lift me up
If you're real God please lift me up

Help me I'm in trouble
I can hear the lions roar
Being drawn closer
To the threshing floor

I invented my own wisdom
Like a counterfeiter's stash
But I couldn't create my own heaven
Just a lot of worthless trash

[Chorus]

Please lift me up
Help me
Help me
Help me....

I have heard you crying in the night
I have heard your prayers at the morning light
I have loved you since before your birth
Now I'll dwell among you on the earth
I'll send my son...

He will raise the dead
The starving shall be fed
He will take your pain
Your suffering and shame
He will span the crest
Between the spirit and the flesh
He will raise the dead

Jesus came to lift us from the mud
God in dwelling in real flesh and blood
"Don't be angry; he just loves you so"
Let his spirit come and take control
It has begun....

Jesus understands
The heart of every man
He can feel your pain
Your suffering and shame
He has spanned the crest
Between the spirit and the flesh
He has raised the dead

Jesus understands
The heart of every man
He will take your pain
Your suffering and shame
Though the soul had died
It can be made alive
The holy place was closed
'Til Jesus rose!
When he spanned the crest
Between the spirit and the flesh
