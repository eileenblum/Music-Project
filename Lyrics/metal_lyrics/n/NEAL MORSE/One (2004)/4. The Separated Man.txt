[I. I'm In A Cage]

As the dream floats by ('neath the towering sky)
There's a move to move me forward
But it only lasts 'til I fall on yesterday

With opinions thrown (like the crowd's first stone)
And the world of men is nowhere
I have a sense of freedom but it feels so far away

'Cause I'm in a cage (of my own making)
I never wanted to be this way
I'm in a cage (my heart is breaking)
But I'll tough it out today

I could move way in (I could move way out)
I could move all the way to Cairo
"But someone would be there; someone that I know too well"

I wanna change my mind (wanna change my heart)
I just need some relief but I know
That it just won't come, that is as long as I'm myself

'Cause I'm in a cage (of my own making)
I never wanted to be this way
I'm in a cage (my heart is breaking)
But I'll tough it out today

I'm in a cage (of my own making)
And now I forgot what the reason is
I'm in a cage (the toll's been taking)
But I guess that's all there is....

There's a reason why the storm is raging
There's a reason why you feel alone (the man's gone to make his way alone)
There's a reason why your soul's been caged in
Can't you feel your need to come back home? (the man's gone)
Feel your need to come back home (the man's gone)
Feel your need to come back home

[II. I Am The Man]

I can't see your throne
So I will build my own
I'll build it high and tall
The world will see I don't need YOU
At all

Look how far I've come
The poor abandoned son
My cities scrape to the sky
I believe in myself
I believe that I can fly....fly...

FLY HIGH!

I am what I say I am
I am the man

If I don't like the deal
I'll invent what's real
If this creates some confusion
I just need a bigger and better illusion

I am what I say I am
I am the man

One hope
One life
One eternal fact
You're a
Part of me
And I want you back

One hope
One life
One eternal soul
One hand
Reaching
All is ever whole
And you won't find me
By living
For the flesh
'Til you come home
I won't let you rest

[III. The Man's Gone (Reprise)]

The man's gone he doesn't need a thing
The man's gone to crown himself as king

The man's gone to make is way alone
The man's gone to make is way alone
The man's gone to turn his heart to stone
The man's gone to make is way alone

IV- Something Within Me Remembers

But something within me remembers
But something within me remembers
But something within me remembers
Deep within my heart
I remember the feeling together
When everything was part of my world
And I was part of everything
I felt a child of the King
