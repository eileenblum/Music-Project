[Jesus:]
I've come to be baptized by you, John
Let all the writings be fulfilled

[John the Baptist:]
We all have been praying for so long
To see the Father's perfect will

[Jesus and John :]
And all things fulfilled and all things we build
And all things are willed by the God of heaven
The whole human race in mercy and grace
Beholding the face of the God of heaven

[Jesus, John and others:]
Him who is true has come unto you
Do all you that you do for the God of heaven
With light shown around His glory is found
Love has come down by the God of heaven's might
Received in our sight â is heaven's open light!

[God speaks from heaven]

[God:]
This is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased
And before Him everyone shall bow on their knees
This is my beloved Son let His day begin
Hear the host of heaven come and usher Him in
Let love begin
This is my Son...hear Him...hear Him!
