[Jesus:]
Well you have spoken, Simon Bar-Jonah
You've heard from God and not flesh and blood
You are now Peter, the rock is unbroken
On this revelation I'll build my love
And I'll give the keys to the kingdom
To you who receive the Son
The keys to the kingdom are yours and I give them for free

[Judas:]
Finally we'll conquer, conquer the Romans
They've killed our children on holy ground
I will have vengeance; their backs will be broken
By the power of God we will strike them down

[Mary:]
May we come also? Is the way open?
Who can receive such salvation?

[Jesus:]
All who are seeking with hearts wide open
They can be part of my nation
And I'll give the keys to the kingdom
To you who will overcome
The keys to the kingdom are yours and I give them for free
I'll give the keys to the kingdom
To those who receive the Son
The keys to the kingdom are given
To one who is true
Now I give them to you!

[God:]
This is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased
And before Him everyone shall bow on their knees
This is my beloved Son let His reign begin
But He first must overcome and suffer for men
He'll die for your sins
This is my Son
My treasure, my pearl
Who takes on the sins of the world

[Jesus:]
I must go to Jerusalem
To suffer at the hands of men
It's my destiny
It is what must be
When him that they will crucify
Will for the sins of many die
Remember me
Remember me

[Peter:]
Oh no, Jesus this is wrong
Over my dead body they will come
'Cause I will follow you anywhere
Says I who have been with you everywhere
Yes I will follow you anywhere
Anywhere, but to the cross
