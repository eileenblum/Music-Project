[Time has passed and Jesus is now famous throughout Israel. Caiaphas, the high priest, and the religious leaders are plotting against him]

[Priests and scribes:]
Oh my, we let it go by but we can't deny the things that He's done
Who knew? Now what shall we do?
The crowd thinks it's true, they think He's the one
They think He's the one

[Caiaphas:]
You fools you know nothing
This cannot go on
One way or another
This Jesus is done
It's not right that the nation
Should suffer the loss
For the good of the people
He must go to the cross

[Cast:]
Oh my, we let it go by but we can't deny the things that He's done
Who knew? Now what shall we do?
The crowd thinks it's true, they think He's the one

[Pharisee 1:]
But how shall we do it?
The masses will cry
They might turn against us
If Jesus will die

[Caiaphas:]
Get the Romans to do it
They're dogs anyway
Get our captors to kill Him
And the world will be saved

[Cast:]
Oh my, we let it go by but we can't deny the things that He's done
Who knew? Now what shall we do?
The crowd thinks it's true, they think He's the one

[Pharisee 2:]
The new kid, I saw what He did
We must keep it hid before we're undone

[Caiaphas:]
Oh my, we let it go by but this is the time
This Jesus is done
Jesus is done

[Cast:]
Oh my, we let it go by but we can't deny the things that He's done
Who knew? Now what shall we do?
The crowd thinks it's true they think He's the one

[Caiaphas:]
Jesus! You're finished now
We're gonna put You down
Jesus! You're finished now
We gonna, we gonna, we gonna put ya down
For the good of the people
He must go to the cross!
