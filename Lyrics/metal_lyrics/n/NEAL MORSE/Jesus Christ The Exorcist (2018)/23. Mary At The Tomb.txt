[3 days later]

[Mary:]
It is dark
It has been three days since they killed Him
All are gone
Even Peter says, "I never knew Him."
But I will go
I will seek my Lord
Though the man is dead
I will go to Him
To anoint His body
What is this?
What has happened to my Lord Jesus?
What have they done now?
Who rolled the great stone?
He's gone!
Oh my God, they've taken my Jesus
I must tell Peter
I can't bear this alone

[Jesus appears. Mary mistakes Him for the gardener]

[Jesus:]
Woman, why do you weep?
Whom do you seek?
Who is your Lord?

[Mary:]
They have carried Him away
Won't you tell me where they've laid Him?
I have nowhere else to turn
So here I'll stay

[Jesus reveals himself]

[Jesus:]
Mary, Mary

[Mary:]
Rabbi! Jesus!
