[Caiaphas and the Pharisees continue to plot to kill Jesus]

[Pharisees:]
We're gathered here today for one good reason
And it's not to celebrate the holy season

[Pharisee 2:]
Jesus, He has got the nerve
To come to the feast
He's come to disturb the peace

[Pharisees:]
Now that that's been said let's get right to it
We all want Him dead but how to do it?

[Pharisee 3:]
There is one among the twelve
Who could be some help

[Caiaphas:]
This could be the chance we've waited for
Bring him at once this conspirator
But just keep it quiet or we'll start a war

[The devil enters into the mind of Judas]

[The devil:]
I'm the watcher of the red skies
The spirit of death
I am speaking in his mind
He repeats what I said
I'm the voice inside his head
Come on Judas take him over
He's as crazy as they say
Think of all the good that you'll do
With the money they'll pay
Judas now be on your way!

[Judas goes to the Pharisees]

[Judas:]
I know a place where He can be found
Not far from these gates but far from the crowd
There you can arrest Him quietly

[Caiaphas:]
Here is the cash give us the lowdown
Where does He go when no one's around?

[Judas:]
I hope you know this is very hard for me...
At night, in the Garden of Gethsemane
Because dark is the night
Please don't leave us alone
'Cause we all need your light in our souls
Jesus stand up and fight
Bring back all that they stole
'Cause we all need your light in our souls

[Jesus and the disciples spend the night in the garden of Gethsemane]

[Jesus:]
Will you wait and pray with me?
While my soul is in agony
Will you stay with me for one single hour?
Oh Father, take this cup from your only Son
Still not my will but thine be done
And to you be all the glory and power, Oh Father...
Here they come...
The Son of Man is betrayed into their hands
Let us go, my betrayer is at hand

[Soldiers led by Judas come to arrest Jesus. Peter begins to fight them.]

[Jesus:]
Peter, stop! It will not go down like this
And Judas would you betray me with a kiss?
You had to come in the dark of night
I was with you every day
This is your hour and I will not fight
This is my Father's way

[Guard:]
Come on, Judas let us take him away!

[The soldiers lead Jesus away]
