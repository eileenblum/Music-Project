[The soldiers and priests bring Jesus to Pontius Pilate, the Roman ruler in Jerusalem]

[Pilate:]
What is this man accused of? What law did he break?
What has he done to fill you with such murdering hate?

[Caiaphas:]
He stirs up the people
Incites them to sin
He says they shouldn't pay the tax
To Caesar our friend

[Pilate:]
I have to know why I demand it

[Priests:]
Oh, Jesus must die

[Pilate:]
If you have proof I must have it

[Priests:]
Oh, hear our angry cry

[Pilate:]
I have to know why I demand it

[Priests:]
Oh, Jesus must die

[Pilate:]
If you have proof I must have it

[Priests:]
We're sons of Abraham
We cannot kill this man
Our law says we can't crucify
So you must send Jesus to die!

[Pilate to Jesus:]
Tell me what did you do?
Don't you know that I have authority?
Are you really the Christ, the King of the Jews?

[Jesus:]
My kingdom's not of this world
I was born to do one thing only
To be a light to the world and to witness the truth

[Pilate:]
What is truth?
You have a custom that at the Passover one man
Should be released to you
Do you want the King of the Jews?

[Crowd:]
Crucify Him! Crucify Him!
We want Barabbas the murderer
We deny Him! Crucify Him!
We have no King but Caesar

[Pilate:]
I wash my hands of this whole affair
His blood is on your heads
Take Him away

[Jesus is taken to be crucified]

[Jesus:]
Father why have You forsaken me?
Everyone's gone but my mother and John and these few
I know this is how it had to be
It's finished now and I'm giving my life up to You

[Jesus dies on the cross]
