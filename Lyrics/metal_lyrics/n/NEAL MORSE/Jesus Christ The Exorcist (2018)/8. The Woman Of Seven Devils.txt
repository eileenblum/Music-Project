[A woman tormented by demons meets Jesus]

[Mary:]
I'm the woman of seven devils
I'm a child of the night
My name's Mary but some call me trouble
Live a tormented life
I'm the sweetest of painted ladies
A little crazy that's true
Just be careful or some of my demons
Might get thrown on to you
'Cause I get high every night and day
Rollin' 'til I roll away
I'm tired of payin' dues
Oh but nothin' takes my blues away
Seven devils got me in chains
I'm the woman of seven devils
And I'll be sweet as a child
Then next minute I'm seein' double in a rage goin' wild
And there's no one that can ever help me
Been this way all my life
I'm not tryin' to be nothin' I can't be
I'm just tryin' to survive
'Cause I get high every night and day
Rollin' 'til I roll away
I'm tired of payin' dues
But nothin' takes my blues away
Seven devils got me in chains

[Jesus:]
Woman with the troubled soul
You stand accused
But I do not condemn you
I do not condemn you, no
If you have faith as the smallest seed
You can be healed you can be freed
I ask you, will you be made whole?

[Mary:]
I'm the woman of seven devils
Can't you see what I am?
Can you save this psychotic woman?
Lord, change me if you can
'Cause I get high every day and night
And I'm sick and tired of livin' this life
I'd really like to change
But what could take this strange away
Seven devils
All through my brain
Oh Jesus, break these chains!

[Jesus casts the demons out of Mary]
