[The Devil leaves Jesus and he begins his ministry]

[Jesus:]
Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
Turn from your ways of madness be made whole
This is a day of healing in the land
Turn around with your body, mind, and soul
Come and bring me your sick outsiders that you've cast away
Tell all the lowly losers God has made a way
For the low there's a highway
For the low there's a highway
The Spirit of God is upon me
There's good news
He sent me to bring back the eyesight to the blind
And nobody that will come I will refuse
Follow me and we'll drink the brand new wine
Come and bring me your sick outsiders that you've cast away
Tell all the lowly losers God has made a way
For the low there's a highway
For the low there's a highway
For the low there's a way
Yes, for the low there's a highway
But for the low there's a way
Yes, for the low there's a highway
Blessed are those who are humble in their minds
Only the pure can hear these words I've said
Come and bring me your sick outsiders that you've cast away
Tell all the lowly losers God has made a way
Bring me your sick outsiders that you've cast away
Tell all the lowly losers God has made a way
For the low there's a highway
For the low there's a highway
For the low there's a highway
