[Peter:]
Some say You're Elijah come back from the grave
Some say You're Jeremiah but you cannot save
But I say You are the Son of God
(Not Elijah come back down)
And Your way doesn't have to be so hard
(You're the one who'll wear the crown)
Yeah, I say You are the Son of God
And we're headed for some better weather
Some say You're a faker just like all the rest
And nothing good could ever come from Nazareth
But I say you are the Son of God
(Not Elijah come back down)
And Your way doesn't have to be so hard
(You're the one who'll wear the crown)
Yeah, I say You are the Son of God
And we're headed for some better weather
Better weather
