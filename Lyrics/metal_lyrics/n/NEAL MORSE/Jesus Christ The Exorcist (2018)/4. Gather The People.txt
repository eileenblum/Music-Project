[John the Baptist:]
I can feel Him coming, feel Him coming, prepare the way
He'll reveal us, He's come to heal us
He's come to save
Be baptized and turn back to God today
I am the voice that prepares the way

[Cast:]
We can feel Him coming, feel Him coming alive today
Our hearts need washing that there'd
Be nothing to block his way

[John the Baptist:]
I'm baptizing some this is God's desire
But one's gonna come with the spirit and fire!
He will gather the people into one
And lead to the heart of the rising sun
He will gather the people into one
He will heal the people where they are
And light up the world like the morning star
He will gather the people into one
I rejoice to see his day
See him ruling in his righteousness
With a fan He'll come and blow the chaff away

[Cast:]
We rejoice to see His day
In love He'll stand victorious
The coming Christ who takes our sins away!
We can feel Him coming, feel Him coming alive today
(We rejoice to see His day)
He will deliver so come to the river be washed today
(We rejoice to see His day)
You know it's real, can you feel what the people say?
We've been waiting â for so long waiting
Today's the day!

[John the Baptist:]
He will gather the people into one
And lead to the heart of the rising sun
He will gather the people into one
He will gather the people into one

[Jesus appears at the river where John is baptizing]

Look! The man who will bring us in
Behold the Lamb who will take our sin
There he stands the foundation stone
A man like the world has never known
Stronger than Rome
He'll make our way back home
