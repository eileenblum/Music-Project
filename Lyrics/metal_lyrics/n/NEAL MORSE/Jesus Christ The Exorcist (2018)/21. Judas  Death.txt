[Judas sees that Jesus is not going to fight and runs to the temple to repent]

[Judas:]
Why is He not fighting them?
These are all but common men
David's son will surely arise
To Pilate they have brought the Son
Now I see what I have done!
I believed the Father of lies
I was wrong, Lord Jesus
I've betrayed innocent blood
I must try to make right
This evil thing that I've done
Oh, Caiaphas
I have sinned forgive me, oh Lord!

[Caiaphas:]
What is that to us?
Take back your bloody reward

[Judas:]
I know what I must do
Oh God, I loved Him too
There's only one way out of this bottomless hole
So this is how it all ends
No tears, no words, no amends
May God have mercy on my wretched soul
Here I go!
Here I go!

[Judas hangs himself]
