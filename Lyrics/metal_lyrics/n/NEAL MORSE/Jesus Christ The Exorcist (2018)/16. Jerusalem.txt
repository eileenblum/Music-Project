[It's Passover and the people are gathering in Jerusalem]

[Cast:]
Jerusalem our city in the sky
Our song of ascent is relentless to God we will cry
Jerusalem from Judah up to Dan
We come to sing praises and eat of the Passover Lamb
Everyone dance and sing
Singing Hosanna
Everyone celebrate the day
Dance and sing, everyone singing Hosanna
Everyone celebrate the day

[Men:]
Jerusalem the talk's all over town
Will Jesus show up and will this be the final showdown?

[Women:]
We've seen Him heal the sick and raise the dead
Some say He's Messiah

[Man 1:]
Some say He's just sick in the head

[Cast:]
Everyone dance and sing
Singing Hosanna
Everyone celebrate the day
Dance and sing, old and young, singing Hosanna
Everyone celebrate the day

[Mary:]
Jerusalem I feel the tension here
I have great sorrow for I know the ending is near
I'll wash His feet with water from my tears
No matter what happens I'll stay with offering and prayers

[Caiaphas:]
Jerusalem this man is not your king
Jesus, tell them to be silent, they're making a scene

[Jesus:]
Jerusalem if you should hold your peace
Even the rocks will cry out all creation will sing!

[Cast:]
Everyone dance and sing
Singing Hosanna
Everyone celebrate the day
Dance and sing, old and young, singing Hosanna
Everyone celebrate the day
Hosanna, God save now, Hosanna!
