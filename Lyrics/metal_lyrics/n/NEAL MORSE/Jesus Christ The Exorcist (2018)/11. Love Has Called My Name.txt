[Jesus calls his disciples and his ministry is gathering fame throughout the land]

[Disciple 1:]
I am following what I feel from what
I've seen I know it's real

[Judas:]
Jesus Christ â the son of man
All power of heaven's in His hand

[Disciple 1:]
And we are all disciples
Trying to understand

[Judas and disciples:]
For love has called my name
And now I'm giving everything
Because love has called my name
I'll follow... I'll follow

[Disciple 1:]
I've seen Him heal my daughter's heart

[Judas:]
I've seen Him make the lame man walk

[Disciple 1:]
I've had devils cast out I thought were me

[Judas:]
He's the master of my destiny

[Disciple 1:]
And wherever He goes I go as close as I can be

[Judas and disciples:]
'Cause love has called my name
And now I'm giving everything
Because love has called my name
This I know
Love called my name
And what I've lost I count as gain
Because love has called my name
I'll follow I'll follow
I will follow, I will follow

[Jesus:]
You are the ones I've chosen to be here
My friends the 12 disciples gathered near
What do they say, who is this son of man?
What do you think?
Who do you say I am?
Who do you say I am?
