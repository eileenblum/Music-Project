[Jesus stands beaten and bloody before the high Priest and council]

[Caiaphas:]
We're gathered here
To pass judgment on Jesus
We've heard the witnesses
Does He deserve death?
[to Jesus:]
What say you?
I want to hear it from your own lips
Are you the Christ?
Are you the Son of the blessed?

[Jesus:]
I am!
And you will see the Son of the most high
Seated at the right hand of God on His throne
I am!
And I will come in power and glory
With the clouds of heaven I'll come for my own

[Caiaphas:]
Blasphemy! Blasphemy! Heresy! Death to thee!

[Priests:]
Blasphemy! Blasphemy! Heresy! Death to thee!

[Caiaphas:]
Oh my God it's Blasphemy! Heresy!
Death to thee! It must be!

[Priests:]
Blasphemy! Heresy! Death to thee!
It must be!

[Caiaphas and priests:]
Feel our hatred!

[Peter is looking on from afar when he is found out]

[Servant girl:]
This man was with him
I know he was with him
I've seen him with my own eyes

[Peter:]
What are you saying?
I don't know what you're saying
I tell you this servant girl lies

[Man 1:]
Yes, I saw you â I know I saw you
And your accent is from Galilee

[Peter:]
I don't know him
I swear I don't know him
Whoever you saw was not me...
I swear! I don't know him!

[Peter and Jesus' eyes meet, then Peter flees the scene in anguish]
