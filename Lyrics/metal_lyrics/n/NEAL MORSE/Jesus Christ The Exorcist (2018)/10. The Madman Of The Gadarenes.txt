[Jesus encounters a man possessed by many demons]

[The madman:]
I'm the madman of the Gadarenes
Do you like my brand new clothes?
Among these tombs you will find me
How long I've been here no one knows...

[1st demon:]
I have been in this man many years
And there are some more of us living here
We are called Legion

[2nd demon:]
I have been in this man many years ago we were lost
But now we're here in this man... what?

[3rd demon:]
I've been in this man many years
There are many of us
Years ago we took him over and now
We are like a Legion in him

[4th demon:]
I have been here
What will you do will you torture us now?
There are many of us here and you know
We're a Legion
We are many

[Demons all together:]
We know who You are
The holy one of God!

[1st demon:]
I put murder in his heart

[2nd demon:]
I destroyed his careful mind

[3rd demon:]
I put fear into his eyes

[4th demon:]
I made him the crazy kind

[1st demon:]
What have You to do with us Jesus
Son of the most high God
Son of the God
Do not torment me

[2nd demon:]
What have You to do with us
Mighty Son of God I will beg
Oh Son of God, Son of God
Please do not torment me

[3rd demon:]
What will You do with all of us
Son of the most high God
I will beg You Son of the most high God
Do not torment me

[4th demon:]
What have You to do with us now
Son of the most high
I am begging you oh, Son of God
Son of God please don't torment me

[Demons all together:]
We know who You are
The holy one of God!

[Jesus:]
Come out, come out!
You've been hurting him for too long
Come out, come out!
It's time for you to be gone
Go back to where you belong
In the name of God's only Son
You demons be gone!

[Demons all together:]
Please don't send us into nothing
Send us in the pigs we're begging
Crying out as one we're saying
Help us Jesus!
We obey you knowing you have
All authority and we have none
You're like your Father
Please have mercy Jesus
We know who You are
The holy one of God!

[Jesus:]
Go!

[The demons are cast into a herd of pigs who then run off a cliff into the sea. The man is now of a sound mind for the first time]

[Jesus:]
Are you alright now?

[Madman:]
Yes I feel fine
It feels like sunlight
Inside my mind

[Jesus:]
Go on home
Tell everyone you know
God has made you whole
