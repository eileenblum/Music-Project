[3 1â2 years earlier. Israel is under the oppressive rule of Rome]

[Israelite 1:]
We sweat out in the sun outside beloved Jerusalem to pay Caesar Augustus

[Israelite 2:]
We're under Herod's hand â the Romans rape and pillage our land
The land that God gave to us

[Cast:]
But we're going to make a getaway
When the Savior comes to take away our pain

[Israelite 1:]
King David prophesied there'll come a Son with God on his side to conquer our enemies

[Israelite 2:]
I wish he'd come right now â turn Caesar's sword into a plow

[Cast:]
Come, Savior, hear our plea
But we're going to make a getaway
When the Savior comes to take away our pain
Yes, we're waiting for a better day
When the glory's restored to Israel again
