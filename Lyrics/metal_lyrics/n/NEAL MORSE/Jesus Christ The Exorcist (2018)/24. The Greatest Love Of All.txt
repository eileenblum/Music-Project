[Mary:]
I can't believe it, is it really You?

[Jesus:]
I always said that I would come to you
Now everything is yours

[Together:]
Just like you said it would be

[Jesus:]
Flowing from the source

[Mary:]
I feel so full and so free
'Cause this is the greatest love of all
This is what we are living for

[Jesus:]
I am yours, I am yours
[Mary:]
No one could ever give you any more

[Together:]
Than this love that falls like heaven's rain

[Jesus:]
Heaven's rain
You came to me when all my friends had gone

[Mary:]
My love for You it kept me holdin' on

[Jesus:]
In a little while you won't see me anymore

[Mary:]
No not again

[Jesus:]
But through the Spirit you'll have me
Like never before

[Together:]
And this is the greatest love of all
This is what we have waited for
No one could ever give you any more
Than this love that falls like heaven's rain
When the rain falls down from heaven

[Jesus:]
This is the greatest Love of all

[Mary:]
Oh, I will follow you

[Jesus:]
This is what we are living for

[Mary:]
Lord, I will go with You

[Jesus:]
No one could ever ask for any more

[Mary:]
Lord, You are all there is...
This is the greatest Love of all

[Jesus:]
I will never leave you or forsake you
[Mary:]
This is what we have waited for

[Jesus:]
I will never leave you comfortless

[Mary:]
No one could ever ask for any more

[Jesus:]
I'll give you power from on high...

[Together:]
Than this love that falls like heaven's rain

[Mary:]
This is the greatest Love of all

[She goes to embrace Him]

[Jesus:]
Don't cling to me
'Cause I have not yet ascended
Go tell my brothers
I have risen from the dead!
