[Jesus:]
Get behind me Satan
You oppose the things of God within your mind
Get behind me Satan
I must drink this cup of wrath for all mankind
If you want to follow me you must take up your cross and get in line
He who saves his life shall lose and he who loses for my sake will find
Get behind me Satan
You are Satan if you seek the things of man
They will raise me up but on the third day I will surely rise again
What profit for a man if he should gain
The world and lose his very soul?
It's the Father's will that I must die
You cannot stop me, Peter, I must go!
Get behind me Satan
You oppose the things of God within your mind
Get behind me Satan
I must drink this cup of wrath for all mankind
Get behind me Satan!
