[The celebration fades away and we look into the mind of Judas]

[Judas:]
I've been with Jesus since it began
From winter days to desert sand
I was there at the wedding
Saw water turn to wine
But now He is talking 'bout giving in
And I don't see how we can win
He must show His hand
We are running out of time
Because dark is the night
We won't make it alone
'Cause we all need Your light
For our souls
Yes, we need Your supply
'Cause we've got hearts full of holes
Yes, we all need Your light for our souls
Jesus there must be some other way
Of conquering the enemy
How can You help us
If You are dead and gone?
And I can't believe that we've worked so hard
We trusted You, we trusted God
That it would all come to nothing
I cannot overcome
Because dark is the night
We won't make it alone
Yes, we all need Your light
For our souls
Yes, we need Your supply
'Cause we've got hearts full of holes
We need glory and light for our souls
Because dark is the night
We won't make it alone
Yes, we all need Your light
For our souls
Bring Your power and might
Restore all that they stole
We need glory and light for our souls

[Women:]
Hosanna, God save now, Hosanna!
