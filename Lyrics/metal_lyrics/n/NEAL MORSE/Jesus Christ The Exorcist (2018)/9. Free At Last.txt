[Mary:]
All out of love
All out of time
Trapped in a world
In chains in my mind
Ashamed of the things I've done
The lost and the lonely one
Then Jesus came
Like a light from above
Made a heart full of anger
A heart full of love
And now as I live and breathe
With everything I believe
And I know that it's real
From the way that I feel
And I feel like I'm free at last
And the woman I've been
All my guilt and my sin
Now I know it's all in the past
And I'm free at last
Oh what relief to have it all gone
The devils and demons that held me so long
Now I'm up in the skies
As the spirit begins to rise
And I know that it's real
From the way that I feel
And I feel like I'm free at last
And the woman I've been
All my guilt and my sin
Now I know it's all in the past
Oh I'm free at last
Yes I'm free at last
Oh thank God I am free
And I know that it's real
From the way that I feel
And I feel like I'm free at last
And the woman I've been
All my guilt and my sin
Now I know it's all in the past
And I'm free at last
Oh I'm free at last
Oh I'm free
Oh Jesus set me free
And I'm free at last
Thank God Almighty I am free at last
