Fantasy worlds and barren lands
Made for unknown Gods by trembling human hands
Deceived from birth
Conceived to die
Misleading lives without a reason why

Disillusioned souls causing bloody tears
The truth masquerading with Smoke and Mirrors
Disillusioned souls causing bloody tears
The truth masquerading with Smoke, Smoke and Mirrors

Born into bondage as slaves to sin
Inspired to run races that we cannot win
Cleansing water
In a bowl of brass
Remains in obscurity behind darkened glass

Disillusioned souls causing bloody tears
The truth masquerading with Smoke and Mirrors
Disillusioned souls causing bloody tears
The truth masquerading with Smoke and Mirrors

Now we are here among the blind
We seek to know the one beyond all space and time
Reality is sweet for sure
For all of this confusion there is only one cure

He's planted in our souls
Life beyond the years
We will not be victims of Smoke and Mirrors

He's planted in our souls
Life beyond these tears
And we shall be like Him beyond
Smoke and Mirrors
