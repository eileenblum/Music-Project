What is there to say?
My face it may betray me
Thoughts have all escaped me
I'm not sure what to do
I know straight away
I never give a maybe
She looks like an actress
Waiting for her cue

Cuz now I don't think anything at all
So I'll say nothing and I hope you think I'm deep

She continues on and doesn't seem to notice
I'm the caring listener. âTell me is that true?"
She pauses and says âWell?", expecting some great saying
Silently I'm praying; I haven't got a clue

But now I don't think anything at all
So I'll say nothing and I hope you think I'm deep
Now I don't think anything at all
So I'll say nothing and I hope that you don't think that I'm a creep

While I'm ever contemplating
Awkwardness is multiplied
Suddenly I'm eloquating
Something more has touched...my mind!

What is there to say?
My face it may betray me
Thoughts have all escaped me
I'm not sure what to do 
I know straight away
I never give a maybe
She looks like an actress
Waiting for her cue

But now I don't think anything at all
So I'll say nothing and I hope you think I'm deep
