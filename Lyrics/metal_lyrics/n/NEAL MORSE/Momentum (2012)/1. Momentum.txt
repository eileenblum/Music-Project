The pedestrian auto walkway
Rushes on and its crowded today
See the jets as they jump behind you
And the light from the street it blinds you now
Neon buzz and the smell of Bombay
There's a lady who stopped; she's so afraid
And the business men fall into her
With black cases flying she goes down

You've got some new momentum
You better keep on going
Tomorrow soon will be your yesterday
You've got some new momentum
You better keep on going
You've got to move to make it all the way

So you feel like you crashed God's party
And its winding down to doomsday
How he used to call upon you
Now the wind is gone and it's got you down
But He is still in the midst of your mayday
Crying out don't stop, don't be afraid
Keep on pressing through the changes
The momentum that's moved you will not stop now

You've got some new momentum
You better keep on going
Tomorrow soon will be your yesterday
You've got some new momentum
You better keep on going
There's one who's going to take you all the way

You've got some new momentum
You better keep on going
Tomorrow soon will be your yesterday
You've got some new momentum
Move forward always knowing
Our God is going to lead you all the way
