[I. Introduction]
[Instrumental]

[II. Never Pass Away]
With the slip of hand and a boombox
I am the man with a plan and the drum drops
Going off to a place that I never knew
I don't mind doin' time goin' solo
All I know is there's so much I donât know
Iâm just lookin' for something to fall into

Iâm in control of having no control
Drudgery days I had to let them go
And seek to find
Some peace in my mind
And not look behind..

[Chorus:]
But thereâs a road in the blazing sun
There's a flow that I canât outrun
Iâve got to find my life my way
To a world that will never pass away

In the heat of the day pushinâ midnight
I got nothing to say thatâs a sound byte
Life's too short for a bottom line
I don't want a cliche or a peep show
Say what you gotta say and then let's go
The world is waiting on the other side
There was a way I lived in humble pride
Everyday in spiritual genocide
The desert sand
The days of the damned
Left holes in my hand..

[Chorus]

But there's a road in the blazing sun
There's a flow that I can't outrun
I've got to find the truth my way
To a world that will never pass away
Never pass away

The bottom drops out and you're nowhere
Nowhere to be found
Lost in the tide of the other side
In the city of the sound
It didn't take long to change you
Promised son to a re-run
But truth never dies so lift your eyes
Forward to the... forward to the sun

[III. Losing Your Soul]
Live like a face card hanginâ in the window
Youâre a big band blastinâ on the 4th of July
You got the babe Nazi - got the paparazzi
You can tell them all to wait 'cause their rules donât apply.. letâs fly!

Jesus you loved him once when you were little
But you can't play second fiddle for some pie in the sky
Now the nice kidâs cigar is gettinâ fatter
But it doesnât really matter cause we're all gonna die
And you lie Ö¾ while gain the world's control
You might be losing your soul

The Calendar kid and the thin Mad Hatter
They all keep getting fatter from the seeds that you sow
It's really all you; you tell them youâre a family
Youâre a racer-embracer but it's all just a show
So you lie Ö¾ you might hit the highest goal
But youâre still losing your soul
So you lie - while you gain the world's control
You might be losing your soul
You might be losing your soul

[IV. The Mystery]
Looking back you're reminded of the numerous losses
The losses that you knew from a previous plauge
In spite of the knowing and rather than growing
You come up with excuses intentionally vague

With obvious lack of heartfelt care
Stripped of all feeling emotionally bare
You find yourself just standing there
Trying to explain the mystery

Stagnant love of former generations
Built on pretense and conditional love
Your selfish soul feeds on past revelation
Holding the mystery in historyâs glove

With obvious lack of heartfelt care
Stripped of all feeling emotionally bare
You find yourself just standing there
Trying to explain the mystery

[V. Some Kind Of Yesterday]
Timeline
Leaves you blind
No sense of depth or height
Beyond you
You step into
The raining rays of light

Some kind of yesterday
Is calling you from worldâs away
And I've come to let you know
You canât get in without letting go
Let this other life
Have
Control

Sunshine
Pours like wine
Youâre standing at the door
A silhouette
Itâs like youâve met
But never known before

Some kind of yesterday
Is calling you from worldâs away
And I've come to let you know
You canât get in without letting go

Some kind of yesterday
Is calling you from worldâs away
The one you believed it then
Whoever love for you will never end
He's calling you to rise
Rise Again!

[VI. Never Pass Away (Reprise)]
So the days in the desert sand
Makes the way for the happy man
By the blood of his greatest friend
Comes the one who has life again

'Cause there's a road in the blazing sun
There's a truth that I can't outrun
He led me out from the smoke and ash
With his love that'll never pass away

There's not much more I have to say
But that this place isn't far away
For all the ones lookin' for a place to stand
For everyone stranded in the cold dry land

There's a road in the blazing sun
There's a truth that I canât outrun
Heâll raise us up from the smoke and ash
Thereâs a love that'll never pass away

There's a day that'll surely come
When weâll rise like the blazing sun
And we'll stand glorious at last
In a world that'll never pass
It'll never pass
It'll never pass away
