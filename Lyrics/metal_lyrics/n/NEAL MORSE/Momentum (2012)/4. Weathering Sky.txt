Out here pn a desert plain
I can't explain tho call of my soul
East looks bleak and west looks black
There's something here but the way I don't know

Weathering sky
I don't know why you call to me
Call to me again
Weathering sky
I don't know why you call to me
Let me be again
Like it would never end

High in the hills and far away
There's a land that flows with yesterday's rain
Where tomorrow waits with an open hand
And we live the plan of love beyond pain

I've swam the oceans and been dry
I've chased the mountains and been low
But now l see the sky
Turn me from the ways that hurt
Set my sights up to the sun
To the sun
Fill me with fire!

Weathering sky
I don't know why you call to me
Call to me again
Weathering sky
I don't know why you call to me
Let me be again
Like it would never end
