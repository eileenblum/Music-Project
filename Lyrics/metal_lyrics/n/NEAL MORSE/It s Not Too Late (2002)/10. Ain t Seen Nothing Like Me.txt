Adam was livin' a care free life
Nothin' to do but hang out all night
God said to Adam "I think you'll agree
You need someone to run things" so He made Eve

[CHORUS:]
(She said) I'm livin' proof God blessed His daughters
I got what you need
You've seen fire, wind and water
But you ain't seen nothin'
Oh no - you ain't seen nothin' like me

Samson was one of the lucky few
Strong as a bull and the coolest hairdo
Well, you all know that after Delila got sore
He was nothin' but a crumpled mass on the floor

[CHORUS]

She said "now don't you fret
No, don't you worry
I'll be the ghostwriter
Of the rest of HIStory"

God made woman on a beautiful day
But don't you cross her or she'll make you pay
He made her strong and he made her sweet
And if she weren't around we'd be dead in a week

[CHORUS (to end)]
