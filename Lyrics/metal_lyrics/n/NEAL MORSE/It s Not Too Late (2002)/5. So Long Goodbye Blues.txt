Wednesday
I was yesterday's news
Caught in the old
So long goodbye blues
Waiting for summer's light on my door
But summertime dreams don't live here no more

[CHORUS:]
Seems like that's all there is
So long goodbye
No matter what I wish
Or how hard I try
And me I can't lose those
So long goodbye blues

Sometimes I go out
With friends that I know
And I see the smiling people all in a row
And I wonder why they don't feel like I do
Do their lovers believe?
Do their wishes come true?

[CHORUS]

I was yesterday's news
Caught in the old
So long goodbye blues
Waiting for summer's light on my door
But summertime dreams don't live here no more
