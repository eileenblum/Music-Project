Gone - that moment just passed by
It's written in the sky out there
I hope it's somewhere
Pictures - the remnants of our lives
No camera can see quite that far
It can't see how we are

[CHORUS:]
I hope when I die
I can somehow still be with you
And re-live right now
That's all I really want to do
If time forgets when we were together
I hope the angels will remember

Smiles a million lifetimes wide
And all the tears we've cried can't be
Like drops in the sea
The big screen
That flashes at the end
I hope it lifts us high and then I will get
To see you again

[CHORUS]

Take a picture of this with your heart and keep it safe forever
Take a picture of us with your heart and we will be together

[CHORUS]

Gone - that moment just passed by...
