It could have been good
We could have been the lucky ones
But everything's changed
Man, we made it such a mess
And now you're back
Back to see if you can hurt me some more

[CHORUS:]
Oh Angie
You left me broken and now you want to come back to me
Oh Angie
My heart has spoken and I know we'll never be happy
Oh Angie

I've got no time
No time left for suffering
'Cause that's what we are
Somehow it's just that way
Now you're coming on
Just when I got out from your spell

[CHORUS]

Oh Angie
Oh Angie
You couldn't be worse for me
