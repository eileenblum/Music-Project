It's not too late to change your mind
The soul will lead you'll follow close behind
And your love will leap along
It's been asleep for so long

The drip becomes a gushing pour
You'll know it all at once what your life is for
Now it's open just a crack
When you get the chance....don't hold back

[CHORUS:]
It's not too late to change
It's not too late to be exchanged
Oh - it's not too late
The door is open wide
It's not too late to jump inside
You can twist your fate
It's not too late

There's nothing more that we can do
We chose it on our own as you will too
It can happen anytime
If you're twenty-one
Or ninety-nine

[CHORUS (to end)]
