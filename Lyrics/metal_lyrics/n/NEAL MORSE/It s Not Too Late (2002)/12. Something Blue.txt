Sharon's waiting for the other shoe to drop
Sitting there inside her empty house she walks the floor
Turns the T.V. on but she don't care
She's pretty sure she won't become a millionaire today

[CHORUS:]
She feels like something borrowed, something blue
Something pretty but ugly too
Just like something borrowed, something blue
She's like Cinderella without a shoe
Treasure Island without a clue
Just like something borrowed, something blue

Sharon's thinking "man, I've got alot to do
I'll vacuum again and maybe check for mail that no one's sent me"
She's a raging flower with the world to give
But somehow no one sees her as she really is...

[CHORUS (to end)]
