The wind and the rain
Fiercely fall
Pounding on my roof and walls
Feeling nothing like
What I thought it might
When I felt the storm begin tonight

I knew it would
Eventually
Point it's cloudy finger at me
Making me drift behind
Sadly back in time
'Til I heard a voice from somewhere inside

[CHORUS:]
"Just let the wind and the rain roll off your back
You can do anything but you can't go back
So when you're feeling pain
It ain't no ball and chain
It's just the wind and the rain"

The wind and the rain
let you know
You are always vulnerable
So if it starts to pour
And what's enough cries for more
Don't pull the shades and lock the door

[CHORUS (to end)]
