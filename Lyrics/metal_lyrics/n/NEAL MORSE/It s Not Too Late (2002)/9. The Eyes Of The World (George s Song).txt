A world so innocent so easy to face
Full of what's possible and full of God's grace
My friend helped me to see 'cause that's how he saw this place

When I was hurting he would hurt for me too
The sweetest spirit that I ever knew
And the world seems sadder now that he's not with me and you

[CHORUS:]
The eyes of the world shed a tear for my friend
But when we're set free we will see him again
Right now it's hard for us to understand

So much that happens is beyond our control
We take the part 'cause we just can't see the whole
But the one that can is now in care of our loved one's soul
Please take care of our loved one's soul

[CHORUS (to end)]
