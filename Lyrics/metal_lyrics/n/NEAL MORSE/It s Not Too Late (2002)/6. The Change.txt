Calling all people wherever you are
Get ready for the changing that's not very far and you know...
You know... yes, you know... you know

It's about changing time
It's about peace of mind
It's about falling in love for the very first time
It's about dreams and flight
Going beyond wrong and right
When the change comes everything'll be alright

Calling all people - gather around
Get ready for the changing that's got to come down and you know...
You know... yes, you know... you know

It's about changing time
It's about peace of mind
It's about falling in love like the very first time
It's about losing face
So we can win the real race
When the change comes you're gonna find your place

When the time will come - we don't know when
When the last is done we'll meet again
When the hour is here look to the sky
When the answer comes we'll all know why

Calling all people wherever you are
Get ready for the changing that's not very far

It's about changing time
It's about peace of mind
It's about falling in love like the very first time
It's about dreams and flight
Going beyond wrong and right
When the change comes everything'll be alright

It's about coming home
It's about children grown
It's about falling in love like you've never known
It's about losing face
So we can win the real race
When the change comes you're gonna find your place

People get ready the change is comin'...
