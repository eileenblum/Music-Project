Lifted and free with no weight on me
I'm running
Black was the way but my destiny
Is coming â woo!
I'm running
Got no chains hanging down on me
It's funny
How things change when your heart is free

I'm not the man I was yesterday
I'm running
I'm ready to go like a GTO engine gunning
I'm running
Got no chains hanging down on me
It's funny
How things change when your heart is free

[Instrumental interlude / Guitar solo]

Lifted and free with no place to be
I'm running
Black was the way but a brand new day is coming
Woo! I'm running
Got no chains hanging down on me
And it's funny
How things change when your heart is free
When your heart is free
When your heart is free
(But wait there's moreâ¦) but wait there's more
(But wait there's moreâ¦) but wait there's more
(But wait there's more)
Can there be more? (But wait there's more)
Can there be more? (But wait there's more)
More, more, moreâ¦ (but wait there's more)
More, more, moreâ¦ 
(More in storeâ¦)
