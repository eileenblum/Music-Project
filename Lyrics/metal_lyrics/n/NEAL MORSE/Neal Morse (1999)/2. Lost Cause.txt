I used to be a poor man
but now I'm really broke
Used to be a lemon
now I'm an artichoke
I used to be resourceful
Used to really care
I used to be on the fast track
now I'm goin' nowhere

'Cause I'm a loser, I'm a failure
I've sunk lower than a thief
I'm a dark cloud passing over
I guess you just don't care about breakin' laws
when you're a lost cause

I used to be a stranger
but now I'm really strange
They won't get me now or later
'cause I'm outta their range
I'm sick, I got a fever
or maybe I'm just sick
Go ahead and cut me
but just make it quick

'Cause I'm a loser, I'm a failure
I've sunk lower than a thief
If you got one passing over
Then I don't ever hear too much applause
'Cause I'm a lost cause

Mirror mirror inside my mind
Blow these bad thoughts away
I sure would like to feel mostly blind today
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey

I used to be a poor man
but now I'm really broke
I used to be the punchline
now I'm everyone's joke
The truth is I've outcasted myself all along
But that's all right at least I get to sing this song

I'm a loser, I'm a failure
I've sunk lower than a thief
I'm a dark cloud passing over
I'm a lost cause, I'm a failure
I've sunk lower than a thief
I'm a dark cloud passing over
I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
