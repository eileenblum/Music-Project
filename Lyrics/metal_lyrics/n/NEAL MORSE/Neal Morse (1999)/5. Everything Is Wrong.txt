All the world's a stage
and all can play their part
Words to live by, that's what she said
Things were good then
She was like money in the bank
That's exactly the words that she used

And she was talented
Dying for her art
She was a number two
who never got the part
And now everything
Everything is wrong
Everything is wrong

He painted for years
and then he painted her
World alive, colors living
And when she left
he snuck over and painted her apartment
The morning light is so unforgiving

And he was the next Van Gogh
cutting of his ear
He wanted to show up
but could only disappear
And now everything
Everything is wrong
Everything is wrong

And he was the next Van Gogh
cutting of his ear
He wanted to show up
but could only disappear
And now everything
Everything is wrong
Oh yeah, everything
Everything is wrong
Oh yes, everything
Everything is wrong
Everything is wrong
