You can't always see when you're right
And some people think you're a waste of life
And the feeling is bad at home
And you just can't go back where you came from
And you can't always see through your mind
And sometimes you feel like your flying blind

But it's your life you're living
Don't let 'em put you down
It's alright to be living out loud

You give some real good advice
That you don't ever take in your own life
But it really is no big deal
What you do is what counts, not what you feel
And you ain't exactly quiet and shy
And some people think you get way too high

But it's your life you're living
It's all clear to me now
It's alright to be living, living out loud

When you're small nothing can hurt you at all
They can't criticize what you say
If you don't move they can't block your way
Hey, hey

And you can't always see through your mind
And sometimes you feel like your flying blind

But it's your life you're living
Don't let 'em put you down
It's alright to be living out loud

But it's your life you're living
It's all clear to me now
It's alright to be living, living out loud
