Emma was the lawman and I was the brave
We got in trouble, we'd never behave
And we'd run around all morning and rest in the shade
I remember where I stood telling Emma
we were best friends for good

We started school the inseparable pair
And I'd chase the boys who were pulling her hair
And she climbed up the tower accepting my dare
At the early age of eight I told Emma if she fell I'd be there

In time I would carry her books, that's when it began
I started to notice her looks and the sweat in my hand

Then there was a totally new game to play
We both gave our promise to never betray
And I was so sure we'd be married one day
At the early age of ten I loved Emma and I would 'til the end

One day she climbed up the tower, she kept looking down
The split-second lasted for hours 'til she lay on the ground

And right then I grew up in every way
I buried the child in me that day
But I guess not completely or I wouldn't say
that part of me believes that sweet Emma will come back someday
Yeah a part of me believes that sweet Emma will come back someday
