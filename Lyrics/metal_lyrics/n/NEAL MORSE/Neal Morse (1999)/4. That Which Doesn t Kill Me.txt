I once had the luck of a four-leaf clover
I once was a king with a golden crown
But you couldn't climb up without tryin' to kick me down
For the longest time I had no idea
For three long years I had no clue
But I can trace all my misery back to you

Everytime I felt like Steve Segal
you made me feel three feet small

That which doesn't kill me makes you stronger
That which doesn't kill me, man it makes you feel so good
When I'm down and hurting you only wish it would last longer
'Cause that which doesn't kill me makes you stronger

You wanted to fly but the sky was crowded
You wanted to swim but you needed a wave
You wanted to dance so you danced on my ego's grave
There's room in this world for a billion people
There's room in this house for a mom and dad
But there ain't room in your heart for no one to feel bad

'Cause when I go up, you go down
And when I go down, you look so very proud of yourself

That which doesn't kill me makes you stronger
That which doesn't kill me, Lord it makes you feel so good
When I'm down and hurting you only wish it would last longer
'Cause that which doesn't kill me makes you stronger

I think that I just figured out
you're a downer

That which doesn't kill me makes you stronger
That which doesn't kill me, man it makes you feel so good
When I'm down and hurting you only wish it would last longer
'Cause that which doesn't kill me makes you stronger
It makes you stronger
Oh yeah
