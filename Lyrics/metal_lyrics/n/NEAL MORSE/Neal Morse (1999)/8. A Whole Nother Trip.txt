[a) "Bomb That Can't Explode"]

This used to be mine you know
Plenty of time and kindness overflowed
It was all right, then overnight
I was grown out of my happy home
Oh yeah
Transferred from school to school
Special enrollment, gifted programs suck
I was the one, the prodigal son who got stuck
My parents were out of luck

Give the human mind some extra time
Get a dark cloud down the road
Give a genius son nowhere to run
Get a bomb that can't explode
A bomb that can't explode

Out of the blue to black
One day my dad had a massive heart attack
It wasn't my fault
He ate too much salt all his life
He's survived by his charming wife
and son

Give the human mind some extra time
Get a dark cloud down the road
Give a genius son nowhere to run
Get a bomb that can't explode
A bomb that can't explode

Give the human mind some extra time
Get a dark cloud down the road
Give a genius son nowhere to run
Get a bomb that can't explode
A bomb that can't explode

Now that you're out on your own
Will you make it your own way home
Now you can stand on two feet
Will you give up the dreams you've known
But will you wake up one day to find that you're alone

[b) Mr. Upside Down ]

I got freedom, I got everything
I got ten telephones that will not ring
but there mine now
Yeah, their mine
You can serve me but you better be quick
Serve me well and I'll do my trick
And I'm on now
Yeah, I'm on

I'm hot or cold, I'm sky or ground
Call me Mr. Upside Down
Mr. Upside Down
Mr. Upside Down

I am funky, I'm a funky man
Got the world by the second hand
and I'm down now
Yeah, I'm down

Bring it on in sense of round
Call me Mr. Upside Down
Mr. Upside Down

Say goodbye to Mr. Upside Down
Mr. Upside Down
Mr. Upside Down
Mr. Upside Down

[c) The Man Who Would Be King]

I am a stranger in a desert land
Wound up with nothing and I need a hand tonight
Can't you see where I'm going
A puppet on a string
Can't you see who I am
The man who would be king

I've got the talent, got the people skills
I'm in the moment but the thing that kills me now
No one sees were I'm going
No one sees a thing
No one knows who I am
The man who would be king
The man who would be king

I am a stranger in a desert land
A paraplegic looking for a hand tonight
No one knows were I'm goin'
No one knows a thing
No one sees who I am
The man who would be king
The man who would be king

[d) It's Alright]

Come on summer, you're wasting your time
Don't be gone
Come on winter get back in the line
and bring the sun

Keep it comin'
It's all right to be warm
It's all right to be strange
It's okay just to be here
It's all right
It's all right to be sad
It's all right to be wrong
It's okay to feel small
It's all right

Come on maybe you should change your mind
and be seen
Falling forward or lagging behind
or in between

Be yourself, man
It's all right to be strong
It's all right to be loved
It's okay to belong here
It's all right
It's all right to let go
It's all right to hold on
It's okay just to be here
It's all right

(What was all the madness about
We live from the beginning 'til our time runs out
It really doesn't matter 'cause it all works out in the end)

It's all right to be great
It's all right to fall down
It's okay to be living
It's all right

(What was all the struggle about
We end from the beginning 'til our time runs out
It really doesn't matter 'cause it all works out in the end)

It's all right to be warm
It's all right to be cold
It's okay just to be here
It's all right

What was all the madness about
We end from the beginning 'til our time runs out
It really doesn't matter 'cause it all works out in the end

What was all the struggle about
We end from the beginning 'til our time runs out
It really doesn't matter 'cause it all works out

What was all the suffering about
We live from the beginning 'til our time runs out
It really doesn't matter 'cause it all works out in the end
