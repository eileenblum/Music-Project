A bridge that can span a hundred miles
can break without warning
You can put on your face, you can put on your smiles
The strain is still showing
You worked yourself sane right to the bone
and came up with nothing
But the thing you need most is about to be
Hold on it's coming now
Yeah

All of your life you've been waiting
for someone to touch you inside
With life passing by you were one rock shy of a landslide
You're on the brink of becoming
Strap in, get ready to ride
You don't have to try, you're just one rock shy of a landslide

If there is a word you've always said
it would have to be never
You thought you were through, you thought you were dead
The movie was over
There was nothing to do but wait 'til the end
Man bring on the credits
But a wild wind blew you right on the screen
or it will if you'd let it
Yeah

All of your life you've been waiting
for someone to touch you inside
With your life passing by you're just one rock shy of a landslide
You're on the brink of becoming
Strap in, get ready to ride
You're like blue to the sky
You're one rock shy of a landslide

All of your life you've been waiting
for someone to touch you inside
With your life passing by you were one rock shy of a landslide
You're on the brink of becoming
Strap in, get ready to ride
You're like blue to the sky
You're one rock shy of a landslide
Shy of a landslide
One rock shy of a landslide
