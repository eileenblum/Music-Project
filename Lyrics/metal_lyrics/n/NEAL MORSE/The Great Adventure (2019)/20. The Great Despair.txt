We were flying to the distance
But somehow we lost our way
And the master of indifference
Caught us blind and unaware
Now here comes the great despair
The great despair

How can you speak
About deliverance
When we're trapped
In Hell without a key?
And all those words they told us
Are still lyin' in the air
Here comes the great despair
The great despair

I've been wrapped in chains
My dreams gone up in flames

And you don't even care
Here comes the great despair

In the land of milk and excess
We were flyin' up in the air
But we crashed into this fortress
And now we're broken beyond repair
Here comes the great despair

Here comes the great despair
The great despair
Here comes the great despair
Here comes the great despair
