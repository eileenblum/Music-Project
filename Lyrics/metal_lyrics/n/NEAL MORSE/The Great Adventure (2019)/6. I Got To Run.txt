Did you hear what the
Bubble head said today?
Truth is dead they say
It's relative to our imagination
Chronicles of greed
Extends the price that we pay
Innocence, it relents, and Percocet
Prevents the pain alright!

Father where are
You in all this mess?
Your memory suggests
But it's fading into
Non-substantiation
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Don't gimme-no
Gimme-no, gimme-no
Walk away, you can stay,
You can stay, you can stay

But I got to run
I got to find what's waiting there
I got to find my place under the sun
I got to run

'Cause, man, this place is killing me
And if I stay
Who knows what I'll become
I've got to run

Watch the money men
Feed their need
As their heroes blast

On the daily feed
Mr. Normal reeks of death
As he tries to remember to forget
Let's do lunch as we separate
As they twist and they turn
They're twisting our fate, now
I don't know why I hesitate
Before it's too late

I got to run
I got to find what's waiting there
I got to find my place under the sun
I got to run
'Cause, man, this place is killing me
And if I stay
Who knows what
I'll become
I've got to run

The clock is ticking and it's tick tock
Ticking every moment going by
And every second that passes
Is one more reason why

You may not get it but I know I'll
Regret it if I let you hold me here
And I won't take fear within me to
The other side

I got to run
I got to find what's waiting there
I got to find my place under the sun
I got to run
'Cause, man, this place is killing me
And if I stay
Who knows what I'll become

I've got to run
Tell me quickly while I'm young
I got to find my place under the sun
I got to run

Will you tell me
What this life's meant to be
'Cause all I see
Is sadness waiting for me
There's nothing I hear
But this dark melody

The silence speaks and so belongs
Every whisper in the wind
There's a world beyond our sight
Seek the summit here below
As your heart is reaching on
For a love that never dies
That never dies
