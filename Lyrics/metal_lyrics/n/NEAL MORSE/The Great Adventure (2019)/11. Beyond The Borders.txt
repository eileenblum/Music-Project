So they walked along the way
The dream continued on
As they sought the riverside
Searching for the one to come
The path will light the way
To a love that never dies

And all along
When no one knew
A leading love, an overview
The tallest stance
The deepest mind
A place my heart still longs to find

And we go on
Side by side
Beyond the borders that divide
To the river's edge
The ocean side
To seek a love that never dies
To seek a love that never dies
