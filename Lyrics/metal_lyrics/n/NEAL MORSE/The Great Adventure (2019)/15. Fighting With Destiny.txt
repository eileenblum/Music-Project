This way is dangerous
This ain't no diamond lane
Ain't no sofa school
Got no shoulder

There is the mount of pain
There is the cliff of lust
And in between there's shame
Like a boulder

You're fighting with destiny
You never heard the call
You'll never make the grade
You'll just get colder, colder, colder

I'm on the razor's edge
Next to the mouth of Hell
As I dose my eyes
To refocus

You're fighting with destiny
You never heard the call
You'll never make the grade
You'll just get older

God has forgotten you
If He exists at all
There's no brighter day
It just gets colder, colder, colder
Colder, colder, colder, colder!

In memory of every brother
No one knows your name
You will die like all the others
And you're the ones to blame

You're fighting with destiny
You never heard the call
You'll never make the grade
You'll just get older

God has forgotten you
If He exists at all
There's no brighter day
It just gets colder, colder, colder
Colder, colder, colder, colder

In memory of every brother
No one knows your name
You will die like all the others
And you're the ones to blame

You'd best get back into derision
Loneliness and pain
Hate your father, it s your decision
Seek to seal the stain
