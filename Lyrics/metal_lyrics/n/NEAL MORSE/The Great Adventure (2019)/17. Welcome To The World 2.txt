So you've come here
To shake the cage
To twist our times,
To change our ways
We like entertainment
And stuff we can't use
We like our death
With the evening news

And we can tell
That you're not like we are

Welcome to the world
Where the struggle is real
And you know how it feels
To beg, plead or borrow
Welcome to the world
Where dreams come to die
And the innocent cry
'Cause there ain't no tomorrow

Do you feel lucky?

Well, do you, punk?

You better get used to this sorry junk
Behind closed doors we'll decide your fate

Take you down with a smiling face

And no one knows
That we're not who we are

Welcome to the world
Where the struggle is real
And you know how it feels
To beg, plead or borrow
Welcome to the world
Where dreams come to die
And the innocent cry
'Cause there ain't no tomorrow

All the voices made their choices
Trapped in all they see
When all we did was try to live the
Best way we could be
Reaching out but still some doubt
And darkness were still here
As we dissent, it did not relent
The element of fear
The element of fear
