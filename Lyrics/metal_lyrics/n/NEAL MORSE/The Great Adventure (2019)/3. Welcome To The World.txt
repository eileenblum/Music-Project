Hello, I'm the abandoned son
I turned my back on everyone
Retreating deep
Into my wandering mind
My father left and went his way
Religion went on holiday
And nothings really necessary
Where broken lives are ordinary
When I complain
I hear the people say

Welcome to the world
Welcome to the world
Welcome to the world

Welcome to the world
Where the struggle is real
And you know how it feels
To beg, plead or borrow
Welcome to the world
Where dreams come to die
And the innocent cry
Cause there ain't no tomorrow
Welcome to, welcome to,
Welcome to the world

I work each day just like the last
Taciturn, iconoclast

I got more big words
That you don't know
Always a sarcastic ring
You're never sure just what I mean
I dwell within destruction city
A town that has no tears or pity
I can almost hear the minions
As they sing

Welcome to the world
Welcome to the world
Welcome to the world

Welcome to the world
Where the struggle is real
And you know how it feels
To beg, plead or borrow
Welcome to the world
Where dreams come to die
And the innocent cry
Cause there ain't no tomorrow
Welcome to, welcome to,
Welcome to the world

Welcome to the world
Where the talk is cheap
And the tab is steep
And the lies are spoken
Welcome to the world
A collective disguise

And the wolf cries at your door
Welcome to the world
Where you only have friends
If you're means to an end and it's
Always unspoken welcome to the
World where twinklin' eyes
Will despise you at your core

Welcome to the world that's always
Wanting more, more, more!
Welcome to the world
Where the struggle is real
And you know how it feels
To beg, plead or borrow
Welcome to the world
Where dreams come to die
And the innocent cry
Cause there ain't no tomorrow
Welcome to, welcome to,
Welcome to the world
