I've been in the brown
Shutting systems down
Building up the borders all around
Digging in the dirt, older than my shirt
Dwelling in a world of loss and hurt

But somethings cutting me
Like a guillotine
Severing my whole identity
And it won't let me rest
Am I haunted? Am I blessed?
My spirit and my soul dividing

Will you tell me what this life's meant to be
'Cause I've been living inside this dark melody

The spirit and the seed
Divided by their need
And father should be first in line to bleed
And I don't understand
I lived to hate the man
And I've takin' all that I can stand

But there within my heart
When love was the spark
I loved him long before he broke my heart
Father tell me how
What should I do now?
My spirit and my soul are crying

Will you tell me what this life's meant to be
'Cause I've been broken inside this dark melody
