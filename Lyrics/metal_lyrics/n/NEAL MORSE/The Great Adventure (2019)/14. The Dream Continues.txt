As the dream continued
They forged their way ahead
Walking without
Worry in the valley of the dead
With clouds of confusion hanging over
The two were led
With nothing said...

No, the dream isn't over, it goes on
And sometimes
It gets hard to carry on
No, the dream isn't over
When it seems
Like you'll get on

So the road has a ditch on either side
One called Depression,
One called Pride
And our friends are treading lightly
Where the blind have led the blind
