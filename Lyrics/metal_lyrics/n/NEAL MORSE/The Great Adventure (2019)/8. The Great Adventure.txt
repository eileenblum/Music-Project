I'm headed out to who knows where
My path is treading lightly
I can see the city standing there
The morning clouds behind me

And where I go I will be found
As the valley mystifies
And the world turns on inside

I'm going for the simple way
Like Huck and old Tom Sawyer
I'm seeking for the light of day
The path of the peaceful warrior

The sky is red under the sun
As the earth begins to rise
Like a love that never dies

It's the great adventure of my life and
I feel the motion everywhere
It's the great adventure of my life and
There's revolution in the air
I am striving for a better life and
I feel like I can make it here
It's the great adventure of my life and
Anything can happen here

I leave behind my apprenticeship
A fancy word for nothin'
I was an intern for the mother ship
A flunky for destruction

I'm on the path my father trod
And the answer to me lies
Maybe somewhere in his eyes

It's the great adventure of my life and
I feel the motion everywhere
It's the great adventure of my life and
There's revolution in the air
I am striving for a better life and I
Feel like I can make it here
It's the great adventure of my life
And anything can happen here

All the voices made their choices
Trapped in all they see
The lunatics and politics
All binding up in me
Breaking out I'm leaving doubt and
Darkness far behind
Pushing through to something new
That's glowing in my mind
Glowing in my mind

It's the great adventure of my life
And I feel the motion everywhere
It s the great adventure of my lite and
There's revolution in the air
It s the great adventure of my life
It's the great adventure of my life
And anything can happen here
