As the winter seeks the sun
And the mountains kiss the dusk
To a brand new day
My father left me on the run
But the Lord will lift me up
I'll be on my way

Welcome to the world
Where souls come to fly
And there is no goodbye
'Cause there ain't no tomorrow
Welcome to the world
Where the illusion is real
Let life you can feel
Wash away all our sorrow

Welcome to the world
Where souls come to fly
And there is no goodbye
'Cause there ain't no tomorrow
Welcome to the world
Where the illusion is real
Let life you can feel
Wash away all our sorrow
But for now you must go!

To the river I am going
With my sadness and despair
All my questions I bring with me
I hope to find the answers there
