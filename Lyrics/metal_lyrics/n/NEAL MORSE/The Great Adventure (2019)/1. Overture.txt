To be the completed man
To love and to understand
To change everything I can
It now makes sense to me

To be who I could not be
To love you so easily
With your life inside of me
May the great adventure now begin

And, oh, through the flood and through the fire
And, oh, though the storm is on the rise
And, oh, through the pain of our desire
Comes a love that never dies
