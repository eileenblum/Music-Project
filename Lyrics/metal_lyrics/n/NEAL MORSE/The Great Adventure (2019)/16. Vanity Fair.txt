Cardboard people, cardboard people
Cardboard people, cardboard people
Cardboard people, cardboard people
Cardboard people,
Cardboard people...

Walking down an open lane
People passing by
Wearing hats with famous names
Written on the side
Their sideways glances say that
There's something
Very wrong with us

Their fancy's very fanciful
They're different but the same
There's something vaguely comical
Such pride devoid of shame
They strut the day fantastic
And everyone is driven by their lust

What's in at the fashion show?
There's only one way to know
Come on, let's go

Let's go to vanity fair
Where the jacks and the queens
And the jokers run
Let's go to vanity fair
Where they've got everything
That's under the sun

Everybody must be cool
Or you will be ignored
Or maybe worse you'll go to school
The trashcan your reward
You better figure out a way
To be a have and not a have not

What's in at the fashion show?
There's only one way to know
Come on, let's go

Let's go to vanity fair
Where the jacks and the queens
And the jokers run
Let's go to vanity fair
Where they've got everything
That's under the sun

Excuse me, sir.
Perhaps you could find
A proper proprietor to put some pizzas
Back in your pentacle pantry

My pentacle pantry?
My pentacle what!?

Come on, let's go

Let's go to vanity fair
Where the jacks and the queens
And the jokers run
Let's go to vanity fair
Where they've got everything
That's under the sun

Let's go to vanity fair
Where the jacks and the queens
And the jokers run
Let's go to vanity fair
Where they've got everything
That's under the sun
