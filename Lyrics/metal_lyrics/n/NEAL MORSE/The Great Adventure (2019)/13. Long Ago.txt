Long ago and far away
I lived to dream another day
And made it out from where all doubts arise
We walked and then began to sing
A song that crane from everything
From every mile of every mountainside

And all at once I know it's true
That somehow I've got to get to you
The misty mountain
It testifies
And sings of love that never dies
And sings of love that never dies

You are now my trusted friend
We survived to live again
I'd not be here if not for you, I know

And all at once I see the door
And I know what my life is for
Through the lonely desert
And the highest highs
To seek a love that never dies
To seek a love that never dies
