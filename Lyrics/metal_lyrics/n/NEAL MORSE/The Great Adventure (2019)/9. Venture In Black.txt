It's getting darker now
The evening light will not allow
Summer wind, growing cold
I'm passing by Despondent's Slough
And I hear the warning cries
The midnight sun it mystifies

Moving on, adjust my pack
Take a look at turning back
Dip a foot into the slough
There's no way I would trust it now
What is that just up ahead
A figure looms like the walking dead

I am nothing more than a friend
You're nearing the end
You should listen to me
Who told you you should venture in black?
You'll never get back
You should listen to me

You, my son, are laughable
Do you think you're untouchable? Your father was a sad one too
He never made it back to you
I am now your trusted friend
Don't go where your father s been

I am nothing more than a friend
You're nearing the end
You should listen to me
Forget about this calling you've got
It's all in your head
You should listen to me

I am nothing more than a friend
You're nearing the end
You should listen to me
Who told you
You should venture in black?
You'll never get back
You should listen to me

I'd turn back if
I were you
'Cause you're all alone now
And nobody loves you
It doesn't matter what you do
It's a dangerous world
And nobody loves you
The summer's melting in the dew
You'd better go home now
You know that you want to
'Cause I'd turn back if I were you

So the young man in a hurry
Discouraged in his mind
Sometimes it's easy
Our vision leaves us blind
Just a few thoughts of negativity
Leave us resigned
Then I watched another traveler
Come upon the scene
He said his name was Faithful
He'd seen him in a dream
He told him
"Let's get out of here now"
And they split the scene
They went on with the dream...
Yeah!
