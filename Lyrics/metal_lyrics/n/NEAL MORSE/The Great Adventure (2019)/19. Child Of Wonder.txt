So the dreamer, undercover
Lives inside a memory
The true believer, once discovered
Fled from his true destiny

Child of wonder
The world is in your hands
But you're a flower
That's buried in the sand

The eldest son
Of our great wanderer
With his friend of low degree
They wouldn't serve
The mighty dollar
They're entering
Their guilty plea

Child of wonder
The world is in your hand
But you're a flower
That's buried in the sand

Child of wonder
The world is in your hand
But you're a flower
That's buried in the sand
