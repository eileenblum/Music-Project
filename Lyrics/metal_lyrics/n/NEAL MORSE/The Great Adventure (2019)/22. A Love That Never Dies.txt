As the morning seeks the sun
In the whisper of my life
As the haze lifts from my eyes
Standing now at river's edge
As my heart begins to run
To a love that never dies

And, oh, through the flood and through the fire
And, oh, through the tears of our goodbyes
And, oh, like the wind upon the water
Comes a love that never dies

So it comes that I must go
And leave this world behind
And I will see my father's eyes
'Cause now I know that he was right
We must find our own way
And we will meet on the other side

And, oh, through the flood and through the fire
And, oh, through the tears of our goodbyes
And, oh, like the wind upon the water
Comes a love that never dies

To the river I am going
Corning cross the great divide
Mourn not for me for I am entering
To a love that never dies

Come on!
You can find a place that's higher
Come on!
Though the storms are on the rise
Come on!
Seek your hearts deepest desire
For a love that never dies

Come on!
We can make it through together Come on!
As the dawn begins to rise
Come on!
We can pass into forever
With a love that never dies

To the river I am going
Corning cross the great divide
Mourn not for me for I am entering
To a love that never dies

I am going to the river
With a love that never dies

There's a love that never dies
