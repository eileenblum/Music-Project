Farther down the young man fell
So lost within his heart
Such a coldness in his eyes
Then I watched another come
And speak within his heart
Of a love that never dies

On and on the dream was cast
As hope began that night
As he wept and apologized
For what, he did not know
But deep inside his soul
He was sorry...
