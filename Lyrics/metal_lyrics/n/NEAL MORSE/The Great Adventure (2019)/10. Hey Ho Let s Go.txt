Hey ho let's go
Anything's possible now
Hey ho let's go
We're unstoppable now

Two is more than one
I can feel it already
Rid of the slough and the storm
The fourth stage over come
I'm ready to face the dawn

Hey ho let's go
Anything's possible now
Hey ho let's go
You can't look back from the plow

Now that we are out of the
Snare of derision
I thought we were close to the end
Maybe we are better together
Come on my friend!

Hey ho let's go
Anything's possible now
Hey ho let's go
We're unstoppable now

Don't try to lay no boogie woogie
On the kings of rock and roll
