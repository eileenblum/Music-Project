Two weeks after I got home I heard the news
Metal Blade sent a deal that we could not refuse
God had showed his hand but now I had to choose

Singin' thank you all for helping me
But home is where I'd rather be
What's down the road I can't see
But I've got another destiny to choose
No more road dog blues
No more road dog blues

So I quit my traveling with the Burdon band
My wife and I put the house and car in better hands
And we set out not knowin' if we'd sink or stand

Singing' thank you Lord for helping me
'Cause home is where I'd rather be
What's down the road I can't see
But I've got another destiny to choose
No more road dog blues
No more road dog blues
I'm coming home!
No more road dog blues
