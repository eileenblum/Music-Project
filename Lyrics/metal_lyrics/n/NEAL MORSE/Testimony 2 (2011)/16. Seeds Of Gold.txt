Sowing in the fields of gray and far from home
In a place of no return
Feeling like you might be in a danger zone
Before the fire starts to burn

Look away - to a place where this war is worlds away
When it's all about you and it's not about me
To a place where you know you'll be OK
And it's all about you and you get it for free
And I have my whole life in front of me

As the world keeps moving on it's time to change
Bring the changes to the front
Maybe this is only in my mind today
But I can change it if i want

Look away - to a place where this war is worlds away
When it's all about you and it's not about me
In a place where you'll always want to stay
When it's all about you and you get it for free
And I have my whole life in front of me

There's a place for me in the city of light if I'm found there
There's a chance to be and I think that I might understand there
There's a place for me in the city of light if I'm found there
There's a chance to be and I think that I might understand there

Run, baby, run, chase the dragons once more
Have fun in the sun, scrape for a little bit more
They can love you to death
But one thing's for sure
I'll still love you more

Go, baby, go, come on and work it on out
'Cause it's all just a show, that's what life's all about
You can grind down the wheel 'til you can't feel no more
But I'll still love you more
I'll still love you more

Take, baby, take, 'til there's nothin' to give
Life on the make, sure ain't no way to live
You can run 'til you drop, burn down every door
But I'll still love you more
I'll still love you more

This is the day all your life you've looked forward
To when you'd get lucky; take life for a ride
But now that it's here it's the great disappointment
You find yourself empty and lonely inside
Like the spark that was in you was lost and quietly died

But there's a homecoming beyond the danger zone
Where you never feel alone
And tomorrow feels like home
Yes, there's a homecoming that they can't take away
Like a child gone far away
Come on home, it'll be OK

Tried tribulation at first it was nothing
Like nothing before you could turn back the tide
But now that you're older you're like the new husband
Who lifts up the veil from off of his bride
And finds she's not quite the young girl that he had in mind

But there's a homecoming beyond the danger zone
Where you never feel alone
And tomorrow feels like home
Yes, there's a homecoming when you'll admit you're wrong
When you're tired and you've lived too long
Come on home where you belong

There's a homecoming beyond the danger zone
Where you never feel alone
And tomorrow feels like home
Yes, there's a homecoming where there's no fear or pride
Your senses open wide
This home is on the inside

As the world keeps moving on it's time to change
And this change is from the heart
Sowing down the seeds of gold remove the chains
I think now's the time to start

Look away - to a place where this war is worlds away
When it's all about you and it's not about me
To a place where you know you'll be OK
And it's all about you and you get it for free
And I have my whole life in front of me

Look away - to a place where this war is worlds away
When it's all about you and it's not about me
To a place where you'll always want to stay
When it's all about you and you get it for free
And I have my whole life in front of me
