One day at the gathering 
When all the people prayed
I felt a warmth inside of me
Electric healing wave
Then I heard a voice within
That cut me like a knife
When I asked Him if it was for me
The full surrendered life

It's for you
I'll give you what this world 
Could never give
It's for you
This goes beyond the life
That you now live
Take my hand
Trade everything you are
For everything I am

There I stood upon the edge
Gazing at the gap
Once my feet had left the ledge
There was no turning back
I jumped in with both feet that day
I stepped in completely
And now all that I have to say
Is it isn't just for me...

It's for you
I'll give you what this world
Could never give
What I have
Goes far beyond the life
That you now live
Take my hand
Trade everything you are
For everything I am

The God of the whole universe
Sent his son to lift the curse
And live His holy life through me and you
The God of the whole universe
Sent his son to lift the curse
And live His holy life through me and you
What will you do?

It's for you
I'll give you what this world
Could never give
What I have
Goes far beyond the life
That you now live
Take my hand
Trade everything you are
For everything I am
