While I was playing rock n' roll
Wondering if His way was the way
Hey, hey, hey
He was breaking protocol
Moving me each step of the way...
Hey, hey, hey

He would say
Will you go this way?
Hey, hey, hey
Perhaps your time has come today
Time has come today

So, He kept reaching out to me
Though I never said I would go...
Ho, ho, ho
The God of the whole universe loved me
Though I was a bit slow, I don't know
Would you go?
Will you go this way?
Hey, hey, hey
Perhaps your time has come today
Time has come today
C'mon

Will you go this way?
Hey, hey, hey
Perhaps your time has come today
Time has come today
Maybe it's your time today
Time has come today
