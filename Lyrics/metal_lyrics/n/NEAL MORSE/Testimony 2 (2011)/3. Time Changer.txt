The time changer, tapping on my shoulder
Now is later, the past is just an epitaph
The time changer, warmer now it's colder
Highlight shader, take me back into the past

Time changer, Time changer
Change the time, Change the time
Time changer, Time changer
Change the time, Send the sign, Take my mind...

As the change came down
And the night began to fade
I was leaving town for the money to be made
Spock's was the new kid in town
Could I still make the grade?

I got the steady gig that I never really had
Playin' every week with the Burdon band (Eric's Burdon's band)
I got the house, the gig, and the fam, so strike up the band!

Time changer, Time changer
Change the time, Change the time

Busy with my writing and playing on the road
I'd take my wife to church if I ever was at home
Good luck you Christians, that's nice, but I gotta go

Spock's was taking off and we took what we could grab
The retrograde applause gave us more than we had planned
Just crank up the tron and I sang with all that I had
With all that I had!

Never were we so surprised
To seize the day from where we had come
Sun and moon both crystallized
It was better late
Our date with the sun

As we were going to who knows where
Up it was coming and all for the one!

Never were we so surprised
To seize the day from where we had come
Sun and moon both crystallized
It was better late
Our date with the sun

Time changer, Time changer
Change the time, Change the time
Time changer, Time changer
Change the time, Send the sign, Take my mind...
