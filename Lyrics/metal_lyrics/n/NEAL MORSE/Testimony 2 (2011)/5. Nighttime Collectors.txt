We were rockin', we were rockin'
We were rockin', we were rockin'
We were rockin', we were rockin'
rockin', rockin', rockin'

I was drunk when I heard about her healing
When the phone rang I fell out of bed
When I got the news it blew out a fuse in my head
I was out there all alone at three in the morning
At an east European hotel
We were rockin' the blues
Blowing out the tubes as we yelled

Oh yeah, oh yeah
The nighttime collectors were feeling no pain
Oh yeah, oh yeah
How could I know how soon this all would change?
Oh yeah

The first thing I said is "I don't believe it"
Then fear gripped my heart and held on
I'd rather just grieve than start to believe and be wrong
"Well, all I can tell you is what they told me"
My wife said and said it once more
Her heart looks alright
They've seen nothing like it before

Oh yeah, oh yeah
The nighttime collectors were feeling no pain
Oh yeah, oh yeah
How could I know how soon this all would change?
Oh yeah
