Crossing Over

And so the journey starts
Communion of our hearts
He led me to a place beside the water
And as our season grew
The time came when I knew
My path led from among my band of brothers

And I can't describe how hard it was
Or how much we loved each other...

But to go on with the summer
On with the tide
To go on I must surrender
The fullness of my life
And I'll love you forever
But I must say goodbye
To go on I must cross over
A voice says deep inside
Carry on
Carry on
Carry on
Carry on

And so he brought me to a life I never knew
He's leading me to the bridge across forever
He saved the saddest one
Who thought his life was done
He gave me a new heart just like my daughter
And he's blessed me more than I can tell
And now all that I desire...

Is to go on with the summer, on with the tide
To go on I must surrender
The fullness of my life
And I'll love you forever

But I must say goodbye
To go on I must cross over
A voice says deep inside
Carry on
Carry on
Carry on
Carry on

To go on with the summer
On with the tide
To go on I must surrender
Everything inside
To go on to forever
Where all tears are dried
When it comes to crossing over
I'll hear you deep inside
Say carry on (On to forever) (I am willing)
Carry on (On with the tide) (I am broken)
Carry on (On to forever) (I am willing)
Carry on (Where all tears are dried)
(I am broken)

Carry on to the heart of the sun

Mercy Street Reprise

Love knocked upon my door one day
In the midst of my suffering
How can a dream so far away
Become a blazing realityâ¦ YEAH!
In the house of the rising sun
Still the snow falls down on mercy street
We're awaiting to become one
But we LOVE
For now
As the snow falls
Down on mercy street
