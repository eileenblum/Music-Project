Love knocked upon my door one day
In the midst of my suffering
Lost at the core I turned away
When the illusion meant everything
As the winter of my dreams died down
I turned to hear a different sound

In the house of the rising sun
Still the snow falls down on mercy street
You can rest when the day is done
But you're long gone now
As the snow falls down on mercy street

Long, long ago I held on tight
Life was all about making it 
Then came the time of the cold dark night
Disappointment had taken it
I would not have my day in the sun
But at least I could have some fun!

In the house of the rising sun
Still the snow falls down on mercy street
You can rest when the day is done
But you're long gone now
As the snow falls down on mercy street

As the day goes down, slowly slipping now
There's a time of a brighter knowing
Inner places reach, trying hard to breach
There's so much that we cannot understand

In the house of the rising sun
Still the snow falls down on mercy street
You can rest when the day is done
But your're long gone now
As the snow falls down on mercy street
