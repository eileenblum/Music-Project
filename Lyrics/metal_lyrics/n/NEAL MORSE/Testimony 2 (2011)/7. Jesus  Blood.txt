Sometimes I'd come home
After playin' with the bands
I'd walk into the church
With my heart held in my hands
The Lord said "Welcome home"
I felt accepted and received
I walked the aisle alone
as the people all would sing...

And I know, yes I know
Jesus' blood can make the vilest sinner clean
And I know, yes I know
Jesus' blood can make the vilest sinner clean

For years I had no peace
Every day was filled with dread
I wished that I could sleep
And awake when I was dead
And so I prayed to God in the midst of all my shame
Take this wasted life and wash away my pain

And I know, yes I know
Jesus' blood can make the vilest sinner clean
And I know, yes I know
Jesus' blood can make the vilest sinner clean

And I know, yes I know
Jesus' blood can make the vilest sinner clean
And I know, yes I know
Jesus' blood can make the vilest sinner clean

And I know, yes I know
Jesus' blood can make the vilest sinner clean
