I wish that I could tell you I'd turned right then
And never looked back again
It took a little while to work things out
I had my life
I had my doubts

I'd rather stay in here with the pain I know
Then step into the outside chance of a lifetime
I'd rather stay in here with the pain I know
Then step into the outside chance of a lifetime

So I continued on in my opposite life
Church by day, bars by night
And as the time went on and I felt the change
More and more, but I felt strange

Cause I'd rather stay in here with the pain I know
Then step into the outside chance of a lifetime
I'd rather stay in here with the pain I know
Then step into the outside chance of a lifetime

Cause what if it's a trick I'm feeling
And I start leaning and he hangs me out to dry?
What if I just think he's steering
But I'm just hearing the voice of my evil mind?
Cause what if it's a trick I'm feeling
And I start leaning and he hangs me out to dry?
What if people think I'm crazy to turn 180 (degrees)
And give my entire life?
What'll people think?
What if it's a lie?
