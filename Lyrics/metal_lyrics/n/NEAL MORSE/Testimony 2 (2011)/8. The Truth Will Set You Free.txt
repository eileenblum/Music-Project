The storm before me stands upon the water
I've been sailing in my ship toward dry land
Wounded, scarred, and sad and disillusioned
And the world just said "too bad" and let me stained

But where is the rain?
Where is the rain?
Where is the rain that's supposed to wash away my pain?
Will I remain
Tied to this chain?
Still there's a song of freedom calling me again

Come on son you've been on the run
But the shore awaits you now
Set your heart on the highest part
And you'll make it there somehow
The sea you'll leave behind when all your fears have been released
And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free
You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free

Catapulting out towards the future
The desert wind blow hot upon the sand
At least in my own ship I have authority
I'll carve a future with my own bare hands

But where is the rain?
Where is the rain?
Where is the rain that's supposed to wash away my pain
Still He is here
Still He is here
Still there's a song of freedom calling me again

Come on son you've been on the run
But the shore awaits you know
Set your heart on the highest part
And you'll make it there somehow
The sea you'll leave behind
And I will give perfect peace
And you will know the truth,
And the truth will set you free 

I surrender all
I surrender all of to my love
The highest measure of my gain
I surrender all
Oh, I surrender all to you my love
Just stop this haunting in my brain, brain... hey!

Come on son you've been on the run
But the shore awaits you know
Set your heart on the highest part
And you'll make it there somehow
The sea you'll leave behind
And I will give you perfect peace
And you will know the truth,
And the truth will set you free
You will know the truth,
And the truth will set you free
