Out on the road for thirty days
With lightning in my head
My dream life had become a maze
Just about left me dead

Jesus, Jesus,
I don't wanna leave my family all alone
Jesus, Jesus,
The only way to make the rent is on the road
If You really are the King I've never known
Jesus bring me home

At the Day's Inn in Boston
I couldn't take it any more
As the clock flashed in the darkness
I got down on the floor

Crying Jesus, Jesus,
I don't wanna hurt my family any more
Jesus, oh Jesus,
Will You help me and get me off the road?
If You really are the King I've never known
Oh Jesus bring me home

It's all I can do to get up in the morning
And get through another day

Will the real God please stand up
There's so many people who say they know the way
But I want the truth, come back it up
I'm tired of living in a constant state of prayer
I don't care what they say
I really want to know the way
