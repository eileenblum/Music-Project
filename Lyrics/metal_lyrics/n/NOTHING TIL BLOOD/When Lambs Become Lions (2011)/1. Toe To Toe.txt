There's a voice crying out in the wilderness saying prepare, make your way straight. My God is coming-he's coming with the fire in his eyes and a sword in his hand. I won't let your lies get the best of me. I won't let your disbelief cloud my destiny. I will stand and fight. Despite what you think, I will gladly give my life. Eternity is at hand, you'll see when you stand before the King on your knees-begging "set me free, forgive me". I count all as lost. I'll never count the cost. When I'm chasing the cross, I'll lay my life down. Have mercy on me, show me your mercy. Cleanse me from iniquity. Show me your purity my God my King, ruler of everything. Rise and be seen through me. Restore to me the joys of life. Restore to me the joy of sacrifice. Restore in me the hope for salvation. Restore in me the faith in redemption. I won't let your poison strangle me. My King has revealed my destiny.
