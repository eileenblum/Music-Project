You stand against me with your complacency. My God will stand true-my God will end you. This war won't last forever-the darker the storm, the better the weather. When animosity hits the wind thats when we rise and let this war begin. Helmet and shield-sword in hand-we stand on truth, our foundations, the Lamb. We lay our lives on this bloody alter proclaiming the Christ, the reigning Father. Falling victim to no lie, we will stand strong without compromise. And every knee shall bow and every tongue confess-my God will stand true, He can renew you.
