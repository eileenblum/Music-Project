(Bleak and distorted, the vision slowly starts collapsing on itself. The Tree remaining the longest, before corroding and dissipating into nothingness.)

Bludgeoning screams
Of infected spirits
Searching for meaning
They make their way through the black

Corrupted intellect
Of tormented spirits
Twists the time and space
That governs this barren land

Rotting away
To nothingness
Only emptiness therein

Crawling
The maggots
Under your skin

Dark shapes are looming
Behind a funeral veil
Beyond the halls of Hypnos
Oblivion prevails

[Solo: Dan]

In the Halls of Judgment you were born
Feeding in the wastelands of this world forlorn

[Solo: Alex]

Stripped of the flesh
In angst-ridden swoon
Seas of molten chaos
The cycle will resume

Enter the cold room of death
An empty crevice in the depths
Step up to the edge of the abyss
Belching a sulphurous welcome home
Halls of Judgment
Burn my eyes
Halls of Judgment
Watch me bleed

Awaken from deep slumber
To find the path beyond the portals of the dead
You have slept for too long
The world has ended swiftlyâ¦

â¦or has it never been created?

No warmthâ¦no wombâ¦
No substanceâ¦no fleshâ¦
Spirits infested with disease
No painâ¦no lifeâ¦
No matterâ¦no meaningâ¦no endâ¦

Fetidâ¦raptureâ¦corrosionâ¦decayâ¦

Feel the burning angels scream in pain
Fireâ¦infernoâ¦the world is burning
Endless transmigration sought in vain

Fetidâ¦raptureâ¦corrosionâ¦decayâ¦
Choking on your blood
Dyingâ¦slowlyâ¦endlessâ¦agonyâ¦
Festering writhe in darkness

May the flesh do thy bidding
Soulless Ones!
