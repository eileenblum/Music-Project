(Only the Tree still looks the same. Although after a careful look, it seems as though it emanates a sickly green light. The faces on its bark are writhing convulsively, open mouths gaping silently in agonized or gleeful expressions. Pieces of the landscape are drifting away, like ashes crumbling under the wind and flying away, revealing a texture of stygian darkness underneath.)

Annihilation
Stench of death is lingering
In this dark and empty world

Persecution
Fill your lungs with void and breathe the pain

Crimson rivers turning black with the tears of the unfaithful
Festering venom thawing your insides and burning your mind

Spontaneous combustion of the mind â branded with the sign of hell
Feel the stench of burning thoughts â trapped inside this holding cell
A piercing light in this world of the blind â searching for the ancient spell
Bumbling idiots shuffling in the ruins â in rotting misery they dwell

Spirits â of the past â I will return to be alive
Waiting â in the shades â take my hand and lift the shroud
Haunting â empty graveyard vaults â hear the voices of the dead
Follow me â in spectral darkness â descend the stairs into the crypt

Darkened visions of painâ¦of painâ¦

Damnationâ¦total cremationâ¦

Horns of damnation are summoning us to the battlefield
Trampling the weak under our feet
Fragments of bones and corpses full of maggots rotting there
Filling the air with poison smell

Fetid presence of mental decay is in the air
As funeral pyres are burning bright
Breathe the poison and corrosion with your rotten lungs
As gods are falling from the skies

Cursed into existence â in this world of shit
Human remains â beneath our feet

Malediction â a self-fulfilling prophecy
Malediction â the rotten fruit of society

Summoned from deep slumber â in this eternal hell
Dreams of falling angels â still vivid in your mind

Malediction â the curse of an endless agony
Malediction â dark ritual of ecstasy

Silence fills the emptiness inside
Seeping every ripping thought
From deep inside your mind
Bloody hooks of self-deceit

Liquid darkness from beyond
Madness tearing at your soul
Writhing tentacles of blackened spheres
Nauseating presence fills the air

Hear the screaming of the gods
Final throes of agony unleashed
Pantheons of souls dethroned
In oblivion they will exist

Dark empty rooms, devoid of life
A godly presence, still lingering in the air
Dwell the halls of the forgotten
Dethroned by mankind and fallen to the ground

Fallen to the groundâ¦to the groundâ¦

[Solo: Alex]

Moldy statues guard the gates
Of a palace with so many names
As the decadence of this world below
Brought it to its solitary desolation

Solitary desolationâ¦

[Solo: Dan]

Enter the burial chamber
Ashes blowing in the wind
Burnt wings of fallen angels
Feathers scattered on the ground
The air is on fire with burning corpses
Scattering among the cinders
â¦and ashes of a world long-dead

Seas rise engulfing the land in their watery grave
The bark of the tree of life is black and burned

Damnationâ¦total cremationâ¦
