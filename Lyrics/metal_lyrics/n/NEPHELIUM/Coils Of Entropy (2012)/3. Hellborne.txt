(It now seems as though subtle changes are taking place in the landscape. It does not seem the season of summer anymore. But obviously autumn, thick coat of yellow leaves covering the ground. The sound in the distance continues but the voices now seem harsh and distorted, loosing their human aspect. The smell in the air has also become thick and pungent, like the stench of a funeral pyre. Grunts and tittering mixed with strange ululations fill the quickly darkening air. What used to sound like beautiful music, has turned into a grotesque piping that drones discordantly until it steals life form all the other sounds present to become a shrill crescendo.)

Dead eyes gazing into darkness
Swaying to the icy wind
We stand on the edge of the precipice
Awaiting for our turn

A long line of black specters
Moving in the murky gloom
Reaching for the jaws of the mad giant
Our new dawn will be coming soon

[Chorus:]
Hellborne
Dead will walk the earth

Observing the funeral procession
Upon his high and darkened throne
The angel of reincarnation
The master of the Nephilim

So soon weâll join our earthly brothers
In their ethereal brave new world
We are longing for their pleasure
Of tasting their heavenly flesh

Shapes are shifting through the darkness
Of this cold world of ice and sand
Where twisted metal frames and skeletons
Pollute the rotten noxious ground

With dry lungs full of maggots we try to breathe
Through caked blood
Growling through our raspy, muddy voices
Still smelling of the grave
Eternal state of putrid vapors
Oblivion our predicament
Until infernal phosphorescence awoke us
And sent us heeding to its call

We move towards the edge in silence
Beneath the scorched and blackened sky
Beyond the eerie glow at the horizon
Together we will tear down the wall

A world of flesh, so fresh and meaty
Behold our promised land
Weâll clean our throats and fill our veins with blood
Out of entropy we will arise again

[Solos: Dan â Alex â Dan â Alex]

Like pilgrims on our holy journey
We lurk through waste and festering decay
Propelled by bloody lust toward the living
Weâll rip your limbs and take your soul away

So when you hear us knocking
On your front door late at night
Donât keep your loved ones waiting
And donât reach out for the light

[Chorus]

Hellborneâ¦
