No trace of madness
What do you say?
No trace of madness
Fight another day!
Illuminates the way of your heart
Did he ever want from you to tear it all apart?
Don't understand what you said
Guide me into your head, take me away

Tell me of your belief
Hatred and murder
Show me what you believe in
Death is your god

A lesson learned, I know what you thought
You've lost your way, forgotten all you once were taught
Don't understand what you said
Guide me into your head, take me away

Tell me of your belief
Hatred and murder
Show me what you believe in
Death is your god

Tell me of your belief
Hatred and murder
Show me what you believe in
Death is your god
Tell me of your belief
Hatred and murder
Show me what you believe in
Death is your god
