There you stood on judgement day
Why did you choose this way?
Living so blinded, not able to see
Past your own selfish needs
No capable of empathy
Always so blinded, not able to feel
Your fiery flame is put out, now can that be?
Where did you make, make the wrong turn in life?
Time to break free of this demon inside

Crazy, crazy inside
Now pay for your deeds and get rid of the demon inside

Where do you get them all
Your sick ideas and sick beliefs
Aroused by desire of stealing a life
All the crimes you did in vain
What did you thing you'd gain
Tormenting victims so sweet and so young
Your fiery flame is put out, now can that be?
Where did you make, make the wrong turn in life?
Time to break free of this demon inside

Screaming voices inside
Telling you to do whatever they want to
Crazy, crazy inside
Now pay for your deeds and get rid of the demon inside

Screaming voices inside
Telling you to do whatever they want to
Crazy, crazy inside
Now pay for your deeds and get rid of the demon inside
