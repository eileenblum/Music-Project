Greed, fight the one beside you
See, the light that shines above you
Lie, and take a bit of someone
Feel, the pain you self bring on them
Can you see another day
Without whom you may betray
In a world so full of lies
I can see it in your eyes

Will you leave this place alone?
Was it worth it when you're gone?
In pieces you will rest
Waste your life on causing pain
In my world you're all insane

Deep, you've lost your way inside you
Trust, you think that we will trust you
Pain, it will come and stay here
Bleed, and I will laugh behind you
Can you see another day...

Will you leave this place alone?
Was it worth it when you're gone?
In pieces you will rest
Waste your life on causing pain
In my world you're all insane

Will you leave this place alone?
Was it worth it when you're gone?
In pieces you will rest
Waste your life on causing pain
In my world you're all insane

Will you leave this place alone?
Was it worth it when you're gone?
In pieces you will rest
Waste your life on causing pain
In my world you're all insane
