Destroyed again myself and my pain
Dreams and illusions in vain
I'm moving on, what we had is gone
But you will remember my name
I felt for you, my feelings were true
But still, enough is enough!
Now look inside, there's no place to hide
There's no turning back, there's no coming home
I used to believe but I couldn't foresee
There'll be no chance for you and me

I am done now, you are gone now
So many tears, but it's over my friend
You are buried, I am thru' now
But I will be haunting you until the end
Now we're apart but I'm still playing games with your heart

At night, in your dreams
What's his name? is it me
Or someone else that you see?
I'm having the time of my life, I'm just fine
But you will never be free
I used to believe but I couldn't foresee
There'll be no chance for you and me
Ain't got no soul left, you've torn it apart
You desecrated my heart!
You've told me your lies, I've seen your disguise
And I never close my eyes again

I am done now, you are gone now
So many tears, but it's over my friend
You are buried, I am thru' now
But I will be haunting you until the end
Now we're apart but I'm still playing games with your heart

I am done now, you are gone now
So many tears, but it's over my friend
You are buried, I am thru' now
But I will be haunting you until the end
Now we're apart but I'm still playing games with your heart
