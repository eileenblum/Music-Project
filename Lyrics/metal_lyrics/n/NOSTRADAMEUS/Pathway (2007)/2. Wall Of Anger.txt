It starts to clear, I'm getting near
Understanding for the past and things we've done
I can't go on, much further down this road
It eats me up until there's nothing left of me
I won't give in, I'm gonna win
The battle in my mind will disappear
I can't be mad for all the times we disagree
Now I think that I can see

The wall of anger grinding on my mind
Anger fills my soul
Wall of anger cheating me from seeing what's real
The anger makes me blind
Blind in my mind

Time s now, to let go
There's no meaning to be full of bitterness
Cause that's deceit to all of me
I'll try to put behind me things back from the past
At last my rage is gone, I did not give in
Now it's past history

The wall of anger grinding on my mind
Anger fills my soul
Wall of anger cheating me from seeing what's real
The anger makes me blind
Blind in my mind

I'm trapped in a cage
I'm going to waste
I don't want to be here no more
I'm leaving behind
The scars in my mind...

The wall of anger crushed down...
