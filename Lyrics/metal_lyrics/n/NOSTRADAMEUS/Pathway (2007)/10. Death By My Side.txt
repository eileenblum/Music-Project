I had a life, I had a dream
I had plans, I had expectations
So many things were there for me
Now the lie you made me believe in
Is like a nightmare, and it's real
Always here, never disappearing
Can't get it out, can't make things right
It's too late, I wish I could be here for you

With the death by my side
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
With the death by my side
I never thought it would make me feel this way

Now tell me what I'm in your eyes
Do you see just what I am seeing?
I'm not taken by surprise
When you say I mean nothing to you

With the death by my side
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
With the death by my side
I never thought it would make me feel this way
With the death...

So, this is how we say goodbye
You won't forget, you won't be one, you won't be free
You must learn how to tell a lie
If you want someone to believe it...

With the death by my side
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
With the death by my side
I never thought it would make me feel this way
With the death...
