I turn the page and close my eyes
Our fairytale is over now
Forever lost inside a dream
That won't come true again, it's gone

My heart is crying your name
The memories I have are slowly killing me inside
Am I the one to blame?
I'll die in your arms
You know, not only women bleed...

Well, I just don't know what to say
Beyond the horizon there's a better day
Where we could stay...
Forgive me my crime
The sleep embracing me one last time...

My heart is crying your name
The memories I have are slowly killing me inside
Am I the one to blame?
I'll die in your arms
You know, not only women bleed...

My heart is crying your name
The memories I have are slowly killing me inside
Am I the one to blame?
I'll die in your arms
You know, not only women bleed...
My heart is crying your name
The memories I have are slowly killing me inside
Am I the one to blame?
I'll die in your arms
You know, not only women bleed...
