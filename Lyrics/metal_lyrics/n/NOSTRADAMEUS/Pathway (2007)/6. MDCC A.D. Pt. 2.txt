Well back from the assignment, rich in the gift
Suitable for kings, everything is fulfilled: his spirit had success
The dearest of friends, his closest of family
Between bed and work desk shall find his dead...

One night it came, a blackened vision
It chilled his spine as he realized his doom
Deep in his ball it's now appearing
His eyes aflame, it's impossible to change
At the age of sixty-two
He was finally through

Don't you dare to desecrate me
Violate me, oh no!
If your' fate's sealed, do believe me
Vengeance shall strike

I chose my burial sight
It's here on my native home soil
In the walls of the Franciscan church
I state this public now
If you touch my corpse may god have mercy on your soul
Please let my soul have rest
It's for your own best

Don't you dare to desecrate me
Violate me, oh no!
If your' fate's sealed, do believe me
Vengeance shall strike

Imperial guards went through the small town
When they renovated the walls of the Franciscan church
One of the guards drank wine
From the skull he had found
He never should have done
The vision came true as he died where he stood
Desecration, in this case he paid with his blood
You shouldn't ignore his words
You're bound to be cursed

Don't you dare to desecrate me
Violate me, oh no!
If your' fate's sealed, do believe me
Vengeance shall strike

He who opens the grave when it has been found
And don't close it right away
Will meet evil that no one can prove
It had been better for him if he had been
A king from Bretagne or marseille
