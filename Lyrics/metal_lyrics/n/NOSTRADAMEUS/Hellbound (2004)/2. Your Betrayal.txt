You never cared for human rights
You always had a way to justify
Your crimes against humanity
But now the time has come fo ryou to see
That we have no intention ever to forgive...

[Chorus]
Your betrayal
No, we have no intention to forget
Your betrayal

The wars you start around the world
The truth about them will soon be heard
You're leaving children there to die
You twist our minds with lies and tell us why
But we have no intention ever to forgive...

[Chorus]
Your betrayal
No, we have no intention to forget
Your betrayal

So as your army marches on
United states or nations, who won?
When rules we had to keep us free
Were not for you but just for them and me
And we have no intention ever to forgive...

[Chorus]
Your betrayal
No, we have no intention to forget
Your betrayal
