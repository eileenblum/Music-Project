[Verse 1]
We all learn from the star,
We had love in our hearts,
Wrought from our father: Almighty God,

As long as you're faithful to him,
He will forgive every sin,
Believers(?) will make it to paradise,
That's what he will give to you,

[Bridge]
How can you believe what they say,
"Rule the world by these fairytales,"
Kill the ones who refuse to believe,
In the holy word,

[Chrous]
Deep, in my heart I'll never believe,
Just look at the world where they kill in the name of the lord,
I'm hellbound..
And there'll be no salvation for me!

[Verse 2]
They say it's important (?) now look,
I've been reading those books,
Meant for salvation for all mankind,

We know so much better today,
And we should just throw it away,
Make our own planet a better place,
For us to live!

[Bridge]
How can you believe what they say,
"Rule the world by these fairytales,"
Kill the ones who refuse to believe in the holy word,

[Chorus]
Deep, in my heart I'll never believe,
Just look at the world where they kill in the name of the lord,
I'm hellbound. [x2]

And there'll be no salvation for me!

[Verse 3]
You think you are so much better than me,
(?) (?) from what is rightful,
You had your plagues with (?) and sanctity,
They're same,
They're the same,

[Chrous]
Deep, in my heart I'll never believe,
Just look at the world where they kill in the name of the lord,
I'm hellbound..
And there'll be no salvation for me! [x3]
