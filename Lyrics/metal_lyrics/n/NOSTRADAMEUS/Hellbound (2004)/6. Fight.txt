You say that you live in the country of freedom
But don't even try to make me believe in
The stories they tell, to you childrenn in "hell"
Where moral, religion and racism they sell
They're claiming to be guardians of justice
Police of the world is what I would call it
With selftaken right to decide what is right
They're "blessing" the world with their truth every night

How do they make you believe what they say?
When are you going to open your eyes and...

FIGHT--to prevent them from ruining it all
FIGHT--for the right to be free, and tell me...
WHY--every leader obeys what they say
FIGHT--it's a duty to fight for our human rights

The rule of today is never to question
Obey what they say, that is your first lesson
If they tell you to die, then don't ask them why
Just do what you're told and say "thanks and goodbye"
How do they make you believe what they say?
How come you don't seem to care at all
Their hypocrisy is making me sick
When are you going to open your eyes and...

FIGHT--... how do they... FIGHT--...
