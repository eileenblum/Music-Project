The lies you keep telling me over and over
Will never destroy me or
Make me a pawn in the game you want to play
Misleading the masses, creating disasters
You rule by destroying, and still
You think I'll believe in what you say

[Chorus]
We only have one world to live in
How come we allow them to tear it apart?
We only have one world to live in
It's time now to learn how to make a new start

How can you look at yourself in the mirror
And say you are proud when
All you've achieved is pain and misery
Starvation, pollution and radioactive wastelands
Empty resources, we'll hold
You responsible when that time has come.

[Chorus]
We only have one world to live in
How come we allow them to tear it apart?
We only have one world to live in
It's time now to learn how to make a new start

[Chorus]
We only have one world to live in
How come we allow them to tear it apart?
We only have one world to live in
It's time now to learn how to make a new start
