Well, here I'm standing once again
With nowhere to go, and all my confidence is gone
I feel you're talking about us again
As if I didn't know, but still you hide behind my back
I've no respect left anymore
I thought I could trust you, but now
You've shown me who you are
You told me this, and you told me that
You're so full of shit, so much for honesty, but...

[Pre-chorus]
How do you like what the mirror reflects
How do you feel when you look at yourselves
How do you enjoy the time you have left
And how could you think I would forget?

[Chorus]
Seven
Seven--fucking years of my life
Seven
Seven

I hope it's worth the price you have paid
And what you've achieved for money, just like Judas
I guess you're sleeping well in your beds
Since you're just denying your treason

[Pre-chorus]
How do you like what the mirror reflects
How do you feel when you look at yourselves
How do you enjoy the time you have left
And how could you think I would forget?

[Chorus]
Seven
Seven--fucking years of my life
Seven
Seven

We won't be seeing each other no more
'Cause I've promised myself to stay away from all your shit
The kind of friendship you want to give to me
Is of the kind that I'll be just as fine without

[Pre-chorus]
How do you like what the mirror reflects
How do you feel when you look at yourselves
How do you enjoy the time you have left
And how could you think I would forget?

[Chorus]
Seven
Seven--fucking years of my life
Seven
Seven

[Chorus]
Seven
Seven--fucking years of my life
Seven
Seven
