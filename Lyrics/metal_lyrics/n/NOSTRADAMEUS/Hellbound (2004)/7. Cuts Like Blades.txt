Born out of hellfire, from a burning womb.
The poisoned mind of man, weakened in us all.

Manifest of rotten lies.
Satan's work? Who knows?

Right from the dawn of time
We have altered course.
From right to wrong, it's true,
There's no escape for you.

Now millions passed away for beliefs of a wicked man.

Sacrileged the human rights
With blinded eyes, too long!

[Chorus]
DIE--shoot me in my grave
The bullets cuts like blades
Armageddon has begun
DIE--shoot me in my grave
My will to live has gone
Armageddon has begun

And as I write these words,
I wonder what went wrong.
Something did, it's for sure,
'cause now it's goddamn war.

Manifest of rotten lies.
Satan's work? Who knows?

I had my part in this mocking of mankind.

Sacrileged the human rights
With blinded eyes, too long!

[Chorus]
DIE--shoot me in my grave
The bullets cuts like blades
Armageddon has begun
DIE--shoot me in my grave
My will to live has gone
Armageddon has begun
