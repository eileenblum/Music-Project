(Fade out of Hellbound)

[Verse 1a]
Since the day we were wrought,
We have lived as if [we] don't have no end,
Since that day we have sworn to enjoy all that life has to give, to us and our friends,

We never considered(?) the chance that we might not have all the time we thought from the start,

[Prebridge]
But now it's too late,
I can only regret what I said,
There won't be no second chance for me!

[Verse 1b]
Since the day we grew up,
We have learned all that there is to know,
We have reached for the top without thoughts (?) (?) that are still to come, for us and our friends,

Despite the intelligence we had from our right,
Never considered the fact that we'll die,

[Bridge]
But now it's too late,
I can only regret what I said,
There won't be no second chance for me,

[Chorus]
As long as you're able to give,
Never know just how long you will live,
'cause we're only one step away from doom,

Live your life as today was your end,
A chance for you to be free from the past,
'cause we're only one step away from doom,

[Verse 2]
If we knew just how much,
Time we had on the face of the earth,
How much would we change in the way that we'll live our lives,

How much would they mean; all the things that we do in the morning we make,
What is it worth?
What is it worth?!

[Bridge]
But now it's too late,
I can only regret what I said,
There won't be no second chance for me!

[Chorus]
As long as you're able to give,
Never know just how long you will live,
'cause we're only one step away from doom,

Live your life as today was your end,
A chance for you to be free from the past,
'cause we're only one step away from doom!

I didn't care too much before,
'til someone came and closed(?) the door,
Now it's too late for a change.

I should have told you long ago,
But now you've gone and I'm alone,
It's far too late for a change!

[Chorus]
As long as you're able to give,
Never know just how long you will live,
'cause we're only one step away from doom!
