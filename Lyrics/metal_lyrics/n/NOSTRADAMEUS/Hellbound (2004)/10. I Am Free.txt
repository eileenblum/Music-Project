Deep in my mind
You'll never find
No hesitation,
I know what I came for
You do not see
What the past still means to me
'Cause in my mind you just
Know me the way I was before

I used to be
Everything but me
I used to listen to people
Who told me what to do
I never thought
I'd reach the day
When I could face you
And say: "We are through"

[Chorus]
I am free, and I promise, you'll see
You'll see what I am
You'll see what I'll be
I am free, I will never turn back
Back to a day
When I wasn't me, I am free

So as we talk
I'll turn the page
I won't be standing alone,
I've got friends by my side
So turn your cheek
Towards me now
And let me give you a gift,
Like you gave me before

[Chorus]
I am free, and I promise, you'll see
You'll see what I am
You'll see what I'll be
I am free, I will never turn back
Back to a day
When I wasn't me, I am free

[Chorus]
I am free, and I promise, you'll see
You'll see what I am
You'll see what I'll be
I am free, I will never turn back
Back to a day
When I wasn't me, I am free
