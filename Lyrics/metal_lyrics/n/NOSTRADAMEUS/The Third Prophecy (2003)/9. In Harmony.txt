In rooms we cannot see
They hide from our eyes
Decide how it will be
And telling us their lies

We're drowned in their opinions
We get it every day
They carry out the mission
Saying 'This is the only way'

For how long will we carry on
To believe their goddamn lies
For how long will we stand and wait
For someone else to make our world a place

Where we can live in harmony
Where we can love instead of hate
We can live in harmony
If we just end this reign hate
It's not too late

They're sitting in their offices
In the scrapers of New York
Dictating our lives
And they watch your every step

Their sugar-sweet intentions
To make you people free
Were never meant to be fulfilled
How come that you don't see

For how long will we carry on
To believe their goddamn lies
For how long will we stand and wait
For someone else to make our world a place

Where we can live in harmony
Where we can love instead of hate
We can live in harmony
If we just end this reign hate
It's not too late

For how long will we carry on
To believe their goddamn lies
For how long will we stand and wait
For someone else to make our world a place

Where we can live in harmony
Where we can love instead of hate
We can live in harmony
If we just end this reign hate
Where we can live in harmony
Where we can love instead of hate
We can live in harmony
If we just end this reign hate
It's not too late
