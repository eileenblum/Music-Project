For many years they've waited now to go back home
Over the seas in ships of purest gold
For milleniums I have endured their purity
It's time to rise, their end is near

My darkened hand's too strong
You won't carry on
Soon I'll find the one
And then I've sealed your fate

My power's far too strong
With longboats that carry thousands
You're meant to sail
To the west, to the land of the gods
Your ancient home
I will enslave all you fools
The time has come
You'll never conquer my powers
You're just too weak
My power's far too strong

Now I'm alive in physic flesh of evil sin
Damn you fools if you think that you can win

My darkened hand's too strong
You won't carry on
Soon I'll find the one
And then I've sealed your fate

Plague - I'll bring your lands
Rape - Rape your beautiful daughters
Hate - You must grow strong
And then you all will be my slaves

Now high lord elves prepare to die in war of the rings
Pain, greed, death, hate is what will be

My darkened hand's too strong
You won't carry on
Soon I'll find the one
And then I've sealed your fate

My power's far too strong
With longboats that carry thousands
You're meant to sail
To the west, to the land of the gods
Your ancient home
I will enslave all you fools
The time has come
You'll never conquer my powers
You're just too weak
My power's far too strong

Plague - I'll bring your lands
Rape - Rape your beautiful daughters
Hate - You must grow strong
And then you all will be my slaves
Plague - I'll bring your lands
Rape - Rape your beautiful daughters
Hate - You must grow strong
And then you all will be my slaves
