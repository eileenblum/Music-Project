You were the one
To lead us on our path
To what would be a country for us all
You weren't on your knees
For leaders from west nor east
You got your own opinion and you told them so

So you became uncomfortable for them to who tried to rule our world
They conspired to make you disappear for all eternity

One - You had your ways
Nine - To make our world
Eight - A better place
Six - For us to live
Was when our fairytale came to an end
One - You had your ways
Nine - To make our world
Eight - A better place
Six - For us to live
Was when our fairytale came to an end

Your fine ideas
Of a decent life for all
Were not appreciated by those men
You were shot point blank
In an open street at night
They killed not only you but the truth itself

'Cause you were too uncomfortable for them to who tried to rule our world
They conspired to make you disappear for all eternity

One - You had your ways
Nine - To make our world
Eight - A better place
Six - For us to live
Was when our fairytale came to an end
One - You had your ways
Nine - To make our world
Eight - A better place
Six - For us to live
Was when our fairytale came to an end

'Cause you were too uncomfortable for them to who tried to rule our world
They conspired to make you disappear for all eternity

One - You had your ways
Nine - To make our world
Eight - A better place
Six - For us to live
Was when our fairytale came to an end
One - You had your ways
Nine - To make our world
Eight - A better place
Six - For us to live
Was when our fairytale came to an end
Was when our fairytale came to an end
