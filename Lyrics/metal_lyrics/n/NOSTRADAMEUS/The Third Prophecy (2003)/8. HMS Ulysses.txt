The siren is whining
It's time for clear ship again
The heart beat's pounding
Pumped with adreline
The crew's so tired and fed up
They want to go back home
Inhuman conditions
They can't put up for long

Goddamn war
That's simply what they're employed for

H.M.S. Ulysses, queen of the sea
Has begun her last journey
H.M.S. Ulysses, lucky ship
Fight, survive - Win the war for peace

Sent as a guardian
To watch the whole convoy
But will just be bait
To catch the enemy
Admiral Tirpitz
Is a dreaded foe
Hiding deep in a bay
On Norway's western shore

Goddamn war
That's simply what they're employed for

H.M.S. Ulysses, queen of the sea
Has begun her last journey
H.M.S. Ulysses, lucky ship
Fight, survive - Win the war for peace

Goddamn war
That's simply what they're employed for

H.M.S. Ulysses, queen of the sea
Has begun her last journey
H.M.S. Ulysses, lucky ship
Fight, survive - Win the war for peace
