You'll never ever notice what soon will be coming
Coming for you
I'll never forget 'bout what happened that day
Like always, you treated me like I was nothing
Nothing at all
I'll show you just what has become of me

You say you never meant to make me feel that way
But I know you did, but still I'm careful what I say

Revenge is mine
Even if you think that I have already lost
This battle and this war
Revenge is mine
The future won't be yours
And you do not even know when I'll come

You robbed me, took my heart and my soul and my body
You took everything
But I'm back now and I'm stronger than ever before

You say you never meant to make me feel that way
But I know you did, but still I'm careful what I say

Revenge is mine
Even if you think that I have already lost
This battle and this war
Revenge is mine
The future won't be yours
And you do not even know when I'll come

You say you never meant to make me feel that way
But I know you did, but still I'm careful what I say

Revenge is mine
Even if you think that I have already lost
This battle and this war
Revenge is mine
The future won't be yours
And you do not even know when I'll come
Revenge is mine
Even if you think that I have already lost
This battle and this war
Revenge is mine
The future won't be yours
And you do not even know when I'll come
