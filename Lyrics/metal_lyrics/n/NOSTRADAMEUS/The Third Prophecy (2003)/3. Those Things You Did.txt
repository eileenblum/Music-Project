It really doesn't matter what person you are
Does not even matter what goals you achieved
Positions or titles it don't matter to me
It's all 'bout promises, can't you see
As time passes by it reveals what is true
And even if I didn't matter to you
There's something I want you to know - We're not through
Beware, watch your back - I'll be coming for you

Time might heal all wounds 
But it will never make me lose my fate
'Bout what is true, it's nothing new
Just common sense, something
You never had, you played with me
And I will not forget
'Bout what you said, 'bout what you told me
No, I will not forgive
Those things you did - You broke your word to me

You took all my confidence, tore it apart
I thought it was the end but it's just the start
'Cause now I am back, I will show who I am
I'll shed no more tears over you nor your friends
You're simply not worth it, revenge will be sweet
I'll never forget your betrayal, you see
I'm cursing your name and I wish you the worst
You self-loving scum, how do you live with yourself

Time might heal all wounds 
But it will never make me lose my fate
'Bout what is true, it's nothing new
Just common sense, something
You never had, you played with me
And I will not forget
'Bout what you said, 'bout what you told me
No, I will not forgive
Those things you did - You broke your word to me

Time might heal all wounds 
But it will never make me lose my fate
'Bout what is true, it's nothing new
Just common sense, something
You never had, you played with me
And I will not forget
'Bout what you said, 'bout what you told me
No, I will not forgive
Those things you did - You broke your word to me
