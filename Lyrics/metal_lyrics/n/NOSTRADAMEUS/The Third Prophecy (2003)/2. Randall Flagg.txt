Centuries ago I came from below
Our name is legion - For many I am
Magical spawn from unholy womb
Flashing with red eyes I haunt in the night

Heart cold
Ice cold
Senseless
Eternally old

I have been a visionary
I have been the black man in your dreams
I gather the evil ones - Live in sin
I am evil, Satan's spawn
I'm a demon, I am all
Whisper my name silently - Randall Flagg

I've been 'Delain', I where there in vain
Goddamn you, young prince, I will avenge
In the west of the states, in America's heart
I ruled with joy, terrorized enslaved fools

Heart cold
Ice cold
Senseless
Eternally old

I have been a visionary
I have been the black man in your dreams
I gather the evil ones, live in sin
I am evil, Satan's spawn
I'm a demon, I am all
Whisper my name silently - Randall Flagg

Randall Flagg - Born in lust
Randall Flagg - Turns to dust
Randall Flagg - Born in sin
Randall Flagg - Come on in

I have been a visionary
I have been the black man in your dreams
I gather the evil ones, live in sin
I am evil, Satan's spawn
I'm a demon, I am all
Whisper my name silently - Randall Flagg
I have been a visionary
I have been the black man in your dreams
I gather the evil ones - Randall Flagg
I am evil, Satan's spawn
I'm a demon, I am all
Whisper my name silently - Randall Flagg
