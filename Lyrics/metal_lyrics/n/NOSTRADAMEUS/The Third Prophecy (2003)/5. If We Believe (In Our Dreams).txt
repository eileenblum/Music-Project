How hard can it be 
For all you good people who think one step ahead
How hard can it be 
To see that they're twisting the thoughts in your own head
That all you know
And all you believe in is nothing but a lie
'Cause all they do is 
Exploiting your body until the day you die

Since suffering and luxury
Are two sides of the same coin
There's one decision you must make
What's good and what is wrong

It's been the same through history
Alone we will fall but united we'll stand
We'll throw away all misery
If we believe in our dreams

They're poisoning your brain
Yeah, they do everyday, while you're standing peacefully
And get loaded with shit
With toughts they allow - We're like Zombies, you and me
Or is this what we want
All this pain and starvation for people in this world
That some people did die
'Cause of other men's greed - Is this the way it's supposed to be

Since suffering and luxury
Are two sides of the same coin
There's one decision you must make
What's good and what is wrong

It's been the same through history
Alone we will fall but united we'll stand
We'll throw away all misery
If we believe in our dreams

Since suffering and luxury
Are two sides of the same coin
There's one decision you must make
What's good and what is wrong

It's been the same through history
Alone we will fall but united we'll stand
We'll throw away all misery
If we believe in our dreams
