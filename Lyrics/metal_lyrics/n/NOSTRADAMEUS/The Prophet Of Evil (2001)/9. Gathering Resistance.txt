[Captain:]
Who is coming in the dark night, who is coming in the rain
I'm captain of the loyal forces, tell me now your name

[Prince:]
I'm your prince that has been false accused of murdering the King
Lay down your weapons, listen now,
I'm telling you a thing

I'm gathering resistance to fight the evil one
Who's out there in the distance
Before the chance is gone

So come, join me now
Let us fight against the evil of the world
Come, join me now
Let us fight, against what's wrong
You know the right way to go

[Captain:]
Why should we believe in you, your words might be a lie
Why risk the souls of all my men, may I ask you why?

[Prince:]
I'm here under the blessing of the prophet of all times
So take a look into my face, you'll see it in my eyes

I'm gathering...

So come...

[Solo Michael / Jake / Both]

So come...

So come...
