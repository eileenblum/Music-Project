[Narrator:]
In the royal court there was an evil man, telling prophecies
He was the advisor to the naive king who was poisoned with his lies
Ruler of (the) kingdom was really this man, making future plans
Infecting the king with his sweet sounding voice, but heart as cold as ice

Evil prophecies- Always fooling the king
Evil prophecies- Breething chaos and war
Evil prophecies- He invents them himself
Evil prophecies- To destroy the fine land in our hearts

[Hister:]
I am a wizard
I have thousand names, call me what you want
The people who think I'm a prophet of peace are calling me Hister
I will now agitate to anarchy, into civil war
To destroy the kingdom is my one great will, this will be for real
