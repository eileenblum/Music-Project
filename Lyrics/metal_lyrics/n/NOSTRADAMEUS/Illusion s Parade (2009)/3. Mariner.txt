Hey, sail away, sail away
On a golden sparkling sea
It'll cure your fear
Forget about what's real

Set sail and ride upon the wind
Set sail, forget about our sins
You were the rock for me back then
Beneath the waterline
The truth's in the sea

Feel the emotions and let them out
Stand up and shout!
Release the emotions
Just set them free

Feel the flame
Touching you
Life's but a stupid game
Feel no shame
Right here and right now
There'll be no tomorrow!

Burn it down, tear it apart!
For once in life we're not
Paying the price
Mariner, leaving the shore
Once it's done things won't be
Like before

Stand up with no fear in your eyes
Go where no one will
Hear your cries
It's time, get rid of your disguise
Right before my eyes
I see your lies

Feel the emotions and let them out
Stand up and shout!
Release the emotions
Just set them free

Nailing you
Leading your mind to
Where lies are true
Sailing free
In a place where you
Obviously cannot see

Burn it down, tear it apart!
For once in life we're not
Paying the price
Mariner, leaving the shore
Once it's done things won't be
Like before

Mariner - into the storm
No return - no coming home
Mariner - leaving behind
All your life - you've thrown your disguise
