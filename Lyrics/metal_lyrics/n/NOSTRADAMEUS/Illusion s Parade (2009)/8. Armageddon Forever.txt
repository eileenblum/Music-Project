So you think that you can ignore us?
And stop paying your debts in blood
How it used to rush
Through our veins
To satisfy our needs and our hunger

No longer keen to please us
By sacrifice your living souls
As you used to way back then

No blood?
No blood? - we're not pleased!
From crawl - to fall

End of all - embrace the darkness
End of all - the earth quakes far
Too hard to last
Curtain call - to the fifth universe
End of all - to the final world
Armageddon forever

Five times we've build up the space
Five times you've neglected our thirst
Now we tear it down
For the final time
'cause you're no longer keen
To please us
By sacrifice your living souls
As you used to
We want blood!!!

No blood?
No blood? - we're not pleased!
From crawl - to fall

End of all - embrace the darkness
End of all - the earth quakes far
Too hard to last
Curtain call - to the fifth universe
End of all - to the final world
Armageddon forever

End of all - embrace the darkness
End of all - the earth quakes far
Too hard to last
Curtain call - to the fifth universe
End of all - to the final world
Armageddon forever

End of all - embrace the darkness
End of all - the earth quakes far
Too hard to last
Curtain call - to the fifth universe
End of all - to the final world
Armageddon forever
