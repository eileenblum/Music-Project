Deep in my twisted mind
I'm of another kind
Into my own regrets
Seeing things I can't forget
Who made me what I am?
Who'll make me understand?
Thoughts of a mad man says:
"Oceans of endless hate"

Lost fate, standing alone
With my darkest hate
Seeing that I'm living a big fake
Broken and shattered, destruction
Reigns wherever I turn

Can't stand this pain no more
It's killing me for sure
Already lost this war
And I'm king of this nothing
No more break of dawn
Me and the night are one
All my hopes are gone
I'm just wasting my time

Lost things I can recall
Past lies destroyed them all
Fuck what it's meant to be
See what it's done to me
So filled with emptiness
Unable to progress
Caught in this endless wheel
Seek answers from the steel

Lost fate, standing alone
With my darkest hate
Seeing that I'm living a big fake
Broken and shattered, destruction
Reigns wherever I turn

Can't stand this pain no more
It's killing me for sure
Already lost this war
And I'm king of this nothing
No more break of dawn
Me and the night are one
All my hopes are gone
I'm just wasting my time

There's just no point in it
I don't believe a shit
Boiling inside my head
This world's already dead
Bring your hypocrisy
I won't be there to see
Save me and bring me home
Hey, sanatorium

Lost fate, standing alone
With my darkest hate
Seeing that I'm living a big fake
Broken and shattered, destruction
Reigns wherever I turn

Can't stand this pain no more
It's killing me for sure
Already lost this war
And I'm king of this nothing
No more break of dawn
Me and the night are one
All my hopes are gone
I'm just wasting my time
