Please let me be now
I can't take no more
I'm just a hollow shell
Can't fake no more

Now take a look at yourself
How does it feel to know
What you've been doing to me?

It's like you cast me for a leading role
In "hell's play", soon at stages close to home

And when the curtain withdraws
You'll be the one to fall
When I ignore your call

I feel cold
You drained my soul complete

Watch my face, raging eyes
Tell me no more lies
You've already been digging six
Feet down, deep down, in the ground
Tell me one more lie
And that's the place where
I shall bury you

Just quit right now cause I
Won't take no more
Please try and see but I
Won't break no more

Do you like what you see
When you look at me
Your works is incomplete

Weak no more
I'm stronger than before

Watch my face, raging eyes
Tell me no more lies
You've already been digging six
Feet down, deep down, in the ground
Tell me one more lie
And that's the place where
I shall bury you

Watch my face, raging eyes
Tell me no more lies
You've already been digging six
Feet down, deep down, in the ground
Tell me one more lie
And that's the place where
I shall bury you
