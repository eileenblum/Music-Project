Let's take a look inside
This nightmare haunts my mind
I will be left behind
How could I be so fucking blind?
Let's call it my mistake
My faith's not hard to break
I'm so hard locked up in chains
By this poison in my vein

The way you look at me
Come tell me, what do you see?
I must leave this prison cell
Of the poison in my veins

You better think once
You better think twice
You better think one extra time

Come take my hand and help me through!
Can't take it no more
Please tell me what I never knew
On this walk of pain

I'm such a slave to you
I've got you under my skin
You take control of me
And leave me with no
Chance to be free
Seducing, deceiving
And still you wonder
Why I'm leaving?
I'm dying, I'm freezing
I can always hear you tease me

You better think once
You better think twice
You better think one extra time

Come take my hand and help me through!
Can't take it no more
Please tell me what I never knew
On this walk of pain

Come give me what you got
Come give me your best shot
I'm just human, so are you
And I need your help to get through
I'll take one day each day
And watch you as you walk away
Empty cases, empty chains
No more poison in my veins

You better think once
You better think twice
You better think one extra time

Come take my hand and help me through!
Can't take it no more
Please tell me what I never knew
On this walk of pain
