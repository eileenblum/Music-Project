There's just no beginning
And there will be no end
No need for an explanation
Of the message we will send
Once blind but now I hide
From what my eyes revealed to me
There's nothing but emptiness
Everywhere I see

Time for madness - lurking in
The shadows of the night
Time for madness - stealing
All he can from everyone

Far down the path
Light has turned to black
Watch your back!
Shades dressed in white
As the drapes are torn we are born
No control!

I feel the flames of evil
Burning inside my heart
I see miles of darkness
Just tearing me apart!

Time for madness - lurking in
The shadows of the night
Time for madness - stealing
All he can from everyone

Far down the path
Light has turned to black
Watch your back!
Shades dressed in white
As the drapes are torn we are born
No control!

Time for madness - lurking in
The shadows of the night
Time for madness - stealing
All he can from everyone

Far down the path
Light has turned to black
Watch your back!
Shades dressed in white
As the drapes are torn we are born
No control!
