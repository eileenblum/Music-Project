[Akhenaton and Nefertiti]
Guarded by the grains of the sand
Capital has moved into desert land
Guarded there from wrath of our
Enemies hand, born in grace
The cult of the sun will conquer all the world

The salvation is at hand
The dawn of a new time
The old ancients are dethroned
To benefit the sun
The cult has surely won

[The Priests]
Our heritage is raped and defiled
By mongerers of the light, we must kill'em all
Sickness of the cult is spread throughout the land followers
Of Aton must die - let's praise the ancient gods

Like the plague has swept our land
The dawn of a new time
Our ancients are defiled
To benefit the sun
Come ecliptic age

Like the plague has swept our land
The dawn of a new time
Our ancients are defiled
To benefit the sun
Come ecliptic age
