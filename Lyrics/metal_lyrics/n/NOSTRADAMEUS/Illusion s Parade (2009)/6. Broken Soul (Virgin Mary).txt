Age sixteen and on the run
She only wanna have some fun
Seeking friends inside the night
Mentor's here, hell stand the fight
Sitting on a mountain top
Girl in chains without a hope
High, into the evening sun
One step ahead, her friend is gone

In my arms, I'll make your dreams come true
In my arms, you'll feel like something

With clear blue eyes into the night
Psychedelic stars are shining bright
This baby girl ain't coming home

Self destructing, virgin soul
By now unable to control
A child inside, but outside not
He says: "Her look is all she's got"
Pain, more abuse and broken dreams
It ain't no longer what it seems
She hides the mess inside her head
Injecting confidence instead

In these arms, you'll be OK for sure
In these arms, you'll feel - well nothing...

With fading eyes into the night
The stars no longer shining bright
A broken soul ain't coming home
This broken soul ain't coming home

Entering the scene - master's forcing me
Slave once again - you're now endorsing
Needle, my friend - I need you bad now!
Save me again - like you used to do

With empty eyes into the night
The blackened skies won't hear my cries
A broken soul ain't coming home
This broken soul ain't coming home

Feel this disease - cold sweat's burning
My childhood is gone - my heart is yearning
Can't turn back time - it's far too late now
Leaving behind - virgin Mary

With empty eyes into the night
The blackened skies won't hear my cries
A broken soul ain't coming home
This broken soul ain't coming home
