I gaze into my crystal ball
and what do I see
A man with power has gone insane
and that is scaring me

A threat that can destroy the world
is rising in the sky
I see the world is near the end
I tremble and I cry

I want out of this world
The time for us is running short
When number three becomes the fourth
I want out of this world
I see a million people die
It's up to us to stop the war

When time has come there will be
nothing left for you and me
Cause toxic waste and nuclear winter
is all we see

And every try to maje things right
they all will be to late
Yeah, this is how it all will be in 2048

I want out of this world
The time for us is running short
When number three becomes the fourth
I want out of this world
I see a million people die
It's up to us to stop the war

Cause every try...

I want out od this world...
