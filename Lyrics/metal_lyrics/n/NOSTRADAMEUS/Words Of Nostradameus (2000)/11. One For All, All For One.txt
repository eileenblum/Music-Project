We've gathered here today my friends
One for all, all for one
To swear allegiance to the king
of endless faith and pride

We swear to fight until the end
One for all, all for one
Defend the crown and keep the hope
alive for all mankind

At first we didn't know
What to do with our lives
We were weck in our minds
We never even tried
To do what we were meant to do
To live our lives the way we should
But then, we finally realized

One for all, and all for one
We're keeping the flame alive until we die
One for all, and all for one
We'll fight all the forces of dark
We'll never surrender our souls
We'll never betray our king

We're standing here today my friends
One for all, all for one
On the field of death, we're standing proud and
know we're gonna die

But still we're standing side by side
One for all, all for one
We never will forget the oath we swore when
we were young

When we didn't know
What to do with our lives
We were weck in our minds
And never even tried
To do what we were meant to do
To live our lives the way we should
But then, we finally realized
One for all, and all for one
We're keeping the flame alive until we die

One for all, and all for one
We'll fight all the forces of dark
We'll never surrender our souls
We'll never betray our king

We'll do what were meant to do
We'll live our lives the way we should
'Cause we have finally realized
One for all...
