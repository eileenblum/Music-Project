Watching over misty heavens
Great landscape passes by
Feeling blood adrenalized, that's running
through my veins
As the first of lightning cracks out
My heart's pounding soon we'll see
Listen careful to my words and you will be
prepared

There will be a giant battle
Mountains of bodies, blood sheds around
Help is wanted by the full moon

See across the hills
The hope is near
The prophets are here

Through shredded landscapes we've come
To bring you hope and help
The future is our words
Our truth is all you need
You see it's breaking through now
Armageddon is here
Behold this eras end
Our prophecy's fulfilled

Birds of omen hoovers around
By reign of evil we'll stand strong
Self destuction is ther fall
the enemy is fought
Thanks to blessed foretell we won
Brothers of arms and sacred blood
Maybe we can build up this world after it's
destoyed

See across the hills
The hope is near
The prophets are here

Through shredded landscapes we've come
To bring you hope and help
The future is our words
Our truth is all you need...

Through shredded landscapes we've come...
Through shredded landscapes we've come...
