Since the day when you were born
You've meant so much to me
We played together in the sand
And dreamed how it would be
Later on when we'd grown up
We were gonna save the world
From the evil creatures who had made
our lives a misery

By the evil wizard we were torn apart
On our own we tried to make a better start

Now you say you live
Your life the way you want
But never let them chain your mind
Your eyes were once so bright
But now the flame is gone
What have you done with your life?

What has happened can't you see
what you're heading for
Break your chains and try to live
you've done it once before

Now you say you live...
Now you say you live...
