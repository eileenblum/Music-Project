I saw my place among the royal court
To be the one for people there
I could have been the king's almighty eye
As I appeared they praised my name

Hired for his highness
I told my prophecies
I gazed into the future
But I saw none of this

I'm a prophet out of time

For thousand years the force has driven us
For thousand years we've told our signs
For thousand years we've foretold miseries
For thousand years we will keep on

But the king changed his mind
Or was it just all lies?
I should have seen it coming
In visions in the past
Thrown into the crown's "inn"
Paying for my "sins"

With guards by my side
I walk towards my destiny
A snare is hanged around my neck
I'm now facing death

I'm staring mad towards the gallows pole
Afterlife embrace my soul
Chanting cries from a roaring crowd
Is telling me to burn in hell

The time has passed away
And now it's time to go
Out on a thrilling journey
Through halls of astral time

This is my last goodbye
Now it's time to die
Now it's time to die
