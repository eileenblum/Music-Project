Pain, greed, death,
Welcome the final prophecy,
Rage, war,
Shall destroy the world
A new dawn shall rise up and shine
This is the words of Nostradameus

I'm hearing strange sounds
In my study room
I know the time to act is now
I know visions will prevail for truth
Take place before my ball
of crystal so blue...
