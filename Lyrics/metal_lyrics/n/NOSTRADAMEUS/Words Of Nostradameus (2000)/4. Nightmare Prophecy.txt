Raging war cries out in war
Caused by rage of war god Mars
His warlike spirit will live on and on

Ola ancestors will come forth
From the deepest depths of hell
To where the seven kings of king
is held forevermore

Seventy times the blood
is spilled in battle
Who once created were
by the force of darkness

Deep in my log I write these words
for the world to read
Who will believe a seers mind
as I'm passed away in peace
Deep in my log I write these words
for the world to read
Book of visions will not fail
And now I'll rest in peace

Thousand ships will sail the seas
Biggest fleet in history
When the candle's out
will be the time when all occurs

Seventy times...

Deep in my log...
