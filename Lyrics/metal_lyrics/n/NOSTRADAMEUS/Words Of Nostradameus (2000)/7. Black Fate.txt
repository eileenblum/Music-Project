In the beginning I saw only
silence and cold
Then the vision I told, after I've behold
A child was born under devilish reign
To support the one under blackened name
His powers grew strong
as he aged to a man
To perform his task at the chosen time
Servant of darkness and demigod
He enslaved the ones
of this beautiful world

Evil possess hte strangest shapes
And in a dark age, can it be stopped?
The year two thousand has just stroke
And the holy core of mankind
Who will stop it now
Before it's too late
It's up to you...

I see only war
As the sands are running low
In this world we must realize
And wake up before it's over

Sometimes the prophecies is not fulfilled
Let's just hope that this one is not for real
And thus I will end the third prophecy
This is the wake up call for all mankind
Evil possess...

I see only war...

I see only war...
