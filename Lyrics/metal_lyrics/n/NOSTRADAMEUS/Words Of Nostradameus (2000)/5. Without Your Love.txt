Love is great but yet painfully
Making scars I never would believe
You might know what I'm thinking of
I cry my tears eternally
Read this lines and understand
I will never be free
Free from the force of loneliness
As the past still haunts

We had joy and we had hard times
Now I see how my big mistake were dum
You might know what I'm thinking of
Please forgive me for being such a fool
Read these lines and understand
I will never be free
Free from thoughts of regretfulness

Time is running late...

This is not the way I wanna live my life
This is not the way I thought it would be
To live without your love
To live without your smile
So my friend, please come back to me now

But oh no, I know it's to late
To make our souls bounds of immortality
You have gone just on and on
From your love and devotioness for me
Read these lines and understand
I will never be free
Free from thoughts of tradegy
Set my spirit free

This is not the way...

Read these lines and understand
I will never be free
Free from this legacy
Your love gave to me

This is not the way...

This is not the way...
