Woke up at night, in horror and fever,
Feeling death-damp and pain in the liver.
I saw a nightmare through my fairy dream,
And it washed me just like an ice-cold stream.
Once I was told by a fortune-teller:
You were the last man standing in valor
Scars on the soul are never too old,
They donât age with time - they only grow,
Blood cannot warm up scars on the soul,
Scars cause me pain for theyâre never too old!
Years bring us one scar after other,
Friends pass away, children lose their mothers,
Pain within me is becoming stunning,
I guess my time to fade out is coming.
I want to take things under my control,
Instead the scar is still gnawing my soul.
I stay up all night and go through this ache,
Iâm so scared to die before Iâm awake!
