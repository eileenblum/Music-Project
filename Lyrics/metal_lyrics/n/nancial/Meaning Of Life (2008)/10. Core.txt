I don't know why
I want you to define
My comfort's far in mind
You are my last footstep to fly
Turn yourself to be my core
Is it too much that I'm asking for1?
Every time you ask me why
I want to feel alive.
When you hear my call
you turn your face to sky!
And I forget
I'm only a spirit but understand
I must love these things I hate
You are my last footstep to fly
