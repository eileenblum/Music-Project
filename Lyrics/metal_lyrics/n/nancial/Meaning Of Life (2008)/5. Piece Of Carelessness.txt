Once I had a close friend
She was so right and nice
For all her goodness and concern
She asked nothing in return
I took it all for granted
And did not care much
I knew she will be there
To help me anytime
But it happened so that
I hurt her feelings again
And she just left
With no coming back
I felt her absence as if
I had a knife inside my heart
I just gave up and
All my life just fell apart
Come back! Can you hear me?!
Come back! I beg, I pray
Come back and stay!
Stay with me
I know Iâm the one to blame
And Iâm guilty, Iâm unkind
I deserve to dieâ¦
