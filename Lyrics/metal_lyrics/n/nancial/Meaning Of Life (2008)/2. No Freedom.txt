We are living under pressure
We cannot say what we believe
is true
There is no freedom left for us
There are no actions we can take
To change this
Yeah, we have to fight this system
We have to make it fall apart
Fight! Don't spare your life!
Just break away
Just break away to end the day!
Everybody knows the system kills us
everyone is bitterly unhappy
with his life
But No! they take to action
Just sit at home intimidated and afraid
Yeah, we have to fight this system
We have to make it fall apart
Fight! Don't spare your life!
Just break away
Just break away to end the day!
But I know, one body is nobody
I have no power to defeat them
Once for all
So I just wait and hope my day will come
The slaves will rise, shed some blood
and conquer after all
