You ask me something all the time
Presuming I should know a lot
About this life
About you and me
My brains explode every time
I am thinking of you
Apathy takes over me when you come in
But somehow I just know
That I care about you
Oh God, please find a way
To stand all these questions
All the stupid suggestions
All the endless lectures
All this disgrace
Come on!
Just ask me - something!
But then I saw you smile
In this homicidal manner
And got the trick
You are thinking I am a stupid freak
Sick! I'm sick of you!
Nothing! I want from you!
