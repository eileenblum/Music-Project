I know what life is all about
All that's left to do is shout
My dark destiny is calling out
And I'm going to break out loud
I want to end it all at once
Let the world just fade away
I will take my lethal chance
I've never liked it anyway
Let the world just fade away
I've never liked it anyway
I see just ruins all around
I feel the sun burns through my skin
There are no wars or hatred found
Neither there is anyone of kin
I see no sun - it doesn't rise
I believe the earth is dead
I know humanity will see demise
I cannot live - I can't forget
I believe the earth is dead
I cannot live - I can't forget
