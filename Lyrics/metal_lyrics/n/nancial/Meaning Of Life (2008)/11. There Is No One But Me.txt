But darkness is inside
Still lives in me
And this very day
It wants to be freed
Make it free
Please, make it free
I wake up and see - the room is empty
There's no one but me
The world is open to the feelings I have
It's the way I've chosen and I feel safe
I got up and flee
I try to escape from this rage
It's taking over me
There's no place I can hide
I keep running away
I'm afraid I won't endure this ride
And I will cry
And I will die
