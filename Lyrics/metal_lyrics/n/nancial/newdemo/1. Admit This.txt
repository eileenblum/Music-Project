A wiry laugh, a deadly nerve
Eternal price of hidden passion
Create your god just to believe
And I will watch you go insane
But me - I want to stay alive
It seems our minds are the one
I just need to tear away
For our lives to be saved

[Chorus:]
Open your eyes and admit this
You have lost all of your mind
And your only dream has turned
Into horror and shame
