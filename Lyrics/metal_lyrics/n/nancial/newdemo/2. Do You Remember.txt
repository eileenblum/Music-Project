Do you remember the time when we were together
Do you remember the nights you said weâd be forever
And now these words just fade away
You lied to me and you will pay

[Chorus:]
Pay!
For all the things you said
For all the games you played
For all the things you said
For all that pain you made

I just canât sleep I just canât breathe
The rage is taking over me
I just want you to be killed
For this relationship you built

[Chorus:]
Pay!
For all the things you said
For all the games you played
For all the things you said
For all that pain you made

Payâ¦
Fade awayâ¦
You will pay and fade away
