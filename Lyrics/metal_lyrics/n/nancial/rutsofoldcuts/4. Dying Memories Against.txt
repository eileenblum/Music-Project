You've found the reason
Why people kill
You don't think it's a treason
You just get the thrill
I've made my final decision
And this is what I envision
My love -
Is Running blood though your hands
Is Blasting scream no one can miss
Is Crawling fear inside my veins
Is Dying memories against
You've found new faith,
But I know what lies beneath
Perfection of the game we play
It Makes me desire to stay
I know that my destiny is
To die with this ultimate kiss
