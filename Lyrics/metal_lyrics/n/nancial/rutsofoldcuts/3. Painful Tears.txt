[Chorus:]
He flies above the streets
He feeds with human fears
The only light he greets
Is light of painful tears

[Verse:]
His mission is to kill
The people that make sins
He will do it until
The demon gives him wings

[Chorus:]
He flies above the streets
He feeds with human fears
The only light he greets
Is light of painful tears
To run away from dreams
He thought âbout suicide
How foolishly it seems
He found easy way to die
Of course he did a sin
And Lay the way to hell
But now he is obscene
Cause not belong to...
