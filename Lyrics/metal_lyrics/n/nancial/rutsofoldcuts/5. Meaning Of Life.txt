Until the sun rises up, without a doubt
The darkness will hold me tight
The meaning of life that I have found
Has always been in this dark light
The words I am told, they make no sense
Iâm totally deaf, separating from you
Without showing you my ignorance
I lie in the same way as I always do
I wonât waste myself on you
Why can't you set me free?
I see the sun and feel the dew
I hate the way youâre trying me
This smile is the last one before I hate
Myself because of what I havenât done
They swear it is never too late
Iâll be on top when we're 'bout to see the sun
The more you say, the less I hear
Donât keep it all inside your mind
I know the end of this is near
I've never loved the one of your kind
