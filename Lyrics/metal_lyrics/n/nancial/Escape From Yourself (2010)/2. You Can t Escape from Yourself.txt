Why is everyone looking at me?Maybe they know what I know'bout things that make me fleeFeeling alone in the crowdThey look with thoughtful eyesHardly covering the sneerAs if they know 'bout my liesI'm afraid my destiny is nearWho... Do you know this?Are... Can you feel it?You... Will you forget me?I am you and you are me -Inseparable identitySo, you can't escape from yourselfThe only way is to travel to hell
