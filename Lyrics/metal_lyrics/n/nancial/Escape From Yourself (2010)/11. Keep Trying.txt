This impenetrable darkness has come down on my inner worldThere are no thoughtsNo feelings, no emotionsOnly all-absorbing emptinessOf soul and my mindWith time I come to thinkThere is no exit, no escapeIâ€™m attempting to do somethingTo change this awful situationBut still it seems All of this is useless and in vainI have to do all my bestJust to achieve my goalAnd to change my lifeAs I know that I can do itIt is the way how it should beI just keep trying Though it seems as always hopelessAnd one moment I understandThat I have reached this crucial pointThis ray of light that gives me hopeAnd helps me to go on forever furtherI have to do all my bestJust to achieve my goalAnd to change my lifeAs I know that I can do itIt is the way how it should be
