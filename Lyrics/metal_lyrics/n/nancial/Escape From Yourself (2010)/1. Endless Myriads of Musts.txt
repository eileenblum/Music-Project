Here i am sitting fresh and youngIt seems like the world is open to meEvery door i knock, every step i takeIs a small adventure - i am totally freeTime is a dreadful thing - it passes byTaking away my youth, my freedom and my soulI fallAnd finally, my youth becomes the matter of the pastI am like many others - forever tired and depressedDoing what i dislike and hating everyone i seeSo long, my liberated soul!And i fallUnder endless myriads of must'sEverywhere i look are obligations and restraintsTime is a dreadful thing - it passes byTaking away my youth, my freedom and my soulI fall Under endless myriads of mustsEverywhere i look are obligations and restraintsEternal youth and not lessI'd be its slave to the graveTasting life in every possible wayAs if it is my last breath
