Hey,you there,Are you to fool me again?I know and can't help thisYou are bound to hurt meJust Like thousand ones beforeAnd I know, I just knowI'm forever aloneLiberated and goneLet's enjoy the show!But my lifeIs only sharp edgesOf the things that onceWere my dreamsI'm alone among strangersSome of them pretend to be friendsBut my life isOnly sharp edgesOf the things that once were my dreams
