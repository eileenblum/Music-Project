So i'm there, the bed is hardi can not see a thingI am thirsty and starving - what would that mean?My head is sore and heavy, the body is in painI feel hostility embedding me and someone lurkHey, where am I? Who are you?Tell me - I need to know!Why are you staring at me?Tell me! Right now!In endless terror I hear someone open the doorI struggle to shout but my throat is soreI jump to my feet being ready to spurSomething is coming to take me to hell!The heavy hand is put on my shoulderThinking I'm doomed I start to screamThen I feel someone shaking meAnd soft kind words 'wake up, my dear!'
