You died so many years agoYou left no one to bear in mindWhat you have doneThroughout your lifeAll your emotions left youNo feeling left to move your soulYou feel no tasteOf this worn-out lifeAnd now when you lie woundedWhen all your flesh is torn apartYou understand that all these yearsYou were nothingBut an empty vial with no content
