You've made a mistake, the things you fought with - wasn't rightYou're not a HeroYou always bothered me to do what I mightyou've made a mistakeLook back, what have you done!And now you sitting aloneForsaken, forgotten, unknownYou thought you was rightYou have to understandYou're not a heroFace The truthLook in the mirrorYou'll see the evilIt's too lateNo one can help youAll you gain - is hateAnd you know it's trueRemember the time you were youngYou was so strong and selfishAnd maybe everything could be all rightIf you chose the right wayBut now you sitting aloneForsaken, forgotten, unknownYou thought you was rightYou have to understandIt's too lateNo one can help youAll you gain - is hateAnd you know it's true
