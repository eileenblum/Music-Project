We are running from ourselves
And I'm just tired to be in search of a better life
This will never end
This will never end
I'm playing fool with myself
And now i'm falling to the ground
I'm decieve myself
I'm falling to the ground
This is my own grave
Nothing Holds me in this life
No hope, no love, no future
I know nobody's waiting
And there is no place to go
Nothing left but hatred
And hate is the reason of disaster
I'm falling to the ground
And through the darkness i see the light
I feel free
So, I feel free
Nothing holds me in this life
No hope, no love, no future
