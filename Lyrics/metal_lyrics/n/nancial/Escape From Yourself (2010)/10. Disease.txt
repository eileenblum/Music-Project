Sometimes it is hard to tell
Whether the world is like hell
Or it is just our life
To always crawl and never fly
Why? Tell me why
Have you sacrificed your life
In the war that was never yours
Without reason or any cause
War is a deadly decease
Those infected die
The ones who survive
Suffer hellish agony of pain
And never cry
You have so many deadly wounds
But you still on your feet
For you don't want the enemy to see
You fall into the dirt
You'll never recognize defeat
In the war that was never yours
Without reason or any cause
War is a deadly decease
Your former friends have sold
You for the brick of gold
So on your knees you yell:
Oh devil - watch out!
I'm coming
To see you
in hell!
