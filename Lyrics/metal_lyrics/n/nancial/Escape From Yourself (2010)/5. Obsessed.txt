There are these days when you are lazy all the time
when all the feelings leave you empty
so you just look and can not see
you listen and don't hear a sound
Your blood is frozen in your veins
As if no life is left in you at all
And you go on through frozen city to nowhere 
You're obsessed with one and only thought
Why?
Why has this city chosen you for its designs?
This frozen city is merciless to your emotions
You try to gather up your thoughts
And to remember sweet moments of your life
But you cant find the answers to your questions
You just go on through cold city to nowhere
You're obsessed with one and only thought
Why?
Why has this city chosen you for its designs?
This frozen city is merciless to your emotions
