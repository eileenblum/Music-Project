So when you are about to cross the divideWhen all your emotions are goneYou realize the laws of this city have no power over youBecause you are able to withstandThe iron will of frozen citySo often you feel as if you were some machineYou do what you mustAnd there is no way to change itYou act as they sayAnd no alternative ways there existYou are held captive to the laws of the crowdFeeling like a single drop of fresh waterIn the endless and merciless seaThat engulfs you and brings you furtherStraight to the edges of deadly cliffsRide the waves the way you want itMake the world your fine playgroundTame the tempestWalk free right across the sea!One day you understand the power to defeat themLies in the inner world of yoursYou are the one who holds this powerIn the very depths of your forever-living soul
