"IÂ´m bleeding from my heart,
Hearing like weep the silence,
My blood run in endless nights
Why? slayed my dreams,
Now, I see like vanish the moon
And loneliness is all I feel".

Her skin yet awake my erotism
But the gloom hide my dying emotions
Before afire breeze of honest desire
Now the clouds full the sky of lust.
Fiendish fog of the dismal dusk
That your veil close the portal
Your whip will avenge my wounds
Blinding her illusions in my name.
Seeking fortress in the umbral of shades
Her abysmal absence prevails the hate
Between the waves of past and my fate
Broken for have trust in a forgotten fire.
Walking slowly in the void of my desolation
Watching like die in my soul the last inspiration
The muse belong me, now she is an obsession
Her misfortune will be my rite of satisfaction.

Silent winds that drag the dust
Like an evilness that kill the core
Blowing with anger, change the course
Covering of tragedy the sound of my voice.
Perverse desire that dwell on earth
Destroy the weakness of this suffering
My somber depression is summoning
For the evil calm that lurk the disdain.

The final stone is called: Deception
This scar is the sign of dejection
One to one my tears say: Delusion.

Inner dimension reflected in cruelty
Remembers burst your stupid vanity
Feigning the sweet face of honesty.

Symbolic forest of demons blessed me
Now is my turn for her agony
The ashes proclaim for my victory.

"I was, am now, and shall have no end"
Sinister lament full of misery
Show my ritual in her reality...
