Ancient scriptures of enslavement
Imposed for an injust GOD,
Words written for twelve stupid men
Obsessed with the sin and the faith.

"I Believed in a perpetual being
That is manifest on all, on all it that exist,
Not in the god, not in the god that judge the actions;
The actions of the men".

The darkness give life to the dreams,
Why? The light only make you wake up.

The religion only give you orders.
That sorrowful will be your eternal life.

The religion only give you orders.
That sorrowful will be your eternal life...
