[Chorus:]
Beyond the infinite veil of universe
Is opening a gateway in the heavens
Stars above, cruelty and wrath below.

The everlasting night has been manifested
Where a somber angel with evil is obsessed
The self denial of the dreams of the human race.

âSpeak the prayer of your Evilness
The life has created me for the throne
And our power is advice from the horizon.â

With evil is obsessed, with evil is obsessed,
with evil is obsessed
Each one of us is a killer of the specie
Destructive emotions from all evil influence.

With evil is obsessed, with evil is obsessed,
with evil is obsessed
Give me grace in the presence of death
Drop to drop the blood has filled the earth.

âMy Unholy Body is a temple
Wherein all yours souls Dwell.
A Pantheon of Shadows. Am I
A Palace of Perversity. Evil of mine!â

This century has prepared me for the empire
And the coming of the years of triumph
The people of the earth have been possessed
We are spirituals lords, living in this world.

Set me free from the limitations of law
Turn in hurricane the softly winds
The voice of devil give me the sign.
My mercy change now in my evil.

My Unholy Body is a temple of damn
Wherein all yours souls Dwell.
A Pantheon of Shadows. Am I
A Palace of Perversity. Evil of mine!

[Chorus:]
Beyond the infinite veil of universe
Is opening a gateway in the heavens
Stars above, cruelty and wrath below.

The everlasting night has been manifested
Where a somber angel with evil is obsessed
The self denial of the dreams of the human race.
