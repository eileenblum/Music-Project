[Chorus:]
Just before magical midnight
When the moon is nearest to earth
Either before or after
Is the proper time of his rite.

Everywhere he finds himself
In the flames and surface of mist.
âNow is the time that night
Equal day and day equals nightâ

[Chorus:]
Just before magical midnight
When the moon is nearest to earth
Either before or after
Is the proper time of his rite.

Under the glittering horns of Dragon
When the mountains of the north.
Announced the howls of the black wolf
In the cold light of the Moon.

All evil and madness rest in him
Like soul possessed for demoniac armies.

[Chorus:]
Just before magical midnight
When the moon is nearest to earth
Either before or after
Is the proper time of his rite.

His dwelling cavern is built
With blood an the flesh
The pillars theres are of fire
And the walls are of air
The root above if the breathe
Of his eternal spiritless body.

[Chorus:]
Just before magical midnight
When the moon is nearest to earth
Either before or after
Is the proper time of his rite.

He leaves the cradle of his grave
And wander through the valleys
Over the hills across the deserts
And through the cool groves of nights
For pagan hereticâs blood
Come fullmoon the one life is the Death.

Is the Hominis Nocturna.
