[lyrics: Uziel / music: Uziel &amp; Nihilistikrypt]

How come you keep on
Living in conditions
Not suitable for you

Addicted to passions
Increasing the value
Of life just for you

What's your excuse
For useless existence
Just degenerating

Nobody would care
I mean, in general,
If you'd just disappear

Get a life, get intelligence
Admit: you're expired
There's a better life in paradise
In which you believe so much
But they say: there aren't any
You say: I don't buy that
Do a favour to society:
Just die and prove otherwise!

Expired
Worn out
You're out of date
