[lyrics: Sorts / music: Sorts &amp; Nihilistikrypt]

Wastelands of demons,
Foggy landscapes,
Smell the darkness.
No light dwells here
And never shall again.
Harmony is vanquished.
Triumph of Chaos!
Triumph Of Chaos!

Chants of Blasphemy
Forever I shall rebel against thee!

Your servants I disgust,
Against the Trinity
And their doctrines.
I praise sin and lust,
Against the virtue
Of religion.
I have chosen my path,
Left Hand Path!
Left Hand Path!

"This Christian faith of yours is too soft for our folk. And we may not be
soft people. Therefore speak nought to my sons of the White Christ."
[K. A. Hindrey "Urmas and Merike"]
