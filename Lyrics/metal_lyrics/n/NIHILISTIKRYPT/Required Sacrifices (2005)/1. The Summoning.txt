[intro, lyrics: Sorts / music: Sorts &amp; Nihilistikrypt]

Let the crypt be opened again
Let the realm of the ancients come

Summoning fury and chaos
Summoning the hidden darkness

Ritual to reveal secrets
Ritual of eternal wisdom

Through torture eyes shall open
Through blade black blood awakes

Prepared we are to wake the One
Required Sacrifice is done!

Rise from the depths of the Abyss!!!
Awake from the deep slumber!!!

Rise from the depths of the Abyss!!!
Awake from the deep slumber!!!

Rise from the depths of the Abyss!!!
Awake From the Deep of Slumber!!!

Rise from the depths of the Abyss!!!
Awake from the deep slumber!!!

Rise from the depths of the Abyss!!!
Awake from the Deep of Slumber!!!

Rise from the depths of the Abyss!!!
Awake from the deep slumber!!!
