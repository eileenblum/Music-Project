[lyrics: Uziel / music: Uziel &amp; Nihilistikrypt]

What colour is equality?
Blue as your vicious eyes
Glowing traitorous promises
But not after I poke them out

What colour is your friendship?
Black as your rigid heart
Black as the hate inside me
Black as the soil I'll bury you in alive

What colour is your peace?
White as your lying smile
Which you wear with pride
But not after torn to pieces

What colour is my justice?
After burying you alive
After poking out your blue eyes
After cutting you to pieces
It is red as the bleeding ground
It is red as my satisfying sundown

Don't deny what you've become
You are nothing but shadow...
