[lyrics: Uziel / music: Uziel &amp; Nihilistikrypt]

I hate everything
I hate incompetence, certain breeds,
Absence of death penalty
I hate everything
I hate ignorance, hypocrisy,
Unnecessary civil laws
I hate everything
I hate ambassadors, regulations,
limitations, orders
I hate everything
I hate manifests, compromise,
Victimless non-brutal wars

What do you see
What do you hear
What do you read
What do you like

What makes you -
That is all I hate

I hate everything
I hate monogamy, satisfaction,
Pubic hair, STD-s
I hate everything
I hate parental advisory,
Squealers and faggots
I hate everything
I hate wasting time, sanity,
The useless ones kept alive
I hate everything
Except for the things you hate...
You will be food for maggots.
