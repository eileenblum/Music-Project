In your eyes are raging seas...
You won't see my misery...
How could one so merciful rend my soul to save it?...
Seduce me and then turn away...
Hold my hand and clutch my throat...
You have always been the one to break my fall and kill me...
And in the silence I awaken...
Cast off the shroud you've draped around me...
Your beauty brings me resurrection...
This is too real... this is to life...
As death, to me...
In your grip is suffering...
My one wish: to end this pain...
Draw my hands across your face...
And kiss your lips before me...
See through my recalcitrance...
Hold me close... it's my last chance...
You can take my life from me and damn me to adore you...
And in the silence...
