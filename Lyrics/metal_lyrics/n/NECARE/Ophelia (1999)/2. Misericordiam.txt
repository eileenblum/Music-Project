Misericordiam... I sing of misery...
I embrace the end...
The willows bend... the cistern fills with tears...
Celestine is thy bed of death...
My sorrow is abject...
Through shrouds of linen I bewail...
Thy passing...
In my heart the tempest rages silent...
There is a prison from which none can escape...
We all share this fate...
Try to perceive the shore on which we stand...
The tides too soon abate...
I shall draw my last breath...
And twitch in fever's warm caress...
Ex stasis... light fading...
Witness my soul's egress...
And there will be no more sorrow...
And there will be no more emptiness...
And with open arms embrace mortality...
We'll sleep together for all eternity...
