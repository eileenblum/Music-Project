A deep and dreamless sleep unite...
This Fragile heart and sacrifice...
To cut the throat in praise of sin...
A bastard lie begets the end...
There is no life but that death allows...
There is no will above the gnawing, writhing worms...
It takes us all both young and old...
A wall of voices seething cold...
Shapeless forms scurry amongst shadows entwined...
Bearers of anguish exist within this desolate heart...
Breathing within its walls, I hear them faintly moaning...
A choir of all faith departed... infernally droning...
The language of the dead, the ones whom the light has forsaken...
Abandoned in tenebrous dream, never to awaken...
A fleeting glimpse of hell, before I drown below...
In darkest waves of ebony, death is all I know...
