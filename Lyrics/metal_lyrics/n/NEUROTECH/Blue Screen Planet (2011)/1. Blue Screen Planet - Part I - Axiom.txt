We are on the same side
Yet torn apart
A distant memory
Of life without these scars
Are you always looking for something
âCause in denial I found
What I already
Wanted to know
I feel the world took
Part of my mind
Swept my consciousness
And dissolved me to ice
âCause we are always on opposite sides
For every burning bridge we unite
And swallow our pride
For it is too late to turn back the time
âCause in the mirror I got the ultimate blow
It was the face I donât want to know
So much complexion - yet lack of perfection
The inner struggle - the path of defection
Are we really here - now that is a question
Lucky for you - âcause you know the answer
We are the blue screen planet
And we are numb
Through the fog of confusion
Through the eyes that barely see
Through the pain and suffering
Through despair and misery
Survive by arrogance
And lack of intelligence
You built this wall
From which you run away
Itâs hard to turn away
When pain and guilt awaits
When there is no one around
No one around you
Now you take the blame
No one around you
Now you take the blame
Run away, run away
Run away from the blue screen planet
Now ! Run away, Now !
The only thing I must ask you now
Are you afraid of this ?
This parallel reality ?
This mindfuck parasite
No hope for you and I
No
So much complexion - yet lack of perfection
The inner struggle - the path of defection
Are we really here - now that is a question
Lucky for you - âcause you know the answer
We are the blue screen planet
And we are numb
You built this wall
For years to come
This sickening mindset
You must overcome
Now !
We are everything
In this world of nothing
This mindfuck parasite
No hope for you and I
