Why only words can save you? 
Say them yourself 
Just to be sure 
We brought ourselves 
Into this world 
With a disease and a cure 

The offering of salvation 
Only you can make 
Without warning 
Well, I can't do anything 
The only way is to turn back time 

Enter the realm of nothingness 
Enter the realm of... 

...Hope 
The lost hope 

Are you still here? Is your heart still beating? 
I hope you get out of this hole 

The suffering of salvation 
Only you can make 
Without warning 
Well, I can't do anything 
The only way is to turn back time 

Without understanding 
The pressure will grind us down 
Between two absolutes 
There is only decline 
In withered harmony 
We could be fine
