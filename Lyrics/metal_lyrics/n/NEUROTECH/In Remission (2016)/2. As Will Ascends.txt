So, this is how far we've come 
In hostile times 
Feelings become hollow 
Never question the goals 
Of spirit 
Of mindfulness 
Of sorrow 

As will ascends 
Rises up 
From the well 
And as you'll sink again 
I'll light up 
The way 

Caught in the night time glow 
Accept my hand that you know 
I never trust the world 
Never, I just let it go 
And I swim 

In exposure
