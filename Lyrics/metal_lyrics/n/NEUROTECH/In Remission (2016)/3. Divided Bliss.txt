Some things are better not to know 

From the gutter of emptiness 
I utter my everything 
Caught in the web and I don't care 
Anymore 

In denial of remedy 
Viciously crafted melancholy 
Is paving the way 
Like never before 

Breaking out like it's the first time 
No incident is just like the last one 
Divided bliss comes from the causes 
After all, we design our own choices 
Within 

Some things are better not to know 
Sometimes it's better just to go 
Through hard times 

There can be so many changes 
To ease the strain 
So many ways to rearrange this 
Just redefine strength of the soul 

Redefine strength of the soul
