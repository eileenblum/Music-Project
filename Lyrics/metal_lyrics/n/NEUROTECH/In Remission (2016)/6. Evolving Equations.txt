When you're submerged 
And you're calling out 
While drowning 
This scourge 
Will drag you down 
And tear your skin 
Don't give in 

Evolving to live without 
Enough said, it's nothing 
Resolving 
I'm fading out 
From this haze 
There's nothing left 

This scourge 
Will break your vows 
Spit you out 
Don't give in 

If you can't 
Then please stay away 
Save your prayers 
I'll break this 

I've brought myself to you 
But now I'm contemplating 

This may never end 
I've noticed 
Evolving 
Calling your name 
This may never end 
Resolving 
I'm calling your name 
This may never end 

Again
