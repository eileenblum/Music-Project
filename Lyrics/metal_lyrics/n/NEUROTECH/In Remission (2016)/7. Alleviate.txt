Forsaken self 
Accepts nothing in return 
Nothing 
The sound of the rain 
Washes me from within 

I've burned the bridges 
Confined the guilt 
From the burning heights 
To the freezing cold 

I succumb 
To a deep inner self 
Where I'm trying to understand 
The balance 
Where the value of connection 
Is now truly gone 

I'm trying to understand 
If the battle is lost or won 

In the middle of the night 
You kept saying 

Give me something to go on
