Are we prepared to go? 
Where the fire burns 
A place we can face ourselves 
Open the gates 
To deliverance 
Why should we try? 
We are insignificant 
No, no this time 

Not this time 

Lead me with your story 
Lead me with your life 
Tell me what you're thinking 
Tell me all your lies 
Lead me with your future 
Lead me on your path 
Tell me all your wishes 
Tell me are we built to last 

Are we strong enough? 
To build each other's trust 
And to escape from these chains 
Open the gates 


Tell me are we built to last
