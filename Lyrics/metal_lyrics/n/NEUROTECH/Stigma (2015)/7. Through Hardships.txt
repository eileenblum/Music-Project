For one last time 
Before I go away 
Hold still 
Don't be afraid 
Take this part of me 
Breathe 
Ease your pain 

We can work it out 
Just remember this 

We find our strength through hardships 
Otherwise we cannot see the truth 
We find ourselves through hardships 
Everything has a point of view 

Through difficulties 
Through suffering 
Trial to the other side 
Of pain 

Things will get better 

You are not alone
