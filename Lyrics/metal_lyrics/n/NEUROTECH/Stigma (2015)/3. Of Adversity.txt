Beneath the cold inlay 
Distant and named 
This skin is shed but thin 
Where to start, where to begin 

Four eyes cannot see the same 
Just say those words that hurt 
In myself 
I've found the strength to say 

A storm is coming 
I won't succumb to fear 

I hope 
Never to return 
To that place 
Where I don't want to be 
I must not 
Forget what I've learned 
In that place 
Of Adversity 

No light can shine through me 
Resistant yet inflamed 
From innocence into a cold embrace 
Some scars may never see the light again 

Four eyes paint a different trail 
Repeat those unheard words 
Despite your tears I've found the strength to say 

A storm is coming 
I won't succumb to fear 

I must not forget how this world is meant to be seen 

I must not forget 

I must not
