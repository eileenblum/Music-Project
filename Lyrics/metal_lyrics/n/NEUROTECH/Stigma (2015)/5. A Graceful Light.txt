Before the dawn 
There was no understanding 
No thoughts were formed 
Through ashes and pressure 
We found our hidden hearts 
Our view on pain and pleasure 
Was careless, but nonetheless 
The crown of thorns kept flashing 
What we've repressed 

Engraved tears 
In light come clear 
A graceful light 
Disappears from your face 

Disappear into nothing 
From nothing to divine sky 
Shadows, forgotten rejoice 
Hear my voice 
Do you remember when we fell 
And there was no one 
To pick us up 
Just embers of our last time 
Our last goodbye 

We've been here before 
And we are here again 
Waiting for our darkest hour
