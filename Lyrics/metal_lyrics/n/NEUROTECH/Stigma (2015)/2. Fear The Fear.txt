From the beginning 
Until the end 
Unanswered questions 
Relapse again 
Battle of reason 
Death of free will 
When senses betray 
Hold tight and persevere 

Fear the Fear 
The sky becomes clear 
There is no one 
Nobody is coming to save you 
Save yourself 
Fear the Fear 
Year after year 
'Cause I've noticed 
Nobody is coming to save you 
Save yourself 

With two intentions 
To push and sustain 
A downward spiral 
Every step of the way 
Sense of rejection 
Thoughts unexplained 
Death of perception 
Intimacy evaporates 

Save yourself
