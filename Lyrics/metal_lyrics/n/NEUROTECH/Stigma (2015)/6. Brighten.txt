What you've passed on to me 
Will stay until the end of days 
Forever 

Time stops on the verge of decay 
Forgotten cause, no need to remain 
Maybe it's a sign how I will always miss you 
Or maybe there are voices at play 
Telling it's too late 

Here comes the sun 

Don't listen to what they say 
It will come anyway 
It may brighten just one day 
Don't fear what they say 
It will come anyway 
And it will brighten yet another day 

Among shadows in the dark 
We carve our names 
These voices will stay 
Until the end of our days 
'Cause we are in this together 

Undone 

Here comes the sun
