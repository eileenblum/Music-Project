No turning back 
Turn around from this vicious cycle 
Turn around from the things you can't explain 
Turn around from the fear inside you 
What fear ? 
Fear does not matter to me 
If you want to be, anything better 
Let me, save you from yourself 
And from the chains, the chains that bind you 
Descent from the cloud 
The cloud 
No turning back 
It's all imaginary 
For all those years to come, it was neccesary 
It's all imaginary 
Don't try to find it 
Turn around from the ghost that guides you 
Turn around from the mask you cannot change 
Look around, the past is behind you 
What past ? 
Past does not matter to me 
If you want to be, anything better 
Let me, save you from yourself 
And from the pain, the pain that hunts you 
Descent from the cloud 
The cloud 
No turning back 
It's all imaginary 
For all those years to come, it was neccesary 
It's all imaginary 
Don't try to find it 
This was only a test 
I know 
Yeah I know 
I am not coming back for more 
Cause this was only a test 
No turning back
