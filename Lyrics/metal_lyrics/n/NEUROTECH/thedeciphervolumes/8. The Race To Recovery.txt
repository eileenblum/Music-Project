erase me, don't tell me 
i'll take you far away from here 
delete me, complete me 
in the race to recovery 

i've come to the end of a tunnel 
i've seen that light exist 
but it's not a part of your soul 
it's all beyond control 

what to say 
at least i am trying 
what to say 
to runaway, runaway 

what to say 
the leaves are dying 
i am pushing you 
far away, far away 

yet nothing has changed 
you are still a part of me 
there's not more to say 
the pain is still the same 

erase me, don't tell me 
i'll take you far away from here 
delete me, complete me 
in the race to recovery 

not the same 
while the road is still rising 
not the same 
but i am coming near 
not myself 
but what i am becoming 
i am shifting into higher gear 

what to say 
the race is ongoing 
what to say 
it's built with fear 
what to say 
i am gathering power 
for pushing you 
far away from here 

there is only one thing i would want you to know 
i never thought that i could be so cold 
i send these words of mine into the wide world 
i never thought you could be so cold 

so cold 

the race to recovery
