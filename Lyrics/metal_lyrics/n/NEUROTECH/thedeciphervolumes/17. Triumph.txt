The wheel of hope 
Starts turning 
It may turn back 
Ignore it 

You build a home 
Along the way 
When the way turns black 
Just don't care 

What I hear 
Is not what I see 
What I fear now 
Is what it is left of me 

What I hear 
Is not what I see 
All is clear now 
Why it came to this 

The silence has won 
As we are too 
This is a triumph 
From me to you 
From me to you 

United as one 
Divided in two 
This is a triumph 
For me and you 
For me and you 

For me and you 

Climbing up 
I am slowly climbing up 
Climbing up 
The enemy is in us 

The silence has won 
As we are too 
This is a triumph 
From me to you 
From me to you 

United as one 
Divided in two 
This is a triumph 
For me and you 
For me and you
