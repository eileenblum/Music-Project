this immaculate guilt has caused me 
more pain than i'll ever need 
more than i'll ever need 

you sleep so long so you don't feel 
life is too ugly when it's real for you 
no 

it's the feeling.. 

..like something was taken from me 
yet nothing can stop us now 

let's dance 
the cyber waltz 
let's dance 
another cyber waltz 

turn the page for all of us three 
much needed of serenity 
in need of serenity 

below this greed and lust we are torn 
the plot will thicken as we want more 
no 

it's the feeling.. 

..like something was taken from me 
yet nothing can stop us now 

let's dance 
the cyber waltz 
let's dance 
another cyber waltz 

this time you will listen to me 
i am sick of this fake honesty 
in this triangle of nothing 

you wake up only when things get real 
life is ugly when you feel 

so fuck it 
and let's dance 

let's dance 
the cyber waltz 
let's dance 
another cyber waltz
