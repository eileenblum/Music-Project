a clouded mind 
the only one 
who can help 
to tear us apart 

same story again 
but today its not unbearable 
to tell you the truth 
just like you 
i am forgettable 

yes 

a decision was made 
for the thoughts you will never know 
still the question remains 
do you still think of me ? 

yes 

when clouded my mind becomes 
a clouded mind 
when i am the only one 
the only one 
with power to help someone 
who can help 
when life tear us apart 
tear us apart 

tear us apart 

what about 
same old song 
are you there ? 
are you there for me ? 
i am glad to know 
you are here 
you are here for me 

yes 

when clouded my mind becomes 
a clouded mind 
when i am the only one 
only one 
with power to help someone 
who can help 
when life tear us apart 
tear us apart 

a clouded mind
