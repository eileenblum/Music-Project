find your way 

we came to the end 
out of faith 
out of last 
sentiment 

we came out of place 
out of hate 
out of fate 
just emptiness 

i have come to taste 
path of hollow 
i have come to taste 
path of sorrow 
where do you want me to go 

let me know 

it's time to go now 
don't you stay 
turn around when life puts you down 

you are in control now 
don't you wait 
let life find a separate way 

we came to the end 
without pain 
without lust 
sentiment 

we came to the phase 
full of faith 
and complete 
indifference 

i have come to taste 
path of hollow 
i have come to taste 
path of sorrow 
where do you want me to go 

let me know 

it's time to go now 
don't you stay 
turn around when life puts you down 

you are in control now 
don't you wait 
let life find a separate way 

find your way 

it's over now 
i've come to this 
there's a world out there 
for me to know 

it's time to go now 
don't you stay 
turn around when life puts you down 

you are in control now 
don't you wait 
let life find a separate way 

you are in control 

now
