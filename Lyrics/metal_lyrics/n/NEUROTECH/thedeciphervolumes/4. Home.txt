where is the price to pay 
for the life you've thrown away 
could you believe it is gone 

every word you say 
may never go away 
try to focus and listen 

i am what you are searching for 
i've got something to believe in 
i am the one you've been looking for 
i have something you are missing 

i tried to find it 
just can't believe it 
try to find my way home 
take me home 

home 

i am what you are searching for 
i've got something to believe in 
i am the one you've been looking for 
i have something you are missing 
take me home 

home
