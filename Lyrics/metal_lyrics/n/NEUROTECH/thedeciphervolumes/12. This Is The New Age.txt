waiting, searching 
holding unto life 

waiting, hoping 
time is on my side 

it's inevitable 
not to care 
when mind tells 
you are to blame 

for all the sickening 
the reckoning 
i feel the end is near 

this is the new age 
for us 

waiting, circling 
through the void of trust 

waiting, turning 
from all the noise and dust 

it was inevitable 
and I don't care 
it was just your mistake 

the sickening 
the reckoning 
i see the air is clear 

this is the new age 
for us 

after.. after... 

after this day 
the line of sight has reached 
beyond your way 
now you are safe 
from me 

this is the new age 

for us
