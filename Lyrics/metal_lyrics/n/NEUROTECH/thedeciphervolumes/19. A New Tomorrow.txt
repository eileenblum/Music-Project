Last chance of coming out, going away 
Last chance, I am going away 
Last chance of screaming loud â goodbye to this place 
The last pill you ever will take 

The road is a stranger now 
The fall dissolved the blame 
The road is a stranger now 
I hope it stays the same 

This must be the end of falling down 
Hold on to my hand â welcome tomorrow 
This must be the end of falling down 
Everything is in place for a new tomorrow 

Tear down the wall in your way 
Tear down the wall in your pain 
I am the last chance of coming out, going away 
The last pill you ever will taste 

The road is a stranger now 
The fall dissolved the blame 
The road is a stranger now 
And I hope it stays the same 

This must be the end of falling down 
Hold on to my hand â welcome tomorrow 
This must be the end of falling down 
Everything is in place for a new tomorrow 

Where do we go tomorrow ? 
The road is a stranger now, where do we go tomorrow ? 
The road is a stranger now, where do we go ? 
Where do we go ? 

This must be the end of falling down 
Hold on to my hand â welcome tomorrow 
This must be the end of falling down 
Everything is in place for a new tomorrow 

Towards a new tomorrow 
We go
