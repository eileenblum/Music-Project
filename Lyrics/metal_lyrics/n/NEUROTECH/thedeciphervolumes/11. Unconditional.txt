[feat. Tanja Ravljen]unconditional 

there's a message trapped inside my head 
wondering why i can't forget 
all the good 
all the bad 
words unsaid 

unconditional 

there's a message coming out of my chest 
ten thousand memories I have to repress 
all the good 
all the bad 
what's left unsaid ? 

unconditional 

love, 
was it same to you ? 
because right here, right now 
i wait 
thinking together 
but in the end we'll suffer forever 

suffer, forever 
in unconditional love 

we are one 
and we know it 
we are done 
but we know it 

when there is nowhere to go 
when you are losing control 
we are one 
and we know it 

when the message is told 
there is nothing but cold 
we are done 
but we know it 

we know it 

unconditional 

love, 
was it same to you ? 
because right here, right now 
i wait 
thinking together 
but in the end we'll suffer forever 

unconditional love
