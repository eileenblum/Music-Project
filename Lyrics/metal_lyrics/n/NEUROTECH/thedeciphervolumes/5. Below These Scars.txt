we were sentenced for this 
and for the time 
that took you 
took you away 

losing battles against the mind 
as you are searching yourself 
and hope for the better 
forget all that is left behind 

but no, 
we are going away 
a slightest fix could stop the pain 
nobody wants to feel this way 

i 
know who we are 
a morning star 
shines a light underneath 
below these scars 
but we don't have to be here 
don't have to stay here 
i want to know 
how far away from here 

know who we are 
when something begins 
there is something to end 
there is something to believe in 

but no, 
we are going away 
a slightest fix could stop the pain 
nobody wants to feel this way 

i 
know who we are 
a morning star 
shines a light underneath 
below these scars 
but we don't have to be here 
don't have to stay here 
i want to know 
how far away from here 

you know who we are 
well, i know who we are 
don't have to be here 
don't have to stay here 
i want to know 
can you ever forgive me 

just a like piece that needs some turning 
rolling into a perfect shape 
just like the leaves that keeps on falling 
finding shelter from the rain 

i 
know who we are 
a morning star 
shines a light underneath 
below these scars 
but we don't have to be here 
don't have to stay here 
i want to know 
how far away from here 

you know who we are 
well, i know who we are 
don't have to be here 
don't have to stay here 
i want to know 

can you ever forgive me
