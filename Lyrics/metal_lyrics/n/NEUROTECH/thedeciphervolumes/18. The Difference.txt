See the world through the eyes you can trust 
See the world through the mind while the past is blind 
See the world through the eyes you can trust 
See the world which reminds you what you have left behind 
You see the worst in the eyes you donât trust 
You see the worst in the mind that is not defined 
You see the worst in the eyes you donât trust 
You see the worst â a remainder what you have left behind 

This isnât about the difference anymore 
This time I will burn the picture and end it all 
This isnât about a different scenario 
No reason for this addiction, forget it all 

See the world covered with rust 
See the world coloured by your distrust 
See the world becoming unjust 
But you must, see the world with your heart - forget whatâs left behind 
You see the worst in the eyes you donât trust 
You see the worst in the mind that is not defined 
You see the worst in the eyes you donât trust 
But it is important just to let it all out 

It is important, just to let it all out 

This isnât about the difference anymore 
This time I will burn the picture and end it all 
This isnât about a different scenario 
No reason for this addiction, forget it all
