are you ready worm ? 

come on 

this is my favourite fairytale 
your gruesome, ugly nightmare 
do you know why things are wasted this way 
because your mindset is playing games 

last wave got me 
striking me down yet again 
last wave got me 
fucking me, again and again 
come on motherfucker 

lets go again 
again and again 
dig a hole 
and come to back me again 
slip away and live in your nightmare 
when damage is done 

your heart is beating in a straight line 
energetic, but willing to die 
can't stand this fucking human flesh 
so weak and so incompetent 

heartbeat in a straight line 

ego 

one more time 

last wave got me 
striking me down yet again 
last wave got me 
fucking me, again and again 
come on motherfucker 

but 
we'll go through this together 
we will survive together 
when damage is, when damage is done 
we will unite together 
we will do fine forever 
when damage is, when damage is done 

damage is done
