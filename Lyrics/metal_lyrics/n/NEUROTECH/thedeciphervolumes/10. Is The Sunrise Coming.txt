there's a new time coming 
there's not need for power to stay 

a new day is dawning 
i am ready for the separate way 

but, 

is the sunrise coming 
i wanted to know 
is the sunrise coming 
the question must go 

never felt anything like this before 
for another time 
for another day 
i have opened the door 

but, 

is the sunrise coming 
i wanted to know 
is the sunrise coming 
the question must go 

is the sunrise coming 
i wanted to know 
is the sunrise coming 
i beg you to go 

i beg you to go 

waiting, 
waiting for, 
a perfect sunrise 

is the sunrise coming 
is the sunrise coming 
is it finnaly coming to me ? 

is the sunrise coming 
i wanted to know 
is the sunrise coming 
the question must go 

is the sunrise coming 
i wanted to know 
is the sunrise coming 
i beg you to go 

i beg you to go
