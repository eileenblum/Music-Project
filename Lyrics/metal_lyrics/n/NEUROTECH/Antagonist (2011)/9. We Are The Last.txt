Farewell the world of misery
Paralyzed earth and sky above
Sensation to another perception
The need for another injection in self

Hail nothing
Inhale everything
Self dominance
Is that what you need

There's no hope for single individual
No hope for this indifferent souls
No hope for the future
Cause we are the last
We are the last

Worthless mind economy
Laughable autonomy
Rapture in providence
Inherited predominance

Hail nothing
Inhale everything
Self dominance
Is that what you need

There's no hope for single individual
No hope for this indifferent souls
No hope for the future
Cause we are the last
We are the last

We are the last

Reflecting Light in memory
Fading long-lost harmony
We lost all our control
Yes world - We heard it before

Hail nothing
Inhale everything
Self dominance
Is that what you need

There's no hope for single individual
No hope for this indifferent souls
No hope for the future
Cause we are the last
We are the last
