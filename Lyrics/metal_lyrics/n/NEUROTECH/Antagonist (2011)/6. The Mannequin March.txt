An opponent within
Can't tell the state I am in
Paralyzed my sense to feel connected

Now it's out of control
Keep begging for more
How much can you take
From already blurred mind

My inner ear is deaf
What are you saying ?

This is conscience function failure
Enwrapped in mannequin march
Wasted cells to feel alive
Drugged up till you're left to die

Join the mannequin march
Or you will feel dead
Erase leftover emotions - Stuck in your head

My inner ear is deaf
What are you saying ?

This is conscience function failure
Enwrapped in mannequin march
Wasted cells to feel alive
Drugged up till you're left to die
