We find obstructions in the road - Up ahead
Some of us will have to see it
Others know what is going on

Vast differences created
In modern blockage of the mind
Visions colorated
Emptiness is the new word
For perfection to be found

How you can expect to see it
How you can expect to believe it
When all you do is turn your back

To know the world you feel
Without - Without turning around
You have to breath and see
The sky is always open

With global disaffection
Individual Rejection
Helpless - Searching for the answer
Nobody knows what is going on
Will perfection ever be found

Without - Without turning around
You have to breath and see
The sky is always open
To know the world you feel
Without - Without turning around
You have to breath and see
The sky is always open

How you can expect to see it
How you can expect to believe it
When all you do is turn your back

To know the world you feel
Without - Without turning around
You have to breath and see
The sky is always open
To know the world you feel
Without - Without turning around
You have to breath and see
The sky is always open
