Without compassion
Without sincere regrets
We crave

In long and longer days of repent
The curtain is down
Only hate remains
Day by day we struggle in hollow
Never wanted - Another tomorrow at all

What you are and what will you be
My answer to your question
This is the real me
Coming out - Facing suppression
Antagonist - Filled with depression

Sometimes - We are joined together
A brief time of light
Never needed - Never wanted
The outdoors hates us
Wants to divide us

Wants to divide us

What you are and what will you be
My answer to your question
This is the real me
Coming out - Facing suppression
Antagonist - Filled with depression
What you are and what will you be
Your state of perception
This is the real me
Coming out - Facing suppression
Undertaker without an exception

Antagonist

Let go, your soul
To world inferno
Let go, your soul
It's inevitable

I always wanted to be like you
But now I realize
You are the worst part of me

What you are and what will you be
My answer to your question
This is the real me
Coming out - Facing suppression
Antagonist - Filled with depression
What you are and what will you be
Your state of perception
This is the real me
Coming out - Facing Suppression
Undertaker without an exception
