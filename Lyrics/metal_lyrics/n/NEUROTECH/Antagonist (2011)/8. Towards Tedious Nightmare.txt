Still we ride

Still we ride

(With no meaning, we grow cold)

Wasted days - Beyond recognition
In the times of the fall
Long steps towards second beginning
If the goal - Has no meaning at all

With no meaning at all

Still we ride towards tedious nightmare
Corrupt emotional wage
Cold incision - To spark the needs to remain
No hope in veins

Wasted years through change and repression
While the towers fall
Decadence reveals the illusion
Behind plastic face - We grow cold

We grow cold

Still we ride towards tedious nightmare
Corrupt emotional wage
Cold incision - To spark the needs to remain
No hope in veins

Still we ride

Still we ride

Over and over
In search for the cover
From the oceans away
From hypocritical lover
I'm your friend - Until the end
We are sinking
We are sinking

(With no meaning, we grow cold)

Still we ride towards tedious nightmare
Corrupt emotional wage
Cold incision - To spark the needs to remain
No hope in veins

Still we ride

Still we ride
