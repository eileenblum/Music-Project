Who is to blame - When you figure out nothing
Who is to blame - When you realize what you become
Own cancer - Arch nemesis
Strip down your skin and your flesh

Avoid the policy - Inhale the heresy
Kneel down and tell us what you see
The avoidable truth - The acceptable lie
Exhale and join the angst zeit

Why don't they hurt you ?
Why don't they murder you ?

I don't wanna hear - I don't wanna see
This is the angst zeit
Brake it and leave it
I don't wanna love - I don't wanna hate
This is the angst zeit
Leave me alone

Another seizure - For another meaning
Our time to adopt your flesh
Stone cold our heart shapes
Dissolvess the body and the mind

No reason - For my being
Keep your eyes closed
The avoidable truth - The acceptable lie
Exhale and join the angst zeit

Why don't they murder you ?

I don't wanna hear - I don't wanna see
This is the angst zeit
Brake it and leave it
I don't wanna love - I don't wanna hate
This is the angst zeit
Leave me alone
I don't wanna live - I don't wanna be
This is the angst zeit
Brake it and leave it
I don't wanna love - I don't wanna hate
This is the angst zeit
Take me out of this place

Look away - Cause I am nothing
But i'll take your precious everything

I don't wanna hear - I don't wanna see
This is the angst zeit
Brake it and leave it
I don't wanna love - I don't wanna hate
This is the angst zeit
Leave me alone
I don't wanna live - I don't wanna be
This is the angst zeit
Brake it and leave it
I don't wanna love - I don't wanna hate
This is the angst zeit
Take me out of this place
