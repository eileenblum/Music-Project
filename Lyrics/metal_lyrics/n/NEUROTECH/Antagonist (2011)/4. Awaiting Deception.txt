Reenacting the sequence
Dissolving the past
Selecting images
And erasing them from my chest

Wrong sign can cast a straight line
Wrong time can last a lifetime

We are seconds from the end
(And) Still I am waiting for
Awaiting for your deception
With drowned memories and everything we wished for
Awaiting for your deception

When mind betrays you
With self-inflicting tricks
Let it do the harm
And take control you will never get it back
No more

Wrong time can last a lifetime

We are seconds from the end
(And) Still I am waiting for
Awaiting for your deception
With drowned memories and everything we wished for
Awaiting for your deception

Awaiting for your deception

Awaiting for your deception

Awaiting

No-one to trust to
No-one forgives you
This pale surrounding
Finally showed the truth
That you are dead
That you are dead
Without control in your head

Wrong time can last a lifetime

We are seconds from the end
(And) Still I am waiting for
Awaiting for your deception
With drowned memories and everything we wished for
Awaiting for your deception

Awaiting for your deception

Awaiting for your deception
