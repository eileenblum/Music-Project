Hollow - Hollow

Exposed in causality
Path unclear
Distorted reality
Wrapped in fear

Bypass my sanity
For the sake of myself

What can you feel in it
Is it real
Can you dream of it
In color and sound
Hollow impression
Is bound to be found

Helpless in cage within
Uncontrolled agony
Wonder why it feels this way
All is fake

For the sake of myself

What can you feel in it
Is it real
Can you dream of it
In color and sound
Hollow impression
Is bound to be found

Hollow - Hollow

Hollow is the life we lead
In search for serenity

Bypass my sanity
For the sake of myself

What can you feel in it
Is it real
Can you dream of it
In color and sound
Hollow impression
Is bound to be found

Hollow - Hollow
