We will never

This is the time - To relive the illusion
This is the step you've taken and don't really know
The last chance to realize nightmare
Cause life goes always the wrong way

We will never
We will never
We will never - Never exist anyway
With constant bullshit that your fucking mind controls
We will never - Never exist anyway

This is the time - To praise the illusion
Shapeless form of the new age identity
Perfect feature for residual[?] prey
Cause life goes always the wrong way

We will never
We will never
We will never - Never exist anyway
With constant bullshit that your fucking mind controls
We will never - Never exist anyway

No mother-fucking way !

You are alive for
Something you'll die for
But you will never - Never exist anyway

We will never

Last chance to gain the illusion
Helpless form of stone cold flesh
Surrounded by people but there's no-one around
Trust is bent, cause you are fucked - Over and over again

Over and over again

We will never
We will never
We will never - Never exist anyway
With constant bullshit that your fucking mind controls
We will never - Never exist anyway

No mother-fucking way !
