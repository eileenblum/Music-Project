[Music &amp; lyrics by Wulf]

There is always summer
And autumn
After winter and spring
Seasons drift away
And I wish I could
Meet you now

I think we could feel now
As the world keeps changing
There are changes within
Keep these thoughts at bay
So you won't fall into pieces
Again

The world has changed us
And nothing could
Ever save us from this
It's all up to us

The world may break us
But some things
Will never change
What we share
It's all up to us
