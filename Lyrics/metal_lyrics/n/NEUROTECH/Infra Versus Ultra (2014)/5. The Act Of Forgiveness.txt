[Music &amp; lyrics by Wulf]

I am waiting for it
I am so close
I am waiting for the rain
To change my shade
Of colour

I'm asking
What's killing me,
What's killing you?
These thoughts
Are here to stay
Unless, unless we
Are forgiven
What's killing me,
What's killing you?
Our minds
Are our only escape
At last, at last we
Are forgiven

I am waiting for rain
I am so close,
Yet so far from here
I am waiting for the day
To change the shape
Of my heart

The road has come
To an end
It's time to depart

Take it easy
