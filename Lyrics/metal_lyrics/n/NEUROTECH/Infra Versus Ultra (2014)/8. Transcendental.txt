[Music &amp; lyrics by Wulf]

Fast forward to the future
Where nothing survives
Handhold to the meaning
Where nothing can hide now
Pick yourself as you were
Programmed to function
Before you are thrown
Into arms of desperation

Have you turned
Inwards today
Have you faced
Yourself today
Have you hurt
Yourself today

Let's go
Let's hide away, for awhile
Let's just hide away,
Where no one knows
Where we are
Someplace far away
Where I promise you,
You will never
Feel alone again

And no one knows
Where you are
No one knows
Where you are
No one

Pick yourself
So no one can find you
Pick yourself
So no one can betray you
You yourself are
A product of premonition
So you are not thrown
Into arms of separation
