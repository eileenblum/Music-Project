[Music &amp; lyrics by Wulf]

Inside a revolving door

We ride

Our presences collide
Are we just driven by faith
Or blind chance
Unpredictable, illogical
Are we just filling the gap
In our empty lives
Transitioning into unified

But in the mist of confusion
I still wish you would
Hold me close
When we are gone
And there is nothing
Left to save
Unleashing the dead
Who believe in each other
When we are gone
And there is no more
Words to say
Unleashing the dead
Who believe in one another

And I believe in me right now

Inside an evolving core

We hide

Our presences unite
Are we just moving in waves,
yet standstill
In the wrong place
Against our own will
Are we just spending
The years trying to forget
The true essence
Of truth and lies

There is only
Pain in confusion
I wish you would let me go

Hold

Let me go
