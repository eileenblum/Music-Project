[Music &amp; lyrics by Wulf]

Cover me with
The shape of yours
Colour me with
Each shade of yours
When the night falls
And you feel cold inside
When the night falls
And you feel petrified

Fractured senses
Purify
All the shattered memories
By my side
Unknown weakness
Dwells within
Just empty spaces
For emotional spin
Welcome to the absence
Why does it feel this way?
Welcome to the absence
When you are alone again
Welcome the absence
Shadows still remain
Welcome the absence

Absence
Cover me with
The shape of yours

Colour me with
Each shade of yours
When the night falls
And you feel cold inside
When the night falls
And you feel petrified
When the night falls

Is something falling from me
Or from ourselves

The escapist carries on
While the distant future
Could not be seen
Just empty spaces
Where we can come clean

Welcome to the absence
How do you feel today?
Welcome to the absence
Is it just same old sh*t again?
Welcome to the absence
Is there any hope left
To remain?
Welcome to the absence

Absence
