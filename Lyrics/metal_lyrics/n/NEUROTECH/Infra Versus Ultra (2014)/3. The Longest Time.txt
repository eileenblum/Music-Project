[Music &amp; lyrics by Wulf]

Come along
Through the longest time
I remember the time when
dreams were no retreat at all

I remember the time when
vision of the future
didn't fade

But still I deny the truth
- there ain't nothing that
will remain

And still I deny the dreams
- there ain't nothing
we can't change

'Cause everything changes
I've waited for
the longest time
To let go

I don't know, I'm not sure
Can you hear me breathing

I've waited for
the longest time
To move on

I don't know, I'm not sure
Can you hear me breathing

I remember the time when
colours didn't look so grey

I remember the time when
fear meant nothing,
now it's pouring inside of me

Through the time
of bleeding,
through the time
of searching
Through the time of healing,
for the sake of feeling
Can you hear me breathing

Everything changes
