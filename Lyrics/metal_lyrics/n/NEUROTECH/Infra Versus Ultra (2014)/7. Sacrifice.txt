[Music &amp; lyrics by Wulf]

We walked through
The darkest path
No more innocence,
It's gone
Forever gone
We played the cards
Until we suffered
There's no more room
For more of this play
The loss of time and
Emotions we encountered
There is nothing more,
Nothing left to gain

Don't fail me now
As I've failed you then
This is the sacrifice
We must make
Please don't fail me now
As I've failed you then
This is the sacrifice
We must make
Laying down in the dark
without power

Cast a shadow on all
That we maintained
Observe the values,
The promises and claims

Behind the negative,
Only negative remains
Observe the cause
And effect and relive it
There is so much fear
Left in this
Erase the pattern
And there's nothing
Left to face
And remember what
You give is what you take

Sacrifice we must make

You and I

Sacrifice
