I see you denying everything that you heard me say
And when I pry you just tell me to go the hell away
This cycle started off slowly, but now it's getting
Faster and faster and faster and faster and faster

Oh no

My voice is unheard by your ears
If you can't hear me: You're alone

Don't expect me to listen
I said, don't expect me to listen if you won't do the same for me

Don't think I could say sorry with some sincerity
I would expect the same exact thing from this family
But when you do, it's fake
And I know why
You never really could when I looked you in the eye
I figured you forgot instead of telling me a lie
Me a lie

When it's over
You could be what you want again
When it's over
You will be free
So get it over with now

I know your reputation and image is always at stake
Oh, trust me that God Himself will judge thee
Rightfully, painfully, shamefully in front of the gates
It will be a massacre when you're awake

If you ate your words, you'd have no room to breathe
I don't believe in the choices that you've given me
But I don't really mind, I don't really mind

Trust in me
Believe
That everyone will find your thank-yous and apologies all a lie
Oh, I don't agree with the choices that you've given me
But I don't really mind
I don't really mind, oh

I know your reputation and image is always at stake
Oh, trust me that God Himself will judge thee
Rightfully, painfully, shamefully in front of the gates
It will be a massacre when you're awake
