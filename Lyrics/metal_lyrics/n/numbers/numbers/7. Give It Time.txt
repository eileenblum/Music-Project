Where were you?
This world is taken from the thoughts of every man that's felt alone, alone

Nothing was there
Nothing was clear
And the madman I believed in would not lend me his ear
So let's rewind this a bit
And take it back to how it all began

Once upon a time
There was a boy all alone in the woods (all alone in the woods)
A lonely man desperately said,
"Boy, join me for there's danger ahead"
So they both decide that together they'll hide
From the monsters of their world

The boy had cried, "What danger's inside?"
The man said, "All my pain, my blood, sweat, tears," oh!

So he ran, ran from the man
Only to find himself lost again
So he ran

Don't tell me that there is nothing wrong
When all they ever did for me
Was use and abuse
I refuse to let them think they wrote this song
I refuse to let them think they wrote this song
