Burn them down
These bridges you've built with ignorance
Boy, I tell you to step away
And realize that this one is a devil
She's a devil
Oh, I guess that you could call it fate
This never-ending process where you collate
From ways that you've been treated
Through the history of being defeated (yeah)

So get up, get out of this mess she made you clean up
I know, I know that she's taken everything
She's like ice on fire:
She's hot from a distance but cold to the touch
Burning the skin as she gets too close
Freezing your heart as she touches your soul

Welcome to this dark conundrum of a man
Where demons rule the mind and the surrounding land
They come and go as they please
Puppeteering elbows and knees
That must make her the queen (oh yeah)

I thought that you were made of gold
As if your facade never got old

So get up, get out of this mess she made you clean up
I know, I know that she's taken everything
She's like ice on fire:
She's hot from a distance but cold to the touch
Burning the skin as she gets too close
Freezing your heart as she touches your soul

Oh, when the time comes around
She'll make you bleed from your neck on down
As she waits for your blood to dry
She'll whisper in your ear as you die,
"You can't leave
Remember, it's you and me together
You can't leave
Remember, it's you and me forever"

Now I'm lying down with my palms to my face
Keeping warm with this blanket of shame
If only you could see me like this
I'd like to shine your teeth with my fist
Fist!

So get up, get out of this mess she made you clean up
I know, I know that she's taken everything
She's like ice on fire:
She's hot from a distance but cold to the touch
Burning the skin as she gets too close
Freezing your heart as she touches your soul
