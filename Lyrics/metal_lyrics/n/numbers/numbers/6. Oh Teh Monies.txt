You won't make it out alive!
Unless you realize what's controlling you
But the urge, it's poison
The darkness in your heart will haunt you

This world will eat you from the inside out
Like all of the rest of us
We think we're in control, no doubt

I never saw it coming
I fell to pieces

You want to know how being addicted to you feels?
Like knives pressing and pressing
Cuts me from my waist to my heart, tears me apart
When the urge to succumb consumes my heart

This world will eat you
From the inside out
Like all of the rest of us
We think we're in control, no doubt

I never saw it coming
I fell to pieces
She dropped me from the sky and said,
"Welcome to Neverland"

Love, oh I've chosen love
I'll tear my own heart open to drain it of you

Oh, I do not remember telling myself I have wasted time
I wasted life

Oh please, ladies and gentlemen a round of applause for me
At least, a slap to the face or a kick to make me believe

Hello, my darling you know me too well
I don't even know myself
You don't even care at all

I never saw it coming
I fell to pieces
She dropped me from the sky and said,
"Welcome to Neverland"
