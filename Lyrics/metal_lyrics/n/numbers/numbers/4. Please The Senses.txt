The weight
It wears me down

Every time I fake a smile I find that I'll eventually explode

Blame me not for what I am
Or what I have become

I swear that there is more to life than this
I chose the door that's chained and often missed
If you trace it back to when the stage was set
You will find that you were blind to your regret

Break!
Let the ground be uprooted
Wake!
Light it up, burn it down, stomp it out
This is the moment
Rid your mind of doubt

I'll admit that I was a coward
And my mind was weak and diseased
But don't expect me to stay
I'll carve my own path and I'll find my own way

We are the cogs in the machine
And we all keep it turning
The way we work is our demise
But the wick will keep on burning
We are the cogs in the machine
And we all keep it turning
The way we work is our demise
But the wick will keep on burning

Whether it's the man upstairs, or the man at his desk
I am the one being pushed around
Alone among the sheep that could never
Shake the ground

It's the only way you'll move these mountains
That shake the ground

So be the one that shakes the ground
It's the only way you'll move these mountains
