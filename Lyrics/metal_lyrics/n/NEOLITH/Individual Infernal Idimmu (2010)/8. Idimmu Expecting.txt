In the void my eyes sleep
In nothingness I dwell
Black god in leather I am
The one and the none
Zi am I?
Of arra am I?
Nay! Idimmu I am!
Zi dingir kia kanpa!
May my sight frighten you!
May my words deafen you!
May my breath suffocate you!
Zi dingir kia kanpa!
Purest sand in my hand
No beginning thus no end
Black-eyed angel with a chain
After storm comes the rain
Rise up, by fright summon me!
Rise up, by misery summon me!
Rise up, by loneliness summon me!
I shall bring you yet unknown
Have no thoughts have no weakness
Voice your screams
Let me speak let me preach
This new gospel  the only truth
Beware I rise!

For a considerable amount of time it was literally believed that Christ had a brother.
Human brother.
This is, naturally of Christian tradition.
The original charm comes from a totally different source.
The verses of Necronomicon, being deliberately changed and naming Nazarene becomes more abstract, confusing and misleading.
As all religious beliefs are to me.
