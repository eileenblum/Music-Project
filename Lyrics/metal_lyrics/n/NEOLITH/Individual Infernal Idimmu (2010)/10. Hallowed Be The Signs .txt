It is true
What many of you have heard
Azag is praying
Listening to the wind
And as I speak
He is opposing idimmu
Fear not!
Our homes sleep safe
For the signs protect us!
Arra reminds non-eyed
Dust is harmless and bare
Agga brings peace
To dead but dreaming
Bandar makes us bow
And have faith in blackness
I stand truthfully unafraid
I have the sight now
They smile to us
Kia mass ssaratu
