Zero
As above it continuum
Zero
So below it shapeless lava
Zero
Sealed lips for the starving
Zero
Hoax of the knowing
Limes inferior
Picture of perfection in mirror
Reflecting vicious marks of hide and seek
Limes inferior
I left and get downed to hide
I am the wizard condemned
I transport you to brave new world
I fix the justice machine
Limes inferior
Shadows pray to have enough
And  you stay hand cuffed
Zero
Every truth is a hoax
Zero
Waste not so much strength
Zero
Bury the key
Zero
Bury yourself

One of the most intriguing theories concerning Christ's death, based upon serious and thorough studies says it is very probable Christ survived his crucifixion as he seemed too important to die at the time and thus he was replaced by some other man, quite possibly known to Christ himself.
Princeless knowledge can be obtained from the Qumran scrolls. But can it really?
