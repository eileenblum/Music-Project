all the dead and gone have seen the shining in her eyes
resisting, tempting cries
from within the maze of time
the journeys carried on
pass the burden of their lives
all the doomed and all the gone
will know the shining in her eyes
soon the stars will fall and fade
and the dust will clog our mouths
through the mirage of our days
through the dreams of loss and peace
the murmurs of the dead
and whispers of the gone
all the night light lives
we speak to she
the gatherer of souls
through the lighthouse of her eyes
