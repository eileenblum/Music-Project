i was born free and free i will die
i never kneel before any god
i was cursed
but the one who cursed me
died on the cross
within my world
within my dark paradise
there's no place for the other gods, but me
i am the hermit
who steps only his own paths
my life - my hatred! my hate!
i want to die in solitude
as someone cursed and forgotten
in open nature
she give me life in this world
among the whispering forest
i want to go back
where i came from
i begin my eternal dream
the time that goes back
and this breath of centuries
ally my life coming true...
