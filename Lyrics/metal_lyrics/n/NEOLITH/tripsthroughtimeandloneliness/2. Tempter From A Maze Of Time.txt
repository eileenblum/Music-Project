come in my arms
the arms of eternity
I'll show you all
time will be flowing through us
like through waterless river
we'll float to stars
that missed their celestial ways
towards the hundreds of thousands years
you'll never understand may be
what is the truth about death
and what this phenomenon signs
look down! yes, down!
you will be next!
there is no prayer to save you
from chaos we emerged
from the vast absurdity
and there we'll come back
to wait for millennium of evil
so spent like the candle's light
you'll remain with me
even you failed to notice
that we passed the gate
of the way with no return
wait then for renascence!
