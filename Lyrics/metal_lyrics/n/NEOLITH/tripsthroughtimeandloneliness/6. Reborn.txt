In the depths of the tomb, the darkness
the piercing cold
the blissful silence - heralds the peace
no sound of wind, no waves roaring
only the sound of the abyss breathing
your troubles are in the past now
you took all your secrets to the grave
you're free from sadness and tears
you relieved your soul
here you'll be free and safe
the dead are silent - at last you'll be happy
the other side is waiting for you
and will offer you all the charm
reborn again
in the land of shadows and darkness
at last you're your own lord and master
and you can play according to your own rules
