I'm wanted
cursed and hunted
left alone
I'm trapped
bruised and scarred
left alone
I'm neglected
lost and rejected
left alone
I'm going insane
pain drills my brain
left alone
you are bound to suffer in this life of yours
and won't find your peace of mind until
you die
suicide my child seems the only way out
almighty death is the only relief
I'm satisfied
calm and tranquil
left alone
I'm on my own
careless and done
left alone
I'm satisfied
I'm sacrificed
left alone
your earthly deed is done and completed
step into the light that will set you free
step into unknown, endless and eternal
tempting you and scarring like a sin.
