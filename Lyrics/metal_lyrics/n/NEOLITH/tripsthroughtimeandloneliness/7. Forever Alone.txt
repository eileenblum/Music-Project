often in my dreams
i can see myself
climbin' towards the stars
i can feel like millions of them are watchin' me
but i will never reach them
i will remain forever alone
i often back to the places
where my past and future dwell
where my dreams and fears hide
untouched by sunbeam
unspoiled in twilight
where there's nothing but me
forever alone
i return to the places
where my love exist and dies in vain
don't fade away my goddess
my life seems to be just a dream
and there's no voice whispering my name
i will remain forever alone
