i raise my hands up high
i call thee my lord
whenever you are, come to me!
come on!
my time is coming!
soon i will pass into oblivion
like a withered leave carried away by wind
my life will be over
the life that was one great sorrow
neverending torment
for which the end is coming
master - i give you my tears
for you to see how i suffer
but you can do nothing
you are as weak as i am
like a withered leave
