Raging with madness, crushing Shumer
The death-dealing storm making its way
By breach of a vow Councils collide
By weapons of terror consciences deprived.
Evil is Wind that keeps spitting with fire
Furious are Makers, against us conspire
Blood covenant protecting no more
Cruel beginning of mistaken lore
Forwards to darkness, embrace us with hate
Invoke all the demons, doomed is our fate!
Secrets through visions to chosen remain
Nothing but pity for us to obtain
Yes there's shred of hope for future to be
Destruction so total bred calamity
What dead left was shall not be forgotten
In sadness of power blindly begotten
Breed us!
Guide us!
Bless us!
Kill us!
Evil is Wind that keeps spitting with fire
Furious are Makers, against us conspire
Blood covenant protecting no more
Cruel beginning of mistaken lore
Breed us!
Guide us!
Bless us!
Kill us!
