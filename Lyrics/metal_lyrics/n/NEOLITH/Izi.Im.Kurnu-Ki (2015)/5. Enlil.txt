In my Lord En-Ki
Understanding I seek
As with a heavy heart
I shamefully weep
Upon the unsealed tomb being afire
Final resting place that once was my realm
I stand and breath
Inferno inhale
We angered our Gods, enraged Sons of the Sun
And Theirs was the weapon seeding madness
On the velvet of clouds brought by the Sons of Anu
Nibirian Compeers evolving to all but divine
To be the Powers that be
I beg for Thy mercy omniscient eternal Asaredu
Creator of the spiral winding my destiny
Guide Enlil the Mighty to abstain
The One who wishes to chasten us
by calamitous wind
In daylight for the fall into infinite night
The wind is howling,
death with its stench
permeates all that Thou once deeply loved
Thy ground,
home of life was declared.
Nippur is dying! [2x]
Unto Gods of Nibiru we pray for compassion
Forbid me to yell: Enlil - Ilu assaku!
En-Ki! Sarru!
Have mercy on us!
As we are Thy children,
From crying and pain
to bliss
Thou guided us
En-Ki!
Asaredu!
Unmanu!
En-Ki!
