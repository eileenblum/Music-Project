My father in darkness lurking thou art
In sorrow and sadness dreaming of light
My lord and my master who seeks for disgust
Feast on my sins in thee I shall trust
Touch my lips with the boldness and hate
Poison my heart and spit through my veins
I need thy perfection, thy merciless sight
Saliva I spit shines black as the night
My father...take the blood
My father...and eat filthy my father...
Take the blood and my flesh
Take the blood and eat filthy my flesh
My father in darkness lurking thou art
In cry and despair dreaming of light
My lord and my saviour who seeks for disgust
Feast of divine in thee I shall trust
My father...take the blood
My father...and eat filthy my flesh
Empyrean hails the bearer of truth
Allow me to speak for the brethren I am
Invoke condemned souls
Deities that sleep
Awaken the star
Who fell onto the rocks
Follow thy way
to the light of blind
My father in darkness awakened thou art
With courage and horror protecting the night
My lord and my saviour, destined to scorn
Feast on me traitor for thee I was born.
