I can't remember anything
I've lost my past somewhere
It can't be called back already
With the eyes of my memory
Between sorrow and pain
I can feel that I stand on the edge
Darkness unpenetrated fills the abyss under my feet
I stand naked in the darkness
No courtain between me
And fire circle of which I am the centre
I want to burn like I did before centuries
Pagan kings
I am the one of them as well
The Last One of The Great!
I want go back into the fire
I want to bow to the Greatest Ones
Only to the Greatest...
Life... Death... Wind... Fire... Water...
Me...
