The smoke is flying above their hands
Gathered around the great fire
They sing the song of hatred
Here I am crucified
I watch them with fear
Am I to be their victim
But why me?
Destiny...
My heart is bleeding
I burn in lies
I'm choking with hate
Like in chaotic dance
I'd like to touch the sky - but I can't
Lines of the song flow
Chining together with the wind
My journey to the stars ends...
Here I come...
