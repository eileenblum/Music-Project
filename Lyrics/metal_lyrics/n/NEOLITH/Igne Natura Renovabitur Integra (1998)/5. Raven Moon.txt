My lips touch the night
Thoughts drifting among the shadows
Moonlight lights the way
To my dreamland
I guess many days have passed?
I can't remember...
Days that bring sorrow and saving joy are gone
Living the kiss of night
I found my peace in it
Every night among thousand candles
I'm sailing the verses of my favourite dreams
and spectral pictures
I'm drifting among the roots of books unknown
and nameless
Ravens sing with screams of ghostly shadows
Leaving the kiss of night
