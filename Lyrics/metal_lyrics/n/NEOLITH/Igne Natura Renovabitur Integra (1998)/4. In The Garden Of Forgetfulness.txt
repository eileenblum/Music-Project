I'd like to touch my words
Feel the breath of my thoughts
Strip down my deepest desire
Before my eyes
My sweet blasphemies
I want to abandon blindmans rags
Who stumbles in his dark, cursed prayer
Wake up sleeping sins
And love that I have never experienced
I step on the path
Mystic and yet undiscovered
I pick up flowers
In the garden of forgetfulness
I open up my eyes and I can see...
I can see the light
I been waiting for all my life
So many years
I can see the sun
In the middle of the night
My eyes have seen to many sufferings
Millions of lies
Flowing like a river of blood
From god's mouth
