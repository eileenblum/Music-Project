My god promised me the paradise
But for what price?
All my life I am to carry his cross
To grieve, to weep, to kneel before him
I am to be one of his faithful servants
To pay homage, to offer sacrifices
And when he wishes it to die in his honour
For his glory, in his name
No!!! Never!!!
I stand out against god, I break the cross
The symbol of his victory over the evil
I renounce believing him
My faith which restricts my freedom and kills me slowly
Now that I am free from the lethal traps
Of this senseless faith
I can see how the others suffer
Blind and deaf puppets
As if in drugged trans
Unlimitely devoted to god
They die every day in ignorance, in darkness
I trusted in god - and what did I gained
Permanent insults, fear and humiliation
Treating me like a dog!
I hate thee god!
