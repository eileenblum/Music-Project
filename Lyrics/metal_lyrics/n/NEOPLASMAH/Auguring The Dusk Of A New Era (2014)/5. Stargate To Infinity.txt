Ablaze with light it began
Holding a promised equilibrium

Chaos lurking inside
As particles divide
And collide in an endless cycle
A phoenix universe reborn and re-baptized
Leaving behind an eternal trail of black light

Stargate to infinity
An effigy to human endings
The stargate to infinity
Ever revealed before our mind's eye

Cosmic and human time begin and end in fire
Ever repeated in endless cycles
Entropy coiled with every conflagration
Order restored after each creation

Stargate to infinity
An effigy to human endings
The stargate to infinity
Revealed before our mind's eye

Our spiritual godless existence
Erased as the universe warps and inflates
Through time all matter is vanquished
From human endings to cosmic beginnings

Stargate to infinity
An effigy to human endings
The stargate to infinity
Ever revealed before our mind's eye

Cosmic and human time begin and end in fire
Ever repeated in endless cycles
Entropy coiled with every conflagration
Order restored after each creation

Stargate to infinity
An effigy to human endings
The stargate to infinity
Revealed before our mind's eye
