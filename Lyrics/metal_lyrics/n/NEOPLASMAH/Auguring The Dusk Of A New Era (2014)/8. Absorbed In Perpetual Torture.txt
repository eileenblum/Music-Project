In sight of the unfold of the prophecies
On which human faith feeds and fails
Allured by intense hallucination
Engulfed in the black void
(We) Collapse in madness!

As entering the black gates of torment
In search of the absolute wisdom
(There is) No time, no space, only memories
Of the experience of reality

Absorbed in perpetual torture

The slow effects of sensory impoverishment
Subtle as phantoms, but so destructive
Dimming the light of humanity
The universe prevailsâ¦

(We) Collapse in madness!

As entering the black gates of torment
In search of the absolute wisdom
(There is) No time, no space, only memories
Of the experience of reality

Absorbed in perpetual torture
