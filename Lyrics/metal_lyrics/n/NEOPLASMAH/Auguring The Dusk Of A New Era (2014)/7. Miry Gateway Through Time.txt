A slimy trail of rottenness
Spouting through an open wound
On the very bottom of seas
Spreading a downwards route
Across the Earth's crust
A miry gateway through time

Seeking all above
Treacherous predators
Unleashed into the oceans

An underground asylum
Of a pre-historic waterworld
Buried by thousands and thousands
Of years of evolution
Unleashing a turmoil of voracious fiends

Seeking all above
Treacherous predators
Unleashed into the oceans

Old Father Neptune swirls in mute wrath
Grazzing at the immensity of his Domain
Underwater forest of divine creation
Engulfed by the gree of the disemtombed demons

Seeking all above
Treacherous predators
Unleashed into the oceans

Seeking all above
Treacherous predators
Unleashed into the oceans

A slimy trail of rottenness
Spouting through an open wound
On the very bottom of seas
Spreading a downwards route
Across the Earth's crust
A miry gateway through time

Seeking all above
Treacherous predators
Unleashed into the oceans
