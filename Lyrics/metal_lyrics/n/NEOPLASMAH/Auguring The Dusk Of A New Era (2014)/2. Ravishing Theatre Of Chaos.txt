Optical magic effects
Impossible to be related
Distorted sceneries
Aggregated stars

Crystalline darkness with empty light reflexes
Pushing souls to depths of infinity
Impulses taking us to higher velocities
Crossing barriers of atomic energy

Crystalline darkness with empty light reflexes
Pushing souls to depths of infinity
Impulses taking us to higher velocities
Crossing barriers of atomic energy

Material density, fields of opposite forces
Gravitational curvatures, ravishing chaos

A thousand information
Arriving from light-years away
Dynamic whisperings, adjusted
Strong but even more complex

Ravishing theatre of chaos

No limits for optical modifications
Extremities of cosmos can fusion themselves
Closer stars rushing before our eyes
Disappearing of visual fields

Ravishing theatre of chaos

Distorted sceneries
Aggregated... Stars!
