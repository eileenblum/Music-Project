While we're wandering on this Earth
Unaware of past fears and past regrets
A labyrinth of visions (is) unveiled before us
As portals disrupt this time-space continuum

Relive...
...Atrocities for eternity
Echoes of humanity's dreadful acts and times

Ghosts of past wars haunt our daydreams
As portals are one by one open wide
We travel into our deepest horrors
Leaving no trace or trail behind

Relive...
...Atrocities for eternity
Echoes of humanity's dreadful acts and times

Realm of the lost souls
Seeds of hate

Immortality in the garden of lost souls
An inaccessible path back to daylight
Lost in a cosmic kingdom of chaos
(Where) oblivion is the solstice of illusion

Realm of the lost souls
Seeds of hate

Relive...
...Atrocities for eternity
Echoes of humanity's dreadful acts and times

Inaccessible...no return to reality!
