Waves of damnation surround us
From all sources of evil
Coming from all sides
The most wicked of all is within our souls

Liberating darkness shall come
To make them perish
Through the all-seeing eye of Gaya
Mother of torment
Her cries shall echo
Throughout the universe

Pandemic horror
Ruins of a Sham Empire

Liberating darkness shall come
To make them perish
Through the all-seeing eye of Gaya
Mother of torment
Her cries shall echo
Throughout the universe

In thrall of their own delusion
A harsh birth engraved by eternity
Forged by the flames of time
Ruined by its own delirious wits

Pandemic horror
Ruins of a Sham Empire

Liberating darkness shall come
To make them perish
Through the all-seeing eye of Gaya
Mother of torment
Her cries shall echo
Throughout the universe
