Storm vortices of Neoplasmah!

Penetrating through the outer layers of magnetosphere
Concealing powerful hordes
Of a tenuous overwhelming plasma
Exerting its power

As the sun erupts
At the eleventh year of the solar cycle

Auroral ending of Earth
Pushed by the streaming solar wind
Into a non-trapping orbit
Drifting into interplanetary space

The dark side of the moon revealed
For eyes not human to see

Exerting its power...Power!
Magnetic storm

Auroral ending of Earth
Pushed by the streaming solar wind
Into a non-trapping orbit
Drifting into interplanetary space

The dark side of the moon revealed
For eyes not human to see

Exerting its power...Power!
Magnetic storm

Auroral ending of Earth
Pushed by the streaming solar wind
Into a non-trapping orbit
Drifting into interplanetary space

Storm vortices of Neoplasmah!
