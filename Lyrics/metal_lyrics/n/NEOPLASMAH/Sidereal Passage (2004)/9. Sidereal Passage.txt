Ascending from the ancient red holes
A transmutation, no man behold
Raging the capsules from Voidreign
A battle destined to be gain

They're prepared for, this cosmic onslaught
Gathered in the astral, horizon
Their strength comes from the pits of Urania
A power based on laser, and iron

Death, demise
From above
Demise
All around

The threshold as been crossed
The Spawn begins it's course
Spheres coming, from beyond
Voidreign, the spectral thorn

Death, dust
Everywhere
Death, lust
Forever
