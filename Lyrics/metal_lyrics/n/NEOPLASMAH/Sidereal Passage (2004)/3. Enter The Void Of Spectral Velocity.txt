From an age
Of dust and
Spheres
Frozen in time
We travel
Through the unknown
We've crossed beyond the line

A void of, sightless voids
Immersed in nothingness we are
Terrified and lonely
Our ambitions have taken us too far

Condemned to wander in space
And go beyond the stars
Mausoleum of ancient galaxies
The birth of cosmic scars
A spectral voice, cold and cursed:
"You won't go too far"

Too far...
