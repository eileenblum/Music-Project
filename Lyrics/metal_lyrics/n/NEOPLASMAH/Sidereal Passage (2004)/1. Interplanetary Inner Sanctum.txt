Away from all known spheres of thoughts
Within a cosmic, imaginary landscape
Touch the skin of non-existing reason
Interplanetary inner sanctum

Soulsearch, everlasting seed of immortality
Time warp, absurd oblivion of time
Through the immensity of the fourth dimension
I curse the ending, human existence

I can be, the omnipresent missing link
Painting shadows in a puzzle of disharmony
Defying the laws, of the future
Without arriving there, completely

Absorbed in the fear of my visionary dreams
I break the forthcoming, equilibrium
Towards the morning, of reborn
Inner, Sanctum...

Interplanetary, throne
Of eternal, reflections
Inner...
Sanctum...
