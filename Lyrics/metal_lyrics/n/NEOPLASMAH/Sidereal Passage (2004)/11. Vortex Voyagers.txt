Storming near Saturn, devouring the pale night
Galactic, interstellar... They cannot believe this sight

Drift into the dark abyssic vortex
Where the souls are purified
This hideous void of punishment
They will meet after they die

Absortion, demise, of wiccan light
Global vital force, cease to be channelized

Zodiacal abomination, yet to be explained
Cosmic congregation, Chiron's cryptic brains

Gather all powers of Jupiter
I've been chosen to destroy!
Outerworld beings
Your mine to wipe away

Drift into the dark abyssic vorted
Where the souls are purified

After the die...
