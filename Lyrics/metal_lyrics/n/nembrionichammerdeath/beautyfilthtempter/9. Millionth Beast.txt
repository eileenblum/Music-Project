I am a million beasts, the Antichrist, son of demons, bringer of lies.
To sacrilege, to sacrifice, to let you taste a world divine.
Call me forth by many names,
I'll send locusts, spread the plague, create war by creating hate.
Blood will flow, the seas are red, I manipulate and reign in death,
my sight is all you'll ever see, you're enchanted through my blasphemy!

[lead Dennis]

Strong is the enemy, prepare to die, Lucifer supreme, the oath is mine. [x3]
Strong is the enemy, you're so weak, die as Christ, I am a million beasts, I am legion!
