I've seen the weak, the poor ones, their ways, I know too good,
they've chosen and found the false one, they're no threat for my goal.
In my heart, in my soul, in my blood, bounded now, my body is yours, I won't betray, my commitment.
A state of being growing, countless dimensions to experience and to discover, no bounds,
I've reached my goal.
