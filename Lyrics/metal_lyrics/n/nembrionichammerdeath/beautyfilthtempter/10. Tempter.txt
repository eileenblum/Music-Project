Guiding demons, unholy blasphemy, below in the dark, enjoying sodomy, call him the tempter,
victor of the weak, ruthless and black, the overlord supreme!
Tempter, all the needs pleased.

Tempter, taste the noble seed.
Provoke the weak, call the beast, join the deathcult in the deep, tempter.
Call him tempter, lord and king, sculptured in flesh, the image of the beast.
For he is Lucifer, the image of filth, hand in hand, we cross the bridge.
Tempter.
