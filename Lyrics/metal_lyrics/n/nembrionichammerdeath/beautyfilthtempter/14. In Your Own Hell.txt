The master stands, in front of the altar, his name is terror.
Follow the beast, of blasphemy, he, who reigns below.
Follow and die.
In your own hell, ecstasy was mine so true, divine, in your own hell, sliced, ripped, skin stripped, burn, die!
Seven signs, born to die, so you're lost, the hidden truth in the pentagram, now you're mine.
In your own hell, ecstasy was mine so true, divine, in your own hell, sliced, ripped, skin stripped, burn, die!
Slave of god, you'll meet, the darkest mind who rules beneath, slave of god, you'll meet, the darkest mind who rules supreme.
In your own hell, ecstasy was mine so true, divine, in your own hell, sliced, ripped, skin stripped, burn, die!
