Taught by the one, the darkest mind, son of death's emperor, I believe in murder,
hate and death, and I will arise for disorder, poisoned is my mind and soul,
and never it will be purified, destiny, powerful I'll strike with hate,
and you'll pass the gates, it's time to create, and to embrace.

THERE IS ONLY ONE.
Yog-Sothoth, in thy name, I'll create chaos, disorder,
corruption, filth and hate.
Yog-Sothoth, in thy name, I'll create chaos,
disorder, corruption, filth and hate.
