Earth, you'll go beyond, and pass the gates.
Go, sink in the black, discover that here is no emptiness, no paradise, no heaven or hell, the galaxy seems width.
Fall into the seas of black, cross the timeless border where you have lived, preached and sinned.
This, a vacuum between time, also known as the other side, dimensions bright, a new begin.
Here, no emptiness, no paradise, no heaven or hell, the galaxy seems width.
To a higher state, a higher grade, pass the emptiness, the paradise, heaven or hell, you've past behind.
