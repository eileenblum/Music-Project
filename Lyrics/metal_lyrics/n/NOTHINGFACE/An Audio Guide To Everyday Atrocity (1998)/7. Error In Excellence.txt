You say i'm cold
See i'm just tired of you
You make me sick
Sometimes it seems i can't break you
Now that i'm sick
It seems all right
Now that i'm gone
You must be happy

I cannot stand this
These words don't come so easily
More aggravation
To silence my mind

One more
In the face redemption
But still i feel it and go
So you know i can't realize
Realize
Put you away so you don't know
Can't see you feel it what i do
See it in the face
What you do to the children
I still cannot break it
No matter what you tell me
You hear but you're blind
And you're still not comin around
To get a sound

He has to be destroyed...

So now i'm cold
You said you're tired of me
I made you sick
Sometimes it seems you can't break me
Now that you sick
It all seems bad
Now that your gone
I can't be happy

I cannot stand this
These words don't come so easily
More aggravation
To silence my mind

One more
In the face of redemption
But still i feel it and go
So you know i can't realize
Realize
Put you away so you don't know
Can't you feel it what i do
See it in the face
What you do to the children
I still cannot break it
No matter what you tell me
You hear but you're blind
And you're still not comin around
To get a sound

Burn
This empty mind
Take it all but you want some more
Apologies
Now i'm not cool
Suck up in lies
Say it all even with no truth
I'm feeling fine
I feel no guilt
For the shit i say
Could give a fuck about your inner
Thoughts
They're not mine
Clear kills
So you think you know some shit
Try hard
Know that you can't leave it like this
I can't see it through...

One more
In the face of redemption
But still i feel it and i go
So you know i just can't realize
Realize
Put you away so you don't know
Can't you feel it what i do
See it in the face
What you do to the children

I still cannot break it
No matter what you tell me
You hear but you're blind
And you're still not comin around
To get a sound
Clear kills
So you think you know some shit
Try hard
Know that you can't leave it like this
I can't see it through by myself
Told you
See your feelings overweight
