Take time think about when it's over
And when i see you where's your line
I cannot hear all the truth through
Your crying
It's time that i check my face
Faggot, you know it
The sun in my face
Forced my grin
Theeth shining, with dimples
Kill away the lust

It happens way too often
Eyes closed and mouth forced open
You always seem confused
Hands up and now you proved
That when
You kick my ass
But please don't hit my face
So i can laugh

Hey faggot
Where's your friends cause you know
That you can't hide

Alone
You know you're shit so
Hit him in the face, in the face
Come on do it again
In the face, in the face
Come on do it, hit him
In the face, in the face
Come on do it
Again and again, and again

It happens way too often
Eyes closed and mouth forced open
You always seemed confused
Hands up and now you proved
That when
You kick my ass
But please don't hit my face
So i can laugh
Fuck you
Stop grinning
Fix your eyes kid
Wipe that shit off your face
Look away boy
Stop starin
Stop grinning
Stop laughing

No doubt you would all tear me limb
From limb should i ever
Relinquish this control...
But that shall never be...

Kill it
That face
Break my teeth
My smile
Tear my skin
Expose
Lose control and feel it
Hit him
