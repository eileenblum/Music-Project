You're the pills she said
But i cannot shave the scares off from
You're head
If i take away the scars
Then you cannot hide away from
What you are
You can't

Oh, i see the picture that's been frozen
In my head
I'm sorry that you just can't see that
Lies
The one who lies the best is right
Believe the man to find you closure
But you know what is not true
The likeness
Can't keep on saving you

Your fearless leaders dead
And i cannot pry the nail out from
My hands
But the nails remain the same
And religion closed the mouth of sun
And sand
You said

Oh, i see the picture that's been frozen
In my head
I'm sorry that you just can't see the
Lies
The one who lies the best is right
Believe the man to find your closure
But you know what is not true
The likeness
Can't keep on saving you

I have not as yet been able to enlist
The help of satan,
But perhaps you hold the power to
Materialize the prince of darkness. .

You said
With the time that's coming
You'll quit like the rest
But when you see what it's coming to
Kills me and you
Now you say your perfect
With your face in the shit
Place your hands on her head
And take it away

You said about the time that's coming
What i find in the mind of a man that
I can't stand
Book in hand rosary
Then i saw it
And noticed that everyone sees
Through his bullshit
Everyone just stared
Can't believe an alcholoic
Now you know that we all believed you
When god he said he touched you
But it all stops now
Come on!
