Scratch the tears in for good
Sadist
Feels good
Life can't hurt on tv
Godspeed
Lucky now
When he grabs your hand
Do you lick again
But the taste has changed
Flesh remains

See what you go through
With bleeding eyes
Got what you came for
When hate is blind

Your told me not to lie

Anger persists to drown
Love it
Loathes you
Say your knife just won't kill
Try hard
Want it now
When the taste has changed
Do you rest your face
No eyes will close
The hole grows

See what you go through
With bleeding eyes
Got what you came for
When hate is blind

You told me not to lie

The start of new days
Has nothing changed
The sick knows no pain
