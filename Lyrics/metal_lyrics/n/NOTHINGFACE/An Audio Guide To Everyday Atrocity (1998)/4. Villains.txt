I can't see
The point in feeding that so what can
I say
Fucking saving grace
But still i cannot see it
Why
In this instance it's the bullshit
Can't you see
Believe
I cannot be the one who sees

Realize that there's no savior
Rue the words
Scar the peace
And then you'll reap the hatred
Feel betrayed
And create the sorrow

God help me
Sounds so weak
Jesus cries, helpless on tv
But still he does not go away
Get the fuck away
Now your feelings changed
But still you cannot stop
Just give me me pain
My own shit
And you don't know it

Realize that there's no savior
Rue the words
Scar the peace
And then you'll reap the hatred
Feel betrayed
And create the sorrow

Silence, you stupid pig...

Rape all the words you say
Your so lifeless
To the ones that love you
How can you not regret
And stay happy
With the lies you told
Why can't you face my world
Your so putrid
And the stink stays with you
Now i'm coming
I said it's over

The end
It's coming
Grab your face
And rub it in my shit
So face it
And fix it
Cause bitch, you got all day
You got all day
Sick of all the shit

Now that you've faced your faults
I still doubt you
For the words you've chosen
Spit in the face of god
Rub it in good
And just see what happens
Craving
And sneering
They're laughing
All at you
Now take this
This hand out
You're weak
You're shit
