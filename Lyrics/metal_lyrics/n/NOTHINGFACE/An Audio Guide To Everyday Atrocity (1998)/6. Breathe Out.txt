Burn and Beat
I'll beat you another
Just another
'Cause they watch it go, hear it go
What's up to what's off
Feel everything high
Never, ever could've been anyway
But you know everything that I do and I know it alright
There are things that I know that you cannot realize
Realize the pain is mine, and you're right

I take away

One more two more
Just a little fuckin whore
Can you believe this all again?
All again, done again, what I can, what again
But you know I can't see everything no matter whatyou tell me
But you know I cannot hold out
There are things I know that you cannot realize
Realize the pain is mine, and you're right

I see the pain
She drips from your eye
You tell me that the hate's not over
Rise from your bed
Clutching the thought
Staring at the dreaming killer tonight
You said you sorry
But it's too late
Still i'm not sorry
But it's too late

Keep it up kid
Keep it up kid
Cause why i think alone
Keep it up kid

Keep it up kid
Keep it up kid
You can't tell me nothing
Keep it up kid
See as i'm breaking down
Not much more to feel
Hurry up the time
Suppress your inner fear
Falling faster and i don't even know
The reason why
I gues i'm just a little too...

Fall, hit, break
It brings me down
To what you want
But me, i am
The one to break
I can't breathe out
And still
You scream find yourself respect
