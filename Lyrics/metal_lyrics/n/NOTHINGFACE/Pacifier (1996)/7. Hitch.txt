recite, i feel everything, relight my own joy in this,
my own faggot fantasy, t.v. series lightbulb coffin,
reborn, skinless nightmare, no words only questions,
like me, only everyone wants, feel this feeling
nothing

nothing....do i care
brings me.....lie to me
fucking.....happiness
can i......hate myself

push me through all closed doors, and i can't find my
way, i want to feel human, and i am what gives it
away, nothing can be done

ugly, i am nothing but send me to my crucifix, raping,
falling inside out, plaing what i used to be, would
he, collect his own mind, my own is not pure and
whole, piece this, less is what i am, love is a
wonderful thing to hate

[repeat chorus]
