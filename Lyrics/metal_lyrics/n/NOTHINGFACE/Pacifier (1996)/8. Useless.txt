i laugh at you, as you cry with me, why must i feel,
hatred for you, uncle sammy tried to hurt, but he
knows that we cant break his lies

inside

one more paper ten more murders, old man dart board,
innocent extinction, walk on my life, end ten thousand
more lives, but he know that we can't break his lies

inside

i fear- exactly what you'll do to me
i fear- if i ever will be free
i fear- rip my heart out through my throat
i fear- a milllion screams i am one
i fear- sadist calling won't you come
i fear- faceles shell i am done
i fear- why see what you've done to me
i fear- you mother fuckin' wish you had
