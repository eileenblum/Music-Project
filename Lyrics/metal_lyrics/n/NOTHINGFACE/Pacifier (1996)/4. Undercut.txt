sane closed my head shut now that i am painted black,
everything i am is gone like you pushed me , i burned
my hand closed now i close my soul from behind, now
every time i wonder if my sodomy's gone

repent my undercut (repent my lies), sewn shut nailed
to myself (sewn shut my eyes)

crushed ever deeper i am dead there's no belief, time
to try more to care nothing more i care now,
everything is done undone to keep myself a whole, try
believe myself believing everything i want

repent my undercut (repent my lies), sewn shut nailed
to myself (sewn shut my eyes)

time to give myself peace everything brought on leave,
i try my hardest and there's too much now, every time
there's no trusth all is gone this part of you, my
friend send my friendnow is gone but you'll seee,
stained black neck and bloody hands ohh i am, damned i
am, there's a dead whore at my feet there's nothing,
give me my head nothing more i am dead, see my fate my
soul my element is whole, every one done no belief
sadness and an open dream, unsure these books all read
death is fed through absent grief, all these pages no
one sees five years and a smoking gun, now my blood it
thinkens and it all stops now
