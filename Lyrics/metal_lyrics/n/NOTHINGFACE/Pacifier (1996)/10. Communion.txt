as time goes by and it's an endless deal, myself my
life think about my simple rights, just run away from
my only fears, contradict and compromise made to feel
like nothing

she...she wanted everything made me see where i fall
from behind

i bring myself under, time is an endless blur, i give
my soul to you, time that my heart is used and giving
is something you dont think about, lying is just what
your all about, please let my soul rest, i'll give
myself just a little while
