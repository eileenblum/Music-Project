i dont udnerstand this, all pain pushed inside, all
plastic frustration, why you cannot be you, i am
walking hate, all this surrounds me, i can't even try
, i dont udnerstand

why i hate me

you do not see, i dont udnerstand, i na mirror i see
nothing why dont i see something, my mind my own
prison, your face my own toy, i have no honest
reflection, i dont understand

why i hate me

see what i am, everything has changed, and i cna't
find my own mind, cause everything feels dead

i can't feel
i am numb
a perfect person

kill me

foudn out what im doing
i cant find my head
