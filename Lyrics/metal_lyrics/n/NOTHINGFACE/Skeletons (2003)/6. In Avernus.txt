Hate is nothing new
Murderers watching every step
Ignorance - oblivious to all the evidence
Repent - for all that were innocent
Forget - so we all can rest

Hey it's the end of time
We all will see it our lifetime
We all will die......Violently

It's painted in the sky
We all can see it
but ignore it...&amp; live our lives

The fear of dying
it finds us
no matter where we hide ourselves
Hide - some place in hell
In spite of living
The dead men
Know where we can hide away
Far away

Hey it's the end of time
We all will see it our lifetime
We all will die......Violently

It's painted in the sky
We all can see it
but ignore it...&amp; live our lives

We all enjoy the blood
It calms the rage within
Ingest deceit to cope

We never wanted this
We never saw the risk
We never wanted this

If we could only see the past the shit
and learn the truth
maybe someone could adapt
and show us how to change things
We invented the way to terrify en masse
and we all wonder why
when someone wants to kill us

Hey it's the end of time
We all will see it our lifetime
We all will die......Violently

It's painted in the sky
We all can see it
but ignore it...&amp; live our lives

Hate is nothing new
Murderers watching every step
Ignorance - oblivious to all the evidence
Repent - for all that were innocent
Forget - so we all can rest
