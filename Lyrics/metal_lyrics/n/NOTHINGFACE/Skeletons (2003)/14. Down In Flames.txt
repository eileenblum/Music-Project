[Japan and U.K. Special Edition bonus track]

I can see them and they raid on our ass
We gotta move quick if it has to think fast
They never saw us coming but now they'll see us going
When it's over it'll happen in a flash
We're the brand new crops in the kid
We're happy as hell and we don't give a shit
Just like I'm talking we've gone worldwide
We'll never stop the corporate house is on fire

We are the second chance
Your rules are broken now
We are religion and reason
A second chance

So once you get us and you can't get it right
When you wonder why we wanna start a fight
You should see it coming
But till you see it falling
When it's over it'll happen in a flash
Where the core prank crown makes us sin
We're taking control and we're saving the saintist
Just like a demo you build on lies
That's why I disappear it right before your eyes

We are the second chance
Your rules are broken now
We are religion and reason
A second chance

Upsetting cries(Upsetting cries)
So find your day
Upsetting cries (Upsetting cries)

I can see them and they raid on our ass
We gotta move quick if it has to think fast
They never saw us coming but now they'll see us going
When it's over it'll happen in a flash
We're the brand new crops in the kid
We're happy as hell and we don't give a shit
Just like I'm talking we've gone worldwide
We'll never stop the corporate house is on fire
