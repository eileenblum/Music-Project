Fuck! Here I am now
Trapped in this hypocrisy
Shit! And believe that
Shit is all that will ever be

Insurrection
The laughing gun
Revulsion

I've got a little pent up rage
Set aside for a special moment
Not long 'til we find a way
To attain our blood commitment
Never thought it would be so easy
But I'm still gonna take my time
Who says I need a motherfucking reason
All I need is cold precision

Destruction
For me it's fun
Reaction... yeah

Revoke our dreams of demons
To tear the world apart
Now that we have our reasons
Our holocaust will start

Your inner fear it complicates
Make us laugh, it make us hate
You will fall down one day

Hey! I don't want it
Fade into obscurity
Liar, no commitment
Use us for what you can't do

So it's all about commerce
It's all about sucking dick
If you're not about music
Why don't you sell some other shit

Destruction
For me it's fun
Reaction... yeah

Revoke our dreams of demons
To tear the world apart
Now that we have our reasons
Our holocaust will start

No! We don't need you
It's fucked now

Fuck! Here I am now
Trapped in this hypocrisy
Shit! And believe that
Shit is all that will ever be

Destruction
For me it's fun
Reaction... yeah [x3]
