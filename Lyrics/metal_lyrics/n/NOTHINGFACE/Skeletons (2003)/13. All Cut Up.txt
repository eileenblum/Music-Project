I think we'll cut you up
To find some good in you
Your eyes betray your lies
Come face your consequences

Space man philosophy
Green men driving in the H.O.V.
Death oversees the industry
Make us all happy
Make us ecstasy

Think about the reason why you came
Cause we don't want you here
Tell us again that I'm the fucking problem
With hope I'll disappear

I thought this was a good time
To tell you that I'm fine
Sometimes I get a little angry
Right now I'm high

Fuck you for the great disease
False hope in reality
Everything's all right for me
'Cause there's no fucking God - only anarchy.

Think about the reason why you came
Cause we don't want you here
Tell us again that I'm the fucking problem
With hope I'll disappear

We see it, we see it all
The fucking lies, we see it all
Are you satisfied

Think about the reason why you came
Cause we don't want you here
Tell us again that I'm the fucking problem
With hope I'll disappear

Are you satisfied??
