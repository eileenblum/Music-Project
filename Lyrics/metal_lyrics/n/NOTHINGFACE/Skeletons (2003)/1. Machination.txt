Let's start a new nightmare
A brand new truth
A patsy is useful
A window with a view

Someone is listening
Why can't they just leave me alone
And no one believes me
A gun for a conspiracy

Now don't disappoint me
And do what you're told
Be patient
We'll be calling you

That's what he says to me
The voice in my mind
Controlled by a subconscious shadow
Paranoid freewill confined

Read "Catcher In The Rye"
One hundred and ten fucking times
Brain washed and programmed
Obsession defined

Now don't disappoint me
And do what you are told
Be patient
We'll be calling you

No one will believe you
So say what you will
Be Patient
We'll be calling you

You're our little device
A mindless satellite
We have the place
And we've set the date

They decide when it ends
They don't let me do it myself
They got a use for me
A gun for a conspiracy

I'm remote controlled
I'm robotized for the dark government
