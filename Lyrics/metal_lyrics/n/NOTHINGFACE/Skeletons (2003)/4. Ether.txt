I'll never hesitate
Because I'm too good for that
I'll never show restraint
Because there is no need for that
I know everyone
I've been everywhere
I know everything
Because I'm everybody

We came to take control
We came to sell you freedom
We came to burn you down
We came to brainwash children

And it's not our fault
It's just your own new suicide

Where we belong
There's no one to hurt
It's some place where we can't be found
Where we belong
It's darker than space
A feeling that we all push down
So it can't be found

It's that time again
Can we get it right?
He wants us to revolt
To set the world on fire
We wont to show restraint
Because we like the violence
We are security
Wrapped in our brutality

And it's not our fault
It's just your own new suicide

Where we belong
There's no one to hurt
It's some place where we can't be found
Where we belong
It's darker than space
A feeling that we all push down
So it can't be found

Find our way through space
We'll never be found by anyone out here
Hide away from everything that knows what we did

I know everyone
I've been everywhere
I know everything
Because I'm everybody

Where we belong
There's no one to hurt
It's some place where we can't be found
Where we belong
It's darker than space
A feeling that we all push down
So it can't be found [x2]
