Telling time is hard when it rewinds
Painting circles around your crimes
What if I told you to die
Would you hate me and burn up inside
No traces, no picture
No sacred glowing scriptures
So control your chaos
Relax and you can save us

Your throne of unjust
A dirty sole of mistrust
It pushes down, forces us down

What if it all came crashing down all around you
How will you save yourself
If you need one more fix to let it lift
Just stop and think, because it's over

So it's fine if you can't define
All the reasons for losing your mind
But if I could turn back time
I'd walk and pretend it's a lie
No faces, no voices
No pain invading choices
No control, all chaos
A severed screaming circus

The time, the pain
Forced us to run away

What if it all came crashing down all around you
How will you save yourself
If you need one more fix to let it lift
Just stop and think because it's all over

You're the birthplace of disease
Ending all, ending me
Forever wrapped in chains

What if it all cam crashing down all around you
How will you save yourself
If you need one more fix to let it lift
Just stop and think, because it's all over
