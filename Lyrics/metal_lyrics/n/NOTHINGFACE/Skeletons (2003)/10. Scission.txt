If I could find a way
To release the day
I would serve the endless night
and burn out the light
You don't need to understand
You never need to know anything
If you hear just what they say
You'll fear its all the same

Lost in the catacombs
Some how I'm feelin' at home
Not far to go
Not far at all

I love to see you cry
I always crack a smile
I crowned
Face down
With the vultures
all around

Lost in the catacombs
Some how I'm feelin' at home
Not far to go
Not far at all

Never felt any distance
Never saw any signs
I never felt I was slipping
And now I'm out of time

I need to stop right now
I cannot fake this anymore
I need control right now
And get my face off the floor

Lost in the catacombs
Some how I'm feelin' at home
Not far to go
Not far at all
