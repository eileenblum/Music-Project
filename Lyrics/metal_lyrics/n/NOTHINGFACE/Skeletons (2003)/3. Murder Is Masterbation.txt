I'm not awake
But I'm not dead
The drugs are late
Lost my money again

They never gave you anything
You'd think you get the fucking point
I'll laugh until I'm fucking killed
I see the point but I can't find a way
To get through this fucking mental hell!!!

I'm not alright, but I'm OK
[x2]

All hail the pessimist
All hail the anarchist
All hail the rest that never gave
A motherfuckin' shit

It's killing season
Time to celebrate
What better way than to
Rid the world of all the walking waste

Wanna see it
I'll show you something
A middle finger
With a barrel and it's fucking cocked

I got a new way
So you can fuck yourself
Kill the motherfucker - all that I think about, yeah!

I'm not alright, but I'm OK
[x2]

Sometimes
You gotta voice your revenge
Or you're better off dead
You'll lose your fucking mind
Sometimes
You gotta look at yourself
See the world inside out
And scream out loud

That motherfucker
Kill that motherfucker
Kill that motherfucker
And that's all that I think about [x2]

That motherfucker
Kill that motherfucker
Kill that motherfucker
Cause we all need to scream out loud

I'm not alright, but I'm OK
[x2]

I found the easy way to die
Just educate myself and pretend
All I've learned's untrue
And yeah, I know that
All I'll lose is you

Have you ever loved something
That never seemed to
Have a face at all
It just screams out loud.....yeah!

It always cures the pain that would never leave
Then causes even more
It just screams out loud
But never goes away!

That motherfucker
Kill that motherfucker
Kill that motherfucker
And that's all that I think about

That motherfucker
Kill that motherfucker
Kill that motherfucker
