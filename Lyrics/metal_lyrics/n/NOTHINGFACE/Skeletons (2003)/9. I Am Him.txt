It's like a needle
A kind of evil
If you're the devil
It's very simple

You never needed anyone
You never needed anything
The pinnacle of ignorance
Epitomy of dissidence

Yeah, you're faceless
And kind of useless
But that's all pointless
Because I'm faithless

Hide away inside the dark place in my mind
Fear of God and will He take me home to fire

If you're a monster
With plans to murder
You'll find your conflict
Hangs from your shoulder

If you feel it going limp
Find your God and hold your grip
If it starts to burn your hands
Ignore the pain - stick to your plans

You feel guilty
And still you're empty
You define arrogance
Discontent and emptiness

Hide away inside the dark place in my mind
Fear of God and will He take me home to fire

I am the fire at your funeral
I am the bloody Marxist General
I'm the lonely rapist priest
And the Autocratic President

I'm the judge and inquisitor
I am the corporate funded senator
I am the stink, the shit, the hate
I am American

I am the atom-splitting scientist
And the gun-toting lunatic
I am the flag that contradicts

I am the way...

I am American!

Hide away inside the dark place in my mind
Fear of God and will He take me home to fire
