Before this starts
I just want to tell you
That you could fuck us
Love me
So I can relax
So I can aim straight
So I can do right for us

I know you inside
I know you're cold
I know you're saddened by the loss of those
And now you're cold
I'm sorry that you're next, so go

Who's next? All right!
With the fucking bruised knees in the black shirt
Screaming, all right
In the bloody back seat of my black hearse
Hanging, all right
On a fucking meat hook in my basement
Who's next? All right!
It's everybody's time to die!

My mind does this
I can't stop the rage inside
My hands again
Hate me
So I can relax
So I can kill you
So I can do right for us

No more pretending
We're all alone
I want to hear just why you left us all
We really loved you
But now you're cold
I'm sorry that you're next to go

Who's next? All right!
With the fucking bruised knees in the black shirt
Screaming, all right
In the back seat of my bloody hearse
Hanging, all right
On a fucking meat hook in my basement
Who's next? All right!
It's time for everybody to die!

Yeah, fuck, you'll die you fucking bitch

I can't deny
Forensic lies
or hateful sighs
I'll wait for you, I wait for you

I'm glad you know

I cannot take this anymore
You've pushed me to the limits
You sold us this before, but I still know
We'll find the right one to fight with us now
And I know that you're set on us, you're set on us, you're set on us
