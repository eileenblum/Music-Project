It's not ending
What's it to you
Isolate me
Feel unsure
Tired of waiting
Please let me go
I'll never forget you
Just let me go

My eyes see everything I want them to
I just don't want them to see you
Just the way that you are
It's so cold

Safely tortured
Hiding the scars
No one knows it
Just you and I
Lift your dress up
I said I'd go slow
I'll never stop this
Until I reload

[Repeat chorus]

Sometimes there's no control
Shut up till I'm done talking
You seem so insecure
It seems you got it all
You got it all

[Repeat chorus]

You got it all
