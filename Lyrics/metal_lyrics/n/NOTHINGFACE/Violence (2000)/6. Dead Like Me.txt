I realize time's ticking by
Change what I am
This way I feel it
Like me now, like you now, like me now

The faces change
Hides in the shade
I can't fear the way back into you
Hide everything that's helping me
Why can't you just let me fall apart?

[Repeat Chorus]

The colors fade
Casued bloody days
Now you know the truth about your friends
Just where they are
And where they lie
Why can't I was the blood off my hands?

[Repeat Chorus]

So, you think I'm nothing
But you'll see
Dead like me
I got this feeling in my chest
That I'm free
Dead like me
You'll see
I showed you inside of my dream
You'll see
I showed you inside of my dream
You'll see
But it's my turn

You saw me dying
You want to sell you soul to those men
You will risk us all
If there is one thing I've got to tell you
You say you're cold
But it's bullshit
Alone again
I said we'll beat them all

[Repeat Chorus]

All the pain, it satisfies my dreams and thirst
I never try to help you or your filthy friends
I'll awlays hate you till the end
