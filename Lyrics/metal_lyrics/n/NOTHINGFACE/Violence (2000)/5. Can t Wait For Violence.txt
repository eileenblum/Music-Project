You know
You say that you'd be satisfied
But it's all right
The pills
It's all you have with all the pain
To satisfy
Alone
I feel just as numb, don't you know
But it's all right
It's soft
The heat and the smoke take you in
It satisfies
No, it's so cold now

Please, in the sky
Let it fall
Let if all to me
In these words
In these eyes
Let it all be freed

It's clean
The skin and the dreams help me bleed
But it's all right
The screen has sucked all I am
I'm a shell
It satisfies
My ink
Shows I can't learn a thing
And it's all right
I know
That this wasn't much, just a fling
It satisfied
No, it's so cold now

[Repeat Chorus]

So I can't be the one that peels away
But it's heavy, and I feel it
So wait, I knew it
But I'm guilty though
And I can see them tearing away
Your flesh, no
Killed in the rain that day
Just like everyday
Won't you wait for me
It's not over
Go back again
You policed again
Killed it all
Can't wait for violence
If you're open handed
You'll see still lie in my face
I can't wait for violence
You know you say that you'd be satisfied
But it's all right
The pills
It's all you have with all the pain
To satisfy

Alone 
I feel just as numb, don't you know
But it's all right
It's soft
The heat and the smoke take you in
It satisfies
Yeah...
