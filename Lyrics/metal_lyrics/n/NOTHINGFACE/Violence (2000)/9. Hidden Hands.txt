I saw it all
A piece in games
It sets in slow descend
Just when I thought I saw everything
You showed me something new
You Thought that I would never understand

But now I know how to
Understand you
To see you
To realize the rot inside
You're evil
But placid
I feel sick cause I did not see 
Nothing at all through all the excess
Destoryed it all and took all the rest
I was misled and nothing less
It's all the same, in love with distress

Somehow the starts retain our innocence
Disappointment in how things have gone
But inside the eyes of every living man
Steep stairways leading down to God
Show your face so you'll convince all of us

[Repeat Chorus]

You invade daydreams
And ruin everything
Forever, you'll stay the same
Forced us to go insane
There is no place for you in this
Can you find your way back away from us?
Can you adhere and show us strength?
You fucked us all, done nothing straight
Still we won't crawl and we won't fall
Yeah.. we gave you something to keep
All this again
Not again
Took the long road but got out
I'll show you something
You fucker
Just raise your chin like this
Fuck scrape out his eyes
Yeah, now shave his head and face and ass
Just get him ready
Cause I want to maek this last
It's fucking perfect, show the world
Still we won't crawl and we won't fall
There is no place for you in this
Can you find your way back away from us?
Can you adhere and show us strength?
You fucked us all, done nothing straight
Still we won't crawl and we won't fall
