I can't feel this way today
And I said that I am tired
So go to sleep and close your eyes
I'm sorry 
For all the sin
For all deception
You know it's hard to face you
When I know what you did
You're sorry

Stay far away from you
I'm sick and tired of you too
But there's the way that you move?
Dressed up in lies
Beds in truth

You tried everything you said
But I see that you can't be
What you were before
I'm laughing
Please understand these words
You are nothing anymore
And your skin it hides your waste, your age
You're lifeless
Stay far away from you
I'm sick and tired of you too
Theres only one way to hide it
Just paint your eyes it bides the time

But there's the way that you move
Dressed up in lies
Beds in truth
What if I find my way to it
Confinement of my mind
Encased in lies...

Why are they doing this? 
They said when you got here the whole thing started. 
Who are you, what are you? 
Where did you come from? 
I think you're the cause, of all this, 
I think you're evil! 
Evil!!!
Again, you fucking did it again
Stay far away from you
I'm sick and tired of you too
What if I find my way to it
Confinement of mind
Encased in lies, lies, lies
