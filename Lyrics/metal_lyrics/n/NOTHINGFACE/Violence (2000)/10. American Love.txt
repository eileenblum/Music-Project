I push myself in first
I'm here to wait for all the killing
I think I'm just in time
Geewhiz I'd love to die like that
Everything, everyone
Behind our face we love to hate
We all just want to see
To see you get kicked in the face
It's nice to see
See right through you
But I will not be exorcised
It's nice that you believe
Corrupt your eyes to cause those scenes
It's nice that you conceived
The way we trust
It's OK we all believed them
We just shook our heads
It's OK we all believed them
Battered and so misled
It's nice that you believe
Corrupt your eyes to cause those scenes
It's nice that you conceived
The way we trust

I push myself in first
I'm here to wait for all the killing
I think I'm just in time
Geewhiz I'd love to die like that
Everything, everyone
Behind our face we love to hate
We all just want see
See you get kicked in the face
It's OK we believed them
We all just shook our heads
It's OK we all believed them
Battered and so misled

I've lost some time
I found out this is real
I'm sad but I'm not that sure
Then I realized it's just you
The first time
My first time
Everything, everyone
Bekind our face we love to hate
We all just want to see
To see you get kicked in the face
It's nice to see right through you
But I will not be exorcised
It's OK we all believed them
We all just shook our heads
It's OK we all believed them
Battered and misled
