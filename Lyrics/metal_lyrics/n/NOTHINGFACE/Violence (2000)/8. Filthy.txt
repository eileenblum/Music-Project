Do you trust me?
Do you trust me?
Do you want this pain inside?
Where's your head?
Are you thirsty?
Do you know all the simple things that it 
Takes to change my mind?

Instead of lying boldly...
That face could be so pretty
But you scarred it all before
Put everything aside

Now I know you've filled my life (she said)
Is there no weapon to make this end? (you said)
I'm sorry, I didn't help to pretend (you said)
Cause I know nothing in my life is chained forever
Now that you can find a way

Where's the frowning?
Where's the crying?
Where's the "I would bleed for you?"
You held my hand well...
Feed the image...
I know it's hard for you to believe...
That you could be alone now
The picture seems so close
But I'm so very far away
But not far enough

Now I know you'll ruin my life (he said)
Is there no weapon to make this end? (you said)
I'm sorry I didn't help to pretend (she said)
Cause I know nothing in my life is chained forever
Now that you can find a way

Hey, you sold yourself again
It never comes back again
Yeah, you sold yourself again
Bitch you fucked it up again
Bitch do you trust me?
Do you trust me?
Do you want this pain inside?
Where's your head?
Are you thirsty?
Do you know all the simple things that it
Takes to change my mind?

Instread of lying boldly...
That face could be so pretty
But you scarred it all before
