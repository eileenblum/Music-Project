Today I set aside a friend
But still I wait for dead
Before this takes time from me
We can all just see
Beginning
The first time that we're inside
You, you told me nothing
So I know you lied
We know it

It's the same, but it's OK in your eyes
Now outside these lines
Through your own eyes never lies

Why can't you believe
I want it all back, all back
Still you showed your sleeves
I want it all back, all back

You know it's coming
I caught you dick in hand
Please don't say nothing, you'll box yourself again
It's nice just to be right again
But you sacrificed a friend, you're the ony shit I know, you knew it
It's all right, change your own words
Tell the truth inside me
Never seen

[Repeat Chorus]

There's some that you've wronged
There's some that you set free
There's some that deny
There's some that fall on their knees

Today I set aside a friend
But still I wait for dead
Before this takes time from me
We can all just see
Beginning
The first time that we're inside
You, you told me nothing
So I know you lied
We know it
