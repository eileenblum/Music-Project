As if the word was ending
Things seem to spin uncontrolled
They're all paper faces
Some withered, not old, some legends uproot evil
Some made of silver &amp; gold
But why is brimstone worthless
When we're all so cold

No, you showed it all before me
You threw it in my face
But still I can't believe you're not at fault
Circumstance allowed me to seek out my revenge
When I find you I'll feel peace again

I see love from Angels
I saw no love in the past
I thought you made us perfect
I guess you're laughing last
Your thoughts don't seem much greater
But still you're better than us
Why don't you check your mirror?
Will it break your trust?

[Repeat Chorus]

Instilled the ways of hate
I understand that it is too late to save you know
From all the dirt in hell
There, you saw it, you know it's all inside the eyes
The weakness &amp; sadness 
To feel you've burned alive 
I forgot I could feel it
And fear it, and be it
The thought that I'm alive
Unchanging my standing
I feel used up inside
I can't bear anymore
The screams have fought
Into my dreams
And the snakes they speak just like me

I see love from Angels
I saw no love in the past
I thought you made us perfect
I guess you're laughing last
Some legends uproot evil
Some made of silver &amp; gold
But why is brimestone worthless
When we're all so cold
Fuck
