They feed the fires and erase your hope
Waking the fear that once was gone
Done not fall behind
They do not care for those who linger

At the end of each day
When shadows crawl upon the streets
Yet another endless night awaits
There's no relief
You're all alone

Come with me
To visions glee
It's a killing spree
A silentmovie for the haunted to see

Memories
You see the old pictures they tear you to pieces
Scream for mercy
You crave for relief from the pain

Come with meÂ 
To visions glee
It's a killing spree
A silentmovie for the haunted to see

Maybe
You will find the shelter you've been longing for
A dreamscape with silence and love
Just go for the final redemption

Red bloodshot eyes
Can't hold back your anger
Reach out and take my hand

Come with meÂ 
To visions glee
It's a killing spree
A silentmovie for the haunted to see
