All I ever wanted
I wish I'd never seen this dayÂ 
And darker clouds had blown away,
To clear the sky, for the sun to shine.

I pray that memories fade away
And some new morning I'll breathe the light of day
Then she will know, the price we paid...and we paid...

All I ever wanted,
Was to turn back time
And wipe the tears from my eyes,
They've been there a long time..

I'm locked down, a heart that's screaming,
No love, I'm only dreaming
When you smile
I see shadows on the ceiling...

When once, a kiss was all,
No more within these walls
And so, your distant love still calls..

All I ever wanted,
Was to turn back time
And wipe the tears from my eyes
They've been there a long time..

With all the hope that slips away,
A shining star will come our way,
Take it back, turn it back, take it back..
All I ever wanted...

All I ever wanted,
Was holding hands on drifting sands.
And walking while the sun was falling..
And all the words,
I never heard,
They only cried that love was calling...

Way down within your mind,
You left our life behind.
A place where passion,Â 
Leaves a grown man blind..
So take away my heart,
We wont survive apart.
For this is the day,
For young love and young hearts
