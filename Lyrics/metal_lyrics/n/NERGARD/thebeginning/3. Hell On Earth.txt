Awakening into a dream where hopes and fears collide
The haunting shadows in your mindÂ 
Your fate will never be deniedÂ 
The beast is rising from the ashes
Summoning the powers to be
Leads you into a blind alleyÂ 
No escaping your destiny

Disillusion
You're lost in time
IntuitionÂ 
You can't ignore the warning signsÂ 
Evolution
The path of no return
SacrificingÂ 
Oh will we ever learn
Welcome to hell on earth

Taken by the kiss of Judas
Now these walls are closing in
The dark recesses of your soul
Oh the ending soon begins
You've cried your tearsÂ 
You've fought your fight
As the cards are dealtÂ 
You're losing sight
Accept your fate, there's no escape
All your anguish fades away

DisillusionÂ 
Paralyzed by fear
Intuition
The end is coming, drawing nearÂ 
Evolution
Oh what's in store?
Sacrificing
Oh will we ever learnÂ 
Welcome to hell on Earth

The promise of forever
Letting go of fear
Keep holding on
Holding on
Just embrace the darknessÂ 
The pain will disappear
Keep holding on
Holding on
