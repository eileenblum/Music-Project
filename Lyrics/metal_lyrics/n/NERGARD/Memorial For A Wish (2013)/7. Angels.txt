Youâre my everything
I love you so
Youâll become a father soon
Iâm sure the child will have your eyes

You are hereby sentenced to twenty years imprisonment in Portland Prison, where you will pay for your crimes by doing hard, hard labor

Silhouettes betray theyâre hidden in darkness
Shadows dance in the dim light
So many hours wasted and gone in the silence of the night
What has become of my direction
I strive to unlock the past
Left with a feeling of help and despair
And condemnationâs here

Do you believe in angels
Them angels you keep dreaming of
I hear them singing songs of forgotten love

All the tears youâve cried
What youâve been fighting for is gone
Forever more
In a haze time starts to erase
The dream that once kept you alive

Falling in-between
To a place unseen
Angels rising high
Calling my name

Why should I trust in religion when terror has taken its toll?
Why should I trust in God?
All the sacrifices made
Why should I trust in love when all I feel is hate?
Thereâs no forgiveness in my decisions
I canât be spared

Hate is the reason for losing yourself
Running blind, you succumb
Were all the sacrifices made in vain?
You choose death before your life

All the tears youâve cried
What youâve been fighting for is lost
Forever more
In a haze time starts to erase
The heart that once kept you alive

Falling in-between
To a place unseen
Angels rising high
Calling my name

In every glimpse of the eye she was there
And everytime he tried to reach out she vanished
Every day he grew weaker, slowly torn apart by the hands of despair
He began to lose the sense of time
As he faced the silence all alone
In time love will tear us apart

Velvet ocean, soothing paradise
On a silent shore sheâll wait
Rainbow eyes, faded memories brought back to life
The scenery of an everlasting dreamscape

You can hear the calling from inside a dream
Calm voices in the night

Rest your eyes for a while
Welcome to an open state of mind
Dismal dreams count for nothing now
Welcome the silence, itâs so genuine

To feel redemption you must first learn how to forgive
Then you will feel the grace of God
And the warm embrace of love

Everything is surreal
Youâre beginning to feel that the world is crumbling down
Falling to pieces into the unknown

Tell me what you see, speak of your dreams, the lying visions
Tell me who will be the one that will save you from your self

So long I dreamed that a new timeâd begin
And promissed myself that Iâd never give in but what for?
My reasons are no more

So long ago
In the shadows a young boy cries
Holding on to pieces of a dream that slowly dies
Insignificant tears, heâs lost in a maze
Falling in between
In the black of night an old man dies
Lost in the sorrow that shines from his eyes
Invisible tears, forgotten by all
Forever gone

A call in the night
Voices that claims my life
Enlighten the flame once more
Where are you?
Can you hear me calling? I long for you my love
Shattered dreams are carved in stone
Release me, give me shelter
From this suffocating life

Falling in-between
To a place unseen
Angels rising high
Calling my name
