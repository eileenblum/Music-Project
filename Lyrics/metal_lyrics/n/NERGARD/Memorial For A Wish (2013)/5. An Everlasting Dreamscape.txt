On a silent shore they once fell in love
Under the rays of a setting sun
A paradise blooming wildly
Soon to be asunder

First love so fair
Bold endless dreams
Something so beautiful that it hurts
Baracades falling softly in openhearted souls

Sleep beneath the morningstar
The burden'll come of your shoulders
Sail away into an everlasting dreamscape

Deep within a dream
Far from the world
Sweet embrace, neverending love
Sure that it'd last forever
Just a fools hope, a fools hope

Sleep beneath the morningstar
The burden'll come of your shoulders
Sleep beneath the morningstar
The burden'll come of your shoulders

And way down the line
There's a moment in time to say goodbye
