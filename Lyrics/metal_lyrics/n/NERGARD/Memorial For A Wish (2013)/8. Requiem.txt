Sleep my love, so tenderly

Iâll watch over you tonight
Deep in my heart I cry for you
Alone on the edge of forever

In the dark of night
Keep me close to you
Two hearts beats as one
Stay forever beside me
Imagine where I would be without you

Once filled with hopes and visions
But the ocean is deeper than it seems
Downcast amidst the sinners on a way that lead to nowhere
Once I was the lost one for no one to find
Inside Iâll bleed no more

Iâve always been a dreamchaser
I wish it was plain to see
Never got the chance to say goodbye
You go with the wind
Prisoners of our own fate
Please donât tell me itâs too late
Iâm lost into the eyes of an angel
Youâll always stay within this heart of mine

Lost into the eyes of an angel
She was the fairest one, my vision divine
How I long to hear your soothing voice again
And to feel her endearing touch

Stay in this heart of mine
Make the shadows disappear
Times of olden days, bleeding memories
Wounds that never heal
Once I was the lost one for no one to find
Inside Iâll bleed no more

Iâve always been a dreamchaser
I wish it was plain to see
Never got the chance to say goodbye
You go with the wind
Prisoners of our own fate
Please donât tell me itâs too late
Iâm lost into the eyes of an angel
Youâll always stay within this heart of mine

A distant shadow, the come of the darkest hour
Closing of a curtain, once was is no more
My last endeavour drowned in trails of tears
Never foreseen the end of the line
A day that would recede into such darkness
The light of the beacons faint
The silence and the sorrow
In time it will all fade away

A window opened wide for soothing winds to break the silence
The flame of a candle slowly fades away
His eyes are lost, anchored in grief
And hate is growing from deep within
His beliefs are fainted memories
Dwelling in the depths below his consciousness is close to blow
Sending a plunge into his heart to wake him up before he dies
Caress the angel of death as he frees you from your pain
And when youâve reached your last breath
Remember that you lived your life in vain

Oh lord why have you left me?
Forsaken my soul to dwell in pain
Tossed me to the torment
Devastated my life
Oh how I despise you
Youâre the hypocrite, the serpent, the lying
I truly hate you
You spit in my face
Youâre the disgrace
Chained by desire and greed
I damn you

The way back is shut thereâs no return
A scene of fright now your future burns
Chase the fear in his eyes, thereâs no disguise
Welcome to the pandemonium
The growing fear is tough to bear
Let yourself fade into darkness
Blood and shameâs your part of the game

Holding on to feelings that wonât hide away
Youâll carry the weight alone
Iâve stared him in the eyes, the holy father, the twisted mind
Holding on to feelings that wonât hide away
Youâll perish all alone inside the darkest hour
In chains of hell, your time has come

Sleep my love, so quietly
Iâll watch over you tonight
May your shadows be tamed for a while
Fall to sleep in my arms, Iâll kiss you goodnight
Angels sing for you the sweetest melodies
Yet a song unknown to me
The requiem for a dream

In chains of rage, despair and hate
Hell on earth, all the suffering
Unchain his soul, set him free
Within the circle, the fires of hell
The pawn in the game, sacrificed without shame
Now itâs too late to climb the barricades in time
Claimed by the undertow of his devastated mind
The last defences are breached and defeated
A human sacrifice, the fires reteated
On his deathbed he is carried by the nameless ship
Nothing to refine, itâs the end of the line

Together forever
I reach out for your love
