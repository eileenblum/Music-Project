Still I see your eyes
A smile that wonât fade away
Still I hear your voice
Where are you now?

I will always be with you

Once there was a man and his girl
She was his anchor, his guiding light
Once there was a lost one
She gave him life

So long since Iâve felt your embrace
How I wish to hold you once again
Nothing is everlasting
What am I without you?

Is this our last goodbye?
The end of the line
I cry my tears in vain
Nothing will last forever
Is this our last goodbye?
The end of the line of what you never knew
One day youâll stay beside me
My love will always be for you

The lights are all burned out
Out of time
And the walls are closing in
Youâre slowly loosing ground
Wishing you were somehow here again with me

Is this our last goodbye?
The end of the line
I cry my tears in vain
Nothing will last forever
Is this our last goodbye?
The end of the line of what you never knew
One day youâll stay beside me
My love will always be for you

Echoes of the past
Donât you wish you were a child again
Yet another angel claimed by the eternity
Sheâll sing the hymn of a broken man

Is this our last goodbye?
The end of the line
I cry my tears in vain
Nothing will last forever
Is this our last goodbye?
The end of the line of what you never knew
One day youâll stay beside me
My love will always be for you
