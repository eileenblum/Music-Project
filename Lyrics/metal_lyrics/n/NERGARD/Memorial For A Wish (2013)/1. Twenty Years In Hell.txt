âLet the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labour by doing honest work with his own hands so that he may have something to share with anyone in needâ
[Ephesians 4:28]

The Bible clearly states that stealing is wrong.
The defendant broke not only the law but one of the Ten Commandments when he broke into the home of Nathan OâCallaghan, a well-respected man in the city of Dublin.
The court finds the defendant Peter OâDonnell, guilty as charged of aggravated burglary.
You are hereby sentenced to twenty years imprisonment in Portland Prison, where you will pay for your crimes by doing hard, hard labor.

And so it began
An endless night
A haunting nightmare
Shadows are all that I see now, nothing but darkness
Father, why have you deserted me?

The curtains fall my time has come
In chains of hell I stood my ground
Day after day I prayed for you

The sense of time was there no more
As years went by life fainted slow
Twenty years in hell alone

The memories of her sweet embrace
The healing vision eased the pain
She would be there when I once returned
Sheâll be there

All these years of silence
Not a word, a sign of life
One would assume you had succumbed

Life has not been fair to you
Bloodshot eyes, you look like hell
Embrace the fact youâre still alive

For twenty years I suffered wrong
I was ripped apart by the hands of the law
I was innocent but no one cared

Where is my wife
Where is my child
Let them come to me
Let me see them, just one more time
Again

In the black of night I heard her voice screaming frantically
Great despair, alone she cried for aid, so desperately
She prayed for the strength to save her child, so tenderly
But her prayers were not heard
She is no more

The darkness is here
Iâm at the gates of hell
The chains of pain sumerges my soul

A flower wither slowly
Left blindfolded to die alone
Never to be seen again
Sundown brings the silence
Downcast eyes, a shadowed heart
The tears will erase the memories
