Purple skies, torn intuition
Nightfall slowly closes in on empty rooms and fainting lights

Elyssian visions fades away as theyâre revealed as all but lies
Youâll face the silence all alone
Crawling away from a broken mirror
His eyes is black and cold
Bloodstained hands holding pieces of a dream
Lifeless vision, a bold ambition
Everything will come to and end
This man is out of time

Hold on, be strong with everything you are
Lifeâs your religion

Carry on through darkened hours
Reach for strenght within your powers
Fly towards the distant borders
And set your sail through troubled waters
Shades of night unfurl so lonely
In trace of light youâre not the only one to face the tearing silence
Holding on

He pray for vengeance but doesnât believe
The faith is gone he wonât receive the relief he crave for
Forsaken soul youâve just begun to enter a frantic state of mind
The fatale pandemonium

Hold on, be strong, with everything you are
Lifeâs your religion
Wonât you hold on to my hand

Carry on through darkened hours
Reach for strenght within your powers
Fly towards the distant borders
And set your sail through troubled waters
Shades of night unfurl so lonely
In trace of light youâre not the only one to face the tearing silence
Holding on

On through the storm
Raging winds but still itâs silent
Trembling waters, it is the tides of forever
Angel eyes, smile for me she waits for you
Hear the calling angels
Come with me donât linger

The stage is set to be deceived
You gave your trust and you believed
You suffered treason, he gave you no reason
Believing in God, why bother
In spite of all the things youâve lost
He spit on promises and trust
Without questions you suffered
Chained up in hell, from the cradle to the grave

Come with me, Iâll take you to your paradise
Youâll be lost forever, by the pits of hell

Memories, cry no more itâll soon be over
Sleep between the waves and soon youâll be reborn as one  
Beneath the morning star she wait to mend your aching wounds, your hate

Carry on through darkened hours
Reach for strenght within your powers
Fly towards the distant borders
And set your sail through troubled waters
Shades of night unfurl so lonely
In trace of light youâre not the only one to face the tearing silence
Holding on
