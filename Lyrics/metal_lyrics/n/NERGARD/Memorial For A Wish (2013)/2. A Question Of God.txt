When it's time to say goodbye
To the memories in your eyes
And your fire slowly dies
Is it a question of god?
Love's a crying shame
And your fate won't take the blame
When your heart won't play the game
Is it a question of god?

My road took me to a darker place
Where footsteps led me to my own disgrace
A way that wound itself from deep misfortune
You must have waited what seemed forever
And still I never ever made it
And somehow slowly the sun went down
But I never came
Will you remember my name?

When it's time to say goodbye
To the memories in your eyes
And your fire slowly dies
Is it a question of god?
Love's a crying shame
And your fate won't take the blame
When your heart won't play the game
Is it a question of god?

I don't remember a romantic summer
Only leaves that fell forever
Like reasons to survive these dreams of never
No one said a word to me
About my child's destiny
Or how my love would set her free from my world

When it's time to say goodbye
To the memories in your eyes
And your fire slowly dies
Is it a question of god?
Love's a crying shame
And your fate won't take the blame
When your heart won't play the game
Is it a question of god?

I cry out for redemption
Desperate for connection
Emotional resurrection
A question of god
Burn me down in hell forever
Ring the last church bell to tell her
The love we lost we'll find together

Bring us back together
Make these dreams die forever

When it's time to say goodbye
To the memories in your eyes
And your fire slowly dies
Is it a question of god?
Love's a crying shame
And your fate won't take the blame
When your heart won't play the game
Is it a question of god?
