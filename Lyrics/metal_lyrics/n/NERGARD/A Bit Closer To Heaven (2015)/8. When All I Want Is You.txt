There's a cold deception at the end of the line
Voices calmly telling me to leave it all behind
In your eyes I see the spark of loneliness and grief
How come you're just too far to reach

When all I want is you
And see your smile within the still of the night
All that I want is you
When all I want is you
Beside me every second of time

And so we've reached the very end to it all
A silent lonely melody echoes through the hall
Seems to me it's everlasting, love won't fade away
So how come you're just too far to reach

When all I want is you
And see your smile within the still of the night
All that I want is you
When all I want is you
Beside me every second of time
All that I want is you
All that I want
When all that I want is you
Just you
Only you
So why do we say goodbye?
Leaving everything when what we had resigned and died
Was it all in vain?

When all I want is you
And see your smile within the still of the night
All that I want is you
When all I want is you
Beside me every second of time
