You painted pictures in a state of bliss
Some pictures of a life for all the world to see
Then all the colours once went dim and cold
The end of what should last eternally

A blaze of feelings
When she comes before your eyes

Illusions for real in your dreamin' mind
A haze of feelings
When she gaze into your eyes
Shows you what heaven is
State of bliss

Let it come all passion
Give yourself compassion
Hope is key if you want to survive
Be blind to madness now the greatest enemy is your own mind

You stayed upon the peaks of a shallow dream
Bold ambitions torn and washed away
Safe and sound a memory remained
A brief reminder of all you ever gained

A blaze of feelings
When she comes before your eyes

Illusions for real in your dreamin' mind
A haze of feelings
When she gaze into your eyes
Shows you what heaven is
State of bliss

Let it come all passion
Give yourself compassion
Hope is key if you want to survive
Be blind to madness now the greatest enemy is your own mind

You fly on broken wings tonight
A trip into the depths of hell
Don't stay on these roads to be left all alone
It's the time for you to do or die

Why let despair consume your shivering mind
You give it nothing but a waste of time

Let it come all passion
Give yourself compassion
Hope is key if you want to survive
Be blind to madness now the greatest enemy is your own mind
