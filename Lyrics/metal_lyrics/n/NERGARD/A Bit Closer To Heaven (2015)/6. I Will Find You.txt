Softly when I dream of you
A state of bliss entices me
Makes me calm

Calmly you will guide my way down the long and winding road

So calmly
To finish the story from where it begun

All the struggles, the chase for a life
Would drive me to edges I'd soon fail to fight
Holding on to a dream day by day
To the day that I pass away

Wherever you are one day I'll find you
Whenever you dream then dream of me
Wherever you are one day I will find you

Softly when I hear your voice
A burst of life enlightens me
But it feels so bittersweet
Calmly you will light my way through the dark and lonely night
So calmly
To help me rewind the days of old

Time to step back into my past
And to meet this night as it was my last
When it's all over don't bother to mourn
I'm better off this way

Wherever you are one day I'll find you
Whenever you dream then dream of me
Wherever you are one day I will find you

Show me the way
I need to hear your voice
To give me a moment of peace

When nightmares sends chills down my spine
Every night becomes darker without you

Seconds feel like ages
But one day I will find you
