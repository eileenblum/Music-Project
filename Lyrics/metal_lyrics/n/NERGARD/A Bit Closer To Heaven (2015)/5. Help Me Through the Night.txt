Step inside, I'll share my story
The wildest chase, a blaze for glory
There was no memento mori

Only bold ambitions, no bitter fury

Can't see the reason why all hell was there for me to dwell and suffer in

Torn when you break away before my eyes
Calm when you say my name
Stay with me tonight
Help me through the night

A crack in faith, too hard to mend it
Let it crash, I dare to break it

Can't see the reason why all hell was there for me to dwell and suffer in

Torn when you break away before my eyes
Calm when you say my name
Stay with me tonight
Help me through the night

Torn when you break away before my eyes
Calm when you say my name
Stay with me tonight
Torn when you break away before my eyes
Calm when you say my name
Stay with me tonight
Help me through the night
