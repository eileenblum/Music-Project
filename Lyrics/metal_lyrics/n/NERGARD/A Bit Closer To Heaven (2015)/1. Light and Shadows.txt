Rewind these days of confusions
You're inside the haze of illusions
You're denied by heaven and hell
Your time has come
To die awakens the horrors in your mind
Frenetic eyes succumb tonight
Conceived and rejected
It's time to burn

Oh come feel the hate

Pitch black eyes filled with hatred fires
Cold steel piercing the blackened heart so deep
Remember it's too late to calm the storm
Accuse yourself for your stay within abuse
You're torn by the silence's noose
You lose, the brink of destruction is soon to come

Oh come feel the hate

Just give in and take my hand
You're running wild in angerland
And I'm the king of fury
Despite the shit, despite the lies
The anger is still in my eyes
And it will stay to the day I die

Time's up, get up and face the mob
Sent by the one in which you trust
Time's up, get up and pay the toll

Oh come feel the hate

Just give in and take my hand
You're running wild in angerland
And I'm the king of fury
Despite the shit, despite the lies
The anger is still in my eyes
And it will stay to the day I die

Braving the storm
I see you as you fall over
Caught in the dark, a boy so petrified
Craving for the storm to wash of your sorrow
To give a sense of direction, that's all you need
Say goodbye to the memories in your eyes
Lifeless eyes going under at the end of the line

Your paradise's burning, your visions are gone
At the edge of forever your memory start to faint
There's no tomorrow for your kind
Behold the victim of a twisted mind

You know that he steal and still you believe
In someone that just seem to be so unreal
He shattered your dreams and spat in your face
He calls you a weakling, a simple disgrace
End it tomorrow or end it tonight
It's not an issue just give up the fight

Can't you see the way it's meant to be
I'll show you a way so divine, that'll help you rewind the time you lost

A way into your own paradise, such a sweet delight
Reunite the love

Just give in and take my hand
You're running wild in angerland
And I'm the king of fury
Despite the shit, despite the lies
The anger is still in my eyes
And it will stay to the day I die

Just give in and take my hand
You're running wild in angerland
And I'm the king of fury
Despite the shit, despite the lies
The anger is still in my eyes
And it will stay to the day I die
