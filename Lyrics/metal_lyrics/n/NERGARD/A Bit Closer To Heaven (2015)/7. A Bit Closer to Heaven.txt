I wake myself with haunting cries
Petrified but cool as ice
And why say it is OK
To throw your life away

Soon my love I'm on my way

On and on, I just can't wait
for a billion ways to ease my fate
Why can souls become so cold
A piece of trash when life gets old
Wait for me, I'm on my way

To you, straight to you
Oh please, take me a bit closer to heaven

Come ashore to tense disorder
Rest the fight when night gets closer

Calming my storm
The dreams are forever gone
Come ashore to tense disorder
Rest the fight when night gets closer
End of my storm

The pain is forever gone

Late at night I close my eyes
And see a life of breaking ties
A drowning man without a line
Into the deep he's out of time

Soon then he'll be on his way

To you, straight to you
Oh please, take him a bit closer to heaven

Come ashore to tense disorder
Rest the fight when night gets closer

Calming my storm
The dreams are forever gone
Come ashore to tense disorder
Rest the fight when night gets closer
End of my storm
The pain is forever gone

So when the night comes by you'll close my eyes
Hold me tight as I refuse to fight
Lay me down to rest forever more
End my line, Oh God set me free!
