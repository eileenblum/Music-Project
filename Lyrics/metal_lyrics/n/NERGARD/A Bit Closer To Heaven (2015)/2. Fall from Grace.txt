Trace a dream, a deep conviction, into a state of grace
Face a stream of sheer elation, at peace you quit your race
Far from fear, the stage of horror, a place of twisted minds
Stay at ease, you know it's over, forgive as time rewinds

Why breathe it in when you want it out?
Your war is fought and won, soon you're back where it begun

Fall from grace
We can't rely on our faith
The time is late for those that carries on
Fall from grace
We can't rely on our faith
Your war is over

Call of the search for answers
Stay calm and carry on
Judas' kiss, the great deceiving
The darkest hours' gone
Sleepless nights and darkened feelings, a life in constant fear
A twist of fate, the turn to better, the ending line draws near

Why breathe it in when you want it out?
Your war is fought and won, soon you're back where everything begun

Fall from grace
We can't rely on our faith
The time is late for those that carries on
Fall from grace
We can't rely on our faith
Your war is over
