A spin through the core of illusions
In worlds that are dark as the night
Deep in a dream, you'll make it real again
In time you'll know how

Innocent eyes, pale as the skies
A wonder beyond any dream
It's only visions of what could have been
So real, so unreal
You drift in and out of consciousness
It's time to let go

Dreamed you'd be under the rays of a silver lining
And within the light you'd see her smile again
So beautiful

On through the storm where tears are falling
Carried in dreams on through the night
Leave me a smile once you fall into the spark of happiness

A spin through the core of illusions
In worlds that are dark as the night

Cemetery skies, he fall to his knees
And silently cries beside a lonely grave
I love you
So real, so unreal
You'd give your life to hear her voice again
It's time to let go

Dreamed you'd be under the rays of a silver lining
And within the light you'd see her smile again
So beautiful, so beautiful

On through the storm where tears are falling
Carried in dreams on through the night
Leave me a smile once you fall into the spark of happiness

In tears of rage you seal your fate
When reasons are made from simple hate
An empty cradle, a lonely grave
Shattered forever, you'll get what you crave

On through the storm
Where tears are falling
Carried in dreams
On through the night
Leave me a smile
Once you fall
Into the spark of happiness
