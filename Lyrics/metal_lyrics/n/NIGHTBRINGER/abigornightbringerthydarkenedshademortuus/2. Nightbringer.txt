[performed by Nightbringer]Time turns like great serpent scales
Here in the darkness
And Sophia coils
As lost in deep fever dreams

And she sings such strange songs
Through the corridors of this temple
Where unknown shadows move unseen
And here I turn through a thousand coats of flesh and bone

Whilst drinking from her lips
Staring entranced into moving vacant eyes
And sinking ever down into the moon blood sea...

Forsake me!
Those of the depths have claimed me as their own

Those that whisper and mock
In backwards blackness
Those whose secrets bleed
All sanity
Cold

And if they call I must follow
Down through these tunnels
Endlessly deep
Where flickers unholy distant light
Yet he who shall claim it shall then no longer be me

A jaw moves behind the demon mask
Poisoned tongues drawn across the scarlet fields
Forming, deforming and twisting the world
Twisting the goddess sunk in psychotic sleep
Yet there beneath the tidal waves
Of mad ophidian sights
The scales crack and wither
For a new hidden light
The whirlpool of nightmare
Shall wash the tunnels clean
Beyond sleep and waking
Alarmed shall we rise to behold reality
