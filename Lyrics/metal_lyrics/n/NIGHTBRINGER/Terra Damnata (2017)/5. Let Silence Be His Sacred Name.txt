A - Zeroth
Born of I
Dark Sabaoth
In you I die
Inverse light
Of my soul
Black as night
Death extolled

Phantasmagoric fear ekstasis
Though art bornless, faceless, and pleaceless
The resounding silence is your name
This thy word, thy form and fane

Absence of presence
Presence of absence

A - Zeroth
Born of naught
Speak the name
No tongue has wrought
With sightless sight
I behold
The living night
The blackest gold
Absence of presence
Presence of absence

In nullity and stillness
Your profound sentience
Ceremented in divine dread
The long shadows of god-head
Trailing through these depths
Behind horizon spanning steps
O intellect of naught
Bornless yet born in me
O otherless
The emptiness
In me!

Hekas!
Phantasmagoric fear ekstasis
Hekas!
Faceless, bornless nad pleaceless
Hekas!
The resounding silence that is your name
Hekas!
This thy word, thy form and fane

O absence of presence
Presence of absence
In nullity and stillness
Your profound sentience
Ceremented in divine dread
The long shadow of god-head
Trailing through these depths
Behind horizon spanning steps
O intellect of night!
