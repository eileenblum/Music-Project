Inheritor of a dying world
Wanderer in the wild darkness
Enter now this shadowed path
The affliction of Saturnus grips the heart
In leaden chains
Inherit a world of dust!
Here is no solace, no earth-born respite
For those who bear the serpent's mark

O companion of the fetid tomb
Foul specter, of the greedy grave
Inheritor of a dying world
Enter now this shadowed path
To seek the light

Dost thou find hope in works of mortality?
Art thou awed by matter's seeming might?
Behold! The fruition of long ages toil
A paradise for fools!!

The earth aswarm
With maggot man and tottering in ruin!
The gates of death swing wide in fateful glory
Greeting the throngs of pallid life's abortion

The affliction of Saturnus grips the heart
In leaden chains
Inherit a world of dust!
Here is no solace, no earth-born respite
For those who bear the serpent's mark
Inheritor of a dying world
Inheritor of a dying world...
Arise, and greet the dawning light of Phosphoros
