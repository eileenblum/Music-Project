We are as wolves amongst ruins!
Oh, ye sons of Apollo crowned
Whose final rays depart
Safeguard thy Father's embers
In the sanctum of thy heart
And stand unbent
Unbroken in storms untamed
And let the winds 
Stir your embers to blazing flames!
We are as wolves amongs ruins!
Oh, ye sons of Apollo horned 
Whose inferno now shines in the Hell
Bear witness to the end 
An Aeon's death-knell
Our final jubilation 
shall be in the tolling of its bell !
Morse Triumphalis
We who arise within our fall 
Oh, te sons of Apollo horned
Whose inferno now shines in the hell
Bear witness to the end
An Aeon's death-knell
As wolves among ruins 
As wrathful gods amongst decay
Before the gates in hell
The sword of justine bequeathed to slay As wolves among ruins 
As revenants of Father's past
Hearts darkened with the light
A black sun doth cast
" who is worthly of the name of man ?
Who does not want to be tested and
does not look for a dangerous task?
For the strong man inaction is torture.
There is only one sight able to command 
the attention even of a god..." -Seneca
Stand unbent
Unbroken in stormns untamed
And let the winds
Stir yout embers to blazing-flames!
We are as wolves amongst ruins!
A cycle ends
Yet we stand in the night depraved 
To salute the dawn 
While flling to our graves..
