Hail! ye powers of shrouded Night
All who wander 'neath the hoary moon.
Hail! Breat circle of the never setting stars
Revolving the voidful throne of Drakon
Hail!
Hail!
O father resplendent with midnights crown,
Puirssant lord of the liminal breath
I mixt wakefulness and slumbering.
Thy maiden consort, terrible yet fair
__her piercing eyes
search out the soult for hidden lies.
Hear me! Attend unto my call!
Hear me! Attend unto my cal!
The ancient pact of blood declares our kinship,
And the word spoken in all Truth vouchsafes my intent.
Tried in deed and tested in ordeal__
for I have nurtured the hidden flame,
a Sermit's lamp to lead the way, 
And banished Earth with mind reposed.
Now I within all shadow dwell
enraptured in Phantasie's own spell.
Hail! ye powers of shrouded Night
Hail! Breat circle of the never setting stars
Hail! Oh father resplendent with Midnight's crown
