Lumial,
Prince of the Earth. Who shall hear thy words?
When the earth splits beneath thy shadow and mountains crumble at thy passingÃ¯Â¿Â½ 
When the lakes, rivers and seas are poisoned by thy tongueÃ¯Â¿Â½
When the dying sun is swallowed within thy terrible maw, 
Who shall harken unto thee and be counted amongst thy children and thy mighty council? 
Who shall see as thou doth see, with the eyes of the Serpent, as the man of the earth is pierced, torn and bathed in flame, 
his ashes scattered by the breath of thy divine word 
Who shall be born upon angelic wings, raven black, through the nighted arches of SolomonÃ¯Â¿Â½s Gate?
Lumial,
Throat of Oroborous. Swathed in locust winds, and storms of thunder and flame 
Who shall stand before thy glory? 
Who shall wade with thee through oceans of blood to receive baptism under the crimson skies of Megiddo? 
Who shall revere thy Name as the tremendous clamor of VulcanÃ¯Â¿Â½s clarion resounds and star after star falls burning to the earth? 
Lumial,
Usher of the Dawn. From clay to flesh, from flesh to flame, let us be crowned with thy crown! 
Let our celestial wings close about thee as we ascend into starless night enshrining thy emerald radiance above the burning earth
Lumial,

Serpent of Heaven. Who shall become as thee, and be counted amongst the stars?

In the shadow of thy mighty wings we shall walk upon the corpses of man
Across blasted wastes, through fetid rivers of poison and blood
And fields of husks and bone
Bearing the SerpentÃ¯Â¿Â½s chalice
Within which the blood of our blood and the seed of our seed shall know union
Into the loins of the daughters of Quayin
Shall this libation be poured
And from wombs divine shall a new age be born
Oh, Lumial!
Lord of the Burning Aeon! Blessed be thy name!
