I set the flaming eye of Algol upon my brow
And ride forth upon sepulchral fog with serpents and shades
Under the thousand eyes of Night and her black wings
And where I pass birds fall from the sky and soil is salted
With arboreal haunts on which every tree hangs a wailing man I commune and learn the Gospel of the Fall
I nail the Ravens Head upon the oak at the crossroads of death
And see with hollowed eyes what the earth has swallowed
I hear the cries of what still rots within its belly
I smell decay and the spoiling of the flesh, the incense of the dead
And I behold the Gate.  All secrets first lie below
Down beyond the sinking corporal houses, into the depths, across the abyss into vacuous black
Unto the other shore so far beyond the reaches of the flesh, beyond time
The Phosphorus blaze the heavenly jewel of thy crown illuminates this kingdom beyond the veil of death
The pillars of its gnosis rising before my host
And with a single word and the breath of flame, I bring forth the Dawn
Let the wary weep as slumber turns to death
Let the earth smolder and heave as the Golden Pillars rise
