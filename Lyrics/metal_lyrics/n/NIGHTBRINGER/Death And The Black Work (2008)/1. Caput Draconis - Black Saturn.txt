Behold, he whose ebon nimbus blots out the face of god
He who weaves the Lethean spirit about the dying hearts of man
He who art the Black Dawn raised to enfold the earth within starless pitch
Concealing the splendors of heaven
Arch- glutton who feasts upon the flesh of infancy with prolicidal hunger
Imperator of beguilement and the unbroken dream whose gramarge hath entangled my being alow the soporic waters
From my somnolence I now stir, for through the pathways of thy hidden vestiges unveiled
Within this sweven underdark, I have gained the Gateway of Dawn, and I awaken
Arisen that I may behold thee, O' puissant lord, with eyes unveiled
And thy Name with the first first breath of life
At which thy gates are thrown wide, baring me no longer from thy high-sealed sovereignty
Verify I come forth in tempest, crowed with flames and a vest of unyielding night
Betwixt the houses of slumber and awakening, to slay thee with the adamant spears of my tongue
And usurp thy palace of death, sealing myself within thy star-fire throne
Resplendent above
My wings unfurling sable across the blazing heavens
As I consume my brood in bounty
Satiating the hunger of a god
