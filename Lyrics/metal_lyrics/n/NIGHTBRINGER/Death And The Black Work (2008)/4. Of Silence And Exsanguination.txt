Release the blood
I fall through the earth and am inhumed within the dark beyond
Descending in the throes of the two-fold death unto the corrosive pools of Tartarus below
Wherein my being writhes and gasps
Before this supreme gate which no consciousness may pass
Flesh is scorned and blood is offered with both hands upraised
Double Serpent of a thousand eyes gaze upon me now
Tear my being asunder in thy winds of your mighty will
Let my life flow out from me unto the yawning pitch
Crimson to black, fluid to flame.  Unto the hunger of the eternal storm
Let my fall be the fall of all men.  May the blood of humankind flow out from these wounds
Falling in ruined form deprived of all essence
Immersed within the depths of the black ebb
Sinking into nothing
