âSee, there shines a torch amid the graveyard of heaven's assembly,
a spark in the weary pupilla of Oblivion. Awake in the kingdoms of primordial slumber
and steadfastly alight in hollowed space. A burning meteor cast into the waters of the underworld,
as a Fire ripen in Shade and bloomed in Tartarus' mire.â
âSee, I am a Secret star drunk on and drenched in the blood of the Dragon's heart,
pulsating within the depths of Eternity.
A black glistening eye that pierces through the borders of Sequence and Form.
For I am the Bringer of Night enthroned at the centre of all Darkness,
luring with of the riddled Light of all lights.â

Praise thee, O Midnight Sun!
Praise thee, O Hidden One!
Towards the Heights within the Depths
Rise and become!

By the left-hand of reaping
And words without breath
Self-crown thee with Night's diadem
Within the Temple of Death

Enshrined in Deep Midnight
DEATH and life the self-same
The candle of wisdom
|Betwixt the black horns of twain
And speak now his name!
And speak now his name!
Ye have become DEATH!
The All-slaying athame
O Lord of Deep Midnight
The Sun of Black Flame!
The crux of the High Sabbath
Night's power untamed
Hail to Thee
Light of that Sun which shineth bright
at Midnight's hour, in the night
of body's senses overturned,
withdrawn in silence of the tomb.
Laid bare beneath the Daimon's glance,
which pierceth sharp as any lance
the centre of my flaming heart.
