"I" am the seed that must die in the earth. My surname is Drakon and I exhale my spirit two-fold under the sign of the Raven's Skull. Oh, igneous venom, I ingest thee from the fiery chalice of the Coiled One beneath a tumultuous sky of flame shed mercurial tears. May the Blooded Lion lay upon the sulfur that is my disgorge and be stayed by the poisons of my toil. Shackled in a coffin of Iron, heated within the flames of the Forge of the Ebon Sun. I seek the Magisterium through the gates of immolation. Sable daimons of the Gate of Horns be not unfamiliar, for I have slain thy brothers of the ivory pass with the reaving athame of Mort. The earth trembles with the resonance of the waking Devil's breath and the harvests burn and locusts gather with the opening of his eyes. Six spheres hat become thrawled under the baleful sign of Saturn. Seven sisters in conjunction wail the name of God and Quayin's black winged host exanguinates the moon. Seven trumpets resounding, the raging Theullai hath been freed from the abyss. Seven seals are breaking, disinterred Titans rise. Seven gates are opening, seven spheres of flame, I upturn the seventh chalice, and pass beyond the Seventh gate.
