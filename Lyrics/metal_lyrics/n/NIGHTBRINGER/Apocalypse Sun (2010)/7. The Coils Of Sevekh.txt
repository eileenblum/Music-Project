Shilyat, devour me seven times in seven maws and carry my remnants within thy belly through the gates of the Abyss. Rahab, entomb my soul within thee, that it may become a black seed germinating within thy womb, adorning thy flesh and filling with the blood of Tannin. Ophion, expel me, into the chthonic depths beyond celestial illuminations, that I may call upon the tempests and summon the Fates of gather about me. Reborn, I unfurl my coils before the deep throne of God, nighted and inversed and rise from his oceanic temple. Shedim, enshrine me in my fury as I call upon the Storm and draw up Leviathan.
