Wnen thy nations become as the long nighted Gomorrah
And the curses and profanations of provenance dims the stars of heaven
And the therion skulk within the ruins of the kingdom of Adamus
I shall adorn the skin of Belchira and speak with his mouth the terrible utterance of Black Metatron.
And I shall place in thee pneumata akatharta, that we may gain the gnosis born of fire, earned in strife and woe and become Legion, or in fire be consumed and diminish.
Into fathoms of infinitesimal dark these words shall cast thee down.
Only the radiance of Heosphorus' infernal orb shall grant thee vision to return from the black of Sheh-ohl.
Ye, serpent marked, know new form and harken onto the high-seat of Dawn, to stand before the golden throne of Helel.
He who sits enshrined in fury between the might of Gog and Magog, resplendent before the Daimonium.
