Mouth of Semhazia rise up from the earth. Threat of sulfur and fire, I cast myself abject into thy Furnace of Triibulation. Prince of the Earth's Inferno anoint my flesh and b urn this carnal prison of decay. Lay me bare upon the lake of fire and baptize me within its scorching waves. Execution of the body of Eden's clay. Trial of the body of light and of the dark, the pillar betwixt the heights and the abyss. Draconic axis mundi! The Furnace is the Forge, and the Forge is the quintessence of the Swallowed Sun, a Sun that shines within the depths of Hell and illumes the gates beyond the Pleroma.
