I am I
Apothosis crowned with a black sun nimbus
Of seven Immolating rays
Risen from a sea of cacophony and darkness
And invested within starless night
With the left hand stir the serpent
Who slumbers before the throne of Ariemanios
Awaken!
Seven storm clouds of Typhonian winds
Ten horns to rend!
Poison for poison
Confound hymn of praise
Omega, Upsilon, Omicron, Iota, Eta, Epsilon, Alpha
From this sphere shines black illumination!
From this sphere comes wrathful fire!
Ebon Izevaot
Rush towards the children of man with the hand of Gadriel
And with the stroke Kasyade, strike the womb
of the genetrix
I am I
