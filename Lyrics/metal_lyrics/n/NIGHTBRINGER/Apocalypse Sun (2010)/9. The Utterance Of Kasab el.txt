Grammaton four-fold, writ with star-fire upon three tongues
Three tongues sealed within the mouth of god
The mouth is the chamber in which is housed flame of Creation
What sentinel and binding spell sought to bar thee from this radiance?
Through what way and by what means did though pass, oh black winged Kasb'el?
Through tribulation and strife ten-thousand fold or ways nighted and unknown did thou ascend?
Virile was thy respass unto the atrium of the Catholicon.
Glorious was thy theft...long was thy fall.
Cast upon flame and pitch, forbanned and bound Aoratos!
The NAME silence, and unspoken...
Where can thou be sought, oh black winged Kasb'el?
In what prisons aphotic were thou sent abject beyond the illuminations of tyrannical thrones?
By what ordination was they tongue made silent to all worlds and aethers?
Doth thou await me, in patience unequaled, oh black winged Kasb'el?
I seek thee now and forever...
