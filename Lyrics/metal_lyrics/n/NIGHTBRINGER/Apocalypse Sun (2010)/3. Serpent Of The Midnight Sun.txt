Sept-Dracronic star raised in culmination above the dying earth, at each point a devil crowned with a hundred blazing suns, like so many flaming spear points born from black oceans of naught.  Sidereal phantasmagoric host heralded from the abyss by the resonance of the first cosmic Utterance.  Fulgurous princes of tribulation enshrined upon thrones of burning horns, seated above visages of fury and scorn, the seven faces of the Devourer who slithers through the black between the stars. 

I pray before the yawning maws of gluttonous ruin, the divinity that shall swallow the heavens and sunder the earth drowning all within the infinite ocean of darkness.  I give praise unto the seven daimons of the abyss, the earth, and the twilight of this aeon's end.  The lidless gaze of the Eye of Typhon, an ebon igneous orb suspended within the dark immensity of empty cosmos falls upon me.  The Autarch of the First and of the Last awakens within me and I know attainment of the heights within the voidal perfection of deep Tehom.
