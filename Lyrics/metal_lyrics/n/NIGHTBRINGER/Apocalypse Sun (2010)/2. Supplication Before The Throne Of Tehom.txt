Tehomat
Coil thy form above me
And guild me with seventy horns
As I rise from thy black sea temple
And pass back through the gates of 
Death and the Abyss
To copulate with the Fates
And extinguish the stars with my hands
All stars but one
With serpents jaws
I feast upon the face of god
And drink the wine of his heart
I rend and burn his form
And unleash a deluge 
Of blood from his wounds
To drown the world of man
Sphagia of the highest divinity
I give to a throne so utterly low
And from the chalice of Geh I pour the dark shadow of time.
An Irregular liberation of menstria to poison the heart of Sothis
As Akhekh devours the moon the Word of Truth is assailed once more
And thus the Circle broken
Saturn enters the subterranean mansion
Of a dread star whose course arcs through the nadir of the abyss
Then rises from the underworld
To be reborn as the blazing black flame of the Lord Enemy
Whose illumination is Death
