Daebaaman!
Faceless one adorned with a hundred thousand masks
To whom a hundred thousand tongues give a hundred thousand names
Ineffable adversarial triune
In conjunction at the center of the cross
Birthed from a womb with dragon's teeth
And raised in deific spledor as three roaring serpents
Three serpents from one
To coil about the four pillars of the earth
And slay the sons of man
I now drink from the first cup and pray for the last
Disinterred, the slain sun that lies transformed within the abode of the dead
Rises dead and black, I now eat of the final harvest
A feast of slaughter, sickness, and woe
As black illumination rends the heavens and spills across the earth
Daebaaman!
Dragon of Old
Maw of Reclamation
Devil of God and man
Bled by the Cosmic Sword
Yet unconquered
Indomitable Enemy of Creation 
Thy blood corrodes the sigil of the Time-keepers
Divine nepenthe and poison
Daebaaman!
Thy wound is the fount of the profound abyss
The grail from which I sate the thirst of black gnosis
I tast of all offerings from thy table and thy cup
And dance in jubilation as darkness in apotheosis forms
And enter now the world.
