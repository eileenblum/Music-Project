Dost thou not know Me?... My name?...My sign? Dost thou not know My provenance and My throne? 

I am the Twain Horned Prince
Sovereign of the Earth
Illumed under the cycles of the Morning and the Evening star

I am the Pontifex that would span the heights within the depths

I bear the mantle of Old Night and rise from the face of the abyss with eyes upturned towards the lights of the Pleroma

I am the stone within the primordial sea of tribulation and strife. 

I am the lone sojourner in the burning desert of Shadow

I am he who strides upon the razor's path
Flanked by chasm and naught

I am he who would pass betwixt and between within the moment of the nocturnal thunderbolt's radiance

I am Man
The burning Adam who reaches towards Polaris to steal from it's quintessence
And places it's ineffable flame within my heart.
