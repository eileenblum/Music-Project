"The mind of the Father named all things in threes"
"...all things have been generated from One Fire."
"Source of Sources, the womb which contains the All."
"Above all, let the priest himself who governs the works of fire, be sprinkled with the icy billow of the deep-roaring sea."
-The Chaldean Oracles-

What is this wind of black fate, That guides me and carries me on;
So steeped in the Devil's earth, So far from the fane of sun,
A voice in the darkness, In irremeable fathomless depths
The black, the living darkness inside me Is Death!
Yet as distant as elder stars, Whose once brilliant flames are long dead
A paradoxical inverse light, No sun ever shed

It calls me it names me "No-one" With silent sepulchral breath
So I name Him the "All" and the "No-nothing" Within the Garden before the elders of Seth

The shade of Abel arises before me, neath the blood stained right hand of Qayin
And his left hand is pointing Towards the scared plot of the slain

Oh, ineffable guardian and guide, My dream veiled daemon of other
As one we were born of the Devil, And Eld Night our majestic mother

I am myself! I wish to be other!

Crown me with thorns, Neath great spiraling horns
Three nails to affix our fate, Upon the cross betwixt evening and morn
Let the seal of ever becoming, Be now rended and torn
And to the daemon within, A new pact is sworn
"Self" I name thee, My shadow veiled brother
Yet no name can be given, To that which is other

My Fate - My will - My heart - You fill - With light - Beyond light - A flame like the night
My lord - My love - My god - Above - My angel - That - Is naught - Answer my call
My Darkness - My sea - Of black - Eternity - Becoming - In darkness - A will - To be free
A self - Becoming - Other - Than self - My otherness - That - I dream - And die to become

"For the mortal who approached the Fire will possess the light from God"
"Those who, by inhaling, drive out the soul, are free."
"For in this triad the Father has mixed every breath."
"...keep silent initiate."
