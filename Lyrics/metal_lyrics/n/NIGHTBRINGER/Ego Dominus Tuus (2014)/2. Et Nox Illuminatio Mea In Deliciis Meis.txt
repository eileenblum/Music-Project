My pleasure is melancholy - God above me - God below me - My heart the fulcrum between
I am of you - You are the lord - I am of you - That makes the darkness shine
I am of you - Glorious as the sun - I am of you - Our father who art in me
You draw me up! - EHEI - Death! - EHEI - Daimon! - EHEI - Fire! - EHEI
You draw me up! - Athanor! - EHEI - Serpent! - EHEI - horns! - EHEI
I - Draw you - Down -

I long for the gift of profound death - So I pray before your mask
Bowing down before this self I cannot know - Least I open the temple's door
I could never approach your mirror - Your blessing is ecstatic reverie
So jubilant within your Night of Light - The Dark Noontide

And he sayeth unto me! - And he sayeth! - I am your lord!
And he sayeth unto me! - And he sayeth! - I am your lord!

Your pleasure is melancholy - God below me
Your pleasure is melancholy - God above me
My heart crucified between - My heart crucified between

Our father who art in me - Whose inverse light shall set me free

God above me - - My heart crucified between!
God below me - Shaitan! - My heart crucifed between!

God within me - And I sayeth - I am your lord!
God within me - Shine! - I am your lord!

I drink the black-bile philtron - Of your Saturnine cup
Upon your earth - I do sup
My nourishment commeth - My nourishment cometh

My nourishment commeth from doing the will of my father
