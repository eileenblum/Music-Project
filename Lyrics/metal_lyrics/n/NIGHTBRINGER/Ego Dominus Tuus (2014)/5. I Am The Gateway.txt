At the barren edge of the silence of night
'neath the snare where the snake sheds its skin
Where the rivers of our strangest dreams collide
I ventured into the wilderness of death's awakening

To seek for that which all others abhor
On a road that defies the course of the world
With the blood of my heart seal the fated oath
At the point where all moments unfurl
I chance my all for everything other
My soul unto you, demon and brother

Into the circle where eye must meet eye
With the one who is all that I am not
And the night is but all that lies in between
Where sown is my self's seed
Within the torn tome of destiny

All secrets are tied to none strangling noose
That's solved and rebound upon the gallows hill's top
And in a storm of peacock feathered bliss
Shall strange new wine fall into my cup

For between the cold fingers fetching sense
Falls golden sparks and the fallen angels seed
That flows into the core of crossroads
Where all paths crooked and narrow must lead

Doorways unlocked, chalice overturned
I slit the jaded throat that sings the wretched world
And dive into the instant, the void of your face
Where the veins of God opens beneath my lightning bolt blade

The hour is struck, the time is at hand
To rewrite the rhymes that our cruel fate once planned
O Devil and God, on your road I embark
For we are bound everlasting by pact, birth and a murderer's mark
