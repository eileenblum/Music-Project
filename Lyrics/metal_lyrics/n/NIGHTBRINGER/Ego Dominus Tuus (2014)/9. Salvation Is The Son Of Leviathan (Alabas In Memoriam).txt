And God created great Tanin...

Ye, who I cannot know in life
Nor approach but by the way of death
The muted Heart of the boundless ocean
I pray, I pray, I pray to you
Swallow me...

Your essence is... - None in man - The void in ××× - Whose clay is dead
Your essence is... - ×  in × - The sea unto which - I pray be fed

Void of Heart - Hollow clay
Fed to the whale - To become osprey
Void of Heart - Clay absent flame
Towards the Heart of Void - That ancient Name
Leviathan - ××××ª×
Drown me in - Leviathan
That ancient name - The Death within the Waters
Leviathan - ××××ª×
I die within - Leviathan
Whose maw is the womb - Of salvation
I sink in your ocean - And with wordless prayer beseech you
I come unto this baptism - And die that I may reach you
Take from me - This lifeless clay
And place in this nighted breast - The flame of day
