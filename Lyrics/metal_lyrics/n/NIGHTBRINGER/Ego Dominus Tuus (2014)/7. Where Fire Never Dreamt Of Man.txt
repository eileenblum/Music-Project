And I dreamt of libricide and fire, a flaming pyramid opening the desert nights
Flaring letter's in mad laughter swirling across the sky, like screeching simurghs unchained
That stole the keys right out of St. Peter's hand to dare the borders to forgotten lands

Shine you terrible lamp of Wisdom, shine upon the desert fields of night
Shine within flesh and blackest mire, for my tongue has a dire taste for fire

Fallen into the wastelands of our dreams

Where I'm wildered unto the forbidden gleam, of Azazel's burning sacrament and sword
So descend upon these lands, Estrangement's Lord

Throw me into the depths where you once fell, to be accursed and blessed within the springs of Hell
To pass outside the route of heaven's stars and die to the yoke of heaven's law

I've become something I've never dreamt of before, my words all burnt within your unearthly torch
My name re-written in your blazing winds and known is the secret of Shemyazaz' sin

"O Nimbus of a daimonic crown, blaze forth across eternity for me
The night is wholly mine and in Death's kiss it is sealed
Where light and darkness conjoin, I have buried my Will towards expanses impossible
And opened the road unto where thoughts bow before: Red, Holy, Chaos-flame"
