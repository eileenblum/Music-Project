Asael, descend from high Eden! 
From abyss to the sun
Down the bright serpent
Towards the dragon of Nun
Within the night of black Eden
Towards death I would bow
Illumed by the flames of a trident
To pierce the mark of my brow

To become as lampadiphor
Of a great fallen spark
From a star luciferious
To illumine paths dark
Lucifer - Messich!
Guardian of the sceond tree
O perilous star of the morning!
Darken my plea!

Strike me lord, strike me!
With your igneous blade
The mark of Pentagrammaton
By which the soul is remade
O' morning star smite me!
Pierce the chambers of my heart
Carve a seat for your bright wisdom
And let profane life depart

My blood is my offering
To the plot of this sacred place
With Lilith-Nachash behind me
Opposite your luminous face

A shadow cast by your fire
From hers is the blood of our race
She who first offered
The poison fruits taste
And guised with temptation
The path towards divine fate
A riddle to solve
A great thirst to sate

O Shaitan above me!
Three who art one
Guide, lord and daimon
Forge flame and sun
I pray you bless me with eminence
And impart your gift
And by resurrection uplift

Resolve this "I" to your aspect
Crowned with horns twain
And armed with the blade
By which I was slain
I pray to know
And I will to be
To become as the monad
By way of trinity
And walk Eden's night path towards God's temple
By the light of the adversary
And by root, heart and crown
Coil about the second tree
