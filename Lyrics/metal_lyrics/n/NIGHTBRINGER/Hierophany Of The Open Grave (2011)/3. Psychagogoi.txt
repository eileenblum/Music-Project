I am the threne singer whose song rouses Death from shadows. She partakes in my revere, and joins with me in cantor and in verse. For I am her muse, the sojourner of tomb incubation. Swathed in grave soil, ash and the shifting shadows of dusk. I wail my threnody with the sepulchral tongue of goetia, and open the gates of twilight to bare the tunnels of Night. It is here that in hymn I proclaim myself Deathâs neophyte and brave a black ocean that knows no shores. I am the dirge harpist whose song brings Death into my heart. She partakes of my flesh and joins with me in the stilling of the breath. For she is my gate the black ship upon the shore of my ascension.
