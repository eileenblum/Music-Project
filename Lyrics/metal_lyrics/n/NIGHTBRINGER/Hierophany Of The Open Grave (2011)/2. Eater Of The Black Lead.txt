Inexorable Death! Thine eminence above man is the very countenance of the Devil. I would make an altar of thine aspect. I would speak thy true name with an act of silence. I would come to be before thee by way of stillness and the Serpent eye, that I might know baptism within thy waters. Death is thy name, yet I name thee God, for there is no other. To thee I give my body like fodder to the grave and offer breath that hath become as the Serpentâs hiss. I exhale from my mouth the flame of an inner fire, the greater âIâ becoming, and let my husk be filled with the wine of the abyss. I am the child of death and dreams who passes beyond death and dreams. Consummation with thy essence, I shall consume mine own death until I hath become the conqueror of death, the Eater of the Black Lead. I am the lampadiphor within the hidden chambers shinning with profound darkness. I am within Death and Death is within me.
