Woe unto ye who aspire not unto the magistry of Death! Ye are as food for the gods. Behold the Great Opposer, thou who art as Death! Oh that I may become at one with mine âothernessâ of being. I seek the smagdarine crown jewel of the victorious conqueror of Eden, Lucifer Trismegistus, Janus-faced daimon. Thou who gazeth upon the Dark Abyss of Silence, Vast Depth of Nothingness, Great Void of Light beyond Light. Oh Highest One, Great Devourer, Universal Solvent, may I become at one with Thee! Bring forth the Flame that cracks the clay and tears the soul to unite the deathless spirit with Death itself. Illuminate me with a scourge of burning cinders that strikes me with the causeless liberty of Thine unfathomable fantasy. The draconian perfection born from thy boundless rebellion. Yea, the Lie that speaks the Truth! For to enter Thine steeping gulf is to rise unto and usurp the Throne of the highest. So may the inverted star that is Thine reflection boil my eyes until formless vision is given, oh ye dazzling burner of shades and extinguisher of the fallen sparks. Godless God, Traceless pilgrim of the Abyss, Nimbus of subterranean suns â Guide me to Thy bottomless peaks!
