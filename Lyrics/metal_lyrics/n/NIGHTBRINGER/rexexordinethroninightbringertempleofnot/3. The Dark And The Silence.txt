I see the world through the eyes of an apparition
I commune with what lies in the earth
I rise as the dark searing flame
Beyond the dark and the reaches of the mind
Voiceless, yet I speak to thee
Bading thee come forth into the cold earth from slumber
For I am the hateful cold, the dark and the silence
I am all, I am nothing
The lifeless tomb is the entrance to this eternity
The rot that sinks below is the sanctus womb
Come forth lost children of the earth and cease thy breath
I rise as the black searing flame
Beyond the dark and the reaches of the mind
Voiceless, yet I speak to thee
Still thy beating heart and forever rest thine eyes
Intern thy weary flesh and lie with us
Let thy blood turn cold
And thou shalt know my embrace
Come forth lost children of the earth
Cease thy breath, still thy beating heart
Forever rest thine eyes
Intern thy weary flesh
Lie with me
