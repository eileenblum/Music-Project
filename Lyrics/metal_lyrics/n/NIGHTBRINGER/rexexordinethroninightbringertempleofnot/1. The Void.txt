Come forth scathing winds
Rid these mortals of their flesh
For it is time to glut the hunger
Of the unending
The ebbing of the blood shall bring the void
Death is the threshold to its gates
To the dark and cold in the nothing beyond
I am the key, messenger of darkness
When the earth is dead and all is not
The void shall consume all
All shall return to Darkness
Existence shall be no more
I shall stalk the earth in shadow
Bearing these words upon manking
And in the eyes of their dying children, they shall see
In the shallow breath of the sick and starving, they shall hear
In the husks of their failing mortality, they shall feel
The great Truth shall be known and all will despair
The Nothing lurks just beyond the horizon
Flesh and blood is all that binds
Ever-failing as life's light grows dim
The end is coming
And all shall be cast to the void
