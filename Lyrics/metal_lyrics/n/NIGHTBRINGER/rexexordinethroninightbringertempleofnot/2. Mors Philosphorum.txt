Mors Philosophorum - in ritual death well fulfill destiny
Our mortal confines are merely vessels spiriting us forth
Into Oblivion
This is the great knowing
This we embrace
Oblivion is our god
Creator and destroyer of all
Darkness shall be our final resting place
The death of the earth is the birth of the void which turns all to nothing
The laments of this world are as hymns to my kind
Stalk in Mist and Shadow
Mors Philosophorm - in ritual death we fulfill destiny
Corrosive waters cleanse us of our mortal dregs
Embracing our beginnings
We are born on the abyss
In the end, nothing existed
