Can you feel the darkness flowing through her veins
Like a rabbit sickness stronger by the day
Feasting on the young, carving flesh from bone
Thirteen pieces, hell is now your home

The wicked
Candles burning black
The wicked
Born of demon seed
The wicked
Bares the devil's mark

Twisting human form into deathlike throes
Howling at the sky, praise the fiend below
Suffer all the children stolen from their sleep
Dead without a grave, their essence she will reap

The wicked
Candles burning black
The wicked
Born of demon seed
The wicked
Bares the devil's mark

Profane the will of god
Death chants usher in new flesh

Red moon
Lucifer rise
Shadow lord
Death rite
Conjured sin
Open throat
Horned saint
Blood throne
Body torn
Flesh divide
Slow burn
Funeral fire
The dead don't die

Can you feel the darkness flowing through her veins
Like a rabbit sickness stronger by the day
Feasting on the young, carving flesh from bone
Thirteen pieces, hell is now your home

The wicked
Candles burning black
The wicked
Born of demon seed
The wicked
Bares the devil's mark

[Spoken:]
I know who you are.
You are the enemy.
Where do you come from?
The dust.
Where do you go to?
The grave.
Yes, we are not ...
And your torment ... is like darkness of the night
And we ... and ... well.
