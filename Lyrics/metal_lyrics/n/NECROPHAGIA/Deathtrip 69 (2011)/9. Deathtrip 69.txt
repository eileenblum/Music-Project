Well Iâm heading for Death Valley once again
Gonna drop some tabs &amp; hang out with my friends
And if the black bus picks usï»¿ up and Charlie says get in now
Well I guess my hands will be dripping with their blood

Well weâre driving up the canyon tonight
And the California sky never seemed so right
When we creepy crawl the house and we get our message out
Casa LaBianca drips with blood
