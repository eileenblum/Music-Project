[Sample - Spoken words]

Starless forest my kingdom
Shedding the skin of man
Salvation (from) mortal disease
Alive in the heart of the damned

[Chorus:]
Gnashing tooth
Ripped flesh (throat)
Slashed with
Feral
Claws
Lycanthrope

At one with shadows
Abomination, a god in itself
I carry the (carnivorous) curse
Harvesting land (for) human cattle

[Chorus:]

[Spoken words]

Jesus wept, upon creation
Even god whispers my name
Stare into eyes
Nothing human remains

[Chorus:]

[Sample - Spoken words]

(Beneath blinding clandestined skies
An infant breathes it's
Last fog filled breath
Consumed by the beast
In it's jaws of death)
