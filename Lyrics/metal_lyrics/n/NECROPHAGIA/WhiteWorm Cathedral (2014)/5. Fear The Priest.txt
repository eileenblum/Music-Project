Black flames burning
Deep within her eyes
The promise of hell
Rotting from inside

Serpentine twisted tongue
Blaspheming their faith
An ornamental offering
(Of) the child it desecrates

Fear the Priest
Let her die
Fear the Priest
The sow is mine...
Mine...

I am no one
I am no one
I am no one

Baptize the crucifix
(By) unholy masterbation
Blood between her thighs
Deflowered through damnation

Pazuzu inhales
Festered vomit cries
It feasts upon the soul
Now the priest shall die
