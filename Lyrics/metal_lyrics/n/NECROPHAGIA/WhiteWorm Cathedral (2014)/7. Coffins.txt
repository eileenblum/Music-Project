Love is a corpse
Dead and gone
Naked on a slab
Pale and blue
Dirty little bitch
Morgue whore
One last stab

Taking it slow
(Like) salt to a slug
His body is cold
Frozen with sin
Penetrated flesh
Sealed with stitch
Deep into her soul

Coffins are for fucking

Death on fire
Temperature rise
Feels so fine
The devil don't care
(She's) gonna fuck lividity
With a crypt kiss
One more time

No more tears
Casket wine flows
Funeral love
With forbidden bliss
Riding angelwood
Frigid and stiff
Only ways she cums...
