Unlife, from the ground below
Hell on earth, and all you know
Moving slowly, jaws of death
Crawling corpses, will not rest

The dead among us rise
The dead among us live
The dead among us feast

Island, poison paradise
Infection spreads, our demise
Putrid bodies, can not rest
Cadaver eyes, craving flesh

The dead among us rise
The dead among us live
The dead among us feast
