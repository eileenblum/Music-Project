Ride upon the husk of man through veiled skies
Throes of blackened earth, cleanse the midnight dead
Dancing water sprites, sing her praise of tears
(Parched) chalice void of blood, crave the virgin braid

Occupy the body
Flesh, blood and bone
Torment the Psythe
Where the godless roam

Psalms read like poison screams of bitter silence
Thy master won't relent 'til three dawns arise
Flight within the coffin beyond the circle of fear
Summon ghastly figures as the 13th hour nears

Occupy the body
Flesh, blood and bone
Torment the Psythe
Where the godless roam
