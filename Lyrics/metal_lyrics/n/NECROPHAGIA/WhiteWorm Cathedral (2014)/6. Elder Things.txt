Blackest hours before dawn
Arkham mist blanketing dread
Sulphur seeping slowly
(Through) Keziahs foul stench

Feast upon witches milk
A dream within a dream
Brown Jenkin warning bite
This house is not as it seems

Sign the book in blood
Steal the babys breath
Feed with her familiar
Inhale the sour scent

Hidden behind the wall
Coven of wayward souls
Everything is nothing
Her touch is bitter cold

[Solo: Scrimm]

Haunting voice slithers
Throught tainted lips
Whispered shunned desires
Exhumed in nightmare shifts
