At one among the shadows
Beneath an alchemist lair
Second age of witches
Breeding death and dispair

Can't see
Can't speak
Can't feel
Can't breathe

Ave, mater suspiriorum
Ave, mater tenbrarum
Ave, mater lachrymarum

Sing the sinful song as we slowly die
Feed the burning fire with eyes watching all sides
To see what lies below
Look beyond the light wearing a cloak of red
Oracle of second sight

Let them now awaken
Scorned from the grave
World with three mothers
Morbid, cruel and depraved
