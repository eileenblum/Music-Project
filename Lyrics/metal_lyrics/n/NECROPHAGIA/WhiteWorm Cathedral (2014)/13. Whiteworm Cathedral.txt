Conjure the words slowly
(Charcoaled) hands upon the skull
Watch the worms divide
Breathing in her call
Rauch into the body
(Ingesting) black unleavened bread
Candles burn the babies fat
Katabasis channels the dead

WhiteWorm Cathedral

[Solo: Scrimm]

Dancing flames of divination
(Devour) blood of the witch
Obscene eyes bleeding fornicate
With the abyss
Screams spit forth, arcane sado rites
Profane the will of death, cast out from light

Praise the witch
Raise the dead
