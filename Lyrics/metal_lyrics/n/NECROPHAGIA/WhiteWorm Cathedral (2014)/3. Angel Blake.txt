Unearth the fiend
Within the field of life
Suffer the children
A willing sacrifice
Choose not the chosen
For they bear thy skin
Run form the light
Angel born of abyss

Cast out the Devil's own
As above, so below

Satan's Skin 666

Bleed the salt of sin
Obey the father's will
Offer her silkend body
Nubile daughter of Hell
Rise from the forest
Amongst an insolent God
Claim thy earthly form
Blood on Satan's Claw

Cast out the Devil's own
As above, so below
Cast out the Devil's own
As above, so below
