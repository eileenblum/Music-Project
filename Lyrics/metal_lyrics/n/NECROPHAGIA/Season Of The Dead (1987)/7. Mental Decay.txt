summoning all the knowledge 
learned from the time of birth 
clouded by a shadow of doom 
guided only by instincts from the past 

feeding on flesh and bowels 
as if it cures the desiase 
cannibalistic epidemic continues 
infecting thousands by the day 
millions shall victim to the plague 

witnessing as far as the eye can see 
desecrated remains that cover the ground 
dried blood encrusted and brown 
rancid stench of defecation 
entrails lie dragged about 

roaming the earth 
wasting, rotting away 
infested with thoughts (of what life used to be) 
no escape from this living hell
