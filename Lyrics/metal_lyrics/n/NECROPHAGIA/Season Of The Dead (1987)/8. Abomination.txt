foretold in may prophecies 
global apocalypse has arrived 
those who lived, wish they were dead 
walk the live of life and death 
radiation that covers the skies 
nuclear mutants holes for eyes 

burnt beyond recognition 
melted flesh nature's disguise 
charred corpses ashes to dust 
malicious cries of unrelenting lust 

mutated victims, dwell underground 
contamination leads to starvation 
water and food supply destroyed 
chemical disease followed by 

diabolical unleashment 
spewing forth an inferno of carnage 
torn wasteland of rubbish and debris 
after the bomb, nothing left to see 

power hungry nations 
technology and science 
prove man's progression is really regression 

war and political violence 
have brought about the end 
blood for blood 
abomination the final godsend
