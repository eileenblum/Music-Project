[inspired by the movie Evil Dead...]

many creatures have come to pass 
ties creeps ever so slowly 
winds of past reflections of the future 
eternal rest no more 

five closed minds 
provoking a force 
necronomicon, book bound in flesh 
source of all that is evil 

ancient slumber, now disturbed 
a welcomed rude awakening 
we come forth upon your summoning 
entering your body 
to control and possess 
our lost souls now live as one 
until we have you all 

waiting eagerly 
we have anticipated this eve 
to fulfill our wrath 

one vacant soul still left 
to join us 
he shall fall like all the others before him
