once parted body and soul 
believed to be the final stage 
man's arrogant perception of the grave 
mausoleum sanctuary of lies 
portal back to the dimension of life 
deceased souls of a wretched past 
far worse than heaven has cast 
rotting dead now brought to life 
supernatural evolution 
creating a new form of man 

power of illusion 
emulate flesh and life 
transcend from their rest 
hunger of the dead pulsates in their blood 

rebirth of the damned 
abhorence of mankind 
raping the law of nature 
break the threshold of time 

resurrected walk amoung the unsuspecting 
growing in vast number 
until the dead outnumber the living 
complete the final seige 
ravage and take absolute control
