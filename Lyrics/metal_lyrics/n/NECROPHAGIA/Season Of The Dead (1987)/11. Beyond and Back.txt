suicide (no will to live) 
so called afterlife (does it exist) 
depression, aggression locked up inside 
is life worth living (it's time to decide) 

your demise, a razor's touch 
were things really that fucked 

burn as you cease to exist 
you leave your body a vapor of mist 
departure enter the unknown 
horrified as the journey continues 
relentless pleas of agony 
visions of grotesques deformities 
remembrance of forgotten memories 
to dwell and rot in purgatory 
I shall never rest peacefully 
in this world of never ending insanity 

forever my soul to be condemned 
misery and suffering (it will never end) 
the shadow of flames by 
restored to flesh and bone 
which mortal birth bestowed upon me 

witnessing what no man should see 
I have learned to live is to be free 
to die by my own hand is blasphemy 
now granted amnesty 
to be spared and shown mercy
