taking away your scared life 
in many ways I shall describe 
suffocation decapitation or twist of the knife 
nihilsm reigning deep inside 

lacerate your skin 
rip it from the bones 
asphyxiated gargles 
you struggle, suffer, moan 

the need to feel you suffer 
grows stronger everyday 
the hatred on my face 
will bring you to your grave 

possessed from outer limits 
watch the blood flow endlessly 
stab and stab repeatedly 
blood instictively begins to clot 
demise draws near 
smell the divine rot 

now watch your crimson as it bleeds 
another victim, another casualty 
out of touch with reality 
on a death trip fantasy 
add another to my killing spree 

the need to feel you suffer 
grows stonger everyday 
the hatred on my face 
will bring you to your grave
