[dedicated to bela lugosi]

a lifeform creature fly by night 
preying on innocent victims 
their ailing bodies filled with fright 

endless torture you will pay 
consuming your blood 
reaping your soul 
ends my lustful rage 

your crucifix can't help 
not backed by faith 
my pleasure is your pain 
I drink your last drop 
as you breathe your last breath 

continued existence 
to my 2000 years of age 
needs mortal blood to survivve 

your dead carcass 
drained of life 
your corpse looks stale 
as it rots in the night 

sunrise brings another day 
rest at dawn 
soon you must slay 

transformation has already begun 
you will soon feel the urge to feast on the living 
and taste their blood 

endless torture 
you will pay 
consuming your blood 
reaping your soul 
ends my lustful rage
