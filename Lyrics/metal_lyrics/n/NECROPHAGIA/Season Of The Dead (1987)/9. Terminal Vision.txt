conjure the spirits which may not choose to believe 
mystical visions start to appear 
motionless poised reaction 
controlled by internal fear 

beads of perspiration 
follow in hastened sequence 
I'm beyond the realms of tranquility 
distortion outrage cerebral dismal 
compelled by a joyous feeling of rage 

instigating homicidal craze 
implant seeds of hate 
creating images of horror 

powers which mankind refuses to condone or conceive 
beware what curiosity and ignorance breed 
for what is not believed 
may turn out to be your destiny
