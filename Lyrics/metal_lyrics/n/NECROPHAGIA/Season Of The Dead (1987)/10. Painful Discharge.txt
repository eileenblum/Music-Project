I lust for your pain 
classified sadistically insane 
try to survive 
run but you can't hide 
within my grasp, tense with fear 

I'm on the hunt 
a psychopathic rage 
next victim soom will die 
sadistic grunt, post mortal cries 

scream writhe in sweat 
painful discharge 
I tear your limbs apart 
death now descends 
rip out your heart there is no one like me 
I have no remorse or pity 
walk among the night if you dare 
I have no name 
I'm your worst fucking nightmare 

my satisfacation 
instinctive reaction 
to my blackened soul 
I have no control 
kill at command 
no need to understand 
why it has chosen me
