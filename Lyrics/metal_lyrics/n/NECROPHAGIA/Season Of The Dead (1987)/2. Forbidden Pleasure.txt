confusion starts to fade 
I lay in a pool of blood 
cold chills under my skin 
a sign my life's coming to an end 

cloud of mist 
I travel at light speed 
the tunnel of life escaping me 
burning grip takes hold as I die 

sulfuric gas collides with acid rain 
my body burns 
everlasting pain 
a lost soul searching for domain 

I beg for mercy 
my torture never stops 
endless hemorrhage 
suffering for the sins of life 

forbidden pleasure 
the rite to live 
a time to die!
