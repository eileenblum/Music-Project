Look into my eyes
There's no sign of life
Fabled tales of daemon
Caress temptations bliss
Like a splintered finger
Removing poison from her lips

Crawl into your brain
Transforming thoughts to pain
Tainted blood awakens
Driving you insane

The pulse of hybrid gods
Rages through my veins
Souls left screaming
Abandoned by weeping graves

Morphing into existence
Skinless forms take shape
Scars of apocalyptic genocide
Born from the seeds of plague
