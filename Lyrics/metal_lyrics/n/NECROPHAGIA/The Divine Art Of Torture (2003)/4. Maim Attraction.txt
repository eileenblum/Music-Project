For each single hit
Time slowly ticks away
Life has never been more depraved
Will you last an hour
For what it's worth
No skills needed to perform the slay
A gratifying sacrifice
The undisputed highlight of the day

Instant bliss
Is to cast the first stone
Constant bliss
Is to cast the last

Hammering thunders forth
Succumbing to the mass hypnosis
Triggered by the current event
Tortures reaches a new barrier
Abrupt incomprehensive behaviour
Completion of the latest endeavor
The older weapons of mankind
Leave all avolution behind

Disfiguration scores the game
Violence has a new name
Flesh nailed to the ground
Flares of rage compound
Ecstasy beyond control
Last breath through open wounds
Humanility public persecution
