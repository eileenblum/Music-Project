Left to rot
Dried up, dying
Draining life
As we know it

Rotting flesh
Doesn't seem to bad
Compared to the filth
In which we're planted

Beyond magick
I've seen the other side
There's nothing here for me
I crave darkness

Suffer the children
In a paradise lost
A moment frozen
Killed by silence

Echoing forbidden fruits
Nothing but lies
Sins of the father
Passed on like plague

Take me back
To nothingness
Away from the pain
Eternal sleep
Beckons me

We are all
Flowers of flesh and blood
