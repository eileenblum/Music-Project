Haunting visions
Addicted to gore
Crimson images
Living for horror
Fucked up mind
(I was) born this way
Nightmare concert
Cat in the brain

Cannibals, torture
Blood, guts, gore
Giallo, slasher, horror
Spiders, coffins, crypts
Violence and mutilation

I dream of sleeping
Along side of the dead
The comfort of maggots
That live in my head
Blessed by macabre hands
Becoming deaths whore
(My bible) inked in blood
(It's called) rue morgue
