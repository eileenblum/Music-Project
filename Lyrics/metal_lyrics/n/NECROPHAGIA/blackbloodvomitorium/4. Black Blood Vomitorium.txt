A Black shadow guides my way
Sulfur burns my eyes
Macabre visions dull my senses
I walk through the gate
Consuming my soul, cleansing the
Pain of life
Orgies of deprivation, mutation
With the beast, born under the
Morning star, hymns of the locust
Swarm turn to deafening screams
Of unnatural lust, the smoke of
Burning angels provide an incense
Of grandiour, animated corpse like
Creatures vomit forth a black elixir
of unlife, I drink from the skull
Goblet of Christ denied enter
the paradise of pain. I am home!
