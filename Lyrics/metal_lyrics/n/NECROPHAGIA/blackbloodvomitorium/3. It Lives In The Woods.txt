Impaled by a shroud of light
Sacred words, slowly spoken
New moon reaps demonic awakenings

Obscure rite of passage
Unify the circle of Black
Ghouls of Uncreation
Evoked from sins of the past

Entering your body to control
and possess
It Lives in the woods

Transformation human to beast
Candiru forces consume what
The forest has unleashed
Withered remains, summon
Extinction, suffer their burning
Touch, the woods are alive
We now become one
Join us

Nocturno Demondos
