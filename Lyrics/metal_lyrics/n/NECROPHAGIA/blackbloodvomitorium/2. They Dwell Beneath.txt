Existing through damnation
Dark angels sing their praise
Souls of endless hate
Crowning their god of pain

Spawned at the dawn of time
Condemned at birth living far below
Travel as the worm

Nocturnal eyes to guide
Long buried and forgotten
Necromantical beasts
Consume the dead and rotting

Crucified human damnation as the
Soilent demons breathe dawn
Of the ancient ones apocalyptic
Prophecy

THEY DWELL BENEATH

Desolate angel born of hate
Free to roam, Impending fate
Rise above funeral Nation
Enter the kingdom
-children of abomination
