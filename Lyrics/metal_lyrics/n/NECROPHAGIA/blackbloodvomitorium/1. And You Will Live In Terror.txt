Blasphemer, crucified like a
Religious icon from the past
Buried secrets of Eibon, Unholy
Plague Room 36
Fatal reaction upon mortal
Incompetance

AND YOU WILL LIVE IN TERROR [x4]

Seven gates to Hell, sealed in
Seven cursed places, eternal
Madness conveys the sins of humanity
Drowning in a sea of darkness
Schwiek lives

AND YOU WILL LIVE IN TERROR [x4]

Only blinded eyes, can see
A future of nothingness, a
Gateway to the end and all that
Man has known, and you will live
In terror

And you will live in terror...
