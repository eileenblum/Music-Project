Calling to me, coming for me
Velvet flesh, howling in lust
Possession, of my soul

Cadavera
Cadavera comes for me

I dream of demons
Broken wings bleed
I dream of demons
And her touch
I dream of demons
Every night
I dream of demons
And demons I fuck!

Burning eyes, eternal pain
Feeding me, feeding desires
Obedience, for my love
Claw my flesh, oh, claw my flesh

I offer my left hand
I swear devotion
By these numbers
666
