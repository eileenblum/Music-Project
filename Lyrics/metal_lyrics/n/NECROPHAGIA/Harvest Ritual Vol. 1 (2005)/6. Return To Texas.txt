Return to Texas
The grill is on
Meat hook sharpened
And so is the saw

Morbid fascination
Carved flesh from bone
What we call hell
They call home

Return to Texas

Ghouls by moonlight
(Dead) bodies decorate
Macabre family value
Souvenirs from the grave

Victims slowly killed
Corralled and gathered
A cannibal ritual feast
Consuming human cattle
