Fill my soul
With images of hate
Blood upon my hands
Baptize the carcass
She now understands

Sewing the shards of flesh
Velvet suit of skin
I own the shadows
A tailor of the dead

Stitch her further, before I'm caught
Stitch her further, before she rots

Blindfolded eyes
Dripping forbidding tears
Now I'm going to fuck
This cold cadaver bitch

What a life, pills and needles
What a life

She bleeds pure beauty
Lifeless and model size
Poster girl of teenage lust
Pin-up vixen death
