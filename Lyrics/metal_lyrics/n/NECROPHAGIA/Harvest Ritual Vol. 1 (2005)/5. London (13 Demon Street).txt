Crawl into our churches
Beneath feels to fuck
Candles light the way
And Puritan pain is God

London 13 demon street [2x]

See the laughter witch
Beyond the hallowed name
Read by Devil silence
Bloodgutter in all day

London 13 demon street [2x]

Be our next victim, call in strings of blood
Tortured forth by satanic sex
Salvation is at hand, Prepare to be slaved

Crawl into our churches
Beneath feels to fuck
Candles light the way

London 13 demon street [2x]
