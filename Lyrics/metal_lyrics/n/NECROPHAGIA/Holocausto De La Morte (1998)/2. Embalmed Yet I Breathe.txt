Buried Deep Beneath Spoiled Ground
My Body Craves Formaldehyde Withdrawls
Lying Within dampened Rot
Memories Return And Fade
Casket Sealed Shut
Still I Remain
Alive Undead
Decrepit Breath
Rotting Limbs
I Am An Abortion
From The Crypt
Dissection Stiches
Along My Chest
Strain To Keep My Organs Inside
A Lair Of Maggots
Imbedded In My Brain
I Hear Their Thoughts
As They Guide My Way
Inhuman Craving
For Salted Flesh
A Funeral Birth
I Shall Never Rest
Down Below The Cold Earth
Decrepit Breath
Rotting Limbs
I Am An Abortion
From The Crypt
Dissection Stiches
Along My Chest
