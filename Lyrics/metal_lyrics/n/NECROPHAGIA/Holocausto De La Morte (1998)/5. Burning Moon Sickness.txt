I Lay To Waste
Mistakes Created
Human Skin LAnterns
Light My Way
Anoiting The Dead
I Live On
Decades Pass
With Each
Burning Candle
Their Race Slowly Dies
Helpless Screams Unleashed
Gas Chambers Await
Tattooed Hairless Goat Victims
Christened By Burning Moon Sickness
Corpses Consumed
In a Monolith Grave
Procreate
Your Fate
Burning Bodies
End Disgrace
