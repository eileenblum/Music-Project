Ritual Mutilation
Each Worse Than Before
My Reason to Exist
Blaspheme in Endless Gore
Perversion Fueled In Lust
Carried Out At Will
Dominating Urge
Through The Eyes Of The Dead
I Kill
Skinned Alive
Now Left To Rot
Flesh Consumed
With Vomitous Bloodclots
Like A Fulci Nightmare
Twisted And Grotesque
Take My Hand
The Touch Of Death
Through The Eyes Of The Dead I Kill
Inhuman Beast
Regurgitating Laughter
As I Choke On Bile
Consumation Of The Dead
God Forsaken Necrophile
