Cold Meat
Lies Beneath Me
I can Feel Her Breath
Frigid Limbs So Stiff
I Can Hear Her Scream
No Movement As I Inflict Pain
Masochistic Lust, Forever Be My Slave
Beautiful dead Body Will Never See A Grave
Her Stench Overwhelmes My Blood Splattered Lust
A Hunger With No End
Engorged With The Pleasure
Of Her Rotting Flesh
There Was Blood everywhere
She Will Have To See
The Rape Didn't End With Her
Final Breath
Eternally She Will Scream
There Was Blood Everywhere
No Tears Of Pain
A forbidden Kiss
An Ageless Form
On Pale Blue Lips
Forever Confined To
Darkness
