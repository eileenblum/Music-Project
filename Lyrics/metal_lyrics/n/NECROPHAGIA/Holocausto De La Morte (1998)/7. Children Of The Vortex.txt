On His Knees..Jesus Wept
Open The Box
Seal Your Fate
Passage To The Darkside
Which You Create
Lament Configuration Souls Of Hate
Obey Damnation Wrath

Don't Try To BArgain or Pay The Toll
For IF You Cheat Them, They'll Tear Your Soul Apart
Spare No Mercy or Shed A Tear
They Live On Suffering and Strive On Fear
Broken Will To Give
At LAst To Repent
Ruler Of This World
Leviathan
