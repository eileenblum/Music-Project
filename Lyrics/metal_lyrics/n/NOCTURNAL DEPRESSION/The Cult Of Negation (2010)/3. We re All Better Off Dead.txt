I'm drowning into the waters of the oversight
shadows embracing me and the cold devouring me
cause all of you had illustrated the insignificance of being
A life withour values, a useless thing
No one likes us or you above or under
when you'll break the chains and open your eyes, reject their words

We are nothing than empty wrecks
sinking down and reaching the depths into an ocean of despair
We are worthless lives lead by our sufferings
Think about our existence: we are all better off dead

I was born with stigmata on hand
and I use it to feed your hate
May you think to hurt me
but you're human crap that I manipulate

What we've done, our experiences
and past memories
Are carved on our skins
as scars of an inner tormented suffering
We are nothing than empty wrecks,
we are worthless lives

We're all better off dead
