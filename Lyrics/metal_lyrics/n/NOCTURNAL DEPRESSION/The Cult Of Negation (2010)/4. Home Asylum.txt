Welcome to a world of pain where no feelings burn
All my youth are lying on the prison of their minds
A dark corner full of dust, lightless and closed
Their laments and cries for only friends

Hiding on solitude, forgotten by all
The pleasure of pain and heat of their blood
Trapped and forsaken, suicidal thoughts
When children born their first toys are razorblades

They get the knife as the inner suffering explode out
And let its grim tongue lick their skins
They carve with pain on their arms
The death-desire and their love of pain
Blood streaming on the ground from wounds
With tears and sounds of loneliness
They lacerate their faces to destroy ugliness
"Free me from this life"

On corridors, behind dusty walls
Some bodies rot and the ground is gorged of blood
Guns embracing hands on a last union
They sleep forever, a bullet for brain
All around you can only hear screams and cries
"Enjoy the pleasure of life"
