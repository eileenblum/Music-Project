Night, grim curtain of the day
You seduce me each time you appear
And you plunge the world into a deathlike silence
All your servants are gathered and sing solemnly
Your glory
Hear the calls of crying wolves
All the vermin of the world is waiting for you
All the vermin of the world is waiting for you

A black requiem honoring the majesty of dusk
With the cold breath of northern winds
Like the spectral touch of a buried cadaver
Where every part of darkness lives
All flowers wither

Shadows, grim and mighty shadows
You creep along the dusty soil
In search of any peaceful life to devour
And happiness to wither
Fog, mystic smoke raising from the burial ground

You're the whispers of a dead crying soul

From the dark past
They raise from their graves
My eyes watch them in silence
No word can flee from my throat
Silent soundless screams
My feelings are mixed between pleasure and terror
I know at the end I'm seduced by this nocturnal splendor

Life? Life? Death? Death?
Life deserves nothing than to be destroyed
Death will be my guide
Death will be my guide
I have killed myself
I have killed myself
