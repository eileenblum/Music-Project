Tears are falling like sad autumn Leafs
Time is wasted you've destroyed everything around us
Sadness is embracing me with his cold Arms
Suicide is leading me, you are the Reason to my End
Depression rise again from the Bottom of my Soul
Desecration of my Heart, sentenced to Death
Sorrow is kissing me with her poisoned Lips
Sorrow embracing me and leading me to my Grave
