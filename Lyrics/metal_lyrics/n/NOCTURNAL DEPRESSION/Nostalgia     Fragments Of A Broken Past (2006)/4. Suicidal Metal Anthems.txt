Where are you now my love?
My sweet one,
Where have you gone, my love?
I'm so alone.

I only think of you.
And it drives me down.
I only dream of you.

I'll come to you. Take my hand.
Hold me again. Please take my hand.

Please hold me now, my love.
Where are you now, oh my sweet love.
I raise my fist
To the sky
Swear the ancient oath of black
The lambs shall bleed
Eternally bleed
God is dead and shall forever be

THIS IS REAL BLACK METAL!
Gray leaf kiss the tears,
she fell through dead flesh.
Pain evoked the desire for death,
the decay in the fall.
No wave breaks the water,
quietly kissed by the moonlight.
Red tears intermingle,
with the dead leaf.
Fear that was called love, a dagger
of hate, now sleeping
sound within my heart.
Fear creates the agony, the loneliness,
that covets the decay.
Agony is my desire,
and deep in the fall
death was given to me...
