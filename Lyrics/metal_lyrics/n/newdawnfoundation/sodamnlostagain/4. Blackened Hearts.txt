You're the crack inside my silence
Shadow that blinds my eyes
And your heaven is in my hell...

You're pulling me down all night
Ripping my strait so fine
Hate has won all of your love

You're the crack inside my silence
Shadow that blinds my eyes
And your heaven is in my hell..

You're pulling me down all night
Ripping my strait so fine
Hate has won all of your love

You are tear in my eyes
And once again I am born in despair
And left alone so..

I need your sweetness in here
Will you show me how you do
All of your heart invasions
Between me and all of you

But blackened hearts wont seal together
- I will turn and you will go
But blackened hearts wont ruin together
- and we will never be complete..

...and all of me will fall into decay for our love..

You are tear in my eyes
And once again I'm fall in despair
And left alone so..
Because nothing will heal
And nothing will ease me
I will do it again
Come crawling back to you..

I need your sweetness in here
Will you show me how you do
All of your heart invasions
Between me and all of you

...and all of me will fall into decay for our love..

You are tear in my eyes
Once again I am fall in despair
And left alone so..
