I have disappointed more than once
Regretted mistakes one thousand times
And nothing will ever ease me..
Unless you give yourself to me

Give yourself to me
Lose yourself in me
Give yourself to me
Lose yourself, and give yourself to me

I been down so many times
I have felt sorrow and regret in my life
I been wrong since the day I was born

But now you make me feel something more than this
Maybe I could love and be once right
Maybe I could find something to call my own..
(and something to end this mourning..)

And I will give myself to you
I never believed in moments
I have lost myself in moments with you
Will you give yourself to me
Never will I harm you with me
I will always stay here for you

You are something that is not for me
But too dear for me to let you go
You have leaved your sweetness deep into my heart

And I will make all of your dreams come true
If you let me be part of your world
If you let me be me, myself and I

And I will give myself to you
I never believed in moments
I have lost myself in moments with you
Will you give yourself to me
Never will I harm you with me
I will always stay here for you

And I will give myself to you
I never believed in moments
I have lost myself in moments with you
Will you give yourself to me
Never will I harm you with me
I will always stay here for you

Give yourself to me
Lose yourself in me
Give yourself to me
Lose yourself, and give yourself to me

Give yourself to me
Lose yourself in me
Give yourself to me
Lose yourself, and give yourself to me
