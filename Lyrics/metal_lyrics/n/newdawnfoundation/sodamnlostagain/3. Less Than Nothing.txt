So many things were left untold
So many things were left unseen
- but I can't feel it in that way

So many kisses I cannot give
So many kisses I cannot have
- but I will never condescend

And some of us will fall apart
And some of us will learn to love
But none of us will do as I
'cause I will care less than nothing again

So many lies were told to me
So many things that hurt me
- and I will act fine again

So many times I tried this
So many times I failed it
- but I will do it all again

And some of us will fall apart
And some of us will learn to love
But none of us will do as I
'cause I will care less than nothing again

All of these mistakes haunt me
All of these years slip away
Nothing will end this circle
Because I will do this all again

And some of us will fall apart
And some of us will learn to love
But none of us will do as I
'cause I will care less than nothing again
