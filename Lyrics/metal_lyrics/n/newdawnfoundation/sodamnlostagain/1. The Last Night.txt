Stars, oh let them shine, it's the last night to see the light tonight,
Just like every night in this gale
Since you were gone, oh it feels like a thousand years without you,
But now is time to pay the old debt

Bullet is loaded so let it go
And taste desire

Feel my pain now - and release yourself -
Make it go away
My whole life burns without you - as shadows from my heart -
I'm dying every night without you

Hold my breath now tight - that I could sleep -
Don't catch me if I fall
I'm ready to die without you - can't you see that...
I'm dying every night without you

Waves of sadness, wash away my sanity
And tonight, I will leave these nights behind
I need you, to ease me.. I can't do it by myself
Come closer.. will you share the last night with me

Bullet is loaded so let it go
And taste desire
