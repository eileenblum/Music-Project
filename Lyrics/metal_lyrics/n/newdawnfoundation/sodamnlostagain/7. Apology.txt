You been gone for so long
Lost track of time lost the smile from my face

And nothing will change it
I had my time and I am to blame

The year I had with you was the time of my life
I had it all and I am to blame
That now all is gone and nothing will ever change it
All what I can say is please forgive...

You were the one shine for me
- in this darkness I have lost it
And now its too late

And so many things were left to do
- I miss you so that I could fall apart
And no one could ever take your place away from my heart,
From my soul

This is the end, this is the end my love
- so many things were left to say
Never again, never again I swear
- all will fade without you

And so many things were left to do
- I miss you so that I could fall apart
And no one could ever take your place away from my heart,
From my soul

This is the end, this is the end my love
- so many things were left to say
Never again, never again I swear
- all will fade without you

Depression, mind infection
Lost self-control, it's a self-deception
I would die in your arms and born in your heart..

Depression, mind infection
Lost self-control, it's a self-deception
I would die in your arms and born in your heart..
