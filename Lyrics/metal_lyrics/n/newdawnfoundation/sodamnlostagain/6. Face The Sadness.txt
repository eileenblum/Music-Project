You wanna dress in gloominess
Be the one who's not afraid to be, you wanna see the night again
But what about the light of day, will it bring you down like rain
Will it burn your soul and all your dreams, I can't grasp your foolishness

And now you wanna see some seasons change and let all sorrow flow...

So let's face some sadness
Oh, if you really need it I can give you my address
You will lose all of your foolish dreams
...all of your fears..

Can you seal the happiness
Smile in every face and no sorrow... I can't thrust in foolishness
But I can thrust in lack of joy, in pale grace of misery
I will show you how to be alone and how to hide from sun again

And then, no you don't want to seasons change and let all sorrow flow...

So let's face some sadness
Oh, if you really need it I can give you my address
You will lose all of your foolish dreams
... all of your fears..
So let's face some sadness
Oh, I can't thrust my eyes you want all this madness
I will show you how to be afraid and how to be alone

How to see the moon, how to hide from sun
I will bring you down as I will show you how to learn
All the sadness of life, all the sickness of love
Everything that will bring you down as I

So let's face some sadness
Oh, if you really need it I can give you my address
You will lose all of your foolish dreams
...all of your fears..

Are you eager to feel, are you still fading with me
Now you know what it will be, oh I will do it again

I will show you the way, but will you stand 'till the end
Because I will teach you sadness of life, sickness of all love
