you're the crack inside my silence
shadow that blinds my eyes
and your heaven is in my hell..

you're pulling me down all night
ripping my strait so fine
hate has won all of your love

all our lives are past now
all our lives are gone far away

now that everything's alright with you
your sanity ain't right at all
now you're feeling so fine
six feet under you sleep
all is better this way
this lovely way

you are tear in my eye
and once again I fall in despair
and left alone so
I need your sweetness in here
will you show me how you do
all of your heart invasions
between me and all of you

but blackened hearts wont seal together
- I will turn and you will go -
but blackened hearts wont ruin together
- and we will never be complete.. -

..and all of me will fall into decay for our love..

you are tear in my eye
and once again I fall in despair
and left alone so..
cause nothing will heal
and nothing will ease me
I'll do it again
come crawling back to you..

I need your sweetness in here
will you show me how you do
all of your heart invasions
between me and all of you

..and all of me will fall into decay for our love..

you are tear in my eye
once again i fall in despair
and left alone so..
