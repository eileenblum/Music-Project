you been gone for so long
lost track of time lost the smile from my face
and nothing will change it
I had my time and I am to blame

the year I had with you was the time of my life
I had it all and I am to blame
now that all is gone and nothing will ever change it
all that I can say is please forgive..

You were the one shine for me
-in this darkness i have lost it
now its too late

and so many things were left to do
-I miss you so that I could fall apart
and no one could ever take your place away from my
heart, from my soul

this is the end, this is the end my love
- so many things were left to say
never again, never again I swear
- all will fade without you

and so many things were left to do
-I miss you so that I could fall apart
and no one could ever take your place away from my
heart, from my soul

this is the end, this is the end my love
- so many things were left to say
never again, never again I swear
- all will fade without you

depression, mind infection
lost self-control, it's a self-deception
I would die in your arms and born in your heart..
