I'm crawling inside of an empty dream
where you are by my side
I'm loosing all hope of better days
even you were not for real
and my fate is what I seal

you gave a moment of real life
a reminder of what I am
a fool that suppose to feel no love
loosing all of hope
a fool without a home

you told me here is no you or me
some wasted tears and love instead
and I'm still waiting for you my love

one failed moment of you and me
and sadness will pour all over me
and once again the love was lost
in the morning rain

I'm crawling inside of an empty dream
where you are by my side
I'm loosing all hope of better days
even you were not for real
and my fate is what I seal

you told me here is no you or me
some wasted tears and love instead
and once again the love was lost

one failed moment of you and me
and sadness will pour all over me
and I'm still waiting for you my love
in the morning rain

you told me here is no you or me
some wasted tears and love instead
and once again the love was lost

one failed moment of you and me
and sadness will pour all over me
and I'm still waiting for you my love
in the morning rain
