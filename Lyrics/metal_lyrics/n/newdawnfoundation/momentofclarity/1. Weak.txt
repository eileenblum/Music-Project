all of this sadness breaks this harmony
and the whole life will crash down once again
- no forgiveness to this cold life

Fate down, and bring all of this burden
into the place in my mind where feeble can learn of landslide
I'm feared and loathed besides

jaded eyes can see nothing left for me
all pride is gone and here is nothing to love
and everything is so damn lost again
..and I cant see your heart

weak mind, your innocence is so absurd
are you the same as me or are you mourning on command
all this failure is so real to me

I can't feel no approval from ones that I love
this is permanent and I cant stand this hell I feel
..I'm feared and loathed besides

jaded eyes can see nothing left for me
all pride is gone and here is nothing to love
and everything is so damn lost again
..and I can't see your heart

oh my eyes
so jaded now
I can't see, I can't see no more
I'm so jaded to this cold life

this is permanent and I cant stand this hell I feel
..I'm feared and loathed besides
