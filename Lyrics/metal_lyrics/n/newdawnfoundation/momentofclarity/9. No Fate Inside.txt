I yield each day...
this pitiful life flows
and I die once in a day

and the strength that keeps my smile is gone
forever feeling low
I can fall every day

this innate sadness makes me feel
that I have no fate inside
and I will never be what you call a man..
raining Sundays, so fragile moments
I can't ever see how to make a smile
this feeling is so deep inside of me

will I ever learn
how can my pale skin turn to red
will you ever see
me without single tear in my eyes...

which bleed every day
living fear awake
grief will last eternally

and just none will ever love my way
no matter what I say
I will always be alone...

this innate sadness makes me feel
that I have no fate inside
and I will never be what you call a man..
raining Sundays, so fragile moments
I can't ever see how to make a smile
this feeling is so deep inside of me

only purpose of my life
is to serve as a warning
to all of the others

this innate sadness makes me feel
that I have no fate inside
and I will never be what you call a man..
raining Sundays, so fragile moments
I can't ever see how to make a smile
this feeling is so deep inside of me

will I ever learn
how can my pale skin turn to red
will you ever see
me without single tear in my eyes..
