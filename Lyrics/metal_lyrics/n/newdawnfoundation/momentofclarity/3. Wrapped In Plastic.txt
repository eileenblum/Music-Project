now itâs so dark here she is missed by everyone
today was her funeral, the biggest occasion in town

her final show

behind the curtains she was a different girl
now only her diary can tell us what she was like

wrapped in plastic all alone
washed from river at morning dawn
naked and against the rocks
sweetest girl is dead and flogged

she never knew the joy that a little love can bring
never ever will the light shine in her eyes again

wrapped in plastic all alone
washed from river at morning dawn
naked and against the rocks
sweetest girl is dead and flogged
her arms bend back, and she can see the light and feel alive
now that she's gone, she's feeling fine tonight and every night
