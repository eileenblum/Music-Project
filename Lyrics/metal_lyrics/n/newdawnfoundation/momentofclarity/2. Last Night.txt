Stars, oh let them shine, it's the last night to see the light
tonight, just like every night in this gale
since you were gone, oh it feels like a thousand years
without you, but now is time to pay the old debt

bullet is loaded so let it go
and taste desire

feel my pain now
make it go away
my whole life burns without you
I'm dying every night without you

hold my breath now tight
don't catch me if I fall
I'm ready to die without you
I'm dying every night without you

waves of sadness, wash away my sanity
and tonight, I will leave these nights behind
I need you, to ease me.. I can't do it by myself
come closer.. will you share the last night with me

bullet is loaded so let it go
and taste desire
feel my pain now
make it go away
my whole life burns without you
I'm dying every night without you
hold my breath now tight
don't catch me if I fall
I'm ready to die without you

I'm dying every night without you

feel my pain now
make it go away
my whole life burns without you
I'm dying every night without you

feel my pain now
make it go away
my whole life burns without you
I'm dying every night without you
hold my breath now tight
don't catch me if I fall
I'm ready to die without you

I'm dying every night without you

now were falling down
now were falling down
now were falling down
