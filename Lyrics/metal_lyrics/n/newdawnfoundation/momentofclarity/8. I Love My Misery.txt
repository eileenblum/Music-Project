we are not the same we are different kinds
and you think I'm going down
you are so right it's the way I am
and I love my way
you believe in your fate in religious lies
no I can't see the light
I don't wanna feel it I don't wanna know
words that make you down

in some twisted way.. I love my misery

every second of day
and everything that you do
you're afraid that
they don't love your way
can't you see what they doing to you
you have to let it go

close your eyes just one time
and see the world with my eyes
can't you see
I'm just too fool to die

I'm the one you should not care
as I love my misery

you will give your life, you will give your soul
and you think that you are so fine
it's artificial feeling, an illusion of life
sailing in that ship of fools
I'd rather be alone, I'd rather drown in your eyes
now you can't see the light
you're growing sadness deep inside of you
and you try to hide it
please let me show.. how to love misery

you can't change the way I am
I fall each day
in some twisted way.. I love my misery

every second of day
and everything that you do
you're afraid that
they don't love your way
can't you see what they doing to you
you have to let it go

close your eyes just one time
and see the world with my eyes
can't you see
I'm just too fool to die

I'm the one you should not care
as I love my misery

you can't change the way I am
I fall every day
in some twisted way.. I love my misery

every second of day
and everything that you do
you're afraid that
they don't love your way
can't you see what they doing to you
you have to let it go

close your eyes just one time
and see the world with my eyes
can't you see
I'm just too fool to die

I'm the one you should not care
as I love my misery

I love my misery - just too fool to die
I love my misery - just too fool to die
I love my misery - just too fool to die
I love my misery - just too fool to die
I love my misery - just too fool to die

you are so right - it's the way I am
you are so right - it's the way I am
