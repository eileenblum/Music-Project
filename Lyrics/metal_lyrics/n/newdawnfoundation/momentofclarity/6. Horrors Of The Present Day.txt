this is the end of normal life

I cant see much hope in our situation...
even though it's all
I would ever want.
I could ever need

will I ever heal from the wounds that you left
here in my heart
some wounds so deep even time can't heal em

as long as I can feel, I want you here with me..
you leaved me every morning..
this one final time, now took it all

end of everything night after night
this is the end of normal life
end of everything night after night
this is the end of normal life

all of my tears won't take the pain away
- life is on it's end
all of our nights you let them go away..
- I can't trust my eyes
all of my fears you let them come to life
- horrors of the present day
all of my life I'll give to you
- this one final time

most beautiful of them all, eternally you shall be
like a long lost friend
I yearn your touch I yearn everything in you

end of everything night after night
this is the end of normal life
end of everything night after night
this is the end of normal life

all of my tears won't take the pain away
- life is on it's end
all of our nights you let them go away..
- I can't trust my eyes
all of my fears you let them come to life
- horrors of the present day
all of my life I'll give to you
- this one final time

all of my tears won't take the pain away
all of our nights you let them go away..
all of my fears you let them come to life
all of my life I'll give to you
- this one final time
