you were driven apart from me
- it's so cold without you -
love has died so many times
- but not in so painful way -

and you will always remain here in my heart
why you had to go so young, I fall anyway

deep is this sadness
now everything is so damn far away
and love is hurting, I won't seal my fate..
I lose anyway

so empty is my heart without you
- only you ever made me smile -
I hope you're fine wherever you are

and you will always remain here in my heart
why you had to go so young, I fall anyway

deep is this sadness, now everything is so damn far away
and love is hurting, I wont seal my fate.. I lose anyway

all what is precious, my worthless life is tearing me apart
night of the living death.. why you had to go so young I lose anyway

I lose anyway
I lose anyway
all life, all life

all life is losing
please let me drown
I never claimed that life is easy

all life is losing
please let me drown
I never claimed that life is easy
