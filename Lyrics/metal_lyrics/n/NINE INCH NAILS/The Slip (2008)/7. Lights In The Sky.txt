She's mostly gone
Some other place
I'm getting by
In other ways
Everything they whispered in our ear
Is coming true
Try to justify the things
They used to do
Believe in you

Watching you drown
I'll follow you down
I am here right beside you
The lights in the sky
Have finally arrived
I am staying right beside you

I tried to stay away
Just in case
I've come to realize
We all have our place
Time time has a way you know
To make it clear
I have my role in this
I can't disappear
Or leave you here

Watching you drown
I'll follow you down
I am here right beside you
The lights in the sky
Are waving goodbye
I am staying right beside you
