Am I still tough enough?
Feels like I'm wearing down
Is my viciousness
Losing ground?
Am I taking too much
Did I cross a line
I need my role in this
Very clearly defined
I need your discipline
I need your help
I need your discipline
You know once I start I cannot help myself

And now it's starting up
feels like I'm losing touch
Nothing matters to me
Nothing matters as much
I see you left a mark
Up and down my skin
I don't know where I end
And
where you begin
I need your discipline
I need your help
I need your discipline
You know once I start I cannot help myself
Once I start I cannot stop myself
