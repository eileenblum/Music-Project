Some say it was a warning
Some say it's a sign
I was standing right there
When it came down from the sky
The way it spoke to us
You felt it from inside
Said it was up to us
Up to us to decide
"you've become a virus
Killing off his host
We been watching you with all our eyes
And what you seem to value most
So much potential
Or so we used to say
Your greed, self-importance and your arrogance
You piss it all away
We heard her cry
We have come to intervence
You will change your ways and you will make amends
Or we will wipe this place clean!"

Your time is ticking away
