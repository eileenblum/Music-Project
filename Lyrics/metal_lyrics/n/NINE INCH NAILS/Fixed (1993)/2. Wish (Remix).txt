this is the first day of my last days
I built it up now I take it apart
climbed up real high now fall down real far
no need for me to stay
the last thing left I just threw it away
I put my faith in god and my trust in you
now there's nothing more fucked up I could do

wish there was something real wish there was something true
wish there was something real in this world full of you

i'm the one without a soul i'm the one with this big fucking hole
no new tale to tell twenty-six years on my way to hell
gotta listen to your big time hard line bad luck fist fuck
don't think you're having all the fun
you know me I hate everyone

wish there was something real wish there was something true
wish there was something real in this world full of you

I want to but I can't turn back
but I want to
