I'm goin' back
Of course I am
As if I ever had a choice
Back to what I always knew I was
On the inside
Back to what I really am
Look at this pathetic place I made
With little bits of sticks and hair, and anything I found along the way
And tell yourself you know
You're not really what you know you are, you know?
Of course you do
I think I may have listened to you
I think I may have even, listened to you!
At the height of my demise

(Breathe, breathe, breathe)
Break through the surface and
(Breathe, breathe, breathe)
Break through the surface and
(Breathe, breathe, breathe)
Break through the surface and
(Breathe, breathe, breathe)
Break through the surface and

I am forgiven, I am free
I am a field on fire
I am forgiven, I am free
I am a field on fire

Oh my god I missed you, it's been so long
I am stronger than I have ever been in my decline
Now I know, I know, I know for certain
Now I know, for certain
Shedding any
Burn, motherfucker!
Carry the carcass and throw it on
Pull up a chair and watch
The flies come roaring out
And will surround the entire world
And blacken out the sky and every last one of you
Like a plague of locusts
Like an exit, like an end, like the end

(Breathe, breathe, breathe)
Break through the surface and
(Breathe, breathe, breathe)
Break through the surface and
(Breathe, breathe, breathe)
Break through the surface and
(Breathe, breathe, breathe)
Break through the surface and

I am forgiven, I am free
I am the field on fire
I am forgiven, I am free
I am the field on fire

I am forgiven, I am free
I am the field on fire
I am forgiven, I am free
I am the field on fire

It's getting hard to know which side is the dream
I can't tell if I am dreaming anymore
