Yes, everyone seems to be asleep

Hey look, you didn't even know this
Couldn't even tell
Just when it started... happening
Maybe just as well
After all, everything is getting unfamiliar now
Trajectory in decline
And we've become obsolete
A frame at a time

I'm locked inside here
Have to stay
With people who aren't here
All the way

Pictures and faces
On display
With people who aren't here
All the way (all the way)...

It is coming, and you didn't even notice, yeah you didn't even notice... (you were missing)...

[Left channel:]
Dear world, I can hardly recognize you anymore
And yet I remain certain
There is an answer in you
I feel like I have lived so long sometimes
Run out of things to try to do
I can't concentrate my way out
What about?...
I have been entirely patient
No, no, not this time

[Right channel:]
I am leaving because I can't recognize who I have been
You go on spoiling
Hey look, it's happening
Without me you didn't even notice
Of course it's been happening all along, permanent intervals
As you become obsolete, who are you?
Oh this place...
I can't concentrate
I begin to go through another of that we have been
But I know I can't trust myself with this again

I'm locked inside here
Have to stay
With people who aren't here
All the way

Pictures and faces
On display
With people who aren't here
All the way (all the way)
All the way (all the way)
All the way (all the way)

Yes, everyone seems to be asleep
