Still can make out pieces with the opening sewed shut
Yeah, parts of me are slowing down, time is speeding up
Spiders crawling everywhere, infected Japanese
You can tell all your friends you're just a tourist, but you can't understand what they have planned until you try to leave

Feels like I've been here before
Yeah, I don't know anymore
And I don't care anymore
Feels like I've been here befo-

Cold and black and infinite, with nothing left to lose
If you try to keep the flies away, the makeup hides the bruise
Her branches are the bones that break, become a perfect line
And no he won't just be a man who's sometimes, he won't just be a man who's sometimes...

Feels like I've been here before
Yeah, I don't know anymore
And I don't care anymore
I think I recognize

Yes, I have been here before
Yeah, I don't care anymore
Don't give a fuck anymore
Yeah, I don't care...
