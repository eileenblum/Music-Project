[Vinyl version only]

I'm getting closer,
I'm getting closer,
I'm getting closer,
I'm getting closer,
All the time,
I'm getting closer,
All the time,
I'm getting closer,
I'm getting closer,
All the time,
I'm getting closer,
I'm getting closer,
I'm getting closer,
I'm getting closer,
I'm getting closer,
I tried to get so high,
I made it 10 miles high,
I'm gonna get so high,
I'm gonna get so high,
You'll never get inside,
I swore I'd never turn into you,
I'm going to all the time,
I made it 10 miles high,
If you're not truthfull I'm not a lie,
I swore to god I would never turn into you,
I'm getting closer,
All the time.
Tear it all down.
