I still recall the taste of your tears
Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore
Scraping through my head 'till I don't want to sleep anymore

Come on tell me
Make this all go away
You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing
And I'm starting to scare myself
Make this all go away
You make this all go way
I just want something
I just want something I can never have

You always were the one to show me how
Back then I couldn't do the things that I can do now
This is slowly taking me apart
Grey would be the color if I had a heart

I just want something I can never have

In this place it seems like such a shame
Though it all looks different now, I know it's still the same
Everywhere I look you're all I see
Just a fading fucking reminder of who I used to be

Come on tell me
Make this all go away
You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing
And I'm starting to scare myself
Make this all go away
You make this all go way

I just want something
I just want something I can never have
I just want something I can never have

Think I know what you meant
That night on my bed
Still picking at this scab
I wish you were dead
You sweet and Perry Ellis
Just stains on my sheets
