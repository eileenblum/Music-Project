starring at the sea
will she come ?
is there hope for me
after all is said and done
anything at any price
all of this for you
all the spoils of a wasted life
all of this for you
all the world has closed her eyes
tired faith all worn and thin
for all we could have done
and all that could have been
ocean pulls me close
and whispers in my ear
the destiny I've chose
all becoming clear
the currents have their say
the time is drawning near
washes me away
makes me disappear
i descend from grace
in arms of undertow
i will take my place
in the great below
i can still feel you
even so far away
