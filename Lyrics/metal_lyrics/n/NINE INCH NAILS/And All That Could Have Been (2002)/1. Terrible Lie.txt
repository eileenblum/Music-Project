hey god, why are you doing this to me ?
am I not living up to what I'm supposed to be ?
why am I seething with this animosity ?
hey god, I think you owe me a great big apology
terrible lie
terrible lie
terrible lie
terrible lie
hey god, I really don't know what you mean
seems like salvation comes only in our dreams
I feel my hatred grow all the more extreme
hey god, can this world really be as sad as it seems
terrible lie
terrible lie
terrible lie
terrible lie
don't take it away from me
I need someone to hold on to
don't take it away from me
I need someone to hold on to
hey god, there's nothing left for me to hide
I lost my ignorance, security and pride
I'm all alone in a world you must despise
hey god, I believed that promises, your promises and lies
terrible lie
terrible lie
terrible lie
terrible lie
you made me throw it all away
my morals left to decay
how many you betray
you've taken everything
terrible lie
terrible lie
terrible lie
terrible lie
my head is filled with disease
my skin is begging you please
I'm on my hands and knees
I want so much to believe
terrible lie
terrible lie
terrible lie
terrible lie
I give you everything
my sweet everything
hey god, I really don't know who I am
in this world of piss
