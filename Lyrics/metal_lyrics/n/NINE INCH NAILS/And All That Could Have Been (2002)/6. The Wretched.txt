just a reflection
just a glimpse
just a little reminder
of all the what abouts
and all the might have
could have been
another day
some other way
but not another reason to continue
and now you're one of us
the wretched
the hopes and prays
the better days
the far aways
forget it
it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to
it didn't turn out the way you wanted it, did it ?
it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to
it didn't turn out the way you wanted it, did it ?
now you know
this is what it feels like
now you know
this is what it feels like
the clouds will part and the sky cracks open
and god himself will reach his fucking arm
through
just to push you down
just to hold you down
stuck in his hole with the shit and the piss
and it's hard to believe it could come down to this
back at the beginning
sinking
spinning
and in the end
we still pretend
the time we spend
not knowing when
you're finally free
and you could be
but it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to
it didn't turn out quite the way you wanted it
now you know
this is what it feels like
now you know
this is what it feels like
you can try to stop it but it keeps on coming
you can try to stop it but
