sunspots cast a glare in my eyes
sometimes i forget I'm alive
i feel it coming and I've got to get out of his way
i hear it calling and i come because i can't disobey
i should not listen and i should not believe but i do

she turns me on
she makes it real
i have to apologize for the way i feel

my life it seems has taken a turn
why in the name of god would i ever want to return
peel off our skin we're gonna burn what we were to the ground
fuck in the fire and we'll spread all the ashes around
i want to kill all the rest of what's left and i do

she turns me on
she makes it real
i have to apologize for the way i feel

and nothing can stop me now
there is nothing to fear
and everything I'd ever want
is inside of here

no...  no...  no...  no... inside of here
now i just stare into the sun
and i see everything I've done
i think i could have been someone
but i can't stop what has begun
when everything is said and done
and there is no place left to run
i think i used to be someone
and now i just stare into the sun
