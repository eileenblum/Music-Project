she comes along
she gets inside
she makes you better than anything you've tried
it's in her kiss
concealed in her kiss
the blackest sea
and it runs deeper than you dare to dream it could be

wi-th tee-th...

wave goodbye
to what you were
the roles are changed
the lines begin to blur
she you hard
it comes on strong
you finally found the place where you belong

wi-th tee-th...

i cannot go through this again...

wi-th tee-th...

she'll will not let you go
keeps holding on
this time I'm not coming back
she'll will not let you go
