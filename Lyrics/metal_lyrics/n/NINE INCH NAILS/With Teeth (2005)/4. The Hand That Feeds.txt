you're keeping in step... in the line
got your chin held high and you feel just fine
'cause you do... what you're told
but inside your heart it is black, it is hollow and it's cold

just how deep do you believe?
will you bite the hand that feeds?
will you chew until it bleeds?
can you get up off you knees?
are you brave enough to see?
do you want to change it?

what if this whole crusade's a charade?
and behind it all is a price to be paid
for the blood, on which we dine
justified in name of the holy and the divine

just how deep do you believe?
will you bite the hand that feeds?
will you chew until it bleeds?
can you get up off you knees?
are you brave enough to see?
do you want to change it?

so naive...
i keep holding on to what i want to believe
i can see...
but i keep holding on and on and on and on and on...

will you bite the hand that feeds you?
will you stay down on your knees?
will you bite the hand that feeds?
