there are things that i said i would never do
there are fears that i cannot believe will come true
so my soul is too sick and too little not too late
and myself...  i have grown too weary to mate

the more i stay in here
the more it's not so clear
the more i stay in here
the more i disappear
as far as i have gone
i knew what side I'm on
but now I'm not so sure
the line begins to blur

is there somebody on top of me?
i don't know...  i don't know...
isn't anyone stopping me
i don't know...  i don't know...
why am i trying to hold my breath
i don't know...  i don't know...
just how far down can i go?
i don't know...  i don't know...  i don't know...

as i lie here in still
the fabric starts to tear
it's far beyond repair
and i don't even care
as far as i have gone
i knew what side I'm on
but now I'm not so sure
the line begins to blur
