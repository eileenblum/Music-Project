getting a little erratic here
and i don't know who to trust
i guess they got a way of reading my mind
i guess I've got to adjust
I've got my arms that flip flop flip flop flip
i got my hair on a spring
well i thought i got you on my side...
i haven't got fucking anything

I'm just a face in the crowd
nothing to worry about
not even try to stand out
I'm getting smaller and smaller and smaller
and I've got nothing to say
it's all been taken away
i just behave and obey
I'm afraid I'm starting to fade away

uh huh..

i cannot see through the cracks
when i was up on the wall
I'm not looking to stand up real high
I'd be happy to crawl
i think I'm losing my grip
but i can still make a fist
you know I've still got my one good arm
and i can... mmm i can beat myself for this

I'm just a face in the crowd
nothing to worry about
not even try to stand out
I'm getting smaller and smaller and smaller
and I've got nothing to say
it's all been taken away
i just behave and obey
I'm afraid that I'm starting to fade away

hey and for what it is worth
i used to really believe
but maybe that's some great thing
that we could achieve
and now i can't tell the difference
don't know what to feel
between what I've been trying so hard to see
and what appears to be real

I'm fading away...

my world is getting smaller every day and that's okay...
