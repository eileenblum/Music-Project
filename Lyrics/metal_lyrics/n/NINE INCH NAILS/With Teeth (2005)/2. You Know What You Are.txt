I tried to send myself through -- tried to get to the other side
I had to patch up the cracks and the holes that I have to hide
found a little bit of time even made it work okay
just found enough to make it really hurt
when they figured me out and it all just rotted away

don't you fucking know what you are?
you all get back to where you belong

you better take a good luck because I'm full of shit
don't rebuild my heart I don't try to believe in it
you can push it all out  -- you can try to pretend
but you can't change anything -- you can't change anything in the end

don't you fucking know what you are?
you all get back to where you belong
don't you fucking know what you are?

remember what you are
remember where you came from

don't you fucking know what you are?
you all get back to where you belong
