I'm becoming less defined as days go by
fading away and well you might say I'm losing focus
kind of drifting to the abstract in terms of how i see myself
sometimes i think i can see right through myself

less concerned about fitting into the world
you're world that is
'cause it doesn't really matter anymore
none of this sh...

and yes i am alone then again i always was
as far back as i can tell i think maybe it's because...
you were never really real to begin with
i just made you up to hurt myself
yeah, i just made you up to hurt myself
and it worked... yes it did

there is no you
there is only me
there is no fucking you
there is only me

only...

well the tiniest little dot caught my eye
and it turned to be a scab
and i had this funny feeling like i just knew it's something bad
i just couldn't leave it alone... picking at this scab
it was a doorway trying to seal itself shut, but i climbed through

no I'm somewhere i am not supposed to be
and i can see things i know i really shouldn't see
and now i know why... n-now i know why
things aren't as pretty on the inside

there is no you
there is only me
there is no fucking you
there is only me

only...
