I pick things up... I am a collector
and things... well things tend to accumulate
I have this net... it drags behind me
it picks up feelings for me to feed upon

there are times... plenty of times I wish I could let it go
It's time to breathe and it's time to grow inside me
there are times... plenty of times I wish I could let it go
but this time too many to think... things I don't wanna no

I'm trying to fit it all inside
I'm trying to open my mouth wide
I'm trying not to choke and swallow it all... swallow it all... swallow it all... swallow it all...

I am the pig
I am the swarm
all your heart sticks on me and I'm keepin' it raw
they will make me stay
they won't let me leave
there are so goddamn many of them it gets so hard to breathe

I'm trying to fit it all inside
I'm trying the whole thing on my plate
I'm trying not to choke inside
I am a big boy and I will swallow it all... swallow it all... swallow it all... swallow it all...

Every last one...
