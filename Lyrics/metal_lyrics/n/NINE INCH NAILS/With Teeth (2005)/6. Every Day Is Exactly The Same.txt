i believe i can see the future
because i repeat the same routine
i think i used to have a purpose
then again that might have been a dream
i think i used to have a voice
now i never make a sound
and i just do what i have been told
i really don't want them to come around
oh no...

every day is exactly the same
there is no love here and there is no pain
every day is exactly the same

i can feel their eyes are watching
in case i lose myself again
sometimes i think I'm happy here
sometimes...
sometimes...  yeah, i still pretend
i cannot remember how this got started
oh...  but i can tell you exactly how it will end

every day is exactly the same
there is no love here and there is no pain
every day is exactly the same

I'm writing on a little piece of paper
I'm hoping someday you might find
well I'll hide it behind something they won't look behind
i am still inside...
a little bit comes breathing through
i wish this could've been any other way
but i just don't know...  i don't know what else i can do

every day is exactly the same
there is no love here and there is no pain
every day is exactly the same
