the more that we take
the paler we get
i can't remember what it is
we try to forget
the towel on the floor
so cold it could sting
in your eyes is a place worth remember
for you to go and take this and smash it apart
I've gone all this fucking way
to wind up back at -- back at the start

hey the closer we think we are
well it only got us so far
now 've you anything left to show?
no...  no..  i didn't think so
hey the sooner we realise
we cover ourselves with lies
but underneath we're not so tough
and love is not enough

well it hides in the dark
like the withering vein
we didn't give it a mouth
so it could not complain
you never really had a chance
we'll never really make it through
an everything i believe
i believed i could get better with you

hey the closer we think we are
well it never got us so far
now you've got anything left to show?
no...  no..  no...  no..  i didn't think so
hey the sooner we realise
we cover ourselves with lies
but underneath we're not so tough
and love is not enough

love is not enough...
hey...
