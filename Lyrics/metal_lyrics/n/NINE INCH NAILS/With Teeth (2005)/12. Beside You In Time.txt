i am all alone this time around
sometimes on my side i hear a sound
places parallel i know it's you
feel the little pieces bleeding through

and on...  this goes on...  and on...  and on...  and on...  and on...  and on...  and on...  and on...
this goes on...  and on...  and on...  and on...  and on...  and on...  and on...  and on...

now that I've decided not to stay
i can feel me start to fade away
everything is back where it belong
i will be beside you before long

and on...  this goes on...  and on...  and on...  and on...  and on...  and on...  and on...  and on...
this goes on...  and on...  and on...  and on...  and on...  and on...  and on...  and on...

we will never die...
beside you in time...
