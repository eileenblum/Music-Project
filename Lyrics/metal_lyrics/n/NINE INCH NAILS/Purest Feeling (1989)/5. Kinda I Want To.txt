I can't shake this feeling from my head.
there's a devil sleeping in my bed.
he's watching you from across the way.
I cannot make this feeling go away

I know it's not the right thing.
and I know it's not the good think.
but kinda I want to

i'm not sure of what I should do.
when everything i'm think of is you.
all of my excuses turn to lies.
maybe God will cover up his eyes

I know it's not the right thing.
and I know it's not the good think.
but kinda I want to

maybe just for tonight.
we can pretend it's alright.
what's the price I pay.
I don't care what they say.
I want to.
I want to (i'll take my chance tonight)
