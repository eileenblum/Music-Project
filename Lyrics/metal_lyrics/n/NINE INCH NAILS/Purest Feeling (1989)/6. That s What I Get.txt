just when everything was making sense.
you took away all my self-confidence.
now all that i've been hearing must be true.
I guess i'm not the only boy for you.

but that's what I get
that's what I get
that's what I get
that's what I get

how could you turn us into this?
after you just taught me how to kiss you.
I told you i'd never say goodbye.
now i'm slipping on the tears you made me cry.

why does it come as a surprise.
to think that I was so naive.
maybe didn't mean so much.
but it meant everything to me.
