it's still getting worse after everything I tried.
what if I found a way to wash it all aside.
what if she touches with those fingertips.
as the words spill out like fire from her lips.

if she says come inside i'll come inside for her.
if she says five it all i'll give everything to her.
I am justified.
I am purified.
I am sanctified.
inside you

Heaven's just a rumor she'll dispel.
as she walks me through the nicest parts of hell.
I still dream of lips I never should have never kissed.
well she knows exactly what I can't resist

i'm just caught up in another of her spells.
she's turning me into someone else.
everyday I hope and pray this will end.
but when I can I do it all again

as surely as the blades course is run.
maybe my kingdom's finally come
