kinda like a cloud I was up way
up in the sky and I was feeling some feelings
you wouldn't believe sometimes
I don't believe them myself and I decided
I was never coming down. just then a tiny little dot
caught my eye it was just about
too small to see. but I watched it way too long
and that dot was pulling me down.

I was up above it.
I was up above it.
now i'm down in it
I was up above it.
I was up above it.
now i'm down in it

well shut up so what what does it matter now.
I was swimming in the haze now I crawl on the ground.
and everything I never liked about you is kind of seeping into me.
try to laugh about it now but isn't it funny how everything works out
("I guess the jokes on me." she said)

I used to be so big and strong.
I used to know my right from wrong.
I used to never be afraid.
I used to be somebody

I used to have something inside
now just this hole that's open wide.
I used to want it all
I used to be somebody

i'll cross my heart and hope to die
but the needle's already in my eye.
and all the world's weight is on my back
and I don't even know why.
and what I used to think was me is just a fading memory
I looked him right in the eye and said "goodbye."
