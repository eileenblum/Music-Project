Only thing I've ever done
/Ticking time is running out/

Closest I've ever come
/Ticking time is running out/

Oh so tired on my own
/Ticking time is running out/

Best days I've ever known
/Ticking time is running out/

Yesterday I found out the world was ending
Yesterday I found out the world was ending

A little more
every day
falls apart and
slips away

I don't mind
I'm okay
wish it didn't
have to end this way


These four walls are closing in
/Ticking time is running out/

Of all the things that might have been
/Ticking time is running out/ yeah

Watch young lovers walking by
/Ticking time is running out/ yeah

God forgive me if I cry
/Ticking time is running out/

A little more
every day
falls apart and
slips away

I don't mind
I'm okay
nothing ever
stays the same

While we can
remember when
always running
even then

Stay with me
hold me near

And I'm still here
