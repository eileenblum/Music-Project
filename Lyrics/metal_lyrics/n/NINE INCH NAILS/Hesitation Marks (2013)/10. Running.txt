I followed you again this morning
Just close enough to feel you near
Pretending everyone could see me
Just slip away and dissapear

They're right behind
There's someone behind you
They're all behind you,
They're on the run
As good as blind,
I'm out of time
Somewhere to find,
So well defined
They're all aligned
They're intertwined
You're undermined
There's someone behind
They recognize,
So hard to find
As good as blind,
I'm out of time

I'm running out of places I can hide from this
I'm running out of places I can hide from this
I'm running out of places I can hide from this
I'm running out of places I can hide from this

I had a friend, I think you knew me
I couldn't seem to make you see
I know they're watching me and falling
I know I'll never get away

I'm running out of places I can hide from this
(I'm running out)
