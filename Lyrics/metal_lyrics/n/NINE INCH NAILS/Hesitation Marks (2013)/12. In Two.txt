Split,
Split into
Something else
Shed
Precious skin.
Save yourself.
We
Have to purge
What you were.

Yes,
Yes of course,
It's gonna hurt.

Nature is violent
The very nature of this is violent
No, no, no, no, no, no, that was someone else
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, that wasn't me

It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart
I can't believe they can ever remember which one you are
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart

Slide,
Just become
Your disease.
Leave
Them behind.
You are free.
Take
What you want.
You deserve.

Yes,
Yes of course,
This is gonna hurt.

It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart
I can't believe they can ever remember which one you are
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart

I just don't know anymore [10x]
I just don't know
