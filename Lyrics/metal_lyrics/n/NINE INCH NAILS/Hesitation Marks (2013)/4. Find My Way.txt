Now my path has gone astray
I'm just tryin' to find my way
Wandered here from far away
I'm just tryin' to find my way...

You were never meant to see
All those things inside of me
Now that you've gone away
I'm just tryin' to find my way...

Uh uh uh ohhh...
Uh uh uh ohhh...
Uh uh uh ohhh... (Ooooooooh)
Uh uh uh ohhh...

I have made a great mistake
Pray The Lord my soul to take
Ghosts of who we used to be
I can feel them come for me
It looks as thought they're here to stay
I'm just tryin' to find my way...

Uh uh uh ohhh...
Uh uh uh ohhh... (Ooooooooh)
Uh uh uh ohhh...
Uh uh uh ohhh...

I have been to everyplace
I have been to everywhere
I'm just tryin' to find my way...

(All I got so far)
