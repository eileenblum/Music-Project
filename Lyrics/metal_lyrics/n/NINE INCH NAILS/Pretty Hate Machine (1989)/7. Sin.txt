You give me the reason.
You give me control.
I gave you my Purity.
My Purity you stole.
Did you think I wouldn't recognize this compromise.
Am I just too stupid to realize.
Stale incense old sweat and lies lies lies

[Chorus:]
It comes down to this.
Your kiss.
Your fist.
And your strain.
It get's under my skin.
Within.
Take in the extent of my sin

You give me the anger.
You give me the nerve.
Carry out my sentence.
Well, I get what I deserve.
I'm just an effigy to be disgraced.
To be defaced.
Well, your need for me has been replaced.
And if I can't have everything well then just give me a taste.

[Chorus]

You give me the reason.
You give me control.
I gave you my Purity.
My Purity you stole.
Did you think I wouldn't recognize this compromise.
Am I just too stupid to realize.
Stale incense old sweat and lies lies lies

[chorus]
