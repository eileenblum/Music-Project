Just when everything was making sense.
You took away all my self-confidence.
Now all that I've been hearing must be true.
I guess I'm not the only boy for you.

[Chorus:]
But that's what I get
That's what I get
That's what I get
That's what I get

How could you turn me into this?
After you just taught me how to kiss you.
I told you I'd never say goodbye.
Now I'm slipping on the tears you made me cry.

[Chorus]

Why does it come as a surprise;
To think that I was so naive.
Maybe didn't mean that much.
But it meant everything to me.

[Chorus]
