It's still getting worse after everything I've tried,
What if I found a way to wash it all inside?
What if she touches with those fingertips?
As the words spill out like fire from her lips.

If she says come inside, I'll come inside for her,
If she says give it all, I'll give everything to her.

[Chorus]
I am justified.
I am purified.
I am sancitifed, inside you.

Heaven's just a rumor she dispells,
As she walks me through the nicest parts of Hell.
I still dream of lips, I never should have kissed,
Well she knows exactly what I can't resist.

And if she says come inside, I'll come inside for her,
And if she says give it all, I'll give everything to her.

[Chorus]

I'm just caught up in another of her spells,
While she's turning me into someone else.
Every day I hope and pray that this will end,
But when I can, I'd do it all again.

And if she says come inside, I'll come inside for her,
And if she says give it all, I'll give everything to her.

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
