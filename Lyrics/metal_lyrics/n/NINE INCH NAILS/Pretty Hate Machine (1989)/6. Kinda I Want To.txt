I can't shake this feeling from my head.
There's a devil sleeping in my bed.
He's watching you from across the way.
I cannot make this feeling go away

[Chorus:]
I know it's not the right thing.
And I know it's not the good thing.
Kinda I want to

I'm not sure of what I should do.
When everything I'm think of is you.
All of my excuses turn to lies.
Maybe God will cover up his eyes

[Chorus]

Kind I want to.
Maybe just for tonight.
We can pretend it's alright.
What's the price I pay.
I don't care what they say.
I want to.
