hey God, why are you doing this to me?
am I not living up to what i'm supposed to be?
why am I seething with this animosity?
hey God, I think you owe me a great big apology

terrible lie

hey God, I really don't know what you mean.
seems like salvation comes only in our dreams.
I feel my hatred grow all the more extreme.
hey God, can this world really be as sad as it seems

don't take it away from me.
I need someone to hold on to.

hey God, there's nothing left for me to hide.
I lost my ignorance, security and pride.
i'm all alone in a world you must despise.
hey God, I believed that promises, your promises and lies

you made me throw it all away.
my morals left to decay.
how many you betray.
you've taken everything

my head is filled with disease.
my skin is begging you please.
i'm on my hands and knees
I want so much to believe.

don't take it away from me.
I need someone to hold on to.
don't take it away from me.
I need someone to hold on to

I give you everything.
my sweet everything
hey God, I really don't know who I am.
in this world of piss
