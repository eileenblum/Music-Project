["The Downward Spiral" Delux Edition Bonus Disc's Track]

This world rejects me
This world threw me away
This world never gave me a chance
This world gonna have to pay

Well I don't believe in your institutions
I did what you wanted me to
And like the cancer in your system
I've got a little surprise for you

Something inside of me
Has opened up its eyes
Why did you put it there?
Did you not realise?
This thing inside of me
It screams the loudest sound
Sometimes I think I could

Burn

I look down at where you're standing
Flock of sheep all on display
With all your lies piled up around you
I can take it all away

Something inside of me
Has opened up its eyes
Why did you put it there?
Did you not realise?
This thing inside of me
It screams the loudest sound
Sometimes I think I could

I'm gonna burn this whole world down

I never was a part of you

I am your savior
I am corruption
I am the angel
Of your destruction
I am perversion
Secret desire
I am your future
Swallowed up in fire
