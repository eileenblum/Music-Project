[Also known as Twist]

well you've got me working so hard lately.
working my hands until they bleed.
if i was twice the man i could be.
i'd still be half of what you need
still you lead me and i follow
all of your back up to your chin.
over to the tip of your switchblade as you pull it out and stick it in.

[Chorus:] 
(Twist,Twist,Twist) we can go a little deeper.
(Twist,Twist,Twist) i'm wearing these chains.
(Twist,Twist,Twist) you make it hurt real good.
(Twist,Twist,Twist) i love the pain.

well you just leave me nailed here.
hanging like Jesus on the cross.
i'm just dying for your sins.
and aiding to the cause.

[Chorus]

wrap my soul in bandages.
i'm tired of this war.
go ahead and cut me.
i can't even feel it anymore.

[Chorus]
