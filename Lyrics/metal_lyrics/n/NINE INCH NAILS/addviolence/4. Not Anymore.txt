Surprise
I must have let it get in
Started to turn into somebody else
Yeah I found myself believing
Time
My feet are nailed to the floor
I always thought we would get there somehow
I always thought there'd be
More
Well not anymore
Well not anymore
Well not anymore
Mouth taped shut
Crippled and frozen with fear
That maybe happens to somebody else
No that doesn't happen round here
I won't forget I know who I am
No matter what I know who I am
And what I'm doing this for
Well not anymore
Well not anymore
Well not anymore
And I can't seem to wake up
