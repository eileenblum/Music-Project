I wished i lived another life so frustrating but still alive
I was running a dark long road that never seemed to end
I can't always be the one you want me to be
I am fading further far from reality

Something is missing and can not be found
The link between us is falling apart
So i close my eyes and now you're gone
(the random hero lives on)
Something is missing and can not be found
The link between us is falling apart
I'm fading away, im fading away

I never thought I'd see this day
I never thought I'd feel this way
I never wanna feel this way

You were all i ever needed
I can't take the pain
I don't wanna feel this pain

Something is missing and can not be found
The link between us is falling apart
So i close my eyes and now you're gone
(the random hero lives on)
Something is missing and can not be found
The link between us is falling apart
I'm fading away, im fading away
