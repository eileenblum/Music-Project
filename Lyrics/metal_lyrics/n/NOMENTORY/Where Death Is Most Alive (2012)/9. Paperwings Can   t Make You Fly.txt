Realize what you've done
You better walk the line
Pathetic and divine
As you trying to breathe

Can you see the anger running through my blood?

You face the world in another direction
Don't come closer
None will remember your name
When you're dead, you're out of the game

This is what you left behind
These paper wings can't make you fly
Succumb to release its your final demise

Can you see the anger running through my blood?

You face the world in another direction
Don't come closer
None will remember your name
When you're dead, you're out of the game
I wish i could be there once again
As we growing strong
None will remember your name
When you're dead, you're out of the fucking game

You face the world in another direction
Don't come closer
None will remember your name
When you're dead, you're out of the game
I wish i could be there once again
As we growing strong
None will remember your name
When you're dead, you're out of the fucking game
