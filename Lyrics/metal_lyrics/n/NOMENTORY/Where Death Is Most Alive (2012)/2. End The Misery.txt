You smile without a meaning
How's the smile with a fist in your mouth?
What's love without a feeling?
Something i never will know

Burn me in a fire
Just to see if i feel
Try to hang me higher
To see what i mean

See if i feel
Find me

I can't fight back
Even though im trying to find my way home
This is the shame i call myself

Looking in the mirror
The cracks just appears
This life got no reason
To walk this thing we call world.
Just give me a reason

Just like a stone
Come and bring me home
See if i feel
Find me

I can't fight back
Even though im trying to find my way home
This is the shame i call myself
I can't fight back
It's just one ticket away
When i look around and all i see is misery
