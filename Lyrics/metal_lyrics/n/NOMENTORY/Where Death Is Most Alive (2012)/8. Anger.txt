Never try to run me over
I'm comming back with twice as much
I will hunt you down to the end of world
There your road will end.

Become alive, I'll detach your soul
Now put to rest, your final breath

This anger just builds up
Don't try to hide
Make your final bow
Don't fuck with me

There's nothing that can stop me
You better run for your life
You better start to fucking run you motherfucker

To read the news and see you passed away (passed away)
Would be a fucking dream come true
Enough shit said, you're done

Become alive, I'll detach your soul
Now put to rest, your final breath

This anger just builds up
Don't try to hide
Make your final bow
Don't fuck with me

Got all the pictures of you here, i never let you go
I'm gonna chase you down, like a predator chasing it's prey
The memory hold my mind, it will never be like before
