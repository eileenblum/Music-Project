If i just could smile for just one more time
Would i be a better person?
If i did things right and make them write
Would i be a better friend?

No! you'll be alone forever

My vision fades and its all black and white
Through all this nightmare bring me back to life

OH MY GOD
What the fuck is wrong with me?
I just make everything worse
OH MY GOD
Another bit of emptiness

There is no escape from this living hell
Something i must live with every day
And now the scars are deeper, why?
But none seems to care
This is something i must live with everyday

You found me, half hanging
You found me all to soon
You turned your back and walked away

OH MY GOD
What the fuck is wrong with me?

There is no escape from this living hell
Something i must live with every day
And now the scars are deeper, why?
But none seems to care
This is something i must live with everyday
