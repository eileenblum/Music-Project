When you just walked in, i put my legs on the run
I never looked back, i was kinda weak
I hope some day that things will change
It feels like i slowly die

So wipe your eyes
Before you drown in a pool of filth and disgrace
There was nothing i could do
To erase this pain i feel

Have i found a reason not to lie
The pictures so real, just passing through my head
We all got demons that lies in our bed

Don't look behind, just keep on moving
Because those things will never die
You can just hold on, we got to move on
Because those things will never die

What do you want from me?
I'm just a loser

Don't look behind, just keep on moving
Because those things will never die
You can just hold on, we got to move on
Because those things will never die

What do you want from me?
I'm just a loser
