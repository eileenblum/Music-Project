You've been standing in every corner
Is this how you feel alive?
It's like the times, when you were a kid
A travesty you've long forgotten
Now you walk the streets like a ghost
Earn the money that you can keep
You're just a fucking whore

And guess i know why girl you got no confidence
(girl you got no confidence)
But what can bring you down so low
Girl whats inside of your mind

You better start to listen
You can not live like this
I hope your mother is proud
You spred legs for a dollar

And guess i know why girl you got no confidence
(girl you got no confidence)
But what can bring you down so low
Girl whats inside of your mind

You are forever lost
And girl you tried so hard
And now you have seen the stars
They can't bring you back

And guess i know why girl you got no confidence
(girl you got no confidence)
But what can bring you down so low
Girl whats inside of your mind
You are forever lost
And girl you tried so hard

Now you've seen the stars
They can't bring you back
