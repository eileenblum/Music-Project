I've searched and never found a way
Follow the visions and let me decay
I'm so sick and tired of this
It's time for me to find a way out
Out of this purgatory
If this came to and end
I'll make this better

But you gave me no reason
And now you face the floor
I'll call it vengance
A thing i never knew existed

Oh no, you burn all the bridges behind you
You better fly away to your paradise again
It's the only place you know
Where death is most alive

I can't get you out of my head
Some stories is all i have left
Your picture slowly burns
Burns away from my heart

Have you ever looked into their eyes
And said a little prayer?
Have you ever looked into their hearts
And wished that you were there?
Have You ever loved someone
And always known that they don't fucking care?

Oh no, you burn all the bridges behind you
You better fly away to your paradise again
It's the only place you know
Where death is most alive

I've faced the fact and none will bring me down
(none can ever take me down)
If you only knew how good this feels
I thought that this was the point of no return
But you were a fake, a fucking joke
(none can bring me down)
You are a fake
(just a fucking fake)
