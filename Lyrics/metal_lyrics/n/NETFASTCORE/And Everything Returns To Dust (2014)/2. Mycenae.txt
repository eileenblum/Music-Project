Arise
From earth, there's a part of me
The labour of one thousand men
Rebuilt myself
Let me rise again
Awake
From dust and tears
For a long time, buried and disappeared
Now dominated
We are the birth
conceived to carry our history
The death of kings
Strengh, power, ascendancy
We've raised the walls
Witness of our past wounds
Of gold and blood
from despair of our gods
Fire as light
Your pain for truth
Should be your guide,
Your lighthouse during the way!
The one on wich you can matter
The one!
I an your mark
for the long cold days to come
Fire as light
Your pain for truth
Should be your guide,
Your lighthouse during the way!
We are fighting for hope, for tomorrow
Still strong we stand
To keep it till our last breath comes
To break us down, but even then our memories will be!
Born from the reign of nothing
Empty fields have became unbreakable fortresses
Only our stones will remain until the end of days
To give a proof, a proof
A proof that we've failed
Born from the reign of nothing
Empty fields have became unbreakable fortresses
The seas have became over whelming threat
We've built up roads,
Roads that drive us to our fall!
We are fighting for hope, for tomorrow
Still strong we stand !
