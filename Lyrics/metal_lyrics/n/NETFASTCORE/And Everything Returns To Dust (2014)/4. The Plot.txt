I've seen the sky
Turning to grey
The light's becoming black
The wise men / the cowards
The truth seems to be the biggest lie
You've ever heard before
Time will bring me a fucking treason

Built an empire of dust
Give em knowledge
Give em security
As one voice, one million damned eyes
Distant voices begin to rise

I've maid my time
Turn brothers to foes
Their king now forced to kneel down
They wait to see me falling
Living this tragedy,
They did not plan that for me
Distant voices begin to rise

Is this my last breath?

All our dreams are shattered
Behind your masks
Your reason truly resides
From the dephts I've risen
From the top I will fall

Those years corrupted,
This is the reason to change and make better day
Let's put an end to this everything
Those years corrupted
This is the reason to change and making better days
There's still a chance for a new beginning

I've maid my time
Don't wanna hear it
Words as devoured by those vultures
They wait to see me falling
Living this tragedy
They did not plan that for me !
Bring me death
This is my last breath
Under the eyes of my peers
They wait to see me falling !

Your reason truly resides
Behind the mask you wear
