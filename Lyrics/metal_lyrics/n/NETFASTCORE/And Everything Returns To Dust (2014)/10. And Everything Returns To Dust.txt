Words
the damages I've done
Written
Engraved
This tale of their graves
Lead me so far away
in front of me
a pure and blake
horizon
every step is a breath
a lie for guideline
everyday like a sword
above my head

above my fuckin head
an illusion of fate
illusion they shall be ... saved!
a life of sacrifices
to sink into nothingness

I can't carry the weight
the weight of their lives
I've never wanted you
You bequeath me this crown

So please forget me

The author of a lost generation
Haunted by regrets, destroyed by remorse
Until there's nothing left
A desert of ice for haven
what is done is done
and what is dead is fuckin dead
A battle lasts day after day
Exile's for me, the only way
If I could start it again
I've never made the same mistakes
My last thought was to sink
to sink into nothingness
to sink into nothingness
Rather to live in safety
Rather be dead!
Rather to live in safety
Rather be dead!
Rather to live in safety
Rather be dead!
Rather to live in safety
Rather be dead!

The vision of
What I've created
I cannot flood my fears
I know they'll reappear
I can't carry
The weight on my shoulders
There is no place for me
This throne is not for me
The vision of
What I've created
I cannot flood my fears
I know they'll reappear
This vision of
All that I've deceived
There's no more time for me
I feel this blade 's falling
