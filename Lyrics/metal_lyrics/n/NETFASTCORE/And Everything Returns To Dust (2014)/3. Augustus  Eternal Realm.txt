And you're standing here
Elected through the bottom
Been born as man, raised to
The rank of god
You wear this crown of gold
But nothing gold can stay
Behind those black eyes

An eagle among vultures
You've never turned away
An ice cold earth, your kingdom
The price of eternity
What man's without error ?
What king's without weakness ?
D'you believe in your servants ?
They've never turned away !
What man's without error ?
What king's without weakness ?
An old man on his wane
The keys of an eternal realm

Watch you rise
Your life in a box of glass
Before your face dirty by the dust
Since diamonds on your fingers
Your empire in exchange
The keys of an eternal realm
Recognize brave among the traitors
The keys of an etrenal realm

You were the man,
You gave me forgiveness
Monarch with iron hands
Blackened heaven to call you
Take your place beside of gods

Were you the man
Eaten away by the fear ?
Monarch with iron hands
Blackened heaven to call you
Beside the gods of nothing

You were the man
You gave me destruction
Monarch with iron hands
Blackened heaven to call you beside the gods of no one !

Can you affect the hand
The hand of our creator
One day you'll leave your seat
Spotless of poisened blood
Your reign, your fate will be the shape of our destiny
Time disappears
One day you'll leave your seat
Can you affect the hand
The hand of our creator
One day you'll leave your seat
Spotless of poisened blood

Your reign
You were the conqueror
Like ghost
you're condemn to roam
During the ages
Everyone has left
No more sacrifices !
