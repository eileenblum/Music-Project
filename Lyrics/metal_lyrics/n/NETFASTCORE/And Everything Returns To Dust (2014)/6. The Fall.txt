When everything falls down
We've got to save our souls
All inspire in despiration
And what we spread
What we ever felt
And now
We are so sick
We have built a future on an ashes ground
On a ground of nothing

Everything we've lost
Is now celled inside us
Inside our jailed bodies
Dark fated lost souls
We are praying for the last words
A prophety that never came
All we've learned is a fuckin lie
So we've never built a way
A path that anybody knows
The path that we crossed from ourselves
All we've felt is the only way
To destroy the world where we lived

This is the only memory we got
The only one we'll keep inside
Ou hands are raised to the skies
The only memories
We fuckin got

Just remind me the good old time we've spent
We've spent it all, with disinterest
Of our world that we create
Of our world we're destroying

All we ever lived is now already dead
We're all to blame for all we've ever felt
So now, we've past the point of no return

This is our fall
This is our fault

Just remind me the good old time we had
This is the world we did not save
A path that anybody knows
The path that we crossed from ourselves
All we've felt is the only way
A path that anybody knows
The path that we crossed from ourselves
All we've felt is the only way
To destroy the world where we lived

Just remind me the good old time we've spent
We've spent it all, with disinterest
Of our world that we create
Of our world we did not save

So we've never built a way
A path that anybody knows
The path that we crossed from ourselves
All we've felt is the only way
To destroy the world where we lived

This is the only memory we got
The only one we'll keep inside
Ou hands are raised to the skies
The only memories we fucking got left
