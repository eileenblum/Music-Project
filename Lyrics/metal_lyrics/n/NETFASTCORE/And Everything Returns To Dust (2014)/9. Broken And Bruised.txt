Learn and break all the circles
Dead end fall
Living notch to survive
To survive
And we're still broken and bruised
We've sold ourselves at tomorrow
All you've got, seems like dust in your hands
In my hands
This is where I've laid my hope
So we never give up !

Will your break
All the diamond side
As it, bites you inside
As it, broke you till
Your last day comes
Is it all you really want to live ?!
Your weakness will be your salvation
And so we walk
In the same old mistaken steps
And now we're looking for a side
We're locked in the same old fears
We've shaped by the past
We are living in a world of lies

I'm waking up
I feel the rage running in my veins
Now I'm standing here
With the dark eyed face
With a dark heart faith !
We break, we break
We set the world on fire,
To see, to see
That fire's lightening

We are walking in the same old steps
That we refrain from ourselves before
As a familiar illusion, we
As a permanent instability
Can look behind you to find
Flames reappered from their ashes
It burns my eyes, it burns my hands
I cannot feel
I cannot see

We have no faith !
We have no faith !

We are the faithless believer
We are the voiceless conceiver

All the diamond side
As it, bites you inside
As it, broke you till
Your last day comes
Is it all you really want to live ?!
Your weakness will be your salvation

We sold our solds at tomorrow
For a glory will never come
We fade, we fade
And we're still broken and bruised
We sink briskly into the sickness
That sickness runs in my veins
There is no cure !
