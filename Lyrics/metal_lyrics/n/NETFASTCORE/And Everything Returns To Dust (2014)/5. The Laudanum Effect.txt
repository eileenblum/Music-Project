I'm losing my min
I'm losing myself
There's no remorse in the other side
I've heard you say
Everyone in this world
Is dying alone!

My days are gone
A hole in the ground will be my perfect restbed
I'm waiting the storm
Think to see the world opened itself to my hands
Feel it collapsing on me !

Your kiss settles on me, as if needles pricked my skin
Took my refuge in
The sweetest arms of my desillusions

Far away
Sometimes I wish you've never ran your way
Inside of me
Used to be my friend
My worst enemy
May my divine savior
My only escape

Not really proud to go !

My days are gone
Realize lately, no second chance will be
I've waited the storm
I just this breath icing me, paralize me

Soothing / Slow death
What have I done to deserve this end?

So tired, so lost
I've seen the light's coming to me
Still lonely when you're hurt
Now you are there to watch over a dead body
I've seen the light's coming to me
