To have a second chance
The only thing we are living for
Empty Hearted
asking ourselves when everything has gone away?

Never repented for the faith we've lost
Everything has turned to grey
Cover Our Dried Out Faces
The last ones standing be/because the earth is dying !

Cold
Wind freezes those wasted lands
long dark nights replaced our days of
Carefreeness
Surprised by the arrival of the storm we have started
we have started

Empty souls
Empty hearts
This is our legacy !!!
The last ones standing
Becomong the nobodies
Architects of our failures

This is our legacy
Our legacy

This is our legacy
Our legacy

This place will never be our home again
Time has darkened us from inside
Shall only leave
Pain
Tears and Blood
Never forgave for the faith we have lost before
Never forgave us for nothing
We are the damned
We are the damned

The end
is sounding so close
eternal quest for the answers we never had
All our dreams are gone
Hope is faded
Enduring another day

The end
is sounding so close
Eternal quest for the answers we never had
All our dreams are gone
We are the sons
of our cowardice
We are the legion of the hopelessness
