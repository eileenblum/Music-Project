Feel the words as if their meaning
Were weights being lifted
From me
As I have come to trust no other
That you should know
My Heart, My Heart

Look Into It
Finding their the memory
And experience
That belong to you
That are you! That are you!

And there we are the field where i've seen you dying
Enjailed for a longtime under a dark ground
Your demons reappered, I let their doors opened
Let'em remove the mask who
Allow you to live
This world is dying
We are the rests
No more shelters for anyone
This is our curse
Condemn to begin again

Do You remember the face of the ghost of our past life
He looks through your eyes, You're chained to its prayers
No one to save you,
Let me whispering to your ears
"How this life is ending,
and YOU WILL REBORN!!!"

How this life is a dead end
and how you will reborn
How this life is ending
and how you will reborn

Chained to its prayers
He looks
Through your consciousness
Inside my old memories
I let their doors opened
To see
Them coming back again!
