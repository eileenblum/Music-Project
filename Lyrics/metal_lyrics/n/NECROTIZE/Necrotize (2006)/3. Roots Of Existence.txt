Depth, a problematic word,
Only followed by a few,
Don't constrain proportion,
Stay to what is true.

You people know, nothing of truth,
Fill the need, Fill the greed, Find the roots of existence!

You world is false, its just a farce, existence,
Is the question! You just, don't ask,
And follow idols instead of your soul,
Constitution of your own!

Constitution of your Own!

You people know, nothing of truth,
Fill the need, Fill the greed, Find the roots of existence!
