Extremist, pessimist, raise your fists, against destroyers of worlds

Show no pity to people that pity us,
A worldwide terror, of which many trust,
They come to our lives, our homes, our schools,
An explosive presence, those who know not the rules

Extremist, pessimist, raise your fists, against destroyers of worlds

Extermist, pessimist, raise your fists, destroyers of world!

Destroyers of worlds!!!
