Waves of anger weep the shore
Grinding your poisoned shield
Streams of atrocious night
Spit through weak pathetic light
Don't look back, stay easy
âTill you'll look to the
Iceblue eyes of death
Fist, sword, fire, hell
Don't take it personally
Or stuff like that...
Or stuff like death...
Enter the gate with fear
Knowing your fate of rat
Suffer and enjoy your wrath
Kneel down before the ax
Worship the terror you feel
Kneel down in front of
The chosen ones of Twilight
Cry for your inevitable end
Feel it's cold breath on the neck
Fear the mist, the laughing wind
Whatever step can be your last
Strange sounds in your head
You just feel it, not hear
Cold sweat, shaking hands
Legs hardened by despair
Worship the dung you eat all life
Curse the day you were born
Death stares from the eyes
You can't see
Ironthorny gods going in your traces
Cry to please them in your final hour
Darkness, night, the hand with dagger
Warm drops of life fall to the mud
Sound of meatcutting steel
Song of the wind that tears out
The string of your life anthem
So many faces of the end
Hidden by the hood of the hunt
