Let me vomit my misanthropy
At the gates of vacancy
Excremental fermentation
In guts of our mind
Choirs of automats
Excreted on the Earth
Synthetic souls
In unificated bodies
Manipulation with soulless slags
In experiment of the âreal lifeâ
Putrid stench of âcivilization'
In paradise of sterility
Wasteful cries for humanity
Are drowning in violent stupidity
Proclamations of love and peace
Drowned in swamps of subhumanity
Parody on reason and emotions
In stench of rotting reality
Regress of intellect
In the culture of emptiness
Sickened new de/generations
Vomited on the cemetery of nature
New religion of vanities
Amorphous stream of empty life
Alone amongst the creatures
Who don't know what they live for
Just odious mass you can't respect
Between the raped sky
And corroded earth
Experiment with human race
Just another error of Creative Power
What will come after that
Maybe the big Cleansing
I really don't care
About the world we left to rot
I really don't care
About your minds turned into dung
