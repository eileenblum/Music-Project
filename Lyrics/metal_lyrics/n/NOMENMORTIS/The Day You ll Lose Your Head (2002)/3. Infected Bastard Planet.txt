Take a look around you and see
Infected... Bastard... Planet!
Reality is what flows around us
Subhuman mass that makes us vomit
Inferior worms who think
They're something better
Cowardly bastards
With the law of primitivism
Their stream of mean hate
That makes us insane
Nothing just smelly dung
Roars from stupid empty mouths
Primitive subhuman waste
No people just the bastards
What kind of filth
Are those whom we see
What they want, what they need
Are they something more
Than offense of term ï¿½manï¿½?
Cowardly offense is their only argument
Their greed for primitive shits
Shall write their testament
There's still place enough
To dig the graves for you
Pits you're digging by
Your fucking mean existence
You think you're elite
But if it is true
Then only thing I know is
That the waste as we are
Must rule forever
Kill your mothers for their crime
For bearing you on this world
Kill your fathers for their lust
They wasted their sperm to spread the dung
Kill yourself, you'll feel better
Under the earth made not for you
