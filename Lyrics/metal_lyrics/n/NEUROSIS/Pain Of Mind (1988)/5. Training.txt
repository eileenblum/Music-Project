all of us go through our lives
and never stop to think for a second
we producs and impenetrable womb
and seal our existence
controlled by boundaries of mind
we ignore any reasoning
and we still all wonder why our whole race is doomed
and we do as we're told
and we grow so cold
and no one can say why.

progress    how much truth can you take?
lies so pure
hidden eyes, victimized too secure

[ch.]
you live your lies to suicide
content from fear

beaten down and kept in line
commit to sin
programmed mind, self-confined wall closed in

[ch.]

greed controls our lives
money kills
taught to think and act and lie
break the will.
