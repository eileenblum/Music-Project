sometimes i feel so far away
other times i think i need a change today
unwanted feelings of despair from inside
and all i want is a place to hide

[ch.]
sometimes it makes me really angry
other times it gets me really sad
but every time it happens the only thing i see is...
black, black, black, all i see is...

i just want a little piece of mind
away from all my pressures and the daily grind
i just want a place where i can be
away from all the things that trouble me

[ch.]

could things be better at the  end of the road?
or will the world outside still be cold?
for the inner tranquility that i lack
turns everything i see black
