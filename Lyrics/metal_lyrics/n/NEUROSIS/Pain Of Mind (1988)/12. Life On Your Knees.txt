christ died nailed to a cross
(life on your knees, get down on your knees)
now he's an icon to the spineless mass
(life on your knees, enforced reality)
bring your mind forth and submit
(life on your knees, stay down on your knees)
just let him take you away
(life on your knees, assume conformity)

[ch.]
welcome to the world of your mindless life
away from the reality of your lifeless mind

he was no better than the rest of us
crucified for doing what was right to him
and you'll do no better, we're all slaves
let go now, look within

[ch.]

break the chains on your mind
don't spend your life on your fucking knees

the power is within yourself
take a hold of your life
if you spend your life waiting for heaven

you'll never get out of hell
