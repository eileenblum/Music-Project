undermine the system that brings destruction
(wake up and bury what's dead)
our lives are the cancer to their oppression
(wake up and bury what's dead)

[ch.]
if you think the reason we are here
is to fight our brothers and sisters and lovers
you must realize it's ourselves we fear

do you feel the tension in our land?
(wake up and bury what's dead)
from the hate zone to the high rise all built by man
(wake up and bury what's dead)

[ch.]

distrust authority
the only rules are your own
spilling blood for a piece of dirt
(wake up and bury what's dead)
shows what a human being is worth
(wake up and bury what's dead)

[ch.]
