to try to ake  an order out of
muddled thoughts and dream - to
watch hope and desire torn
apart from the seams - construct
a wall of hatred out of failures
crumbled ruins - to crawl with
bleeding fingers for the stones
to be moved

[ch.]
in my dreams i witness terrors
when i wake up they are true
they're of pain and anguish
feelings i never knew

to crawl through the maze of life
and never find the door
to stumble on the corpse of emotion
sprawled across the floor
to stare blankly at one's image
and then coldly turn away
to realise i'm not the only one whose soul died today.
