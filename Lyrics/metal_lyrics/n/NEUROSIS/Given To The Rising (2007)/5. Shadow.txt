I remember the fear
I remember the taste
Isolation
Reflection
A distant echoed howl
The noise of souls
Shadows moving on me
Tension
Animal
Response
Blind eyes dawning and watching the river
The sword raised in judgment
My distance burning
To bring me to you

I'm walking
Into
The eternal
Lake
Of light
