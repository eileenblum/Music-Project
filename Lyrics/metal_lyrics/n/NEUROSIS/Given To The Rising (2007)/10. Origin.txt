All my spirits come through me
When I bleed
A fractured skull in a desert well
I leap
This disturbed, distraught child
Will follow you
A wild and wounded beast
I stand inside the sun

My heart lets memories flood my mind
All the fixed breathing strobes
In the waking hours
The clouds are looming to
Remind me of the judgment
Passed on my soul
Acid stars have scarred my mind
And left me as a ghost

I shattered my curse and spread it through the land
I wander guided, willing, and unclean
Project dark eyes sullen, drawn out and wicked
Nameless lights pull me into a reflected psychic black hole
