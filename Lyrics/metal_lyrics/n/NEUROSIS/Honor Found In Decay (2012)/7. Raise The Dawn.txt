I can't walk anymore.
The moon stuck the promise through my heart.
Lightning strikes and leads me through.
Bleeding walls, and the oceans hold on me.

Her fingers reach to raise the dawn.

All the rest have fallen on,
returning to the sun.
All the rest have fallen on,
the pressure released.

Father's distant whispered eyes,
Guide me to the mountains.

Her fingers reach to raise the dawn.

All the rest have fallen on,
returning to the sun.
All the rest have fallen on,
the pressure released.
