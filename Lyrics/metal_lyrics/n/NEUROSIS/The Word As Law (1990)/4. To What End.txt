'Progress' is not progress, it is everlasting destruction
Technology is backwards

Born of MACHINE
Worship MACHINE
Slave to MACHINE
Become MACHINE

Modern civilization, a contradiction in terms
In terms of survival

Man is made to obey the...
Are we nothing but living...
MACHINE - a dead hand, it's work expresses death
No spirit in it's skeletal framework
The falsification of Man, to what end?
TO WHAT END?

Born of MACHINE
Worship MACHINE
Slave to MACHINE
Become MACHINE

Perverted ingenuity of Man
Fools, we've lost out earthly wisdom

Not the way of nature
In a man-made state of disarray
