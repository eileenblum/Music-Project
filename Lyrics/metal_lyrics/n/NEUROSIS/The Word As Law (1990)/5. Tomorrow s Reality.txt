We blame others for the problems
that we create for ourselves
Too scared to look inward for the fear
Of seeing what we see in them

Anger
Hurt
The hidden guilt manifests

Neurotic symptoms appear as we hide from the truth
A pattern forms and becomes rule
Our lives become a host to the parasite
Of actions caused by our denial of responsibility

Tonight's nightmare is tomorrow's reality
You look for betterness in everything you see
But poison all hopes of what might be

Rewards of compulsion that only satisfy
The mental cancer that infects
Those who deny
What the self reflects

Look inside and find the strength
To face reality without fear
Look to yourself and you will see
The evidence is clear
