I felt like I was in a cage
My body was numb, my head was fixed just right
Too sacred to speak for fear of what cuts me like a knife

It's a leech on my soul
Draining my blood and leaving me cold
Left with angry deflections of the feelings I have sold
Leaving me cold

Weekly bleeding in this factory
Takes everything away from me
One way out that I can see
This is what you have made for me

Factory

Tied to a cage to slave my life away
Openess makes me an easy prey
I buy the drugs to kill the pain
That this shit causes in my brain

Obedience to this tomb to which I was bred
Force-fed their lies, I'm choking on what I was fed
Destruction fills my head
When I wake to this day that I dread.
