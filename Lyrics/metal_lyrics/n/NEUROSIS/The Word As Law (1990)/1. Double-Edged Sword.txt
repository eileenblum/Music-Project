I know what the plan of futures are
The cry and the march of shame
Crawling to the center of what remains

Look for the path to the shelterland
Crossing paths, conflicting times
Expansion never ending
Destruction mind is sending

Signals abound around us
They plant the seed of fate
Creating the undiscovered thought
Snapping the eyes to pain

Feeding, eating, bleeding, seeing
Healing to be broken again
Standing in the crossfire
Burning in the wind

Maybe one day you'll see what I see now

Step to the front the falling is today
