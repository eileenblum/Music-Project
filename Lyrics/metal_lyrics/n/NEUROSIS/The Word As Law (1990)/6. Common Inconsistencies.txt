Toiling our lives away

We learn to accept the petty rewards that we get
From the feudal system of our modern day wage-slavery
Setting goals for ourselves that cannot be met
Through this system of self-perpetuating misery
Always saying yes when we want to say no
Because we're committed to our roles of subserviency
Living high on stress, pretending that you're unaffected
While denying the reality that you're dejected

Eraser
The eraser
will erase their
will erase your face

Face the inevitability of extermination
While you sit and passively watch
Our earth's contamination

Infrequent possibilities will
Pacify and rectify the inconsistencies

Common good shoved down your throat
And the common enemy is common sense
