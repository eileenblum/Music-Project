Fighting against the way we've been conditioned
Is the pain of life and mind
The more we see the more we know
The more we can't seem to find

A way of living life free of control
Without reality always being such a fucking hole
Where all we have to do is survive
With no restrictions on our lives

In this situation where forced to hypocrisy
We're made to set rules for ourselves
Distrust is taught as a way of survival

Follow your heart trust your head
We've got to accept that we're all alike
Facist is anarchist is life
One makes the other and the other is one
Just reflections of black and white
