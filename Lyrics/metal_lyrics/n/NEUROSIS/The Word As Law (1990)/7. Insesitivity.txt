see the suffering of their lives as you pass them by
Read about the daily tragedies in the paper
Get your depression fix from the T.V. set
It's all too real - can you deal with it?

Quietly whispered lies of happiness
Shouted the truth of being
Face the daily tragedies
with learned insensitivity

Sacrificed souls; preserved sanity
