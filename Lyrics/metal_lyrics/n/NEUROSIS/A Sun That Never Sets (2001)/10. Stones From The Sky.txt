Once is enough, trial is alone. Grace fall into us.
All through the night, Father I crawled.
Sun of my soul be revealed. Walking amongst the stones
from the sky, feeling their rhythm wash over me.

Rite of this waring god. Destructive, alive, frees you now.
Rivers of fear, don't you know? Vigil of faith stills you now.
You've been shown over and over, don't you know?
You've been shown over and over, don't you know?
