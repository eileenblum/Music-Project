Rise over silence
Decry my own station
Seek refuge in forgotten songs
To carry me over

When life has exhausted
The casting of shadows
The coiled serpent, the eye in the circle
To a light that is clear

A distance fell
My head is full
The hole within me
Is my ever raging mind

To the madness and the fire
Of the salt made anew
Slit the throats of those who light the torches
Smother with their blood

My heart is worn
I searched in my soul
The sky revealed
A shadow memory

I will bury the secrets 
In the waning of the moon
Break my mind of the straight lined roads
Walk in the serpent form

I'm still within this time
My eyes were frozen years ago
Our passing days become the the tomb
The angels left me empty
