The restless sea is breaking me
Fire on my back the ocean lights me
Watching through the eyes of a crow
I let it guide me, I let it in
The end is endless and washing over me

Reaching for me to tear me apart
I washed it away so long ago 
But it returns to seed
I do see beauty full of pain
I let it guide me I let it in
The end is endless and overseeing me

Peeling the skin away reveals the heart

Feed the levee shallow graves
To dam the ever breaking tides
Free my soul from nihil waves
To forgive and to decline
