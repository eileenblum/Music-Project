Never finding security
Just living in a bad reality
Never finding security 
Just living in a bad reality 

Exorcise the demons from your mind
Purge the fear of failure 
Reject inbred subjective restrictions 
Remove the blinders, explore the infinate

Never finding security 
Just living in a bad reality 
Never finding security 
Just living in a bad reality 

Exorcise the demons from your mind 
Purge the fear of failure 
Reject inbred subjective restrictions 
Remove the blinders, explore the infinate

Look inside 
Find a way out 
Free your mind 
From the bonds of self-doubt 

Don't want to be
A self-indentured slave 
To my insecurities 
Self-doubt (controls my destiny now)
