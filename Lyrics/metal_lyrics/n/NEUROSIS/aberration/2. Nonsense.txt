Mislead all along from start to end 
What creates this riddance of guilt ? 
A little here, none over there 
What more is said ? 
The door is shut from the inside 
But who's inside the door ? 
New time, wrong place, wrong face 
To get over there 
Forever spinning in faith
Unload, leave, state the law 
Expect the rest 
Stumbling down to grovel with the rest of us
Another life lost 
Just wanted to be 
Not too much 
Fall off the top and splash when you fall 
Eating the beaten path 
Taught the ways of self-destruction 
Questioning to the last
