cease this long, long rest
wake and risk a foul weakness to live
when it all comes down
watch the smoke and bury the past again
sit and think what will come
raise your fears and cast them all away

[Whispered narration:]
As each hour passes our shadows grow tallerÂ 
and the darkness expands
until the light disappearsÂ 
and we become our shadowsÂ 
and we become our shadowsÂ 
and we become our shadowsÂ 
and we become our shadows
Away [8x]
