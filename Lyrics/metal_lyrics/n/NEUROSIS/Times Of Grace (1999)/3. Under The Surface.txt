behind a burning red fog
the great mind swims in confusion
its blood ferments in anger
honor and wisdom will cower

your river's flow is damned all to hell

drifting in a current to stagnate
encircle the vision of rust

your river's flow is damned all to hell

strong hearts soar through blindness
tearing the fog, tearing the eyes to clarity
to a place where truth is seen

your shell is hollow, so am i
the rest will follow, so will i
