The cycles they are clawing
Thrive
Wander, then starve
The cycles they are thawing
Dive
Wallow, then freeze

Silence
Ripping up through the cracks

The thriving of the doomed
Before the cleanse to dust

Rise
Run
Feed
Ripen
Wound
Wither
Fall
Rise again

Taking time
by the forelock

A chronology for survival
And a wretched end for the pathetic
