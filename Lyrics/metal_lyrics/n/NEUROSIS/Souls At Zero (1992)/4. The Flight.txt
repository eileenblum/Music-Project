Power
Too weak to stand up the power
Mentally castrated
Seeking security in sedation
Sedation amidst the hum of the machine

Playing on
Grinding on weakness
Grinding on the weak

Punishment for the feel
Rebellion manifests in those who are strong
and Punishment for the feel

Only way out or out there
But out there is the end

Sick, sick
They're damned good at it
Last straw, no more, fight

Her eyes rolled back
Her eyes rolled back

NO!!

The mutiny has been electrocuted
