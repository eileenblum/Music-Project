Leave me demons did I want you? Why do you need
me? I can see you have so many. I know I'm a magnet
but why must I feel your evil? You give me pain. My
thoughts of blood reign.
And it's falling to someone...

You web is my time. I can see the sign. It flows through
heart. It sees through eyes. It fills my soul.

I'm clawing, crawling, slower, deeper. For this void in
my head only you can fill. Your fingers reach so far
into my soul. My blood is filled with blood you spilled.
And it's falling to someone...

And it's finally falling to someone...
My spirit seeks these desperate moments. Dissolving
the prescribed crucifix. It lurks and watches, slowly,
waiting. To wash the sickness from my mind.
