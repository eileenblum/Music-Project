When it begins - Takeahnase - the floods will sever the
christs from the earth. Thieves called it property -
Takeahnase - you'll drown for our mother's disgrace.

We tried to tell you, now let us show you. You'll know
the way. Like spiny fingers you'll separate. You'll
know the way. Takeahnase.

Cold, distorted air - Takeahnase - the blood must flow
to pay for your hour. This human garbage - Takeahnase
- You'll drown for our mother's disgrace.

Burn down.
