Destroy the eyes of the world
Wish for invisibility
God damn your eyes I say from the gallows

Stripping you down

Ashamed for feeling
Ashamed for thinking
No right to my own real

Foundation, death in life
Murder in the matrix

The hole in your soul marks the ruins
The lost city
The lost child

Anonymous persecutions
Attracting autonomy from the flank

Bridges burned
Internal shame spirals you down

Do not be ashamed of freedom
