The blood of the innocent
Praised in your heeded lodge
Enshrined with corruption
Internecine

Bounded with your bloodline
Your uprising revealed
Your plague divine
Infirmity unhealed

Guilty and hated
Behind curtains 
You coward behold
Behold this day your story unfolds

Amok
Runs through your veins
Amok
These chapters explained

Infliction of peace is a fantasy
The true aim is torture and hypocrisy
This is your nature in reality
Your amok doctrine for humanity

1390 the Regius reborn
Through spells objectives reform
Mass population control
None of us knew what the future would hold

No significance left in thee
Fraud and crime is the currency
Deception a new spiritual belief
This is the dawn of stupidity

All hail
All praise
Bewildering blasphemy
Long live your treachery

As slaves
As sheep
They flock to thee
Never â¦ Will I be

Amok
Runs through your veins
Amok
These chapters explained

All hail
All praise
Bewildering blasphemy
Long live your treachery

As slaves
As sheep
They flock to thee
Never ... Will I be

Confined and blessed with fortunes and treasures
As leaders they will scourge the earth

They roam from land to land
Luring and seducing mankind

Now the story is evinced
For generations to comprehend
