For years this world has been oblivious
Purity abused, scattered recklessly
No rights that exist, revoked morality
Freewill incised, driven to lunacy
As time passes by, we still insist everythingâs fine
Open your eyes face this reality

Born in fragile spheres of intimacy
Set target to a flaccid wound
An emotional devastation
Of ones mind tortured, doomed

Your spirit, defiled and stranded
In oceans of ignorance
Consider the life of a nation
No prosperity, nor existence

Stand up, stand up... defy
Your false morals, I deny

This construction of such subliminal plot âis so indulgingâ
This destruction on an insignificant verve âis overwhelmingâ
Righteousness enslaved âleft to serve this pain is tearingâ

Ominous
This epidemic scheme
Absurdity
This stained regime

I have come to realize
United we stand, divided we fall
Prohibit this naivety
Generate some self-respect
Elevate your faith to obtain unity

Born in fragile spheres of intimacy
Set target to a flaccid wound
An emotional devastation
Of ones mind tortured, doomed

Your spirit left defiled and stranded
In oceans of ignorance
Consider the life of a nation
No prosperity, nor existence

The oath, the oath provoked
Cursed by the original sin denote

This construction of such subliminal plot âis so indulgingâ
This destruction on an insignificant verve âis overwhelmingâ
Righteousness enslaved âleft to serve this pain is tearingâ

Venomous
This epidemic scheme
Avidity
This strange regime
