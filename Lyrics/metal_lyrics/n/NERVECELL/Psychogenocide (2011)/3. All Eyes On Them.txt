Witnessing the chaos around me, this endless corruption I see
I see strangers brainwashed, and the ones close to me
Led by the piper, as rats weâll see
Weâll see the end of dawn, souls buried soullessly
No honour, no right to claim, your ignorance subdues me
Die... and let it be

Break these shackles, from your eyes
Let go of this heresy and youâll realize

So easily weâre manipulated to run for our pockets in greed
While they wrote our past, present and future
To make us plead until we bleed

The time is now, or forever hold your grief
Just as their blood runs deep, they will seekâ¦

My voiceâ¦
My voice against your lies
You brought this genocide
We will not abide
This is our voiceâ¦
Arise
Crawling in your mask
Beholder of the past
The enemy I despise
This is our voiceâ¦
Arise

Break these shackles from your eyes
With will, the truth and justice, no compromise
With secrecy they were born, born to run our lives,

A life of war, blood and deception
Itâs only a matter of time... all eyes on them

The time is now, or forever hold your grief
Just as their blood runs deep, they will seekâ¦

My voiceâ¦
My voice against your lies
You brought this genocide
We will not abide
This is our voiceâ¦
Arise
Crawling in your mask
Beholder of the past
The enemy I despise
This is our voiceâ¦
Arise

With prayers I knelt down like youâ¦
Your lies now lead, your demiseâ¦

My voiceâ¦
My voice against your lies
You brought this genocide
We will not abide
This is our voiceâ¦
Arise
Crawling in your mask
Beholder of the past
The enemy I despise
This is our voiceâ¦
Arise
