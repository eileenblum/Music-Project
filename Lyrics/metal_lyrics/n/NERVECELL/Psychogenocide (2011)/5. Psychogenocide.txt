Mindless, senseless
Strip this sacred temple, from its baffled gods
And you'll find a meaningless life, that's one with no cause
Just like a mind, dispatched from its soul
As animals, as mammals we'll dwell in this hole

Since the initiation, of modern civilizations
Epochs of weakness, inherited dissensions
Then shall the earth's children know the true expression
Of unity and peace, eliminating war aspirations

Beaten, defeated, this battle is depleted
Abashed, dismayed, history's faults uneglected
This nescience in us opened the gateways of supremacy
Consequences faced, acceptance is our destiny

Wars, martyrs

Psychogenocideâ¦ They live... Your pain... They reign... Psychogenocide

Beaten, defeated, this battle is depleted
Abashed, dismayed, history's faults uneglected
