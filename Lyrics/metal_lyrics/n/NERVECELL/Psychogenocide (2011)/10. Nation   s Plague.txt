Born of the hatred, engendered by years of wars
Ruled by moribund servants, of avid ideologies

With empty words and promises
Our vanity left expired unconscious

Rotting in a nation's plague, consumed by a nationâs plague

Injecting vermin in the feeble hearted 
The search for light eradicated

Slaughter, massacre, torture, we will endure
Annihilate, obliterate, your tools impure

From the face of the earth alleged atrocities
Weâre compelled to submit to a madmanâs anomalies

Why live the life the accusers lead?
To walk their paths on nails unfreed

Rotting in a nation's plague, consumed by a nationâs plague

This feeling of enslavement is so degrading
Our patience has fled our anger is raging 

Revolution created by him
Burnt alive for this nation
When shall justice manifest?
Our souls trapped, laid to rest
Many will die and not see the day
Where envy is driven away
Perpetrated poverty
Onslaughts of a nationâs plaque
