Incoherent
Blatant to the spheres of comprehension
Oblivious
Dispelled, cast away from strings of carelessness

Youâre shallow and pointless
Apathy reached heights of insanity
Driving me to the edge of depravity

This dominion has clenched my senses choked
Fortitude faded in the mist of thin air evoked

Silence wrecked
Tyranny of ignorance resisted
Close mindedness
Spiritual blindness

The yearning to seek the truth
Ignorance spawned the will to blame
Their lives to dominate

Dominate

The time of retribution is now
Your covert traces announced
Relinquishing despair
The wrath of my carnage youâll not bare

Through conviction, persistence
I will bring you down
Tearing your morals
Crushing your crown

Incoherent
Blatant to the spheres of comprehension
Oblivious
Dispelled, cast away from strings of carelessness

The negation
Theories entwined with beliefs
The dissolution
Principles inaugurated

Itâs evident through social norms
Lured away from common sense

Dominate

Primitive state was attained
To civilizing progression
Profound human miseries

Strike, inflict, motivate
Your inner reason
To confederate
