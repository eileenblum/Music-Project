You listen to me!
Conceptualize your state of mind, you'll find the answers that bind
You question wars and crimes, the violent doings of mankind

Now the facts have been exposed
Constant voids are now disposed

Weakness beyond belief
Crawling upon your knees
Read between the lines you have no destiny
You walked the path of lies no peace existence ceased

Raise your glass in honor of, self righteous impurity
This will be the hour of, the end to your audacity

You see! You confuse the word of creed with your bloodshed filling the streets
Come to realize this life is nourished with lies
No strings attached, you are better of dead, dispatched

Dangerous source of error
Of pride and deception
In the name of terror
Of hatred, annihilation

Now the facts have been exposed

Weakness beyond belief
Crawling upon your knees
Read between the lines you have no destiny
You walked the path of lies no peace existence ceased

Raise your glass in honor of, self righteous impurity
This will be the hour of, the end to your audacity

Dangerous source of error, in the name of terror
Inner coherence, in order to evolve
They watch us dying, they see us trying
This silence infects you, this silence bestows you
