The rush of this air is withered
Pushed your lucid thoughts that hammered
Pressed you to a shrine that battered
This defenceless insanity

Filled with war's cruelty
Handed with the crown of butchery
Between heaven, and hell
Is only us that dwell

The veil parts a horrendous theme
Do you observe
The stench of entrapments to their illumine defeat

Down into the depths I fly
Through insanity I'm asking why

Twilight of fear, calling their demise, their lies
Their grins, their faces, and their sad disgrace
If only they could realize, the madness they will face
This burden on the shoulders of this race

Unearthing what we signify
Obsessed with what we want to be
Beneath the lies you have waited
Your soul that rotted and faded
And raise you from your slumber
In torment, in agony you'll suffer
No escape, no rescue, no healing
Thou shall forever burn

Vicious circle of bloodshed

Calling their demise, their lies
Their grins, their faces, and their sad disgrace
If only they could realize, the madness they will face
The burden on the shoulders of this race
