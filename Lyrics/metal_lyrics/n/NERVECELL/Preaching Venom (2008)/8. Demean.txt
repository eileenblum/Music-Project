Beneath the wastes you waited for the precise time to escape
Your ignorance betrays and entraps carving your twisted mind
And crowned you the throne of shame to rule the degraded sources
A meaningless cause to blame, collapse, distort your faces

You didn't seem to ever mind
Until the wounds on your wretched soul
And then you remembered

Tramped through, melting flesh
To rest in your flaws you'll bleed
The lands that turned to ash
Until that foretold day ye fall

The night draws forth
To rest your flaws you'll bleed
To find out what you're worth
In these precious times of need

To live, to die, it'll leave, and come again

The voices in your head consuming degraded mind
Controlling your senseless emotions emerging nothingness

Demeaned is your essence forever you'll be
Consumed morality

Tramped through, melting flesh
To rest in your flaws you'll bleed
The lands that turned to ash
Until that foretold day ye fall

With this greed the world is entrapped
With this creed you'll have to adapt
Once a wolf among the sheep
Now as a slave you will weep

To live, to die, it'll leave, and come again!

I'm entertained with your torment
The shroud of pain within me
