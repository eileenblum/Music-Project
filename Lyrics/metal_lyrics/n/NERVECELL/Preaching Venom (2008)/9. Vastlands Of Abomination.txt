Legacy of, suffering

Amok pain, detestable hate
Cremates my soul, propels my obduracy

Acme miasma, locked for those years
Vile released, through the oceans of my legacy

Did they forget me? I'm coming
With all the lust, I'm crawling

Open your eyes, forget your past
Praise through hell, the mere reality

Agony, fury, misery, suffering

Clashed with sins, of sorrow
Tortured souls created, crucifying immortal
Legions will fall, diminished humanity
Bow for the one, and only, me

Agony, fury, misery, suffering

Open your eyes, forget your past
Praise through hell, the mere reality

Agony, fury, misery, suffering
