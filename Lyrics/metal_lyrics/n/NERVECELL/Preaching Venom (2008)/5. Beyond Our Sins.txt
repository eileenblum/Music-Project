Been uttered a tale of the strapping lands
Such tribes detest the truth that lies within

Remains stay buried under concealed truth
While carnality forgot about the cause

You walk on earth diffusing your kind
Incubating and polluting the mind

You disperse your plague upon the graves
Impaling the resting dead through this butchery

As I traverse the pungent terrain
I can sense the sight beyond the pain
As for those who passed away

Hear their spirits chant on his death
Resurrected generations of this universe
His selfishness blinded him from the signs
Silent spectrum architects his sins

This world of innocence was transformed to rage
And the virgin of earth cried out loud
Conquered fury unleashed upon my men
Swearing upon the Lord of one

This oath was descended to lies
Lies from a nation built on madness
This promise was broken into nothingness
Our nations bleed

Decaying flesh, Bodies burning
Eyes shot wide,
Fulfilling the deed, as angels bleed
Running, from this reality

As their slave he fell from grace, as darkness launching his tyrant place
In this universe, the beast to serve, the world to grind

As I traverse the pungent terrain,
I can sense the sight beyond the pain,
As the centuries for those who passed away,

This oath was descended to lies
Lies of a nation built on madness
This promise was broken into nothingness
Our nations bleed, beyond our sins

To terminate, the forsaken
Your sanity, your very being
Corrosive mind, manifest hate

They fall like flies, no end in sight
With open eyes, they dissolve
Behind the shield they watch as angels, die
