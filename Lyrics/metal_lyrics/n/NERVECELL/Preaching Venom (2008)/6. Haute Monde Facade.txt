In the verge of existence,
There lies a lust to devour, the pain of humanity's anguish
This grief never settles my soul not an hour, filled with shame and disappointment
Misconceptions towards this life and its death, drawn through disobedience and anger

What this verve brought us to? Towards the end of everything

Chaos is here

Engaging in a never ending hatred, hatred to this life our fathers once led
Injecting revulsion in the minds of the weak, innocence to corruption
Puppets of a ruthless aim, stupidity is born in the name
The name of honor we once swore upon, swearing upon the lord of one

Towards the end of everything

Something is near consequences you can hear
Your doings are unset revealed through blinded eyes

Something is near, your vision, determination set unclear objective and need
Your doings are unset revealed through misleading lies

Come to realize with an open mind
We are made to, decompose, to humiliate, to invigorate
Rot in peace

This tragedy is tearing me, true senses scattered everywhere
This silence has forsaken us, can hear my soul crying out with despair

"History will have to record that the greatest tragedy this period of social transition was not the strident clamour of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good..." - Martin Luther King, Jr.
