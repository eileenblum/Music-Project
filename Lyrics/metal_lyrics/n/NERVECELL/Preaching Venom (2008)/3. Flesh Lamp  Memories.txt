Blood gashes through the veins
All fragments part embracing time
The knowledge of the weak
Slaughter an unconscious crime

Truth, something you've never seen
Left betrayed in this world of disguise
Something you've never been
Left by the powers of the unknown skies

Expired evolution of this race that was an entity
Inner plague of utter selfishness crawled through insanity
Interment of the mere innocent transformed to meaningless species
Rejoice the new breed of martyrdom

Let go from these chains and throw your misery
Then you'll realize this world of slavery

The Spheres around you that you see eliminated value and purity
Constant change and progression of madness and insanity

Around you that you see
Value and purity
Constant change and progression
Of madness and insanity

Traversing the line
Controlling your life
Becoming victims of a dying world
Screaming corpses surrounded pain

You force your true blinded vision (and choose what you want to see)
You neglect its true essence

Welcome to the dawn of lunacy
As a slave you're bound by their tyranny
All that is pure is now destroyed
Death to the weak and the ignorant

Set aside an evolution of this race that was an entity
Internal sickness of utter selfishness crawled through insanity
Interment of the innocent transformed to meaningless species
Beware

Flesh and memories, in my dreams, visioning the one once lost
In your life you, you lived in pain, ashamed of your race, rest in peace

The Spheres around you that you see eliminated value and purity
Constant change and progression of madness and insanity

Around you that you see
Value and purity
Constant change and progression
Of madness and insanity
