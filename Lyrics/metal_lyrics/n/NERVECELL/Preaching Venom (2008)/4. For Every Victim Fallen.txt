An Ambition near no where transcending through space
Renaissance through bloodshed presenting embrace
Haunting dreams, and eternal suffering shows on his face
Rotting bodies cremates on this race

Confusion, Frustration
What could've been worse? What's happening?
Emotions, explosions
Humanity's heart-print left to waste

Fatal, understanding the need to feel free
By having the strength and taking the last breathe of this breed
They are ready to be given, given to hell
Maybe then they'll realize the truth I am trying to tell

They enter their grave
When nothing they gave
Killing others while killing themselves
Not caring, not giving, not thinking

Shattered dreams insult their bitter greed
Superiority provoking them unfreed
When conscious forces them with words that plead
For some reason they are, they are lost they're brainwashed, manipulated

An Ambition near no where transcending through space
Renaissance through bloodshed presenting embrace
Haunting dreams, and eternal suffering shows on his face
Rotting bodies cremates on this race

Corruption, Destruction
What could've been worse? What's happening?
Emotions, explosions
Humanity's heart-print left to waste

They are ready to be given, given to hell
Maybe then they'll realize the victims that fell

Mankind's soul is weakened
Victims in a false man's collation
A pure development of a prisoner
With no crime, no justice, no life

Don't you see the rise in violence?
Don't you realize the bitter silence?
Don't you hold a slight vengeance?
Has there ever been a time of, no conflict, no aggression, no war
Much forces imperfections so sore

Transcending, Darkness
Dispatched from your inner sense
You were brought to this life
Deforming stability, no control
You're calling, you're weeping
Forgiveness is all you're seeking
Too late, you're a victim, just like them

For every victim, for every victim fallen
