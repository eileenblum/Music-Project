Striving in the dark path
Looking for an answer
Holding the curse of Nath
Calling the Lucifer

Euthiria
Bloodshed
Puritanica
Forever dead

Holding the flame
Carrying the blame
I'll show this place
The face of death

Euthiria
Bloodshed
Puritanica
Forever dead

"War... Pain... Blood... Death..."

"Demolition...
Human killing human
Demolition...
His holiness has bred
Demolition...
Human killing human"

Life,
My mission to end
Death,
I won't regret
Blasphemy
Of the past
Velocity
I will cast

Constructing
My
Hatred
Toward s this life he has bred

Blasphemy
Of the past
Velocity
I will cast

"War... Torture... Blood... Death..."

"Demolition...
Human killing human
Demolition...
His holiness has bred
Demolition...
Human killing human"

On earth you're walking
All the shit you're preaching
All your beliefs are forgotten
What kind of faith you're approving
