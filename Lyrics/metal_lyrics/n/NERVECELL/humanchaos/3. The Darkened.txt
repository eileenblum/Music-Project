Preversed, through the abyss
Abased, the bright light path
Soulless, heart deriving
From an innocent mind

Freedom, had to unleash
Its distant, sorrow
Abysmal, actions
Through humanity, so cruel

"The Darkened"

Affliction, during the centuries
Accursed, to fade away
Witnessed, and abashed
In our visions

Living a life so foolish
Locked, in a cell with maggots
Life, in acropolis
Life, in darkness

"We are bound in Darkness"

Accumulation, for justice
Guilty, for its sickness
Pedantic, eternity
Socratic, Crematory
