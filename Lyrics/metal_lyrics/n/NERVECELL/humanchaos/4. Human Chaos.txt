Deprived, within a clenched breath
Murdering emotions in myself
Reign, of a treasured mind
Holding you down in pain

Cursed fallen demons will lead you
With me to the gateways of chaos
Trapped for condemnation in life
In order to observe

Conquered state of mind
Redeeming this corrupted life
Societies with polluted wars
Societies been deceived

Choked, conformity
When life, is so innocent
Through the lands, of confusion
When nations will burn

Under the graves of the dead
Ancestors in torture forever
Are seeking for eternal mercy
Merciless life they live

Behold the damned they're leading
When there is no god to believe in
All what we follow is a scene
Of our dreams

"Human... Chaos"

"Human chaos
The blind masses
Homage of a thought
Was brief and adverse"

Dissecting, my life
Carving my past with deranged blood
Tearing my soul
Through stains of insanity

Flames, of knowledge
When the knowledge, of truth
Becoming the truth, of life
The forced lives to live

"Human... Chaos"

Deprived, within a clenched breath
Murdering emotions in myself
Reign, of a treasured mind
Holding you down in pain...

"Human chaos
The blind masses
Homage of a thought
Was brief and adverse"

Why deny, the negative
When your peace, was wasted
This frictional, tomb of scum
Why deny, your morbidity
