Vicious cause
Carrying the legacy
Born to kill
They will

Lying under
The damned sky
Deliver my spirit
To obscurity

Sickened memories
Burnt in blades
Bruises of hate
Call to suicide

[x2]
"Black blood
Power by silence
I reap the sadness
Signs of the end"

Fight to rebel
Remains of the slain
A dead body rises
Above my head

Lust for torture
Passion for pain
Raining blood
River of tears

And then my revenge
Will last
Mythical chaos
Strings are torn

Open the Gateways
Of my unholy desires
The contradiction
We see your souls in sickness

[x2]
"Black blood
Power by silence
I reap the sadness
Signs of the end"

"We were meant to demolish
To eliminate a lie called happiness
Preaching the words of truth
Paradox of wisdom"
