Confined and trapped
Isolated in time from cosmologies

This day that the Lord hath sent unto thee
Iron palisade collapsed,
Once constructed by Dhul Qarnayn

Our arms and claws, battered, bleeding and slashed trying to break free
Everyday and night this fence reformed restored mysteriously

We are sadists, we kill, we devour
We feed on what roams the earth and in between

We shall relive the past
This catastrophe you have never seen

Confined and trapped. Isolated in time from cosmologies
Our numbers surpass your sight. There is no escape

We come by names Huns, Khazars, and Mongols
We proliferate, we incubate
Swarming your world like a disease
Like a virus we will fester

This day that the Lord hath sent unto thee
Iron palisade collapsed,
Once constructed by Dhul Qarnayn

We will kill, annihilate, we will devour, we forage on human flesh

We are sadists, we kill, we devour
We feed on what roams the earth and in between

We shall relive the past
This catastrophe you have never seen
Onto the smashing of the Iron gate
