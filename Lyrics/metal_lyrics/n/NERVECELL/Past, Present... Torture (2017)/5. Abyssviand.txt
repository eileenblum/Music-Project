Oh, I have longed for this day
This day of our union
Eternal embrace

You stand with such splendour
Shelter me with poison
Feed me your torture

My skin regenerates
I've traded garden of Eden
To this one of Hades

Burn my entrails
Fry my intestines
Do what you said you will [2x]

Grace me with your roots
Demonic headed fruits
For you I would always kill

What a glorious posture
Your treasures are never ending
They shine with glamour

Like a Christmas tree
Your branches grace me
With you and hamim
I shall forever be

From the depths of hell
You were spawned
Magnificence reborn
What a sight to see

You hear all their screams in pain
Nothing goes in vain
It's music to my ears

Burn my entrails
Fry my intestines
Do what you said you will [2x]

Grace me with your roots
Demonic headed fruits
For you I would always kill

Why have they concealed you?
Through texts and scribes they hid you
These questions arise
I shall always ask
For I have longed this day
For our union
Delicately embraced

You pose with such splendour
Please feed me your torture

Torture

Oh, I have longed for this day
This day of our union
Eternal embrace

You stand with such splendour
Shelter me with poison
Feed me your torture
