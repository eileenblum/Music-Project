Consider this futile life once spent
Submit yourself to the system that bent
Bent to reform true facts of history
Like a lost child led to sullen misery

This infant, specimen of monstrosity
Nourished with life's fruits of malignancy
The taste of penance, odium, and delinquency
Shall run through this new born's arteries

Past, presentâ¦ torture

Convulsed epoch, tearing this shroud

Chains of delusion
Release me!

Rancid manifesto taking form
This impelling parade of lunacy

Nightmare now reality
Inspire me!

Ontogenesis of the mind
Putrid souls come forth to me
Execute

Bring you to your knees, to this devastation, impossible appease, to this creation
Crush them

These walls of sincerity, are closing, they're trembling, your carelessness revolts me
Repels me, your numb blindness disgusts me

Past, presentâ¦ torture

Repent
Implore
Bereft of life

All is lost
Only ashes and dust
What have you become?

This life you call miserable and unfair
Was crafted with your bare hands' despair
This mere claim is not a prophecy
It's the common sense lost with your hypocrisy
