Blessed are these mortals
Hoards of parasites they are
Graced with pestilent desires
To eradicate the righteous and pure

Pure

To disintegrate objectivity
You disgorge their fragile tendencies
And to fracture lucidity
You disarm their cognitive abilities

The honour of man enslaved
Winds of pungent inequity
Shall seep in the vein of humanity

Dead forgotten
Your theories left stranded
Buried and rotten

This is where it ends
Your withered teaching transcends
My oath to this generation
To tear your sole foundation

We who have emerged from malign
Shall scatter the earth like plagues
This is where it ends
Accept the malice within

Dead forgotten
Your theories left stranded
Buried and rotten

Praise, the suffering
Dawn of mankind built on sin
This tragedy, of reckoning
Shall summon the malice within
