Obscurity
The empyrean
Pitch black eclipse
The cadaverous roam again

Let waters turn to blood
So red is the blood
Flowing heedlessly
Through the oceans of entropy

Pathosis
Decrepit seed
Descent to ruination
Turmoil shall never sleep

Psychosis
Insanity reborn
Disarray

The tree of lies
The tree of lies

Qliphoth
Emerging from the shadows
Guide me
To burn the "other side"

Nehemoth
I will slay your throat
Once and for all
Forever to be silenced

Archons
7 to be sacrificed
Relinquished
From this life withdrawn

Rupture
Your chains of servitude
Lacerated
Spirits unleashed

To burn sephiroth

The Tree of Lies
Feeding you it's vermin
Manifest hate
Behold the Tree of Lies
Decimate

Reveal your holy fables
Show them your true colours
Show them your deceit
Your schemes incomplete

For as long as you're breathing
Those legions you're reaching
Propagate your teachings
Incinerate
