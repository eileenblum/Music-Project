Unbearable
Years elapsed, tolerating your blunder
To attain reason, slumber
Man is destined to fall apart and tumble
Resolution failed disorder

Disorder
Grief coinciding with torture injustice
Chains forever bind humanityâs progress
Prosperity molested
By hands of this race infested

Maqabre

Embrace the age of famine
The true union of faith and vermin
In search for liberty,
Impediment misery

This ultimate doom. Your soul impaled
In this tomb. Nailed

Once we walked this necropolis determined (striving)
Pillars of adherence stood tall
Now we pave like mice through shattered ruins (burning)
The spire of Nabu shall fall

Embrace the age of famine
The true union of faith and vermin
Your conscious submits to me
