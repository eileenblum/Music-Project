Born in the year 1984
My eyes were opened
My innocence torn
Torn in a rotten bitter and senseless world
A world that glorifies the spilling of human's blood

I visioned this world descending to ruin
Your false beliefs and faith diminished
Your invalid history planned revolutions
I yearn for your eternal suffering
Endless oppression

Diruo nocens acervus
O tempora!
O mores!

Life is a game of divide and conquer
You're name to think we're meant to prosper
We feed on immorality
Praise the eternal torture
We're spawned from the evil seed torment forever
A disease we scourge
What we embrace
Rationality and comprehension misplaced
An epoch of imprudence
Illusive fantasy detached from common sense and reality

The ones in power and might
Those pigs deceived you
They stole your pride and rights
They have fooled you

Diruo nocens acervus
O tempora!
O mores!

What times you live in!
What morals forsaken
Destructive evil entity
It's in your blood
Your identity
