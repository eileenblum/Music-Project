O the stench of this night conjured me from the land of the dead
O they call it Ø¨Ø±Ø²Ø® the plain that shelters the deceased
O such splendid life you mortals reap with naivety
I shall reveal upon your souls a mislead fact of history

You think this world is bound by desires, pleasures, and lechery

From tablets and sigils these Masons killed for centuries
I come forth to settle these lies these treacherous perjuries

Created by those crafting your pitiful destiny
This consequence you bare lacking intelligence integrity

Ø¹Ø§Ø¯

We are those whom dwelt in these Pyramids
Yes these structures whom you thought the Pharaohs built.
These monuments were forged by titans of power
Carefully placed, precisely carved, constellation marker

O disgracing torment
We burnt
O tempest ØµØ±ØµØ§Ø±
We were eradicated

O such splendid gospel
My sympathies
For a race so fragile

In the days of calamity
Desultory
7 nights, 8 days of agony
We were perished
Never to be heard
Never to be seen
Sotto voceâ¦ Silently
