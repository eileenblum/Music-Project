Cower to your venal rapture
Disguised
You seep of forged confound insincerity
I am assured you take pleasure
Detached and hacked
To execute your insanity

Immersed in your aberration
Devoured and entrapped
Through moral misconceptions
Rationality restrained
Adherent obsolete
Consumed habitual deceit

I see you running an endless spiral
Imprisoned sadistic inclinations
Enmity your disciples
Combusted desolation

Greed. Is the fire that fuels you
Lead. Your victims to ruin for your twisted apatite through.

I foresee your kind impaled
Tormented idolised
Idolised brilliant depravity

I see you running an endless spiral
Imprisoned sadistic inclinations
Enmity your disciples
Combusted desolation

Cower to your venal rapture
Disguised
You seep of forged confound insincerity
I am assured you take pleasure
Detached and hacked
To execute your insanity
