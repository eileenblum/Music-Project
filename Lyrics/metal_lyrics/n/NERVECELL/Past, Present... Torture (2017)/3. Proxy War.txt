War

This world is paralyzed, like a herd of sheep sent to be slaughtered to their endless disgrace
Those mammals left astray

Feeding on false doctrines forever, enslaved to be tortured
Dragged in a plot betrayed

I lurk behind those curtains
My bloodline extends to show
I am the master of puppets
Beholder of the seven crows

I'm the bearer of mass destruction
Holocausts, massacres and wars
I am a constellation
Of suns and stars and more

This is the tragedy you have been waiting for
Kneel before me and praise this proxy war

For centuries I have guided you to your destiny
I will leave you deceased, for I am your enemy

Those children are weakened, fragile and manipulated
With the message of hate, their minds are guided

Perceptions unbalanced, intuition misled and shattered
Like zombies to their graves delivered

In this realm I am the ruler
Orchestrator of this masquerade
Your blood and tears inspire
The cause of this parade

Your life is just a chapter
In my book of trickery
Many sequels shall follow
To fulfill my deity

The plan of domination laid
Through centuries before
Your prosperity decayed
The fruits of their wars

I am the invisible hands
In this game of chess you see
I determine the king that stands
And the pawn that falls on his knees

I sense your sudden confusion
To this bitter reality
Pardon this haste intrusion
You're just a rotten seed
