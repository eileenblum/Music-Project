Depressing, decay and desolation
Feel the earth, in a state of incomprehension
When the hypocrisy has reached its limit
Its too late to write the recent verdict

But ancient evil deeds
Show us hidden, immoral option

Coming Chaos Clouds

Choose the option
From preaching with evil
From preaching with evil

Coming Chaos Clouds

Looking revenge and harmonisation
Finding the written, the evil invocation
When the sentence, has already been dictated
The abyss rising, will be blessing

Coming Chaos Clouds

Depressing, decay and desolation
Feel the earth, in a state of incomprehension
When the hypocrisy has reached its limit
Its too late to write the recent verdict
