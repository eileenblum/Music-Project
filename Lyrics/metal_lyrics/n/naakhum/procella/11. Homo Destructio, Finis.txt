I am around falseness 
But I am occult in darkness
When the light die by eternity 
Fog and storm lurks violently 

Impure and Foul 
I feel in the world 
Synthetic and fake 
They would be torturated!

Suffering
Dying 
Bleeding
Burning
Homo Destructio, Finis 

Crows will eat their dirty flesh

Human...Whatâs your destiny? 
A day, not too much time ago ...The man he drifted apart from the nature,
he colonized her, transformed and destroyed her...
They have damaged his creator...
The human being will pay for it.

Dragons on the streets 
Flames and ashes on your lips
The Demons, in the hill 
Launch nails to human shield 
Launch nails to human shield! 

Please punish the unnaturally 
Spreading chaos in globality 
There will be no shadows blinded
Once the man were extinguished

Suffering
Dying 
Bleeding
Burning
Homo Destructio, Finis
