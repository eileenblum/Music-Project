The very word "secrecy" is repugnant in a free and open society;
and we are as a people inherently and historically
opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings.
For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy
that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence,
on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections,
on intimidation instead of free choice.
It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources
into the building of a tightly knit,
highly efficient machine that combines military,
diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.
[President John F Kennedy speech]

Economic terrorists
Overthrowing sovereignties
Auctioning the states value

Politic performers
Who are setting wars of false flags
Sacrifying you

Scientists invest in drugs
Inventing the lab diseases
Microchips, cures and implant needs

Pedophile priests
Dogmatic religious gifts
Sanctifying silicone tits

[Chorus]
Bible can call them as the four horsemen
But, they are not the real (hidden) goverment?

Fight, strike, strife against the New World Order

[X2]
A beginning of union
Awake a empathy
In a massive reply
That will be the final bell

A encouraging fate, rising
Like no much time ago
Feeling liberty before the empire fall

Doing the population reduction
Their reason, their race
Controling the tyrannical network
The narcotic and world weapon trade

Supervising the chemtrails tests
Manipulation or the climate change?
Polluting the Gaia's balance with the oil escapes
Fluorides and the GM foods assistance

[Chorus]
Bible can call them as the four horsemen
But, they are not the real (hidden) goverment?

Revolution
Revolution - Humanae Libertas
