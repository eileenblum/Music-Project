The new code: Law of Retaliation
Made by the hands of no human creation
Hammurabi, sent by gods to dynamization
In this age of the final civilization

Hammurabi, coming with the Sin-Muballit's protection
Sixth of the first Babylonian dynasty in consolidation
Justification: Is there Shamash's implication
It's just expansion the only way for the ordination?

Becoming: Civilized
Remain in: The System's enslaved
Becoming: Civilized
Decay at: This System's enslaved

War, Ambition
Free Will Abolition
Population: Impossible usurpation
Eye for an eye in eternal connection
Land control: City-state as heart's circulation

Hammurabi: Sent by gods to dynamization
Hammurabi: Set the final civilization

Lex talionis seems A Fair Punishment?
Hierarchy in Organization management?
Pioneers in this justice development
Kingdom of Babylon! In our hands the real statement...

The first order begins
This blessing with the ambition sings
