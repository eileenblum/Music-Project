Ecofascism is the ultimate agenda of the elite 
Ecology being used politically is a deceit 

Mandatory payment for the carbon footprint on earth 
Full control of the energy perpetuating extinction and death 

Environmental NGOs - controlled opposition 
Silence towards the true responsible of wildlife's demolition 

Slaughter industry, exempt of accusation 
Compassion isn't their foundation 

(Chorus) 
They want to 
Shut down infrastructure 
Grow biofuel, ecofriendly agriculture 
Shut down is the instruction 
Hiding Tesla's free-energy production 

(Chorus) 
They want to 
Shut down infrastructure 
The target is nation state's rupture 
Water pollution, Earth's destruction 
Profit from development's obstruction 

The global panic precedes fundings to the climate science 
New world order is the agenda, supranational alliance 

Geoengineering, climate war they call climate change 
Chemtrails not included in environmentalist's visual range? 

Meanwhile, seizing rainforests to grow animal feed 
Breeding GMO fed livestock, indeed 

Domination through international law, their good deed 
The take over of the natural resources is their creed 

Ecofascism is the ultimate agenda of the elite 
Concentration in large cities, and non-mobility they seek 

It was way too inconvenient to Al Gore 
To mention the industry of dairy, eggs and meat
