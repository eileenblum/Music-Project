Use people - love things 
Being obedient by all means 

Use people - love things 
Tear your own wings 

Use people - love things 
It's not you who pulls the strings 

Exhibitionism - consumerism - automatism 
Worship - posthumanism 

Madness - violence - retardness 
Dive into the irrational vastness 

No-mind zone 
No-consciousness zone
