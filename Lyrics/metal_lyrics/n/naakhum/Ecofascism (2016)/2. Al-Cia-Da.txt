Welcome to the real world 
Where the public relations have your mind controlled 

When the muslim database was used for a destabilizing goal 
Cyclone operation, Kosovo independent, these are some stagings of this dirty role 

The CIA trained Al-Qaeda agents in the territory of the USA 
A fact that can be researched like the western support to the KLA

[Chorus]
AL CIA DA 
Sponsored terrorism in the manipulation media 
AL CIA DA 
Radicalization of control run by designed hysteria 

Facing the 2001, Afghanistan war 
You could ask yourself why a created character would be used then for 

When the trendy people don't get that the liberties are being buried in a hole 
NATO's aberrations - global cartel legions - owners of the whole narco-states control 

The CIA trained Al-Qaeda agents in the territory of the USA 
A fact that can be researched like the origins of ISIS and the FSA
Pretext for endless wars, graundhog day
