You can tell me right from wrong
And you can tell me to stay strong, inside
But all the scars remind me of everything I keep inside

I'm standing in the dark
All alone in your soul
Far away from my fears
I can't run, I can't stay

Tried to forget all the pain, pain again
But all the memories still remain, unchanged
You never realize that everytime I close my eyes

I'm standing in the dark
All alone in your soul
Far away from me now
You can't touch, you can't hurt me

It's always
I'm standing in the dark
All alone in your soul
Far away from me now
You can't touch, you can't hurt me

I'm standing out
So far away from my fears
You can't touch, you can't hurt me
