You realize what you've done
How easy it went away
I am alone, and I'll be the same
It's my life I wait for
Hurray for you, you weigh
You're live down all the way
You stand behind, you wait inside
I know

Suffer in my pride, just stay away
You're in my face, you won't win
You're in my mind, lost inside
You're in my blood

I am the one, and I'm to blame
Too many times before me
The time has come, mistakes were made
There is no wasted time

Suffer in my pride, just stay away
You're in my face, you won't win
You're in my mind, lost inside
You're in my yesterday

Get out, get out
I want you to stay
Get out, get out
Just walk away

You realize what you have done
Ain't easy to walk away

Suffer in my pride, just stay away
You're in my face, you won't win
You're in my mind, lost inside
You're in my yesterday
Wasting away, in my mind
You're in my yesterday
Suffer in my pride, lost inside
You're in my yesterday
