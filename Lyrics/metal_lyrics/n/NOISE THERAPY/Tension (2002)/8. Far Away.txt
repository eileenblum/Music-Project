I'm turning all sideways
Can't understand these days
What I think, what I feel
It's got control of me
What I feel, what I am
It's taking over me
This is what, this is how
This is the way it is
This is how it is

I'm inside, I'm outside
I can not take this anymore
So far away

It's like I don't belong
It's so hard to be strong
What I think, what I feel
It's got control of me
What I feel, what I am
It's taking over me
This is what, this is how
This is the way it is
This is how it is, it's always

So far away, cause we don't know what to say
So far away
I'm inside, I'm outside
I can not take this anymore

So far away, cause we don't know what to say
I'm inside, I'm outside
I can not take this anymore
So far away
So far away
