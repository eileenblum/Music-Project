aaahhh

I can't think, I can't speak, I can't walk
I've no control
I can't feel, I can't hope, I can't cope
I've lost again
Don't know, don't try, don't care
It's not your style
Can't crawl, can't breathe, can't see
Right in front of you

Right in front of you

I can't win, I can't lose, I can't choose
A simple way
I can't go, I can't stay, I can't wait
Another day
I don't need, I don't give, I don't feel
Anything
I can't move, I can't hold, I can't swim
It feels like you're drowning but

You're OK, it takes you away,
You're OK
It takes you away
You feel it, you feel it, you feel it
Inside
You feel it, you feel it, you feel it
Inside
You feel it, you feel it, you feel it
Inside
You feel it, you feel it, you feel it
Inside

I can't think, I can't speak, I can't walk
No control
Can't crawl, you can't breathe, you can't see
Right in front of you

Right in front of you

You're OK
It takes you away
You're OK
It takes you away
You feel it, you feel it, you feel it
You feel it, you feel it, you feel it

You feel it, you feel it, you feel it
Inside
You feel it, you feel it, you feel it
Inside
You feel it, you feel it, you feel it
Inside
You feel it, you feel it, you feel it
Inside
Inside
Inside
Inside
