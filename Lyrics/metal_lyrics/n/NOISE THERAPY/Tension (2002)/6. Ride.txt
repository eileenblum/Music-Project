You know me, and I know you too
Say you're leaving
But I won't let you

I don't want to go on without you
I don't want to go on without you
I don't want to give up on us now
I don't want to give up on this now

We were happy
We had real good times
Now you're leaving
But I won't let you

I don't want to go on without you
I don't want to go on without you
I don't want to give up on us now
I don't want to give up on this now

I don't want to go on without you
I don't want to go on without you
I don't want to give up on us now
I don't want to give up on this now
I don't want to go on without you
I don't want to go on without you
I don't want to give up on us now
I don't want to give up on this now
