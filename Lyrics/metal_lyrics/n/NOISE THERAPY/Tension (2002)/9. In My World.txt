It all started
It seems like yesterday
How'd I get this fucked up anyway
Can't you see what this has done to me
Might as well just throw away the key

Cause I'm gone
And it's nothing new to me
Where do we go from here

Well there's nothing in my world
Can't get in my world anyway

Sit around and stare at the walls all day
Talk to myself can I walk away
Can't you see what this has done to me
Might as well just throw away the key

Cause I'm gone
And it's nothing new to me
Where do we go from here

Well there's nothing in my world
Can't get in my world anyway
Well there's nothing in my world
Can't get in my world anyway

In my way
In my way
There is nothing, nothing
There is nothing, nothing
In my way
There is nothing, nothing
There is nothing, nothing

Cause I'm gone
And it's nothing new to me
Where do we go from here

Well there's nothing in my world now
Can't get in my world anyway
Where do we go from here
Well there's nothing in my world now
Can't get in my world anyway
