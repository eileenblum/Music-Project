Why can't you take what your giving
And give it to me
Why can't you take what your giving
And give it away
Now that you waited to get it
You hide it from me
Now that you waited to get it
You throw it away
You throw it away
Throw it away

Now that you got it
Now take it and keep it from me
Now that you got it
Now take it and keep it away
Now that you've had it you need it,
It gets in the way
Now that you've had it, you need it,
get out of the way, get out of my way
Get away
You've got a lot to learn
From yourself
You've got a lot to learn
You've got a lot to learn
We're the kings, everything's
Been done before way faster

Come with me
And stay for awile
Come and see
What's here in my mind
You've got a lot to learn
Take your time
It's lost on me
You've got a lot to learn
Take your time
You've got a lot to learn

You've got a lot to learn
From yourself
You've got a lot to learn
You've got a lot to learn
We're the kings, everything's
Been done before way faster

You've got a lot to learn
From yourself
You've got a lot to learn
You've got a lot to learn
We're the kings, everything's
Been done before way faster
