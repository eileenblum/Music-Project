You've got the name I can't remember
You've got the face I can't remember
You've got the name and I don't care what
You've got the face but I can't place it
You've got the life but I don't care

GET UP!
GET UP!
GET UP!
GET UP!

I've got the plan but you're not in it
I've got the play but you're not it
I've got the sense to make you senseless
I've got the words to make you breathless
I've got the goods to get to you always

GET UP!
GET UP!
GET UP!
GET UP!

It's coming right behind you. Get out of the way.
You've got it right behind you. You've got to believe.

GET UP!
GET UP!
GET UP!
GET UP!

Get up...and change the things you can't change!
Get up...and show the world you're true face!
Get up...and fight for what you're after!
Get up...and now you'll understand!
