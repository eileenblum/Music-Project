See yourself fall through the cracks that lay under you
Notice you're former self wait as you drift away
I'm getting really scared
I don't know what to do
But it feels so good,
I'm losing all control
Of what I say or do
It's never better than

We fall down... on and on
We fall down... waste away

Searching for answers to questions subconsciously
Weather they're right or wrong everything seems so clear
Here comes another wave... I'm taking off again
So won't you come with me
I feel it happening, we're becoming one
So now you'll understand

We fall down... on and on
We fall down... waste away
We fall down... on and on
We fall down... waste away

Crawling on all fours
I'm laughing at monsters
That sneak up behind me
And pull me again

We fall down... on and on
We fall down... waste away
We fall down... on and on
We fall down... waste away

This is not me, this is not me
On and on
This is what I'm really after
This is not me, this is not me
This is why I
On and on.
