Why I wait for nothing
Why you've taken it all out on me
Why I've stayed I'll never know

All the things you've tried to force down on me
All the reasons why we will never be
What you want for me, what you need from me
What you take from me... how you'll always be

Why I wait for nothing
Why you've taken it all out on me
Why I've stayed I'll never know
But here I go... again

It's the only thing to look forward to
It's they only thing that's worth anything
What you gave to me, what you take from me
What you keep from me
Why you'll always

Why I wait for nothing
Why you've taken it all out on me
Why I've stayed I'll never know

Here we are to waste away
Here we are to waste away
Here we are, we are, we are, we are
Again

Why I wait for nothing
Why you've taken it all out on me
Why I've stayed for nothing
Wait for nothing
Hate for nothing
Why I wait
Why you've taken it all out on me
Why I've stayed I'll never know
But here I go
