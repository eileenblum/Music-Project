An inquisition from below
Insidious work to undermine
A mission of corrosive souls

Craft of the nihilist

Nihilism as a weapon 
An inquisition from below
Insidious work to undermine
A mission of corrosive souls

To emptiness then they believe in the shadows from hell

Craft of the nihilist 
Craft of the nihilist 

Collapsed human reality among the lies of the persistence above the absolute default
Nihilism  just imposed

Nihilism as a weapon 
An inquisition from below
Insidious work to undermine
A mission of corrosive souls

Among philosophers the nihilist is foremost the dark guide 
To emptiness then they believe in the shadows from hell

Craft of the nihilist

Among philosophers the nihilist is foremost the dark guide 
To emptiness then they believe in the shadows 
Among philosophers the nihilist is foremost the dark guide
