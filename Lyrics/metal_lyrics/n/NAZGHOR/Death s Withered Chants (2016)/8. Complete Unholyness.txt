Rebel at dawn battle on earth condemned creator
Fusion at night forbidden song a calamity
Humans adjust conformity so subliminal
Envy and rage on holy ground below etheral skies

Mother of fury and pain storm of reckless mass into the kingdom on earth complete unholyness

Heavânly songs formerly bound to the earth
Mortal inane thee of the world beyond a futile task
Transcend the dusk to the night beyond tranquility
Swallow the seed that grows at the core of the vast abyss

Mother of fury and pain storm of reckless mass into the kingdom on earth complete unholyness
Mother of fury and pain storm of reckless mass into the kingdom on earth complete unholyness
Mother of fury and pain storm of reckless mass into the kingdom on earth complete unholyness

Impious is thee more inspire by the black soar
Dwelling in the land whose lord allows dissection
Feeding by flesh thirsting of  blood like a craving beast  
Now it triumphâs darkened ân spoken of supremacy

Mother of fury and pain storm of reckless mass into the kingdom on earth complete unholyness
Mother of fury and pain storm of reckless mass into the kingdom on earth complete unholyness

Thy who not follow nor dedicates shall walk in eternal freedom
Thy who follow thy who prays shall walk the path to death

Mother of fury and pain storm of reckless mass into the kingdom on earth complete unholyness
