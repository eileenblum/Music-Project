For whom calls in arms wraith hath spoken through its silence 
Onward the potent rage may and hazard witness darkness
Ney has nor never be like highth heavenly salvation
For he will strike with wrath those who spirit he command

Chaos a war on earth a plague
Mankindâs desertion from grace
Perceive what darkness provides
At once it shifts from envy to pride

Above the wings of justice outspread exist its fate
Of desolated sorrow of doom and punishment
His most of miseries shall see for mortalsâ bane
As yet mankind thus follows its rime until the grave

Fearless the ones that saw through pain
Opposer of light in the realm of night
And dwells in the livid flames
By tunes soar deathâs withered chants

Satiate your freedom oh deliver your pride 
Consult with the master his omnipotent
Follow desire as the rite for the death
Follow its stream
Harken the sound of
Deathâs withered chant

For whom calls in arms wraith hath spoken through its silence 
Onward the potent rage may and hazard witness darkness
Ney has nor never be like highth heavenly salvation
For he will strike with wrath those who spirit he command

Chaos a war on earth a plague
Mankindâs desertion from grace
Perceive what darkness provides
At once it shifts from envy to pride

Above the wings of justice outspread exist its fate
Of desolated sorrow of doom and punishment
His most of miseries shall see for mortalsâ bane
As yet mankind thus follows its rime until the grave

Fearless the ones that saw through pain
Opposer of light in the realm of night
And dwells in the livid flames
By tunes soar deathâs withered chants
Fearless the ones that saw through pain
Opposer of light in the realm of night
And dwells in the livid flames by tunes soar deathâs withered chants
