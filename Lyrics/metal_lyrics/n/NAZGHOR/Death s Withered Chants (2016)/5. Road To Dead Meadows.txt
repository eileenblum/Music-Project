Dreadful unhallowed
Underneath the heavens
A fathomless earth a projection

Cold dark inversed
The curse of the maze
A spiritual break disconnection

Dark clouds
Black skies
Cold pathway
Dark clouds
Black skies
Road to dead meadows

An unholy blaze
A place ruled by the dark
A cradle of stench of rotten flesh

Black salvation
Come take my roots
Containing my blood my plague

Dark clouds
Black skies
Cold pathway
Dark clouds
Black skies
Road to dead meadows

Fifth tale of doom as we reveal the path to the regions of sorrow and desolation

Dark clouds black skies road through a cold pathway 
Dark clouds black skies road through a cold pathway 
Dark clouds black skies road through a cold pathway 
Dark clouds black skies road through a cold pathway 

Dark clouds
Black skies
Cold pathway
Dark clouds
Black skies
Road to dead meadows
