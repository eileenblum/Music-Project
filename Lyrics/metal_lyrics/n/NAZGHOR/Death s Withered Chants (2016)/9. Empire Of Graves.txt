Before the great shadow transgress
Abyss host a hellish charge
The chain is tightened between the grave and man
As forlorn abide by mortal arms

Invoke thy aid to your own voice
Let the stream of death command
The chain is tightened between the grave and man
As the end of life commence to serve

A curse tracking its way back
Mother earth the tomb of men
At the edge affliction calls
Discern empire of graves

Inflict along the fields of justice
And burn the lodge of consolation
The chain is tightened between the grave and man
As forlorn abide by mortal arms

Forlorn so is the human glory
Above the lights begin to fade
The chain is tightened between the grave and man
As the end of life commence to serve

Conqueror of the fields of graves
The one who walks on human skulls
Resurrect their bodies in hell
Make them dance among the flames

Declaring the earth
Empire of graves
A funeral spell
Ascension to hell

Empire of graves

The chain is tightened between the grave and man
As forlorn abide by mortal arms
The chain is tightened between the grave and man
As the end of life at his disposal

A curse tracking its way back
Mother earth the tomb of men
At the edge affliction calls
Discern empire of graves

Conqueror of the fields of graves
The one who walks on human skulls
Resurrect their bodies in hell
Make them dance among the flames

Declaring the earth
Empire of graves
A funeral spell
Ascension to hell

Empire of graves

A curse tracking its way back
Mother earth the tomb of men
At the edge affliction calls
Discern empire of graves
