Â 
Nor the divine nor the muse upon earth, into the great black
they shall not
Crossing the man you once took for a God  lord or not still
It dies

Inheritance of the cross
To mankind

Inflicted wounds as a front of a march in front of  his baleful eyes
They canât deny nor set to rest the plague is their living bread
Blaming themselves for the cosmic loss killing in the name of God
Granted from thy as an inner reply the holy world at war

Inheritance of the cross
To mankind

As a response of the side effect since the great but fake messiah
Despite the oath from their  solemn God despite the great paradigm
The holy church drains the human will making them servants of  lies
Trapped in a world as ethics blinds so thus faith for the holy cross

Inheritance of the cross
To mankind

Father forgive them for they do not know what they do
My God my God why have you forsaken me
Father into your hands I commend my spirit

And there was no response
