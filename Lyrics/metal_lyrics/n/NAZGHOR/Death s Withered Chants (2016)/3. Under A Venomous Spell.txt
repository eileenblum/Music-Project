Rejection repudiation of sorrow to reproach
A haze of light draining the living orbs

The illness hymn connects the sky
A reaper of souls
Cosmic sting of unknown chaos
Under a venomous spell

In time at the end the godlings will emerge
Impend at land of mysteries of  life

Lie

The illness hymn connects the sky
Cosmic sting of unknown chaos
A venomous spell

Rejection
Venomous spell

Rejection
Venomous spell
A reaper of souls

The illness hymn connects the sky
A reaper of souls
Cosmic sting of unknown chaos
Under a venomous spell

Concealed deadlock brought through the rusted masses
Bigoted yet sacred a chain as tail of  lies

A reaper of souls

The illness hymn connects the sky
A reaper of souls
Cosmic sting of unknown chaos
Under a venomous spell
