Enmity alliance message of darker essence to fear
For whom not followed a solemn vow into the dark
Thereâs no tomorrow for servants of the native-bright
Arise upon thy

By the power of the essence in the dark 
Rise from the ashes Lucifer I beseech you 

Come on to me

Requiem black mass storm of dead souls infest obsess bringer of scourge

Requiem black mass storm of dead souls infest obsess bringer of unknown scourge

Come on to me

For darkness thy I am the one to idolatries
I am luxurious due to the possession of all you fear
Requiem of souls feeding  from what I bringeth
Arise upon thy

By the power of the essence in the dark 
Rise from the ashes Lucifer I beseech you 

By the power of the essence 
And into the dark
Rise from the ashes 
Lucifer  I
Beseech you 

Requiem black mass storm of dead souls infest obsess bringer of scourge

Requiem black mass storm of dead souls infest obsess bringer of unknown scourge

Supper inflames as sacrifices mean dissipation
Running as captive freaks in a yard forever blind
Thee as a unit thou as a pest forever hunted
Arise upon thy

Come on to me

By the power of the essence 
And into the dark
Rise from the ashes 
Lucifer  I
Beseech you
