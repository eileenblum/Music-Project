I am the vile the beast of whom you fear at night 
The darkest entity
I am the morbid one  prohibited at dawn 
Keeper of fate, spectral highness
Crowned as blaze for nature 
Keeper of hate malignity
Host of souls I am the one yet not touched by the futile yet dessipated light

The black light of the spectral keeper

I am the solid one created from the dark  geniously unsanctified
I am your final stop 
Where angels fall to die 
Ringer of bells and abrogation
Known as satanic magnate I'm the opposer of God divine
Host of shadows and darkness I shall rule the medows populated by flesh and blood

The black light of the spectral keeper

I am the spectral woe the whisperer of pain calamity adherent
Disciple of profane messiah of  the flames  bringer of death guide to the black light
Overlord of the unhallowed 
Rejector to the saintly
The holy crown shall burn underneath his presence

It seems to bleed when hurted
It seems to choke when scared
It seems to pray astray
The mortal sacred spirit
Shall remain in eternal mortification

It seems to bleed when hurted
It seems to choke when scared
It seems to pray astray
The mortal sacred spirit
Shall remain lost forever
