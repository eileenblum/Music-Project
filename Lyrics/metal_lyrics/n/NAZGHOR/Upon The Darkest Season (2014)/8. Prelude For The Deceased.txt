May the time rule fertilization phace
Chained a shadow  death comes to life
A timeless void  with no clamant tasks
And so the sign of paths marks it's way
The numerous of different Gods
As many eyes as many holy lines
The shadow shall command the pawn to obey
Like a marionette with hanging threads

A so the end begins with
Birth and compulsions
Binding the pawn to with doom!
Birth and compulsions
Sentence the pawn to life!
Birth and compulsions
Enslaving the pawn to God!
Birth and compulsions
Leading the pawn to death!

May the essence come upon the absent soul
Lurking in the lights by it self
Trapped in a world surving as a bait
So one day the pawn commence to pray
Liberate this futile members strain
Darker guidance of veracity
Prelude for the deceased that past on
To the afterlife soon will be  elect!

Birth and compulsions
Binding the pawn to with doom!
Birth and compulsions
Sentence the pawn to life!
Birth and compulsions
Enslaving the pawn to God!
Birth and compulsions
Leading the pawn to death!

The day of doom the forthcoming judgement as in fear and justice provides
Not heavens nor earths but salvation
Scattering the ashes of an empty vessel whose soul is flowing beyond the vehement streams of oblivion
Not in this life nor as an innocent embryo shall you find repentance 
While in commitment with the saintly ruler
The burial of the deceased one is an infestation as a ceremony and a graduation for  the bodyless spirit to descend 
In the name of the mighty king of hell grant theyr souls eternal pain
