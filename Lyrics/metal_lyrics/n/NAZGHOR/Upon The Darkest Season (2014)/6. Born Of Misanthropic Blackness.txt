Antisocial eremitic unfriendly misanthropic
In chaos in order all four circulate.
In life in doom every man lies!

Whispers of freedom in early omitted path
long forgotted pilgrimage
Obliterated, destroyed a bogus path
Serving the deceptive God

Harken breed at night
Born impurity
Childrem rise
Obtain pureness

In the alter bed of might in every lands chamber
Suffering must take place
Ye know of sanity as well as darkness
Eliminate heavens phrase
One God!

Antisocial eremitic unfriendly misanthropic
In chaos in order all four circulate.
In life in doom every man lies!

Watcher of duties and laws so called the one
Break your holy cross asunder
Childrem arise and charge the crowned one
Born of misanthropic blackness
