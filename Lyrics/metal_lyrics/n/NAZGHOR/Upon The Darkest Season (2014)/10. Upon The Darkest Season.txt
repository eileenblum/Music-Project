Forthcoming throne of endless black sun
An eclipse set on march
Pale skin riders
Demons on mounts
Dark arbitrators
Legions of war
Regiment of infinite might
An unhollowed realm
Pale skin riders
Demons on mounts
Dark arbitrators
Legions of chaos

Black are the mantles sharp are the swords
Pale are the faces savage the horses
Coming from hell to impale the opposers
Feeding of blood  draining the corpses
Loosen the chains of the  portal of doom
Bathing on fire flaming inferno
To the eons when darkness command
Into the darkest season we may enter

Forthcoming throne of endless black sun
An eclipse set on march
Regiment of infinite might
An unhollowed realm
Pale skin riders
Demons on mounts
Dark arbitrators
Legions of war
Pale skin riders
Demons on mounts
Dark arbitrators
Legions of chaos

Conquest War Famine Death

The tune of eschaton
Shall penetrate the skulls
As man and beast replies
In trance and worshipness
In wait for the arrival
Of the lord him self
When time no longer counts
No man shall be rememered
