A place of burial 
A time when the master requires
Body and soul
Beyond the religious and dirtiness of the world of saints

A place of burial
A dark place to rest
Unholy tomb
Of disembarkation
An unholy spirit
Takes part in this trial
Led by the dark
Essence of evil

Led by the dark sign in the day of sepulchral
Sign  in the day of sepulchral sign

No more churches
Above the sacrosanct ground
All perverted
Tainted by freedom obtained by the one that hunts at night

Sign, in the day of sepulchral
Sign

Led by the dark essence of evil
Un unholy spirit A place of  burial

A place of burial
A dark place to rest
Unholy tomb
Of disembarkation
An unholy spirit
Takes part in this trial
Led by the dark
Essence of evil

Sign, in the day of sepulchral
