Beware the father regenteth, beware the son and his feeble illusions
To despite his kindness one shall award the eyes of the heretic
One shall award the sense of darkness one shall award the eyes of the heretic

To command, to confuse to pervert the mind
Ov sacred possession
Wanderes of the white yet deceitful light
With the cross of deception
Cross the line and make the connection
Trouht the dark and into the pit ov hell
Rising pollution
God is a dictator shepherd of lambs

On demand
All consumed
By  deceitful beauty
Oh satan
come forward
execute  mutiny

Mutiny

From the top of the mouth of divinity
Comes holy contagion
Preconceptions of lies and empty prayers
May ye cry for salvation
Cross the line and make the connection
Trouht the dark and into the pit ov hell
Rising pollution
God is a dictator shepherd of lambs

On demand
All consumed
By  deceitful beauty
Oh satan
come forward
execute  mutiny

Beware the father regenteth, beware the son and his feeble illusions
To despite his kindness one shall award the eyes of the heretic
One shall award the sense of darkness one shall award the eyes of the heretic
