The  frantic roar for devilness
A Godforsaken child
Deserted  isolated
Preposterous in every line
Detached from any cosmic mind
Nihilistic one

Come Asmodeus darkened demon of lust freedom and temptation
Come Lucifer  Darkened demon of pride might and succession
Come Asmodeus!
Come Lucifer!
Rescued child  now as purified by satan
Along the pagans and the unblessed
Reckoning for the kings arrival
Walk child now as purified by satan

The  frantic roar for devilness
A Godforsaken child
Deserted  isolated
Preposterous in every line
Detached from any cosmic mind
Nihilistic one

Come Asmodeus darkened demon of lust freedom and temptation
Come Lucifer  Darkened demon of pride might and succession
Come Asmodeus!
Come Lucifer!
Rescued child  now as purified by satan
Along the pagans and the unblessed
Reckoning for the kings arrival
Walk child now as purified by satan
