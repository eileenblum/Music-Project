Thousands of skulls  perfect charm  adorning  in disorder
Creatures climbing walls eternal summit
Waters ran  across the lands  meadows of corpses
Red ran the waters brewed with fresh blood

Strife within
Rites of crimson hell
within
Rising kingdom

Halfway down on the most necromous path
Presence  mighty harvester of carcass
Shining signs devil eyes gazing in berserk
Dancing imps  laughing as they burn

Strife within
Rites of crimson hell
within
Rising kingdom hell!

Where the sun never shines it's within
Crimson kingdom!

Strife within
Rites of hell
Strife within
Rising hell

âTis the land far beyond the deepest and darkest
Where the shadows lurk among the dead
Blackened bones  boiling guts  burning in ashes
Voices screaming of pain  eternally

He who walks the path
He who saw the shadows
Though you may die
The darkness prevail
