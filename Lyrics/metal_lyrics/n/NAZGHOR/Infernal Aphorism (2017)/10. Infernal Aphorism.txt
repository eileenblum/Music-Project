INFERNAL
APHORISM
As the sky falls we stand tall
Thou will lose
Eden we may triumph
Thy phrase of glory
Nullificates
Of men's disorder comes disturbance
May will expand may thee die young
Those who not know
Nor can be hurt
For dust thou art ye still they fall
If it ain't broke don't try to fix it
Praised be their hero
But still it fail
But still it fail
The rage of the earth
Grand treasure from hell
Man spared by this strength
May march 'til the end
Rage of the earth treasure from hell
Spared by this strength march 'til the end
Feed of the flesh of
God
Wondrous but massive lie
Symphonies cursing the hollow
Voices brain washing life
Taking away their shadows
Mission set to deprive
On the seventh day
God created nothing he rested
For the rest of its slothful existence
We oppose but this command
We proclaim its perfect error
Taking away their shadows
Mission set to deprive
And so the architects of this nonsense embraced this moral
By creating this holy animation
We oppose but this command
We proclaim its perfect error
Of immortal spirits it ascends
Far from grace ignites its flare
Long live but these soldiers
Covered with the blood from the earth
Let us all witness this force
Henceforth known as
Infernal aphorism
