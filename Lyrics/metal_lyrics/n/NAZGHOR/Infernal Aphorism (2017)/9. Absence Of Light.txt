Absence of light apostates march a left path
Welcome to a place on earth where to dance in sin remain
Welcome to a place on earth where to sentence your temptation
The time has come to march
A left path
Welcome to where meaning bathes in a boiled soup of eyes
Welcome to where meaning lies tied within an infernal night
The time has come to march
A left path
Absence of light
Apostates march
Welcome to a state in life when to gain decline charge
Welcome to a state in life when to gain own possession
The time has come to march
A left path
Welcome to the other side where youâll travel dressed in black
Welcome to the other side true face of absolution
The time has come to march
Left path
All condemned to light
March behind the twilight
We the sinners the guilty ones who renounce and cross the line
We the sinners the guilty ones who renounce and cross the line
All condemned to light
March behind the twilight
Absence of light apostates march a left path
Welcome to a place on earth where to dance in sin remain
Welcome to a place on earth where to sentence your temptation
The time has come to march
A left path
Welcome to where meaning bathes in a boiled soup of eyes
Welcome to where meaning lies tied within an infernal night
The time has come to march
A left path
Absence of light
Apostates march
Welcome to a state in life when to gain decline charge
Welcome to a state in life when to gain own possession
The time has come to march
A left path
Welcome to the other side where youâll travel dressed in black
Welcome to the other side true face of absolution
The time has come to march
Left path
All condemned to light
March behind the twilight
Absence of light
Apostates march
All condemned to light
March behind the twilight
All condemned to light
March behind the twilight
