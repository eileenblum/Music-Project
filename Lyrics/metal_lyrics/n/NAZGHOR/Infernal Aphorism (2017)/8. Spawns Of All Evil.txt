Tenacious defiant strong unchained
Tenacious defiant strong unchained
By a younger generation
As doubtful of existence
Blinded all by their might
Crowned conqueror of pride
Reaching out for the master's wisdom
Spawns of all evil
Fragments from the dark side lies in every mind of those who stand in the shadows rejecting light
Spawns of murkiness lies in every heart of those who claim their freedom to live a side with death
Tenacious defiant strong unchained
Tenacious defiant strong unchained
Children of infected fables
Interwoven by the mist
A posterity of evil
Man or beats shall prevail
Reaching out for the master's wisdom
Spawns of all evil
Fragments from the dark side lies in every mind of those who stand in the shadows rejecting light
Spawns of murkiness lies in every heart of those who claim their freedom to live a side with death
Spawns of all evil
Reaching out
Master wisdom
Reaching out
Spawns of all evil
Fragments from the dark side lies in every mind of those who stand in the shadows rejecting light
Spawns of murkiness lies in every heart of those who claim their freedom to live a side with death
Reaching out for the master's wisdom
Spawns of all evil
Fragments from the dark side lies in every mind of those who stand in the shadows rejecting light
Spawns of murkiness lies in every heart of those who claim their freedom to live a side with death
