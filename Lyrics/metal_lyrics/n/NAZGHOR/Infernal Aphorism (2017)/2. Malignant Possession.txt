Inflicted assembling the dark art as sign of the flame
Expanded with a spell of the throne and the infamous power of hell
Rise against
Subjugate enslave
The holy world
Lands consumed by holy prayers
Bow to thy increasing force
Join the legion of black bones
Cursed inception malignant possession
Transcendent is the fearless command of the voice in your head
Amended on a threshold of where to begin its trans-lucent path
Delight thee most precious of soldiers
In a mission of visible darkness
An infernal raid of souls
In a mission of visible darkness
An infernal raid of souls
Rise against
Subjugate enslave
The holy world
Lands consumed by holy prayers
Bow to thy increasing force
Join the legion of black bones
Cursed inception malignant possession
All hail the throne of might increasing force all hail
All hail the vast flame the power of hell all hail
All hail the fearless bond the great darkness all hail
All hail the infernal raid a cursed inception all hail
Hail throne might flame power bond raid
To whom the arch-enemy sings to thy who bow to heavens we call with words of rage all hail the unholy possession
Rise against

Join the legion of black bones
Cursed inception malignant possession
To whom the arch-enemy sings to thy who bow to heavens we call with words of rage all hail the unholy possession
