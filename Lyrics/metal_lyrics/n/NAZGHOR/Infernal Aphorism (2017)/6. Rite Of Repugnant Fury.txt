The author of flames unilluminated
A structure of pain suffocated
By laws corpses of flesh contaminated
By God winds containing life
Containing death
Eternal night
Eternal war
Dancing around the flames
Of immortality
Rite of repugnant fury
Eternal war
The struggle within of every soul
The ones at the gates black salvation
Shall pass across the great storm
Of God winds containing life
Containing death
Eternal night
Eternal war
Dancing around the flames
Of immortality
Rite of repugnant fury
Eternal war
Rite of repugnant fury
Rite of repugnant fury
Eternal night
Eternal war
Dancing around the flames
Of immortality
Rite of repugnant fury
Eternal war
Eternal night
Eternal war
Eternal rite of repugnant fury
