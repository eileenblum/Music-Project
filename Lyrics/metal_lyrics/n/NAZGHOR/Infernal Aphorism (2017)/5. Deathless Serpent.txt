Twilight beast darkened yet so beautiful
Splendor revolting dread commander
Reaper of the living souls
Show pain to the servants
Instruct with your rage
'Cause great woe of bane
Glorify thy eternal spoken language
Followers waiting in the storm of madness
Reaper of the living souls
Show pain to the servants
Instruct with your rage
'Cause great woe of bane
Beast crown venom pride
Deathless serpent
Deathless serpent
Sea of the powerful blistering core
Dwelling inside the earth
Awaken meadows swallows the corpses
Withering with the earth
Sea of the powerful blistering core
Dwelling inside the earth
Awaken meadows swallows the corpses
Withering with the earth
Reaper of the living souls
Show pain to the servants
Instruct with your rage
'Cause great woe of bane
Distends of flesh illuminated maggots
Praxis the dance of the unknown and death
Reaper of the living souls
Show pain to the servants
Instruct with your rage
'Cause great woe of bane
Beast crown venom pride
Deathless serpent
Deathless serpent
