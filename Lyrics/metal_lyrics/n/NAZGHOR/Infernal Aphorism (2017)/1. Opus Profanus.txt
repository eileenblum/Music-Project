Listen to the words of the abyss
Harken the melodies of my instruments
Raise your skulls and gaze at my spear
For it is true that you are pawns and the beast the lord
Of immortal spirits it ascends
Far from grace ignites its flare
Which rules the shadows and commands the future
Binding the throne and the opposed
To an infallible master
Carved in stone by the fire of temptation
Are the names of the free souls
Let all legions who exiled the prison heaven
Host a race worth dying for
Long live but these soldiers
Covered with the blood from the earth
Let us all witness this force
Henceforth known as
Infernal aphorism
