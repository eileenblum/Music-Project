Maculate terrified religious child of that forbidden cloud wearing darkness
Moderate illuminated engraved mind starred imprisoned witnesses of life's dismay
Violate on their precious abused land a depiction of a fruited garden
Vitiate nullify their grace chant become a host when daylight becomes night
Thundering plains lands to be lost
Gods cannot fail to abide
The wrath of the lord an eternal war total decretion at
Eschaton
Annihilate the abortive celestial light wherein lies are wealth in gloominess
Abrogate off that futile creation squeezing hunger serpents dances at nightfall
Thundering plains lands to be lost
Gods cannot fail to abide
The wrath of the lord an eternal war total decretion at
Eschaton
Rise king of hell arrive
Call dragon king command
Charge on infected nations
Rule lands and seas at war
Eradicate for their clergy's silence voices shut to speak his holy name
Eliminate armies bright like sunlight in the name of the lord 'n the day of wrath
Rise king of hell arrive
Call dragon king command
Charge on infected nations
Rule lands and seas at war
Come to the marked land
Grant us unlimited power
March, march onward the mortals
Force lord omnipotent
Thundering plains lands to be lost
Gods cannot fail to abide
The wrath of the lord an eternal war total decretion at
Eschaton
Thundering plains lands to be lost
Gods cannot fail to abide
The wrath of the lord an eternal war total decretion at
Eschaton
