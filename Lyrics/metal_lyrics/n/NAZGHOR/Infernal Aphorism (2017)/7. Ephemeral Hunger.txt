Ephemeral
Hunger
All the saint
IT devour all the truce
IT devour
All the blame
IT devour all the guilt
IT devour
All the shame
IT devour all the lies
IT devour
All the mercy
IT devour all the grace
IT devour
Despite their oracle's blessing lines
The habitants curse persist
In dungeons angels dance at down
At night they abstain desist
Worshipers of light
Condemned to starve
To justify the Gods
In eternal fall
A curse ephemeral faith
Worshipers of light bound to what darkness devour
A curse ephemeral hunger
Worshipers of light bound to what darkness devour
He brought your death into your world
He brought that forbidden tree
And chained to struggle heavens woe
His tyranny 'til the end
A curse ephemeral faith
Worshipers of light bound to what darkness devour
A curse ephemeral hunger
Worshipers of light bound to what darkness devour
A wizard of the false light stands, while sonorous voices call the name of the son, rise and shine they yell at dawn, in hope to be baptized, as followers of God, they'll receive illumination
A cult of poisoned eyes, without pride or temptation, starving as condemned to pray, to adore what's taken from them, unwise odious order, an ephemeral hunger
All the saint all the truce
IT devour
All the blame all the guilt
IT devour
All the shame all the lies
IT devour
All the mercy all the grace
IT devour
Ephemeral hunger
Worshipers of light
Condemned to starve
To justify the Gods
In eternal fall
