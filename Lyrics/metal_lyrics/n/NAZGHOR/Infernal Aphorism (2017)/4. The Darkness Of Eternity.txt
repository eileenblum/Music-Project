Indestructible circle
As firm as stone
Unyielding structure
Majestic form

Granted with power
Unstoppable might
Baptized in darkness
As tempter's ally

All to be seen
To be seen by his eye
By his eye

In a raging age one must but fight
Against the mortals of poisoned blood

Granted with power
Unstoppable might
Baptized in darkness
As tempter's ally

All to be seen by darkness
By th' infernal serpent
By th' infernal, infernal serpent
As tempters ally
Signed by hell's host

With a vision so clear
Comes a blaze to your sight
Marching the tombs
Of the darkest path

Granted with power
Unstoppable might
Baptized in darkness
As tempter's ally

All to be seen
To be seen by his eye
By his eye

All to be seen by darkness
By th' infernal serpent
By th' infernal, infernal serpent
As tempters ally
Signed by hell's host

All to be seen by his eye

All to be seen by darkness
By th' infernal serpent
By th' infernal, infernal serpent
As tempters ally
Signed by hell's host

The darkness of eternity [2x]
