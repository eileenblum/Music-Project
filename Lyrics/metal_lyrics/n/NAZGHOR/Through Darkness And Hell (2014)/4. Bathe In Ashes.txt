In my dreams I am the portal
A witch a ravens claw
I see the light slowly fading
I am my masters eyes

Between inverted worlds
Of non-existence
Behind every life
lies a scourge

I feel snakes around my presence
I drink poison blood
In this world I follow death
In death I'm alive

Calling the one lord bathe in ashes
Curse my flesh to burn down in ashes
Throne of might decorated in ashes
Calling the one lord bathe in ashes

I lay down my cane
I'll flee the maze of time
Now that I found death
I feel much more alive

I feed the birds my skin and brain
I impale my heart
I'm now the mouth of gloominess
In ashes I fare

Between inverted worlds
Of non-existence
Behind every life
lies a scourge

Calling the one lord bathe in ashes
Curse my flesh to burn down in ashes
Throne of might decorated in ashes
Calling the one lord bathe in ashes
