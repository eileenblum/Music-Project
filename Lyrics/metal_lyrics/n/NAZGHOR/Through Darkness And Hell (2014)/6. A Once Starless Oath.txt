The king, the land, the might, the act of sacrifice
Oldest term and the black book in the elders rime
The blood, the mind, the knife, the lack of sanctified
Once it burns and a scar appears as a mark

Fire! Dagger! A night! An oath!
Fire! Dagger! A night! An oath!

Into the deepest forest
Into the coldest nights
In front of the adherents
I stab my preys heart
Into the blackest shadows
In front of summoned souls
I yell for black alliance
A once starless oath

The beast, the meat, the corpse, the stench of death
In a place so dark one can only see the altar
The cave, the dirt, the norm, the sign, the candlelight
In a circle formed of wraiths and pentagrams

Fire! Dagger! A night! An oath!
Fire! Dagger! A night! An oath!

Into the deepest forest
Into the coldest nights
In front of the adherents
I stab my preys heart
Into the blackest shadows
In front of summoned souls
I yell for black alliance
A once starless oath

The dark replies, the rite, the words from hell
Let the living and the dead make a great connection
The strain, the smoke, the strike, the great success
Execution of an oath for the whole existence
