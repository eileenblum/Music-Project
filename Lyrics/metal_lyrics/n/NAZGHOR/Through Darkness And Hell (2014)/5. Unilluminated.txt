One man arrived at the house of God
Youâll be welcomed so he was told
The man inside this holy temple
Told him to make a confession

The church of God kills and lies
Make the children realize
The truth of this corrupted path
Follow me to the other side

Unilluminated, unilluminated
Follow me now!

He asked why he must do such act
When the Gods all of them lies and murder
Thou they never make this confessions
Still flies from earth to the skies

The church of God kills and lies
Make the children realize
The truth of this corrupted path
Follow me to the other side

Unilluminated, unilluminated
Follow me now!

That man should run like the winter
Yet cold and dark but with freedom
Impious unsanctified irreligious
Free of Gods holy lies

The church of God kills and lies
Make the children realize
The truth of this corrupted path
Follow me to the other side

Unilluminated, unilluminated
Follow me now!
