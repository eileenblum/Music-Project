Die bower of God
Phrasing ireligiously
Like a butchered man
The feast of the unworthy may begin

Into the dark
Follow the path of Satan
I rather die cursed and unblessed

Cursed and unblessed!
Cursed and unblessed!

All the serpent's lust
Venomous avidity
Higher than above
Essentially great, tenaciously

Into the dark
Follow the path of Satan
I rather die cursed and unblessed

Into the dark
Follow the path of Satan
I rather die cursed and unblessed

Cursed and unblessed!
Cursed and unblessed!

In the darkest realm
Far away, underneath
Hail mighty king
Endless are the shadows that embrace you
