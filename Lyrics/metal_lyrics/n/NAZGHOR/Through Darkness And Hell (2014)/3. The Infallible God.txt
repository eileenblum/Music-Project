The infallible God
Flawless one
King of the night
Infallible God

He who want all men to be at the devils side.
In the battle against the saints and the holy church.
Made your guidance bathe the evil that rest inside of me.
Lay a spell as permission for the burning of the cross.

The burning of the cross.
The solid black mass.

There's no sun o there's no light, obscurity is glory.
No faithful angel nor man shall be a holy God.

In the magic circle of black arts.
In the occultic side of life.
There's only one complete.
The one and truly God.
Infallible one.

There's only one
Flawless God
our lord
Master of hell

If there is one
Flawless God
Is our lord, the one and only God
Master of hell!

You are always in the dark, watching those who fall.
Taking care oft he spirits lurking by the lights of God
Make me see the torch that illuminates the dark path
Grant me power cos you are the only one that can

The infallible God, flawless

The one and only God, the infallible one.
