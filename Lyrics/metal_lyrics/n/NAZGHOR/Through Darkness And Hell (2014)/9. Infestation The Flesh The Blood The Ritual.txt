Wide is the line connected between the entity and the host
Created by those that ignites the torch to the path of the dead

Irreligious, pagan, impious
Sacrifice the holy minded
Unholy is the name of the lord
That we today worship as king

The flesh the blood the ritual
An infestation is made

Act of trance like the impish dance
Call of demons words of rabid rimes
The book is been held high as we praise
And consume vast of blood oh

The flesh the blood the ritual
An infestation is made

In the daze state of abstraction
One is free as mist attracts the evil
Force who joins the rite
Dispatching the soul as the body ruts

The flesh the blood the ritual
An infestation is made

Wide is the line connected between the entity and the host
Created by those that ignites the torch to the path of the dead

Infestation
the flesh the
blood
the ritual

Wide is the line connected between the entity and the host
Created by those that ignites the torch to the path of the dead
