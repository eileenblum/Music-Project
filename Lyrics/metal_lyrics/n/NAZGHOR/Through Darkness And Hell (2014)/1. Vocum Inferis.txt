The unholy father invites us to a ceremony
Thus we exhorts the souls around us
To speak his name and impede those who do not prevent God
From expanding his prayers
Cos he is the one master of chaos and darkness
We call upon you oh mighty one
We call the seven trumpets of hell
We salute thy evil one
Let the spirits travel lands
Let the darkness shroud the starry skies
We call the clamorous trumpets
As the hymn of his arrival

Oh Solemn one!
Lord of death and non-Creator
Who shall come to expel the sacred one
And complete the end of divinity
Taking us who remain on a journey
Through darkness and hell
