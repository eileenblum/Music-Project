Tartaros is the core of the abyss
Growing deep in the dark
Entity far beyond space and time
Where evil is born

Deep, down, rising hell

Suffering for the weak and the blind
Mother root of the chosen
Underworld, paradise, afterlife
All the nature of hell

Into, life, we arrive

We come from the womb of Tartaros
We where born in the flames
We come from the womb of Tartaros
We where raised in the dark

We come from a place beyond space and time
We come from a place deep and dark

We come!
Tartaros!

Primordial were the seas of blaze
Eternity a mighty realm
From its womb the dead comes to life
All the souls became one... with chaos

We come from the womb of Tartaros
We where born in the flames
We come from the womb of Tartaros
We where raised in the dark
