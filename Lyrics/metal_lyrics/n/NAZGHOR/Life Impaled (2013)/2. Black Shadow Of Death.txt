Behold black shadow of death.
Another scorch as a symbol.
Shades of the great crimson underground.
Abomination!

The return of the rephaim.
Brought back from tartarous.
Passed through the time of emptyness,
Invoke damnation!

Free the souls,
Breed of sacred illusions.

Descend from the farland.
Anonymous sorcery.
Mist in collusion, blackened skies.
An apparition!

The beauty of murkiness.
Heil perfect withering.
Beckon his name the satanic baron.
Vermification!

Free the souls,
Breed of sacred illusions.

Rise oh Lord!
To land forlorn!
Depopulate!
Sepulcher!


Rise oh Lord!
To land forlorn!
Depopulate!
Sepulcher!

Black shadow,
Of death.


Black shadow,
Of death.


Black shadow,
Of death.
