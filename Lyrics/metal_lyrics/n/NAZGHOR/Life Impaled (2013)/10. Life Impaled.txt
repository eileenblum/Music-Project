Unleash my soul.
From sentenced life.
This world is fake.
And dreams we make.

My heart is cold.
Cold as ice.
My naked mind.
Free from God.

Release my skin.
From filthy flesh.
Burn my skull.
It's beauty glows.

My heart is cold.
Cold as ice.
My naked mind.
Free from God.

Death in life!
Death incise!
Life in death!
Life impaled!

Life in death!
Incise!
In life!
Im-paled!

Unleash my soul from sentenced life,
This world is fake.
And dreams we make.

My heart is cold, cold as ice,
My naked mind.
Free from God.

Release my skin from filthy flesh.
Burn my skull.
It's beauty glows.

My heart is cold, cold as ice,
My naked mind.
Free from God.

Death in life!
Death incise!
Life in death!
Life Im-paled!

Death in life!
Death incise!
Life in death!
Life impaled!...
