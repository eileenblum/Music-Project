Dark lord embraces, carrier of darkness. Paganism, godlessness.

We march as the legion of Satan.
Blood shall fall.
Dancing on fire as shadows.
Reaping breed.

Death calls the underworld, the throne of darkness.
Death calls the underworld, the throne of darkness.

On feasts of rotten human flesh.
The presence of the dark lord.
I proclaim him as my master,
Into the darkest/longest nights.

Darkness!

Dark lord embraces, carrier of darkness. Paganism, godlessness.

He, the one, the mighty master, he emerges from the dark.
He, the one, emerges from the dark. 

On feasts of rotten human flesh.
The presence of the dark lord.
I proclaim him as my master,
Into the darkest/longest nights.

I call Satan, my lord Satan
I call Satan, throne... of darkness
