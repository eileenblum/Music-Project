Hunting, seeking purification by liberating the sane mind.
Scalping the creatures, illuminated draining it's mortal blood.
By  assembling veracity, darkness shall reveal.
Deep in the forest, veiled in it's vapor, shows a demons eyes.

Hunting, seeking, liberating.
Scalping, illuminated mortal blood.
Assembling darkness, revealing truth.
Deep in the forest,  a demon, awaits.

Unholy. Speak his very name.
Allowed. Unstoppable course.
Connected. Worship darkness.
Chosen by, oh the left hand.

Oh so impious.
So unhallowed.
So impious.

Running, screaming inner hate. Antagonize.
Greatness, evil master shows us the path.
Bringing down the rain, inundate the graves.
Making cadavers diabolical, roots

Running screaming inner hate.
Great devil master, guide us.
Watering corpses. An escalation.
Making diabolical roots.

Unholy. Speak his very name.
Allowed. Unstoppable course.
Connected. Worship darkness.
Chosen by, oh the left hand.

Oh so impious.
So unhallowed.
So impious.

Unholy. Speak his very name.
Allowed. Unstoppable course.
Connected. Worship darkness.
Chosen by, oh the left hand.

Oh so impious.
So unhallowed.
So impious.
