The Devil calls my name. A warming, cold voice.
A withered rose, a plague. A kiss of death.

-Misanthropic!
-Acrimonic!

The Devil calls my name. A warming, cold voice.
A withered rose, a plague. A kiss of death.
Far beyond saint. Berserk guidance.
A blazing soul. A reign. The Devils might.


-Misanthropic!
-Acrimonic!

A journey deep inside, into eternity.
Temptation marks the path to domination.
A misanthropic mind, legion of impureness
Our majesty upon theyr desolation.

No angels no eden.
No God no right path.
Nor luminous prayer.
No lucid purify.
So rabidly well.
Devil inside.

Oh lord open. The gates ov hell.
Consume the light. Unleash your rage.
Rule this land. Spread your word.
Anti-cosmic. Invert the world.

-oh lord open. The gates ov hell. Consume the light. Invert the world.


Oh lord open. The gates ov hell.
Anti-cosmic. Devil inside.
Inside!

A journey deep inside, into eternity.
Temptation marks the path to domination.
A misanthropic mind, legion of impureness
Our majesty upon theyr desolation.

Devil inside!
