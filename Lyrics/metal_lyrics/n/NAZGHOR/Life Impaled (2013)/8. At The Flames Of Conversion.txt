Feed the flames of roasted beings.
Killed by sacrifice.
A hellish burn, a divinity,
Brought to life, blessed by filthiness!
Impureness!

Born a slave to white and grace.
Hear the hymn of darkness and grey.
Give in now to burn in hell.
Sainted! Set your flesh on fire!

Loss, deprivation God!
Bloodstained but yet unarmed.
Touched by the underground.
Suffer! Set your flesh on fire!

From heavens! You'll descend, and the flames! You'll embrace.

Sacrifices made.
Free to be reborn.
Gazing at the flames of conversion!

Born a slave to white and grace.
Hear the hymn of darkness and grey.
Give in now to burn in hell.
Sainted! Set your flesh on fire!

Loss, deprivation God!
Bloodstained but yet unarmed.
Touched by the underground.
Suffer! Set your flesh on fire!

Impureness!

Feed the flames of roasted beings.
Killed by sacrifice.
A hellish burn, a divinity,
Brought to life, blessed by filthiness!
Impureness!
Impureness!
Impureness!
