To frozen the light. That kills the horizon. To serve under nightside. To run an exile.
Bringer of shadeness. Lord of holocaust. Destroyer of sanctums. Chaos arrives.

-Blasphemous the skies. Kill!
-Blasphemous the lies. Kill!
-Blasphemous the Gods. Kill!
-Irreverent, profanatory.

Rise! Awake!- Ride! Emerge!
Rise! Awake!- Ride! Emerge!

Crossing the medows. Shepherd of corpses. Conjuring on earth. Hosting the darkness.
Awakened by forces. An unholy might.  Essence from underground. Profane the divine.

-Blasphemous the skies. Kill!
-Blasphemous the lies. Kill!
-Blasphemous the Gods. Kill!
-Irreverent, profanatory.

Rise! Awake!- Ride! Emerge!
Rise! Awake!- Ride! Emerge!

Command those in life. Those who oppose you. They can not hide. From your demand.
Punish the weakest. Abusing the laws. Alter conviction. Proselytize.

-Blasphemous the skies. Kill!
-Blasphemous the lies. Kill!
-Blasphemous the Gods. Kill!
-Irreverent, profanatory.
