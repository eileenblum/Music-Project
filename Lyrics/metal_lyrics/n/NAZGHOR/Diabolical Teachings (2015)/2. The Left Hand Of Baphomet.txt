Architect of eternal silence repulsive as he stands
Once one is at his sight once put to stare the eyes
The goat is malicious once put to exile
Like the enemies of the lord granted the path of doom

Behold the dark path  left hand of Baphomet

Right hand separate left hand join with the lord
Solve separate coagula join with the lord

Evil lord the throne is yours command all your legions
Design the human fall tormented damnation
Connected as in darkness shown by the left hand
Tear down the sacred temple as burning punishment

Right hand separate left hand join with the lord
Solve separate coagula join with the lord

Architect of eternal silence repulsive as he stands
Once one is at his sight once put to stare the eyes
The goat is malicious once put to exile
Like the enemies of the lord granted the path of doom

Coagula join thy left hand of Baphomet

Right hand separate left hand join with the lord
Solve separate coagula join with the lord

Evil lord the throne is yours command all your legions
Design the human fall tormented damnation
Connected as in darkness shown by the left hand
Tear down the sacred temple as burning punishment

Coagula join thy left hand of Baphomet

 As the next day dawned we called loudly upon Baphomet
and they prayed silently calling for their God but no one came to their aid
so we where victorious and we praised to our lord hail Satan hail Satan hail Satan
