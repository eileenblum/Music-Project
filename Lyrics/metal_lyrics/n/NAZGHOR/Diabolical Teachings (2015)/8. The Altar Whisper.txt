In the circle of the black sun a path shall appear
Beyond the mind of the chosen
Open for chaos to be evolve
Echoes of words a hymn at night

Let the ghost shine bright Through the darkest nights Rise from the abyss Stand before us

Come great nightmare! Progeny of darkness Host this dark rite Whispering our names

Streaming blood down our hands vast
Holding the proof of Unholy bathe
Carrier of ash pour the essences dust
Let thy combine for connection

Let the ghost shine bright Through the darkest nights Rise from the abyss Stand before us

Come great nightmare progeny of darkness this is what triggers the altar whisper

Enter my kingdom
Know my secrets
Show me the souls
Of  my allies
Show me the shadows
Of  my enemies
This is devotion
This is what triggers
The altar whisper

The altar whisper The altar whisper

And so itâs ghosts

Come great nightmare! Progeny of darkness Host this dark rite Whispering our names

Enter my kingdom
Know my secrets
Show me the souls
Of  my allies
Show me the shadows
Of  my enemies
This is what triggers
The altar whisper

Come great nightmare progeny of darkness this is what triggers the altar whisper

Come great nightmare! Progeny of darkness Host this dark rite Whispering our names
