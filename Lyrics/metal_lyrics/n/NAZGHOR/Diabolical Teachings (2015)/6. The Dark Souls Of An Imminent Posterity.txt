The dark  souls imminent posterity

All at once  living on earth
Reckon to death repeating life
Non-cosmic procreation
All this souls wander as lost
Thus shall embark a greater sail
To a timeless discurtion

An imminent a pilgrimage born pure evil posterity

Reckon to death repeating life the ones that falls at the warfare of pain
Thus shall embark a greater sail obtaining power received by the blackest light
Reckon to death repeating life the ones that falls at the warfare of pain
Thus shall embark a greater sail obtaining power received by the blackest of lights

Dark mantra singing of the dead
Black magic incantation hex
Dark souls

The dark  souls imminent posterity

Come guardian be the ruler
Of the ones souls choosing the dark
Full of ravenous hate
Come darkness paint them with blood
Let them hold on the axe of strain
Charged with eternal rage

They shall bow to thy as dedicated  becomes one with chaos under his demand

All at once Reckon to death Come guardian Come darkness
All at once Reckon to death Come guardian

Dark mantra singing of the dead
Black magic incantation hex
Dark souls

All at once Reckon to death Come guardian Come darkness

An imminent a pilgrimage born pure evil posterity

Of the ones souls choosing the dark shall be guided by the devil inside
Let them hold on the axe of strain and into war against remaining souls in lies
Of the ones souls choosing the dark shall be guided by the devil inside
Let them hold on the axe of strain and into war against remaining souls in lifes lies
