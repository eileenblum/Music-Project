Father o Satan deliverer of death ruler of hell cast a spell for the invocation that I desire

Drink my blood and keep me safe from the lights I will turn to reach the wisdom you possess
as above so below

Oh mighty one!
Sever the ties!
Let me become
The antichrist
In the name of the almighty Satan I will become the atichrist

Prayer of death and complete devour  ringing bells infernal kingdom I come to salute  and the flames I'll embrace
Essence and dark magic become one let me be your apprentice so grant me power to destroy to erase life illusion

Oh mighty one!

Unchain my arms
Expel my weakness
Release my fury
Dismiss my body
Discharge my heart
Liberate my soul
Detach my threads
Free my mind
Unbind my sight
Unlock my visions
Undo my life
Let me become
The antichrist

Oh mighty one sever the ties let me become the antichrist
