Burnt at the crematorium  pulverized
Ashes spreads across the lands boundless
The well of death is on cultivating
Evil spirits captivating undertaking 
Might given to these pawns an illusion
Humans cease to be so pride now irreligious
Sworn to sacred holiness fingers crossed
To follow angels trail through the skies

Veneration to the Gods
Dedication to the cult
Veneration to the Gods
Dedication to the cult

Dispose the human flesh as inhumanation
Expose it to the flames ashes in cremation

Veneration to the Gods
Dedication to the cult
Veneration to the Gods
Dedication to the cult

Dispose the human flesh as inhumanation
Expose it to the flames ashes in cremation

Withdrawing from their teachings renounce
Approaching to the dead making contact
Burning their people to ashes set ablaze
To praise the lord of death underground

Dispose the human flesh as inhumanation
Expose it to the flames ashes in cremation
Dispose the human flesh as inhumanation
Expose it to the flames ashes in cremation

Cremation
The satanic rite

Cremation

Cremation
The satanic rite

As the living meets the dead

Dispose the human flesh as inhumanation
Expose it to the flames ashes in cremation
Dispose the human ashes in cremation
