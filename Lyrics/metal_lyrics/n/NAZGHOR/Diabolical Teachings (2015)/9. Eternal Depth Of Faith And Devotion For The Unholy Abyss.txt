As the clock runs itâs course I found my self struck by absolutions bedevil
As I turn I found my self unchained but brave I devote my self to a greater faith

Now I call for thy  Greatest of all kings My father to be Come on to me I lay down for thy
My yells are worthy  By your side Iâll sit  Arise our majesty

Eternal depth of faith and devotion for the unholy abyss

Wherein pain turn into joy youâll judge my soul to a desolated point of penance
At that time Iâll be crowned by the true great lord Iâll redeem my soul thou now descendeth

Home of strain plague of men as slain as won a corrupted anxious place of birth
Hateful song cure my brain as my sight make a path so that I can walkt to the unseen

Now I call for thy  Greatest of all kings My father to be Come on to me I lay down for thy
My yells are worthy  By your side Iâll sit  Arise our majesty In this garden Iâll feed Yourâs an eternity My master indeed  Enchanted faculty  Bringer of me for thy  Your appearance is truly
No God of sympathy Your hateâs my harmony

Eternal depth of faith and devotion for the unholy abyss

Hear my cry hear my call a hunger a devotion like a reckless yell of desperation
In the fields lies the tombs of those that sworn to a pollution of religious ache

Eternal depth of faith and devotion for the unholy abyss

I now announce my mortal days a maze at my back and my feet no longer grows nor walk
Bleed my wounds tears may fall one last time now Iâm one with the absolute unholyness

Now I call for thy  Greatest of all kings My father to be Come on to me I lay down for thy
My yells are worthy  By your side Iâll sit  Arise our majesty In this garden Iâll feed Yourâs an eternity My master indeed  Enchanted faculty  Bringer of me for thy  Your appearance is truly
No God of sympathy Your hateâs my harmony
