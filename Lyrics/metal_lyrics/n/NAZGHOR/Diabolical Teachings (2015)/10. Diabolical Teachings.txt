Weak are the minds of the infected Lost in thy maze Bound to the mysteries of light
Lost inside themselves Somewhere along the way they fall Into temptation
Dressed in the mask of evil force Abomination

Like the memories of thy loathsome God
Slides through your mind you obtain complete might
Like the entities flies across the lands
Spreading endless terror chaos comes as fog

Sworn an oath to the abyss
Weak are the minds of the infected Lost in thy maze Bound to the mysteries of light
Lost inside themselves Somewhere along the way they fall Into temptation
Dressed in the mask of evil force Abomination

Praise to the infernal learn to walk the path inhale the morbid karma combine hate with might
Shattered clouds reforming draining brighten stars enlighten darkest flame unhallowed be thy name

Sworn an oath to the abyss
Weak are the minds of the infected Lost in thy maze Bound to the mysteries of light
Lost inside themselves Somewhere along the way they fall Into temptation
Dressed in the mask of evil force Abomination

Praise to the infernal learn to walk the path inhale the morbid karma combine hate with might
Shattered clouds reforming draining brighten stars enlighten darkest flame unhallowed be thy name
Praise to the infernal learn to walk the path inhale the morbid karma combine hate with might
Shattered clouds reforming draining brighten stars enlighten darkest flame unhallowed be thy name

Sworn an oath to the abyss Sworn as Diabolical to the teachings

Like the crawling worms touches buried corpses
Like the poison spread by the sacred lies

Sworn an oath to the abyss Sworn an oath to the abyss

Youâll oppose existence youâll oppose this world
Nightmares becomes profit and our hate is one

Sworn an oath to the abyss
Weak are the minds of the infected Lost in thy maze Bound to the mysteries of light
Lost inside themselves Somewhere along the way they fall Into temptation
Dressed in the mask of evil force Abomination

Entities of unknown space
Creatures of the night
Followers of darkness
Satan! Shall command
The forthcoming language
Blackened are the species
Allowed to be arisen
Diabolical teachings
