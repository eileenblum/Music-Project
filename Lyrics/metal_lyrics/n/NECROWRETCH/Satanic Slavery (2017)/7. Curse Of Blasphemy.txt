Evil god of blood and hell
We summon thee, we crave your reign
Ritual upon the tombs
At the endless eclipse all will succumb

Come forth, deadly storm
O dreadful lord, serpent of old
Spread now, infernal winds
Torment, pain and suffering

Torment, pain and suffering

Curse of blasphemy

Impious lord, you who reign
Evil god of the dark spells
We spill our blood, we draw the signs
And to darkness we devote our lives

Sacrifice, the beast has called
At his command the blade shall fall
Surrender to the serpent of old
Our lives renounced to the chaos god

To the chaos god

Impious lord, you who reign
Evil god of the dark spells
We spill our blood, we draw the signs
And to darkness we devote our lives

Sacrifice, the beast has called
At his command the blade shall fall
Surrender to the serpent of old
Our lives renounced to the chaos god

Curse of blasphemy
