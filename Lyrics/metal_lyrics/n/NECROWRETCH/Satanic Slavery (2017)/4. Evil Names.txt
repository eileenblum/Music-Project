Vicious horde into the night
Ravaging their rotten lies
Punishment of agony
To absolve their purity
Into this world
And down below
Lie nothing for their souls
But suffering and endless pain
Into evil domain

Cast the terror
Into the heart
Of each beliver
Who deny his might
Cut off their tongues
Ruin their lives
So they cannot preach
Any of their lies

And when their sacred days have passed away
Slay the devotees wherever they stay
Take them captive and starve them to death
Until they bow and embrace his evil

Names
Evil names

Satan reign

nd when their sacred days have passed away
Slay the devotees wherever they stay
Take them captive and starve them to death
Until they bow and embrace his evil

Names
Evil names
Names
Evil names
