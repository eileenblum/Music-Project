Hear, screams of the deceased
Fire, purging your beliefs
Witness, the excruciating sight
Of death, of evil, of Satan's might

Endless torture
Burning soul
Feel the horror
Take its toll

Verses
Verses from the dephs
Verses
Verses from the depths
From the depths of the seventh hell

Weakness, the sole rule of your life
Heaven, a mirage made of deceit
Darkness, the inexorable call
The false god, soon enough shall fall

Endless torture
Burning soul
Feel the horror
Take its toll

Verses
Verses from the dephs
Verses
Verses from the depths
From the depths of the seventh hell

Haven't you thought
Upon sloth
And envy
And upon lust
The fourth, the others, the ones from hell
Laid down on earth by Satan's spells

These are but names which you have named
You and your fathers, your god himself
You live in fear, doubt and distrust
We follow nothing but sin and lust

Satan's realm, the door obscure
Satan's will, the key impure
You live in fear, doubt and distrust
We follow nothing but sin and lust
