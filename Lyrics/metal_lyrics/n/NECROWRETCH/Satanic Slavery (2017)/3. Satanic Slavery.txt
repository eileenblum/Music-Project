Wretched ghoul of the abyss
Who lies in underground ruins
Feel the mighty grasp of his will
He chose you of all other beings

Rise

Slave of sin
Sinful bound
Bound by flames
Flames of Satan's
Slaves

Evil steered your way out of distress
As one without hope cannot rest
Under his command you shall witness
The possession from your weakness

Bow

A burning fiery storm
In place of limbs
Sulfur-casted crown
Pestilential wings
Spreading endless lies
Doomed to deception
You will never die

Satanic slavery
Eternal pain
Satanic slavery
Sadistic flame
Satanic slavery
Agony reign
Satanic slavery
In Satan's name

Embrace evil flames of Satan's slaves

Wretched ghoul of the abyss
Who lies in underground ruins
Feel the mighty grasp of his will
He chose you of all other beings

Rise

Slave of sin
Sinful bound
Bound by flames
Flames of Satan's
