As a filthy plague his will has spread
Infecting yourself until skin turns dead
Your rancid body cracks and reeks
Yet your funerals are just the beginning

Venomous psalms infest thy skull
Insidious chants break thy soul
Impious blessing you just deserve
Forever bound with who dwells in Hell

Black Death Communion - Possessed by the power of Satan

Far away from your mortal life
Face that beyond thereâs only dark
Let the devilâs spell embrace
And seal your fate into the flames of Hell

Draw the circle
Summon the Lord of Hell

Black Death Communion - Possessed by the power of Satan
Satan
