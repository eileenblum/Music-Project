Itâs the fall of Christian empire
A downfall in darkness, tear of mankind
The sinners turned into deadly preachers
And the putrid winds of death possess their souls

The Devilâs night embraces the earth
While the sky is torn by a red shade of death
Christiansâ legacy falls into obscurity
And deathâs supreme force feeds on their screams

At the gates of Hell the pact is sealed
One thousand deaths they will receive
Their poisoned faith, their souls defiled
And forever doomed into an endless night
