Riding Death - The arrival
We came from Hell - With Serpents Scourge

The sky is filled with fire and smoke
A shade summoned by sorcery
We seek, we kill, we feast, we breed
They canât escape the devilâs league

We feast off their doom

Unholy - irresistible
Nightmarish â we are discord

My creatures were all spawned in sin
Now they feast off human breed
If your god is so almighty
Where is he in the hour of need?

We feast off their doom

The sky is filled with fire and smoke
A shade summoned by sorcery
We seek, we kill, we feast, we breed
We came from Hell to feast off their doom
