Canât you hear the infernal bells?
With scorn they drag your soul to hell
Succumb to the evil beast
To Hell youâre sworn, to death youâll kneel

An orb of black fire in your eyes
Reborn as servant of the night

Slave of Satanâs command, His will speaks by

The bells of evil schism

Ritual of necromancy, Pentagram of Sorcery
Sacrifice by crucifixion, Spread the plague of desecration

Slaughtering the men of Christ, watch the life fade in their eyes
Slave of Satanâs command, His will speaks by

The bells of evil schism

Prophet of the black flame
Through hate and death you spread his name
Unholy youâve become
The evil reverend
Ritual of Necromancy, Pentagram of sorcery
Slave of Satanâs command, His will speaks by

The bells of evil schism
