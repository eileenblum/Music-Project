I appear as a sulphur mist, spawned by the bowels of death
I embrace the abject sinner, my dark shape is nameless sorcery

Bow down to the superior forces of evil
Sanctify my name and desecrate human kind
Raise the altar, seal your fate, into blasphemy
Black as night and grim as death

Unholy cult, servant of darkness, possessed by satanic curse
Slaughtered brains, charred flesh, your rotten soul is bound to me
Chase the holy, crucify them, and let the fire consume their guts
As they cease to exist, their agony is feeding me

On the cross, throne the scraps
The fallen cult, of Jesus Christ
Now bow to me, embrace the beast
With Serpents Scourge I rise to thee

When the time of god ends into oblivion
Where the chains of faith are riven by hell
The sanctity is soiled by the devilâs plague
Black as night and grim as death

On the cross, thrones the scraps
The fallen cult, of Jesus Christ
Now bow to me, embrace the beast
With Serpents scourge I rise to thee

With Serpents Scourge
