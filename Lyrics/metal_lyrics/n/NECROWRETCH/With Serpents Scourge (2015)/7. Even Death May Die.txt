Beyond I - your temple of evil
Remnants of past horror - tattered priest maniples
Sentenced to holy death - Thou shall rise before I
For with strange aeons - even death may die

Devourer of sanity - corrupter of flesh
Master of the temple - beast of the black space
Harbinger of Doom - resurrect among us
Fall upon our world - bring it whole to dust

I summon Thee, Lord of Hell!

Satanas, Infernal beast of the black space
Satanas, Ravenous corrupter of the flesh

Monarch of all evil - living flame of hell
Feaster of darkness - ripper of the veil
Shatter the holyness - resurrect among us
Fall upon our world - bring it whole to dust

"That is not dead which can eternal lie
And with strange aeons, even Death may die"
