Ravenous pack of growling beasts
Spawned by the entrails of hell
Crossing the gate of the enlightened realm
Seeking for blood and desecration

Viciously raping - reaching for their meal
Shattering the priest - mutilation
Semen of the beast - swallow juice of sin
Inverting the cross - hanging corpses - die

Rancid - fluids - are ingested
While - gnawing - their bones
Devour - them - as miasma falls
Pilgrims - tormented - their extinction

Bestial rites
Goat-headed

The faithful - open wide - savage humiliation
Holy - virgins - offered to the beast
Sadist - sodomy - by the horns of evil
Whipped - quartered - within frantic bleating

Bestial rites
Goat-headed

Pilgrimage - of the beast
Half man - goat-headed priest
Corruption - evil bleat
Flesh clan - bestial spree
