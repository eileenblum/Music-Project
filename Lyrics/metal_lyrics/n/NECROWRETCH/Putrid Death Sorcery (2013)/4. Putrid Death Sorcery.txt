Necromancer I've become
With ancient chaos I spawn the creatures
Under my will - they now proceed - with malignancy
Breaking the ground - fouling the crypt - with putrid powers
Undead terror, crawling from me
Waking the dead with sorcery
Flash in decay - my source of power - I'm addicted to putrefaction
This sanctity - soiled by darkness - our church of procreation

Putrid... death... sorcery

Necromancy - exhume the dead
Frantic ritual - my gruesome ascent
Putrid powers
Death sorcery

Mortem ritu invocare tenebris

Necromancer I've become
With ancient chaos I spawn the creatures
Under my will - they now proceed
With malignancy
Breaking the ground - fouling the crypt
With putrid powers

Pestilential baptism by blood
Stench of decay blackens the cross
Shattering the graves - puking death
Ancient gateway from necromantia
Preachers of doom - total darkness
Putrid... death... sorcery
