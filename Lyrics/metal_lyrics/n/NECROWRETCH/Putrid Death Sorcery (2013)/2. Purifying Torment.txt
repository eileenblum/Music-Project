Tormented by death on your path to Hell
Dark descent to the throne of flames
Torture rack to expiate your sins
Disembowlment
A priest of doom spits your last rites
Hell is near, feel the blinding sight
Melting your flesh, boiling your brain
No escape... from Hell

Burning horrors - hundreds of sinners to be torn
Wind of terror - deafening death roars
Infinite torture - harvesting the souls
The priest of doom - has purified you

Dying again through rancid infestation
A post-mortem abomination
Eggs and larvas under your skin
Endless torment
Stenches of death, blood and sulfur
Makes you puke life to the necromancer
Melting your flesh, boiling your brain
No escape... from Hell

Burning horrors - hundreds of sinners to be torn
Wind of terror - deafening death roars
Infinite torture - harvesting the souls
The priest of doom - has purified you
