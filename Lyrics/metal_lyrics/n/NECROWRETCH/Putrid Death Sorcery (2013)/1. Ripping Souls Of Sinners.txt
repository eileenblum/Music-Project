Midnight rings, bells of damnation
Priest giving absolution
Demented by your sins heâs now
Bashing down penitents
Maniacal zeal, strapping them down
Sacraments of insane
Draining sins, dark fluids of evil
Perfecting his zombie drug

Wretched priest, bells of perdition
Now relished by perversion
The meaning of his holy book
Soiled by his sickness
Unable to stop, youâll never escape
His darkened evil senses
Defiling the faithful, now his only way
Consumed by sinsâ addiction

Eyes... revulsed
Charred flesh
Dark... ritual
Necrowretch
Unholy... darkness... oblivion... sorcery...
Expiation... torment... death... necromancy...
