Darkness rises over the desolated creek
Only one man still lives in this putrid reek
Over his table an ancient cauldron leaks
With his only eye he bends over and seeks

Moon reflecting on the rusted knives
By whom hundred have lost their lives
Piles of flesh and bones, tongue of Evil speaks
With his only eye he bends over and seeks

Nightmares to come, horrors to roam
Morbid fate, in darkness arcanes

Another prey captured, torn to pieces
Sacrifice and torture, evil prophecies

Dakness rises over the desolated creek
Only one man still lives in this putrid reek
Tormented by horrors of his own predictions
Foreseen a priest of doom, impending damnation

Nightmares to come, horrors to roam
Morbid fate, in darkness arcanes
