Moans of - tormented souls
Haunting - the catacombs
As a hideous - fragrance
Summoned - by Evil

Deliver the pestilent - wrath of Hell
Savagely hammering - walls of the chapel
Macabre steps - overrun
Demonic stench - from beyond

Raged upon the realm of the sacred scorn
Black is the curse of putrid revenge
Claiming for warm flesh

As death is embraced, hordes of rotten chunks
Pain and fear must they spread
Disgusting beings

Impious... plague...
