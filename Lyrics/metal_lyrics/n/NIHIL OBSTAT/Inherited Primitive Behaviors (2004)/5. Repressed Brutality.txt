Only pain puried my blames being witness of the confrontation between hatred and reason...
Repressed brutality
My hate for them even destroys my tranquility
As an orgasm without end that innoculates in me all the force
To nail my mark on their chests
The mark of the sing of my thoughts
Wandering in a world of madness where the reason has no place
Sorrounded by my rage
Manipulating my acts
Confusing my ideas
Worm-eated body
My bones now shatter and collapse
Entrails are on the outside of me
Repressed brutality unleashed in this desert of darkness
In seconds this sharp words are slicing
Heart stricken and accomplished
Decades of tortures
Brutality in my life with intense frenzy
To defeat the chains that mark our lives from the inside out
