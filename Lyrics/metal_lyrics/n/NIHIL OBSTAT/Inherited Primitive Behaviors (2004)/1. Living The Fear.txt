I am the hunter and not the prey
I am thoughts without words
Persecutor fear
The nightmare gets worse
Living the fear
A mass hysteria reveals before me
The end comes closer...
Living the fear
But this suffering will never be enough
I feel a world hopeless
The mankind is courageless
Seeing the path in darkness
With my blood stained eyes
Prophesying and announcing
A foundation of this hell...
Living the fear
This body fleshless crowned with thorns
With the breath of a tomb remaining to us
From generation after generation
There is no hope
Only one truth...
Living the fear
I am the hunter and not the prey
I am thoughts beholding the worst
Alone in my life...
Screaming unheard
