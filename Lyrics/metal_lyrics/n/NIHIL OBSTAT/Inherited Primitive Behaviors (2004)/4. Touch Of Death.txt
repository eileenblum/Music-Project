The birth of life
An incounscious pact between body and soul
The awake that we all have taken
Unexpected perturbation
No life after death
In the sublime world no possible way out
Condemned by time
A shinning light devoured by darkness
Forever hidden from the outter world
Agonize-decompose-dead
Never leave
Have no fate
Cursed by doom
Meaningless [x2]
Butchering-bodies
Decay-rotting
Vanishing in the shadows
Leaking poison from my veins
Victim of this painfull touch of death
Vital force flows no more
Victim of this painfull touch of death
Killing
Ripping
Burning...[x4]
Inside my dreams I've lost my breath as I hope for death
Disfuctional brain I'm overwhelmed
I walk in the dark can't see the light end of this path
Behold
Aware
Born
Breed
Pulse
Breath
Expire
The touch of death
I can't concieve all that I stare
Flesh has been ripped from my bones
