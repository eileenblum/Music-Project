Not supposed
To exist
As we search into the origins of our existence
Weird events appear confusing us
Grotesque scenes
A primitive humanoid abducted by unearthly entities
A blend between our primitive ancestors and a highly developed organism...
A whole new race breeding
Infestating
Consuming
With the only purpose to desolate everything in sight
Did we became onto a plague for our own planet?
Must we be annihilated by our own hand?
Mutations controling us
Product of a new kind
Unifiying patterns of self destruction
It's our command to reach the stars to retaliate those who transformed us into this abomination
Parents of the human race
We are the new flesh
We condition ourselves to kill them
