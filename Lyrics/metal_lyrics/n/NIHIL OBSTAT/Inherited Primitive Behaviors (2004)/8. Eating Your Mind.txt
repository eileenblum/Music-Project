Why? Can't you realize?
The truth is shown to your eyes
Can't watch beyond that wall
There's somethings inside you cannot speak
Hate and tears from beyond
Visions of nightmare
See no tomorrow
Look out...
This is the end of mankind
Infected life
Internal dilution
In pain and sorrow
This is the end of mankind
Shocked away
Mind consumption
Fallen down
Low...
Eating your mind
Where's the truth?
What is real?
Where's the life?
Where's the truth?
What is real?
Burn alive
Can you feel it?
Dissolution
In a world of fears
Born and dead
Now you feel it
It's a torture for the eternity
Where's the life? where's the truth?
What is real?
Tell me why? lost your reality?
