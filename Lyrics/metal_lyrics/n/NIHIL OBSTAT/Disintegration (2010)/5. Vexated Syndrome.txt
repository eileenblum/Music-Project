[Nature of the matter]

Born from natural process
The origin of the elemental matter

All the living beings born already dead
An intricate and complex syndrome
To release our evolutionary disease
Compelling our elimination

Waitingâ¦ for their impending doom
Waitingâ¦ for their chain reaction

We are the effect of this devastating entity
Pure remains of nature of the matter

Sordid vexated syndrome
With prophetic visions beyond the time
A malicious terror uncontrolled
Causes the collision of primary energy
Giving origin to destructive forces reign

Upgrade this obsolete being
Bound to elemental matter
And free ourselves from this demise
And praise a new humanity
