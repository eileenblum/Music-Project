[Of our Human Limitations]

As we shift forward across the threshold
We leave behind an existence full of limitations
An intense radiation of particles is consuming our eyes
Evaporating the skin, exterminating all organic tissue

[Chorus (x2):]
Purgeâ¦ Defective humans
Purgeâ¦ Matter involved
Purgeâ¦ Condensed conditions of this stagnation

Threshold of imperfection to decimate restrictions
-Reject limitations
Threshold of imperfection to decimate restrictions
-Obliterate ourselves
Threshold of imperfection to decimate restrictions
Filtering the results of this existence devoided of all reason

[Chorus (x2)]

As we take conscience of our human limitations
We become aware of concepts previously unknown

Loathe the flesh, loathe the soul, and accept existence
In a spastic explosion fissuring the space
To purify this earth, to cleanse this human waste
Step forward and believe, step forward and give yourself
