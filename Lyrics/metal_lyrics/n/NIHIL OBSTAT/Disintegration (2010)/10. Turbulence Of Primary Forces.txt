[A Thousand Suns]

Earth orbits around the sun
A rhythm created from noise
Clouds create patterns against the sun-lit sky
The patterns never are the same

Turbulence of primary forces
Implosion, absurd density achieved
True dimensions are now liberated
Generating the blast of a thousand suns

Man is a device, a creature designed to create
To create, build and compose
To ruin, devastate and remove
With the strength â¦Of primary forces

Burnt by the light of a thousand suns
Vaporized by the heat of a thousand suns

Human population ceasing to exist
Water extracted from the bodies
Atmosphere consuming their lungs
A red intense glow dispels the firmament
How this creature could mislead its way?
How could this creature consume itself?

Burnt by the light of a thousand suns
Vaporized by the heat of a thousand suns

Burnt, erased, cleansed, removed
