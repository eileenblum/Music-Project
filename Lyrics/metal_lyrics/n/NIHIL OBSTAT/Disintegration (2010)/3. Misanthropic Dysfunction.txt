[The ashes of life]

The world ignores another victim
Misanthropyâ¦ our unsociable condition
Manifesting aversionâ¦ to the human contact

Centuries... of abhorrence (by the torment we create)
Return... to the ashes of life (by the torment we create)

Human blood devours intelligence
DNA code entwined disarray!!!

A sordid wretched dream, monstrous mankind

Incoherent science! A high price for a passion so intense

Misanthropic dysfunctionâ¦ Constantly change evolution

Time lapses - Slowly
Space stretches - Crushing
Primary substance - Emanating
Destructive energy - Accumulating
Horrific memories, of our unsociable condition
Misanthropic dysfunction... The ashes of life

Vision is clear, trying to focus
On the fact of our monstrous mankind
Overshadowed by the weight of this grief
This is the era, this is the time
A new chaotic dawn arrives...

Self driven instincts of destruction
Onward to the dark hole of extinction
