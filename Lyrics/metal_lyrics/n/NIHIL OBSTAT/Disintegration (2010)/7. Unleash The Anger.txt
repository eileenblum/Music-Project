[Our Own Demise]

Donât close your eyes to the horror
Donât close your mind to the pain
In the beginning nothing existed
Only the emptiness reigned cold as steel
The chaos waited for its brutal reaction.

Into the dark spiral where all concepts are conceived
Deciphering the enigma of the matter
Conscious of this defect of unethical creation
Now I foresee our own demise.
Unleash the anger - It's our last breath.

The result of this dysfunction is a pile of cadavers
Tied to the fight between evolution and involution
An only thought to unleash the anger
The weak survivesâ¦ the stronger evolves.

Unleash the anger - It's our last breath.
