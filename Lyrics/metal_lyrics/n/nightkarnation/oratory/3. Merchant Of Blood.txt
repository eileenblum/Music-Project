Walking alone in this dark road, no fear
With waves of your distraction, my doom
Bringing alone the deception of ourselves
And together nothing more will dilapidate

No more of their glory
No more of their eternity
I have seen I have bled
Impoverished my skin

Merchant of the blood, which I bled
Consumer of the strength, which I sold

The black boat at the coast
While the shining moon induces
The dark clouds targeting destination
A night full of own cynosure

The black boat at the coast
While the shining moon induces
The dark clouds targeting destination
A night full of own cynosure

Await the son
Await your death
Spirit of life
Fuck your self... And reborn!!

Walking alone in this dark road, no fear
With waves of your distraction, my doom
Bringing alone the deception of ourselves
And together nothing more will dilapidate

No more of their glory
No more of their eternity
I have seen I have bled
Impoverished my skin

Merchant of the blood, which I bled
Consumer of the strength, which I sold

The black boat at the coast
While the shining moon induces...
