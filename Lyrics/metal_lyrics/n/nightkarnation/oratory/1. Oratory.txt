Dying in their sleep
We are proudly to be
All the fire from hell
Shining tonight

Everlasting misguidance lecturing feculent worthless words
Composing the classical canticles about slavery meaning freedom
Slaves trying to release their pain in the defecated oratory
Congregating to feel stronger about their clear weaknesses

In the name of Satan I raise my voice
To fight blindness and misery
In the name of Satan I shall prevail
For thou must fall and abate

Stabbing the crucifix, draining the blood
Lightning striking monastic mortals
The religious mass has come to an end
No more profanation about Satanism

In the name of Satan I raise my voice
To fight blindness and misery
In the name of Satan I shall prevail
For thou must fall and abate

Stabbing the crucifix
Lightning striking
The religious masses
No more profanation

Small words, small minds
Creating a blister of idiocy
Maintaining their beliefs
Enduring the abject cross

Exhorting their deceptions
Quandary secrecy, fools abound
