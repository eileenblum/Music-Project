Singing aloneness while the choir listens
With my rotten voice broken because of you
Feeling like I'm trapped in an abbey
Inside these monastery walls my voice loses loudness

The emanation of your umbra
Hunts my deepest dream, I'm lost in you
I'm the dark sunspot in your turpitude
Enchanting every continuance your ardor

Extirpating any minimal creed left
Your ductile skin I'm hankering
Reckless is their objection of our love
Our dimness laying on a cemetery

Dancing this satanic poem
At dusk with you my ruler
Blur the rest of the world is
We are alone in our hunting lightlessness

The fog that illuminated my emptiness before, has gone
I'm full of your entity, I'm fawning your taste

Longing and glooming your libido
Instead Virgin Mary never felt this fire inside [x4]

Shall we burn in hell unitedly
For these sins we gave birth [x4]

Extirpating any minimal creed, left
Your ductile skin I'm hankering
Reckless is their objection of our love
Our dimness laying on a cemetery

Dancing this satanic poem
At dusk with you my ruler
Blur the rest of the world is
We are alone in our hunting lightlessness
