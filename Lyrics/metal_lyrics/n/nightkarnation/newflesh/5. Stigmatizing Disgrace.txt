At this instance all the subsistence shivers
Since I'm made and simmering with blood
Precipices all around, relinquishing the glory
Sucking the taste and enjoying the remnant

Confined within evilness and misery
Restraining the spaces and areas
Within the confines of the eminence
Felt accomplishment but lacking tact

Puncturing the sacred temple, always
Deflating the enemy's heart and soul
Consecrated war written by these words
Broken successions infiltrated bishop

  Urination of the sacred book
Missionary apathetic causes
Stigmatizing unresponsive beliefs
Setting marks of disgrace, slaves

Criminal acts being looked as sacred words
Enthrallment must be the way to end this

Bloodless creatures faking imaginary soul life
Decompose and pray to live again, slaves

Urination of the sacred book
Missionary apathetic causes
Stigmatizing unresponsive beliefs
Setting marks of disgrace, slaves

[SOLO]

Bloodless creatures faking imaginary soul life
Decompose and pray to live again, slaves

Urination of the sacred book
Missionary apathetic causes
Stigmatizing unresponsive beliefs
Setting marks of disgrace, slaves

Precipices all around, relinquishing the glory
Sucking the taste and enjoying the remnant
