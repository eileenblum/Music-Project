Peeling your amber skin
Taste forever enshrined
Ruffled by only inhaling a moment of time
Layers of filth instantly drawn in blank

Breaking the path of nature
Breaking the path of god

Through
Through unnatural winds of logicalness
A short walk with a three legged beast

Vibrating through the outside
Dying from the inside
A moment in time, already gone
Yearning a feast of this lust

Thou
Thou
Thou Shalt Be

Mouth with teeth
Lips with tongue
Mesmerizing voice
Titillating skeleton

Appetite becoming stronger
Fulfillment has never looked so remote
Becoming and unbecoming
Thou shalt be

Thou
Thou
Thou Shalt Be

Mouth with teeth
Lips with tongue
Mesmerizing voice
Titillating skeleton

Thou Shalt Be
