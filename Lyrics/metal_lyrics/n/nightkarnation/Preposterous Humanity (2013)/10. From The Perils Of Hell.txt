I have grown from the perils of hell [2x]

I was born in hell

I have grown from the perils of hell [2x]

Sister Faustina, prostitute nun
Rising from the fiery pit
To stuff up all my sins
Created us for servitude

Your life has never, never ever lived

While gods are dead
you suck my faith
While gods are dead
you blur my sight
I will feel you
inside your pain
I will kill you
While you stare me

I have grown from the perils of hell [9x]
