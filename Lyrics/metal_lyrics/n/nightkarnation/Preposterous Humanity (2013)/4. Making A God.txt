High priest deluding a virgin
Eyes staring from the throne of god
Masturbating from the skies, raining from the skies
God is aroused, God is aroused!

While sin punishment tempt us to despair
He, thy great, He, thy great, lives in fulfillment
While the sheep advance and reproduce
He, thy great, He, thy great, grows from primitiveness

Wine into blood
Blindness to the seeing
Light into darkness
World is too big to save us all

Doesnât exist [4x]

Ignorant words from two thousand years ago
Priest and a whore reading the scripts
Beauty and death unite forsaken
A world dead and consumed

Making a god, making a lie
Love reality
Making a god, making a lie
Embrace life
Making a god, making a lie
Overcome vicissitudes
Making a god, making a lie
Accept death

Making a god
Making a lie

While sin punishment, tempt us to despair
He, thy great, He, thy great, lives in fulfillment
While the sheep advance and reproduce
He, thy great, He, thy great, grows from primitiveness

Wine into blood
Blindness to the seeing
Light into darkness
World is too big to save us all

Ears can hear
Eyes can see
Brain can perceive
(God) doesnât exist

Doesnât exist [4x]

I rather dance with the devil
Than become part of your sect
I rather die and be buried
Than become a heaven whore

Making a god, making a lie
Love reality
Making a god, making a lie
Embrace life
Making a god, making a lie
Overcome vicissitudes
Making a god, making a lie
Accept death

Making a god
Making a lie
