Over the brink of ending this devotion
Here I come again, determined
To overcome or surrender
This is it, the limit has been reached
The limit has been reached

Once fierce now evanid
My last cards at your disposal
Remnant parts of my inner malady
Contemplating this new world

Shrilling pain, painful [2x]

Left detached in attrition
From this seclusion, self inflected (or not)

Devotion [3x]
Oblivion [2x]
On the verge of devotion
Devotion [4x]
Oblivion [2x]
On the verge of devotion
Devotion [4x]

Pain, pain, pain, painful

Left detached in attrition
From this seclusion, self inflected (or not)

Devotion [3x]
Oblivion [2x]
On the verge of devotion
Devotion [4x]
Oblivion [2x]
On the verge of devotion
Devotion [4x]
