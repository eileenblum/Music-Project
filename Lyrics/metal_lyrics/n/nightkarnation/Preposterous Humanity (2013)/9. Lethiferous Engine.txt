Adulteration of your perception
They have fulfilled the intent
Veneration of benightedness
Disposition to fail
Neutralize their entire succor
Chronicles of our hesitations
Changing, altering and waving
Our self doomed in pain
Bestial creatures foretasting
Your body soon skewed (dead)
Chemical fluid from their jaws
Slaughtered for elation
Lethiferous Engine
Lethiferous
Disparaging our self belief
Twisted religion
Apathy church
Lethiferous engine
Desert of open veins
Dripping red sands
Dripping blood tears
Dahlia anthelions all over the sky
A scarlet end
