From behind a wall of death
Rotten bodies thrown to our side
Thoughts of annihilation, fear in their hearts
Killing spree, preposterous humanity

A breed of oblivious mortals
Spitting on our history
Not learning from our mistakes but retrograding
Exacerbating the infection, exacerbating
Intensify, inflame and worsen
Climbing the pile of decomposing bodies

Decomposing bodies [3x]
Like a king of the rotten
Decomposing bodies [3x]
Like a rotten carnival

Not enough, fingers to count the bodies
Not enough, lives to feed this killing thirst
Coming soon, to your nearest town
Humanity, at its best

Like a king of the rotten
Like a rotten carnival

Fingers to count the bodies
Lives to feed this killing thirst
(Like a king of the rotten
Like a rotten carnival)

Decomposing bodies [3x]
Like a king of the rotten
Decomposing bodies [3x]
Like a rotten carnival

Preposterous Humanity
