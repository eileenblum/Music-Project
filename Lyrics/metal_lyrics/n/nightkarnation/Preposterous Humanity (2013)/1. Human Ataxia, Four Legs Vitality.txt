Human contraption, amazing implotion
Human acerbity, daunting defiance
Shallow race, hollow judgment
Get ready to shatter them all

Shatter them
Shatter them
Shatter them all

Unstable two legged fucks
Our fangs and claws will vibrate
A blood storm never seen before
No more ataxia, two legged fucks

Here I stand among them
Reversed sides a long time ago
While the earth starts to feel again
Humans stammer astounded by their own crudeness

Roar, growl, roar, howl
Roar, growl, roar
Dead boneless bodies for a better ulterior
(Human ataxia, four legs vitality)

Animal becoming animal
Human becoming useless
Animal becoming animal
Human becoming useless
Not even a corpse will fill a purpose
Beginning to shatter
Not even a corpse will fill a purpose
Shatter them all

Asinine of flesh and blood
Inane of heart and warmth
Asinine of flesh and blood
Roar, growl, roar, howl

Dead boneless bodies for a better ulterior
(Human ataxia, four legs vitality)
