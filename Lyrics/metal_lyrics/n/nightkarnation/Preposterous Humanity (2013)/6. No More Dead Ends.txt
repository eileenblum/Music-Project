Only you with authentic and transparent deliverance
Will treasure my deepest closeness
Will treasure my deepest secrets

I question almost every day
What would be of our lives?
If you would still be alive
I rest my self in your remembrance

Going back to those old days
Where all your furtherance tough me plenteous
I recollect the feel of indulgence
We explored with our journeys

You will hoard my deepest secrets
In the rain were everything dissipates

Only you with authentic and transparent deliverance
Will treasure my deepest closeness
Will treasure my deepest secrets

I question almost every day
What would be of our lives?
If you would still be alive
I rest my self in your remembrance

Where was the dead end?
That I almost end up
Reckoning a feasible discern
But inexorably grasping that you are infinitely gone
