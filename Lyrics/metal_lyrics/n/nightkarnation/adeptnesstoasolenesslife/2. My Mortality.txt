Life itself has taught me
That I am more than what I reflect
Life itself has showed me
That trust has died along with the self

I carry myself and no one else
But why? Why must it be?
Can't I confide myself in you
No... seems to be the answer

The very self, of each one of us
Close minded for a reason
Won't open my mind to welcome diseases
Attraction I know how to abnegate

Along in the way of the loneliness
I find these people that always break at some point
Proclaiming hope but always dying inside

Unhappiness tears fall from their faces

Won't open my mind to welcome diseases
Attraction I know how to abnegate

The very self, of each one of us
Close minded for a reason
Won't open my mind to welcome diseases
Attraction I know how to abnegate

My mortality, my knowledge, my mortality
The ignorant will always fall
My mortality, my knowledge, my mortality
Ill use you more than you to me

Those same tears I savored
I'm starting to realize they all taste the same
They carry the lust, misery and disconsolateness
Depreciated being you'll always hurt me

The very self, of each one of us
Close minded for a reason
Won't open my mind to welcome diseases
Attraction I know how to abnegate
