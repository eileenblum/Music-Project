Lost all faith
In what I wanted this to evolve
Blessed by the holy ones
I'm condemned for eternity
Canonized is my hate
To the heavens god
Elders! wanting to beatify
Her soul while my murkiness needs her greater

Visionless eyes see no further, judging what they will never feel
Incurable mortal blindness, degenerated purified minds, burn!
Indistinct humans, nearby, all around, ill try stay away from this detrimental
I will linger! I will linger!

Aphotic I thought my soul was, failure over failure
But things always change, we are congenial oddments
Myriad plain pleasure

Canonized hate
