Vital Existence is what I represent
Expanding each word I learnt
Sometimes the blood misses the priest
The one that betrayed me for a cross

Souls appeared like nothing
Spinning around my aura

The momentum was created
The gates started to open
There he was Abaddon
Waiting for me

Creatures of night crawl to their tombs
We all go down first
Thereâs no angel in earth

They shall be dead
Someone screamed from inside me
Back to earth or back to hell?

Humankind must Die

Past dreams, past fears
The demon, the angel

He Ambushes you everyday, eating your trapped soul
Abysmal pain for the ones that stole god words for gold
God himself had this pain, his words burned our witches in ancient times

New flesh
Humankind must die

Behind the wall that you created
Thereâs something more than what you mean
Your kingdom dying is what I see
Your world is infested and youâre no more
