Abandoned by my own self
Left alone in this inscrutable quagmire
When all the peons eminent
I must acknowledge decease

And when the time comes
Attempt once more
And withdraw
Forever in lastingness

Perpetually breathless to our kind
Gasping decolorized vapid air
All throughout me
A mound of ignorance

Dreams that once seemed impending
Dreams that frenzied into sadness
Nightmares all they are nightmares
A nigrescent caliginous barren wonder land

And when the time comes, for my dreams
Attempt once more, ignited dreams
And withdraw, the ignited dreams
Forever in lastingness, my dreams

Conspicuously I must be vanishing
But how? And why?
Iâm my own exclusive downfall
All I am reflects you
