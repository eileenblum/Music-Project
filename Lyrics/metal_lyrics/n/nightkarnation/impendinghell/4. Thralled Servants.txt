Your sweet eyes
Crying blood
Your sweet lies
Bearing doom
No more
No more
Jesus vassal
Jesus vassal

I am the only savior
Join me and be thralled

Behold, lord, your eternity
Has always been for you
Behold, lord, your eternity
You will never answer my prayers

Finding definitions to disgorge my hate
Mankind has reached a state of ignorance
They always have been carping
Shame on them and shame on you

Your state of decomposing
Makes me feel stronger
The millions of your servants
Make me feel sick
