Thinking of death these days
As a companion I long to meet
I'm just an experiment to others
Just a fucking test

Last days
Make the least
Ease the pain
The mask is fallen

Falling into darkness
Watching the windows fade
This is the fire I'm going through
This is my destiny

Last days
Make the least
Ease the pain
The mask is fallen
