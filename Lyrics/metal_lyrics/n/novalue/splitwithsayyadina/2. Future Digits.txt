Got no names anymore
Just numbers
A combination of digits
Only for control

A number in your head
Your name in their system
Some try to hide it well
Some show it with pride

Dead before birth
Into competition
Treaten like shit from that day
And on till now

Wearing blue uniforms
Knocking heads to pieces
Pointing their guns
Killing just for fun

But point that at me and I'll explode
And take as many as I can with me
