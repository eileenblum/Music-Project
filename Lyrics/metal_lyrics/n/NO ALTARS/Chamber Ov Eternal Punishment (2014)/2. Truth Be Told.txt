No need to lie
My world is dying
&amp; so am I
Now my soul has died
The thought of you
Tears me apart inside

I once had you
But now we're lost in time
I am shamed
All I can do is hide
[2x]

In Hell where no one can hear my cries [2x]

I had everything
That I ever dreamed
Now it's gone
How can this be?
Seven years
Yet it seems to have not meant a thing
All my fears
Have become reality

Carry this till I grow old
This pain will never fold
&amp; this hole in my soul
Will never fucking close

D-E-A-D
That's all I want to be
L-A-S-T
That's all I'll ever be

Truth be told, my soul was sold [4x]

For Lucifer is I
Permissions granted, but in exchange your patience is mine
