Justify your means as to why I'm suffering.
A fate so cruel, but was it meant to be?
I can't comprehend what any of this means.
Now I'll go where I did before.
To the darkest corner of my world.
This hurts, much like it did before.
No hope, seems like things are getting worse.

The darkest days lead me to a deadly change.
In a world without you.
I'm truly going insane.
This nightmare eclipsed my dreams, while I dwelled in pain.

I find myself struggling with the truth.
A part of me died when I lost you.
I was hoping you could hear my voice.
Can't turn back.
I have no choice.
I was hoping you could see my face.
Can't go there.
Though, there's no time I would waste.

Brothers Eternal.
From this world to the inferno.
