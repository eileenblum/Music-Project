You gave so much
&amp; I gave nothing in return
No place to call home
I'll forever wander alone

In my dreams it's you I see
But when I wake
You're not here with me

To be forgiven
Is all that I ask
To be forgotten
Let's kill the past

?

No concern whether I live or die
I have no more fight to continue with life
[2x]

A sad song
For all I've done
A sad song
Will you care
When I'm fucking gone?

I can't help but feel this way
I need to escape this pain
I am plagued by the memories
Scorned by this fate

I beg &amp; plead
For the Devil to take my soul

Any action
As long as it takes me home
[2x]

All hopes are no more
I'm shamed &amp; alone
All thoughts are no more
I'm cursed &amp; alone
