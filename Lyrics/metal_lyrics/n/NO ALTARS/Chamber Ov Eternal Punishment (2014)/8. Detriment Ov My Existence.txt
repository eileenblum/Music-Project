[feat. Shannon Wakeham]The detriment of my existence
A fate with no escape
Endless struggle for meaning
A life with no consolation

Inconsistent dedication
Incompetent solutions
A problem
That can be solved by death
A painful trial
With no end

Deluded, your ashes had
Turned to dust
Yet plagued till dawn
Beginning from dusk

Demons taking over [4x]

&amp; the Devil is over my shoulder
As flames begins to rise
My heart becomes colder

Evil
A Devilish act
Evil
From this horror, I can't go back

No prayers
No signs of hope
No better tomorrow
Allowing me to cope
[2x]
