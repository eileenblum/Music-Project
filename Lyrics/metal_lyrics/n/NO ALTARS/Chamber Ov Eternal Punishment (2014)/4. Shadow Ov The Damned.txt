All questions, no answers
Lord, kill me, much faster
Some solace, I seek
All sorrow, no glee

Why? [4x]

A truth that I refuse to believe
There is no hope in my means
Demons plague, my sleep
This evil weighs, on my feet
The depths below are calling me

Hell is blinding, I can't see
Shadow of the damned in me
I can't breathe
A cancer of my being
A bastard of my dreams

This despair &amp; pain
Won't seem to go away
This disgust &amp; hate
Won't seem to fade
My burdens yesterday
Are problems of today
My problems yesterday
Are burdens of today

With suicide, on my mind
I now know it's time
To end this life

Why live when I can fucking die? [2x]

I never stood a chance
It was all in my past
[2x]

Why live when I can fucking die? [2x]
