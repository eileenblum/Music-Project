The devil's daughter disguised as being heaven sent.
Bound to a meaningless affair of despair and regret.
I should have known, now I'm left alone.
So easily replaced, just another fucking face.
Love led me stray.
Now I dread to see another day.
To think any of it mattered.
Hollow love is now shattered.

This was never meant to be.
There is no you and me.
Nostalgia for the days, when I didn't know your name. [2x]
The poison in the glass.
The love I could never have.

In fear of myself.
I threw it all in to hell.
In fear of tomorrow.
I exchanged bliss for sorrow.
You've made it hard to see the beauty in me.
You've made it hard to believe there's beauty in me.
The beauty in me.

The Devil's daughter disguised as being heaven sent.
You've destroyed my heart, and now there's nothing left. [2x]
