Lost what I love
Now I'm left with nothing
But a pain in my heart
&amp; mental suffering
A perception of bliss
Of a life lived without me

Do you ever, just think of my name?
Do you ever, just picture my face?
Time &amp; time again
I've proved myself to be
The worst friend

Now I'm gone &amp; I'm lost
In this state of agony
Now I'm gone &amp; I'm lost
In this state of apathy

As it seems, there's nothing left
But the pain &amp; regret
Shame &amp; sorrow, nothing less

I look at myself &amp; I wonder
When will this way of life be no longer?
I look for you, &amp; I wander
But I can see you no longer

Long, long &amp; lonely nights
Ever since you've been gone
Long, long &amp; lonely nights
I guess you're never coming home

As I go along
My lonely way
I visualize
Your face
