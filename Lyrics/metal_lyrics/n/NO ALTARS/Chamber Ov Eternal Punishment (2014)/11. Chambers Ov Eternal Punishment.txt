[feat. Matthi of Nasty &amp; Gerado of Bodybag]I've become everything I hate
A ghost of my past
I only have myself to blame
Apathy to agony
I'll watch these chapters burn
Until there's nothing left of me

A false sense of hope
Impaired motivation
Soon I'll be alone
To drown in my own desecration

My insincerity is disgusting
I've taken all, but given nothing

[Matthi]
I'm haunted
&amp; it enters my dreams to call me out
Memories turned nightmares
How bad I'd love to cut them out
Mistakes sliced deep
Deep scars into my mind
Punished for my failures
I try &amp; bleed for human kind

[Gerardo]
Soy una mierda, I mierda morire
I've sold my soul to the slime
Gods of the underworld
No salvation, I'm way passed any hope
Embrace my punishment
Eternal suffering

In this life, I'm a slave to my mistakes
I'll never seize to suffer
Until I'm in my grave

But then I'll dwell in the bane
A damned soul burning in the flames

Chambers of eternal punishment [2x]
Torture, apathy, pain
Depression, agony, &amp; hate

In Hell it never ends
Despair prolongs
Even when I'm fucking dead
Praying for change
Yet remaining the same

Chambers of eternal punishment
Demons haunting in
Lucifer's sanctum of regret
