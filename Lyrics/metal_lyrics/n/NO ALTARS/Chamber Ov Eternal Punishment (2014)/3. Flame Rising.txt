[feat. Noah of World Of Pain]I keep asking what is wrong with me?
All this questioning is so depressing.
This reality is so punishing.
Why won't they let me just be happy?

I feel so hopeless.
I can't control it
Burning in these flames of my memories,
This inadequacy will be the death of me.

Flames rising, my soul is dying.
I stand so empty, with thoughts so deadly.
I need some time to reflect.
I have no hope, all I want is death.
Death, death, death, is it my time yet?

All is wrong because your hope is gone.
Is there any way I can erase your pain?
I've got to learn to stand alone in this world,
And accept the fate of others I cannot change.
I was crying for help, while slowly being drug to hell.

Flames rising, my soul is dying.
I stand so empty, with thoughts so deadly.
