I feel forsaken - everything was taken
I turned against me - I turned against me

Tubes sticking into me
There's blood everywhere
Damn that surgery
Damn the choice I made

The ride of my life
Lasted only for a while
Now the cross I have to bear
Is there for all to see

If I could I'd end this pain
I can't take the shame I feel
But my hands feel too weak
And they say that I need to sleep

But they won't let me sink
Into never ending sleep
Now the cross I have to bear
Is there for all to see

Why do I feel so insecure?
My own body, it won't work
I feel that I'm hanging on
I'm hanging on a thread
I can take this pain but not regret

They say that I must eat
They say that I look weak
What the fuck do they know?
Stay away from me

How I want to end this pain
But my mind is too weak
This fucking cross I have to bear
Is there for all to see

Why do I feel so insecure?
My own body, it won't work
I feel that I'm hanging on
I'm hanging on a thread
I can take this pain but not regret

Now all is on the line
Do I have to read between the lines?
I feel like I'm hanging on
I'm hanging on a thread
I can take this pain but not regret

Why do I feel so insecure?
My own body, it won't work
I feel like I'm hanging on
I'm hanging on a thread
I can take this pain but not regret

Why do I feel so insecure?
My own body, it won't work
I feel like I'm hanging on
I'm hanging on a thread
I can take this pain but not regret

Now all is on the line
Do I have to read between these lines?
I feel like I'm hanging on
I'm hanging on a thread
I can take this pain but not regret
