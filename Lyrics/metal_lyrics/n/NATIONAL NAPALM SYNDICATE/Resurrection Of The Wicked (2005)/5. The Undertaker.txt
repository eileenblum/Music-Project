Jump when they ask you to
Always kneel, learn how to crawl
Take one deep in your ass
Beg for mercy, settle for scrabs
When they tell you you are second rate
You accept it with a pat in your back
You are happy with your crown of thorns
Born to lose, suffer in shame
You suffer in shame...

United we stand, divided we fall
Keep your voice down, learn how to crawl
Why change the well-oiled machine
Let the purpose bless the deed
Let the purpose bless the deed

Well, I'm not your maker
Not the undertaker
I can't give you no reasons
I only have on question

If all men are equal
Well, there must be a reason
Why so many has to suffer
So minority can prosper?

You suffer in shame...
