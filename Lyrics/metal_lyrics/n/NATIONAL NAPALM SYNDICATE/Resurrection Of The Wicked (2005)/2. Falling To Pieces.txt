Lies, how much more lies
You tell them with flashing eyes
If you could see what I can see
See what I can see

See, you think you belong into a place
A place where you're high above the rest
A place for you to get away
Built on lies and shame

Shame, nothing but false words
While you slither away from my eyes
How long you can go
How long you can go

Go, keep your poison apple away from me
There's nothing I want from you
Just keep digging your own grave
Keep digging your own grave

It's falling to pieces
Your empire is crumbling down
You built your own casket
When you started to believe yourself

It's falling to pieces
You made your bed, now lay in it
Why you despise it?
Because you can never break,
never break your frame...

All that commotion caused
By so little words
If you could see what I see

Lies, can't you hear what
You're saying to me
I cannot believe what I see
Don't you have any pride
You're just a waste of my time

Time, can never heal my wounds
Infected from your cheap shots
Say as much as you like
You're twisting knife in your own back
