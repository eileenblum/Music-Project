You forget to say something?
Is there something else to whine about?
Are you looking for compassion?
Don't let the door hit you on your way out

If you think you have problems
Son, you ain't seen nothing yet
But still you want to test me
I'll give you something to whine about

Determination
It drives me on like a noose around my neck
Determination
I've had enough of your stupid shit

There world don't owe you nothing
While you're choking on your silver spoon
Stop whining about nothing
Turn your frustration into something good

Determination
It drives me on like a noose around my neck
Determination
I've had enough of your stupid shit

Did you forget to say something?
Or just want to get your ass kicked?
If you want to keep complaining
Go on, the world don't give a shit
