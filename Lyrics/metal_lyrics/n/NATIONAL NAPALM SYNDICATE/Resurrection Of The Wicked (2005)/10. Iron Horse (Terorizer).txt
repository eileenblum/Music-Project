Another wasted life
Innocent child has to die
Another empty oil well
Another market has fell

Another broken home
Weak must fight against the unknown
Another innocent one
Rotting on a way straight to hell

Another country has to fall
Another mall must be built
Another useless one
Not a hint of a doubt

Another promise gone wrong
Teach the poor how it's done
Now the blind man is leading the blind
Drooling on a leash of the corporate zone

Left right left right left right left right
Bow down to the might of the iron horse
Left right left right left right left right
Stop fighting that war to
Feed the iron horse
Bow down, bow down

Take all that you want
Keep the engines rolling, our bastard son
Nothing can stop the great white way
Higher power will clear its way

Crush the ones with different god
That's the way it's always been done
Never question the great white way
Today is not our lucky day

Left right left right left right left right
Bow down to the might of the iron horse
Left right left right left right left right
Stop fighting that war to
Feed the iron horse

Left right left right left right left right
Bow down to the might of the iron horse
Left right left right left right left right
Stop fighting that war to
Feed the iron horse

All for one and one for all
Spreading rich man's gospel
Across the world
What's the market value of your soul?
Watch how they crush
The maggots of this world
Our imperial son...
