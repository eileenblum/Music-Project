I've been waiting for so long for
Something to come along
Something to take away the pain
Take away this suffering
I tried to numb myself with
With almost every little thing
But being numb is worse than
Feeling nothing, nothing

Still these walls are closing in
I'm stuck in a rat race that no one can win
I wage a war on myself
Hope that it can cure me
All this guilt, this pretending
No one can save me from myself
I wage a war on everything
Until I find the cure for me

This emptiness is nothing but
A reflection of everything
Everything I thought I would need so
I could be finally something
Why can't I look past what
I think I'm supposed to be
Maybe then I'd realise that
I'm not nothing, nothing

Still these walls are closing in
I'm stuck in a rat race that no one can win
I wage a war on myself
Hope that it can cure me
All this guilt, this pretending
No one can save me from myself
I wage a war on everything
Until I find the cure for me
