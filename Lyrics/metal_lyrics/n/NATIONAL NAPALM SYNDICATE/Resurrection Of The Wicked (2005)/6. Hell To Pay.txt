This is the end of everything
Everything there ever was
Low self-esteem is no excuse
You were destined to lose

There was a time when we were friends
Now even the thought just offends
How many options did you have
Before you screwed your friends so bad?

You lie, you cheat
You always betray
You try, you cry
There's hell to pay

When it rains with you, it pours
Still recovering from all the lows
Except no mercy, there shall be none
You had your moment, you had your fun

You lie, you cheat
You always betray
You try, you cry
There's hell to pay

Too many things still unsaid
More blood to be bled
Disappeared without a trace
Oblivion is your right place
There's hell to pay

Who bought your car or your house?
Why are you hiding like a mouse?
You and your lawyers have your lies
But in the end where is your life?
