Cold road ahead
Night wraps me in

Weak - I feel so weak
My eyes are bloody red
God, don't let me sleep at the wheel

You set it off - set it off
Hope the noise will wake you
There's no release - no release
White knuckles will always betray you

Drive - no, I can't stop
Lights flash before my eyes
God, don't let me sleep at the wheel

You set it off - set it off
Hope the noise will wake you
There's no release - no release
White knuckles will always betray you

You set it off - set it off
She wraps me under her wing
There's no release - no release
But the temptation is too big

Air - I need cool air
But heat keeps crawling in
God, don't let me sleep at the wheel

You set it off - set it off
Hope the noise will wake you
There's no release - no release
White knuckles will always betray you

You set it off - set it off
She wraps me under her wing
There's no release - no release
But temptation is too big
