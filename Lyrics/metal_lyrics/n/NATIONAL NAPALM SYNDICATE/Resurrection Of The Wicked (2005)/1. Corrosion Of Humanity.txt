What do you want from me?
Who do you want me to be?
Ain't nothing ever enough?
Please, why won't you stop

Like an itch inside of me
How I scratch it never leaves
Yes, I am addicted to you
I keep falling no matter what I do

You give me pleasure, you give me pain
Now my life goes down the drain
Staring down the barrel of a gun
With my hand on the trigger that
Rules the gun

What do you expect from me?
What can I do to satisfy this need?
Only mirror staring back at me
Just laughing "no more please"

You give me pleasure, you give me pain
Now my life goes down the drain
Staring down the barrel of a gun
With my hand on the trigger that
Rules the gun

Can anyone tell what's wrong, what's right
I've lost everything that's worth a fight
I have fallen way too deep
Lost in corrosion of humanity
