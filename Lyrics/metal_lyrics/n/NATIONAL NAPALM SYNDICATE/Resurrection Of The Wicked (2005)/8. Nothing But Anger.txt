Had enough of all your broken promises
Had enough of being treated like an imbecile
One word too many can drive me out of my mind
One word and I might forget
What's wrong and what's right

No need to hide, I'm sick of hiding my true nature
No need to cry, this is my normal behaviour

You tried to turn me into someone else
Make me your own little household pet
Hell no, I'm not going to take this anymore
Hell no, I'm not going to let you run my world

It's burning my eyes - building inside me
Behind those eyes - my true nature
Like I was buried alive - you pushed me too far
My sweet redemption - nothing but anger

Why can't you see? Why can't you feel?
Why can't you see? Why can't you feel?
What you're trying to do is to turn me
Into something that I can never be

Did you really think you could
Mould me into someone else?
Make me your own little household pet
Guess what, I'm too young for any of this shit
Guess what, I'm too old to learn a new trick

It's burning my eyes - building inside me
Behind those eyes - my true nature
Like I was buried alive - you pushed me too far
My sweet redemption - nothing but anger
