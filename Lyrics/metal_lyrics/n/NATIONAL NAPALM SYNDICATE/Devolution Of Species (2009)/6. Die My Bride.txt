[originally by Murderdolls]Well Iâd rather cut you than the wedding cake
And your bloody guts on my rented tux
And I do, I do, I do wanna kill you
Til death do us part, Iâll tear us apart

Now I kiss your cold dead lips
And I dip my chips in the blood that drips
And I smear the cake right in your face
Let your God take you to a better place

Well I loved you to death
Well I loved you to death

Die, die, die,
Die my bride

And all you ever meant to me
Was absolutely nothing
And with this ring now I the wed
Donât wanna kiss you bitch, wanna bash your head

Well I loved you to death
Well I loved you to death

Die, die, die,
Die my bride
