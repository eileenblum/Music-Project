Take a look in the mirror tell me what do you see?
Another scapegoat will take the burden of truth
It must be easy to put the blame on someone else
Wallow in self pity and feel regret

Born with a golden spoon on your mouth
No worries no regrets just a simple plan
Getting high fucked up way beyond belief
Complain how the world don't give a shit

It takes you high it take you low it shows you places never known
You feel so weak you feel so strong nothing can't go wrong

Always took one step over the edge
Never check the pool before you leap
You think you are a man with so much guts
Smile now but guess who has the final laugh

Nothing but a punk with a fucked up mind
Why bother to punch your lights out
If you haven't learned anything by now
You'll never learn you'll never grow up

I will be have the last laugh
I will smile when you're laying cold on your back
I think before I act

I will have the final say
I will piss on your grave
I'm laughing on your judgement day

It makes you crawl it has total control it shows places no-one wants to know
You are so weak you feel so low and you thought nothing can't go wrong
