Hey, hey, hey I am force of nature
I'm the thorn in the eye of creator
I'm everything your mother warned you about
The one who loves and leaves you hurt, betrayed and lost
I'll charm you with love and compassion
Then I'll eat you up like cancer

First I give then I take, make you sigh make you take
Every lie I will cover with a strawberry smile
Make you cross, make you crush every line you must snuff
Don't forget, you must swallow every single drop

Hey, hey, hey I am true second coming
Of the fake God you worship behind me
I make you squeal I make you beg
Every single lie you can lick from my lips

First i give then i take, make you sigh make you take
Every lie I will cover with a strawberry smile
Make you cross, make you crush every line you must snuff
Don't forget, you must swallow every single drop

Your dancing days are over
Such a shame you couldn't wait any longer
Now the dancing days are over
Play with fire and you're bound to get hurt
Deal with a devil and you're bound to get burned
Deal with a devil and you're bound to get burned

It's over now, it's over now sweet child
No regrets now, no regrets now my sweet child
It's over now, it's over now sweet child
Go regret now, go regret my charity...

Hey, hey, hey I am force of nature
I'm the fake God, I'm the creator
