Someone tell now what hell went wrong
All along we thought that this was our dream world
Now we're trading young, innocent blood for oil
Planning next crusade against the different skintone

Without a sense or a reason why
Our true nature wants fresh blood
No use for sympathy or compassion

Ever since the fall of the opposing days
We have been force fed to this western way
We can't live without a natural enemy
Is there a way to stop this cycle of bloodshed and tears

Without a sense or a reason why
Our true nature wants fresh blood
No use for sympathy or compassion

I am tired of listening to lies
I am sick of alibis
I am standing too close to the edge
With fist in the air, fist in the air

Oh it's such a shame to waste it all away
All that promise of better world fell into decay
How many will go hope wrapped in steel suit
If you're not with us you're against us anyway
