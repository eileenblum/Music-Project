Hello, nice to meet you, let me introduce our name
We are legion 'cause we are many, your every vice is our game

Slowly we are pulling you under
Slowly we are dragging you down
We love your every weakness
We are gonna have much fun

Betrayal, lust and deceit, how we worship your name
Go on, take it one step further, don't you quit on us

Reach just a little bit lower
Go on sink to new heights
Feel your true human instincts
Be the thorn in our crown

And when the final curtain falls
What's the point of regret after all
No light at the end of the tunnel that calls
No-one there nothing at all

Don't try to hide your true being, go let the animal out

Slowly it is pulling you under
Slowly it is dragging you down
It loves your every weakness
You are gonna have much fun

Slowly you pull me under
Slowly you drag me down
Learn to love your every weakness
You are gonna have much fun
