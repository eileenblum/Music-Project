You wanna take a chance with the demons inside your head
See how far you can take it and feel no regret
Want to make them suffer you wanna make them burn
You wanna hear them cry see them run and hide

You want to be the man, be the bringer of the dead
Nothing makes you feel more alive than the cold steel in your hands

It's wearing you out it's dragging you down
The beast in your mind wants to break out
It's out of control eats thru your soul
turns you into stone cold man god
It burns you alive rips thru your mind
Beast has to be killed or buried alive
It has no control breaks out of his hole
Please throw fuel into this funeral pyre

Make them regret make them beg for your repentance and merciful hate
You wanna wipe out the tears of ignorance and shame
But after all is done and all the love turned into hate
Nothing was ever gained your name tarnished forever in shame

Nowhere to run nowhere to hide
This bullet train runs riot tonight
It has no control breaks out of this hole
Please throw fuel into this funeral pyre
It burns you alive rips thru your mind
Beast has to be killed or buried alive
it has no control breaks out of this hole
Please throw fuel into this funeral pyre
