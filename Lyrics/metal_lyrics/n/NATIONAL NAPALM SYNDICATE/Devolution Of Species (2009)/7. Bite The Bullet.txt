Come, stay for a while, be here beside me just take a bite from the bullet with me
in this place where I lay my head I pray for a never ending sleep
All this guilt all this slowly killing pain that seems to drive me insane
I had enough eaten all the shit that I can so come bit the bullet with me

Once filled with this hunger for life all vanished tarnished in shame
Just one, wrong choice that I make all was lost and nothing was gained
Everything I had planned was wiped away in a crimson shade
I swallowed all I can so come bite the bullet with me

I'm going down already out, I'm down for the count
I'm going down already out, I'm down for the count
Just one thing to do, only one thing that is right
Bite the bullet

Nothing was ever gained nothing ventured all burned down
As this crippled body decays I know I've been struck out
Nothing was ever gained nothing ventured all burned down
As this crippled body decays I know I've been struck out
Fuck this no more everything falls apart
Seems like all that I got was these scars that I have

Already out already down face beaten to pulp
Already out fallen out whole body beaten to pulp
Just one thing to do only thing that is right
Bite the bullet
