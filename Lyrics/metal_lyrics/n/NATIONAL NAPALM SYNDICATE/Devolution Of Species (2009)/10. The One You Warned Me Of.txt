I'm trying to catch my breath, it's getting harder to breathe
What is this emptiness I feel it wants to drown me in my misery

I had six wishes all I got was six terrible lies
If I could I'd turn back the clock, six shots to blow my mind

Pain so devastating it infiltrated my mind, turned me into something other than me
I'm not the one I'm supposed to be
It's not that complicated like a snake it slithered into my life
It's not that complicated, I'm the one you warned me of

It felt so harmless it wasn't my drug of choice
i just needed to fill the void, just six shots of ecstasy

When the wolf was awakened, six shots couldn't satisfy it's need
Now the wolf has awakened, nothing can drown that thirst in me

Pain so devastating it infiltrated my mind, turned me
Into something other than me
Face in the mirror can't be me
It's not that complicated like a flood it drowned
Everything that's good in me
It's not that complicated

Terrible lie equals terrible truth
Another broken bottle another empty fool
Terrible lie equals terrible truth
Guess I'm the one you warned me of, warned me of

Still trying to catch my breath six weeks not recollection
Six broken bottle seems to surround me, broken bottle
In the mirror front of me

Drink, drink, drink, drink, filthy maggot be my slave
Drink, drink, drink, drink, find yourself somebody to blame
Drink, drink, drink, drink, filthy maggot be my babe
Drink, drink, drink, drink, be dead from waist down it's not a shame
Be dead from waist down it's not a shame
