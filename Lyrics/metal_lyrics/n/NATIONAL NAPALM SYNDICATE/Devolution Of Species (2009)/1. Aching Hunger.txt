Every night every day, less i fake the more I ache
Every promise every lie, every broken path I try to hide
Not a thing can't go wrong, if I simply play along
Not a thing can't go wrong, if I fake it if I smile along
If I just smile along

Temptation I can't refuse, a torture that I must choose
A self inflicted mass suicide, how I indulge my sick compromise
As it slowly tears me apart

Aching hunger buried into my brain
It feels like I'm slowly going insane
I can't resist the Devil's call
It's all for none and none for all
Aching hunger buried into my brain
It feels like I'm slowly going insane
This aching hunger keeps burning my brain
I yearn it every night and every single day

My addiction my drug of choice, my excuse my fuel my hope
Every promise I've ever broken, all done to serve the path I've chosen
Trapped inside my self made prison, trapped into my mistaken solace
Cures all kills all, keeps me in a circle on a road nowhere

Take it take it go on and take the easy way out
Burn it burn it it's better to burn than fade away
Why I why I why do I choose to be a clown
