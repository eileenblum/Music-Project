Itâs time to tell a tale

There was a girl who lived in south
and she had a terrible disease
she knew it would only take a year or two
she needed help but from who
she met a woman called Lucy Fur
in couple of days they became friends
Lucy said I have something I have to tell
does the word rebirth ring your bell

let the time begin
believe in me

you will be living in a icetower
everything you want you will receive
you will live above the society
no more wasted days and years
sign your name on this dotted line
let us have your life
Iâm the one with cure for your disease
Iâm the one who cares

let the time begin
believe in me
