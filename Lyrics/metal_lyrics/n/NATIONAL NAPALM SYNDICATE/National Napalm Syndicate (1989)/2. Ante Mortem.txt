In my dreams I do what the fuck I want
go to places which donât awake my hiding nature

itâs better feeling than this, thereâs no windows barred

place with no shades, there my soul has no scars

distressed again, time to fade away
no men in black, or do you exist

in my dreams
I see things
I know something new
should I believe it

I know where I came from, and I should go back
theyâre waiting for me, soon Iâll be gone

you will see what happened to me, Iâll be gone
you got all the time in the world, just think about it

youâll be sorry, I know it already now
that doesnât worry me, Iâll be far away
