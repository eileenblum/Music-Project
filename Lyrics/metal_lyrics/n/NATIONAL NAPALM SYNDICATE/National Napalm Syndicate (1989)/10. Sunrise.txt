I donât know what Iâm doing here
Why did they have to take me
I donât see any action around
Just a green horizon ahead

Suicide
The Sun rising

It was just another afternoon
The shadows were evil
Their faces seemed oddly deformed
They arrived in a big black car

Suicide
The sun rising

They waited me in the livingroom
Their pride flowing out of them in waves
They took me away to fight this war
Proudly killing the enemy
Destroying all their plans

Death
The sun rising

Waking in a mine field
Thereâs my enemy to kill
They wonât see me if Iâm lucky enough
I can shoot them to their back
Just couple of meters and Iâm

Dead
The blood red sunrise
