you said this is far too much- better give it up
thoughtless deed you shouldâve known
never will I let you go- never alive
sorry about all the mess I have done

sneaking around your house I open your door
I hide into closet I hear you go to bed
I walk slowly and quietly beside sleeping you
razors blade so beautiful at dark and itâs very cold

you can call 911
I really donât care
she wonât get up
sheâs very much dead

black winged creature comes down to me
she says Iâm your long awaited insanity
whispering getâs louder in my room
thereâs a hole in the wall couple of meters from me
Iâm breaking thru to the other side
Iâm slowly drifting from my sanity

she canât breathe she looks me to my eyeâs
razor blade is cutting deep blood flows free
I fucking hate this shit but this is what she needs
cheating liar bitch, this is something I must do

now sheâs silent and sheâs with me
she wonât get away because she is free
which one awaits, Satan or God
God please no, I donât want to drown in blood

[Chorus]
