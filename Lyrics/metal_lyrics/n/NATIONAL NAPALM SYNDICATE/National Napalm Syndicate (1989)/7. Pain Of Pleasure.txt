strange looking cube,
terrible urge to twist
change my life
earn couple of extra bucks
ripping pain locking me with chains
changing my life to new direction

the game I shouldnât play
the pain of pleasure and the pleasure of pain
I certainly wonât be free after this
extreme prejudice

four creatures from another level of life
what I want is what I get
so sad so painful dirty surgery
without anesthesia no mercy

the game I shouldnât play
the pain of pleasure and the pleasure of pain
I certainly wonât be free after this
extreme prejudice

fear has no limits
they have arrived 
when they have finished
the terror will begin

the pain of pleasure
the pain of pleasure
