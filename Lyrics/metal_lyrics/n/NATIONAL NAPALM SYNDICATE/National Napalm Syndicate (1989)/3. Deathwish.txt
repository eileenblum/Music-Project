when i burn, do i bleed?
my eyes might boil, what would I see?
maybe my future, perhaps my past
senseless curiosity made me a loser

MESSAGE came beyond the grave
CHANCE to see all the world
A DEAL which I regret

you possessed my mind
you are the reason to these crimes
you oppressor of life
driving people toward genocide

just tell me one thing, did I have a choice
deathwish, just a silent voice
growing inqvisition and merciless mutilation
deathwish, just echo from my mind

you possessed my mind
you are the reason for these crimes
you oppressor of life
turning people towards genocide
