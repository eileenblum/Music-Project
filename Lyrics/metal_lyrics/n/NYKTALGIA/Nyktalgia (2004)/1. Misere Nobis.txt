Passive introverted apathy
Wordless in painful misery
The denial of Birth and time
Longing for the time before mine
Unable to exist without repression
I am the Spring of my Depression

Oblivious no world is mine
Discouragement my lamenting Sign
Dwelling disgraceful in morbid emptiness
The everlasting curse of consciousness

Universe of blind Instincts
Uncontrolled emotions, unbridled passions
Orgasmic, Dionysian dizziness
Illusions phantoms of wretched weakness

The godless Prayer that radiates the end
Save me from all Hours - Death obsessed
Beneath the Dead, those careless Skulls
The demand of the flesh, the high-spirited blood
Everything turns to dust
Withers away my mortal remains, my lust.
