Consuming Cosmic Volatility
A Haunting Pessimistic Elegy
Ghostly Vortex of my Obliteration
And the Prodigy of Selfdisspation

Darkness poured forth upon my universe
In one unceasing radiation of gloom
A Heart heavy with the song of the mowing scythe
Spirally floating in antagonising Doom

Convulsive Spasm of the Soul
A chronic perpetual Distress
The Epitome of my Inferno
Dwelling dormant and will-less

Memo ante mortem beatus
Mors ultima linea rerum est
Media in vita in morte sumus
Sic non fuceat Lux Vitae!

A grievous Day lasts a hundred Years
Downhearted Spirit - perish in azure Tears
By the Signum of Mortality I fade away
Forsake myself - I'm torn astray

When All Hope is bleeding out of my soul
Deprived of confidence and Belief
My Life's a ruin in which my future dies.

A Forlorn Maze of Sorrow and Grief...
