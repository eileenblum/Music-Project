these phantoms of the mind lurking subconsciously
the ancient demons inside are still haunting me
this twisted way of life, so decadent - so depriving
driven to insanity, by the secrets i am hiding
a face of evil in front of me
a face of evil terrorizing me

on the path of ancient demons

spinning around in the windmills of destiny
crucified and nailed to the wings at increasing speed
beyond every limit of torture known to man
crying for help i reach out my hand

a face of evil in front of me
a face of evil terrorizing me

on the path of ancient demons
