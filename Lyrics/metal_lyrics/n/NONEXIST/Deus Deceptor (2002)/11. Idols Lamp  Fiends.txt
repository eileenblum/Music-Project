as we came to the point of no return
infected wounds where daggers twist and turn
a wall of love and a wall of hate
to tear it down was the one and only way
idols and fiends - never again

we're swept away by the flood of our mistakes
our silence sent this to an early grave
here we are on this battlefield
are the wounds too deep to be healed?

a divorce of souls yearning for salvation
the ultimate anxiety of separation

a life of shattered dreams
nothing's what it seems (to be)
there's more than meets the eye
still, no more tears to cry

now two lost souls left divided
the Achilles-heel of disrespect and pride

idols and fiends - never again

a divorce of souls yearning for salvation
the ultimate anxiety of separation

a life of shattered dreams
nothing's what it seems (to be)
there's more than meets the eye
still, no more tears to cry
