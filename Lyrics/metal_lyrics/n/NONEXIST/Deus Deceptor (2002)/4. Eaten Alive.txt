drowning in this ocean of monumental waves
far away from the cyberian memorycard-saves
abducted by the currents of my awakening
twisted faces smiling, evoke a quake within
emerging from a world below, degenerating rapidly
claws of reality's got me now, stuck here eternally

an easy target, an easy prey
i am exceeding my domains

if i'll find a way, that leads me out of here
... i cannot stay, have to overcome my fear
wasn't quite prepared for the hostility outside
well-done, medium, rare - i would have been eaten alive

can't stand this pressure
please, get me out of here

an easy target, an easy prey
i am exceeding my domains

i leave this place so dark and sinister
it's too late - the sun has set forever
as the world keeps turning - then fade away into eternity
