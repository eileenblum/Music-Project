divided we will fall into the dark unknown
surrounded by the walls made from hearts of stone
divided we will fall as we're torn apart
hear the final call of a dying star
condemned are those alone long-since separated
the pure freezing cold outside - waiting ...
divided we fall into a dark unknown
divided we fall torn apart by love

unity in misery, practicing what we preach
negative energy, i'm the host - you're the leech
we devastate and clear the way, loss for words - no more to say

divided we fall into a dark unknown
divided we fall torn apart by love
