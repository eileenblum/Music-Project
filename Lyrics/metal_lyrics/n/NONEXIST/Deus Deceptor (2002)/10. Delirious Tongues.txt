headless deceiver, queen of all lies
and you believed her, can't see it in her eyes
realized that what you say just can't be true
a hypocrite, a liar - yes, that is you

into a web of mythologies
writing the script as you speak

you're a liar, you're a fraud .. can't you see?
the slayer of your soul shall be me

transparency, this hypocrisy
getting clearer
you will die by my hand

darkness will surround you, as truth is closing in
sins are not forgotten - you will never win

your tyranny will vanish in the ashes of disgrace
we're heading for the throne, you will be defaced

transparency, this hypocrisy
getting clearer
you will die by my hand

out of this web of mythologies
just break the spell of dishonesty

transparency, this hypocrisy
getting clearer
you will die by my hand
