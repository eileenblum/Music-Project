in the name of god they maim and slay
every non-believer questioning their faith
a conviction so inborn beyond common sense
is there a cure for this ignorance?
you have your god
an image of yourself
in this holy war
that sends us all to hell

"love your neighbour, turn the other cheek"
or isn't global peace what you seek?
just open up and see
paradise won't come so easily

in the name of god they indoctrinate
each and every one of you who's in need of faith
a conviction so inborn beyond common sense
looks like the sword is mightier than the pen

you have your god
an image of yourself
in this holy war
that sends us all to hell

"love your neighbour, turn the other cheek"
or isn't global peace what you seek?
just open up and see
paradise won't come so easily

in the name of who do you obey?
nothing changes if you're on your knees to pray
forget the cross - time to act intelligent
no need for gods, nothing's heaven-sent

you have your god
an image of yourself
in this holy war
that sends us all to hell

"love your neighbour, turn the other cheek"
or isn't global peace what you seek?
just open up and see
paradise won't come so easily
