my life was taken away from me the day that i was born
no such thing as sympathy from the ones who had me
torn apart to pieces, ripping out my heart
memories hunt me down, a refugee at large
each and every day
defending myself
my life in decay
crawl back into my shell

enslaved to guilt for as long as i can remember
the only thing that i know is the darkness of november
these pangs of conscience, no peace of mind
the true meaning of life has been hard to find

each and every day
defending myself
my life in decay
crawl back into my shell
