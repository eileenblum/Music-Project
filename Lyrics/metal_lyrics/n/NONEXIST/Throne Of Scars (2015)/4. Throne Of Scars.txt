These voices
These voices are me
Just me
Always was
Always will be

Whispering emptiness and the wordless pain
Screaming silence across my domain

Concerto if strings, playing my veins
Like violins of violenceâmusic insane
Haunting notes of sadness, agony and tears
Monumental piece
Built throughout the years

Cutâdeep down into the soul
Lostâaimless without a goal
Scarredâbut the body refuse to yield
Determinedâtransformed by a will carved in stone

Second to none
Upon my throne of scars
Reigning in tears and blood

Gathering strength from a sombre past
To build my altar
The throne of scars

These hands
These hands of mine
They build
They tear down
What's left inside
These eyes
These eyes are me
In the mirror black

Something's staring back
From the void of the past

Concerto if strings, playing my veins
Like violins of violenceâmusic insane
Haunting notes of sadness, agony and tears
Monumental piece
Built throughout the years

Dreadâcan no linger keep me down
Strengthâwithin myself now is found
Destroyâblackened cage once called my life
Shed my skinâborn anew
Transformed by a will carved in stone

Second to none
Upon my throne of scars
Reigning in tears and blood

Gathering strength from a sombre past
To build my altar
The throne of scars
