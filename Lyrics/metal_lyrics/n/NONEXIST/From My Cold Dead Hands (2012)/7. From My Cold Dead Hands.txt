Tried to live by your âGodâ but I failed in despair
My cries echo out â is there anyone there
Raging beyond control, above all sense and belief
Woke up dead in the midst of a dream

Dripping drunk from the visions obscene
Help me, get me out of this insane dream
I wonÂ´t let go
My hands grip desperately
YouÂ´ll have to take it
From my cold dead hands
From my cold dead hands

Tried to live by your laws but I spat in your face
Screams of wrath echo out â scorn for the human race
Losing all control, beyond all sense and belief
Woke up dead in the midst of a dream

Dripping drunk from the visions obscene
Help me, get me out of this insane dream
I wonÂ´t let go
My hands grip desperately
YouÂ´ll have to take it
From my cold dead hands
From my cold dead hands

I am not like you
And will never be
You rip and you tear
and try to steal my inner self
Never!
From my cold dead hands
From my cold dead hands
From my cold dead hands

Dripping drunk from the visions obscene
Help me, get me out of this insane dream
I wonÂ´t let go
My hands grip desperately
YouÂ´ll have to take it
From my cold dead hands
From my cold dead hands
