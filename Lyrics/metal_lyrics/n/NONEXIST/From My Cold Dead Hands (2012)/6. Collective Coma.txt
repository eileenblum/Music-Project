Hiding in the shadows and feasting on your minds
Never saw it coming, never saw the signs
Illuminating darkness â rays of psychic reign
Never see it coming â youÂ´ll never feel the pain
Turned on since childhood now youÂ´re a slave
Pacified by pleasure - conditioned to obey

Descending into collective coma
Comfortably dumb â high on apathy
CanÂ´t live without this electronic soma
Turn on â tune in â drop dead

God of sedation â god of the truth
Curse us with your blessings
Subliminal incision â carving without pain
Overlords of transmission - ruling in the shadows
As youÂ´re sleepwalking to the gallows

Descending into collective coma
Comfortably dumb â high on apathy
CanÂ´t live without this electronic soma
Turn on â tune in â drop dead

Conformity â the plague of the modern age
The sheeple walk in line â those fools obey
Paranoia and fear keep the ratings high
Which makes the cash-flow tight

Like the noose around your minds
Like the blind lead the blind
So empty inside

From cradle to coffin
From casket to ashes
All is saved
Eternally
They saw it all

Descending into collective coma
Comfortably dumb â high on apathy
CanÂ´t live without this electronic soma
Turn on â tune in â drop dead
Say farewell to the times of old
ItÂ´s a brave new world
For slaves that never know
Sleep forever more
