Floating in the depths of a blackened space
Haunted spirits doomed to search - forever be enslaved
Curse the void as it slays the dying rays of light
One by one the stars all fall into a deathlike sleep

In emptiness and solitude the cold tears and claws
Ripping at the force of life - ripping it apart
A dark and tortured universe â dominion of no laws
The cycleÂ´s now complete - take us back to the start

Nine dimensions of existence on the verge of collapse
Cannibalistic super-novas transmigrate into black holes
Storms of cosmic violence lay everything to waste
One by one the galaxies implode

In emptiness and solitude the cold tears and claws
Ripping at the force of life ripping it apart
A dark and tortured universe â dominion of no laws
The cycleÂ´s now complete - take us back to the start

Behold the astral darkness
Morphing into nohtingness
Time has ceased to exist
Space has been forlorn

Behold the astral darkness
Morphing into nohtingness
Time has ceased to exist
Space has been forlorn
The true nature of existence now revealed
Nevermore to be concealed
No!

In emptiness and solitude the cold tears and claws
Ripping at the force of life - ripping it apart
A dark and tortured universe â dominion of no laws
The cycleÂ´s now complete - take us back to the start
