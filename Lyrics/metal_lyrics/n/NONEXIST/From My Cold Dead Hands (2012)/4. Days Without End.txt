IÂ´m down but not out
My back against the ropes
Energy and sanity is draining from me
Patience backfires into punishment
Punishing the soul â suffocating
Crying out â gasping for air

Struggling forward in a race with no end
No rest in sight though the darkness descends
IÂ´ve become a machine within a system of pain
No escape, no way out - IÂ´m a slave

ThereÂ´s no humanity
Just ruthless conformity
Increasing complexity

Living dead in these days that never end
Walking through the flames to transcend
Clenching my fist
Upon survival insist
Days without end
No mercy given
As the madness descends

Stand in line to get fucked in the head
Severe exhaustion - hanging on by a thread
Time is never on my side anyway
No need to worry - I can sleep in the grave

Trials and tribulation
Work ethic humiliation
Feudal structure confirmation

Living dead in these days that never end
Walking through the flames to transcend
Clenching my fist
Upon survival insist
Days without end
No mercy given
As the madness descends

Day after day fly before my eyes
All merge into a black grain
Arrested freedom of the inner child
Slave within a system of pain
