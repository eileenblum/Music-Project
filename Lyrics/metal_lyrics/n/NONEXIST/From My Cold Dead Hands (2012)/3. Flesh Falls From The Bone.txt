If there was a bottom I wouldnÂ´t hit it
Feeling of bone only amplifies the search for flesh
Falling endlessly as in a dream
Far beyond the obscene
Mirror oh mirror - your lie enslaves me
Complicates me
Vindicates me
Eradicates me
Penetrates me
Makes me lose my fucking self

All must go
None to spare
I will persevere
There is no end

Flesh falls from the bone
Amorphous being
Drawing blood from stone
This illusion of control
Flesh falls from the bone
Sick twisted creature
This is no way to live
It is a way to die

If there was a limit I would push it
Worshipping death to compensate lack of life
Mind is hollow in an empty shell
Cast under my own spell
Salvation through starvation
Glorification of degeneration
Morbid fascination with transformation
Slowmotion suicide

Haze of binge
Obsessive trance
Compulsive anarchy
Reign the kingdom of my mind

Flesh falls from the bone
Amorphous being
Drawing blood from stone
This illusion of control
Flesh falls from the bone
Sick twisted creature
This is no way to live
It is a way to die

Turn the inside to outside
Materialise the angst within
Slowmotion suicide
Too late once the heart gives in

No one must ever know
Just me and the blackened angels
My splintered shadow-self
My private demonology
Lead me down into the abyss

If there was a bottom I wouldnÂ´t hit it
If there was a limit I would push it
If there was a bottom I wouldnÂ´t see it
If there was a limit I would crush it

Binge and purge
Catharsis
I will persevere
There is no end

Flesh falls from the bone
Amorphous being
Drawing blood from stone
This illusion of control
Flesh falls from the bone
Sick twisted creature
This is no way to live
It is a way to die

All must disappear
Transparent invisible
Flesh-less ghost ideal
Slowmotion suicide
