These battles that we choose
When for ages weâve been abused
Through centuries and decades
Imprisoned in our own rage
No more agony in here
The last outpost for you and me
Stronger and stronger
We march silently onward

IÂ´m stuck in this void
Trapped in this forsaken maelstrom
How were we to know
The limits of temptation
Yearning for your touch
I can never get enough
Broken hearts of glass so fragile
The tidal waves of love

In the shadow of death
We try to endure
Living in the ruins
Of what we once knew
Reaching out
To you â one more time
Fatigued I drown
In your presence everlastingâ¦

I hunt in the dead of night alone
Seeking further pleasures
With a darkened mind, a heart of stone
Aim to decrease this pressure
What once was lost, now re-possessed
Now forever part of me
Like vultures in the sky
Preying on those who bleed

In the shadow of death
We try to endure
Living in the ruins
Of what we once knew
Reaching out
To you â one more time
Fatigued I drown
In your presence everlastingâ¦

A raven on my shoulder
Walk into an open grave
My spirit is getting colder
My soul a black hidden cave

Burning from within
Engulfed
In my own despair
Drowning

Dark twin on my shoulder
Crawl into a sombre womb
My spirit is growing older
My mind is bound to be my tomb

Burning from within
Engulfed
In my own despair
Drowning...drowning!
In your presence everlasting
