Violent by nature â a life built on hate
Bastard son conceived through rape
They let you feel it â time and time again
You let them taste it â a fist all iron-clad
When they pushed you â thatÂ´s all you had
Snowball kept rolling â your life got fucked up out of hand

Here comes the pain â Brace yourself, no way out this time
Here comes the pain â KarmaÂ´s here, time to burn - die or live and learn
Here comes the pain â your numberÂ´s up â nowhere to run
Here comes the pain

Intoxication fuels the fire-head
Poison liquid, powder and pills till all is said
Violence is all you understand
WhoÂ´ll be next victim â the next within your sights
A provocation and youÂ´ll crush with all your might
A suicide pointed outwards
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets

Here comes the pain â Brace yourself, no way out this time
Here comes the pain â KarmaÂ´s here, time to burn - die or live and learn
Here comes the pain â your numberÂ´s up â nowhere to run
Here comes the pain

You donÂ´t know what hate can make a man do
You donÂ´t know the pain inside
It will burst like a nuke right in your face
This fucking world made out of shit
No reason thatÂ´s just the way it is
Pungent rotten hatred

Here comes the pain â Brace yourself, no way out this time
Here comes the pain â KarmaÂ´s here, time to burn -die or live and learn
Here comes the pain â your numberÂ´s up â nowhere to run
Here comes the pain
