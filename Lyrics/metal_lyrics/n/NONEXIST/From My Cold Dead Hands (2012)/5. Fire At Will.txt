With or against, no middleground - God on our side
Preemptive attack â need no reasons why
Cowboys with nukes, bulletproof - the media drools
Prime time debauchery
ThereÂ´s no avoiding war
This is homeland security
ThereÂ´s no avoiding war
It can only be postponed
To the advantage of others

A well-oiled machinery
Waging war is an industry
Keep spinning the economy
To reach Manifest Destiny
No noble cause in sight
Though winning the Noble Peace Prize might
Validate the reason to dominate
Geared by gain - beyond the insane

Fire at will
It has begun
Now kingdoms come undone
Fire at will
Overlords of violence
Raping all innocence

Marching onward into the black â no turning back
Politics of hysteria realized by -
False-flag deceptions
ThereÂ´s no avoiding war
Sickening inbred corruption
ThereÂ´s no avoiding war
Only a matter of time
And time is money

War-gods of air, land and sea
Genocide for democracy
Massmedial duplicity
Theatre of grotesquery
No noble cause in sight
Just madmen power-drunk with lies
Vindicate your treason
Geared by gain - destroy the humane

Fire at will
It has begun
Now kingdoms come undone
Fire at will
Overlords of violence
Raping all innocence
