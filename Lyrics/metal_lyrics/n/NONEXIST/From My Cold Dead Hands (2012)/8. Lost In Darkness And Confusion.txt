âWhen you stare into the abyss â
The abyss stares into youâ
Reeling at the edge
IÂ´m a stranger to myself
Lost beyond space and time
A sinster illusion feeding itself
Within the mist of a tortured soul
An imploding spirit is gasping for air
As fear breeds fear of insane entrapment
Entrapment within total nothingness

Panic
Silent panic
Falling
Endless falling
Panic
Silent panic
Falling
Endless falling
Panic
Silent panic
Falling
Endless falling
Panic
Silent panic
Falling
Endless falling

Wandering aimless through a ghastly void
On fields of desolation
Running blind in a maze of the mind
Lost in darkness and confusion

Shut out!
A storm of fear inside my skull
Shut down!
The system can not cope anymore
Scream forth!
Silent roar
Cry out in despair
But those bitter tears wonÂ´t help me now

Jaws of realtiy are closing in
My mind escapes me
Ontological crisis
âI think â therefore I amâ
- What a hoax, such a scam
Just a dream within a dream
within a dream...

Enter the nonexist
A black emptiness
Sickness of the weary soul
Crushed existence
Vanished into thin air

Shut out!
A storm of fear inside my skull
Shut down!
The system can not cope anymore
Scream forth!
Silent roar
Cry out in despair
But those bitter tears wonÂ´t help me now

Alive but walking dead
Regarding life as though beyond the tomb
Lost in darkness and confusion
Betrayed by an insane illusion

Shut out!
A storm of fear inside my skull
Shut down!
The system can not cope anymore
Scream forth!
Silent roar
Cry out in despair
But those bitter tears wonÂ´t help me now
