So resounding those promises broken
They still echo through this my darkened realm
Countless the days now since past
Still lingering and long, the shadows theyâve cast
On me!

These are blood soaked lands
With memories...

Shadows and Snow
From these fierce whipping winds
We are all hardened and shaped
Shadows and snow From which weâre carved and born
Origin and our bourn

Resounding those promises shattered
They still echo through this my darkened realm

These are blood soaked hands
With memories!

Shadows and Snow
From these fierce whipping winds
We are all hardened and shaped
Shadows and snow
From which weâre carved and born
Origin and our bourn
Origin and our bourn

And we can see!

I have walked the endless path, to meet myself
I have walked the endless darkness, to set your echoes free
I have heard the hymn of the world, it lacks words and melody
In the shadows and frost I found them, which ones they used to be
Used to be!

These are blood soak lands
With memories!

Shadows and Snow
From these fierce whipping winds
We are all hardened and shaped
Shadows and snow
From which we are carved and born
Origin and our bourn

Origin and our bourn!
