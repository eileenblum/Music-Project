As the sword of midnight
Splits the shield of daylight
And twilight gushes forth from ancient wounds cut so deep...

It might seem forever
It might seem eternal
But believe me it just ain't so...

All and everything, will be nothing, only darkness, and cold

The scorching rays of daytime
The guilt laid in plain sight
Every belief will be so proven false, as the universe is no more

The cycle will end, darkness eternal
Darkness and cold they shall prevail
It shall quench the hurt, the guilt and all sins
It will forgive us

The cycle will end, cold is eternal
Darkness and cold they will remain
It shall slake the moon, the stars and the sun
And in the end forgive us
For what weâve become

As the sword of midnight
Splits the shield of daylight
And twilight gushes forth from ancient wounds
Upon eternity...

Whatever the roots of your sins
One day they will all be absolved
By darkness eternal absorbed

Every progress will be proven useless
Every god will be just as dead as you and me

The cycle will end, darkness eternal
Darkness and cold they shall prevail
It shall quench the hurt, the guilt and all sins
It will forgive us

The cycle will end, cold is eternal
Darkness and cold they will remain
It shall slake the moon, the stars and the sun
And in the end forgive us
For what weâve become
