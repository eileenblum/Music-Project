Ve dig ynkedom!

Esse non videri
In the realm of falsehood you are a king
Your mirror reflects a god
Yet I see no one, no one at all
Be gone!

I can see no one at all!

You are never gonna be the one
You are forged in the wrong flames
Your feeble curses go unheard
Iâm a non believer
We shall cast you down the pit
Your high throne will collapse
Your fragile angels will behead themselves
Out of regret and disgust

Esse non videri
An ode to a king without a court
A god without a creed
A church without belief

You are never gonna be the one
Youâre a castle built on sand
Your dogma rings so sad and hollow
Iâm a non-believer
We shall to watch you fall
Weâll live to outlast you
Your legions will abandon you
Out of regret and disgust

A transparent empty shell
Devoid of passions blood
My ode to you the false
Is all I will bestow
My last poisonous offering
To whom betrayed us all
A last boon to which you might cling
As we make you fall, down

The scarred will slowly drain you into dust
You stare at me but I see right through you

Be gone

Esse non videri
In the realm of falsehood you are a king
Your mirror reflects a god
Yet I see no one, no one at all, be gone

You are never gonna be the one
You are forged in the wrong flames
Your feeble curses go unheard
Iâm a non believer

We shall cast you down the pit
Your high throne will collapse
Your fragile angels will behead themselves
Out of regret and disgust
