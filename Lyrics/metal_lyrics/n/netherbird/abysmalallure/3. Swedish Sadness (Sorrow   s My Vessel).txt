Oh, on this sea of mercury pale
Only the sky, is of less luster
Where waves are ripped and thrown
Only my heart is more restless and torn

Sorrowâs my vessel
Sails woven of torn dreams
Hurt is my wind
My charts made of apathy
Sorrowâs my vessel
I set sail for the sea
Guided by disbelief
not to arrive but to leave

I miss the person that you made me be
I miss the beauty that you made me see
I miss the king you made out of me
And I miss the wonders you made me believe

Oh sorrowâs my vessel
sails woven of torn dreams
Hurt is my wind
My charts made of apathy
Sorrowâs my vessel
I set sail for the sea
Guided by disbelief
not to arrive but to leave
