[Lyrics Nephente]

This night is dark, black as hell itself
This is the wolf hour, a sea ready to devouver
Standing at the Shore, looking out
Standing by the sea, forever looking for thee

I have been standing by the sea, built to stand for forever
As walls of water crash, I am stone, I will last

Radiant my fiery eye, cutting through the night
A solemn last promise, a barren unyielding light

I might be the last light you see
The first not to abandon thee

Lighthouse Eternal, Laterna Magika

No matter where you hoped to go
No matter where you have been
No matter what you hoped to find
No matter what you have seen
No matter what you hoped to achieve
No matter what you have become
No matter what you hoped to do
No matter what you have done

I will always find you
not let a single soul go astray

I will bring you home again
Not one single soul will be left behind

These winds once carried me too
Back when I was so like you
I left port in search for other shores
I dared these waves when all else had failed

Now I stand blacker than the night
At a shore where no one should go
My light will never falter, never fade
When all else is lost, I remain

Lighthouse Eternal, Laterna Magika

No matter where you hoped to go
No matter where you have been
No matter what you hoped to find
No matter what you have seen
No matter what you hoped to achieve
No matter what you have become
No matter what you hoped to do
No matter what you have done

At the edge of this world of darkness
This is the last port before it all ends
For the stray ships cast the furtherst south of Eden

No matter your flaws you are welcome here,
No matter your sins or past my dear
You are welcome home sweet fallen one

I will bring you home again
Lighthouse Eternal, lanterna magika
