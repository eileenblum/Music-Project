[Lyrics Nephente]

Death like, pale
graceful ballet
In silence drawing near
For a second mere

Forlorn silhouettes
For an instant there
Only to disappear,
forever changing all
and the few that see, and still believe
Sweet, painful, fragile
Dreams...

A haven of chaos
So scarred and so alone
Walking dead
Lost in streets unknown

We were once the invisible ones
Those that spoke and no one heard
Ghosts dancing in silver lit nights
And never to return to this world
Ivory and dye,
Delicate porcelain
calm these faÃ§ades
Lost in rain relentless

The brilliant and shining few
Who once drowned amongst the grey
Spite the pain and whipping rain
Chose to walk these lesser travelled ways
Away!

Walking down this road
Many its winding turns
A barren scar of stone
Though all that stings and hurts

Walk on to new rivers
The ones of old ran dry
Their barren depths unveiled
Crystal streams fell prey to the hands of time

Days and nights go by, one by one
Like water slipping through tired fingers
Precious gems stolen from idle hands
Small pieces of the sun,
now lost

Adrift in eternal darkness
Breathing in the gloom
Walking darkened gardens
Where only shadows bloom

Oh this world looks so different now
a little more dies with every passing day
Every minute steals a colour
flawing beauty in all ways

Memories start to dither, One by one
Dreams fall to splinters, One by one

Seems like I am dying
No air for these lungs
It feels like I am dying
So far from home

Beneath the celestial canopy
Angel wings and demon seeds
Beneath the celestial canopy
The legions march with me

We walk the boulevard black
Across these fields of grey
Like ghost adrift in gloom
In search for other ways
A place where we belong
We walk down boulevard black
An endless row of souls
And we are marching home

We walk down Boulevard so black
An endless stream of time,
this finite march called life
We walk down Boulevard so black
this everflow into the unknown
back to where we came from

Praised be those of silence
The blood tainted ivory innocence
Praised be those that differ
Blessed be the children of the fall
Those that walk the boulevard black
The legions of the left hand avenue

An ode to the fallen
An ode to for the lost
An ode to the stranded
To those that still burn

All of the chains are splintered
Those that woke are walking, fairlight
All of my dreams are dead now
All golden lies are lead now
All of my angels have fallen
We walk this earth like ghosts
All of my angels are fallen
All of my angels are beautiful

Sing to me oh you sweet bleeding planet
Sing to us that walk your ruins
Sing to us for our words are dead
Sing to us for their world is dead to us

An ode for the thinning breed of angels
For their crimson lips and tangled feathers
Majestic wings are spread climbing the sun
One for the reason in reasoning no more

Walking down this road
Many its winding turns
A barren scar of stone
Though all that stings and hurts
And we are like fire flies,
Boldly daring the night
And we dance for a radiant while
Born to drift out of time...
But for a second mere we glared
For an instant we were there
Before the last grain of sand fell
No tears as I bid thee fare well...

We walk down Boulevard so black
an endless stream of time,
this fi nite march called life
We walk down Boulevard so black
this everflow into the unknown,
back to where we came from

We walk down boulevard black
Across these fields of grey
Like ghost adrift in gloom
In search for other ways
A place where we belong
We walk the boulevard black
An endless row of souls
And we are marching home

We are like fire flies
Boldly daring the night
And we dance for a radiant while
Born to drift out of time...

But for a second mere we glared
For a shining instant we were there
Before the last grain of sand fell
No tears as I bid thee fare well...

At the end of a black boulevard.
