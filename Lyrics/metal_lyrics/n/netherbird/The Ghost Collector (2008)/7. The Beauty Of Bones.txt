[Lyrics: Nephente]

We are the ostracized
The fucking apostatized
Scorning the dogmatised
Black puke globalized

We are the demonized
The lost cursed and stigmatized
The black fucking tantalized
This healthy world's parasites

As the havoc ceases
And our bodies drained
Past the last heart beat
Then we are akin again

The beauty of bones
They rest hidden below
All our flaws are set aside
Weâre all alike the instant that we die

The beauty of bones
As the chains of flesh let go
When naked bones remain
And only then will we ever be the same again

We never wished for this to be
Never asked to differ, we just do
But in truth we are quite like thee
We leave as bones and so will you

Behold the malprogrammed drones
Your failed and now useless clones
Rejoice now 'cause beneath it all
We are but bones

When the flesh has failed
Mere bones remain
Then we will be so alike
Then weâll be the same

The beauty of bones
They rest hidden below
All our flaws are set are aside
Weâre all alike the instant that we die

The beauty of bones
As the chains of flesh let go
When naked bones remain
And only then will we be the same again

We are the ostracized
The fucking apostatized
Scorning the dogmatised
Black puke globalized

We are the demonized
The lost cursed and stigmatized
The black fucking tantalized
This healthy world's parasites
