[Lyrics Nephente]

Forever darkness
forever rain
Forever mournful
I will remain

Forever darkness
Forever falling rain
Forever mournful
I stand alone and so I will remain

The world is changing
Nothing stays the same
Forever eroding
Only I seem to remain
I stand still, dead and cold
A stone statute, so black, and alone

Time cuts wound that never heal
Forgot how it was like to feel
What it was like to believe
How life used to be
I turned dark
I grew cold
I turned to stone

I seen so many souls come
And I have seen them all go
I have seen many gods rise
And I will see them all fall
All hope promised
A sadfated lost chance
All seem dead to me
All i see, Ghost dance

The world is changing
Nothing stays the same
Forever eroding
Only I seem to remain
I stand still, dead and cold
A stone statute, so black, and alone

I stand still and I stand cold
I stand everdark and I am stone
This soul is frozen, these limbs are worn
This heart is to tired, this soul is so torn

I am mournful in this void of laughter
I am stone in this realm of flesh
All I see around me is a Ghost dance
Frozen in a world that slowly changes
Destroying all I ever needed to believe
Forever mournful as time passes

Let the Nordic thunder Roar

Time cuts wound that never heal
forgot how it was like to feel
What it was like to believe
How life used to be
I turned dark
I grew cold
I turned to stone
