[Lyrics Nephente]

At dusk they will awake
A ghost dance ball room
As the sun is slaked

At dusk they spring to life
And their damp grey concrete hive
Bathing in fluorescent light

Temples with worms
Praying they'll be butterflies
To be able to move like the wind
If only for a while

In the glistering halls dead bodies swing to the melody
Crystal mirror walls, reflecting the carcass symphony
In the lost souls ball room where dead tissue breathe
Dead they all seem, dead they all are, dead to me
I see broken dolls, their venomous smiles cover grief

In the glistering halls dead you are invisible
They never see anyone, they stare right through
Among the crystal pillars the insects play make-believe
I see broken dolls, their venomous smiles cover grief

Crystal mirrors reflecting unseeing eyes
Crimson lipped mouths spitting their lies
They are all lost, they are all hollow
They are empty inside

Stay away from them
Ignore their siren songs
These genderless whores
Pass by their temples, forever walk on

In the glistering halls clod flesh swing,
A ghost dance for the false
Cystal mirror walls, entangled in lies
On and on the waltz on

We the sulphur kissed
The ones to walk the path twilit
Among the living and torn
Among the alive and battle worn

The sweet promise of grandeur
In defiance of and end that must come
In the ghost dance ball room
Where the soothing lies are sung

I am rather the sulphur kissed
The one to walk the path twilit
Among the living and torn
Among the alive and the battle worn

We are the proudly flawed
The last children of the fall
We are the sulphur kissed
We walk the path twilit
We are the proudly flawed
The last children of the fall
We are the sulphur kissed
We walk the path of twilight
