To some this is an abyss
To others a barren shore
For all a place of no return
Where no path lead onwards
When words fall short
So weak, so frail and futile
And the soul is covered by frost
Standing at the crossroads of the lost

Rapid these waters
Such promising alure
A final release
From what cannot be endured
Such a ghastly glow
Bestowed upon the one that let go

Welcoming hands
The riverâs cold embrace
A cleansing numbness
My âIâ is ereased
Such an eerie flow
Thoughts cease, pulled down below
Towards release

At the bottom of the crystal artery
At the bottom of an end

Under the weight of all failures
Towards the bottom of the crystal artery
So slow the descent to a dark end
So slow the descent to the unescapbale end
At the bottom of the crystal artery

The only escape from the limbo
Is down into the alluring depths
Only by reaching the bottom
Where rock and feet can meet
Only then can escape be reached
One push up and ahead
One kick to break free from the dead
The darkness never looked brighter

Rapid these waters
Such promising alure
A final release
From what cannot be endured
Such a ghastly glow
Bestowd upon the one that let go

Welcoming hands
The riverâs cold embrace
A cleansing numbness
My âIâ is ereased
Such an eerie flow
Thoughts cease, pulled down below
Towards release

At the bottom of the crystal artery
At the bottom of an end
Under the weight of all failures
Towards the bottom of the crystal artery
So slow the descent to a dark end
So slow the descent to the unescapable end
At the bottom of the crystal artery

I push free
