[Bonus Track]Clutching her legs in the pained caress
Tears cried for everything
Fall unseen

But you were never quite alone...

Dry your red cried eyes
Stay another while
Please...

Born from in shadows
Fuelled by their disdain
Solitude triumphant
The ones that wouldn't change

Into the fire
Into the world alit
We bring desire
The unspoken truth of slit wrists 

Across the chasm
 From unseen to majesty
Across the chasm 
From ideals to atrocity

In truth you are
Perfection to envy gods
So undivine by choice
Sweet salty skin
With eyes of midnight skies
So frail her muted voice
So beautiful
To me

Rising from the shadows
Creatures so depraved
For aeons we hungered 
We are the children of cain
So you were never alone!

Born in shadows
Fuelled by their disdain
Solitude triumphant
The ones that wouldn't change

Across the chasm
From unseen to majesty
Across the chasm 
From ideals to atrocity

To me you are
Perfection to envy gods
So undivine by choice
Sweet angel kin 
With eyes of midnight skies
So frail her muted voice
So divine

Dry your red cried eyes
Stay another while please...

Now let me just ask you
Did you ever feel out of place and always so alone
That they were right and that you always seemed to be so wrong
My dear
So did I
I just wonder
Well now who gave them all the rights when you seemed to have none
You are a precious soul in our twisted storm standing millions strong
KÃ¤ra du
I hope their gods will forgive them

We're invoking the bliss of oblivion
The communion of lost souls
Sweet and sinful
Across the chasm of morals 
Sweet and sinful
Away from their norms and strains 
Into the sinful domain

Oh yes you are
Perfection to envy gods
So undivine by choice
Oh precious bird
With eyes of midnight skies
So frail your muted voice
So divine
