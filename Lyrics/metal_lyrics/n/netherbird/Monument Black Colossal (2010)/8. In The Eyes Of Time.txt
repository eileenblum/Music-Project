[Bonus Track]Have you seen the fire in my eyes
Did you think it'd fade?
Have you felt the same inside
Did you ever think it would go away?

Behold the shadow world awake
Burning eye brought to defeat
Naked beneath the stars we are whole
Night silver makes us complete

As the strangle grip of another day yields
Darkness repaints these barren old fields
Where so many has stood before me
Watching the same star painted shield

Darkness embrace me
Night set this tired pale soul free
Darkness forgive me
Erase me 

As the silver stars they hit me
This lunar spell completes me
In the cold distance now I see
Sweet eternity

In the eyes of time we are forgiven
In the eyes of time we are forgiven
In the eyes of time we are forgiven
In the eyes of time we are innocent

I'm a sulphur child infernal
No universe can host me
Lo and behold the liar
Lo and behold the fallen one
So many years spent in limbo
Eternity, a child compared to me

In the eyes of time we are forgiven
In the eyes of time we are innocent

As the strangle grip of another day yields
Darkness repaints these barren old fields
Where so many has stood before me
Watching the same star painted shield

Darkness embrace me
Night set this tired pale soul free
Darkness forgive me
Erase me 

As the silver stars they hit me
This lunar spell completes me
In the cold distance now I see
Sweet eternity

Eternity...

Eternity
