In growing numbers
They head into the night
Familiar silhouettes
Of beloved ones drifting by

With every passing shadow
I wish I was wrong
About where they are going
And what they will find out there

A thousand throats
Screaming in silence
Slit speechless by her descent
The echo of heavens crashing
The massive thunder of falling feathers

One who does not curse death has not truely loved

If I had gods
this would be when I would have prayed to them
If I had gods
This would be when I would raced up to face them
Iâd cut out their eyes
Just as these tears made me fumbling blind
Iâd tear out their hearts
Just as they robbed me of mine and Iâd cast them down to die

I wish I was wrong
About why they left
I wish that I could believe
That there would in fact be
Someone to meet them
Someont to bring them all home

A thousand throats
Screaming in silence
Slit speechless by her descent
The echo of heavens crashing
The massive thunder of falling feathers
He who does not denounce his gods has not learnt the meaning of loss

I have cursed death
And I have known love
Iâve slain my gods
Only emptiness above
Light like vapour I was drifting next to thee
Massive the weight as I took my leave

I have cursed death
And I have known love
Iâve slain my gods
Only emptiness above
Light like vapour you were drifting next to me
Massive the weight as you took your leave
