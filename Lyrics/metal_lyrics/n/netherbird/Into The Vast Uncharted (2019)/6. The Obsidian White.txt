So phantomless the oceans
The ferocious force of tide
Tremors from the deep
A giant's breath

Into chaos this existence
From the soaring mountain heights
With trembling hearts we fall into the deep Neptunian graves

Now the eastern sky is restless
Our death a naked sword dividing seas

The obsidian white
The obsidian white
The obsidian white
The endless well of onixian light

Oh, in dancing sparks of fire
An echo from the burning vivid past
A silver thread into the vast uncharted
Our hunger will forever be untamed, so our hearts

The fate bestowed upon us so much bleaker
Our fear to feed perpetual flames burn our eyes
Burn our eyes

Forever is this boulevard we wander
The obsidian white
The obsidian white
The obsidian white
The endless well of onixian light
The obsidian white
