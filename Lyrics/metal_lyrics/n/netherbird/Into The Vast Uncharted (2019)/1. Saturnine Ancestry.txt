The most vivid thoughts are woven
In solitude divine
The most haunting knells are
Rung for empty halls

From oblivion all rises
Into entropy of life
Drawn upon the surface of the winds
Shattered from the sky

On blades of rusted iron
Upon trees and upon stone
Blood have washed of beast and that of man
On altars carved of bones

The crimson everflow

All rivers carry slowly
Our reflections of the past
Memories heavier than gold
Shadowing our path

In darkness she arrives

And the void will last forever
Come swallow all the light

With a hunger never-ending
Spanning sea and sky
I am not of this world
And this world was never mine

I ascent into unlight

In darkness she arrives

And her void will last forever
Come swallow all the light

With a hunger never-ending
Spanning sea and sky
I am not of this world
And this world was never mine

I ascent into unlight

In darkness she arrives

And her void will last forever
Come swallow all the light

Her void will last forever
Come swallow all the light
