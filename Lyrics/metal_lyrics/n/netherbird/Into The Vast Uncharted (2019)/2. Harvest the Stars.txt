When silver eyes open
On the shield of the sky
As it arches across the worlds

Faintly glowing
Tracing the age of a time
That died before it arrived

This tattered flesh is a gift
For a darkness we all reside
Our splintering bones a tribute
To the null, the eternal night

Oh, I harvest the star
I consume, I negate
Oh, for I am the light erased
An echo that never defades

For in darkness we all preside
We're the null, the eternal night
