Now the lake are still
And this night is forever dark
This lands been nourished
By those who bled away

The silver strings trace back into the past
The winds foretell the saga of the pending end
And chaos commence

Under mercury skies
The calm before the raging storm
Black form, black clouds
The dawn of the great deluge
Under mercury skies i can face my final night
Alone

Split this world with lightning
Come fire, come hail
Make mountains crumble
Underneath your wings

The screaming howl of thunder
Aeons to bend
How it all begins and how it will end
The rise of age of man
Her twilight will descend

And the graceless hammers of time
The radiance before the storm unleashed
As we spectate our own departure
Behold the burning sails of faith

In the lightless night of forever
The oxinian dawn

Witnessing the dawn

When memories have faded into dust
And still our destination is unknown
I have witnessed the shifting of the tide
I was destined to venture on alone
Alone

My fear died with hope
This path is unknown
Like dust from a star
I settled a lifetime ago

The never ending road

Split this world with lightning
Come fire, come hail
Make mountains crumble
Underneath your wings

The screaming howl of thunder
Aeons to bend
How it all begins and how it will end
The rise of age of man
Oh, her twilight will descend

Under mercury skies
The calm before the raging storm
Black form, black clouds
The dawn of the great deluge

Under mercury skies
The radiance before the fall
Black form, black clouds
I face my final nigh
