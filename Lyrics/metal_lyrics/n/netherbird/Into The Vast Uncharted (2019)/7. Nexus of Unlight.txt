Through the gardens of the night
To the Nexus of unlight
The origo of the dark void
Across the plains we ride

Stars falter one by one
Moon-silver eerie cold
Like ghosts the dancing shadows
Desolation now the road

Where the elders cast their shadows ever tall
And the silence is their solemn livid psalm
As all threads of past redemptions be reforged

Their hearts relentless hammers
On the anvils of the world
This rare untainted bloodline
The gift of knowledge keeps the light unheard

As our meagre castles fall
The hunger will return to all once lost
Through the gardens of the night
To the nexus unlight

We rode across the plains of shattered dreams
For all the godless and believers
Moon-silver eerie cold
To roam the great beyond to the end of days
End of days

Where the elders cast their shadows ever tall
And the silence is their solemn livid psalm
As all threads of past redemptions be reforged
