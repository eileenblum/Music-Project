Tear the fabric of the night
As crimson fingers sear
Come chime the bells from every earthly belfry
For this dynasty of dreams
With splendour built upon the restless waves
The waves

Our treachery of thought
The heresy of will and aspiration

And know, the truth is cried
From unsung graves and gallows alike
This pinnacle of highs and lows
The pendulum will swing
The shifting tide

From serfs to the elite
All that grows and all that withers
Send your vanguards into my night
Blow your horns of Eden
My storm will sweep all specks of light away

And know, the truth is cried
From unsung graves and gallows alike
This pinnacle of highs and lows
The pendulum will freeze
And oceans rise

The lunar strain of time
