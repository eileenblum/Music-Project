The Evangel of the dark
When silence lingers dead
For a blissful fleeting moment I am alive
Beneath the arching dome
The flicker of a light
All dreams asleep

At zenith face your abyss
On the summit of it all
Endless is the view
Endless the fall
All that you hold precious
Comes dead by break of Dawn
All of your belief will seep to dust
Scattered for the wind

At the shores of unexistence
Where nothing lives and nothing dies
Every path has lead me to this bridge
Her scene is ever-changing
Yet I recall each scent, every sound

Wolves shall roam this garden
By the power of her zeal
The fall is steep for those who venture here
I hear their cries like thunder
Howling in the wind
Echoing along the silver lines
The past into the now
Beyond the fields of time

At zenith face your abyss
On the summit of it all
Endless is the view
Endless the fall
All that you hold precious
Comes dead by break of Dawn
All of your belief will seep to dust
Scattered for the wind
Beyond the fields of time
The evangel of the dark
