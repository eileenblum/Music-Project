[originally by The Soundtrack Of Our Lives]They're gonna build a brand new planet
They're gonna leave for another world
They're gonna build a brand new planet
And leave us all here on our own
Just like they did before

They're gonna build a new dimension
And make a soundtrack of our lives
They're gonna build a new dimension
And drill a hole of the imaginary time

They say we're part of an alien nation
Better run for the human race
They say we're part of an alien nation
Belive it when they say that we gotta get out of this place...

They're gonna build a brand new planet
They're gonna make it on the other side
Maybe some day you will find it, if you think it worth all of your strife

Moutains made of over-indulgence
And a sea made if heroin
They're gonna build a brand new planet and leave us all here on our own
Just like they did before...
