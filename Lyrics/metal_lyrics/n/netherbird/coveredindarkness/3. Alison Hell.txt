[originally by Annihilator]["a young girl, terrified, there's something out there. but is it real? it must be, because it's watching her. her pleas for comfort and reassurance are ignored, and soon, all she has left is her imagination... and that's the most terrifying thing of all."]

alice isn't it frightening
alice aren't you scared
alice isn't it wonderful
living life afraid
don't look around the corner
i might be lurking there
under the bed at night
you're up till dawn again

alison hell, your mind begins to fold
alison hell, aren't you growing cold
alison hell, you are looking blue
alice in hell, what else can you do

i begin my rule, life hideous in your mind
crying out, you've lost your doll
it isn't worth a dime

alison hell, your mind begins to fold
alison hell, aren't you growing cold
alison hell, what are you looking for
alice in hell, soon i close the door

sitting in the corner, you are naked and alone
no one listened to your fears, you've created me

alice isn't it frightening
alice aren't you scared
i was killed at birth
i shoot this final scene
you're in the basement
you're trapped insanity

alison hell, what were you looking for
alison hell, as i close the door
alison hell, here you shall dwell
alison hell, alice dwells in hell

alice
alison
alice
in hell

goodbye
