Deep breaths of forever
Sweet scent of emerald ripe
Whispers, islands in silence
In silvan arms we come back to life

We wished for this darkness
We wished for the night to go on (forever)
To cover the scars
Shadows have all hurt undone

I know I'll find a way
And I know I'll find a way (home)

Cold the raging winds are weeping
Down ruins of victories past
So slow the river of life
Of triumphs all memories so vague

I wish for the wisdom
I wish I could finally see (afar)
Beyond all horizons
And all that's been hidden from me

I know I'll find a way
And I know I'll find a way (home)
We will find a way
And we will find a way
Awayâ¦

With ardor and resolve
We delve into the vast unknown
Onwards into the night
We keep our blazing fires high

The proudly few departed
Journeymen in realms uncharted
Onwards into the night
Resilient we rose from the silvan shrine

And we march home
