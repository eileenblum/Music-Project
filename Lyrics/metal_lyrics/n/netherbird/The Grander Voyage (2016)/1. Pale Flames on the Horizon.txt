Gaze into the darkness
From this shadowy abode
A flame far out in the void
A glimpse of the beyond
Like an old awakening sentience

Some fragment of eternity
Altering all perspectives of the world known
An elusive meaning
Deeper than everything you had once believed in

From a tired slumber
something inside awoke
As pale flames dance high,
Leading you onwards
To find the hidden origins
On the brim of the sky

By thunder awake
Let lightning lead
To the highest peak,
Into the deepest precipices
I am the rising tide
The approaching storm
The avalanche
I am the voyage grand
