Your past now stands aflame
Grey ruins line your empty roads
Barren dusty soils
The dead now claim these lands

I come with the setting sun
One of hope come undone
I am the one of shadows domain
Time pass yet I remain

I am near as life stands ablaze
The ashes you claim to be memories
Dust of what used to be
A vision only you can seek

Iâm the dark in your lingering thought
The storm that will sweep your dreams away
Iâm the one that will make you see
I am the loss, I am the key

I am eternal
I am close
Iâm infernal
I am all ghosts
Of all choices wrongly made
Of all hurt ever inflicted

The loss

I shall open your eyes

I am the heart of all smitten lovers
A creature of all pain they felt
A shadow of all those betrayed
The ghastly beast, your past

One of hope come undone
Time pass yet I remain
I am near as life stands ablaze
The ashes you claim to be memories
Dust of what used to be
A vision only you can seek

Iâm the dark in your lingering thought
The storm that will sweep your dreams away
Iâm the one that will make you see
I am the loss, I am the key
I am the rider of the setting sun
The past
