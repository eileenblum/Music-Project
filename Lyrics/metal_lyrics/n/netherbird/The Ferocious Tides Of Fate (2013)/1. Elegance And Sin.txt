Heed the burning beckoning call
Sever those disgustful lies that bind
Come let your craving guide you to your kind
Let rapture and depravity lift you high
Into sin!

Feel the song of whips
The cold chains of liberty
Freedom on your knees
Perversion they could not believe

Be all that you have dreamt of
Beneath the sign of the rose
Yield to me delightful
Embrace the endless dark

I am chains
You are lace
We are skin
Gods of the radiant kind

I am pain
I am comfort
Iâm ecstasy
Sworn to the silence we are complete

Let dark temptation guide you to our kind
Let hunger and your bravery lift you high
Perfectly flawed!

In this our luxoria
Elegance and wickedness
The sting and flesh
Pure artistry
All our flaws shine perfectly

Beyond the pale mundane
The oath of silence keep your secret safe
As you kneel delighted
To us the proud benighted few

I am chains
You are lace
And we are skin
Gods of the radiant kind 

I am pain
I am comfort
Iâm ecstasy 
Sworn to the silence we are complete 

The devastation
Of innocence and lies
The annihilation
Of borders and fear 

Sweet salvation
Mortals made gods
Pure perversion
We rise as one
In flames

Sworn to silence celebrating trust
Worshipping our lust
Be all that youâve dreamt of
Beneath the sign of the rose
Yield to me delightful
embrace the endless dark

I am chains
You are lace
And we are skin
Gods of the radiant kind

I am pain
I am comfort
Iâm ecstasy
Sworn to silence we are complete
