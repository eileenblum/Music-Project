Be it storm or scorching sun 
Be it rain or snow
I stand tall

Be it peace or raging wars 
Be it drought or flood
I stand tall 
I am the world

Iâm the eternal

Fraxinus Excelsior
I tower unbreakable 
Fraxinus Excelsior
I stand fast unshakable

My roots burrow deep
I stood when time began 
I reach the realm of men
I stand forever past the end 
I reach the abode of gods
I am the sky and land 
I touch the condemned
I obliterate and I amend

Without me nothing
I am the beginning and end 
Without me nothing
I am the answer to any question

Fraxinus Excelsior
I hold the sky and the stars 
Fraxinus Excelsior
I am the blood soaked earth

My roots burrow deep
I stood when time began 
I reach the realm of men
I stand forever past the end 
I reach the abode of gods
I am the sky and land 
I touch the condemned
I obliterate and I amend

Mortal oaths have been sworn in my shade
And none would last...
Honour sold for gold
kinsmenâ trust traded for glory and a song...

I do mourn
But never cry 
Unbreakable

Without me nothing
I am the beginning and end 
Without me nothing
I am the answer to any question 

My roots burrow deep
I stood when time began 
I reach the realm of men
I stand forever past the end 
I reach the abode of gods
I am the sky and land 
I touch the condemned
I obliterate and I amend
