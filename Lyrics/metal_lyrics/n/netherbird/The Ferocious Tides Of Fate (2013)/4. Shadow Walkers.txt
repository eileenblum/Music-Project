As autumn comes
Cold is her breath
Of fire her colours
Of frost is her embrace
Silent are all angels
As sheâs striding by
In her wake only snow
Pure and dead she rise

As the memory of summer stands aflame
Gone the warmth of a better yesterday
Facing the dawn, cold and alone
Dim the stars that shine so distant
Vain are we all, but no gods to judge us
For mourning times of hope and lesser hurt
Be it know that our kind will never die
We take but one step back into the shadows

As winter comes 
Frozen are her lips
Of grey her colours
Deadly her embrace
Gone are all the angels
As sheâs drifting by
In her wake but nothingness
All still as she rise

As the memory of summer stands aflame
Gone the warmth of a better yesterday
Facing the dawn, cold and alone
Dim the stars that shine so distant
Vain are we all, but whom to judge us
For mourning times of hope and lesser hurt
Be it know that our kind will never die
We take but one step back into the shadows
