[originally by O.R.E.]"Conquest, love and self perserverance - the gospel of apitude"

[Music and Lyrics by Tomas Pettersson / Ordo Rosarius Equilibrio]

Salvage is close at hand Whispers an idle man,
patiently waiting salvation to come
Aptitude yet unsung gushing of devildom,
factual salvage but likely for some
Blessing is found in he, freedom and clemency,
retches a man in his quest for relief
We are the gods who reap virtues of barren needs,
only the apt are predestined to be

'Christ was of subterfuge; evil disguised for good,
human indulgence must be realized
God was a wicked man forged out of reprimand,
founded to hinder abundance to rise
Kingdoms will rise and fall change is the source of all
ruin ensues in the course of renewal
Tears they will fall for me purging the chastity,
Aptitude rising by reason of zeal'

Conquest before the fall; Thou can not love them all,
love under will is the whole of the law
Tales of the humankind carved in the heart of time,
failure to learn will resolve in decline
Abstinence is in vain pleasure without restraint,
aptitude gained in convergence with will
God of eternal life save us from all these lies,
rages a man in constraint of denial

'Christ was of subterfuge; evil disguised for good,
human indulgence must be realized
God was a wicked man forged out of reprimand,
founded to hinder abundance to rise
Kingdoms will rise and fall change is the source of all
ruin ensues in the course of renewal
Tears they will fall for me purging the chastity,

Love under Will
Love under Will
Love under Will
Love under Will
Love under Will
Love under Will
