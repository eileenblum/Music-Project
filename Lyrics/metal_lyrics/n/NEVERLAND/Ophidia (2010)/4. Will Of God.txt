I am away from my home
I hoped to find this kingdom
That is said to be our home

I killed a friend yesterday
I don't know his name
All was in the name of God

[Chorus:]
But all we did was to fight
Living a lie after lie
They made us to kill
In the name of God

Some of us understood
What lies are beneath
And the truth died
But we are so few to act
And tell the tale of love

And here we are
The kingdom lies ahead
...dead

[Chorus:]
But all we did was to fight
Living a lie after lie
They made us to kill
In the name of God

In the name of God

He never asked you to kill
He asked for you to love and believe
This is His will
Thus is the Will of God.

No one is there to see
No one is there to believe
No one is there to hear
No one is there to save
