[In memory of Robert Jordan (R.I.P.)]

I conquered your past
I know what awaits you in the time to pass
I am your part, I am your doom
I am your end, I bind your hands
I scream darkness
I am the voice inside your head

I was born to feed the sheep
Seed the wheat
A country boy like me

I never heard of tales
A boy who saves
A hero of the day

I want a life to share
With a wife to love
And my kids will grow with me

And as I am getting old
I will feel the cold
And die peacefully

I want to sleep away this nightmare

They say the darkness arriving
With tales of kingdoms crying
And I saw my lands in fear
My friends are dying
Friends are dying

My death was my own birthday
I had the power to save
But I felt the madness
Crawling inside my head
They died by my hands

I want to believe
I have a chance to change the way
Nothing to save
Get rid of this voice inside my head

I saw them dying
Trying to save me from myself
And they failed

Nations cried before me
As I cried for them alone
And I failed

Yes I failed
And I failed
Yes I have to fight it all
Yet I have to fight till the end
Just save me from my soul

They say the darkness arriving
With tales of kingdoms crying
And I saw the lands in tears
My friends are dying
I am dying

I want to believe
I have a chance to change the way
Nothing to save
Get rid of this voice inside my head

The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills
