Standing in this empty room
Filled with empty crowds
Facing all these fancy fools
Who wear all the crowns

There she comes
Oh I wish I had the power to ask
Who she likes
Oh I wish I had the chance to be the man

A small boy in a small world
With a hope to reach to the World's end

[Chorus:]
Oh, there she comes again
Speak to me, speak to me
I swear, I will tell you how I feel
This time, this time I swear

I hope you will love me back someday

Someday

The boy had no hope
His heart was like a ship, lost in the storm
She had no desire for him
He was just another soul, feeding her thoughts

A small boy in this lone world
With shattered dreams and a sweet scar that burns

[Chorus:]
Oh, there she comes again
Speak to me, speak to me
I swear, I will tell you how I feel
This time, this time I swear

I hope you will love me back someday

Just bring me back my hopes
Give me back my thoughts
Don't let me fall
I just ask for a smile of yours

[Chorus:]
Oh, there she comes again
Speak to me, speak to me
I swear, I will tell you how I feel
This time, this time I swear

I hope you will love me back someday

Speak to me

There you come again
Speak to me, speak to me
I swear
I will tell you how I feel this time
This time, I swear...
