Close your eyes
Just dream and try
Try to reach it
Forget all desires

[Chorus:]
Surrendered to our greed
Desroyed all we need
Now we leave our homes
To find out last bright hope

Leaving no trails behing
Nothing solid to remember
Nothing to envy now
Nothing tender

Could you the blight
We were brought on this life
Now it is time to leave it all behind

A dark memory
Always to remember
No greed to surrender

[Chorus:]
Surrendered to our greed
Desroyed all we need
Now we leave our homes
To find out last bright hope

A new life to achieve
The last hope shall remain
Even if it is only dream
Needles to say

No more room for hate
Greed was our sin
Mongering for power we did
We fought, we urged to kill

No more room for it
No more we need this

[Chorus:]
Surrendered to our greed
Desroyed all we need
Now we leave our homes
To find out last bright hope

Even if its only a dream
The last hope shall remain
