I created a little lie
And let it cast aside the reason
I created the web of lies
And name it like a stage of drama
Intimidated the life
And none cared what I've become
I dared to stop it now
But the show has already begun

[Chorus:]
A step away from the mirror
And still the vision is dim
A mistake away from the terror
And the ophidian falls on these lies

Wonderous it is to see it all dissolve
Despised the wickedness
Even when I did break the light
I wondered how this darkness could run

When did I
How did I
How could I
Start the fire

When the lie
Starts to shine
Set it free
And let em die

[Chorus:]
A step away from the mirror
And still the vision is dim
A mistake away from the terror
And the ophidian falls on these lies

Once they are breached
nothing to turn them from their path
It is like building castles
just put on another life

Lie, lie, lie, lie
Oh, they lie
We lie

I created a little lie
And let it cast aside the reason

I created a sane soul
And a milion ways to spoil

[Chorus:]
A step away from the mirror
And still the vision is dim
A mistake away from the terror
And the ophidian falls on these lies

One life, one lie
One lie, one life
One lie, one life
One life, one lie
