[feat. Urban Breed]

I give life to all I host
I spin the wheel for the life I grow
We live four seasons on your own
In our ways for our home

Why crop me
Why hold me
Why do you keep taking our hopes away

They came, the Man in hordes
They left behind only corpses
We fought hard to save our home
How many died, how many lost?

Tell me! How many lost?

Barren and forgotten
Did they just burn another
Predators are everywhere

Not all are so cruel
Not everyone's a fool
Nothing is desperately hopeless

Believe in your heart
Search deep inside
And find the love you need
To bring us the hope of light

In the end we are to say our goodbyes
And leave Mankind to their own demise

They came, the Man in hordes
They left behind only corpses
We fought hard to save our home
To save our home

Silenced the wolves, there are no more howls
Tell me what we did, what was the cause?
Because...

They came, the Man in hordes
They left behind only corpses
We fought hard to save our home
How many died, how many lost?

Silence the wolves

No hope
