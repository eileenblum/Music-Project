[Bonus track]

Hordes of darkness are approaching
A child tale becomes the hunter
History repeats itself now
Only this time, it is darker

The wolf is howling
Dices are rolling
Dragon will remember
Tears are falling

[Chorus:]
Three souls left their lives behind
With a hope of their lives to settle
A tale is waiting to be told
All about brothers losing their battle

All of them, they will be dead
Hordes of darkness are approaching

Ionizing odds
No one to call
No aid will come
We are ten to one
We will hold our ground
We will suffer
Perhaps we will fall
But we will prevail

There is no hope, He will conquer

[Chorus:]
Three souls left their lives behind
With a hope of their lives to settle
A tale is waiting to be told
All about brothers losing their battle

Three souls left their lives behind
With a hope of their lives to settle
A tale is waiting to be told
All about brothers losing their battle

Losing their battles!
Oh, they are losing their battles...

Somebody to save their souls?
