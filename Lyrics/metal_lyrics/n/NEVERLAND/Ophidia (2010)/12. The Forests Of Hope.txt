[Bonus track]

When the time will come, I'll take you to my land
Where the secret gates have keys
When the days will come, I'll carry all my dreams
Through the oceans magic breeze

I will take you home through the forests of hope
I will hold you tight from the winds
I will take you home through the mountains of light
And wil reach a new planet unseen

When the time will come I'll take you to my land
Where the secret gates have keys

I've wandered through valleys of mystery nights
I've searched through the kingdoms of pain
My visions were colored with echoing shades
My homeland an island on waves

When the time will come I'll take you to my land
Where the secret gates have keys
