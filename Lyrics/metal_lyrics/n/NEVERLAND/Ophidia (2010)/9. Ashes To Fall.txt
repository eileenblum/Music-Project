Ashes of the fallen
Mostly friends, some unknown to me
Died anyway

Hopes that are broken, at the edge of fifteen
Now tell me why?

[Chorus:]
Your ill makings have left me in cold
Help me no more, tell me why I had to die
I awake in a horror show now
You killed all this life, just for a price you liked

I see our lives burning
Living on the edge, wandering why
How to run, how to hide
Escaping form a cruel demise

A bomb or perhaps the snow I slept in
Tough only ruins lie where home was standing
I still sleep there pretending
Only if I had the strenght to end it

[Chorus:]
Your ill makings have left me in cold
Help me no more, tell me why I had to die
I awake in a horror show now
You killed all this life, just for a price you liked

Now tell me why
The spirit haunts

Help me no more
Rape me no more
Haunt me no more
Stop this cruel war

Help me no more
Rape me no more
Haunt me no more
Kill me no more

[Chorus:]
Your ill makings have left me in cold
Help me no more, tell me why I had to die
I awake in a horror show now
You killed all this life, just for a price you liked
