[In memory of Mike Baker (R.I.P.)]

Life and death were just the names of a game
We are all players and none asked what I think
Marbled stones and their names where nothing but a scene
I must admit I know nothing of this game

Time is my preadator, stalking
Stalking

[Chorus:]
Take my hand and call my name once more
You were my last resort, I need comfort
In my time of need you are gone
Beyond the realms of life, I want you back home

In the dark, haunted by the light
Alone I breathe, alone I suffer this life
Take away all the promises you'ver made
Leave me alon, just as you did
Just as you did

I saw you staring to the skies above
But then your touch was cold and I can't do a thing
Your path was taken to a place unknown to me
I had to move on with this scar to bear

Time is my preadator, stalking
Stalking
Taking away
Now it was your turn to step away

[Chorus:]
Take my hand and call my name once more
You were my last resort, I need comfort
In my time of need you are gone
Beyond the realms of life, I want you back home

Take my hand tonight
Tonight, take my hand

Call my name once more,
You were my last resort
I need comfort
