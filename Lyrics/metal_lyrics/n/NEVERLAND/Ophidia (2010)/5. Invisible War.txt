[feat. Jon Oliva]

Come create a clarity
Blur it with altered reality
Make them believe
There are several paths to take

Don't let them judge
Let them take what you say
Whether they want or not
It will be done in your way

[Chorus:]
The God is now dead
Long live the new God
Wasn't this your aim?
Just to control our lives

You only take
And give nothing to hold on
Never asked, only forced
This invisible war

Don't let them judge
Let them take what you say
It will be done in your way
The Eagle never loses a prey

Come create a clarity
Hide it with all the games they need
Ignore the poor hearts
And focus on your victory

It wil be done in you way
The Eagle never loses a prey

[Chorus:]
The God is now dead
Long live the new God
Wasn't this your aim?
Just to control our lives

You only take
And give nothing to hold on
Never asked, only forced
This invisible war

Another blight in the land of sand
Just another blight
Just give me the light
