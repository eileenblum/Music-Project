It was a share of grief
That I tasted and everyone else here knows what it means
Like a wildflower, I wanted to stand against it
And they wanted me to kill

Desires are gone
Walking on this path alone
A fire is burning inside

Another tale to tell
His heart is like his hell
Burning, burning alone

[Chorus:]
Endless dreams
Meaningless as they may seen
Though they are mean

Mindless me
I cannot understand the world around me

It was a tale of belief
Telling that a boy was defending his home against evil

And as it is known
They wanted him to murder his own

And now I am done
I hope to leaveit all behind
They want me to die

Another tale to tell
Just how easy it is for them
To change the world around

Desires are gone
Walking on this path alone
A fire is burning inside

Another tale to tell
Just how easy it is for them
It is me dying alone

[Chorus:]
Endless dreams
Meaningless as they may seen
Though they are mean

Mindless me
I cannot understand the world around me

Endless dreams
Meaningless as they may seen
Though they are mean

Mindless me
No one leaves the hive
As it was told to me

No one leaves the hive
