Regretting the history of Mankind
Reflecting the shame, reflecting the lie
With every step, we march towards our end
All that is lost, our life is broken
All that we had has been broken

Tried to change the order, did we achieve?
Have we made it, had we believed?
And now we are paying the price that it takes.

Regretting the history of mankind
Reflecting the shame, reflecting the lie
Now it ends, now its gone
Seeing all this life is a lie
