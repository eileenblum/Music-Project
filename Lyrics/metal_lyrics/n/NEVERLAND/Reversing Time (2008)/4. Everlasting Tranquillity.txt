If the rainbow is what you dream of, I can catch it for you now
If the stars are shiny diamonds, I can catch them, Iâll show you how

Just a smile and I am yours, Iâd sell my kingdom
Thatâs how it goes
Just a smile and I am yours, Iâd sell my kingdom, thatâs how it goes

Iâll be the moon over your sea
Your hope, your everlasting tranquillity
Iâll be the moon over your sea
Your hope, your tranquillity

If the sky is what youâve reached for, I will climb there for you now
If our souls are moving shadows, weâll dance, Iâll teach you how

Just a smile and I am yours, Iâd sell my kingdom
Thatâs how it goes
Just a smile and I am yours, Iâd sell my kingdom, thatâs how it goes

Iâll be the moon over your sea
Your hope, your everlasting tranquillity
Iâll be the moon over your sea
Your hope, your tranquillity
