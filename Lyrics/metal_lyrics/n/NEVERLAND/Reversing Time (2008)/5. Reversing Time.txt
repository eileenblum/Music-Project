Why canât I heal this life?
I do see myself dissolving, like a lie

Cannot stop, this Wheel spins
Reversing the time as I need it to be, I take my leave

What I canât refuse is this hope of reaching you
You left me
Like the time, it has forgotten me, has forsaken me
Iâm alone, it left me

Looked into this mirror
Couldnât see what is left of me
Of the past I tried to see
Only dust, only holes of me

What I canât refuse is this hope of reaching you
You left me
Like the time, it has forgotten me, has forsaken me
Iâm alone, it left me
