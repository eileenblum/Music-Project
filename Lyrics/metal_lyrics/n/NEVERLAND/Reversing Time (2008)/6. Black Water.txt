Water means to cleanse
Pure as a glass to see
What is behind the waves?
What holds the sea as a mystery?

Then we found something dark
Hidden beneath the ground
Perhaps it was a sign to see
Not to talk it out loud

Color is black, let us turn back
If we dig it out, it will end the game

As if our lives depend on it, we dig
We fought on each otherâs share for more profit
Now it tears us apart as it is scarce more than ever
We fight for the Black Water

Water is black, let us turn back
Water is black, let us turn back
It is tainted

Due to its power, we will see cities fall
We will burn each othersâ soul
We will see more children cry
We will see more dead cities
It is not the water that is black, it is us

It is us who fell off the cliffs of greed

As if our lives depend on it, we dig
We fought on each otherâs share for more profit
Now it tears us apart as it is scarce more than ever
We fight for the Black Water

Water is black, let us turn back
Water is black, let us turn back
It is tainted
