Through a clearing his eyes gaze down, below at lights,
Theyâre so many like a milky way
Down on earthâs floor

He stands up and walks away
Heâs allowed to look
But heâs not allowed to go there and stay

Now the children of deep winter sing and play
On the mountain of judgement the children sing
For every heaven there is a key

He stands up and walks away
Heâs allowed to look
But heâs not allowed to go there and stay
