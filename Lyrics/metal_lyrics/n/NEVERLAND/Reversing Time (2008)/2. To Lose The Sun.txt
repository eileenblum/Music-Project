Couldnât see it your face
There was a cold in your gaze
Was like a maze of words
Doctors couldnât ease your pain

I remember your smile
Why?

I remember your first birthday
I remember your first gift to me

They were all great
You were there staring at me
With hopes in your eyes

And thoughts in your head
You were there trying to say
âFather please save me nowâ

No father is to lose a son
No sun should leave the sky
To the dust, to a shadow
Why have you gone?
I ask you now

Life is now leaving you
Like an empty hole you are
I hold your body to catch your breath
Pretending that you are alive

I remember your cries
Lies!

I cannot lose you now my dear
No more dead angels I want to see

No more tales of hope, only want to see you alive
Please walk again with me

No more lies of faith, just to see you dead
Want to see you back, still smiling

No father is to lose a son
No sun should leave the sky
To the dust, to a shadow
Why have you gone?
I ask you now

Nothingâs left
No more games
Only holes, without meanings
No more tales, no more a kiss
Just one more day, before it ends.

What has happened to me?
Is this the fate?
Or another sad tale to end that I had to see?

No more tales, no more a kiss
Just one more day, before it ends
No more tales, no more a kiss
Only a suffering, just your death

No father is to lose a son
No sun should leave the sky
To the dust, to a shadow
Why have you gone?
I ask you now

Why have you left me?
Youâve taken him from me, he is gone...
