I wondered where did our hearts belong
They seem to live beyond this world of judgement
I asked if we live beyond this dream of darkness

Where it limits us with shallow hopes
There is a life beyond this Mountain of Joy
Whether if this life was the Oblivion
We will live after the Wheel ends it time
Until it starts again

Wondered where did our hearts belong
I saw so many friends gone
I saw so many lives rust
I wondered what it meant
I asked for another life to live with you

Where it limits us with shallow hopes
There is a life beyond this Mountain of Joy
Whether if this life was the Oblivion
We will live after the Wheel ends it time
Until it starts again
