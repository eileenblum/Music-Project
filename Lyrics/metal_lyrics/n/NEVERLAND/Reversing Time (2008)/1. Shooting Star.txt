There are some stars that shine so bright?
And yours, it shines throughout the night?
Is life a passage of hope, or are we sailing on a drifting boat?

Sail across the milky way of melting hearts
On the Moonâs darkest hill or even on our journey towards Mars

Take me higher, oh set me free like a shooting star
Like a shooting star
Our eyes are set on fire in this universe of only you and me

A touch of Eden, a touch of glittering stardust
Take the voyage but donât forget
That the rainbows need your smile or they will rust

Take me higher, oh set me free like a shooting star
Our eyes are set on fire in this universe of only you and I
Take me higher, oh set me free like a shooting star
Our eyes are set on fire in this universe of only you and me

I believe in you, I believe in me
I believe in this world of you and me
