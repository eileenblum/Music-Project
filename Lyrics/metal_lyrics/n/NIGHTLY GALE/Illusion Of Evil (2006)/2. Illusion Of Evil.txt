The last time I heard
No one was talking
The last time I saw him
No one was there
A part of me that I knew
A part of me that was alive
Cries filled with blood
Free me and I'll be myself
Nice and understanding
I'd like to have clear account
To start a real life
A part of me that I knew
A part of me that was alive
Cries filled with blood

Again alone it's not fair
I tried so hard to be myself
People are disguessed of me
They are acting strangely
An old sister has reminded me
Person known from older ages
That maybe loved me
But only till friday

I heard from old sister
The words of strange songs
Her scream has stopped long ago time
Sentenced for silence in blood
Old sister isn't here anymore
In my heaven you can hear screams
I think about that sometimes at night
In the morning they'll free my hands again

I saw her face
It was illusion of evil
Evil was her name
Evil was her identity
I remember scream
Hands filled with blood
I became their prisoner

I was good blind idiot

I'm worried for all souls lost in time
I'd like to get out of here to free them

Again alone it's not fair
I tried so hard to be myself
People are disguessed of me
They are acting strangely
An old sister has reminded me
Person known from older ages
That maybe loved me
But only till friday

Old sister isn't here anymore
In my heaven you can hear screams
I think about that sometimes at night
In the morning they'll free my hands again.
