For you I got lost
For you I left everything forever
You called me I came
I got stabbed in a heart
I feel broken empty
The tears won't fall anymore

I got the rests of your life
I was like a dog at your command
I humbled in the name of love
It's the end of Your love

How could you humiliate me
You betrayed everything I believed.
Adversity and fear of loneliness
Kill me slowly every day

For you I got lost
For you I left everything forever

It was the last phone I answered.

You left me all alone
I'm not your friend anymore.
