Vanity it is your name
Vanity it is your life
Please let me help you
I want only one thing
Destroy your pride
Possess your life

You met me I'm a beacon
You think of what I want
I'm the pilot of your life
You've found paradise

Vanity it is your name
Vanity it is your life
Please let me help you
I want only one thing
You'll cry and beg
You little girl

Real decompose of body
The stink of your own sloth
I don't know any mercy
I found my paradise

My treasure
A little butterfly
My treasure
Only for me

I need your blood
I need to wash my face
I wish I could start again
I need your blood
I need to wash my face
I wan't your vanity

Looking back I am thinking of pleasant moments
Your smile back to me from an old photo
I was a fool believing it is going to be alright
Relativity turned out to be cruel and I was pathetic

My Vanity

I need your blood
I need to wash my face
I wish I could start again
I need your blood
I need to wash my face
I wan't your vanity

In my arms she was safe
Do You Believe in happiness
When you are in my thoughts
I can see your death
I set you free
