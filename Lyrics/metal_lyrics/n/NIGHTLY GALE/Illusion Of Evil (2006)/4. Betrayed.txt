Nothing looks the same anymore
Only a picture
Of forgotten days

Look at my face
Can you see me
Without the future?
Without illusions?
I scream in fury
I ask for help
Won't you leave?
Won't you forget me?
I listen only your advices
And following them
I go straight to abyss.
Don't go away.
I scream in fury
I ask for help
Won't you leave?
Won't you let me down?
Don't go away.

There when I saw her first
I've chosen freedom
There when I saw her first
I've chosen death.

Do I know?
Do I trust you?
I don't know
The answer
I don't know
The destiny
I don't know
The answer
I don't know
The destiny
I don't know

But the way of truth is so close
I'm getting closer towards the truth

I see you

You betrayed me
There is nothing left

Nothing looks the same anymore
Only a picture
Of forgotten days

How I was wrong.
