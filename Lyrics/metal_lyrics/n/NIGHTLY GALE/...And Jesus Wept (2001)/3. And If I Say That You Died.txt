Night full of ecstasy
I remember I was there
But my palms forgot
The softness of her skin
But my voice changed tone
I remember, I told her
Thousands of unnecessary words
I remember only the one

If I say that you died
Will you forgive me your tears?
As a punishment I am empty inside
I scream and bleed in my sleep

And I do not know where I left you
Because you wanted to find yourself?

Words meaning nothing
Many confessions, intimate ones
I found consolation in a secret
And though there were many words
I saw your other face - You laughed

I am tired of this waiting
I forgot all the nights we spent together
And if I say that you died
Will you forgive me my desire?
I wrote these last few words
Because I remember what I told you

And if I say that you died
Will you forgive me my desire?
And if I say that you died
Will you forgive me your tears?

I will never know the secret
I reconciled my life with the time
And when I am alone I laugh asking
For your favourite colour

And I already remember what I told you
I told you that you died
