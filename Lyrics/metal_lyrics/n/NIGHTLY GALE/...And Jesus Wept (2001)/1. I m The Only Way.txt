They've tried to convert me to this faith
but I have chosen isolation
I sacrifice my blood and suffering to God
and to my black soul anxiety

Rape me
Rape my soul

Tell me how to survive another night
Fear means nothing to me, but still!
If I could mark you with desire
You will remain lonely in your own world

Let us talk about the only truth
A few words which will change your life
Your calm existence will guarantee death
Tension and fear will bring salvation

I am the only creator of beauty
You will ask what's the creator's name
Call out to me
For a moment I will not tell you to wait
You're hungry for knowledge
Love me

Where you die every day
I open the gates of endless dreams
I am only an unfulfilled dream
I am only a part of the whole
Where I kill every day
I open gates to a new world
I am the omnipotent master there
My name's "liar"
