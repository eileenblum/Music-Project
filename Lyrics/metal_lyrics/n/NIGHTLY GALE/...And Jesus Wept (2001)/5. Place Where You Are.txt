I'm losing you
This is an ill dream
Invisible so

Gone
I chose for You
A lonesome place
So quiet
and beautiful
A lonesome place

I've lost you, gone
You died lonely
I killed you
Silently

You died in a dream
Lost paradise for you
This is my vengeance
For your faith in God

I killed so suddenly

The funeral for you
Without witnesses and ceremony
In green paradise
You were so naked
The funeral for you
Without hope or a priest
In green paradise
You were so beautiful

I am the way for you
