I heard once
The wind roar in trees
I heard once
Children laugh
And I cried
For the lost life

Let them discover solitude
Let them discover every sorrow
"And I will give you hope" said the master
But it is already not there
Let them discover love
Let them discover every day
"And I will give you hope" said the master
But it is already not there

Decay is their play
Despair is their game
And only screams can be heard
When tears wake them from their dreams

This dark night - Kills me
This cold night - Kills me

There's only chaos around
Sunk in solitude
They can only see a black shadow
Murmur wakes them from their dreams

And her solitude - beauty
And her loving - beauty
And killing her - beauty
And her rebirth - beauty

In the name of the father
I die every night
In the name of the father
The only way left for me
