Congregate
As darkness falls
Shadows roam
This temple of sin
Virgin witches undress
Singing with lowly praise
Va koram do rex satan
Do koram va rex satan
Begotten son unbless thy flock
Leading herd into the fog
Proclaim thee on the feast of doom
Expecting thy salvation soon
Copulation at the altar
Breaks the holy seals of Christ
Thy blessed apostles weep
When all wItches do give praise
Va koram do rex satan
Do koram va rex satan
