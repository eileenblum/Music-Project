Virgin defloration
Fecundating Magdelane
Ritual copulation
Inbreeds the Nazarene
Torrents Tossed
Over the throne of God
Goatish blood
All was nailed upon the cross
He cometh into this world
Birthed, cursed, thirsting for souls
The torrid plain his cradle becomes
Their sons, slit, their throats speaketh of his
Burning triumph, Satan writhe in sin
Born of endless fire, his deep black pupils snake like thin
Crucifixion
A sacrifice he's not
Born of ancient darkness
Christ was not of goatborn blood
The sacrificial lamb he's not
Born of ancient darkness
Christ was not of goatborn blood
