Dolorous chants followed the rite of Eucharist
The sun had vanished on the last day of Christ
Spoiled blood and mouldered flesh
The wine and bread he had offered
But the savant of heaven
Betrayed by Iscariot
And followed by
The command of crucifixion
Demonic whispers
Infested the saviour's thoughts
Back in gethsemane's morbid garden
Prayers faded unheard
With the funeral wind
Only a cerement embraced
The naked corpse
For his flesh was mouldered
Before the dawn of the third day...
