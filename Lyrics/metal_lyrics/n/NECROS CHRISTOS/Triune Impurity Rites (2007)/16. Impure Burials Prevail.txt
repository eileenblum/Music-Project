Endless funerals
Darkness rituals
Premature burials
Grave sounding requiem bells

Foul black milk of magdalene
Which once fed the nazarene
Had its path untrodden
In a temple in sodom

Christ did fail
Impure burials prevail
For this is the end
Armageddon is at hand

See the holy family
Even holier in their trinity
Blasphemed is their way in sin
By a rite done in siddim

Christ did fail
Impure burials prevail
For this is the end
Armageddon is at hand

Long forgotten are the ways of christ
He was tortured, whipped and crucified
The golgothian nailed, heaven`s entities
Fall forever from the halls of peace

Christ did fail
Impure burials prevail
For this is the end
Armageddon is at hand

Foul black milk of magdalene
Which once fed the nazarene
Had its path untrodden
In a temple in sodom

Christ did fail
Impure burials prevail
For this is the end
Armageddon is at hand

See the holy family
Even holier in their trinity
Blasphemed is their way in sin
By a rite done in siddim
