Once touched by the light of christ
Holy oblivion had burned his eyes

God blessed
The nazarene
Before his death
His crown of doom
His blood he`d seen
Christ blessed
He'll terminate
After his death
His crucifix
His throne of hate

Bodies lay
In copulation
Bodies pray
In desecration
Bodies slayed
Insemination
Its christ`s death
Black mass desecration

Adoration passed
Unto the holy betrayer
The apostolic traitor
Of ancient judaa

Iscariot blessed
Blessed by exaltation
Bearer of the skull
A chalice dim of blood

Excommunion
Of the galilee prayer
Occultation
Of the genezareth bailer

The holy prince
Had fecundated
The virgin nun
And licked christ's cunt

God blessed
The nazarene
Before his death
His crown of doom
His blood he'd seen
Christ blessed
He'll terminate
After his death
His crucifix
His throne of hate

Bodies lay
In copulation
Bodies pray
In desecration
Bodies slayed
Insemination
Its christ`s death
Black mass desecration

Once touched by the light of christ
Holy oblivion had burned his eyes
