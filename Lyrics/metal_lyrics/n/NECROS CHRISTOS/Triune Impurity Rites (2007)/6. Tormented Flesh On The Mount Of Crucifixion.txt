Merchant of light
So holy in his sight
But his garment
A worm of fallen angels
Ordained king of jews
Hung high upon the cross
Nailed to god
And his home in heaven
Funeral flesh of Nazarene
The putrescent crown
But blessed by the father
On the mount of crucifixion
Christ died under a beclouded sky
And damnation
Entered the hearts of the mourners
A last kiss on the bare feet
The salty blood of the redeemer
On the scarlet lips of Mary...
