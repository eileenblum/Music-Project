The bells chime for midnight
Blood runs in the chalice to invoke
Spirits of demons come
While apparitions burning in the smoke
The doom commence the ritual spells were cast
Exorcism fail damnation awaits
Damned are the ways of black magic
Unholy opening of the gates
The goat appears
God's grand spell commands him to hell
The witches dance
Semen runs down their cunts
Deathless in Spiritual Evil
