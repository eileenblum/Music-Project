My name is Baal-Sebul
I am King of Ekron
A Baal of the Highest
My Kingdom is Tehom
I strike down all morals
I'm the ruler of man
As I'm Baal of Ekron
My reign is at hand
Come, gimme worship
And build me a shrine
'cause I'm Baal of Ekron
Your women be mine
And doom is my saviour
And darkness my friend
As I'm Baal of Ekron
Taking over Command
Ab-hamon
Baal of Ekron
Blessed in Tehom
Baal of Ekron
