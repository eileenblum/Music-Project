Bones
Lay bare
The stones
Removed
The witch
Gets welcomed
By the breath of doom 
Shrines
Of slumber
Disturbing
Endless rest
Her magic
Unblessed
By a mancy of death

The body's dead but though it speaks
Midnight's calling the deceased
An omen for the dead to come
The spells are cast the rite is done
Necromantique nun

Baalat ob
The body starts to rise
Seals
Unlocked
A candle
Enlights the grave
Her voice
Doth summon
The ghost
Has finally come
Dead eyes
Do glow
Kischuf
Is on the run

Familiar
Spirits
Invoked
Secret lore
The evil
Woman
Had cursed
En-dor
She brings
To life
Whatever
Once has lived
No call
Unheard
No body
Shan't resist
