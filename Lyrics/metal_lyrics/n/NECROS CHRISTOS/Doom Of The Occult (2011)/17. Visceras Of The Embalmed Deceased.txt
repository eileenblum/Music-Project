Hega-maat-re
Setep-en-amun
Placed in his tomb

The soul does wander
The land of the dead
Pondereous slumber

The flesh has been drained
From the liquid of life
Dormant reign

Candles do fade
The light's nearly gone
Darkness invades
Through the amduat
Comes an apostle of doom
Mouldering sanctum

Visceras of the embalmed deceased
