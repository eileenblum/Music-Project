Dehenet
Beneath the mount does the entrance lay
To the black vale
Of the dead
Meretseger mourns in praise
For the fleshly pale

Descend the stairs
Into the maze
Yet no one dares
To vex the grave

The king's entombed
To free his ka
His soul's succumbed
To Amon-Ra

Foulish crypt
Mummified, dried, darkness sipped
Lies the vast god of Egypt
While the body's left liquidless
In Duat's darkness

Descending 
Into the kingly tomba

Mouldering
In darkness' slumber
Descending
Into the kingly tomba
