Hooded priest in black invoked the sacred legions of doom to come
graves on blasphemous shores opened and heaven weeped by goat command

Tomb songs chimed by bells of impure burials
as goat witches dance and commanded by rites of blasphemous funerals
hooded necromancer invocated betwixt necrophile copulation
holy corpses lay bare on the tide of grave damnation

see the fog of doom emerge from the graves...
and smell the stench of the burning corpse of christ...

chalices ran empty as the congregation scattered
necromantic rites soon to end
the scourging of virgin was heard unto heaven
as nails raped the flesh of christ's right hand

see the fog of doom emerge from the graves...
and smell the stench of the burning corpse of christ...
