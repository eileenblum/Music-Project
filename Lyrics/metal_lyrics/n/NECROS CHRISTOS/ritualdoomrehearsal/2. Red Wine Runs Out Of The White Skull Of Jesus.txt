A morbid crucifixion upon a pale corpse that hung
on a cross in which shadows a black stinger stung
nails rammed flesh on the mount of golgotha
blood blessed
the i.n.r.i. death
in galilee
did the bailer pray
a holy mass
for the nazarene death
the audience mournful cries
were even heard in the blackened skies
and magdalene licked his last sin
as the troops of pilate impaled him
red wine runs out of the white skull of jesus

in his tomb
his bones were mouldered soon
the holy slave
his skull was stolen from his grave
visions of mary
she's the bearer of the skull of jesus
and angels seven
four their souls rot in the vault of heaven
