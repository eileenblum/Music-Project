[2003 "Black Mass Desecration" Demo Track]Death of christos

Holy infant died and lost
On the cross
By the doom of nekros
Its the death of christos

Burning souls of infamy
Reaching for his crown
Burning sparks are to be seen
From his hellplaced throne

Summoned entities
Gathered and fall into this mournful prayer
Tortured nazarene
Mouldered and fall even in galilea

Heaven's gates are opening
For the fallen slayer
All holyness shall burning
Before the son of man

The white light mission
Damned in his vision
Had died

Holy infant died and lost
On the cross
By the doom of nekros
Its the death of christos

Burning souls of infamy
Reaching for his crown
Burning sparks are to be seen
From his hellplaced throne

Summoned entities
Gathered and fall into this mournful prayer
Tortured nazarene
Mouldered and fall even in galilea
