[2003 "Black Mass Desecration" Demo Track]Subsonic angels
Gained ancient nuclear power
The homosexual of heaven
Blasphemed by the conquest of triumph

Triumphant goat command
Bonethrone triumph

His majesty`s command
Soon to be at hand
Hear his burning cries
Overshadowed by his lies

Priests drone and incantate
But their tones did abnormally fade
Bestial summoned power waves
Beyond the unholy graves

Triumphant goat command
Bonethrone triumph

Expulsion amplified
At the gates of hell
Amputation terrified
The holy angels`cell

Cascade bells of doom
Chaimed upon the plain
Winged demons wail
See their filthy slime
Beneath the sands of time

And their swords of sin
Scorched unholy lust
Buried by sodom's dust

And eternal light
Never shone so bright
As it died

His majesty's command
Soon to be at hand
Hear his burning cries
Overshadowed by his lies

Priests drone and incantate
But their tones did abnormally fade
Bestial summoned power waves
Beyond the unholy graves

Subsonic angels
Gained ancient nuclear power
The homosexual of heaven
Blasphemed by the conquest of triumph
