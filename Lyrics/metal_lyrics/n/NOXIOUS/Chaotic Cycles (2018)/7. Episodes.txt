I've lost everything I have
Everything I was
I've lost everything I have
Everything I was
Everything I will be

Depression pressed in concrete
Emotions crushed under the weight
My soul peeled away to reveal the parasite
My soul is peeled away to reveal my own self
Depression pressed in concrete
Emotions crushed under the weight
I'm not a martyr I'm a shell of a broken man
Defeated, defeated
A failure of my destiny
My innocence has been drawn and quartered
My grave is not of this Earth
I'm searching for something
Between all the silence
Reading between the lines
Of all of this violence
All of this violence
All of this violence
I've lost everything I have
Everything I was
Everything I will be

We're made to believe that there's one path for all men
They say it's how the world turns but it's all bullshit
It's just a front for selfishness
Maybe I'm not the problem
