I keep spinning and spinning
Circling down this pit of despair
What have I done to bring this pain upon myself The light always gets darker at the end of the tunnel I have everything to fear
What has brought me back here
I've lost myself
I look around and all I seem to see is absence of solace and comfort What has brought us back here
Surrounded by everything we fear
Life's looking like there is no way out
It all seems so bleak
I can't continue this false image that I am that weak
I'm my own lost idol
Trapped inside this Chaotic Cycle
I keep spinning and spinning
Circling down this pit of despair
What have I done to bring this pain upon myself The light always gets darker at the end of the tunnel I have everything to fear
What has brought me back here
I've found myself
I'm my own lost idol
Trapped inside this Chaotic Cycle
(Spinning and spinning...)
I am so fucked trying to be this worlds crutch
We're all so fucked trying to be this worlds crutch No, no, no, no
We're all so fucked so just let me rot We're all so fucked just let me rot Just let me rot
We're so fucked
Just let me rot Just let me rot
