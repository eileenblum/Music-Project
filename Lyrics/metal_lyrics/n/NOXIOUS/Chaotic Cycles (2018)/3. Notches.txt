Lost in black
Fade to grey
Doesn't matter 'cause we all die the same way
I'm not saying
I condone it
Some of my friends got bodies on 'em,
I say fuck it
I'm against the violence,
I don't get it
But what would you do?
What the fuck would you do if you grew up in this fucking mess?
Everyday's a fight for survival
Lost in black
Fade to grey
Doesn't matter 'cause we all die the same way
I'm not saying
I condone it
Some of my friends got bodies on 'em,
I say fuck it
I'm against the violence,
I don't get it
But what would you do?
What the fuck would you do if you grew up in this fucking mess?
I'm getting sick and tired of all these shots
And getting tired of all these shitty blocks
Why don't you fuck off and let us find our own way
Had enough wondering if it is my last day
I never understood 12 getting in my fucking way
And I may be lost
Again I may be failing in my sin
Cut me away
I'm drowning in this array
I'm just drowning in this array
I don't condone this shit
All of this makes me sick
The last thing
I need is you all judging me
I'm not defined by the company I keep
Crawling, scratching, and climbing my way out
By any means necessary
Don't talk shit about what you know nothing about
(You don't know shit, you don't know shit)
Don't talk shit about what you know nothing about
(You don't know shit, you don't know)
