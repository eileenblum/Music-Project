[feat. Lucas Shackelford of Dogs]Stay quiet
Stay calm
Can't let them know what's going on in my thoughts
Blood hits the ground,
I try to ignore it
It's not your problem but you know it's over dumb shit
It's not your problem but you know it's over dumb shit
I'm trying to become a changed man
Can't let the streets tell me who I am
This family is falling apart
This neighborhood has become a part of my heart
So much love in all the wrong places
Just trying to survive as the weather changes
Stay in my lane and focus on the children
Put food on the table, make sure no one kills them
Can't let them know what's going on in my brain
Crying every night just to release the pain
No one really cares about what happens here
My mind's overwhelmed by possibilities
At the end of the day we're just scum
I never knew I'd turn out to be scum
I'm cursed, I'm cursed, I'm cursed
I'll never find my worth
I'm cursed, I'm cursed, I'm cursed
Trapped inside this worthless planet Earth
I'm cursed, I'm cursed in this planet Earth
