Yes I'm broken and I think I can't be fixed
Spilling out my heart from behind this pulpit
Maybe it's only a matter of time until
I finally catch my own nine
Praying and begging
God to let me grow old
Maybe one day I'll be a man who can stay gold
I've been running on empty since my birth
Maybe it's only a matter of time until
I finally catch my own nine
Praying and begging
God to let me grow old
Maybe one day I'll be a man who can stay gold
Hopefully these worlds will set me free
Only then will my family truly know me
Maybe it's only a matter of time until
I finally catch my own nine
Praying and begging
God to let me grow old
Maybe one day I'll be a man who can stay gold
Music is my only therapy
My best friends are the only ones that know me
