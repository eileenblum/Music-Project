I regret all of my ways
And I regret choosing the gutter
I come from blood impure
Brick feet with tainted affiliation
I tried to run from what
I thought would hurt me
But ended up hurting myself
But ended up hurting myself
Choices made for my life at a different time before
I truly lived
I pushed too hard to be accepted
Now I will die alone
This tortured soul trapped in my pathetic skin
I guess I'm really broken but how would I know
I'm always self medicating, trying to blur the memories of defeat
In this moment of rare clarity I'll scream to the world
That I'm not proud of nothing I've done
I don't know myself
I don't know myself
Choices made for my life at a different time before
I truly lived
I pushed too hard to be accepted
Now I will die alone
This tortured soul trapped in my pathetic skin
I guess I'm really broken but how would I know
I'm always self medicating, trying to blur the memories of defeat
In this moment of rare clarity I'll scream to the world
That I'm not proud of nothing I've done
I don't know myself
I don't know myself
Leave me alone
I'll only drag you down to my own personal Hell
