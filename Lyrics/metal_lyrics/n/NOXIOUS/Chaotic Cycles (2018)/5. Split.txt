Like splitting hairs life takes it's toll
Constantly thinking back to the innocence you stole
Now I'm left only with this
A broken moral compass
A life full of grey areas
No right, no wrong
I've come to yet another branching path
But once I choose
There's no going back
I can't help someone if
I can't help myself
If I don't know what's right for me then
God help someone else
Then God help someone else
Do I take the high road or do
I sink further
And crawl back to old habits?
Until my neck meets the rope
Until my neck meets the rope
Torn in between what's right and what's wrong
Cracking under the pressure
I forgot to be strong
Cracking under the pressure
I forgot what it is to be strong
Blood is thicker than water
But you can still drown in both
You can still drown
