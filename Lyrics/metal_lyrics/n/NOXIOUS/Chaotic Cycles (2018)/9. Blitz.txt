[feat. pH of Prison]Up and left in the night just like the air in my lungs
For years I've been waiting for this song to be sung
I guess your true love was forever in drugs
Leaving the family you once said that you loved
Fuck you, fuck you
Never once spoke the truth
Fuck you, fuck you
Never once spoke the truth
Fuck you, fuck you
You never spoke the truth
It was always about you
It was always about you
The perfect example of what
I hate
I will never be like you,
I will never be like you
Until this
Earth turns me to dust
Forever forgotten, forever untouched
I see your fate
You will never be enough
This is the end of you
This is the end of us
Breaking free for you was never an option
Your addiction made you solely obnoxious
Back in the day
I was never any better
But now
I've grown, I'll be healing here forever
I won't say that
I stand by all the fucked up minds
But it's reality that stays in our fucked up lives
Mankind is a plague, and that's making it vague
