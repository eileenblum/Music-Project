I thought you were once a brother to me
We shouldered your weight
Why can't you see
I'm tired of you thinking you're on top
But you can only get so high
Until you drop off
Until you drop off
Take the stage, it's all for you
You must be desperate to be in people's view
Claiming to be as deep as the ocean
But only as shallow as it's shores
If you only understood
How this all comes together
People's feelings change
Just like the weather
People's feelings change
Just like the weather
Take the stage, it's all for you
You must be desperate to be in people's view
Claiming to be as deep as the ocean
But only as shallow as it's shores
