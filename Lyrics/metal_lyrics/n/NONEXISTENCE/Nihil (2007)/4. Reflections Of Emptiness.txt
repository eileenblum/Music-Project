Born into nothingness
We are the lost children of pure emptiness
Solitude is our heritage is our fate

This endless void of being in between this endless void

I want to meet you in the fire
Whine non-occurrences forever happen
The explanation lies in everything

Reflections of eternity
Tiny flakes within time
Everything is nothing is everything
Tomorrow I will be gone

And as my blood is drying
And as my soul is dying
Everything is nothing is everything is void

Videbis tacere nonnumquam praestat
Maybe when our hearts are filled with suicide
Will I ever solve my own enigma
