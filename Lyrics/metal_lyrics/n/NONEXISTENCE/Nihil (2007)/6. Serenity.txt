Ruins bleed oblivion
A tired game dissolves in void
Gone astray in my aspirations
Realized departure far too late

Harvest the downfall of a life
Shattered fantasies of burning skies
Serenity forever away
A sorry taste of bitterness remains

My reverence for you collapsed
Guilt spills out of innocence
Yearn for soothing dreams of rain
I bow before the angels of decline
