Dawning of doomsday has arrived
Basking under a black sun

Please let me paint you another lamentation
Decline is certainly to come
Darker and colder and more diffuse
Awake from like to nonexistence

You trap me with insanity
Your branches of despair
The barren fields within me
The dark pictures of your heart

Soon to stand in hollow distress
As coldness will be replacing all emotions
Vast is the emptiness beyond those vacant stars
Forever remain in endless seclusion
