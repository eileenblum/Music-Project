Paint my life in dismal colours
A vision of my own mortality

Please don't say a word
For I know about thy grief
Writhing in broken delusions
Sorrow will spread its wings above us all

The golden coffins in our hearts
Who knows how dead we already are

Please don't say a word
For I know about thy grief
Writhing in broken delusions
Sorrow has spread its wings above us all
