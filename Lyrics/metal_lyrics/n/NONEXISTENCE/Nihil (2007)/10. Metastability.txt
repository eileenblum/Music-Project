Lost inside forgotten ache
Sleep in a timeless room
Infinite exasperation
Falling further somehow

Existence leaves me all alone
Everything I lived for has gone

If life is a river
I am dropping down a waterfall

The waves break over me
Your silence is my death

Darkness without any structure
Complete absence of everything
