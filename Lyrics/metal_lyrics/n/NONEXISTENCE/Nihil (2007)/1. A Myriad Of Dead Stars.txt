One spark outshines aeons of darkness
I am a star fallen from the sky
I am the force that is guiding me
Consciousness and awareness of the universe

Inside the nothingness void takes form
Like planet Earth in endless space and time

This is the age of the shining stars
Each one of them is smiling for me
Now I discern the order of chaos
I know I have always been where I should have been

Here

Nothing can be without its opposite
The seeming antithesis forms a unity

A myriad of dead stars cast shadows on our hearts
An slowly we are dying with every dream that breaks
