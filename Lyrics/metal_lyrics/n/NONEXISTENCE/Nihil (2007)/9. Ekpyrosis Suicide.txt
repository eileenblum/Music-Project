Indifference will come as I turn from your jaded sheen

Is your angelic view just an illusion of sanity
One moment of my purity outshines your entire life

Lifetime of lies

Desist, I am helpless now
Who will arouse the fire
So I will not sleep anymore
And it seems I think of you

Sometimes
Somehow

Purity
