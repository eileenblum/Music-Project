Solitude is what enfolds us now
Harbinger of vast darknesses to come
The shades of autumn are spreading across us

It is you who feeds me with your black milk
My mind is covered by ebony veils
Disaffection corrodes infinite sympathy

You foster my plight with your sight
Your star shines in every colour
I bleed from a thousand wounds

The fall from grace
The crying in vain
The voice inside
The space between

You rip my heart
You shred my soul
My life in ruins
Now all is gone

The sense is pale
I kiss decline
Embrace the fall
The solitude insane
