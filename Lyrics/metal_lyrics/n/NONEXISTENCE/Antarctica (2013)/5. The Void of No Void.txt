tear down the layers of defilement that shroud the pure mind
draw down the depth of vastness into a single innate perception
awake into a change of spiritual perspective
no more difference between the beholder and the seen

replace the form with essence
the void of no void

the mind is great like the infinite nothingness
no more difference between the knower and the known

devoid of appearances
emptied of all processes

supreme reality is tranquil and undifferentiated
form is emptiness and emptiness is form

the true nature of reality is voidnes transcending
form is emptiness and emptiness is form

holistic unity of everything there is

a total direct becoming of the cosmos
no more difference between the universe and me
