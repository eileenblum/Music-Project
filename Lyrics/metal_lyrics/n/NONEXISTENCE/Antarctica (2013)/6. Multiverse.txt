a vast empty volume
infinity and even more
an endless multitude of different worlds
magnificent opulence of complexity

far beyond the universe
above the cosmic domain
abstract mathematical structures
infinite dimensional space

symmetry breaking of the void
constantly fluctuating nothingness

space is boundless
time is unending
all conditions coexist simultaneously
all events take place
each probability happens now

quintessential heart of reality
the paradox makes everything possible

all is an illusion
a reflection in a hologram
world without an end
eternity repeating itself
