in solitude the twilight dies
when all has gone but memories
the stars exhale their last goodbye
transcend into the depths of nothingness

as the skies fall down
at the end of all
darkness shall prevail
starless aeons

a frozen dark infinity
deserted gloom of vacant galaxies

eternity devoid of light
what lies beyond this emptiness
