a scent of rejection that fails to comfort
and all your lies lay crippled below
weakness was never meant this way
why should I wear this mask of regret

once adored melancholy
now obsessed with misery

delusive affection collapsing within
corrupted emotions reduced to defeat
still there is judgment in your intentions
would you carry the burden of shame

I am freezing
I am falling down

perceiving the absence increasing in me
the sky is even more vacant tonight
a sullen scene of farewell dissolving
who will uncover the shroud of distress
