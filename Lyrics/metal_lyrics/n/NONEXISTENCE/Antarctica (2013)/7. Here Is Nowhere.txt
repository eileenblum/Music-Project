the vaster the sky the colder the world
dead vision transforms into dystopia
mislead by delusive ambitions of perfection
seems like I've lost the path somehow

vacant darkness shrouding everything
endless silence absorbing serenity
frozen vastness turns to emptiness
searing coldness transcending me

lifeless on the shores of a solitude better unknown
deserted wasteland of hopelessness
Antarctic landscapes of my heart

there is a war raging in me
no one never arriving nowhere
can you really imagine nothingness

secluded in this eternal isolation
dissolving into the black voids beyond
distant absence remains imperfect
inert as all is falling apart
