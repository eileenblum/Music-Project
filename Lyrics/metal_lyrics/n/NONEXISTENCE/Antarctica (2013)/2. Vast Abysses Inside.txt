a desolate emptiness is spreading inside
a spiritual blackness that comes from within

finding myself lost in the darkness again
become the abyss that I am staring into

vast abysses inside

I foster the darkness that feasts on me

seasons of grief
aeons in black
darken my spirit and tear me apart

absorbing void
coldness inside
luring abysses of nameless despair
