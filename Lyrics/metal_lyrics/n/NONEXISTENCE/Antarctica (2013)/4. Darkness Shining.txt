the fracture is increasing
dismal void of aeons
prefer isolation
discern the amounts of pain

darkness shining
torn from within

black hole like an exile
echoes from a distance
embrace desolation
bleakness shall consume all

this bitter devotion to emptiness
and I feel more broken than I could confess

no light no life no feeling no mind
no faith no hope no vision no love

detached from existence
eclipse of this blackness
escape to the abyss
dissolution of my inner self
