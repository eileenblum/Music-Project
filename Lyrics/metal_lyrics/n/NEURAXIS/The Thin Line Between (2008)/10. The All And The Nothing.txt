[Lyrics: Tommy Mckinnon, Music: Rob Milley]

A vaporous dawn
Rises above the stormy night
Dark green plain, white steam covered
The mood is right for an insight

Here and now the light awaken
You capture the beams
or so reflect them

Flowing from and through your primal being
An invisible spectrum of colours stems

Length, breadth and depth
The body the soul the mind
Linked by a radical sign

As a string bent to perfect balance
Fundamental tone of exhaustive resonance
As a string bent to perfect balance
Vibrate the all and the nothing

However acumen, no language
Can embed or summarize the absolute

Thus root to the unknown
An intuitive equation...

However acumen, no language
Can embed or summarize the absolute

Thus root to the unknown
An intuitive equation
Which give infinite
An arcane value

The all and the nothing...
As a string bent to perfect balance
Fundamental tone of exhaustive resonance

The all and the nothing...
