[Lyrics: Alex Leblanc, Music: Rob Milley]

Outcast, followed by a plague
A trail of misery is left under his name
Hopeless - Prisoner of a futile universe
Powerless - Alone to confront
the emptiness created from his own self
...until there is nothing left
but frustration and distress

(There is) no such thing as a miracle
The conception of luck is a fraud
In despair, awaits a savior that will simply never come

Failure and the fear to attain it
Corners the mind into a negative state
Defeatist, beaten before the war

Those dreams destroyed by misfortune
The cost of existence upon (such)fragile shoulders
Crushed under the weight of guilt
for terrible events who have yet...to happen

A simple law of cause and effect
Against the odds
Darkness prevails

The curse victorious...once again
A disease so furious...through its reign
Disaster (always) strikes at the worst time

[Solo: Will]

Forever bound to perish
To be consumed by the void
...until there is nothing left
but frustration and distress...

Failure, a vicious trap
The sorrow is unbearable
Destiny, a fatal wrath
The abandon, unavoidable...

A simple law of cause and effect
Against the odds
Darkness prevails
The curse victorious...until the end

There is no such thing as a miracle
The conception of luck is a fraud
