[Lyrics: Tommy Mckinnon, Music: William Seghers]

Sacred allegories
Or mystic idol
Experience and honesty
Transcends the symbol
Global simplicity
Opens all meaning
Quiet individual
So awe-inspiring

Nothing is gained
No one is lost
A basic rule
One has to trust

Over bended men
Sat the tyrants
But now fate is vain
And lies silent

Over hardened hands
Grows up the world
Now senses proclaim
An oracle...

Venture some greed
Like a brassier glows
For certainties
No need of hope
But an antique meed
Promise of old
Sworn by an oak
And the wind blows...

Sacred allegories
Or mystic idol
Experience and honesty
Transcends the symbol
Global simplicity
Opens all meaning
Quiet individual
So awe-inspiring

amongst open minds
will bloom the world
for ones who dare listen
to the oracle inside...
