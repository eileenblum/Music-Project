[Lyrics: Alex Leblanc, Music: Rob Milley, Tommy Mckinnon, William Seghers]

The next level of commitment
Modern challenges to struggle upon
The next stage of dedication
Ambitious crusade that requires strength
And courage...

Destinies merge into one
Gathered by a single cause
Alliance of consciences
Duplicate the intelligence
The assembly of wisdom
Congregation of powers

Through the ashes of the past
A weapon rebuilt
Like a phoenix
Through the flames of devotion
An entity reborn
Like a phoenix eternal
Arises magnificent

All the elements unite to confront oblivion
Conquer the absolute in a radical sound
That echoes intensely through powerful waves
A disturbance of infinity (that) sets the kingdom ablaze

The will to heal and overcome
To improve and achieve perfection
The burning desire to rise
Explore and discover the truth

The next level of commitment
Modern challenges to struggle upon
The next stage of dedication
Ambitious crusade that requires strength
And courage...

Through the ashes of the past
A weapon rebuilt
Like a phoenix
Through the flames of devotion
An entity reborn
Like a phoenix eternal
Arises magnificent

The will to heal and overcome
To improve and achieve perfection
The burning desire to rise
Explore and discover the truth
To learn from the ancients rites
Break the barriers and evolve
