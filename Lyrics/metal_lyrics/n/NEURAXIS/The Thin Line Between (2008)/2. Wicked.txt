[Lyrics: Tommy Mckinnon, Music: Rob Milley, Tommy Mckinnon]

Behold!
For the vision they embrace
And insanity
Shall the negation rise
And ourselves perish!
For it is said!

Reborn, just so to be
No method, no scheme
Shall the negation rise
And ourselves perish!
For it is written!

[Solo: Rob]

Then the machine walked
And the children cried
Over old warm stone
Shattered and half buried
Their bodies lay broken
Covered with dust aside road

Past revolutions
Dressed now of golden unity:
A great, somber, everlasting dye
Given liquid fake to slumber away...

And the children cried
Over old warm stone
Their body lay broken
Whirlwinds of dust
Erode their bones

Given liquid fake to slumber away...
Nature shall prove wrong history!

"Beware!
For revenge they owe you
And anger"

"Shall the righteous hearken the truth!
An epoch shut on itself
A future blurry and a past wrong
These are echoes from running times
And fate rings of a first round
Between despot and rogue
Struggling in their lust
Oblivion and mould..."

Behold!
For the vision they embrace
And insanity
Reborn, just so to be
No method, no scheme

Again soon her smile will crack
The face of the earth
For the machine walks
Paired the oceans
As a set of blue eyes
To swallow their tears
As horror stands up and laughs
Wicked!
