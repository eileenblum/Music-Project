[Lyrics: Alex Leblanc, Music: William Seghers]

Climb the highest peak to consult the great mother
Golden temples are built to access a knowledge beyond

As sacrifice awakens voices from the sky
The beauty of a goddess illuminates those eyes

This is a link
Between nature and the spirit
This is a link
A guide which appears in multiple forms

Words of the wise that inspire the will of men
Ancient prophecies carved through the walls of time

Nightmares as a warning
Of the tragedy to come
Images of the land burning
Millions who suffer through these
Visions of terror
Misery foreseen

Panic at the throne
Blamed as an heretic
Whose theories stands
Defiant to the rules
Instincts against reason
Led into a path forbidden

Instincts against reason
Led into the wrong path
...the future is death

Dreaming the end
Where the world ceases to exist
Fade into a beautiful apocalypse
Ready for the final cleansing

At the last hour
Choices will be made
Destiny in the hands of the blind
Will condemn the fate of our kind
