[Lyrics: Alex Leblanc, Music: William Seghers]

A vision propelled by thoughts
Fused by an ideal that defies reality
A constant fight to remain above
To leave this mark
Those scars to reshape history

Crystal perfect world
Symbol of power shattered in a second
Hidden abomination come to light
As a deviation occurs...

[Solo: Will]

This palace built to fulfill and retain their supremacy
A fortress engineered to reign
But unable to resist temptation

Behold the great collapse
Ultimate chaos unleashed
The beauty of a paradise stained
Almighty prophet engages catastrophe

Blinded by time, praised by numbers
The empire is a techno-logical mockery

Crystal perfect world
Symbol of purity forever black
Poisoned by his own true nature
As a deviation occurs...

[Solo: Rob]
[Solo: Will]

Rising from the dark
Absurd violent dreams
Emerging deviously
Like a psychic renaissance
Naive through storm
Compelled to destroy innocence

Blinded by time, praised by numbers
The entire empire is a mockery
Broken silence, socially awakened
The essence of truth through global discovery

Individual with perfect balance
Suddenly infected
