[Lyrics: Alex Leblanc, Music: Rob Milley]

Idol to many
Monument of strength and authority
Standing vehement
Rational behavior that inspires millions
Concrete statement
Glorious logic

Slowly appealed to the other side
Secretly seduced by the opposite

Versus
A conscience divided
Mentally overflowed
Versus
The structure suffers
Causing a rupture of identity

A simple purpose turned into obsession
Unconscious quest to attain liberation

The structure suffers
Overflowed with possibilities
Versus

It is imminent, reality clashes
Through the mirror, reflects the terror
The truth that lies beneath...

The difference between the light and the darkness
Obscure influence that blinds from the struggle

A choice of two evils, raging war, one against the other
With both paths painted in crimson colors

A violent contrast
The present versus the past
Those abstract images from the future
Confronts the real and the unpure

On the verge of extinction, at the limit of knowledge
All the principles of virtue are engulfed in a void
This unknown reaction, response to the pulse
Empowered by the fall
A total denial of convictions...

[Solo: Rob]

Is this all an illusion??
Is there even a solution???
