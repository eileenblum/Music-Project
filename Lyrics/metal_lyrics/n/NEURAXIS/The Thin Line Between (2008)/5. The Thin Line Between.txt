[Lyrics: Alex Leblanc, Music: Rob Milley]

Enigma of a world untamed
To explore the boundaries of what is known to man
Searching for the balance, a road to a fate uncertain

Fragile equilibrium - Hidden in a subtle disguise
Perfectly crafted to appear solid - A divine mask of conformity

Rules applied in the past, centuries of deceit and masquerade
Has rendered humanity thoughtless, forbidden to evolve

Tormented by the question
A conscience trapped in a maze

The abyss lies before
A mystical vortex of infinite depth
At the edge of unreason
A knowledge blurred
Through a mysterious horizon

Face the obvious, the acceptance of the fact
This universe...devoid of answers
Face the obvious, the acceptance of the fact
The puzzle within, impossible to resolve

This fear of the unknown
Is common for every mortal
An ocean of contradictions
With every waves, darkens
Frozen at the bottom

[Solo: Rob]

Thirst for knowledge
Insatiable desire to comprehend
This quest for truth leads a path unsecure
Dangerously stands at the border of chaos

Paradox at the end of the equation
...The unbreakable wall
Paralysis after a lifetime of reflection
...An endless cycle
Inevitably returns to where it all begins

To stand in the middle
At the origin of the struggle
Where fiction surpasses reality
Enlighted by a dream
The idea that spawns the beast
The thin line between
Genius and maniacal

Enigma of a world untamed
To explore the boundaries of what is known to man
Searching for the balance, a road to a fate uncertain

Fragile equilibrium - Hidden in a subtle disguise
Perfectly crafted illusion to appear solid - A divine mask of conformity

Rules applied in the past, centuries of deceit and masquerade
Has rendered humanity thoughtless, forbidden to evolve

The abyss lies before
A mystical vortex of infinite depth
At the edge of unreason
A knowledge blurred
Through a mysterious horizon

Face the obvious...the acceptance of the fact
This universe, devoid of answers
The puzzle within, impossible to resolve

No words to explain...the splendor of eternity
No images to describe...the horror of infinity

This fear of the unknown
Is common for every soul
Afflicted by solitude
Desperate in the absence of certitude

Thirst for knowledge
Insatiable desire to comprehend
This quest for truth leads a path unsecure
Dangerously stands at the border of chaos

Paradox at the end of the equation
...The unbreakable wall
Paralysis after a lifetime of reflection
...An endless cycle
Inevitably returns to where it all begins

To stand in the middle
At the origin of the struggle
Where fiction surpasses reality
Enlightenment through a dream
The idea that spawns the beast
The thin line between
