[Lyrics: A. Leblanc. Music: R. Milley]

Alone and sleepless
A tangible dream within reach
His obsession grows
The impulse to fulfill
This behemoth of temptation
Far more impressive (and present)
Than the guilt that seems to fade away

Sinister desires... Perversions untold

Only once then it will go away
The urge to dissect
Compelled to obey
This sin to comprehend

Too many questions deform the vision
A world apart, detached from emotions
The thirst above reason
Losing morals and convictions
The act is (finally) done

Awful yet beautiful / attracted by the deed
Horrible and wonderful / mesmerized by the secrets
That the flesh holds

The will becomes the power
Deviance becomes the norm

Broken barrier
A point of no return
Unable to control this envy
That only amplifier with each victim

Superior intellect (and) a flawless lust
Erases the weakness, meticulous through his work

From cult to masterpiece, a perfect crime
Devoid of evidence, respecting the code

Compulsive through discipline
A lack of remorse and apathy
Defines his behavior

(Now a) mysterious figure, cloaked in the shadow
Hiding in the masses, awaiting...
