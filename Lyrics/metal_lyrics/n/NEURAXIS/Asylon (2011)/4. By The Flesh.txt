[Lyrics: A. Leblanc, Music: R. Milley]

This cage, cold and abused
Once was the tool for power
Physical dominance/the means to remain superior
Potential above the common
Focused psychological state
Devoted to a quest/this urge to perform
Exorcise the demons

This ambition within to attain purity
Grown into an enemy/God-like obsession
Immaculate, flawless, and complete
Those efforts to reach this state of perfection
Grown into an entity/godless obsession

Lead through the pulse/confront mortality
A race against time/driven by the flesh
Persevere, the passion and desire
A flame so fierce
Has blurred the path, blinded by the fire
Blinded by the flesh

Suddenly, deception appears as a malformation to the being
Unknown to suffering, the metabolism into crisis
Now a victim of imperfection
The functions no longer respond
Control is lost

Substances deeply infused
To counter this disease
They have yet to comprehend

Machines of science
Weakening the structure
Syndrome of the century

[Solo: Rob]

Unknown to suffering, the mind goes into crisis
This life, so fragile
Hangs by a thread
Awaiting his fate

Destroyer of morals/rebellion of the body
Organic defiance/betrayed by the flesh
