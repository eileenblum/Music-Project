[Lyrics: A. Leblanc, Music: R. Milley]

Incarcerated for future atrocities
Unforgettable crimes not yet committed
Aggressive misfit condemned before birth
Falsely accused, banished from society

Of humanity, he has every sins...
His inability to sustain and express emotions
At a normal rate
Pulverize the very concept
Of good and evil, of love and hate

Hypnotized, paralyzed
Through the horror behind his eyes
Every hope of benevolence dies

Starving lion, trapped in a cage
The angriest beast, a powerful rage... untamed
Unleash the fury
Animal instincts, (a) deadly rampage
The world is the enemy
This planet, the stage

Of humanity, he has every sins
Tattooed on his reptile skin...
Ravaging catharsis
A long-awaited revenge
Violence is bliss
Purging through vengeance
From a supreme injustice
Becoming the danger foreseen
