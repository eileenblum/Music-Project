[Lyrics: A. Leblanc, Music: R. Milley, O. Pinard]

Self-destructive thoughts, alienated from inside
Never-ending trauma, emerging from within
Unconsciously creating a twisted entity
A parallel enigma, only waiting to begin

Acid-like emotions, rage against the structure
The illusion of balance, degrades the conscience
An infectious vermin, feeding on the core
Until there is nothing left to devour

Inception of the plague, loss of precious energy
Corruption of the mind, inversion of personality

Poisonous, malicious: (En)forcing the drama
Treacherous, venomous: Deceiving the karma

Assimilated into darkness
Taste the pale color of misery
Living empty shell
Zombified version of a previous self
Covered in black, the soul has turned
Into an evil form, vicious character

Afflicting the curse to others
Afflicting the curse to others

[Solo: Rob]

The new identity grows, replaces the former
This temptation to surrender, is suddenly stronger
Overwhelmed and terrified, by the force, it slowly dominates
And guides, like a puppet led into demise
Acid-like emotions, control the structure
The illusion of balance is finally escaping
Dropped the mask, killed the armor
Because there is nothing left to devour... left to devour

...At the end, there is nothing left to devour...
Left to devour
