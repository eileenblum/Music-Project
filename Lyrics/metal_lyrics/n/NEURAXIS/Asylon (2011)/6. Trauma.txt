[Lyrics: A. Leblanc, Music: R. Milley]

This trauma, severe shock from the past
A moment that changed his world
Unexplainable history
A character cursed... for the worst

This is the fall of confidence/(the) annihilation of trust
The rise of decadence/a point where reality is lost

Destroyed by anxiety
Completely crushed... by the guilt

This mind is a prison filled with deadly illusions
Depression slowly kills the conscience
Surrounded by images, haunted by the voices
Misconception, impossible to escape
Tormented vision, engulfed into a realm of despair

Failure of the soul/distortion of the psyche

Perpetual darkness, a sky forever black
Everlasting sadness, omnipresent obscurity
Following the path to insanity

This trauma, a blood-stained memory
A terrible event, so tragic
Several versions conflicting
This paradox morphing behavior

Pathological sickness, a final invasion
Eradicating all forms of previous beliefs

Paranoid, against all things
A fatal plunge
Driven by conspiracy
Mankind becomes the enemy
Rehabilitation is futile
Unaffected by therapy
A psychological wound that will never heal...
