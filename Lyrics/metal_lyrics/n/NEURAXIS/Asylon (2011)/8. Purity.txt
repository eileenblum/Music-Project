[Lyrics: A. Leblanc, Music: R. Milley]

Drowning in a sea of doubts
Swallowing the vile relentlessly
An attempt to escape reality
Through smoke and mirror, the failure
Facing true self, twisted behavior

A pain so strong the source of the madness
Inverted process of recovery
The will so weak feeling powerless
A constant nightmare
Driven by this dream of purity...

Without control over his sickness
Taking its toll, hopeless and senseless
Without control, tempted to degrade
Constant abuse, slave to the cancer within

Behind the addiction
Ashamed and rejected
Beyond the fear
Of one day being forced to purify
Purity... through therapy

Despite the consequences
A recurring compulsion
An harmful decadence
Despite the suffering
Unable to counter the curse

Never ending despair
Eternal distress

[Solo: Rob]

Excruciating obsession
An impulsive disorder rages on...
Rules by the laws of chaos
A vicious cycle of defeat
Entangled in a web
Forever caught

A pain so strong
The source of the madness
Impossible to attain this state of purity
