[Lyrics: A. Leblanc, Music: R. Milley]

Confined into a cell / a faded glimpse of hope
The cold metal shines / and the walls are too close
An aura suffocates / through the fog, breathes heavily
Prisoner of his fate / remembering the tragedy

Alone, destructive imagination that once created dreams
Morphs the world into nightmare, replacing reality

Perception of time, lost into the dark
Persistence of this chaos, left a fatal mark
Psychotic obscurity covers the horizon
In perpetual tyranny, slave to the horror

Piece by piece, ascending / a tower of dementia
Arises without end / building delirium
Eternally descending / an infinite fall
Reveals the impossible... escaping the asylum
...the asylum

Feeble ray of light, reflecting the guilt
Scarred hands reaching the unreachable
By despair captive, primitive and chained
Sacred minds breaching the unbreachable

Through solitary hell / hopeless and deranged
Frozen in denial / claustrophobia in a cage
The aura suffocates / at the last breath, realizes
(He is the) prisoner of his faith
A tragic memory

Screaming afar like a distant misery
Tormented whispers crying a dismal melody
Those dreaded voices / in the  depth, resonate
In a final praise to liberate
But they only decimate...

...the sanity that struggles to remain
Alone, blame the shadow
Confront the enigma / entrapment of the soul

Perception of time, lost in the dark
Persistence of this chaos, has left a fatal mark
Psychotic obscurity covers the horizon
In perpetual tyranny, slave to the other self...

Piece by piece, ascending / a tower of dementia
Arises without end / building delirium
Eternally descending / an infinite fall
Reveals the impossible... escaping the asylum
...the asylum

A universe reduced to nothing
Immensity so small
Existence... existence without life
