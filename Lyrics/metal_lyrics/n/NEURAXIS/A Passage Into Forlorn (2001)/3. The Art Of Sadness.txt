Torn into isolation
Sorrow carves its art
Deep... deep into my flesh
Never healing scars

Solitude arises
Casts a wicked grin
Like a serpent it coils
It coils me from within

Stare into nothingness
My soul come undone

... The art of sadness...

Stare into the eyes of sadness
A thousand dying suns
By a sculture of demise
Envisionned in sorrow's dreams
By a sculture of demise
Envisionned in sorrow's dreams
Re-shaped again through his eyes
Re-shaped again through his eyes

The art of sadness, etched into my soul
The art of sadness, etched into my soul
The art of sadness, etched into my soul
