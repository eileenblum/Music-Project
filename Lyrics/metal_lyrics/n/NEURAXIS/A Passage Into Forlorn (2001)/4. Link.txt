Link of innocence...
Imagine a link to all humans
The one who's bounded to our life...

See the chains.. cycle path... a fragment is deteriorating

Time, the hint is unsealed, noxious mind
Eminent forlorn trade between and his guiltless force
The new born child at the height of innocence
Time, the hint is unsealed, noxious mind

Private mistrust, arrogance. Power, hatred for an entire lies
Time, the hint is unsealed, noxious mind

Link of innocence... of innocence. Link of innocence
Grab the heart of a shadow's light and see deep in this sight
Link of innocence... of innocence. Link of innocence
Vacan soul reflecting the evil plan is confused

Decreased as the age increased, the offspring's power is gone
And the parts of a child dies
What will they say? The offspring's power gone

To disapear if it's seen.
Missive informer watching the exit of lies
A fragment is deteriorating, see the chain
This cycle path

The one who's bounded to our life
Imagine a link to all humans
