Desultory fuels the weak, the crutch for the deadening
Emotionless stare, grind... grind. Defy, strive to attain

Silence the myth, persevere to gain

Blind the vision that shatters dreams. Invert dead faith into victory
Blind the vision that shatters dreams. Invert dead faith into victory

Fear guides the weakened mind. Blind slaughter the blind
Fear guides the weakened mind. Blind slaughter the blind
Fear guides the weakened mind. Fear guides the weakened mind

Scarred spirit, faded dream, reflections of the past
Scarred spirit, faded dream, reflections of the past
