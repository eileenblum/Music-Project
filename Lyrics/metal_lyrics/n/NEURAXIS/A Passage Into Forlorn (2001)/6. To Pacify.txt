Betrayer.. it seema you didn't get enough of my generosity

Denial.. refuse to admit the moment of abuse you took upon me
Resign... the facts about your actions that
defy... the limit of diplomacy

Gain the attention to derive everything from the truth, to advantage

Hypocrit method of dellusion. Mediocre diversion
Seek to appropriate, whatever advantage needed

Twisted way of accusing the other. To avoid being suspected and judged
By accusing the other with twisted ways
You avoid being suspected and judged

Gain the attention, to pacify those you mislead and manipulated
