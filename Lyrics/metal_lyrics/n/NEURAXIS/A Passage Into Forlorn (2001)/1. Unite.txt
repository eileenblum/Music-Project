Thought with memory
A lost wisdom, an endless chapter
Condemned to a long awaiting
Recalled through electric dementia
Upon the calling, to confront... unite
A dead circuit, static laughter is waiting
Created through to process, upon the waiting
To confront... unite

Torn within my heart and my soul from disgrace
Schizophrenia is terrifying me

Paradise: an exit to my soul

My fabulous holliness, upon the waiting
Sudden and waiting... blind

Re-awaken then, a fabulous holliness
Sustains and calling the misery... god

Psychological intensity, condemned
To a long awaiting
Severed by blades of cold dormancy

To front the waiting, come on... unite

Wisdom pure. Condemned to a long awaiting
Into a nightmare, trancends time
Upon a calling, confront... unite

A war within my cries, thy cyborg marionettes
My favorite holliness, slaves are waiting
Modulation to the grind

A war within my cries, thy cyborg marionettes
Upon this fighting
Evolution to the grind
