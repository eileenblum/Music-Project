Afraid of somebody, afraid of something
Subtle cabal, so organized and interlocked
Denying with their lips what they do with their hands
Theistic - Elitists
Endlessly feared and murmured against, it found no opposition anywhere
Influence the ideals and behavior of world core
Spoliate all existing culture by consent or conquest
Coercive segregation
Consensus for one polar power
The silence is deafening
Elitists - Theistic
