The Universal, the Ultimate, the Absolute
The wholehearted desire, in progressive conformity
By the body, by the mental, by the spirit
The logical devotion
Experience of the divine ideals
Spherical application of the incarnation
Infinite progression in three phases
Definite by the splendor of compassion
