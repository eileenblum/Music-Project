Wisdom is the apex of intellectual performances
The chief pursuit for a better understanding
The comprehensible elements of Deity - Truth, beauty, goodness
Absorbed in the study of the philosophy of cosmology
The alliance of contrasts, the drama of unification of the vastness
Hence materialism, atheism, is the maximation of ugliness
The meaningful rhythms of all human experience
Embrace the sense of ethics and morality
Experienced perfection - hunger
The recognition implies a mind of moral status, a mind with ability
The possession of greatness is the measure of real divine attainment
