Zenith of power, highest point of glory
The Alpha, the Omega, the Principle and the End
Geometric complex, cosmologic concept
Culminate, like a pyramid ends in a point
Unfathomable distances, vastness revealed
Out of nothing comes nothing
Abstract equations
The statement of anthropic assumption
Theoretical prediction
Relatively trivial, watered-down form
New level of resonance
Nucleosynthesis calculation
Temporal cycles, hidden melody of the stellar regulations
