Increase your burden, decrease the results, by taking yourself too seriously
When you feel important - Energy is lost
The work is primordial - The self is not
Self-glorification - Ridiculous
Exalted ego - Caricature
Even verging on the humorous, it is the divine antidote
Tear of dignity - Exhausted the feeble
Tempted to magnify - A prank
