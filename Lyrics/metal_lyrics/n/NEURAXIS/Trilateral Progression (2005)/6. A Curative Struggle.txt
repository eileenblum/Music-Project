Evolutionary world
Antagonisms are natural, only secured by steadiness
Confronted with the task of regulations
War is the heritage of evolving man, peace is the yardstick measuring advancement
Reaction to irritations, conciliation attends upon the solution
Warfare persists because man is human, evolved from an animal, and all animals are bellicose
Ancient ones regarded it a virtue to shed alien blood
A strong medicine, very costly
Curative of certain disorders - Breaks the society
Imposed discipline
A premium on fortitude
Fostered nationalism
Annihilating the weak and the unfit
Dissolved the illusion of equality and stratified organization
Olden wars strengthened nations - Resulted in decimation of the inferiors
Modern struggles disrupt culture
Modern conflict is selective destruction
The conquests of science, and social achievement - Discovering a leader
