Fucked for life
Consequencial events
Father just abused me
Mother you never loved me!

I abhore the very thoughts of my parents
I've often questioned the reasons of my being
Why was I brought into existence
Shackled down never to be

I abhore the very thought of my parents
I've often questioned the reason of my being
Shackled down never to be
Maybe then I'll set myself free
