Sadness fills this empty void
Feeling bitter for this loss
Depression fills the vacant slot
I know that you are gone

Could this have been averted?
Death- intricate beyond compare
Why is it so hard to accept?
I can't believe your gone

Ascended into heaven?
Where are you know?
Your soul will remain immortal
In our hearts, you'll never die!

I ponder daily
Why did you have to die?
So much shit walks the earth
Why did you have to die?

Do you look over us from time to time?

What was the justification?
Your mortal body was massacred
Your celestrial body will reign
Was death your purpose in life?
