Animated, sequantisised and computerized
through a blinding winds of avidity
Synthetised, robotized and dehumanized
hybriding flesh with technology

Relapse of a lecherous humanity
Contemptuous cupidity
Rigor sustains charity
mass degradation almost completed

Eulogized, neurologised...ascetisised
a world emaciated by malevolence
Materialised, idealised...monopolised
violate greed and senses

Unto the surviving humanity
...the final epitaph
Caustic depression of avidity
the cyberwar is coming
Countdown to imminent annihilation
Effluvium of cupidity
Dreary hopes of emptiness
cyberwar is the answer
