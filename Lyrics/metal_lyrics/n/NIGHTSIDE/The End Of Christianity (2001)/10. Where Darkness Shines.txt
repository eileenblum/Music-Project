Satan, take me on your blackened wings
Crucify the so-called lord for his sins
Take me to the other side of reality
Dark valleys of hate and bestiality

Show me invisible horizons
Where dawn no more rises
Baptize me in blood to die
Where eternal darkness shines

Take me to be a part of your evil joy
Prince of  Darkness, hailed by sinister black choirs
Place filled with sorrow, death and decease
A world beyond my darkest fantasies

Show me invisible horizons
Where dawn no more rises
Baptize me in blood to die
Where eternal darkness shines

Show me invisible horizons
Where dawn no more rises
Baptize me in blood to die
Where eternal darkness shines
