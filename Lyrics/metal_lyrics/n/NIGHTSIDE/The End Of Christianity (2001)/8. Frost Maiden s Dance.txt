As cold wind comes forth from the woods of ever mist
The light fades away with the winds of north
From the father of all nights and mother of north
Was bred the seeds of maiden of cold

A maiden of frost clad in wintry shadows
Skin of pale blue and hair of snow white
With chants and spells she summons the frost
Creating the snow that covers the ground

The frozen wind blows sweeping the land
Great white plains, like huge glaciers
Frost Maiden's dance leaves her marks
The age of ice has arrived
