We wear the color of the night
We are the crushers of the light
We are clad metal and leather
We are the warriors of demon metal

Demon metal! Demon blood!
Demon metal! We are of demon blood!
Demon metal! Demon blood!
Demon metal! We are of demon blood!

We carry the flag of blasphemy
Desecrate the virgins with sodomy
We re-crucify Jesus-Whore
We reign here evermore!

As long as I will breathe
There is Satan's blood in me
We are demons in human form
You are the ones whom we scorn

Demon Metal!

Demon metal! Demon blood!
Demon metal! We are of demon blood!
Demon metal! Demon blood!
Demon metal! We are of demon blood!
