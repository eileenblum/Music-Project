A fog so black lies over the earth
Veiling the sun in it's abysmal beauty
In this darkness all life perished
Waters froze and the ground covered in snow

Monumental statues of ice in the horizon
That once were blooming fields and woods
Now all withered and chained in frost
The winds blow from the cold north

Only the mightiest ones dwelt on this plane
The solemn black figures...The sons of the gods

They who once reigned have stepped down
Into the cold soil from the heavens
Forces flow from the cosmos
Dawn of  winter everlasting and black

Motionless shapes float above the seas
Black monuments of darkness...

Once again the sun shall be evoked to burn
But not to light the earth with warmth
A black sun shall it be
And creatures of darkness shall embrace it!
