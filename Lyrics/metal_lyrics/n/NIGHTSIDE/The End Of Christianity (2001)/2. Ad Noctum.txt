When the spirits of dark take over my soul
I feel the night is alive
As I walk under the full moon my inner darkness shall
arise
The ancient ones who ruled the earth will be released
tonight
Night everfrozen, evercold
The strongest evil shows it's signs

Gates will open, blood will flow
It's time for total war
Disciples of light are praying for the one who is here
no more
My devotion to Lord in darkness is now eternal and
strong
As my visions are taking me to the truth
I see all I've been taught is wrong

Burning shadows, frozen souls
Burned witches at their thrones

"This night will be the final one for those who oppose
the return of the darkened kingdom
Ones who have been true to the Prince of Darkness
shall now be rewarded
Age of darkness will arise from the depths of
underworld and shall prevail now and for all times
after..."

Frozen earth, burning souls
Bow ye all Lord Satan's throne
See again the christ crucified
By the lords of the nightside

In the glaze of the burning heaven I see the armies
arrive
Angels of darkness, legions in black
Warriors of the evil side
The seven gates have now been opened to bring the
eternal fire
Mountains of flesh, lakes of blood
Fulfill my dark desires

Now I'll face the eternal winter
The sun has burned from the sky
Satan's reign is here at last
Now watch as Jesus dies, see the beauty of crimson
mist
The end of christianity
What they never could believe now became reality
Ad Noctum...
