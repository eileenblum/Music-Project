When the shadows veil the pale soil
And the sun falls behind horizon
While the hovering fog thickens 
Over the northern darkwoods

In this sunless period of time
We hail our Dark Lord
Rise four demons of Satan
Rise from the eternal night

Time has come for plague and war
Time has come for famine and death
Rise four demons of Satan
The devil is on our side

In this sunless period of time
We hail our Dark Lord
Rise four demons of Satan
Rise from the eternal night

The bringers of death and devastation
Now rise from the bowels of hell
To swallow the sun and light:

To bring forth the darkness
and the life-draining cold
None shall be spared!

We are the horde of the horned one
We rise from the deepest night
We are the legion of Satan
and we rise to kill, we rise to WAR!!!
