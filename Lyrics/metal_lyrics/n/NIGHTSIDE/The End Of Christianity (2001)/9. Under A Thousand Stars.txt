On a chilly shadowy winter eve
Into the skies I lay my sight
Beyond the distant sea
The horizon lit up in flames

Under a thousand stars...On the sight of the elder gods
Gathered to embrace us...The faithful men of north

Those howling winds, on stormwinds I ride 
Higher into the heavens opened
Black kingdoms of the thousand stars
Black kingdoms, thousand stars

Those vast landscapes
The dance of those burning flames
The snow falling to the ground
And the night is covered in burning red

Under a thousand stars...On the sight of the elder gods
Gathered to embrace us...The faithful men of north

Those howling winds, on stormwinds I ride 
Higher into the heavens opened
Black kingdoms of the thousand stars
Black kingdoms, thousand stars

On a windy mountainside
In chambers of the twilight
And upon the frozen peaks
The heart of the north lies so silent

Under a thousand stars...On the sight of the elder gods
Gathered to embrace us...The faithful men of north

Those howling winds, on stormwinds I ride 
Higher into the heavens opened
Black kingdoms of the thousand stars
Black kingdoms, thousand stars
