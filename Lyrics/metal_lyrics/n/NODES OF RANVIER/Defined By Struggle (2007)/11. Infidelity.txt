Worthless and insincere - our vows
so quickly disappear.
Desolation we've brought willingly
We are the harlots spreading infirmity.
Surrounded by mountains of affliction
Stumble blindly in the darkness we create.
Worship the counterfeit.
We dig our own grave with pride.

We're lead astray, our minds decay.
The heart descends into depravity.

Condemned by unfaithfulness - betrayed
beliefs we professed.
Deceived by false desire - we sing
with illusion's deadly choir.
We moved the boundaries of morality
and silenced that still small voice inside.
Screaming with arrogance
We can't hear wisdom screaming back.

We're lead astray, our minds decay.
The heart descends into depravity.

Abomination fills the earth.
Descend.

Judgement must fall - His arm will find us all
We cry - Mercy - Forgive disloyalty
