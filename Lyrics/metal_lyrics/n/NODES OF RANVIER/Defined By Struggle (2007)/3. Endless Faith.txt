My God, my God, Heavenly Father!
I feel forsaken.
Disgrace and shame consume me.
Eternal night now reigns.
Daylight engulfed by shadows,
I pray to end this agony.

[Chorus:]
Gone, everything I loved, just a memory.
Stripped of every ounce of self-respect
fall to my knees.
Cover me in ash, curse the day that I was born.
Release me from this living death, welcome oblivion.

My friends they offer only cruel indifference.
You did this to yourself,
now you must pay the consequence.
I can't believe how fast companions turn their back
Another cruel reminder nothing ever lasts...
It's gone...

[Chorus]

You give and take away
Blessed be Your name.
I cannot comprehend all the workings of Your hand
But still I will wait, hold fast to endless faith.
Overwhelmed and torn apart but never abandoned
When it seems that all is gone.

[Chorus]

Hold fast!!  With confidence!!
Overcome your doubt with endless... faith.
Conquer.  Prevail.
