Battered.  Broken.  But not afraid.
I've seen prosperity, I've tasted defeat.
Blow by blow I've watched this world
CRUSH MY DREAMS.
Merciless and cruel, never satisfied.
I've seen the days ahead,
they promise my demise.
Battered and broken but not afraid.
But I watch promises of perfection,
fading faster everyday.
Tragedy and loss make up this cold reality.
Our lives are defined by struggle
Discover truth in every trial.
Moving forward through the pain.
Battered and broken but not afraid.
STRENGTH TO ENDURE.
Strength to endure, this life will be restored.
Eternal battle
but there is calm within this storm.
Storm.  Raging on.
Battered.  Broken.  But not afraid.
Our lives are defined by struggle.
Discover truth in every trial.
Moving forward through the pain.
Battered and broken but not afraid.
Battered and broken, but this life will be restored.
RESTORED!!!
