With all the choises we must make
I can't see where we went astray
And if the truth is to much to hear
I'm just a mere satellite away
Just tell me everything
Although you may not see me
Please just know I'm still wondering where you are
Things may never be the same, but I still breathe
Please just trust me, I've been down this road before
You know it's funny how time flies
I've lost track of the days
Remember all the times?
We thought we owned the world
Once again I'm in too deep
So come and walk with me, I wanna hear your demons speak
Come sit down with me, I wanna see the scars they leave
So some come and walk with me, I wanna hear your demons
