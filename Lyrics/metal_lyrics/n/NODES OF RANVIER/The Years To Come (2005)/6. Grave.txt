Where is the man who came around?
I pulled him down, I pulled him down
Where is the man who drank then drowned?
I pulled him down, I pulled him down, I pulled him down
Drown with me, drown with me
The times of change are here my friend
There's no before they've always been, but counting down the days till end
We're feeling low we can't let go
Where is the man who came around?
I pulled him down, I pulled him down
Where is the man who drank then drowned?
I pulled him down, I pulled him down, I pulled him down
Drown with me, drown with me
I can't unbleed my angel
