Here's to your interrogation of the way we choose to be.
And here's to my examination of your false prophet heresy.
The work of idle minds. Those who claim no mistakes.
Will of the anti-Christ. Driving the mutiny.
So many souls truly worth saving.
As they're moved aside they know what you're fearing.
You alone push them away.
They become a waste of time as you segregate them.
So afraid to fall.
With a closed mind and your set ways, won't waste your energy.
You alone push them away, they don't believe the same.
They must be evil? Oh, God! It's getting dark.
We've lost light, so hard to see.
