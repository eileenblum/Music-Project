Can you still be moved by song or are you too far gone?
It's all there but I refuse to believe the negativity will tear away you life
Unanswered questions continue clogging sight they'll never cease
They'll chew you up, they'll spit you out, leave you for dead
Cuts more than skin deep, shadows have been cast on us
Lifeless and barely breathing, something is around us spreading like disease
So will you fight the feeling?
But words won't make you understand
The good of everything, won't wait for you to bend, start again
It's far beyond me, where pessimists find pride
But above all things, but above all things
That words cannot express, cannot express
The greatest gift we bear, the ability to change
