In a world that preys on weakness and feeds on self esteem
We'll eat you alive
We will destroy the wall that separates these things that keep you lying awake
Watching you fade, you slowly slip away
Why do you hesitate?
Dark days they always go, know nothing is truly what it seems
So why are you fueling the flame of your self-hatred
Aim your hate at me the end of you predisposition
Relive one time and forget your past is no part of your future
See that there's nothing but to fear
In attempting to control what can't be controlled
Seek the key that is freedom, embrace life
My hands are tied but I won't watch you
Fall farther and farther from the line you know too well
I never could stand to see you down
I never could
They will eat you alive
We will destroy the wall the separates these things that keep you lying awake
Watching you fade, you slowly slip away
You slip away the end of your predisposition
Relive one time and forget the past is no part of your future
Don't waste time, forget
Find your strength, find strength in faith
