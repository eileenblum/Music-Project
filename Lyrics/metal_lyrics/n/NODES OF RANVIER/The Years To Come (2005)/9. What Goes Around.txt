You can't miss the weakness in your eyes
A train of thought uncompromising
Seeking a life of perfection
Crushing all those in your way
You think you deserve every little thing you are craving
Give it up you will never have it
You can't miss the weakness in your eyes
A train of thought uncompromising
And when you lay your head down at night
How does sleep ever find you?
You've underminded all those that paved your way
Trying so hard to be everything, you don't even know yourself
How can you live with yourself?
You don't even know yourself
Now nothing is all you have left
I wish we could've made you see
That you don't have to change to please
One day you'll regret this
A familiar face, now no longer exists made your bed sleep
