Look into this heart the only part of me that's still in tact
From hates supremacy moment for moment, I breathe life
It tastes so bitter sweet the child's face staring back at me
What will she grow to be?
There's no debating we consume more than we create
Though love is never ending, all we have and hope for lies in what's ahead
We could walk a million miles
We could search but we will never find,
It's in the years to come
We're walking the fine line, we can search but we won't find
It's in the years to come
Look at this heart the only part of me that's still in tact
The loves instilled in me
Another sunrise it begins a new day shows its face
The child's name is on my soul engraved means more than everything
Unpredictability, overthrown those moments of beauty
Keeps hope and love alive
All we have and hope for lies in what's ahead
When this man is old and gray with a chance to look back on it all
He did all he can, ready to take the fall
And if the sun sets as promised, we'll come to accept that we are
The little love that's left inside us, we are
If that sun never sets, no time for regrets, never sets
