Salvation, Salvation.
Ignore all my destiny.
Signals are not clear.
Go on the way I am burning pit of sin.
I held no power on my knees as Your vision of change hung over me.
Your light broke the silent skies
and tears of angels created a warm storm and my heart broke...
Like the cleaning of the clouds.
Arise oh God, tell me it's not too late.
Hold me, guide me, love me.
I look to you Jesus:Christ.
