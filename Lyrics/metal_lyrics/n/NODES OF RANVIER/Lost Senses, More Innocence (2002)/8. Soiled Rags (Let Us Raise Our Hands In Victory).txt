What did I do to you.
To you, what did I do.
My brothers through and through never meant to do you no harm.
All I wanted was to be your friend, until the end.
Blood scabs.
You punish me (and my feet slowly sink into the mud.)
Blood soaked rags tell many stories and opening
and examining theme heeds a nightmare.
For I am reminded of broken bonds and the loss of strength
and when the blood dries will these conditions remained solid forever,
'cause I never thought I'd see you go.
We can only do so much on our own,
but hand in hand we can accomplish many things.
So when you tore us apart and never told me...
how could I have known.
'Cause I wrapped you (this relationship) with soiled rags
(soaked in the stench of the beast.) only one choice,
together (like brothers) we must come together (like sisters)
let us raise our hands together.
Let us raise our hands in victory.
