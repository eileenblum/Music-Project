I wanna dance and I want to see blood.
Dance and we're going to see pain.
Written on the face of my innocent child
(as he discoveries the mysteries of life at too young an age.)
Oh what the world looks like:without Your light.
As I stared at the cold picture on the TV
my legs were suddenly stripped of diseases
while my peers looked on in hopelessness.
I couldn't help but rise with ideas of celebration for the end is near.
(Take us all home.)
Now we all see Your light, Your power
(as I thought I was viewing the end of the world.)
I wanna go home 'cause I can't wait.
Is that a safe place 'cause I want to go home.
Take your people home.
Do you wanna dance and celebrate?
Raise a glass.
