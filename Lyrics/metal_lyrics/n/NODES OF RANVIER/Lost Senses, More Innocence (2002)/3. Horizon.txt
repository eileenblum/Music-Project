Lay your burden aside.
Put your hand in mine (and pray that tomorrow will bring sunshine.)
For no one can overcome alone.
Hands of hope touch no fear (and hearts with God need no fear.)
You've got to stand up tough when the moments rough,
you've got to answer quick.
Though your stomachs sick, I'll never find a way to You.
I'm gonna find a way to you.
