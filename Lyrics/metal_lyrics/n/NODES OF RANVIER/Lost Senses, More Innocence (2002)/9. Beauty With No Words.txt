Step into the snow.
Seeking Your starry eyes.
Glisten white with purity (blind me.)
Shine brightly.
Blinding beauty with no words (a painting of my senses.)
Show me something so beautiful, but reveal it to my soul alone.
Lost senses, more innocence.
(Take everything Father, but leave me with more.)
