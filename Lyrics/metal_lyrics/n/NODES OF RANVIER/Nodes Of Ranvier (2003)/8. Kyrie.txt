Awoke today with no new ideas
But that's nothing new
And as I grow old only one thing does not
For love you are the one I choose
So I wish you would know that you are so beautiful
Our love I will continue to be post modern
It will take more than six feet of earth to seperate this love
And so forever I am yours.
