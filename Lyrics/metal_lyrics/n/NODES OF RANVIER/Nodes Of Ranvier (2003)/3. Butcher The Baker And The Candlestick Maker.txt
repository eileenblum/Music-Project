With your father's blood on your lap and your young hands at the wheel,
You drove your father to safety after he made such a messy mistake
And your mother's constant abuse must haunt you like a ghost on your back,
And delivering that blow to her face (must have been) precious and painful
I feel so privileged you share your heart with me
I know you are on a journey and search as you should
(You've been to hell and back)
I just pray you find what you are looking for,
and sweep the rock from the light
But know, I will always be here for you
