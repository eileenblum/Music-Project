Break out the best china
Another one passed on today and his contribution is now etched in time
But I wonder...
What were his last words to his family
"I'm sorry I'm so selfish
I'm sorry I won't be here for you
I'm sorry a small metal spike owns me"
Oh Opiate, Oh Revolver
(where would i be without the two of you)
Rest in peace, another dead rock star.
