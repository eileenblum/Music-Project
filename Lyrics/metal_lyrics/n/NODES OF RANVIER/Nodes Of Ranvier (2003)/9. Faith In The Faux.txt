You have to be kidding me
It must be buried three inches deep
and no one is here to help dig it out
And, I am not suprised because they will no doubt take your word
("Everyone loves juicy gossip")
So I guess I'll just sleep it off (On my stomach of course)
And whenI see you next Ill kill you with a smile
