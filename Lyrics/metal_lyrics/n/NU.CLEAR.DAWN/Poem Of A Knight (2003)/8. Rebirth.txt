Finally I'm here in the place I've grown
I feel myself rebirth again
The place I used to be
The doors I used to see
Are wide open greeting me

And asking me to climb the stage again
Just to hear my voice filling inside
And sing...

Now my voice will break the silence
With a song full of proud and arrogance
And sing...

Here's my song, My blood my wounds my love
And here's my story, the road to the light
It's my last time to sing
After the show I'll leave
This world at all
But even if I'm gone
Forever I will stay

Thanks to chizovrenia, shant for sending these lyrcs.
