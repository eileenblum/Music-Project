I open my eyes under this holy ceiling
Back from my dream drowned into a deep sea
It took my time away, I thought that I have died
They took my life away, and made my body tied 

Then there was a merciful hand covering my face
She was Anna holding me like a mother
Whispering, your not the only one who has honor
Anna, I thought that I've died
But when I saw you I felt the truth 
And left all the fears behind

Feel my soul on the edge of time
My wounds are torturing me so hard
I think that I reached the end
And for the next generation my end will be their start 
I don't want to die here, take me home take me home
To the place that I've born and grown

I want to be on stage again 
For the last time in the place I've born
On stage I ever dreamed to die

The angels are holding me 
Gathered in Anna's hand
Like the birds they are always free

On stage, take me home
It will witness my last stand 
I don't want to die here
Wounded
