When honor lays wounded
And falcons are aiming
From distance we'll come
In freedom we're armed and our swords
With our blood till we have dignity

With every blowing wind
Spreading our wings
Flying away
Flying away
Sun shines over us
Sending it's forces
Along the way
Along the way

It will be revolution
No one will suffer no more
The only solution
Is to play on the strings of the war
It will be revolution

Revenge has exploded
In their minds intended
And their children became 
The hands of our glory
Keep rising above their fathers spears

Our hero Luis pacified to the behavior
Made up his mind to join the forces
Defeating the power of love 
turned from an opera singer to a knight
walking on the edge where he's trying to 
Face Anna's father for his only love 

Women are waiting guarded in their homes
While soldiers are sharpening their metallic swords
The atmosphere of war is keeping us quiet in place
Ashes to ashes and dust to the dust 

It will be revolution
No one will suffer no more
The only solution
Is to play on the strings of the war
It will be revolution
