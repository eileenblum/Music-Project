Misery
Runway free, we are on our rebellion
We are riding the horses of steel
To find the reason for the peace of the world
Holding the armor of God runway free

I've been a knight of distant future
I've been the last of seven troopers
It's time for freedom and face the lord
I came here for the century war

A thousand knights left their homes
On top of the hill with high wind
Unknown places, unknown faces
Are they enemy, or brave strangers?

Assassin from hell, spears from knights
Distant miles what kind of arena
It's getting hard to detect what I see

Images speaks louder than words
While rainy spears covered the skies
We're under siege, we'll break the walls
We're riding the horses of steel

Weak shadows screaming in pain
Asking God to show mercy
Red cloudy skies above 
Where nobles seek their faith
Holding their arms are great killers
And never stop the flame

We're running around where others laid dead
Hearing voices crying elsewhere
Still have the power to reach victory
Never surrender, better die peacefully

There's blood draining deep inside
That's too hard to weep away
I have no strength to stay awake
My head touched the ground, laid on her hands.
