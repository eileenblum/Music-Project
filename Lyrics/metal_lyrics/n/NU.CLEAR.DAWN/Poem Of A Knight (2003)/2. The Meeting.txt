The day has come to carry two hearts
Of Luis and Anna where love will start
And the meeting declared the birth of a man
A handsome knight with a heart like a saint

Showing power, while his shadow fall off
As he found his way through the crowd
To face Anna in the party that night
Sky blessed colliding them in love

Closer and closer they've been
Dancing and dancing as the orchestra plays
Closer and closer they've been
Dancing and dancing as the orchestra plays

He carried her upon his wing and fly to the moon
Where love is real and romance is pure ... And said
Anna I love you how I wish to hide you
In my heart you made me feel the truth

She was wearing a crimson ring
Her magical eyes made a shine on her face
Their dance has taken them to a ride on the wind
Noise of the crowd covered by their laughter

A glazed look from deep inside her eyes
Took Luis away to an endless journey
A ride to reveal the depth of eternity

Closer and closer they've been
Dancing and dancing as the orchestra plays
Closer and closer they've been
Dancing and dancing as the orchestra plays

Those dark eyes were gazing
An evil mind scene drawing
Spreading his wings over every corner
Kiss in the wind that whispers murder

The dark moon painted the skies
Surrounded by Echoes from unknown places
Gravity in the air filled the fortress
Their love affair odyssey has started restless

Love is never ending story written by tears
That dropped from the eye of every lover
They did not realize that rules prevent them to stay
And may be the wind will blow against their faces

There's no time to stay
Its time for tears to drop and fade away
