Finally I'm on the road to my home
Fallen into deep imaginations
The sound of the horse's steps is ringing in my ears
While Anna is washing my face with her tears

Laying in a complete darkness unconscious
All that I recall are images of tragedy
All my friends have been killed by the Falcon
Laid there on the hot sand, forever to sleep

Mama when she told me be careful son
I said don't worry, someday I'll return to you
I can still hear her voices repeating in my head
This is the ride to your way 

Those voices are spinning inside me
Trying to heal the wounds in my soul
Their sound is helping me to stay awake
And live my last memories on the road

The end of the story is reaching soon
The pages are fading away
Reading under the bright silver moon
It's the final chapter , blood on my hands

Laying in a complete darkness unconscious
All that I recall are images of tragedy
All of my friends have been killed by the Falcon
Laid there on the hot sand, forever to sleep

This is you beside me
Save me, from the crow's eyes
Raining day, longing to that holy place
Where angels cry

I can see the lights
Screaming through the sky
They can give me more
Power strength and love 
It was the dawn of the miracles
The final destination
A wet smile I had got wider
As the house of lights got higher 

Those candles are lighting inside me
Trying to keep my body warm
Their heat is helping me stay awake
And live my last memories on the road
