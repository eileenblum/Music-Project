So I drove on that road trying to hear myself
Something weird in the air as I flashed through the miles
All at once like a ton of bricks the sound came crashing down
On the top of destruction four demons burned on high

I can't believe I thought someday that I could clear my name
The beasts saw it in my eyes the stare of a milion kills
As it stormed through the air killing from on high
With a single note they brought up hell and crashed the heavens down

We'll bring it unto thee
Cracking to the sky
Eyes of fear die this night
Only Metal survives
We'll bring it unto thee
Cracking to the sky
Electric spears lead the hunt
Everything beneath dies

I have seen amidst the dead world souls of fire that redefined the power of life
All are deaf living death haven't heard the kingdom calling from within

We'll bring it unto thee
Cracking to the sky
Eyes of fear die this night
Only Metal survives
We'll bring it unto thee
Cracking to the sky
Electric spears lead the hunt
Everything beneath dies
