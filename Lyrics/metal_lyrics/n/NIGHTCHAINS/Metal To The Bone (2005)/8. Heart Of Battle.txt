Now that we are one
Now its time to kill
These axes sharpened on bone
A prophecy to be fullfilled
We are off to war, yeah!
Our will blood will spill
From atop the hills, we crawl
Into the night

From all around drowned in the fight
Seiged with magic and blood
In the heart of battle the test of power
My strike leads to hell

In the strike of the blade
Times freezes away
My brothers die today
Screaming to carry on the faith
Words are not just words
When with blood they are said
Their death I lament, their bodies
to the ground fall

From all around Drowned in the fight
Seiged with magic and blood
In the heart of battle The test of power
My strike leads to hell

Vindicate their bodies
One by one!
Melt the stones of life
Agony meets glory
Through my eyes you will see, the stronger
faith and the power it brings
The prophecy now covered with blood
Slay, slay, die!

From all around Drowned in the fight
Seiged with magic and blood
In the heart of battle The test of power
My strike leads to hell
