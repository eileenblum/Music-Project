Roar of the beast I wield
Temps the madness in me
Cloud of smoke, here I go
Have to be where the lightning strikes
Anything else ain't called a life
Speed thrill blazes me on high

Faster - More Speed
Fire - Gazoline
Pumps in my viens
I have to be there
Sweat - Adrenaline
Fury - Ecstasy
Life slipping away
I can't see a thing

Got to make it worth it
Gotta break top speed
Spine-electro-fury to my heels
Got life behind me begging
Death right ahead
I'm standing in between

Faster - More Speed
Fire - Gazoline
Pumps in my viens
I have to be there
Sweat - Adrenaline
Fury - Ecstasy
Life slipping away
I can't see a thing

Some say I died others disappeared
All I know skys a highway
All is said but all ain't done
You haven't seen the last of me
I'll race the wind to eternity

Faster - More Speed
Fire - Gazoline
Pumps in my viens
I have to be there
Sweat - Adrenaline
Fury - Ecstasy
Life slipping away
I can't see a thing
