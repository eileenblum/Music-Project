Believe the rumors and what they say
you know we'll rip your face in every single way
No time for job no time to listen
We'll make it our day and now you'll listen

Living hard, beating the rain
Creating some memories for a change
Just remmember when your at sleep
We re driving fast, kicking ass or shooting up drinks

I am the master of the streets
With the filthy and scum I deal

Babe I gotta live the blast and kick some ass
cause heroes die too fast
Never stop Never Fail
Never quit on your tail

Why curse god when you can drink a beer
Why rest isn't death eternal sleep
Dont need a law to protect me
Aint no law that can stop me

I am the one and only law
Heavy metal is the law

Over the top

Dont need a law to protect me
Aint no law that can stop me
I am the master of the streets
With the filthy and scum I deal
