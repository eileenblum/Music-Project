Here I stand above the corpses I have fought
A memory of defiance to all of those I've faced
So many did I kill so many see it now
This path I chose yesterday knows no turning back

They will fall
Die or crawl
I march to the unkown

A legend carved in the hearts of men now it's my time
To follow the track of the great ones
Once again on the horizon a fighter has come
Payback the years, sweat and pain

They will fall
Die or crawl
I march to the unkown

I walk this path of death not afraid and all alone
looking back I can't see a thing just the will to carry on
Fire breathes through my hair as I defy once again
The tenth step I stand upon as I wait the final dawn

You can't stand a chance to stab me in the back
I am the jagger with a lions heart
You won't be but another in my rattle chain
This mile of skulls tells the tale of my one and only life

I have found my home

I walk this path of death not afraid and all alone
looking back I can't see a thing just the will to carry on
Fire breathes through my hair as I defy once more
The tenth step I stand upon as I wait the final dawn.
