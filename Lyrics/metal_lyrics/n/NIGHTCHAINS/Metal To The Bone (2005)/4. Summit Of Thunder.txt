Lightning did charge us with life
Descendants of the kings we are
Hell forged our steel
This summit is our seat
Silence to the false when we speak
Silence pride is our speech
To this world now men we will bring
Awake reality we reign
Smashing the world Beneath our feet
The Alive stride in darkness while all in death sleep

Flashing scars - Rip the sky
Hail the charge - yeah

Burn with us - Burn on high
On the Summit of Thunder

Nightchains gaurd thy kingdom tonight
Bound the hounds straight to the kill
Unity to the fucking end
Against the all, Hail the charge
See us ride the storm of change whirling to your world
Midnight hounds, demon child
Feast on the kill we offer this night
All in all we are one
Metal army of hell
Soon enough you will kneel of broken bone or a heart of sheep

Flashing scars - Rip the sky
Hail the charge - yeah

Burn with us - Burn on high
On the summit of Thunder

From the barren land of chaos we hail the charge
This age of weakness we will end.

Metal wind howl at the moonlight
A magic circle whirling like hell
A million watts of Metal cleansing your soul
Lightning did charge us with life
Descendants of the kings we are
Hell forged our steel
This summit is our seat
A million watts of Metal drilling through your ears

Flashing scars - Rip the sky
Hail the charge - yeah

Burn with us - Burn on high
On the summit of Thunder
