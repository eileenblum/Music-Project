"And words of a thousand songs
Will not embrace days of glory
When we rise"

Forests of banners march

We will give spaces to winds
Gardens to deserts
Estates to the wolves

This river
Accursed is flowing from hills
In its mission - unbroken
In its purity - eternal
Like tyrants returns
Like old kings tragedies

But rulers die at a twilight

Among the stars
The gates of pupils are open

Thus
In purity we will serve
To start our reign
One dark day
