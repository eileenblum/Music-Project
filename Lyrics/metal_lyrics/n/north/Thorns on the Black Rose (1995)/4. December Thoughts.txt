"We are the rolling stones crushing holy temples
Stones of your youth
we' are the dimension of searching
Dimension of your adulthood
We are the flowers on the grave
Flowers of your life"

I faced the hidden truth.
Yesterday is forgotten.

I am a warrior,
The Fight is in my veins.

"We are the flames in the heart
Flames of your desire
We are the red of eyes in darkness
The red of your Blood"

Oh, voices
Enter veins
Oh, thoughts
In Darkness Hidden Wine

"We are Power and Passion
We are Always"
