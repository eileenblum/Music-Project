Tears of snow paint the landscape
Grey sands of desert in the sky
Rivers of lightings die in the mountains
Forgotten Hermits return from the hills

Winds of centuries announce the war
The Dark Land appears on the sea
The waves of tragedy come to the coast
Silent Hermits speak again

Silver of steel awaits the dawn
The sigh of the gallows follows the flog
Vultures feast on remains of holy poison
Almighty Hermits wage the war

In ashes of temples witches dance
I raise my spear in praise
The silhouettes climbing northwards
Fathers Hermits return to the hills
