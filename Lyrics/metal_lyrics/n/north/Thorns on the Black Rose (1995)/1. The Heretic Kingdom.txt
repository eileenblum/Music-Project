Here is my kingdom
Eternal evil united, Ancient Powers enthroned
The clouds of ravens, wolves run
The loudest horns break the night
Eternity, the Queen of Mine...
The black horizon far away
Monuments die in the rain
The solitude captured in Fight
Thememories lost in present day
The castle, no human eye in the mirror
The trees standing in the rain
They are my guards, my warriors
And still remember
The lord has gone, someone captured the throne
The kingdom died, liars in misery cry
And in the sky
The eyes

The winged silhouettes
Downwards
Fly...
