There, at the seas
Where I found the hidden gates
Where a breath of The Ancients was calling me silently
I felt the power of mine
"Release your madness" -I heard
My hate in chanis awaited

There, on the hills
Where I carved the first spear
Where The Ancients were looking in drowse
They rose the heads when I hit a heart first time
Eternal lust awoke to lead

There, in the woods
Where I've met the truth
Where the trees were chanting the songs of fathers
Suddenly the Might came
The chains were broken

There
Where I rose the sword first time
Bury me...
