Nameless as shadows they rule
unseen in Darkness
Shining in my eyes

Through Ages of the Reign
They seek the one who shall continue
The glory must be eternal own
In Darkness and in blindness

Enchanted in Gold they adore me
Hidden in steel they glorify me
Flowing in Blood they lead me

Nameless as shadows they rule...
Faceless conquerors...
One day on the horizon

United and strong
Thnough ages of the Reign they feast
Forgotten
Never fell down the swamp
Awaiting
In the shadow of an oak they teach
"...The echo of the time returns..."
"...The patient shall wait..."

My rose is black forever.
