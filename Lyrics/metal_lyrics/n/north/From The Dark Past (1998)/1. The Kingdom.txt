Following the ancient track
To the forest in fog
I hear the silent whispers on my way
Secret voice of my soul

Darkness is a beautiful woman
The mirror of my dreams
The colour of my towers
Gotmother of my sin

The crying trees I mee't on my way
Remind me the times of unholy wins
Silhouettes hidden in the blackness of a coat
The hair swinging in the wind

The lands of frozen seas
Those people are his might
Forgotten truths taught by Him
Forever to be proud

The cold drops of rain I feel on my face
Are like tears of abased one
Each one of them is like a thorn on my heart
Each thorn strong like power of my hate

The forests without return way
Their silence feeds the ears
The ancient king sorrounded by trees
Is rising in cries of false

I... put my feet on the unholy ground
Each step leads me to eternity
I feel the darkest gates are near
The horns are heard - the sound of darkness Wings...
