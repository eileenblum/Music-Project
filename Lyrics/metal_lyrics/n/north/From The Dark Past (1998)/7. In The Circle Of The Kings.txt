Oh, night, mother of stars
Where is your endless land
Travelling in time you vanish
And return from the Abyss
When I open my eyes

Oh, winter, mother of pride
The white blackness, the frozen fear
Black warriors, masters of white kingdom
The hidden power, the sword on the snow

Oh, dreams, creators of kingdom
The battle masters, the victory days
The night is life, day dwells in dreams
Day is a plan, night is the swordtime

Oh, heart of warrior, the zenith of evil
The gloom of dreams, axe of reality
The way of truth, the way where you're naked
Follow the serpent
"Horned..."
It's the sign.
