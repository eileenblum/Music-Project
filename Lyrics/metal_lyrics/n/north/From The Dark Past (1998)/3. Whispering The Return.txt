Alone
Only me and my sword
In the night
My infinite kingdom is rising again

I hail the ravens
Guard of my neverending spaces
And wolves - my horned orchestra

Long was my journey
Looking for the black queen on Temptation Thron
Now I'm here
In the kingdom where the Night never ends

I am the return
Of the Moon, Wisdom and Truth
