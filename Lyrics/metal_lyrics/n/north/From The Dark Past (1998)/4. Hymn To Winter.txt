The silent cry of innocent woman
Sad whispers in the fullmoon night
Dark candles burning in the eye of the wind
Slow summoning still on the throne

Mournful chanting of alone in the night
The words of doom hidden in bonfire flames
The warriors of truth like the sands of desert
Cold wind like hammer for inquisitors...

The ancient snow with a track of naked foot
Remembers the times of victory days
Those ages passed but aren't forgotten
Dark winds are blowing again

The streams are flowing to rivers
The rivers are flowing to seas
Dark legions grow, deeply in soul
Like waters...
Like fright...
Like trees...
