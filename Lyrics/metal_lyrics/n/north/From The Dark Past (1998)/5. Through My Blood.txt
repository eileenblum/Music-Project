The moon is rising
Lord twilight won again
Through the forest I ride
Ancient warriors hail me in eternal pride
Mountains - omnipotent fortresses of Winter
Sleep in glory
I return to my empire
With victory, with darkness, in cries

My blood made the sunrise forgotten
My hate made it fallen to its knees

Now only the night will bring you silence
Only the sword will give you serenity
Blood is the most expansive
