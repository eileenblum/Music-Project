Where the cold wind brings the song of fate
And the evil powers wake up every night to rule
I stand on the hill
Mountains are trembling
Grey skies, moon is taking my hand

Proud warriors below
Cold steel of swords, awating
I rise my horn, the sign to fight is given

In the glory of Night we run
The clang of swords caresses the hungry soul
I feel the blood
The goblet of death is filling in
I rise my horn, the sign of victory is given

The madness sorrounded by gloom of tiredness vanish
Closed eyes, the Golden Gate is open
The same wind, memories, mountains
Two kingdoms become the one
