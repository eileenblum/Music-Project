Lost is the blood of mine
Dry streams of tears revive in faintness
'cause I
Have fallen first time

But broken heart of mine still beats
And soul awaken by lust returns
And I
Arise again to long...

And thoughts of mine arouse dreams again
And dreams blind by freedom run...
I know this route
Yes, I
Have returned
Returned to stay

And hands of mine so alive when I touch you
Sometimes lust is a power
And death escapes
Where I
Will be tomorrow

And then your cry arouses hate
And sword of mine looks for long hungry
Tired falls asleep again
And they
Will disturb no more
