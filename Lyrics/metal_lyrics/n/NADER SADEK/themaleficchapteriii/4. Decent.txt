Decay within the rotten trees
as complex as my damned journey
In Shame I breath, I-vomit-my- soul to forgive me
Breath, I breath,
What have I BECOME, where have I been â¦(inside)
I have begun my journey that is undone for I have become the one with the purity
I Tried to save thee, instead I pillage to condemn you
Remorse, It pains me, for I have destroyed you
thorns grow from my Skin, the nectar of pain
I drown in my own puss
For the promises I could no keep
Breath, I breath
what have I become
where have I been Inside
Denying the Loss, The Loss of Evidence
Proclamation of Death
and the guilt that follows
