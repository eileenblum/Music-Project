Blood of this earth, Stains the shore of the seas
Waste of an unseen god, to fuel the killing machine
Called forth by man, only fools are fearless for lust
Now watch as the plague is spread
Only now can blind eyes see

Machines growing, your new god calling
Raping your soil. Bath me in your oil

Unleashed to devour, all life that stands in the path
Brought to the brink of extinction, drowning in what gave life
Rollin in, waves of black, covering the ocean floor
The end to a million years, beginning a million more

Lifeless, the oceans grow stale
Formed from the bones of man, suffocating bringer of life
A new breed begins. To feed the machines
Pray to your new found god... Mechanic Idolatry

Flesh made of steel. Corroding in rust
Raw oil to feed, your mechanic idolatry

Corroding in rust, raw oil to feed

Man is of flesh, god is of oil
Draining the earth, for the blood of the soil
Insatiable lust to feed, man now the dying breed
Pray to your new found god... Mechanic idolatry
