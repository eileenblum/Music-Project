Praise no god before me. Praise only my victory!
No allegiance to any religion or coven
All gods have fallen
Bring to me my feasting
Slaves, follow me
Make this new world Mine

Desecration of your idols
Annihilate what's blasphemy
Your holy house of god is burning
Reign a new god of infamy

Rise and Call the names
Expose the fools who try to stop my
Rise and Call the names
throw away these foolish legends
Rise and Call the names
those that fed the world this sickness
