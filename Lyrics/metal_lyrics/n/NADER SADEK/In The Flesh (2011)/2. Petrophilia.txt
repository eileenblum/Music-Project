You believe and let them guide you. Every word deceiving lies.
Pride in myth, pride in genocide, the cross you bare,
the curse you hide behind

Now, that your world is gone, your religions fall,
and your God has caused,
every war we've seen

Minions pray, no longer, God has saved, not a single being
The world's decay, violent heaving, Man's beliefs, the decline of all...

The downfall of man is his belief in a god

Have you no eyes to see, what your god has done
you refused to see, and the world is dead...

Pray to a god you'll never see
Kill, and blame it on your god's enemies
Kill in his name, pay for your eternity
Made into a martyr, made a deity

Now, that your world is gone, your religions fall,
and your god has caused, every war we've seen
