Nomadic tribes scavenging, for what remains of life
To breathe the air burns, Sulphuric

Corroding gods of steel, the rusting breasts

Beneath the ruins of time, it breathes, the corpse of mankind

Made of bones decomposing
Bring the ancient souls back to life
Reborn in stone of fire
Man again is Sulphur
