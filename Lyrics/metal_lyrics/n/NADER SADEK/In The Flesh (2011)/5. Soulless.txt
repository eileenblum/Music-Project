Slaughter, kill in the name of god those who don't believe
Devour, those who block the path to your world supreme
Martyrs, for his name you die to reach a higher being
Blind, to have such faith in lies, ten thousand gods have died before you heard his-

Name - Fools believe this, lie as sacred
Chanting blindly, prayers so feeble
Mass believing, that god is light
Blind not seeing, such broken minds

Leaving a wake of dead bodies lying rotting
Devour the souls so weak, the souls you see as useless
All in the name of god - a god you hold so precious
How can they not believe so they must die
Crushing with hatred eyes, your truth is all we see
Killing with twisted minds, all those who don't believe
Devour the land and reap, rewards of holy pleasure
Falling upon your knees and chant his name

Nameless, faceless, soulless
Prayers so empty

Martyr, bastard, nameless, coward
Faceless, soulless - all lies
