I looked up and said
âWhy?!â I said âWhy?!â
All that I created now is destroyed
I remember that time while we fought together
While our dreams were one

Everything, everything is destroyed
The lifetime that weâve dreamed of is gone away
I cried so many times
These are sad words but itâs useless talking about it
âcause Iâll keep standing

Standing the troubles
Standing your life
Standing your pain
Standing with my broken dreams

Standing, The dream is not gone
We can still face this
Donât leave me alone
In you I find all that is impossible
But difficult is a word I like
Standing, The Dream is not gone
In you I find all that is impossible
Standing my broken dreams
