And misery brought me here
Mistakes in my life that shout my fear
Which becomes somethin'
bigger than my incapacity
This is not a dream, this is not a game

âBut I'm here with you
Ready to cover you with my tears
Chasing you, hoping to find a wayâ

How can I trust you? How can I be with you?
How can I embrace your glory?

âYou don't have to trust me, you have to die
And follow me, and watch miseryâ

The beauty of misery, the lies of many
That build me and blind me

All is misery, all is misery

But now I can see
But now I can breath
The ashes of my dream
The love of you and me

In this misery
