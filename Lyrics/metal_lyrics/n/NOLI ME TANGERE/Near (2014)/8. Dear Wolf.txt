Dear Wolf, I want to tell you a story
I was walking, into the twilight
My heart was strong, and I was thinking of myself
Chasing in a dream of darkness

Apparently alone like you, in search for a beam of light
Humans, not wolves, catching my soul today and tonight
Tonight and forever

I fought many battles but I can stay
I've seen many deads but I'm not afraid
Afraid of my soul, afraid of my heart
I fought many battles but I can stay

And all these things crush over me and you!
Life like a path in the woods, all betrayed me but not you
Sick of this false, lying world; sick of the betrayers

Scars of the past that surrounds me, always
I want to break up the sadness and the false

And you that always listen and hear the cry of my heart
And you that always collect my pieces and piece together
And you that always listen and hear the cry of my heart
And you that always piece me together

I'm not scared anymore, I'm not hurt anymore

We are free
