And you cried, youâve failed, broken into pieces,
Remnants of a life, a life with a burden
You wanted, you hoped, you had a dream

Wake up my friend, your hair are blown in the wind
No sun, no moon, everything null
Your life was a crystal, your soul a glass, immutable

But you were silent, all your suffering closed in your soul
You smiled at me all times but your life was pendent in a brittle lead

The eyesâ¦. Full!
The eyes full of tears but you smiled all times

Wake up my friend, I can see a hope so far
Wake up my friend, donât throw away your life
Wake up my friend

You understood, all sadness going away so quickly
A reborn spirit, you realized that life is beautiful
You wanted to throw away your life
No more, no more!
Your heart was broken, no more

Your heart was broken, your heart revived
You understood, your heart was broken, no more
You understood, all sadness going away so quickly
A reborn spirit, you realized that life is beautiful

Wake up my friend, youâre not alone
Wake up my friend, youâre not alone
Open your eyes, you will be no more forsaken
I promise you, I promise you

Knife Stolen
