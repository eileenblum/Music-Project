You're name will be Ichabod

Come here, taste this land, come here eat this fruit, kiss the broken roots

He was born in the blood
Ichabod! Ichabod!

The art of falling, magnificent reality
He wants to die, he wants to die
He wants to die

So it is, has opened his eyes, a new taste, a new taste in mind
Disobey, has opened his eyes, a new taste, a new taste in mind

(you are the cursed, you are the fallen)
Don't you hear the sound? Don't you hear my voice?
I'll let you fly and taste my night
(I wish you the best), you're alone but not without hope

Around falls down to the deep ground
But now he watches his full hollow

Don't let you go, don't stay in doubt
(Don't let you go)

Open that door and embrace my heart
(you are the cursed, you are the fallen)
Show me your bravery because
Ichabod has a heart
