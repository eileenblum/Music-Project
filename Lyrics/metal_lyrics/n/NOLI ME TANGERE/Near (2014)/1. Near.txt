Sometimes I wake up, I breath but it seems I'm dead
I look that star, always, but there's no time

Many problems many hate in a world that I've to wait
If this can be a story, I wish I could tell it to everyone
So free your eyes and try to listen to me

They're coming! They're coming, run and don't stop
They're coming, It's almost over, run!

I see you cry everytime

Come, come with me, stand up from your knees
in this mean world, don't be afraid
Just run

Sometimes I wake up, I breath but it seems I'm dead
I look that star, always, but there's no time

Now I feel alive, I feel your presence, It's far, It's beautiful
Now I feel alive, I feel your presence, It's far, Its beauty

It's Near
