Rain! I said rain! Fall down now! Fall down now!
Mystery comes from life

And I want to seal my dream
And I want to grab my needs

It's a long way, it's a long way

The night has come, it's time to run
Searching for a dream, fall or rise
The night has come it's time to run

The nasty hour is sleeping
The time wants me
Oh sorrow leave me for I am going

Long way to, long way with
Short day come, short day creep

It's a long way, it's a long way

The night has come, it's time to run
Searching for a dream, fall or rise
The night has come it's time to run

Rain! I said rain! Fall down now! Fall down now!
(Rain!)
