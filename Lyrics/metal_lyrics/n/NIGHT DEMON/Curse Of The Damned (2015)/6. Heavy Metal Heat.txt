Friday night
Get your tickets to the show
It's been one hell of a week
Your mind's on overload
Stand Tall!
Suck it up
Don't let the man get you down
Fight back!
Have no fear
You're the toughest one around

When your blood is pumping high
And you're feeling like your heart's on overdrive
Set the stage your life begins
You can hear the thunder roar
You can feel the heavy metal heat

Metal heat!

Grab your shit
Now it's time to hit the road
Another minute here
You're going to explode

Stand Tall!
Suck it up
Don't let the man get you down
Fight back!
Have no fear
You're the toughest one around

When your blood is pumping high 
And you're feeling like your heart's on overdrive
Set the stage your life begins
You can hear the thunder roar
You can feel the heavy metal heat
