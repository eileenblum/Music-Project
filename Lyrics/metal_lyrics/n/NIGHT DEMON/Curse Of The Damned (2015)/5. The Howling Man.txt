Holy rollers with your staff of truth
Mind controllers defending God with no proof
But you must believe them

You do not know what you speak of
The howling man is no man at all
Do not open up the door
Evil will trick you
I won't let you take this world to hell

Prince of darkness taking the form of man
Manipulating, doing all that he can
But don't believe him

You do not know what you speak of
The howling man is no man at all
Do not open up the door
Evil will trick you
I won't let you take this world to hell

Through history, he's just a face in the crowd
Where there was sin, corruption, and war
He was always there
Now that he's trapped, I'm not letting go
Please, oh please
Don't open the door!

No!
Don't open the door
No!
Don't open the door
No!
Not again!
No!
No!

You do not know what you speak of
The howling man is no man at all
Do not open up the door
Evil will trick you
I won't let you take this world to hell
