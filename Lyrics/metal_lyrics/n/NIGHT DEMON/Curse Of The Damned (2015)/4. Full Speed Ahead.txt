Rise and shine
Feel the chill down cry spine
Thy ship approaches the land
Load my gun
Time for some fun
The mission is clear
It's time to win this war

Full speed ahead
Fight to the death
Full speed ahead
Take our last breath
Fight to the death

Overboard
We swim for the shore
Machine gun fire everywhere
Picking us off one by one
10,000 bodies piled on the beach
As I look...
I look to the sky
See the body parts raining down
We're gonna die if we choose not to fight
Not giving up
Only one way to go

Full speed ahead
Fight to the death
Full speed ahead
Take our last breath
Fight to the death
