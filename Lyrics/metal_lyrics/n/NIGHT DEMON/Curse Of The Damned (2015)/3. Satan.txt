Lost in the dark
Between Heaven and Hell
Inverted crosses on the walls
A fallen angel comes up to you
Says follow me your master calls
His name is...

SATAN
He rules the underworld
SATAN
He's coming for your soul

There's no turning back at the seventh gate
Drink from the chalice like before
666!
How many times do we have to ask?!
For some mercy on us all
C'mon now

SATAN
He rules the underworld
SATAN
He's coming for your soul

And he'll never stop
'Til he gets what he wants
And he's comin', comin' after you!

You better watch your back
Evil is on the attack
It's time to give up now
There's no way
That you'll ever win
Just bow down to him
His name is Satan
