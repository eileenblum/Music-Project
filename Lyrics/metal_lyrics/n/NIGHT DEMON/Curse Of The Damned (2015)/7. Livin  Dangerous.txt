Pleased to meet you
How do you do
See I'm a man with much to prove
I listen to no one
Do what I choose
There's no way that I can lose

So lock me up and throw away the key
There's no one to fear but me

Livin' dangerous tonight
I just can't seem to get it right
Livin' dangerous
Every day and night
There's no easy way to win this fight

No way out!

When you see me
Just walk away
I'll wipe that smile right off your face
'Cause I'm a crazy mutha
I got a heart made of steel
Gonna show you how I feel

So lock me up and throw away the key
There's no one to fear but me

Livin' dangerous tonight
I just can't seem to get it right
Livin' dangerous
All my goddamn life
There's no easy way to win this fight
No way out!

So now you know
The damage I can do
It's better me than you
So turn around
Just turn and walk away
And go back from where you came
