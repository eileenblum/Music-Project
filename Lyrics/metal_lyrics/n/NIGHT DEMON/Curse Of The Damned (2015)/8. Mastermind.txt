Walk down that road
And hold your head up high
But beware that evil awaits you
No matter how hard you try
Don't hide in the shadows
Just to avoid the light
For the devil he may take your life away

Here it comes down, crashing your walls
Then you will know your destiny calls
'Cause you're the mastermind
Don't waste your time
You're the mastermind

Open the doorway
And step into your mind
Keep on pushing forward

No matter what lurks behind
Take it or leave it
The choice is up to you
For the devil he will take your fife for sure

Here it comes down, crashing your walls
Then you will know your destiny calls
'Cause you're the mastermind

Can't see
Your eyes are burning
The truth filled with lies
Create your own reality
No compromise
Oh and here it comes
That feeling of woe
Tap into the universe
'Cause you're the master of control

Here it comes down, crashing your walls
Then you will know your destiny calls
'Cause you're the mastermind
Don't waste your time
You're the mastermind

You're the mastermind
Don't waste your time
You're the mastermind
