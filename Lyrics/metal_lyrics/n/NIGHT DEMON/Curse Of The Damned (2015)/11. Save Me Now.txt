I hear a voice screaming in the night
A desperate cry from the grave
Heavy breathing
Nothing is in sight
I try to make my escape
Madness takes over my mind
I'm going insane
In the dark corners you will find
The questions remain

Save me now 'cause I'm losing all control
Save me now death is knocking at my door
Save me now Lucifer has got a hold
My soul is gonna burn in flames

I see the masses burning down the woods
Only time I can borrow
Oh high priestess say those ancient words
"Rey oscura tome tu trono"
Stab that dagger through my heart
Then go to hell
I am the one who wears the mark
I know you can tell

Save me now 'cause I'm losing all control
Save me now death is knocking at my door
Save me now Lucifer has got a hold
My soul is gonna burn in flames
