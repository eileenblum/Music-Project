They wait for the night to fall
Then come out and play
They're not human anymore
On a moody, mystic night
You know there's something strange
When they're gunning for the door

I hear a shot ring out
Then ricochet!
Bullets flying by my head
The sirens start to roll
It's looking pretty grim
But the show must go on

Run!
Get away

You feel like you've been hit
No time to waste
Get away

Run for your life
(For your life)
Keep on runnin'
I can't give you safety anymore
Run for your life
(For your life)
For your life
Death is standing right at the front door
Run for your life!
