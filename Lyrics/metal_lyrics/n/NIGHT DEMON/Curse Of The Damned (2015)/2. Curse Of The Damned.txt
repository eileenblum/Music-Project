Many years ago when darkness ruled the throne
The second son of a king was out on his own
Took his anger and he turned it into hate
'Til the devil's reaper handed him his fate
He gave him the curse of the damned

Curse of the damned
You cannot erase the sins of this man
Curse of the damned

Seeking sanctuary in the holy lands
There was no escaping the bloodshed by his hands
He looked to the heavens, said to the lord
Is this what you've planned for me?!
If I must kill...

It's a price I'm willing to pay
I am the curse of the damned!

Curse of the damned
You cannot erase the sins of this man
Curse of the damned
