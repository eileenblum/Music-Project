All alone as the night takes the day
Two young lovers park to get away
That noise you heard?
Oh, it's just in your head
Little do you know...
You're gonna wind up dead

Look behind you
He's corning to get you 
With his axe in his hands 
Screams in the night

The beast is charged and he's ready to go
Swings his axe with one fatal blow
You look in horror
And you start to pray
Nothing left to do
But just try to get away

Look behind you
He's coming to get you
With his axe in his hands 
Screams in the night
