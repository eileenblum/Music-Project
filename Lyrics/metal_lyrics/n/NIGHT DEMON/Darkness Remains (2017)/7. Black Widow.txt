All it took was a single look
Got you feeling trapped under a spell
See those eyes with a look of revenge
Paralyzing you in private hell

Hunting in the night
She's got you in her sight

Black Widow - She'll never be alone again
Black Widow - Ripping out the hearts of all men
Black Widow - Coming strong
Black Widow - Won't be long
Black Widow - She's out for blood
Black Widow - Looking for your love

Be on the look when you walk the streets
Ravenous for flesh the queen awaits
Like a spider ready to eat
Venom piercing venomous fangs give her away

Don't be misunderstood
She'd kill you if she could

Black Widow - She'll never be alone again
Black Widow - Ripping out the hearts of all men
Black Widow - Scarlett witch
Black Widow - Digs your ditch
Black Widow - Spin her web
Black Widow - Here she comes - again
