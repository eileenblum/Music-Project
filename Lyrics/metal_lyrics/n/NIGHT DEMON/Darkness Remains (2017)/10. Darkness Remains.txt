Close your windows
Look your doors
There's a full moon out tonight

Can you hear the howling
Cries of pain
From the monster out for prey

I was over yesterday
And I knew my life would change
But I feel so all alone
Trying to stop this on my own
The darkness remains

Feeling hopeless
Trapped inside
Finding no place to hide
I walk the graveyard of my mind
Afraid I'm running out of time

I was over yesterday
And I knew my life would change
But I feel so all alone
Trying to stop this on my own
The darkness remains
