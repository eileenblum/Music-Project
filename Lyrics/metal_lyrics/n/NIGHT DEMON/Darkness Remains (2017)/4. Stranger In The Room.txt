Feel the chill in hte night
A demon cast by the dim light
Hard to believe
The evil unseen
But here it comes again

A meeting in darkness
The eerie feeling of silence
I have no control
Of things I've been told
And here it comes...

Again for me but waits til I'm alone
Time to makes its presence known
Why can't you see it's scaring the life out of me
There's a stranger in the room

Fighting to get through the fear
The devil whispers in my ear
Try to believe in the things you can't see
They plainly endure
And here it comes...

Again for me but waits til I'm alone
Time to makes its presence known
Why can't you see it's scaring the life out of me
There's a stranger in the room

Through the cold I can see the Mask of death
Staring deep into my soul
Got to make my way out of this nightmare
But I know there's no turning back for me
