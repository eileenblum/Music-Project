In the dark you hear it calling out to you
Cant resist the power flowing through

Hold on
Donât let go
Time to claim your true destiny
We've waited for you
Welcome to the night

In the Shadows Satanâs Minions await
So beware you must prepare before its too late

Hold on
Don't let go
The time has come to be who you are
You have arrived
Welcome to the night

Feel the build of rage
Find the key to unlock this beast from it's cage

You're heart is racing hunger leads you on the prowl
Show your teeth unleash your blood-thirsty howl

Hold on
Donât let go
You only see what you want to believe
Like it or not
Welcome to the blessed night
