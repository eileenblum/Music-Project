A massive power as it grips your soul
A rush of fear as it assumes control
Don't let in the panic, take it slow
Not knowing how it came to this
Last thing I remember is a bloody fist
Now the hunt is on for you!

Now you're burning down the road
Like the Devil in disguise
Look in the rear-view mirror
Just a pair of blood-red eyes
Where you going to go?
Don't even want to know
A place so far from home
Life on the run,

Life on the run!

The line's a blur as you grip the wheel
Power games and the thunder steel
Got to keep you in that mode
A hand of doom with an iron grip
Slam the gas, don't let it slip
Time to hit that overload

Now you're burning down the road
Like the Devil in disguise
Look in the rear-view mirror
Just a pair of blood-red eyes
Where you going to go?
Don't even want to know
A place so far from home
Life on the run!

[Solo]

It all starts coming back
Emerges from the past
Oh no! You can't change
Your heart is beating fast
Not longer will you last
This life on the runâ¦
