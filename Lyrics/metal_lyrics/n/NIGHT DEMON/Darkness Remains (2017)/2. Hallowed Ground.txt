Up on the hill they sit upon their thrones
After dark they call for those without a home

Built by slaves on hollowed ground
Their graves are lost and never found
Ancient ones have always known
They would all be ground to stone

Lost souls will rise
At the toll of the bell
All seeing eyes
Don't try to fight
There's no way out
Forever trapped on hallowed ground

As the earth grows cold we hear the soundless cry
Look beyond and realize the dead don't die

Through the years they've roamed the place
Native sons of noble race
Pain and suffering they felt
From injustice they were dealt

Lost souls will rise
At the toll of the bell
All seeing eyes
Don't try to fight
There's no way out
You're gonna die on hallowed ground

Few escaped to tell the tale
Of this primeval horror
I have fled, but am I free
Or am I damned eternally?

After all these years we still can hear the sound
Of the ancient ones who died on hallowed ground
