Hard times just chasing the dream
Trying to stay alive
You thought you were on the winning team
Now you can't survive

Fight for yourself
Count on no one else
At the end of the day, you better know...
You're on your own

Before long You're the talk of the town
Everybody wants you
Behind your back they will put you down
Nobody else to run now

Fight for yourself
Count on no one else
At the end of the day, you better know...
You're on your own

Nobody cares when you're out on the streets (on your own)
You get tired of the city heat (on your own)
You gotta hustle to make ends meet (on your own)
That's the price of destiny
On your own
