Do you remember tomorrow today
We were just kids running free
Back in the days when Charlotte was a whore
She unleashed the wrathchild in me
Drifter in a strange world
Murdering in the rue morgue

Maiden hell

Invaders coming for the children of the damned
The prisoner runs to the hills
Hallowed by thy name with the flash of
the blade the trooper dies in a gangland
What happened to these waysted years
Edward the great
Told us heaven can wait
He was maiden hell

Maiden hell

The evil that men do
No prayer for the dead
Left us in fear of the dark

Came out of a Blaze to find the brave new world
The final frontier looks so far

If eternity fails
Blood brothers will previal

We were Maiden hell
