We're comin' to your town
Tonight we're gettin' down
We're gonna weed out the fakes

I've got some news for you
You're kinda pretty too
But you don't have what it takes

Don't wander in the dark
we will find you
beware of our bite
We are the Night Demon!

We'll drink up all the beer
leave your women in fear
rape and pillage the land

Metal is on the rise
our fury never dies
brothers in arms we will stand

Don't wander in the dark
we will find you
beware of our bite
We are the Night Demon!
