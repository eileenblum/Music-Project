Long ago in a distant land
lived a crazy mad arab man
cross his path, it's likely you'd be dead

He wrote a book bound in human flesh
told the secrets of Sumerian death
Crimson desert is where he laid his head

can you hear Cthulu's call?
High priest to The Great Old Ones
monsters of death one and all
Satan's will shall be done

Ancient Evil

No one knows of the madness inside
To find the answer you must truly die
Darkness lurks deep in the heart of man

The answer is in the Necronomicon
The grimoire promises a new dawn
embrace it's power if you can
