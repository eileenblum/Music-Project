Please allow me to introduce myself
I am The Devil wearing white
Follow me, take my hand
I'll lead you to the promised land

Drink from the chalice
The unholy grail
Drink from the chalice
I'll give you everlasting life

Don't be afraid of temptation
It is the evil that makes us grow
Don't you stray from away from me
Before your horns begin to show

Drink from the chalice
The unholy grail
Drink from the chalice
I'll give you everlasting life

Now that you know who I am
Don't try to run and hide
We've made a deal in blood
The darkness can't be denied
