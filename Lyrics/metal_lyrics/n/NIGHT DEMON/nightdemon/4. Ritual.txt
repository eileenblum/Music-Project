Tonight the moon is full
Dead rising from their graves
Call up all your friends
It's time to misbehave

Now we sit and wait for the demon's call
Woah oh oh oh
Come on everybody one and all
Get down to the ritual

Bring your spells
And your pentagrams
The witching hour
Is close at hand

Now we sit and wait for the demon's call
Woah oh oh oh
Come on everybody one and all
Get down to the ritual

Ritual!
