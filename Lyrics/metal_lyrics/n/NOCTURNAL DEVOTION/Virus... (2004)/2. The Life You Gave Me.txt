Chocking on life and i am chocking on death
Here alone and i am taking my final breath

You can't see me you don't know me
Out of view i am dirty one picture in my mind
I am trapped from the inside

My father, my mother
No sister, no brother

I don't know i don't see a way out for me
I don't know i don't see
I am chocking on the life you gave me

The life you gave me
The life you gave me drowned

I am chocking on the air
I am chocking on the dirt

I am chocking on the difference
And i do not feel the hurt
