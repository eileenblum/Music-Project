It's like a bad dream every day to see
The people, don't have a soul

I am feel so sorry, every day to see
They have master, don't have they life

This is a real world, i can't stop it
I hate to see on the death eyes
The people are havn,t soul
They vote wrong way

This a time of religious monsters
This a time of religious servants
Nature pushed to second place

This a time of religious servants
Nature pushed to second place

I want kill
I want kill, stupid time

This is a real world, i can't stop it
This is a real world, i hate live here
