I am only one
This is my life, i am my master
I am only one
And you can't come, to inside my self
For you is closed
This my self, this is my world
My territory

Die you alien die
Die you burglar you die
You burglary my soul
Die you lier you die
Die you fucker you die
Die you fucker you die

You, you and me
You, in real fight
You, you whit me
You, you lost

Troubles off
