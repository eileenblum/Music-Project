One second it all
To lose everything

Bleeding purposely
Bleeding in my sleep
Bleeding profusely
For i am your enemy

What shit you telling me
Living intravenously
What shit you telling me
Is this all you want to by

This is not how i want to live my life

You are the reason for my bloody soul
I fade into a river on fire and of death

Bleeding my day bleeding my night

I want back only my life
