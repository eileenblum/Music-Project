I hate you
You can't hate me more, more than i hate you
You are a like you virus on the inside

This is the end i am not your friend
Before you see don't judge me

And all this pain came back again
Just when thought i was sane

As from your tongue the bullets come
I want to know what is like to kill someone

And i feel so

I hate you because of who you are
Inside of me

/THERE/ A VIRUS INSIDE ME
