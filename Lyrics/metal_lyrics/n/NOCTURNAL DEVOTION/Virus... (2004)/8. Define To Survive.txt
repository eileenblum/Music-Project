I will define what you give what you give
To me
I will define to survive

You cross, the white line
You told, a lie

How does it feel to be alive?
And just survive
Take what you can and than you die
A pointless life
You follow the crowd
You never tried
To think for your self
Six feet under pride

You can't tell me
What to do whit my life
You have got no right
