Broken wings upon me,
Disappointed's tears
Perverse fortune wakes up
Magnitude of my exist

Waiting for sentence of the death

Suspended in huge vacuum
I still count of fast solution
Imprison pieces of soul
Only aim to destruction

Waiting for the death
I'm hiding in his arms

[Chorus:]
Mighty lord take of the spell
Take of course that made me blind
Am I over death am I over life

He: Groggy of wasted fear / She: Me against my life,
I,m folding roses on my grave / Me against my heart
Retard remain of human wishes / Me against my love,
Climbing to prevent escape / Me against my blood.

He: Lord of darkness side / She: Lord of darkness side
I entrust to you my life! / Give me back my life!

She: I'm calling you, I'm waiting for your awakening, Rise! across the deadly threshold!
He: I hear your voice, I fell sweet numbness, your tears are falling down on my haunted soul...

[Chorus:]
Mighty lord take of the spell
Take of course that made me blind
Am I over death am I over life?!
Mighty lord take of the spell
Take of course that made me blind
Am I over death am I over life...
