Remember, and don't forget
It's a hard lonely ride
Once you get on the track
It fucking hurts inside

I'm cold deep inside
I squeeze the glass
Can't be a particle
Life won't just pass

Numb inside with the booze
I anticipate and can't help
It's sudden burst and ooze
Through my senseless lids

I stare at the door
And wish for the end
Red drops fall on the floor
Day turns into another

Remember, and don't forget
It's a hard lonely ride
Once you get on the track
It fucking hurts inside
Ass kicked hurd
Mind fucked up
Keeping a low profile
You won't ever look up

It's hurts to the bone
So i drink alone
Swallowing another beer
Mixed with salty tear

Wvert day i lose my life
Pursuing the unattainable
I make me life so undurable

Ass kicked hurd
Mind fucked up
Keeping a low profile
You won't ever look up
