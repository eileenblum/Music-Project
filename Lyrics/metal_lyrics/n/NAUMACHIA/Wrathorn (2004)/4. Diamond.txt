Ina heart crushed hard
A cold diamond is stuck still
Let me understand:
Who i am? what should i feel?

The sense of existence, so grey
Got stuck in my past day
How long, please tell me
Will i search for thee?

In the mirror made of diamond
With the dream realm i bond
There my future i can see
Please, from this dream set me free

When the night halls with the starry spark
My mirror breds the perfect dark
There sounds foggish tune of pain
It's not blood, that runs in my vein

In the mirror made of diamond
With the dream realm i bond
There my future i can see
Please, from this dream set me free
