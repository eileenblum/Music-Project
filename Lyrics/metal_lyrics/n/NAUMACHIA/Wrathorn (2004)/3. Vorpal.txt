Wake up- give me my silver vorpal
Wake up- i pass away by the portal
Stand up- hearts the beats
Wake up- meet the beats
Wake up- bring me my silver vorpal
Wake up- make my fucking immortal
Stand up-hearts beats
Wake up- real meat

From the history of our death
Black dreams bring the messages
A new generation comes into existence
Thought the fucking worlds
Has forgotten
One- on the border under the sky
One- on the end roads of devilish realm
Children of the worse god
They are they will be

Wake up- give me my silver vorpal
Wake up- i pass away by the portal
Stand up- hearts the beats
Wake up- meet the beats
Wake up- bring me my silver vorpal
Wake up- make my fucking immortal
Stand up-hearts beats
Wake up- real meat

From the point of beginning
Our hopes are our feelings
Only naked knife in our face
Like a day of oblivion in me
Come on, come to me - in race
They see - who can be
Children of the worse god
They are genuine let them be
