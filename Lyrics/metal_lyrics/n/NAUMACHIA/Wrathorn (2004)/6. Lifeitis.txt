He just want
To sleep for another day

Longing for jis mother's craing arms
He ended up where people pass away
Leaving behind no memories or names
In a place where tried rain cleans urba veins

All the pain
Doesn't fell the same
As he remembers it

Somehow lost his dreams
On his hard way to hell
Here' nothing is what it seems
Even angels cannot tell

He hasn't awaken for two days now
And no one cares who, why or how
Craving for the oblivious paradise
He's changed all he's seen into it's size

Somehow lost his dreams
On his hard way to hell
Here' nothing is what it seems
Even angels cannot tell

Holding his own arms tight
Pretending to pray and cray
Can't convince the far blue sky
To let him cease and die

He just wants
To sleep for another day
