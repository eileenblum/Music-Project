Walking the paths
Of urbanmaze
I've grown tough
With facts to face

I reached the hard ground
And much further below
Giving out no damn sound
Of complaint with what i saw

I've been alone
A wolf leading its pack
You come and go
I don't give a fuck

Never wanted you or needed
Couldn't care less
Walk on i won't feel seeded
Cos i live only for myself

I'd reather not
Cos all fades away
With no second thought
This is all I've got to say

Live is so fragile
And so is the feeling
Can't affoeth another loss
Find it damn killing
