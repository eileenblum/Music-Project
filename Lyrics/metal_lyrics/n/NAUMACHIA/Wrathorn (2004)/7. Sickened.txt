I must close my eyes
I won't speak again
Can't tell more lies
Nothing is the same

Don't need you fear
Don't want your help
I've been so weird
And always by myself

Can't stand it any more
Life makes me so sick
One day I'll stop that fight
I'll turn my back on light

Don't try getting near
If you're scared of seen
I'm just a freak
I'm so fucking sick
