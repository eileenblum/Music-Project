Have you ever been mistreated?
Have you ever felt so lonely it hurt?
Have you ever hurt so much you wanted
To disappear?
Have you been used and abused to the point
You couldn't look in the mirror?
Have you been victimized? Humiliated?

Have you?

Because i haven't, never have, never will,
But I'm willing to inflict the pain
On you all over again.
