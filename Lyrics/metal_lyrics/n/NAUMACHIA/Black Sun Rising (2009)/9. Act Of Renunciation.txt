I am taking a stand now
You will hear me

I refuse to do anything with this world
I am becoming something now

You all are just footprints
On my way to becoming the apex of creation

I have sinned against your humanity
In pursuit of insatiable indulgence
Shattered your faith and violated your laws

I want this world to end
I want the circle complete

Stars are breathing down on me
I can see the curve of the Earth
I will shade the Sun with my wings
Unleash winds that blow insanity

When I flutter my wings
This world will be gone
