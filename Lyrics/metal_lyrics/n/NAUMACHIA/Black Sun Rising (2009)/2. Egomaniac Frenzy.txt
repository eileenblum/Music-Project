Don't presume you know me
I let you look through the key hole
Just to hear your heart beat
And smell your fear

You are made for obedience
I'll yield to overpowering desire
To transform my thoughts
Into your memories

I've lost my soul somewhere
I guess I've sunk it in all the liquor
Or threw it up with the puke
I am the empty-core modern zombie

Don't look for a reason
There is none
No liberation is coming
Once I'm done

I close the drapes
Evade the light
And welcome life
Into my life
