I've opened you to Infinity
Through excruciating Pain
In the Rite of
Reciprocal Iconolatry
I've imposed my perspective
On yet another Sleeper

Pleasure to the point of Pain
Pain to the point of Pleasure

Sedated Daimona
Frozen in her moment of Glory
Flesh sculpture
Offering her story

Goddess of incessant Grief
Scared not to die but to live
In the Rite of
Mutual Divini cation
I've made you anew
I've shaped you through

Into the Blood Fountain
Human Shrine
I've been cleansed
For some time
