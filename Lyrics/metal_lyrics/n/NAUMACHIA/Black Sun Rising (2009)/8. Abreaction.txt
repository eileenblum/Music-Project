How far can I go?

When life becomes judged as a waste and loss
What else is there to lose?

Once you do it
It feels so scaringly good and easy
You just can't stop
Or ever go back

Each time the border line
Gets moved beyond my reach
And the bottom shifts lower
How far can I go?

I can't find the rush no more
I'm just chasing the drug
Trying to relive again
The original frenzy smack

I am the Beast of Anger
Chained to the rock of my life
I'll disappear into the link of these lines
And be reborn in your mind

If you want another Face of Evil
Look in the mirror
