Can't decipher the human code
It's getting harder to know what's real
Don't know how to live among you all
Immune and indifferent, I just can't feel

Can't live your life
Diminished to a number
Dwarfed to a cubicle of flesh
Chasing time like a rat on a wheel
You make it go faster
And complain how it feels

INWARD SPIRAL

I am asking myself questions
Just to hear someone talk
I get intimate with my thoughts
I'm going quietly insane

I alleviate the delusion
Of being a slave to triggered responses
And remind myself of being alive
By frequent incisions and spilling my blood
