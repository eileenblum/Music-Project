Suffer, suffer like I have
Feel the pain tear you apart from inside
Ignorant one, receive my wrath
for thy deeds which soiled the essence of Pleroma
Preceive the disgrace you laid upon us
for as I see the bloodred sky
I can hear the winds of doom...

Cross the ocean of storms
to the fallen land buried in ruins
and you will realize the truth
that nothing was meant to be
As the grievance of life increase
and grow stronger and stronger every day
Release me from these chains of torment

Even the white bird, that was made
for life and hope, has turned into stone
Now darkness falls deeper in every heart
and abysmal fear overcomes mandkind
They have abandoned true freedom
Now the time has come, it's too late!

I have seen so many life
drowning in your waters
again and again, all for nothing
I know they will be condemned
for their oath of blindness

We are forever doomed
We were all born with this curse

Dark mistress of the night
awaken from your eternal slumber
and take me far away form this place
to the lands of my dreams and hope
I know I can't live here anymore
So please save me,
from these chains of tormetnt!

Dark mistress of the night
awaken from your eternal slumber
Tand take me far away form this place
to the lands of my dreams and hope

By justice, I judge thee, the demiurg

Suffer, suffer like I have
Feel the pain tear you apart from inside
Ignorant one, receive my wrath
for thy deeds which soiled the essence of Pleroma
Preceive the disgrace you laid upon us
for as I see the bloodred sky
I can hear the winds of doom...
