As I reflect my past
I memorize the nights in solitude
when my only friend
was the dagger at my heart
and the essence of red streams,
which I released from the prison of my veins,
mirrored the lone trust I ever felt
Because my only friend was Death

The silent screams of my aching heart
was buried into everlasting stillness
and the pain I suffered every day
was unseen in the dark chambers
which was my very soul...

But in solitaire hours in the dead of night
I stared deep into the ravenous abyss
and as I float into qliffotic tunnels
I saw them, eleven shadows from beyond
In their black oceans I drowned myself
and so, I was reborn as a Spirit

What I saw in the depths
ignited a forbidden flame in my heart
and now, dealed by the light of Lucifer

As I reflect my past
I memorize the nights in solitude
when my only friend
was the dagger at my heart

...and I truly know
that all the pain was worth it

This nights of black agony
gave everlasting birth
to the essence of my true self
I speard my wingd and fly away
into a night, so beautiful and clear
Nox Aurea...

The struggle of Liberation goes on
until the very last chain is broken
The path to wisdom dwells beneath us
Per Aspera Ad Astra...
