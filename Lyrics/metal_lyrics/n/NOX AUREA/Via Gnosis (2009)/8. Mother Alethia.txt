And I fell from skies of divine...

Oh Mother, touch my soul again
and free me from this human being
for You are nothing but the Truth itself

I still remember in the dark night
how the silent rain gathered
my tears of abandoned emotions
I was cast away from the beautiful serenity
into a foreign place called life

Cold winds danced with my newborn heart
I perceived the physical foundation
Cosmos, the aimless prison of flesh
I was bound to the mocking earth
in a world where light casts shadows

I screamed of pain, I cried of suffering
Please, concealed stars beyond (clouds of grey)
feel my grief, sense my longing
I wonder,
did they ever hear my early despair?

Mother Aletheia,
save us from this dreadful agony
My dear Aletheia,
bring us back to delightful silence

Homeless and divided,
as broken glass and shattered wings
I was spread around the dismal ground
Into the night of unknown I took my first steps
the childhood of my nightmare

Yet, as the black rain and cold winds
caressed my naked human skin
I realized, the mirror reflected a stranger
and the world was a stranger to me
I was bound to the mocking earth
in a world where light casts shadows

And I remember when I first saw them,
the hylics, the essence of tragedy
Fumbling in shadows of the demiurg
I was but derided by their presence

I wasn't them and their dreams weren't mine
The rain brought forth mysterious questions
and revealed to me sealed forgotten paths
I saw the mournful gates deep inside of me
and as I heard the voice of Lucifer
I entered the gates in ecstasy

Mother Aletheia,
save us from this dreadful agony
My dear Aletheia,
bring us back to delightful silence

Oh, Pleroma...
