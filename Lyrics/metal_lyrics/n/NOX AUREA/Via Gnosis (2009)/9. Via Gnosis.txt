Awakened from the illusory dreams
by her beautiful soundless voice
Called by the nigth of unbeing
from beyond the realms of the soul

The path I follow, long and lonely,
takes me far away, away from the world
Until the shadows of the ego fades into nothing
Ascending through spiritual transcendence
into the unknown depths of Truth

Via Gnosis...
