Thou, the essence of purity
and highest emanation of Chaos
The clear light of the void
Grant me Thy infinite powers
Illuminate me with Thy great wisdom
For I am forever Thine

Thou, the Lord who petrifies the blind
and burn them with the fire of divine
I perceive Thy wordless voice
which, in every encounter,
master the illusions of mind

Odium Divinum!

Grant me Thy spiritual burning sword
So that I can cut and dissolve
the illusional flesh of the demiurg
For I follow the forbidden paths
To liberation of the true self
Discovered only by those
who have the power to find it

Thou, the golden key to emancipation
whose call guides me into deepest trance
The opposer of the filthy being
Dissolve these fettering structures
Thou, the serpent who lurks in forbidden shadows
which hold the secrets beyond all times
Let me see the beauty of Thy hidden entity
Oh, let me be at one with Thee

Thou, the purifying fire of Gnosis
whose formless sparks
and spiritual impulses subdues the ego
Thou, the accuser of all cosmig being
My holy Father, I am forever Thine...

Odium Divinum!
