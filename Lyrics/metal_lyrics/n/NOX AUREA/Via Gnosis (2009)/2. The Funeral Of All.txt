Primeval supremacy of divine
Swept the cold forsaken universe
The masses drowns in oceans of blood
Empires falls, enclosing by ashes
Human life descends into nothing

And there was silence...

I listen to the beautiful sound
of a crying God in hopeless despair
As tears of doom raining from the sky
The time has come for all to die

I gaze at the gloomy world
In dismal shape of night
The culture of man lies bleak
In a frozen and desolate wasteland
Empty streets, fading screams
Abandoned and forever vanished
I realize, everything is gone
The funeral of all

The grand precipitation of truth
Purifies the filth of Cosmos everlastingly
Weak life, the light of a lone second
Amid the liberation of eternities
Wherever I walk the world lies in ruins
And human blood stains the ground
What I see is a dying world of misery
My vision of bliss is now absolute

At last, I can rest in peace...

This, the worlds last chapter
Everything feels so complete
Only me and soundless death remains
Surrounded by silent bareness
As I leave this aeon of sorrow behind
I enjoy my very last breath
And with a smile I walk...
