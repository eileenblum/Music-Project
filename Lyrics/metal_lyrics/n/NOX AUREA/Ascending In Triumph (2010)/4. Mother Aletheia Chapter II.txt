Even though the solemn path I follow
lies deeply concealed within worldly clouds,
and even though my eyes can not see
what dwells beyond the theatre of undivine
I believe in Thee, O' mother of abhorrent light
For I perceive beyond perception

As my colden human body shivered
I screamed in vain, cursing as I staggered
For the echoes of the world stroked into my soul
like scars of a thousand daggers

Into the garden of withering I walked
where shades of old still do haunt
Dancing into the night among trees of dead
a place forgotten, so mournful and gaunt

Where shades of old still do haunt,
a place forgotten, so mournful and gaunt

O' Mother Aletheia, I do follow
the distant and sacred voice of thine,
through the unworldly halls
I do flow deep into the end of myself

Into the garden of withering I walked
where shades of old still do haunt
Dancing in the night among trees of dead
a place forgotten, so mournful and gaunt

Thy mysteries, O' holy mother of Lucifer
are the greatest enigma of all
And as all I see and love is Thee
now the earthly shackles fall

Even though the solemn path I follow
lies deeply concealed within worldly clouds,
and even though my eyes could not see
what dwelled beyond the theatre of undivine
I believe in Thee, O' mother of veracity's light
For I dream beyond dreams...
