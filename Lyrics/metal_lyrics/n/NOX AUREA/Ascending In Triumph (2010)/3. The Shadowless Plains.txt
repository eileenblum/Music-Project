My mind wanders beyond false boundaries,
to my most treasured sanctum
A vast featureless landscape
where the forces of my desires lingers

Here, I can no longer comprehend
the illusion of life
No empty shadows wanders,
thus there are no walls

The asperity of breathing seems to lighten
as I imagine the beautiful vision of an eclipse

The hymn of absolute eradication reaches my ears
this swan song fills my heart with joy

Desolate and in myself seeking the golden depth
Rapturously immersing
I long for the day I shalt escape this confinement
the day when my constraining flesh is abolished

My mind wanders beyond false boundaries,
to my most treasured sanctum
The echoes have died,
their clear voices appeases my essence
