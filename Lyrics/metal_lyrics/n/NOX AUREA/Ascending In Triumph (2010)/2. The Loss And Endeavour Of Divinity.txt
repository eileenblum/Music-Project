Brethrens and sisters of the greatest Cause,
all thee rebelling spirits who walk alone at night
Hear my proclamation and take now my hands
Let us together evoke and give rise
to this numinous circle

For we shalt create a black magical portal,
an entrance for the great Ones beyond

Thus we must obey their summons
or vainly we will fall in despair
For they are the keys of ascension
to the hidden gates of liberty

By injustice we are enslaved
in a curse of order and time
So adherents of the greatest Cause,
now let us to this circle give rise

An entrance for the great Ones to come,
to strike into our cosmic world
An entrance for the great Ones beyond,
for this is our endeavour of divinity

We were all entrapped
within the demiurge's reflection
We were chained into blinding halls
of the creation's cloaked labyrinth
Alas, it was the loss of divinity
The loss of divinity!

"For me it is perpetual pain and shadow
and the dark night of the soul,
and I have no voice to cry, to cry out with..."

Brethrens and sisters of the greatest Cause,
all thee rebelling spirits who walk alone at night
Hear my proclamation and take now my hands
Let us together evoke and give rise
to this numinous circle
For we are "the voice of awakening
in the eternal...the eternal night..."
