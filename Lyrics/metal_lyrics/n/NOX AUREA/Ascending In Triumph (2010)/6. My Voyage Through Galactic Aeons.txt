As thousands of burning eyes
stared at me with mocking despise
from the silent distance of their cosmic thrones,
in a night sky so cold and vastly dark

Entirely I questioned this space-time illusion
and refused the shackles of matter's intrusion
So I closed my eyes and travelled deep
into other specters, so far from earth

Towards the void of spiritual tranquillity
I float among stars and nebula dust
Crossing all restraining limits, one by one
on my voyage through galactic aeons

I waken from an indistinct mirage
to dissolve all the chains of creation,
the cosmic dreams of mind
Slowly do I now disperse
into the abyss of Ain

Eternally I proceed,
into the black hole of my dream,
to release myself from the circle of time

By my purified spirit's will to emerge
with the infinity of Nothing beyond
To transcend into the Absolute,
Deus Absconditus...

"I lived in this world of darkness, for myriads of years,
no one ever knew that I was there..."

Towards the void of spiritual tranquillity
I float among stars and nebula dust
Crossing all restraining limits, one by one
on my voyage through galactic aeons...
