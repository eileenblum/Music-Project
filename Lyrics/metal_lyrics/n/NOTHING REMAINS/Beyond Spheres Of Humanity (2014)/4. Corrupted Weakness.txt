Take my hand and bury your mind
You never have control of your life

Free will is a lie
Break the chains of your slavery
Humans are beasts, annihilation arrive
Blood and hoses cover corpses of human negligence

Corrupted Weakness

Forget your oblivious present
Time is running out, choices are taken
Like a possession, hatred invades you [2x]

Break these chains
Bury Your Mind
You're so Alone
In This life

Corruption divides
Feelings and compassions

Forget your oblivious present
Time is running out, choices are taken
Like a possession, hatred invades you [2x]

Corrupted Weakness
