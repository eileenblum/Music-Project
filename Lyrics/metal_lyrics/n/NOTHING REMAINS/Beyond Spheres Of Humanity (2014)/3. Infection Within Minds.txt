No Remorse to Pain
In my mind
Suffocating sight
Of another world

Feel the Infection
In your veins

Hope your existence
become clear (become clear)
Dream is my reality
Please follow me

My body is quaking
Conquer and Divide Me
until myself go away

Like a swarm of spirits
Mist invades my chest
Forgot the fear
Forgot the fear

Prove me right now
Show me right now

My memory dissolves
All our vices flow
along my skin
along my skin

I want to know your sincerely
Just keep smiling
into the night
into the night

See your reflection
Show me infection
in my mirror eyes
Sink your vessel

See your reflection
Show me infection
in my mirror eyes
Sink your vessel

Prove me right now
Show me right now

My body is quaking
Conquer and Divide Me
until myself go away

Like a swarm of spirits
Mist invades my chest
Forgot the fear
Forgot the fear
