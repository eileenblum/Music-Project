When scars recover
We live to dream
Beyond spheres of humanity

Hold your hope
You can see the truth
Growing in my veins
in my veins

Break the walls down [2x]

Escape the fate
Beneath existence
See your mind keeping away

All illusions
Make your life come false
So take my hands

We live and die
without knowing
really who we are

We live and die
without knowing
really who we are

'Cause we're alive, we're alive
we can feel the Carpe Diem
'Cause we're alive, we're alive
Nothing can fall down

'Cause we're alive, we're alive
we can feel the Carpe Diem
'Cause we're alive, we're alive
Nothing can fall down
