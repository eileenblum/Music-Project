Cowardly fleeing
Punishments of it plight
Forgetting the other way
Death?s not the solution
Taken by gears of destiny

Slave among humans
Used by the others

Feeling the oppression
Inside us
No possibilities for freedom
Inside you

Strained working
Until the end
Taking decisions
Rising up your conditions
Never changes take place
In this hopeless world

Slave among humans
Used by the others

Feeling the oppression
Inside us
No possibilities for freedom
Inside you

There's no redemption
