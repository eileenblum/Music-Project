Do you remember?
When your fucking brain explode
The unique instant you?ve lost humanity
Bruised by bloods and shadows
Death is planted on your step
This thirst of life
Is unlimited

Ignorance
Inconcious

So short was the pain
Suffer is your state of mind
Rising up from Hell
Destruction arrive so soon
Take attention
Nightmares filled up your heart
Behold the end
Annihilated the masses

Take your last breath [2x]

Take your last breath [2x]

Ignorance
Inconcious

Do you remember?
When your fucking brain explode
The unique instant you?ve lost humanity
Bruised by bloods and shadows
Death is planted on your step
This thirst of life
Is unlimited

Take your last breath [2x]

Ignorance
