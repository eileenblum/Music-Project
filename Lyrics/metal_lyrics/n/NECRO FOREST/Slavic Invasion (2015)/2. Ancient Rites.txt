We hail powers of nature
We are heathens from the old times
We are guardians of the past
Who hail the pagan sun 

Great bonfire, in the name of Svarog
Now burns, as we hail our ancestors
The fallen ones of ancient times
Blessed be this sacred land of ours

Storms are coming cast by the Perun
We hail your presence thunder lord
In honor of yours our sacrifice we offer
For this age and ages to come

Sweet nectar of Svantevid we drink
Under his sword we march
Lead by the great wargod
We complete this circle of trinity

Now rise mighty gods of Slavs!
Our swords, our fury!
Warriors of iron will!
Desire to purify, to kill!
