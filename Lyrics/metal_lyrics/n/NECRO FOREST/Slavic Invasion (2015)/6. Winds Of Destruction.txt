They blow...
They come...
Enraged by pure hate and darkness
Winds of destruction

Burning churches, perfect vision
Clean all the plague with fire
To complete our only mission
And final desire

Winds of destruction
Crucified them all
Winds of destruction
Erase them forevermore
Winds of destruction
Christian throne has fell
Winds of destruction
Now burn in hell

Slavic hordes marches on
Crush with fear and hatred
Make them regret as they born
Everything is bloodred

Winds of destruction
Crucified them all
Winds of desturction
Erase them forevermore
Winds of destruction
Christian throne has fell
Winds of destruction
Now burn in hell

Decapitated heads on stake
Obscurity and gore on their faces
With impaled cross in the heart
We bury them in to the blazing graves

We stand proudly, honored by the mayhem
Forever celebrate Perun's thunder
Only our cry resound and shout

Winds of destruction
Crucified them all
Winds of desturction
Erase them forevermore
Winds of destruction
Christian throne has fell
Winds of destruction
Now burn in hell
