[originally by Satanic Warmaster]Nature's primal unchained energy
That is enshrined in all that exists
The power of great destruction
And creation on the crumbling remains

Satan, creator
Satan, destructor
Satan, master residing in the void
of true blackness

The erect phallus of fertility
And the horns as it's guardians
The procreation of the triumphant
And the demise of the worthless

Satan, protector
Satan, imperator
Satan, master residing in the void
of true blackness

The ashes that nourish the soil
Born from the wrathful breath
That swallows the burdening life
Is a veil brooding our reborn earth

Satan, protector
Satan, renewer
Satan, master residing in the void
of true blackness
