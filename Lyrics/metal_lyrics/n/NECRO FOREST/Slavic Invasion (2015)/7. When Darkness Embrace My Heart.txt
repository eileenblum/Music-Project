Morbid intent
Blood eyed beast
Jaws of dragon
Ready to feast

Behold nightmare
In your eyes
Screaming in vain
Mankind dies

On their faces I'll carve my mark
Deadly howl from the dark
Misanthropic quest I shall start
When darkness embrace my heart

Devour them, devour their souls
On my claws fresh gore
Can't escape from this bloodthirst
Berserker lust, the worst

On their faces I'll carve my mark
Deadly howl from the dark
Misanthropic quest I shall start
When darkness embrace my heart

Bestial night of vicious ones
Guide us under the blackened moon
Brothers show your razor claws for
None shall live and all shall die

On their faces I'll carve my mark
Deadly howl from the dark
Misanthropic quest I shall start
When darkness embrace my heart

When darkness embrace my heart
