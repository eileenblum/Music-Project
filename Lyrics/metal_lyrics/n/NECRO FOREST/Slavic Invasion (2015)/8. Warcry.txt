From the earth and from the sky
Smell of death and blood
From the smoke and from the flames
Svarog's sun upon us!

Swing your sword and feel the boiling rage
Berserker state of your mind
For there is no mercy to show
Spill their life on the snow

With no fear march as one
Day of judgment has began
Unbeaten and unbroken
Standing strong for carnage is done

From the earth and from the sky
Smell of death and blood
From the smoke and from the flames
Svarog's sun upon us!

Triumph of eternal sun
Will heal all the pain
For Slavic heart is stronger
Than pestilence decay

Perun's thunder guide us!
