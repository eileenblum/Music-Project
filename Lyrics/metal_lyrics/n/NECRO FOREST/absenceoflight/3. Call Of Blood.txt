Call...

Blood...

Through the endless night
Legions move to strike
Screams and fear everywhere
Can you resist?
Can you stop?

Call of blood, in your veins
Call of death, that remains

Call of blood, strike and kill
Call of death, stands still

Crush everything on your way
The earth is saturate with blood today
The holy temple will be burned
Chaos everywhere, hell's returned

Call of blood, in your veins
Call of death, that remains

Call of blood, strike and kill
Call of death, stand still

Humanity's falling 
The judgment day is calling
Desecrate I must 
Ashes to ashes dust to dust

No remorse!
Crush!
Kill!
Stand still!
