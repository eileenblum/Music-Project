Visions from a dream
Which tell me that time has come
To make them scream
For glory of slavs, the christian throne will burn

Oh, mighty battle horns of slavs
Let them hear your echo
Oh, mighty battle horns of slavs
Foreshadow the pagan realm

Only fear in their eyes without words
Pursuit the barbarian wolves
With their blood on our swords
We accomplish eternal victory

Endless and unconquerable our age shall be
Proudly stands by Perun's bless
With desecrated crosses and hacked bodies
The christian scum will never rule again

Oh, mighty battle horns of slavs
Let them hear your echo
Oh, mighty battle horns of slavs
Foreshadow the pagan realm

Immortal battle cry of slavs
Shall forever resound
And shout:
"The pagans have returned"
