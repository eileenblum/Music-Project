Insane howling through the night...
My skin is tense, my mind feared
Rage inside me turn my eyes red
I scream and shout helpless

Bloodthirsty creature will be released
Dark transformation is complete
When someone die
Wolf's hunger is satisfy

Lunar madness of the night
The time of never coming light
This is full moon possession
Obey your obsession

Breeding of the death
Spread everywhere
The dark one is born
Feel in your heart thorn

Heart no longer work
When you see me
The beast in cold darkness
Eating your last hope

Lunar madness of the night
The time of never coming light
This is full moon possession
Obey your obsession
