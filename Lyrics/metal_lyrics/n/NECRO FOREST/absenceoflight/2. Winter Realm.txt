Enter the winter realm
Storm and snow affects you
Hopeless and frozen
For eternity 

Oh, winter how grim and deadly you are
I'm standing with pride
You marking my scar
Oh, winter give me your knowledge, I'm your child

Come by the fog and winds
Come and everything is no more nice
Fly on your frozen wings 
Everything you touch turn into ice

Oh, winter how cold and ruthless you are
I'm standing with pride
You marking my scar 
Oh, winter give me your sword
And I will destroy plague of the world

Oh, winter come to me
Oh, winter stay with me
