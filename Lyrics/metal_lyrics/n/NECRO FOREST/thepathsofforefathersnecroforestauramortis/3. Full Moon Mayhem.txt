[performed by Necro Forest]The dreadful ones march
As moon bleeds above
The unquenched thirst 
Now rise as darkness prevails

Bloody tracks on the snow
Something moves in the shadow
Razor sharp hit from behind
It's too late... You died

As they fall on the full moon mayhem
Lycanthropy run through the veins
Sworn to the wolf's order
To create the final bloodshed

Total death to all
Obsessed by full moon spell
Massive desecration is realized
As wolf's mark arise

The final misanthropic ritual
In the name of wolf and blood
Malevolence stands before your very eyes
See the world in red flood

For the wolf empire (they will fall)
For the wolf hunger (they will serve)
For the wolf disease (they will die)
Remission from life (last goodbye)

As they fall on the full moon mayhem
Lycanthropy run through the veins
Sworn to the wolf's order
To create the final bloodshed

As they fall on the full moon mayhem
Lycanthropy run through the veins
Sworn to the wolf's order
To create the final bloodshed

Lycanthrop: Everything
