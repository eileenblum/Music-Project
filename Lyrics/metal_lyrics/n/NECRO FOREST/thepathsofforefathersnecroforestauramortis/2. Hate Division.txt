[performed by Necro Forest]Dawn of war stands 
Prepare your weapon against 
Unclean race of maggots 
Destroyed in final impact

Scorched battlefield
Hell's fire strikes down
Hate division, death's mission
Will destroy your god

Hate division of blasphemous fire
Destroying the cunts, the final desire
Blasting the monuments of the weak
Destruction of pestilence we seek

Hate 
Hate division

Die for your sin
I'm the one who buried you in
Eternal grave of blazing depth
Soon you'll meet your death

Hear the skull crushing sound 
With your misery eternally bound
Nothing can save you, you can't hide
Human waste finally died

Hate division of blasphemous fire
Destroying the cunts, the final desire
Blasting the monuments of the weak
Destruction of pestilence we seek

Down,down,down with your god
Down,down,down with your god
Down,down,down with your god
Burn damned kingdom forever

Hate division of blasphemous fire
Destroying the cunts, the final desire
Blasting the monuments of the weak
Destruction of pestilence we seek

Hate 
Hate division
