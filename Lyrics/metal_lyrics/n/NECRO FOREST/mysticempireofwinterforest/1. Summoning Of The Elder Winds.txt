[performed by Necro Forest]Howling from the tops of mountains
In the depths of pass
Silently they are summoned
The elderwinds...

A call from innerland of our ancestors  
Now rise as reign of winds

"I call you mighty spirit of mountains
Embrace us with your wisdom
Thou how blow endlessly 
Your will be done
As your realm prevails 
Our sacrifice is greater
By the Svarog's sun upon 
Carry us into the infinity."

Silently they are summoned
The elderwinds...
