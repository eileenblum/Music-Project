[performed by Necro Forest]"I summon you creature of the night
I cast this spell to lure your madness
I call you by the power of moon 
For thou shall be free"

By the might of raw anger
Bestial ritual spreads his mist
Deep in the woods, darkness grow
Chanting is done as malevolence arise 

This dreadful incantation I chant for you
To swallow every christian heart
On the war paths lead us through   
Embrace us with obscure art

Screams of victims through the night
Now are silent in the moon light
When werewolf's blood rise it's might
Temples of plague are ignite

This dreadful incantation I chant for you
To swallow every christian heart
On the war paths lead us through   
Embrace us with obscure art

Hail creature of the night
Hail unholy utopia
Hail fire and demise
Hail Lycanthropia

This dreadful incantation I chant for you
To swallow every christian heart
On the war paths lead us through   
Embrace us with obscure art
