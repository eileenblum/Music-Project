The moon and the stars in the sky
Gazed down upon us in sorrow
You laid there
Motionless in my feet
And the ground below you
Was as cold as the air above

Through the misty fields I wandered
On the path once grassy and warm
(Now thistly and frozen)
My hands cold and stained with sin
Yet my mind clearer than ever
(I would heve you back with me)

I fainted on my way to convent
Not knowing if it was because of the exhaustion
Or the painful awakening to reality
You were gone

After two full moon nights
I regained consciouness
From my torturous nightmare
And found myself alone in a dark, empty hole
So very afraid
I had to leave
