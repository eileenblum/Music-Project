The road seems to be infinte
Shapes in the horizon alway remained the same
Staring form outside,
I watched myself lose balance

I fell down to the dark pits of decadence
Took part in acts of blasphemy and filth
Only to forget the pain and sorrow
That were eating my will to life

I knew I was a slave to my lusts
But they were all I had
I knew nothing good could come out of this
COuld not help myself
I was drowning deeper in my self-pity
Slowly sanity perished
I was dying inside
My soul crying, begging for help

A struggle of spirit and flesh
Blocking my way to light
I'm sewing up the open wounds
Only to watch the burst wide open again
