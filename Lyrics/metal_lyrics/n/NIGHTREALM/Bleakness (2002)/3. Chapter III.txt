I observe my surroundings
Someone is hiding there
In the darkest corner of the room
A faceless monstrosity
With nothing but scars of the past
Watching me

Defile me
Pull me down
On my knees
Make me pray

Who is this wretch staring at me
With empty eyes
Through the looking glass
Hanging on the wall
With torn wings on his back
Sleepless

Defile me
Pull me down
On my knees
It's all I deserve
