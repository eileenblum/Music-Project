The rusty blade of this knife in my hand
Mirrors my aged and grey face
I could have sworn I saw your reflection
In the blood-stained steel

The sky unveils again
It has been so far since the last time
Feels like an eternity
Clarity rose from ashes like Phenix
Bringing hope along with him
I am coming for you

I can't feel the pain anymore
I'm not sure if this is dream or reality
And it doesn't matter
As long as I don't fall again

Waters of life
Meet the icy ground
Everything is crystal-clear now
I feel your arms
Pulling me down
So unresistable
