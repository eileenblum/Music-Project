This is the end, yes this is the end
While I watch you burn, my friend
You crawl in self-pity and selfishness
While I am in favour, you eat from my hand
But - when my luck has turned
You turn your back on me
And say that I would have done the same...

Fuck your fucking generation
Fuck your talk of re-creation
Fuck traditions - we're in charge now
Fuck the system like it fucks you
every fucking day
