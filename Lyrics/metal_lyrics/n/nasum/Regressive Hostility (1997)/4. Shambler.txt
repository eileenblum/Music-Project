Solid walls of rock surround me
Steamy lights, a ring of fire
They shoot to kill, kill for the thrill
The dance around me in the crypt of decay

Shambler - the shambler is waiting for me

The earth quakes while I break
Tension grows as I suffocate
Beneath the surface, beneath the catacombs
I have now explored so many times

Shambler - the shambler laughs as I bleed
