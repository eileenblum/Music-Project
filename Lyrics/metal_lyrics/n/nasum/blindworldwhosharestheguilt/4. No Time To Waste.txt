By the green-house effect the forests suffocated
Of pollutions and dust - the earth's desecrated

There's no time to waste

Another natural catastrophe, all animals died
A nuclear meltdown, humans start to fry

There's no time to waste

A scorched landscape that used to be green
What made the human so stupid and mean?

There's no time to waste
