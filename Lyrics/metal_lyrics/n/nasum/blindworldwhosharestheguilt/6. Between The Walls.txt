I'm crawling on my knees
I shut myself in I cannot see
The point of living in a world
Where I don't belong

I smash the glass I hold in my hand
Purchasing the theft of the forgotten dream
And realising so many thing, so explored...
But I'm shut in between the walls!

Where I live my own life
Where I think my own thoughts
Where I dream my own dreams
Between the walls!

Shouting, crying, mourning...
The misery I'm forced to witness, tears me apart...
