[Music and lyrics: A. Jakobson]

Seize the day - is what to do
Grab the moment - make what's best
Don't be still - activate your mind
Discharge the flame - turn dark to light

Swallow the fire, embody the heat

Seize the fire - the burning flame
Ignite your will - let emotions spark
Don't be silent - speak your mind
Leave your lair - end the dark

Swallow the fire, embody the heat

Swallow the fire, embody the heat
...burning inside...
