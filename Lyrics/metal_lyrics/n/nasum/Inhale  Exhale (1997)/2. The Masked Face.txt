[Music and lyrics: A. Jakobson]

Picture a masked face
Painted black with shining teeth
Unmask the image
Realize - you stare into a mirror!

Denude - the masked face
Free yourself from the illusion

Refine the reflection
Re-establish the fundamentals
Wash away the filth
Purify - your head is clogged with doubt!

Denude - the masked face
Free yourself from the illusion

The masked face!
