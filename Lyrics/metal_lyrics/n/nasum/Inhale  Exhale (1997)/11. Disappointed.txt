[Music and lyrics: A. Jakobson]

How many times have you told me that you'll get things done?
And how many times have I seen you with empty hands?
Why is it always so fucking hard to keep a promise?
How should I ever trust you when...

...you disappoint me!
You disappoint me!
Again and again!

How many times have I stood alone waiting for you?
And how many times have I walked away deserted?
I don't need your explainations they mean nothing to me
I will never trust you, 'cause...

...you disappoint me!
You disappoint me!
Again and again!
