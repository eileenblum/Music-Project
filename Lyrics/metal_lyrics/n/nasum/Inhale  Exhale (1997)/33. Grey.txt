[Music and lyrics: A. Jakobson]

Grey is the feeling, grey is my view of society
Grey is the tension, grey is the face - face of disgrace
Grey is the building, grey is the room in which I live
Grey is my life, grey is the colour of hopelessness

All is grey - pictures, shapes
All is grey - views and smells
All is grey - nights and days
All is grey - you and me

Grey is the present, grey is the future - future unborn
Grey is the reason, grey is why I stay up late
Grey is the moment, grey is every hour in my life
Grey is the silence, grey is how I feel today
