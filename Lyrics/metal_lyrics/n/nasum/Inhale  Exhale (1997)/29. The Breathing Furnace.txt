[Music and lyrics: A. Jakobson]

Burn your past on a stake
Burn you values and views
Burn and let the furnace breath
Burn, just fucking burn

The breathing furnace
The breathing furnace is you
Burn and breath...

Breath the new dawn air
Breath the wind of change
Breath and evolve
Breath, just fucking breath

The breathing furnace
The breathing furnace is you
Breath and burn...
