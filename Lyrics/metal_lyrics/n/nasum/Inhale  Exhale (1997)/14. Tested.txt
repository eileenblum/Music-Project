[Music and lyrics: M. Talarczyk]

Are you the brave one?
Would you dare to defy their cause?
Can you stand up for yourself?
Back up your thoughts
With more than just empty words?

'Cause I am here to test you
And you're about to fail
'Cause I am here to test you
And don't you dare to fail

Are you convinced of the fact?
That you're absolutely right?
Do you actually believe?
Believe that what you say is really true?

'Cause I am here to test you
And you're about to fail
'Cause I am here to test you
And don't you dare to fail

'Cause I think you're full of shit,
I think you're full of shit!
