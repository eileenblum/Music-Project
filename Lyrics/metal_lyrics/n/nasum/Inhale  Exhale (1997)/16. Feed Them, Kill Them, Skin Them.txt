[Music and lyrics: M. Talarczyk]

Take them - for what they are
Treat them - with love and respect

Their skin so desireable, so much money to make
Life will turn to profit, and you don't fucking care

Feed them, kill them, skin them
Their lives ain't worth shit!

I just can't take it - no more!
Won't let you do this to them!
I just can't stand this - no more!
Won't let you do it - anymore!
