[Music and lyrics: A. Jakobson]

You've climbed all stairs and made a career,
not thinking of what's behind you
All these years that you've been living -
would you do them again?

Punctured eyes, decieving lies
Trapped in the world that you made

The world you meet is fooled by your smile,
but inside you're not shining
Everyday another glimse of the fear
that there's no higher level

The fear you fear is drawing near
It is the world that you made
