[Music and lyrics: A. Jakobson]

They stuff my mouth with a cloth, blindfolds my eyes
But tightened ropes can't hold me back nor violence or lies

Gagged and bound - but I'm not silent
Gagged and bound - my mind still speaks

Beatened beyond recognition, revenge boils in my veins
No more silence since the weak will inherit the lies

Gagged and bound - but I'm not silent
Gagged and bound - my mind still speaks
