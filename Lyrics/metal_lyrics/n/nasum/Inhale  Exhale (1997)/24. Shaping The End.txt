[Music and lyrics: M. Talarczyk]

End all that is useless, you must be all that has won
Reach out for the fire in your eyes, glowing deep inside

For I have seen all that will come
Darkness, tasteless future, shades so grey - clouding my mind
So what? It's not as beautiful as we give it credit for
Might aswell give in for the desire to end your life...

See us as we're drowning, never offer us your hand
Only leave us helpless, crawling, while you are shaping the end

For I have seen all that will come
Darkness, tasteless future, shades so grey - clouding my mind
So what? It's not as beautiful as we give it credit for
Might aswell give in for the desire to end your life...

I fell so stupid never took you for what you are
There's no time for regret - shaping the end
