[Music &amp; lyrics: A. Jakobson]

Stare me in my eyes and tell me that you don't care
Try to convince me that you will not try to change

You are nothing - you're obsolete
You are really nothing - you're disposable

All the work and no play will surely make you numb
But endless wandering isn't the solution

You are nothing - you're obsolete
You are really nothing - you're disposable

All the work and no play will surely make you numb
You are - nothing!

Endless wandering isn't the solution
You are - nothing!
