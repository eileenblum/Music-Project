[Music and lyrics: A. Jakobson]

Go!
On your way to popularity, you will bend the truth
Every second word a falsity, to be cool, to be right

Liar! - You're shifting shape to be a friend!
But you will always be a liar!
You're shifting shape to be a friend!
But you're a fucking failure!

You're a shapeshifter and you're a lie

I spit in your face, wipe off your smile
- show the world who you are
You two-faced bastard, don't fucking deny
- that you're a shapeshifter
