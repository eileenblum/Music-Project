[Music and lyrics: M. Talarczyk]

Our perfect society, gives us food and shelter
Gives us food and shelter, takes care of the weak

Lieing - for what cause?
Raping - for what cause?
Killing - for what cause?
There's no reason!

Our perfect society, builds massdestructive arms
Educates the weak in the art of death

Lieing - for what cause?
Raping - for what cause?
Killing - for what cause?
There's no reason!
