[Music and lyrics: A. Jakobson]

Desperation - in these silences something may rise
A vampire travelling from host to host with one breath
Regulating - in the house of the wolf and the scorpion
Ancient statues transforming passion into death

Deep down in the heart of the unformed
Speak the languange of the dead
Mi him en tow! Tak ah lah!
Succumb in the heart of the unformed

Desperation - in it's silences something has risen
A Prayboy leading the ones who are left in this town
Forward! To the ini they must go
Confrontate and feel the pain because God is cruel

Deep down in the heart of the unformed
Speak the languange of the dead
Mi him en tow! Tak ah lah!
Succumb in the heart of the unformed
Death is the heart of the unformed
