[Music and lyrics: M. Talarczyk]

Release me from this anger
Release me from this pain
Give me time to think
This is too hard to explain

When all the facts are given
I sense a different thought
Seen from a different angle
Too naked to distort

Now is the time to bring out the truth
No more lies, time for you to give up
Now is the time to bring out the truth
End this bullshit, we won't have it this way
