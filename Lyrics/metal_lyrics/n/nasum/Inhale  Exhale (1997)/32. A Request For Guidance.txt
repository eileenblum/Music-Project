[Music and lyrics: A. Jakobson]

I don't know the hardcore book of rules, but I have yet succeded
Instead of complaining on my life, guide me and show me the way

Show me the way! Show me!

I don't need your advice, Mr Punk! I'll do without them
Punk is to think for yourself, not to think for others
