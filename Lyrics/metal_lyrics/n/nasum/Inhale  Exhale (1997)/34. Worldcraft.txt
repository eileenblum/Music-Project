[Music and lyrics: M. Talarczyk]

Worldcraft - complex structures, a new society
Built from scratch in three dimensions
Blocks on blocks, a new era taking form
Give it a shape, this nameless beast

Is this the answer to our prayers?
The kingdom - tear it down again!
Cheated, defeated, misled
Our kingdom - tear it down again!

Creatures - a new breed, hostility, rebirth
Mass invasion of the armed and disillusionated
Kill on command, protect and serve
The perfect society

Is this the answer to our prayers?
The kingdom - tear it down again!
Cheated, defeated, misled
Our kingdom - tear it down again!
