[Music and lyrics: A. Jakobson]

They pull the trigger, they aim to kill
Exam - condemn - destroy! They do it all for the excitement

They'll come when you least expect it
- The new firing-squad!

He pulled his trigger, he aimed to his head
Examined - condemned - destroyed! He did it all for salvation

They came when he least expected it
- The new firing-squad!
