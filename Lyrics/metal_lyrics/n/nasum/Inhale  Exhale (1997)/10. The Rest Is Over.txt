[Music and lyrics: A. Jakobson]

The rest is over, the recess is done, it's time to act
You've been indulgant for far too long and it's time to act

You must get out of this
You can't go on like this

Embullient and enthustiastic you take the first step
Exit the hibernation - enter the world of possibilities

You must get out of this
You can't go on like this
