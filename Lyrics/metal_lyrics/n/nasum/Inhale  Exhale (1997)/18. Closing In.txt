[Music and lyrics: M. Talarczyk]

Don't want to tell you lies, don't want to be false
Still I have to make you sad and break down all your doors

Stagnated - ignorant
Future is closing in

Your lives as you know them are coming to an end
It's time for different values, it's time for you to change

Stagnated - ignorant
Future is closing in

We've lived with all you hatred for far too many years
Now we will break down all your barriers and teach you some respect
