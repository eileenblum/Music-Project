[Music and lyrics: A. Jakobson]

Is this revenge, this modern, mortal plague?
Has science failed or is progress none?
No words spoken but I still hear
"No urgency - this concerns only..."

The weak - the outcasts
The weak - the worthless

Nameless white-robes exploring the unknown
Manipulating with human lives
And through this wickedness, I ask myself
Who pulls the string, who doesn't care?

Murderers - in disguise
Murders - well disguised

Last call for faith or progress
Last call for life
Nowhere to run or hide
...When science fails
