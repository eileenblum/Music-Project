[Music and lyrics: A. Jakobson]

I see the headlines of today
I see the words but I can't comprehend
I see the news as a shitcovered wall
I see lies only lies

Lies! I see lies!

I see your mouth form some words
I see it move but I can't fucking hear it
I see your mouth as a shitfilled hole
I see lies only lies

Lies! I see lies!
