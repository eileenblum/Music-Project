[Music and lyrics: M. Talarczyk]

Work hard every day, hope to get your share
While society gives you a number, a place at the end of the longest line

Why do you compete? I don't understand
Why do you compete? You know how this will end?

"But of course you make a difference, feel free to make your choice
Do whatever pleases you, but dare not to raise your voice!"
