[Music and lyrics: M. Talarczyk]

Are you one of those that doesn't ever care?
Do you think that you stand above the rest?
Are you afraid of getting dirt under your fingernails?
Never looking back, the future is yours...

You think you stand above the rest
But nothing will save you, there is no escape
What you destroy will affect the world
You're as deep in the shit as everyone else

Who will come to save you when the end is near?
Your money won't buy you air to breath
Maybe it's time to stop and think?
Realize - it's our responsibility...

You think you stand above the rest
But nothing will save you, there is no escape
What you destroy will affect the world
You're as deep in the shit as everyone else

You think you stand above the rest
But nothing will save you, there is no escape...
