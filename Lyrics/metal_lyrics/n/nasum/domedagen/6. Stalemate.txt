[Originally performed by Napalm Death]

On the path to individual freedom,
I'm met with countless obstructions.
An external vacuum distorts my observance,
sucking me to the rat race.
A weakness makes me gullible.
Constantly lured to their traps,
dismanting my motivation,
taking my destination to another step back.
