[Music/lyrics: Anders]

It's time to make up my mind
and let my opinion be heard
but if I vote against it
they say I'll enter the blind world

It's a hard decision
make no mistakes
their weird opinions
forcefed...

What's the price of independence
whatever happened to freedom of choice
do we really need a third union?
Now I must raise my voice...

It's a hard decision
make no mistakes
their weird opinions
forcefed...
