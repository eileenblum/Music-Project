[Music: Rickard, lyrics: Anders]

Our world is injured by pollutions and war
But you people in control, you don't care at all

Like scarecrows on a field
You stand stale and quiet

When will you act for humanity?
When will you let your opinions be heard?

Like scarecrows on a field
You stand stale and quiet
