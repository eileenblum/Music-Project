[Music &amp; lyrics: Rickard]

Now rise, now rise, now rise above the lies
And see the real devil in disguise
Be prepared to read between the lines
Wake up and see the shit with your own eyes

Face the truth and confront reality
Can't you see the evil eye of your society
Life is more than a "wife-car-house" dream
Face reality and one day you will see

Now rise above the lies
And see the shit
With your own eyes!
