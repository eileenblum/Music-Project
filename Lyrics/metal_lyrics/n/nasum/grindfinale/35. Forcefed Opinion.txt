[Music &amp; lyrics: Anders]

It's time to make up my mind
And let my opinion be heard
But if I vote against it
They say I'll enter the blind world

It's a hard decision, make no mistakes
Their weird opinions forcefed...

What's the price of independence?
Whatever happened to freedom of choice?
Do we really need a third union?
Now I must raise my voice...

It's a hard decision, make no mistakes
Their weird opinions forcefed...
