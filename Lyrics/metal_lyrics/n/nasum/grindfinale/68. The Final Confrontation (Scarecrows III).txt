[Music &amp; lyrics: Anders]

This corrupt society must come to an end
The dignity of the normal man must be restored
Capitalism takes its last sigh
As the fundamental values return

On the fields - site for the battle
Dethrone the leaders, dethrone the scarecrows!
The ultimate end of bureaucracy!
No more leaders, no more scarecrows!

The promises they made, we swallowed them all
We're trapped in the dream of the perfect world
As we vanish into oblivion
We will emerge again to fight back!

On the fields - site for the battle
Dethrone the leaders, dethrone the scarecrows!
The ultimate end of bureaucracy!
No more leaders, no more scarecrows!

This is the final confrontation!
This is revenge, this is the closure!
This is the final confrontation!
This is where the scarecrows face... death!
