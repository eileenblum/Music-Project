[Music &amp; lyrics: Anders]

You feed yourself with death
I can still smell the stench on your breath
You claim that it's the right way
I say it's just a fucking lie, like everything you say

You think it's different here
You think we're not that cruel
You think they feel less pain
I think you're a fucking fool

See the blood, feel the pain
See the life of an animal going down the drain
See the terror in their eyes
Now how can you say that their death was dignified?

You think it's different here
You think we're not that cruel
You think they feel less pain
I think you're a fucking fool
