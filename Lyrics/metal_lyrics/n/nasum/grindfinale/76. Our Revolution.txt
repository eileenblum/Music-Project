[Music Anders, lyrics: Mieszko]

The storm is coming, now the flesh is weak
And it's finally time for the beast to wake

Degradation of your creation

In the final hour there will be no mistakes
The siege of power for the people to take

Annihilation of your creation
This annihilation - our revolution
