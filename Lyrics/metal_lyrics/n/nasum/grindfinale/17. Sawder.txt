[Music &amp; lyrics: Anders]

Blandishments and fawning - your daily routines
Your officious appearances will destroy the scene

You can't impress me with your sawder!

Your entangling look and the misleading words you say
Have upset me badly and now you'll pay! Make way!

No sawder can save you now!
