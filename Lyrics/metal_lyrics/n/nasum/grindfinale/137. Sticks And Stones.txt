[Music &amp; lyrics: Jesper]

Speak not to me of democracy
Opinionated = incarcerated
Is that what you call justice?

What century do you live in?
Beheadment for freespeach
"Sticks and stones may break my bones
But words will never hurt me"

Yeah, right!

Speak not to me of democracy
Beheadment for freespeach
Opinionate = incarcerate
Is that your sense of justice?
