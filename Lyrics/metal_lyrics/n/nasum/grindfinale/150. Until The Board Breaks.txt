[Music &amp; lyrics: Anders]

To have the last word is your biggest obsession
Shut the fuck up 'cause I need an intermission

You pound the nail with all your strength
You pound until the whole board breaks

Talking is fun but I think you've missed the point
Listening to you is like sucking on a greasy coin

You pound the nail with all your strength
You pound until the whole board breaks

Mouth is moving, words come out, everything goes round and round
Your arguments are weak and fall flat to the ground

You pound the nail with all your strength
You pound until the whole board breaks
