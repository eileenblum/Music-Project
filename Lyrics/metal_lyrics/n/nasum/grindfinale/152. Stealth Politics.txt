[Music &amp; lyrics: Anders]

Speak! Aren't you gifted with a voice?
Do you choose to shut your mouth?
Are you tongue-tied or is your tongue way up in someone's ass?

You're a piece of shit in a three-piece suit
Shifting papers 9 to 5
You're a silent one in a world of noise
Sucking up by sucking ass

Speak!

You're a piece of shit in a three-piece suit
Shifting papers 9 to 5
You're a silent one in a world of noise
Fucking up by fucking us

Go back
