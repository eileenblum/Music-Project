[Music: Mieszko, lyrics: Anders &amp; Mieszko]

Another war has started and now all life is gone
Now the earth is crying and the judging has been done

The victims now har started the desperate fight for peace
As rebuilding is in progress, another war is unleashed

Warriors now exterminate all the life around
A silent sanguinary soil is what they leave behind

While presidents are watching and spread their empty words
The inhabitants of our planet slowly rot away

War has been commercialized and we're all gonna pay
We are those who'll witness this fucking power-play
