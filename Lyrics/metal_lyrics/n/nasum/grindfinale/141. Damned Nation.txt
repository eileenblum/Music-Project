[Music &amp; lyrics: Mieszko]

Wish you never had
Never had betrayed your cause
Hope to survive
But your life hangs on a thread, so close...

Damnation
Was it worth it?
Are you scared?
The scent of death marking your descent

Dead, you realize
You're dissatisfied
Uncomfortable silence all around
Dread to realize
What you always feared in life
The facts you still deny
But there's no way to compromise

Damnation
Was it worth it?
Are you scared?
The scent of death marking your descent

Damnation - the scent of death marking your descent
Damned nation - the scent of death marking you...
