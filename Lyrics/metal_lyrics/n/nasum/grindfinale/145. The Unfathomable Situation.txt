[Music &amp; lyrics: Anders]

Blindly searching for a way out
Confusion's leading me into the unknown
Struggling between my own crises
A conflict that tears me apart

A part of me really don't want to take a part of this
A part of me really don't want to take a part of this

Tightening the screws another round
Stretching it all until it breaks
Trying to control my own panic
I'm reaching out, can someone help me?

A part of me really don't want to take a part of this
A part of me really don't want to take a part of this
