[Music &amp; lyrics: Jesper]

Let's gather around the world and see
What is it actually made to be?
We saw the fall of empathy
Now what is it that you see?

I raise my guard
This has all gone too far
Look into my writhing eyes
What is it that you see?

Line up here for heavy praise
Queue up for hate and bigotry
You don't really trust it, I see it in your face
Accursed stark truth broken free

I raise my guard
This has all gone too far
Look into my writhing eyes
What is it that you see?

Drained of thought and care, this world
Their vision broken free
Compassion made to blackest lies
Don't let it boil in you and me

Look into my eyes
