[Music &amp; lyrics: Anders]

Been guided for too long
Had my shared place in the line
But I want to get out, I want to decline
And step out of this world

I will never stand in line!

Been pushed around all my life
Never been rooted at all
It's time to leave, time to get out
Time to tell everyone to fuck off!

I will never stand in line!
I will decline!
