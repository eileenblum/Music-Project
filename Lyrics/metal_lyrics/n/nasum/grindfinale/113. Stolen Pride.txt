[Music &amp; lyrics: Mieszko]

Daddy's son has a silverspoon up his ass
Daddy's son has never worked a whole day's worth

How can you justify their incompetence?
How do you dare to look down on the ones
that are working and slaving just to feed their young
Paying for their lives with their sweat and blood

Stolen pride
De-emphasized

We all carry the weight
We all carry the weight
In the end you'll carry the weight
You'll carry the weight of the dead
