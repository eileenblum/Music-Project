[Music &amp; lyrics: Jesper]

X marks the spot
Dig, and you shall find

Scathing, seething, we're armed and ready
Your sordid ways unfold
Leading our destruction

What lay beneath
Set the standard for us all
As the light of a new truth shines
Stricken, you will fall

How dare you claim sincerity?
I smite your callous truth
Just wait and see
Unfettered I will fallow
By all that you have said would be
Your waters weren't so shallow
While you sink down, we all have broken free

Did it have to come to this?
God damn your lack of decency
Rebuilding your destruction
Revolution - mote it be?

How dare you claim sincerity?
I smite your callous truth
Just wait and see
Unfettered I will fallow
By all that you have said would be
Your waters weren't so shallow
While you sink down, we all have broken free

So mote it be!
