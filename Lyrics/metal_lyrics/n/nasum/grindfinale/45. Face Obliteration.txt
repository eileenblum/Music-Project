[Music &amp; lyrics: Anders]

For years you have wandered around
Without getting any real knowledge
In the coil of dispair you will suffer
If you don't change your pace

Let me state out this fact for you:
Protest against the system or face obliteration!

The divine leaders are still manipulating
Your fucked up mind
Share my knowledge or drown in
Your narrowminded ignorance

Let me state out this fact for you:
Protest against the system or face obliteration!
