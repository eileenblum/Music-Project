[Music &amp; lyrics: Anders]

You were silent from the start
Never expressed what was in your heart

Silent - you can't communicate!

Tongue-tied forever, you never said a word
Always in fear of what to be heard

Silent - you can't communicate!

You were silent from the start
Never expressed what was in your heart

Silent - you can't communicate!
