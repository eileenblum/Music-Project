[Music &amp; lyrics: Mieszko]

Work, buy, consume and die
Have you had enough of the old routine?

Take out your tension on the real enemy!

Depressed? Fed up? Unhappy?
Why do you let them do those things to you?

Take out your tension on the real enemy!

I will take no more!
Authority can fuck itself up the ass!
