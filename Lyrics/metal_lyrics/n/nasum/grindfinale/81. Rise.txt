[Music &amp; lyrics: Mieszko]

Living under the pressure for society
Consumed and constrained and never free

To get anywhere you must rise

Shut in a room where the only window is a TV-set
Never realised that...

To get anywhere you must rise

Rise against their bullshit, rise against their laws.
End your passivity and rise against society
