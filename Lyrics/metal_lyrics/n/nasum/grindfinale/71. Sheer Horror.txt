[Music &amp; lyrics: Mieszko]

Do you know how many people are dying in concentration camps today?

"Stop it! I don't wanna hear! This truth, it hurts too much!
Why bother? When it's easier to forget and let them die?"

A coward - that's what you are! A disgrace for the human race!
Take action and defend their rights, or soon you'll go their way

Do you know how many people are dying in concentration camps today?
