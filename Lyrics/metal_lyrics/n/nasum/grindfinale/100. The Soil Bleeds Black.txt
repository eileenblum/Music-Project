[Music &amp; lyrics: Anders]

Lords of nature come take our lives
We don't deserve the promised land
We're ready to embrace the end
We've deceived our inherited legacy

We've slaughtered all the forests
We've turned all water black
We've poisoned all air to breath
And made ourselves undignified

Lords of nature
Come take our lives
We've raped your creation
The soil bleeds black...
