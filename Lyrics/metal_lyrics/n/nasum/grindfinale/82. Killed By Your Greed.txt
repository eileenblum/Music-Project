[Music &amp; lyrics: Mieszko]

Looking for success
Still climbing the ladder without any progress

There's no point in trying, you'll never get anywhere!

Why do you care?
Why do you wanna have your face on the cover of the TV-guide?

There's no point in trying, you'll never get anywhere!

By total media control, your life has been directed
You reach out to touch the stars - your mind will soon be erased
