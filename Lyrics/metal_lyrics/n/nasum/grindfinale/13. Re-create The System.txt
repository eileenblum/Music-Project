[Music &amp; lyrics: Rickard]

How can union ideas be in question
When the world slowly withers?

Re-create the system!

Inquiry leads to false prevarications

Re-create the system!

I feel your rope tightening around my neck

Re-create the system!

As the suction for profit drags us into the unknown

Re-create the system!
