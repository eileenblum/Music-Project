[Music &amp; lyrics: Rickard]

So take a look at our society
Computer controlled technology
Development is all that counts
Money, profit and amount
Every face is so constrained
Just so they can win the game
Infuriating religious lies
Feeding on the weak minds
The weak minds!

You're so fucking influenced by propaganda
To live your live and set your standards
Let me hear you make your decisions
Without your fucking television
And when the TV set is broken
Not a word from you will be spoken
'Cause then your mind will be like nothing
So you just might be dead - you fucking thing!
