[Music &amp; lyrics: Anders]

Do you believe in equal rights?
Do you believe in equality?

The flames of the truth...

The flames of the truth
Are licking your face
Burning your skin
Just as they should
Your ignorance
Will lead you into the fire
The flames burn higher!

Do you believe in freedom of speech?
Do you believe that everyone can speak?

The flames of the truth...

The flames of the truth
Are licking your face
Burning your skin
Just as they should
Your ignorance
Will lead you into the fire
The flames burn higher!

You live a simple life
So far away from being real
You live to simplify
The easy way out that is your idea

You suck...

Do you believe that you can change the world?
Do you believe that something will change?

The flames of the truth...

The flames of the truth
Are licking your face
Burning your skin
Just as they should
Your ignorance
Will lead you into the fire
The flames burn higher!
