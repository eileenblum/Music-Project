[Music &amp; lyrics: Jesper]

I gaze at the smoldering ashes below
It chills my mind
What once was grand
Is but destruction and cinder bestowed
It's not a haze, it's not a phase
As we slaughter generations to come
Exploit our world
One more step and we're done!
As we slaughter generations to come
One more step and we're done!

We know it as civilization
Seems more like deprivation
I shun all, give us deliverance
Here comes our bitter penance
...And I detest!

A promise to protect
Not to conquer and oppress
What a mess
It seems nothing is sacred
When the earth is at stake
...And we regress
Unconscious use of resource
People, states and fear
I feel depressed
The liars we were to be
No earth for us to see

We know it as civilization
Seems more like deprivation
I shun all, give us deliverance
Here comes our bitter penance

Civil = evil!?
