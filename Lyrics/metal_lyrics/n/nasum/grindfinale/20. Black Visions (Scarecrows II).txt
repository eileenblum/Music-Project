[Music &amp; lyrics: Anders]

Open your eyes - what do you see?
A world in ruins and a corrupt society
Is this how our future will be?
Masstarvation and sicknesses = reality!
Unified thoughts means nothing to me
As the scarecrows control mortality
When will they act for humanity?

My vision of the future isn't bright
It's a world where everything is black
Where the politicians do the best to fool you
And where society stabs you in the back

Now raise you head, and raise your voice!
A fight against the system is what we need
In the future world you won't have a choice
You will suffer as the scarecrows breed
A concrete city with programmed beings
On the last human the scavangers feed
A fading sun and empty buildings...

My vision of the future isn't bright
It's a world where everything is black
Where the politicians do the best to fool you
And where society stabs you in the back
