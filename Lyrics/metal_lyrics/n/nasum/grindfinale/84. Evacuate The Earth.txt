[Music &amp; lyrics: Anders]

Evacuate the earth! What else can we do?
Evacuate the earth! Time is running short...
No time for repentance, no time for regret
Just leave this forsaken ground
The dream about the utopia
Is just an inversion of the truth!

Succumb - the horror!
Invoke - the end!

Evacuate the earth! End all while you can
Evacuate the earth! Do not postpone your fate
Leave all the chaos, leave all the turmoil
Leave this carcass called earth
When all hope is lost, close your eyes
And fall into the illusion

Succumb - the horror!
Invoke - the end!
