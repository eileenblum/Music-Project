[Music &amp; lyrics: Anders]

The world we knew has come to an end
Bombs cloud the sky as the destruction begins

Death - hear the screams from the dying race...

The flames feed the holocaust as radiation burns
The wind of devastation turns the earth into ashes

Hell is awaiting us, as we realize
Earth is no paradise, no paradise for the damned

Death - hear the screams from the dying race...
