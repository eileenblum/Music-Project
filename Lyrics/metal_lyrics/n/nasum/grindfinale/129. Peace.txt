[Music &amp; lyrics: Mieszko]

Meaningless wars
Starving tribes
A promise of victory
Coloured with lies
A red single dot
On your tactical screen
A hundred thousand men that will never be seen

Peace can't survive
In this global climate of hostility
Peace can't survive
Why solve the problem when it's easier to kill?

A nation in need of attention
A terrorist action
As an answer to suppression
With a bloodbath displayed
On primetime CNN
There are just too many points to make

Peace can't survive
In this global climate of hostility
Peace can't survive
Why solve the problem when it's easier to kill?
