[Music &amp; lyrics: Anders]

Born and raised the clock is ticking, what will you do with your life?
Confused and scared trapped in a stalemate, destined to a life in anxiety

Life will stagnate - going nowhere!
Time to change - going nowhere!

Employed and married the clock's still ticking, is this what you wanted with your life?
Afraid of living, afraid of dying, hide your face in despair

Going nowhere!
Life will stagnate - going nowhere!
Time to change - going nowhere!
