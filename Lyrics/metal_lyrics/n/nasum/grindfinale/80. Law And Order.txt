[Music &amp; lyrics: Mieszko]

Looking for justice, it seems I don't look in the right places
The law is a joke in this system without hope and nobody gives a fuck!

When rapists get one or two years
And snatchers are brutally abused
By the cops who just don't give a fuck
About what's right or wrong

Looking for justice, it seems I don't look in the right places
The law is a joke in this system without hope and nobody gives a fuck!
