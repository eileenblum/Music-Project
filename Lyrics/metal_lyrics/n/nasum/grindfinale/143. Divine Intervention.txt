[Music &amp; lyrics: Anders]

I'm concerned about the state of the world
Where the idiots set the pace
And the people live in a haze

I can't accept this shit
I must intervene

I'm the God, I am the fucking God
Who will rip and thrash and maim
Until we procreate the sane

I can't accept this shit
I must intervene
