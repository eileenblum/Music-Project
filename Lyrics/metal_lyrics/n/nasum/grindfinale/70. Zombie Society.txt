[Music &amp; lyrics: Anders]

For many years he's been dead, but yet he walks the earth
As an evil incarnation spreading his decay

Where he goes the stench will follow of millions burnt to death
But his brain-dead corpse-disciples are the zombies of today

Force the beasts toward hell, let them taste the flames
Let's seal up the tomb forever and end this reign of hate

Where he's been boils now rupture, poisoning the air
We must now end this madness - the zombie society
