[Music &amp; lyrics: Mieszko]

Shutting down reactors
"Pure" energy for you and me?
But they continue secretly

We carry the disease
And it's your job to please
The mass demand for energy

The battle now begins
Over cities that are free
The war where no one wins
The blood-letting begins

Alarming light, a storming blaze
An accident at an early phase
Their secret now revealed

While cancer spreads the toxic rain
The masses needs remain the same
An easy lesson hard to learn

The battle now begins
Over cities that are free
The war where no one wins
The blood-letting begins

The battle now begins
Over cities that are free
The war where no one wins
The blood-letting continues
