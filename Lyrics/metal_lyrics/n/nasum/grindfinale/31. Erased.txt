[Music &amp; lyrics: Mieszko]

To be governed is to be watched over, directed,
Regulated, indoctrinated, preached at, controlled,
Censored by men who have neither the right
Nor the knowledge nor the virtue

Erased from this world!

To be governed is to be, at each moment, noted, taxed,
Assessed, authorized, hampered, rebuked, arrested.
It's to be, on the pretext of general interests,
Monopolized, extorted, hoaxed, robbed

Erased from this world!

Then at the least resistance, at the first word of
Complaint, to be repressed, beaten, imprisoned,
Judged, condemned, betrayed and finally mocked,
Ridiculed, insulted, dishonored

Erased from this world!
