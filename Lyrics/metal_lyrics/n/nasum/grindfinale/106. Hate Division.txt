[Music &amp; lyrics: Anders]

Hate division!

Victims of war - refugees from peace
The quest for reconciliation is in vain
A ruined land - a resisting population
Their future's crushed by false expectations

Hate division!

A valuable culture nearly eliminated
What was strong is now divided by hate
Armed revolution - massacre and slaughter
There's no solution in war, only suffering

Hate division!
