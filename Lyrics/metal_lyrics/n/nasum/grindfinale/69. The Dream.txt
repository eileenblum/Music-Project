[Music &amp; lyrics: Mieszko]

This is the end of confrontism
This is the end of capitalism

Maybe some day it'll happen, I'll await that day
But right now it seems it's how much you pay that counts

Natural harmony
World resources equally distributed

Maybe some day it'll happen, I'll await that day
But right now it seems it's how much you pay that counts

Maybe some day it'll happen, I'll await that day
But right now it seems it's productivity that counts
