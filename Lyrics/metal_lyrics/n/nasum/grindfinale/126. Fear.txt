[Music &amp; lyrics: Mieszko]

They've started
Without your blessing
They're struggling not here to lose
Try to get that into your head
Their piece of mind
Is just too easily overseen
I think I'll just rephrase that:
Fuckin' back off - it's happening!

How can it be so hard for you
To understand the way they feel
How can you not believe this feeling
Their taste of freedom, your taste of fear

Burning with desire
A hunger 'caused by greed
And while you're firing
You realize it's all in vain
Nothing can stop it
And now that you regret your sins
You're feeling paralyzed
While greed creeps under your skin...

How can it be so hard for you
To understand the way they feel
How can you not believe this feeling
Their taste of freedom, your taste of fear
