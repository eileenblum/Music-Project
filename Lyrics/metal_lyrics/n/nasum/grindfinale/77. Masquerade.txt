[Music: Mieszko, lyrics: Anders]

A governmental promise is just a disguise
And a bad excuse for their real intimidations
It's just a fucking masquerade!

A restrained government is just another slave
In the red-tape society that leave us all behind
It's just a fucking masquerade!

A governmental cut-down or rationalization
Is the highest form of terrorism
It's just a fucking masquerade!

A "worker's politician" is just a cover-up
For the reasons behind the mistakes
It's just a fucking masquerade!
