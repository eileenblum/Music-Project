[Music &amp; lyrics: Anders]

A bloodbath displayed
Death forced upon us
The daily drama
Blocks our comprehension

I don't believe the news
Cause it can't happen here

Faces of the suffering
Cuts me like a knife
This surreal reality
Must be a fabricated lie

I close my eyes and wish
That it can't happen here

It all seems so fucking strange
I've fooled myself for so long
We don't live in a perfect world
Another day is another death
