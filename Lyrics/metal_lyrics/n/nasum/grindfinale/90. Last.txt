[Music &amp; lyrics Anders]

Your the last in line, it's time to meet your maker
Your soulless rotting corpse now flesh for the undertaker

What caused this subversive disaster?
What went wrong with your life?
All that now is left is the last piece of your remnants

Your the last in line, it's time to meet your maker
Your soulless rotting corpse now flesh for the undertaker
