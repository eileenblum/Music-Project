[Music: Anders, lyrics: Erik Ohlsson]

The world is owned by MNC's
The slay our forests for personal gain
When the oxygen is gone and the air is black
Where are we heading? Please tell me where!

It happened so fast, the earth had enough
What happened? No one understood
Think about the world we live in
Let the environment stay clean!
