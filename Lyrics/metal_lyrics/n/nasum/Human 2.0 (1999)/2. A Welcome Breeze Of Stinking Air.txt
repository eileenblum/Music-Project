[Music/lyrics: Mieszko]

Now the balance is set
We're changing foot from left to right
Eager and with false hope
We gave them our trust

Speech on speech
Lies on top of lies
Empty Promises
The guys are having such a blast....

But nothing's changed
It is just a different set of lies
Nothing's changed
It is just a different set of lies...

Attempting to win
It's a race without a finish line
They're all relay-runners
And you're left behind

Thank you, come again
It has been nice shitting you
Improvement's around the corner
Your vote made a difference...

But nothing will change
It is just a different set of lies
Nothing will change
It is just a different set of lies...
