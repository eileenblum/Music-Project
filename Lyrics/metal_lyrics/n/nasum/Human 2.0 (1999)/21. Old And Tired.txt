[Music/lyrics: Mieszko]

Giving up, eating shit, dropping out
Your whole life, your old ideals, caving in

But you don't know that you still serve a purpose
As an ugly example to all mankind
But you don't know that you still serve a purpose
Although you are too weak to fight

Old and tired?
That's pure shit
Your mind is too weak
Giving in
For temptations of society

But you don't know that you still serve a purpose
As an ugly example to all mankind
But you don't know that you still serve a purpose
Although you are too weak to fight - fight!
