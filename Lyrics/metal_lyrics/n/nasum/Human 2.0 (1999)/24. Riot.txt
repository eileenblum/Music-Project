[Music/lyrics: Mieszko]

Look at the angry masses
Like burning flames that lick the air

Onward, forward!
Our hate is lit
We will not submit to the ultra-violence

We are on are march to reconstruct society
We are here to show you our side of reality
RIOT - burn the streets!
Feel our purifying napalm!
