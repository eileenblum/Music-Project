[Music/lyrics: Anders]

Defrag the information
Sort out the damaged
A process to gain more power
To speed it all up

Too much shit
Cloging up the system
Heading for a meltdown

Scan and find
Unnecessary blockings
Slowing down the process

Just like a damaged file
We must heal and reboot
And start it up again
To get somewhere

Corrupt transmission
Damaged information
Slaves under the error

End of file
End of life
Redirect or die

Just like a damaged file
We must heal and reboot
And start it up again
To get somewhere

Defrag the information
Sort out the damaged
A process to gain more power
To speed it all up

Too much shit
Way too much fucking shit
In the system!
