[Music/lyrics: Anders]

Corrosion
Corrosion
Corrosion

Like water corroding metal
Your world is withering
All you had you have lost
Never to return again

Your life, will rust

Particles that used to be you
Falling down like dead skin
What once shone is now matt
It can never be saved

Rusting from the inside out
Dead and dry you fall apart
You're nothing but corrosive waste
So what's the point of trying?

Corrosion... no devotion

So tied up with no devotion
Your life is falling apart
You've lost your sense of color
Everything is in shades of red and brown
