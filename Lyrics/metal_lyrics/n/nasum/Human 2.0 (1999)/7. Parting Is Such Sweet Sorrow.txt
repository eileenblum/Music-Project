[Music/lyrics: Anders]

Born and raised by your rules,
still I disappointed you
But I've always done my best
and it's never good for you

You never gave me air to breath,
you never clipped my wings
And now I've failed again
as a thousand times before

So now you see...

Now you see what became of me
The extremely black sheep of the family
So let me hear your "we told you so"
And get out of my life - fuck you!
