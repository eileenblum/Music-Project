[Music/lyrics: Mieszko]

Minesweep my soul
Ready to blow
Looks like it?s time to give in

My fuses blown
Beaten and torn
Over the edge, now it begins

You were my detonator
Two as one
Falling down
Descending into the unknown

Shut your eyes
Look inside
Shocked - but it?s too late to leave

Scream for revenge
Foaming with rage
Too late for all apologies

You were my detonator
Two as one
Falling down
Descending into the unknown

Broken hope in succesion of
Broken words I had put my faith in you
Stolen truth, so shocked by you
Stolen truth, deception in the extreme

You were my detonator
Two as one
Falling down
Descending into the unknown
