[Music/lyrics: Mieszko]

Violence - is it your answer, is it your plan?
Your heritage
A crossover between life and death
It's a must-be fan
Raging in its' cage
And I can see it coming
Now can you?

No - I play it safe
One step ahead, two steps aside
Yeah, and I forget
It was reality that made you blind

Struggling - one breath of air that is all I ask
You're choking me
And I am stripped down to the core

I am a must-be fan
Raging in my cage
And I can feel it moving
Now can you?

No - I play it safe
One step ahead, two steps aside
Yeah, and I forget
It was reality that made you blind
No - I play it safe
One step ahead, two steps aside
Yeah, it made you bleed
It made you come to sense and realize...

Start by being honest
And realize your potential
Make a bed out of colorful flowers
Plant a seed, paint a picture - it's all you!

Bury your regrets and
Cast your anchor where you like
And while you're at it you can
Bury all your sorrows
Feel you heart growing inside

No - I play it safe
One step ahead, two steps aside
Yeah, and I forget
It was reality that made you blind
No - I play it safe
One step ahead, two steps aside
Yeah, it made you bleed
It made you come to sense and realize...
