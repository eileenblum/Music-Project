[Music/lyrics: Mieszko]

Millions of human lives to sacrifice
They were born to die now they're dead at last
Millions of human lives to sacrifice
Born to die...

Wished for death all their lives
Searching for truth on the other side
Darkened souls to purify
Dead and buried...

Millions of human lives to sacrifice
They were born to die now they're dead at last
Millions of human lives to sacrifice
Born to die...
