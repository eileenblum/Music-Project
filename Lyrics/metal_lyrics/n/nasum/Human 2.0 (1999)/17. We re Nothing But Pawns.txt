[Music/lyrics: Anders]

In the world where we live,
we're nothing but pawns
A tool of their trade
A brick in the wall
- nothing but pawns

We are nothing - only tools,
disposable and easy to get
We got fucked, we are such fools,
we saw the hook and swallowed the bait

They fool us, seduce us, buy us, use us,
defuse us, smash us, kill us, trash us

In the world where we live,
we're nothing but pawns
A tool of their trade
A brick in the wall
- nothing but pawns
