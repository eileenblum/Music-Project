[Music/lyrics: Mieszko]

Dear not to defy your priorities
The overall effect is devastating

Dive into the burning flames

One choice, few words from the souls of the damned
So impressive and so forfeit

Dive into the burning flames

So what were you hoping for?
Did you expect the violence to end, did the blood seem too red?
So what are you fighting for?
All you see is the cause - the noble end
"When freedom exists there will be no state"

Lives to sacrifice, no attempts to deny
The lies served upon silver plates, now consumed

Dead - dehumanised - the lives to sacrifice
You're dead anyway, anyhow

Will you dive into the burning flames?
And sacrifice yourself to fill the void

So were these words worth dying for?
Do you even care or is it the end that you adore?
