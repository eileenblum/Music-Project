[Music/lyrics: Mieszko]

Thought you were deaf
Yeah, I thought you were blind
When you just stood there
While the idiots walked in line

In the Idiot Parade

You are taking their side
You are holding their hands
You stupid motherfucker
This must come to an end

...come to an end!

Your senseless thoughts of racial pride
Have infested your weak mind
Will you ever realise?
It's not you or them - it's us!

Protected by laws
Made by your own kind
It's the system in progress
It's the death of the free mind...

It's the Idiot Parade!

Deaf, dumb and blind
May be your only excuse
Not how much you have suffered
Not the years of abuse

...the truth is foolproof!

Your senseless thoughts of racial pride
Have infested your weak mind
Will you ever realise?
It's not you or them - it's us!

Face me
Convince me
And show me
How I am wrong, what I have started

Blame me
Seduce me
Convict me
Decide my fate and end my struggle.

Nothing went wrong
There is no one to blame
Yet no one is safe
When the idiots are on parade!
