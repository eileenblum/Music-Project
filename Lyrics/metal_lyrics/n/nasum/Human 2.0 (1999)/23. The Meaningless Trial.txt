[Music/lyrics: Mieszko]

I try to realise
Dis-romantisize
I try to take it all in

I try to clear my mind
Read between the lines
Just before it all begins

The true pacifist
I know he does exitst
But will he dare to take the stand?

Will he bare the pressure?
Survive this ugly session?
Will he make it 'til the end?

There's no justice
Not even a scrap
A meaningless trial
Has finally come to an end

There's no justice
So why bother being fair?
The time has come
And the pacifist's dead.
