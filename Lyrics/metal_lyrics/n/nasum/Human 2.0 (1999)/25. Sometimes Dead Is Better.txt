[Music/lyrics: Anders]

Your heartless compassion just tears through my flesh
Like burning red flaming blades of steel
You got it all but there's always one more pound
Cutting with precision you know what you want
Don't devide me from myself what you say fucks my mind
Got me in a tight grip but still you clutch harder
Sucking me dry by just looking at me with your eyes
Disengage me from this constant pain

Our worlds keep on colliding,
we're heading for the total collapse
So why do we bother trying?
We are just destroying ourselves
All this makes us fucking blind,
or are we just to scared to see?
What's dead can't be kept alive,
so let us just leave this be

My stubborn struggle to hold on only pushed you further away
I didn't know it killed you though you bled before my eyes
There are still things about you that I will never learn
I could never understand when something was wrong
I sense a cold shiver as everything falls into place
Nothing good will come out of this
Let's reach for the door before we cave-in
But everything will explode

Our worlds keep on colliding,
we're heading for the total collapse
So why do we bother trying?
We are just destroying ourselves
All this makes us fucking blind,
or are we just to scared to see?
What's dead can't be kept alive,
so let us just leave this be
