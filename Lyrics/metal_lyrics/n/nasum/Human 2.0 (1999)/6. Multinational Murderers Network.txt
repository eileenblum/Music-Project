[Music/lyrics: Mieszko]

A broken promise
Unmeasureable strength
Those feeble lies
Spread an awful fucking stench

A juicy profit and millions lying dead
An attempt to conceal the stench of putrid decay

A profit made from death
These huge organizations harvest lives
The Multinational
The Unstoppable
Unscrupulous
Dead

They paint a picture
And retouch away the pain
No grief, no sorrow
There was just too much to gain
Squeeze it out now
Squeeze out the last drop of fucking cash
Bury it beneath
Our very private stash...

A profit made from death
These huge organizations built on lies
The Multinational
The Unstoppable
Unscrupulous
Dead

A broken promise
Unmeasurable strength
Those feeble lies
Spread an awful stench
A juicy profit
And millions are lying dead
An attempt to conceal
The stench of this putrid decay...
