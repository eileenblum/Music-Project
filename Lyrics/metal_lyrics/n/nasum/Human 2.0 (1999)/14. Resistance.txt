[Music/lyrics: Mieszko]

Tell me what you believe in,
wage your values against mine
and tell me I am just some piece of shit
with a fucked up mind
why can't I just shut the fuck up?

Dead - but you're still breathing
A consumer of the highest rank
I wonder when you're gonna realize
that you are just a product
and you shouldn't shit where you eat!

Never free, never been
Always chained to misery
Always blind to what's beyond
the horizon, you're just a drone.
It is all so sickening
Your wife &amp; kids &amp; family
You don't care 'cause they're all dead
Just like yourself, they keep them fed

FEED YOU WITH LIES - DESTROY YOUR MINDS

Wake-up call, now you stall
So it's THEIR world, not free for all?
Finally you hear the news
A tainted picture, an awful bruise
Confusion - now the bubble bursts
It's time to hit them where it hurts
Destroy the core, melt the machine
Resistance - where it all begins!

OPEN YOUR EYES - LOOK INTO MINE

Fed you with lies
Destroyed your minds
Open your eyes
Look into mine and realise

...RESIST!!!!!
