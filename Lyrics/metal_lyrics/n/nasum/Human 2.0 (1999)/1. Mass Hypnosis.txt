[Music/lyrics: Mieszko]

Like a ray of light
Like a shooting star
They can see you come
To set free The Swarm

From a different world
From an ancient land
Will you say the words?
Let them breathe your air?

Death at your fingertips
With your venomous tongue you lick them clean

This is not what it said in the prophecy
Your are not what they thought you were meant to be
Salvation at your fingertips, precision is a must.
You are The One.
