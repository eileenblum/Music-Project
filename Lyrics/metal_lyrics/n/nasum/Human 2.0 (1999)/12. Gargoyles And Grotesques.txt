[Music/lyrics: Anders]

We don't see them, but they see us...

We're always being watched
by dark figures of stones
We cannot move, we cannot hide,
we're eaten through our eyes

Gaze into the face of the monster
Do you cringe or do you stand strong?
Step away - you might be to close
If your in their reach, all will be lost

They are nightmares in the sky
Who will take away our sleep
We're sharing the dreams
of our dead forefathers

We don't see them, but they see us
Grotesque gargoyles, they smile and laugh

Society is a place filled with statues
Always watching our moves
Motionless, but still in motion
They'll haunt us both day and night

We don't see them, but they see us
Grotesque gargoyles, they smile and laugh
