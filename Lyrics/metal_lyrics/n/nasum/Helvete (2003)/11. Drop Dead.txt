[Music &amp; lyrics: Mieszko A. Talarczyk]

A putrid stench of ignorance spreads around you
Walking in the wrong direction it seems you have no clue

Your stupid remarks pollute the air I breathe
You're a walking talking parasite on decency you feed

Your neo-Nazi "intelligence"
Seems to me like very poor defence
What do I have to do to get through to you? 
Why don't you just drop dead!
