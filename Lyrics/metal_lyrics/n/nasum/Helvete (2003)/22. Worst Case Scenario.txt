[Music &amp; lyrics: Anders Jakobson]

Years of waiting now it's finally your turn
Drunk with power, full of hate, you'll show the world how to burn
Secure your own place in the warlord hall of fame
All should bow in respect to the master of the game

At best we think that this is just a mild form of oppression
But this is it, this is the big one, the sickest of obsessions 

Start the fire, you're an arsonist old man
Let your fire rain on them, a part of your sick master plan
Kill all the enemies, make yourself a God
Then you rest, your work is done, salute your victory with blood

At best we think that this is just a mild form of oppression
But this is it, this is the big one, the sickest of obsessions
