[Music &amp; lyrics: Anders Jakobson]

Tired of all negativity
You're bored and uninspired
The time is here, the time is now
So very tired of all this rotten shit
Grasp the vision in your dreams

Turn the page, free your mind
Of the shit that have held you back too long
On you go, to find yourself
No looking back

Walk on by against the grain
Feel proud and well inspired
You have the will, you have the power
Set the focus and stand up straight
Take the first step of your quest

Step by step into the unknown
Commence the quest of your own future now

Never give in, never give up
You have to stand strong
If there's a will, there is a way
Just fucking carry on

Turn the page, free your mind
Of the shit that have held you back too long
On you go, to find yourself
No looking back
