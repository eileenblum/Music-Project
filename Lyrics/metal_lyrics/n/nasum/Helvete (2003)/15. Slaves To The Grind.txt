[Music &amp; lyrics: Anders Jakobson]

Pulling the weight
On our shoulders
Finding the strength
The lost will-power

Turning the wheel
Panting for new air
Accepting the deal
Staying strong for the slaves

Slaves to the grind!

Pushing forward inch by inch
A slow and painful process
Harder and harder, even faster
A great and wonderful progress

We're pulling the weight 
We're turning the wheel 
- We're slaves to the grind

We're finding the strength
We're accepting the deal
- We're slaves to the grind
