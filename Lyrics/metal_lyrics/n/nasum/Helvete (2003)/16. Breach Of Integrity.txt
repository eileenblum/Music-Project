[Music &amp; lyrics: Jesper Liverod]

Do this
Be that
Say this
Scream that
I'd rather watch from the shadows
And be my own

Don't give me your contempt
I already gave you mine
I won't be needing your dogma
I am Me
I am Me, it's working fine

I see through you
Your morals have the flaws
I don't need your scenester laws
Judge me - I'll judge you too

I see through you
Your morals have the flaws
I don't need your scenester laws
Judge me - I'll piss on you!

What a hypocrite!
The only 'alternative' you'll ever be
Go ahead and be a clone
Just a thorn in our collective side
Just a duplicate!
I don't care what you call 'true'
I'll do it my way, and you should too!

I'd rather watch from the shadows
And be my own
