[Music &amp; lyrics: Mieszko A. Talarczyk]

No need for apologies we all played fair
No reason to forgive nor to forget
4 years of highlife and then you die
Beaten by the clock yet you try to stay alive

Doom - the end is closing in
Just before it all begins
The end is closing in

Destined to lead yet you're always last
Strictly narrow-minded don't give a shit about the past 
Yet the future is dimmed in a cloud of gasoline
In blood red darkening you try to float upstream

Doom - the end is closing in
Just before it all begins
The end is closing in

Doombringer 
Doombringer 

Disappointed by the truth
Misery shines through you
Endless pain is all you give
Wade through emptiness for eternity
