[Music &amp; lyrics: Mieszko A. Talarczyk]

The concept of 'labour' is a new thing for man

How did it all begin?
How did we die so fast?

8 hours a day
Hasn't always been like this
We used to be free
We could roam the lands as we wished

How did it all begin?
How did we die so fast?

An upper-class invention
To put us all in chains
Enslavement, obliteration
And now we're dead

Industrialized society
A gaping sore in history
One whip to rule them all
In the name of 'progress'
