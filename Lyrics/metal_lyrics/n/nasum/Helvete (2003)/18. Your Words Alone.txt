[Music &amp; lyrics: Mieszko A. Talarczyk]

How thoughtful, how nice
A world of shit, what a nice surprise!
It really makes us wonder
How the fuck you've come this far

A heart of stone
And no brains to cover for your loss
Your words alone
Leave us wondering how the fuck you have...

...survived?!  You're as dead as dead can be
Without any conscience you harvest souls
The innocent, the guilty and the free...

A heart of stone
And no brains to cover for your loss
Your words alone
Are blinding us with your stupidity

A cold shower is what you really are
A wake up call and none of us will ever sleep no more

Shock treatment of the masses
