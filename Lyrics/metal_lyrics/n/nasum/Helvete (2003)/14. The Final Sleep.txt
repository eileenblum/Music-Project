[Music &amp; lyrics: Mieszko A. Talarczyk]

Exercise of futility
To the point of no return
Until we breathe the darkness
And welcome the final sleep

A journey through forgotten realms
Unspoken words now sung so clear
The force of being right
With all your doubts now gone

Exercise of futility
To the point of no return
Until we breed the darkness
And welcome the final sleep
