[Music &amp; lyrics: Mieszko A. Talarczyk]

You claim you're being civilized
A barbarian tribe forcing it's views 
upon a world you hardly recognize
Securing your wealth with brutal force
You call it "defence"

When will you wake up and realize
There will come a time when enough is enough
The ones you shit on, on your way up
Will surely shit on you on your way down

Defence?
Bullshit!
Defence?
Bullshit!
