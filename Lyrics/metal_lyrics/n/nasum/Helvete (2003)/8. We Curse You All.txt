[Music &amp; lyrics: Anders Jakobson]

Here's one for all the scum
The objects of our furious rage
The ones that we can live without
Those who drive us fucking insane

The Nazi scum - we curse you all!
The sexist pigs - we curse you all!
The upper class - we curse you all!
Neo-liberal fucks - we curse you all!

Those were really obvious
You all hate them, at least you should
Ironically there's plenty left
There are scum in a closer range

Bullshitting 'friends' - we curse you all!
Cheating motherfuckers - we curse you all!
Greedy rip-offs - we curse you all!
The hardcore elite - we curse you all!
