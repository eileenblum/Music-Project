[Music &amp; lyrics: Anders Jakobson]

The naked truth, slapped in your face
Pick up the remains, clean this fucking place
The brutal truth, sticks like glue
Depravity remains, dividing me from you

Challenge the passion
Climb the mountain of faith
The stale stink of ignorance
A perverted passivity not to care

Shedding skin, a hollow inside
Barred to stand, preparing for the ride
Brand new skin, batteries recharged
Ready to take a stand, time to discharge

Challenge the passion
Climb the mountain of faith
The stale stink of ignorance
A perverted passivity not to care

Along the way, you left your old self there to die
Just a wreck, scraps of what you used to be
Along the way, you found the strength to take a stand
Brand new skin, now get ready to discharge
