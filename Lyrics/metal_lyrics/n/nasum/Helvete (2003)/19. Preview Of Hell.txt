[Music &amp; lyrics: Anders Jakobson]

The worlds collide and crash outside
I feel the cold winds passing by
I'm armed and ready, so ready for more
This is my last note from the war

We never knew
We never knew what was waiting

I'm riding next to the very black death
Getting high on his stinking breath
I'm armed and ready for more of this war
I guess that's what I am here for

We never knew
We never knew what was waiting

Some they scream and cry out when they fall
Some say nothing at all
You wouldn't never believe where I've been
Or the sights that I have seen

There was blood, red and black, everywhere
There was blood, there was blood, everywhere
There was blood, red and black, everywhere
There was blood, everywhere, there was blood
