[Music &amp; lyrics: Anders Jakobson]

It's so sad, so sad to see
This farce we call equality
The gap between the sexes is still so fucking vast
The failure of generations who tried to beat the last

In the society of Men
There's not much a woman can do

It's so sad, so sad to see
Another destroyed sexuality
Beaten, even raped, laying naked on the floor
It's her fault, she's was drunk and dressed up, she's a whore!

The everlasting shame
Stuck like an ugly tattoo

History repeats itself
This has gone too far

How much can we take?
Let's make it to the history books
