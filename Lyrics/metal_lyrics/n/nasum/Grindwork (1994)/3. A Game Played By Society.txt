Trapped in the shit, trapped in the filth
Reaching out to get some help but no one gives a shit

Try to realize and think for yourself
Do not give a shit for patterns and the fucking trends

I scream out to you: "why can't you see?"
That you are just a part of a game played by society

Blind from reality, (I guess) it's easier with lies
Stuck in your pathetic pattern that you call a life

Why complain on me, I am what I've always been
I'm exactly what you see, and I know I'll never be...

...A part of a game played by society!
