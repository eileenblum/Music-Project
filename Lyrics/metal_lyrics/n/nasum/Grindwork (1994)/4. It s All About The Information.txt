The world isn't run by weapons
anymore or energy or money
It's run by little ones and zeros -
little bits of data, it's all just electronics

There is a world war out there
and it's not about who's got the most bullets
It's about who controlls the information,
what we see or hear, how we work, what we think

IT'S ALL ABOUT THE INFORMATION!
