An industry substained by our desire
to force suffering on others

Their lives for leather...
all for our fashion...
you're taking their skin...
you're taking their lives!

You fat, rich upper class piece of shit -
you bastard - strip and disappear

Their lives for leather...

How would you feel to have your skin removed
and seeing someone else treating it for clothes?
