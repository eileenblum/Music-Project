Try to get out, you try to get out,
what kept you then sure as hell keeps you now
You try to change but they keep you in line
(IN LINE) - are you your own master?

No space to control, do nothing by yourself,
reach out for help but you're in their hand

Smile when you're dead

Your ways aren't their ways, you're in their way,
with a bullet in your head you can smile when you're dead

Smile when you're dead!
