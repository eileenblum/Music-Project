Energy in its purest form
Doesn't matter where it's from
Feeding of the light
Grinding it to dust

A huge vibrating mass
That is ready to explode
Feeding of the light
Grinding it to dust

We're just particles
With guilt and shame
We're just particles
With ourselves to blame

Energy in its purest form
Doesn't matter where it's from
Feeding of the light
Grinding it to dust
