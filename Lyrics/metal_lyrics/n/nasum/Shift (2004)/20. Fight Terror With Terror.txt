It looks so hard
To lie straight into their eyes
Just like a robot
Only colder, your circuits have been burned

I see you walk through fake fires
For those you say you love
Their hopes built upon a pile of lies
Craving justice be done

All praise to our mighty leader
Self-proclaimed servant of truth
The bearer of this holy sword
Decapitating the youth

I see you walk through fake fires
For those you say you love
Their hopes built upon a pile of lies
Craving justice be done

Fight terror with terror...
