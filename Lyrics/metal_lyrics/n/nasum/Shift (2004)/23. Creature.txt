The first you see is that cunning smile
Then you see what's beyond those shining teeth

A wolf in human skin
A creature of the night
A demon with a sickening thirst
Consuming all the light

The first you see is that cunning smile
Then you see what's beyond those shining teeth

A statue made of steel
A being that cannot die
A demon with a sickening thirst
Sucking me dry of life

The first you see is that cunning smile
Then you see what's beyond those shining teeth
