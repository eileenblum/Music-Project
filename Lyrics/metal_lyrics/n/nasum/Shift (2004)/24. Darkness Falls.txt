It came alive in the wreckage
It broke all shackles ever forged
It came so close to the carnage
It carried out remains through the visions
of silence, starvation and subjugations

To bring us back to life
To unveil the dark

It fought for us in the battles
It overpowered every evil force
It gave us strength when it mattered
It showed the way through the divisions
of hatred, damnation and subterfuge

To make us whole again
To unveil the dark

When darkness falls the earth will quake
Through the cracks we'll see the light
When darkness falls we must awake
We can't give up, we have to fight
