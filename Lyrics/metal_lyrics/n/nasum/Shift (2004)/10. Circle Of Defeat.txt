A race of rapists, seeing to its needs
Gathering with no control
Community on speed
- Circle of defeat

Overpopulated by the human breed
On the verge of collapse
Too many mouths to feed
- Circle of defeat

Preparing for the last dance
One thousand points to prove - With hate..

Grown out of control
Proportions too extreme
Play within the circle of defeat
Mankind is about to lose..
