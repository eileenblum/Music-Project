Surprise, surprise
Now you see through all the lies
It is there before your eyes
The degradation of human lives

Is truth on display
In papers and on the news today?
Is everything OK?
Hardly - it's all just a fucking play!

What you see is their final cut
Real life censored shot by shot
So realize that truth is hacked up by knifes

Do you trust the news?
Do you buy their made up views?
Let me ask you: what's the use
Of a media you cannot choose?

Hail to the TV-screen!
So many truths to choose between
All the blood and all the screams
Collected as deleted scenes
