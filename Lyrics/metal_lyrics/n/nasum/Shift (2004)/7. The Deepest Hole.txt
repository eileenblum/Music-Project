Do what you want but don't come near
You don't want to see what it's like in here
The deepest hole you'll ever see
Right in front of you - Inside of me

Keeping my cool but there's a war inside my head
All living things around me seem to be dead
Looking forward to a day that's coming sooner than you know
When my ego takes over and lets all my blood flow

Follow me down and you will see
That self destruction sets me free
The longer the way, the harder the fall
And down on the bottom you will see me crawl

Keeping my cool but there's a war inside my head
All living things around me seem to be dead
Looking forward to a day that's coming sooner than you know
When my ego takes over and lets all my blood flow
