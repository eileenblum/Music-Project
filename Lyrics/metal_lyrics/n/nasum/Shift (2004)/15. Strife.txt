Don't you change a fucking thing
These are hostile waters, unbroken lands
Shocking truths uncovered within
All your prophets are soon to be dead

Blood for blood - it ain't always as it seems
In your picture perfect society
Existing only in your dreams
Blood for blood it ain't always as it seems
With no violence, hate nor grief
Existing only in your dreams

No hope for society, it's doomed
With the likes of you bringing it to its knees
Sucking it dry of humanity
Corrupt morale, blind hatred's all there is

Blood for blood - it ain't always as it seems
In your picture perfect society
Existing only in your dreams
Blood for blood it ain't always as it seems
With no violence, hate nor grief
Existing only in your dreams

... There's no hope for society
