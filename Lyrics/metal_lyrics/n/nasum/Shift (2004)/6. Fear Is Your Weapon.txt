Voice of hate spreads its wings
Moves quickly through the air
Fuelled by greed it sows its seed
In weakness and despair
Bit by bit, makes you scared shit
Of life in "poverty"
Just like acid it consumes
All morale and dignity

Fear is your weapon, it's the key
Without it your rule's dead
Hate's the glue to seal it all
Your defence's now complete

To strike first and to strike hard
It is your recipe
Your voice of hate starts trembling
Your doom soon you will meet
