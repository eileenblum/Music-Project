Under submission for a long time
For a thousand years
My soul is starting to rot
My work is done here
I've shed my share of blood, sweat and tears
I'm leaving this melting pot
You come to stop me
To convince me that I can't escape
I'm tired of being your rat
Armoured with reasons, threats and lies
But It's much too late
I'm about to unleash my wrath

I won't accept this life
A victim of your oppression
To be enslaved and sell my soul to the other side
Never be your fucking puppet

I've tasted your fist
And felt your whip burning on my skin
I have dealt with the pain
The more you hit the more you fuel
The anger is boiling within
Your failure I will sustain
I've been your workhorse
And now it's time for this horse to kick your head
I'm pounding my way out
So step aside, get out of my way
If not you'll end up dead
Or at least know what true pain is about

I won't accept this life
A victim of your oppression
To be enslaved and sell my soul to the other side
Never be you puppet on a string

I won't accept this life
And fall into a dark depression
To be a slave, cast in chains, always forced to hide
Buried under bricks of guilt

I have tasted your fist
I have dealt with the pain
Rip my back with your whip
The pain is my gain

I won't accept this life
A victim of your oppression
To be enslaved and sell my soul to the other side
Never be your puppet on a string

I won't accept this life
And fall into a dark depression
To be a slave, cast in chains, always forced to hide
Buried under bricks of guilt
