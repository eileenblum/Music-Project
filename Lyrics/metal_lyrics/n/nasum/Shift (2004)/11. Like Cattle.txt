A colony of maggots
This place isn't worth its name
Useless disgusting creatures
You're all the fucking same

Govern us like cattle
Treating people like dirt
But one day it gets back at you
The tables will be turned

Slow down, give it a minute
Put yourself in his shoes
He's the one who's hurting
He's here to get help from you

Don't give him any bullshit
He wants to see you burn
'cause one day it get back at you
The tables will be turned

You can't kill him
He won't die
This is his choice
His last goodbye

A colony of maggots
You're all the fucking same
