You're such a whore!

Criticism - can't get to you
You just don't give a shit
It's all for you - nothing for them
They'll never see the difference

With all hope gone there's just one thing to do
Decisions
A simple choice to rid ourselves from the likes of you
Decisions
With all hope gone there's one stand left to make
Decisions
A simple task, if you've got what it takes

Dead but dreaming - your state of mind
If you can call it that
And would you believe - your time is up
Now there are decisions to be made

With all hope gone there's just one thing to do
Decisions
A simple choice to rid ourselves from the likes of you
Decisions
With all hope gone there's one stand left to make
Decisions
A simple task, if you've got what it takes

You're such a whore
Your "loyalty" is a fucking joke
Just pure cash flow
Seems to me what this is all about
You see, to me you're the smallest man to walk this earth
A "failure" from birth
