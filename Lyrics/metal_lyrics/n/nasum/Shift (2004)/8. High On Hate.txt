Your pack of wolves is out for blood and looking for an easy pray
To fight and slay the innocent, agenda of today
So you hate, hate, hate, hate and then you hate some more
And then you kick him in the head

So you're getting high on hate and violence
Looking for a quick fix to get off
Never looking back just fall into the ignorance
And devote yourself to terror

Concrete jungle emperor, you rule your pack with ball and chain
You will never stay to rest until some punks are slain
So you hit, hit, hit, hit and then you hit some more
Until the poor fucker's dead
