He'll point out a place where it will happen
A spot that people will visit and fear
He'll take you there on a rainy day
And give you he final decision

Never made it further than this
Never tried or had the chance
Feels like being cut in a thousand pieces
Now he's getting closer to his final destiny

Closer to the end
Closer to the end

His last hour is finally here
He'll see you on the other side
He'll be waiting for you there
