I have seen the most beautiful light
Since my birth It's been possessing my mind
I've lashed myself, I have opened my veins
Cursed my blood in grief

As a shadow of death, the reaper from the tales of past
I've been lurking in the shades of Thy creation
Feared by most, hated by all, loved by none
A destiny in solitude

[CHORUS]
Pariah I am, rejected by my race
I shall triumph at last
I damn myself to fire eternal
And on the day of commotion I shall rise
And walk into my sulphur kingdom
Entering the brimstone gate

I hate the soil I walk, despise the earth that gave me birth
A hungry yearning for the homecoming at Lucifer's domain
And now the portals open wide, am I a fool if I not try?
To enter realms of dark supremacy through sorcery

[REPEAT CHORUS]

I call on hell, arise from your dwell
And grant me the gift of which I pray
To enter the gate, at last seal my fate
My unhallowed father to greetâ¦

[REPEAT CHORUS]
