[Re-recorded. Originally from "Vittra" album]

Crawling in grief
across the distant fields
I am the desire of which engraved thee...
The formation was set
An enormous storm arouse
As the thirteenth night ablazed
with its web of obscurity
Oh, you glorious blackened
infernal screaming belle
Reveal the name,
unleash the path for bereavement
I have found the key
The key to the ancient flame
Awaiting the sight to dwell in mournful immortality
Like a breeze I levitate, only lead by the owl's wisdom
We followed her majestic sleep
so majestic and delight
Her weeping - touched me, caressed me
Her weeping - screamed and longed for me
Her weeping - gave me all her might
Her weeping - her weeping enthroned me
I am the desire of which branded you...
Into the glowing mist
Her moanings tore my cloak
Out from her empty veins I emerged with wrath and lust
My blood in her mouth I saw the passion
The cold passion to become what she became
Her weeping - touched me, caressed me
Her weeping - screamed and longed for me
Her weeping - gave me all her might
Her weeping - her weeping enthroned me
I shall remain, forced to meet the dawn
Bleeding widow, I belong to her
The clouds were black as the starless night
For sunset I yearn, dusk you mysterious
