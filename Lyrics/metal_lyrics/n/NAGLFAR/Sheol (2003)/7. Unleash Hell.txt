I've seen the place where they meet, I know where it lies
Where ancient demons gather, where angels die...
The darkest pits of the abyss, where flames burns bright
Where satan reigns in terror, there's eternal night
I invoke the elder to lead me, into that place
Drain myself from blood, and drown in sulphur grace

I read the signs and blackened the earth with the magic of mine
I saw the gates of hell open wide...

In the depths I arise in fury, I'm led through hell
We perform unspeakable deeds, we're the ones who fell
In my hands the blades of death, I wil take your life
Then slit your throat, with lucifer's knife
I'm crowned with fire, await my final turn
Perish in flames, burn... burn... burn!

A land of darkness, I saw it in a dream
A desolate landscape, where evil reigns supreme
Give to us your life, I lead you to that place
Of non existing light, beoynd time and space
I'll take you to the place where they meet, show you where it lies
Where satan's soldiers gather, where christians die
Deep in my subconsious, my enemies fall prey
The twisted and the wicked, serve me and obey

I read the signs and blackened the earth with the magic of mine
I saw the gates of hell open wide...
