Humanity what have you ever done for me?
Denounced and cursed since my birth for I am not like thee
A proud descendant of the ancient seed
Driven forth by the screams of my enemies
I am the plague that shall grace you with an early grave
Exterminate - bring you all into damnation
In an orgasmic rush of pain I mark my coming in crimson strays

Fools! I shall rid myself from the thorns pierced in my side
The weak laments of your wounded shall be my crown
Anointed in their tears... sweet as wine are they

A waste of flesh is the only thing you are to me
The time has come to destroy your simple entitles
A filthy pack of liars and thieves
Crawling in the stench of your own self-deceit
I am the predator and you are all mine to claim
Hunt you down unto the point of extinction
A genocidal warmachine
Wreaking chaos upon those who dare to challenge me

I am vengeance incarnate, your futile world I shall desecrate
I bear the mark of all demons like an aura that drips of venom
I am the bringer of the final war
Your god lies dead in his own shit and gore
Rest assure that all of you will die
You insolent fools shall breath no more

Hatred burns within my veins towards your wretched kind
I spread my creed of suffering in this bloodbath so divine

I shall cleanse the earth from the worms of the human breed
Revel in the blood of my sworn enemies
Grind their bones into the dust... bloodlust!

Humanity what have you ever done for me?
Denounced and cursed since my birth for I am not like thee
A proud descendant of the ancient seed
Driven forth by the screams of my enemies
I am the plague that shall grace you with an early grave
Exterminate - brought you all into damnation
A genocidal warmachine
Grinding down all of you who dared to challenge me

Hatred burns within my veins towards your wretched kind
I spread my creed of suffering in this bloodbath so divine
No mercy is shown for the weak in this blood-drenched fatal spell
Tear the flesh off from their limbs and send their souls to hell
