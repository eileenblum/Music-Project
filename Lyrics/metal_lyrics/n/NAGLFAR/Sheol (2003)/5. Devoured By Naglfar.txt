Skin, torn from the flesh of the petrified
Drenched by death and absorbed by its coagulating wood
When the final nails falls into its place and the devil stands by the helm
Then, the howling winds of damnation shall whine...

Everywhere sounds the moanings from countless burning souls
Screaming in hate and pain, prepared to row into the final flames
As if shredding the sky, the mast reaches high...impaling the clouds
Raised is the flag of war, onwards to hel

Onwards to hel!

The world implodes in a sphere of chaos
As naglfar devours us all, we're facing the eye of ragnarok

Stormwinds wail, man has failed
Through the scorching flames of destruction we sail
Apocalyptic signs fulfilled in this holocaust tale
See the fires in fenris' eyes
The seas now churns as the serpent writhes
The fate of midgard sealed with the stench of the funeral pyres

The sail is set for the south, leaving a world in havoc behind
And the dragonhead's eyes spies after the very last land to extinct
The bonecovered prem splits the bloodfilled waves,
And the keel crushes the untouched shore with its rage

The world implodes in a sphere of chaos
As naglfar devours you all, face now the eye of ragnarok
