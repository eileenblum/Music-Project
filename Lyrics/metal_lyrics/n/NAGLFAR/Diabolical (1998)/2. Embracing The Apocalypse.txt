Scorching heat brings tears to my eyes
As I follow the shadows
Down below through the moonlit abyss
Riding the winds of damnation
Posessed by the hell-fires
Enthralled by its glow
Receiving sulphur salvation
As I hear the crying voices of countless lost souls

Embracing The apocalypse

The heavenly realms once divine
Will crumble to dust as I return with fire
Punishment in its purest form
Cleansing this world with my powers newborn

Lamentations from the blessed
They're lying in their graves
Pale white cheeks and broken wings
With their virgin hearts impaled

The sweet sound of angels crying
Descends from above
Their bodies torn, ripped from wing to wing
Saturate the Heavens with Their Blood
Posessed by the hell-fires
Enthralled by its glow
Unleashing sulphur salvation
As I hear the crying voices of countless lost souls

Spheres will collide in cascades of fire
That Open the gates to ancient realms
From beyond the stars and the abyss that yawns
The cursed gods are returning from their graves

It's the dawn of The Apocalypse...
