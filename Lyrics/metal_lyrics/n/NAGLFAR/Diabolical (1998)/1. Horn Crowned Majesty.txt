Oh, glorious morning-star, my pridefull light
Cast down in the abyss lord of fire, lord of night
Unveiled in a vision
Poison my heart and soul
Come forth and set your child free
Kill all once pure inside me

You call from shadows
You haunt me throughout my sleepless nights
The demons nightsky prophecy
My soul is theeâ¦
Horn Crowned Majesty

Oh, beautiful nightshade, lightbearer so bright
Great father of death and sin, transform day to eternal night
Come forth through the shadows
Fill me with hate and pain
Infernal masterplan
Set free a soul insane

I call unto thee Thanatos
I rest in your embrace Hypnos

Blackhearted faceless
Thy name is might
Bringer of storms and plagues
Lucifer, angel of light
Darkest of sorcery
Complete my destiny
Fill my heart and soul

Horn crowned Majesty...
