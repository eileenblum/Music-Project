A chilling wind grasp my soul as I walk through the twilight gates
Choirs of grief are heard from the spirits of the ancient breed
Now I know what lies beyond, now I know my fate
To dwell in the fathomless depths of eternity

Into the cold voids of eternity

Landscapes clad in the frozen veils of dusk
Spiritual forests and naked fields - they greet me infernally
And so I saw demonic forces rising from the chasms below
Once dreaming but now awake, as they storm out through the gates

Bewitched by their splendour I soared with the foul
Carried by their demon wings
Darkness embraces me, with stygian supremacy

Into the cold voids of eternity

Witchadorned - chaosspawn - mighty ones grasp this world with hate
Scorch the slaves with the flames of your burning eyes
The weak shall mourn and weep as they squirm upon their stakes
Pain enthroned in a blaze of everlasting fire
