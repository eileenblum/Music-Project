I stared into the broken mirrors of the universe
Dragged further unto the grasp of obscurity
Called by voices, called towards sin
As a black shape of death he sweeps across the land
Leading mankind into damnation
Mother earth screams out in vain...

...as we desecrate her clean soil with evil
The mighty mountains tremble and fall
and light is no more

A shape of black ripps the sky
The spawn of infernal empire, on demonwings he rides
He masters the storm and the rains
Diabolo, the chosen, the tribes of earth shall praise Thy name

I have seen the earthly gardens of blood
seen the proof of his might
New-born children unaware of the dark eyes of the night
As a black shape of death he sweeps across the land
Mother earth is extinct, behold the prince of pain

See the dawn of Satan's rise
