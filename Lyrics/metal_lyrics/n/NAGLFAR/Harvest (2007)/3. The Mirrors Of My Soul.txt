I was alone, blinded, unaware
Then their voices came near, now inside my mind they're always there
Telling me what to say and do
Guiding my path, carrying me through

Now my words cut like blades of anger
Gospels of the night, sung under the northern light
The thing that once was me is no more human inside
I am lost, I am dead yet alive

[Chorus:]
My eyes, the mirror of my soul
Black, empty, senseless and cold
I've lost the lust for life - leave me alone
I will exit this existence - I am going home

For me there's no tomorrow, for me there's no today
My work is done, I will walk away...

Deeper into darkness, deeper I fell
When I close my eyes I see myself burn in hell
Anointed in blood, crowned by the damned
The tongue of doom, forever I am

I am a demon, an angel, the voice of the insane
Messenger of light and bringer of pain
When my inner voice command I obey
It controls me, like a master his slave

[Chorus]

For me there's no tomorrow, for me there's no today
My work is done, I will walk away...

I was alone, blinded, unaware
Then their voices came near, now inside my mind they're always there
Telling me what to say and do
Guiding my path, carrying me through

Now my words cuts like blades of anger
Gospels of the night, sung under the northern light
The thing that once was me is no more human inside
I am lost, I am dead yet alive

[Chorus]

For me there's no tomorrow, for me there's no today
My work is done, I will walk away
Iâm going home
I walk away
