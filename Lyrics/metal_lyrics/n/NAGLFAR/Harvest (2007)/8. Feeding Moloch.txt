Scornful cancer of the earth, I challenge thee
Strong as the tallest mountain,
I will not break
The blackness in my putrid heart,
You cannot see
Born unto this filthy world
For no reason but one: to kill your breed

The hunt is on, the scent's been caught,
Now I stalk my prey
Whipped into a murderous state
With halos pure and free from sin
Now little piglet let me in

I will steal your young from the cradles
Where you thought that they were safe
From their peaceful sleep and into the night
Towards the blood-drenched realms to feed
The flames
To feed the flamesâ¦

[Chorus:]
Rend the flesh
So sweet and innocent
I heed to your call (I'm burning them all)
Feeding Moloch

Moloch, oh Moloch I call upon thee
I bring you gifts of atrocities
The sound of breaking bones
And the grinding of teeth
Moloch has awoken to feed
Devourer of infants come forth and bless me
With this killing spree I aim to please
Your spiritual essence now embodied in me
The blood of babies smeared on my cheeks

The finest piglet of them all
His severed head nailed up on my wall

I will steal your young from the cradles
Where you thought that they were safe
From their peaceful sleep and into the night
Towards the blood-drenched realms to feed
The flames

[Chorus x2]

Feeding Moloch [x3]
