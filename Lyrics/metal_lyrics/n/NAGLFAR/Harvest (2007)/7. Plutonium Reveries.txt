Oh glorious father I call upon
Your blinding winds
Engulf this world with your nuclear fire
Come forth and end this charade
This travesty known as humanity shan't prevail
The empty void is what I desire

Missiles shall fly
Upon the black wings of destiny
Brought forth by artillery
Into the womb of mankind

[Chorus:]
Punishing fire I greet thee
Come silence this world with your roar
Plutonium reveries - open damnation's door
Punishing fire I greet thee
Come silence this world with your roar
Plutonium Reveries - and prayers of war

Radiant demon come cleanse me with your acid rain
Pollute this earth with you poisonous breath
Come forth and end this charade
This travesty known as humanity shan't prevail
Unleash your venom and bless us with death
Bless us with fear [?]

[Chorus]

Missiles shall fly
Upon the black wings of destiny
Brought forth by artillery
Erasing mankind

Punishing fire I greet thee
Come silence this world with your roar
Plutonium reveries - open damnation's door
Devouring flames I beseech thee
Ensure life to return no more
Plutonium reveries - and prayers of war
