What is wrong, what is right?
I worship the night
Into the darkness I wander
Bathing my skin in the full moon light
In this my final hour, in this my final rite

I hunger for the eternal silence
To drown in the perpetual sleep
To take control and to finally seal my fate
All living fills me with hate, so deep...

[Chorus:]
I walk alone - the darkest road
I walk alone...
I walk alone - life dethroned
I was born unknown, I die alone...

What is false, what is true? Deep within you
When everything comes to an end
Praise it, embrace it, the everlasting night
In this final hour, in this your final rite

[Chorus:]
I walk alone - the darkest road
I walk alone...
I walk alone - life dethroned
Born unknown, die alone...

What is wrong, what is right?
I've chosen the night
Into the darkness I wander
Bathing my skin in the full moon light
In this my final hour, in this my final fight

[Chorus:]
I walk alone - the darkest road
I walk alone...
I walk alone - life dethroned
I was born unknown, Iâll die alone...

I walk alone
Life dethroned
I walk alone
Life dethroned
I die alone
