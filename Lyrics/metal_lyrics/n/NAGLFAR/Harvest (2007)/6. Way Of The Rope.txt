With each single breathe, I pray for death
I curse my day of birth, I hate this stinking earth
I walk the path of self-destruction
Just like your worthless kind, I too was blind
But now that I'm awake, this world fills me with hate
I've cast aside all false illusions

No more a servant nor a puppet on strings
The time has come for rebellion
This burden has for far too long weighed heavy on me
Release my soul through a rope and a tree

With each step of mine, I cross the line
Into where light is dark, and death is the spark
That ignites my satisfaction

Oh to enter the sweetness of oblivion

[Chorus]
Dark is the path that I wander
I curse your prophets, these proclaimers of hope
My mind is set, I am finally free
I shun this mortal coil and choose the way of the rope

On this my final day, I walk away
My body hanging cold
All hail the gallow's pole
The rope entwined brings me salvation

[Chorus:]
For the eternal sleep I hunger
This existence I can no longer cope
It's time to exit, I shall cease to breathe
With a snare around my neck I walk the way of the rope
Dark is the path that I wander
I curse your prophets, these proclaimers of hope
My mind is set, I am finally free
I shun this mortal coil and choose the way of the rope
â¦the way of the ropeâ¦

No more a servant nor a puppet on strings
The time has come for rebellion
This burden has for far too long weighed heavy on me
Release my soul through a rope and a tree
No wish for immortality
But for the eternal black and tranquility
For a cold dark place where life is not
And a shallow grave where I shall rot

[Chorus]
