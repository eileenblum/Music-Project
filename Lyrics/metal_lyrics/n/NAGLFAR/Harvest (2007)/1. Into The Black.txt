I'm dying from within
Is this the end of the road that I've traveled in sin?
Many are the times when I've shed my skin
But I can't escape this battle, this one I can never win

You follow my commandments, but do you read between the lines?
I'm trapped in a pit where no light ever shines
In solitude my prayers came through
I damn myself, this is me teaching you

[Chorus:]
Watch me, see how I suffer and die
Death is my shadow, this is my goodbye
Don't want to live no more, life is a lie
So I hurt myself, watch my veins run dry

I'm trapped in this inner hell
I once chose to fall and I fell
Hiding from the world alone in my shell
I think people know what I don't dare to tell

Hear my screams, these agonizing cries
I'm standing right in front of you, you watch as I die
I hate myself, and I hate most of you too
I spit at the mirror, reaper now lead me through

[Chorus]

I'm trapped in this inner hell
I once chose to fall and I fell
Hiding from the world alone in my shell
I think people know what I don't dare to tell

[Chorus]

Watch me, see how I suffer and die
Don't want to live no more, donât want to live no more
So I hurt myself, watch my veins run dry
