Hark to my voice, I speak with serpent's tongue
I've denounced the mindless flocks to take the final plunge
Into the secret pitch black depths, where burning fury reigns
That special place within myself of hatred, rage and pain

I've unleashed the beast, and now I come for thee

I am the force, bringer of your demise
With the fury of a thousand storms I'll end your feeble cries
I'll take away your dreams, your worthless lives I'll reap
Now hear these words that heave the earth while the cattle mourns and weeps

Death's scythe shall sing - embrace the suffering

[Chorus:]
Misanthropy so deep in me
I hate every single one of you, can't you see?
So bleed for me, please die for me
Odium Generis Humani

Death's scythe shall sing - embrace the suffering

Misantropy â embrace the suffering

[Chorus:]
Misanthropy so deep in me
I hate every single one of you, can't you see?
So bleed for me, please die for me
Odium Generis Humani

My wish for thee, death and disease
And not even then shall you be free
So bleed for me, please die for me
Odium Generis Humani

Odium Generis Humani [x4]
