Behold the crown of creation
Worthy of nothing but scorn
Failed abortions that never
Should have been born
Liars
Two-faced, spiteful and vile
Your true self well hidden
Behind a poisonous smile

Deceiver
No deed shall go unnoticed,
Unpunished nor be undone
The hope for reprisal is what
makes my body go one

Kind words that reek of betrayal
From tongues that drip of lies
One hand reached out while the other
Is hiding a knife

[Chorus:]
Deceit for a lifetime has taken it's toll
An emotional void, I feel numb and cold
You're all dead to me now,
And has been for long
The time has come to reap what you've sown

(Scum)
I detest all of your kind
Forever you'll be the greatest travesty
The essence of humanity
You failure
The equivalent of slime
A tragic breed, not more than a disease,
So stay away from me

[Chorus]
Deceit for a lifetime has taken it's toll
An emotional void, I feel numb and cold
You're all dead to me now,
And has been for long
The time has come to reap what you've sown
This harvest is heavy and bitter it seems
In tainted soil it has grown
These words are it's venom and my gift to thee
So choke on them now and leave me be

A sorry excuse for a human
A complete and utter disgrace
Not having the courage to speak up to my face

[Chorus]
Deceit for a lifetime has taken it's toll
An emotional void, I feel numb and cold
You're all dead to me now,
And has been for long
The time has come to reap what you've sown
This harvest is heavy and bitter it seems
In tainted soil it has grown
These words are it's venom in it's purest form
So choke on them now, yes harvest the storm
