I'm the One to whom you should pray.
The Voice inside that never goes away.
I am the Demon that haunts your Sleep.
The slithering Terror that dwells in the Deep.
And in the cold black Dephts of your darkest Dreams.
I'm the Whisper, I'm the Screams.
That moves you towards an early Grave.
An Exit with the Razorblade.

Death Dimension Phantasma.
In Shadows cloaked I stalk your World.
The hidden One.
The last who became the first.
The one of the Night, the Cursed.

Let the Sound of my Voice be your beacon.
Let it lead you astray.
Away from the World of the living.
So come and join Me in the everlasting grey.

Why endure n Existence so bleak?
Why even bother it all?
Just take my Hand and I will guide you through.
Far beyond Death's Dimensions we'll go.

Welcome to the bleakness.
The dark Night of the soul.
We've made a Pact with Death.
There is no Return.
For those who are 
Predestined to burn.

And in the cold black Depths where there is no Hope.
I will lead you upon the Way of the Rope.
That moves you away from the Lies of Life.
An Exit with A Shotgun Smile.

Death Dimension Phantasma.
A Spirit of the Netherworld.
The broken One.
The last who became the first.
A Guide to your End.
So release your Flesh and descend.
Into the Depths and into my Domains.
Here, where no Life can dwell.
Spirits of joined through Self-destruction.
In our own personal Hell.

Trapped in A World so bleak, you seek relief.
It's Time to end it all.
Just take my Hand and I will guide you through.
Far beyond Death's Dimensions we'll go.
