Giant Form, Tentacle Spwan.
Down into the dark I'm drawn.

King of  Kings, dead but Dreams.
In my Mind his Voice always sings.
Embodied Hate, lying in wait.
To grasp our World and seal our Fate.

And every Night it haunts my Sleep.
Monolith of the crushing Deep.
The great Beast beckons for me.

The Ocean churns, as the Ancient turns.
His Song pierces me, my Soul now burns.

At the Bottom of the raging Sea he awaits.
From submerged Halls of cryptic Stone he calls for me.

His Darkness covers me.
Ancient Evil, you breathe through me.
Never my Soul shall be free.
From the World that once was, whis is and always will be.

And every Night it haunts my Sleep.
Monolith of the crushing Deep.
The great Beast beckons for me.
Now and alway I can hear his cries.
And feel the Gaze of his burning Eyes.
Soon the Time has come when everything dies.

Cthulhu rise.
