I am the Vessel.
A means for him to maim and kill.
I am te Voice of Vengeance.
Blood shall be spilled.
The fury of his Wrath instilled.
I am the Sword.
An Extension of His Arm and Will.

I am the Enemy.
The Boot that comes down on your Face.
I am the Wolf.
Murderer of the Human race.
Drenched in in Blood I drink my fill. 
Life is no more.
An Extension of His Arm and Will

Unwothy, unclean, cancerous.
Sapiens obscene.
Tremble on your Knees as you gag to draw your final Breath.

So I bring Salt to barren your Soil.
Life shall grow here no more.
Erase all Signs of your filthy Disease.
So that I may be at peace.
Yes, so I bring Salt to barren your Soil.
Life shall grow here no more.
Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve.
He ceased to be, now rots in peace.

For I am the Poison.
An Archangel that fell from grace.
I am the Devils Blade.
The blackened Blaze.
The fury of his Wrath instilled.
I am your Death.
An Extension of His Arm and Will.

Unwothy, unclean, cancerous.
Sapiens obscene.
Die on your Knees.
Parasite, unclean, so worthless.
Sapiens extinct.
All is now Void in the annihilating Wnds of Death.

So I bring Salt to barren your Soil.
Life shall grow here no more.
Erase all Signs of your filthy Disease.
So that I may be at peace.
Yes, so I bring Salt to barren your Soil.
Life shall grow here no more.
Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve.
He ceased to be, now rots in peace.
