The World fell into Darkness.
And thus the End has begun.
Oceans rise and Mountains tremble and fall.
Armageddon is upon us all.
Say your Prayers, the Time is nigh.
For the End to unfold.
Arumbling Sound that shakes the Core of the Earth.
It's the Bells of Death that now tolls.

Man turns on Man.
With Teeth and Nail.
They're tearing each other apart.

The Wolves are freed from their shackles.
They come to prey on the weak.
In A frenzied Rage and with fury set in their Eyes.
They are the heralds of our demise.
Inhale the Smoke of the funeral Pyres.
Feel it blacken your Lungs.
With A heavy Heart and gasping for your last Breath.
Witness Mankind plunge into Death.

And so it ends, as Flames descend.
So come Perdition.
And so it ends, in Darkness cleansed.
So come Perdition, bring Damnation.
Grant us all annihilation.

This is goodbye, this is farewell.
For the Era of Man.
All filth now washed away in Rivers of Blood.
Behold the grandeur of the crimson Flood.
Say your Prayers, for the End is here.
Mankind reigns here no nmore.
Only Altars left made of Flesh and of Bones.
And the Stench of Ash and Brimstone.

And so it ends, as Flames descend.
So come Perdition.
And so it ends, in Darkness cleansed.
So come Perdition, bring Damnation.
Grant us all annihilation.
And so it ends, black Wings ascend.
So come Perdition.
And so it ends, in Darkness cleansed.
So come Perdition, bring Damnation.
Unleash global extermination.
