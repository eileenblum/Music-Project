Hear the howlings in the night
I'm one with it's might
Enchanted by the calling cries
As I gaze into the sombre skies
Awaiting the shining,
the fire neverseen
Waiting for the darkened path which'll
lead me straight
to the one who dance in my dreams

In surrounding flames I must be
wrapped

Wolves run by my side
As I walk towards eternity
In hate they'll gather with my shadows
as the moon arise

A scent of twilight
Into fading woods I march
I glimmer a shyness in the red
In eternal dreams I drown...

As the children of Fenris
sang their fullmoon serenade
I made love to the midnight winds
The forest embraced me
with it's impurity
In ecstasy my tears fell
like autumn silver rain

Now I stand above the human race
I've solved it all, the mystery of night
It's revealed to me
With a smile I see
These stars (unseen) formalion
that breeds my sunless dawn
