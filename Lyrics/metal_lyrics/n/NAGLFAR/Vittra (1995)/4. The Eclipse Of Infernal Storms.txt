The gate rose before him
In stood there open wide
A bloodstained portal of might
His travel to the land unknown

I awakened from this dismal dream
the same as thousand times before
This sight is so impure
So filled with mourning and with grace
It cries a message to me
of which I cannot ever grip
A man and this enermous gate
with his name on it written in blood...

I fall to me kness
Spelling my name
to be unleashed, and ever blessed
The great beyond lies open in front of me

I could see the gate
rise before my eyes
With a freezing smile
I entered the reign of death
I could see the truth
like an open book
And then I knew
what I had become

I awakened from the dismal dream
The threshold to the dead
I've passed this enormous gate
with my name on it written in blood...

In blood... I fall to me knees
Spelling my name
to be unleashed, and ever blessed
The great beyond lies open in front of me
