The veil of nocturnal beauty
Drowns the daylight flames
And so IT broods beyond the depths
Of the horizon never seen by the eyes of man
Awakened by the twilight's kiss
The nightly rebirth of evil
The paleness ITself has risen
From IT's slumber to reach out in IT's full shape

The midnight strikes again
The wicked ones has returned
December rises the damnation
Like a black burning dagger IT ripps the sky
Heaven weeps so feeble, as IT glows
Sunset has brought this shadowcast
Sunset brings the sign
Which causes the final summoning
Of ravens, serpents and even the owls
The choir of wolves echoes,
The eclipse is now complete
Thousands of throats is howling to praise IT's supreme infernal glare

"Scarletburn... Evening mist...
Stormwinds of death come forth!"
The gathering of nightfall's beings
Impaled the morning grace
The dawn lies raped, shredded and strangled
And so does the afternoon
Light's erased, and with the darkness IT lurks
Smiling, glowing so proud...
