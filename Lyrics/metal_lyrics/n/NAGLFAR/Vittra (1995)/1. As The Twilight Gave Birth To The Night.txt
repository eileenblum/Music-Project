As the twilight gave birth to the night
I walked into the forest
The twisted trees clawing at the skies
These are my true domimions
The mist glows red and ablaze the sky
and the funeral wind blows cold
This is where I shall sacrifice
Here I will end my mortal life

Seduced by the October moon
drowning in it's frozen grace
Tempting my nocturnal lusts
Bathing my pale cold face
These dark forests are singing to me
In tongues it cries my name
Bidding me into it's deep dark womb
where my spirit forever shall dwell

And a cold wind of evil
whispers my name in the forest,
I dance with witches and trolls
As the twilight gave birth to the night
I am here... Forever

My burial place will be the mountains,
the forests and the seas
And so my name shall be remembered
for all eternity

And still it cold wind of evil
whispers my name
in the forest as my spirit dance with
witches and trolls
Their hymns are praising me
For I am heir newborn king...
Forever

These dark surroundings are mine,
from smallest slone to the tallest tree
And so I will to be ruler of this night
I will reign in divinity
