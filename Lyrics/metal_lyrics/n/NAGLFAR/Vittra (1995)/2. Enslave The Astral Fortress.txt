The slench in the air
is cold as a winter night
The loss of my inner guest
The fallen star faded away...

Deeper, deeper I sink
into the embrace of sorrow
The winds of liars caresses me
Down here in the crying
valley of the dreamers
Detest and yearning tears me apart

I can see the thousand points of light
up in the burning sky
And I knew: it has to be done...

The salt of anquish
fills my bleeding veins
My heart is pierced by it's falseness

Darkness...
The pride is defeated
once again as I rise
I stand under a flaming sky

Deeper, deeper I sink
in hope to find the fallen star
and the secrets of the northern lights
Aurora Borealis, Stellae Trajectio
take me
Never again...
Nothing forever...

I can see the thousand points of light
up in the burning sky
And I knew: it had to be done...
And it seems like I'm swallowed
by it's mass of oblivion
and forever to be in flames...
