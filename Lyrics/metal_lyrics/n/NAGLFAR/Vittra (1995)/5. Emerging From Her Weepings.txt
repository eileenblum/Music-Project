Crawling in grief
Across the distant fields
I am the desire of which engrawed thee...

The formation was set
An enormous storm arose
As the thirleenth night ablazed
with it's web of obscurity
Oh you glorious blackened,
infernal screaming belle
Reveal the name,
unleash the path of bereavement

I have found the key, the key to the
ancient flame
Awaiting the sight to dwell in mournful
immortality
Like a breeze I levetate, only lead by the
owl's wisdom
We followed her misantropic sleep
so majestic and delight

Her weeping - touched me caressed me
Her weeping - screamed and longed for me
Her weeping - gave me all her might
Her weeping - her weepings enthroned me

I am the desire of which branded you...

Into the glowing mist
Her moanings tore my cloak.
Out from her empty veins I emerged with
wrath and lust
My blood in her mouth, I saw the passion
The cold passion to become what she became

Her weeping - touched me caressed me
Her weeping - screamed and longed for me
Her weeping - gave me all her might
Her weeping - her weepings enthroned me

I shall remain, forced to meet the dawn
Bleeding widow, I belong to her
The clouds were black as the starless night
For sunset I yearn, dusk you mysterious...
