There will be no beauty
The secrets of the unborn
An angel's cries with it's shattered wings
The holy blood is spilled

I fell from grace, I fell into the
deepest abyss
The evocations wrath hit me like a fist
To burst out in scars of distant grief
The August flames swallowed me with
it's kiss

Never to be found is the key to purgatory
I felt the winds of death and it's fury
They approached from the halls of
sacred duty
The fall of daylight has begun

From the ruins of my domain
They gathered with a pagan oath
to reign these walls for aeons
Hungry for the bewinged
The fullmoon I adore
and it's victory
I raise my hand with their blood in me

As blasphemy rains over me....

[Repeat second verse]

Fullmoon...
