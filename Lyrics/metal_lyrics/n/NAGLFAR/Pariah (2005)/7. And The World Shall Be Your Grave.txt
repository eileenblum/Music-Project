Crushed is the future of this feeble travesty
Your wretched kind shall bother us no more
A dead race to be, oh stinking bags of meat
Nothing but a filthy virus soon to be cured

Consumed by rage, I am fulled by the pain
That shall bring all you fuckers to your knees
The greatest of all sufferings
That of which you shall receive

Avert your eyes - denounce my name and leave me be
The taste of bile - Your worthless presence truly sickens me

I pray to the beast, A prayer for disease
For the imminent doom of humanity
Dreams of a world devoid of life
A silent tomb for all eternity

A fevered wish for cataclysms
And the war to end all wars
A desperate yearning for the day
When the scum shall breathe no more

[Chorus]
The day you die is the day I smile
Salvation lies in the nuclear fire
The memory of you shall fade
And the world shall be your grave
Now bow your heads in shame

The earth shall be reduced
Into a grand necropolis
The days of man are numbered
Soon they shall cease to exist

With a future now crushed, and all hopes turned into dust
Mankind has been brought to their knees
Behold a world devoid of life
A silent tomb for all of humanity

Avert your eyes - denounce my name and leave me be
The taste of bile - Your worthless presence truly sickens me

[Chorus]
The day you die is the day I smile
Salvation lies in the nuclear fire
The memory of you shall fade
And the world shall be your grave
Your final resting place
