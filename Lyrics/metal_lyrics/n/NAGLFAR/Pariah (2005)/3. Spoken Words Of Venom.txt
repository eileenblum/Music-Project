Mankind despised
Taste the anger of mine
Sheer worthlessness colours the aura of thine
The ground that you walk is the ground where you'll die
Black angels smile at your painful demise

Taste the venom of mine
The words I speak are the words of your demise
Taste the venom of mine

Silence is shattered by the truth I reveal
I'm cold burning hate
The flesh you possess is the uttermost waste
My preachings are sealing your fate

[Chorus]
My eyes are the mirrors that reflects your death
Contempt I express with each single breath
I despise you
Come manifest yourself in front of me
My face is the last thing you'll ever see
I despise you... Oh, how I loathe you

Approach me not - Can't you see
You're not worth dust to me
Approach me not - leave me be
You disgust me

Mankind despised
Feel the hatred of mine
Sheer worthlessness reeks from the presence of thine
The ground you walk is the ground where you'll die
Oh how I rejoice at your final demise

Taste the venom of mine
These words I speak are the words of your demise
Taste the venom of mine

[Chorus]
My eyes are the mirrors that reflects your death
Contempt I express with each single breath
I despise you
Come manifest yourself in front of me
My face is the last thing you'll ever see
I despise you... Oh, how I hate you

Approach me not - Can't you see
You're not worth shit to me
Approach me not - leave me be
You disgust me
