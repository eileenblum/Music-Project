... It has begun...

For far too long we have accepted their ways
The time has come for us to retaliate

Prey upon the worthless
Erase them from the eart
Their unborn shall be ripped out
From their wombs
And stomped into the dirt

In the cold morning breeze, the stench of misanthropy
Their fallen shall be scattered for the vultures to feed
They shall be taught the fiercest lessons of war
And in the end they shall breathe fornevermore

We, the bringers of Armageddon
Embodied in unholy grace
Filled with retribution and murderous rage
Like an ironclad fist smashed into your god's face

No forgiveness granted, none shall be spared
Wading knee-deep through your blood
Encouraged by the sound of rendering flesh

None shall be spared!

A reign of fools now ended
Two thousand years of lies
Our hordes now rejoice in triumph
As the sun erupts and dies

We preyed upon the worthless
We erased them from the earth
With salt we cleansed their tainted soil
To forever remove their curse
