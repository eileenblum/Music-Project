Possessed by the blazing aurora
Reborn under the fullmoon light
Hate boils in my veins tonight
I have wrapped myself with anger
And pursued you, killing without pity... I do

I've armed myself with all the strength of hell
And no prayers will pass trough

[Chorus]
When all my enemies are crushed under my feet
When human rights are perverted
In the presence of my nonloving form
Your chosen breed is deserted
I bring the gospel of the cleansing death
Your unawareness disturbs me
I always move like a thief in the night
When I move in on you
As I murder you

This is for the sins of your prophets
And the iniquities of your priests
Who shed the blood of righteous
And tarnished our blackened beliefs

[Chorus]
When all my enemies are crushed under my feet
When human rights are perverted
In the presence of my nonloving form
Your chosen breed is deserted
I bring the gospel of the cleansing death
Your unawareness disturbs me
I always move like a thief in the night
When I move in on you
As I murder you
