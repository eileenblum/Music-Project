Winds, furious firestorms
Come grace this world with war
Its punishment bestowed on earth forevermore
Deities of disease
Bring the infidels to their knees
Strike fear into their hearts
Indifferent to their pleas

Come, legions of ungodly birth
Reap all that walks the earth
Judgment comes in the form of a thunderous roaring curse
Spew forth atrocities
Wipe out the human fleas
Exterminate and crush all dreams of peace

Witness the glorious coming of brimstone and fire
Everlasting plagues are now unchained

[Chorus]
Behold the end of the human era
The end of feeble ways embrace the tyrants' warfare
A swarm of plagues
Hear the hissings coming from the reapers' scythe
Reversed are the words of creation
Become undone in the cleansing flames
Plutonium grace - The end of days

Rise up and burn what was once created
Turn fertile soil to sand
Annihilate - Abort the sacred masterplan
Spew forth atrocities
Wipe out you human fleas
Exterminate! Crush all dreams of peace

Witness the glorious coming of brimstone and fire
Everlasting plagues are now unchained

This marks the end...

We are haters of humanity
We preach about the end of the world
Your empire is falling
Let our teachings to be heard

[Chorus]
Behold the end of the human era
The end of feeble ways
Embrace the tyrants' warfare
A swarm of plagues
Hear the hissings coming from the reapers' scythe
Reversed are the words of creation
Become undone in the cleansing flames
Plutonium grace - The end of days
