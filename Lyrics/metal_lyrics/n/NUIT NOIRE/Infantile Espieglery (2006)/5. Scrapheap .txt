Be aware before crossing the road
My little cat
Be aware before crossing the road
You nice dog
Be aware before crossing the road
Spiky hedgehog
Be aware before crossing the road
Long ears rabbit

Be aware before crossing the road
Frog and pimply toad
Be aware before crossing the road
Creeping caterpillar
Be aware before crossing the road
Little singing cricket
Be aware before crossing the road
Butterfly bird and owl

I hate you, fucking cars, cause you kill the animals
Grinding their bones, bursting their veins and making them agonize
I will crush you as you crush them, you will taste my lunar sword
You won't be able to run anymore, you will become a scraphead
