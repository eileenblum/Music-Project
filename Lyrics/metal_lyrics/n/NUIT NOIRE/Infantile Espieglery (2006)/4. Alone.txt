And the wind is blowing in the mist
And the mist is caressing the trees
And the trees are growing in the dark
And the dark is refilling my eyes
I'm alone in the night
Landscape is motionless
Atmosphere is quiet
But I feel something
That go over my back and my neck
and my head and my mind
I couldn't see you fucking human eyes
FÃ¤erie in my heart I bathe in your light
