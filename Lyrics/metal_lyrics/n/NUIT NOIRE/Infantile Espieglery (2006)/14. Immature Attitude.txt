Again it is another dream
Again the night is so bright
Again the fairies love me 
Again the madness shal be

We will run towards the skirt of the forest
We will dance between the trees
We will throw ourselves on the ground
And roll in leaves
We will hang on to the branches
And climb very high
We will fuck everybody
