I roam among the trees
Caressed by the nocturnal wind
Flying between the numberless trunks
Creatures of the night 
Come to me
In nomine tenebrarum
In nomine obscuri
In nomine umbrarum 
In nomine noctis
Come to me

I hear many rustlings around me
Brillant eyes are considering my figure
Standing in a moonlit clearing
Creatures of the night
Follow me
