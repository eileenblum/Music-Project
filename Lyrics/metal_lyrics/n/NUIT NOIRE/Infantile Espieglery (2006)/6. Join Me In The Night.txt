You watch this beautiful forest
It fascinates you night and day
Just a few steps to go
Could you leave this world?
Join me in the forest
In the shadows

It is really easy to do
No need to be junkie or drunk
Simply forget your body
And feel with your heart
Join me in the darkness
Join me in the night
Join me in the light
