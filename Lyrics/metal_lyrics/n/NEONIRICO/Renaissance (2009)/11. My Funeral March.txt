This is my funeral
Everyone is here
This is my funeral
Let's begin the rites

This is my funeral
I'm rid from all the pain
This is my funeral
It's time for the goodbye
This is my funeral
The saddest day of my life
This is my funeral
An ode to honor and pride
This is my funeral
Bring the red roses to my grave
This is my funeral
Pray for me and I shall be saved

Tears of sadness, tears of joy
Doleful grief, endless sorrow
Don't cry for me because I deserve
This gloomy journey
Somewhere I know there's glory and hope

All my special guests are coming, from hell
The envious crows, eagles of the doom
Black swans of death, vultures of misery
Come to me, this tormented soul is waiting

Rip off my wrecked heart
Feed from these warm entrails
Predators of my soul, come to me
Come to me, let's reach eternity
From here I can see, the eternal flames are thirsty

Higher, stronger, brighter they burn
Don't be afraid, it's just a state of mind
As soon as you'll pass, you will find the treasure
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid

Wake up and fight this hollow freedom
Stand up and be yourself for once
This is my funeral
An elegy to treachery
This is my funeral
The greatest day of my life

Praise the lord of the shadows
Join in the deadly waltz
Twist in the dance of souls
Among the madmen's crawl

This is my funeral
I see the curtain's fall
This is my funeral
Here ends all
This is my funeral
This is my funeral
