Fury! Anger!
Suffering! Vengeance!
Sorrow! Misery!
Despair! Agony!
Treason! Anguish!
Tragedy! Terror!
Hideous! Hatred!
Painful! Inferno!

Serenity, so quietly
We ride on the wings of destiny
Eternity, so peacefully
We reach the point of majesty
Infinity, so wide and deep
Like crystal clear we dive into the magic sea

Passion! Liberty!
Honor! Glory!
Courage! Dignity!
Providence! Justice!
Violence! Prejudice!
Pardon! Mercy!
Saviour! Blasphemy!
Majesty! Inferno!

Serenity, so quietly
We ride on the wings of destiny
Eternity, so peacefully
We reach the point of majesty
Infinity, so wide and deep
Like crystal clear we dive into the magic sea

And then the treasure of shining mirrors
Glows brighter than a thousand suns

Serenity, so quietly
We ride on the wings of destiny
Eternity, so peacefully
We reach the point of majesty
Infinity, so wide and deep
Like crystal clear we dive into the magic sea

And then the treasure of shining mirrors
Glows brighter than a thousand suns
