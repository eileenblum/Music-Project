Time line cold joy gone words pain flame
Bleed dreams free cry pray tears say fear
Life door burn soul

The time is near, don't waste your tears
You'll soon be free to live your dreams
Beyond the door, the trail of joy
I cross the line to meet my soul
No words, no pain, no fear, just cold
The flame of life will bleed and burn
Don't pray, don't cry, don't say I'm gone
Be strong, you'll never walk alone

Close your eyes
Leave your fears behind
And walk towards the shine
Close your eyes
Leave your fears behind
You'll never walk alone

The lights are off, the curtain falls
A stream of hope runs through my heart
Beneath the lies, the truth untold
So wise, so deep, so unforgettable
In peace you wrote your own demise
The love you left is great and beautiful
Now I'm prepared to say goodbye
Be sure, you'll never walk alone

Close your eyes
Leave your fears behind
And walk towards the shine
Close your eyes
Leave your fears behind
You'll never walk alone

Fly on your way
My angel of faith
Fly on your way

Forever, together
Closer to heaven

Close your eyes
Leave your fears behind
And walk towards the shine
Close your eyes
Leave your fears behind
You'll never walk alone
