Take my hand
Feel my touch
Break the spell
From my heart

Set me free
Take me home
Far from pain
Close to hope

Spread the wings
Of your dreams
Fly above
Seas of blue and gold

Day and night
Claim the sky
Moon and sun
Fall in love

Like the stars
Wish the dusk
So I pray
For my liberty

Spread the wings
Of your dreams
Fly above
Seas of blue and gold
From my eyes
Tears will flow
Like a stream
On the mirrors of my soul
