Fill your hand with hope
It's all that you need to go
Your starlight is shining in the dark
There's a place for us to smile
It's clear as the ocean's sky
Blue waters of purity and love
A purple sunset is painting my heart
Like castles of passion drawn over the stars

The falling star shines upon the path
Winding stairs are rising in the night
Climb the eternal trail of grace
So precious, so graceful and divine
The heavenly treasures you will find
All your beloved ones
Open your hand and see
Your dreams became reality
Blessed with glory and hope

Tell us the secret of love and life
Give us the answer
Why dreamers are so blind?
But higher, stronger, brighter they shine
Over the stars and the sky
