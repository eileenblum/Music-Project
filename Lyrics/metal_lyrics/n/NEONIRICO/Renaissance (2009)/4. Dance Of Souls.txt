This is my final hour
I lay down my empire
Depose my arms
Renounce my throne and crown

These are my final words
Written with tears and blood
Sealed with a kiss
From this empoisoned lips

Close the gates
Caronte awaits
The bark has come for me
I'll cross the Styx
In a flaming trip
The journey of my life

The Antichrist is rising from fire, fear and lust
I'm facing my judgement day
My golden pyre is burning, I'm crumbling into dust
This is redemption time

Crawling before the infernal court
The trial to condemn my soul
I hear the hollow voices screaming to me:
"Blame and blasphemy"

Weak flesh, immoral living
These are my mortal sins
The veredict proclaims:
I shall burn in the eternal flames

Close the gates
Caronte awaits
The bark has come for me

The Antichrist is rising from fire, fear and lust
I'm facing my judgement day
My golden pyre is burning, I'm crumbling into dust
This is redemption time

Regard the dance of souls, twisting like a pale rag-doll
With winding, stifling tongues, crackling flesh and bones
Join in the deadly waltz

The Antichrist is rising from fire, fear and lust
I'm facing my judgement day
My golden pyre is burning, I'm crumbling into dust
This is redemption time
