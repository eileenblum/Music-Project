Wake up
You're trapped inside your dreams
Stand up
And fight this hollow freedom

Caught in my mind's prison-cell
Somewhere between God and hell

Rise up
A chance to change the world
Speak up
Those words that should be heard

It's your voice, it's your choice
It's never too late

Why time is killing me slowly?
I drown myself in this flood
Buried alive
Under the surface where lies
Honor and pride

Break out
The coffin of your thoughts
Dig out
The raised fist off your grave

Face your own truth
You will find your inner self

Why time is killing me slowly?
I drown myself in this flood
Buried alive
Under the surface where lies
Honor and pride
