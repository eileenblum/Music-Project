Thousand spears, dark clouds of
arrows, every day we die
Buried in this ground, I'm here
forever bound

Ruins, death, and ghostly shadows
is what still remains
But we are now a memory
Our homes engulfed in flames, is
what we see

With a cry he falls to his knees in
sorrow
Tears of love streams from his eyes
Time has made their raged minds
hollow and he still sees his loved
ones die

A kiss goodbye before you die
Our bond of love is strong
But that was a hundred years ago,
and the battle rages on

Death keeps me near
Here I am forever bound
All that I fear
My home and love shall be found
No one to hear
I die again without a sound
I shed a tear
it disappears in the ground

Massive armies on burnt down 
meadows
We gaze at them with hatred
Insects of the earth
Their bodies give you birth

Screams of pain from thousand
shadows
Here we shall wage war forever
Asgard was a lie
