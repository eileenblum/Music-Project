Dreams are burning when I await the
end, with death who keeps me near
With a spear in my hand, deep in
thoughts I stand, surrounded by cries
of fear

The violence of your life
has brought you here
You've made your sacrifice
Now feel no fear

By your side
I'll watch over you
In other shapes I hide
Some day I'll need you to

Wounded I fall on my knees
With your soothing voice, you keep
me at peace

The silence of your death
you shall not fear
You won't feel loneliness
I'm always near
