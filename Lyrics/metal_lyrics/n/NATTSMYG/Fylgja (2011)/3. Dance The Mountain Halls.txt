Lone you dance with a smile
Come here and rest for a while

Heed my words
Let it be your fall
Let yourself to fream without an end
Heed my call
Let it be your fall
To dance for eternity in the hall of the mountain king

She will dance and cry til our world falls
Her feet will always bleed the mountain halls

Let your mind go
Let your feet know
Let your heart see
You're trapped for eternity

Lone I dance the halls while he's away
I have the chance to run, but I must stay

I will dance and cry til the night falls
My feet will always bleed the mountain halls

Let my mind go
Let your heart show
Your loneliness is killing me
I'm dancing an eternity
In the mountain halls
