The sea caresses my hair with its breeze,
I can't avoid the memory of your hands.
I miss those wonderful moments with you
when it wasn't important where, how or why.

I see you, feel your embrace.
I love you, take me away.
I think of you,
and touch you in my dreams.
But I trust your words,
you said you'd return.
Please, don't let me
To die alone.

You are my life... I will wait for you...
I won't stop to watch the horizont,
I look for the boat which sent you to the war.

I see you, feel your embrace.
I love you, take me away.
I think of you,
and touch you in my dreams.
But I trust your words,
you said you'd return.
Don't let my heart
To feel you dead.

"I heard a whisper in the waves
My broken heart, the uncertainty about your death...
ItÂ´s the end of my time... the begining of ours..."
