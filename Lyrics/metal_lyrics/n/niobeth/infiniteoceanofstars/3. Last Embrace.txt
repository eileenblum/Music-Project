The sea caresses my hair with its breeze,
I canât avoid the memory of your hands.
I miss those wonderful moments with you
when it wasnât important where, how or why.

I see you, feel your embrace.
I love you, take me away.
I think of you,
and touch you in my dreams.
But I trust your words,
you said youâd return.
Please, donât let me
To die alone.

You are my life... I will wait for you...
I wonât stop to watch the horizont,
I look for the boat which sent you to the war.

I see you, feel your embrace.
I love you, take me away.
I think of you,
and touch you in my dreams.
But I trust your words,
you said youâd return.
Donât let my heart
To feel you dead.

"I heard a whisper in the waves
My broken heart, the uncertainty about your death...
ItÂ´s the end of my time... the begining of ours..."
