Run so fast
That even wind can reach up me.

Nature, earth, trees,
Wrap me up with the night,
Dress me up with branches,
Spirits of nature, lake nymphs,
Angels, devas...

My name NÃ­obeth,
My only dress flowers,
My only way the night,
My only fate...

Feel the earth with my touch,
Feel nude as a tree...

My name NÃ­obeth,
My only dress flowers,
My only way the night,
My only fate...

Roots, earth, nature,
Sun stars, spirit, freedom...
Earth, stars...

Get my body as yours
Take my heart and my brain
Wake me up in a dawn
Where my body is not a body
And my soul is earth...

And my name NÃ­obeth
Belongs to the stars.
My only way the night,
My only fate...

My name NÃ­obeth,
My only dress flowers,
My only way the night,
My only fate...
