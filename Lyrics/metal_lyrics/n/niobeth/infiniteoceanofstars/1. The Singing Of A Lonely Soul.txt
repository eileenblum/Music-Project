A drop of love, in rain falling, lighting up my darkness
His light becomes weaker, infinite ocean of stars...
Far away from a dream...

Now alone I wake, hidden in every corner
Blinded to my dreams, looking for my angel

Knowing not where my dreams are flying
Finding not anymore white or gold wings

Angels sing come take my ashes
Wings to dust, lost heart...

Leaving back the ways leading to the sunrise
Night takes in the lorn, await me...

Angels sing come take my ashes
Wings to dust, lost heart...

Queen of darkness, queen of night
I walk in sadness blinded by my fears
Emerald breeze caresses my tears

Angels sing come take my ashes
Wings to dust, lost heart...
Angels sing come take my ashes
Wings to dust, lost heart...

Tears of sorrow broken like crystal
Embrace cold forever,
Pale moon yearning
Where are you my angel?
