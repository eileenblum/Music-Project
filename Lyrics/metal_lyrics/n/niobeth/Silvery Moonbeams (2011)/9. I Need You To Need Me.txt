Listen to the breezee.
Keep my breath for cold nights.
I need every drop
of your love to feel free.

I need you to need me.
I will carry on.
Your fingers travelling
all over my body,
your caresses building
my way.

I will care for you.
Embrace me in the long wait.
In this, our sad wait
I will dream every night alone.

I will count every smile,
the ones I sent to you,
I treasure all of them,
the whisper of my wings
full of hope to see
you again, again...
Then IÂ´ll choose a star for you.

I need you to need me...

I wonÂ´t let myself fall
because I love you.

Listen to the breezee.
Keep my breath for cold nights.
I need every drop
of your love to feel free.

I need you to need me.
