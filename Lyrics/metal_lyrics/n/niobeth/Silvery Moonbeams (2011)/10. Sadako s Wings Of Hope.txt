[Act I]

Your smile in the mirror of time
make me shiver,
frighten me whole.
Those days full of sadness
when you still had strength
to believe.

When it comes for you remember;
remember to be strong,
remember to have faith:
believe, believe.
When it pass you by I will sing,
I will sing your grief,
I will care for your tears...
Believe, believe.

If you fold your wish
in wings of paper
your dreams will come true;
this is the magic
of faith, of believing:
you have to trust your inner light.
Never forget I will be watching over you.

I know this is my last night on Earth.
I will be remembering your shiny eyes.
Life is the dream of the
ancient great spirit of benevolence.
Think of me
when your will gets weak
and go on and on
and never ever never ever give up.
You have so much talent, so much beauty,
so much goodness in your heart.

I wish to dream again.

I shall write peace upon your wings
and you shall fly all over the world
so that children will no longer have
to die this way.

Step by step
I weave my wish
among wings of hope,
cranes of eternal bliss.
Redemption,
guide me through deepest darkness.
Salvation,
cranes of eternal bliss

Bless the breeze, love the glow,
save me, caress me, embrace me,
through the gardens of my loneliness,
write the verses of my last poem
and love me again,
smile for me, dream me,
take my hand, make me feel safe,
bring me fresh water,
beautiful flowers
from the bloom of Spring in March.
In March.

[Chorus:]
My soul wandering desolated
longs for a chance to shine
in pureness once again, save me.
Save me,
with love, with hope, with justice,
with neverending faith.
DonÂ´t tell me I cannot fight.

I will never give up,
IÂ´ll stand before the storm.
Feel my warmth
and you will never have to fear.
Always one more try,
always one more try.
For this night
let us make your wish immortal.

[Act II]

Six-hundred-fourty-four smiles
care for you, shield you,
protect you from the world.
Maybe one day we all can be
so strong as you, so pure as you.
So peaceful and serene
before the biggest evil,
before human hate.
So graceful, so intense,
so alive and brighty-eyed.
Walk through the stars
with dreamy eyes, with innocence.
DonÂ´t let human hate
turn off the flame
so unique in your heart.

Spread your wings and rise again
like golden phoenix, fly away,
earthly cursed, heavenly blessed,
hero of this tragic story.
Your death will not be in vain,
your tears will fill a thousand scrolls
overcoming hate, agony and anguish:
your infinite courage.

Now that the ship
sinks in the deep
let flee you mind
(tear demons away to shreds).
Now that your lips
are turning pale
pain will pass by.

You walked the path with naked feet,
your trace has become our guiding torch,
winter cold embraces our solitude,
cold night let us head north.
Lotus blooming from dark waters,
your immortal spirits stands
om mani padme hum,
let us heed the wise man.

[Chorus]

Across the universe,
painting the stars
as purple crystals of freedom.
Above heavenly vault,
beyond our reach,
now close your eyes, dream once again.

[Act III]

Rest calm dear child,
no more pain left,
frozen tears falling.
With silver laments calls,
sings the swing, cries the moonlight.
Beneath your wings of hope,
underneath eternal sorrow,
misty-eyed dreamer,
angel of peace on Earth.

Smile, now you are safe at last
shining from above,
all will see your light fly through time.
There, deep in our hearts, youÂ´ll live.

ããã¯ã¼ããã®å«ã³ã§ã.
ããã¯ç§ãã¡ã®ç¥ãã§ã.
ä¸çã«å¹³åããããããã®.

For hatred does not cease
by hatred at any time;
hatred ceases by love.
This is the eternal law.

SadakoÂ´s wings of hope,
most shining star,
fly over the oceans,
your flame will remain.

Bring calm and peace
to wounded souls;
keep us from rage,
heal the good left in us.

[Chorus]

My soul wandering desolated...

Sunrise will come,
sunlight will draw
your glorious strength
and kiss your tears.
Sealed in your chest
thereÂ´s a tale of grief and pain.
Poor moonpath, follow your fate
with hair dancing in the air.
Poor moonpath...

This is our cry.
This is our prayer.
Peace in the world.
[Repeat]

Keep hope,
we will meet beyond the edge of time.
