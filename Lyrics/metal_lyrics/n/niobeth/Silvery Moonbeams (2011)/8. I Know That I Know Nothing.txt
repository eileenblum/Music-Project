When you accept you know nothing light may come to you.

Heaven, reincarnation,
hell or the nothing.
You may find on the other side anything you dream.

Feel, imagine...

Only now that you donÂ´t know

to caress the sweet
paradise of uncertainty.

When you accept...

Feel the shine of the stars
and let you go
because you can fill the void
with the magic of your fantasies.

Believe that your way
in the afterlife can be;
choose your tomb,
choose your death,
without answer there exists a dream.

Feel the shine of the stars

because you can fill the void
with the magic of your fantasies.

Above fire and water exists
an everything,
feel near him.
Universe, our only god.
All together, creation.

The dream lost in (the) sanity
of man comes to you as
possible reality.
I know that I know nothing.
