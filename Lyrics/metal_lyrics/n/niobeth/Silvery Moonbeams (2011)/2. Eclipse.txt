You have return just as you promised.
Should I believe in you?
I still cry when I remember
the things you made me do.
Leave me alone,
I donÂ´t want you.

Feel paradise,
I can take you with me.
Just follow me (follow me)
and be still (my voice)
at my voice.

I still shiver when I feel
the blood you made me shed
(youÂ´d better hide, youÂ´d better hide).
Is there any pleasant word left
I can trust in?
If I only could get you out of my head
(youÂ´d better hide, youÂ´d better hide).
Will my tears be all in vain?

Should I stay awake or give up
to eternal madness?
Down to darkness, down to a place
where the stronger seems so frail.
Shadows around, fire for all them.

First step to the edge,
there is a red light sparkling,
should I touch the door?
Freeze... DonÂ´t move yet,
still I keep some fears
youÂ´d like to behold.

I still shiver when I feel...

Are you the one I was looking for?
Are you friend or foe?
Me... She... The breeze...
Long blonde hair...
Why canÂ´t I find my light?
Save me.

Second step to the edge,
a misty long dank corridor,
your silhouette (appears approaching).
Freeze... DonÂ´t move yet,
still I keep some fears
youÂ´d better resolve.

I still shiver when I feel...

I still shiver when I feel...
