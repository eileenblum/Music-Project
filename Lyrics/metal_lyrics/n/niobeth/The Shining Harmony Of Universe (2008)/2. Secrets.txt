I fear the deep silence of my tears,
Sunken in the darkness they imposed me,
where I cannot scape from

Keep my demons in the past for I can born again,
for they donÂ´t hurt me with a day without hope,
for my eyes can see the world and breath in peace

Cause tomorrow the sun wonÂ´t shine for me,
because there is a place for hate,
I have to go towards forgiveness

Give me your hand,
donÂ´t leave me,
donÂ´t let loneliness
to surround me
until the end of my days

Look at me,
now IÂ´m you,
IÂ´m the one
I should not have been.

Dark secrets of my heart
open the door to the cruel destiny
that should not were  forged

Cause tomorrow the sun wonÂ´t shine for me,
because there is a place for hate,
I have to go towards forgiveness

Save me from myself,
save you from me,
Sadness tomorrow,
sadness yesterday,

Free me from myself, keep my pain with you
turned into the reflect of your dark evil

Show me no mercy.

Go away Monsters.

Bless me in the night
with a sunbeam that guides my steps

Cause tomorrow the sun wonÂ´t shine for me,
because there is a place for hate,
I have to go towards forgiveness

And pain went through a way without end,
and hope came to a body without a soul,
and hate went towards a face without face
