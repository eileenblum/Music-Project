Look around you, grow your dreams,
go raise your paradise

In (the) land Harmony a maiden called
F sharp decided to escape
from his village (Stave) evading
the guardian Sol key.

The maiden travelled to a distant place
where a sage turned her into seed.
From there the first musician
on Earth was born.

My desire is your desire
Which stave would you like to be escaped from?

Listen to each note like a shine in the dark of night
and feel part of  the music of universe

Close your eyes then open your eyes
then you can see the note you have inside

When a musician borns,
a musical note borns
When a musician dies,
a musical note dies

Building an stave
that keeps us all forever in time

To catch my hopes,
to draw a note,
to show my tears,
music is my soul,
music is my dream
