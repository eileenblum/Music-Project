Keep my secret deep within,
hear my call...

Oh... oh how I cry
In the lone night
please save me from
the embrace denying my future
Where are you father?
Where are you mother?

Come from the deep,
Bless me, protect me
from her cold fingers

Echoes of terror
In this solitude
WhereÂ´s my angel?
I remember your eyes (and)
How we played together
Angel...

I feel fear...
(Darkness is coming,
watch out from your back,
here we are...)
Why I hear but silence?
(Hunting your last breath,
stealing your soul,
torn apart)
Get out this cold
(Keeping the cold
even colder
around and inside)
Freezing my illusions
(Stalking the child
you once was,
where is it now?)

The whisper of rain will bring me life
From an unique memory

Missing inside the twilight,
The crown of my sunrise
and moon of my pale night
Chant in horizon brings hope,
Defeat all my fears
and make sound my best play

Come from the blue,
Bless me,
protect me from her cold fingers

Echoes of terror
In this solitude
WhereÂ´s my angel?
I remember your eyes (and)
How we played together
Angel...

Cure me from this illness
Caressing the moonlight
Sweet touch dreaming the angels
Blue is the soul of silence

Keep my secret deep within
ColdÂ´s invading all of me
Comet of my ultimate yearning
Chained and merged forever to you

Freedom
To smile in peace
Freedom
To paint the sky with
My hopes
Stretch your hands
Take my love
Keep it with you

Rest for this night,
Rest in my shoulders,
my saviour, downcast

Echoes of terror
In this solitude
WhereÂ´s my angel?
I remember your eyes (and)
How we played together
Angel...

White mist rising from the floor
Where am I now?
Your smell singing everywhere
This should be peace

I have felt the ocean
Wished for the moon
Caressed the darkness
Swam in the sun

Sad is the day (Rest for this night)
Dark is the journey (Eternal Whisper)
When the moment comes (May you find peace here)

No victory nor defeat
Had no chance to fight
Dreaming the path to your smile
Tell me you are here
I have felt the ocean
Wished for the moon
Caressed the darkness
Swam in the sun

Great is the day (Precious the day)
Long is the journey (Precious the journey)
For to go back home (Staring Shooting stars)
