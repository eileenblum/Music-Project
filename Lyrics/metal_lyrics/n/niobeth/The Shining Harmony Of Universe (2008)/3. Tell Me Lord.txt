Tell me God, tell me Lordâ¦

Why do we find
in death the sense of our life
if we cannot rectify

Only pay for what
we should have done
but we did not?

Will, in his death,
the atheist find God?
Will, in his death,
the priest realizes his God was a lie?

All the same before
the dark final sight

And what if death
comes today?
Is this the final judgmentÂ´day?

Why do we find
in death the sense of our life
if we cannot rectify

Only pay for what
we should have done
but we did not?

Will, in his death,
the atheist find God?
Will, in his death,
the priest realizes his God was a lie?

Human kind, great, powerful,
but it comes for all of us

Will, in his death,
the atheist find God?
Will, in his death,
the priest realizes his God was a lie?

Tell me you are there
Great Lord,
please tell me!

Have my tears been in vain?

Look at me,
I am the feared dark one
And I write the End.
