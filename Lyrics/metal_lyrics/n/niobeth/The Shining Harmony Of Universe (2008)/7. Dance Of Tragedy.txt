This is my dance of tragedy,
Greed, avarice,
they are the dancers

My lifeÂ´s their stage
and my destruccion
is their work

They lie for money
Destroy lives for money

Souls come to me
Surround me with your magic
Dance of Tragedy,
IÂ´ll hand to you
the keys to my paradise.

I believe,
IÂ´m your serf,
I adore you
like a God.

They lie for money
Destroy lives for Money

Souls come to me
Surround me with your magic
Dance of Tragedy,
IÂ´ll hand to you
the keys to my paradise.

My supossed saviour may my sad tears be
the daggers which go through your body
before the incredulous eyes of those who adore you

They lie for money
Destroy lives for money

Souls come to me
Surround me with your magic
Dance of Tragedy,
IÂ´ll hand to you
the keys to my paradise.

I believe,
IÂ´m your serf,
I adore you..
