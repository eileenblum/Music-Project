My chant trapped in cold walls
My tale covered with these dark clouds
oh why your beautyÂ´s gone
why you? why you my love?

I miss the blue of night
I long for the hope to dance
So blind to see but pain
Waterfall sings despair

Shreds of distant lullabies
Our promise died in vain
Missed sunrise will never come

These chains of sorrow
are too heavy to bear within
My silence screams inside
Trapped in a midnight beam

Shreds of distant lullabies
Our promise died in vain
From this nightmare
I will never wake (ever)

Unblessed crying oceans inside
My river of eternal mourn
Play the last serenade
Misty-eyed angel
Erase my fairy tale

Where was my guardian angel
To watch over me?
(There was no guardian angel)
Where is my little princess
to draw our ship in the wind?
(ThereÂ´ll be no little princess)

Trapped in a midnight beam
No one can hear my silence within
(Alone in this world voice inside)
IÂ´m already death my love
There is no strengh to run
Nor will to hide
(Nothing) canÂ´t save me from the past
