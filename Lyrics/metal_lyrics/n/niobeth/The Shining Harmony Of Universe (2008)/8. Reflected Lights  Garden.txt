A shine fell,
walked in darkness
lighting up other lights
lost through time

Star from the sky
donât you cry more,
donât let the darkness in the world
make you forget where you come from

The world is a mirror,
you look at yourself in
you donât believe innocenceâs been lost

Sad and small I walk,
today I will be the sparkle of a lost reflection
maybe tomorrow I will shine

Star from the sky
donât you cry more,
donât let the darkness in the world
make you forget where you come from

Only your delicate innocence
makes bloom true magic
hidden in others.

I walk in shadows,
today I will be the sparkle of a lost reflection,
maybe tomorrow I will shine

Please Remember.
Lost Light, shine for us, shine for you, shine!

Star from the sky
donât you cry more,
donât let the darkness in the world
make you forget where you come from

Dreaming forever,
thereâs no dust left to make me fly

Awake to fly,
the moment has come to shine one last time

No ways to light up,
today I will be the sparkle of a lost reflection,
maybe tomorrow I will shine.

Shine for you, shine
