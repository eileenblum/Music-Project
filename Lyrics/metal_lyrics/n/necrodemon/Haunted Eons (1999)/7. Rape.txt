It's late at night I broke into your house
Your all tied up with my cock in your mouth
Tell me whore, how does it feel?
I'm in your ass and hard as steel
Your mind is lost, your body is raped
My perverse insanity drive to ravage, violate

There's no way out / There is no escape
Your victim to utter fucking rape!

How you wonder where your children are
Don't worry their watching getting psychologically scarred
I bet you wish your husband was here
He'd only look into my eyes and run in fear
The bastard we conceive I won't be his father
And when I'm through with you I'll have your daughter

There's no way out / There is no escape
Your victim to utter fucking rape!

Forever etched in your mind... this horrible scene
If not in reality... I haunt your dreams
Yours and your daughter's innocence... is forever lost
When you crossed the line... you paid the cost
Now I can only laugh... about your situation
Your grief and suffering... my satisfaction!

Now as I sit here in my cell
Ready to unleash my perverse Hell
Upon the woman who I obsess
Eternally, I'll be lusting for her flesh!

Lusting for her flesh!
