Deep in the valleys of ancient time lives a serpent known as the asp
Poisonous bite, evil snake eyes once your in his range you'll have no chance

Slithering down the sand hill now devilishly stalking human prey
Venom injected feeds on the soul the asp loves to take life away

During daystar he sleeps in skulls
At night he dances on your bones
Lightening speed when he strikes
Enter death from the deadly bite

Winding his way through tombs of the Pharaohs he is well acquainted with the dead
The archeologists come seeking fortune visions of human flesh in the asp's head

Iridescent scales shine in the moonlight his forked tongue flickering, flickering
Coiling up to form the perfect "S" curve from his teeth the venom is dripping

During daystar he sleeps in skulls
At night he dances on your bones
Lightening speed when he strikes
Enter death from the deadly bite

[Dead Pharaoh Choir]

During daystar he sleeps in skulls
At night he dances on your bones
Lightening speed when he strikes
Enter death from the deadly bite
