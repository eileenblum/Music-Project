I never walk / I always stalk / Taking humans as my prey
Darkness in my eyes / I'm from another time / Centuries beyond humanity
Programmed to kill / I do it for the thrill / My artillery knows no shame

...Mechanical Death

True is your fear / When I appear / Under a blue lightening flash
An evil red flare / In my electronic stare / In the future I was cast
None hear your cries / I burn you alive / Turning your soul to fucking ash

...Mechanical Death

Sorrow and remorse I cannot feel
My cybergenic parts made of steel
I cross all the barriers of time
Sent here to destroy all the life

You cannot hide / My sensors will find / Thermal imaging never fails
Of all I've killed / And blood I've spilled / Children are sure to hear tales
I'm indestructible / My power supply eternal / Mechanical Death is unveiled

...Mechanical Death
