Your first appearance in this world was in the form of a snake
Lord and Master Satan, I will gather souls for you to take
I burn the fires deep in the night
Send your demonic army into flight

Candles are lit, sacred oil burns, waxen images for ritual
Lucifer, horned one, bestow the power of a familiar
Your symbols I now fill with blood
Master Sathanas, your rise, my salvation

Your origin is unknown / no links to reality
Your knowledge of time / dates are unforeseen

Young, beautiful, innocent girls I shall find and gather
Demon king dress them in black and sodomize them on your altar
Emptiness, yet your artifacts inside
Lost in my dreams but eyes are open wide

Full moon on this night and the infernal stars shine
Entrance through your sacred gates and all the darkness behind
This place of worship now faces west
The Devil sends a son to transgress

Your origin is unknown / no links to reality
Your knowledge of time / dates are unforeseen

The Summoning!
