Anti-aircraft flak lights up the evening sky
Enemy radar spotted our chopper's arrival
Rocket propelled grenade takes out one of four
Cast aside fear and tighten the grip on your M-16
Hueys stationary firing missiles and gattling guns
Cover our asses as we descend into battle

The choppers leave us behind / Hostile enemy lines
We must destroy their installations / Failure is not an option

Into the Drop Zone!  Into the Drop Zone!

Our mission perfectly thought and mapped out
Ready thermal imaging and mine detection
Cannon fire ceases as we cut the enemy down
Mortars and grenade launchers utterly precise
They pushed our leaders to the brink of war
We warned you many times, "Don't fuck with the U.S.!"

The choppers leave us behind / Hostile enemy lines
We must destroy their installations / Failure is not an option

Into the Drop Zone!  Into the Drop Zone!

The battle smoke begins searing the eyes, oh the pain
Corpses of our enemies lie smoldering about
I bleed from the lead I caught on that last hill
My blood-stained uniform a tribute to victory
The F-16's finish sweeping up the last enemies
We return home to our friends and families

The choppers leave us behind / Hostile enemy lines
We must destroy their installations / Failure is not an option

Into the Drop Zone!  Into the Drop Zone!
