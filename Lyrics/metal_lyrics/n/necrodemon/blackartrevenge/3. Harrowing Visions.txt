Alone in the night I obsess about
Clenching my hands around your neck
Depleting all the life force out of you
Choking until the very last breath

Lying there strangulated on the floor
Your lifeless eyes stare back at mine
Empowered by fear you had inside
Within these harrowing visions of mine

Night after night I watch you die
In these harrowing visions of mine
Your death became my delight
In these harrowing visions of mine

Doomsdayâs coming I snap your neck
Your body is now a maggot feast
Leave your corpse out in the woods
Strangled, decayed, lifeless and grey

Lying there decaying on the forest floor
Your lifeless eyes stare back at mine
Empowered by fear that you had inside
Within these harrowing visions of mine
You die! You die! You die!
