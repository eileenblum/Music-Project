Father, it's freezing
But I praise You in pain;
Through the darkest clouds
You will rise again

Father, I'm polarized
Trust me with this pain;
More than a conqueror
Through you I've become

Oh I've learned and I've burned

The Benumbed Suffering
The Benumbed Suffering
The Benumbed Suffering
The Benumbed Suffering

Oh I've learned and I've burned

The Benumbed Suffering
The Benumbed Suffering
The Benumbed Suffering
The Benumbed Suffering

Father, bone-chilling
Yet I seek You in pain;
Within the coldest hour
You will rise again
