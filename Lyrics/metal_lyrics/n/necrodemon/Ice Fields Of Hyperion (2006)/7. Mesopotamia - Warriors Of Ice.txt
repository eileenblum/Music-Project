Back in the period of great empires
Near the end of the cold Ice Age
Arose a clan of mysterious people
Unleashing the cold human beast

Totally viscous
Utterly warlike
The Blue lightening
Over the Z

Under the rule of Sargon the first
Cold-hearted Sumerian conqueror
Victory assured numerous battles
Never content and so dominate

Totally viscous
Utterly warlike
The Blue lightening
Over the Z

Warriors of Ice have come!
Arisen from Ice
Sumerian Rites
Frigid Skies
Akaddian Knight

Arisen from Ice
Sumerian Rites
Frigid Skies
Akaddian Knight

Military prowess, primal supremacy, cold-blooded, warriors of ice

Totally viscous
Utterly warlike
The Blue lightening
Over the Z
