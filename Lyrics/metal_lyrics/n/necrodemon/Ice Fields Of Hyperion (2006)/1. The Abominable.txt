Footsteps in the snow, so deep and heavy
Fokelored name, of the Yetti

This mythical creature, who haunts the Himalayas
Scientific proof, forever evades us

Months and months of darkness
Wintric freezing temperatures
Frost and ice perpetual
Frozen land of the Abominable

Mountain range so tall, and blanketed in white
Bright glaring eyes, that pierce through the night

His howls and growls, are heard as echoes
Bryce legendary ice beast, who lives in the eternal snows

Months and months of darkness
Wintric freezing temperatures
Frost and ice perpetual
Frozen land of the Abominable
