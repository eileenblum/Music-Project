Fifty below, freezing cold
Alien soul, takes control
Terror strikes, in the night
From the ice, came fright!

Norwegians found, a U.F.O. down
In frozen ground, evil unbound
It all starts, morphing parts
In the dark, unearthly heart!

Terror! Terror! Terror! Terror!

Terror! Terror! Terror! Terror!

Born of death, poison breath
This madness, never to rest
Stories of old, now unfold
An evil soul, in the cold!

Hear the Infernal Roar!
