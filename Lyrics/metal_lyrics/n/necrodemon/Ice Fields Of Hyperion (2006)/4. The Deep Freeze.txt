Stainless steel tank surrounds, my body hanging upside down
Submerged in liquid nitrogen, hoping for eventual re-animation

Cryonics freeze the soul and mind
Science advances and awakens me in time

Frozen inside this apparatus, monitoring equipment displays my status
Chemicals injected by the mortician, my cells protected by perfusion

Cryonics freeze the soul and mind
Science advances and awakens me in time

Technicians made the promise
For another chance to exist
I never once imagined this
I'm preserved in Cryostasis

Neon-green tubes around my body, pumping in fluids of Immortality
I await to see other centuries, hopefully retaining my memories

Cryonics freeze the soul and mind
Science advances and awakens me in time

Whitecoats observe me day and night, Below 300 Fahrenheit
Religion and society displeased, with the halls of The Deep Freeze

Cryonics freeze the soul and mind
Science advances and awakens me in time

Technicians made the promise
For another chance to exist
I never once imagined this
I'm preserved in Cryostasis
