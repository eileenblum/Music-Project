Beware! entering now, a realm of eternal night
Sacred place to thee, with those dark hearts
Blue flames only cold, lead the frozen path!

The head of Christ encased in ice
Pentagram carved in ice filled with your Saviour's Blood!

The gates leading to, five-pointed star
Crimson blood floats, shimmering with power
Hatred for their kind, within these frigid walls!

The head of Christ encased in ice
Pentagram carved in ice filled with your Saviour's Blood!

Empire of Winter!

Cold Blue Stare, Eternally Frozen
Serving Hell, Creating Dark Power!

Empire of Winter!
