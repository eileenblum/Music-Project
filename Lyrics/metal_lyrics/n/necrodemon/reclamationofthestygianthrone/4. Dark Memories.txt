The darkness has engulfed the mind
Satisfaction only comes with her demise
Malicious cravings worsen now
Dangerous homicidal thoughts about
Vengeance brings the thoughts of murder

Can't control can't dissipate
The abhorrence the utter hate
Her fluids now spray the walls and floor
The entrails are strewn about
Her body that I once adored
Now her blood is in my mouth

The lunacy has now taken control
And the heart it grows forever cold
Insomnia and violent obsessions
Her death becomes the final solution
Adulation swiftly morphed into aversion

Dark memories!
