Violence may be offered
In the heart that blasphemes him
And that scorns nature [x2]

All shall be sealed on that day
With the bodies they've all given to clay

In the dark of unsurpassed wrath
Souls are sharing in body's death

The stars that marked are fading away
Going deeper into greater pain

It's not permitted that we stay see the fleeting vanity
Of fortune that men tear down to build a mockery

Back to the carnival of bloat
Choke back your bile blistering your throat

Allegiance we now pledge to the gospel of horns
The time has come for the other side

The other side... The other side... The other side...
