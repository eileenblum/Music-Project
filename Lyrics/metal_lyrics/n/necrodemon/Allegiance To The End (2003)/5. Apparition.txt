Phantasmal shape / I assimilate
Unholy entity / Purely haunting
Demonic thrull / Screaming skull
Pagan fires / Funeral pyre

Apparition

Ghastly features / Darkened creature
Transparent form / Embolding phenom
Remembrance urn / I've returned
Cloaked specter / From your nightmares

Apparition

I've returned from the other side
Menacing fire within my spectral eyes

To haunt the living I cannot wait
Above their bodies I now levitate

Awakened to the pain of eternal life
I entered the death sphere
And avoided the light!

During the darkness is now when I exist
The souls I haunt are cast into
The Abyss!
