Darkside / I'll find
In my mind / And dead eyes
Entwined / Denied
Satellite / Zombified

Celestial / Yet bestial
Immortal / Pure evil
Orbital / Funeral
My soul fell / I'm in Hell

I'm in a coffin floating through space
Searching for release of my burning rage

Darkside / My life
Eternal night / Dreams hostile
Astral skies / Demise
Intensified / Desires

Saguinary / Bloodthirsty
Infinity / An unending fury
In memory / Cosmically
Mentality / Insanity

I'm in a coffin floating through space
Searching for release of my burning rage

I'm in a coffin floating through space
Searching for release of my burning rage
