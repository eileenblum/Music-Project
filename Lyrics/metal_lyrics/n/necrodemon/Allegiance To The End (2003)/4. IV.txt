There's no heaven of glory bright 
Only Hell where sinners rule 
Here and now, day of torment
Blessed are those dark

Rise up great being of destruction
Extinguish those of the light
In thy majesty destroy mine enemies
For I sake no forgiveness

Say unto thine own heart
There is no redeemer
For no redeemer liveth
For no redeemer liveth

I have control over my destiny
Arise sons of fire
Visit the earth Dark Lord
Which is and liveth forever

Please Lord can you grant me
The power of the fire
To annihilate, destroy mine enemies
For meek the eternal light

Say unto thine own heart
There is no redeemer
For no redeemer liveth
For no redeemer liveth

Say unto thine own heart
There is no redeemer
For no redeemer liveth
For no redeemer liveth
