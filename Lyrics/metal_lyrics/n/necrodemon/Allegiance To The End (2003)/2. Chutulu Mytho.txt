A horror in clay / Bas-relief of my evil
House of R'lyeh / Inscribed on the pedestal

A mutated horrid creature
Beyond any mortal's grasp
Not of this world
Born before time of man

Your nightmares revolve around me
Forever controlling you mentally
All things dark and unholy
Found in my cyclopean city

Deep in the ocean / You'll find me dreaming
Dare not awaken / My wrath is unrelenting

Scream as my city rises
Glowing, unnatural, dripping
I open the gate to the Abyss
Into mankind is falling

Your nightmares revolve around me
Forever controlling you mentally
All things dark and unholy
Found in my cyclopean city
