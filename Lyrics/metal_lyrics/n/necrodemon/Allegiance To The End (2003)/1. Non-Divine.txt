The priest he speaks reading rites to death
Cast away, life ends, final breath
Never dead from the grave I rise
Blasphemy will surely bring Christian demise

Twilight falls / Spirits call
The red moon shines / Demons now rise
At dawn the priest must fucking die!

Specters call, darkened mists, they summon me
From the grave to put an end to Christianity
The feeble priest, watch him bleed perpetually
Upon the altar, I shall cast out the demon seed

Daylight falls / We stand tall
"Save me lord" / I hear him cry
At dawn the priest must fucking die!

The light fell / Straight to Hell
Consumated curse / Satanic service
It's dawn the priest he fucking died!
