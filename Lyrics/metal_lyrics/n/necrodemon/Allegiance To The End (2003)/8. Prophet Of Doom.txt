I see the future / I foretold the past
I was here before mankind
And I'll be the last

I'm a servigate of Armageddon / I'll end the earth
Laying waste to humanity
In a darkened rebirth

Born during the red moon
The prophet of doom
Behold my visions come true

Gaze into my spectral eyes / You'll lose all control
Leave your flesh behind
I'm the reaver of souls

I cause the world wars / I'm earth's nemesis
Earthquakes, storms, fire and pain
The Lord of all Darkness

Born during the red moon
The prophet of doom
Behold my vision come true

I destroy the world with magic 
I'm at on with the Abyss
Opening wide the gates of Hell
Not even Christ can save you now

My demons gather your souls taking them down
Whirling through the fiery eternity
The sun burns red, I am undead
I drink to the world's demise

Born during the red moon
The prophet of doom
Behold my vision come true
