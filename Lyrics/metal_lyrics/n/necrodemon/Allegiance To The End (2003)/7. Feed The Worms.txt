In the dead of night
Crawling towards your coffin
Hideous Nemathalminthes
Burrowing, burrowing
Always refuse the light in
Thou could not be saved

Inanimately lying
Below the hallowed earth
Nothing but human feed
For the worms to eat

Without the mark of the Beast
You'll be part of the feast
This is not a fucking dream
Your body will feed us for weeks
Rising up from beneath
Nemathalminthes unleashed

Those who put themselves
In the Christian belief
Worms satisfying hunger
Fucking six feet under

Feed the Worms! 
Feed the Worms!
Feed the Worms!
Feed the Worms!
