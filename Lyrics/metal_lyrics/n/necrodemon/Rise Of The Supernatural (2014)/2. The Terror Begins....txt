Alien features packed in dense ice
A demonic body insect like
Arctic research paranoia strikes
Mimicking man one at a time

Norwegian team, found the ship
Replication starts and becomes it
Contorted bodies morph and split
An unearthly terror in the arctic

Science awoke an ancient evil form
Frozen ground becomes bloodworn
Matters worsen with incoming storm
Hiding inside of man where itâs warm!

Slimy noises, infernal roars
Tentacles rip through flesh, spattering contaminated blood!
Dread and fear, utter dismay, human parts spidering on the wall!
