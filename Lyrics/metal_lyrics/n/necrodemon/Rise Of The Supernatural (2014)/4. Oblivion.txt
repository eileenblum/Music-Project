You darkened my spirit on this nefarious journey
Killing all Iâve known and my beloved family
Prophetic nightmares passed on through insanity
Revenge fuels the desire to put YOU in a mortuary
Your minions and clones have no power over me
Come forth with vengeance my new enemy

Iâll chase you to and beyond the grave
Through the Inter-Dimensional gate
The circles meet hovering in space
Reflecting the ending desired fate
Never again will I be your fucking slave
Take you down and banished in flames!
Awaiting / Battle / Face him / Resist him

Destroy him / Bury Him / Erase him / From all time
