Thereâs a cold chill in the air tonight
The stench of the grave is all around
Shadows are stalking causing terror and fright
Malicious beings from beyond unbound

Disturbing
Eerie
Frightening
Ghoulish

Not of this world! Not of this world!
Ghastly spirits from beyond! Cadaverous phantoms from beyond!

Supernatural!

Skeletal heads scream death in their shrieks
Vengeance on the living their lust
Apparitions are haunting feeding off of the weak
Creepy dark specters catch, rape, and thrust

Disturbing
Eerie
Frightening
Ghoulish

Not of this world! Not of this world!
Ghastly spirits from beyond! Cadaverous phantoms from beyond!

Supernatural!

They rise!
