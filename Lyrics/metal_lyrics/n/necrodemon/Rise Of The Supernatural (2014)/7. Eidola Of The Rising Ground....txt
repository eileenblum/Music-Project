Stagnant walls, this place of sorrow
Beyond the doors, Everlasting Purgatory!
Unmemorialized, timeless suffering
Once checked in, a resident forever more!

Built upon a haunted swamp
In the massively windswept hills
Experiments and injections gone wrong
In the house of the âWhite Deathâ!

Eidola are all around!
The Eidola of the Rising Ground!
Ominous Eidolons are all around!

Bodies left through the Death Chute
But their spirits have remained
Electroshock therapy on the insane
Powering an afterlife of revenge!
