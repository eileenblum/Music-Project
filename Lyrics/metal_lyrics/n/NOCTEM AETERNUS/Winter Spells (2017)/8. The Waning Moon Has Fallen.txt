The waning moon falls
The road opens its dark mouth
As I go into the shadows

Like a reverie fading away
Into the thick mist
Darkening moonless

Long walk amongst trees
The breeze freezes my soul
The waning moon has fallen

A million of stars cry
In this night
That whispers
The waning moon has fallen
