Wind howls in my mind
Tears this dark nocturnal mantle

The darkest secrets are revealed before me
In this cold winter night

A deep look lies enthroned
Deep in the forest opens the doors to the unknown

An ancient prophecy has been reflected
In the deep of the night

Spirits resurface between cursed shadows
Before the moon

The mysteries of darkness keep silent the darkest night
Between the deep fog of the forest

The moon illuminates a withered landscape
In silence and pain
