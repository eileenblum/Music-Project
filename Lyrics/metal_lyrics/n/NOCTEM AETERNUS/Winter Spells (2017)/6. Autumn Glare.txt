This frayed mirror
Possesses a brilliant light
A light that takes the fight
Out of long foretold trees
May their decrepit branches
Waver to this galante luster
And may you and I
Fade under this autumn glare

This silhouette sparkles
In the shade of a brilliant light
A light that utters
The waning words of dreams
May these shadows collapse
silently in your muted world
And may you and I
Fade under this autumn glare

And archaic mountains
Collapse to the crying voice of time
May you and I
Transcend under the glare of autumn light
This glare dances with us
Passionately
Under a firm grip
It leads us to finality

And you and I still dance in the eves
Where we were once beckoned
Only by chance in autumnâs surrendering glare
