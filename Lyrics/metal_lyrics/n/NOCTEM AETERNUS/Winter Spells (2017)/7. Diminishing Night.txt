Whom walks in the shadow shall spake it all
For whom discovers the wreckage,
Of their ship is to reap of all
He who once told of a beautiful blue night bedazzling and bright
Now must bear the requiem of his fallen stars
Drowning in the silence
Of your meaningless confession

And to the mute utterance of their screams
The sky turned to the detritus fumes of a prophet in angst
All stars glimmered
In the spastic rule of your king
You are no one, you never were and never will be
