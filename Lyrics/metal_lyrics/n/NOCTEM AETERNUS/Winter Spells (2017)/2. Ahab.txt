Twilight once fell on the flipside of this ancient stone
Built from the searing ash of a current unbound
And longing grasses once rose grasping at a fading moon
Falling in the temptation of your godheadâs light

These winds once built temples, for the sun
In flurries of frost over a realm in nothingness
A glaring shadow that shone to the heavens above ever so quietly
In the shadow of a willow, a raven foretold of darknessâ first utterance
In the bows of an unmoving ship
On the flat palette like hand of no one

So guide me Ahab
I will follow you in the promise of wonders
So follow me
I will destroy everything you built
And everything you have ever loved
For I am time, and this hand is mine to scar
