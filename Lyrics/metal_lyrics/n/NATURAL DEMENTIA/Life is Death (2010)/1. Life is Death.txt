Without a chance
You could be drowning in your blood
Going down, down, down, down
No return

All around you
Are always obstacles to jump
Filling down, down, down, down
Won t go on

Life is death now
Find your own
As soon as you re born you ll
Have to know
Life is death now
Find your own
You have to be aware of
What you ve been told

Sick and tired
You won t listen anymore
Sitting down, down, down, down
In your throne

Then you realize
It s been there all along
And you ve found, found, found, found
How to born

Life is death now
Find your own
Living among them you
Know what s wrong
Life is death now
Find your own
Open your eyes and
You will know

So you notice
Nobody could show
That these voices
Are almost always wrong

Trust your instincts
This could be the day you tell
That you re happy
And you can say they all can go to hell
