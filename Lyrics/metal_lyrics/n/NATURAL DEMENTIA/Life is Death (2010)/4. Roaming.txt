I live in this brand new house
with a white fence on the front
got a great wife and 2 kids
and I work in what I love
I have to travel around the country
I can't help it, my job demands it
hate to leave my wife and kids
cause I get to miss them loads
But every time I'm on my way
I end up in some woman's bed
I hear all my friends in my head
Who keeps telling me again and again.
200 miles away is not cheating
200 miles away [X4]
some would say your wife is perfect
there's no need for you to cheat her
I shouldn't do the things I'm doing
and still can't stop, I know I couldn't
But every time I'm on my way
I end up in some woman's bed
I hear all my friends in my head
Who keeps telling me again and again.
200 miles away is not cheating
200 miles away [X2]
And when I feel these voices gone
and I'm staying at my home
I hear the phone rings, it's my boss
Goodbye my darling, have to go
200 miles away is not cheating
200 miles away
