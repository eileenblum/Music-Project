As I navigate my dreams, I know
Important things can vary
I feel encaged I need some air
I sense, this can t be fare

Anger is growing inside of me
I do believe I m dying
As an educated fool
I followed all the rules

I read the words of the wise and their riddles
I know I have this battle in my mind

I have these wounds today
I m in distress, I m getting into
I left aside this fooling fights and started to
Hear my voice at last 

I know I have a battle in my mind
You know you have a battle in your mind too
Hear, your, voice at last
