Free rotation for emotion hunter
Angular acceleration form
Kinetic energy you are draining from me The genuine feeling inside me grows hollow
I won't stay petrified no more
It's time to find a reaction
"I'm all you're living for?"
It's all self-deception

I want to know
If you loved me so, why did you go?
Hand on my heart
Life tore us apart, please let me go
If I want to change you
If I want to change
I want to know
If you loved me so, why did you go?
Hand on my heart
Life tore us apart, please let this river flow
Halt, arrest, intercept, suspend, stop the motion, shut down, fall
Keep on, go on, proceed, prolong
Show no mercy to the slaves of system
Fire the pistons, ignite the air
The velocity makes the motor a murderer
Grind the bend of fear, your enemies will disappear
Guide me through the truth
Our feud is fueled by misconception
'cause you can't handle the truth
I want to know
If you loved me so, why did you go?
Hand on my heart
Life tore us apart, please let this river flow
