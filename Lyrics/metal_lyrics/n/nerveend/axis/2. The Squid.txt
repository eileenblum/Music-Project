Waves arise to the skies
I pull your head below theâ¦

Wall of sound from the ground
I nearly let her drown

Still I know a way down
I know a place we can stay forever now

Please tell me why I hide
I want to be despised

Distant cries unify
Turn the tide on the ground
Instead, let them drown

Wall of sound from the ground
I nearly let her drown

Still I know a way down
I know a place we can stay forever now

You won't make me a believer
Just stop, I won't flip, more likely abandon this ship

You keep me away from the light,
but who am I to say where I belong

You keep me away from the night,
I'm straying but just in my mind

Revoke life
