Now you're lost
Twisted rays of sunlight led you astray

Hold your breath
Electric veins through your bones won't find the connection
Close your eyes

Envision my affection,
you're falling through reflection, deception,
buried deep inside your lies, closed eyes

I'm afraid,
life is too short to keep walking on this crooked hallway

Close your eyes

So we let the stream carry us away,
through barren earth at open sky

Silence implies

I used to feel betrayed,
like I was only one who's broken
(Our life's awry)
Until the day you'll slay me,
the vengeance in my heart is gone

Now, wash off the blood stains from your pillow
The strength in you is in me too,
we'll find a way
Out of the confined venom willow
Don't let demise disgrace your eyes
We'll fight the day

I am yours, I am lost
I am yours, but Iâm afraid

Now, wash off the blood stains from your pillow
The strength in you is in me too,
we'll find a way
Out of the confined venom willow
Don't let demise disgrace your eyes
We'll fight the day

Now, wash off the blood stains from your pillow
The strength in you is in me too,
we'll find a way
Out of the confined venom willow
