Drink the well dry with a heart of a lion as we feed our children with cyanide
So slowly we evolve, so slow
I've been beaten down so many times
But I won't give up, I won't give up now
Oxygen evaporates
This city is sinking down, this city is sinking down
Borne by wind, the screams from the hollow louden
Sky is falling down
But I will find another horizon
I will pick up all the puzzle pieces that you Cannot find
I won't let you down
Dry your tears, this path is never ending
Tighten the knot around your finger
Thrive on fear and breed the poison seed
Just dig in deep, you can remember
Open your eyes, we are on a trial
Open your eyes, we are in denial
Everyone is doomed by failure
The distant sounds become silent as shadows burn
Sky is falling down
But I will find another horizon
I will pick up all the puzzle pieces that you cannot find
I won't let you down
The seed emits an unknown compound, the roots begin to intertwine
A sudden burst of colors filter the sky
The sound of dismay is drowned by the rumble of the ground
The rigid stem is soaring
It penetrates the ground and blooms
Now that we have found ourselves again
Pain unfurls, don't let go, hold on
Let yourself thrive
I'll let you thrive
