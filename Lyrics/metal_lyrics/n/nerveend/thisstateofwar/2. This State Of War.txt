Blind eyes turn
The disbeliever seeking savior

Liquid rebirth

You are inoculated for growing up to be a slave
To the world, to your feelings unheard

Bow down to
Only our scars reminding us,
how we learned to ignore
Your new god
It's not in my blood,
to accept this state of war

And if I want to know where this path will lead
Sirens sing

You are the keeper of way to clarity
You'll guide me

Through your dream
Find me
Finally free

Life skies burn
Underestimating death rejection

Dissolving ill fear
Will reappear as one you lost before

By every year youâll go further down
These will be your last words
You will fall
