No pride at all
You've failed to inhale the day

Burning down the homes of my unwanted offspring
Fear of tears won't justify you falling into foolish pride

Flies lay me to sleep
Nurse me away
It died way too briefly
Cold hands decay

Deprive it all

Nausea swallows me
Swallows

You told birds to
Fly by you
