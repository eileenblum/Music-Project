Sickness scaled
Injustice in love is the summit of affection

You'll pull me down again
I am the death receiver

Sustain the hope I gave

Independent need on denial
Reproduction â reward of the trial

Mercy, occult
Omen of end

Scars - prophecy amends
Your absence relates to my knowledge of connection

I'll be your next cure
as failed heart-bearer

Refrain the one in vain

Blind devotion - pseudo emotion
I feel like I'm pushed through the stencil of relation

Chain me with pain
I'll change when innocence repays
