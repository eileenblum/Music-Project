Rise...rabid race of night
Hear your reverend calling...come on...
Agitate, release the sins to be
We want to see you crawling on your knees
Execution of the righteous ones
Hear me call, listen bastard sons
Mutilation, innocence denied
From rotten soil the Judas breed will rise
Master-race, extinction justified
A mutant killing torturing device
Throw the stone of hate towards the light
Predator evolved to threat mankind
Sinister protection of it's race
A horde of plagues, blasting through the night
Judas breed spawned from demon seed
Evil dwells, heed the bastard beast
Lusciously, bloodlust draws them close
hunters, nocturnal souls
Mutilation, innocence denied
From rotten soil the Judas breed will rise
Master-race, extinction justified
A mutant killing torturing device
Throw the stone of hate towards the light
Predator evolved to threat mankind
Sinister protection of it's race
A horde of plagues, blasting through the night
It is the Judas breed
They're closing rapidly
It is the Judas breed
You wanna feel the black disease
Assassinate, reveal the rat to be
Cause of death, evil justifies
Frantically they dive into the night
Aftermath, the vultures carnal right
Mutilation, innocence denied
From rotten soil the Judas breed will rise
Master race, extinction justified
A mutant killing torturing device
Throw the stone of hate towards the light
Predator evolved to threat mankind
Sinister protector of it's race
A horde of plagues, blasting through the night
Judas breed, Judas breed
Judas breed
