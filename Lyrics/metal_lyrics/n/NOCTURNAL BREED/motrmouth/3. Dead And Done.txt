Slow down, turn around
Coced out of clue in a whiskey ghost-town
Feel the fire, feel it burn
My blood is boiling, no time to learn...oh no
Powdered lines, the razor shines
Sex, drugs, and rock'n roll to fuel my mind
I lit the fire, feel it rise
Crack down, pin down, release my lies
Blistering lips, and fingertips
Through the haze! See you move and twist
A round of gin, black leathered sin
It's time baby let me touch your skin... oh yeah
Hey I - There's a fire in my veins
Tear it down - Dead n' done - Escape the pain
You I - A meter's running at your bed
You lit the fire - But it failed to burn
And now you're dead
The instant kicks - A fucked-up fix
I know the devil's got me playing his tricks
Feel the fire baby, feel it rise
Another round and then I hit the dice... oh yeah
