Call for the steam-hammers
Tear down these walls
Welcome to the old-school
We never walk alone
A rebel to the end
Running with the pack
With the restless wolves

Howling from the gutterlands
And crawling in the underground
From rust-belt to the iron-plains
I call it Metal - And it's life in real
Now pick up your teeth it's time to fight

Pounding those fists - Fuel the madness
Stand back - Get out of the way
No bone unbroken - No boots are unthread
Raising the banner every day

There aint no one here but these bastard
The high voltage runs in our souls
Bring out those killer-watts
We're born to brake those bones
Now brothers and sisters load your guns

Hey, Bang that fucking head
Hold fast - And Thrash
(Until you're dead)
Ugly as a war-wound
Thrash like a maniac
This metal will break bones
Hear the call of the Thrashiac...

Drilling your skull like a hammer
Stark raving mad on the prowl
We are the final few kicking like a mule
Like a can of worms - Dirt-bag and proud

"All you thrashers in the back
Are you ready to attack"

Hey, Bang that fucking head
Hold fast - And Thrash
(Now break that neck)
Ugly as a war-wound
Thrash like a maniac
This metal will break bones
Hear the call of the Thrashiac...

Call for the keelhauling
Bleeding those ears
No, you have seen nothing yet
Like a thousand tons of led and stone
Banging on your cranium
For fuck's sake - It's Metal to the bone

"Oh, Come on speed metal legions
Hear the noise of that chainsaw voice
