White-line warfare is eating up your head
Fusing nerves and flesh to bone
You run until your dead
Running through the piss and blood 
Brain like a hornets' nest
You run on top your brothers dead
While fouling your own nests

Poisoning the mother lands
This fury's next to Hell
The savage smears their face like flees
Riding rats through the iron rain
It rips in veins like the Devils fist
Sweating blood in a hole in the ground 
The land will ring with the wailing
Of your widowsâ funeral-hounds

Speedkrieg - No, I won't stop until I die
Speedkrieg - Hang'em high under iron skies
Speedkrieg - You cannot holt this panzer-grip 
Speedkrieg - Now ride the carnage - Ride

Running with the devil
There is black water in the wells
Steel gazed war-fleet raving forth
Between bullets and trembling limbs
There's a death-stench drifting on the wind
Can you smell it - The worms and the gas
As the skies fills to the raping-point
With vultures and black flies

In-doc-tri-nation 
Obey the steel limb grasp
Harnessed into weapons
As you ride the storms of blight
Snarling at the gallow-moon
Come running with all Hell
Mind narrows to a pinpoint state
(Marching) To the funeral bell(s)
(Now march with death)

There is no holding back this time
There is no second chance
To live and fight under the blitz
You die in battle-lights

Pushing on forever further
In this frenzied state of mind
As the battle-lust burns through your vein
You Boil alive inside

All right
Suicide formations
Are you ready - Tension'

Speedkrieg...
There is no holding back this time
There is no second chance
To live and fight under the blitz
You die in battle-lights

Pushing on forever further
In this frenzied state of mind
As the battle-lust burns through your vein
You Boil alive inside

You climb the dead like mongrel dogs
You scream with bone dry tongues 
Side by side mind reels to dust 
Pushing on and on

Pain and hate like fuel and fire
Explodes into your veins
Consumed by carnage - Storming forth
Infernos in their eyes...

There is no holding back this time
There is no second chance
To live and fight under the blitz
And die in battle-lights

Pushing on forever further
In this frenzied state of mind
As the battle-lust burns through your veins
Boiling alive inside
