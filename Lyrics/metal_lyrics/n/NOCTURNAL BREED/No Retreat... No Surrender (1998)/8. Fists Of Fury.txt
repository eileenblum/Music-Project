Come on get up, we'll ride until the morning
You gonna ride my razors edge
We gonna dive into a pit of burning warheads
You gonna drown in a pool of boiling blood
This time you gonna learn
You're going down to burn
One touch and you'll be dead
Fist of fury in your head
Get up death shock, it's time to hit the lights
The alcohol is pumping in the night
We gonna dive into a pit of burning warheads
You gonna drink until there's fire in your head
Fist of fury in your head
Fist of fury in your head
Get up shell shock, we're on to race the light
You gonna feel the razors in the night
We gonna dive into a pit of burning warheads
You gonna drown in a pool of boiling blood
This time you gonna learn
You're going down to burn
One touch and you'll be dead
Fist of fury in your head
Fist of fury in your head
Fist of fury in your head
Fist of fury in your head
