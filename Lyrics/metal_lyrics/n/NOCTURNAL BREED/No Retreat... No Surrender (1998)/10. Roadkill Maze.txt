Hit the gas with full on speed
Solider of the wasteland track his course
Choppers funeral pulverized
Rangers leveled to the ground
He'll show no mercy - The sunrise blinds
Rip through desserts - The engine winds
Inhuman madness - Maniac on wheels
Devastation bastards - here comes Roadkill
Diehard engines roar in the night
Smell of rubber goes insane tonight
Lonesome warrior, destiny at hand
Mean man riding for his last command
He'll show no mercy - Riding fast
The midnight runner - Engines blast
Dead horizons - Grinding wheels
Son of Satan - here's Roadkill
He'll show no mercy - The sunrise blinds
Rip through desserts - The engine winds
Inhuman madness - Maniac on wheels
Devastation bastards - here comes Roadkill
Blazing steel horse - Maximum explored
Another highway terror awaits
Pulled asunder - Turbo overdrive
Hyperblast through roadblocks in the night
Roadkill - A son of a bitch
Born in the fires of Hell
Roadkill - He's here to burn tonight
He's got us under his spell
Roadkill - He lover the sound of death
Hitchhikers certain Hell
Roadkill - He's here to burn tonight
He's got us under the spell
