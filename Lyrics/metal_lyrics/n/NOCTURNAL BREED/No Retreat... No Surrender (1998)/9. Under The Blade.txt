[Twisted Sister cover]

A glint of steel, a flash of light
You know you're not going home tonight
Be it jack or switch, doctor's or mind
Nowhere to run, everywhere you'll find
You can't escape from the bed you've made
When your time has come, you'll accept the blade!
You're cornered in the alley way, you know you're all alone
You know it's gonna end this way, chill goes to the bone
Now here it comes that glistening light, it goes into your side
The blackness comes, tonight's the night, the blade is gonna ride
'Cause you're under the blade
Oh, you're under the blade
It's not another party head, this time you cannot rise
Your hands are tied, your legs are strapped, a light shines in your eyes
You faintly see a razor's edge, you open your mouth to cry
But you know you can't, it's over now, the blade is gonna ride
'Cause you're under the blade
Oh, you're under the blade
A glint of steel, a flash of light
You know you're not going home tonight
Be it jack or switch, doctor's or mind
There's nowhere to run, everywhere you'll find
You can't escape from the bed you've made
When your time has come, you'll accept the blade!
You've tried to make it to the front, you're pinned against the side
A monster stands before you now, its mouth is open wide
The lights go on, the night explodes, it tears into your mind
When the night does end, you'll come again, the blade is gonna ride
'Cause you're under the blade
Oh, you're under the blade
Ow!
Now you're under it
You're going down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Hey!
Ow!
