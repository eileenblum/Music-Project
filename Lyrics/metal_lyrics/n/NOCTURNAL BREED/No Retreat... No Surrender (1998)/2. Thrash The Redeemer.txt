Await the night - One thing in sight
Extinction of the feeble
You can not stop - Over the top
You can't resist this evil
Target in sight - Fists locked to fight
No one can stop this killer
In my mind - Going blind
Thrashing the Redeemer
Evil...Messenger of death
Precision struck - In total shock
They run towards the reaper
Complete control - Target on hold
To crush the fucking cheater
Can you feel - The beast appeals
Don't kneel towards the feeble
In my mind - Going blind
Thrashing the Redeemer
Evil...Messenger of death
"Come here...I'll teach you better"
Hellstorms and leather - Burn in my mind
No trace of mercy you will find
Pain struck - shellshock - await the impure touch
Last thorn in life and you are stuck
Await the night - Success in sight
The taste of vengeance tightens
You pray to burn - You won't return
They can't resist Hell's fire
The flash of steel - The final seal
No one can make you weak now
In my mind - Going blind
Thrashing the Redeemer
Evil...Messenger of death
