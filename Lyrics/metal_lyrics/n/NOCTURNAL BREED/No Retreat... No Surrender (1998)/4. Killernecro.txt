Relentless oppressor
The battles may come
The horned god Aggressor
Son of serpent blood
Killernecro
Oh, Killernecro
Hellborn successor
The battle cry roar
Detestor of heaven
Born in demon claws
Killernecro
Killernecro
"Here we go"
He has bleed and kissed the goat
Whipped by the wings of damnation
Warrior armed with luchious thoughts to ascend
The throne of pure desecration
Intrepid destructor
The battles he saw
He needs no salvation
Lord of evil spawn
Killernecro
Killernecro
He has bleed and kissed the goat
Whipped by the wings of damnation
Warrior armed with luchious thoughts to ascend
The throne of pure desecration
