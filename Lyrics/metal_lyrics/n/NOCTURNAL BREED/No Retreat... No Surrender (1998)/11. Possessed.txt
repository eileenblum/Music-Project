I don't need your holy hands
My black heart dwells in hell
Heed to me, ye crooked beast
My tongue the blackest spell
I don't need your healing words
I love this dark within
The hate I feel is pure inside
In my path dwells...Only sin
I don't need no holy book
I need the wicked sin
The spells I chant will mesmerize
And burn your angel wings
I don't want your feeble gods
I love this flame within
I feast upon the flesh of whores
And fuck in poisoned sin
"Here we go..."
I am possessed - The curse of Hell
I am possessed till death
I am possessed - Reborn in Hell
I am possessed with death
I don't need your holy cross
I walk the path to Hell
I lick your bleeding holy cunts
And scream in tongues, the evil spells
I don't need your holy priest
I need this black within
Heed to me you feeble scum
I am the temple of sin
I don't need your healing words
I love this dark within
The hate I feel is pure inside
In my path dwells...Only sin
"Oh, come on Mother Fuckers..."
I am possessed - The curse of Hell
I am possessed till death
I am possessed - Reborn in Hell
I am possessed till death
