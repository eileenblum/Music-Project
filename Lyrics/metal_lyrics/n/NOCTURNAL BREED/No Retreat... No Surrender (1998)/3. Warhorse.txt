Warhorse...
Black wings - The essence of life
Ride upon the ashes of this land
Violence - Accelerate command
Trapped between the sun and burning sand
Combat - Eclipse the sky
Race with the fury of the Damned
Warhorse - The poisoned seed
Sown by the rulers of this land
Warhorse...
Warhorse - The deathbird dives
Can you see the fire in the sky
Warhorse - The deathbird dives
Can you see his silver wings tonight
Blaster - The ultimate pain
Strapped to steel and dive to harvest gain
Cruelty - Artillery command
Wrapped in dust you search the ruined land
Burning - Target locked
Fire with the force of insane men
Warhorse - The nuclear thorn
Bastard born to conquer and to scorn
Warhorse...
Black wings - The essence of life
Ride upon the ashes of this land
Warheads - Eclipse the sky
Race the fury of the Damned
Violence - The poisoned seed
Sown by the rulers of this land
Warhorse - The nuclear thorn
Bastard born to conquer and to scorn
Black wings - The essence of life
Ride upon the ashes of this land
