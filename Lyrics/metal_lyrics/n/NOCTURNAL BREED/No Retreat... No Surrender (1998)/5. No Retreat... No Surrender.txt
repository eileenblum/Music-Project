Metal in the face of the feeble God
To the point of no return I go
I'm going down to burn my soul
Beast of steel prepare for war
Shadows in the harvest moon
Supernova shockwave striking
Force of thousand nuclear explosions
Closing in with ultra violence
Metal in the face of the feeble God
I'm going down to burn my soul
Racing of to burn the pearly gate
You gonna burn for heavens sake
No retreat...no surrender
Race through fire with merciless splendor
No retreat...no surrender
Again and again we'll attack and ascend you
Metal in the face of the feeble God
To the point of no return I go
The smell of leather and burning spikes
Force of metal prepare to fight
No retreat...no surrender
Race through fire with merciless splendor
No retreat...no surrender
Again and again we'll attack and ascend you
No retreat...no surrender
Black moon eclipse it's time to defend you
Intrepid warlords come join us tonight
We gonna show you pleasant sights
Witchcraft and demons black leather and spikes
The funeral pyres burn tonight
Metal in the face of the feeble God
To the point of no return I go
I'm going down to burn my soul
Beast of steel prepare for war
Shadows in the harvest moon
Supernova shockwave striking
Force of thousand nuclear explosions
Closing in with ultra violence
Metal in the face of the feeble God
I'm going down to burn my soul
Racing of to burn the pearly gate
You gonna burn for heavens sake
No retreat...no surrender
Race through fire with merciless splendor
No retreat...no surrender
Again and again we'll attack and ascend you
