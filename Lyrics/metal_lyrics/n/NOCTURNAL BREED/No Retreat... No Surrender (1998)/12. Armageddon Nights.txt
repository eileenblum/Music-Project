Beyond the titan wings of Night
The rebel field and ruins in sight
They wish me Hell and curse my name
As demons scream my name in pain
The gruesome successor
This merciless beast
Evoker of demons
From their fathomless sleeps
His eyes gaze with vengeance
Oh, His lungs filled with dust
As he crushes me slowly
And rape my soul with lust
He rapes my soul with evil splendor
And cut my veins to purify
He cast the spells of Hades
Reborn in Hell and satanized
With hooks of steel they pull me down
To feed the beast and to kiss his crown
With razor nail they cut my sin
And lick my flesh with evil grins
His black wings are crooked
His mouth filled with blood
Arising so slowly
On old broken bones
The grand death is rising
Cruel eyes open slow
A wicked voice howling
As he rapes my soul
He rapes my soul with evil splendor
And cut my veins to purify
He cast the spells of Hades
Reborn in Hell and satanized
(The curse of the old Angel)
He rape my soul with splendor
Leave no trace of life
He fills my veins with hate
Reborn in Hell and satanized
Blazing bolts of flames and thunder
Tears my soul being apart
The insane grasp of evil
Reborn in Hell and satanized
