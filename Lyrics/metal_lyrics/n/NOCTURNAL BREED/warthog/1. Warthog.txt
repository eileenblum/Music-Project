Rain death, refuse, resist
I leave this hell in blistering ave
Transcendence overlord
Through burning skies
Arches of flames engulfs the night
Remorseless, the deafening roars
Dag of reckoning, instant death
Tribulation, in a fountain of blood
Cloud burst, death from above
Dawn rises...
Steel, winged assassins engage
Wrath, powered nuclear invaders
Searching, target curtails
Closing in, it's spitting fire
Your pity glory's fading fast
Confronted with the carnal vision
Death is certain no need to hide
Fear rises...
Hell bent it dives from the skies
Raw power in thousands attack
Under a black sun you'll die
Warthog...engage
Remorseless, the deafening roars
Day of reckoning, instant death
Dawn rises...
Steel, winged assassins engage
Wrath, powered nuclear invaders
Searching, target curtails
Warthog...engage
Remorseless the deafening roars
Day of reckoning, instant death
