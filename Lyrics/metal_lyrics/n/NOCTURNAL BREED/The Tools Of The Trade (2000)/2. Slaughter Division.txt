Run fast, dying hard, fight 'till death
Racing through the barbed wire bonfire
Stand tall, kill 'em all, you came to fight
Like a thermonuclear chain reaction
Think fast, aiming low, touched by death
See the fire burning in their eyes
Raise hell, cheating death, fight 'till dawn
Bloodshed is the only salvation
Ride...to rise the flag of Hell
To predecess the feeble yell
Rise...death tolls it's the slaughter division
Ride...to rise the flag of Hell
To predecess the feeble yell
Rise...death tolls it's the slaughter division
Race on, tarring down, shotgun fire
Screaming through the battlefield war cry
Think fast, lying low, target locked
Face to face the venom in their eyes
Oh...revel in flesh my bastard souls...
War cry...endless fields of bodybags
Harvesting the dead
No time...hear them calling - the slaughter division
War cry...endless fields of bodybags
Harvesting the dead
No time...hear them calling - the slaughter division
Race on, tarring down, shotgun fire
Screaming through the battlefield war cry
Think fast, lying low, target locked
Face to face the venom in their eyes
Ride...to rise the flag of Hell
To predecess the feeble yell
Rise...death tolls it's the slaughter division
Ride...to rise the flag of Hell
To predecess the feeble yell
Rise...death tolls it's the slaughter division
War cry...endless fields of bodybags
Harvesting the dead
No time...hear them calling
The Slaughter Division.
