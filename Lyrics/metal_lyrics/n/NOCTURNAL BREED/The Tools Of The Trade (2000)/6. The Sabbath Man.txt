As he drags you to the slaughterhouse
To teach you what you need
You spit and howl, in tongues you heed
You know this time you're gonna bleed
The sabbath man - he haunts the land
It is a vicious treat, yeah!
With hooks of steel - make you beg and kneel
It's a black celebration, yeah!
As he drags you to the slaughterhouse
To teach you dirty deeds
You are hanging there like a piece of meat
All is useless, you can't escape
Oh...no escape...motherfucker!
The sabbath man - vicious bastard hand
Accumulation of evil
With rusted steel - he'll surely make you feel
That it's a black celebration, yeah!
Fresh blood - luscious - deadly juices
Reveal the skin of the rat beneath
Spine snaps - gristle - knuckles cracking
Breathing stops in a flash of time
Dead night - brimstone - fire burning
Reverberation of a jagged saw
Black mass - sabbath man - chanting
Call the plagues with a shadowed tongue
Sabbath man...sabbath man...sabbath man
...Come sit with me dear...
...And we'll make love with chainsaws...
As he drags you to the slaughterhouse
He has taught you what he means
You scream no more, he has cracked your core
It's perpetual, he goes for more
The sabbath man - he haunts the land
It is a vicious treat, yeah!
With hooks of steel - make you beg and kneel
It's a black celebration, yeah!
Oh...It is the sabbath man...
Oh...It is the sabbath man...
Oh...It is the sabbath man...
Oh...It is the sabbath man...
