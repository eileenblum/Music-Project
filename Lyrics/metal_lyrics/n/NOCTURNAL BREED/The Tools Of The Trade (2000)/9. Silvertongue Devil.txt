Here is no hope - here is no right
Come pick a card, the Devil's game is on tonight
Come step inside &amp; take a look - what do you see
...Splenderously...
Here is no love - here is no might
There's just one game, come step inside
The time is right
Your soul to pay if you don't beat the jackal face
...No mistakes...
Here is no cure - here is no wine
Come pick a card, do you feel lucky here tonight
We play it hard - it's 21 - you stand or fall
...Face the wall...
Here is no trust - here is no light
You come to play, you better get through the night
Now do your bidding
It's your soul that's on the stake
...No mistake...
You wanna play the Devil's game
You better face what's coming
Don't be sure that there is no more
If you don't cheat at the table
Silvertongue devil - burning in my soul
Got a pocket full of diamonds - fortune, fame &amp; gold
Don't you want it all - come step into the light
Oh, silvertongue devil - the game is on tonight
Here is no hope - here is no right
Come pick a card, the Devil's game is on tonight
The ace of spades you choose
This time it's do or die
...Make it right...
Here is no love - here is no might
There's just one game and you've got 7 left to fight
Your soul to burn if you don't beat the jackal face
...No mistake...
Here is no cure - here is no wine
Come pick a card, it's one step closer to the line
We play it hard - it's 21 - you stand or fall
...Face the wall...
Here is no trust - here is no light
You came to play - you picked the wrong card
Time to die
The king of hearts is not the ticket to the sky
...Your soul is mine...
You wanna play the Devil's game
You better face what's coming
Don't be sure that there is no more
If you don't cheat at the table
Silvertongue devil - burning in my soul
Got a pocket full of diamonds - fortune, fame &amp; gold
Don't you want it all - come step into the light
Oh, silvertongue devil - the game is on tonight
Your soul belongs to the Devil
You picked the wrong card, now it's time to pay...
