Step inside, this is the house of submission
Welcome to your personal Hell
I'm gonna show you all the splendors of suffering
Time to face the tools of the trade
My veins are rusted lead pipes
A nest where spiders feed
My blackened wings - the hooks you heed
In the corners of your dreams
Oh! Burn for me now
Relinquish - it's time to die
And death is your only way out
Oh! Tear flesh apart
Redemption - baptized in blood
Torment is your only salvation
A vision of Hell
I look in the mirror
Worms love my flesh
A supper on acrid skin
Oh! Bleed for me now
Intrusive - the sting of Hell
Scrutinize with no thoughts of doubt
Oh! Tear you apart
Impaling - you piece by piece
Trashed in a murderous swipe
I love the wicked - it's an addiction in blood
I always go for the vicious
To crush your feeble thought of hope, yeah
Dead horses whisper - in haunted desert winds
The beast has come to get you
Black angel hear me call your name
Alright now...
Oh! These are the tools of the trade
You mean nothing now
You will never be clean again
Oh! These are the tools of the trade
You mean nothing now
You will never be clean again
I'm descendant of Hag
Detestorous war where
No black ribbon's gonna tie me down
Submit to the tools of the abandoned land
Oh! Bleed for me now
Intrusive - the sting of Hell
Scrutinize with no thoughts of doubt
Oh! Tear you apart
Impaling - you piece by piece
Trashed in a murderous swipe.
