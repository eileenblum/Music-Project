Revel in flesh - dessilutions of the wicked
They grind inside to the rattle of bones
Devilish might - apocalyptic interventions
They tear inside with their rancorous lies
Oh, they lie...
Grimness all around me
Vicious splendors tempt my mind
As I'm sharpening the axe
I see the Devil's wicked grin
As the darkness creeps in closer
I know nothing favours me
It's a treat of death, a gift from Hell
You never would believe
Alright...
I walk the path of bones
I cheat the horrors brought on me
I am reluctant to succeed
No matter what my faith would be
A haunting fear impales my heart
Reborn for all to see
The time has come and you're the one
This time it's Hell to pay
Alright...it's Hell to pay!
Give 'em Hell - time to die - Give 'em Hell
Give 'em Hell - it is time - Give 'em Hell yeah
Give 'em Hell - time to die - Give 'em Hell
Give 'em Hell - it is time - Give 'em Hell yeah
Give 'em Hell - time to die - Give 'em Hell
Give 'em Hell - it is time - Give 'em Hell yeah
Give 'em Hell - time to die - Give 'em Hell
Give 'em Hell - it is time - Give 'em Hell yeah
Revel in flesh - dessilutions of the wicked
They grind inside to the rattle of bones
Devilish might - apocalyptic interventions
They tear inside with their rancorous lies
Betrayal all around me
Restless rawness comes to life
As I'm sharpening the blade
I see the Devil's wicked grin
Like a weapon sprung to life
I rage in fire splenderously
The time has come and you're the one
This time it's Hell to pay
Alright...it's Hell to pay this time
Give 'em Hell - time to die - Give 'em Hell
Give 'em Hell - it is time - Give 'em Hell yeah
Give 'em Hell - time to die - Give 'em Hell
Give 'em Hell - it is time - Give 'em Hell! Oh yeah.
