Hey you! I'll tear down that cross
No don't try to stop me, oh no
Or I'll bury you in dust
One move! You be sure it'll hurt
No you cannot cure this disease
It's the devil's own work
I'll tear down that cross
Time to pay - Knuckledust
Oh father, father - forgive me I have sinned
I really don't know just where I shall begin
There's been some incidents of cursing your name
But I don't give a fuck - I'm thrashin' anyway
You speak of innocence - salvation - not to lust
I've had it up to here - I say it's time to stop
I'm gonna break your bones and crack you
Piece by piece
No you can't stop me - it's a devilish disease
A thousand red lights are burning in my eyes
I've broken bones to raise my fist up to the sky
The chains I pull are rusted, jeweled with hooks
It's razor sharp - come closer, take a look
Smell my knuckles - stench of death
I'm gonna show you how I like my flesh
I'm gonna nail you to a hole in the ground
Gonna slice you up good
Till you don't make a sound
Father, father - forgive me I have sinned
I really don't care about your holy whim
There's been some incidents of killing in my name
I'm a bastard soul - I kill 'em anyway
You speak of purity - damnation and of sin
My ears are bleeding - cause Hell is where I've been
I'm gonna break your neck
And throw you to the wolves
You can't stop me now - hear the wicked howls
A thousand fires are flaring up the sky
The wish for death you fear
Come crawling deep inside
The chains I pull are rusted, jeweled with hooks
It's razor sharp - come closer, take a look
I have willingly torn my soul
And sold it to the Devil
To the point of no return I go
Without purity and redemption.
