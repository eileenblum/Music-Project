Evil eyes, they burn so wild
Pick with bones into your wound at night
Deadman's badland tries to tempt your soul
He's a hotrod lizard going out of control
Night explodes into a sight
Yellow demon, come to get you tonight
Deadman's badland tries to tempt your soul
He's a two-time sinner going out of control
You will never win
Scavenger of night
Skeletor of sin
You will never win
Scavenger of night
Skeletor of sin
In a flash, the flame's alive
Like a thunderbolt, it flares the sky
Deadman's badland tries to tempt your soul
He's a son of a bitch going out of control
With a snarl, he comes to sight
Like a locomotive through the night
Deadman's badland tries to tempt your soul
He's a reptile demon going out of control
Soak you in blood - drown you in sand
Imperative sharpness - the skeleton hand
Cut through skin - go for the core
Imperative sharpness - the skull worm law
Evil ways the flames arouse
Helter skelter in the slaughterhouse
Deadman's badland tries to tempt your soul
He's a hotrod lizard going out of control
You will never win
Scavenger of night
Skeletor of sin
You will never win
Scavenger of night
Skeletor of sin
Oh...Fuck 'ah!
