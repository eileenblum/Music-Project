Reptile rattle, the skin is alive
Two-time sinner, never dead inside
They call, they call, but it never stops
Black eyes staring, a hole in my back
Spine shaft shatters with hollow cracks
They call, they call, but it never stops, oh no!
Dead man's battle, it's zero to one
Snake eye warning, glimpsing in the sun
They call, they call, but it never stops
Restless rawness, the flame is alive
I can feel it burning deep inside
They call, they call, but it never stops, oh no!
Have you seen the luscious eyes
Strip your burning soul
Creep into your deepest thoughts at night
And lick your very core
My eyes go blind - luscious whiskey and wine
Bad bad boogie raging in my mind
Are you impatient - I got medicine for you
It's the black tooth grin
And it's all for you...alright
It is the black tooth grin
We're all dead men in leave
And you know no matter what, death will win
Reptile rattle, the skin is alive

Snake eye warning, glimpsing in the sun
They call, they call, but it never stops
Restless rawness, the flame is alive
I can feel it burning deep inside
They call, they call, but it never stops, oh no!
Skull bone daddy - the flame is alive, yeah!
One-tracked mind burning deep inside you
Black snake rattles - you know it is time, yeah!
Rebel in flesh kicking deep inside ya'
My eyes go blind - luscious whiskey and wine
Bad bad boogie raging in my mind
Are you impatient - I got medicine for you
It's the black tooth grin
And it's all for you...alright
It is the black tooth grin
We're all dead men in leave
And you know no matter what, death will win.
