Destruction - the glory of life
Stench of blood draws the vicious line
Deathflash - through haunted eyes
Gallows rule the sunset horizon
Down by law - terror strikes, prepare for more
Down by law - cruelty reigns, you face the wall
Down by law - terror strikes, prepare for more
Down by law - eat the dust, you face...the wall
Aggression - the practical tool
Wish for death, seek the battered mind
Bones crack - fists clenched in prayer
Eyes won't shut 'till you're first in line
Down by law - terror strikes, prepare for more
Down by law - cruelty reigns, you face the wall
Down by law - terror strikes, prepare for more
Down by law - eat the dust, you face...the wall
Hey! Black dawn rising - panic inflicts, reason dies
Hey! Twelve times tolling - the bell calls your name
It is time
Hey! Black dawn rising - panic inflicts reason dies
Hey! Twelve times tolling - the gallow awaits
It is time
Thoughts of insane rush for more
The execution your final call
Your body drowns in a pool of blood
The rope has tightened
That's how you get...
...Down by the law
Hey! Black dawn rising - panic inflicts, reason dies
Hey! Twelve times tolling - the bell calls your name
It is time
Hey! Black dawn rising - panic inflicts reason dies
Hey! Twelve times tolling - the gallow awaits
It is time
Down by law - terror strikes, prepare for more
Down by law - cruelty reigns, you face the wall
Down by law - terror strikes, prepare for more
Down by law - eat the dust, you face...the wall.
