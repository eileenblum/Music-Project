In moments of desire for flesh
And the tolerance is zeroed out
Helplessly psyched upon...
Steak-knives and daggers
Sharpen these blades
Slice that body
Devoted to sounds
Of ripped skin
A victim left behind in the tub
Relaxed and drenched
In dripping blood
Sliced out
Scarred
Sliced out
Scarred
For life.
