Sins of cowards revealed
Hiding without resistance
Invasion imminent prevails
No shelter can help extinction
Think fast - scrutinize
See them coming, there's no place to hide
Blood freeze - mesmerized
Rain of fire burning up the sky
Immense danger awaits
Approaching without redemption
Rat race, holocaust erupts
Closing incisive positions
Run fast - realize
When they're coming, there's no place to hide
Eyes wide - paralyzed
Violent heritage, bloodsnarl in the night
Come on sons of bitches...do you wanna live forever
Precisely - they strike for real
No prisoners spared, no mercy is given
Recklessly - they will succeed
Ritualisation of nightmares
Resistance is futile...
Resistance is futile...
Turn to face your fear
Rising with blank expression
Damnation regiments succeed
Baring down with monstrous precision
Precisely - they strike for real
No prisoners spared, no mercy is given
Recklessly - they will succeed
Ritualisation of nightmares
Resistance is futile...
Resistance is futile...
