Angels thrashing at their harps
Malignant enemy lurking the dark
Intrepid mongrel battalions rage
With weapons to obliterate
Ride the hell storm
Feel the wrath of the demons
Triumph, drink the blood of the dead
So that the wicked can always burn in me
Frantic aggressor Frantic aggressor
Frantic aggressor Frantic aggressor
Ride the hellstorm
Heaven crushed to oblivion
Triumph, apocalyptic hordes
Rancorous storms, which blows through me
Frantic aggressor Frantic aggressor
Frantic aggressor Frantic aggressor
