Tonight I gonna rape your soul
And lick the blood from your lips
Tonight you gonna sleep in black soil
And feel the devil's kiss
Watch out, here I come
The serpent son
The chosen one
Tonight you gonna ride with death
Can you feel it in your bones
Tonight I gonna make you dance
To the sound of hellion horns
Watch out, here I come
The serpent son
The chosen one
Gods of led
Pours the juices which I'm fed
A feast on flesh and bones
Screams and yells
Watch out, you're dead
Welcome life in hell
Screaming for a leather bitch
Screaming for someone to torment
Screaming for a leather bitch
Screaming for the blood you're bleeding
Tonight you gonna ride my steel
The power of metal you will feel
Tonight you gonna (worship) eat my flesh
And be cut with wire mesh
Watch out, here I come
The serpent son
The chosen one
Tonight I gonna rape your soul
And lick the blood from your lips
Tonight I gonna sleep in black soul
And feel the devil's kiss
Watch out, here I come
The serpent son
The chosen one
Gods of led
Pours the juices which I'm fed
A feast on flesh and bones
Screams and yells
Watch out, you're dead
Welcome life in hell
Screaming for a leather bitch
Screaming for someone to torment
Screaming for a leather bitch
Screaming for the blood you're bleeding
Scream for me baby
