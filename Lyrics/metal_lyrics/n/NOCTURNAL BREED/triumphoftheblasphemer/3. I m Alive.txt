[W.A.S.P. cover]

The target is me, a monster you flee
I hate what you say and you do
A mirror is there and look if you dare
The fool that you see's only you
Oh, no, you won't, nail me to you tree
Or hang my head up high
No kingdom reigns over me
Despite all the liars I see
Don't give me your
"Save my soul" cure
I - I'm still alive, and I, am a soul survivor
You can't understand, why
I - I'm still alive, and I, am a soul survivor
Damn you holy man - alive
Can't understand, the lord of the land
You heart and your head made of stone
Lay in the sand my blood on your hands
For God's sake just leave me alone
Oh no, you won't, nail me to your tree
Or hang my head up high
Restless is all I can be
Ruthless and reckless you see
I don't need your
"Save my soul" cure
I - I'm still alive, and I, am a soul survivor
You can't understand, why
I - I'm still alive, and I, am a soul survivor
Damn you holy man - alive
Force suppression, that's what you do
Tell me what's in it for you
Listen, I'm on to your game
All your lies are the same
I - I'm still alive, and I, am a soul survivor
You can't understand, why
I - I'm still alive, and I, am a soul survivor
Damn you holy man - alive
