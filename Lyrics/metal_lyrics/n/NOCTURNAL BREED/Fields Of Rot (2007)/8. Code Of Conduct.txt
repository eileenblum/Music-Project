Blood runs from the spikes of war
Retaliate
Bring your sons to their slaughter
Into a nameless - Shallow grave
To the victor belong the spoils
Enter Hell land of slime
I live to triumph in your ruins
Remorseless - Strike you down
Fast forward - Corpse-shredders
Here beats a hideous heart
Pin-pointed core of evil
Scorn defence - Will vaporize
Death is the hunter
Perfect killing machine
Necrotic interceptor
Cruel cause
Condition red - Condition dead
Weapons of war is our religion
Born without a soul inside
I've sworn the oaths
The codes of conduct
Aggressive - Deceptive we fight
No second coming - No more warnings
Here comes the cardinal day
We deal in punishment where punishment is due
You can't keep this onslaught at bay
En mass - Lay low the ramparts
We rise - Like a sudden storm
So fast - Removed from existence
In a flash - As food for the worms
