Rot-souled
She comes at night
Infested harridan
She carves the number 13 on my grave
While the ace is still at my hand
Oh... Each night when she scrapes at my soul
Oh, listen old crone
Why won't you leave me alone?
Black omen
With horrid speed
The whore of Hell I see
She burns the number 13 in my soul
Walk with sin for eternity
Oh... Each night when she scrapes at my soul
Oh, listen you fools
She won't leave me alone
Oh no, She won't leave me alone
Scything harrow
Harancle of the flesh
Out from the very maw of Hell
Her supreme savageness
Insectile and infectious
She's pounding at my gate
You bedevilled carrion woman
Come to take me to my grave
Callous and heartless
Inflictress of pain
As in the heart of every devil there's vain
She's come to root it out
Oh, Death she recommends
To cast the dice of bone
Rip the aces from my hand
Bone deep
The bitch had won
Horrendous harridan
Hacking a number 13 in my wrist
That night scything down on me
