Iron-studded - Denim-Hell
Demon - Dynamo
Forwards - You can sleep when you're dead
Let it rip - Thrashing your soul
A walking nightmare
In liquid mercury
Burning with the tombstone-courage
A parasitic Breed
Optimum arises
No need to call the priest
Invasion of the body-thrashers
Ripped to smithereens...
Cold blast - Cold run - Into neutron-fires
Born bastard to the bone
Outburst - You'll be whipped in the streets
Like a Jackal raping your soul
A walking nightmare
Famine spreads our name
Creeping through the desert sand
Sledge-hammering insane
Optimum arises
Thrashing wild from side to side
Invasion of the Body-thrashers
Systematic blight...
Pandemonic nemesis
Nocturnal in our hearts
We'll hut you down with butchers
And track you down with hounds
We'll track you down with hounds
Invasion - Through the nation
Ripe for the plucking
C'mon fuckers don't you know
This is the night of the hunters
There is no parallel
In helix synchronicity
Dancing to the doomsday-bells
You stand in silence
As world-damnation burns
Screaming out in chainsaw-hymns
You're babbling your last words
Omega rises - In hybrid sanctity
Drumming death through out the land
To the beat of nuclear winds
Spiked knuckles - Leathered Hell
Damnation - Dynamo
Thrashers - Feel the beast within, stir
The straight-jacket-waltz in your soul
