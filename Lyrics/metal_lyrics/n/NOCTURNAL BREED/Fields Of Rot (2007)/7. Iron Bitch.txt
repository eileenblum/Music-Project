All right you mother fuckers
This one is metal to the bone
On your hands and knees bitch
Com' on
Here comes the Dog-bitch
In a funerary Cadillac
Outlaw on high parole
Two faced electric Hell
"Thou shalt not suffer a bitch to live"
Hag-ridden - woman pest control
Black lizard - Fire soul
A dirt side southern twitch
Out from her rotten crib she calls
The devil on her lips
Here comes the meat-wagon
A razor eating witch
No I don't need no violins
I bleed the Iron Bitch
Saw blades and rattle snakes
Prime mover in the devils wake
No nun this one - Switchblades and lizard tails
Slut-bucket - Slut-Machine
Undertaker - She's quite obscene
A speed machine - High voltage discipline
Bad tempered night mover
She's a whip-cord seducer
Incorporated motor slut
Whoremonger demonette of rot
Drinking whiskey as if riding outta Hell
Oh, can't you tell ... No no no no
With drunken clarity
Into her serpents nest
Skull pounding rampant hag
Death dealing fever pitch
Mean Jean bitch machine
Overmedicated in the head-lights beam
Cut throat business
Cutting through the chase
