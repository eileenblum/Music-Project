Dust from bones dries out my throat
Blood fills my strangled lungs
Aiwass the angel of death awaits me
Possess my crooked corpse..... Oh.....

Possess my crooked corpse
Serpent, devil
Possess my crooked corpse
Demons, Satan
Possess my crooked corpse

Oh... Whao... Possess my....
Demons from hell....

Black coffins glimmer in the storm
I'll raise the dead from their holes
The smell of corpses fill my nose
I see black rivers thundering forth
Dark powers building up for war
Slaying the weak, possess the strong

Oh.... Can you feel it, here I come

I rape the angels
I fuck their cunts
I rip their heads off
Destruction of all

Oh... Come here, I rip you all

I sodomize the whores of Christ
I burn the holy cross
I kill their children one by one
My need is all, unstoppable wrath
Unstoppable wrath

Here I come "baby".... Oh....

Demons screaming, from fires linger on
Attack the holy, destruction is sworn
....is sworn

Oh.... Yeah....

Black coffins glimmer in the storm
I'll raise the dead from their holes
The smell of corpses fill my nose
Dark powers building up for war
I see black rivers thundering forth
Slaying the weak, possessing the strong
....possessing the strong

I rape the angels
I fuck their cunts
I rip their heads off
Destruction of all

I rape the angels
I rip them all
I rape the angels
The ripper of souls

....Argh....

I sodomize the whores of Christ
I burn the holy cross
I kill their children one by one
My need is all, destruction of a
Unstoppable wrath....
