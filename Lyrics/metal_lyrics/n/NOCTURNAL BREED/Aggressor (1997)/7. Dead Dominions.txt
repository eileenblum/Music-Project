"Bombers coming in!"

Black clouds in the horizon
As ten thousand bombers thundering front
The shadows of the forthcoming
Apocalyptic war

Show no mercy, kill em all!
total destruction, oh, I bring you war
Bombers diving in for the kill
Gods of chaos, ride with me
Ride with me, oah!

The ride of death, the way to hell
Blood soaks, the poisoned soil
The grim reaper, the man in black
He's riding with me, attack attack!

"Oh... bombers coming in!"

The ride of death, way to hell
Blood soaks the poisoned soil

The grim reaper, the man in black
He's riding with me, I'm coming in, here comes the attack!

Inferno, holocaust, the bringer of death
Blood bath in paradise, the bombers thundering front
Over dead dominions
Over dead dominions!
