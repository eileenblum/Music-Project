The harvest has come, the beast in the center
Awakens in eternal chains
Oh... his children swarms, as flies around him
The path to heaven, are given to them, to conquer and destroy old ways

We shall no longer be seized
We are the seeds of ancient serpent
We are the children of the devil
Your beloved heaven will fall

The might origo strengthens
The eternal chained ones
Watching his seeds, return to his nerves
Origo in the throne, is the reason for this kingdom

We shall no longer be seized
We are the seeds of ancient serpent
We are the children of the devil
Your beloved heaven shall fall

With bleeding eyes, the lords and the beast
And the elders of cosmos surrounds his feet
They attack their harps, with razor nails
And rivers erupts, as veins from his seat
Oh... can you see his fucking veins

Oh

We shall no longer be seized
We are the seeds of ancient serpent
We are the children of the devil
Your beloved heaven shall fall
