I'm the blackest serpent
I'm the ghost in the night
I'm the rapist of women
I suck the blood between your thighs
I want a woman to penetrate
I'm the cruellest beast you'll ever meet

I love the smell of burned skin
I'm high speed death
I make you feel you're something special
Then I'll trash you bitch
I make the sun turn black on you babe
I'll brake your every bone
I am the emperor of dark storms and death...come on!

Kiss the demon...tongue of death
Fist of metal...I'm locomotive death

Locomotive death
Locomotive death
Locomotive death
Locomotive death

Oh.. come on

Exploding energy, riding wheels of steel
Death bells pounding, blasting bleeding ears
I am the slayer, the face of death
I am the reaper, the locomotive death

Penetrating locomotive, burn between your thighs
A glimpse of hell, a flesh of light, fire in my eyes
Sodomy and death forever, with speed of light
I'll never fall, I'll rape them all, hear my screams
Bitches here I come...

Thunder in the sky... lightning in my eyes
I'm Locomotive death

Locomotive death
Locomotive death
Locomotive death
Locomotive death
Locomotive death

Yeah......!

Locomotive death
Locomotive death
Locomotive death
Locomotive death
