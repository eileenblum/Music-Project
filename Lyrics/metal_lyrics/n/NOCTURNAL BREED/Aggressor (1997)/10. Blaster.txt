Oh.......come on
On silver wings, I accelerate
I push the buttons, to obliterate
Like a vulture diving, in for the kill
With violent force, I get my thrill
In the sky, I'm flying high
Overkill, prepare to die
Bombers diving, precision drop
Combat love, take me over the top

Hungry for vengeance, your blood on my hands
I kill you all, cause I'm in the command
You'll suffer forever when I close my fist
No need for shelter, I never miss
Accelerating missiles, flaring up the sky
Violent force, is driven forth, tonight you will die

Blaster, blaster, blaster, blaster
(Kill you all)

Bombers diving, precision drop
Combat love, take me over the top

"Tell me that didn't hit the spot"
