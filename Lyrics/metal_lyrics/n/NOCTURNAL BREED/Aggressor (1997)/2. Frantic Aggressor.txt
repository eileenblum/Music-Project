Angels thrashing on their harps
Malignant enemy lurk the dark
Intrepid mongrel battalions rage
With weapons to obliterate, obliterate!

Ride the hellstorm
Feel the wrath of the demons
Triumph, drink the blood of the dead
So that the wicked can always burning me

Frantic aggressor!
Frantic aggressor!
Frantic aggressor!
Frantic aggressor!

Ride the hellstorm
Heaven crushed to oblivion
Triumph, apocalyptic hordes
Rancorous storms, which blows through me

Frantic aggressor!
Frantic aggressor!
Frantic aggressor!
Frantic aggressor!
