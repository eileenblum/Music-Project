Roar and thunder shakes the ground
Earth moves as damnation ram
Mad holocaust machines and their bastard...
... Are coming to town

Rebels from hell await the attack
Bombers, pirates and maniacs
Satanic butchers out of their lead, chain &amp; metal.
You will be dead

Disaster and doom, torment and kill
A force of insane evil in sight
Ready to capture, agonize and slay
Chaotic war, aggressive noise coming up
no piece and quiet, be prepared to fight
'cause...the metal storm rebels, got you in their sight

Rear and thunder shakes the ground... woaw...
