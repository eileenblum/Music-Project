In the dark, I carve my mark
The sign of the nocturnal breed
I lust for blood, dark virgins blood
I lust for blood... your blood...Bloodlust

When the moon has risen high, and the sun has faded black
Creeping, crawling, stumbling, rolling
The hunters of the night
Nocturnal breed... hunters of the night
(Nocturnal)

"Intrepid beasts, oh, smell the mongrel rut, the acid stench of triumph when ascend the throne of Christ and desecrate the holy fields of heaven"

Howling at the moon above
Rolling yellow eyes
Wings of leather, rising high
Hidden in darkness, tormenting at night
We lust for virgins blood
Oh...drink the blood, blood thirst, oh, drink the blood
