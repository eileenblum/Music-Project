Titan beast, superior being
Desecrator, aggressor
Abominable, pale skin
Touch dead flesh, with hunger

So impure, Lord of sin
Crawl and slither, from within
Leader of vultures, king of worms
The maggot master, feeds on the forlorn

Out from pits, of boiling blood
The perfect sin, an evil god
He rides the night, He rides the storm
Titan force, leader of worms

Battalions hunger for dead flesh
Acrid Stench of your death
Lord of chaos, lord of sin
Crawl and slither from within
Desecrator of your lives
Annihilator soon you die
Worms in legions, mutilate
Your holy body, "You won't be saved"

Out from pits, of boiling blood
The perfect sin, an evil god
He rides the night, He rides the storm
Titan force, leader of worms

Crawl &amp; Slither the maggots rape
Slimy creatures, born to hate
Slowly marching they love death
You can't escape them your in their nest
