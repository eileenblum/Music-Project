Taking over through teh land, we've
got the power. Descending others
from the sky, spiting fire. Our guns
are blazing in the fields. The enemy
dhall die. The soldiers are dead and gone
to hell, and now we've got their land

[Chorus:]
We spread our wings into the night
To fly away the sky is black
The target is waiting for our attack
We'll fight like hell the glory's arms

The lords of war, they fill our hearts
with hate from hell. In rebel lands, now
wastelands burnt to the ground
The prisoners of war, our slaves, they 
claim for mercy. The other tribes we reign
as kings, but was is endless

[Chorus:]
We spread our wings into the night
To fly away the sky is black
The target is waiting for our attack
We'll fight like hell the glory's arms
