Into the labyrinths of mind
your lies became me mad
possessed by hate and rage I'm insane
i cannot see a lot of things,
You made me explode again, but my 
stare is only at you until you're dead

[Prechorus:]
In every shadow i am
Watching your every move
Persecution from hell
You shouldn't run away

[Chorus:]
Obsessed [x3]

Your naked flesh i want
to satisfy my needs
I'll make you pay in blood for all your lies
You eat away my thoughts
in dreams i cannot sleep, but you know
You'll have to face me all your life

[Prechorus:]
In every shadow i am
Watching your every move
Persecution from hell
You shouldn't run away

[Chorus:]
Obsessed [x3]
