Alright!
I don't know what's happening
Stage is trembling hot
Just a reason to have a good run

'Cause we know,yes we know
You're hooked on metal
You're hooked on metal

Just have a thing on heaven
Don't make a fuss
We only wanna play Wanna rock

'Cause we know,yes we know
You're hooked on metal
You're hooked on metal

If it's all the same
Why don't you take it now
Only trying to save your bottom

'Cause we know,yes we know
You're hooked on metal
You're hooked on metal
