I've Got an empty mind
I've Got an empty soul
I've Got an empty heart
I've Got an empty crawl
So many people cross my way
Hundreds of people day after day
Thousands of creatures without hope
Crawling their corsses to their homes.

[Prechorus:]
Eyes of Horror are my eyes
Frighful noises are my ears
Piles of lies are my mouth
Life that in my hands fades and lies.

[Chorus:]
Inner Conflict waste my life
Inner Conflict desperate cry
Inner Conflict leave me alone
Inner Conflict I will be reborn

I know my life is sick 
I feel my blood is dead
I'm sure nobody here
can save me from this hell
Nocturnal voices break my dreams
awakening me in scream
Eating my entrails, breaking my fate,
leading my life into permanent hate.

[Prechorus:]
Eyes of Horror are my eyes
Frighful noises are my ears
Piles of lies are my mouth
Life that in my hands fades and lies.

[Chorus:]
Inner Conflict waste my life
Inner Conflict desperate cry
Inner Conflict leave me alone
Inner Conflict I will be reborn
