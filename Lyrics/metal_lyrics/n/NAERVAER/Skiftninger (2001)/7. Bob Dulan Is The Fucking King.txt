You're so fine
You've got everything I've ever wanted in my life
And when you don't need to show it,
you gotta know it
You can tell me anything, it's allright
Anytime you call, I'll be on your side
All night - Looking at you

I still need ya, cause baby you're the only baby on my mind
You can tell me anything, it's allright
Anytime you call, I'll be on your side
All night -
Looking at you
