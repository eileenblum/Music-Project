Blinded visions, false decisions
A sight of what men can do
A denial, a mistrial
Like a beast resting in a womb

Millions dying, nations lying
Money talks and oil rules
Politicians, false religions
Leading mankind to its doom

Pride and egos, white and Afros
Hate decides lives of some fools
Burned forests, desert lake sands
Human race facing its tomb

While control lies with a few
World will suffer and people
Until we all rise up 'n fight
We'll face the ground

So rise now
United, we are one
And unstoppable
Exactly what they'll fear

Living evils, dying seals
A sight of what greed can do
Children dying, global warming
Like the beast laughing at you

Staging conflicts, forging motives
Bullets always tells the truth
Devastation, deforestation
You do nothing 'til it does you

While control lies with a few
World will suffer and people
Until we all rise up 'n fight
We'll face the ground

So rise now
United, we are one
And unstoppable
Exactly what they'll fear

Then we'll regain
This power and make it all work out
(Make it all work out)

Then we'll regain
What's been always ours
