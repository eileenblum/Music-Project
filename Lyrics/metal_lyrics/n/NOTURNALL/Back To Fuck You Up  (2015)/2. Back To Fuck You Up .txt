You've made a mess
Than ran and hide into a hole?
You just don't care about anyone

Forged some moves to be accepted
Than stains our flag

We took you in, gave you our bed
Worked as slaves
It doesn't matter what some people said
You better believe, what you did
To us will make us eat your soul

You're a freak, a pile of shit
You don't know whom you're messing with

So that's why I'm going 
To hunt you down
You better run motherfucker

We'll never give up so we're back
Somehow we're back to fuck you up

Back to fuck you up
Back to fuck you up
Back to fuck you up
Back to fuck you up

Don't lie to us
We all know what you've done
We won't forget or ignore the truth

So cry like a bitch... you make us laugh
You deserve this hatred

What do you mean you don't own us?
That's all in our head?
It doesn't matter... the facts says you do
What we see is more than enough 
To dethrone you

We're telling you
It's all over, you're done

Get the fuck out

So that's why I'm going 
To hunt you down
You better run motherfucker

We'll never give up so we're back
Somehow we're back to fuck you up

Back to fuck you up
Back to fuck you up 
Back to fuck you up
Back to fuck you up

[Solo]

We'll never give up so we're back
Somehow we're back to fuck you up

Back to fuck you up
Back to fuck you up 
Back to fuck you up
Back to fuck you up

Back to fuck you up
