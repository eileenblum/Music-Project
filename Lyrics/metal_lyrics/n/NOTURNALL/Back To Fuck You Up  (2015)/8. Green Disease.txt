You're made to build a reign
To rule and accumulate
I'm here to show you that our life
Is more than profit and gain

Your word of order is "deal"
A rendezvous of pain
Your lame scheme is to make us
Owe everything

You were conceived to slave
Mankind, the entire race
We're hostages of your game
Business plans and debts from hell

This addiction to you is a fucking plague
Those deaths caused by you 
Seems to never end

The blood is flowing
Green becoming red
This gold fever

The price of your life's been set: none

Your world is a masquerade
Your paths, a nowhere maze
Financing genocide, child's kill
War and plagues

You bring the worse in man
So we're dying
You've made the whole world believe
You're God almighty

The blood is flowing
Green becoming red
This gold fever

Profit worth more than life

Sometimes I wonder how we've came to this
Almighty dollar is the king
I want a world united
Pro life, against greed

Desire, lust and avidity
So money rules humanity
I want a world without this
No more green disease

Our God is green
A fucking plague
Our God is mean
A fucking plague

Our God is green
A fucking plague
Our God is mean
A fucking plague

[Solo]

The blood is flowing
Green becoming red
This gold fever

Profit worth so much more than life

Sometimes I wonder how we've came to this
Almighty dollar is the king
I want a world united
Pro life, against greed

Desire, lust and avidity
So money rules humanity
I want a world without this
No more green disease
