We're tired of it all
We're sick and tired
You're fucking here to steal 
And lie, lie

Your ability to dissimulate
It's amazing how low you can play

No more
No more of this mess
No more
No more of this mess

You have no shame at all
Or try to hide it
We're here to put you down
Bye, bye

We say "no more" to you crocked behavior
We say "it's more than a time for a change"

No more
No more of this mess
No more
No more of this mess

For how much more will be turned down?
(To take back all control)
Hey, for how much more?
We'll be pushed around?
We're sick and tired of it all

Hey
Let's solve this once and for all
They think we're afraid to try
Let's go, right now
They want us to fail

Let's make this time, our time
They think we're afraid to fight
Let's go, right now
We won't to give up

[Solo]

Deceived us
With false numbers as an act
With empty promises more than once
You've fucked us up
With stealing and cover ups
You're a piece of shit

Deceived us
