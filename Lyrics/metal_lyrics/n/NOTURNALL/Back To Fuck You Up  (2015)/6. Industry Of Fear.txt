Among their lies and schemes we're living
Ruled by crocks and fools
But when we try to think by ourselves
We drown on their vomit pools

Breathing their arrogance we're choking
Trying to think, we lose
Believing those bullshits we're been fed with
We're nothing more than fools

Terror, wars
W. m. ds
Fear is tha fuel
Terror, gores
Viral war
Fear is tha tool

Terror, laws
New diseases
Fear is tha fuel
Terror, storms
Civil wars and pain

Fear is the fuel that keeps world in motion
Fear is the ultimate tool
Believe those things they're buying us with
We're nothing more than fools

Terror, wars
W. m. ds
Fear is tha fuel
Terror, gores
Viral war
Fear is tha tool

Terror, laws
New diseases
Fear is tha fuel
Terror, storms
Civil wars and pain

Fear is the way to mass control
It's the key to rule us all
We're taken by its voice
(Industry of fear)

Bow down in front of it
Feel its power in command
We are what fear want from us to be
Industry of fear

[Solo]

Fear is the way to mass control
It's the key to rule us all
We're taken by its voice
(Industry of fear)

Bow down in front of it
Feel its power in command
We are what fear want from us to be
Industry of fear
