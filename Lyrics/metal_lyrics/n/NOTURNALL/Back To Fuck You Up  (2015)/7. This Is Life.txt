Close my eyes and go
Defying fear
Defying gravity
I've waited all my life
For this chance (this time)

Hold my breath and jump
Embracing life
Embracing what is there
The wind as my guide
Let it blow

It's time
To open arms
The abyss is waiting
It's time to face my fears
It's time to meet my fate
I'm here

Roll the dice again
No doubts about it
That life is just a game
So you have to try
But sometimes wait

If there's a line to cross
You'll never know
'Till when you push more than enough
Than you'll know yourself
It's all you need

It's time
To open arms
It's time to take a chance

This is life
It's about actions
Deal with time
And live each moment

And live by love
You must learn life is right now
This is life
So let it flow
On and on

Death calls
The only thing is for sure
Death calls
You better live your life

Death calls
Live hard until you die
Whatever you do defines
Who are you and how you'll die

Don't fake your life
Don't fake your life

â¦

It's time
To open arms
It's time to take a chance

This is life
It's about actions
Deal with time
And live each moment

And live by love
You must learn life is right now
This is life
So let it flow
On and on

You must learn life is right now
Deal with time
And live each moment
And live by love

You must learn life is right now
This is life
So let it flow
On and on
