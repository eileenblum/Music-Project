Since our day one
Human kind has been guided
For sure we're not alone

From our heart
To the Milky Way
What is out there we don't know
This unite us as a race
Our origin and future

From a dot
To outer space
We'll find out real soon
We're not the only race
That's out there in the world

No way, we are not alone

The Pyramids
The Stonehenge
Vimanas
Nazca lines

Wondjinas
Crop Circles
The Carnac
Puma Pumko

For sure we're not alone

From our heart
To the Milky Way
What is out there we don't know
This unite us as a race
Our origin and future

From a dot
To outer space
We'll find out real soon
We're not the only race
That's out there in the world

No way, we are not alone

[Solo]

Since our day one
Human kind has been guided
For sure we're not alone

From our heart
To the Milky Way
What is out there we don't know
This unite us as a race
Our origin and future

From a dot
To outer space
We'll find out real soon
We're not the only race
That's out there in the world

From our heart
To the Milky Way
What is out there we don't know
This unite us as a race
Our origin and future

From a dot
To outer space
We'll find out real soon
We're not the only race
That's out there in the world

No way, we are not alone
