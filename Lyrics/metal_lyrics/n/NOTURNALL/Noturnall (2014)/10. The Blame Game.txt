You've changing me for anyone
And it turns my inside out
You play my heart for everyone
And I just cannot do the same

I guess I'm seeing things, as I want to see

You play your game with everyone
But if you ask me if I love you, I do
You make me believe I'm the one
'Till the first drop of jack you take

I guess I should be asking myself
This part is not for me to play
I know your smile confuses me
But now is enough

Take me back to my real life
Take me back before I ever met you
In this blame game, I'm the one to blame
When we play this game is all about me
