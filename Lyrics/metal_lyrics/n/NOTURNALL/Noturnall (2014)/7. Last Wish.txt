Standing in front of my grave
Cold wind kiss my face
All my future is gone, no tomorrow nor fate
I'm dying...

Never thought I could bleed
To grow old took for granted
All my promises and goals, I won't be able to keep
I'm sorry

Words won't work
Regrets are useless by now

So I am what I have done
All I left behind

All that I want is to live in your conscience
All that I wish is to live on your heart
So when you think of me
Please remember of my last wish
Someone, someday please sing this song

Wonderful world
What a great wonderful life
That I was blessed with
So I'm asking just this much, please

Cry won't work
Sorrow is useless by now

So I am what I have done
All I've left behind now is gone
So believe me
Please!

All that I want is to live in your conscience
All that I wish is to live on your heart
So when you think of me
Please remember of my last wish
Someone, someday please sing this song

Standing in front of my grave
Cold wind kiss my face
All my future is gone, no tomorrow nor fate
I'm dying...
