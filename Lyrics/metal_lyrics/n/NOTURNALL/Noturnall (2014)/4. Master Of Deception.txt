You won't have my life, you piece of shit!
Everything I have is gonna set you free?
All these smiles means desire
What you give is no tomorrow
Living by your misery

Everything you do is hollow
What you give has no value
Overcome with envy

"I want your life
No more disguise
I want your life
Your life will be mine!"

You just don't want my life, you want a piece of me!
Everything you do is about yourself
All this greed that moves your life
Shows how tiny you really are
Master of deception

"I want your life
No more disguise
I want your life
Your life will be mine!"

Pain maker
Soul eater
Frustated
Until you die...
