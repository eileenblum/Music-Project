It's getting hard to face reality
The time is crawling under my skin
I don't know how
But it feels like the skies
Are about to fall down
And there's nowhere to run

But I'm ok!
I'm alright!
Just say to me it's fine!
It's ok, it's alright!
So I won't mind...
The whole world is falling apart
But I'm of the case, I'm off to space
With my sugar pill yeah

It's getting late for me to fix all this
There's no time to make things work again
I don't know why life chose me
Or why I'm still around
All I need is my sugar pill
