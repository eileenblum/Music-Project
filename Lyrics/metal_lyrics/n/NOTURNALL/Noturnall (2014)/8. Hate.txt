Hate!
Fuck your hate!
Everything you send out there 
Will come back to you!

When your fears are in command...
When this void is all you have...

Are you lost in the dark?
Cold blood in your veins?
Do you feel depressed?

I just want to help and remind you
That everything you do will find its way 
Back to
Back to you!

Hate!
Fuck your hate!
Everything you send out there 
Will come back to you!

Hate!
Fuck your hate!
Everything you want
You just might get it soon...

Are you lost in the dark?
Do you feel depressed?

When you're mean and it's ok
Put a smile on your face
When to lie is great

I just want to help and remind you
That everything you do will its way
Back to
Back to you!

Hate!
Fuck your hate!
Everything you send out there 
Will come back to you!

Hate!
Fuck your hate!
Everything you want
You just might get it soon...
