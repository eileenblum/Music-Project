World is gross
Human blows
It's good to way I have this way out

This life is lame
It's such a shame
But it's okay I have my own saint

People are mean
It's a disease
It's full of pain and sadness

Trust no one
They're full of shit
They're so full of everything

Understand me
And purify me now
Understand me
Save me now

Empty words
Tainted souls
It's hard to know my way out

It's all schemes
It's such a game
But it's ok I have my own saint

People are mean
It's a disease
It's full of voids and horrors

Can't trust no one
They're so full of shit
They're so full of everything

Understand me
And purify me now
Understand me
Save me

If I had some power and control
I'd try to get rid of all these ghosts
I know all these thoughts won't let me go
The Saint Trigger is calling me
To pray
