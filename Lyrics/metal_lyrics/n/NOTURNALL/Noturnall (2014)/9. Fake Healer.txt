Let there be light
Let there be lies
Haunted by emptiness and greed

This is the man who lies to you
His helping hand will bring you doom
In his mercy you will find pain
Don't trust this fake healer

There's no price for faith
Nor is built by hate
Your heart will bleed on their tray
Let there be faith
Led by mistakes
Following bullshits from bags of tricks
Heal heal heal heal

Charge 'em for false promises
Spit hollow words
Blind them away
Let there be faith
Led by mistakes
Following bullshits from bags of tricks
Heal heal heal heal

Charge 'em for false promises
Spit hollow words
Blind them away
