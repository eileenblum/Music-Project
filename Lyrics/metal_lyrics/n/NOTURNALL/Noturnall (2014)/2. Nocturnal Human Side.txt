[Compositor: Thiago Bianchi / Russell Allen]

You can transcend your natural being
Outgrow your spiritualness
The drop will find its purpose
When the river finds the sea
I know the fear, your fear...
It won't let you go
No!
Know yourself!
I think it's time for you to duel
Do you!?
Walk the line or go to hell
There's no win when there's no pain
Nor peace in runaway!

We live, we change our way to see all things
There's light when there's no hate
You don't know how many hits you can take
Know thyself!
Search it!
Who might you be, for real?
Underneath the flesh
Inside, there you'll find the light
Ohh!
Wise up!
There's no way to escape this
This nocturnal human side
Is to become what you already are!
You're a Monster!
Try to know thyself!

Search it!
Who might you be, for real?
Underneath the flesh
Inside, there you'll find the light
Ohh!


Wise up!
There's no way to escape this
This nocturnal human side
Become what you already are!

Oh!
