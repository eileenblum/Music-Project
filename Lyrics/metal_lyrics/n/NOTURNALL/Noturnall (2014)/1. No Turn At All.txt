No changes in my life
My soul as good as dead
When dreams do not apply
It's time to change!

No turning back
No turn at all
This time I feel
That it's my life to go

No turning back
No turn at all
I'm calling
Straight from hell

Fire
It's burning inside
Fuck this
I'm coming for you
Fighter
This is what keeps me alive
You feel
How hard my strength can hit

This change will fix my life
My fate is calling me
There is just a few shots in life
Now this is it!

No turning back
No fucking turn
A late turn is better than no turn at all

No turning back
No turn at all
I'm calling
Straight from hell

Fire
It's burning inside
Fuck this
I'm coming for you
Fighter
This is what keeps me alive
You feel
How hard my strength can hit

No other place for me to go
I know here's where I belong
There's no other goal!

Stronger
Fuckin'
Better
Here's where I belong
Hunger
Fuckin'
You all
There's no turn at all!
