We've lit the watch fire
We've forged the path
Blood partisan
(Hunted, gathered)
While they turned their backs

They come crawling back
Spineless cowards on their knees

Flush out the ratlines
Bring the filth to the light
Repulsive defectors
Send them back where they belong

John Gianelli: bass, vocals (backing)
Taylor Young: drums
Todd Jones: vocals, guitars


Thanks to whereamichinaski for sending track #2 lyrics.
