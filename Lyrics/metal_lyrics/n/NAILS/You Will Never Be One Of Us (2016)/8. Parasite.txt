Syringe administered
Pills to give you pride
Sordid scourge parasite
I'll swing the scythe

Nothing will stop me

Inferior peers
Up against the wall
Gun pointed at their culture
Laugh at their downfall

Only in their land of nod
Can they play god

Desecrate them all
No one will weep
When the drug culture wasteland sheep
Are all put to sleep
