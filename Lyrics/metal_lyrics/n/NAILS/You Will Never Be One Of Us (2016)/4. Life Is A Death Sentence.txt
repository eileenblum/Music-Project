Born guilty into this prison
They won't be forgiven

Consumed with vengeance
Life is a death sentence

Tormented screams come from the shadows
Torn from the womb, placed in the gallows

Guilty, sentenced to death

Verdict reached, judgement passed
Rope around the neck, sentenced to death
No mercy, I won't make it quick
Leave you in a shallow ditch

They will not be forgiven
