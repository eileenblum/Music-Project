No truth
All lies
Disgrace
We are not the same

Fuck your trends, fuck your friends
Fuck your groupies that try to pretend that you're down
You're fucking not
Nobody wants what you've fucking got

You will never be one of us

Our pain is not your pain
Our pride is not your pride

No truth, no trust
You will never be one of us
Soaked in disgust
You will never be one of us

This is not for you to claim
We are not the same
