Dead since the day of birth
Oppression by desire
The past is a scar
A reminder of my failures

Reject the lies
Live by your spite
What you feel is right
Abandon all life

Trapped in a world rejected
Darkness consumes all light
Wield the fucking blade
Pierce with fucking hate

Utter contempt for their weak ignorance

Your will is beyond what those cowards possess
Embrace your vision with no neglect

Drop out of the race
Burn through life as a knife to their faith
