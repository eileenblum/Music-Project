Hate won't hide these wounds
No coming back from your abuse

I'm the wreckage you left
I'm the wreckage that crushed you

No cause; caught in your violent tide
The effect will be your demise

You expect faith but parade as a whore
You got your fair share but you took more

You have abandoned everything you've loved
