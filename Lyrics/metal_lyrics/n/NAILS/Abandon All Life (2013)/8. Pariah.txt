So idle you sit
On your throne of shit
Making claims
That you'll later regret

Fool for abuse
In all you lose

So highly esteemed
Blind sheep lead blind sheep
You won't show
To maintain your control

It's so easy to talk about me
When you'll never come and see me

It's all the same
A pawn in their game
Your name is a shame
