[Solo 1/3]

[Whispered:]
It's a unique moment
When two worlds collide
This tiny moment
Like scratch in time
Somehow you realize
Nothing is permanent
Your life, your descent

[Solo 2/3]

[Solo 3/3]

[Whispered:]
And in the end
You are wandering all alone
So sick and so cold
Trying to find your way home
All alone
All alone
