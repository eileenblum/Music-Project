You only see what your little mind allows

You see
What has been seen
You say
What has been said

Laughing straight in your face
As I spit on your grave
So wrong for so long
From high above you'll fall

[Chorus:]
Lame, so lame
Your way to go
Slave, what you've become
You're feeding the plague
Still loosing every round

You only see
When your eyes are shut

You see
What has been seen
You say
What has been said

[Chorus:]
Lame, so lame
Your way to go
Slave, what you've become
You're feeding the plague
Still loosing every round

(You see)
(What's already been seen)
(You say)
(What's already been said)

[Solo - Freyberg]

Laughing straight in your face
As I spit on your grave
So wrong for so long
From high above you'll fall

[Chorus:]
Lame, so lame
Your way to go
Slave, what you've become
You're feeding the plague
Still loosing every round
