We came from nowhere to
Take care of all you scums
We stand for what we believe
Even if it tears you to pieces

Don't dare to resist us
Ya won't stand a slightest chance
Watch how we take over
This ruined community

Hear our commands and obey

[Chorus:]
Heeey
Watch the new wave
Prepare to step down
And see what's yet to come
Wake up
Abandon alien-mind
We'll break this corrosion
And show the way out

We came from nowhere to
Take care of all you scums
We stand for what we believe
Even if it tears you to
(Pieces, pieces, pieces)

We gave you reformed mind
Control to define
Restoered your altered views
End of machination
Here our commands and obey

[Chorus:]
Heeey
Watch the new wave
Prepare to step down
And see what's yet to come
Wake up
Abandon alien-mind
We'll break this corrosion
And show the way out

[Solo - Freyberg/Sartanen/Puikkonen]

[Chorus:]
Heeey
Watch the new wave
Prepare to step down
And see what's yet to come
Wake up
Abandon alien-mind
We'll break this corrosion
And show the way out

[Chorus:]
Heeey
Watch the new wave
Prepare to step down
And see what's yet to come
Wake up
Abandon alien-mind
We'll break this corrosion
And show the way out
