[Japanese Bonus Track][Chorus:]
I Don't wanna be
I Don't wanna be me
I Don't wanna be me anymore

Ever throwing at his home
Two glass houses, twenty stones
Fourteen yellow, six are blue
Could it be worse?
Quite doubtful

[Chorus:]
I Don't wanna be
I Don't wanna be me
I Don't wanna be me anymore

[Chorus:]
I Don't wanna be
I Don't wanna be me
I Don't wanna be me anymore
I don't wanna

Two steps forward, three steps back
Without warning, heart attack
He fell asleep in the snow
Never woke up, died alone

[Chorus:]
I Don't wanna be
I Don't wanna be me
I Don't wanna be me anymore

[Chorus:]
I Don't wanna be
I Don't wanna be me
I Don't wanna be me anymore
I don't wanna

Please don't dress in black
When you're at his wake
Don't go there to mourn
But to celebrate

[Solo]

Please don't dress in black
When you're at his wake
Don't go there to mourn
But to celebrate

[Chorus:]
I Don't wanna be
I Don't wanna be me
I Don't wanna be me anymore

[Chorus:]
I Don't wanna be
I Don't wanna be me
I Don't wanna be me anymore

[Chorus:]
I Don't wanna be
I Don't wanna be me
I Don't wanna be me anymore
