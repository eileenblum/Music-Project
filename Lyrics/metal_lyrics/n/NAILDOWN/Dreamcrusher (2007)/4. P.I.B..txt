Naildown crew, take your positions
Close your doors and cross check the exits
Prepare for lockdown

A determined rage flows
From the deepest gutter of my soul
Fragility has bassed by, hatred ahead
Lethal mode on

Something to say?
Excuses only?

[Chorus:]
No more kindness
I'll show where you stand
No more pleasure
It's time for damage
Pay... back... is... a bitch

[Solo 1/2]

Elimination my gift to you
Your sins I'll make you swallow
Three seconds is all you have
Before I'll put you down

Something to say?
Excuses only?
(Excuses only?)

Eeeah

[Chorus:]
No more kindness
I'll show where you stand
No more pleasure
It's time for damage

[Chorus:]
No more kindness
I'll show where you stand
No more pleasure
It's time for damage
Pay... back... is... a bitch

[Solo 2/2]

Something to say?
Last words only...

[Chorus:]
No more kindness
I'll show where you stand
No more pleasure
It's time for damage

[Chorus:]
No more kindness
I'll show where you stand
No more pleasure
It's time for damage

[Chorus:]
No more kindness
I'll show where you stand
No more pleasure
It's time for damage
Pay... back... is... a bitch
