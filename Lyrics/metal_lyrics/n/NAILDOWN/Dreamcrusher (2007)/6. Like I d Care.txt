Just a wounded soul
That's left to go on, my soul

Just shattered remains
Are all that I have left
Burned, broken, dead inside
Nothing to lose

Every time I fly high
You bring pitch-black skies
(That's what you do)
Your mind designed
Only for the weak

[Chorus:]
Like I'd care
If you try to nail me down
Like I'd care
So broken, nothing to lose
I won't break
I won't bleed anymore
I won't take
Your stabbing anymore

Just a wounded soul
That's left to go on, my soul

Just shattered remains
Are all that I have left
Burned, ripped, inside out
Yet alive

[Solo - Freyberg]

Your mind designed
Only for the weak

(Like I'd care)
(Like I'd care)
(Like I'd care)

[Chorus:]
Like I'd care
If you try to nail me down
Like I'd care
So broken, nothing to lose
I won't break
I won't bleed anymore
I won't take
Your stabbing anymore
