Yaaaao
Eah

Pain, sorrow, contorted relief
No life left, leftto wake
What next? Where to go? Where..?
Second chance, new beginning
Sealed and denied

Gone, all gone, years swept away
Gloom persists, bliss vanished for good
Spare me from my damnation
Let me go for this very last time

[Chorus:]
Dreams are crushing down
Surrounded by walls I beg you to:
Please, take what is left
Don't freeze my soul
Set me free

Wiped out, this world I had
Shades left, devastation all around
What next? Where to go? Where?
Second chance, new beginning
Sealed and denied

[Chorus:]
Dreams are crushing down
Surrounded by walls I beg you to:
Please, take what is left
Don't freeze my soul
Set me free

Don't let me down
Don't be my dreamcrusher
Take away my dreads
Lay down, lay down my soul

Go

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Dreams are crushing down
Surrounded by walls I beg you to:
Please, take what is left
Don't freeze my soul
Set me free

Don't let me down
Don't be my dreamcrusher
Take away my dreads
Lay down, lay down my soul
