I'm getting sick of these
Hypocrite preachers

Spreading like a disease
Below level zero
Don't say a word
Save your breath

Your little Devil's mouth
Just won't shut up

You'll never get
Anyone's blessing

Don't say a word
Save your breath

[Chorus:]
I'm...
I'm not so blind
I see through your lies
I'm not that blind
Your disguise
Your demise

[Solo - Sartanen/Freyberg]

I'm getting sick of these
Hypocrite preachers

Don't say a word
Save your breath

Spreading like a disease
Below level zero

Don't say a word
Save your breath

[Chorus:]
I'm...
I'm not so blind
I see through your lies
I'm not that blind
Your disguise
Your demise

I'm not that blind
Your disguise
Your demise
