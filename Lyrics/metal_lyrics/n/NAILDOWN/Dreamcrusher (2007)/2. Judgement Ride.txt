It's a twisted world I'm living in
It is such a bad dream I'm in
This is something I could not foresee
This is something that I don't need

You wanna succeed?
Never take off your mask
One way, one aim
Take it, use it, crawl for it

Want to present a converse illusion?
Want to cheat yourself and be satisfied?
Want to be like you have never been?
Does it make you feel like a fucking god?

You wanna succeed?
Never take off your mask
One way, one aim
Take it, use it, crawl for it

Another failed case
On a judgement ride
Yearning for decay
Cherishing the false will remain

It's a twisted world I'm living in
It is such a bad dream I'm in
This is something I could not foresee
This is something that I don't need

[Solo]

Another failed case
On a judgement ride
Yearning for decay
Cherishing the false will remain

Another failed case
On a judgement ride
Yearning for decay
Cherishing the false will remain
