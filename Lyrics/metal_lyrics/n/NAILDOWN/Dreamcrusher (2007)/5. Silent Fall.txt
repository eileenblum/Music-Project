On this dead night I stare at
Where this angel used to lie
Caress of your shadow
(Shadow)
Is my cure

And I follow
You to beyond
And it feels so warm
Together we lie

Shadows passing by
Where the ashes used to lie
You never said goodbye
As I watched you fade away

And I follow
You to beyond
And it feels so warm
Together we lie

[Chorus:]
Silent fall binds me to you
And it feels so warm
This light, so bright
Feels so calm
Together we lie

[Solo 1/2]

And I follow
You to beyond
And it feels so warm
Together we lie

[Chorus:]
Silent fall binds me to you
And it feels so warm
This light, so bright
Feels so calm
Together we lie

[Solo 2/2]
