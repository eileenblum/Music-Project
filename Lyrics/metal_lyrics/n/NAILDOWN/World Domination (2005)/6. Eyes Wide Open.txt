Shivering I stand
Obtrusive noise nearing
Faces passing by, among the others I hide
Your eyes fell on me, your glance, so cold
I'd love to see you lying
Eyes wide open
Feel my remedy

I wish you were dead - I don't regret
Wish you were dead - as cold as your heart
Wish you were dead - rotten to the core
Wish you were dead - lying eyes wide open

Several times and nights
You seed your lies
And drew my life
Dream I used to live, faint memory
You never prevailed to me
You shut the door in my face
You stabbed my back
And you laughed
I'll never forget those eyes
And my hate for you
