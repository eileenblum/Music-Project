I watch you come in to my circle
See you as my redeemer
I hear you shouting in my head
See me as your friend

You're setting my life to next infinity
Beyond the haze you force me to stay

Don't wake me now
The morning brings glimmering
Ghost for me
You know how
I'll never find what I'm looking for
Without your guidance

Seeking no more
Fulfilling the needs I never had
You're what I'm looking for

Take me now
The morning brings glimmering
Ghosts for me
You know how
Set me fee
