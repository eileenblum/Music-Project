Tell me what you see
Is it just dream or fantasy?
Tell me what you feel
Is it just hate or bitterness?

Release all your emotions
Make them dominate

Tell me what you fear
Is it just your imagination?
Escape from external form or
Beginning of a new stage

Glowing spark near ahead
Still away from reality
Illuminate your descent
Make your world dominate

Tell me what you see
Is it just dream or fantasy?
Tell me what you feel
Is it just relief?
