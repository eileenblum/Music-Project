From nowhere they appear, so blown up, fake they are
Just a shell - astray inside
So high they fly, just pretenders with empty lives
Preaching meaningless words to survive

Swells with pride, fool's life dies

Dwarfed mind no life
All slowly fading
No matter, what you say
You prolong your fate

Open your mind to see, the lies you spread on
Full of wisdom turns into plague
Before that one time, the point you stare at your final drop
Never realize how low you'll get
