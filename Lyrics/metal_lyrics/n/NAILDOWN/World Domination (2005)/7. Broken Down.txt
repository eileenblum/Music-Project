Every time I look above
No shooting starts in my sight
I'm just a waste of good human material
I just let my life go down the drain
All I need is a bottle of gasoline
It doesn't matter if I'm melting my brains

Downfall sings in my head, screams at me
Burn me - in my broken down palace
I'm dead anyway

Every time I look above
No shooting starts in my sight
Hey you so called god
Why did you leave me alone?
Why do you hate who I am?

Just shadows with me
Can't you hear me? I'm shouting
Shattered palace is all that I have
My cards are doomed, I'm going down
