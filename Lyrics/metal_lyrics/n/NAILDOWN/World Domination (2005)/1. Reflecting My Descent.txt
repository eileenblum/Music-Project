Destroying myself, I never feel love again, only hate
Meet my world, confused and cold
I am not afraid to kill, I am not afraid to die
Witness my madness and pleasure
Taste my world and say goodbye

Hopes denied, seal the gates of my life
Hear me cry, before I close my eyes

Destroying myself, I never feel love again, only hate
Stain in the mirror, reflecting my descent

I stand for no-one 'cause no-one stands for me
Wicked thoughts controlling me, I follow, I bleed
