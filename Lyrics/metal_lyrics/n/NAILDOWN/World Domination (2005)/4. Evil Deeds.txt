You should beware
Evil deeds you pursue
When you fall asleep
I'll creep next to you

Silence falling
Better you, never me
When you fall asleep
I'm still awake

Silence falling over you
You'll get what you deserve
Payback period!

You should beware
Evil deeds you pursue
When you fall asleep
You wish you never did
