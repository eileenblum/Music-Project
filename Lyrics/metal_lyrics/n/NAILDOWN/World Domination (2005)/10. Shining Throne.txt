Like a swiftly blowing wind
I'm after you to take another win
Don't run away from me
It's a dead-end you'll never pass
Never!

I only take what is mine
Let your spirit follow my sign
Don't resist
I'm only guiding your way to mine

I won't disappear
Where ever you hide I'll stay near
I'm not the enemy
Your soul goes with me
I came for you

Come with me, don't resist
You will see a much better form
Your time has come, so follow me
To my shining throne

As soon as it comes to you
Countdown to another world
One way or another you will
Follow me to my throne

Come with me, don't resist
You will see a much better form
Your time has come, so follow me
To my shining throne
To your shining throne
