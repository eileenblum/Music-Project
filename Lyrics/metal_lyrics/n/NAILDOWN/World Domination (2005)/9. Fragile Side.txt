Words don't mean nothing to me
Just a diablerie to lie to get inside my head
Pain is all I get from these motherfuckers
Who won't stop trying to show

Things I have heard before
Things that shouldn't matter to anyone

Your kind, so blind
Reflecting your fragile side
Your kind, you're never right
Living in a lie since the day one

I was raised in pain, never heard from joy
Unaware of it's meaning
I shall pass away
Those who try to bring it will follow me
