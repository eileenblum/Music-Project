When your dreams are crushed and you're all alone and you've reached that boiling point, where will you go?
Who will you turn to for answers, for help?

You're left alone.
You're fucking lost.

When will you learn that you're living in a world that's turning fucking cold?

Your frienda are non-existent.
Everyone is gone.
When will you learn that you're living in a fucking world that doesn't care about you?
You're left to fend for yourself.

No more tears, no more pain.
Drown yourself on the shit you see every day.
