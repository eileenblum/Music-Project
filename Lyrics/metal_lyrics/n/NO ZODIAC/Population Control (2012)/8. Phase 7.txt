Every man woman and child on earth
Has been doomed since birth.
We feed on filth and worship scum
This society is built on lies and despair

I want to choke at the throat
Of humanity and watch the light fade from its eyes
There's no need to repent
The sins that you carry outweigh your lament
Humanity condemn to rot
Punished to suffer for the pain that you cause
Death grip on the knife in my hands
As i stab at the beating heart of the world

We're an infection
A plague of the worst kind
Dwelling in fear
Secured in our own misery
Vanity and greed dictate the way we live
I wont be part of this fucking filth

Doomed since birth
There's no escape our fucking faith
Every step that we take
Is a step towards hell.

Death grip on the knife in my hands
As i stab at your heart
Death grip on the knife in my hands
As i stab at the heart of the world
