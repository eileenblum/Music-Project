Drowning on the filth this world brings.
I kick and scream.
DEAR GOD COME BACK FOR ME.
Drowning on the filth this world brings.
I kick and scream.
DEAR GOD COME BACK FOR ME.

I walk alone with no remorse, no trust.
I walk alone, I trust no man, I have no need for hope.

I've been pushed to the ground, I can't take anymore.
DEAR GOD RECLAIM MY SOUL.
I've been pushed to the ground, I can't take anymore.
DEAR GOD RECLAIM MY SOUL.

COME BACK FOR ME.
