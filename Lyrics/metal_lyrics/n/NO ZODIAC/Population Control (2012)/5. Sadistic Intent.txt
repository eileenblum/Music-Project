I've lost my connection with all of mankind,
no longer do I find pleasure in the things I once loved.
MY PAIN IN CONSTANT.
THIS TORMENT IS NEVER ENDING.
I want to to rip the fake smile from everyone's faces.
Crush your pathethic hopes and dreams.

Show them real anguish.
Show them real fear.

I can't take this shit anymore.
I'm repulsed by the scum that roam this world.
This life means shit to me.
I'm filled with hatred for humanity.

This life means shit time.
Death is the only thing I seek.
Where is my saviour now?
Where have my prayers gone?

Broken, beaten, crushed and defeated.
Give up all hope as you hang from the rope.
Broken, beaten, crushed and defeated.
Denounce your heavenly hope.

I hope that my last words condemn this fucking earth.
There's nothing worth fighting for, there's only souls that need to burn.

BURN.
