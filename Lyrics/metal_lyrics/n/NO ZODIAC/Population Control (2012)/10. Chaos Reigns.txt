Desperately waiting for the fucking end
My mind is infected and slowly withering
Trying to forget these tormenting memories
Craving a swift end to this misery

Remorse fills my lungs these are my final words

No god can save me
No man can help me

There is no prayer that can save my soul
Iâve waited for clear skies for way too long
Forced to believe that thereâs no God above
And if Iâm mistaken heâs ignoring my words

No god can save me
No man can help me

Iâm punish is to endure bitterness and shame
Struggling to suppress demons I canât tame
Dragging me slowly as they claw at my back
Iâm broken and lost, these are my final words.

No god can save me
No man can help me
