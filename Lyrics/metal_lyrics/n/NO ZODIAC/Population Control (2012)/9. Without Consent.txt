[feat. Tito Of Surge Of Fury]We've been bought and sold into this modern day slavery.
Oppressed, beaten and raped by those who swore to serve and protect.

Who can we trust when we are treated like shit?
Beaten and bruised and left for dead.
While everyone else just walks by,
with blind eyes and fear filled minds.

LET THE WICKED BURN AND THE TYRANTS HANG.
SKIN THE FLESH FROM THEIR BODIES.

CRUSH THEIR BONES TO DUST.

We've been bought and sold into this modern day slavery.
Oppressed, beaten and raped by those who swore to serve and protect.

Men with no voice breed cowards and slaves.
Content with what they are fed.
Treated like animals, expected to serve.
Defending primitive and unholy ways.

[Tito]
Thick darkness, real toughness.
Accept without a word.
The human weakness, fuck the process.
This will never change.

Call into question.
Refuse decision.
Fall into depression.
Raise his own prison.

Regression of the mind.
Follow blind,
you can run but you can't hide.
Mirror mirror,
there is nothing to see anymore.
