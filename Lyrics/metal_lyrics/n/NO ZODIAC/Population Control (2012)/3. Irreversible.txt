[feat. Peachy Of Six Foot Ditch]Chosen to be the lamb of salvation,
nothing more than a victim of pleasure.
All the pain and misery in this world is now yours to embrace and endure.
Long is the search for life after death
and now your suffering should bring its end.
The essence of life has been raped from your body.
Let the agony flow as your soul turns cold.

Martyr in its purest form, (MARTYR IN ITS PUREST FORM)
Suffering is all that you'll know. (SUFFERING IS ALL THAT YOU'LL KNOW)
Torture for the benefit of man, (TORTURE FOR THE BENEFIT OF MAN)
This is the beginning of life. (THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF LIFE)

Feel your soul as it rejects your body,
the pleasures of life no longer matter.
All that once held meaning will burn to ash,
your final day has brought death to life.

[Peachy]
I'LL TAKE YOU TO WHERE YOU'VE NEVER BEEN BEFORE.
I'LL MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE A FUCKING WHORE.
YOU'RE GOING TO WAIT TILL I'M THROUGH WITH YOU.
THEN IT'S OVER AND YOUR LIFE IS TOO.

Donde quedron tus plegarias, donde esta tu fe, ya muerto i enterrado tu espÃ­ritu en el infierno se esta quemando.
