[feat. Curtis Lepore]Lord my savior, I won't follow your words.
Till my last breath, till I rot in a hole.
Won't offer you my pain to amend my sins,
my life was devoted only to sin.

I denounce all desires of the flesh.
Aroused only by the need to inflict pain.
There's a war inside of me for my spirituality.
I'm destined to give in.

Any hope for heaven is gone,
devoted to no spiritual hoax.
Tarnished by the filth of the world.
A crippled body and soul.

My search for heaven is done,
the pain has taken its toll.
My sacrifice was in vain.
Heaven and Hell, it's all the same.

[Curtis]
I WON'T KNEEL BEFORE MEN IN DISGUISES.
I DON'T BELIEVE IN HOPE, I DESPISE IT.
THIS FUCKED UP WORLD IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS.
WITH ONE EYE OPEN, I'LL SLEEP WHEN I'M DEAD.

This unholy hatred burning within.
True freedom only comes from death.
I damn the day when I was born with my final breath.

With my final breath.
