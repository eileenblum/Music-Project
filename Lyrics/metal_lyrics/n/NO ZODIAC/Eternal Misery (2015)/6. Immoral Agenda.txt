Your life fades away
As your neck breaks
Writhing constant pain
This artwork I create
Dead or alive
You're coming with me

Deprive you of your life
I decide what's right
Becoming a statistic
You will fucking die tonight

Smeared across the pavement
Removed your blood and brain
Stomp the head; bereavement
Made sure you died in pain

Like sheep to the slaughter
If one thing is certain
it's that your life doesn't matter
The closer you are to me
The closer you are
To death

Deprive you of your life
I decide what's right
Becoming a statistic
You will fucking die tonight

Masticating, masturbated
Genitalia, all life fading
Massive blood loss
Feeds my blood lust
Ingesting your fluids
You wish to be dead
slowly dying
Blunt force trauma

Restrain, repress, release, death
Restrain, decay, death, erase
