You're blindly pessimistic
And it makes me fucking sick
There is no hope in life
Won't be saved by your crucifix
Existence is pain
And pain is punishment
No salvation no light
Humanity equals shit

Immense pain, inflicted slowly
all else fails, except for death
admit defeat, rise of unholy
embrace the end, your last breath

The skies are black
With gods hate
This is payback
Our final fate

Seven plagues
Seven reasons to burn the heavens
