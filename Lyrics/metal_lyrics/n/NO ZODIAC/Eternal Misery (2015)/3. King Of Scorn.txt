Jesus Christ, King of scorn
A thousand lies, for every thorn
Endless pain from the day you're born
When god is dead, none will mourn

King-of-scorn

Drown me in the-blood of Christ
So I can see-through God's eyes

Jesus Christ, King of scorn
A thousand lies, for every thorn
Endless pain from the day you're born
When god is dead, none will mourn

King-of-scorn

Rip the flesh-from my bone
Eternal misery-is all I know

Face to face with your fate
Choke and fucking rot
God cannot save you
Cant even save the son he begot
