Every human being is out for themselves
We've turned this world into a living hell
And it may not be burning, but were all dying inside
Because within us all is where the devil resides

If god creates it
Man will destroy it
Accept your pain
Die in vain

Erase the human race
Break free from this disease

Every human being is out for themselves
We've turned this world into a living hell
And it may not be burning, but were all dying inside
Decay is the only constant; we all deserve to die

Burn your heavens
Rip Christ's flesh
Christian wasteland
I am death
