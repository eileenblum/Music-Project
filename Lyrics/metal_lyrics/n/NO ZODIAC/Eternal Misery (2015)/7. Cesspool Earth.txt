Through our procreating
We are degenerating
Into an evolutionary cesspool

Filth breeding filth
In a search for wealth
We've abused our basic right to reproduce

My indifference
to your suffering
Is Incomparable
To the filth that you breed

I am the crutch on which
you depend
You exist only when I reach out my hand

You've beaten natural selection
You won't beat me

Life is a vise
I can help you break free
Just take my hand
And you will see
I am the end
I am a plague
I am judgement
I am your dying day

No one, can save you
No one, can stop me
