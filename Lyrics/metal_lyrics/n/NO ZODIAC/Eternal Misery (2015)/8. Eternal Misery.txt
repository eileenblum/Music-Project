As the death toll rises, they cower and hide
As the earth is burning, they cover their eyes
I don't believe I will ever be saved
Sentenced to rot in this life, this plague

Plague of life

Empty eyes
Empty inside
Only god is the blame
For all of my pain
My pain

The putrid stench of my rotting soul
Is the only thing I call my own
I must escape, leave this constant pain
Or be trapped forever in eternal misery

As the death toll rises, they cover their eyes
As the earth is burning, they cower and hide
I don't believe I will ever be saved
Sentenced to rot in this life, this plague

Only god, is to blame
For all of my, endless pain

Drive the nail through his palm
Singing praise of unholy psalm
Every Christian on earth dies
Burn the churches as god cries
