[feat. Ronnie of Warhound]What do you know about struggle?
What do you know about pain?
Have you ever felt hunger?
Or stared death in the face

Sorry excuse for a man
How can you live with yourself?
How can you live knowing
Everything you preach is bullshit

I don't need your advice
Your fucking hope or faith
I was forced to live a life
Filled with anguish, greed &amp; pain

How dare you judge my life
&amp; the way I live?
Can you take care of yourself?
Can you fend for yourself?

[Ronnie]
You fake ass motherfuckers wanna tell me how to live my life in a world
Where I'm born to lose
Fuck the world

Enemy of this world
Until my the day I die
I wanna watch you burn
I wanna see you cry
Burning bridges to erase your existence
There's no stopping this
End your life
