This burn under the sign of pointed view so far
Massacred evil alive in themselves
On subdivided forces of this incarnation
All Satanic wimple kingdom
Rejoiced with the arrival of the envoy
Forth fight coming to the Earth
Through the yowl timeless of the North

In through this shadowy night 
Was warmed a diabolical potential
That would become a funeral reality
Because the sleep would await soon
By the age and the sorcery of the ancient ones
His deep eyes turn into Black
The Heel kneeled, the time has come
For the chosen one arise

Like a thick pace his music sweeps
from end to end, the other hand of the shot
Attracting the goddess to his side
Mortifying even more the dominion of dear smarts in fire
Now the fame of the prince of death sounding like
a blaming fierce aged on gray rotten sky
The bringer of severity marked 
All the jokers, opportunist, and the false
just fell in the name of Satan

But in the fight a promise broken in a
Conspiracy - the lady a snare to shed his blood
The insane who raped his wife 
Didn't think he was overthrowing
the pillar that supported himself
Now we see the morbid insane
Turned up and crashed to your bones
and to the blood of your veins
Hold on that to us and run,
your people, your sword, your circle
Your misguided horrend

I can feel your spirit
Your eyes in black
