The mortal eyes of men will open with fright
The blindness of impunity turns the vision of the truth

The one that has horns on forehead
Command the devestation
The Master with your hosts
Only Evil can prevail

The glorious Black Horsemen ride fast over dark clouds
The infernal lightning strikes
The multitude that don't believe in their eyes

The one that has the horns on forehead
Command the devestation
The Master with your hosts
Only Evil can prevail

The hurricane of fire cross the holy lands
The false kings see their thrones burning
The millenarian hereditability is broken by a new law
Fidelity and mysticism is passed by father to son

Those who try flee, fools they should to join
Will be enclosed by final circle
Will be suffocated by their own precepts
Will suffer the inversion until happens
the union of the triangles

The swords cut off
The heads of mediocre
The sky is bloody
In earth: Death, Fire and Terror

Invincible in Battle
the Servants of the Horned Master
The world to be resigned
Before the Supreme Renovation
