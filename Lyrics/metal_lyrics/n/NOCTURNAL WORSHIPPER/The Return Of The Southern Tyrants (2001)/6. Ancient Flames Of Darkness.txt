I see the blaze crossing the horizon
that inverts in fire burning
Remembering me the agony of the guilty
Slaves of desire and of the lie

When the ray pass the sky tears the eternal blackness
The thunder roar but their spirits are detained silent
Shine as much for bless as slander
The Ancient Flames of Darkness burn the heart of the spirits

In the eyes see their inner secrets
In this life wich days have no decay
Visions revealed in a secret place
And their faces recovered in intimate gloom

All the living must cross the triangle
To join their shadowy being disunited 
The deep sleep from initial crown
Allows the cursed possibility

When the ray pass the sky tears the eternal blackness
The thunder roar but their spirits are detained silent
Shine as much for bless as slander
The ancient flames of darkness burn the heart of the spirits

Alone in the Dark the seek for the lost silent shadow
Feel the expulsion of the putrid recent inclination
Inverted by withdrawal of the walls of illusion
Without the veil, united upon the inner fountain of blood

A penetrate and corrosive cold follows it burial
Sounding the fatidic rumor of winds carressing the wood
The twilight dies and the sinister coffin goes on the march
That leads the centuries to the famishing grave that awaits ...
