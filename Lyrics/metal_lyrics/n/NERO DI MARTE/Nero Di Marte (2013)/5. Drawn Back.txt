Where does the sea start and where does it end?
Every wave breaks, draws back, creates a new line

Pick up a stone and cast it
How far is it from the shore?
Between today and tomorrow
there will always be a difference

The ocean brought back shreds of what I had cast
Dirty with sand and salt, encrusted and refined

Gather - rediscover
Ask myself the reason why
I threw
Objects so crucial
The same saltiness
