Welcome to my architecture
Held by fear

Watch and you'll see
Flashing red lights
Hiding truth
With a thousand blind eyes

Watch and you'll see
My ultimate portrait

Of a collapsing reality
I'm the moral hidden
in the depths of your mind

Moulded and conformed
Collected and ordered
God's eyes have been
Replaced by me

A drowning hopelessness
A shared judgment
I'm the moral hidden
in the depths of your mind

I'll oversee you
God's eyes have been
Replaced by me

Locked forever
in a prison you plead me to build

Watch
You can't see
Blind is your belief
