This is the end
Plans unfold
And everything converges
All converges

Deformed and remoulded
A veiled conviction for all to see
Give it a name, leave it behind
Break them and then bring them back to life

You can't stop
When all converges

Close your eyes, take a step forward
Sink in the abyss with us

In the art of falling forever
