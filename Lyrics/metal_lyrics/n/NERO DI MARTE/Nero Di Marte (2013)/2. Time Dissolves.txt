As ground dissolves from underneath
The statue shatters lifted from the burden
While spiraling further down

Replaced
Feel it weighing down
It comes to pass
So it waits
It rests, unprepared
Hidden to the numb, from itself
Until time dissolves

Under a different light
Torn by the sun
Time wears us down
Showing who we are
