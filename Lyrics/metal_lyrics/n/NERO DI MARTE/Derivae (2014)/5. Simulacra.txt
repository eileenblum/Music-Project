Undo what was done
The beasts emerge beneath the stone
From deeper than what we recall 
So unfamiliar
We are deluded insignificance,
With empty thoughts and empty faces
We are fixated on our invention
And erect imperial walls of deisgn
I wonder these rules, meanings, races
Just structures for all places
Sheltered from these hailing stones
We are rulers of a world that is not our own
I am the animal
I am reborn
Come now, undo what was done
you've failed to learn
My child, you've failed to learn
