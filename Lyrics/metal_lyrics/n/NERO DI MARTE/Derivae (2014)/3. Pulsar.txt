Smoke dissipates and I become self deceiving
Smoke dissipates I am hollowed and there's nothing left but me
You asked to cut the strings that blinded us here 
You asked me to leave the weight that kept us here
Infant hiding in the sun
You are just waiting to be born
Let us go
Lost
Is this what you saw
Starless
How you thougt it would be
This isn't what you wanted
What you believed
Thought it would be
You couldn't see
Nothing is here
Now you're free to go adrift
