I run alone
In a forest of glass and remembrance
Thoughts I've never known
Swayed by the mist
Shards pierce my feet
The pain is awakening
This place isn't safe
There's no air to breathe
Search all that has gone
Find meaning for never remembering
Clouded by fear, clouded by nothingness
Distant sounds allure me, a hymn to follow
I find you there at its origin
I transcend all imprisonment
From nothing I have come
To it I shall return
All the emptiness is something I create
The mist is paralizing me
Things it lead me to believe
Breach through my skin
Dissolve into the air
And disappear
But the mist will never leave
