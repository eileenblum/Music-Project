Through the stillbirth swoon, the children are silent
Existing in dreams, surreal oblivion...
Through time, torn tombs, the children are screaming
Dreaming of life, the nightmares to come...

Through tear stained eyes, the children are drowning
Within the depths, they seek the courage...
Through white wombs, the children are laughing
Dreaming of wings, for what times may come...

Reflections behold such dreams of man
They beseech the sun for the new day
Opening their eyes to beauty's lament
The seas of luminescence...
Between their fingers awaken dead realms
...But o glorious fate leaves them blind
What eyes would close to abhor the womb?
Stumbling onwards only to be left behind...

The catharsis seized, a breathe of life
Eruptions of passion and focus
Blackening idle beliefs
Now all eyes are upon the tongue of eloquence

Reflections behold such dreams of man
They beseech the sun for the new day
Opening their eyes to beauty's lament
The seas of luminescence...
Between their fingers awaken dead realms
...But o glorious fate leaves them blind
What eyes would close to abhor the womb?
Upon the tongue...
