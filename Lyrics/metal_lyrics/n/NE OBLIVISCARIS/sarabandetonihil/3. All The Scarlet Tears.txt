All life dies as icons rage, white are the pages beyond
Unwritten are the screams, of hate... Of pain... Of misery

Of devildom falls, life is severed

With whispers the curse, to such seduction
Weeping to the sound of a grand black piano

Blood in the lungs
As watery valleys
Over angel tongues

One by one they're falling, every note spatters
Veiling the ivory teeth, the mourning anthem gathers

Blood in the lungs
As watery valleys
Over angel tongues
To a drowning finale
Memories within

Requiem for all, the scarlet tears

Blood in the lungs
As watery valleys
Over angel tongues
To a drowning finale
Memories within
The smell of rain

Within the heavens of all black hell
Stirs the passion all gone
Screaming of life and time taken
Open and taste the blooded land...

A pale horse rides as the winds cadence
Galloping keys encore, this is transcendence
A tear streaked face of stain and rust
To challenge the scarlet omnibus...

...The memories are all that remain
In heartarche with the smell of rain...
