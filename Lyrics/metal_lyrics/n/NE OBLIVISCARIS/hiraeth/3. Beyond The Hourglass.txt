Against the glass, feeling this pain
Watching the lights fall as the rain...
Translucent beauty, a tortured mannequin
Bearing all the hearts of frozen constellations...

The stars now fall to gather once more
A searing white sea of timeless awe...
Forever, beyond, nothing ever lasts
By blood not choice, searching vast horizons...
For burning souls everything comes to pass
The darkness universal within the hourglass...

Veni ad astra, semper dissolubilis
I dream of immortal night in astral eyes
Where light would die for the last time

Now is the hour, this is the one, father time
Now is the hour, this is the one, through thine eyes
Now is the hour, out of the black hole of life... Of life

The inner claws, heart beating hammers
Passion burns madness as nothing else matters...
Smashing the glass to destiny
Reflecting the rifts of these shared seas...
Dimensions arise, only dreams surpass
For every moment beyond the hourglass...

Now is the hour, this is the one, father time
Now is the hour, this is the one, through thine eyes
Now is the hour, out of the black hole of life... Of life
