All veiled by sunlight
A murder for evenfall
Where a new dawn resides
Veiled by sunlight
All veiled by sunlight
Of gilded silhouettes
Where long shadows rise

As winds whisper, o' harbinger, lamenting twilight
All drowned within, cold stars ignite
The world closed its eyes

Of Lorelei
Dead dreams rising
Lost to a frayed dimension
And what lies beneath
The labyrinth within the sea
The black skies of twenty thousand leagues

Keelhauled and crippled
Tangled in misery
An abyss of dying dreams
Cascading delirium
Mirrored waters
Through oceans celestial
Time steals nostalgia
For only the pain is real

Of Lorelei
Dead dreams rising
Lorelei
Lost to a frayed dimension
And what lies beneath
The labyrinth within the sea
The black skies of twenty thousand leagues
Lorelei, memories in full sail, now cast away

Bathed in funereal starfall
This night, we drag the waters
The world opens its eyes
Where tides chase the dawn beyond

All veiled by sunlight
A new day to enslave our heartache
They are our shades and whispers
Sun-gilded silhouettes
Grief, a keepsake
