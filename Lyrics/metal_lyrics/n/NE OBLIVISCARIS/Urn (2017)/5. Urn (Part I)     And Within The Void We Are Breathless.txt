Nebulous skin of change reflecting
Seething dead eyes
Drowning within two black mirrors
The writhe of our stained-glass angels
Diaphanous
Pale tongues upon our spines
Behold, star-crossed, moribund
Fleeting, the fallâ¦ to our funeral

As moths' bleed from our wounds of faith
All light wanes
And upon our open palms are dreams of ash and ember

Beneath aqueducts, anointed... we transfigure
And within the void we are breathless, we are delivered

A crown of coal-black eyes, tendrils of shadow
Breathless, beloved, godless... we are home

Beneath aqueducts, anointed... we transfigure
And within the void we are breathless, we are delivered

And within the void we are breathless
