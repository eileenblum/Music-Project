PERFECTION, A WORLD APART WE ARE
BRIGHT STAR AND THE EYE
...I AM

RIDING THE TIDES. CRUX... ASTRAL GRACE
DOWN SILVER LOCKS TO COSMIC CROSSINGS
HOW FAR HAVE I COME?

AS SATURN DEVOURS, OF MIND-STREAMS' ODDITY
RIFT WROUGHT SOULS RUPTURE, RIPPLING...
ALL SHACKLES HAVE NOW FALLEN, NEBULAE HORSES PULSE ON
CAN I FEEL?

LOCKED WITHIN PANDORA'S MUSIC BOX
WATCHING FROM THE PORTAL OF I
BAYING THROUGH WOVEN SOUNDSCAPES
A BLACK DOG LAYS AT MY FEET... OBLIVION...

COLD, CELESTIAL BRILLIANCE
THE CANVAS UNFRAMED, ELATION
CIRCUS OF RADIANT MOTION, ALIVE

A HANDFUL OF EARTH... THE ONLY REMINDER
MAJESTY, TAKE MY HAND

WE WEEP TO BELIEVE, WHERE ONLY DREAMS HAVE WITNESSED BEYOND
WE WEEP TO BELIEVE, WHERE ONLY DREAMS HAVE...
