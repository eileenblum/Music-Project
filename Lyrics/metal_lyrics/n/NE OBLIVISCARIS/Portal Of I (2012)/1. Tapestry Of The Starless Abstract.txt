ALL HORIZONS FALL THROUGH DYING STAINS
A CRIMSON CROWN TO CALL MY OWN
O HOME IS EVERYWHERE I VOYAGE
AND DARKNESS IS ALWAYS WITH ME...

I CALL TO THE SIRENS ECHOING IN SWEET LAUGHTER
BROKEN HOPES 'NEATH THE SURFACE
WITH HAUNTING EYES THEY STARE...
through black waters, wearing tresses
a figurehead warped, stares homesick afar

NEVER DEPTHS... MY DEAR DESPAIR
NEVER

BLIND IN DELIRIUM, NAVIGATING THE CONTINUUM FLUX... NOTHING
SUBMERGED IN LIMBO, OF NAUTICA THEY SING... TRUE MAJESTY
OCEANS WIDE, EYES WIDE... FOREVER TO TREASURE... CARRY ON
INFUSING INSIGHT, THE FABRIC OF SPACE IGNITED

silent time reveals tragedies chartered
all triumphs were drowned...and the sirens too...
SILENT TIME REVEALS...
ALL TRIUMPHS WERE DROWNED...
symphony for the pilgrim, intrinsic wake, opulent discordant soul... my arabesque
setting sail from paradox lost to a paradise found
PARADISE, PARADISE FOUND
PARADISE, PARADISE FOUND
