oh why?
OH WHY THE BUTTERFLY OF MAN?

oh why?
oh why precious beauty?
with eyes that speak tongues
foresight and memory, maelstrom wormholes
behind, the vast passion
a wish is made upon a nebula
from the leper's kiss
CONJURING ORDERED CHAOS
KALEIDOSCOPE IN MOTION
ADORNED A PORCELAIN MASK
O'ER THE ENIGMA... PIERROT OF TE GARDEN
WHERE LIGHT PARTS WAY
THE LEPER HAS COME HOME...

I, LEPER
...WHY, WHY?
I,LEPER
...WHY?
