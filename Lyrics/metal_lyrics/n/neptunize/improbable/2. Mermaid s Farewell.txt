Under this pristine blue survived.
My home so pure and bright.
A quiet order, souls in waterâ¦

All I need's some flowing light,
When sun hides herself at night.
My day bringers, my luminaries, go...

Bring me light,
Make the city glow.
Before the sun,
Gets to the edge and fall.

Sunlight's leaving us,
All the colors fading away.
I don't really know what clouds are after,
Nor how long we endure this disaster.

In a lifeless motion,
A wretched isolation
No...

A cold gloom upon my home
Where I blindly float.
Death walks and meets the eye,
In this endless night.

One last time,
Let me hold the light.
So peace I find,
Before I wither and die.
