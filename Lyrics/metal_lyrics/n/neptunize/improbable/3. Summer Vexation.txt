Black old tires are the servants of the road.
They took you far away again and made the dust float.
Birds are trying to cheer me up in despair,
While the golden wheats swaying like your hair.

When summer ends,
Winds get you back

Seasons cannot keep up with time.
In the shade I pray for clouds to veil the sun.
