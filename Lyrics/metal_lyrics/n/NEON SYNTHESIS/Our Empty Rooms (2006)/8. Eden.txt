Synthetic Eden
Our garden of delight
All roads lead to temptation here
The day we lost our innocence
It was a new beginning
Blood never tasted so good

Follow my steps into the garden
I am the taste of the forbidden fruit
I am the vision of stars above
I am the symphony of hate and love
I am the perfume of dying flowers
I am the voice of days to come
No regret for the angel I was
I am the rot in the heart of the rose

Synthetic Eden
The mask that hides corruption
Our perfect smile was impure
Infected with decadence
Poisoned and magnificent
We came to spread the disease

Follow my steps into the garden
I am the taste of the forbidden fruit
I am the vision of stars above
I am the symphony of hate and love
I am the perfume of dying flowers
I am the voice of days to come
No regret for the angel I was
I am the rot in the heart of the rose
