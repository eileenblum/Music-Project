When blood flows and the party is over
Sounds from the past haunt my sleep
Echoes of a new existence
The rejection of life means higher needs

The same sky upon us
Pleasure melts with pain
The light has faded
We will die again
Memories hurt
Like reopened scars
The ashes of the future
From the womb of the past

That restless night bred
Memory and desire
Only disillusion's left
Everything has been done

Nothing was safe from my iconoclastic rage
The fire of truth set my world ablaze
A strange hell opened up its gates for me
The fruit of knowledge fell from the tree

Sometimes at night
I prayed to fall asleep
An escape from reality
The washing of the sins

Another sky upon us
Regret and sorrow grow
Another day has gone
Is there a space for hope?
No escape from here
From this darkened place
The tolling of a distant bell
Reminds us of our fate

That restless night bred
Memory and desire
Only disillusion's left
Everything has been done

Now I am like everybody else
I'm not myself anymore
