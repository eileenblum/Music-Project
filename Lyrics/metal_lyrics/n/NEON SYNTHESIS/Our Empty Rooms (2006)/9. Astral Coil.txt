We embrace
We unite forever

Cold and bare fields
Astral ice swept by wind
Thoughts fly among clouds and darkness
To find my lost heart
I'm the new Oedipus,
Fate plays with me
But I will follow you
Until the sun will cease to breathe

Angel or siren
Fairy with velvet eyes
Make the universe my reign

Your body sings
Tales of beauty and pleasure
Our love spreads pure light
Your essence is trapped into my eyes
Your thoughts are crystal
Intense and so fragile
Your feelings flow within me
Your pleasure flows within me

Angel or siren
Fairy with velvet eyes
Make the universe my reign

Goddess or queen
Emotion of this winter night
Listen, in silence, to my voice
