Broken dreams lost in empty rooms
Gold and dust beyond space and time
Everything has been lost
Maybe we want too much?
Roads of weakness and mistakes
Led past and present to the same end
Nothing has really changed
Don't blame us if tomorrow's black...

I have built walls made of words
And lived in my ivory tower
Now it's time to rise and burn
I will take you all with me

Show a face that isn't yours
Be a victim by your choice
Don't change things but scream in silence
Never be satisfied
Never turn back as you walk alone
Keep your dreams in shrines of glass
On the path to self destruction
Aim to things that you can't get

Don't search answers
I won't be the prophet you need

Fear of failure walks by my side
I wish I could live but I'm so scared
We cannot protect ourselves
From the mask we wear
Roads of weakness and mistakes
Led past and present to the same end
Nothing will ever change
Don't blame us if tomorrow's dead...

Laugh - hurt - commiserate
Go beyond - isolate
Lie - hide - hesitate
Go beyond - isolate
