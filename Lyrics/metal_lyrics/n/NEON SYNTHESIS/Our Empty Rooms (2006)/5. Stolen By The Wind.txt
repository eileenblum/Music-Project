Cradled by this sweet melody
We fall in silence like stars
Fascinated by an immaculate ground
While for a second we close our eyes

Stolen by the wind
These sounds are waves that carry the heart
Into a whirl of feelings
The noise of present is left outside
Insolent like an open sore

Equilibrium and symmetry
Branches that open like curtains
Show a window to the future
Through a crack does filter the light

Stolen by the wind
I'm lost between what I am and what I'll be
Victim of myself
Longing to know if tomorrow
Music will take me away from here...
Again
