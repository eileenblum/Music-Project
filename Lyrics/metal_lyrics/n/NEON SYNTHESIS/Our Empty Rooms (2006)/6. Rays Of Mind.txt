Knives are my only friends
Wind freezes their long blades
Like a thousands eyes the stars are watching me
I'm alone, and sorrow embraces rivers of wine
My dreams, my life
One second - they died
And beauty has turned grey
I can't do anything but prey

One day I saw a child
Running through the park and smile
Today I see a man
Standing in an empty street

Walls of words around my confused mind
Grow higher and higher
Have I fought for the right cause?
What have I left to people about me?
No time for answers
Nature is calling
I hope She kept a throne for me
I must believe in something

One day I saw a child
Watching the sun up high
Today I see a man
Crying for the last rays of his sky

Useless action
I've reached the end

One day I saw a child
Running through the park and smile
Today I see a man
Standing in an empty street
One day I saw a child
Watching the sun up high
Today I see a man
Crying for the last rays of his sky
