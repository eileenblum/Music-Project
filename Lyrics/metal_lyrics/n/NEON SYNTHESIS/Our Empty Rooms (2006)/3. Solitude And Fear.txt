A bitter awakening, after the nightmare
Innate anguish, instinct of death
Psyche has one thousand faces
And each of them is choked by pain

I fell into the void
Created by myself
Silent screams from my mouth
Eyes dim like the dark

My weary heart is still running
It carries on a useless fight
The night is cold and so long
I walk with you, I have no fear

I watch a pure and shining dawn
I feel life running up to me
Close my eyes, there's still a tear
To remember the last sun

I fell into the void
Created by myself
Silent screams from my mouth
Eyes dim like the dark
I watch a pure and shining dawn
I feel life running up to me
Close my eyes, there's still a tear
To remember the last sun
