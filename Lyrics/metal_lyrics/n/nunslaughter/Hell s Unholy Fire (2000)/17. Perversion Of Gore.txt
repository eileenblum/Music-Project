Excrete upon the cross of God
Severed heads adorn my palace
Entrails strewn upon the cross of God
Divine agony sacrifice

Your God has fallen into 
Perversion of Gore

Rotting zombies kill with hate 
Violent expulsion of the word of God
Distorted mass of flesh and bone
Sadism of a tortured mind 

The mass of flesh reeks
Perversion of Gore

Humans drenched in blood 
Decay flesh begins to rot
Coma souls lie in hell
Weak will die in pain 

The God of man turned
Perversion of Gore
