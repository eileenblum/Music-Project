Mangled thoughts and twisted visions 
Of blasphemies upon this earth
Rotting Christ of new religions 
Spawned from fire to destroy the earth
Procreation of new being 
Destined thoughts in our minds
Gods fall and death we are seeing
False religion left behind

Impale the Soul of Christ
on the Inverted Cross of Death 

Holy Mary burnt to death
Decaying Jesus of the weak 
Churches fall to waste and ruin
Knowledge of death is what they seek
Christian death blackened being
Satanic reign God is fleeing
Stabbing dagger blood starts
Tattered entrails pumping heart

Impale the Soul of Christ 
on the Inverted Cross of Death 

God will come and die again
There is no holy where there is sin
Vile semen contorts the birth
Spawn of fire to destroy the earth
Now the earth is dominated 
Invert the cross Christ is hated 
Unholy Mary church is burning
Blood and death violence yearning
