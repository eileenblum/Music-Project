Blood clots limbs rot
Body decays to slime
Hate grows dead know
When its feeding time
Hunger here eternal fear
The dead begin to rise
Harder crust brains to dust 
The living begin to die

Death by the Dead they rise to eat 
Death by the Dead living flesh feast

Tombs fall night calls
The dead begin to walk
Dead eat raw meat
Feasting dead are back
Chew skin drink blood
Rip apart you face
Gnaw bone gouge eyes
Destroy the living race

Tear flesh from head
Eyes with no sight 
The dead with strength
Power and the might
All bleeding and sick
The living cant be saved
The dead drag guts
They return to their grave
