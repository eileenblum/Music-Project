Lacerations contusions of the face
Asphyxiation suffocation of a race 
Transformation complete the righteous deed 
Tradition to end this prophecy

Blasphemy of religious spawn
Catastrophe at the birth of dawn
Atrophy from the severed head 
Cacophony caused by the living dead 

Blasphemy of the Flesh 

Symphony of the living dead
Prophecy of terror and dread
Legacy of your God is gore
Tragedy that exists no more 

Blasphemy of the Flesh
