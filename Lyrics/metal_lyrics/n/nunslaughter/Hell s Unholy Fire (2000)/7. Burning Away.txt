Satan your father
Has summoned you to die
The worms of rot
On wings of death you fly 
Cadaver of Christ
Is lying at your feet
On his flesh we dine 
The rancid holy meat

You're Burning Away

Holy God Burning Away
Ancient ways Burning Away 
Tortured lives Burning Away
Bellowing horror 
You're Burning Away

Tearing the Jesus
Christ from the holy womb
Building this coffin 
For your unholy tomb
Prayers from hell 
Cannot see the signs 
Forever you'll burn 
With the sinful kind

You're Burning Away
