You say love God 
I say kill the Jew
You say I'm forgiven
I say fuck you

Blood for blood is pain and misery
All for one insane epiphany 
What I feel is hate and suffering
Blood for blood is God worshipping

Standing on top of the mountain
Looking toward the river of Styx
Your denied God hangs upon his crucifix

Blood for Blood......

The fools with religion 
Will fall to their knees
Any chance I get
I'll make those fucking bastards bleed
