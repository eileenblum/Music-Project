I'm creating death I'm killing God
I'm blaspheming with your soul
Burn in hell your soul and me
Follow wisdom you will see
Terror and fear greet your eyes
Now its time for you to die
Jesus followers book of rules
Destroy the trinity and crush the fools

Burn in Hell your God
Burn in Hell with me
Burn in Hell forever stay
Burn in Hell

I'm the lord I'm the goat
I'm the one you fear the most
Give your soul come to me
I will hear your final plea
Raise the dead servants of death
All my children a final breath 
Follow me to the grave
The lord can't help you he is afraid
