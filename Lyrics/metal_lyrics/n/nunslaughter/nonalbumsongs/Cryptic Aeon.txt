[Tejano Tour March 6-7 2010 Track]The embodiment of a quixotic being 
A vortex has sent an ambitious emanation 
To define noble deeds I pursue unfeigned might 
Through an immeasurable space of aimless time 

We will exist for all ages mankind will flee 
Though mountains falter and dry are seas 
The mission is never ending for our quandan entity 
Manifest imperial strength until your extinction 

Since the dawn of time we were magnanimous 
Galaxies are born and the universe will die 
Our presence is felt throughout the Cryptic Aeon 

Canât refuse our benevolent existence 
A force greater than hurricanes 
Wicked are many whose God is in the heavens 
For we will take their faith 
And scatter their dogma
