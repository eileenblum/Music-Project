This is Cerebus a fierce typhon
That guards the gates of Hades
In the land of the dead a foul hellhound
A chimera of bitch and fiend

A monstrous three headed beast 
He is the watchdog of Hell
Hunting and trapping the souls of the damned
Un-caged is the demon below

The first head a hunter with keen eyes and ears
Can surely track you down
The second a killer a cancerous mass
Made of spite and horn
The thrid a seer a blind head with eyes
King of this barking brood

Blacked are the souls of the fool in this putrid mess
Talons of the dog dig deep in the stygian shore
Charons ship of doom overflows with the mounting dead
The Cerebus stand proud as he howls at Hell
