Jesus saw but did not say
Arcaic fear immersed inside
He asked what is your name
The name Legion I replied

And so began our battle
Over this simple childs soul
An incredulous blight
I shall not let her go

Posession is Demonic
The Vatican and Catholics mourn
A detestible nefarious relic
The ecclesiastic scum

For now I sit a scheming shrew
My fiendish claws sunk deep
I possess a chosen few
The pontiff is left to weep
