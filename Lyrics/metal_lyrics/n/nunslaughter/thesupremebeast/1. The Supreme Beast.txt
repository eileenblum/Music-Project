You are of your father the devil and the desires of your father you do
He is a murderer can not stand in the light of truth
There is no truth in you Prevaricate was your mother
It is lies you speak and deceit is your father

Omniscent and Cosmourator is your destiny
An ultimate God devoid of philanthropy
For within the slumbering mass of Humanity
Lies an envious, covetous, skeptical jealousy

Believe in the Devil long enough and a God will be seen
Go to the highest peak look back at where you have been
A realm of irrational science and philosophy
The study of real Gods the story of Demonology

Omniscent and Cosmourator is your destiny
An ultimate God devoid of philanthropy
For within the slumbering mass of Humanity
Lies an envious, covetous, skeptical jealousy

The Demiurge realize your evil objectification
To castigate the adverse pontification

Conjoined theories of Spirituality
Path of unmighteousness untold maliciously
Burning brimstone Hellfires spur contemplation
To theorize and speculate this miscreant conception
