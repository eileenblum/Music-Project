Sacrifice my soul to the grave of the dark world
The walking dead feast on the living eating the flesh
Satan laughs my children eat the useless servants bodies
Could I walk the hell one more time in my life

Let's have a human sacrifice and drink the blood
Lucifer the dark, ring the bells of hell
Witches do the death dance and show you evil ways
lust Lucifer your father so kneel to your master

Grave, grave

I got blood on my motherfucking hands
Baphomet's call, the demons roam the earth once more
These demons show you the evil ways of life
Jesus Christ in hell dying on Satan's cross
We're having a blood feast for the new arrivals 

I walk into Satan's arms
