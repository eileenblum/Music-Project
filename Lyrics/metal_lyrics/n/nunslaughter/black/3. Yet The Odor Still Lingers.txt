Blood is on my hands and it stains the floor
Sterilize the walls I have killed once more
What have I done I must be out of my mind 
Bury the corpse so that no one can find
The horror in my house and the pile of bones
Why must I kill I want to be left alone
Bury the body in the abandon lot
I must cleanse this stench and stinking rot

Yet the odor still lingers

Help me now
Cannot stand it
The smell of death
this stinking shit

Brains and guts 
Skin and fat
Piss and bones
How long will it last

Blood is on my hands and it stains the floor
Sterilize the walls I have killed once more
What have I done I must be out of my mind 
Bury the corpse so that no one can find
The horror in my house and the pile of bones
Why must I kill I want to be left alone
Bury the body in the abandon lot
I must cleanse this stench and stinking rot

Yet the odor still lingers
