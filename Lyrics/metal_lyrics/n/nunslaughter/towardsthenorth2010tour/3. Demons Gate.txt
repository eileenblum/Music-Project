Blasphemy a way of life 
For I will never serve 
Lord of weakness holy light 
Grant what we deserve 

Deliverance to evil take my soul to sell 
Blast my flesh unto my death so I may reign in hell 

Belial Leviathan Satan Lucifer 

Incestuous carnivorous the lust your God forbade 
Our father your weakness the prince of hate conveys 

Jesus Christ you've lost 
The treasures of your life 
Bleed for me O weakened one 
To your heart a knife 
Lord of darkness hear my call 
Your evil spawn awaits 
Adorn my skull in the hall 
Of hell the Demons Gate
