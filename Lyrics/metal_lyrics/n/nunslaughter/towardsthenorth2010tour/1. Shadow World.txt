Dead this world is dead
Wrong so many wrongs to
Right as I write these words
Can not kill but I can
Kill in the shadow world

I kill in the shadow world

In your slumber I creep through depressive nightmares
Wield the death axe I strike at your contemptuous head
Your are reviled by me but I now I am defiling you
I am the lunge in the dark my hands around your neck

Blind this world is blind
Faith canât help your faith and
Hope I hope to hate
Can not kill but I can
Kill in the shadow world

Life seeps to nothingness night consumes all
Through lidless eyes I watch mirror without reflection
Day devours night I slip past the trees
The edge of my hollow hole I seek the dark
