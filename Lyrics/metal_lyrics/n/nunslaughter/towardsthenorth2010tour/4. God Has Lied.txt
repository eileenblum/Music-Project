Flailing winged angels come to help 
Capture of light turning tears to stone 
Angels trumpet a violent call 
Facing mortality you renounce your cause 

Death coddles your inner child 
Old age claims your thought and breath 
Bedraggled life cast aside 
Debilitating pose for all to see 

God has lied 
Our father who art in heaven 
God has lied 
Hallowed be thy name 

Serpent is more cunning 
Eat from the forbidden tree 

God has lied 
Thy kingdom come thy will be done 
God has lied 
On earth as it is in heaven 

Through one man sin entered the world 
Thus death spread to all mankind 
You have free will and you will be free 
Never to be bound by hypocrisy
