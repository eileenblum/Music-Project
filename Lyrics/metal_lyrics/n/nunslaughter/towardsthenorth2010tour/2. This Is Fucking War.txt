Above the stars of God I'll scale the heavens 
Set up my throne and the devils seven 
I take up my seat on Mount Congregation 
Command from the north and abolish creation 
Ascend in the clouds I will be most high 
To cast God out and to see him die 
In the name of hell you are forewarned 
Achromatic Angel decrepit wings torn 

This is fucking war 

The hour has come closer the moon has split in two 
God's vengeance is upon me and I will storm the heavens above 

Your ruined kingdom has fallen too far 
Jesus his disciples ruled by bete noire 
Devil did not sin at the point of my creation 
I told my minions that there was no salvation 
Obstinate evil determined in my sin 
Beatific smile am smirk of my emancipation 
Devotees of ungodliness progenitor everlasting 
Bow to Heavens new ruler for I am now king 

The hour has now past us but but I will keep hidden for in times of strife every soul will find they need Satan
