[performed by Nunslaughter]Bodies in the ground, they lie still
Soil from the burial mound fills
Tomb 6 ft below the crust
Dirt to contain this foul lust

Mold within the coffer now grow
Horrid stench of hell it now knows
Release death demon now seeks
Chill now as the casket lid creeks 

Murder and lust
Tasting the flesh
Hatred abound
Foul Cadaver
Hunting at night
Consumed by desire
Craving blood
Wanton fervor

Crawl across the moistened graveyard
Scars upon the flesh is now marred
Nails rusted and jagged now seek
Thirst pale cadaver must drink

In the dark of the eve the crypts begin to open
Arise from the cold ground and they walk into the night
As the casket lid creeks
