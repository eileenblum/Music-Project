Stalking in the night and
Watching pale moo,light
And waiting for you to fall
Into the hands of the devil

Sinister evil the devil
wich wicked horns
To gore the just and maim the good
And take you down into the very pits of hell
The devil

Blackened is the blood
That's beating through my soul
Twisted ways and lustful sin
Loosing all control

The hounds of Hades come for you
Damnation
The devil
And there is nothing you can do
