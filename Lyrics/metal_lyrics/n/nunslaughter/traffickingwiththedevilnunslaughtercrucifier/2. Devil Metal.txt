Black is my heart
The battle is near
Fight for the sound
Its metal we hear
Dark is the night
We live the fight

Blasphemy and agony metal floods my veins
A symphony of sickness metal is the way
Devil Metal
You say you'll help me cause I 'm fucking wild
I say that I am fine I am the Devils Child
Devil Metal
