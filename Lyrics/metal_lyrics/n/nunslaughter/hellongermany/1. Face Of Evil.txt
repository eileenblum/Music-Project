For all souls that are taken 
One more thorn in the head of Christ 
This Christian liar 
Why do you follow him

With the Face of Evil 
You'll serve me well 
In the Face of Evil 
This mortal hell

God wont win I'm in control
Of your mind body and soul 

With the Face of Evil 
You'll serve me well 
In the Face of Evil
This mortal hell 

Rot in heaven serve in sin
Summon fire call the beast
Twisted fate Satanic feast
