Nuns in the church living like whores
Spreading disease with their cancerous sores
Begging and pleading for a buck 
When all they want from you is a fuck
Pay the church to lift your sins
You'll soon die in a coffin
Ripping the Flesh from the victims bones
No one can help you your all alone

You've been killed by the cross

Drink the blood of the lamb
Invert the holy cross
I kill the innocent 
To please him and me
