Moonlight
In the woods we chant 
Pentagram 
On the ground we carve 
Ancient rites
We preach tonight 
Evil ones
I conjure with spell 

Midnight Mass
Preacher beware
Midnight Mass
Demons conjure 
Midnight Mass

Eye of bat
We add to the brew
Warlock dance 
With skull and bone in hand
Witches grin 
At the magic they have done
Bleeding pig 
Left to the land

Midnight Mass
