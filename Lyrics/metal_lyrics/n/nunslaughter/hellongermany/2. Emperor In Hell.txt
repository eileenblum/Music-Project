Pity the weal for they can not see
The way it will be at their trial
For in fire and flame and a newborns fresh blood
We will write the scripts of Belial

For I am the Emperor in Hell
And I command all of your dead
I am the Emperor in Hell
Hell yea

For I am the Emperor in Hell
And I command all of your dead

To rise and devour the Christian young meat
I consume the holy with pride
The seed of deceit has grown into hate 
How do you feel knowing your God has lied
