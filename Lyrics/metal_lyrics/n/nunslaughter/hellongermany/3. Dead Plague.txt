Alone in the cemetery
Clouds in the sky
Darkness covers the grave
The moon is drawing high
Fog rolls in thick
The dead begin to rise
There is nothing but sin 
The living will all die

The Dead Plague is death all around
Legions of hell rise from the ground

Trapped beyond hells gates
Surrounded by the dead
Legions of the damned 
Their hunger must be fed
Refuge in the church
Crosses are burned
Once your in the mouth of death
There is no return
