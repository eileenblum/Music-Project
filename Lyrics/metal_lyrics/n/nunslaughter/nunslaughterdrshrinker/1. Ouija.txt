[performed by Nunslaughter]We call upon the spirit world
To summon up the dead
Candles burn and mystic chants
Are dancing through my head
Questions ask the truth be told
But some of them have lied
About the way they left this world
The others that have died
Ouija
We call upon the dead
Ouija
Now we're in the netherworld
Begin with yes and no
Ask about the afterlife
The time spent down below
How is it you came to us 
You float above the floor
Time has come for you to leave
And close this astral door
Ouija
We call upon the dead
Ouija
Why is it you play with this 
To quench your morbid thirst
Opening the passage ways
Can only get you cursed
Learn this lesson once my friend 
I'm sure your quick to tell
A tale of misplaced souls 
And the trip you took to hell
Ouija
We call upon the dead
Ouija
