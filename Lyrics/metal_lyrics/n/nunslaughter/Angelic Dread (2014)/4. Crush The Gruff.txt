Christians they speak in tongues
A holy man is in disguise
Beware of the many faces
Their words their words are the lies

Christians mourn for Christ
Chicanery why don't you see
There is no fucking messiah 
No peace for your misdeeds 
Just try to sit through sermons
The tales of God in the sky
How can you believe this shit
your faith is a lie

Crush the Guff

Christians they speak in tongues
A holy man is in disguise
Beware of the many faces
Their words their words are the lies

A steeple full of deceit
A congregation unfit
Join the mindless sheep
And listen to their shit
Spew forth duplicity
A ploy a ruse and fraud 
Stand on your own pride
And don't worship this God
