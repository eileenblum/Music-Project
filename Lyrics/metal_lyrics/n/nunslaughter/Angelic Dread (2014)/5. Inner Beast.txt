Deep in the night the fires of hell
Spread across the land and evil swells
Hate in my heart fuels the blood in my veins
All has turned black and nothing remains

Evil take heed and avoid my inner beast

Haunting the hills and creep in the night
Summon all fear you scream in fright
Pain is intense no time to take breath
I attack your soul and cause your death

Evil take heed and avoid my inner beast

It is my will that you now die
Power from Hades fills me inside
I know the limits and I know my deed
The zealots mind feeds this inner beast

Deep in the night the fires of hell
Spread across the land and evil swells
Hate in my heart fuels the blood in my veins
All has turned black and nothing remains

Haunting the hills and creep in the night
Summon all fear you scream in fright
Pain is intense no time to take breath
I attack your soul and cause your death
