I looked into the abyss
And I stood in awe
Solitude and devastation
And I liked what I saw

He who fights with monsters
Should look to he himself
He does not matter
A battle in itself

You gaze into the abyss
Take heed you are the few
For when you start to do this
The abyss gazes at you

I speak of horrid lore
And of tribulation
Mankind's need to know
What lies in desolation

I looked into the abyss
And I stood in awe
Solitude and devastation
And I liked what I saw

Cliffs of hellish brimstone
Cast fires of unknown
Shadows dancing softly
From the souls of the alone

Satan the lord of hell
You have all sinned
A master of desire
Now come and bow to him

The truth is fucking down there
Can't read it in a book
Won't learn it from the bible
You just have to look

Into the abyss
