God, there is no God!
You must realize I feel contempt
For those who force me to believe In a lord above, He cannot be
Christ was no messiah, He was just man
You follow in a dream An ill-conceived plan
But I know this, I have Learned from all my strife
Do what thou wilt Is my way of life
Christ, he did not rise
From the inner crypt

All you Christian scum
Make me fucking sick
He who fears the dark Shall never see the light!
