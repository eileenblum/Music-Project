Soul is torn away from my sinful lifeless body
Evil swells inside essentia and I level my hate

You will fear
My Twisted Spirit

I once was a peaceful man and spent time in solitude
But my wretched death is wrought with rage and anger

Terror and despair
My Twisted Spirit

Uneasiness and dread fill the gloom in your heart
Suspicion and scare in the night after dark
A coffin with corpse but only skin and bone in it
Beware your time has come and fear my Twisted Spirit

Wicked man cast down to wallow with the dogs
Stagger within life and death to bring my vengeance

Worry and fright
My Twisted Spirit
