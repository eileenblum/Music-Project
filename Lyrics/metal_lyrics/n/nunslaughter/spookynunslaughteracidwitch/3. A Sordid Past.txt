[performed by Nunslaughter]Winds shall blow
Trees will bend
The Moon rises
Life does end

When it's over
My grave can scream
Revel in my tales
Living out the dream

All of the misgivings
My image does last
Of a life not squandered
But a sordid past

There's no pain
My only friend
Do not mourn
I want it to end

When it's over
My grave can scream
Revel in my tales
Living out the dream

All of my misgivings
My image does last
Of a life not squandered
But a sordid past
