[performed by Nunslaughter]And so...
The creatures of my fright
Stir quietly by moonlight
Shapeless in my mirror
Into the dark I peer

Forked tongue and Hell's hot breath
Scratching of blood stained claws
The gnashing of hungry teeth
Thundering of heavy hooves

Scurry into the dark
Red eyes and green skin scales
These things don't creep me out
Just the wagging of their spooky tails

This can't be happening to me
Tell myself it's only a dream
Stay awake by the safe light
That's why they only come at night

Forked tongue and Hell's hot breath
Scratching of blood stained claws
The gnashing of hungry teeth
Thundering of heavy hooves

Scurry into the dark
Red eyes and green skin scales
These things don't creep me out
Just the wagging of their spooky tails
