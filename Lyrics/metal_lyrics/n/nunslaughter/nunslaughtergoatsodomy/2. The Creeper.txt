The dark, the stenchThis is where you can find meI am evil i am a villainA wind gust through the trees The CreeperC-R-E-E-P-E-RThe CreeperC-R-E-E-P-E-R Depraved AtrouciousStill it is you on the groundI hide hands i hide headsSo that no piece can be found The Creeper My crime, a passionTo eliminate all that i canCannibal MurderThis is what i am You hate me, i love itYour blood i do now spillSuffocate MutilateAs i go in for the kill
