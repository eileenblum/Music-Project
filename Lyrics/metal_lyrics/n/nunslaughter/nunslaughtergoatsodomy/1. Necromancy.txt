The night is settled softly air is thick with brumeBook of spells and potions agitation loomsAmulet clutched tightly magic symbols woodAromatic resins as i draw my hood Astrology right purpose is quite clearPlanets align as the time pulls nearCharms to be recited to conjure spirit dreadProfound divination while calling on the dead Necromantic tendencies urging the dead to walkArchaic form of magic getting them to talkLife utter tragedies sad tapestry unfurledUncontainable knowledge from the underworld Circle made of skin my body the hostBinding all the spirits malevolent ghostNauseous feeling inside making me sickUndead creature fading i expel the lich This is Necromancy archaic to say the leastPraying to the dead subjugate deceased Necromantic tendencies urging the dead to walkArchaic form of magic getting them to talkLife utter tragedies sad tapestry unfurledUncontainable knowledge from the underworld Circle made of skin my body the hostBinding all the spirits malevolent ghostNauseous feeling inside making me sickUndead creature fading i expel the lich
