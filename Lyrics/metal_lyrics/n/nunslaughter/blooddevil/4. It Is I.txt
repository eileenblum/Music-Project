It is I a demon with wings
It is I for which the gospel sings
In praise of blackened sky
Killing all holy It is I

It is I with blackened blood
It is I that will start the floods 
To bury the preachers lie
By my power It is I

It is I a creep in the night
It is I that will begin the fight 
Between the God in the sky
I am the Devil It is I
