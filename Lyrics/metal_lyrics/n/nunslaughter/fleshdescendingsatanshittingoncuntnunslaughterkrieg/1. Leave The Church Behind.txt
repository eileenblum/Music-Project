Leave the Church behind

What has the Christian Church ever done for you
Turning its back on the ones who need it to
Where's the fucking faith when followers kneel and pray
Turn your back on Christ there is another way
There is another way

You will free your mind
If you choose to

Leave the Church behind
Leave the Church behind
Leave the Church behind
Leave the Church behind

I never met a Christian that I felt we could relate
In this colony the complexity of hate
Shed this mortal coil I rot inside my grave
For it is better to perish than serve as a slave
Serve as a slave

You will free your fucking mind
If you choose to

Leave the Church behind
Leave the Church behind
Leave the Church behind
Leave the Church behind
