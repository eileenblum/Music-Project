[performed by Nunslaughter]Before the age of man
Gods ruled the earth
Cronus came to power
Castration of his father
This art was prophetic
His fate was written bold
A son of such might
Will topple the Titans domain

Cronus was betrayed by many
But Atlas had his back
After centuries of obedience
He could now lead the attack
Against the prime Olympians
He faced his brethren strong
Victory was not to be
So he was vanquished to Tartarus

Cronus feared his progeny
He ate his offspring
Rhea tricked this God
By letting their son live
Zeus grew
He vowed his mutiny
Together with the sons of Gods
Usurped the throne

Cronus was betrayed by many
But Atlas had his back
After centuries of obedience
He could now lead the attack
Against the prime Olympians
He faced his brethren strong
Victory was not to be
So he was vanquished to Tartarus

Titan, Titan, Titan
Titan, Titan, Titan
Titan!
