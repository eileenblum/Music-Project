[performed by Nunslaughter]Christ he hangs upon the church wall
His very essence sickens my soul
You fucking Christians you just can't understand
The fucking hatred I have for this man

All of my love just gave way to hate
These nuns and preachers shall suffer your fate
Had I been in Rome I'd killed you myself
No reason for Heaven when I am going to Hell

Christ you sicken me

Sickened By The Sight Of Christ
Sickened By The Sight Of Christ

We will destroy you we will cut you down
I'd like to be another thorn in your crown
Up on the cross you suffered and bled
Pride fills my heart in knowing your dead

Time has come to share what I feel
We spit at you we shall not kneel
Your fucking God stays up in the sky
Why didn't he save you you were crucified

Upon the fucking cross
