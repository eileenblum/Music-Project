I am told to kill 
The ones with Christian minds 
To free their soul and crush their God 
Its Satan they will find 
Death across the land 
It forms into a sea 
A sea of blood the sins of man 
It only strengthens me 

To Defile God 

With the 7 keys 
I open hellish gate 
To curse your soul and damn you God 
And seal you wicked fate 
Now that your in hell 
You see what my eyes see 
The burning soul the evil one 
And you will follow me 

To Defile God
