[originally by Sathanas]Shred of flesh gnawed to the bone 
Unholy kingdom ruled by Death 
Hell's fire burning desecrating valley 
Satan stands watching the corpses that surround me 

Jaws of Satan! 

Intestinal fluid dripping from my mouth 
Demons rise forth to pull me down! 
Centuries of gore, bloody lakes of red 
Gargoyle of hell fucking eats the dead! 

Jaws of Satan! 

Jaws of death will arrive 
Mist of doom will consume! 
Evil blackness cursed the priest! 
Up from hell they shall dwell 
Marching dead locks the gate 
Slicing axe seals your fate 
Enochian keys burn with power 
Black magic force takes it's course 

Wings of Death are wrapped around me 
Conflict of evil reigns unholy 
Throne of torment horns of hell 
Flood the temple the witches spell!
