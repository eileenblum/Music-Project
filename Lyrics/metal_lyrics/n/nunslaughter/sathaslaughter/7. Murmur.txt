Gods zombies eat the mind 
Of the dead guts entwine 
Dogs of war upon the throne 
Drink the blood crush the bone 

Die rot in hell 

Sarcophagus is open wide 
Stench of death from inside 
The corpses of the dead 
Rise to eat life we dread 
Blind fear terror 
Inverted church a cross is burning 
Evil one your God is turning 
To a force that is twice as strong 
The lord Satan commands us all 

Can you see the fallen beast 
Massacre a blood feast 
To keep me pure I eat your heart 
Such a glory to be torn apart
