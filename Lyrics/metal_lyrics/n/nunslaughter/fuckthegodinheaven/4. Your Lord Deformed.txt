At the mouth of Hell your lord is cursed 
For Jesus Christ His holy birth
Your are told to worship a magic goat
As the masters whip tightens round his throat

Your Lord Deformed
Cutting and slashing and burning your lord is scorned

Your Lord Deformed
For having birthed Christ the Christian born

Your Lord Deformed
Cursed with hoof and crowned with spiral horns
