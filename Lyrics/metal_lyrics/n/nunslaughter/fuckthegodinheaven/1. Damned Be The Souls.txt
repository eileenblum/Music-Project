You will pray to heaven
As your body rots
Leave behind this world
With all your thoughts
Body lowered down
Soul to descend
This earthly plain
To the bitter end

Damned be the souls
That enter heaven

Leeches of stench
Create the gloom 
Worms invade the corpse
In your tomb
Whisper Hades words
Your spirit fell
Dwell amongst the darkness
In the pit of Hell

Damned be the souls
That enter heaven
