Taunt the God in Heaven above and sell your soul to me
For I will let you taste the forbidden fruit you see

Raise the dead A taste of Hell
Cut the flesh Kindred line
We are bound malignant pedigree

SATANS BLOOD

I can give you the pleasures of Hell as you walk around unfurled
Bleed for me the King of night I rule the underworld 

Wait until you drink life from my veins
Powers of hell rush through your mind
Fighting the urge you finally give into me
I control your deeds we march on the world
Vile stench cracks the heavens above
The chalice of God has been defiled

Now as my child I walk you though the Chasm of man
Confident in my transference I release your plague filled hand

Raise the dead A taste of Hell
Cut the flesh Kindred line
We are bound malignant pedigree

SATANS BLOOD
