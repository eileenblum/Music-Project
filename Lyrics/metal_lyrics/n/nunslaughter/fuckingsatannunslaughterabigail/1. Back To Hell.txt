[performed by Nunslaughter]Striking down the gates of Heaven
Raping those who oppose our lord
Go back to Hell
Slaughter the Christian born

Tearing down the holy cross
Ways of Christ are spurned
Go back to Hell
Invert the cross then burn

Seeking out the throne of Jesus Christ
Ignite the fires in Hell we take away his life

There is only one reason
For this I do not tell
If I had a soul to give
I'd give it back to Hell

Holy water turns to blood - Hells angels fill the sky
Go back to Hell - Praise Satanic majesty

Your the lambs of Christ and are lead to die
Hells minions take charge andblacken the sky

There is only one reason
For this I do not tell
If I had a soul to give
I'd give it back to Hell

Fucking back to Hell
Give it back to Hell
Go back to Hell
I am going back to Hell
