[performed by Nunslaughter]God - There is no God

You must realize I feel contempt
Those who force me to believe
In a lord above
He can not be

Christ was no messiah
He was just a man
You follow in a dream
An Ill conceived plan

But I know this I have
Learned all from strife
Do what thou wilt
Is my way of life

Christ he did not rise
From the inner crypt
All you Christian scum
Make me fucking sick

He who fears the dark
Shall never see the light

No God in Heaven that I care for
Only inner strength can give you more
