You have fallen now
From the hand of God
Come to my embrace
Triumph of the Ram

I will build this temple made from Rams horns
A tribute to our darkened lord

Come on in, we welcome you
Light the candles, for the dead
Burning evil, scent of death
Sense of power

Thirteen years I built a structure made from rams horns
Although the Christian faith tells me to be warned
I watched it grow I made it bleed I never turned my back
I saw the horn of the ram and I made it black
