You know his son he is upon the cross
You know his word is always false
A preachers lie you cant be found
Go find God and hunt him down

Bring me the Head of God

You kill Christ
I'll kill Satan
You kill your God
Together we will kill religion

Now they are gone but not forgot
No hope for man unless they rot
