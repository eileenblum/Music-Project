We gather together with murder on our minds
Nuns are the target Religion is the crime
Driven by lust and deep-seeded resent
Tonight we go and raid the convent
We have come to kill We have come to rape
No one survives No one escapes
Corralling the victims Mephisto grins
This unholy night The massacre begins
Raid the Convent
Avenging all the ghouls and witches
Raid the Convent
Condemned by these fucking bitches
Raid the Convent
The attack on Catholicism
Raid the Convent
Assailants propagate the schism
The stains of blood from those we brutalize
Adorn the goats and oxen that we ride
We leave the churchyard and start back to the woods
The master cackles as evil conquers good
The onslaught is over The ambush is done
The headless corpses Decapitated nuns
The black white and puddles of red
This flock of cunts is now fucking dead
Raid the Convent now
