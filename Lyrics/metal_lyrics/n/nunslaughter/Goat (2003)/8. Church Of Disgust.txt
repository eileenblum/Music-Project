I will be the one you want
And you will worship me
The God of hate the God of death
The God you want to be
You feel the wrath you feel the pain
You'll reap what you did sow 
I'm not the God from heaven
I'm the one from down below
In the Church of Disgust
Your worthless God kills himself Unholy blasphemy
I ride the goat I drink the blood Live for misery
I rape your mind I eat your soul Your God will bow to me
For heaven burns and ashes fall I reign eternally
In the Church of Disgust
