I grasp for the truth and clutch for the Power,
Invoking the Demons below
Beyond hells gates and up to the tower,
With knowledge the Grimoire bestows
Cast me a spell of Satanic Superior,
To quell the Christian mind
Torture the masses of God's inferior
With Lucifer's grand design
Up to the Earth, the dawn of the dead,
On flesh my servants are fed
To torture and rape the holy land
The death of God in my right hand
I grasp for the truth and clutch for the Power,
Invoking the Demons below
Beyond hells gates and up to the tower,
With knowledge the Grimoire bestows
Thou art in the kingdom of hell.....
Slit your fucking throat
Demons, Angels and witches spells
Sacrifice the fucking goat
