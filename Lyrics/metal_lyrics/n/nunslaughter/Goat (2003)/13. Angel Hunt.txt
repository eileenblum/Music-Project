Through the Heavens above in the azure sky
It is my mission to watch them die
Since days of old all I want 
Is to gather their wings on this Angelhunt
Hunt the divine with malice and hate
Because of them I know my fate
Exist in this world deprived of mirth
Raise Hell to Heaven and rid the earth
Of Angels in the Sky The Devils will rise
And kill the pious On this Angelhunt
Cherub beings preach peace with a dove
Calumet of war a sky with no love
The consecrated feathers of this angelic being 
A flame with Hells foul breathe
The humility of Gods sanctimonious creations 
Relegated to whoredom
The Perverted seraphim wrought with anguish 
A debauched and defiled saintly species
Plummets to the stygian creek 
To be devoured by ghostly visions of demonry
Ive cleansed the heavens with steel and flame
Vanquish the goodness to Hells dark domain
One on my list Three is now two
Dont fuck with me God Ill come for you
