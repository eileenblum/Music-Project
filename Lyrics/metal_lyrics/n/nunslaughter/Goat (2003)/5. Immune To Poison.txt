A drink prepared from the brains of a bear and served in the animals skull
Is said to produce the fury of the beast so the person believes it himself
To be changed to a bear this madness remains until the magic wears off
The man knows no fear for he is the one who kills without remorse
Immune to poison
Concoction is made and stirred with a bone
No conscious thought a mindless drone
I walk through the woods
Hunting you down
A gutless pig
You are defiled
With all of my might
I stab at thee
Ridding the world
Useless existence
Has come to an end
You fall lifeless
Deed is done
I await my penance
I have been granted all that I needed
To exact my revenge my end is near
I drank the poison and it gave me the strength
To cut off your head you bastard fuck
Immune to Poison
Completed act we both have died
Your wretched life I am justified
