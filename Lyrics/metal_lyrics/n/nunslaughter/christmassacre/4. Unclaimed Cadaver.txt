Body washed a shore cold clear stream
Pungent with musky odor of decay and rot
Spiritless carcass of a nomadic man
They assess what happened in the night
The head was beaten with straight claw hammer
Torso was mutilated with the sign of the pentagram
Stab wounds littered the ghastly remains
As rigor mortis set in
