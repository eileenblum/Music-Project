Oh in the town of Deathlehem, how still we see thee lie!
For in my deep and dreamless creep I see the Christ child die.
Now in the dark and dreary, I will plant my evil seed
The fears of all the years and he will never be.

For Christ he will be kill, and I gather down below
While mortals sleep, the Devil
