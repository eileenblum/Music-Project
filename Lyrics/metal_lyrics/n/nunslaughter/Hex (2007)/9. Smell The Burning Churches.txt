Let's light it up
First I urinate on the altar of your king
Pile up the hymnals, hear hell's choir sing
Candles all around, I burn the pews for me
Lumber through the aisles to the sacristy

As I masturbate on the holy religious vestment
I reflect in my mind why I was sent
To burn and scorch the pestilence of the holy land
Your sacred vessels are crushed within my hands

Light the fucking fire, burn it to the sky
Crucifix in flames, let's all fucking die
Crosses to the left, in front of me the light
Burn the fucking church, feeling Satan's might

Smell the burning churches

Smell of smoke and ash
The crackling of fire
Steeple is now aflame
Kindle my desire

Vomit in the goblet of Jesus Christ
Christians has ruined my way of life
Church once stood containing all life's trash
Now it lies before me in a pile of ash

Light the fucking fire, burn it to the sky
Crucifix in flames, let's all fucking die
Crosses to the left, in front of me the light
Burn the fucking church, feeling Satan's might
