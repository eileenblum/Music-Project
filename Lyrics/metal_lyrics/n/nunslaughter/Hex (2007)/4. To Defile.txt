I am told to killThe ones with Christian mindsTo free their god and crush their soulIt is Satan they will findDeath across the landIt forms into the seaA sea of blood the sins of manIt only strenghts me To Defile God With the seven keysI open hellish gateTo curse your soul and damn your godAnd seal your twisted fateNow that your in hellYou see what my eyes seeThe burning soul the evil oneAnd you will follow me To Defile God
