For all souls that are taken
One more thorn in the head of Christ
This christian liar
Why do you follow him

With the face of evil
You'll serve me well
In the face of evil
This mortal hell

God won't win, I'm in control
With your mind, body and soul

With the face of evil
You'll serve me well
In the face of evil
This mortal hell

Rot in heaven, serve in sin
Summon fire, call to the beast
Twisted fate, satanic feast
