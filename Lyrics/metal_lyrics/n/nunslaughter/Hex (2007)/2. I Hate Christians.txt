You think because they fall to their kneesServants will inherit just to be meekChristians believe that a God is in the skyTheir fucking ignorance is the reason why I hate ChristiansThe Nicene CreedCapricious and deleteriousDisciples of Christ I Hate ChristiansI Hate Christians It is time to rise and think for yourselfbe strong inside and don't ask for helpThe Christian cross has turned to a crutchthey preach salvation but it won't mean muchWhen the price you pay is your own dignityto bow before a religious effigyTo all of mankind why won't you listenI pray to hell cuz I hate Christians If Christ is so strong why can I blasphemeCan't follow faith but that is just meI was born from dust and thoughtfulness breadA conscious being when I am dead I am dead I Hate Christians
