I was not given the choice
To join the christian faith
Sick of Christ and all his lies
Wish that I could be
Unbaptized

Holy water anoint my sin
Allegiance to the fucking church
Even though the christians tried
I would still demand to be
Unbaptized

I don't believe
In original sin
And I don't want heaven
To let me in

Can't accept a God on faith
Nor do I ask for forgiveness
I do not care if Christ died
I just want to be
Unbaptized
