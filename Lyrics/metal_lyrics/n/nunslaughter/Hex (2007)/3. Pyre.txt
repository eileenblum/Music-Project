Death decay unholy nightSummon evil Satan's mightUpon the cross the sins of manGod can't help you Satan canFoolish humans sick and weakBodies die unholy reekSatan's hordes spreading fireSouls of heaven fuel the pyre God turns to hateLords deceiving fateChrist falls from graceFear engulfs his face Death decay unholy nightSatan won the final fightAshes bones the guts of manTorn from him by Satan's handHoly cross is torn to shreadsGod of man among the deadCrown of thorns is barbed wireWorld aflame in the eternal pyre Angels fall like fliesScreams conceal their criesChrist is a liarGod stacked on the pyre
