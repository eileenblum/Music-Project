With this knot I seal this hexYou will not sleep, you will not restKnots of anger, knots of hateDiscord brings you to your fateThis second knot it makes twoUnhallowed thoughts and sickness newSlander, schism, evil tooBringing darkness straight to you HEX My gathered bones and frenzy of hateI add potency to your hexing fateWith these bones I now do smashCursing my enemies to fall to ashCandles burn and fill the roomLighting your way to stagnant tomb HEXYou are mine now (I put a hex on you) This third knot, I do bindWeaving chaos in your mindA hex of anger, hex of hateTo bring you doom, I will not waitSpirit abyss, hear my callMost powerful one and all HEX Take thine enemy, take him smiteBreak and scorn him in the nightOh Lucifer the shining starTouch and burn him from afarYou are mine, this is your doomScreaming twisting in the roomRevenge now will have its timeKnow thy enemy you are mine
