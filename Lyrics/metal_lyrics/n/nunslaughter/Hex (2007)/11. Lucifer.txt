The bodies lie for many a daysAnd begin to turn to dustSuch wicked souls spawned from hellAn evil God they lustRed blood and misfortuneThe horned one calls my nameTo sacrifice a virgin heartFor this torment it is Christ we blame The dark one our lordHas made his place in hellTo the brethren our legionsWe summon these words of spellTo Lucifer we cast this chantWith each satanic verseTo condemn the lord in heavenWith each vile curse
