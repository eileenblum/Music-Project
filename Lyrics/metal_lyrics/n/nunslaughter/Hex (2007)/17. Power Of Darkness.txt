Power of darkness fills the land
This evil incarnate the devil's hand
Minions of hell blacken the sky
Christians of god are about to die

From the north, ice and flood
From the south, holy blood
From the east a witches curse
From the west the end of the earth

Burning bodies on the ground
Sadistic curse a horrid soound
The ones of Christ, I summon your death
Destroying your sight and shredding your flesh

From the north, ice and flood
From the south, holy blood
From the east a witches curse
From the west the end of the earth
