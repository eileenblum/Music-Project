A loathsome crypt defiler
Lurk among the tombstones
Delightfully plundering graves
Feed on corpse and bones

Realize I am ogrish
This is what I do
When you fucking die
I'll do it to you to

Perversely cruel and infernal
Satanical wicked thoughts
Looting the loam filled burial
Devour the repulsive rot

Understand the fiend
Grown from a child
Taste the dying skin
Drives me fucking wild

Melt into the night
Headstone ripped
Hunger pangs
I enter your crypt
