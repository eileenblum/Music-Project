It was once destroyed
But the time has come
To drain the Dead Sea
And rebuild Sodom

Rebuilding Sodom

Let's clear away the sulfur
Brought by heavens might
To defy the christian lord
I bring back the Sodomites

Let's rebuild Sodom

By brick and stone
Wall and well
Return this city
From the heart of hell

But there is another
Gomorrah is your twin
Together with these cities
We return this world to sin

Help Nunslaughter rebuild Sodom

Immorality and vice
A gift unto this land
Fornicate and revel
That is what I am
