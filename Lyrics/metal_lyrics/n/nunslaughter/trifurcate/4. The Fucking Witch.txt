She beckons you with crooked hand
Casting spells across the land
With tail of newt and wing of bat
Cauldron boils with the bones of rats

Bewitched
Transfixed
Witchery
Deviltry

Wicked sick satanic bitch
666 you fucking witch

Prepare the lamb for the sabbat feast
Give to nature and the beast
Cut the throat blood so warm
Take a sip for the drinking horn

Bewitched 
Transfixed
Witchery
Deviltry

And the moon is high
And the witch beckons us all
And the children of the night
Follow her into the woods
