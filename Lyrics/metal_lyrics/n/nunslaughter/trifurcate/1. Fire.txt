Fire and flame 
Touches the sky
Human race begins to die
Fire
I bring you fire
Burning the sky angels fall
Earth is scorched
Flames are high demon call
This satanic force

My tired soul A wretched race
To burn and cleanse Without a trace

I bring you fire

Fire and death 
Continues to scorn
Sinful dead 
Will not mourn
Fire
I bring you fire
Choking fog Devils smoke
Blood red eyes
Fear to die gasp to live
Tourniquet tight
Now you live hell on earth
This global war
Sinful Sodom world greed
Reduce to gore
