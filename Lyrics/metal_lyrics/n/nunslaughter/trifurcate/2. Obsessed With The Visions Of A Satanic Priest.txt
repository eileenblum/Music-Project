The lord and Christ and all the Gods
Come to me in my thoughts
I must admit I fear to see 
What evil lurks from this once holy priest

Obsessed with the Visions of a Satanic Priest

With this image I will convey
A book of spells and a preacher strays
Sexual lust conjugal rites
Black woolen cloak Catholic fright
He has the power Pentagram
Black cat and owls Priesthood damned
Diabolic force Red devil might
Spiral horns through the body of Christ

Obsessed with the Visions of a Satanic Priest

Chaos book Priest conjure thee
Marduk answers Kutulu screams
Be not the last in this land of woe
Recite thine words for Hell below
Tend your flock they must not stray
Fire demons raised in the darkest day
I'm obsessed can't you see
With the vision of a satanic priest
Join the church of Hell Let demons ring
