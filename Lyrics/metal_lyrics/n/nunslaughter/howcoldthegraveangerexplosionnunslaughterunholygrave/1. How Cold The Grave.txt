[performed by Nunslaughter]The crypt is ready
Last rites are read
But in the coffin
I am not dead

You'll never know the horror
Of being called death
For inside this earthen chamber
I am breathing my last breath

Tears are shed
Mournful strife
Flowers strewn
As you burry life

I hear the resounding clang
Of the consecrated bell
Holy water chills my face
But why can't you tell

I can not move
I am trapped inside
Don't bother to exhume
I have already died

Don't just stand there
Fucking help me
With the lid closed
I can't even see

How cold the grave
