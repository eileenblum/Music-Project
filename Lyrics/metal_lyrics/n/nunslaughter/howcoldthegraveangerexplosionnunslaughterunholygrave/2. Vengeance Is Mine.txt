[performed by Nunslaughter]Vengeance is mine and recompense
At the time when your foot shall slide
Punishment is mine and reward
For the day of your calamity is at hand
Vengeance is mine sayeth the lord
Downfall is near, sudden their fate
Mine are vengeance
Things that shall come make haste

Son of God comes as King and all the angels descend
People of all the nations gathered before him
He will divide them sheep from the goats
The righteous will ascend and the others at his left
