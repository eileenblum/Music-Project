[September '95 / Music: Necromass / Lyrics: C. Blasphemy]

Impurity... reality... rebellion... rebel to our past!

Impurity, I'm obsessed by an image of my person pure,
deformity, created by degrade,
disfigured, divinity of indecent morality.

I passed though one illusion,
I dreamed a rebel world,
I dreamed an unpure world,
A dream of life's value...

Thelema, will open the sky, will open all minds, impurity "will",
because there's no "god" superior than me,
your morality, worm, has failed.
Your humanity, worm, was an illusion.
Suppressed light by the passing of time.

... Strong worm save me, I'm unpure...Â 
... Strong worm, bastard, I'm unpure...Â 
... Strong worm save me, I'm unpure...Â 
... Strung worm, bastard, I'm unpure...
LIFE'S VALUE...
UNPURE...

Your "love" has not convinced.
Shallowed, unpure,
Shallowed by time,
Shallowed by experience, shallowed by someone not so illuded.

Once into life,Â 
abyss calls life,Â 
into a story,Â 
of wounded glory.
abyss calls life,Â 
this is the story of wounded glory

Impurity, I'm obsessed by an image of my person pure,
divinity, created by degrade...
I passed through one illusion,
I dreamed a rebel world,
I dreamed an unpure world,
I dream of life's value

Dreaming with a new sky that Thelema has created this
night, look there's a sky,Â 
"Beyond the opposite lines"

Dreaming with a new sky that Thelema has created this
night, look there's a sky,
"Beyond the time"

Dreaming with a new sky that Thelema has created this
night, look there's a sky,
"Open your eyes"

Dreaming with a new sky that Thelema has created this
night, look there's a sky,
"The way to insight"

Dreaming with a new sky that Thelema has opened this night,
Looking at the sky that will open (one day) the way to insight...Â 
(ONE DAY)
