[October '95 / Music: Necromass / Lyrics: C. Blasphemy]

A shadow is moving... images are passing...
A scream with no level... one's frame to sad...
oppressing my view of life, run again, images are passing...
oppressing the light to my eyes... DARK, SKY, SCARED...
SCARED... OUR SKY IS SCARED... SCARED...

Neverending way it reaches the end
Neverending way it reaches the abyss
Neverending way it reaches the summit
Neverending way it reaches this level
Neverending way it reaches the ray
Neverending way it reaches the blade
Neverending way it reaches the pain
Neverending way it reaches that hell

A serpent is screaming in the abyss... feelings ...shivers...
a scream like a vortex... scared
schizophrenic contortions...
schizophrenic devotion...
run away from the world of men's "god",
run away from the world of their sun,
run away from the world of denied stars
run away my animal... screaming... shadow...
NIGHT... TONIGHT...
immense shadow's moving ...deep, hidden life...
oppressing my view of life ...oppressing the light to my eyes...
SCARED, SCARED, SCARED, SCARED

Neverending way it reaches the end... through the abyss
Neverending way it reaches the abyss... deep summit
Neverending way it reaches the summit... strange level
Neverending way it reaches this level... through the ray
Neverending way it reaches the ray... through the blade
Neverending way it reaches the blade... through the pain
Neverending way it reaches the pain... through one's hell
Neverending way it reaches that hell... true hell

A serpent is screaming in the abyss... feelings... warmth...
a scream like a vortex... dark
schizophrenic black art
schizophrenic black art

Run away from the world of men's "god",
Run away from the world of their sun,
Run away from the world of denied stars
Run away my animal.
