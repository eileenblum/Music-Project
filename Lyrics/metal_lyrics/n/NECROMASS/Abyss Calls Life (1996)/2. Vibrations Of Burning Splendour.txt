[June '95 / Music: Necromass / Lyrics: C. Blasphemy]

Immense... splendent chasm, explosions of bodies in front
of my eyes,
in the darkness all around, sinister wide, the flame of pain and
sadness flared up again... holocaust, immense.

Dilatation again, into the abyss called life,
echo of (an) image wrapping me, once again,
I look at this black sky, I can't see light, certainty.

I'm flying into my will, I'm sure of this darkness once again,
clouds... unreal... disease is raining.

Vibrate, vibrations of burning splendour,
vibrate, vibrations of a new dawn of death

death all around, death all around, death all around, death...

Evilness immense, in my eyes see the pain,
you will never understand...
evilness immense, in the sky see the absence,
you will never understand...

god bastard father save your world you created it...
vile, destroy.

Light of day, your the decadence of splendour,
Light of day, your the decadence of glory,
Light of day, your the decadence of splendour,
Light of day, your the decadence of glory,
vile, destroy.

Delirant, obscure, sculptured, non-future, so evil,
monumental rebirth...

Dying breath, delirant intellect,
Dying breath, obscure vaults monumental,
Dying breath, monumental, so evil,
Dying breath, monumental will

Dying hearts...
Evilness... immense, in my eyes you see the pain,
you will never understand, false god!
Evilness... immense, in the sky see absence,
you will never understand... FUCK GOD!!

MY BASTARD FATHER SAVE YOUR WORLD YOU CREATED IT,
DESTROY VILE!
