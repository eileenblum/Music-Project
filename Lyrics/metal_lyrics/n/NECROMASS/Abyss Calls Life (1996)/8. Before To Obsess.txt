[Music: Necromass / Lyrics: J.C. Kerioth - C. Blasphemy]

Inner state of mind, strange, unknown for all,
lost in my sigh, and my psyche's depression,
when the clouds are red...
when you gave the stab... remember...

Follow my pattern, light turned over, end, hallucinated,
empty mind, stare absent, light turned over in that day,
when the darkness said: "When the sky will cry, one day
in the future, conquer the past, conceal the lies,
open your eyes!"

Don't forget my qualm, calm is coming quite, to be
your master of life, scared by future?
when the light will die, calm your master of lies...

DELIRIUM that night, Delirium that sight
BEFORE TO OBSESS

DELIRIUM that light, Delirium tonight
BEFORE TO OBSESS

Follow my pattern, light turned over, end, hallucinated,
empty mind, stare absent, light turned over in that day

And the darkness gave:
Unknown communication
Before true Obsession

"When the sky will cry, one day in the future,
conquer the past, conceal the lies, open your eyes"

DELIRIUM that night, Delirium that sight
BEFORE TO OBSESS

DELIRIUM that light, Delirium tonight
BEFORE TO OBSESS
BEFORE TO OBSESS

"Developing philosophies of dreams turned to stone,
breathing your mind, material thoughts of edges never seen,
unseen, unclean... now you know, obsessed son"

Sky... obsessed, sky obsessed...

Obsessed is my sigh, tonight
obsessed is my life, tonight
images of squalid events, tonight
obsessed images of life, tonight

when the sky will cry, one day in the future,
conquer the past, conceal the lies:

OPEN YOUR EYES.
