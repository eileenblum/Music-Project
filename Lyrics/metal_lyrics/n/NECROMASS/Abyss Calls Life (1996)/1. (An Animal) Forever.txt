[Music: Necromass / Lyrics: C. Blasphemy]

A look of ice deeply sad, impressed in my mind,
I remember two eyes of an animal free, glorious,
he was running with the wind as a king without malice,
not stupid like men, which think about strength,
your dement vanity, poor fools learn to be strong!

A will of innocence and force, suppressed,
don't you see he's alone, he's dead, denied from men,
just for his strength, I feel his pain into my skin
and deep into my flesh.

I remember his eyes when he was running with the winds
that he lost forever, forever the winds of strong soul,
he was stronger than men.

A will of innocence and force suppressed, don't you see
he's alone, he's dead, denied from men,
that he'd always respected, I feel his pain on my skin,
and deep into my flesh. Eating my flesh.

OH, Mother I'm a rebel forever,
OH, Mother I can't betray thou name,
OH, Mother I'm a rebel forever,
OH, Mother your tears are killing me.

Silent mother, your call is sad
Silent mother, why is everything sad?

Allmighty mother I can't betray your suffering
Allmighty mother I can't betray your pain

Silent mother... your call is sad
Silent mother... why is everything sad?

Tears are falling in the abyss forever,
my hate is stronger than their heaven,
tears are falling mother of ever,
I've lost my peace forever...

Submission will be shown again, no grudge, you don't want
revenge, and again you'll create the men, that will decide
your death.

Tears are falling in the abyss forever,
my hate is stronger than their heaven,
tears are falling mother of ever,
I've lost my peace forever.
