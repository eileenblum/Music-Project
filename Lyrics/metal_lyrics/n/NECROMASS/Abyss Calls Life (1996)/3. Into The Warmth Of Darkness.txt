[December '95 / Music: Necromass / Lyrics: C. Blasphemy]

Looking all around, fire all around, collapsing, appalling,
crucified, into flames, walking... into the warmth
infernal breath... into the warmth
horizons are turning into: horizons
are burning
horizons morbid
horizons symbolic...

horizons burning, tremors perturbing: body, mind, soul (are:)

Crossing the plain of mind devastation
into the trip of mind laceration
across the fields of endless obsession
voyage through, personal disturbs...

across the time, across the pain
there's our sky unites earth
crucified... crucified

into the warmth of darkness, I see the past, I see horizons,
I see they're dead, looking back, looking back
unite black sun to planet earth.

Across the time, winds cut the mind,
there's the sky unites unites earths
crucified... crucified

into the warmth of darkness, I feel the past,
I see black planets are going to rest,
look at them, look at them...
delirant passages through death.

Body, mind, soul... are burning

Into the warmth of darkness, I see the death,
I see our planet is going to rest,
looking back, looking back: CRUCIFIED BASTARDS CALLED MEN

Horizons burning, tremors perturbing
Horizons burning, tremors perturbing
Horizons burning, tremors perturbing: BODY, MIND, SOUL

Walking the plain of mind devastation,
into the trip of mind laceration,
across the fields of endless obsession,
voyage through, personal disturbs.
