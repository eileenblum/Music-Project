Before the gateway
An eerie calm
Unbroken silence
Herald of storms
A dormant force is awakening
In the shadows beyond
To forge a new equilibrium
Through primal chaos reformed

Shine a star
That brings no light
Search the earth
Split the skies
Smite them down
With deathly strikes
Part the seas
Know thy might

O lord of storms
Messianic augury
Of a new disorder
Whose flag unfurled
Guide me now to deliverance
Through perilous rites of contempt
This elemental labyrinth of death

Harbinger of oblivion
Divinity incarnate
Malevolent will of nature
Lead me to my fate

Reign forever
In frozen time
Purge all weakness
Ageless heathen deity

O seas of storm...!

Beyond the gateway to eternity
Chaotic bliss I break
The silence I ride the storm
I have become the pandemonium
The nameless malice beyond
The ancient voice
Of the raging wind
In primal chaos reborn

Shine a star
That brings no light
Search the earth
Split the skies
Smite them down
With deathly strikes
Part the seas
Know thy might

O lord of storms
Messianic augury
Of a new disorder
Whose flag unfurled
Guide me now to deliverance
Through perilous rites of contempt
This elemental labyrinth of death
