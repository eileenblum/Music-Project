Luminous spectre
unveiled in nocturnal lustre
Refuse the lights
Reclaim the throne of might
All now succumb to darkness
Beneath your erupt reflections
Pale memories refracted
Through the storming winter's tide

Celestial
Astral sentinel
Almighty observer
So cold and austere
Revelations in the gloom of luna sphere
Dark veil of night embrace me
Reveal your infinite extent
Obscure the fires of antiquity
All thirteen aeons in your wake

O watcher above
The waters below
Obscure my divinations
And through me shall your wisdom over flow

I, Lord of the undeath
Iconoclast of the celestial descent
Reach out through the cosmic domain
Sub astral laws shall not confine me
The lunar energies align
Noctilcent rays of despair
Like frozen daggers through the exosphere
Smile down upon the waning world
Withering eternally beneath us
Pure majesty in stagnant time.

Diabolical moon-time ritual
Stalling the heavens in galactic suspense
To cast its shadow upon the firmament
All now succumb to darkness
Consumed by lamentation
Pale memories diminishing
As all endure this endless night
