Long before the peace of tyranny
There was a legend from the age of myth
Then I was a worthy enemy
Not this wretched husk of regolith
A cast off in his shadow

Even then consumed by jealousy
I sought to rob him of his pride
The wealth of self-assurance sickened me and I pledged to see his name decried
I, Apothyon, live to challenge thee!

His countenance flared wild,
The arrogance of my decree
I come to storm your solace
I am the wind of progress
He laughed and feigned disinterest
Thus began my annals of decline

The shame of my defeat
Was cast across my face
A testament to change
Reveal the means to our final outcome
With scars written in stone
Oceanus procellarum

My well of hatred carried me
And brought our bodies close enough for blows
Fueled by interstellar animosity
The balance ruptured and the orbit closed
Our atmospheres ignited

My wrath had reached escape velocity
But felt upon him like a sickly child
My every effort was futile
Deflected by its greater forces
His retaliation shook my all
Stripped bare to the core
Pieces of me were scattered away
Into the furthest reaches of the night...

The giant impact the beckoning end
To lift the veil for evermore...
And in the flash was knowledge
All life is meteoric
Worlds fail and break their promise
I challenged death and was renewed

The shame of my defeat
Was cast across my face
A testament to change
Reveal the means to our final outcome
With scars written in stone
Oceanus procellarum

Wounds coalescent transcribed the reform
From mark of the vanguished
To heart of the storm
I took it upon me
I made it my own
I have written your end in the stars
So let it be known
These billows of anguish
I brought forth to obscure
The remnants of your pitiful works
For all shall be pure in the final eclipse...
