The searching strands of matter
Bound by collective thought
Driven to feed and prosper
And nothing more
Wasting not
And wanting all
The bioremediator heeds our call
Destined to rot forever
Upon the forest floor
This is the end of being
And nothing more
Woe is me,
This death of trees
Their assimilation and re-integration
Into the beast

Discerning the root of all evil inside of us now
Below as above
Cruel vengeance arise from the ground
Usurper of soil
Grey ovum of the realm below
Ascend as a shroud
To conquer and grow

Malignant source of energy
Buried in the cradle folds
A rampant malice underneath
The silent labyrinths of earth so cold
All must behold
As this abomination takes hold
Born of the earth
Yet nurtured as a son
Black spore of forever
We are as one

Discerning the root of all evil inside of us now
Below as above
Cruel vengeance arise from the ground
Usurper of soil
Grey ovum of the realm below
Ascend as a shroud
To conquer and grow

Defining the rift in the fabric of being
All in decay intangible shadow
Dormant in silence
A world to betray
