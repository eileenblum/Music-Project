Tabular
Always searching through the detail
In the survey of the sentry no one fine could be too trivial to miss as this
All the abstracts, all the features
We commit to memory with the reference of sins
Authenticating the exception proves the rule
It's all symbolic as the map becomes our own

This land is bleeding it's borders imposed
Our claim to your unknown
Propagating the ways of our own world to form a throne
Tabula rasa!
Terra incognita ex humanitas
To know the way but never show the path

Hive and swine
Post-apocalyptic
Beholders and obscurers lost in something so empirical as our abyss
Temptation had assigned our legend unto this perversion of the sacred tangible
Authenticating the exception proves the rule
It's all symbolic as the map becomes our own
This land is bleeding it's borders imposed
Our claim to your unknown
Propagating the ways of our own world to form a throne
Tabula rasa!
Terra incognita ex humanitas
To know the way but never show the path

A plot to grit the mind
The only axiom comes from inside...

No mourning star
To guide our descent
No carthen form â
No milestones in death
You can never doubt me for I am your world
Alone and lost â
I am your eyes

Where our art meets science it's humanity that falls
From the shoulders of Atlas
Trapped behind our walls
Every vision and revision marks your place in hell
Where nothing matters but the matter
Nihilartikel

This land is bleeding it's borders imposed
Our claim to your unknown
Propagating the ways of our own world...
