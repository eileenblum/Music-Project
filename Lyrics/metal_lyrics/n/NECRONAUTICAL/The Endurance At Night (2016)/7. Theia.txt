She spoke to us
No longer as sons
The petulance of our youth
Had long since eroded away
But still she embraced us
Locked in her crystalline breast
Despite billions of years
All in the making of men

Now as an agent of change
In a stagnant existence
I forge my own path
Away from that foxed contentment
In great meandering loops
Across all that was known
Building momentum forwards I breached the veil
I could taste the edge of everything
The undiscovered country lay before me
Yielding open
Yet inexorably I was drawn back

The impression of those hands on mine
Still as fresh then
As all that I chose to block
And then all was made clear to me
With savage revelation
Still trapped in those designs
Was the release I sought
To own my future I had to punish my past

I pissed my name
Into your ashes
And all your work
Has been undone
What you began,
I have completed
I burned our home
Though all I'll ever be is you

I am the master of my own destiny
But all I'll ever be is you
I am the master of my own fate
But all I'll ever be is you
Theia......
