Utmost deception
A faulty copy
Buried in the silence
Of the sea
No roots to clutch nor branches grow
Out of this wasteland
Unreal country cast with blur fog
My mental island is beset by sterile thunder
Bleak rattle from afar â
Force me down

The mind is fragile â
The flesh is broken
Yet still we cope with mind and flesh
So fucking weak
The will is dwindled
The words unspoken
That to survive you only need
To breath and eat

Cold came here to breed
In amongst us
Alone and frail â now and forever
Real aurora of the evening
The dark he comforts
Blotting out the greater terrors leaving the lesser
These I'll handle, these I'll punish
They deign to take me â
I weathered worse

By endurance we conquer!
By endurance we conquer!
By endurance we conquer!

The mind is fragile â
The flesh is broken
Yet still we cope with mind and flesh
So fucking weak
The will is dwindled
The words unspoken
That to survive you only need
To breath and eat...

Despite all senses,
Besieged by ice
I shall endure â
I was transformed
As were we all
Yet I endure for I have heard survivals call

By endurance we conquer!
By endurance we conquer!
By endurance we conquer!

Haunted by memories
Buried in the maelstrom

Old conflict between the crewmen
Solved on a knife's edge
Just remember I implored them
Why we all came here
No burden for you to carry
You are your master
The ice unfeeling
But forgiving of your life before I came here for isolation
The daily struggle
Long hours of relentless darkness
Safe return doubtful
Reassurance of the unknown
Restoring power
The endurance is a journey
It is the purpose of it all
