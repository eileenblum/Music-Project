Forged;
Far beneath the frosts,
Far beneath the black,
There upon the abyssal plane
Blood of ancient gods
Frozen in its veins
To become an emblem of
Death incarnate.
Aeons of hate,
Aeons of wrath,
Aeons of ice....
Carved him gigantic yet lo,
This is no place for man,
Frostbitten souls,
Chilblained and cold,
Under the shadow of thousand-year snows,
Here waits our end:
Forged in the glacial depths.

And yet still it draws near,
Ice etched with fear;
Seeking our hearts in this wasteland of norths.
Legend will tell
Of this frozen hell
Aeons have passed
Into the aether of time.
Whose is the hand
Carving this evil design?

Forged;
Far beyond the sun
Far beyond the light,
There within perpetual black
Emanating dread
Miles beneath the pack
To create an emblem of
Depth incarnate.
Fathoms of hate,
Leagues of deceit,
Forever wait...
To be unleashed,
Elements close in
Yet we struggle on,
Battling katabatic winds alone.
Lost on these plains,
There is no justice, just ice...
Forged in the glacial depths.

And yet still it draws near,
Ice etched with fear;
Seeking our hearts in this wasteland of norths.
Legend will tell
Of this frozen hell
Aeons have passed
Into the aether of time.
Whose is the hand
Carving this evil design?
This hand is mine.

Now behold our ally,
Incubated by aeons of ice.
In league with the conquering Necronauts bold -
A tale to be told:
Forged in the glacial depths.

As one we draw near,
Ice etched with fear;
Seeking your hearts in this wasteland of norths.
Legend will tell
Of your frozen hell
Aeons have passed
Into the aether of time.
Forevermore,
Twisted to our design.
Forged in the glacial depths!
