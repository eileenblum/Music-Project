Great mother of this wretched earth,
Our call to thee;
"Extend across these wasted lands; Reclaim totality"
Swift tides align to take the world beneath their deathly stride,
Floods rise god-sized here at the end of time.

Death set upon your world.
Behold the great apocalypse unfurled.
Arise, O mighty ocean!
A deluge to slake, leave none in your wake,
And so our extinguishing will shall be done.

Bring it down, you raging ocean waves!
Come forth, eradicate these slaves.
Bring it down; reclaim the lives of man
From whence they were birthed, returned to the earth
Black sea misanthropy rise!
Bring it down.

Re-awaken the leviathan that lurks in the black abyss,
Release the waters of the polar circles from winter's grip.
Defy! Divide! The common enemy is humankind;
Define divine when they all dead do lie.

Death set upon your world.
Bare witness to the cleansing of earth.
Arise, O mighty ocean!
Saltwater's the cure, so cold and so pure,
And so our extinguishing will shall be done.

And when no morning comes,
A new day rises for the worthy ones
We are as legend to the world long-gone,
Where the rain falls foreverâ¦
