Unmask the ageless nemesis,
The numbing face of death,
and we shall gaze into its eyes.
For we are ruthless, malign descendants
With our purpose re-devised.

Now, begins our reign as lords of our domain.
We shall be victorious again.
We are the draw of your last breath,
Fearless in the face of death.

For the gift of a kill,
Dead and yet still we live to die.

Felblown winds are propelling us towards the great beyond,
Where virtue's value is untold.
Here at life's ending
Grimly ascending,
A test of strength upon the soul.

Now, bring down the rain and drown in our disdain!
We shall be victorious again.
We are the draw of your last breath
Fearless in the face of death

For the gift of a kill,
Dead and yet still we live to die.

Come hell or high water,
For we shall bring both!

I once was man,
Now I am one.
In death is life:
We are reborn as gods.

[Solo: Carcarrion]

Now, here at the end of every fucking thing:
We shall be victorious again.
We are the dark that stalks the stars.
We are necronautical.

For the gift of a kill,
Dead and yet still we live to die.
