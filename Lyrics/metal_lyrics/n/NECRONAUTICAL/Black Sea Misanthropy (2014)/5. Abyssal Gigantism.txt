I conjure, I address, I exorcise,
The divine right.
Come and obey,
Behold the symbols and names:
All nine sides
Aligned

Abyssal Gigantism,
Abyssal Gigantism,
Unholy atavism,
Abyssal Gigantism.

Before the throne of a forgotten god.
Beseech the onset condemnation.
The genesis of evolution,
It was all your conjuration.

I abhor, I exalt, I abjure
Your counterfeits.
Come and obey,
The designated ground awaits.
All thirteen circles,
Ensorcelled

(Solo: Naut)

"...and they will then immediately talk with thee, as a friend speaketh unto a friend. Ask of them all that thou desirest, with constancy, firmness and assurance, and they will obey thee. But if they appear not yet, let not the master on that account lose his courage, for there is nothing in the world stronger and of greater force to overawe the spirits than constancy. Let him, however, re-examine and reform the circle, and let him take up a little dust of the earth, which he shall cast out towards the four quarters of the universe. And having placed his knife upon the ground, let him say upon his knees, turning towards the direction of the north, that it was all his own conjuration..."
