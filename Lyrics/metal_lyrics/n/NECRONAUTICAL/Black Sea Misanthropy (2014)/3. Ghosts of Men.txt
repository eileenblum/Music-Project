As civilizations rotted beneath the waves,
We ventured forth; unto eternity!
No star did guide us 'cross the endless sea,
Yet faded lights did beckon me.

And as I sought their origin I was drawn nearer,
A manifestation of cadavers became clearer;
A sea of spirits, an ectoplasmic mass:
The culmination of the age of man.

All of a sudden, the wisps and wraiths encircled us
Their hollow visages unearthly glowed
As bright as fire, pearlescent white hot rage
Yet never strong enough to break death's cage

They are the ghosts of men,
In servitude, they seek their promised heavens.
Deathly ghosts of men;
Here you'll wait, to haunt this world, to know forever.

Our wake spewed murder as we slogged further on,
The prow stained black with filth of ages gone,
The keel cut through their bloated corpses as water
Yet still their essences remained in pursuit of their course.

Like a typhoon, the ghostly lanterns swelled and soared,
The winds grew strong and mangled limbs were blown on board.
Sallow and faceless, a mirror of their fate;
To go unknown and die in plight,

Ignis Fatuus, you have no power here,
We'll rend your spirit, just as we purged your world.
All proved unworthy; they could not save themselves
From the maelstrom, the high waters of hell!

[Solo: Naut]

Then one spirit materialised from the flecks of bloody foam upon the deck.
Yet it was stifled bound within the grip of a noose still around its neck
It gave a warning. It went unheeded.
For what of theirs would we wish to hear?
They're worthless, like the bodies left for gulls to tear apart.
Worthless like the scraps of bone picked clean by crabs,
Worthless bloody remnants of a culture made of nothing.
Worthless like it fucking always was.

We are the ones who remain!
