Treacherous and virginal;
The endless wild hath spake its call,
Our yearning souls were seeking the unknown,
To go beyond the shoals to forever roam.
Wanderlust had brought us here,
Far away from the mundane,
Wives and lovers wept their farewells;
Never would we return again.

Fate set all our souls aflame!
Polar champions we were named.
Long before the heroic age,
Antarctica flowed in our veins.

Nothing left, not a tale untold,
Within the confines of this earth,
Only onward through the endless cold,
Destined for uncertain berth,
Yet still we dreamed of the unconquerable,
The platform for immortal life,
Legend's seed, gave us urgency, and so we stand
Dead at sea until the end!

As Hell froze over we arrived,
Upon the shore of the other side
On the unholy mountain of eternal battle: Erebus, we'd stand,
To look upon the fractured mirror of existence,
Our destiny was upon us,
The prophecy is what we'd carve.
The ascension from mortal man to transcendence,
The earth sinks forever under black sea misanthropy.
