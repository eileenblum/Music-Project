Pride in the great colossus, made great as the task commands,
Wrought by the strength and power of bloody hands,
Carved from the black obsidian of the leviathan's tomb;
God of unholy nightmares, grotesquely hewn,

This is the coming of the end,
The herald of the last divide,
The avatar begat by all.
There is no lunacy in pride

In the great colossus,
Like Eve from within us grown.
Bred from a million victims, each gave their bones.
Spawn of abyssal giants, chaos become flesh in form.
Forged in the depths of the glacier: undeath reborn,

If pride is a sin, then all are as guilty as Him.

[Solo: Carcarrion]

All hail the great colossal one,
All hail the profane congress between gods and men: "Futui post mortem!"
All hail the great leviathan,
All hail the golem carcass,
The nashamah breath for the titan of death.
All hail the great colossal one,
All hail the dark catharsis.
Purgation of sin through indulgence in.
All hail the great leviathan,
All hail the coming harvest of the weak and the failed,
To add to the one who is hailed!

Pride in the great colossus, unleashed upon the waning world,
Scourge of the weak and wretched, pathetic churls,
Guard of the new Gehenna,
Overlord and minister of your baptism of fire at the end of all.
