When the darkness is cast onto the light,
Your peace becomes illusion obscuring liberation,
Where hope is lost
When blood runs black as night
Our distant call to you
Is beckoning infernal flights

Dominion in death,
Dominion here after life,
Your will is our own
Salvation lies in the unknown

Descending down the endless spiral,
Into the void beyond the farthest borders,
Embrace us now you callow scion,
Find consciousness and freedom at the end of time

Cross the waters amassed by the damned
Incessant piety corrupting our divinity
Beyond the fires of your internal hell
The angels mourn for you as we ascend oblivion

And as the heavens burn
We shall transcend the empyrean
As interstellar elite
We have proclaimed our dominion
