Every revelation
Was written in the stars long before
To challenge the account of lived experience
Separate strands of being are not a shared reality

And so to perceive our course
One must exist outside of its bonds

Tangential lives
Spiral ever in 'til their demise
Our seething hearts drift atop the flow
Warped by introspection, beyond all recognition

Digressive lines dissipate
Touching only briefly if at all
To stay the fall
And if this cosmic wheel could narrate
Who would know the text but the author, the other?

Lucretius' javelin
Penetrates the fog
A chance encounter with infinity
The omnipresent past
Becomes the launching pad
So spread your wings towards the edge

Towards the edge of everything
Lost in the vast periphery
To seek the answer to the puzzle of our lives

In his elegant repose
Was existence paralleled?
Did we idly dream the world,
Our heaven and their hell?
Ancient logic thus demands
That all life come to its end
But the spiral ever delves
And the sky anew ascends...
