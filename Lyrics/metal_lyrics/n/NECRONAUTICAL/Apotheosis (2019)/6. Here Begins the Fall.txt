The steadfast stone engraved with hypocrisy
Imposed upon the right to exist
An obelisk to appease atrocity
Commanding awe to compel you to forgive

The cult of the selfless
A moralist front
To redefine virtue as the serving of vice

Oblivion becomes your final measure of faith

The cosmic guilt of which their code's comprised
That their revelation is in conflict with your will

Upon false foundations
an unchanging law of self-immolation
That you must destroy yourself to be pure
Here begins the fall

Inaction built these walls, our indifference monolithic
An endless penance for a crime yet uncommitted.
Here begins the fall

A sin without volition, shows inherent flaws
In the stonework of the prison, here begins the fall.

We are but animals born to be sacrificed
Upon the altar of altruism
All default to exaltation
As one, all abide
At one, all await
The promises empty, the solace is broken again
Slaved by this mystical deceit

Values enshrined that self-abnegation is spiritual
Our every impulse is denied.
