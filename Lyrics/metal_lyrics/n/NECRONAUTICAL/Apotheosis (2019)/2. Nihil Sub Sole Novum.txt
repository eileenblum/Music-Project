An ancient sun rises 'cross the sky,
As on this world as any other,
And hasteless turns the dial of days.
In everything there is an apathy

All rivers run and are returned
And yet the sea is never full.
The clever moon will roll the tides
And still its grip will ever pull.
The gales will rage and then relent
But wind will never want for breath.
The forests burn and are rebirthed
Their roots will feed upon our death.
No end to reconcile my anguish
Nihil sub sole novum
What has been before will be again
Nihil sub sole novum
Nunc vadam iterum

In all I feel is apathy
These cruel reverberations are but echoes of the dawn
Ah! The crimson fire reveals and etches truth upon my bones

The constant rewriting in the ages before us
Implicit in the vein, here in his nebula of dust

There came no end to reconcile my anguish
Nihil sub sole novum
What has been before will be again
Nihil sub sole novum

Whilst ever present; this hell is cyclical.
The cost of promise is to fork the path
I chose this burning curiosity,
A searing word to leave upon the page.
