I reject your veneration
Condemn your lack of vision
No facet of man would suffice to sate deification
Bearing the fools' derision
No prophet am I but the brunt of a tongue
I deify your indecision
Your emptiness, your apathy, your flaws

We all have to fall
To ever survive
Your loftiest goals reduced to last rites

All believers reap their reward
Or are cast into the wilderness
Exiled from fate's illusion
The borders of reality's choke-hold

The burden of faith:
You cling to the old,
Where god had a face, but never was whole.
The price of your prayers repaid evermore
The rapturous stare âcross the cosmos and into the void.

Witness the end of all ends
When all becomes grey

You chose not to see the sack-clothed souls compete
Mourning, wailing, down on their knees
Seeking some closure for faith but failing again
The endgame concealed
All purpose is lost
The journey is only beginning

Wanting....
Rich in the scorn of their gaze
Waiting...
Locked in their master's embrace

Restless...
Writhe in the ash of the son
Aimless...
And so it is done

All of your pitiful lives
Building to this moment
Tangential entity
Behold the new king, the same as the old
Long live his subjugation
Exalt irresolution
Rid of the burden of proof
In this apotheosis
