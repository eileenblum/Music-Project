In the embodiment of liberty
That all are free to endure
Come now, take part in the coming valuation
Of the great leveler's cure
For those of noble descent
Deigned to descend with the mongrels of chance
All shall be equal again
In amoral finality
In your cosmic irrelevance

Come lambs and wolves
Repeat until we fade
All of our impetus is unmade

Who was the wise man and who was the fool?
Now reconciled in the lifeless brotherhood.
Who was the king and who was the pawn?
All your distinctions are lost to the soil
Whatever adorned you has dulled
Its lustre annulled
'Neath the pathways of worms
Into the archival void
An unchanging force
Hail the triptych, hail the fourth!

Come lambs and wolves
Repeat until we fade
All of our impetus is unmade

Irrational creature
You who sought your reward
There is no escaping this fate
From becoming at one with the void
