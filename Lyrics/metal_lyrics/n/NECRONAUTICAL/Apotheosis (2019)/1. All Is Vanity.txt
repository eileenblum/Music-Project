Beyond the veil I see time's purpose in the passing
Imagined visions left congealing on the stone
âneath which the ritual, the old convention
Dispels the glamour of the corpse upon the throne

Born to a failed prophecy
All they knew was a fallacy
Their eyes turned blind in disbelief
To the higher truth: All is vanity

All empires fall into obscurity
All horizons fail
The more I know the less I hope

Your every action is indifference,
And progenation is the tritest of them all.
The seed they scatter, begetting vessels,
Filled with the hollow promise of a false eternity

Behold
Graven in the image of the godhead
Wrought by benefactors of the creed
Whether robed in flesh of flock or shepherd
All is vanity

All empires fall into obscurity
All horizons fail
The more I know the less I hope

All is vanity
All is vanity
All is vanity

Covenants to empower and enslave
In false worth of life
In flock of Christ
Behind the gilt conceit
We bear the earth forged manacles of faiths great treachery
Great darkness lies âneath marble skies
So thinly veiled, I implore once more; apostasy!
What does man gain by all the toil at which he toils under the sun?
A parable to clutch?
This world a monument to shame
All is vanity
A striving after wind
All monotony
The more I know; all is vanity!
All empires fall into obscurity
All horizons fail
The more I know the less I hope
