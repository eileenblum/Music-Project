It dwells in the esoteric,
The realm of astral thoughts
Latched upon the thinker's art
Scheming for the source.
Engorged by stolen doctrines
Its malignance beckons forth
Now, manifest
Anthropomorphized force

Throned without will for ascension
Quenched by drought in a thirst for truth
For what was I but a spec of dirt within the dust?
Cast aside to return an empty ambivalent soul

When the spark is liberated
As from the cradle torn
The darkness shapes a vacant persona
His nothingness is born.
Behold his lack of lips to read,
His numbing face forlorn.
Grotesque simulacrum of none
Whose coming dulls the dawn

To know the lure of the abyss
Is transformation of the self
The gnosis of reality: a compromise
How can you reconcile the brevity of a single life
With the grander story of humanity?
Glib aphorisms won't suffice!

To resist the abyssal allure
Is to deny the human condition
I persist, the old ideal anew
In exaltation of the null
