There is none more great than the lord thy god
Stretch thine arm to strike those who would deny me
Thy lord is sourly displeased
Their blood shall be upon them

Spare not the unbelievers
For they heed not the Word of the lord thy god
Trespassing upon the land of thy lord
Their blood shall be upon them

Tread upon the backs of the kneeling
For they bow before hideous images
Their vile chanting be silenced
Their blood shall be upon them

Put to death the idolaters
For they have fallen to whoredom and wickedness
Their bodies are like vessels of iniquity
Their blood shall be upon them

Destroy their houses of worship
Be they smashed to their foundations
And the foundation stones themselves
Be dug up and cast away forever

Take all their heads
And pile them up before the lord thy god
Burn down the cities
In which they dwell

Blessed is he who takes up his arms
And proclaims the furious anger of the lord
Blessed is he who purifies in the lord`s name
Let him receive eternal life
