I come
From the living centre of Hell
I will fix and I will finish
I solve everything

I am the helping hand of Armageddon
Inspirator behind the cleansing
Genocide - Satan Lives!
Genocide - Satan Lives!

I dictate what needs to be done
To save this shithole from surviving
Listen to me
I am the Way

Disrupting the total equilibrium
All balance must be banished
Peace ripped to pieces
All is good when all is dead

I will bring the world to sleep
And leave it with raging Chaos
The end and perfection
Of the Great Work

I will not disappear
I will only get worse
Inexorable Evil
Everything bows before Satan Ex Machina

I will swallow the soul of the Earth
I will swallow the soul of the Earth
I will swallow the soul of the Earth
I will swallow the soul of the Earth

Darkness.  Blackness.  Death.
As I help creation to get rid of itself
Rewinding the life cycle until nothing is left
Let's celebrate the end of existence!
