In wormholes they gather
Human maggots singing praise
On their knees beneath the ground
Hunchbacked for the feast

Coffin flies amassed
Congregated in gluttony
Hungering for sores and other holes
To multiply mongoloid larvae

Digging their way
Through cracks in the soil
Tunnelling down to their dinner
Jesus is waiting

The flies are starved
Unearting their holy host
To feed over his carcass
Jesus is served

Snorting up the stench of salvation
As love exudes from their rotting messiah
A swarming stampede high on decay
Exultant as they excavate

Maggots come, maggots come
Crawl up the cunt of Christ
Cave him out from inside
Infantile sect of insects
Inhabit the corpse
Clean up the skeleton
Eat the rot to the bone
Jesus Loves You
And receives with open wounds
