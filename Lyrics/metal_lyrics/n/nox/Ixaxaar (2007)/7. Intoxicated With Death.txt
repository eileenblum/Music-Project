I lie hidden
Enshrined in Darkness
Stiff and silent
Waiting to awake my Self

I appear dead before my own eyes
Staring coldly at my vacant face
Gaze fixation on my own corpse
Which is now a grave to rot in

Deadly unbalanced to Outer Negative
Infinite Blackness of body and soul
I realize
There is no life inside this body

Broken from the world
And broken from my Self
I lock all access to my conscience
And welcome catatonia

Out of this dying death cell
With walls of flesh
Bars of bone
And me in between

Bound and loathing
Razored and restless
In my wrappings of tissue
Slash this prison of skin

From embodied to disembodied
Exposing my soul
To the full onslaught of Chaos
I shall be liberated

I am becoming Noxul
A terror to my own psyche
A terror antagonizing my body
I shall be completely Chaotic

Branded to reach Omnipotence
The secret knowledge
And the forbidden wisdom
Will be mine

Fangs thrust my soul
As I call upon the Risen Serpent
Drugged with infernal injections
I receive the acid from Amenta

Intoxicated with Death
Struck by the Triple Tongue of Fire
Fragments of my Self exploded together
I am born
