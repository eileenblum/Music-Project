Firesnakes ascending
Uncoiled to bring Hell
From above and below
We come with Darkness cruelly

Strangling the world
Tightening our grip with each rotation
We slither around the throat of existence
And squeeze out all life

Spitting venom in the face of the earth
Feel the rush of Death!

Intoxicating all mankind
We are method to the madness
Narcotic terror
Triple Death and Dispersion!

Illuminating the blessed and the damned
With triple tongues of fire
Incinerating reason
Nothing will ever be the same!

Free of birth and dying
Elusive Evil moving unnoticed
An unholy hallucination
We were never here

Spitting venom in the face of the earth
Feel the rush of Death!

Configurated by Chaos
Our God has no face
We have no core, we just are
And we are forever
