Hail, Choronzon, hail
Come, Choronzon, come
I salute and conjure thee
O Choronzon

By the chaos that moves me
By the madness that imprisons me
By the power of undying darkness
I conjure thee again

By the word that opens Zax
Zarzax calls upon thee
By three and by three and by three
Come unto me

Hail unto thee
Who art thrice one
Whose name is the second death
Thou, who outnumbers the legions of light

Thou, whose voice is the insane babble
Of a multitude of demons
Thou, who screams 'I am I'
Come forth from the nothingness

Thou art the master of form
And from thee all forms proceed
Thou, who hasth no face
For thou hasth all faces

Thy ways are the methods to the madness
Share my insane hatred
Against the supposed creator
And slay the sons of man

Zodacare Od Zodameranu
Zodacare Od Zodameranu
Zodacare Od Zodameranu
Zodacare Od Zodameranu

Unsanctify this place of peace
That ll righteousness departs from it
Befaul this planet with the stench
Of thhy excrements

O Choronzon
Thou, who art seated higher than the heavens
I pray that thou bestoweth unto me
The knowledge of the world between being and not

Feel free to manifest
Feed upon the names of god
For thou art master of the triangle
Come unto me

Come to life
Corruptor of al coherence
Set ablaze this earth of matter
Rise, Choronzon, rise

Lexarph, Comanon, Tabitom
Come Choronzon
I welcome thee
I am servitor to thy dominion

Zodacare Od Zodameranu
