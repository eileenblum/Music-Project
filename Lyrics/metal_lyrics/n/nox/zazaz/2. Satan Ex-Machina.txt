I come
From the living centre of hell
I will fix and I will finish
I solve everything

I am the helping hand of armageddon
Inspirator behind the cleansing
Genocide, Satan lives!!!
Genocide, Satan lives!!!

I dictate what needs to be done
To save this shithole from surviving
Listen to me
I am the way

Disrupting the total equilibrium
All balance must be banished
Peace ripped to pieces
All is good when all is dead

I will bring the world to sleep
And leave it one with the raging chaos
The end and perfection
Of the great work

I will not disappear
I will only get worse
Inexorable evil
Everything bows for Satan ex-machina

I will swallow the soul of the earth
I will swallow the soul of the earth
I will swallow the soul of the earth
I will swallow the soul of the earth

Darkness, blackness, death
As I help creation to get rid of itself
Rewinding the life cycle, until nothing is left
Let's celebrate the end of existence
