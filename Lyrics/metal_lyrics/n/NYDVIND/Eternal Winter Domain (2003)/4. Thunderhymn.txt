The nine ravens will fly and dive into infernal fires
In the grand valleys
The mighty thunder will force the season to die

Wings of destruction and there's no way out
To run and forget your duty
This is a nocturnal call to war

Always strong, it drowns and embraces the nine worlds
Once inside the woods, the lightning strikes

Night spreads her robe upon the frozen land
Plunging down into depths
Winds will provoke the clouds and drain the skies
Flooding the Land and setting forests ablaze

Winds and fires gather for the storm to come
A darkened horizon falls upon the land in flames

Under the moonlight the curse will never end
Nightshades and thunder shall rule the world forever
For my heart is brave I'll stand down there in pride
And if she calls my name
I'll stand to praise my burning ground

Winds and fires gather for the storm to come
A darkened horizon falls upon the land in flames
