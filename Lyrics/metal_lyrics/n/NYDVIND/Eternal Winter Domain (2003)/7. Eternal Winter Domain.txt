There's a land where the ground is pure and natural
There's a land where the hills are dressed in white
There's a land where the keeps are edified in ice
There's a land where the snow erects its throne

Under cold nordic skies, the earth has turned hard as stone
My blood will flow in its core, I hear the call of my fatherland

Above crystalline domes, darkness lays down its crown
Icewinds whirl in a drone, I hear the call of my nightrealm

Among the clouds, upon the highest mountains
Eternal Winter, shadowed domain

There's a land where...

I feel my kingdom come, a silent reign on the world
I am filled with its might, I am one with my fatherland

Among the clouds, upon the highest mountains
Eternal Winter, shadowed domain
Through the blizzard I creep alone
Final ride to die, fine day to die

At last, my Winter Queen promised me here as a prince I can be
To merge with icy lands and to serve Her for eternity

Through the blizzard I creep alone
Final ride to die

And the snow started covering me
Plunging me into this frozen palace
Observing this fathomless realm of white
Falling into the depths of the Earth

There's a land where...

I feel my kingdom come, a silent reign on the world
I am filled with its might, I am one with my fatherland
