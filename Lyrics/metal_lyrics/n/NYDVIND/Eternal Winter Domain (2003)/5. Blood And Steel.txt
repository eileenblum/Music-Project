For the blood and souls of our Fathers
An allegiance to our ancient order

A wardance, inheritance of old
Veins will drain in rivers, bloodred

Pride is the strength that will guide
The flash of the blades in a trance
No one can bring down these warriors
Prideful intrepid fighting men

Into the fires of thunder
The souls of our enemies drowned
And under the sign of the morningstar
The flag is forever to rise

For the blood and souls of our Fathers
Allegiance to our ancient order
