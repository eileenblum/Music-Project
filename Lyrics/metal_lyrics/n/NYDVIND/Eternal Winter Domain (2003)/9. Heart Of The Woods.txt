Ablaze are the spirits among which I rest
In the heart of this darkgreen realm of giant oaks
My long forgotten forest, precious kingdom of timeless grace and secrets

Heart of the woods, a sacred wisdom
Shall dwell eternally in our pagan blood
Come forth Lord of the trees, and possess our souls
We will serve ye forever oh graceful God

Rising through the night, engraved in stones
The sacred wood, these collonades of an ancient pride

Eternal Gods, supreme fathers of a glorious past
I praise their divine crown
