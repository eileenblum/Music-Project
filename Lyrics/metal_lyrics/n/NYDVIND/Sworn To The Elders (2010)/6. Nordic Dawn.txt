Dawn, the sun will rise in silence
Pouring down its blazing light on the shades of the world

Now that I've walked in the cold through the misty forests
Frostbitten in my heart and my soul
Now that I've followed the wings of the Ravenlord all night long
Now that I've climbed to the highest mountains
At the gates of the passage leading to the clouds
I have arrived to the top of the world to be enraptured by the dawn

The frozen moors slumber in obscurity, awaiting the morning sun
Daylight in nordic and azure infinity, thou rise

Now that I've walked in the cold through the misty forests
Frostbitten in my heart and my soul
Now that I've followed the wings of the Ravenlord all night long
Now that I've climbed to the highest mountains
At the gates of the passage leading to the clouds
I have arrived to the top of the world to be enraptured by the dawn

The nordic dawn shines through the dormant woods
As the mist disappears
Daylight in nature and peaceful infinity, thou rise

Swamps are bathed in nordic rays
The dream of one brave man was to embrace this precious dawn, O'Mine
