As a leaf carried by the winds, in cold autumn dusk
As the oak broken by fury of the storm
My roots will remain on these lands, where I was born
And in death, these leaves will cover my grave

As a path blinding my sight of azure and snow
As a light guiding my way towards the stars

Stand on the shores in the heat of flames
To honour your brave and his memory
Swear to this man to cherish his land and his legacy
Sworn to the elders

As the breeze blowing my soul in icy kingdoms
As a crow diving into the underworld

Stand on the shores in the heat of flames
To honour your brave and his memory
Swear to this man to cherish his land and his legacy
Sworn to the elders

Sword on side, shield on chest, my soul will drift away
Above the frozen lake
Choirs resound from the shores, blessing my departure
Towards infinite pits

My body burns in fires, released in heathen rites
Onwards to the nine worlds in the glare of the pyre

Raise your spears to the sky in an iron arch
Honour your ancestors
Bards sing my glory in funeral chants
Forefather of the tribe

My body burns in fires, released in heathen rites
Onwards to the nine worlds in the glare of the pyre

Into these lands of sorrow where the claws of time freeze my soul
Gathered with ancients the spirit of our clan is to be preserved

I feel eternity creeping into my whole being disembodied
The fear of the unknown as I vanish into the fog

Blessed be the memory of those who were the fathers of our culture
These glorious ancestors will guide our march to celestial realms

Into these lands of sorrow where the claws of time freeze my soul
Despite the solitude and cold I feel the ardour of my sons

For my blood and memory in their veins will forever flow
And when the time will come for them I will be there to wait them all
