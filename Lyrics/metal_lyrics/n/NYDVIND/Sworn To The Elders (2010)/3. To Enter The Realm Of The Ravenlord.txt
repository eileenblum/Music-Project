They are coming with the grey fog
When darkness falls all over the land
They are appearing from nowhere
When night shadows begin to spread out

Crossing the gates of this dark place
Hearing their chants in the winter wind
Freezing calls deep into your heart
From this land there will be no escape

No longer man but animal
You feel your nature is transforming
As you enter a mysterious world
And slowly your heart is emptying

You are welcome in the court of the king
For as a raven you walk
Corvids fly all around in a turmoil
And you are part of the horde
You swear allegiance to a strange crow
Protect and serve him you must
An undefined and weird body with giant wings
The ravenlord

You dark guardian of my dismal realm
Your black mates you can trust
From human beings you have to keep it clean
No one must harm our den
Take their souls and bring them to me
They are a so vile folk
And I will send them where they deserve to be
In nothingness

One day we will expand our realm
Beyond the frontiers of these woods
Conquering the world is not a dream
And we will prevail for good
