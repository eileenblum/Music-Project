When the shades of death glide over your hearts
And when believes become a force
You swear allegiance to idols

I am the godless, forsaken child from grace

Blinded by your cults and lost in your rites
You sink in a shadowed age
You are fools, perverted by your fears

Following the will of gods, you creep in lies and ignorance

When the gleam of dawn appears to my sight
And when landscapes invade my heart
I swear allegiance to nature
I am the godless, the son of Mother Earth

Banished from our lands, rejected by clans
Betrayed by my will of truth
I am the wise, disciple of knowledge

Wandering from plains to crests to learn the mysteries of our world

Sadness, lonesome, creeping as forlorn exile
Persecuted, martyr, I have to hide

In cold shades of my own terror
Dying in this rising solitude
Darkness is grabbing my soul
Crying in the lack of understanding
Madness!

Through these grim shadows, my soul revealed itself
In a world of faith, hatred will prevail

Through these grim shadows my soul has drown in pain
In the court of gods I will die in silence
