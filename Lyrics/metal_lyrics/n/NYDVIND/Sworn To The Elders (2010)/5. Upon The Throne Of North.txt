Through the frozen and misty woods
In this dark place where I was born
From eternal majestic forests
Upon the throne of our realm

Through the summits of our mountains
And the expanses of our plains
From the icy peaks of our crests
Upon the throne of our kingdom

By the splendour of North my brave soul is spellbound

Beyond the tops of the snow covered mountains are stars twinkling bright
As burning suns in the night they stare at the darkened earth
And for thousand years, nature prevailed in serenity, frost and storms
For the purest quintessence of heathen spirit dwells in these lands

Chanting these words to the glory of our world
To make one with the Earth until the end of times
