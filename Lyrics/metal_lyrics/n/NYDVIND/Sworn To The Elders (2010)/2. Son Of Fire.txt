Flames of power burn in my eyes
Pagan fires inflame my valiant soul
Fever of conquest will guide my blade
For destruction in a blast of fury

Deep in my heart pounds the will for victory

Under black skies, in fields of blood
Reign the fires of revenge and rage
Anger is my bride in this warfare
No prisoners but a smell of dying

Deep in my heart pounds the will for victory

Wrecking, raging fights
Slaying and raping in rapture
Power striking down in a thrashing might

Flames of power burn in my eyes
Pagan fires inflame my valiant soul
Fever of conquest will guide my blade
For destruction in a blast of fury

Deep in my heart pounds the will for victory
And in battle, son of fire shall prevail
