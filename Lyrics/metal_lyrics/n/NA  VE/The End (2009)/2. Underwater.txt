Out there, and you're running around to free yourself
Out there, and you're running around to free yourself
Out there, and you're running around to free yourself
Out there, and you're running around to free yourself

The only place I'd like to see you again is underwater
The only place I'd like to see your mouth bleed is there

Deep down under, sound is no more
At night I murder, far is the shore
What if I drown, would you lose yourself for me?
I'll bring you there, even before you kiss me

Poor little animal, choice of air and water
We'll touch each other's fall, nine hundred days up to shelter
"Never again" is a masterpiece, tears die dry underneath the surface
I'll never forget your inner heat, it was my place

Let me fill your lungs with water, just to see if years run faster
Let me fill your lungs with water, just to see if years run faster
Faster...
Faster...
Faster...
