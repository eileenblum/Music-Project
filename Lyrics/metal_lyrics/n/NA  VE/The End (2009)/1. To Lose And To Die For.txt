Hurts like hell
The whole world looks in
What is it like to run alone?
And forget my name

But teeth start to fall
Don't bleed under one day more
Lady away saves my soul
Million people pray for

My clothes and skin
Mine are heavy, yours are down
Hole in my back needs healing
One in the rest needs to be drowned

Hugs and bruises, XXX for
A star afterwards and words, ex four
To lose and to die for...
...bruises, XXX for
A star afterwards and words, ex four
To lose and to die for...

Put my arms on, get warm
Oedema in the throat
Lead your claws in my back
Finally able to kill the goat

Mist and Headlights, a few miles straight on, there
Love in a Luna Park, down to the sea
Hundred million memories, cries and breathes, there
Smells like summer night, endless, secretly.
