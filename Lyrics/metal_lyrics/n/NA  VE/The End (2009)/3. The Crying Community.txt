Anywhere we are
Anything we do
We are all warm
And well hidden

Just flowing, dry eyes
Playing constantly with our sun
Playing constantly with our sun
Playing constantly with our sun
Playing constantly with our sun

'Cause

We all cry sometimes
We all do
It is not the end
It is up to you

Our own surgery
Our own change
We're all drowned from inside
Kinky way of fighting the bad man
Sell me your pride, please, do

'Cause

We all cry sometimes
We all do
It is not the end
It is up to you
