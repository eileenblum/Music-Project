The colours
The shapes
Time
And Space
The distance
Dimensions
Your chance
And your sins

As long as hope lives, everything lives in a magnificent lie
"Be happy" they said
You'd better throw stones
Seems easy to some to get that high
Sticks and stones break my bones

Words and sounds
Scabs and wounds
All the real and all the fake
Keep my hand for fuck's sake

Make it live, make it last, please
Make it live, make it last, please

Love
And sadness
Laughing
And shouts
Fears
Or waiting
Letters
And beliefs

Friends
Pain
Enemies
Or sex
Phone calls
The ocean
The sky
The infinity

Everything dies... dies
Everything dies... dies
Everything dies

Everything dies
Make it last, please
Make it live, make it last, please

Everything dies
Sparkle, sparkle
Just fades and explodes
Please reload
As fast as blinking eyes
Reload

Everything dies
