Under her nails, black shade eyes
Slowly torn here, undressed tantalize
We're not going to die, I promise
Drink the waves, sigh
Her hand, caress the flood
Like an orchestra, may the wind pull our scabs
The inner smell of your bra
We should run before she stabs
A girl's rude purity, a meat hook through you
Finally reach the wall we ran into
I hate your eternity

You wanna rule the world
You wanna rule my world

A narcotic wish I guess
Tonight, you'll be your own princess

Because the best way to know you miss someone is to sit next to her
And to know that she'll never be yours anymore

Because the best way to know you miss someone is to sit next to her
And to know that she'll never be yours anymore

Because the best way to know you miss someone is to sit next to her
And to know that she'll never be yours anymore

Because the best way to know you miss someone is to sit next to her
And to know that she'll never be yours anymore
