In his late teens
He felt so lost
He never told what he felt to anyone
He just took drugs and stayed indoors
Spared from the cancer-causing summer sun

At 21,he fell in love
With a brick wall and it set him back
The pain was great
His feelings' crushed
He smoked some hash to make it black

Long dark twenties
Long dark twenties
Long dark twenties
Long dark twenties

As he approached
His later years
The desperation took him by the throat

It choked him off
It choked him up
The feelings inside became so remote

He sized things up
He was dismayed
At how the years had flown by so fast

He had a future
He had a dream
But all he really wanted was to have a past

Long dark twenties
Long dark twenties
Long dark twenties
Long dark twenties

[instrumental break]

People admit
They've made mistakes
And hope that history will not repeat

They count their blessings
And pray for more
Hug their lovers and then go to sleep

He sleeps alone
He always has
And after all these years, it's not so bad

But there are mornings
He bolts awake
And he is overwhelmed by feeling sad

Long dark twenties
Long dark twenties
Long dark twenties
Long dark twenties
