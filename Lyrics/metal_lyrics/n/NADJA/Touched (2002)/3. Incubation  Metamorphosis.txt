Your fingers stretch webs across
My skin, entwine and enclose,
And wrap me within sticky
Strands of silk â the cocoon
Of your flesh â my incubation, metamorphosis
Beneath your hands, within your hands, as you spin
Your skein, shuttle my skin, shatter my spine
...and ...intoxicated â toxic â
I burst out of the ends of your fingers
Like a thousand blind larvae...
