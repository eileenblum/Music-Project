A culmination, conflagration of parasites,
inflammation of (the) senses â
sensory data now replacing what was, before,
was just date, just ones &amp; zeros in chains
of lifeless meaning â the infestation
breaks loose, spreads, &amp; at some point takes over â
bacteria grows on my circuits &amp; I learn how to feel â
at some point there is a break â at some point
there is a break â at some point a break â at some point
I break
