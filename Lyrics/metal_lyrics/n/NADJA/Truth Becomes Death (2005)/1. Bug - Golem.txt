You look into the night of my eyes
&amp; for a moment you might disappear
sink into the limitless depths
&amp; spiral away into emptiness
only for a moment â your knife hand
reaches up &amp; touches the alef
branding my forehead &amp; w/ a flick
of the blade it is removed â truth becomes death â
at some point truth
becomes death â &amp; I crumble
back into dust
