Reduced to subatomic particles
Leeching through your skin (I poison you)
I scrawl my initials
In your DNA and change you (as you change me)

Our shadows burn
Into each other's skin
(branded) and we are become
Our own shadows

We are become our own shadows

In the moment of ultra-light
When the fire burns black
And each and every second in the flame
We divide and sub-divide and
Each time a cell splits off we
Become a new flesh - a new flesh
A new self - a new self
Into infinity
