Wrapped in your broken limbs
My body desiccates, shrivels
And mummifies within the sepulchre
Of your embrace
Skin stretched so
Taut against my skeletal frame
My bones are like knives â
You cut your fingers on me, as you hold,
As you contain me â
And some liquid from your fingers leaks
And drips like amniotic fluid onto my skin and
Slowly I reconstitute
