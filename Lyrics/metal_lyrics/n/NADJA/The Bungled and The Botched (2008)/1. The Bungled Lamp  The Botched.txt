HAHAHAHAHAHA
You ever read any Nietzsche?

Nietzsche says there are two kinds of people in the world.
People who are destined for greatness...

...like Walt Disney...
...and Hitler.

And then there's the rest of us.

He called us "the bungled and the botched."
We get teased.
We sometimes get close to greatness...

...but we never get there.
We're the expendable masses.

We get pushed in front of trains, take poison aspirin...
...get gunned down in Dairy Queens.

It was no fucking picnic
You ever get the feeling sometimes...

...you're being punished for your sins?
He called us "The Bungled &amp; The Botched"...
