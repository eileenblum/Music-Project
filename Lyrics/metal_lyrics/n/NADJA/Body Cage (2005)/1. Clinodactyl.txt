An instant of blunt trauma â a word, a glance, a touch â the bruising touch of your fingers inside me and I feel my tendons and veins, ligaments and muscles calcifying within me.

I feel myself inside me as you hurt I feel myself inside turning into bone â every little touch, glance, word sinks into my skin, burrows within my flesh and digs its claws into me.

I feel you inside me, I feel the bones growing inside, cutting off all movement, curling my hands into claws, my feet into hooks and my spine straight as a sword through my back cutting me in half.

I know I feel you cutting me in half make two in me imprisoned in me as the bones grow, the bones grow inside me as I grow a second skeleton and gradually â a glance, a word, a touch â my body becomes my cage.
