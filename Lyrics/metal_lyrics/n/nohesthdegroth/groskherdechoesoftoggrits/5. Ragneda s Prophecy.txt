When a somber night
Of darkest shadows will falling
When the spark will be growingÂ 
And power of darkness will be rising

And demon-warriors of Nikron
Will raise their flags
AndÂ  attack with black cloud
But will be broken.

And revived Groskherd
Will be rising
With new force
And with new passion

And souls will be filled
With a victorious call
And hordes of immortals
Will break bounds of curse
And souls will be filled
With a victorious call
And spirits of despaired ones
Will be rescued

Fires of the callous ones
Will be drowningÂ  in darkness
One by one
Malicious cities will be falling

Satan the great will be
dethroned by Beheroght
In a last battle,
In a last fight.

He will not be saved
By gods or Azura demons
And body of the mortal king
Will be covered by eternal coffin
the world will be embraced by silence
Praise to gods, praise

And souls will be filled
With a victorious call
And hordes of immortals
Will break bounds of curse
And souls will be filled
With a victorious call
And spirits of despaired ones
Will be rescued
