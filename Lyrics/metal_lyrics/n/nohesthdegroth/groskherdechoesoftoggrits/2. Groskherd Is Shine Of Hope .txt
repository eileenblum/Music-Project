There is fire, there is flame burns
There are dead souls, voices of sinful
ThoseÂ  lands are blood-covered
There is the war unending

Cries and misery dwells around
Tortures of malicious demons
Dead mirrors of salvation
Cause blackness covers the faces

But shine of hope! Is here!
Groskherd will rise again!
But shine of hope! Is here!
And darkness saves the world!

But shine of hope! Is here!
Groskherd will rise again!
But shine of hope! Is here!
And darkness saves the world!

Groskheeeeeeeeeeerd!

The toggrit will come back, Demon of solitude
And flames of firesÂ  will grow
And darkened demons will gather
And flags will raise the spirits

Chains of evil will be broken
And Satan will fall in great battle
And black light of the sun
Will shine in underworld

As every toggrit knows
That power is throbbing in hearts
ThatÂ  fire burning in souls
To bring a peace into torrential

But shine of hope! Is here!
Groskherd will rise again!
But shine of hope! Is here!
And darkness saves the world!

But shine of hope! Is here!
Groskherd will rise!
But shine of hope! Is here again!
And darkness saves the world!
Groskheeeeeeeeeeerd!
