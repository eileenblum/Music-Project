War, that destroying borders
War, that ruin towns
That bornsÂ  a pain and suffering,
Destroying new dreams.

The land of dead creators
Is covered by shade of abandonment
Only shout of callous creature
On a distant horizon

This is voice of dead witch
This is voice that brings fear
All her acts on earthÂ 
Heartlessly cursed by destiny.

Heartlessnessâ¦ brings the painÂ 
By destroying essence of life
Heartlessnessâ¦ brings the fear
Destroying all morals
Heartlessneeeeessâ¦

No strength to break
The witches spell
The battle is over
The war is lost

Passions were bright like fire
But now the bodies covered by cold,
Soil drained the blood,
Black flowers grow

Just heartlessness around,
With darkness painted dreams
And every night in town
The dead wild shout is heard
The scream of heartlessness

Heartlessnessâ¦ brings the pain
By destroying essence of life
Heartlessnessâ¦ brings the fear
Destroying all morals
Heartlessneeeeessâ¦

Heartlessnessâ¦ broke the morality
By fire souls burned
Heartlessnessâ¦ froze the blood
Death takes the breath forever
Heartlessneeeeessâ¦
