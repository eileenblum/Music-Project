Life like a death
Flickering into eyes
Every breath (and every step)
Kills a part ofÂ  myself

Eternity is a part
OfÂ  life now
Vortex of annihilation
Merciless of chaos

The horrible games,
A nature of evil
Dead or alive
And perpetual hell inside

I call for you, god Esmu
Fill my soul with cold
Take away all my feelings
And fill me with a gloomy grey

I call for you, god Esmu,
To rise again in this world,
To fill a bowl with elixir
With a mystic lifeâ¦

Ruins, breath of emptiness
There is no life
And EsmuâsÂ  sculpture tear
Will fill the life with death

Suicide and misery
Flow into world of madness
Canât stop this wind
Wind of suffering

All is terrible, all is sad,
Spirit and body burned by
Flame of a bitter pain
Eyes covered with white veil.

I call for you, god Esmu
Fill my soul with cold
Take away all feelings, a lifeâ¦
And fill me with a gloomy grey

I call for you, god Esmu,
To rise again in this world,
To fill a bowl with elixir
With a mystic lifeâ¦
