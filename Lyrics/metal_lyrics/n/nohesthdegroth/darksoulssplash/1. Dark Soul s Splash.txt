Gloomy patterns, fading morning
Twinkles in my dying eyes
With the damned bloody dancing
Of the gloomy rotten beams

The rays reflect the shades of living
In this place beyond horizon
Whispers of water bring to myself
Wind from a dark abyss

Splash of the dark soul, splash of forgotten suffering
Splash of a rising moon, splash!

Stream, oppression
Depression interspersed
With vicious evil forms
Philosophy of life irritation

Mind is broken into smallest
Pieces of mirrors all around me
And a silence touches windows
Drawings of murderers bloody dreams

Splash of the dark soul, splash of forgotten suffering
Splash of a rising moon, splash!

Can not hide, hide inside
Dark evil forms born by mind
They are far they are in
Like dark soul's ghosts

Flight from here is impossible
Hard-maze filled paths of soul
And finding myself and opening up my way
It will remain a dream of imagination
