I am here again
when the day is done 
I'm back again
to steal your life 
and I won't go away
Tonight's the night to die 
you can try to run
but you will die
The end end is near 
look at me 
you'll feel the fear

I'm your Master,
Emperor, the King
I will always rule your night
You must run faster 
the death is in the ring
Staring right into your eyes

[chorus]
I'll take away your life
and end your pain inside
I wan't to die with you, like you
I am the deadly stalker
I am the Midnight Walker
the one you try to hide
Now say your life goodbye
[chorus]

I'm the shadow behind you 
that you can't see
but you know it's there
The day is rising 
and I'm fading away
Daytime has made you free 
but only for today
Dusk is falling 
and once again 
I'm in your head

I'm your nightmare, 
fantasy and insanity
Only thing you see 
death will make you free
So walk a little closer 
and give your life to me
Let me end your pain

[chorus]
I'll take away your life
and end your pain inside
I wan't to die with you, like you
I am the deadly stalker
I am the Midnight Walker
the one you try to hide
Now say your life goodbye
[chorus]

[chorus]
I'll take away your life
and end your pain inside
I wan't to die with you, like you
I am the deadly stalker
I am the Midnight Walker
the one you try to hide
Now say your life goodbye
[chorus]
