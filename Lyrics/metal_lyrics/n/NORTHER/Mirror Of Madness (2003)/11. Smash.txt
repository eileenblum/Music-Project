[Japanese version only]

[Offspring cover]

Head over heals I've fit in before
Now I don't wanna do it no more
I've held it all in with blood on my face
Built it up man so bad you can taste
I don't slag no one
I don't even judge
Don't give a shit 'cause I'm not gonna budge
I just want to be who I want to be
Guess that's hard for others to see

[Chorus]
I'm not a trendy asshole
I Do what I want
I Do what I feel like
I'm not a trendy asshole
Don't give a fuck 
If it's good enough for you
Cause I am alive

Smash is the way you feel all alone
Like an outcast you're out on your own
Smash is the way you deal with your life
Like an outcast you're smashing your strife

Head over heels I've fit in before
Now I don't want to do it no more
I just want to be who I want to be
Guess that's hard for others to see

[Chorus]
