Closed around
the deepening shades of death 
and life 
with all its glory fades away
no glory there has ever been in 
life obscure

life deceiving
death revealing

Like trapped in a cage, 
we're bound to death
slaves to our bodies, 
from cradle to the grave
abandoned, 
in the arms of a plague
All efforts in vain, 
life is pain
reaching the truth, 
death is the proof
...reveals the truth

[chorus]
Everything is an end
Everything is an end
love lost 
life fading away
suffer in truth
[chorus]

Under the gun 
love and life 
lost, 
shiver in darkness surrounding
no love there has ever been, 
here, in the nest of disease

life deceiving 
death revealing

[solo: J.Koskinen]
[solo: K.Ranta]

Like trapped in a cage,
we're bound to death
slaves to our bodies, 
from cradle to the grave
abandoned, 
in the arms of a plague
All efforts in vein, 
life is pain
reaching the truth, 
death is the proof
...reveals the truth

[chorus]
Everything is an end
Everything is an end
love lost 
life fading away
suffer in truth
[chorus]

...life is a deathtrip
