You're seeking perfection, 
but your disillusions are 
leading to destruction
You're bleeding for salvation, 
but you can't see, 
that you are the damnation, 
itself.

Your hatred's growing on 
it's growing strong 
and the devil's born
releasing poison to a mind 
which is already torn
last days of innocence 
now waste your self 
have no regrets
tomorrow it's too late 
you'll lose your soul 
you'll burn in hell

[chorus]
how many years will you bleed
so many devils to feed
how long time to suffer 
...is eternity
[chorus]

[solo: K.Ranta]
[solo: P.Lindroos]

Disease is moving on 
it's spreading on 
it's getting strong
black harmony tonight 
too late to leave 
too late to hide
cold wind which blows inside 
can tell the truth you lost, 
you died
the final ride is here 
you'll see the truth 
shall have no fear

[chorus]
how many years will you bleed
so many devils to feed
how long time to suffer 
...is eternity
[chorus]

[solo: T.Planman]

[chorus]
how many years will you bleed
so many devils to feed
how long time to suffer 
...is eternity

how many years have you been
blackhearted and mean
no rest for your soul 
there will be no divinity
[chorus]
