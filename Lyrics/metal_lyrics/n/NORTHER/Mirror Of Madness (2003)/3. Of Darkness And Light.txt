Gather 'round in the main square
come tonight my child
see the end of a sinful life
the end of mischievous lies

So I went among the crowd
the whispers cursed her name
Then through the people's frantic shout
she was brought to be tested by the flame

[chorus]
And I saw her smile
as the flames rose
She looked up to the sky
and the air froze
Something in her eyes
[chorus]

Too much for the narrow minds
condemned as an evil whore
She didn't mind, 'cause deep inside
she had reached something more

[chorus]
And I saw her smile
as the flames rose
She looked up to the sky
and the air froze
Something in her eyes
of darkness and light
[chorus]

[solo: P.Lindroos]
[solo: K.Ranta]
[solo: T.Planman]

[chorus]
And I saw her smile
as the flames rose
I looked into her eyes
I saw that she knows
things beyond this life
Of Darkness and Light
[chorus]
