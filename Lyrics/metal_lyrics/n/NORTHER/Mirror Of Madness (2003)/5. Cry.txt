Your words echoing deep in my mind
Fearing the hurt of things to come
you dwell in the days left behind

To live or die
Wandering the strange ways of time
Life can go by in a blink of an eye
and minutes can hold you 
for thousands of years 
or never let go

[chorus]
The light is gone now
once so bright
No use to fight
you will fall down
to your knees
Cry
[chorus]

Your search has brought you nothing but pain
Looking for light with blindfolded eyes
you only got burned by the flame
Can't take another day

[solo: T.Planman]

[chorus]
The light is gone now
once so bright
No use to fight
you will fall down
to your knees
Cry
[chorus]

[chorus]
The light is gone now
once so bright 
Crushed in the cold hands 
with no meaning
beautiful things 
can be easily broken
Cry
[chorus]
