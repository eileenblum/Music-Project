One morning I woke up, 
realised I've been betrayed
shadows of yesterday 
fill my mind as I drift away
no matter what's ahead. 
I'll face the death 
I'll find my hate
this twisted fate I have 
shall lead the way 
and make you brake 

One night I went to die, 
deceived again, 
I was ready to fly
thousand blades waiting for me, 
so fuck you all, 
I was meant to be free
my hate was cheating me, 
is this the path, 
I cannot see
too many bridges burned, 
can't you see I am the traitor

[chorus]
would you die for my hate now
burning in my eyes, 
burning me inside.
I guess I now have to cut you
while lying by your side, 
I'm out of my mind
[chorus] 

[solo: P.Lindroos]

this time the conspiracy, 
in your mind went out of line
no more forgiving, 
close your eyes 
I'll help you to die
in the night I am beside you, 
weird voices in my mind
you're asleep and I love you, 
but more than thousand times I cut you

[chorus]
would you die for my hate now
burning in my eyes, 
burning me inside
I guess I now have to cut you
while lying by your side, 
I'm out of my mind!
[chorus]

that night I took your life 
and now this traitor dies
and so he died...
