There's pain within, 
I can't define
Inside, within, inside, 
illhealthy I feel

[chorus]
When your inmost yields
and you fall 
deeper and deeper into grief
for each breath you take
[chorus]

Dark dresses my pale skin
cold shivers down my spine
I have lost hope 
of loving a day of life
Faith
has fallen from me
I'm rotting inside
Fear
sickening conditions
frightening reflections
...feeling divine!!!

...so dim the light in me...
...no nothing...
...all ending...

[solo: P.Lindroos &amp; K.Ranta]

Sleeping well in my killing bed
staring blind around - 
Am I slipping away?
In the hollow decorating my grave
begging please...
disconnect the pain

[chorus]
When you're going blind 
from your tears 
and you wander deeper 
and deeper into sorrow
for each step you take
And your feet won't carry 
you no more
and you sink deeper 
and deeper into misery
and you'll soon be...dead
[chorus]

...so dim the light in me...
...no nothing...
...all ending...
