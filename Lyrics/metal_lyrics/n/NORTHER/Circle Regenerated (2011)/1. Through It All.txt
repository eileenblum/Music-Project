[Music: K. Ranta / Lyrics: A. Sihvonen]

Far past the time of my own time
I realized I was going wrong
This night, this fight, will change my life
All I know will be like it was
Unlike the lies you could make me see
This life is a fight I will survive

Soaring high
Through it all
Burning bridges made me stronger than you all

[Solo: K. Ranta]

All things are made and broken
Still I havenât found what broke me down
This night, this fight, will fix my life

Soaring high
Through it all
Burning bridges made me stronger than you all
Drawing lines
Circle-wise
Burning bridges made me stronger than you all
I will remember, I canât forget
You will remember, I canât forget
You will remember, you canât forget

[Solo:  D. Freyberg]
