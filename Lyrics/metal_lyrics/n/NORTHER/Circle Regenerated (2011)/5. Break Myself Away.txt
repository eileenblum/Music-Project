[Music:  D. Freyberg / Lyrics:  A. Sihvonen]

You treat me like I shouldnât say whatâs on my mind
Like I had no soul at all
You and your ideas of life and ways to live
Lead you to certain way to fall

I stand burning in the shadows
I stand waiting for my own chance
I will break myself away

[Solo:  D. Freyberg]

Now itâs the time to scream aloud and speak my mind
So itâs my turn to give you hell
Kneel and heed my words of wisdom and of pain
They will sanctify my life

I stand burning in the shadows
I stand waiting for my own chance
I will break myself away

I stand burning in the shadows
I stand waiting for my own chance
I know it all I know by far
I will break myself away

I stand burning in the shadows
I stand waiting for my own chance
I know it all I know by far
I will break myself away

I stand burning in the shadows
I stand waiting for my own chance
I know it all I know by far
I will break myself away

[Solo:  D. Freyberg, K. Ranta, D. Freyberg, K. Ranta]
