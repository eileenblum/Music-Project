[Music:  K. Ranta / Lyrics:  K. Ranta]

One day we met, long time ago,
You held my hand, showed me to life
And time went by, sun in the sky
So calm so quiet, before the storm

One day we met, long time ago
You forced my soul, showed me to hate
So time went by, hatred in my heart I lived
So black so vile, in the eye of the storm

Kill me for the hate I bear
Burning inside me, spreading around me
Hate me now for who I am, you donât know me
Donât even try to

One day weâll meet, not far away
The pain you caused, showed me to life
One day you will realize, what you have done
So wait and see, what I have become

Kill me for the hate I bear, burning inside me,
Spreading around me
Hate me now for who I am, you donât know me,
Donât even try to

[Solo:  K. Ranta, D. Freyberg]
