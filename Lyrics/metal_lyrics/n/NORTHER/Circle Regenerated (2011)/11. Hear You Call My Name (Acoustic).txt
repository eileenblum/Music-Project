[Bonus Track]Hey girl, you are lost in the dark,
Hey you, there's nowhere to go,
Hey girl, I don't know what to do,
Hurts me so to say, that I cannot be there for you

And I hear you call my name,
I hear you cry again, in the dark,
Hear you call my name, 
And I hear you cry again, in the dark.

Hey girl, there's so much to say, to you,
Hey you, but I just cannot say anything,
Hey girl, there's so much to do,
But I just cannot, be the one for you, be the one for you,

And I hear you call my name,
I hear you cry again, in the dark,
Hear you call my name,
And I'll hear you cry again, in the dark.

And I hear you call my name,
I hear you cry again, in the dark,
Hear you call my name,
And I hear you cry again, in the dark,

Hear you call my name,
I hear you cry again, in the dark.
Hear you call my name,
I hear you cry again, in the dark.
