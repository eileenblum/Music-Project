[Bonus Track][originally by Lambretta]Who's she blowing kisses from the catwalk
Tell me, I really gotta know
Since when did you need another girlfriend
since when, I really gotta know
I really gotta know

She's been faking since day one
a friendly kiss includes no tongue
Who's she, tell me
Now she's sleeping in my bed
Oh God I wish that she was dead
I need to know
Who's that bimbo

Who's she looking goofy in a Gucci dress
what's that , I really gotta know
Which bone in her body should I break first
which one, the bimbo's gotta go
the bimbo's gotta go

She's been faking since day one
a friendly kiss includes no tongue
Who's she, tell me
Now she's sleeping in my bed
Oh God I wish that she was dead
I need to know
Who's that bimbo

I know it's sad
sometimes I just lose my head
boy I'm getting so mad
I know it's sad
sometimes I just lose my head

I know it's sad
sometimes I just lose my head
boy I'm getting so mad
I know it's sad
sometimes I just lose my head

She's been faking since day one
a friendly kiss includes no tongue
Who's she, tell me
Now she's sleeping in my bed
Oh God I wish that she was dead
I need to know

She's been faking since day one
a friendly kiss includes no tongue
Who's she, tell me
Now she's sleeping in my bed
Oh God I wish that she was dead
I need to know

Now she's sleeping in my bed
Oh God I wish that she was dead
I need to know
Who's that bimbo
