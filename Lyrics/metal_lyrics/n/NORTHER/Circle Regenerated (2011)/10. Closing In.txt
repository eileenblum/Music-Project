[Music: J.Koskinen / D.Freyberg Lyrics: A.Sihvonen]

Again is the moment when life is expanding to point of
Exploding (and) forbidding your breathing.
Grasp for the thought of your everyday dying and live fast
These moments of lacking all trying

I will not say what I would do

I have failed
I'm going under, I'm pulling in
I can't escape
These walls are closing in

Holding the last thought when mind is expanding to point
Where the darkness is blending emotions and fading volition.
I will not end my fight.
I will not lose my mind.

I have failed
I'm going under, I'm pulling in
I can't escape
These walls are closing in

I'm going under, I'm pulling in
These walls are closing in

I have failed
I'm going under, I'm pulling in
I can't escape
These walls are closing in

[Solo: T.Planman, D.Freyberg]

I have failed
I'm going under, I'm pulling in
I can't escape
These walls are closing in on me
