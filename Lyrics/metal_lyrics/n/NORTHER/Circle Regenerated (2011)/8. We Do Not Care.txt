[Music: D.Freyberg / Lyrics: A.Shivonen]

Falling out from the tight lined system
Where clarity is hidden
Searching for the mind that will listen
Whose clarity is wisdom

Fall into night, stay by my side

We've seen it all
We've heard before
We do not care
I do not care
We've seen it all
Just won't let go

I couldn't see what your minds had made for me
All this time
All my life
I couldn't heed these fucking lies all my life

Fall into night, stay by my side

I've closed my eyes from their little lies

We've seen it all
We've heard before
We do not care
I do not care
We've seen it all
Just won't let go

[Solo: D. Freyberg, K.Ranta, D. Freyberg]
