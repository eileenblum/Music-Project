[Music: A. Shivonen / Lyrics: A. Shivonen]

I know how to strain a man's will to live
I know how to force death down you
I know what it takes to cross the line
I know what it costs to lose your mind again

'Cause life inside of me
Is filled with things you can't imagine
'Cause life inside of you
Is only there because of my will

I don't live for your sake
I live for truth
I will give last bits of hope
I will give a truth

You try to make your way through the days
You think you affect your own life
You're not what you think you are, you'll never be
You life is mine. You're mine forevermore

[Solo: K.Ranta, D.Freyberg]
