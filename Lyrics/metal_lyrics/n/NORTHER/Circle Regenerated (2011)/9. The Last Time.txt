[Music: K.Ranta / Lyrics: A.Shivonen]

I will never find my way out of this deadhead
I am so eager to leave I'd myself behind
Yes, I would leave myself behind
Sometimes I think I already have done
What I didn't mean to

This time, this time's the last time
I'm diving from the sky again
This time, this time's the last time
I'm bleeding from the stars again

I just cannot pull myself away from this massacre
I am just part of all bad seeds and infantile disaster
Yes, I would leave myself behind
Sometimes I think I already have left myself behind

This time, this time's the last time
I'm diving from the sky again
This time, this time's the last time
I'm bleeding from the stars again
