[Music:  J. Koskinen / Lyrics:  A. Sihvonen]

Sometimes I find myself behind your doors
Iâm bleeding my soul as I pass on to nothing
Iâve made myself to believe in something that is nothing
Iâve made my way to deceive myself among the others,
And you always said

I will come for you
I will say whatâs true
Iâve waited my time
I will come for you

Iâve made myself to believe in something that is nothing
Iâve made myself to believe in you

Should I choose either way, shame or guilt of being me
And you always said...

I will come for you
I will say whatâs true
Iâve waited my time
I will come for you

Iâve been waiting for this moment
Should I believe in something

Iâve been waiting for you so long
And you always said...
