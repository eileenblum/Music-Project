[Music: K.Ranta / Lyrics: K.Ranta]

Long ago, when the days were bright in our world
Long before the end of days and sunset

I lived for you, in the days of the light, in our world
long before the heaven came down

Your eyes used to shine for me, like the stars

Tonight I'm falling away from you, I'm falling away
Tonight I'm falling away from you, there's nothing to do

Long ago, in the days we shared and cherished
Long before the end of our love
I lived for you, in the days of the light, in our world
Long before the end of our time

Your eyes used to shine for me, like the stars

Tonight I'm falling away from you, I'm falling away
Tonight I'm falling away from you, there's nothing to do

[Solo: K.Rante]
