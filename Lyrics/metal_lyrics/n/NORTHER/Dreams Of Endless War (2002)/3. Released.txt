I have come to the point where there is no return
I'm losing my mind and my heart will burn
This fear inside is eating me alive again
Left alone I'm not gonna stay. No fucking way

WHEN I CUT MYSELF AND LAUGH AT YOU ALL
I AM THE RELEASED ONE, NOW MY BLOOD STREAMS ON THE FLOOR
THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT ANYMORE WHEN I REACHED FOR YOU
YOU DIDN'T CARE EVEN THEN, NOW THE BELLS ARE CALLING FOR YOU

I've been walking in the shadows already for so long
Don't know the difference between what is right or wrong
There is nothing to be done anymore to prevent my demise
The rope is around my neck meaning that I'm gonna die

WHEN I HANG MYSELF AND LAUGH AT YOU ALL
I AM THE RELEASED ONE AND MY SPIRIT WALKS OUT OF THE DOOR
THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT ANYMORE WHEN I REACHED FOR YOU
YOU DIDN'T CARE EVEN THEN, NOW THE BELLS ARE CALLING FOR YOU
