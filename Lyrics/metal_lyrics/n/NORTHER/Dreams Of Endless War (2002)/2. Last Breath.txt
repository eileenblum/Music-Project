Again he sees the end it's light that blinds his eyes
Creatures of the night are calling him to darkness
To die for the glory and to be brave silent tears slowly running down
The darkness is here it has killed the light. Only one more war to fight

LAST BREATH WAS TAKEN NOW IN THE DARK OF THE NIGHT
COLD KISS OF DEATH WILL END THIS WAR
SILENCE IS THERE WHEN THE WARRIOR IS DYING
LAST BREATH WAS TAKEN WHEN HE DIED

Again he feels the breeze, it haunts him forevermore
There is no time to waste when he sees the stormy sky
Today is the day of war, today I'm longing to die
On this ice of eternity norther kills the light
