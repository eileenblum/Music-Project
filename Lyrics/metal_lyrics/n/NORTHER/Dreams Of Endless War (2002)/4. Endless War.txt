With my heart black as the night I feel no pain while I kill
Blood runs warm as I fight against you
In my dreams I have seen the light but it is fading away:
The souls I curse haunt me forever 'cause there's no light
I hate myself now in the dark
When the sky turns black and there is no light in sight
I come from the dark to tear your heart apart

I AM A FUCKING NIGHTMARE
I AM THE SHADOW
THERE IS NO TURNING BACK WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN MY EYES
I HAVE TRIED TO STOP BUT IT'S TOO LATE NOW
EVERYWHERE IT IS JUST ENDLESS WAR

With my heart black as the night I feel no pain when I die
Blood runs warm as I fight against you
In my dreams I have seen the light, but it is fading away
My mind is filled with endless sorrow
The light that used to shine so bright is no more alive
When I walk through this dream I see the light
No way to escape this fucking reality of mine
With my eyes black as my blood I see the approaching death
The souls I curse haunt me forever
When the sky turns black and there isn o light in sight
I come from the dark to tear your heart apart

I won again but is this the way
Now I am leaving, leaving for good
To rest in eternal peace
