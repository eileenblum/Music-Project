Again I see the shadows crawling in my mind
I try to run but I can't hide
This endless war inside me has torn my heart apart
My mind's vengeance will be so sweet

AGAIN I'M ON THE RUN TO KILL THE PAIN INSIDE ME
I AM THE ONE WHO CRIES IN THE DARK ALONE
HEARING VOICES, I HAVE TO KILL THOSE EVIL MEMORIES
YOU DON'T KNOW, BUT YOU HAVE TO DIE BESIDE ME

The night is here and I'm close to you, 
there is a question for you to answer
Will you be with me forever 
or will you die, just for me

I'm free 'cause you chose to die 
but it won't change a thing
The fire in our souls has died away
My heart is evil and I have this lust to kill you

We are together in death and so it shall be
With my heart I see the flames again they are there for me
With my evil memories 
I burn in misery

I know there's a sorrow around you but time will heal
I told you a lie that I could never die

The night is here and I'm close to you,
there's a question for you to answer
Will you be with me forever 
or will you die, just for me
