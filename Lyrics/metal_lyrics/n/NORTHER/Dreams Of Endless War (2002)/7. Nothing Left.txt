I am all alone in this pitch-black night
All my dreams in vain
I am the one who lost the fight
Black shadows around me, no hope, no light left inside

Heartless I am, it's time to cut, bleed and die

ALL THIS SORROW INSIDE ME TURNS TO HATE
I'LL HAVE MY REVENGE NOW
I WON'T WASTE ANOTHER DAY
THERE'S NO USE IN DENYING OUR LOVE
I HAVE TO GO TONIGHT, 
I WILL FLY AWAY

Now we are together beyond the gates in eternity
I hold your hand as we drown together in this sea
There's no angels to guide our way
We are lost forever, the pain inside won't fade away
