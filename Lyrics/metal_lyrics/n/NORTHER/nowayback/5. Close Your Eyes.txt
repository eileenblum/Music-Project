Your guilt bleeds through
Your eyes it's true
There's no way out
Your mouth is full
Of your lies in disguise
You walk away you turn away
You run away you fade away
Wash your sins away, scratch your skin away, bleed your soul away
But you won't escape, cry your pain away, clean your stains away
Close your eyes today, but you won't escape, there's no hope today
Feeling has gone away, darkness is here to stay, and you can't escape
There's no me today, myself has gone away, darkness in me to stay
And I can't escape

No way out
Close your eyes deny it all
Close your eyes and you will fall
One way out
Open your eyes see it all
open your eyes admit it all
