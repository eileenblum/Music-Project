Where have you gone I can't see you
What's going on I can't feel you
Come back wherever you are
Come back just follow the star
What can I do I can't hear you
Where do I have to go to find you
Where are you now
Where are you now

Reach out to my hand
And I will pull you into the light
Hold on to my hand
And you shall never fall again

Fear is keeping you where I can not come
Tear your fears, Let them go with tears
