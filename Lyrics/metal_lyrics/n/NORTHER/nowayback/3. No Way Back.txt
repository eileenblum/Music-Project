I no longer feel where do my heart belong
This shivering wind has frozen it to the core
And the rain that whips my face covers my tears
These dark shades of night hide my fears
There's no way, no way back
Wherever I'm walking

I hide behind my smile
And it hurts me inside
I cry without shedding a tear
I'm sorry this ends here

Still the wind blows and the rain falls on me
And I know there's no way back, no way back
Forever I'm walking
