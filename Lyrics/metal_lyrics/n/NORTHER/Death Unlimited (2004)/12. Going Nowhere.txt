[Music: Ranta, Planman and Lindroos]
[Lyrics: Ranta]

Soon I will lose my sanity
That day I will set you free
And I don't care
On the road to nowhere

Soon my scythe will lose it's sanity
That day will set you free
And my scythe doesn't care
On the road to nowhere

When I will lose my integrity
My gun will set me free
But that won't happen yet
Cos everyone ain't yet dead

Today I found my vanity
Today I'll make you bleed
Stain your walls with blood
You'll have your meeting with god

Hate keeps me going
Going Nowhere
With death I'm running
Crawling to get there

Hate keeps me running
Running somwhere
Inside I'm smiling
Waiting to be dead

[Solo: Lindroos]
[Solo: Planman]
[Solo: Ranta]

Hate keeps me running
Running somwhere
Inside I'm smiling
Waiting to be dead
