[Music: Ranta, Planman and Lindroos]
[Lyrics: Planman]

Now there's no denying
Veiled in grey no more
The time has come to see
You've already fallen too deep

To rise again, would never be the same
Long gone, the days nightfall upon you

To rise, to fall, to waste away
The blessed can find it all the same
Not to see, not to wonder
As all is torn asunder

Questions never asked, faces forever masked
Your fate is to unfold, in places far below

A Fallen Star is what you are
Forever scarred in heaven
A Fallen Star is what you are
And you have come so far
