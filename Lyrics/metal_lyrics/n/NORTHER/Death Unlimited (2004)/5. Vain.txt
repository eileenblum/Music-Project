[Music: Koskinen and Planman]
[Lyrics: Koskinen]

You have told a thousand lies
Told then a thousand times
Your words just create lies
No one will symphathize

Recognize that trust in you has died
You just don't realize 'cause you're dead inside

Maliciously you deceive, cunningness as your, salvation
Broken promises you've made, empty words you've said
You care for none but your own, just for your own
The nothing you've become!, the nothing you've become

My anger is aimed at you
Eternally I hate you
My rage is aimed at you
I really love to hate you

You are straying
Been excelling in failing
You fake it, mistake it

Can't stand the ways you mess with your life
Can't stand the person you've become
You're living in a life, there's nothing inside

Maliciously you deceive, cunningness as your, salvation
Broken promises you've made, empty words you've said
You care for none but your own, just for your own
The nothing you've become, the nothing you've become
