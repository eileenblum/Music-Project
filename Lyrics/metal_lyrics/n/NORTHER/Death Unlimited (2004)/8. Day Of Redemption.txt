[Music: Ranta, Planman and Lindroos]
[Lyrics: Ranta]

Today is the day that I've been waiting for
The day to die the day to walk through the door
I have come to an end, passed the gates of no return
If I end up in hell surely I will burn

On this Day of Redemption I've decided to forgive myself
all this pain will soon be gone
I open myself and let my blood dye the floor
Death arrives with a smile

Today is the day, the day that I have feared so long
The day to leave, and to pay for what is done wrong
I have come to the sea, to drown, to finally be free,
Slowly I descent into darkness, fall into the deep,
Feel the pleasure

[Solo: Lindroos]
[Solo: Ranta]

On this Day of Redemption I've decided to forgive myself
All this pain will soon be gone
I open myself and let my blood dye the floor
Death arrives with a smile

And on this Day of Redemption I've decided to die
All this shit will soon be gone
Now I've bled dry the room's a mess
But I have been forgiven
