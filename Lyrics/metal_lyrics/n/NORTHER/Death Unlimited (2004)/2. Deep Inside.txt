[Music: Ranta, Planman and Lindroos]
[Lyrics: Ranta]

Tieng my own noose, digging my own grave
They told me to do it before it is too late
Pale faces in the night told me the truth about life
They told me facts that I could not deny

Picking flowers for my own funeral
Building the coffin to sleep in
Sharpening the blade to slash my own throat
Loading the gun to blow my head off

Twisted faces in (my dream)
Screaming out their (hatred)
Ill-being (inside me)
Will they never leave me be

Gloomy figures in (my mind)
Crying out their (despair)
These parasites in (my head)
Will never set me free

Peeling my own skin, looking inside, Deep Inside
Searching for something, that lies inside
Deep Inside, in my mind
Pale faces in disquise, told the lies, in my mind
Warned me about that day, which would arrive in time

[Solo: Lindroos]
[Solo: Planman]
[Solo: Ranta]

Screaming like hell in my own inner cell
Blood so gently flowing down
Hurting myself to wake up from this dream
Or is it so mindless coz it's real

[Solo: Lindroos]
[Solo: Planma]
[Solo: Ranta]
