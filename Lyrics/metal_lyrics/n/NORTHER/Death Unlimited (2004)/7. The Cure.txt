[Music: Ranta, Lindroos and Planman]
[Lyrics: Ranta]

We have gathered here tonite to spend some time
With our demons, those evil beings in your minds
We have found The Cure for all our troubles
So free your mind and let it go

Take a step to the other side of divinity
Get closer to feel the infinity
Let the poison fill you with it's equity
Soon all will change to what it should always be

Twisted faces all within me
Constant laughter that no one hears
Secret places waiting for me
I'm slowly dying with these fears

I have come here tonite to spend some time
With my own puzzles, those little pieces
Of my broken mind
I have found The Cure for all my troubles
So I free my mind and let it flow

Kill your worries tonite
Run away there's no time

Take a step to the other divinity
Get closer to feel the infinity
Let the poison fill you with it's equity
Soon all will change to what it should always be

Twisted faces all within me
Constant laughter that no one hears
Secret places waiting for me
I'm slowly dying with these fears

Evil places all inside me
Constant screaming that no one hears
Bad times waiting for me
I'm already dead can't you see
