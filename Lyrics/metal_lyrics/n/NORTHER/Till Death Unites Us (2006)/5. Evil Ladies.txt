They are the devils on earth, high heels and little black skirt
They live just for pure pleasure
They are the dolls of doom, black eyes like shine of the moon
They kill just for pure pleasure

Evil they seem those ladies, evil we like our ladies
Evil they are those ladies, evil we want our ladies

They are the cats indeed, their touch is all you need
They live just for pure pleasure
They are the girls of fire, they know the game of desire
They kill just for pure pleasure
