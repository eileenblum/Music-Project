Now it's too late to change the fate
To change the way, the time is out
Way too soon you had to go away
Why so soon you had to fly away
The guilt, The pain burning like a flame
The pain we feel too bad it's so real
Feelings of shame ourselves we blame
Throughout the years speaking to deaf ears

So many years waiting
So many years now crying
For you
