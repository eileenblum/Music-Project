The sun is gone, come here darkness come
With me to see into the deep, to scream to dream
Of things I can't believe
My fate is to decay, to rot in this grave, alone to try in vain
To rise again to see another day, to live again to see another day

Too late to try, the end in sight die to see another day
Too late to cry, for peace of mind, die to see another day

Grasping the blade, die to see another day
To strike a vein, die to see another day
Tomorrow's not the day, I wanna see so I'll be on my way
To see what's beyond
