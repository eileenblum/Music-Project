Now it's done, now it's through
The world hates me I know
Now I'm out, now I'm done
They are staring at me I know
Sad and true without you
Feeling inside is cruel
Reflection, Deflection
Picture inside is addle

Scream, scream out my heart
Scream, Scream it out tonight

Now it's gone, now it's true
Alone in the world I know
Still I'm sad still it feels bad
No one's waiting I know
Sad but true without you
Good times in my mind
Oppression affliction
Scene inside is getting better
