You're on holiday from your thoughts, to live another day in the clouds
In denial you refuse to see, a betreyal and you blame me
We are all going insane, oh yes!
You are definitely going insane, oh yes!

Drowning, can't you see you're going
Under, can't you see you're fading

I'm on holiday in your thoughts, to die another day in the dark
In denial I refuse to see, a betreyal and they all blame me
