Everything I had is gone and all I cared is dead
There's nothing to lean on, there's nothing to hold on
Now all is said and done left behind like a dream
There's nowhere to go nowhere to go to
I thought I had it all...

You were everything in my heart and my heart still beats, these empty beats
You were everything in my heart and my heart will go on, without you

You took it all, all away, left me there, there to stay
Feeling so cold now I'm on my own now
Why should I live my life anymore
You are gone and I lost it all
There's nothing to lean on, nothing to hold on
Still I have to carry on, carry on and on
There's nowhere to go to, nowhere to go to
I'll hope this pain will fade away, fade away some day
There's nothing to live for, there's nothing to die for
