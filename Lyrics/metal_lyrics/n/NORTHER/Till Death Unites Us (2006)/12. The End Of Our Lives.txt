In this place tattered and torn there's
Nothing to hold on to
The end has been in sight for so long
Nothing is going to change it I know
No hope is left anymore

Our days are running out
The voices scream
To let us now it's time to die
And just let it be
Reaching the end of the rope
Running out of hope
Now it's time to die
This is the end of our lives

[Solo: P. Lindroos]

Nothing's gonna save this world
It's slipping through our fingers
Trapped in this downward spiral destroying all
We're marching the path to oblivion
The end is coming now for all

[Solo: K. Ranta]
