Cruising in the altitude of minus 6 feet
Sleeping in the bed of broken dreams
Walking on the same streets of forgotten needs
Floating in the sea of blackened deeds
This life is here see it now, face your fear
No matter who you are you gotta figh for your world
This day is here live it now, face your fear
No matter who you are you gotta try you gotta try

We are alone in the end, all alone
You are alone in the end, so alone

We're all made of broken dreams
Lost is hope and still we bleed
We're all a part of a broken scene
Fate is cruel and so we bleed
