You know nothing about us
You think that we're not cool
You say we got nothing to give
We just say... Fuck you
We don't care about your thoughts
We will hate you anyway
You're just a piece of shit
We take no shit from no one

Fuck you, you're just a piece of shit
Fuck you, we take no shit

We take no shit from no one
You can say what ever you dare
It's all the same cos we don't care
