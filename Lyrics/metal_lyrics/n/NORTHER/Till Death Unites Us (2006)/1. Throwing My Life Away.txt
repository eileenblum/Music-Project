I've been destroyed by the perfection that is you
Telling me your lies, think you can fool me too
Fuck you! I'm leaving soon

Why the hell should I stay, getting nowhere day by day
Can't stand what you say, throwing my life away

Dead as a dead can be, screaming the pain away, that you spread to me
Another dead day with you, I see, you have turned to my perfect enemy

Why the hell should I stay, getting nowhere day by day
Can't stand what you say, throwing my life away
Why the hell do I stay, falling further down day by day
This is more than I can take, throwing my life away

[Solo: P. Lindroos]
[Solo: K. Ranta]

Throwing my life away, no way I won't stay
Throwing my life away, can't stand your fucking ways
Throwing my life away, you fucking disappoint me
Throwing my life away, throwing my life away
