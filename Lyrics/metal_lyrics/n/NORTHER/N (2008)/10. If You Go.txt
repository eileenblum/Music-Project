[Kride]
Now that I know
Now that I've heard the others
It would hurt to let it go
to let it sweep away

Your eyes, your soul in me
Your eyes, your soul in me

Now that I've seen
Now that I've heard the chance
It would kill to let it go
to let it die away

Now that it's real
Now that it makes a difference
It would crush to lose you
I would die to save this feeling

[Pete]
If you go
I don't know what to do
If you go
I don't know where to be

[Kride]
Your eyes, your soul in me
Your eyes, your soul in me

[Pete]
YEAH!

If you go
I don't know what to do
If you go
I don't know where to be
