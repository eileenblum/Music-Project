[Music: Koskinen / Lyrics: Koskinen]

The one, the where, the why
The one from a perfect world,
a world that threw me away
I turned my eyes to see it all,
to give you what you're looking for
that day, that day to run away

The one, the where you're here with me
You know my name
but will it ever,
ever be the same?

My heart feels broken as I'm lying here.
My thoughts are choking 'cause of you, my dear
When everything of meaning disappears

[Chorus:]
Lives in a lie, away forever
Always and never will be together
They all that's left alone
becomes a heart of stone

Always and never longing for you
Always and never being true

The one, the where, the why
The one for a perfect world,
The world that threw me away

My eyes open, now in the world I see
It was a dream referring to how shit I feel
Thank you for wandering,
In the most precious world I've seen

[Chorus]

Always, never on my mind
Always, never you are mine

[Jukka's bass solo]
[Tuomas' synth, Kride's and Petri's guitar solo]
[Jukka's bass solo]

[Chorus]

Always, never, said I'm done
Always, always, change my mind
Always, never, being true
I'll always love you!

Always and never!
