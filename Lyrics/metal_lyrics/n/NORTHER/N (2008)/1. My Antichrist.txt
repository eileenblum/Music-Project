Deeper I should look,
deeper I will have to see
What lies there, what is real

[Pre-chorus:]
Deep underneath, so far it's hard to see
On goes the fucking circus affecting you and me,
The legacy remains year after year
Inheritance of sickness spreading out
Messengers of illness everywhere I see,
We are the ones, you and me

[Chorus:]
No one wants to see the truth we don't believe
No one wants to see the Antichrist in me
No one wants to see the truth we don't believe
No one wants to see the Antichrist in you and me

Deeper you should look,
deeper you'll have to see
What lies there, what is real

[Pre-chorus]

[Kride's &amp; Petri's solo]

[Chorus x2]
