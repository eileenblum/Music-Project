(As I look up to heaven)
As I look up to heaven,
Stars above stare at me
And my eyes drown in tears

Oh, how I hate the silence in here,
Only coldness lies besides me

[Chorus:]
How long do I have to wait for you?
Why can't you be here?
I'm so cold, and I'm alone
Why can't you be here?
Forever and ever

[x2]
I close my eyes and wish to dream,
But no dream will come to me

When will you be here?

Silence is more louder,
Covering my beating heart,
But the night is getting colder

Still I'm here without you,
Still I'm here all alone,
Forever I'll be here,
Waiting for you

[Chorus:]
Why can't you be here?
I'm so cold and I'm alone
Why can't you be here
Forever and ever

I close my eyes and wish to dream,
But no dream will come to me

When will you be here?

I close my eyes and wish to dream,
But no dream will come to me

As here I wait

I close my eyes and wish to dream...
(but no dream will come to me)
