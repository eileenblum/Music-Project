Your eyes that see things that are not real
Your wicked smile implies but who can believe
Your words that seem to me too much to take
Your mind relies on the fact that it just might break

Who do you think you are?
What do you think you can accomplish?
Come on, you ain't real

Show me why to try, just tell me why
Come on, you ain't real

Tell me why, tell me why to believe your lies

Come on, you ain't real
Tell me why, tell me why to try, just tell me why
Come on, you ain't real
Tell me why, tell me why to believe your lies
Tell me why, tell me why to believe your lies
