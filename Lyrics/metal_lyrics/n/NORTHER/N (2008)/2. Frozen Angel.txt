We were together as one
All that we had can't be undone
Our love fading, now it's gone
Our time fading, so it's done

The blood that binds us
It's the blood that binds us
Till death unites us

[Chorus:]
Alone we die
My Frozen angel
Alone we fade away
From this world
Alone you die
My frozen angel
Alone we fade away
From this world

We were together as one
All that we had can't be undone
Our love fading the feeling is gone
Our time fading, now it's done

[Chorus]

[Tumoas' synth, Kride's &amp; Petri's guitar solo]

[Chorus]

Alone we die
My Frozen angel
Alone we fade away
From this world
Alone you die
My frozen angel
Nothing I do, nothing I say
Fade Away, My angel, My angel
