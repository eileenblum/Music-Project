Wasting the years,
Living the life of a shoveling alcoholic
One foot in the grave
The head in the toilet,
You should be kicked into orbit

And you should know
You will fall
God damn schizophrenic

Down you'll go
All alone
God damn King of Fools

Down, no more excuses
To hide your lies
Down, down you're going
You're so easy to despise
You tried to stop us
We tore your heart
But you just can't tear us apart
Down, down you're going
You're rotten to the core.

In the darkness, cold and harmless
You're fucking retarded, you just pressed charges
Playing your shit to trick me
You tried to fool us by offering a dream

And you should know
You will fall
God damn schizophrenic

Down you'll go
All alone
God damn King of Fools

Down, no more excuses
To hide your lies
Down, down you're going
You're so easy to despise
You tried to stop us
We tore your heart
But you just can't tear us apart
Down, down you're going
You're rotten to the core.

Down, no more excuses
To hide your lies
Down, down you're going
You're so easy to despise
You tried to take more than what was yours
But you couldn't steal our show
Down, down you're going
You're rotten to the core.
