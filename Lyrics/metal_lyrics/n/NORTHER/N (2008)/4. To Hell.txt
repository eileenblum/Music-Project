Vanity is eating us away
And no one cares
Insanity is made stay
Shine in the eyes but the soul wonders why...

They're so alone,
Searching for their souls
But where to go
To find the answers?
Nowhere we know
Awaiting us in the end
But where to go to find the answers?

Serenity is gone forever
Inside, the stars prevail with no end
Daily we face distress, together
Look at the world, reflect the soul
And who will save us?

We're going to Hell
Gone are the days of forgiveness and grace
We're going to Hell
To finalize the plan altogether, hand in hand.

We're so alone
Searching for our souls
But where to go
To find the answers?

Insanity is made to stay
And no one ever cares...

We're going to Hell
Gone are the days of forgiveness and grace
We're going to Hell
To finalize the plan altogether, hand in hand.
