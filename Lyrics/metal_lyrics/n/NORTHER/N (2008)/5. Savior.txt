By this time tomorrow you'll be gone
Gone so far away
And it's killing me, tearing me apart

Walls are closing in on me,
Taking my breath away
No light to guide my way
Is this really the end?

[Chorus:]
Please, tomorrow, bring her back to me
A day without her is a wasted one
She's my savior (she's my savior)
She's the one for me

At this time tomorrow you'll be here
So close to me
You'll set me free, you'll wipe my tears away
You'll break the chains
You'll bring the light back into my face
You'll guide my way into a new day
Where we are one...

She's my savior
She's the one for me

[Chorus]
