Surrounding endless darkness
Screaming echoing silence
Embraced by shadows
They tear me apart
I'm nothing, that's all I am
I dwell in me, in the core of my agony

Within myself, think I'm lost again
Feels like I'm fading away
Close my eyes, a sudden change into a state
Where life is dust and everything flows
Circling above around
Something grabs me, pulling me down, I'm falling

Falling further down, falling down, down in black
Falling further down, no way out, no way back
