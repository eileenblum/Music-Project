You judge, you know better, you think that you are something more,
I know you're something less.
You say, you are better, you think that you are so much more,
I know you're so much shit
Every day, it goes further, you're loosing everything there's left, and that 
ain't much.
Anyway it's wrong, anyway it's bad, anyway so sad that this is where we've 
come

So sad, so real
No way, to feel

[-chorus-]
you don't know
you don't know
you don't know shit
