In my eyes I despise your twisted life
Something controlling your fucked up mind?
Just a thought of you with your twisted little smile
Stings me like a thorn in my spine

You told me sacred lies
Through your twisted little eyes
you're sick!sick!
You're a twisted little star
You're a sick motherfucker and a fucking cocksucker
Just dwelling in the dark

[-chorus-]
Thorn in my spine
That's all you are
Thorn in my spine
That's what you are

I can't stand the sight of you
I can't stand what you put me through
You're a twisted little fuck!
You're life a lie that you hide
Is it that terrible being you inside?

[Solo: Tuomas]
