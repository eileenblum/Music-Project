Waiting to be born again, waiting to see the light
Hoping to feel free again, trying to sleep the night
Last days are here to stay, last times last forever
Time so eternal stands, minute's like a day

[-chorus-]
Wait for to see the day
Day zero
In the end of the way
It hurts so

hurts to know
to feel the flow
dreaming of better times, stars in the open skies
sleep the night away
frozen world soon collides, with the echoes in my mind
drink the night away

[solo: Kride]
[solo: Pete]

[-chorus-]
Wait for to see the day
Day zero
In the end of the way
It hurts so
