A soul imbued by undying zeal to do Death's work
Enlightened and bound by our gruesome Lord
A living sacrifice, a vessel of divine wrath
A life of blind sin was put so triumphantly to the sword

Mind devoid of all but the Lord and His holy Code
Possession in its true form, rejection of life and the world

Serving unworldly might on earth in maniacal ecstacy
At His command and only for the sake of His Empery

Unbent I shall strive for a lifelong immaculate work of Death
For a constant work of Death

Holy servitude demands destruction of human mind
His will is all, thus all i do is but that which serves Him
And at my last breath still my eyes will burn with zeal to kill
How near the beyond, saith the Lord;
Waste not thy time
