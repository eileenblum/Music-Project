A divine order to remain in this world
Makes this foul piece of flesh to rise again
Yet a zealous longing for the dark beyond
Is ever haunting my cursed soul

A search for relief?
Is suffering and torture relief to you?
No peace, no rest, nothing worldly
Mere unknown torment in perpetuity
Once Thou art to take me to Thee
With blood on my hands doing Thy work I shall leave
A such great torment it is to serve Him
But how far greater it will be to face His Judgement

O when will i get to be nearer the Infinite
This yearning to be closer to Him is so deep
The tormenting wonders of Eternal Death call me
I will gladly obey Him , yet I wish it is soon He'll kill me

There all are and will be under His foot
Yet above the unrevering I forever shall be
The highest "plane" of His boundless kingdom
Will become my perpetual abode
Consummation of the aspiration to His unity
The reward of this oblation and life's work
Supramundane punishment and horrors
There I'm prepared to enter whenever He calls
