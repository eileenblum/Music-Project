Lord before my eyes lieth the Testimonies of Thine
Which Thou hast trusted to reveal
me in Thy all-seeing greatness
Once these wondrous Decrees
are shown they are to be kept for all time
I have longed after Thy Precepts,
and from them I shall never decline

Immerse Thou me deeper into the sea of Thy Laws
Enlarge and harden my heart to Thy stringent Statutes
Overawed I hearken to the holiness of Thy words
O deathgiving Death imperishable, my sole Lord

In umbra mortis iacet angusta via
Beati immaculati in via qui ambulant in lege Domini

Never shall I err from His revered Ordinances
Obsessed and firm I stand in obedience unto His Code
Do merely what He willeth shall be the whole of the law
Depart human will , vanish human desires , be forever gone

The sceptre of holy Iniquity pointeth at the straight path
So rigorous and stern , narrow and inhumane
With morbid ardour I will follow this illful road
His immutable Law shall be my beacon light on this
journey to the kingdom of kingdoms
Sola Mandeta Tua
