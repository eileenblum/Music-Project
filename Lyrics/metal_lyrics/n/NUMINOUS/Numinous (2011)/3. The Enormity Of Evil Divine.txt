From beyond all life breathing upon
I see the presence so delightfully strong
Emanations constantly breaking through all dimensions
Magnum mysterium , omnipresent abomination

Ever tormenting the Tree of LIfe
Ever vigilant Thine eyes
Unworthy are all names (unameable)
Beyond cosmos , beyond all
The unfailing fount of the most horrifying illness

Of the abundance of His glory the cosmos shines
The enormity of Evil Divine

None of the created , the arcane antipole of Jahve
Not to be equated or compared with anything in this world
More than existing , His supra-essential essence being utterly inconceivable
Even for the most devout His essence remains forever inscrutable

Nothing shall hinder the will of our Lord
Wholly other , concealed supreme horror
The greatest of mysteries, Life's loss is reality
The lord sitteth king eternally
