Misery, death, sorrow and pain,
Absolute power is how I reign.
Charge into battle, red horse I ride,
Fighting and killing, watching you die.
Ghoulish king, laughing with pride,
Millions are slaughtered, taking no sides.
Pray for peace to end this hell,
You no longer have a soul to sell..

[Chorus 1]
I am violence, I am war,
My throne's in hell, I am your lord.
I am sorrow, I am war,
You can't defeat my ruthless hordes.
I am evil, I am war,
Spawn of hell, infernal sword.
I am hate, I am pain,
I am war, You can't escape

Satan's legions brings man's demise,
The world burns before your very eyes
Rooks and pawns, nations and kings,
Swallow your pride, kneel to me.
Satanic master, hell's overlord,
King of the demons the god of war.
Die by my hand, I cut you down,
Crushing empires into the ground.

[Chorus 2]
Ravenous wolf, I am war,
I will reign forevermore.
Bringer of death, I am war,
Mankind's blood I lust for.
I am evil, I am war,
Spawn of hell, the infernal sword.
I am hate, I am pain,
I am war, you can't escape

Chemical fatality,
Sadistic the reality.
The line is drawn in the sand,
As the tanks are rolling in.
Pestilence rapes the land,
Killing women, children, men.

Neurotoxin infiltrates,
Disease is spreading, hell awaits.

Mass destruction no diplomacy,
Conflicts rage, nations forever bleed.
Nukes arise from underground,
Missiles unleash Lucifer's cloud.

Massacre as armies clash,
Blasting guns, warfare will last.
The world's under my control,
I am war, devour souls. [repeat]
Devourer of souls!

[lead break]

Misery, death, sorrow and pain,
Absolute power is how I reign.
Charge into battle, sword at my side,
Fighting and killing, watching you die.
Satanic master, hell's overlord,
King of the demons the god of war.
Die by my hand, I cut you down,
Slay mankind, death is cast abound.

[Repeat chorus 1]
