Sword of power, frozen in stone,
Lusted by all but given to one.
Gallant and brave from the stone I shall take,
Heart of a lion I draw the blade.

Knights of blood bound together,
Strong as steel, fist of leather.
Many have come, many have failed,
My destiny will not be derailed.

[Chorus]
Frozen in stone this mythical blade,
Behold the power that will never fade.
Frozen in stone this magical thing,
Until the new dawn brings a righteous king.

In the highlands green turns to red,
Outnumbered in this valley of death.
Black as night these dogs of war,
No fear in my heart as I hack with the sword.

Soothsayer, dragon-slayer,
Clergyman say your prayers.
Castle walls crumble down,
The king is dead I took his crown.
[Repeat]

Another day you'll live to see,
Pledge your life unto me.
Upon my steed aloft I ride,
Excalibur at my side.

[Chorus]
Frozen in stone this mythical blade,
Behold the power that will never fade.
Frozen in stone forged in hells fire,
Infernal furnace the devil's pyre.

Lay down the gauntlet, declaration of war,
Relinquish my life for the king my lord.
Bound for glory, I'll fight till the death,
Defeat the enemy or breathe my last breath.

[Lead break]

Knights of blood bound together,
Strong as steel and fist of leather.
Many have come, many have failed,
Our destiny will not be derailed.

Endless battles, relentless we fight,
Forever slaying with all of our might.
Mounted on horseback together we ride,
Fighting and killing, watch our enemies die.

[Chorus]
Frozen in stone this mythical blade,
Behold the power it will never fade.
Frozen in stone now in the battlefield,
I'm the chosen one, Excalibur I wield.

Lay down the gauntlet, declaration of war,
Relinquish our lives for the king our lord.
Bound for glory, we'll fight till the death,
Defeat the enemy or breathe our last breath.
