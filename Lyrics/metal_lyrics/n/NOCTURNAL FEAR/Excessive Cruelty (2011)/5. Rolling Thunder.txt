Death from above, rolling like thunder,
Dropping bombs below, only choice is surrender.
Another air attack causing mass demise,
Napalm burning flesh and bone, taking all their lives.

Target in sight, deadly missile strike,
Jungle burns hot, searing flames will devour.
Villages are charred, adversaries die,
Scorched earth becomes ash this is our reprise.

[Chorus 1]
Rolling thunder, burnt to a cinder,
Baptized in fire, hellish decimation.

Cremations comes today, torching lives away,
Human ash remains, scorching heat, asphyxiation.
Suffering in pain, burning fire rain,
Napalm falls from blackened skies final judgement day.

The enemy has lost, paid the fatal cost,
Perished in flames, nothing left hells inferno.
Everything ablaze, complete and total loss,
Consumed by fire, sterilized, infernal holocaust.

[Chorus 2]
Rolling thunder, man's hellfire,
Ignite the pyre, total incineration.

Swoop down dive in open the hatch,
Release the payload weapons dispatched.
Wave of destruction thunderous crash,
Massacre this enemy death's coming fast.

Hell-birds flying rule the sky,
All life below will surely die.
Vicious onslaught flames burning high,
Disintegration mercy denied.

[Repeat verses 1 &amp; 4, chorus 1]
