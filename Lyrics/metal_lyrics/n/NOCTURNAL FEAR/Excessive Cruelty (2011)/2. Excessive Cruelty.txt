Dealing in agony, infliction of pain,
Cut off the heads of those who are slain.
You try to plea but I hear not your cry,
A swing of my axe then you will die.
Kill with such force it can't be denied,
To late to run there's nowhere to hide.
Thrashing down, sinister power,
Beneath me you now cower.

[Chorus]
Excessive cruelty, unleash the warrior in me,
A flash of the blade is all that you'll see, excessive cruelty.
As you die in misery, excessive cruelty.

Metal strikes metal my axe dismantles,
Your armor and you soul.
Clashing of blades, warrior engaged,
Lives taken by the sword.
Crashing of steel shattering shields,
Helmets and skulls split in half.
Sadistic the rage, fury and pain,
Relentless combat.

[Repeat chorus]

The smell of death and screams of pain fill the air,
Bodies litter the battlefield blood is everywhere.
Hear the crying of the dying, begging for mercy,
Mortal wounds, severed limbs, endless agony.

[Lead break]

Ruthless hordes with axes and swords,
March across this battered land.
Another army crawls, another kingdom falls,
Violent conquest is at hand.

[Repeat 1st verse, chorus]
