Trained in the art of murder, strategic assassination.
Those I put within my sights, will face elimination.

Heart of stone, blood runs cold, master-marksman paid to kill.
Time to take your last breath, bringer of pain, sudden death.

[Chorus]
Sniper born, sniper bred, murder for hire, shot to the head.
A contract killer dealing death, human target now lies dead.
[Repeat]

Expose the individual, squeeze the trigger one shot one kill.
Deliver the bullet and seal your fate, never do I hesitate.

The sniper scope is my third eye, you can run but cannot hide.
My vantage point is concealed, your death warrant has been sealed.

[Repeat chorus]

Hired gun, assassination, killings my business, kill for pleasure.
Snipe down the mark from far away, another kill shot another pay day.

[Lead break]

The sniper scope is my third eye, you can run but cannot hide.
My vantage point is concealed, your death warrant has been sealed.

Heart of stone, blood runs cold, master-marksman paid to kill.
Time to take your last breath, bringer of pain, instant death.

Trained in the art of murder, strategic assassination.
Now you are within my sights, will face elimination.

Hired gun, assassination, killings my business, I kill for pleasure.
Snipe you down, blow you away, the bullet strikes you die day.

[Repeat chorus]
