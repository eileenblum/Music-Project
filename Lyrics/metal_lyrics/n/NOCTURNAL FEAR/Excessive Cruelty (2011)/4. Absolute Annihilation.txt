They told us it would never be,
That we would remain free.
Free of death and free of war,
Now the sun won't shine no more.
Dark deception filled with lies,
Take your last look at the sky.
Suicide the easy way out,
Or die from the nuclear fallout.

[Chorus]
Living hell, raging fire, destruction and decay.
Burning eyes, burning flesh, prophets in dismay.
Dying now, screaming loud in agonizing pain.
"Absolute annihilation" is the end game.

Global tensions now increase,
Lost are hopes for world peace.
Super-powers eye to eye,
Armageddon shall arise.
Sirens sound it is confirmed,
Missiles launch the warnings heard.
Millions perish, earth's hellbound,
Weapons rise from underground.

[Repeat chorus]

Missiles strike their targets,
The slaughter then begins,
Nuclear fire incinerates,
Scorched flesh disintegrates.
Retinas melt from within,
People die in a flash, smoldering piles of ash.

[Lead break]

The game is now over,
Radiation fills the air.
Our world is destroyed,
Governments do not care.
Total decimation,
Complete devastation.
In the violent aftermath,
Of this holocaust.

[Repeat chorus 1]
