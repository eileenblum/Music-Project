Brains explode flesh and bone,
Man's demise has been foretold.
Prophets scream the end approaches,
Nothing survives, only cockroaches.

Death rains down nuclear winter,
Everything dies burnt to a cinder.
Buildings destroyed a force unforgiving,
Dead cities rot its just the beginning.

[Chorus]
World war three, instant death for humanity,
World war three, violent nuclear tragedy.

Fatal cries the world is torn,
No second chance with nuclear war.
Fake gods, false religion,
Put us in this position.

Deep in the earth missile silos below,
Fire unleashed on every last soul.
Mushroom clouds, mass devastation,
Our funeral will be a cremation.

[Chorus]
World war three, radiation kills relentlessly,
World war three, extinction our reality.

Ash falls from the sky, god cries as his children die.
Angel wings now ignite, incineration blinding light.
Judgment day has come to pass, hell released as Satan laughs.
Final verdict lesson learned, as the world fuckin burns.
[Repeat]

[Lead break]

Fatal cries the world is torn,
No second chance with nuclear war.
Fake gods, false religion,
Put us in this position.

Death rains down nuclear winter,
Everything dies burnt to a cinder.
Buildings destroyed a force unforgiving,
Dead cities rot its just the beginning.

[Repeat chorus 1]
