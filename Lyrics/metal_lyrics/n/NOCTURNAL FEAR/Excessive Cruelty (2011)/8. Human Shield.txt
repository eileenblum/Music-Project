Innocent lives lined up to die,
Caught in a crossfire forced into the fight.
Ruthless decision, suicide mission,
Unwilling souls, human ammunition.

Hate infected, lead injected,
Make the incision, scars of religion.
Enemy uses women and children,
Defending objectives, lower than vermin.

[Chorus]
Faces of death staring at me,
Human shield, endless atrocity.
The reapers blade will set them free,
Human shield, endless atrocity.

The battle has changed anything goes,
Wrath and fury unleashed on our foes.
Time to destroy the gloves are coming of,
They wanna fight dirty we're calling their bluff.

War-birds descend loaded with bukes,
Death from above as the bombers let loose.
We're just soldiers following orders,
Human shield splattered by mortars.

[Repeat chorus]

[Instrumental break]

Brutality, marching to die,
Sent to hell with no reason why.
Collateral damage they are born to die,
Dying for nothing but a bloodstained lie.

Full scale assault, troops now engage,
Total onslaught, combats deadly game.
Lust for power drives their brigade,
Blood the fuel, feeds the flames.

Baptized in fire, pain now sanctifies,
Darkness falls, innocence dies.
Religious weapons they kill with time,
Conjure the masses, watch them die.

Dark deception, hatreds decay,
Blind faith, shall rot away.
Fatalities, make their final stand,
Soul sacrifice, in blood and sand.

[Lead break]

[Repeat first verse]

[Repeat second verse]

[Repeat chorus]
