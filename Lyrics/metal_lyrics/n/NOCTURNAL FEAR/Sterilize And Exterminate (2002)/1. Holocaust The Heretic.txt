Valley of the kings-Overrun with gore
The world is witness-To holocaust once more
Bloodthirsty backstabbing whore race
Cursed to wander the deserts wastes
Descended of Satan, bloodline of Cain
All nations united against this plague

[Chorus:]
Holocaust the heretic
The Nile turns to blood
Holocaust the heretic
The desert starts to flood

Nuclear armageddon, megatons of radiation
Winds of death, blowing clouds of nerve gas
Ashes of sub-humans, deserts turn to glass

Embers burning once more, eternal as time
Fueled by hatred, annihilation of mankind
This bloodbath will never fuckin end
Satan's curse is now unleashed, Hell on Earth

Valley of the kings-Overrun with gore
The world is witness-To holocaust once more

Insatiable parasite unquenched by our blood
Heresy and blasphemy, master of slavery
The iceman will rise again
With fire and famine to slaughter their kind

[Chorus]
