Violence will rain down on you death comes from the sky
Air strike overhead dropping bombs bring death
The ground troops move in atrocity of war begins
Murder and rape of the innocent victims of the warmachine

A blitzkreig attack with the fury of Hell
All guns a blazing slaughter them all
The ground troops move in atrocity of war begins
A bloody pile of human remains
Disfigured carcasses skin turns black
Murder and rape of the innocent victims of the warmachine

Our army marches across the land
You can't escape your destiny
When death comes a calling there's nowhere for you to hide
The screams of dying linger in the air
Blood and guts are everywhere bodies are on fire
Who said war is fair!?

Warmachine, keeps rolling on, warmachine, death to all
Warmachine, can't be stopped, warmachine, there's no remorse
There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide
When the warmachine comes for you!
