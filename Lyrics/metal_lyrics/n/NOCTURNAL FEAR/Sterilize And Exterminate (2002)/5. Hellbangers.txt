Shredding guitars like a chainsaw attack
And thundering drums

[Chorus:]
Hellbangers  Thrash on
Hellbangers  Will rage
Hellbangers  Thrash on
Hellbangers  Can't be stopped

Black leather and spikes time for metal tonight
A wall of fuckin sound will amke your ears bleed
Bullet belt thrash at neck breaking speed
With ripping vocals and a pounding bass line

[Chorus]

Like a freight train we'll plow through our songs
Gig after gig the show will go on
Bullet belt thrash at neck breaking speed
Down on the floor the Hellbangers thrash
Blood and sweat its metal mayhem

Have a beer and bring your friends
We're all thrashaholics its time for a shot

[Chorus]

We'll play for you all night long
We're Nocturnal Fear Hellbangers thrash on
Our music is raw and fuckin pissed
Bullet belt thrash at neck breaking speed

[Chorus]
