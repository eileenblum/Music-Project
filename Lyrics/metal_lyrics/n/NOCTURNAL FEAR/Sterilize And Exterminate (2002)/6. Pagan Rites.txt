Shadows rise in the graveyard mist
Names are written on the ancient list
The hooded one is cloaked in red

Pagan Rites-in the dead of night
Pagan Rites-grant eternal life

Can the fallen hear our voices in their graves?
We'll give them honor, we'll give them praise
They lived in valor in battle they died
Sacrifice the beast and strip off its hide

Spells cast in the midnight air
The witching hour is drawing near
The stone circle is where they stand
Demons rise at their command

Pagan heathen ancient superstition
Frightened by shadows and tormented in the fire
Rituals and ways all will be lost
All of them slaughtered in the sign of the cross

Pagan Rites  Shrouded in mystery
Pagan Rites  Hidden in obscurity
