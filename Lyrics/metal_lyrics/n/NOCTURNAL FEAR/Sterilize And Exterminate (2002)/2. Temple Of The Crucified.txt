Temple of the crucified, where the dead hang putrified
Come inside and witness the end of Christianity
Enter this unholy place of darkness and death
Strapped and nailed to a cross
Your deity is left to rot

Their souls are condemned to the abyss
For all the rest of eternity

The church has fallen into disgrace
All hope for your salvation has been stripped away
Sins of the father fallen on his sons
Now they have to pay for their blind loyalty
Your suffering will never stop even after you die
Your soul will rot

Jesus is no help to you pray to your god
You'll be tormented in the fires of Hell
