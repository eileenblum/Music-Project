Sitting death decayed upon unholy throne of blasphemy
The staff he holds brings certain death a waste land where nothing is left

Legions of nobility-procreation of the obscene
Cast beyond the seven gates-forbidden realms of the obscene

[Chorus]
Unholy throne of blasphemy crowned with scorn
Walls of deciet where corruption was born

Redeemer of blasphemy purifier of the human race
Unleashed vengeance mankind is layed to waste

A mask of "humanity" won't guard your life
These parasites will see the hatred in your eyes
Smoldering corpses blacken the sky
