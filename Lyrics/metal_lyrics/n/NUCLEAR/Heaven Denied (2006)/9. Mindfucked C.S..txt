Erratic were your thinking
Of getting things unpunished at all!!!
Bastards like yourself deserves less
Than a rapist on tour
Fucking asshole!!!
Nothing you would say
You would do will get you out
Of your locked!!!
Spiniak fucing maggot you will never
Be touching one soul

Mindfucked C.S.

Many were the children
You have forced
To fuck under your control
You just paid the jury but those fuckers
Turn their backs on you!!
What about it!!!
Let us raise as one together
Money can't avoid the truth
Spiniak as a bastard you will find
Some fucking bullet on you

Funny was the time of abusive kids?
What about your fucking rapes?
What about you playing
just another game?
Pick a fucking gun and
just blow your fucking brain!!!

Everlasting pain, seeking
For redemption taht will never come
Can you see all the children faces
You must pay your toll
Are you happy now in your rotten cell
iI think you're fucking not
Let me tell you motherfucker
What i think about
You raping hell hole storm!!!

Bioterror!!! your body won't resist
What i've prepared for you
Animal!!! your life
Has been circumscribed to which i'm able to do
It's my calling now!!! imagine how much
I'll enjoy watching you as you fall
If i were you, I'd be thanking god,
Human's -pain- Thresholds - are - low!!!

You'll find your life ripped out MINDFUCKED C.S!!!!!!!
