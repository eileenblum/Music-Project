Aggressive behaviours
Dead walking people there
Seeking to be out of sin
Can they ever achieve this?

An intensive wish to be known
Surrounded by silence nobody knows

Now the wind is near arround
Even you run It'll be after you
Nowhere to go, nowhere to be
You will never find the way to be free.
