Nowadays, people's falling down
Nothing in this world seems to be like it used to
Doesn't care, if you fuck with me time will tell
You'll probably end in a wheel chair.

Indeed!!!

Try on me, I dare you...THINK! I dare you...THINK!
I dare you...THINk!. Stupid fucker, you wanted in this way
The pain you asked for...
The pain you'll get for being such an asshole.

The pain you asked for...
Self created terror
The pain you asked for...
And there's nothing in this world you can do to avoid it.
