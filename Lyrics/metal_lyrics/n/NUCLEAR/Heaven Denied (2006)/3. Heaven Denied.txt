Let me tell a story about a heaven denied
Something i assure you won't like
Against to all your wishes as a man you must die!
Standing bravely for first time.

A man without fear is man is a man without hope
It's only a fact that should know
Gateways to heaven never closer to hell
It's a damn fucking nightmare you won't awake.

Blaming you childhood is not gonna help
Unjustice's coming to an end
Judgement's beginning and it's also your death
Believe god is not your friend.

A man without fear is man is a man without hope
It's only a fact that should know
Gateways to heaven never closer to hell
It's a damn fucking nightmare you won't awake.

Heaven Denied !!
