Deceiting, outraging attitude
Dolo comes so early i can't even find myself in tune
Fear no, what's all about to come
Cause people in this country
Destroy everything they've supposed to love!!!

No respect for hundred thousand yeras
Palying sick games with human illusions
Fuck them all y will pay my toll
I will spit my guts to every fucking one i know!!!

Dolo, Won't sympathize with this
Dolo, won't live my life like this
Dolo, my life remains the same
Instanly i will drive my fucking mind insane.
