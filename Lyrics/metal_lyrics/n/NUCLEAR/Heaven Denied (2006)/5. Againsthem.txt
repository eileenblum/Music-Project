People on this country must be killed
No matter how just wanna feel the hit
Stamping by foot on your fucking brains
Your fucker posser head is what i'm gonna break!!

Your suffering won't be such a grief
Your smashed face won't touch my soul
Atrocity will follow you down
Until... you find yourself ripped out

You've got a chance to get out of here alive
Your god damn problem is...
You've got a chance to get out of here alive
Your god damn problem is...
No one, no one can reborn!!!

Kill, kill there's no mercy i could feel
Torn, torn apart won't you ever think on fight me back
Feast, what a feast, fuck your life is what i need
Try not a cry, perhaps behaving this way
You could keep you fucking eyes!!
