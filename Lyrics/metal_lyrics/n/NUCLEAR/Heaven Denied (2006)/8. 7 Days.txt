I will tell you what i know
I don't wanna kjeep falling into this shit no more
7 fucking days this week doing the same old shit
It's something i don't really need

7 days you will feel that i'm gonna take control
7 days i will bleed till my life finds control!!!

I can feel my head blowing at everydy
Seeking ways to get it off out my fucking brain
I keep searching for moments of tranquility
But only find myself lost in a fucking pit.


7 days you will feel that i'm gonna take control
7 days i will bleed till my life finds control!!!

Somedays i sit down and i deeply think
About the reason of my existence...
Burried in some deep abyss
I want answers, so many questions
Life as we know it makes no sense
I'm fucked
Can't seem to get this rage out of me
System has failed for me
I just wanna live
And i will bleed and fight to get this at least.
