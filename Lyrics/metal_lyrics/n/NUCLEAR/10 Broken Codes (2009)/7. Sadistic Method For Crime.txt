Mother of six mentally ill
murder and torture randomly
cradle of love never unlocked
children in pain trapped indoors

Envy to a daughter jealous for the body
she never had and will never have
dorcing to eat till she feels sick
burning her legs as she munchs the rest

She never had a way to escape
she never knew for sure the pain
a mother could put through her
twisted mind sadistic method for crime

Distorted and vile she takes a gun
opens the grave a shot in her chest
wounded and scrawny no surgeon at home
dying in pain with four days in lock

A mode to perceive it killing for a living
feeding a mind that never adjusted
slaying the world she supposed to die for
nothing will change this fucking brainstorm
