What am i doneâ¦ you never believed i did right in my life
you think you are so kind tell me just once youâre near by my side
you chose to forgetâ¦ no one ever dared you as i for a change
is this what i get? anything you like  will i ever fucking get a break 

In spite of what you want i do have a life donât you mess with what i want
there is one only truth... to rule is your option, it makes you powerful
it has to work for me... you lying people me trying just to breathe 
iâm against you master man i would fucking kill you but you already died once

God forsaken life, left and buried alive, i have no hope to be taking for granted and display the best of myself
god forsaken life, left and buried alive, can you show me what is like to be beneath yourselfâ¦

Nnow i see your whole fucking image is nothing but a disbelief
you got yourself...  a realm of terror
thereâs no reason for me to fall into your freaking chaos
must i die and give you satisfaction?
can even care less for all of my actions
you fucked everything that made any sense for me
donât expect me to laugh... from within

Trusting... i did called the name i donât need to pretend it
nevertheless i donât expect any answers
believing or no ... thereâs not now a choice
ingrave all the feelings... put me now in control

God forsaken life, left and buried alive, i have no hope to be taking for granted and display the best of myself

God forsaken life, left and buried alive, can you show me what is like to be beneath yourself
