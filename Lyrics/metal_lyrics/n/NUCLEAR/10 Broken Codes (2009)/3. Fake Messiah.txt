Needle in the haystack
your words cannot be found
disciples of your truth
wrote shit just for you

Matters not how you tried
all your crowd are ignorants
nothing turned out
like you thought so

Ffake messiah, king of liers
fake messiah, burn on fire

Sspreading bullshit around the earth
what an icon for humanity
perverted empire  
full of twisted desires

Bbetween the lines now we can read
a message of hate and intolerance
we donât fall for your truth
we wonât stand for you

Ffake messiah, king of liers
fake messiah, burn on fire

Needle in the haystack
your work cannot be sold
armies of hate
sellers of faith

Years of infamous domination
supporting wars and mass assassinations
your image pure shit
synagogue of pain

Fake messiah, king of liers
fake messiah, burn on fire
