Drowned in fear you will lay
all the explanation has been said
my body is now ready to attack
pull my fucking trigger and say goodbye

Smell dispair and see what's coming on
take last breathe and blind it all 
i don't see a way to work it out
a human can be stopped but i am not!

I'm not a human, i don't feel, i don't know what's remorse
i do not have the asnwers, i'm a tool that can't be stopped
i'm an engine of aggression, switched on machine to destroy
and my final target is to tear you down

Engine of aggression i don't feel the pressure
to stop now and to slow down it's time to burn the coil and
no one should try to shut me off, i will last and i'll blow you up
device what was built, violent by design

I'm not a human, i don't feel, i don't know what's remorse
i do not have the asnwers, i'm a tool that can't be stopped
i'm an engine of aggression, switched on machine to destroy
and my final target is to tear you down
