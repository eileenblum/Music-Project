Full hatred response
hatred over rated
full rage contained
work rash need a cold dash
stretch myself and hold my fucking breath

Never liked your system
anyway i attended your needs
you kept pushing my temper
and lost my life as your servant

Hatred
intolerance unleashed

Full hatred response just give a reason and all get destroyed
full hatred response open wide vision out of your prison

Now iâm tired and furious
i donât need more of your loser existance
hate makes me stronger
and i wonât see your miserable life again

Hatred
intolerance unleashed

Full hatred response, just give a reason and all get destroyed
full hatred response, open wide vision out of your prison
