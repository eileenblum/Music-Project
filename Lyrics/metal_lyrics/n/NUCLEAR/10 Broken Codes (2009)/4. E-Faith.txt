Relentless...
the world should be pleased by the work they've done
raising their voice spreading their words
driving your mind to be one step closer to god...

Heavenly faces...
selling a part of the promised land
sweet talk lies cult control unfolded
keep your holy trash away - from â me

Nobody should buy whatâs - not - for - sale
using god as an image to be afraid
if you feel despair and afraid of the end
all the fucking answers are on e-faith

I know the fucking reasons why i should believe
in spite of every one of them i just can see
you're a bunch of idiots who don't have a life
it's your fucking weakness can't you realize?

I don't fucking mind if i go to hell
if that's my only future well so be it
maybe i will find you around in there
as i always say... god is not your friend

Nobody should buy whatâs not - for - sale
using god as an image to be afraid
if you feel despair and afraid of the end
all the fucking answers are on e-faith
