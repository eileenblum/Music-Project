Sorrow, pain, agonic till the end
a soundless childâs scream calling in
embracing alone a chance from death
innocent victim of the violence that burns

Dementia increasing blinded from whatâs real
seeking a way to make her disappear
erasing the thought that leads you to fear
parricide, homicide, unsighted dried last tears

Violence that burns! 
no more dreams, her seedâs reaching end

Violence that burns! 
one more breathe and both lifes will fade away

Violence that burns! 
broken hope for the love that meant one day

Violence that burns! 
start to pray for the life sheâs carrying in

Blinded by fear thereâs no escape
insanityâs flames approaching to death
painful unborn screams silenced by fire
irrational aggression that burns your desires

Silence turns to murder, burning deep inside
dying painful screams twisting from within
pathetic lifestyle that hides your misery

Silence turns to murder, burning deep inside
dying painful screams twisting from within

Violence that burns! 
no more dreams, her seedâs reaching end

V iolence that burns! 
one more breathe and both lifes will fade away

Violence that burns! 
broken hope for the love that meant one day

Violence that burns! 
start to pray for the life sheâs carrying in
