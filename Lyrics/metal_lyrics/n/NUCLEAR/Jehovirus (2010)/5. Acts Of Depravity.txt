A public figure shield hides your obscenities
Unprotected get abused and suffer constantly
Demigod of pain you feel unbreakable
Your turbid era of gain never finds the end
40 years absorbing from human lives
40 years lying to remain alive
40 years battering relentlessly
40 years of acts of depravity
Terrorized slaves wipe the blood you spill
Influences you have conceal the lives you shred
Dissoluteness as much as your money can pay
Mastermind of a sect of debauchery
40 years absorbing from human lives
40 years lying to remain alive
40 years battering relentlessly
40 years of acts of depravity
40 years absorbing from human lives
40 years lying to remain alive
40 years battering relentlessly
40 years of acts of depravity
Your life is nothing but
The reflect of a lie
Your money is nothing but
A system mechanized
Camarades are made
The power you applied
The silence of the crowd
Multi-faced bastardized

Depravity!!!
