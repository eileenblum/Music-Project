I just need to see how you enjoy the grief
I just need to see warlike outlook
You infringe the pain with unfriendliness
Mistrust to the world

Savage till the death no fucking regrets
Unsought destiny misanthropic
The malevolence won't decrease today
Animosity

Feel distrust, infect your mind, prepare bloodshed,
Let yourself go to â¦
Belligerence

No lives left to take you fulfilled your thirst
Hostile to the grave barbarism
Arrange other fight now its time to die
Combat alibi!!!

Weapons as a fist no time for the peace
Strike back intensely chaos and riot
Hitting merciless feel the angerness
Furious to the core

Feel distrust, infect your mind, prepare bloodshed,
Let yourself go to â¦
Belligerence

Life's a hate campaign im prepared to ingrave
All my violent thoughts nihilism
Anarchic revolt street justice reborns
It's time for mayhem

I just need to see how you enjoy the grief
I just need to see warlike outlook
You infringe the pain with unfriendliness
Mistrust to the world

Feel distrust, infect your mind, prepare bloodshed,
Let yourself go to â¦
Belligerence
