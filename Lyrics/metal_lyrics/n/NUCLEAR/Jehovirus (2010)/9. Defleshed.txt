Why don't you tell what's truly in your mind
Are you frightened of what will people realize
The shield of the lies is nothing but the flesh
Which today it will be defleshed

you bought a throne and you steal the crown
Filling an order of the system pushing all
What would threat the position in your realm
Worthless loser, nobody really cares

the narrowness doesn't let you see
Oopposition of reality

The world you built isn't what you think
Crumbled empire of insanity

So many lies not a single regret
You will miserably be defleshed
You have no control of this phoney work
No one should their lose time with you

For a second in life you were a good friend
I just felt you'd change again
You set up this war it isn't my fault
You have earned this endless shit

Why don't you tell what's truly in your mind
Are you frightened of what will people realize
The shield of the lies is nothing but the flesh
Which today it will be defleshed

You will be defleshed!!!
