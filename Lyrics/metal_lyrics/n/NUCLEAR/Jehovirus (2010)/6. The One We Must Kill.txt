Fixated in a lavish trend style
Forecaster of death, you choose the one to die
Taking over, as a vision for the win
River of delusion, you are the one we must kill

Distressed, my life just putrefies
Cold blooded maggot you won't stop till you see me die
Superior, degenerated way of life
Obsessed with a power which is nothing but a lie

When is it going to end?
A menace to your fortune is the trigger of new death
Deliberated set up for you
You won't see me coming i will fucking kill you
Now i will eliminate
The one who feeds my deepest hate
Is payback time, the day of my revenge
Say your stupid prayers, you are the one i must kill
Human waste!, no time for you to say
Begging for mercy that you'll never receive
Failed shit!, now i can see your fears
No one will listen your terrified screams

Disgusting crap! say bye to your existence
Feel my hands pushing against your throat
Scumbag loser! your life is in my hands
And to face the death is all that you deserve!

Distressed, my life just putrefies
Cold blooded maggot you won't stop till you see me die
Superior, degenerated way of life
Obsessed with a power which is nothing but a lie
Fixated in a lavish trend style
Forecaster of death, you choose the one to die
Taking over, as a vision for the win
River of delusion, you are the one we must kill
