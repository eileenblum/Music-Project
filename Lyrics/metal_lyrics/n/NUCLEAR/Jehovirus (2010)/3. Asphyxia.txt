What's going through my mind?
Years pretending be a man who live a life
Many choices to improve what i have done
I don't see it happen 
It just can't be molded back

My throat closes when i take a breath
Waking up at night to erase my pain
Death will come and i'll no longer be afraid
Cold sweating hands and a gun pointing to my head

Asphyxia! , falling towards, asphyxia!
Asphyxia!, falling towards, asphyxia!

I need to leave the world that i neglected
Massive second thoughts is the reflection of my world
If i face the death, no compassion to myself!
Close to meet the end across the bridge of psychosis
Excruciating, 
Lies took my life away
Piercing
My soul to its very end
Choking,
Until i fade to dim again
I resigned
To exist,
Self aggravated i asphyxiate!
Can't breath
I asphyxiate!!
Life suffocates me!!!

Excruciating!!!!!
My world is changing fast in a merciless confinement
Running to nowhere the freedom nevermore exists
Engines in a world without any kind of hope
Dominates the world as you've never seen before
My throat closes when i take a breath
Waking up at night to erase my pain
Death will come and i'll no longer be afraid
Cold sweating hands and a gun pointing to my head

Asphyxia! , falling towards, asphyxia!
Asphyxia!, falling towards, asphyxia!
Asphyxia!!
