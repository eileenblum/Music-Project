Detonate, blinded by my master
I will hide and confine my fears
Endless war, my minds keeps reading
The last vision of the horror

Abnormal, in an edge of sanity
A narrow line divides my frayed world
Guilty man, enlisted for a purpose
Way beyond the limits of the reason

Covered in blood i'll stick to "false flag"
With honour i'll serve the lord of war

Fire at will, voices shuts the order
To restrian the moving forward
Conquer all, the ground signs throw
Which direction is set to march on!

Covered in blood i'll stick to "false flag"
With honour i'll serve the lord of war

Deliberation for assassination
Confrontation leads to devastation
Combat zone is my safe zone
Peace can't be, the war is cold
Bulletproof i shall no breathe
Until i find the way to kill
overed in blood i'll stick to "false flag"
With honour i'll serve the lord of war

Annihilate, living in the warfield
I will hear the voices of the dead
Now, where's my life?
The war machinery still governs my actions

Without peace towards to the abyss
Insane visions, psychopathic behaviors
Endless war, my life is being feeding
By all the horror they created

Deliberation for assassination
Confrontation leads to devastation
Combat zone is my safe zone
Peace can't be, the war is cold
Bulletproof i shall no breathe
Until i find the way to kill
