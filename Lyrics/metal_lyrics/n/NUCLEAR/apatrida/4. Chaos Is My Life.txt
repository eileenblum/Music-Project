[originally by The Exploited]No future no future
No future at all
No money no job
You've got fuck all

[Chorus]
Chaos is my life
Chaos is my life
Chaos is my life

Another fucking restart
Is waiting for you
The future is fucked
More chaos for you

[Chorus]
Chaos is my life
Chaos is my life
Chaos is my life

Don't let the bastards
Get to you
The future is chaos
And chaos is you

[Chorus]
Chaos is my life
Chaos is my life
Chaos is my life
