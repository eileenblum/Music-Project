Darkness blots out the sun
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
A roaring torrent of oily fiends
Through the city streets careens

Crickets! That's what they are
Crickets! As far as the eye can see:
They're hopping and chirping and breeding and
Feasting on the flesh of you and

I will not survive!
This onslaught of evil embodied:
This insect eruption, this cricket corruption

All mankind will die! (all mankind will die)

Nothing but crickets remain:
Foolish and proud, we thought them mundane.
Until one fateful night, everything changed,
Out with a chirp, not with a bang!

Chirp chirp chirp BLEHH

This vulgar contagion of cricketine rot
Spreads through the land with a chirp and a hop
As we swarm to the left, we shall swarm to the right
Battalions of crickets all swarming tonight
We are crickets together; crickets who sin
Husk on the outside, crickets within!
Hopping together, we're hopping all night
Hopping for victory, hopping with might!

Bounding over the hills,
They won't stop till they get their fill!
Squirming river of terrible bugs,
Catastrophic hopping flood!

Crickets! Rain from the sky!
Crickets! They're coming for you and me:
Leaping and creeping and crawling and
Gouging out your...

I will not survive!
Ignoring our sobs and ignoring our begs
As they kick off our faces with muscular legs

All mankind will die! (all mankind will die)

You are a cricket and I am one too,
We're all just crickets who are coming for you
An eye for a feeler, or an arm for a wing,
It's time for our revenge on all human fiends.
