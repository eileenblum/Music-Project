Many things can happen in space!
Moons spinning past, black holes, gamma rays...
You can see lots of things in space!
Asteroids, cosmic dust, solar winds forever gust!
Unless you want to die in space you must learn to trust...
Your friends!

Things, things in space, lots of things!
One dwarf, two dwarf, red dwarf, blue dwarf!
Stuff, stuff in space, lots of stuff!
Three dwarf, four dwarf, black hole, fuck you!

Friends, friends in space, lots of friends!
Nekrogoblikon! Nekrogoblikon!
Space! Trust your friends, just your friends!
Nekrogoblikon! Nekrogoblikon!

To the heavens, we shall fly - try to find the reason why
To the edge of space we'll blast, towards the future, fuck the past!
Lots of things surrounding you, it's a brand new point of view
Trust your heart, follow through, don't stop searching for the truth!

Cryogenic encounters of the cosmic kind
Into the void, what will we find? Who knows?
Severed the ties - we left it all behind
Into the stars we go!
What we find IS A FUCKING HIVE MIND

[solos: Alex, Aaron]

Many things can happen in brains!
Time's coming near, almost there, never fear...
You can think lots of stuff with brains!
Free your mind, join the horde! Friends in space forevermore
All together powerful and we will never reach
The end!

Brains, brains in space, lots of brains!
could mind, don't mind, never mind, hive mind!
Space, space in space, lots of space!
Three void, four void, butt hole, fuck you!

Friends, friends in space, lots of friends!
Nekrogoblikon! Nekrogoblikon!
Hark! Trust your friends, just your friends!
Nekrogoblikon! Nekrogoblikon!
