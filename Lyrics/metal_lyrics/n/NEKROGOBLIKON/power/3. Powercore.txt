Get out!

Your repugnancy deeply sickens me,
You are a failure and I want you to die!
Your dumb look implies that you do not know why,
So let me break it down:

You are stifling the power, rotten to the core
Such a massive fail, guess what? You're boring and I've seen this all before
You're a joke and no one's laughing,
I'm goin' for baroque and it all comes crashing down

Every time that you try to do something right
You seem to get it oh so wrong
It's almost like a joke
But no one's laughing now
As we reach the final hour
You were never the core of my power
Just a foolish dream and
You have failed me

You're so terrible, it's unbearable
You're just a phony, and I want you to explode
Your deplorable brain fills my heart with disdain
Ain't got the time to explain...

[solos: Aaron, Alex]

To think I ever trusted you makes me bow my head in shame
Everything has gone to shit and as always you're the only one to blame
Reality trembles at the notion of one so naive
To know I gave you one more chance gives me the creeps

More disappointing than a box of rats on christmas
More worthless than a dumpster filled with pogs (POGS!)
More disgusting than the time I took a bath with lots of slugs
More revolting than a barrel full of ears
