Far away from home, looking out at the stars,
We found a dead giraffe, floating right by Mars.
A strange creature he was with his big sad eyes,
How'd he wind up here? What a long-necked surprise!

Suddenly a giraffe! Suddenly a giraffe! (Giraffe!)
Everybody come look, everybody come laugh! (Giraffe!)

We carried him in, we sang a somber song,
There was talk of death, and if we had gone wrong...
So far in space, we'd been through a lot,
Should we turn back now? Has it all been for naught?

Fuck it!
Goblins forever!
Friendship is the only option!
Let's eat our new giraffe!
