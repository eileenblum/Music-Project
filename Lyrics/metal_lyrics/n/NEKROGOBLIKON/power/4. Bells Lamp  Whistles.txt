All aboard!

It all seemed so simple,
Everything was going right on (right on) track.
Such a simple proposition,
But nothing's ever what it seems to be.

Rich or poor, what's done is done,
Now there's no more (no more) going back.
Full speed, full steam ahead,
And we're running (running) out of track.

When at first I met the fiend,
He whispered to me his fiendish scheme!

Flip the switch!
Change the course!
Money's good!
No remorse!

Drunk on thoughts of harlots and gold.
Everything would be mine, or so I was told.
Reroute the train, my only task.
What for, and how, I dare not ask!

Lined up at the station,
Everybody wants to ride the (ride the) train.
Such a tempting new adventure,
But nothing's ever what it seems to be.

Sheriff and deputy, banker and the hangman,
Everybody's here!
The time has come to go!
I tell them not to fear...

So all aboard!

Stop!
A scream from the caboose!
It has begun!
But why is there blood?
I did not agree to murder,
This is supposed to be a robbery!
The fiend has stabbed me in the back!

He's a fiend with a plan and I trusted him well but then
How could I know this would go straight to hell?
With a whistle and a bell (a whistle and a bell)
A whistle and a bell (a whistle and a bell)

On a train I control on the route that I changed
It's a nightmare and I am the one that's to blame,
With a whistle and a bell (a whistle and a bell)
A whistle and a bell (a whistle and a bell)

All aboard this train of death are being slaughtered
Right before my eyes!
Guts are flying everywhere,
Propelled by fiendish lies!

Dragged down the aisle, my shackled family
Are slowly being flayed by the claws of the fiend!

By the time I stop the train their skin is fully peeled
The fiend is eating my wife's brain as a victory meal!
What have I done? What have I done?!
Gone and ruined a nice train ride for everyone!
