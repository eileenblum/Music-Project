Bears! Charging down the ravine, 
Eyes glowing bright as they tear out your spleen. 
Over the mountains they fly with a roar 
Wherever they go, the bears just leave gore! 

Bears! Standing tall in the woods, 
They'll bite off your face if you're up to no good. 
Claws leaving scars, giant teeth tearing skin, 
Fur on the outside and darkness within! 

Beware the shadows that slink out of sight. 
The noises you hear will fill you with fright. 
Tonight the bears are hungry. (hungry...) 
Tonight you will not escape. (no escape...) 

Listening to you as you say your prayers - 
Evil bears with deadly stares. 
Ripping you apart to protect what's theirs - 
There is no escape from the furious bears! 

Hunters away! Stalking their prey! 
Track deep in the woods, to skin and to slay, 
They'll never catch up to the treacherous bears, 
Leading the hunters back to their lairs. 

Look up in the forest, and what do you see? 
The face of a bear that's watching for thee. 
Stand still, never budge, or the end will come quick, 
Don't make a sound, don't break a twig. 
Many ways you can die, torn limb from limb, 
Being eaten by a bear would be especially grim. 

BEARS! Watching you... 
BEARS! You're just food for... 
BEARS! Death comes slow when you're attacked by... 
BEARS! Live to kill... 
BEARS! Blood will spill... 
BEARS! Children eaten by the giant... 
BEARS! 

Setting a trap will lead to your death, 
You'll wake up in its jaws, you'll stop drawing breath. 
Tonight the bears surround you. (Surround you...) 
Tonight there will be blood. (YOUR BLOOD!) 

Hunters away! Stalking their prey! 
Track deep in the woods, to skin and to slay, 
They'll never catch up to the treacherous bears, 
Leading the hunters back to their lairs.
