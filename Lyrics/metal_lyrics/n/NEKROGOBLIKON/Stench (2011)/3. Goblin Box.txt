Moist 
Fleshy pink hands are now 
Covering us, 
Lowering us into 
A tiny metal 
Box. 
They said we would never escape 
The goblin box, 
They had never been so fucking wrong 
In their whole god damn motherfucking 

Lives so easy to save, 
Lost by the hundreds. 
Foolproof design? 
But this box is 
Easy to fucking destroy! 
Where the fuck are your brains now? 
I (think I) see them on the wall 

Breaking free 
(Rip all the humans) 
With ease 
(Tear all the humans up) 
Our appetite for blood 
(Kill all the humans) 
Impossible to please 

Stuffed 
Into the clutches of this 
Horrible box, 
So 
Many other beasts 
Have met their demises. 
They said that the box 
Was a damn solid design, 
But what they didn't realize 
Was goblins are stronger, faster, and smarter. 

Chuckling humans, sealing the box, 
Goblins are undeterred. 
Taking great care as they check all the locks 
Not a peep can be heard as they speak not a word! 

In the end, the humans are mauled, beaten, and killed. 
You may ask how this came to pass... 
How did we escape the box? 
Clearly, the answer is... 

The humans had built the box to torture and maim all kinds of magical creatures... 
But the goblins were not to be trifled with, no not to be trifled with at all. 
And as the humans lay there, a pulsating mound of bone and flesh, dead and mutilated 
Beyond all hope and reason, the goblins feasted on their rotting corpses, filling the halls with the shrill sound of chilling laughter. Forever.
