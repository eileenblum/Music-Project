Thereâs a magic spider on the wind
He spins a web for you
And if you wish upon a spider
All your wishes will all come true

Thereâs a magic spider âround the bend
Watching your every move
And if you wish upon a spider
All your dreams will come true, too

Alright!
Come on!
Let's go!

Thereâs a magic spider on the wind
He spins a web for you
And if you wish upon a spider
All your wishes will all come true

Thereâs a magic spider âround the bend
Watching your every move
And if you wish upon a spider
All your dreams will come true, too

Alright!
Come on!
Let's go!
Spider!

Alright!
Come on!
Let's go!

I search the world for a magic spider
With the fire in my eyes!
Across dimensions unknown
I must reveal this web of lies!
Into the galaxy we fly
With the promise of a spider in our eyes!
Intercosmic galacticon route number five!
I must retrieve the spider!

Thereâs a magic spider on the wind
He spins a web for you
And if you wish upon a spider
All your wishes will all come true

Thereâs a magic spider âround the bend
Watching your every move
And if you wish upon a spider
All your dreams will come true, too

Thereâs a magic spider on the wind
He spins a web for you
And if you wish upon a spider
All your wishes will all come true

Thereâs a magic spider âround the bend
Watching your every move
And if you wish upon a spider
All your dreams will come true, too

Thereâs a magic spider on the wind
He spins a web for you
And if you wish upon a spider
All your wishes will all come true

Thereâs a magic spider âround the bend
Watching your every move
And if you wish upon a spider
All your dreams will come true, too
