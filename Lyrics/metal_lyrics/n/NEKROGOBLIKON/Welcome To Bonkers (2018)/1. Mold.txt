Well I was sittin' around
I started thinking about
The way my life has gone down
It made me so upset!
But there was something waiting
Eating at my sense of nothing!

I'd become a participant-
Never been innocent
But the stench was so on point
I tried to justify the darkness
Only to become its likeness!

(Mold, moley mold mold!)
(Mold, moley mold mold!)
(Mold, moley mold mold!)

When you believe you've lost all hope
When you believe there's nothing left
Then make way for the mold!
It clings to you and me!
It's there for all to see!
We chose to let it grow!

Moving on
A choice to be a stronger son
At the sage where you realize
Nothing can be won
But I have paid so many dues
I'm moving on with or without you!

(Mold!)
(Mold!)
(Mold!)
(Mold!)
(Mold!)

How is it you feel now?
I'm in love with mold!
I'm in love with mold!

(Mold, moley mold mold!)
(Mold, moley mold mold!)
(Mold, moley mold mold!)

When you believe you've lost all hope
When you believe there's nothing left
Then make way for the mold!
It clings to you and me!
It's there for all to see!
We chose to let it grow!

(Mold, moley mold mold!)
(Mold, moley mold mold!)
(Mold, moley mold mold!)

When you believe you've lost all hope
When you believe there's nothing left
Then make way for the mold!
It clings to you and me!
It's there for all to see!
We chose to let it grow!

When you believe you've lost all hope
When you believe there's nothing left
Then make way for the mold!
It clings to you and me!
It's there for all to see!
We chose to let it grow!

There's a spider on the wind...
Yes, there's a spider on the wind...
There's a spider on the wind...
