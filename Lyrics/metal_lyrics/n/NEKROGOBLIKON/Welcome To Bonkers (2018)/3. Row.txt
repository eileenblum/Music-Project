Ooh I've been rap tap tappin'
At the Devil's door!
I've never been too good (Woo)!
But now
A knocking at my door? Oh no!
I ain't got time for you!

Row!
I wish I would have been told
I'd offended God-
I would have been much more careful
But the damage can't be undone
I've enjoy myself-
Well isn't that a shock?
Now they are I'm breaking down my door
And I'm worried about
What the devil's in store for me?

Had a vision of a cross
Impaling my throat-
Oh wow! Such power!
Well they got me on the floor
Looking at a shoe
But what did I do?
Open your eyes
It's time now:
They finally figured it out!

(All I gotta do is...)

Row!
You must obey your master!
Row!
Your bones are breaking while you-
Row!
We should be going faster
Row!
The whip will crack your back now
Row!

Ten years ago today
Every one of us became a slave
But now we don't mind
We just wanna see
The galley go
Just sit back and watch
The show
But the show is made of us
And I'm worried about-
(I'm worried about)-
What the future holds for me...

Row!
Chain me to the bow
Take away my phone
Flagellate my soul
Nowhere left to go

Screaming in pain they cry for home
But there's nowhere to go
And nothing to do
But row-row-row
Row-row-row

We're rowing nowhere fast
And God is on the wind
(But I can't feel the wind)
So row, row, row
Row-row-row

Two thousand years of slaughter
Well we've only just begun
What a ball of fun
Row-row-row
Row-row-row

We never said that we would row
But now we're chained
From stern to bow
Now row-row-row!
Row-row-row

Nothing left to do but-

Row!
You must obey your master!
Row!
Your bones are breaking while you-
Row!
We should be going faster
Row!
The whip will crack your back now
Row!

And everything you thought was true
And now you're sittin' on the
Cemetary stone- you can't move
I never said that I would row
It didn't matter
