[16x] Dressed as goblins!

Dressed as goblins!
Nice to see the friends
Dressed as goblins!
Do it all again!
Dressed as goblins!
Nice to see the friends
Dressed as goblins!
Do it all again!
See the friends all again!
See the friends all again!

But in a way itâs all so surreal and cerebral!
Iâm tryinâ to feel good-
Iâm digginâ the tempo- another memento
For my long lost dream of life
On the outside lookinâ in
Iâve got a power struggle- I canât wait to win
Weâre in a different dimension (weâre in a different dimension)-
A dimension where youâre still a fish!

Try to breathe- donât need to speak to me!
Hang on to the sights and sounds!
Time is passing fast
And I never want this world to end!

Life- what a fuckinâ joke!
Ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha
Boom- now we all explode!
Ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha

[8x] Dressed as goblins!

Dressed as goblins
We are at the show!
Dressed as goblins
Now we all explode!
Dressed as goblins
We are at the show!
Dressed as goblins
Now we all explode!
At the show, all explode!
At the show, all explode!

In a different way itâs all too real-
Iâm still tryinâ to feel good
Winninâ or losinâ- another illusion-
Another distraction from a bygone way of life
On the inside lookinâ out-
I got a feeling itâs too late for me to pull out
From the other dimension- itâs a different dimension-
A dimension full of nasty pricks!

Try to breathe- donât even to speak to me!
Hang on to the sights and sounds
Time is passing fast
And I never want this world to end!

Life- what a fuckinâ joke!
Ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha
Boom- now we all explode!
Ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha

Oh, when the end has come around
Oh, when the world has let you down
And thereâs nothing to keep you going...
And all your dreams have come to pass-
You never knew life went so fast
Now you see everybody...

Dressed as goblins!
Now itâs time to die!
Dressed as goblins!
Thereâs no reason why!
Dressed as goblins!
Now itâs time to die!
Dressed as goblins!
Thereâs no reason why!
Time to die- reason why!
Time to die- reason why!
