I've been spendin' too much time with goblins
(Woah-oh-oh-ohhh!)
I hear them whispering to me
Every time I try to solve a problem, oh-oh
There's just another goblin, alright!
Just another goblin in my life!

Oh-oh-oh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh...
Oh-oh-oh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh...
Oh-oh-oh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh...
Oh-oh-oh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh...

It's a new day
A time for reconstruction
And time to gain a function
(But here comes a goblin!)
Everywhere I look
There's just another one
(Looking at me!)
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
(They're laughing at me!)

I spend my life surrounded by goblins
I may seem surreal, but it's real to me
(It's all so real to me)
And every time I've got a problem
There's only goblins there for me

The goblins came
They came from space
But they were looking for another place
But now they're here-
And they want to destroy the humans!
But I guess that's fine with me...

I spend my life surrounded by goblins
I may seem surreal, but it's real to me
(It's all so real to me)
And every time I've got a problem
There's always goblins there for me
(They're always watching me)

10,000 years in space in goblins
(They tortured me)
I hear them laughing in my sleep
(Hahahahaaa!)
But everybody tells me I've got problems, uh-huh!
They don't believe in goblins like me-
They don't know that goblins are real!

I still believe in goblins!
(I still believe in goblins)
I still believe in goblins!
I still believe in goblins!
(I still believe in goblins)
I still believe in me...
But mainly goblins


I still believe in goblins!
(I still believe in goblins)
I still believe in goblins!
I still believe in goblins!
I still believe in goblins!
(I still believe in goblins)
I still believe in me...
...and the goblins

(I've got the problem)
I still believe in goblins!
(I've got the problem)
(I've got the goblins)
(I've got the goblins)
I've got the goblins!
(I've got the goblins)
I still believe in goblins!
(I've got the goblins)
(I've got the goblins)
I've got the goblins!
(I've got the goblins)
I still believe in goblins!

I've got the goblins!
(I've got the goblins)
I've got the goblins!
(I've got the goblins)
I've got the goblins!
(I've got the goblins)
(I've got the goblins)
(I've got the goblins)
(I've got the goblins)
