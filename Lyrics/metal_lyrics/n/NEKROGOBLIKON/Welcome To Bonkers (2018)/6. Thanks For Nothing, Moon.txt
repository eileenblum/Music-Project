Moon is rising-
Hi, I'm doing well
Ain't this quite the lie?
Now where in Hell!
Moon is on the move
Is with the times
Moon will not forget-
Is not a lie

And you say 'Goodnight Moon'
It's looking out for me!
But I say goddamned Moon!
You're a goddamned thief!

Looking up at the Moon!

Well I wanna say I'm a reasonable guy
But don't cross me, Moon!
I wanna say I'm a lunar dude
But don't test me
I'm all about the sun!

Looking up at the Moon
Sometimes I want to proclaim
Life is over too soon
And everything is the same
The Moon up in space
The tides below
(And you'll never be home!)

And you think "This will pass!
This is life
And I am the master!"
Well I got news for you!
You're a goddamned fool

Every time that you speak!
I feel a burning irritation
In my bowels!
So don't talk to me!
I wanna say you're an alright dude
But don't test me
I'm not about to lie!

Looking up at the Moon
Sometimes I want to proclaim
Life is over too soon
And everything is the same
The Moon up in space
The tides below
(And you'll never be home!)

Thinking back to the days
When I used to trust the Moon...
It all seemed so alive!
But then reality exploded
And I lost my mind!

Now that the Moon
Is in my past!
I realize most things
Will never last
Now that the Moon
Is cached and banged out
I realize it's a cosmic hyper-drought!

You think that you understand
The Moon will not believe
You're gone so soon
I'll curse the Moon

(We all know about the Moon.)

Looking up at the Moon
Sometimes I want to proclaim
Life is over too soon
And everything is the same
The Moon up in space
The tides below
(And you'll never be home!)

Looking up at the Moon
Sometimes I want to proclaim
Life is over too soon
And everything is the same
The Moon up in space
The tides below
(And you'll never be home!)

Now I'm sitting alone
In a hotel room
With a bottle of scotch
And a cheap prostitute!
Well I'm thinking about
My life so far
And everything I'll never be!

When I see the Moon on high
And he's smiling at the night
Well I think to myself
Thanks for nothing, Moon!

Viewing the Moon
As a cosmic inanimate object
I'm forced to say
Fuck you!
