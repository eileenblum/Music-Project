There's a house on a hill with a thief inside
And he's looking for a coat that'll fit just right
Why won't you let me try them on
Why won't you let me try them on?

Childhood
I'm always thinking about childhood
Whoooaaa

It happened again
I can't remember the last thing I did
Blood is on my hands
Screams are ringing in my ears
And I'm covered in skin
Blanket me in this epidermal epiphany
This is my fate
I am the skin thief

There's a house on a hill
Where the thief does hide
With a brand new coat
And it fits just right
You never would let me try them on
You never let me try them on

Childhood
God damn you childhood

It's happening now
But I don't ever remember the screams or the howls
Death is flashing in my eyes
When I'm covered in skin
Blanket me in this epidermal epiphany
This is my fate
I am the skin thief

I once met a boy
Walking alone in the snow with no coat
Momma said no
(Mom said no)

And that's when I froze
I just wanted clothes
Mother never gave it
I just needed a coat
Now I make them from skin
This has become my way
I am the skin thief

Blanket me in this epidermal epiphany
This is your face
I am the skin thief
Well it tortures me
Just one look in my eyes, you will see
Well this is my fate
But I'm still the skin thief
