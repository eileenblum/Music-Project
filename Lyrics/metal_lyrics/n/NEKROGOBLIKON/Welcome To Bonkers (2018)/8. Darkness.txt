I can't escape the Darkness!
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-Darkness!
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-Darkness!
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-Darkness!
D-dark-d-dark-dark!

It turns out
Everything is bullshit!
Egregious
Self-satisfied!
But I've been trying
Not to think like that, no!
I gotta be positive!
There's a lot of good things
About life, woah-woah!
It's been a hell of a ride so far
And there's still more to go (Woah-woah)!

I've been trying for a while
Can't even bring myself to smile
It's like dyin' for a cause
That I do not believe in

I try to understand the Light
I try to fall asleep at night
I'm givin' her all she's got
And I don't wanna fail!

But I need some Darkness!
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-Darkness!
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-Darkness!
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-Darkness!
D-dark-d-dark-dark!

After all these years
I'd been hoping for glimpse
Of the other side
I spent a lot of time
On the good stuff
Just to learn (Woah-woah!)
Well maybe that's not my ride!
I try and try and try and try!
And then it all starts over
Again, and again, and again!
I ask myself why!?
(Why-why-why?)
Why do I even pretend!?

I was trying for a minute
But that was before I found sin
And now that I have I'm not sure
I wanna go back again!

I tried to understand the Light
Never fell asleep at night
I did what I could
With what I had!

But I gotta have Darkness!
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-Darkness!
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-Darkness!
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-Darkness!
D-dark-d-dark-dark!

Now the time has come!
Day is on the run!
Night has fallen now for good
Just like I always knew it would!
Hope you said goodbye to Light
Because it's in the past!
It was never going to last!
Now the sky is black
And everything's falling down
Life is like a lost and found-
Sometimes you get lucky
And the world is black!

Woah!

How can I feel this way?
I thought the Light was
Here to stay (Here to stay)!
But now the Darkness-
D-d-d-d-Darkness-
Here for good-
I knew it would
But I thought
I might have Light...

...I will have Darkness!
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-Darkness!
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-Darkness!
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-Darkness!
D-dark-d-dark-Dark!
