13.7 billion years ago
Something terrible happened
And everything snapped into phase!
The universe was born-
Humanity was doomed!

4.6 billion years ago
There was a terrible rock
Floating through space
And then it stopped
And it began to spin!

Time:
It's always such a waste
At an exponential pace!
We're trapped inside the world
Killing time and space!

Burning down the walls
And tearing down the doors
Have you had enough?
Well I want some more!
Did you really think that
This had meaning?
There's no difference
Between life and dreaming!
Go!

About 16 million years ago
Some apes decided they'd be
Better off terrible
Now the world is dead and rotten
And the apes are long forgotten

But here we are
In spite of all odds
While you check your phone
And there's a guy named Todd
And the world has gone to Hell
'Cause I'm not about to die!

It's always such a waste
At an exponential pace!
We're trapped inside the world
Killing time and space!

The clock is ticking
But I'm talking to you now
You never understood
The world is round
Let's take it to a flat place this time
I have had enough of your face- please die!

Time:
It's always such a waste
At an exponential pace!
We're trapped inside the world
Killing time and space!

Time:
It's always such a waste
At an exponential pace!
We're trapped inside the world
Killing time and space!
