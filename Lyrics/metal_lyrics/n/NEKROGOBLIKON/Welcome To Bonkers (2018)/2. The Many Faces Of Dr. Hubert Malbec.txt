Hey now, what do you know?
It's time to go again
Time to go pretend
I'm a typical man
But in my head I'm going bonkers-
Everything is awkward-
Please don't look me in the eye!
I'm about ready for another episode
Yeah, my head's about to fucking explode!

But I'll bide my time
And try to find a way
To keep it bottled up inside

How long can I hold on
To this mask of sanity?
What is happening to me?
How long can I fool the world?
How long can I fool the world?

Every day of my life is a goddamned sham
'Yes sir, no sir, thank you ma'am!
How do you do
Have you got the time?'
No, No, No, No!
I do not believe there's
Any saving me!
(Nor do I wish there was)

But I'll bide my time
And try to find a way
To keep it bottled up inside

How long can I hold on
To this mask of sanity?
What is happening to me?
How long can I fool the world?
How long can I fool the world?

How long can I hold on
To this mask of sanity?
What is happening to me?
How long can I fool the world?
How long can I fool the world?

I cannot imagine
The gall it took
To say what you said!
(Say what you said!)
But nevertheless you're a fool
And I could never see the world
The same way as you-
Don't seem to appreciate the world!
And I got a lot of shit to do!
The clock has not stopped for this time;
I'll just be passing through!

How long can I hold on
To this mask of sanity?
What is happening to me?
How long can I fool the world?
How long can I fool the world?
(Will I fool the world?)

How long have I held on
To this goddamned state of mind
(Losing one thing at a time)?
How long can I fool the world?
How long can I fool the world?
