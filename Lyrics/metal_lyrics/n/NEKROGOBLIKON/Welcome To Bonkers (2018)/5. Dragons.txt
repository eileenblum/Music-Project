You talk a lotta crap
Never mind the bull
You think you're swell?
You're full of shit!
I don't want to hear your goddamn lies
No more, no more!

Will I be blinded, deafened, and dumb
By the motherfuckin' walls
You erected when you
Still thought we were chums? (Ooh)!

I found the writing on the walls
I could hardly believe what I saw!
As I ran to tell the others
Thunder crashed and lightning
Cracked the sky!
And then there was a hole!
And then a voice says
"Yo! Listen
This is all for you!
Trust me!"

But still
I don't believe
It was ever for me
Why can't you see?
Listen!

There's a dragon ripping you to shreds
It wants to be your friend
It's just trying to impress you
So won't you let it be
Let it be!

There's a goblin dancing in your head
He's dancing for the end
I'm only being honest
So won't you let it be
Let it be!

I remember finding writings
On a certain wall (a certain wall)!
This was before the time when
I knew anything at all
But now the times have changed (uh huh)!
Now I know everything (alright)!
All I can say is
The writings make me
Feel the same!

So where do I place the blame?
Has this always been a game?
I'm tempted to believe
I want to give you everything!

But still
I don't believe
It was ever for me
Why can't you see?
Listen!

There's a dragon ripping you to shreds
It wants to be your friend
It's just trying to impress you
So won't you let it be
Let it be!

There's a goblin dancing in your head
He's dancing for the end
I'm only being honest
So won't you let it be
Let it be!

There's a dragon ripping you to shreds
It wants to be your friend
It's just trying to impress you
So won't you let it be
Let it be!

There's a goblin dancing in your head
He's dancing for the end
I'm only being honest
So won't you let it be
Let it be!

Oh, little dragon in the sky!
A dragon made of dreams!
Take the dragon's wing!
And together you'll fly across the night
So far beyond the light!
Let the dragon take you home!
