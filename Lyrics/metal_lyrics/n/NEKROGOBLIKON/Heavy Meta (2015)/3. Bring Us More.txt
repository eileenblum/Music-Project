yow!
come on, come on
alright, alright nowâ¦
itâs time to get fucked up
they tried living in peace, it didnât go so well
they tried being at ease, but it was boring as hell
so now itâs time to turn around and try the opposite approach...
heavy drinking sex and drugs and gambling and violence!
bring it to me
itâs time I had it all
moderation is a fallacy
weâre not waiting for the fall (or are we waiting on the fall?)
sinking deeper in
Iâm rising higher than Iâve
ever been before
so kill this conscience-clad delirium
and bring us more
now theyâve got some more (more)
and they all rejoice (more)
they just want some more (more)
this is purely by choice
whatever it is,
they want more than one
because life is dull
when you donât have fun
so they bide their time,
because theyâre never gonna die
might as well take an eon
and just get high
bring it to me
itâs time (I had it all)
moderation is a fallacy
weâre not waiting for the fall (or are we waiting on the fall?)
sinking deeper in
Iâm rising higher than Iâve ever been before
so kill this conscience-clad delirium
and bring us more
why?!
itâs wearing off
our problems were supposed to be solved
but theyâre not, weâre still alive
so letâs do some more
hurry up and bring it here
thereâs no time to waste
weâre getting angry
getting conscious &amp; getting bored
wait, I think itâs working
yow
that was a good call
now weâre definitely gonna be happyâ¦ forever
now the gutterâs overflown
and the streets are flooded
with the bile of the drunk
and the blood of the gutted
what in godâs name is this shit?
and what have we been thinking?
who gives?!
letâs just take another hit
and keep on drinking
bring it to me
itâs time (I had it all)
moderation is a fallacy
weâre not waiting for the fall (or are we waiting on the fall?)
sinking deeper in
Iâm rising higher than Iâve
ever been before
kill this conscience-clad delirium
