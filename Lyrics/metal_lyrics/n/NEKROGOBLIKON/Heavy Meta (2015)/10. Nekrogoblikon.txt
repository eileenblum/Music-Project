DIE!!
theyâve finally got the book
what a glorious day
things are going their way
enraptured
lost in the pages
inked in blood &amp; bound with the ages
searching
for the passage that they need
hope is fading fast
there is oh so much to read
will they ever make it past the sleeve?
as their eyes begin to bleed;
they see the symbols in between
YES!!!
these are the words
weâve found the passage in the sacred book
the celebrationâs in full swing
1, 2, 3 cheers for the goblin king
wait, stop the press, double-check the page
it says we need a band, to take the stage
to enact the rites, they must be sung
the band we need is Nekrogoblikon
a rag-tag bunch of hideous scum
...theyâre already on the way
they found a way
they found a way
weâll never see
another day
they found the magic Nekrogoblikon!
and it all ends
as it begins
infinity repeats again
they found the magic Nekrogoblikon!
weâve got to get the loudest guitars
the loudest drums
crank those microphones
if your ears arenât bleeding, youâre doing it wrong
we could also try a keyboard
and maybe a bass
weâll set a stage up on the moon
the rites require ample space
â¦PLAY!!
we are Nekrogoblikon
weâve come a long long way
just to play you this song
they stacked the deck against us,
but we learned to count the cards
they wanted to destroy us,
now letâs send them our regards
well now itâs over
the show is done
itâd be a lie to say that we didnât have fun
weâve laughed, weâve cried, and now weâll die
(I guess)
weâll see you on the other sideâ¦
they found a way
they found a way
weâll never see
another day
they found the magic Nekrogoblikon!
and it all ends
as it begins
infinity repeats again
they found the magic Nekrogoblikon!
