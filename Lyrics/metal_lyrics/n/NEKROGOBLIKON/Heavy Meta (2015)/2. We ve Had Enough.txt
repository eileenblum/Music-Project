It begins
Just a little too perfect
Somethingâs amiss
And we donât know why
It feels like weâre aging
Constant raging, never better
Everything is fine
...yeah, right

Never known a conflict
Never had a need
Never lost a friend
Because we always agreed
Never disregard the need for turmoil
Eternity is just around the corner

In the beginning
The goblins were born
Peaceful and pure
Knowing and wise
Caring and true
You get the point
The point is the end that you stick in the enemy

In the beginning,
Life plodded on
Honest and fair
Knowing no lies
Humble and good
Faithful and kind
Dreadfully dreary, reality-blind

What does it mean to be alive?
And would it mean anything at all 
If we were never gonna die?

Now timeâs moving on
Theyâre still getting on
But somethingâs been bugging them all along
Canât shake the feeling
That something is wrong
Life is so boring when we get along

Immortal in eden
Surrounded by cretins
They wait for the answer
They start to feel beaten
Venturing into the dark
Canât wait for the bite if you don't hear the bark

What does it mean to be alive?
And would it mean anything at all 
If we were never gonna die?
Throw it away, what's left to need
When youâve got infinity
So much out there left to find
We'll do that some other time

But everyone gets restless
And all things must pass
What was once perfection
Was too good
Too good to last

What does it mean to be alive?
And would it mean anything at all 
If we were never gonna die?
Throw it away, what's left to need
When youâve got infinity
So much out there left to find
We'll do that some other time

Twist it up!
Bring us a conflict
Itâs all that we need
Goodbye to so-called friends
Because we never agreed
Itâs time for drugs and sex and violence
A life of excess and mindless highness
