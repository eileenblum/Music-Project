What do we need?
What do we need?
I wish someone would tell us what we need!

We need a gimmick
Pretty little gimmick
A fool-proof plan to gain the trust
Of the human race
After allâ¦ 
We come from outer space
(and we smell like shit!)
No more shame; itâs time for fame
Nothinâ to lose, everything to gain

Weâve seen it, heard it, felt it, thought it, sought it
Lived it all before
Weâve read it, watched it, bought it, stole it, sold it
Now we just want more
Listen up!
We wonât be let down anymore

Now theyâve got a killer plan
And it just might be crazy enough to work

When it all began
They were desperate, they were prideful
They were reckless, pitiful scum (and never mindful)
Never thought enough to realize that
Everything is just a joke

Weâre at it again
Just us and the friends
We know what this is
No need to lie
We push that boulder up the hill... 

We need a gimmick
Squishy little gimmick
The perfect way to win the heart 
Of the human race
After allâ¦ 
They live in the comfort zone
(and theyâre a bunch of dicks!)
Watch them watch themselves on hi-def plasma television screens
We made a human costume for a goblin
Best to hide the green

Now theyâve got a killer plan
And it just might be crazy enough to work

When it all began
They were desperate, they were prideful
They were reckless, pitiful scum (and never mindful)
Never thought enough to realize that
Everything is just a joke

But that was then...

Now theyâve got a clever plan
And it ainât half-bad
itâs got to work;
itâs just what they need
They are temperate, they are mindful
They are zealous, wonderful chums (took off the blindfold)
Never thought enough to realize that
Everything is still a joke

Weâre at it again
Just us and the friends
We know what this is
No need to lie
We push that boulder up the hill... 
...but then it rolls back down again

Over and over
The coldest of shoulders 
They're missing the point
Misguided drones
They keep checking their phones
As if it really fuckinâ matters...

We skinned a dog to make its hair
We peeled a preschool and stole their skin
Wow, ainât he looking debonair
Just smash the face, heâll blend right in

Ooh! now heâs getting on the ship
We built a rocket, to send him to earth
No need to freak, itâs just a trip
I think itâs about time you got a grip

Weâre at it again
Just us and the friends
We know what this is
No need to lie
We push that boulder up the hill... 
...but then it rolls back down again

Over and over
The coldest of shoulders 
They're missing the point
Misguided drones
They keep checking their phones
As if it really fuckinâ matters...

What do we got?
What do we got?

â¦a gimmick!
