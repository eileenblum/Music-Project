that was not a good call
we feel like balls
we took it too far
tell me where we are
what do we do now?
I thought we had it
figured out, but we donât
we could do yoga
we could try sports
letâs just eat snax
(so we donât have to snort)
snax are the best!
what a broad selection!
name your confection!
this is nothing short of perfection
-hold the phone!
we forgot about the violence...
nothing goes better with snax
than a little bit of
good olâ fashioned bloodshed
so hereâs what you do:
combine the two you
can save some face,
and eat it too
designer snax- theyâre so far out
colorful snax- well they just stand out
credible snax- but can you trust them?
violent snax, yes- these are just the ones!
stripping flesh from bone
(youâre awake, but canât scream with no tongue)
youâll never make it home
(meat falls off the bone)
now that theyâve realized
the power lies in snax
they wonât be stopped
again theyâve got the answer now
snax snax snax snax
&amp; violence
one among them sows the doubt
ainât it great, wow
(why)
why am i me?
everything is so unfair!
why does god hate only me?!
ooh! active snax- get off your ass
ah! delicate snax- try to watch the grass
scree! hateful snax- you become what you choose
violent snax, yes- these are just the ones!
light is shining through
(the follicles of the skin from your arm)
it will never get to you
(plucked your eyes right outtaâ your skull)
now that theyâve realized
the power lies in snax
they wonât be stopped
again theyâve got the answer now
snax snax snax snax
&amp; violence
now theyâre full; the doubt is sown
ainât it great, wow
now that theyâve realized
the power lies in snax
they wonât be stopped
again theyâve got the answer now
snax snax snax snax
&amp; violence
what do we need?
I wish someone would tell us what we need
