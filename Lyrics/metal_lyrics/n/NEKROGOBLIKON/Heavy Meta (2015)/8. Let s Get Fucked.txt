everyone gets restless, and all things must pass
moderation is a fallacy
dead! itâs what weâre gonna be
we will not obey your ego trip
we will not respect your authority
we wonât comply with your status quo
we will never accept your reality
an empire built on petty theft
and now you cling to nothing
like a puppet master, but all thatâs left
are the strings attached
did you really expect that weâd believe
in your falsified idolatry?
the tides will shift and the sand will fall
but youâve got no right to have us all
they will not hold us down
theyâll never succeed; theyâre born of greed
never thought a little gimmick such as this would go so well
why does god hate only me?
theyâll be laughing theyâll be dancing âcause the world is going
this is the end of infinity
we do not curtsy before your illusion
we do not validate your exclusion
so why deny the thriving hive mind?
you can no longer control us
a pompous way of life gone by
we know it was there but canât remember why
from this perspective, it all just seems so trivial and complex
some propaganda memoranda fascist days of futureâs past
would never last
they will not hold us down
theyâll never succeed; theyâre born of greed
everything is just a joke, hold the phone
it cannot be, it wonât be allowed
to enact the rites, they must be sung
in a moment weâll all be one
you had your time and
you squeezed it dry
now youâre off the throne and
you donât know why
you were so fair,
you were so kind,
you were oh so honest.
LIES! you were trading souls for paper,
raping hopes and chasing favor
selling prophecies of gold
scratched on thrown-out cardboard
well now itâs time to meet the maker,
you had hope, but now itâs wavered
youâve got nothing you can keep
(only one thing left to do)
letâs get a party goinâ (get a goblin party goinâ)
we donât need your opinion to have fun
letâs get a party goinâ (get a goblin party goinâ)
we will never respect you, ya got that?
letâs get a party goinâ (get a goblin party goinâ)
if not, then why did you come?
letâs get a party goinâ (get a goblin party goinâ)
life is a joke, so letâs have fun
weâll find a way to corrupt this too
cause thatâs what time is meant to do
try not to think, but try to do
and letâs enjoy it while it lasts
