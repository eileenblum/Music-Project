babies, children, women and men
get ready to implode on the count of ten
one two ten
pulled together
from every direction
as we penetrate reality
thereâs no protection
death to the minister and
death to the scum
death to Satan
holy father and the sun
none shall be spared
including ourselves
goblin immortality invalidating time well spent
well weâre sick of it, sick to death
doesnât matter if itâs right, cause itâs all we got left
itâs time for space and time to go
the black hole sucks cause reality blows
no distinction; you and me
this is the end of infinity
hope you had a decent life
hope your burdens didnât weigh you down too much
hope you let the bygones by
hope you didnât take no crap
hope you lived with no regrets and had good luck
hope you got to say goodbye
hope you realized that hope is just a lie
a forgotten ideal from a time when life meant more
more than four on the floor, designer booze and whores
but really, it couldnât matter less
itâs time for space and time to go
the black hole sucks cause reality blows
no distinction; you and me
this is the end of infinity
so cry no more and have some fun
in a moment weâll all be one
no distinction; you and me
this is the end of infinity
into the whirlpool of the void
we are all drawn
weâve had enough of nothing
now everything will be gone
itâs time for space and time to go
the black hole sucks cause reality blows
no distinction; you and me
this is the end of infinity
ooh
goodbye now
the necessary preparations are made
the goblins are enjoying a massive parade
and everything thatâs always held them down
is over
NOW
the spiral is unravelling
feathered ends ignite
witness the end of infinity
tonight
so cry no more and have some fun in a moment weâll
all be one no distinction; you and me
this is the end of infinity
wanna see you smile
donât wanna see you frown
because eventually it comes back around
but letâs just pretend, because until then
this is the end of infinity
