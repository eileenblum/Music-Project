weâd had quite enough
then you brought us more
next we found snax were the hangoverâs cure
but still our hearts sunk;
deep into the funk
on with the gimmick, itâs oh so much fun
a devious plan;
the humans were fans...
till full body xplosion made them go bam
an empire fell
right back into hell
but we hate our selves
cursed with this wretched immortality
dead! itâs all I want to be
legend tells of an ancient book
hiding somewhere in the stars
with the words to set us free
the power to end infinity
I cannot get this foul taste
out of my mouth
I spit and I gargle
but all the same
itâs all the same
weâve tried everything we could think
but weâre still not alright
now begins our quest for the book
the Nekrogoblikon!
so into the stars we go
sweet freedomâs evaded us
never a place for us
done with this wretched immortality
dead! itâs what weâre gonna be
legend tells of an ancient book
hiding somewhere in the stars
with the words to set us free
the power to end infinity
aboard the starship filth is king
weâre not ashamed of the life we refuse to lead
we quit keeping up appearances
a trillion years ago
now itâs time to swing and let it all hang out
to show god what weâre all about
I been up, I been down, and weâve been all around
but thisâ¦
this is the final mood swing
the last place we looked
the place we began (with a bang)
at last! the book is in hand!
salvation found (in the deepest black hole)
in nothing, weâre finally whole
nekrogoblikon, the tome as written
the nekro race is smitten
the nekro race is over
done
nekrogoblikon has won
