"Youâre ridinâ on a sinking ship
itâs ahead of its time
It cannot be
It wonât be allowed"

You may be right
But weâre too proud
To back down
Weâd rather drown
Weâd rather die
Than be alive
And throw it all away
Because someone else said 
It shouldnât be this way
We will not throw it away
Because someone else said 
It shouldnât be this way

Drink the standing water
You deserve what you believe 
So go ahead and taste the fetid water
But me? Iâll drink from the stream

Drink the standing water
You deserve what you believe 
So fucking drown in the fetid water
But me? Iâll drink from the stream
