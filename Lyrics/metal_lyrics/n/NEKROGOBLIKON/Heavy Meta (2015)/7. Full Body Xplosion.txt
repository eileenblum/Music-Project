It worked!

BOOM!
Full body explosion
Hate into joy
Deathâs the quotient
At last!
They drank the potion
The plan is in motion
And the days are numbered
The goblins are unencumbered
Never thought a little gimmick such as this
Would go so well
Theyâll be laughing
Theyâll be dancing
'Cause the world is goingâ¦

BOOM!
Full body explosion

Never die
Never gonna die
Never gonna die
Still alive, fuck
Wanna die, but weâre just fine
Gotta quit
Really gotta quit
Really gotta quit
Still afflicted
Gotta quit but we canât so

Heâs got the news
The die are cast
Inform the friends
The futureâs passed

Global explosion, a million hits
Tainted souls, who gives a shit
Drank the kool-aid, yakked it up
We made it on our own now lap it up

BOOM!
Full body explosion

They sold the tonic,
'cross the land
Planted the seed
Then soiled the plant
Theyâre watching humans exploding
Another painful reminder

Never die
Never gonna die
Never gonna die
Still alive, fuck
Wanna die, but weâre just fine

Gotta quit
Really gotta quit
Really gotta quit
Still afflicted
Gotta quit but we canât so

They watch reality TV
Theyâve got an app to track the spleens

Global explosion, a million hits 
Tainted souls, who gives a shit
Drank the kool-aid, yakked it up
We made it on our own, now lap it up
Total repulsion, in the pits
Drink it down
Full body explosion

I just cleaned her off my shirt
Why did she pop? They canât explain
The evening news has no report
We all just fertilize the dirt
All around me people blow
Tell me whenâs my time to go
Tell me
Whenâs my time to go

BOOM!
Full body explosion

Global explosion, a million hits
Tainted souls, who gives a shit
Drank the kool-aid, yakked it up
We made it on our own, now lap it up
Total repulsion, in the pits
Drink it down
Full body explosion

Never die never die
We will not die
