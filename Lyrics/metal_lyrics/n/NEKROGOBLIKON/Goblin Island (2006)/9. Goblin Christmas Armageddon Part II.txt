And finally the slaughter stops,
The mighty axe of christmas chops.
A glorious tree to celebrate,
Mankind has finally met his fate.

This is a goblin christmas,
This is a goblin christmas.
This is a goblin christmas,
This is a goblin christmas.

Happiness and joy fill the brisk winter air.
Golden rays of sunlight shine down without a care.
But wait, what's this, a human child, with dimpled little cheeks -
Tear his tender flesh off and we'll feast upon his meat.

After the onset of nuclear winter,
(Nuclear winter...)
The wonderful denizens of goblin town,
(Goblin town...)
Frolic about the countryside and nothing gets them down,
(And nothing gets them down...)
Don't wear a frown, because dear friendc, this town is goblin town.
(Goblin town, goblin town, goblin town...)
Joy and festivities are everywhere,
(Goblin town, goblin town, Don't wear a frown in goblin town!)
So let's go watch the goblin clown!
(Goblin town, goblin town, Don't wear a frown in goblin town!)

This is a goblin christmas,
This is a goblin christmas.
This is a goblin christmas,
This is a goblin christmas.
