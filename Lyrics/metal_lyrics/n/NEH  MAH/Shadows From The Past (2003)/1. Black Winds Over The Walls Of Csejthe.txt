Countess all dressed in red, forsaken in your fortress in the heart of dark mountains,
lulled by the crying crows, your waiting for the return of he who made your heart beat,
until losing rest forever, to believe tedieum... Your eyes are so black, the evil was
already inside you.. Oh, bloody countess, for ten years of eternity, each fallen night,
maidens where brought to you, the sight of their innocent bodies, fired your devilish eyes,
the thought of drinking their blood, driven to madness, tortured and bled to death sixty
bodies were found at dawn deprived their bloods and souls.. This time, wolves did not
come to the frozen feast, woman of dark desires, now your perversity has come to light!...
Eternal Sleep...
