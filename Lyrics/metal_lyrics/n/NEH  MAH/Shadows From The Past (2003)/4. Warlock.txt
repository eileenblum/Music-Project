I have drunk the smelly christian blood of one thousand pregnant women, twisted their
pitiful lifes and their souls in order to burst in the nothingness. All that I touch and
contemplate must slowly perish in suffering,I am the wizard born from a blazing coal,
inhabiting the tombs of the human kind!... No prayer can save you, the nights are too

shred your spirit, on your face shines the cadaveric reflection, this life breathes anguish,
soon the moon will light up the marble of your grave on which I will drop dispair flower...
the shining stars of heaven dye my icy eyes, my scorn for the mortals is rocked by the
angels cries! Ravens...
