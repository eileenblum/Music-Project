A rain of tears streams down what was my face, the last sparkling stars in this
gloomy ocean.. All is darkening, blackness covers the sky and falls to earth,
merging with the dark poison which rises from the depths of my naked soul...
Shadows from the past dancing in dark flames, under the silent and icy reflection
of the moon, before disappearing in the nauseous swamp in which everything ends...
