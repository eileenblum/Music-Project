You gave me everything I wanted...
Everything I need...
Sometimes I think I like the pain...
I think I like the Speed...
Mission to make me feel the pain...
I never had a chance...
I reach my hand into the dark...
And watch the specters dance...

Visions haunt, in the light of day or in the night...
It feels as if every choice made just wasn't right...
A wretched hive of lying snakes whispers in my ear...
Brooding Clouds, weeping stars, all visions of the seer...

Source of everlasting evil, Bring unholy death...
With two great horns to strike me down, I take my final breath...
Right through my heart, the wound is quick and clean before my sight...
In the presence of the temptress, having visions in the night...

Shake my soul down to its core, leave me wanting even more...
If I could warn myself before, kill this motherfucking whore...
I stood there with a choice to make, do it now for heaven's sake...
The ones who die are innocent, pay for choices we don't... make...

Reach for my hand on this magical night...
We'll run through the woods with the wolves 'til first light...
Recalling a time when a soul could walk free...
Break through the chains of Society...

Skin pale as snow like a ghost in the night...
You've casted a spell and poisoned my sight...
When beauty and darkness align for true pain...
The wicked Ludmilla emerges again...

Whoa... Ludmilla !
The Wicked Ludmilla emerges again...

Blacken the skies with your longing for death
Ludmilla's still watching with every last breath.
Her Basilisk Demons to crush you tonight.
Mysterium winters of unholy light...
