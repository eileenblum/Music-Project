I Walk, Through the forest.
Life was precious, I'm petrified.
The Ancient ways, so long ago.
When the Rains, have all but died.
Recall your dreams you thought were dead.
'Tis said there is no point to look ahead
In a twilight mountain dream.
The groves are my temple, the stars are my guide
The leaves fall echoing, a melody inside.

The moon doth shine
Tonight we die
Wolves surround their prey
A timeless dance depraved.

Reach for the stars
At least you'll see the moon
To touch death, you'll find out soon...

A midsummer moon...
But not a creature in my sights
Of those souls
More and more will fight
A midsummer moon...

The forest weeps where barren land lays
I'm wandering through the 'fore told wooded path
An evergreen sprout where tall pines ruled
Dark and dripping blood scent of ghouls

To walk the lesser of treated paths
As it seems to lead me into these woods.
Return to wild nature, a desolate plain
Where I stood on evergreen hills.
