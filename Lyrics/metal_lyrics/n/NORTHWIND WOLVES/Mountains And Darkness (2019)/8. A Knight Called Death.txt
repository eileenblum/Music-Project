To seek my extinction without fore-going pain...
I curse thee to life, embrace your domain...

Withdrawal of wonders, departure of civility...
I pierce the veil to enter death, Skylark in my tranquility...

By the look on your face.
Those tears that you hide.
Your epilogue unheard.
Pass through suicide.

Fast Rode the Knight, with a hand on his sword.
Wearily, Drearily, vanquish the horde.
Honor and hope, through the valley of Death.
With a Shield on my back, to block dragon's breath.

The Soldier who perished, so long ago.
The power of Death, will overflow.
Breathless we gaze at the slain on the ground.
Just beautiful insects which scurry...
Around!

Leave not the weakest to perish tonight.
Take on aggressors in one final fight.
Knighthood alone is the path that I seek.

Justice and Honor, mixed in there too.
Cut down through the wicked and those who cursed you
Knights who ride east and those who ride west.
A tragedies' end again and again.
