Over the Horizon, Voices thunder to my soul...	
A Deathly wind crept down the field, like northern Orioles...
A Dungeon in winter, an encounter with the past...
Unhallowed face the sunset, in pure iconoclast...

Dusk in Harshest winter when mountain blossoms mourn the sun...
The rivers flow down steps of stone, conforming every one...
Mountains Brood this winter, grim tidings for the land...
Death descends on us tonight, comply with my demands...

Earth Still...
Come with me to another time...
Behold the wonders of fresh blood...
As I am now, you soon will be...
Through the veil of death to eternity...

The wind will give me the strength to fight...

Reminisce of Lightning skies, and we'll hope to touch the heavens still...
First cold chill by the afternoon, and you'd trade your sword for a tablespoon?

Like a bell in the night, a machine dealing death, removing souls from living flesh.
Like torture has my absence been from thee, deep in the caverns for eternity.
The frost is growing, its specter white. Death reaches all beyond my sight.

Years of Anger Flow, breathing dragon's breath.
And everything I do brings me closer to death.

I am the final witness, the storm came rollin' in...
Lightning strikes across the skies, hell comes from within...
I've always hated nightmares, dimension known as Hell...
The Lord of evil lies in wait, His Dominion you will dwell...
Pray to Idols from the past, Feel his endless fucking wrath...
I dedicate this mortal strike, to those that you maligned...

On the Dark Black day on a very windy night...
Thunder Crackles from afar, a petrifying sight...

Death... Descends on wings... of Unholy Fire...
