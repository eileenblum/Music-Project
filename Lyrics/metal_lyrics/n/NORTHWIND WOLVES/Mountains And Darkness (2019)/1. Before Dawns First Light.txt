The Snow-Capped Mountains in the distance that night
The Spider's web shone like crystal Ice
With crystal Ice...
The Angels cry the world will burn....
Burn...

Night will turn to day...
I'd hope the rain would fall today ...
As the sun fades from me...
Look to the moon in the night...
Before the Dawn's first light...

I See myself in your ways...
Yet theirs so much to learn...
Is it Evil who rules the day?
Or will the Daylight Return?
The Mountains surround us, the guardians live on...
Warriors with the strength to fight...
A hatred til' the final dawn...
The crow will sing our final song...

'Til death descends and I slip away...
No more regrets 'cause I'm here to stay
I'm in your corner and I'll Be by your side
I'm so Fucking evil, I know that you lied
The venom in my fangs now on your breath
The Sun is Fading, Prepare for your Death.

Look to the moon in the night...
Before the Dawn's first light...
