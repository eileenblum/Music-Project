There was a place... a long time ago...
Above the Clouds... On Peaks of Snow...
Take my hand and we'll begin to fly...
Among the crows and we'll never die...

Far above the skies tonight
The Darkness fades
And the stars burn bright to light our way.

Past the cavern of hell's delights
You'll find me there, I've had my fill
Chased out again for causing a fuss

It was so dark... So dark of night...
There was no chance at all to light
A light at all to help me see
With the black of night surrounding me...

Why do we cry when death has come?
You live your life like it's nearly done.
Beneath the moon, and clouded skies
I take a Breath and close my eyes.

Look above is that a star see?
The one that seems to stare right back at me.
Come with me on this winter's night.
Even though you know we'll surely die.

The stars will fall from the skies tonight.
The stars will fall and we'll watch them die.
A death that I can not transcend.
I always knew this is how it ends.

Come with me on this winter's night.
Even though you know we'll surely die.
Tonight...
