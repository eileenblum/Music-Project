'Tis a wonderful time when the Shadows are long...
The two of us drink where the vermin belong...
Gently I stir your emotions to rage...
We are the last of a dying age...

Who but hails this sight today?
We live our lives in our own way.
Cloaking Sunlight with lightning skies.
From Darkest corners vermin rise.

The clouds on the mountain descends into fog...
You lie with the skills of the demagogue...
The mountains can see what you try and explain...
A horse in the night with the moon on it's maine...

Mountains and Darkness, gilded round with everlasting fields of pine...
When just this morning sunlight sent like angels down from heaven shines...
But in the Darkness of the night, we separate what's wrong from right...
Her body still, in weeping hills, until her pendant turns to dust...

Oh yeah !

Between the mountain and the plains...
Together we break my earthly chains...
If ever there was a chance to be free...
Your powers in life are those you foresee...

What ails you today? On the eve of the Lords?
The fight in my head can't be won with a sword.
Mountains and Blossoms? Lost in your wines?
You're living like children, give me a sign!

In the Mountains, the Imperial eagle spreads his wings...
To the North lies some fields of rain with clouds of lightning winds...
Come on!

Each day we climb new mountains in the dark alone without wings...
