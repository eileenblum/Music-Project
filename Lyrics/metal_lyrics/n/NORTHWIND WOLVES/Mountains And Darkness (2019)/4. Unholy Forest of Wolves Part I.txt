The Majesty of Darkness can't be seen in one glace...
Like cold mountain landscapes which leave me entranced...
Above the forest, a full moon in the night...
The Fog creeps through trees, what a beautiful sight ...

If lightning may happen to strike in the sky...
What once was a dream, came true in the night ...
Enchanted, entrancing communion of souls...
The rays which now flicker against long since burnt coals...

It Felt like the Dawn when we started this path...
The forest was silent, a foreboding wrath ...
A storm which possessed me, clouds block the skies ...
The shadows within me compel me to fight ...

The Cauldron of hatred is burning ...
So the destroyer of lives will appear ...
Deep in this lost murky forest ...
An eerie cold mist draws near...

Wolves's calls echo into the night ...
His hands became claws, his smile to a snarl...
A Murderous streak of his mind...

Dismay !!!

The Temples in ruins...
Death winds flow free ...
Like my purest black soul...
For eternity...

Hate conquered their hearts...
In less than one night...
This mighty space crumbles
With none left to fight...

The graveyard is lively and the corpses will rise...
The dead will reach the surface and cling on to your life

I'm a burning ball of hatred, Impossible to love,
The way you live just makes me sick, cast down from above ...

When Warlords ride into the night skies...
Hate Me ... Or Cling on to your life ...

Before the Night ends, and the world returns to dawn ...
In Phenomenal black dimensions of fire and ice ...
Crystal Winds in majestic stone halls ...
Echo's fade to silence and I remain...

Spellbound...
To Phenomenal black dimensions of fire and ice ...
Bound by the allure of dark rituals in the night ...
