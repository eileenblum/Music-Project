Some say the world will end in fire...
And the battle rages on eternal...
Some say we'll be cursed by wicked...
Frozen skies...

Only time will tell, perpetually killing
Our world with no mercy...

To play our roles, by rules of old.
To pierce the veils, inscribed in codes.
I hold with those, who've quested hell.
In your final...
Hour.

Curse my cruel fate.
To the father of time.
Last night under new moons.
The stars did align.
Alone in the cold, that little dark house.
The insects of north, pin me on the ground.
A Ritual of which I'd need a round stone.
A relic of old to combine it with bone.

Twin Peaks with Twin pines, Valley covered in blood.
Royal Knights with noble sights, Patrol these borders now!
The bell rings for your soul
The gates creak beckoning...
Black pools of Burning oils with Pitch forks and Knives!

Lake Fire inflame me
Caldera's signs.
Lost souls which fill the air,
Pain too much to bear,
Burn my flesh with sulphur
Ravens claw my eyes!
