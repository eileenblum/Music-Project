The Old Forest... In Winter...
The Wolves are looking for a Kill tonight...

I look within those eyes I hate, the eyes that remind me of my pain, in Hell...
The way we were has come and gone, you can't expect to beat the spell of time ...

So come with me, come towards your death.
And I'll drag you straight down into hell.
Feel the pull of death, as I release you
From this world, tonight.

I feel a weight that holds me down
This Darkness does it suit me well?
Such Evil on a night like this?
Opened wide the gates of hell.

Accept this blood from me to you
Then we'll soon descend from afar
I'll see you on the other side
Of death...

We are not alone, in the cosmos of time...
The eternal mountains will live on...
Dark Souls, doomed to walk the earth...
Turned to Dust...
Carrying the Death of the Lost world...
He is the Tyrant of the storm...
When night comes creeping up across the hills...
This is the Oath that we've sworn...

Here rivers flow with tears of hate...
And there's a Rage that can't be held for long...
Four Souls depart beneath fresh stars...
What an omen of misfortune to come...
