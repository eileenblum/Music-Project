"Death will follow you"

Evil on a night like this, we travel forth on barren seas
A dying crew, infested with disease.

Sitting in the dark, while trying to not think at all.
Filled with pulsing blood, you hear their final mourning call

Oh sea of storms we call out to you, take us to hell.

Oh sea of storms guide us now toward the gates of hell

With my last breath, I stay true
I will never be the same
Now I draw near to the black gates

This journey on this sea of storms, through the darkness of the night
Reveal to me the flames of hell tonight.

Surrounded by my dying crew, I raise my tired body yet
I'll reach the gates of hell before sunset...
