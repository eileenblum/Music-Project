"Should I kill myself, or kill everyone around me?"

I have seen what hell is like, a place so dark that death won't follow.

Have you felt true pain inside? I'm in endless pain, withdrawn and hollow.
Yet, I'll live on another day, 'til death descends and I slip away...

My blood's reflections in my eyes
That silver blade, that stays by my side.
But I really died, so long ago, and what you saw was just for show,
So let it go...

With this knife I'll end my life, so bring me face to face with death!

With my last whispers to the wind, I'm thinking back on all my sins...
So I'll take the chance I have ahead, to leave your hell and join the dead.

Beneath the moon, and clouded skies, I take a breath and close my eyes
With no idea what lies ahead, I end my life and join the dead...
To stop the pain within my heart, I'll make this whole world fall apart
And once again I walk alone, and prepare to enter the unknown.
