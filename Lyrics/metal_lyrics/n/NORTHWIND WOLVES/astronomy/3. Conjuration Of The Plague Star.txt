"All I've got left is this..., and suicide..."

I look within those eyes I hate, the eyes that remind me of my pain...
And in hell I awake not from a dream, I never thought we'd meet again...
These wounds that do not heal, breathe in new life when you are near...
Before the daylight falls, you'll wish I never reappeared...

I watch your shadow cast against the moonlit starless skies
I feel the screaming in my heart, when you arrived and we met eyes

So come with me, come towards your death,
And I'll drag you straight down into hell
Feel the pulse of death as i release you from this world tonight.

The way we were has come and gone, and we'll not escape the spell of time...
As I am now you soon will be, pass through this veil of death aligned...
So you pass, beyond the gate beneath this starless, pitch black night...
Let the wings of death descend, in sacred times before the light...

Conjuration of the plague star...
In the shadows, the end draws near
Conjuration of the plague star...
I'll show you what true darkness is...
Conjuration of the plague star...
Such evil on a night like this...
Conjuration of the plague star...
Can't you look me in the eyes?
