"When night falls... my death is only the beginning..."

I hate...
All the things you do, those little things you say...
To me...
It was all those little things, we always seemed to disagree...

I know,
I said everyday, that you and I would die someday
All went to hell, wish it didn't have to end this way.
The way you pull me in, always bring me what...
I need...
The way you walked away, I'm not gonna take that...

I'd rather die,
Than look into your eyes, another time...
I could never make you see,
The way you really hated me
'Cause I'd rather die,
Than look into your eyes, another time...
I left you writing on the wall
At my starlit funeral...

You know
The way you lied to me, would get you back some day
What you did to me, you think I'd let you run away?
All those things you do, those little things you had to say...
The way you looked at me, the way I waste away...

"I hate you..."
"Well I hate you right back"
