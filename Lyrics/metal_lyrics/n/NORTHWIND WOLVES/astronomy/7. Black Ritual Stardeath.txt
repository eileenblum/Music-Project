They who gather round the stones, who chant the spell of death tonight
Beneath the stars and skies above, the passages that we incite...
Accept this blood from me to you, your spell come true...

With this mortal as will a star, descend to darkness from afar
This ritual star death pact complete, I've had enough of your deceit
The blood that paints this ancient stone, let me die alone...

Black...
Black ritual star death
And I will transgress
Black ritual star death
Die tonight, come on

The wind that passes through the leaves, beneath a pale moon high above
The way we once were so long ago, can never be like that again
So I'll see you on the other side in the end...
