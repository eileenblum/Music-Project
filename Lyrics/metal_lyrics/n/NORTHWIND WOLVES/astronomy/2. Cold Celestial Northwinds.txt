It was so dark, so dark of night
There was no hope at all to light
A light at all to help me to see
Past the black of night to see before me...

Those howling winds that froze our hearts
The same which tore our worlds apart...

I fulfill the pact that we made before
Remember now? To which you swore...
All those words you said were lies...
Don't matter now, because we both die!

Cold celestial... north winds rising to the skies...
I see your fear from within your eyes...

Cold celestial... north winds rising to the skies
On-wards towards my demise...

What we shared had come to pass...
What was so strong, could break like glass...
With that glass, you say goodbye ...
So take my hand and prepare to die...

They'll try to call it suicide, now try to see through all their lies
Nothing matters that I ever said, so I leave this world to you instead...
