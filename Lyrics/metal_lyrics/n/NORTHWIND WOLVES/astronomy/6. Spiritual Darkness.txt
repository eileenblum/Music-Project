"This second death... it's the lake of fire"

A black heart beating from within my chest...
Everyday that I'm alive, another day that I detest...

Another day that I detest...
Death take me on this day
Just take me now, take me away

I hope tonight mine eyes stay sealed
Bring me darkness, and all will be revealed

I feel a weight that holds me down...
Just can't breathe or make a sound...
Feels like I'm six feet under ground...

What a sight this starless night...
This darkness it does suit me well...
Reminds me that I live in hell...

Only in this darkness, will your spirit come to me?
Only in true darkness, won't your spirit come with me?
Only in this darkness, will your spirit come to me?
Only in true darkness, won't your spirit come with me?
