Far above a star I see, a star that ever stares back at me.
From beyond the skies,
From beyond the seas
Look upon our world..., like your disease...

The stars themselves will fall tonight
Make your wish before you die...

So shall our reign come to an end, from beyond this we shall not ascend
A death that one cannot transcend, into darkness we descend...

Come away with me on a winter's night...
Beneath the sea of stars thereof...
The mist that reveals the skies despite...
The stars that fall down from above...

Come away with me on a winter's night...
Beneath a sea of stars so cold...
Everything you know shall die...
Below a sea of stars... behold...

Watch the stars fall from the skies tonight...

Watch them fall... Come on...

The stars will fall... watch them fall...
