The blood is not dry on our ancient sins
As I speak to you in the present mine eyes see a terrible future
Do you not see what I see?
Do you not see your own death approaching?
From sinners regrets
I gather true strength
And all will be right if you die, alone
The mournful cry of children shall shatter the peace and shake the foundations of heaven
As nightmares realized are true
No knowledge will save you, no magics will buy you time
For you will end up in fire as heaven and earth will burn
Watch the stars fall from the sky
Celestial extinction
Watch them fall from the sky
Watch them fall from the sky
Celestial skies are black as night tonight
