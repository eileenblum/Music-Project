Under the foul wings of a carrion crow
Wither your loved ones, fallen victim to the ravages of time...
In the shadow of the northwind wolves, I saw the cavern from where they came
And they moved so silently through the trees...
Slowly they came to me with eyes darker than the pitch-black sky...
Go bleed now and beg for the comfort in death
And it wouldn't even be a waste to watch you die
Now you've gone and had a chance to test my pain
And I'll not release you from my fangs tonight.
