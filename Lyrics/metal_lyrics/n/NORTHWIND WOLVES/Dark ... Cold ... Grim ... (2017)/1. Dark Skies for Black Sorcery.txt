Blood-red mist from a field of slain men
Turns to ice as the frozen winds fall...
I... known terrible and fierce...
Mightiest among the distasteful
We are they who preserved the nocturnal oath...
You declare my unyielding defiance
Yet into the silent night you crawl?
To wield true power,
Regard the night and how the light
Retreats and trembles before darkness
To know this...
Is to be perpetual...
Enveloped by foul wings
Of unlimited wisdom and strength.
Oh...
To hear the cries of a failing world in sorrow...
Together, we are they who preserved the nocturnal oath...
Oh....
We Eternal Kings rule the endless night...
