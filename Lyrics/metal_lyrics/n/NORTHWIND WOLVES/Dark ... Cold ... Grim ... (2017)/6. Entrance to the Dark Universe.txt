Death be profound, and within us
Dream like in nature, and a nightmare in reality
In the desolate night, it's me again, feeling my hunger for your flesh...
Carried by shadows of the night to the starlit rocks of the lifeless mountain...
I wander by myself questioning whether I'm even here at all?
Once again, those rays of morning have come
It makes me think of moments past,
And I think about all my friends who have died and it don't mean shit...
I'll wait 'til the sun sets onto the horizon, once again it's the night who
Conquers the day, once again it's time to sleep, kill the pain of life
Hopefully tomorrow I won't awake anymore...
