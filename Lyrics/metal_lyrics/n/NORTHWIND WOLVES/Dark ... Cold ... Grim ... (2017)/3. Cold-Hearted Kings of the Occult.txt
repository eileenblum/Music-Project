Like a burning fire...
In the night plain for all to see
Such hate that I can't control it anymore.
When the time has come to dusk
Look into my dark eyes
And I'll see the fire in your eyes
A reflection of my shadow
In the night.
Cold-hearted kings of the occult...
Your touch...
Takes my cold breath away, at once
All the sounds of the night
Grow silent then die
In silence, in darkness seeking the shadows of those we fear...
Death is but a lie and it's time to seek the altar of truth
Only the spirits of sorrow can see you here
