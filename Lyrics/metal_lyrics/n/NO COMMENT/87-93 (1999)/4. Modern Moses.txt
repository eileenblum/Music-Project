Modern Moses, Civil rights leader, activist
Modern Moses, The concerned Baptist
Modern Moses, That freed the south of Jim Crow
Modern Moses, Without the use of a violent show
Prejudice can speak
Without moving its mouth
With an angry middle finger
Or a demonstrating crowd
Project C in Birmingham Faith
Plots for a promised land
Inspiring speeches, peace marches
Jailed under discriminating charges
Bus boycotts and kneel sit ins
Prayers for the hell to end
Authorities milked power from a fire hose
A certain race had no chance to vote
Prejudice can speak
Without moving its mouth
With an angry middle finger
Or a demonstrating crowd
Modern Moses, Civil rights leader, activist
Modern Moses, The concerned Baptist
Modern Moses, Middle of the road man did his best
Modern Moses, Considered his end "FREE AT LAST"
Prejudice can speak
Without moving its mouth
With an angry middle finger
Or a demonstrating crowd
