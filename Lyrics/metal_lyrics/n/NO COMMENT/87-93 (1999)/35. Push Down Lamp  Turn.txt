Confined within my bedroom cell
Here by choice outside is Hell
Isolated to myself
I hurt inside but I'll never tell
More than just a passing phase
Living on self-numbered days
Masquerading my inner rage
This is my Patter of change
Try after try, I'll never learn
There's only one way out...
Push down &amp; turn
