Imagine for a moment a reverse in the roll
Between man and the unfortunate abused animal
Mr. Scientist in a cage
Wild eyed and full of rage
He's the cavy this time around
To be used, killed, and forgotten about
Mr. Scientist,
The guinea pig the victim of experiments
Now he's the test for side effects
The final result will end in death
Imagine for a moment a reverse in the roll
Between man and the unfortunate abused animal
This research kills for a cure
Imagine your rights taken away
You're helpless, voiceless with so much to say
Then imagine being filled with drugs
Yours crippled, killed, then disposed of
Is it really necessary this murder held in laboratorys?
Imagine for a moment a reverse in the roll
Between man and the unfortunate abused animal
