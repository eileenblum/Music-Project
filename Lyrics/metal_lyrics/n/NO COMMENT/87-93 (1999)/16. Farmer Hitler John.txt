Can you see the grief in my eyes
As I'm forced into a neck lock device
The blade below my upturned chin
Saws back and forth again and again
While blood runs down my throat
Spittle now suds I continue to choke
The butcher's job has just begun
From here I'll be shaved skin stripped and hung
Famer John he's Hitler in disguise
That is he through live-stock eyes
Farmer John he's Adolf in disguise
That is he through live-stock eyes
When asked how he feels to butcher and maim
Animal after animal day after day
Killer meat man replies and says,
"It's just a job -- no more, no less"
