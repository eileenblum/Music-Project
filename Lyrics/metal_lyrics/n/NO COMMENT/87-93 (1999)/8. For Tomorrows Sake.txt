Seventy Four million americans alone
Should prepare their bodies for cancer's home
Refineries multiply day by day
Our odds for death are just a breath away
For the sake of prospering and industry growth
Wildlife lie belly-up
How much longer before man does the same?
How much longer before man does the same?
It's unreal what's been done
Chemical plants endanger everyone
It's unreal what's to come
The greenhouse effect threatens everyone
For the sake of prospering and industry growth
Wildlife lie belly-up
How much longer before man does the same?
How much longer before man does the same?
