What makes sense in a world like our own?
One reeks wealth while another's without a home
Who can forgive when most can't forget?
Who can breathe under all this shit?
Suits assume what the public will buy
The people talk in circles and criticize
Misguided, misdirected, misunderstood from the start
Society's so sad, so sad, sad, sad
How can we live by a golden rule
When so many live in ridicule?
So many succeed in going nowhere
Too often the failures are only the ones to care
Paranoid side by side
It's overpopulation time
No room to breathe in this sleaze
Sincerity's a rare disease
Tempers wear thin on every face
Arguments are commonplace
Misguided, misdirected, misunderstood from the start
Society's so sad, so sad, sad, sad
How can we live by a golden rule
When so many live in ridicule?
So many succeed in going nowhere
Too often the failures are only the ones to care
