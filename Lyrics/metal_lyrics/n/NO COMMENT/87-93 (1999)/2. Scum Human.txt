Sucking cigarettes, sipping sodas
Blowing smoke out of their noses
Fast food dining, absorbing grease
Building fat then feeling green
Never odd or even
Just fucked in between
Today's scum human
Are far from keen
Sidewalk spitting, vandalizing
Litterbug scums advertising
That our environment ain't worth shit
With their careless pollution habits
There's not much chance of a change
Homosapians with exhaust for brains
Social slugs just don't care
turning our lives into a gutter
The human being, an untame breed
Belong in a cage without a key
Never odd or even
Just fucked in between
Today's scum human
Are far from keen
Never odd or even
Just fucked in between
They're belly sagging parasites
Tape worm people, the shit of life
Defecating toxic waste
I'm suffocating in this
Sick society crowd
