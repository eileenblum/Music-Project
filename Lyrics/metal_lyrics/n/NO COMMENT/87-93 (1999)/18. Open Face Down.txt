Laughing smiles jump through sprinkler lawns
Happy tag you're it, games of leaping frog
Five young innocent and dead
Due to neighborhood defense
TAG, YOU'RE DEAD, TAG YOU'RE DEAD
Innocence lost in the line of fire
The fading screech of getaway tires
Mothers and fathers stare in shock
Mourning their child who's traced in chalk
TAG, YOU'RE DEAD, TAG, YOU'RE DEAD
Maybe not intentional
But what's done is done
Sorry can't bring back
A dead loved one
