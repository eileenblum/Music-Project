In a world that's divided
By love and hate it's two sided
You've got yours, I've got mine
It's a matter of opinion
You say like what I hate
Or despise what I appreciate
You've got yours, I've got mine
Lost causes are those who decide
Against a person with an open mind
Is in a world that's divided
By love and hate it's two sided
You've got yours, I've got mine
I realize it takes all kinds
I'm not asking for silence here after
Just an escape from your vicious slander
You've got yours, I've got mine
