His jugular scars are very real
Caused by a pitbull trained to kill
Trained to attack to kill anything in sight
Danger threatens the passers by
Incompetent owners are to blame
Their lust for power is such a shame
It's humane and such a shame
The junkyard dog guards a lot
A pusher's weapon to watch his pot
These dogs are pets with love and attention
Or killers, victims of teasing aggression
It's humane and such a shame
It's humane and such a shame
Incompetent owners are to blame
To some so sick it's a profit game
A dog eat dog sport or so to speak
Where spectators encourage death upon the weak
