In the name of stupidity (so called medicine)
A scientific fraud called vivisection
Surgically slaughters in search of answers
It's animal haters' sadistic pleasures
In the name of stupidity
In the name of sadism we have vivisectors
Executioners killing behind closed doors
The day will come when the world will look upon vivisection
The way witch hunts are now in the name of religion
In the name of stupidity
Syringes stab
Poisons pollute
Brains are damaged
The idiocy continues
In the name of stupidity
