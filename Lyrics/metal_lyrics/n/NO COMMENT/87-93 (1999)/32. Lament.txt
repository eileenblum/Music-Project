Such a struggle to overcome
the grip of self-destruction
MIND-TIED WORSE THAN CONFUSED
Emotionally scarred
from the heat of hate
I contemplate my expiration date
Mind-tied worse than confused now
Such a struggle to reason why
to convey the problems on my mind
Mind-tied worse then confused now
To scratch the surface of escape
at a loss for words I can't relate
Mind-tied worse than confused
Losing words I choose
