[I - This Is The Regret]

So the silent jester comes into view
And we all just watch him
Spinning round the room
Laughing him down time and again
He knows no other way to be
His only regret is the way he still smiles
When deep within his cold shell is nothing but pain

When it's dark the mask comes off
He tries to hide from all he's lost
How he longs to be like them
He yearns to be just like them

[II - The Price You Pay]

Imagine
Forty stories high
And on the edge
A God for a moment
Torn and frayed
Caught between
Reality and illusion
You know the face of the truth 
Just as I do
It must be hard to see reason 
when you're blind 

You've taken me for granted far too many times
And threatened everything more than I should take
This can't last, it's already overrun
The candle's burned
The light's gone out
And all that's left
An empty gaze to take its place 

It's written on your face 
Choking in your disgrace 
'I should be the one'
'No'
I can't believe the taste 
The bitterness you left me then

Meekness
Your weakness
A battle you refuse to fight 
Faith in such bleakness
Can only shatter your innocence 
Is that all that remains 
When the seas boil?
Once the rains have ceased to fall
A saltladen atmosphere will choke you

[III - An Unfinished Path]

Well who will be left
When all the lies have made you
A silhouette of what you were?  
You can't run forever

In my dreams
A jester's lesson from a clown
A path that I've been running down
Ending here or so it seems
Destiny awakened in
The deep recesses of the soul
Climbing out this dusty hole
The lesson firmly taken in
Me, the sinner and the saint
A better man for what it's worth
Looking upward from the earth
I feel the rain come down again
A blessing of a different kind
A pair of hands can craft a land
An open heart maketh the man
And from it comes an open mind

[IV - No More Looking Back]

Here's to hope
We find our home
We can't afford to look back now
So I'm sorry for everything 
I did wrong
I know better now
I hope you find what you're looking for
And I wish you well
