She lives alone
In a quiet place
Far away from home
Never a smile on her face
She wants to be
A celebrity
A bringer of disease
How could I have made her see me?

He lives alone
Only himself to keep
Dreams from trazadone
Every night as he sleeps
And as he hides himself
He still runs away
I see it in his health
He's lost hope for a better day 

'There's one small girl I've seen sometimes
In my addled state of mind
When I hit the springs and curl foetally
Flowing raven black hair and glowing eyes of green
She looks at me and shows the way

Do I lead her there or follow on?
I don't know what I'm supposed to have done 
But something's telling me
I'm the one to blame
I don't know what I could've done 
What if she knows the way...

We are hiding
In our shadows
Fading lightly
Out of view
Null invited
Her evasion
All numb and frightened
Out of view

Alarms call forth the light of day
He rubs his eyes, the road is gone
Not sure what it was but there's a thing that's changed
There's something new inside
Was this a dream
It seems that

We are hiding
In our shadows
Fading lightly
Out of view
Null invited
Her evasion
All numb and frightened
Out of view

She'd hold on to this hope
Like a mother would hold her child
When it cries in the night

Let me in
I know the road seems hard to walk
But I know the way
Tell me this
Do you find the light inside too hard to bear?
Stop running from me
Let me in

If I could
I'd walk alongside you
But I'm afraid
I don't know if you are real
Or am I devising illusions inside my head?
Are you even there?
(Let me in...)
