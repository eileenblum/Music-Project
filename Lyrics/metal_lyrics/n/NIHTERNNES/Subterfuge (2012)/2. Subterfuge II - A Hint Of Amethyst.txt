With her arrival 
Solitude escapes my veins
Leaving me and insanity isolate

Now I must reap what I have sown
And she must pay what she owes

Behind a mask of brazen contempt I watch 
she thinks to impress me
With this self-centred facade?
I will smash her mirror of mists

Although her dance of illusion
Seduction
Could sway me if weak I were
I will remain here on her throne
And wearing her crown
I will stare her down

Calculated and cold precision
Though none as cold
As I, this scalpel through flesh
Through an eyeless, impassive gaze, pray witness -
I am your god!

Now you yield to me
Whether with the meek or the dead
Is a choice I leave to you

The single choice is this -
Kneel of your accord or you will be knelt!

However many times you hear
Of someone torn limb from limb
You can muster cold serenity
And however the words roll over you
The sight will still rape your mind
Those visions will forever greet her when eyes close
She comes back to consciousness after a while
And with a stammer of trepidation
Requests the crucial enquiry - indeed, her last request
(Why?)
