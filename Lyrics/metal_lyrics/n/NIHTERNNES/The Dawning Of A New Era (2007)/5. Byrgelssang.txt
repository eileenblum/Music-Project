But then
The hidden warmth of mercy shone through
The smog we generated and sent above
Cleared, at least for a moment
I was sure then
Humility would show us what was wrong

In that brief glimpse of beauty
We could have saved ourselves
We might just have lived

But still
We should not give in to death
There is still a chance
To take back what is not ours
From the hands of those who would suck it dry
This may not yet be a graveyard earth
We could yet survive

There is still a chance
To give back what is not ours
They will suck it dry
