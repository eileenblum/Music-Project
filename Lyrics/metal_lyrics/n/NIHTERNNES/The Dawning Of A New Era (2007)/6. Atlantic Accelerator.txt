Dumbfounded
We staggered across oceans to new worlds
Came, saw, ultimately conquered all
But what can we as simple mortals do with it?
Meandering aimlessly through a labyrinth of existence
We are all fools

Hell
Most people will simply never learn
Whether it's through stubbornness or stupidity
Most people are simply doomed

But it's not for want of trying
Regardless
For most people the future simply will not arrive
And it's futile to hope otherwise
In spite of our trying

"Those that emerge from the curtained-off mirror
Wiping fluid and blood from their hands
Return to their pews and bow their heads"

Most people will simply never learn
Whether it's through stubbornness or stupidity
Everyone is doomed
