[Music and Lyrics by Ordeith, Drums by Rev. JR Preston of Tjolgtjar]

Blackened antlers on lightened skin
A misty haze and drums within
This valley deep and wide across
Green hued eyes like fresh grown moss
Peer about this darkened land
A wild home for wild men
And women fair and strong and brave
The ones who's honor they keep and have
This paradise of ancient lands
Beliefs and customs, sword strong hands
With weapons high and trumpets blare
And hair grown out and skin so fair
Though you may be extinct today
Our people live your honourable way

[In memory of Brett Vale]
