My will to walk the earth again
To come forth from my grave
Satan gives me the power to rise again
On my Undead Journey

As i awaken, In my grave
And wipe the maggots from my face
Then open my encrusted eyes
To see the world a second time

Clawing through the casket lid
As I pull up through the ground

My first victim I will find
A young girl on whick to dine

My rotted teeth rip, into her pure white skin
Now warm blood fills my cold veins
Flesh is what i seek, Brains for me to eat
The feeling i get rejuvinates my soul
Come with me on my undead journey
Walk the earth for evermore

UNDEAD!!!
