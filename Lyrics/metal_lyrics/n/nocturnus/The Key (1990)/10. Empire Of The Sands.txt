Fortress of steel I have acquird
Behold, Behold the chosen one born of fire
Victorious, death has won, rule of crueity
Vicious experiments, creating synthetic slave
Computer hypnosos, cerebral override

Inventing new weaponry
Building defence systems
Force fields in operation
Erecting redar dishes

[chorus 2 times]
Empire Of The Sands

Mapping global surface regions
Graphing seismic active areas
Establishing aerial viewpoints
Charting several outpost stations

[chorus 2 times]
Empire Of The Sands

Testing elements in the ozone
Mining useful mineral layers
Drilling deep into the core
Seeking power from the earth

Building metal walls of armour
Forging massive iron thresholds
Circuits surrounds inner cavaties
Vector brain controlling all

Computer summons ancient evil
Forces beyond recognition
Evoking Gods of Sumerian orgin
Deeply buried in the sands

Obeying the matrix
The tyrant commands
Submissive controller
Armies of the Empire
