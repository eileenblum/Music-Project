Mastering the forces of teleportation
Gaining the secrets to travel through time
Approaching the vortex, Chronometer reading 0 B.C

What was the past will soon be changed
My first priority to destroy the manger
Crushing with the myths of paradox

Merging with the past
Shock waves rip the continuum
How long can 1 lasy, Traveling at millenium?

Following the North Star shining abright
To a place of the holy birth site
Craving my need to kill the one
Born of the name"Nazarene Son"

[chorus 4 times]
Destroy The Manger
DIE~BY~THE~SIGN~OF~THE~KEY
DIE~BY~THE~SIGN~OF~THE~KEY

Now that I have you into my sights, Nazarene child
Pulling the trigger with no reconcile
Blasting away Father, Mother, and Child
Laughing hysterically all of the while

For centuries I have awaited this confrontation
In time I will bring them all down
Your savior has now fallen
My reign of evil has only just begun
