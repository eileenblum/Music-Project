Before Christ no one one cared
Evil was in everyones heart
Sins were committed every day of your life
Their was no wrong from right

Then he came to change it all
He really thought he could do some good
The son of God sent to the earth
But the Roamans showed him what he was worth
[Chorus 2 Times]

Befour Christ-I ruled the land
After death-I will rule once again

At the last supper he was betrayed
By a friend he thought he had made
Maybe he didn't know at all
Like he claimed he did
[Chorus 2 Times]

Hanging on the cross
With a crown of thorns
The Romans just laughed
"Who is the son of God"

He died like every one elce
He didn't do a thing
Because today
Evil rules once again
[Chorus 1 Time]

Befour Christ-I ruled the land
After death-I will rule once again
Befour Christ-I ruled the land
After Death-I rule onece again
After death-Their is no more
After death-Their is no more
Jesus Christ-He is no more
