There's a land in ancient history
Born of an evil prophecy
Where the Lord of Darkness
Rules all that will be

[Chorus:]
Nocturnus will rise
by a spell I'll devise
with hate in their eyes
the good we despise

[first two lines indecipherable]
The land of good will fall
the power to break heaven's walls

[Chorus]

A Dark City Appears before Heaven's Gate
Millions of Demons already Await
Spectres filled with hate to give God his fate

[Chorus]

then the demons began to attack;
it's the ultimate fight between good and evil

The battle is done
Nocturnus has won
to put out the sun
Darkness has won
