Before Christ no one cared
evil was in everyone's heart
sins were committed every day of your life
there was no wrong from right

Then he came to change it all
he really thought he could do some good
the son of God sent to this Earth
but the Romans showed him what he was worth

Before Christ - I ruled the land
After Death - I will rule once again

Before Christ - I ruled the land
After Death - I will rule once again

At the last supper he was betrayed
by a friend he thought he had made
maybe he didn't know it all
like he claimed he did

Before Christ - I ruled the land
After Death - I will rule once again

Before Christ - I ruled the land
After Death - I will rule once again

Hanging on the cross
with a crown of thorns
the Romans just laughed
"Who is this son of God?"

He died like everyone else
he didn't change a thing
because today
evil rules once again

Before Christ - I ruled the land
After Death - I will rule once again

Before Christ - I ruled the land
After Death - I will rule once again
Before Christ - I ruled the land
After Death - I will rule once again
After Death - There is no more
After Death - There is no more
Jesus Christ - He is no more
