FEAR!!!
OF THE UNKNOWN!!!
FEAR!!!
OF THE UNCERTAIN!!!
Haunted, Plagued by horror from the beyond
Hideus Forms, emanating figure, that lurks in the black
Nightmare, visios from the dephts of ypur mind
Lost... left without way... standing, standing alone

Fallen, spiraling down, erratically, a labyrinth of time
Silence, tongues in this realm. Speechless, words that have no sound

[Chorus]
Burning, at the stake like a witch
Drowning, oh my god. I can't get a breath
Torn apart, on the rack, no one will help
Sharp teeth, dig deep in the skin
Falling, smacking the ground, shattered to bits
Fear not my blade

Hunting for the next one
I search for the scent
Your life my essence

I am the conqueror
I am the one you fear
I am atrocity
Unbelievable sickness
In my mind

Don't worry. I will keep you
Forever, and never
I, have a place
Safe, No one will hurt you here

You can't fathom these things in your mind
Feeble minded
I am a higher grade, sentient creature
You will never know
What I'm made of

It is imperative that I kill
Otherwisetheymaysimply,neverunderstandme
I will show them
