Stalking the victims
Learn what they're about
Weaklings they all are
Come. I will tell

I am the conqueror
I am the one you fear
I am the atrocity
Unbelievable sickness
In my mind

First. I get to know one
I'll let it think that it know me
Once, you trust me, the nightmare will begin
You'll believe in me. I believe in it

Let the bludgeoning show my concem
My children
Pain is no real, only a dream
Fear not my blade
