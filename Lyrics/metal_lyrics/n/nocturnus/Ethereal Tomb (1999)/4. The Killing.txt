To Kill or Be Killed

Through the Trees
Bodies and Blades
Carving the Pathway
To the Checkpoint

Awaken the Grass
Weapons and Brass
Anticipating Blood Spill
From the Killing

Pelted by Crossfire. Covered by Another
Enemy Deterioration
Schooled From the Get Go. No Sign of Victory
Opponents Shot In Half
Shotgun Peppered Flesh

Back to the Thick
Machetes are gripped
Soldiers Marching Back
To The Killing

Pools of Blood. Ankle Deep
Stain the Grounds of Battle
Scowls on the faces of the Heads on Stakes
Retreat. Never a question

Your Resistance is Nominal We Shall Rise.
Infecting Your Existence
Revenge Will Be Ours
Several Of My Man are Dead
Marginal Amounts Completed The Mission
The Circle Has Been Broken
Mission Complete
