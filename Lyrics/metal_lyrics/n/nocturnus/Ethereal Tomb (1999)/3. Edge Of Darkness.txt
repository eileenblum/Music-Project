Enter, into what, you think, is not real
An entity, appears before thee
To reveal, the end of evrything
The mind bends and warps a twisted contortion
Of pain, and complete emptiness
Sanity abandoned as madness becomes the pillars of reality
 Edge of darkness

Peering in we seek a glimpse
Of what the subconscious mind controls for us
Knowledge will not stop us from swallowing our delicate construct
And casting us over the edge

This world holds no secrets
To understand what is to come
When flesh, blood and bone, are gone
The spirit is left, and life, there is none

We wait and do not wish to seek 
The jagged edge of insanity
Mouths will never speak what lies
Beyond the edge of darkness

Edge of darkness
