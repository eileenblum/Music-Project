Mist, like vapor
Creeping through systems
Searching for a host
Hungry, for extinction
A drifter through stars
With no signs of damage

Orbital Decay. Objective is infection
Invisible to prey. Life is no exception
Cellular Predator. Clinging to the hull
Orbiting outpost. circling the globe

Unknown world. No knowledge of presence

Orbital Decay. Objective is infection
Invisible to prey. Impossible detection
Molecular Predator. Clinging to the hull
Parasitic Lifeform. Is now in control

Space Station. confronting disease

Humans, in distres
Thrown into dysfunction
Capturing the vassel
Ailing, with uncertainty
Bodies liquefied
Leaving scored bones

Burning us inside
Corroding the outside
Clouds raining down
Incubation stars on the surface

Orbital Decay. Objective is infection
Invisible to prey. Life is no exception
Molecular Predator. Clinging to the hull
Infesting life support

Space station, unable to keep out
Crashing, spreading the disease
To the planet

Orbital Decay. Objective is infection
Invisible to prey. Life is no exception

All life, has been terminated
All terrain, turned to dust
