Ages ago. Sands of Ancient time
Intrigue our minds. on this endless quest
Superior life forms from above
Carved the site beyond the outer islands
To know the truth. The origin of this wonder
Look through this window. See into the past
And you will find. A land of the unknown
Do you wonder what happened to this
superior race of giants?
Search for the trident. Above the cliffs
At the Bay of Pisco. Supernatural race

On with the quest, to find the answer
Soaring on, to the city. Older than mankind's existence
Our ancestors from the stars

Interpreting yhr glyphs, on the entrance to the sun
Intertwine the time, linking mind and soul
Encounter the land of the sun, inside the body of one

Wiyhin the city of monoliths
Former begins of this earth
Lost..., left without way..., standing alone

Highest, order of damnation
Puts the, fear in the mind
Feeble, thoughts that we have
Why is this? How can this be?

[Chorus]

Is there, a remedy?
A solution, to the dementia
That we all posses, all of mankind
What are your thoughts? I don't believe so!

Miles from the Trident, the city
Of intelligence. Magical alien race

Among the megaliths...
Signs from the gods...
