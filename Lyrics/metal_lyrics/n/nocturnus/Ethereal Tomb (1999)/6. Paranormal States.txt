Energy of Another Plane
Interlaced with the Physical World
Weak Points in the Field
Open Portals

Through these Doorways Spirits Enter
To Taste, The Life They Once Knew
Ectoplasmic Intercourse
Between the Mortal and the Dead
Life and Death Integrate
Paranormal States

Energy Exchanged Through Planes
Bridges the Gap Between
Ice Cold Kiss
Drains the Color From Her Face

Through Her Doorway His Spirit Enters
To Taste the Life He Once Knew
Passing His Essence
To The Mortal From the Dead
Life and DEath Integrate
Paranormal States

Several Months Later Cellular Division
Gives From to the Union
Immortal Undead, Immortal Undead
Alive Again, Alive Again
