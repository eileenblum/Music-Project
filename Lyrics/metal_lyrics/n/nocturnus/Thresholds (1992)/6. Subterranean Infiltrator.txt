Release me from the sky
onto marsh domains
Expose the parachute to
Ease - the - vicious fall

Unseen by those below
Preying on their blindsights
shadows dance
About - the - jungle bog

Agent of espionage
Bearing north of the penisula
Invitatin to lay clear
Think - over - the strategy

Advance into forbidden marsh
scope all in the infrared
Create offensive
Resistance - from the - river banks

Searching,
stalking,
Mustard
gas
released,
Enter
smokescreen

Dodging
lasers
sailing
through the
smoke
and
debris

Tracking
hidden
fortress
sighted
under
ground,
entrance

found

Begin
clearing
operations
Thermal
scan
revealing
activity

Entering the concealed passage
corridors extend beneath the surface
Manoeuvering through the
radar - beams - alarm reaction

Progression is slow under canister discharge
targets locked at the ends of the turns
Awaiting any enemy to
approach - infrared - identification

Once inside the target's range
seize the moment by squeezing the trigger
Single lead injection
intentions to wound - not to kill yet

Movement gives away strategic position
A regiment responds to the action
Trip wire set, suckered into the trap
They lay decapitated

Explosions
under
ground
send
shrapnel
throughout
the air

Metal
fragments
lodge
beneath
heavy
military
uniform

Excruciating
pain
dealt
with
bandage
cuts
circulation

Limping
severely
mission
must
be
accomplished

Moving quickly
towards goal
Stealth the key
Clear path
to achieve lethal detonation

Flares of weapons
burst in synch
Give way
delay charge
Chemical timers are now set

Once on the surface
reconnaissance picks him up
on the scope
Subterranean specialist
Looks down below
as the mountain lies in rubble
