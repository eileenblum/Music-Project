YOUR UNIVERSE IS ONLY A PRODUCT OF YOUR MIND

No escape
once the threshold is crossed
Life and death
hold no meaning

Hidden doors
Interdimensional shifts
A dreamy state
of paralysis

Bands of mass
convert into energy
Forms of light
where no light exists

Time dilation
ad infinitum
Linear chaos
Internal distortion

Once inside
a dual state of being exists
Nonsequitur
Traveller of the continuum

ALTERED TIME
ALTERED SPACE
WAVES OF GRAVITY
ALTER REALITY

Entropy
nonexistent in this place
Macrocosm
situated in parallel space

Constant flux
warping all that spins throughout
elements
sharing outer valence shells

Identity
blends into waves of shock
Haze of reason
Shades of deformity

Correlation
on an atomic level
Portal ajar
He stumbles into the unknown

Overwhelmed
by free association
Twisted region
shown to the journeyman

Overload
All is dissipated
Displayed
violently unto the senses

[CHORUS]
ALTERED TIME
ALTERED SPACE
RELATIVE DEFORMITY
ALTER REALITY

Entering
Travelling
unwittingly
part of it, one with it

Lost inside
Identity
scrambling
memory override

Entering
unravelling
Regrettably
part of it, one with it

Lost inside
Infinity
Insanity
memory override

Lost in the mix
nonsequitur

movemenet is
dimensional
no escape
part of it, one with it

ad infinitum
part of the whole
reduced to nothing
ad infinitum

Lost in the mix
nonsequitur
ad infinitum
part of the whole

time and space
perpetual
labyrinth
memory override

Entering
Travelling
unwittingly
part of it, one with it

Nonsequitur
Ad infinitum
part of the whole
reduced to nothing
