From the edge of outer regions
Far beyond our solar zone
Exists an altered sphere of power
Earth and metal machine of war

Planet's crust pierced by cables
Linking networks beneath the surface
Titanium plates shield the globe
Cohesion of the infrastructure

Friction of electromagnets
Simulates centrifugal force
Massive gyros beginning to turn
Enforcing acceleration

[PRE CHORUS]

Thrusters fire across the region
Spewing forth nucleic plasma
Worlds consumed - astral threat
Perpetual horror - termination

GRID ZONE

Brutally consructed / designed warfare
Perpetuating evil / awaits no more
Intruding on / peaceful isolation
Conformity crushed / death is near

Neutralize - chosen targets
Essential - suffering terrorized

GRID ZONE

Deceptive diversion / blinded satelites cannot trace
Mechanical malfunction
Deteriorating systems by the interface
Initial confrontation sieged by catastrophic annihilation
Inferior worlds destruction
Laser gouging / penetration

From the edge of outer regions
Far beyond our solar zone
Exists an altered sphere of power
Earth and metal machine of war

Light years travelled forming an elliptical path
Eons of galactic destruction
Creating a vacuum crushing the globe
Devouring the energy dispersed
Seeker of impending doom
Completing an eternal cycle

Worlds consumed - astral threat
Perpetual horror - termination
