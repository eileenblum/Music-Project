Locked inside the ice below
Forgotten long ago
An alien object lies in wait
Lost beneath the snow

Seismic readings from the north
Lights above the poles
Curious humans drawn to the sight
Staking camp in the frozen night

[CHORUS]
Legends told of the evil within
Still, forewarned, the man came in
Seeking knowledge forbidden to man
Bringing death unto their land

Nocuous emissions alert the team
The source is soon revealed
A strange capsule scarred by time
Covered with a foreign script
Anxious to unlock its secrets
They crack open the seal
Unleaching the beast contained inside
The frozen arctic crypt

[CHORUS 2]
Legends told of the horror within
An ancient traveller of the stars
Left entombed until disturbed by man
Bringing death unto their land
