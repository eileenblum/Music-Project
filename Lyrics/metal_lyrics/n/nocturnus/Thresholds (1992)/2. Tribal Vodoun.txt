From deep inside the islands comes
a religious belief of magical fate
Necronomic tribes of the secret societies

Conducting ceremonies of the Vodoun faith
Revenge in store for enemies they hate
Soon to die awaiting to arise

Doomed to die by a malevolent curse
Carnival of chaos
Symbolic designs
carved in the earth to beckon LEGBA

[Rites of the Petro]

Reflections of rage and violence
Thundering drums echo unforgiving

Tribal chants grow louder
Dancers travel throughout the fire

Deity of fire OGU
Protects skin from the flames

Divine horsemen arrive
mounting the initiation of possession

Tearing glass / utter pandemonium
spirits indulge in burning torches

Spinnig dancers wake to reality

Vodoun - cannot be abstracted from the day to day life - of the Believer
All is whole - no separation between material and spiritual

The Bokor concocts the powder with the poisonous Datura
sprinkled upon the way of his victim
Body racked with terrible convulsions -
Mucus flowered from the nose and mouth shaking horrible

The edge of consciousness
criteria of poison
Lethargic coma
Indistinguishable from death

Comatose
Mentally alive / pronounced phisically dead
Nails driven into the coffin buried prematurely
Mind slips / disoriented / complete amnesia
Three days fermented incarnation of Evil

Baron SAMEDI
Guardian of the cemetery
Preparing the victim's soul
for Zombification

The fear initiates the victim
Psychologically vulnerable
Powder does not secure
Fate / its the mind
Baron unleashes cadaver
A soul trapped in a vessel
Blood spilt offering
Resurrection of zombie
Body without character
Aimlessly wandering through time
Servant to the Bokor
Le culte Des morts
