Mummification
Ritual of Preservation
The catacomb dwells buried within the
Valley of the kings

Slave's sacrificed
For the after life
Forever to serve the master

Mummified

Death shall slay with wings of disease
Whosoever distubeth
The peacs of the pharaohs

Curse of the courpse
Suffer and die!!!

Mummified

Heiroglyphics
Entomb the sarcophagus
In the burial chamber

Excabating the pyramid
Search the tomb
Shadows of the curse
Beckon the fools
Archaeologist beware
Treasures of misfortune
It's written in the walls -
the legend lives on

When the pharaoh has deceased
The body will be wrapped in sheets
Arms foleded across the chest
Searvants will be put to death
Treasures entomb with the king
For what the afterlife brings
The burial chamber cursed
Mummified the corpse will remain
