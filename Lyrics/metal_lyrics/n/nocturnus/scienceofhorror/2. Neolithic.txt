Years of development
Destroyed in day's
Beings the genocide
A great fire
Has affected
The earth, Moon and seas

As the earth
Began to tilt
All polar caps
Had started to melt
Then the seas
Began to over flow
ripping the continents
Aparts
[Chorus 2 Times]
Neolithic

As the sky
Began to turn dark
And the sun
Faded away
All the climates
Had begun to drop
And the ground
Started to freeze

As the land
Began to freeze
All the animals
Were trapped inside
Some animals
Had Moved to the sea
Creating a new
Form Of life

Stranded on the Rivers shore
Fossilized in time

As continents ripped apart
Lands forms moved to the sea
[Repeat 3 times]

Rising, Soaring, Devasting, Annihilation
