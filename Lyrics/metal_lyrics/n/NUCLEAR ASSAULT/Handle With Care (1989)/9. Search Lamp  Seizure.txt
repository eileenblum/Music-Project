Up in the morning, feeling alive
Not in the mood for ordeals
Get in my car just to go for a ride
Another day at the wheel
Bang into third
Tachometer rises to 3000 RPM
Look into the rear view mirror and lo and behold
Oh fudge, not again

Search and seizure [2x]

What does he want me for?
What did I do?
I never break any laws
The lights are flashing
The sirens scream
My heart hits a moment of pause
I pull to the side
He pulls up behind
The moment of truth is not far
With his gun drawn and expressionless eyes
He says "Wanna step out of the car?"

Search and seizure [2x]

Out on bail, back in my home
I think I'll hang in tonight
They can't touch me behind these walls
It's there I'll be safe tonight
Quarter past four
A knock at the door
I wonder who could be there
"It's New Jersey's finest, you're under arrest
Come with us, longhair"

Search and seizure [4x]
