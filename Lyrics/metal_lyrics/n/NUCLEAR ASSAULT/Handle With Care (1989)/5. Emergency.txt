Alcohol and pills, a night with some thrills
Go out with my friends and leave a good will
Some smoke and some buff, now I'm so tough
My ignorant habit gets deeper and deeper
I'm Batman, I'm Robin, I'm Bonnie &amp; Clyde
For truth and justice, the American way
Now I've become what I wanted to be
But I can't face reality

Emergency [2x]

I've come a long way, do you hear what I say
There's no need to bother with an education
My school grades are dropping and I've lost my job
The pain in my soul gets weaker and weaker
The party has started it's Saturday night
Time to strech my imagination
The darkness of night, a bright flashing light
There's no turning back, it's time to die

Emergency [4x]

An ambulance ride to a hospital bed
Feel such an effort to open my eyes
An IV tube, some hypo shots
My blood is polluted with conflicting drugs
The last thing I see as the darkness drops down
I am surrounded by nervous doctors
My body grows cold, my eyes won't stay open
Finally my heart stops it's useless stuggle
