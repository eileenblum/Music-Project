What have you been doing with yourself these years
I really think that you have no idea
You waste your time and pass your days with no pursuits
You take no interest in what's going on

One day, on your own
All your life you've been afraid
Of success and defeat
You've made your life a living Hell

Wake up [4x]

I think that you should take a look around
You'd be surprised at what you see
There's a world out there you never learned
It may be time to learn some new ideas

One day, on your own
All your life you've been afraid
Of success and defeat
You've made your life a living Hell

Wake up [4x]

Now is not the time to hide out in a cave
Or stick your head into the sand
It's time to face life on your feet and on your terms
Respect yourself or noone will

One day, on your own
All your life you've been afraid
Of success and defeat
You've made your life a living Hell

Wake up [4x]
