Step right up, play your guitar
Play that gig and you'll get far
Never mind how you get there
Just trust us, we'll always be there
Here's the deal, don't look to close
It doesn't matter who gets the most
Here's the money, almost enough
To make your album, now get it up

Sign in blood
Sign in blood

Signed in blood, sell your soul
Bonded for life, relinquish control
Signed in blood, sell your soul
Bonded for life, relinquish control

Did that one really well
Now do another, what the hell
Never mind, it's not your deal
It's for the best, it'll make you real
Fly to LA, a cheap hotel
We've run out of cash, I'm sad to tell
Crash with your friends, it's OK with them
But don't tell us, not your problem

Signed in blood, sell your soul
Bonded for life, relinquish control
Signed in blood, sell your soul
Bonded for life

Sign in blood
Sign in blood

Legal problems, sleazy deals
We've traded our lives for bigger deals
Managers that manage not
Booking agents that should be shot
Legal loopoholes really a noose
To choke your life out then let you loose
Meet the victims of success
And psychopaths that want us dead

Signed in blood, sell your soul
Bonded for life, relinquish control
Signed in blood, sell your soul
Bonded for life
