People are dying every year
For all of the stupidest things
Boosting up a profit edge
Never mind their safety

Stop wait think
Maybe what I'm trying to say
Stop wait think
Your hands aren't clean, there's blood on them
Stop wait think
Every death that needn't be
Stop wait think
The pain of it rests on your head

Read the papers, shake your heads
White collar workers collect your pay
Don't you see there's blood on your hands
When you cut some corners on loose ends

Seperated form your crimes
By hours of production lines
Matching lives against money
Keep your conscience nice and clean

Stop wait think
Maybe what I'm trying to say
Stop wait think
Your hands aren't clean, there's blood on them
Stop wait think
Every death that needn't be
Stop wait think
The pain of it rests on your head

Airplane seats that snap away
Cars that lack driver's airbags
Producers don't lose, they make
Money talks, sense walks

A train crashes, a plane goes down
A ferry capsized, a shuttle explodes
Cars that burst into flames
No act of god, it's in your name
