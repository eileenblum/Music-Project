Power, the face of corruption
Rolling over all opposition
Evil, the thoughts of the masses
When minorities are oppressed classes
Hiding behind the same cliches
Spitting on the backs that are turned away
Taking a superior attitude
Making up your own god damn rules

History written by the winners
After all, who cares about the losers
Honor thrown out the window
Expedience the name of the game now
Social classes built on the same flaw
If I don't have it, hell I'll just steal yours

Lying, perjuring yourself
To help your cause and fill up your purse
Morality, the word is an old joke
Adherents of it placed keeps on rolling
Overwhelming those who objects to its sins
Force to choose between wrong and resistance
Human being made moral outcasts
