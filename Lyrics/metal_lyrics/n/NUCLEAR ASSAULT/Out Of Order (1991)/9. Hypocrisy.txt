The reighteous gather to deliver judgement
Never caring for the needs of the poor
Are you pro-life when you bomb their clinics
Killing the unborn and the born
It's also a sin to use protection
Or that is what you have us believe
You don't care 'cos it doesn't affect you
You're too fucking old to concieve

Wallow in hypocrisy
Wallow in hypocrisy

From where I stand and hear you talk, it really makes me sick
What's even worse is people seem to listen to these hicks
A woman's body's not your provence, none of your concern
So go back to your bible belt, you've got a lot to learn

Adoption's not the answer either
Is it fair for you to say
That she should go through prenancy
So a total stranger can take it away
Why don't you just mind our business
Leave the rest of us alone
'Cos I don't care about the bible
Or what your holy pope condones
