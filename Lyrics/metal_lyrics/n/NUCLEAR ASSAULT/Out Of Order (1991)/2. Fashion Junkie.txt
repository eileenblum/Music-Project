Growing up I start my life the normal way
Learning by living, go to school, well not everyday
Finding limits, learning rules by pushing hard
Earning the right to choose by making the right choice

Living life I've got no regrets
No insecurities, I'm not subject to your whims
I'm not swayed, I'm who I want to be
Cast aside the status quo and maybe you'll be free

As I get older I begin to set my ways
Into the paths I follow, choosing how I spend my days
Running up against people with narrow minds
Who impose thoughts on me, make me one of their kind

Living life I've got no regrets
No insecurities, I'm not subject to your whims
I'm not swayed, I'm who I want to be
Cast aside the status quo and then you will be free

Lack of personality, don't know who you are
Trapped inside conformity, live through someone else
Hiding from reality, crawl inside your hole
Growing near insanity, fashion casualty junkie

A struggle of our will, victory is my result
I'll not be swayed by your cheap tricks or your abuse
My life's my own to live, I'll do things in my way
What's so great about your world that I must be the same

Living life I've got no regrets
No insecurities, I'm not subject to your whims
I'm not swayed, I'm who I want to be
Cast aside the status quo and then you will be free
