Woke up one night with this fierce pain in my chest
Didn't know what to do, couldn't even rest
Ran down to the doctor's office to see where I stand
He checked me out and said "take this medicine, you'll be alright"

The doctor is a butcher
He'll give you some medicine just to suit you
The doctor is a butcher
He'll give you any medicine just to get rid of you

The nightmare wasn't over, I was stooped over in pain
And taken to the emergency room
Waiting for two hours, by the time they got to me
I passed out, felt like I was flushed down the drain

Somebody help me, please get me the right doctor
I'm sick of being used as an experiment

The doctor is a butcher
He'll give you some medicine just to suit you
The doctor is a butcher
He'll cut you up anytime, just to get his kicks

Woke up one night with this fierce pain in my chest
Didn't know what to do, couldn't even rest
Ran down to the doctor's office to see where I stand
He checked me out and said "take this medicine you'll be alright"
But he was wrong
