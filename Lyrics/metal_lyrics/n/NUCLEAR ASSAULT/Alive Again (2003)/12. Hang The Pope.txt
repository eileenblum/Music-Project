Hang the Pope hang the Pope hang the Pope
Hang the Pope hang the Pope hang the Pope
Hang him with a fucking rope

Let's go to the Vatican, get him out of bed
Put the noose around his neck and hang him till he's dead

Hang the Pope hang the Pope hang the Pope
Hang the Pope hang the Pope hang the Pope
Hang him with a fucking rope

Let's go to the Vatican, get him out of bed
Put the noose around his neck and hang him till he's fucking dead
