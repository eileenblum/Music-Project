I wander through the streets at night
Lost and cold, alone
Bloody visions fill my dreams
My heart is like a stone
A stranger comes out of the mist
Backons to call me near
He leads me down the path of hate
Down the road of sin

Can you can you can you hear me
Can you can you can you see me
Can you can you can you hear me
Can you can you can you see me

I fight o loosing battle now
To keep myself controlled
But it seems like no one cares
I'm about to lose my soul
Selling that with God gave me
For a price of gold
To travel freely into Hell
Has become my goal

Can you can you can you hear me
Can you can you can you see me
Can you can you can you hear me
Can you can you can you see me

Now a willing servant of Hell
Lucifer, my friend
All of those who oppressed me
Are about to meet their end
The Queen of Hell my willing whore
The dead hear what I say
The cost to me has been my soul
For these sins I've paid

Can you can you can you hear me
Can you can you can you see me
Can you can you can you hear me
Can you can you can you see me

Now I've died and Lucifer
Reminds me of my debt
Now it's time to lose the soul
That Satan shall collect
Looking back upon mu life
At the waste it's been
The cost was high, the price was great
I've paid much for my sins
