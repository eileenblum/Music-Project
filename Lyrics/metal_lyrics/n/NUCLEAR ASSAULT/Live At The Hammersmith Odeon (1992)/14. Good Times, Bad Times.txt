[Led Zeppelin cover]

In the days of my youth I as told what it means to be a man
Now I've reached that age I try to do all those things the best I can
No matter how I try I find my way to the same old jam

Good times bad times you know I've had my share
When my woman left home with a one-eyed man and I still don't seem to care

Sixteen I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be
It only took a couple days till she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine, love me till the end
When I whispered in her ear, I lost another friend
