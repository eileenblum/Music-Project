Walk the path of hate
Leave others to their fate
Never looking back
Never feel regret

Alone you stand
Alone you fall

Feel no pity nor shame
Mercy, you have none
Fear the revolt will come
Your laws come from a gun

Alone you stand
Alone you fall

The tread of boots they fear
The passbooks they must bear
Freedom, they have none
Their only law, a gun

Alone you stand
Alone you fall

They walk the path oppressed
Their only one release is death
Perhaps their day will come
Then they will have the guns

Alone you stand
Alone you fall
