Another day has passed you by
And now it seems that you don't care
You've let your life slip away
You feel no pain, you feel no joy
You've let your feelings fade away
You've let life tear apart your soul

Feel no pain [x2]

You must wake up and perceive
That you are not a victim here
You're a traveller through this life
No one persecuted you
You've brought it down upon yourself
And now you're standing on the edge

Feel no pain [x2]

Take a look at where you are
And then look back to where you were
And think of how you got there
Work at repairing your life
You can't just throw it all away
You've got to stick it to the end

Feel no pain [x2]
