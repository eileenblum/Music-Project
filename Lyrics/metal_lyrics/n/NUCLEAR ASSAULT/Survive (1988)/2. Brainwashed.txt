Radio, an insidious form, helps shape your thoughts making you conform
Programming music easy listening, help you achieve that moronic grip
Playing you regurgitated pap, selling products that are mostly crap
Rarely hearing music you want to hear, it bas an effect over all these years
Why don't you think for yourself
Live in this self made Hell
Television, the idiot tube, helps to raise our children as fools
Watch the news see what they want you to see, our awareness is limited by netork
Moronic sit-coms and one-sided news alter your feeling give you conformist views
Why can't you get that garbage out of your haed, you'd better off to read a good book instead

Newspapers, what do they say, Not much I think when they want school kids to pray
Getting the facts from some daily news, you hate the system but adhere to its view
Blaming the dead because they can't complain, shielding officials holding them above
You'd better wake up and see what's plain to see, or end up a willing part of the machine
