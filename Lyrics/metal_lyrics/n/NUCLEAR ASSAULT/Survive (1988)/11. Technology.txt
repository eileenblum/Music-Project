Look around tell me what you see, we are products of technology
The nuclear age has left its mark, it's up to us to avoid the dark

You don't care what's around
You you're blind and deaf
Just sit back and watch TV
Don't care what you're seeing
Whey can't you look around
And see your surroundings
Learn to think for yourself

Hear without listening, see without seeing, ignoring parts of reality
I'm wasting my time, I'm wasting my breath, on people who choose ignorance
