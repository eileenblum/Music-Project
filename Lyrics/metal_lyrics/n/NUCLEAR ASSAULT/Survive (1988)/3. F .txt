Searching, for a ne way you're looking for a way out of this mess you've let build up around you
Believe what you see, Believe what you hear
It's time, to take charge of your on fife and start making decisions, stop relying on others

Listen to what others have to say but don't take their word as law you've got a mind of your own

You take too much advice you listen too much to others who think they know better than you do
