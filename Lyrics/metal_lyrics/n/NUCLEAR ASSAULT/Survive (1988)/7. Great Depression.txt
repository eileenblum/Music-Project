You're always sticking your nose into my life I wish you would leave me alone
Why can't you just shut your mouth and keep your mind off my life and onto your own
Why can't you leave me alone, I don't want your goddamned help
I don't recall asking you to stick your nose in my life
Why can't you mind your own fucking business leave my life alone
Tis is my life to live
Maybe I've got problems but I've also got a mind to selve them by myself
I don't want to hear your answers they don't apply so just keep them to yourself

Take your help and shove it you don't have all of the answers I have some as well
I tell you right now if you don't stop you'll put me inside of a hite padded cell
