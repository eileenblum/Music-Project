[Leads: JC]

I am sick and tired of the way you've let things slide
Just because we're young doesn't mean we can't decide
If you think that we ain't got a thought inside our heads
I'm telling you right now that you better think again

Now, we'll see what we can do for ourselves
It's time, for us to show some concern
I'm sick, of your goddamned apathy
It's time, to stand up and make yourself free

You have held us back and pushed us down for all our lives
When it comes to running things you've done a half-assed job
It is time you learned it's what you do not what you say
And if you refuse to learn we're gonna make you pay

Now, we'll see what we can do for ourselves
It's time, for us to show some concern
I'm sick, of your goddamned apathy
It's time, to stand up and make yourself free

Viet-nam and Lebanon, other peoples wars
I won't fight unless it's right, corporate wars no-more
I believe this country's worth my life to help defend
I won't fight to help keep the Dow Jones out of the red

I am sick and tiay you've let things slide
Just because we're young doesn't mean we can't decide
If you think that we ain't got a thought inside our heads
I'm telling you right now that you better think again

Now, we'll see what we can do for ourselves
It's time, for us to show some concern
I'm sick, of your goddamned apathy
It's time, to stand up and make yourself free
