An evil seed lurks in your mind
Coiled restlessly in your soul
It tries to rip apart your soul
A hateful lust taking over your mind

Destroying you destroying your life
You were hooked when you were young
Unaware of what would unfold
Realizing far too late
You'd become a thing of hate

Now you face your life without fear
Free from unnatural needs
This dark chapter of your life now closed
This evil thing deceased
