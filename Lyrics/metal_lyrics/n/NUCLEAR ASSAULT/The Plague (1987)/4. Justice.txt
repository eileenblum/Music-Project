"When the law becomes a tool of the rich
And not a shield for the masses"

You now you finally see the truth
There's no justice in the world fOr us
Oh and equality's just a dream
There's no system we can trust

In this world
There's no justice

No they can't hide it anymore
We are not as equal as the rest
Now maney can make justice blind
The more you've got the blinder it gets

In this world
There's no justice

Now we'll see
What the future will bring

We cannot beat the system now
The only thing we can do is survive
Hope, that there will come a day
When justice is an eye for an eye

In this world
There's no justice
