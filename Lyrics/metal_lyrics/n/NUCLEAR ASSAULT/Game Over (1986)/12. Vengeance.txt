I've followed you
For many years of my life
For many years the sins that you
Have done to me I've borne
Always near to you I've been
Regardless of the strife
Awaiting patiently without fear
For the time to strike

Running through cities
Not fearing their lives
Never retreating before living eyes
Burning in Hell is a small price to pay
Now that my vengeance shall have its decay

You took away me family
And sent me far away
To a stinking prison
Where I could but stay
Fourteen years of freedom you took
While you hoped my life would end
But all your ill-gotten gains won't stop
The prophecy I send

Running through cities
Not fearing their lives
Never retreating before living eyes
Burning in Hell is a small price to pay
Now that my vengeance shall have its decay

Standing in the background
I'm planning my next move
Waiting in the shadows
I'm carefully watching you
Your fear of me is growing strong
As terror springs to your heart
Like actors moving in a play
We enact the final part

Running through cities
Not fearing their lives
Never retreating before living eyes
Burning in Hell is a small price to pay
Now that my vengeance shall have its decay
