Come on a journey
Come on tale a chance
We'll take you where
You've never been
where fire is ruler
And pain brings on lust
A world full of
Unholy sin
Where sickness and madness
are taken in stride
and virgins are
Burned at the stakes
Try to get out
If you can you'll escape
You'll break free
before it's too late

Stranded in Hell
Ring Satan's bell
There's nothing else you can do
Stranded in Hell
Hear your death knell
'Cause the Master is coming for you

Chained up and shackled
You can't see a thing
A blindfold lies
Over your eyes
You are bleeding from scars
Where the crosses were cut
And no one will
Answer your cries
You feel an invasion
But what can you do
No one will help you
Down here
And as he lifeblood
Is leaving your veins
Insanity takes over fear

Stranded in Hell
Ring Satan's bell
There's nothing else you can do
Stranded in Hell
Hear your death knell
'Cause the Master is coming for you

You are a demon
Of unholy flesh
The red fire burns
In your eyes
Now as you travel
Up towards earthly planes
Bearing a human disguise
Finding the mortals
To trick and deceive
Promise them power
And fame
Take them to hell
Where you'll capture their souls
Teach them to
Torture and maim

Stranded in Hell
Ring Satan's bell
There's nothing else you can do
Stranded in Hell
Hear your death knell
'Cause the Master is coming for you
