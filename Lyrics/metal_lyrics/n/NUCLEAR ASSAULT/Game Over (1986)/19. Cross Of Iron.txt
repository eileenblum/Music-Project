There's a fire in your soul
There's a fire in your brain
You're running blind
Your mind is hazed with pain

Your neck is in a noose
All hell is breaking loose
Your life lies free
For any here to claim
You're under a death spell
I'll soon see you in hell
There's no place left for you
To run and hide
The dogs are drawing near
The end seems crystal clear
As steady as the rising of the tide

Sin, not fear
Will rule this night
Cold steel
Will win this fight
The fire burns in your head
It brings an unfailing end

End your useless struggle
You can't win in the end
Your useless life
Just won't be missed for long

Death, blood, fire and steel
They cause the pain you feel
You want to live
You better ask for more

Raise your voices now
And scream your pain out loud
You're lying in a muddy
Bloodsoaked hole

'Cause in the end we'll kill
So write your goddamned will
We'll cut you down
Just like a fucking whore

Sin, not fear
Will rule this night
Cold steel
Will win this fight
The fire burns in your head
It brings an unfailing end

So bow your goddamned head
Or you're gonna end up dead
We'll smash your ugly face
Into the wall

We want your soul to sell
We should just go to hell
Although we claim to fight
For right and god

The cross of iron rules
We're served by goddamned fools
Who've put themselves completely
In our hands

And we know in the end
Resist and you are dead
We're bursting out and now
Shall rule the land
