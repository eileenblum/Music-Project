Hopelessly lost, a battle not won
You're running in panic,
Away from the guns
Panic is striking at those all around
Beware the Grim Reaper,
He rests all around

My name is evil
Soon you shall see
You will obey me
Or wetch your self bleed

Fight for your life, with cold steel at hand
Run for the forest, live off of the land
You'll seek the dark shadows
for there safety lies
It rests with the tarot,
You hear the wolves cry

My name is evil
Soon you shall see
You will obey me
Or wetch your self bleed

Stop for a rest, jump at all sounds
Hot on your trail, pursuit all around
You're leaping from cover,
Your sword fills your hand
You fight your last battle
Make your last stand

My name is evil
Soon you shall see
You will obey me
Or wetch your self bleed
