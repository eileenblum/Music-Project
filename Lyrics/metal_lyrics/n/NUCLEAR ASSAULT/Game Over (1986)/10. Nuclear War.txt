War has come
To your home
Now it lies destroyed
Nuclear war, the final war
The end of all man's dreams
No one wins
In this game
Both sides have lost
Who has won
When all are dead
Except for the machines

Looking at the future
There's no much to see
Your homeland lies under
Radioctive debris

Millions dead
More on the way
What is worth this cost
For your god
And country
You'd destroy the world
It is madness
To believe
That you can survive
Take my word
You'd rather not
It's better just to die

Looking at the future
There's no much to see
Your homeland lies under
Radioctive debris
