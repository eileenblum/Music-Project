[Lilker / Connelly]

Nifty little gadget you've got running your world
Tell me when's the last time that you spoke to a girl?
Always with your head down as you walk down the street
Walking into strangers oh excuse me please.
Annoying those around with your half a conversation
No one wants to hear about your internet connections
Emailing your roommate when you order some food
God forbid that you were even in the same room

Turn it off [4x]

Analog man in a digital world,
I'm an analog man in a digital world
Analog man in a digital world,
I'm just an analog man in a digital world

Standing on my brakes as you meander in the streets
I'm not really sure that you should pass on your genes
The internet can wait until you get cross the road
Unless you want to become a pallbearer's load

How much time to do you spend playing some online game
How much time is wasted, it's just frittered away
Don't you know that time once spent it can't be replaced
Our time on earth is too short to be used in this way

Turn it off [4x]

Analog man in a digital world,
I'm an analog man in a digital world
Analog man in a digital world,
I'm just an analog man in a digital world

Analog man in a digital world,
I'm an analog man in a digital world
Analog man in a digital world,
I'm just an analog man in a digital world
Analog man in a digital world,
I'm an analog man in a digital world
Analog man in a digital world,
I'm just an analog man in a digital world
