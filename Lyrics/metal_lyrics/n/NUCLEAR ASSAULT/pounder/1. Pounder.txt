[Lilker / Connelly]

Ours is the journey, this is the way
Walk with me now, all of you travel with me
Feeling the music, the metal style
Pounding your head, we are all here for one thing

Gather here now live by the beat
This is our purpose it is why we come to meet
Hammering music with sickness we scream
Thrash metal music surviving all through the years

The tribe of metal loyal 'til death
Stand by the music beyond all change to the end

Fair-weather fans gone with new trends
Fashions may change but metal says on with the show
