[Lilker / Connelly]

Awakened in the night I listen to your footfalls
As you break into my home, I pull myself out of bed
And move to meet you down the stairs I hear you coming
Startled you draw your knife as we begin to struggle

We battle in the dark my family still lies sleeping
I defend them from you at any cost to myself
Your psychopathic rage against my will to die
We act out a piece of theater that ends in death

As your knife rips my side I'm gouging out your eye
Your blade quests for my heart as my thumb probes your brain
Locked in death's embrace we go together to hell
I stab and spit at thee for all eternity
