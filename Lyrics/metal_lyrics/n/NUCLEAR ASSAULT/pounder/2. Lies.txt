[Lilker / Connelly]

Can you trust what you can't see
Trapped within a waking dream
Blindly follow where we are led
Never question what is said
Seduced by message a message sent
Shaping truth with recycled lies
Meant to control government waste
Meant to prevent tyrannic hate

Look around see and see no change
They don't protect they just pretend
They hide behind the lies they tell
Those asleep must be awakened

Look within the lies they tell
Become aware and see what's real
All you seek will be revealed
Are you ready for the message

Not a soul hears things unsaid
No one can see what's not there
Leave the path branded insane
Labeled racist for questioning

Look around see and see no change
They don't protect they just pretend
They hide behind the lies they tell
Those asleep must be awakened

Look within the lies they tell
Become aware and see what's real
All you seek will be revealed
Are you ready for the message

Look within the lies they tell [8x]
