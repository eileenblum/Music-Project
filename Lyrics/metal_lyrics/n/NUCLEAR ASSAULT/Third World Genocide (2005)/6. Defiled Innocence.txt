A nightmare rises from the holy places
Daring to sin against it's ways
An evil impulse rises to the fore
And deadly silence from those above

Bow down on your knees
Who is his man before us

Predator of innocence
Wrapped in the robes of the church

Sick men destroying lives
And silence from the prelates

Shuffled from state to state
Moving abomination

Another proof your god is a dead word
When it comes to those who claim to serve
When suffering countenanced is the way
What does it mean when bishops say amen

Now the victims breaking their silence
Bishops and Cardinals are keeping theirs
Will money wash away all of the stains
That these men have brought to Church's state
