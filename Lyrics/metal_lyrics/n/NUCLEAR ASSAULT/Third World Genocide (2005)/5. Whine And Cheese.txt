Don't do sports, can't get girls
It seems like such an unfair world
My friends play online D&amp;D
We are the ones that people call geeks

I'm going to sit here and whine
I'm going to whine about how my life stinks
I'm going to whine all day long
I'm going to sit here and whine
I'm going to whine about how my life stinks
Would you like some cheese with that whine?

We sit around, complain
Whining away all our days
Just don't like anything
I'm just too anal-retentive

I'm just an object of pity
Why can't the world change to fit me
Maybe I wouldn't be an outcast
If I'd drop the attitude at last
