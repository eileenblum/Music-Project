Welcome to the age of an American empire
Not a day will pass when bombs don't seem to fly
Scream about the rights of victims and their pain
But your actions are where the causes lay

Don't like what we have done - we're not the only ones
before you raise you rage - look closely at your past

Algeria and Viet Nam - Africe the Middle East
English ships and the slave trade - now tell me who's the beast

European leaders wringing their own hands
Set aside as powers in the holy land
To Europe we are lacking in sophistication
Are we another shitty little country

Don't like we have done - we're not the only ones
Before you raise your rage - look closely at your past

South East Asia and India
Aztec Mayan and Incan worlds
Chinese hooked an opium
Sacrificed for the old world ways

Belief in their empire covers them in cloth
Forget their powers and morals for the part
History shows us this has always been our harm
When we put up with this and the UN in charge

Don't like we have done - we're not the only ones
Before you raise your rage - look closely at your past

America your enemy
To heal your leaders tell
But for your own demands
You need our power as well
