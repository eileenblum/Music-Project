A state of mind, mine is most unkind
Another here is sharing my space
Locked within this same human skin
Another voice is sharing my throat
We are here stuck inside this head
Taking turns wondering who is real
This is not a future or a life

Another day don't tell me it's a page
When everyday the book is not the same
My life a series of snapshots
But never once is the order the same
One voice here inside my head
How long will it be the same
Another lie made unto myself
Play the game according to whose rules?

Tell me you'll relieve me of my sins
And leave me whole but not the same
Taking one chosen from the rest
Tell me how does he pass your test
Fractured minds, relieve me of their pain
What am I, don't leave us for the dead
A state of mind I have more of these
Don't say that I'm just a disease
