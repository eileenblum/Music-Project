Find a maddened hypocritic holy man to heed
Hear only the words that you want to
Deny that you are led by a psychotic need
To destroy anything that offends you

Pay the price of freedom

Leave three thousand lying dead upon our streets
Use our freedoms to strike at our core
Rejoice in the results of your desperate killing spree
Object when we react will all out war

As warplanes fly above
And tanks roll through your flattened homes
You wonder how you could be so misled
Hear survivors grieve
And listen to the wounded moan
Next time try a peaveful approach instead
