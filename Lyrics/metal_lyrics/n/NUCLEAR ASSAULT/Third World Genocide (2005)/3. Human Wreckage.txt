Across the globe hatreds stir the beast within
Another war for holy causes seems a sin
Letting loose hate your book says to abhor
I don't think your god approves of holy war
All these religions they say don't kill
But they've shed more blood and made more victims
In a world led by god's bigoted fools
An endless stream of martyrs charging to their doom

So in seven days god created all things
And on the eighth man was killing in his name
Tell the god what did you have in mind
When you let man turn against his own kind

Holy man or holy terror who can choose
Saving souls by killing what a sad misuse
The prophet's words are written now in blood red
And all his flock are killing until they are dead
Any injustice they have suffered is erased
By the blood of hapless victims they have shed
Led by those intent on hatred war and sin
Justified by twisting holy words intent
