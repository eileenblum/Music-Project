You held my heart in your own hand when we first met
I can't believe I ever loved you
Then I learned what you had done with my whole life
I can't believe I ever loved you

Now watch me go on my own way

I didn't ever think to stop and wonder why
All those times you couldn't meet me
I never wanted to be the other man
But that is just what you have made me

Now match me go on my own way
I don't think we'll meet another day

You tried to sind your hooks in me
After I thought I was over you

Could it be the shattered memories of my dreams
I can't deny I ever loved you
But even blind men can see with their own hearts
When betrayal opens their eyes

Now match me go on my own way
I don't think we will meet again
