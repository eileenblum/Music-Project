Building wealth on the backs of the poor
Making deals is sleazy smoke rooms
Politicians living feathered beds
Turn around and tax us to our deaths

We're living in a slave state

The left and right working in tune
Making sure they're the only two
Sharing power corruption greed and wealth
Keeping it all held highly to their chests

Children smuggling guns into their schools
Teachers barred from enforcing any rules
Liars causing racial conflict wars
And the poor set firmly in their line
