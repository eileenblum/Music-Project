Another time of madness descends
Why can't the hatred ever seem to end
Man against man brothers fighting one another
And no one ready to make amends
Violence calls to my spirit and my sanity
As madness sweeps all reason from my mind

I see the horsemen coming
Out of the west like a hurricane
I hear the horsemen calling out my name

Fingers of hate now pluck the strings of my heart
My blood signs red with a bloody want
As my soul screams a futile cry for reason
The riders call to my basest part

I see the horsemen coming
Out of the west like a hurricane
I hear the horsemen calling out my name

When the time of violent outrage now arrives
Are the horsemen waiting from the side
In this when the world can reach no reason
Or is this the calm before the storm

I hear
I hear
