See a man living behind glass walls
His eyes are blind they see nothing, nothing at all,
All his thoughts bend twards things,
things that only he sees
All the world a reflection of his dreams,
his nightmares are all too real

Trapped within a crystalline world of thought
Not a fool unaware, of what must be sought
All his hopes and his dreams they are frozen in time
All the world a reflection of his dreams,
his nightmres are all too real

Tear out the eyes that do not see
Turning your thoughts to perceptions within

Reaching through shadows blood on his hands
Grasping the truth that has found
