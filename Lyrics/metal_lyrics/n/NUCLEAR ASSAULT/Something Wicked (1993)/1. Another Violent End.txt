A spiral of anger breaks its human fold
A chapter of hatred starts its evil flow

Now a trial begins
A clash of senseless hate
Before the fences mend
Another violent end

Cambodia soon became its home
The holy land, an endless scene of human blood

Now a trial begins
A clash of senseless hate
Before the fences mend
Another violent end

Looking down upon the hate and sin
Is there no way out, a way out of this maze
Why can't we put away our bloody violent ways
Can't we have some peace why can't we let it end
A hundred thousand years the world is still the same
Where does it start why do we let it all begin
Where does it end now no one ever knows
Let peace come to this weary globe
