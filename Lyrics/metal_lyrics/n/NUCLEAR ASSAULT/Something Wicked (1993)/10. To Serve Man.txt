Politicians' plastic grin
Talking with that alien
We can rest our troubled minds tonight
No solutions here on earth
The president's a fucking jerk
Now the answer's coming from the sky

Oh are the heavens dropping in
To save us from destruction of ourselves,
Or have they come to serve man
Armed with a cookbook straight from hell

Saucers come to save our nation
Touching down at Union Station
Holding summit meetings on the lawn
The Weekly World was on the ball
The Post and Tribune missed it all
Wait a minute where was I?

Oh are the heavens dropping in
To save us from destruction of ourselves,
Or have they come to serve man
Armed with a cookbook straight from hell

Now we know from even higher
Which candidate's a bigger liar
From bad to worse who cares who wins the fight
Don't think I remember when
You could't trust alien
With propaganda left and right

Oh are the heavens dropping in
To save us from destruction of ourselves,
Or have they come to serve man
Armed with a cookbook straight from hell
