Wander into someone's life you're self assured
You're building trust and winning dreams
You hide behind hind a mask your face is not your own
Of your true side little is seen
As time goes by dependance builds up day by day
Illusion built up out of lies

No time, gotta get away I wound be bound by your mistakes
I'm not an expirement
Now I know just who I am

You hide behind a mask your face is not your own
Of your true side little is seen
As time goes by dependance builds up day by day
Illusion built up out of lies
Hopelessly trapped helplessly hoping it's not real
You try to close your ears against their cries
No time, gotta get away I wound be bound by your mistakes
I'm not an experiment
Now I know just who I am
