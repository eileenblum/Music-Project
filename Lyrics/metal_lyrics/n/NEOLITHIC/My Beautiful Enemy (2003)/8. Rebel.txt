Stand up together
Create, create the new world
We are the new breed
We will burn the old world down...
Now!

Hell on earth
Liars on fire
Feeding the fire
Rebel angels unite!

Stand up and leave your graves
Burn your enemies
Take the pleasure
From their pain...
Create

Truth for the truth
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
Rebel angels unite!

Don't give up without the fight
Lie for a lie
And truth for a truth
Back to the primitive
Make them suffer
Let them scream
We are the new breed
