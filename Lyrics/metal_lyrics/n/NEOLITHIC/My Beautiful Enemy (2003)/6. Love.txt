A rejection an affection
Fighting minds all the time
Fuckin' habits eternal crisis
Wall between us that will never fall

And you realize
That your life sucks anyway
You dont have
The strenght left to fight alone

Cancelation separation
Everyone of us live alone
I'm negative and you are negative
Agreement that will never come
And you realize that your life sucks anyway
You dont have the strenght left to fight alone

You bleed inside crying out her name everynight
You take the pain saying everyday " leave me now "

You are tired of all the lies and allegories
You don't want to hear another story

You bleed inside crying out her name everynight
You take the pain saying everyday
"leave me now"

You take the blame on yourself everytime
And the answers
The same for the question "why" all the time
