I've had a dream about my life
I've had a wish to stay alive
I cannot sleep because of what
They've done to me again this time

Curse the sunlight
Damn the sunlight
Make all my sins so visible
So I remember all the good things that i've done

They call me lonely wolf
The truth I can't deny
And for a really long time I miss
Everything that i've had

I hold it in my hands
The fate I must confront alone
I can't blew up this time
This is my last chance to survive

I'm against all of you
I stand against all the rules
I spread the sickness everyday
And I laugh straight in your face

Curse the sunlight
Damn the sunlight
Make all my sins so visible so I remember
All the good things that i've done

They call me ....

I hold it in my hands
The fate I must confront alone
I cant blew up this time
That is my last chance to survive

I hold it in my heart the hate I must release again

I died many years ago
And I'll rise above again
Curse the sunlight
Damn the sunlight
