Going down, down, down
Sinking deeper and deeper
Moving faster straight down

Like an angel with two broken wings
Falling down with your morality
Its really easy if you try to tell
Another hundred lies
I believe you will hide in the dark
And you will never fly up on the sky
There is no turning back there is no way out
You can't stop from falling you can't stop falling down

Your eyes are black and your hart is so dark
And your soul is dead

You will be seen when you fall endless and faithless
