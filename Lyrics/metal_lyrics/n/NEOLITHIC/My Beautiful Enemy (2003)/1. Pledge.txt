You have become the one I hate
I have become the one who hates

So feared and despised
I commit murder one by one
My success is your death
I feed on the ones I left lifeless

I erase you right now I promise
I condemn you right now I feel alive

They've cried on their knees
Tears and blood flow like streams
Unknown face show disgrace
Killing time the pleasure is mine

I erase you right now I promise
I condemn you right now I feel alive
You've become the one I hate
I've become the one who hates
You've my pray
I'll hunt you down
Until you die
Until you die
Until you fuckin' die

Annihilate you
Bitch
Until you fuckin' die
You are mine
I know you are so scared
You know that I'm insane
I know you are alone
You know what I adore
You know I bleed inside
I know that you are mine
You don't have any clue
I'm always inside you

Release your anger,
I hope you enjoy that

I hope you like it.
Bring it out!!
