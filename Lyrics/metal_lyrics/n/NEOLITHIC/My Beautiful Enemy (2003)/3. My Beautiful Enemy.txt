I sense you in the air
I fell you around me
I hear your voice calling me

I remember your loveliness
Desire in your eyes
Warm body in my arms
Your perverted soul is
Haunting me possesing me
I can fell you dominate

I regret the past I didn't want end up your life
I regret the past I didn't want to hurt you but ...

I hope I will see you soon
I know I will see you soon
I will wait for you to call me up
Call me anytime
I will wait for you to call me up
Call me anywhere

I'm dreaming constantly
It has gone a way to far
I hear you laugh
Again I'm trapped
I sense you in the air
I feel you around me
Hear your voice calling me

I regret the past
I didn't want end up your life
I regret the past
I didn't want to hurt you but....

I can only try to stop you
But you still keep on coming

I hope I will see you soon
I know I will see you soon
I will wait for you to call me up
Call me anytime
I will wait for you to call me up
Call me anywhere
