I'm so stupid
I let you in my heart
I'm suffering,
Your thorns are wounding me

I don't deserve don't deserve
Deserve none of this
Wild rose lies sex and blood
So beautiful, so violent, my love

Torture, you suck me dry when I'm down
So much pain, you suck me dry
When I cry
Wild rose you are better
Than anything I have had so violent

I don't need
I don't need none of your lies
I don't need
I don't need none of your lies
I don't believe
What you say to me
None of your words
Can make me trust in you

My beautiful enemy
Fake smile and everything you do
Is just to show me

Torture! You suck me dry
When I'm down
So much pain you suck me dry
When I cry

I don't need
I don't need none of your lies
I don't need
I don't need none of your lies
I don't believe what you say to me
None of your words
Can make me trust in you

Lies
I don't believe what you say to me
None of your words
Can make me trust in you
