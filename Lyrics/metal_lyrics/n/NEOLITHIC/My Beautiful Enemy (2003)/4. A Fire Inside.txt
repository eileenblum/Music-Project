It was dark it was cold the shadows I was left for long
Desperate to control unstable mind trying to get out

No one can live without a fire inside
I live because I have got a fire inside

I was weak now I'm strong
In the depths of hell where I belong
Without hope you have seen me
I still remember my own misery
No one can live without a fire inside
I live because I have got a fire inside

It still grows in my heart
My only wish is to keep it now
Its so good to feel it again
Dont have to say the word to understand

No one can live without a fire inside
I live because I have got a fire inside

Now! I can love again now! I can feel that way
Now! I can give it up now! I can free my heart
