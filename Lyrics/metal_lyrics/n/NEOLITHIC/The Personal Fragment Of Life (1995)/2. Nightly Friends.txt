I thing I saw their faces
They stood behind the window
They stared deep at my dark room
The faces become clearer

I open and closed my mouth
Helpless I more my hands
But my voice in isn't mine
My movement isn't mine
Peace miniature
Huge war

Spare time
Sunrise to sunset
So spare time like a huge black hole
The silence in the universe
There are know faces and nights

Slowly and wordless
They absorb the rest of my defeat
Ash has bitter flavour when life
Without saveword

The nights call me to them
The nights give me knife
The nights rip my hands

All the nights are secret friends

Like a moonmessenger
Like a hungry locust
Empty coffin, empty ghoust
