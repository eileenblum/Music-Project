For destroy the appearance
For the new better time

Born from objects of the wickedness

We are looking for beauty inside
The rubbish bin from our feeling
It doesn't matter what we'll find

For destroy the arrogance
For the new technology

Space, sky as skill and down the winners
The people hang in fiction circle
And enjoy the degeneration

Whether hidden eye with curtain
Still is our sun

Because that isn't our love
That's money and tolerance or hidden hate
Endeed it's all the same

For destroy the lament

Somewhere on the street
Slides the real light of love
That's hope for the crazy people
One day I'll find it
