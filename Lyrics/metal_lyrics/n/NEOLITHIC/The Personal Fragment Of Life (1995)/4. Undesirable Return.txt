Monotony in life
Act and greed
Separate illusion as memory
Born from hope in four walls
Deep and hidden into ghost
So easy all these things to destroy
The corner of time is a line
In the beginning and end
Denote the reality and eternity
So when they cut my hands
They hang me from neck
They hang me because of lying and truth
I want to hug the earth and sky
Because I'll not learn
They open the door
When I go away my world will burn
And will stay only the conscience
None piece of meat will be in safety
