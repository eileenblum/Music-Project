Ever turning circles of birth, life and death
The last rays of summer giving way to autumn's breath
When the sheaves must be gathered at the harvest in full bloom
He is standing tall at the crossroads with his scythe
The reaper waits at summer's end, the keeper of all souls is death

The hearse is always on time and the ferry is never late
To convey our souls to the grave, to writhe in purgatory flames

At summer's end the reaper waits, death is the keeper of all souls

Eternity awaits beyond the fog
The cemetery biding its time for the one not yet laid to rest

Holy rosaries for the recently deceased
Candles held in place to illuminate the way
To the sky up above or the fires down below
In the final resting place, in the darkness of the soul

In the darkness of the soul

The reaper waits at summer's end, the keeper of all souls is death

In the name of the father, in the name of the son, in the name of the holy spirit
On All Souls Day, let us pray, for the reaper waits at summer's end
