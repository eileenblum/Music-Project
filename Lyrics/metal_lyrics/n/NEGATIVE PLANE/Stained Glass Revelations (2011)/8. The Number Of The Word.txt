Know me by 9 and 3, I am no one I am
The four corners without and the circle within
Three of sevens, the lightning path of descent
Falling sevens, the word becoming flesh

Number of the word, behold the symmetry
Number of the word, the unchained throes of dawn

Penetrate the mystery of faith
A single word hidden in between the lines
Three of sixes, the beast in man awake
Three of nines, the stars swept from the sky

Number of the word, unmake what has been made
Number of the word, at the end of days

Three of sixes, three of nines, a single word hidden in between the lines

Number of the word, for those with eyes to see
Number of the word, the risen morning star

Three of sevens, the lightning path of descent, a single word becoming flesh
Three of sixes, three of nines, the stars in heaven swept from the sky

Number of the word, behold the symmetry of the unchained throes of dawn
Number of the word, for those with eyes to see the risen morning star
