That which cannot be known and that which binds all of us
The Father and the Son
In hidden words which lurk behind the veil
The coils of the serpent swallowing its tail

That which cannot be seen, the darkness where the One awaits
He has opened the door, the sign of the hanged man
The vision becomes clear, the sign of falling sevens
The approach of dawn draws near

The many and the One, ascending star of dawn
Eclipsing noonday sun, descending hours kingdom come
That which was divided, whole at the end of days

The One and the many, not separate not whole
The saint and the harlot dancing in the flames, the dove in the serpent's embrace
The illimitable depths engulfing even time itself
The reconciliation of all opposites, where the horizon meets the sky

Circles within circles, inexorably to the fixed point
As the Creator devours all that he has made

That which cannot be known and that which binds all of us
The Father and the Son
In hidden words which lurk behind the veil
The coils of the serpent swallowing its tail

The many and the One, ascending star of dawn
Eclipsing noonday sun, descending hours kingdom come
That which was divided, whole at the end of days

Ascending star of dawn
