A figure seated in flames with eyes of stone
The serpent adorned in colors of silver and gold
A faded mural stands above the setting sun
All that has been and is yet to come

Enter the angel of the eclipse
Clothed in the moon with a crown of stars

That which was hidden has now been revealed, seven revelations within seven seals
Celestial signs and stained glass reflections, centuries in waiting for the coming of the dawn

The coming of the dawn

The Tree of Life is withered, the Garden of Eden decayed
The starlight ceases to glitter and the sun holds back its rays

Laughter replaced with silence, tears instead of joy
All warmth is gone, the shroud has fallen, hear the chimes of summer's end

A rain of burning ashes, locust clouds cover the sun
A time of reaping come to pass, the world that is yet to come

The abomination stands where it should not, the wormwood star descends into the sea
Seed of Sodom born of virgin womb, all power and glory to the Beast

Twelve above are hanging on a cross, the waters open for the jackal's son
The false prophet speaks and all the masses follow through the door of revelation's dawn

Father, Son, Holy Ghost, Cherubim, Seraphim, heavenly host
Golden martyrs, blessed saints, all bear witness to summer's end

Celestial signs and stained glass reflections
Centuries in waiting for the world that is yet to come

Thy will be done... thy will be done...

Behold the son of the morning star and the book with seven seals
And all is lost, the dawn has come
