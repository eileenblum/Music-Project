Looming shape against the sky, the ruin of a church
crumbling walls of decay, rotten wood painted black

Within these walls the Devil holds his mass,
souls and minds to the yawning black Abyss

Faces without eyes, they congregate in the chapel to pray
The priest of death starts the Lord Satan's mass

Asmodeus...Baal-zebub...Astaroth...
Our souls are yours to take,
Burn

Kneeling down in front of the Goat and Mendes,
Burn a pentagram into the flesh of the child

The time has come for souls to be burned
seperate the flesh,
The fire awaits

Venerate the Lord of Flies 
invert the ways of the Lord
invoke the names of the Beast

Offerings of flesh and blood,
screams of pain throw wide the gate

The swallowed souls fall to Hell,
denied the grace of the Holy Angels

Lucifer, Lord of Light
welcomes his children into the kingdom of fire

Even in death there is no escape
Sink down through the layers of the black slime of despair

The ritual is done and all that now remains is
The rotten stench of burned innocent flesh
