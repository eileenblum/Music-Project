When the day is done and the shadows are long
you can feel the weight of His eyes
when the clouds gather to hide the sun
you will hear His voice calling on the wind

For He is real
He who was begotten and not made

All was revealed in a prophet's dream
The face of the Beast with ten horns and seven heads
who pulled a third of the stars down from the sky

For He is real
and He has existed for immeasurable time
He walks between the spaces and watches
from behind the veil of the sky
waiting for the Day of Wrath,
the Judgement of the Living and the Dead

When the signs are right and the stars are aligned
the gates will reopen and He will come through the void
from the dark unknown places of the smoky black Abyss
Life and death will be as one
as it was in the beginning
Ever a world without end

See the world is living in His shadow
All that was written has now come to pass
The time of doubt has come to an end
The Eye of Horus opens at last
As it was in the beginning and ever shall be
