Before the light in the empty and formless void,
all was one and the Dark was all,
before the light the Gods were obscure and nameless

Born of nothing, the vast sea of black
before the dawn of the intruding Light

The word, a name, uttered in the darkness
unlock the riddle of creation,
to shape the writhing vapor

Risen, the great Serpent of Revelation
From the burning seas, arise the Demon Star

Reborn is the soul of Satan,
the vessel of fire to be filled once again,
flow through the void and the chasm depths as
Leviathan

Out from the sea of flames
the form of the world arose; by the hand of Lucifer.
Man was created in His own image, manifested from the Chaos before the Light
