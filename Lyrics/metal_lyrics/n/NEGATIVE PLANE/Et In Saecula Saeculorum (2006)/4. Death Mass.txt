Deep beneath the hard, unforgiving stone
in the cold, damp earth
Endless fields of frozen stares
Stretch deep into the great black continuum

A thousand eyes illuminate the mist
revealed visions
showing the other places
unbound by the chains of existence
beyond the hated stench of life

For we are caged in bone, flesh, and blood
Spirits of the void bound to decaying human flesh

So here they gather all as one
a mass for the living and the dead
Robes of black to mourn the dead,
shroudes of white to mourn the living
A dirge for their steps
as the funeral marches on

Until the dawn...
