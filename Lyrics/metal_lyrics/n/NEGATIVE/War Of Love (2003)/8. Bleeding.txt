I feel the whisper
of your heart
It's so loud it
dissipates me away
But when I'm gone
I feel like drowning
Drowning in you
and in your eyes

You're Bleeding
in my arms
Bleeding in my arms

Have you ever started
that brand new day?
Had a second chance
and thrown it away?
Don't crush on me
It only hurts
and makes you bleed
With me

You're Bleeding
in my arms
Bleeding in my arms

You're Bleeding
in my arms
Bleeding in my arms
