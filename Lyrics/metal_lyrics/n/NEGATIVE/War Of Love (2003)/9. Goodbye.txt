We been down,
we been down
all our lives
We have changed
so many ways
So many ways, so many
ways that it hurts inside
I've got nothing
left to say to you

Goodbye,
Goodbye my Friend
Goodbye,
Goodbye my Love
Goodbye,
Goodbye my Love
I gotta go

So many times,
too many times
we've been drowning
I've got nothing
left to lose anymore

Goodbye,
Goodbye my Friend
Goodbye,
Goodbye my Love
Goodbye,
Godbye my love
I gotta go
