I've tried to kill the pain
but it keeps me
in this circle
It's hard to get away
And I feel you again
You're with me
Love is a word
you gave it a name

Love is right now
So don't close your heart
I've been waiting
all my life for this
Moment of our Love
with you

I've tried to feel the pain
But it keeps me
in this Circle
I don't wanna get away
'cos you're here with me
I feel you
Love is the word
you gave it a name

Love is right now
So don't close you heart
I've been waiting
all my life for this
Moment of our Love
with you
with you

Love is right now..
right now
Our Love is right now
So don't close your heart
I've been waiting
all my Life for this
Moment of our Love
with you

Just let me Love you
and I learn to Love you
right - I lived Only for
the Moment - For this
Moment of our Love
with you
with you
