I feel like dying
everyday
Am I here
just to fade away?
Do you know
what it means?
You can think it's OK
but the story is not
the same anymore

Drop me and let me fall
in a way I haven't
felt before
Leave me alone
don't come any closer
I'm so alone
and I think I'm a loser

Nobody never
understands
Now I'm alone
and on my own
It's so unfair
people cry, people smile
Is it wrong or is it right?
I know it's right

Drop me and let me fall
in a way I haven't
felt before
Leave me alone
don't come any closer
I'm so alone
and I think I'm a loser
