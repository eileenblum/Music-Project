I tought that
we had fallen in Love
But somehow I felt
the nails in my heart
So deep that
I couldn't even scream
It was all the things
you said to me
Every lie
you made me believe

Days when I cared
Days when I loved
Days when I woke and
felt those thousand
nails in my heart

Sometimes it's easier
to give up than cry
and keep on living
in those lies
It was all those things
you said to me
Every lie
you made me believe

Days when I cared
Days when I loved
Days when I woke and
felt those thousand
nails in my heart
