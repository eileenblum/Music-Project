I see someone's crying
I see tears are shining
I see grass is green
I see what you feel

I mean you are so Naive
I see I'm not blind
I mean you are so Naive
I see I'm not blind

I hear someone's crying
I hear tears are falling

I mean you are so Naive
I see I'm not blind
I mean you are so Naive
I see I'm not blind

I see someone's crying
I see tears are shining
I see grass is green
I see what you feel

I mean you are so Naive
I see I'm not blind
I mean you are so Naive
I see I'm not blind
