When you're alone
you have no Faith
I know that I found you
and I take you
'cos I take you home
Anymore
you're not alone

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
There is no time
for me to be Sorry

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
I've lost my Pain in me
But only for a while
for a while

Where have
been for so long
I've been waiting for
you - Now I found you
And I take you
You're not alone
'cos I take you home
Anymore
you're not alone

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
There is no time
for me to be Sorry

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
I've lost my Faith in me
But only for a while
for a while

There is no time
for me to be Sorry
to be Sorry

I'm the Last Hero
only for you
I'm the Last hero
just for you
