Open my grave and
let the sun shin in
I am just a Lost Soul
Help me to grow
show me the way
the way into your heart

Oh, can't you see
how I'm dying? I've got no
reason to be proud
drink this water around
me before I drown

God save the Queen
but why can't God save me
All the flowers die tonight
Tear drops falling
down my face
and all the eandles love
their flames

And the more we grow
the less we know
until the time
we lose it all

Look at me now
I'm broken and empty
Why does it always
rain on me?
Give me your heart
so I can live

God save the Queen
but why can't God save me
All the flowers die tonight
tear drops falling
down on my face
and all the eandles
lose their flames
