Since birth you wandered on the streets
Doing drugs to kill bad self-esteem
Never looking out for compromise
Now you're gone in hell and i realise... that I've seen...
Motherfuckers, mothersuckers just like you
We don't know, who don't know, what they should do with their  lives
Motherfuckers, motherfuckers just like you...
Take a look outside it all could be yours
Unsophisticated demanding force
Am I wrong, I warned you for so long?
Always waiting for the nest storm to come.. that I've  seen..
Motherfuckers, mothersuckers just like you
We don't know, who don't know, what they should do with their  lives
Motherfuckers, motherfuckers just like you...
We don't know, who don't know, what they should do
Just get a life man, you better do it fast, just get a life  man,
Now get out of your trap
And I've seen
Motherfuckers, mothersuckers just like you
We don't know, who don't know, what they should do with their  lives
Motherfuckers, mothersuckers just like you
We don't know, who don't know, what they should do with their  lives
Just get a life man, you better do it fast, just get a life  man
