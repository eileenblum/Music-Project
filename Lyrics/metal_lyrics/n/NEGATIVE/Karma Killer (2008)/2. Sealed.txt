Only sorrow and pain will fill your heart tonight only thing that will remain
Could it get worse? It's a one way street down with every gasp it hurts never pleasant kinda way
This love was a curse and we were just framed
It all comes back crying out your name
Only sorrow and pain will fill your heart tonight
Only thing that will remain is your heart next to mine
Sorrow and pain... only sorrow and pain
There was a time when you walked in beauty
Now you're alone but there are million just like you
Why should you fight no one's safe from the cruelty
Only sorrow and pain will fill your heart tonight
Only thing that will remain is your heart next to mine
Sorrow and pain... only sorrow and pain
