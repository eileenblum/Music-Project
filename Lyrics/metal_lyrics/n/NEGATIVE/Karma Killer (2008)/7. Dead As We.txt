I was holding her forever
Through the tears we smiled together
And commitment cost me more than I could pay
This blaze of despair is all that I can feel
When love that was meant for us will be dead as we
No need to approve, don't put the blame on me
When all that was meant for us, will be dead as we
She was offering for adventure
Rusty diamonds of secret treasure
She took me deeper into the dark than I could go
This blaze of despair is all that I can feel
When love that was meant for us will be dead as we
No need to approve, don't put the blame on me
When all that was meant for us, will be dead as we
Every shadow on her way, will remind if better days
This blaze of despair is all that I can feel
When love that was meant for us will be dead as we
No need to approve, don't put the blame on me
When all that was meant for us, will be dead as we
No need to approve, don't put the blame on me
When all that was meant for us, will be dead as we
