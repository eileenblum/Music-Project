I doubt myself today 4am the world is sleeping
Wonder why no one's here just me and this needless weeping
Running away fromyou, was the first mistake from my side
Running away from you, was the worst mistake of my life
If I could turn back time... but then no one can..
So many things unsaid, so many things I couldn't write  down
When my weakness made me scared
You presence built me stronger and all that disapprovment
Of hope is flying over, like dust in the wind
If I could turn back time get right back where we start from...  But I can't
Your presence built me stronger and all that disapprovment
Of hope is flying over, like dust in the wind
If i could turn back time get right back where we started  from... but I can't
No I can't... but I can't
