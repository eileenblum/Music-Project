Take a look at me years behind me have  made me disabled
My will and strength lives in me.. it  was loud to keep me stable...
Hear me  pray for the pain and to  suffer,
It's all a game we're destructive to  each other
Life is short, an open chord, in a bad  tone..
From now on there's a devil on my  shoulder
Why I'm still here in this godless scene  going six feet under
She's the burning ground beneath my feet  for too long and I should tell her..
No matter what! no matter  what!

Hear me pray for the pain and to  suffer,
It's all a game we're destructive to  each other
Life is short, an open chord, in a bad  tone...
From now on there's a devil on my  shoulder
Hear me pray for the pain and to  suffer,
It's all a game we're destructive to  each other
Life is short, an open chord, in a bad  tone...
From now on no more for me to follow
No wrong or right there's no need to say things twice
No matter what I'll survive with a devil on my, a devil on my  shoulder..
No matter what!
