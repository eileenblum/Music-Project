There's a power we can't see
Tired to put it in words, guess it wasn't meant to be
Still do my best to understand, what's behind that's haunting  me
The peace will return like the sun of my childhood,
There's no one on earth that could ruin this solid mood
Warm touch of a winged messenger of danger
Still hear the call, but I won't go
Another day behind and I survived
Who held me through this? I'm glad that I'm still alive
Dark force keeps knockin' on my door
But I won't open 'till it's gone
The peace will return like the sun of my childhood,
There's no one on earth that could ruin this solid mood
Warm touch of a winged messenger of danger
Still hear the call, but I won't go
The peace will return like the sun of my childhood,
There's no one on earth that could ruin this solid mood
Warm touch of a winged messenger of danger

The peace will return like the sun of my childhood,
There's no one on earth that could ruin this solid mood
Warm touch of a winged messenger of danger
Still hear the call, but I won't go... gravity of love
I must be dreaming, I must be dreaming, I must be dreaming
I must be dreaming, I must be dreaming, I must be  dreaming
