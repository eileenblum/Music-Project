Don't say "I'm sorry" again, it doesn't give you the right... to  be someone else.
I would be pleased to love and share but inside I'm looked I  can't even cry
Love only matters, when it comes to the end
Love only matters makes you rise again
I'm just an ornament, and ornament to your face
Not enough, but it feels right, you keep me alive when you hold  me tight
Both ends are burning fast would you stand by me when things are  getting bad
And the colours here will face would you help me see, real  shades of grey
Love only matters, when it comes to the end
Love only matters makes you rise again
I'm just an ornament, and ornament to your face
Not enough, but it feels right, you keep me alive when you hold  me tight
I'm just an ornament, an ornament in your garden
Not enough but it feels right you keep me alive when you bring  the rain...rain...
Read between the lines this is fragile only for you and I
All I want is that you love me.. as I am
Don't say "I'm sorry" again, it doesn't give you the right... to  be someone else.
Someone else
