Hate, what will it take, when all that is left is a long  waited sweet revenge
I'm giving up. giving up my pride for you
I'm giving up, giving up my trust in you
My dear old friend good times we had, but I ain't no one's  fool
Let there be light and a better future
With every blink of an eye your lies will destroy her
So I'm giving up. giving up my pride for you
I'm giving up, giving up my trust in you
And every minute now you're drifting away it's a fact we can't deny
Let there be light and a better future
With every blink of an eye your lies will destroy her
So I'm giving up. giving up my pride for you
I'm giving up, giving up my trust in you
Let there be light and a better future
With every blink of an eye your lies will destroy her
So I'm giving up. giving up my pride for you
I'm giving up, giving up my trust in you
My trust in you, my trust in you...
