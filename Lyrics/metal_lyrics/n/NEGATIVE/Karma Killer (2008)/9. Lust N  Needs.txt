Come, come and taste the blade cold and steel
With that grin upon your face bring it all down here
All down here, let's make it real
Love on streets, emotions for sale
Just take whatever comes on your way I swear you won't  regret
Get in, release your lust and needs just for one night down on  your knees
Play dead enjoy and forget
Girl forget the world outside that is made of rules
Be my queen of desire, live for your sin
Let me be your sin take me under your skin
Love on streets, emotions for sale
Just take whatever comes on your way I swear you won't  regret
Get in, release your lust and needs just for one night down on  your knees
Play dead enjoy and forget
Love on streets, emotions for sale
Just take whatever comes on your way I swear you won't  regret
Get in, release your lust and needs just for one night down on  your knees
Play dead enjoy and forget
My queen of desire come light my fire and scream!
