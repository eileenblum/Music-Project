When hearts are blessed with fire and sincere faith
We decide to get rid of desires that we can't we can't  escape
How much more your ired heart can take?
The time will show that our secrets won't be safe..
I won't let go of things that I was dreaming
I won't let go of you, you keep me believin'
Deep in my heart there's a place that I could never show to you
I won't let go, of you my dear
If we trust a love to take us to a place unknown
Even we're not sure, if we could get back on our own
No way out, not even tired heart can tell
It breaks me down it kills me
I won't let go of things that I was dreaming
I won't let go of you, you keep me believin'
Deep in my heart there's a place that I could never show to you
I won't let go, of you my dear
