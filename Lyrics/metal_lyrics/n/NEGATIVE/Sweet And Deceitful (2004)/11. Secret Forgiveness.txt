You're my all
I need you beside me
Hurts too much to be apart.
Oh how sweet but still so deceitful
This life and love can be
And I was the one who never wanted
To let you know
Wanted to let you know.

As much as we're in a love
That seems so tender
And more in love than
We ever believed we could be in
Now and forever, we finally surrender
So we surrender now or never again

Sweet and kind confusion inside me
Needs to find out what âus' really means
Can't believe how sweet and deceitful
You and I, we both can be
And I was the one who never
Wanted to let you go
