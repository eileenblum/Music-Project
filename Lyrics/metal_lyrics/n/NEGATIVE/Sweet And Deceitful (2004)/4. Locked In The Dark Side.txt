Waiting for something, something
More to live for
It has taken too long
Since I've had something to hold on

I'm locked in a darkside
Locked in a darkside

What if that all we felt inside
Is just illusion, a waste of time
And every tear we cried inside
Is just a sign we went too far

Waiting for something, something more
To fight for... finding pieces
Now I'm part of it
It's part of me
