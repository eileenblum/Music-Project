Maybe I'm not what you want
I'm not what you needed
I'm something you never got

To you I'm dead
But you don't care
Stop refusing
You don't deserve me

You're playing with fire
It burns your skin
It feels too good
You're in love with the heat
You can't get out
Fire is feeding you

Fire is a waitress
Licking your skin
Slowly but surely it starts to get in
You don't wanna get out
Fire is feeding you

Maybe it's getting late to say "nothing"
I don't care anymore
To you I'm dead but I don't care
In your nightmare - it will never end

You're playing with fire
It burns your skin
It feels too good
You're in love with the heat
You can't get out
Fire is feeding you

Fire is the waitress
Licking your skin
Slowly but surely it starts to get in
You don't wanna get out
Fire is feeding you

You're playing with fire
It burns your skin
It feels too good
You're in love with the heat
You can't get out
Fire is feeding you

Fire is the waitress
Licking your skin
Slowly but surely it starts to get in
You can't get out
Fire is feeding you
