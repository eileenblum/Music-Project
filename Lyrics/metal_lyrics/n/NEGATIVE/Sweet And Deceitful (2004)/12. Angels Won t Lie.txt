Another wasted moment
Realizing we're not real
Can you hear the angels calling
When night is young and silence comes?
You touch my face
And I break down

Dreaming on
Tonight we are safe and free
Under the wings in the safest place
I close my eyes for a while
And you are there
We fly behind the stars
Where the distance ends

Tonight
I'm sleeping with eyes wide open
You're my eyes when I am not there
These everlasting angels calling
It can't be real
This must be a dream
You touch my face
You set me free

When night is young and silence comes
You touch my face
And I break down
This can't be real
This must be a dream
You touch my face
You set me free
