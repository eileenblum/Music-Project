Her love is too much for my heart
She burned me out
I felt to protect myself
From her smile so divine

And I'd like to save her
But I think it's too hard
Too hard for her and for me

And she makes me feel
My heart is creeping inside

Together we can see all incompleteness
On a different way
She keeps on staring straight and true
It makes me weak
I felt to protect myself
From her eyes too divine

And I'd like to save her
But I think it's too hard
Too hard for her and for me
