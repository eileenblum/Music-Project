Dreams faded
I'm frightened
Will I ever find the cure?
Mistaken, I'm waiting
When I finally hit the floor

I'm hurt and so wounded
It's gonna tear my soul apart
I'm lost in my heaven
I finally found my way to escape

Love's faded
I'm haunted
Will I finally find the cure?
Mistaken
I'm waiting
Just for you

I'm hurt and so wounded
It's gonna tear my soul apart
I'm lost in my heaven
I finally found my way

I'm hurt and so wounded
It's gonna tear my soul apart
I'm lost in my heaven
I finally found my way to escape

My way to escape (my way to escape)
My way to escape

I'm hurt and so wounded
It's gonna tear my soul apart
I'm lost in my heaven
I finally found my way

I'm hurt and so wounded
It's gonna tear my soul apart
I'm lost in my heaven
I finally found my way to escape

Found my way to escape
I'm lost in my heaven
My heaven
