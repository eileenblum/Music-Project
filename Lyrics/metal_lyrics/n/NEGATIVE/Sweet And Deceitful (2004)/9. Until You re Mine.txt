Afraid of all the fears I feel inside
It's hard to go on
And try to leave this all behind

Should I be afraid of
When all the beauty seems so cruel
Always somehow
I turn all my fears on you

Sometimes I run and hide my fears
Afraid and I hide until you're mine
You give me heart to carry on
It gives me hope, it makes me strong

Afraid of all your fears I'm living through
Deep inside my, my heart
I'm weak as you

Until you're mine
These waking hours killing me
Always somehow
You finally turn your fears on me, on me
It breaks me

Sometimes I run and hide my fears
Afraid and I hide until you're mine
You give me heart to carry on
You give me hope, it makes me strong

Sometimes I run and hide my fears, run and hide my fears
Afraid and I hide until you're mine, until you're mine
You give me heart to carry on, carry on
You give me hope, it makes me strong

Until you're mine, until you're mine
Run and hide

Keep the courage used to carry on
You give me hope, it makes me strong
