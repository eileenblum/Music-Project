All that I am
I just can't find the words to make you understand me
As brave as I am
I'm not close to showing you who I am or what I feel

You're so fucking perfect
you're so fucking cool
and I'm so fucking worthless
when I'm far from you
in the end it doesn't matter
'cause you make me complete

The light of your smile
like the sun in a storm somewhere inside of me
put your hand on my head
and wipe away all the fears I've ever met
or could invent

You're so fucking perfect

you're so fucking cool
and I'm so fucking worthless
when I'm far from you
in the end you are all that matters
'cause you make me complete
