[Bonus Track]Youâd  better run when thereâs no one left in here.
You made your move and make playmates disappear
With all your painted face and all your high heel shoes you make me sweat like hell
You tease me around, Iâm all over your tongue, just squeeze the trigger
Iâm a loaded gun

Iâm gonna eat you alive, girl (Eat you alive!)
Iâm gonna give you what you deserve
Iâm gonna give you the ride of your life
Iâm gonna eat you alive, eat you alive

Daddyâs girl never let herself outside
Little misbehave always shows up just in time

With all your well trained moves and your catwalk talk, you drive them all insane
And that smell of your taste, you got me so damn tempted
I got a grip of you now

Iâm gonna eat you alive, girl (Eat you alive!)
Iâm gonna give you what you deserve
Iâm gonna give you the ride of your life
Iâm gonna eat you alive

Iâm gonna eat you alive, girl (Eat you alive!)
Iâm gonna have all your friends as dessert
Weâre gonna have the fucking time of our lives
Iâm gonna eat you alive

Ah, ahâ¦ (the clichÃ© of a female orgasm)

Iâm gonna eat you alive, girl (Eat you alive!)
Iâm gonna give you what you deserve
Iâm gonna give you the ride of your life
Iâm gonna eat you alive

Iâm gonna eat you alive, girl (Eat you alive!)
Iâm gonna have all your friends as dessert
Weâre gonna have the fucking time of our lives
Iâm gonna eat you alive
Eat you alive
Alive
