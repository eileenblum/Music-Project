I'm, I'm still waiting for your love, tonight.
And I, I've been playing with a thought you'd come

Believe in me, believe in me...

Tell me why, tell me why. We can't forget our past mistakes
we can't go back to better days
tell me why, tell me why
We lose the one we can't replace
oh it feels like yesterday
Remember me

I was young and too naive
to see what's best for me
did I ever tell you how I cried after you get the best of me

Believe in me, believe in me...

Tell me why, tell me why

Lately I've been thinking of these crazy summer days
we were careless in a way we used to be

(Believe in me, believe in me)

When we we're young, when we we're young,
Lately I've been thinking of these crazy summer days
we were careless in a way we used to be

So bit a shame how live goes on
we have to change so many ways
There's a time we can't get back
