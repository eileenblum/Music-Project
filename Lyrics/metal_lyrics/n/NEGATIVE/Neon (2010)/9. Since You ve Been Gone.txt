I've seen shadows spreading fear and turning laughter into tears
since you've been gone
I've been alone, down and out trying to hear my inner sound
since you've been gone

There's a world waiting for me outside my window
no matter how I try my thoughts lead back to you

Screaming loud: I'll be a shadow of a man I used to be
Crying out, seems like the world just celebrates my misery
Since you've been gone
Since you've been gone

No one else could ease my pain
this solitude drives me insane
Since you've been gone
Passion flowing through my veins
I feel the sting of something strange
Since you've been gone

There's a world waiting for me outside my window
no matter how I try my thoughts lead back to you

Screaming loud: I'll be a shadow of a man I used to be...

The time will come when tables will be turned
and I'll be the king
