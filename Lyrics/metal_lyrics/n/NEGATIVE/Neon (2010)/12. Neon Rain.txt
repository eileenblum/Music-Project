Where the sun goes down
there's a place on earth
where the sky's all red
and mother gives rebirth

As a runaway child
he was running all around
like a stranger in the night
he walked and then he found
some sand in his pocket
from that old playground

Do you remember that man
with a sunburst on his jacket?
Well, he's still around
his Mama was always saying to him:
don't be afraid my son
the world out there is cold and it is dark
but you'll be alright my son
You'll be all... right

Lately he's been thinking of these crazy summer days
when he was careless
in the way he used to be
Isn't it a shame - how life goes on?
And we have to change in so many ways
but that's just... I guess it's just the way...
it is

Once, he had something
and he might never get it back
and as he gets older
he will stop... looking back

But Mama's still saying to him:
don't be afraid my son
the world out there is cold and the world is dark
but you'll be alright my son
you'll be alright
as long as you stay of the bright side of the line
and keep on following the light

We have all seen the start!
And we will all see the end
but what happens in between
is all that matters, my friend
