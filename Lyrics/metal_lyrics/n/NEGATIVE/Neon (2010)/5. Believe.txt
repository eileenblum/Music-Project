God it's been so long
since we tried to get along
so many things we're left unsaid
That's why I found myself today
I'm wondering how you feel
do you ever think of me
when you're touching someone else?

Is it hard to believe?
It was all in me, was it something I said
or something I did

So many roads to go
but only one will lead us home
Gotta face it all alone
try to make it on my own

It is hard to believe?
It was all in me, was it something I said
or something I did
Now it's all coming back to me
and the time has gone by and I see
So selfish I know I can be
broken your trust in me
I just refuse to believe

God it's been so long
since we tried to get along gotta face it all alone
try to make it on my own

It is hard to believe?...

Believe. Believe.
