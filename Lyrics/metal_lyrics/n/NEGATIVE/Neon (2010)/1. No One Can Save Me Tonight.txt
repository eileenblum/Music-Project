I drive all night, I need a change
these neon lights down on my face
some things are calling from my past

Not even you could raise me higher
keep me away from all desire
no one can save me tonight

Now I've had enough, I've had enough, I've had enough
need a brand new start
I've had enough it'll never be too late

No one can save me tonight
(No one can save cos no one can save me)
No one can save me tonight
(No one can save cos no one can save me)

That shot was more than I could take
like a neverending fairytale
I wish I was a bit like you

Not even you could raise me higher
keep me away from all desire
no one can save me tonight

Now I've had enough...

No one can save me tonight...

No one, no one, no one, no
No one, no one, no one, no

If I could only make you feel, the way, I do
so you could heal me
I've had enough, I've had enough, I've had enough
(No one can save cos no one can save me)
I've had enough, I've had enough
enough's enough
It's about to change
