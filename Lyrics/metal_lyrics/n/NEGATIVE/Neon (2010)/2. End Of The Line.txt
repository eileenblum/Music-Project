You've been walking along the edge
so it's been said
And you're feeling so out of place
it's in your head

It's the end of the line, it's the end of the line

I'm taking my time, I've swallowed my pride
if she never comes back to me
Hello my goodbye, I'm taking what's mine
so I'm stopping the memories
it's the end of the line, only one stays behind

You've been hanging so long in despair
it shows on your face
even time couldn't heal what was there
it can't be erased

It's the end of the line, it's the end of the line

I'm taking my time...

I'm taking my time, I'm taking my time
just to spit it all out of me
