Once upon a time you were a child
and you started this endless fight
life is built on a dream, disappointment, stormy seas
always hoped for so much more
than life had offered you before
Now you start to see new things
like a flower blooms in spring

A new day will come
and you'll find all the answers
and the kiss of hope
comes powerful and fast
As you feel so alive, for the first time in your life
you are relieved

Never lost your faith in me, even when we lost belief
we were silent and displaced
we always knew we'd find our way

Look around and you will see
there is so much love for you to receive even in our darkest days
we always knew we'd find our way

A new day will come
and you'll find all the answers...

And I see this world is beautiful
full of opportunities
it was made for you and me

A new day will come
and you'll find all the answers
and the kiss of hope
comes powerful and fast
As you feel so alive, for the first time in your life
a new day will born
