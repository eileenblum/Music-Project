Don't leave me out
just let me in
so you won't be love that I lost
love that I lost
as the feeling grows
I need you so
recast our roles
love that I lost, love that I lost
stop wrecking my heart, stop wrecking my heart, stop wrecking my heart

Don't leave me like this
it's not an option
you're my fortune, my blessing, all I want
say you need me
even you don't mean it no, no
You're my fortune, my blessing love that I lost
love that I lost, love that I lost, love that I lost, love that I lost

Don't feel yourself
just smile and pretend
I guess you know my name
I'm love that you're lost
I'm love that you lost

Stop wrecking your heart, stop wrecking your heart
Stop wrecking your heart

Don't leave me like this...

It's the end of the line, it's the end of the line
