(Like blood on blood, like blood on blood)

Remember when I scared you away and you took the blame
I was half you loved me whole
you were mine from flesh to soul

Don't you see how my wounds bleed they won't heal
you're living proof

You're the one I ever loved
my chosen one I could always trust
now the years are passing by freezing hearts so cold
A thousand times we swore and more
that we would stay blood on blood
all I have is your name , deep down in my soul
(like blood on blood)

Years go by, they're fading away
like the promise we made, of being forever young, wild and free
without knowing what it means

Now I see, how your wounds bleed they won't heal
you're living proof

Your the one I ever loved...

You never believed that the weight of the years could be heavier
by the light that you brought
I was a fighter but thought without you
I'd give in

You're the one I ever loved...

All I have is your name burn marked deep down in my soul... (like blood on blood)
all I have is your name burn marked deep down in my soul
