Remember the time you used to say
We've come to the end of our own way
Or this journey has just begun.
You're the lesson cursed I've never learned
You're the flames in the fire when we burn
I ain't got time for you and I
Someday when I become old and wise
I'm able to explain to you
Why love is kind to be cruel

Forget the grief to celebrate
Come enjoy this dance on the edge
Together it's softer to fall
You know I am afraid to say it loud
You know I'm too scared to spit it out
I have to scream and shout

We can't go on [6x]

No more excuses for me to go
No excuses that I know
Oh my darling we're doomed to fail
Just can't get the words out of my head
No reason to wait for better days
Life's a bitch and then we die

We can't go on [6x]

All this time I trusted you
And fooled myself I was dumb
Love is just for the fools and I've heard
It should be fun
It might be fun
It can't be fun...
