Like seasons change their face,
Rain like the tears
Winds got your voice
Whispering my name
Landing shadows come around
Telling me the same old story
With certain sound

Iâm stuck in a place
Prisoner of this room
Painful memories of me and you
I take colors of longing
And paint you on my wall
Is it too much to ask
For some golden peace
Thatâs what I expect from you at least
Itâs simple and understood
Thereâs no way out

I wish that I would be dead
Dead like you and I
Falling like a butterfly
After one lived day
Hope you will find your peace
Immortal, eternal and real
I know I cannot be dead yet
Just canât live it again

Too much never enough
Weâre stuck in time
Till death leads us away
In a moment that Iâm scared of the most
Youâre sleeping away
Soon youâll be lost
Every breath that you take
Youâll be closer to where you belong
I never thought this could be so hard and rough
After all weâve been through
Canât get enough of this sweetest trip
You once gave me as a gift

I hope youâre waiting for me somewhere out there
In a place where we can hold each other again
You went first, Iâll come right after you
Iâm depressed, I donât care
I miss you, I hope you can hear me
