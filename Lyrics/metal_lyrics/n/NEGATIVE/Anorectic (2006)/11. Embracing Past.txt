Autumn rain in December
Darkness offers company
Some part of me
Doesn't want to remember
How could I forget?

I don't wanna talk about
Of worse or of some better
Why can't we stay?
Like this
Forever
While the rain
Has become so much colder
Embracing past,
It's not gonna last any longer!

I keep on thinking,
Thinking its so relieving
To hear how you feel
To know that you're not rejecting me yet
Would you ever think of me?
You know I can't stand when you say so
Oh how much I hate

I don't wanna talk about
Of worse or of some better
Why can't we stay?
Like this
Forever
While the rain
Has become so much colder
Embracing past,
It's not gonna last any longer! [2x]
