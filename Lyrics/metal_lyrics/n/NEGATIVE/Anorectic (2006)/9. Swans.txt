Thrill of fear
Flash of cruelty
Was what I sensed
Of the signs you were sending
Lives as one
But separated
Who'll draw the lines
Who tells when it's too late?

And as the swans prepare for their leaving
Can't change what's done it's unforgiven
Bitter is the taste
Of your way
Cannot rewind
Can't take it back...

The picture is clear
And so brave,
But you wanted to have it
Your own way
Sometimes things are
As they seem...

And as the swans prepare for their leaving
Can't change what's done it's unforgiven
Bitter is the taste
Of your way
Cannot rewind
Can't take it back

How long do we have? [2x]

And as the swans prepare for their leaving
Can't change what's done it's unforgiven
Bitter is the taste
Of your way
Cannot rewind
Can't take it back

How long do we have?

As the swans prepare for their leaving (How long do we have?)
Can't change what's done it's unforgiven (How long do we have?)
Bitter is the taste
Of your way (How long do we have?)
Cannot rewind
Can't take it back

The swans prepare for their leaving...
