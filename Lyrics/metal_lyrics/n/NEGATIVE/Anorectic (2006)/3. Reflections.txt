I wasn't solid enough to be
Things you rather wanted to see in me
Should I forget myself to get over you
all I can do is pretend and lie to myself
over and over again

Ghost of you, still breathing
it won't leave me alone
it keeps on teasing
Reflections of eternity are dark as hell
now I can see
Of that I'm glad my heart and soul are still mine

I couldn't stop believing in fantasies
you destroyed then forgot, now I rebuilt
This promised land made by sand of an hour glass misplaced
It's broken, it has disappeared and so have you
