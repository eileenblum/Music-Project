It's a misty morning
But I feel like I can fly
Every step that I take
Is heavier than a thousand miles

Concrete jungle's calling
And I'm sure I don't want to resist
It's a one way high
Turn me on with the devils kiss

Who would want to spend a lifetime
With bad self esteem?
Don't you never ever think about it
You will see that there's no doubt about it

The pleasure we never had is in our hands
This night is like a rollercoaster ride, babe
Just shut your mouth and you will get your race

The spell is all around this is our chance
Just take my hand, don't ask me why
'Cause I don't know
Show me the smile that kills
And make me beg some more

Soon the night is over
You're underdoped just take your time
Here is one for you
Before you know it blows your mind

Here the hell freezes over
And seven days have gone so fast
And cash that I got
Is from the chaos that I planned

Who would want to spend a lifetime
With bad atmosphere?
Me neither if you know what I'm saying
Forget the bullshit what they keep on telling

The pleasure we never had is in our hands
This night is like a rollercoaster ride, babe
Just shut your mouth and you will get your race

The spell is all around this is our chance
Just take my hand, don't ask me why
'Cause I don't know
Show me the smile that kills
And make me beg some more [2x]
