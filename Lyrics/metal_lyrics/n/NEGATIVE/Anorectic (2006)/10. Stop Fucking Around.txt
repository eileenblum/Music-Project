Remains of sympathy
That's kind of what you left me with
Our divided destinies
Nailed to be lost
Beauty marks of history
Easily will repeat itself
I have nothing to prove to you
This time I'll take and make my move

There's no "you're the one"
Only hollow heart of mine
Sealed with damage done
Choice was yours so don't be a child

Lies accusations
I won't crawl I'll take your pride
Otherwise you will proudly
Stay above everything
In case love is dead
Can't let myself go to waste
You wanna taste my revenge
This time I'll turn my back on you

Hey you!
Look what you have done to me
All my feelings turn to hate
All your sickness insanity
Makes me a mess so I won't wait...

There's no "you're the one"
Only hollow heart of mine
Sealed with damage done
Choice was yours so don't be a child
Stop messin' around... Stop fuckin' around... [3x]
