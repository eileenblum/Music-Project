We used to be so perfect
we came together fine
it seemed like a crime
This world so blind
we once created
more than a fairytale
Oh, how we shined
Not anymore [x4]

I sing for justice
Here we stand in time
Waiting for our one last shot
Shot to come in

This world so blind
we once created
where faked, painted smiles
felt so naked

I was blind without a stick
Taste of morphine on your lips
made me sick
Never learned to love surprises
Respecting how we swore
Eye for an eye
Smile for a smile
Not anymore

When your wings are torn
The distance between right and wrong
is too short
and it feels you got nothing
left to lose
Sky above falling down
You feel abused

And I donât want it
no I donât want it
This endless mile
That we are walking
Waiting for one last shot
To come in
But we need it
Somehow we need it
This unknown that weâre suffering for
Losing hold of what we were before

Whereâs the mercy?
When we needed the most
When we canât hold on
Iâll be OK
Iâll be alright
Nothing can break me down
No one can hurt me
As long as you say
That youâll stay
another day
We used to be so perfect
We came together fine
It seemed like a crime
