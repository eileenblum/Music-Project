On and on I was looking for freedom
less and more I found it by you
this darkened sky of our heavenly kingdom
the thing in common is there's not so
much left to say

Are you ready or not?
ready for the truth?
sick and tired of this nonsense
I'm frustrated by you

The signs of silence are
getting louder
breaking the bond we
protected so long

I don't see a reason
to ponder with this
any longer
there's no turning back
just one way to fall
fall apart

Are you ready or not?
ready for the truth?
sick and tired of this nonsense
I'm frustrated by you

In a life that we live in
for the love we believed in
this might be the day we die
so we can be born again

And life should be easy
when there's someone to hold on
that's what they told me
that's what I thought

Are you ready or not
ready for the truth
sick and tired of this nonsense
I'm frustrated by you

In a life that we live in
for the love we believed in
this might be the day we die
so we can be born again

On and on still looking for freedom
Planet Of The Sun
