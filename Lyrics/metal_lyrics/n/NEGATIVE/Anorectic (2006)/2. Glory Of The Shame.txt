This revolution in my mind
This generation will be mine
With the satisfaction
Only strongest will survive

Close enough to pain
Pleasure screams your name
I've seen this one before
Glory of the shame
You're the shelter
I'm the storm
That will never be calm
Glory of the shame
It goes by the name...

Be ware I'm here to take control
Only I can save your rotten soul
For the devastation that drove you
Our of your mind
