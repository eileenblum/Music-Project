I do not need your fucking prayers your kind reeks of arrogance
I am the master of my domain shredding through your flesh
Breaking your feeble bones tell me now who is your master
No one will grieve for you they will not even know you are gone
Now I turn the blade on myself ripping the flesh from my bones
Sadistic power fills my soul I do not stop at the sight of blood
My body dies but I am forever human life is worthless the pain carries on

Unworthy of life disgrace to mankind
You fucking sheep you forever disgust me
I am Legion vomit the body of Christ
The strength of hell within me the devil exists in us
