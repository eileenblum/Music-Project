Serpents unholy forces they speak to me wolves among the flock
They have stayed with me never turned their backs on me
Yet you have betrayed me now I turn my back on you

Godless without fear forsaken hopeless
These words I speak this oath I swear
Never will I return never will I feel again
Endless misery paradise a fucking dream
Weakness and apathy fuck your prophecy
