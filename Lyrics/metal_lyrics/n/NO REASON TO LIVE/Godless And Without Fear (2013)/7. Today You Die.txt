I would cut your throat just to watch you bleed
I will never let this go and this world you have to leave
Low life scum hiding behind your words
You are dead weight mother fucker
I am your final nightmare

All you had to do was just walk away but you had to prove you were tough
And then you got fucked up childish games will get you slain
You wasted your time because today you die
Mind your own business show some respect
You do not respect shit and that is why today you die
You cannot fucking change this disgrace you call your life
So I will finish this and that is why today you die
What the fuck did you think now no one has your back
I will wait for you until you pay your dues
I wear my scars with pride but all you do is hide
You wasted your time and that is why today you die

Somewhere someday our paths will cross again
I swear you will remember my face you will remember my name
Forever in this world who can you trust everyone is out for themselves
Do not put faith in the human race live as a wolf or die as a sheep
Life is too short for your fucking games trust no one
