I hate this fucking world in perfect harmony
I sink into depression I reject all warm I loathe you all contemplative and alone
My only emotion is disgust for everything I have come to know.
I hate this fucking world I will not be controlled so keep your fucking prayers
Because I am going down in flames

Incessant and cruel I am callous and full of disdain
Without solitude I am nothing there can be no remission
No resemblance of normalcy complete fucking despair everyday
Everyday is a struggle and this fight goes on forever
One thing is for certain some days I win and some days I lose
I will never compromise what I know to be true time is killing me
