I have witnessed no miracles there is no saving grace
I lie awake thankful for nothing
I was born to murder the world

Dark lord I beg of you please embrace me like your sodomized son
My only faith resonates with misery
Dark lord I am the one you seek I have survived your suffering and despair
Satan I hear you speak but they are my words that you say
Take me I do not belong here I never have

You were never there I starved and bled
You did nothing so you are nothing you fucking coward
Now here I stand at one with the darkness
If God exists he is nothing to me
Can you hear me God? You are nothing
