The storm approaches do not look back
Learn and bleed but dwell on nothing
Turned to stone you cannot break me
I am what you wish you could be
Spineless worthless you are all the same
Cannot think for yourself God is to blame

Greed breeds ignorance it manipulates you
Controls you your voice is poison
Just play the game every day the same
Waiting to die you wasted your life
I bleed like you but we are not the same
You do not speak for us I have my own voice
