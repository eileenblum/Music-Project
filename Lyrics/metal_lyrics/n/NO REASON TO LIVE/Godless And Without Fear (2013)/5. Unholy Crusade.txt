They only have the power that we give
Step on their throats and they die
No icons no gods there is no one watching out for us
Strike fear in their hearts splatter the blood of the lamb
If you threaten my life I will kill you

You never taught me to be a man you only told me to live in fear
Serve yourself
The beast within me rises I am human no more
A lifeless soulless killer with the compassion for this world
you made us doubt every fucking day,
Do you blame us that our hearts beat with hate.
Serve yourself

Tear down the statues burn every church the word of the Lord is treason
There is no God Father I ask why have you forsaken us?
Father I ask why have you forsaken us why?
No gods no saviours no heaven we are all alone
