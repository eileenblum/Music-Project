I live in the shadows I have no name
I seek no faith I burn with rage
Unforgiving my art is death
Darkness my oath like a disease I infect
I will make you suffer and regret you were born
No fairy tale ending you will fucking pay
My master is the devil and I am here to carry out his will

Liars thieves takers of innocence I will come for you I am the truth
Minuscule weaklings I know you all mass murder I will destroy this world
In a sea of fire I am reborn strongest in darkness I defy your world
Will you surrender to powers that be will you fight or remain fucking weak
Your words don't mean shit to me fuck you and what you believe
