Flying creatures covers the sky
A shockwave of fear appear
The vicious bastards strikes down on us
We're not willing to give in

This battle will reign this earth for years
But we have no fear
The cleansing ov small minded freaks
Will all set us free

We kill, in the name of Satan
The warlord of hell
We harvest their pathetic souls
In order to please the beast

We kill, in the name of Satan
The warlord of hell
We slaughter their heads will roll
In order to please the beast

No more terror from the guardians of the sky
No more bowing down
Our call has been heard and answered
We draw strength from the ground

The earth sends pillars of fire into the air
Burning their wings
Waves of melted rock appears
Drowning them on the ground
