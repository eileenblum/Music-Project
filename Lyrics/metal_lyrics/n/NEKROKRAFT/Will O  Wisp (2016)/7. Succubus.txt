Created in the depths ov hell
Crawling up from the ground
To entangle your soul in
Eternal flames

Washing your brain with thoughts
Of enjoyment, your brain is
Withering away
Into the state of oblivion

This is the succubus
Risen from hell
She will lure you with her spells
A lure with forbidden flesh

Changing her sex, look and appearance
To blend with the human seed
A demon from hell with human skin and blood

Half human with a devil inside
Has come to this earth to seduce
Forcing his will and every need

The succubus will tear you apart
She will feast on your soul
