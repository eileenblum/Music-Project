With grinning mouths full of teeth
Sharp as the edge of a blade
Thirst for blood
Thirst for sacrifice

A slip, a fall, flesh touch the ground
Horrific laughs and sounds of terror

From the shadows they appear
To capture whom is near
To drag away, the unlucky chump
Right down under a fallen tree stump

The lurker arise to smell the meat
He has begun to tire of wheat
Which filled his belly for weeks and months
An orgie of flesh, and all is gone

Remaining bones are grind to flour
And now covers the mountains all four
In the realm of the lurker
A supreme abomination of lust

The darkness falls and the lurker
Awakes, calling his army of imps
A darkening forest, full of demons
Seared limb from limb

In every bush, in every tree
Eyes glowing bright
Watching, and waiting for a
Foot placed wrong
They hunger for a feast tonight

A woman now gone
But still you can hear her song
Echoing thru the pine trees crust
As the lurker still takes her with lust

She cannot flee from the nightmare awake
Just lie there and take it and shake
Violation of a woman's womb
As she get her virginity succumbed
