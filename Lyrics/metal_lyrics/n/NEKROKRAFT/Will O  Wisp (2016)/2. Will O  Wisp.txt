Something gleaming in between the trees
In disguise as an orb of light
Do not stray from the road ahead
Keep your path, and you will be safe

Rain or haze, always visible
Lures weak mind astray
Never trust, a spirit of the marsh
Murky water is a shallow grave

It is the will of the wisp
To take your life away
What's there in the mist
You better walk another way

Rotting corpses below the moss
The bog reeks of death
Struggling body's sink like a stone
The quicksand will eat you whole

It is the will of the wisp
