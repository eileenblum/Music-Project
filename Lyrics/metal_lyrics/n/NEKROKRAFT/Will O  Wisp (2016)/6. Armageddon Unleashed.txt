Armageddon unleashed
Carving out your soul
Bodies burned to ashes
Hell awaits the innocent

Creationist celebrate
As the prophecy comes true
Mortal soul connected to earth by flesh

Hailing stones of fire
From the sky, to the plains
Cities shattered asunder,
Under acid fucking rain

Earthquake open up the ground
Letting helldogs out to kill
Hunting to the last
The cursed reign of humanity ends

Water rises drowning the weak
Fire cleanses all life on earth
Wind tears the land asunder
Earth opens dragging down
