Entombed soul, covered in darkness
Laced in lies, born to be an offering
From the summit, he was cast
To quench the thirst of god

Sacrifice the unbeliever
The god want to claim your soul

Falling like an angel, Lucifer
On his way to a glorious citadel
Under his command your kingdom come
Risen again as his minion

Now is the time
Fallen angel rule the sky
Worship the righteous
Worship the fallen, worship
