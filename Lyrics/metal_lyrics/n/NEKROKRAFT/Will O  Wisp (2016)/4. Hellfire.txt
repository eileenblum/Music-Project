Have you seen, the brightest flame from hell
With sulfur it eradicates and smell
Human flesh consumed
As life itself is doomed

Like a flaming arrow from the sky
A black flame watch as you die
Weakness of the human soul
Let us consume you whole

As the embers burn still
The unborn have his unspoken will
Ashes left to smolder
The hatred grows older and older

My torch burn bright, as you gaze at your demise
Snow turns to ice, on your bare skin
Frozen to the ground, the tundra has its will
A corpse, cold and bleak
Laying there, forever still

We are reborn, in hellfire
