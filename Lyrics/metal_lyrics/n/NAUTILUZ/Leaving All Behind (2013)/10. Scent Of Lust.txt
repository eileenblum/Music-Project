How many times has the rising sun reached your face?
After a crazy night of moans and drinks
You tried to hide the scent of lust
That you left but till now
There's something you forgot to do:

To ask me who rules my world
Well you'll know
Your love has now turned to stone
But I'll see my dreams come true
'Cause I know
Redemption is life without you

The sun may fall
The seas will dry
For now and on my tears won't show
It's shine on my eyes 'cause the
Scene of life
Starts tonight
Running on with my own song
My spirit can escape from your curse
You wake up with your fake
Smile on my bed
And reach out for my belt
To ease our pain
You always seemed to be so sure
Of what we wanted
But never wondered about
What you lost:
The power to rule my world

Well you'll know
Your love has now turned to stone
But I'll see my dreams come true
'Cause I know
Redemption is life without you

And guess now who rules my world?
Well you'll know
My soul has now turned to stone
And I'll see my dreams come true
'Cause I know
Redemption starts on my own...

...The scene of life
Starts tonight
Running on with my own song
My spirit is sure that

The sun won't fall
And seas won't dry
For now and on my tears are lost
Forever in time 'cause the
Scene of life
Starts tonight
Running on with my own song
My spirit can escape from your curse
