Lonely talkings by your side
Made me believe that I was fighting light
Twisted minds
I took a look into your heart
Tried to discover things that made you raw
Ripped your soul

Thereâs nothing out there strong
Enough to break the steel
Of what I believe in
Now hold my hand and let our dreams ignite

Face the wind and take the skies
The things we fight for are brighter
Than a million stars
Keep on learning from what you live
No cries of death tonight will bring down
Our burning hearts

Freaking faces in my way
They laugh and twist trying to bring me down
Make me doubt
This paradox inside my head
âTo find the way back to reality
Fight for dreamsâ
