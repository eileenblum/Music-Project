Back in the days
They used to fight for freedom
Many of them
Buried in tears decided to fade...

...Under the waning moon they prayed aloud!
"Save us from the curse of the gods!"

Stronger than all
A fearless heart is hungry
For revenge and
Unleashing anger from his eyes...
...against the madness he will fight
Till death, bringing hope
And shouting at them

"We are free
Now it's time
We can fly and reach the skies
Feel your heart beating strong
Leaving all behind
Don't give up
Now it's your time!"
