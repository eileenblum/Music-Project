Inside our dreams there's something
Hidden we shall claim
Taking root into the mist and shapes
Looking for truths under
The moonlight to be free...
A sort of darkness blinds the way

(The skies fall and time stops)
The fear betrays your faith
Breaking your fantasy and dreams
(The skies fall and time stops)
Beyond the power you'll find the answers
To fight and carry on, go on...

So far away, the rising sun seems grey
Along the path of death is shown your way
Under your spell, in vain you try to escape
From this nightmare no one can awake

Forced and lost in time
Forever we will stay in here with no freedom
And hearing cries of pain reflecting our end
No mercy in your eyes tonight...
