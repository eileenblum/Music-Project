The sun sets again behind my door
It takes away the illusions from my world
All that's left behind
The cold and the pain announcing times
When the roses fall and die

I'm just a broken lonely child
A voice in the silence of the night
That no one heard between the lies
Again...

I run away
Into the train
Where all my dreams are reality
Your fights can't hurt me
Inside my shelter...
Clashing the toy rails on and on

All your tears felt down
When my eyes could not see the light
The white rose on my grave
Couldn't calm the storm in your days
