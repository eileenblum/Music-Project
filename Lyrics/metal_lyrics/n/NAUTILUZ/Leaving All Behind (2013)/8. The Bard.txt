"Nam myoho renge kyo"
"Om mani padme hum"
I think I've seen these things before
Am I still dreaming? Tell me, I don't know!

You will find, my friend, the right trail to go on
Thou will reach the light, don't feel alone

Cry out, believer!
Forever here you'll stay!
Cry out, deceiver!
We are the ones
We'll take your soul

Fire! Will ease all your grieves
(Breaking away)
You will hear my chanting forever
Time! To free all thy fears
(Breaking away)
We will reach
Enlightenment together
Beyond death!

I don't want to be here anymore
My body's aching, please just let me go
