Last night I went to the forgotten garden, our place.
I hope someday you realize that I live for you.

Black roses have fallen on our land,
I feel your tears through the cold rain.
Nature is dying here with our love.
The wind seems to be stuck in time .

Walking into our secret place,
I can see that our love is still there.
I still miss the way you smiled and you held my hand but your essence won't fade away.

Somehow I hear a whisper behind me.
It can't be.

There's something deep in your beautiful eyes
Just like a spark that calls me back
Hear my voice and my song only in your dreams
Every spring...

Darling donât play with me
How do you dare?

Iâm gonna leave it all behind.

Walking into our secret place,
I can see that our love is still there.
I still miss the way you smiled and you held my hand but your essence won't fade away.
