I crossed the shadows falling and standing up
Trying to find what no one could find
The mysteries of life will never understand
Till I can find the light again

Oh I'll never forget...
My dreams will come true

I see the death beside me all the time
But my faith will never die
"The circle of life's always running in your mind
Follow my spirit now"

"Don't leave aside what you want"
I run without fear
"Do not lose your head again
Because you can fall..."

In the dark I hear a voice
It says "Tomorrow is the day of the light"
They'll never understand what I lived
Until the end I will always be chasing the light
