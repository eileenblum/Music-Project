Break open the skull, tear open the flesh 
Reveal the weakness that lies within 
Easily lured, cries unheard 
They'll beg for mercy from our kin 

Life flows from this place 
Herald the coming end of this waste 
Born as nothing, you squander your gifts 
I will forcefully widen this rift 
Born as nothing, you squander 

What is a man but a miserable pile of secrets? 
Too few persist in the strengthening of the will 
Drowned, freed, begging to be believed 
Crosses turned, you are your own disease 

The spell can't be broken, the seal is ancient 
Though on banishing you are hellbent 
I'll remain in my domain, until I am awakened 
For the presence of evil cannot be broken 

Try to escape the flames of hate 
Torture and misery await 
Do you wish to be freed of your crippling fate? 
Dissolved in acid, nailed to a cross 
Frozen and helpless in unending hellfrost 
In mockery of the lord you have lost
