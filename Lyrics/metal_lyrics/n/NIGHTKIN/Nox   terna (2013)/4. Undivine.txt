Spawn of the shifting netherworld 
Ancient mass of blackened will 
Incarnate of filth 
It's touch; consuming 

To fill the body with evil 
To fill the body with cold 
How I desire the touch of nothingness 

To erase me from all that exists 
To free me from all being 
How I desire to hear the squirming of its parasites 
To feel the sharpened feathers lacerating my skin 

Awaken the beings that speak with the dead 
It is a grand process of undivine kinship 

Titans walk in the place of birth 
Ancient mass of blackened will 
Incarnate of filth 

Praise the beast! 
I'll fast for 40 nights 
Spill my blood, altar prepared 
A feast of carnage
