For centuries my line has carried on the quest 
To seek the devil and lay his wicked soul to rest 
Up in his castle, with a curse upon his breath 
He will die tonight, I'll celebrate his wicked death 

At the entrance, a terrifying gloom 
Air so foul, reeks of doom 
Cloud of vermin, now gnawing at my skin 

Shrouded in darkness, an abyss of sin 
Holy orders bind me, shielding from those within 

Disturbance inevitable, their voices in my head 
Fingers claw my flesh, awaken the rotting dead 

Descending into the vile crypt 
Putrid abominations, limb from limb are ripped 
Blood is flowing, crossing a sickening lake of slime 
Covered in gore, a distant church bell chimes 

The sounding of wolves beckons me toward my fate 
Grandfather's map leads me to this place 
Antechamber strewn with bones of heroes 
Tonight I'll end this curse at last 

Erupting thunder 
Our battle unfolds 
Holy relics shine 
The final bell now tolls 

Promising weatlh and power 
You'll die on your knees 
I'll rid the world of your disease 

Shrouded in darkness 
An abyss of fire 
Overflowing army, a twisted mass of flesh 
This place, the embodiment of unrest
