There is no time like the past 
The place I live, I live it alone 
Unburying the memories that loosely dress my wounds 

Speaking is irrelevant, dreams are abstract 
What little semblance of thought is fact? 

Each step I take; a painful recollection 
Every sound made; nostalgic infection 

The fire is waning 
Embers once raging 
Flames, now flickers 
My resolve now withers 

But what of man and of war? 
Machines that destroyed all I abhor 
How do I accept those I've denied 
When every ounce of my humanity's died 

I dream of a shore washing the blood away 
Carry me to my place of burial 
I cannot bear it any longer 

No turning point, no movement 
Stagnation, my eternal bride 

Trudge through a sea of dead cells 
Long ago this was more
