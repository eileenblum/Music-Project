Life is too short for me 
To learn all I must 
Knowledge and mysteries 
Books gathering dust 

To hone my eldritch might 
More lifetimes I must live 
Escape mortality 
The gods will not forgive 

Deep in the darkest texts 
I find the rites that I need 
Unbinding soul from flesh 
Requires that I bleed 

Mutilation 
Excarnation 
Defilement 
Condemnation 

Open my veins 
Into the golden well it drips 
Inscribe forbidden words 
Upon the parchment strips 

Perform the ritual 
Black magic will create 
Precious phylactery 
To keep my essence safe 

From this day forward 
I will never be more whole 
Into this ebon box 
I seal away my soul 

Initiation 
Incantation 
Recitation 
Invocate 

The years wear on 
The flesh has fallen off my my bones 
My power grows 
As I devour ancient tomes 

A crown upon my skull 
My eyes are empty pools 
I drape my bones in silk 
Replace my teeth with jewels 

Enslaving mortal men 
I feast upon their lives 
My soul lives on 
Until the end of days arrives 

Coronation 
Profanation 
Conflagration 
Ruination
