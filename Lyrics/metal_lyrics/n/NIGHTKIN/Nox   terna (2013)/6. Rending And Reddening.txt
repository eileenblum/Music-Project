Vile and loathesome, years of vice and debauchery 
Limitless, sickness, rife with sodomy 
Seeking and reeking, in pain you are weakening 
Dying to be reborn in torture 

Flesh torn and bound 
Unending torment in secrets found 
We have come from beyond the void 
Your threshold is cruelly destroyed 

Your existence is trivial 
Ours is endless 
We'll separate your soul 
From your flesh 

Dimensions where pain and pleasure meet 
Open the doors to agony you seek 
Explosive rush of senses employed 
Awakened by that which you have toyed 

Saw-mouthed beings, here to dismember 
Nothing of life you will remember 

Burning alive, awakened in fire 
Over stimulation of your filthy desires 
Made to suffer, plunged headfirst 
Drained of every drop of your worth 

No escape 
Torn apart 
Unending torment
