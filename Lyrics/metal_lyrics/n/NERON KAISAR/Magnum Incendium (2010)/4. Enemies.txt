When the sun will come beyond the horizon,
And birds of god will cease to sing with alive,
Stars in heaven night they will begin to sparkle
for the last time for our enemies â¦ 

Our numbers are tightly closed,
our steps beat off clear rhythm,
reporting last hours of life,
life our enemies â¦ 

Death, death approaches death,
beyond the horizon dust,
As a throne of satan are raised,
Ravens turn above city,
Marking place of death for livings 

Our weapon - cold steel, our blood simmers,
Hate in our hearts more firmly,
Desires of yours to live and to win! 
Our numbers are tightly closed,
our steps - sand glasses,
reporting last breaths in lives,
lives of our enemies â¦ 

Death hung, as a smoke of big fire,
City, what will become house of ghosts,
night after night will burn how now completely,
and to remind to all of our enemies
that their cities can become huddle of stones and coal â¦
