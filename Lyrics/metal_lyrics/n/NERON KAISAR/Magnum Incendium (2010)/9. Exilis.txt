The day of reckoning comes,
I open the Gate,
Letting out terrifying creatures
Who will devil souls and flesh
Will doom to a purgatory of those
Who worshiped you
And trusted in your miracles,
I know how to hurt you
Though you donât feel the pain,
Burning on an eternal
fire thoughts,
dreams and slavish will,

I will writhe in a universal ecstasy, looking enjoying,
As bodies of your slaves smoulderâ¦

And will rise in heavens blue,
Hundred thousand columns,
Carrying away black ashes,
Closing with dense clouds all firmament,
Blinding you,

You donât hear a prayer that uplift to you the doomed souls,
You donât see the sufferings corroding reason and a flesh,
You canât help, having stretched to them the hands
And to facilitate suffering of belief
Which cannot rescue themâ¦
