Fire fills blood-red eyes,
Look into souls of doomed!
We are deaf to voice of mercy,
For scorched bodies is what we like.
Spite will soothe our bleeding wounds,
We shall butcher the kin of foe.
Senseless and scornful to endless stabs,
Weâll pull out their rebellious hearts
With the power of our bare hands

I hate their horrid breath,
You hate gleam of their wild eyes.
I scorn the frailty of mortal life,
You want to drive their bones into mud.
I shall chase them to Infernal Gate,
You shall burn them corpse after corpse.
They will tear their throats in unholy pain,
I shall reap the harvest of deaths.
You shall raise the stronghold of Hell

We shall sit beside the Temple of Malice.
Our weaponâs imprinted in their dead eyes.
Weâre looking at our doom through the burning ruins,
Only the sorrow can be our judge.
A drama unfolded in murky heaven.
The vengeance will be our lifeâs companion
