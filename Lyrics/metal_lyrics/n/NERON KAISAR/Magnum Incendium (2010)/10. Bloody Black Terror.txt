Scorched flesh on stakes
Admiration for the eyes of bigot, 
Fear, horror and pain of agony, 
To those, who believes him.
In worshiping the image of higher power 
Return for unbearable pain 
Melted in the fire at the dark, 
Highlighting gloomy feast â cruel revelry. 

Defile yourself 
And give praise to the master 
Your world is doomed, 
You are slave of endless power, 
Wash with enemy's blood, 
And shroud your flesh with human's skin.

Dark worlds master
Lord of the fiery mountains, 
This is your master, 
Prove to him your loyalty! 
Death by death, Pain after pain 
Honor by honor. Bloody-black terror!

Hunted animal is caught and thrown to
Similar to him, on public devour, 

Praise to those, who allowed to behold 
so bloody-callous performance. 

Laugh in the face before his execution, 
Their minds have always relied on imaginary light 
Knock prop, hanging them on a real death 
There is no salvation, meet your destiny.

The cries, prayers and groans 
Music, which leads to a soulless ecstasy. 
Defile yourself 
And give praise to the master 

Your world is doomed, 
you are slave of endless power, 
Wash with enemy's blood, 
And shroud your flesh with human's skin...
Bloody black terror!
