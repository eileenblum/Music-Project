"A me et Agrippa nisi detestabile et malo publico nasei petuisse!"
Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus

She had spewed out of carrion's womb...
Mark of the beast burned on her body!
Night after night, she fed mildew,
Preparing ditch to each somebody!
Her soul, screaming, sank into
The ground for the hundred miles!
She waited for the light from blue,
Had crucified a soul on piles,
And eager daemon looked for womb
Child's father was fulfilled of sins,
And beast inside her gan to bloom
From charred faith's peaks of burden's wings!

Hostis generis humani!

Mysterious, forbidding, she held a people's lives in strangle!
With lust for power, she-wolf ate the shades and wove the livid tangle
Of fates of mortals, trading it in her damned store at bloody crossroad
Doomed all to teachery and rot for they were poorly faulted

More and more she's filled with anger and self-hatred, esurient...
In contractions, begged the gods about birth of son as flint,
But the gods betrayed again awarding her a hailer
Of ardour and of lust and all the living's failure

Body's severed, and the light saw a dream with look of beast...
Hundred days she dreamed about creature, and this torment ceased!
And she said to ebon sky name of child, profound-begotten...
Beastly-mouthed Nero grew with the anger to all, tautened
Regime fell at killer's feet, sensed with smell of massive rabies...
Sank into the epoch's games where the victor kills the races!
Feeling cold of perfidy, flesh had melted, starved by power...
Born by greed, the dreadful butcher deadened mother belching fire -

Dum ego vivus terra misceatur igni!

She had spewed out of carrion's womb...
Mark of the beast burned on her body!
Night after night, she fed mildew,
Preparing ditch to each somebody!
