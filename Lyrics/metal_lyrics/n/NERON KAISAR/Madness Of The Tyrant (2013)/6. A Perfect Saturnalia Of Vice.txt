Close your eyes and open your tired flesh for dark
It's crowded here, but thou (cursed one) shall like it...
Lets see on what their flesh is capable
And how pleasant to stab these creations!
Follow to the world of seduced,
Pleasures wander among doomed,
Their bodies wriggling, will crave for each other,
Being washed slightingly by sap of buried slaves...

Post mortem nihil est...

For Death it doesn't matter neither sex nor age!
Houses and squares are filling with bareness and lust
We intertwined in madness and excess,
Everybody's loyal to the order!
Go carefully through copulating medley,
You can interrupt their last dream!
Glide on shouts and on ecstasy' path
You see, how eyelids are filled with blood,
And streets - with roar, you are doomed!

Fiat iustitia, et pereat iniuria...

I'll show you city you dreamed to be born, but you will die
This palace was built on those who believed that the first was the "word" (oh aye!)
This place will rise from human tissues!!!
Weâll call it in honour of the Father of human collapseâ¦
Lets set up wooden bed, impregnated with desires,
All doors are open to those who tempted with salacity!

Ad restim res rediit!

As the curtain will fall before this feast,
Everbody will turn back in mad creations!
Praetorians will add the blood in bowls, dependent on belief, diluted with wine!
Father of Chaos looks from the throne at a swarming rags and dirt,
Mankind is burning at his eyes!
On columns instead of lamps the decaying scum burns!!!
