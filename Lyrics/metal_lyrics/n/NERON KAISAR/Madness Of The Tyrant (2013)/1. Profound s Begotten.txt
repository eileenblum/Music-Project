In the endless darkness of timelessness, between chaos and harmony,
Where the light is powerless as a slave chained to the wall
Daemons flew from everywhere, blacker than darkness,
Screaming and howling in silence of that greatest hall
The one who fallen angel, whose wings hath blocked the path of light
And shadow poured the mortals to death just for the devil,
Was cast into the bottomless abyss of night,
Where he could not enshroud people by his deathful veil...

He decided to call all the dark, evil daemons
And avenge their foes â light mind and people
For his bloodiest sweets, spilling the semen
And he whirling and lashing amongst vile spirits
He whispered his evil plan in their minds
To officiate for opening of portal to the worlds of light
And procreate the beast that will excruciate the children of light

After the first sacramental, he cut the boundless line by his claw
And the light poured in dense world of daemons,
Filling them with unbearable awe
But the fallen angel overspread his wings,
Barred the breach by himself, oh!
And let his letiferous shade âpon the fiends,
Allowing them to make the last ceremonial riteâ¦

Mysterium magnum!

The beasts hath hoarded it and now squeezing out
The seed of evil, blot and rampant immorality,
Increasing orgies of their bestial insanity
Inhaling the essence of Orkus and made it into dust
To spray a rotten seed on common bed
Of genitors of Nero!
Lust...

Nomen est omen.
