Enjoying revenge and pain that hurts inside
On servant the lord perpetrated his fun,
Eternilized the memory of man his awful sin,
Forever he thought to make branded him
Find those mean minds were not afraid to slant the truth in favor,
Evoked in their thoughts his artful story-pavor,
That shall leave scar on onesâ forehead
More deeply than the sharpest blade...

Curse fell on the living as Nenia,
And lord was cursed, envenomed by fruits of his deeds,
Hhe turned to ash inside thatâs
Flying in the darkness like the ardent leaves

And he heard his despair
And the cries of the mob tore his flesh

Around him a trap, conspiracy are lurking, enveloped shame afresh,
And heavy thoughts perched on his shoulders, murmured:
Â«Run, run and hide you from yourselfÂ»

It was too late to hide and cornered
By hounds on his heels and self,
And there is not the wisdom that rescued him so ever,
It died from its own wicked hands and sins forever,
And owned thoughtâs hysterically screaming:
- Kill! Rather kill myself! Wherever!

Denigration veined by old men,
Word of mouth, from scroll to the eyes,
And the lie as timeless curse, penned,
Laid on puppet of fallen foul mind

For ever and a sempitern day,
It hammered into the heads
As a brand are those sacraments
Of sneaky crone greybeards that succumbed this way

The legs canât run away forever
From their own frights, eheu!
And deadly wind acidly blew
His pride and power of Deo â
Barefoot, stabbed sword into the throat...
Qualis artifex pereo!
