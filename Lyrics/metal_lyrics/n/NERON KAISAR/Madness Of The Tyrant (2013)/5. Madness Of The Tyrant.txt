My evil despite to your good
Will eternally torment your sons,
The excesses, bringing to me a sweet tremble,
Will gorge flesh and honour of your daughters,
You will behold my face by your close friend,
That hides fire behind his back
Ritual, executing on your altar,
Betraying you in honour of my evil,
Setting on fire your false world,
Father of slaves-sons

Poor black blood on yourself,
Guzzle down it to a limit,
Wash your pure souls,
For the sake of me and in honour of my evil

Your executioner is named by you 666,
Shout my name louder in the Nyx,
In order your father hear it clearly
From servant to foe, severely!

And you will understand shine of jewels,
That glitter contemptibly from mournful fires,
Where your bodies burn down slowly,
Shouting my name each time stronger

Your tribe has skinned you,
Dressing in a tissue from rotten good
Owners of lies, sacred hypocrites,
Cover your bodies by white shrouds,
Unsight your eyes and lead to profound!

Your executioner is named by you 666,
Shout my name louder in the Nyx,
In order your father hear it clearly
From servant to foe, severely!

Where they sprinkle the earth with boiling fat,
Blackening heavens with smoke dense,
Singing prayers that muffle your desperate shout,
Shutting eyes to my riots.
