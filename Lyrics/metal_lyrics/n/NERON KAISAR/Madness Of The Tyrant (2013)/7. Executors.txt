Non licet esse christianos!!!

We are warriors of light, darker than the soot and tars!
And weâre dressed in your blood and your screams,
Bloodâs everywhere â on your flesh and your eyes,
Without remorse we devour your dreams!
Weapon of murder will not take it long,
The torment will force you to think about God,
And the fear shall lacerate vessels!!!

Odium humani generis!!!
Odium humani generis!!!

In the name of Jupiter and Emperor (that gave us lives), we go to war!
We take away your souls with firm step of the boar!
We weave the loricae of skin, anoint it by hot pitch!
You came to take away our minds, and with Talmud to teach,
But die with your lewd faith!
For you we are the heresy and dust and dirt,
So choke on our steel, for it you shall be burned!

Nero â dominus et deus!!!
Dominus et deus â nero!!!

Weâre born in the name of your death and not let the cry of the beast!
Nox came â we go to fight with our swords and shields!
Your burning corpses will hang along the bloodstained streets!
Now is the time of suffering, the fire and death-cries!
Die one by one, thereâs no way back, the viles...
Soldiers swarm the streets â your ears hear: - "Die!"

Fight will last until thereâs mortal with the faith!
Day by day weâre growing stronger by order of the great,
But the flesh is torn like a wetted thread,
Under weight of anger our souls are red,
Drown in the blood of the rotten dead!

The earth will quake in fear and the fire will inflame
When weâll tear their bowels in the Neroâs name!

The Sol goes down, but we cannot sleep!
Preparing a trap, unleashing the beasts
We chop, tear and burn, we fatten the field
By ashes of odious vulgus, we wield!
Fulfilling the will of our Caesar weâll live
Forever! But you are the weak and the thieves
Hiding behind your fiction thatâs blight
Weâll bay ye to Theatre for the delight â
The bread and circuses we shall provide!
