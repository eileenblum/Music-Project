Atheos anarchas
No belief in any deity
No lies or false idols
No dogma shall enslave me

My words of truth
The tongue of fire
A cleansing of utter blasphemy
No law of man or god
No chains of servitude
Bind me to the unjust

Purify me in flames
I have no fear of retribution
Before no graven images
Shall I bend in acquiescence
Say not unto me
Thou shall not

The head of Ramses
Lies fallen to the ground
Broken-crumbled-destroyed
Left in ruins
Godless!
