Nafs I Ammara
Fana Azif
I am the Infidel
Fiendish Insects encircle Me
Howling Winds Wraiths
Surrounding me disembodied Ka
Dulcarnon
Hideous Unseen
Speaking in Tongues
Heard only by the Mad
Shrieking Insects Swarm over Me
Suffocate Me 
Suffocate my Soul
Majun I am Empty
Crawling Reptiles Devour my Soul
They utterly and completely Annihilate Me
I can hear the Howling of the Jinn
Echoing in the mountains of Kaf
