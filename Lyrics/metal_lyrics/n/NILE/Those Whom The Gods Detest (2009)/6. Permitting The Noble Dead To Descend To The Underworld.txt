Hail to ye who art in the sacred desert of the west
I know you and I know your names
Save me from these snakes which are in Rosetjau
Which live on the flesh of men and gulp down their blood
For I know you and I know your names

The first one Osiris   lord of all mysterious of body
Gives command
He puts forth breath into those frightened ones
Who art in the midst of the west
What has been decreed for me is lordship over those who exist

I know you and I know your names

May my place in the darkness be opened for me
May a spirit shape be given to me in Rosetjau
Even to the lord of the gloom
Who dies at the devourer of serpents
His voice is heard but he is unseen

The great god within Busiris
Those amongst the languid ones fear him
Having gone forth unto the shambles of the god

I have gone forth
Even I the vindicated Osiris
The great ones on earth await me
The scribes on their mats magnify me
I am as Re the eldest of the gods
I have taken possession of the sky
I have inherited the earth
Who shall take away the sky and earth from me

I know you and I know your names
I know you and I know your names
