Iskander D'hul Karnon
Idolator pagan
Possessor of the horns of Ammon
Conqueror of both the rising and setting of the sun

A the ends of the earth
Where the sun rises from the treacherous fetid sea
Iskander built the gates
With blocks of stone and iron
Poured over with molten lead
Enclosing the nations of Gog and Magog

Iskander is Alexander
Son of Philip
The prophet himself had knowledge of him
Revealed in the cave at Mecca
They who deny him deceive themselves
They speak naught but lies

Dreadful is Muhammad's warning
Surely Hell awaits the unbelievers

On the day of judgments
At the end of time
The earth shall quake
And the gate which Iskander built will be torn open

The hosts of Gog and Magog
Hordes of the fiercest of creatures shall be unchained
And allowed to go forth and ravage the earth

At the hour of doom when the moon is buried in darkness
Evil will rain down upon the wicked
Hell will be unleashed upon the disbelievers
And all the earth shall be laid to waste
