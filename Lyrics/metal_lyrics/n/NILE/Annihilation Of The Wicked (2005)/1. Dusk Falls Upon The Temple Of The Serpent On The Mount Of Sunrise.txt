[Instrumental]

[This instrumental spawned from some experimental Midi Guitar emulations that resulted from me trying to "catch the vibe" and nick some common Greek Bouzouki phrases for my amusement. Of course, I could not leave well enough alone, and had to go mucking about in search of some cool, dark ambience to compliment it.

What I stumbled upon was just the right evil, "dying flames of sunset" aura to set the piece off and give it tangible atmospheric context. After I finished this piece, and listened to it, it just sounded like an album intro. It definitely was not part of "Cast Down the Heretic", thus, it needed a name of its own. The title is a metaphor for the eventual demise of the entire Egyptian civilization.]
