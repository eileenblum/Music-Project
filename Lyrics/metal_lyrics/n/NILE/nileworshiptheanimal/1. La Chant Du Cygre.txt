Forgotten heroes, massacred
Carnage scattered
Strewn with the wreckage of war
Sanguinary, savage melee
Slay en masse, orgiastic bloodbath

No more battle cries of screams of dying friends
No mourners lament or glorious funeral pyres
The dogs of war will gnaw my bones

Carcass remains, gangrenous rotting
Vultures descend, gorging on carrion
Gnashing teeth, slavering jaws
