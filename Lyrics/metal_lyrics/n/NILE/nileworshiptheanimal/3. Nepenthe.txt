Drink the milk of Ceres
Dread elixir
Crude nauseous, willful poison
Healing wounds unhealed
Purge, vomit, convulse, collapse
I gain the knowledge
Separate mind from body
I break open the skull

Papaver somniferum
Amrosia of the ancients
Morpheus, God of dreams grants me
entrance to the den of the wicked
Anarchy of dreaming sleep summons
long dead harlots
I kiss the queen of hell
Cleansed from the dishonors of the grave

Potent destroyer of grief
Abyss of divine enslavement
Thou hast the key to paradise
Nepenthe

Every night I descend into chasms
and sunless abysses, depths below depths
from which I am hopeless to reascend
