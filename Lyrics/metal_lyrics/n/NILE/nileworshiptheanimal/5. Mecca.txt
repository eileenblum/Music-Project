Oasis, dark sanctuary. 
Night is born, heavy with passion. 
Shaman dance by the light of the Moon. 
Open your eyes to the song of the universe. 

Slowly we drag ourselves out of the primal slime. 
Slowly we arise to become mankind. 
Irrepressable we journey to Mecca. 

The heavens, the gods are all within you. 
Listen as the voice of reason speaks. 
The ranting and raving will tear the world apart. 

Ancient, alive, seething with power. 
Enigma of a single human heart. 
Monumental, neolithic. 
Bare your soul and enter Mecca. 

Come, arise from the primordial mud. 
Cloak thy nakedness. 
In the endless stuggle of the ages, 
give your spirit wings and fly.
Fly.
Fly.
Fly.
Come and fly.
