Descendant world in a frenzy of evil,
slowly stripped of life
Raped of principles with a common reason
Justice for which we fight
Madmen stagger into power,
pulling strings from ivory towers
Vampire machines drain and devour,
as screams strike the hour

Do you ever feel frightened in the dead of night
Can you hear the children scream
Lurking witches coming for you
every night and every day, some good, some evil
but they all know where you are
Only thing to do is run away
or stay and be surrounded by fright

Innocent provoked, guilty set free
I don't know which way to go
What will they think of me when I lose control
Nightmare, reality, or am I just in hell
I think I'm on a one way ticket to being totally
surrounded by fright

Invisible parasite worming away at the brain,
driving me insane, do this, do that
You live then you die, burn me at the stake
We are the martyrs of tomorrow and today
Rise up from the fire and cry
surrounded by fright
