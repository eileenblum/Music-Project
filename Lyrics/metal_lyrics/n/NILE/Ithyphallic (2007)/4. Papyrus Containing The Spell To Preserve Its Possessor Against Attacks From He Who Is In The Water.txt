Amun
Lord of the gods
Thou who art of the four rams heads upon thy neck
Thou standest upon the spine of the crocodile fiends
To thine sides are the dog headed apes
The transformed spirits of the dawn

Drive away from me the lions of the wastes
The crocodiles which come forth from the river
The bite of poisonous reptiles
Which crawl forth from their holes

Be driven back crocodile thou spawn of set
Move not by means of thy tail
Work not thy feet and legs
Open not thy mouth
Let the water which is before thee
Turn into a consuming fire

I possess the spell to
Preserve me from he who is in the water

Thou whom the thirty seven gods didst make
And whom the serpent of Ra didst put in chains
Thou who wast fettered with links of iron
In the presence of Ra
Be driven back thou spawn of set

Drive away from me the lions of the wastes
The crocodiles which come forth from the river
The bite of poisonous reptiles
Which crawl forth from their holes
The command to release the seals that bind his tomb
