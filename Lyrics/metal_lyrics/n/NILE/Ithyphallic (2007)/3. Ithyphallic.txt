As for mine enemies
The sun shall impede the beating of their hearts
And blind their eyes

Let the shades of my fathers
Curse their faces
Let the eye of sekhmet
Send the violence of the sun
Down upon their heads
Let searing torrents of fire
Descend upon their brow
Let flames immolate their places of sleeping

Let the eye of sekhmet
Cause their hearts to burst into flames
Let carnivorous dogs consume their entrails

As for mine enemies
Let their charred ashes
Be as discarded refuse
Lying forgotten in the desert
Let their shades not rise again

Let my curses be heard
Let my will be as menthu the bull
Potent to create
And savage to slay those whom I hath cursed
Let my wrath be terrible
And my vengeance unmerciful

Anoint my phallus with the blood of the fallen
