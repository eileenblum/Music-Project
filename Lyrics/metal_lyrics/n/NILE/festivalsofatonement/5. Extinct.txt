Whisper silence in my Ear
Uncover the truth of Insignificance
Paint the anguish of the Private Soul
Reveal pathetic Tragedy

As sleep I dream of Death

Seething with Rage
Exquisite Rage
Amplify the Vision

Does it Matter
Does it Matter

Paradise Lost
Dreaming of Extinction
We wander through the Walls of Sacrifice
Sick winds brush against my Skin

Power of Extinction
Growth Intelligence No More
Mud Rot Skeletal Earth
Drown thy spirit of Kings

Society's walls break Down
Humans Pound Down
Dig I must dig Out
Surviving puts all tools in Place
Only peace comes in Death

As I sleep I dream of Death
Only Peace comes in Death
