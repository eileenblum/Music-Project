Rise in Slpender
Arms upheld unto the Sky
Blindly I Follow
Soon All will be Revealed

Searing Transcendant
Visions of Divine Intent
Worshiping Obediant
I Await the Burning

In Supplication
I turn my eyes toward the Sun
It Burns

I turn my eyes toward the Sun
Its Flames
Oh God it Burns
Refusing to look Away
In Agony
I become Divine

Obeisance I Make
Engulfed in Radiant Fury
Amon-Ra
The Hidden One
Takes my sight that I might See

Blinded I cry Out
In Gratitude
Tears Streaming
I Return unto the Sands

Burnt Charred
I behold no God

I Become Divine
