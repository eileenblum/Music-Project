I am a Long Lived Snake, I Pass the Night and Am Reborn Every Day
I am the Snale which is in the Limits of the Earth
I Pass the Night and am Reborn, Renewed and Rejuvenated Every Day
I am a Crocodile immersed in Dread
I am the Crocodile who Takes by Robbery
I am the Great and Mighty Loathsome Reptile
Who is in the Bitter Waters
I am the Lord of those who Bow Down in Sekhem
