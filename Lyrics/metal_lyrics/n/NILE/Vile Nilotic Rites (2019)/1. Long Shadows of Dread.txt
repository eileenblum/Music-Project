The world grows dark
Dusk turns ominous
Penance for evil days long upon us
Unforetold dread is on the horizon
Warning us of impending doom

The world is become a despairing desert
The sands of time run short
The foundations of the black earth move beneath our feet
Unnameable fear lurks ever nearer

The shadows lengthen
The shadows lurk...

The order of the cosmos is undone
The waters of chaos rise
All that we are is soon to die
Of the black Earth, only ruins shall remain
A desolate remembrance casting long shadows across untold centuries
