An hour of great contempt is upon us
The hour in which even our own lives
Haveâbecomeâabhorrent unto us

Theâgods we yet worship
Long since dead
Mockâour servile existence


Our future is meaningless
Poverty uncleanness
And despicable apathy

Where is the wrath
Where is the retribution

Our inglorious doom
Inexorable irrevocable
Shameful and mired in filth

Syzygy

Where is the lightning
To strike down our wickedness
Where is the frenzy
To release us from the hopelessness
With which we are infected

Where is the wrathful sky
That will end our suffering
