One of many
Swarming writhing entwined
Sinuous coiled mass
Agitated in the heat of mating frenzy

Turning, twisting, churningâseaâof reptilian flesh
Writhing,âsliding, forked tongues darting
Entangled in chaos

Turmoilâfever, restless fasting
Churning urging
Primal need to procreate

Knots of confusion

Surging, weaving, hissing, slithering
Coiling, winding, encircling, undulating

Exhaustive competition to mate
Consumed by the will to copulate

Seething, writhing

I am one of many
Seething, teeming, crawling
Swarming, writhing serpents
Snake pit mating frenzy

Knots of confusion

Turning, twisting, churning sea of reptilian flesh
Writhing, sliding, forked tongues darting
Entangled in chaos
Churning, urging
Primal need to procreate

I am one of many
Who must copulate
