Waxen one who feedeth by stealth
Coiled one who cioeth on the Inert Ones
I will not be Inert for thee
I will not become infirm for thee

Thy poison shall not enter into my members
For my body is as the Body of Atum
I I am not weak
Suffering from thee shall not enter
Into these cimbs of mine

I am Atum
At the head of the Primordial Waters
My protection is from the Gods
Who art the cords of eternity
I am he whose name is secret
More Holy of Throne than the Chaos Gods
I have gone forth with Atum
I am he who is not examined
I am hale, I am hale

Burn in flames thou creature of Wax
Coiled fiend who leadest away dictims and destroyeth them
Thou who prey upon the weak and the helpless
May I never become helpless

Thy poison shall never enter my corpse
For my bones are as the bones of the God Tem
Since he dost not suffer collapse
I shall not suffer collapse

Let not the pains of death
Eat into my remains
I am the God Tem at the Mouth of the Abyss
I am he whose name is hidden
Whose sanctuary is holy for millions of years
I came forth with the God Tem
I am he who shall not be condemned
