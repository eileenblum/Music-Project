Speak not of the gods to me
They listen not to the suffering
Speak not to me of divine mercy
When my eyes see only pestilence

Famine and death

Speak not to me of the profane
When the truth of our existence
Is called blasphemy
And the smoke of plague ridden human carcasses
Blackens the horizon

Speak no more of wandering unclean spirits
Lest they be called by the sound of their names
Speak not of forsaking the elder ones
I must now seek instead their unholy embrace

Speak instead the chants of protection
Against the coming of endless swarms of devouring fiends
Against the dreaded black clouds of churning hatred
Against the malevolence which descends from the sky

Against countless voracious messengers of retribution
Swarming the innocent, and the wicked
Lest he who is lord of the demons of the wind
Of the evil spirits which infest the air
Who layeth hold even unto death

Covereth thee with legions
Of winged terrors
Evil to protect thee from evil
Evil to Cast Out Evil [2x]

Evil to protect thee from evil
Evil to Cast Out Evil [2x]

Speak not of the gods unto me
The hear not the screams
Of the dying
Evil to protect thee from evil
Evil to Cast Out Evil
Evil to protect thee from evil
Speak not unto me
Of the sins of mankind
When my eyes see only the evil of the gods

Evil to protect thee from evil
Evil to Cast Out Evil [2x]
