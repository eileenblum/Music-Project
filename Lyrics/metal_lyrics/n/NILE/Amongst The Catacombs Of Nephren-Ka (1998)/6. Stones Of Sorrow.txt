Slaves Whipped to Death
In the Hot Sun
Drag the Stones of Sorrow

Vast Monolithic a Collossus of Stone
Greased with the Blood of Abraham

Of Human Bondage
and Suffering
We carve a monument to Megalomania

Bleak and Endless is my Sorrow
For the chain of Sut
Is around my Neck

Aperu Heseb Semedet!
It is I who lift up the arm of the Inert
I have gone out of Khemenu
and am no longer a living soul
I have been initiated into the hearts of the Baboons
And I claim Dominion over the legions
of Uninscribed Shabitiu
Khunumu Khufu!
The God Khnum is my Protector

Ushabti
Tekenu
Ushabti
