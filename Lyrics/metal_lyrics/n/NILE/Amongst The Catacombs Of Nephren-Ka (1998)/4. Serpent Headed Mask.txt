Aa-herit Nebu Huit-Ra
We come before Thee wearing serpent headed Masks
In sanguinary worship we offer the Tcheser-t Senfiu
The sacrificial drink of the Gods of Blood
in a goblet carved from a human skull

Aa-t-aru
Fiendish blood drinking reptile Lord of the Ankhit-Thekh
rites of bloodfeast
We propitiate Thee with our own fluid of life
and the freely offered flesh of these ritual prostitutes
that Thou mayest copulate with thine self
and spill Thy seed upon the Black Earth

Aui-f-em-kha-nef Netri nek khefa
We don the Abui ames Machta the ceremonial two horned phallus
to become as like unto the two horned serpent god Sekhui
We besmear ourselves with the bloodseed of
the living serpent goddess Arati
And with curved blades
shed our skin
