Nafs I Ammara
Fana Azif
I am the Infidel

Fiendish Insects encircle Me
Howling Wind Wraiths
Surround my disembodied Ka

Dulcarnon
Hideous Unseen
Speaking in Tongues
Heard only by the Mad

Shrieking Insects Swarm over Me
Suffocate Me
Suffocate my Soul

Majnun I am Empty
Crawling Reptiles Devour my Soul
They utterly and completely Annihilate Me
I can hear the Howling of the Djinn
Echoing in the mountains of Kaf
