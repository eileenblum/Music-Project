The great one has fallen on his side
Swarmed by the eight crocodiles
I know them by their names and lives
I save my father from them

Crocodiles of the west
Who live on the unwearying stars
Detestation of you is in me
The Nau snake is in my belly
Your flame will not be upon me

Crocodiles of the east
Who live on mutilation
Detestation of you is in me
The Nau snake is in my bowels
Your flame will not be upon me

Crocodiles of the south
Living on feces
Smoke and want
Detestation of you is in me
My blood is not in your hand

I will erase you
I will erase you

Crocodiles of the north
Living on the waste between the stars
Detestation of you is in me
Your poison is in my head
A scorpion writhes within me

I'm glad with the magick of Re
What exists is within my grasp
I'm heard in the house of the great one
Who destroys the living

I am Re
Who protects himself
Nothing can harm me

I am Re
Who protects himself
Nothing can harm me

I am Re
