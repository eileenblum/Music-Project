Tonight the city is filled with a hollow song
Its echoes fill my yearning soul
With bitter mourning
Cold and lonely
I'm on my knees again

What's new?
Welcome home

Tonight the city is filled with a hollow song
See the people walking slowly
Silent and afraid
The city is filled with hordes of faces
All the same empty eyes

Staring right through me
Into my heart, into my soul
But there's nothing to see
Nothing at all

Feel the autumn's breath on your face when the seasons shift
But it's always winter in my heart
Feel the autumn's breath on your face when the seasons shift
But it's always winter in my heart

Feel the autumn's breath on your face when the seasons shift
But it's always winter in my heart
Feel the autumn's breath on your face when the seasons shift
But it's always winter in my heart

Tonight the city is filled with a hollow song
Its echoes fill my yearning soul
