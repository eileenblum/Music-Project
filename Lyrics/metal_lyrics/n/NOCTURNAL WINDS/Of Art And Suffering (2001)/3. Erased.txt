The existence set a gun to its temple
And waited for someone to pull the trigger
Tired shivering flame yearns away from the path
This is nowhere leading and from emptiness deriving

To my observant eyes no objects can be seen
Just forms and thoughts fading, all senses escaping
And they're not leaving, just disappearing
Logic twists into a dream, reasons become irrelevant

When the curtains are drawn
It will all be gone
In no place at all
In no time to recall

When the curtains are drawn
It will all be gone
In no place at all
In no time to recall

Where the sky is cruel and cold
Where shelter no one offers, where all flames stifle
I'll be watching as in one slow motioned moment
The history erases itself
