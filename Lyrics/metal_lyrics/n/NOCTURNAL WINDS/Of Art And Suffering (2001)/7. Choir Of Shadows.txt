In the darkest light performs
The enchanting choir of shadows
Bleeding its madness into me
Leaving me fragments of things that never were whole

Just broken glass, a masqerade from the past
I heard the door and a figure came from the corridor
Shapeless it was as told but Its tar black blood was gone
I heard it got torn apart

It settled by my table and leaned on Its scythe
Which It still carried along though
It had gone blunt and rusted through
I listed to the weary sound of Its breath
And together we watched the choir of shadows play
All the way to the very last encore

Until even the darkest light had gone
And in the end there were no applause
Only dust covered the empty hall
And a sole harmonized, hollow heart

In the darkest light performs
The enchanting choir of shadows
Bleeding its madness into me
Leaving me fragments of things that never were whole

Just broken glass, a masqerade from the past
I heard the door and a figure came from the corridor
Shapeless it was as told but Its tar black blood was gone
I heard it got torn apart

Until even the darkest light had gone
And in the end there were no applause
Only dust covered the empty hall
And a sole harmonized, hollow heart
