Is it always dark or am I just blind to light?
Is it always cold or has my circulation stalled?
My eyes are mere the eyes of a man
My soul is cursed, my kind I've damned
My chains are mere the chains of a mind
My world subconscious expulsion of light
I barely hear the silent wings
Sometimes even darkness dims

I never moved still I lost where I began
Swift horse went by with the world on its back
On sailed the longships captained by time
I kept my share of darkness, the mere darkness of man

I barely hear the silent wings
Sometimes even darkness dims

Is it always dark or am I just blind to light?
Is it always cold or has my circulation stalled?
My eyes are mere the eyes of a man
My soul is cursed, my kind I've damned
My chains are mere the chains of a mind
My world subconscious expulsion of light
I barely hear the silent wings
Sometimes even darkness dims
