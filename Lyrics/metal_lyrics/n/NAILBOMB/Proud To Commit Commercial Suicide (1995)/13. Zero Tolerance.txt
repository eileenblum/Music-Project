So you think you're the chosen one
So you think you're the master race ?!
Racist violence
Ain't anarchy

Are you trying to destroy
Anyone who's not like you
But in the perfect world
You'll be the first to go

Your leader is dead and gone
He, the one who never won
Go back and trace your history
You're no different than your enemy

You talk about pride
Then why do you need the hide ?
Behind a mask, you never question
Your blind obsession

Zero tolerance

You say you're going to kill the Jews
Asians, Latinos and blacks
Racially different
Equally ignorant

Why don't you re-think
It's happened before, now it's happening again
We've come to the point of...
Zero tolerance
