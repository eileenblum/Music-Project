Trapped on the inside, you stare in
Who the fuck are you to tell us anything
Rotting right through pison inside
31 flavours of napalm to try

Fuck you and your plans
I live my life my way
Vai toma no cÃ£
You scumbag, you waste

Tired of your ways, hate rising again
I know you'd life to see me put a bullet in my brain
I'm not gonna be part of your plan
Fuck your solutions cause nothing gets changed
