It would be the best
Everyone could go to hell
Turn into yourself
Always someone else

Don't need sympathy
Smile is nothing but teeth
I'll keep my integrity
Even if I have to sleep on the street

Look around what are you doing
You think God's inside you
Telling people what to do
You don't know who are you

Don't need sympathy
Smile it's nothing but teeth
