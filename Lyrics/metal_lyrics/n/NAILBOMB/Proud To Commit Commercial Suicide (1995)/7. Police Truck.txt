[Dead Kennedys cover written by Biafra/Ray]

Tonight's the night that we got the truck 
We're goin' downtown gonna beat up drunks 
Your turn to drive I'll bring the beer 
It's the late late shift to one to fear 
And ride, ride how we ride 
We ride, lowride 
It's roundup time where the good whores meet 
Gonna drag one screaming off the street 
And ride, ride how we ride 
Got a black uniform and a silver badge 
Playin' cops for real, playin' cops for pay 
Let's ride, lowride 
Pull down your dress here's a kick in the ass 
Let's beat you blue 'til you shit in your pants 
Don't move, child gotta big black stick 
There's six of us, babe so suck on my dick 
And ride, ride how we ride 
Let's ride, lowride 
The left newspapers migth whine a bit 
But the guys at the station they don't give a shit 
Dispatch calls 'Are you doin' something wicked?' 
'No siree, Jack, we're just givin' tickets' 
As we ride, ride how we ride 
Let's ride, lowride
