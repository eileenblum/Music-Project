Time and again
We've been told
Still it's ignored
Who'll go first

For fuck's sake / leave me alone
Live your life / I'll live mine

The winning doesn't count
Just don't take part
Close your eyes
Stuff your face

Don't tell me what to do
We live in different worlds
Suffer and pain
Has built my brain
Never understand
Won't see it your way
I don't have to be
Like anyone else
I can't waste my time
Trying to destroy you
I can't waste my time
I'll just to avoid you
You always envy
What you don't have
All your hate
Don't put me down
Life goes on
