When the screens says it's too late
No ones to blame but yourself
I want to buy everything you've got
No hope now for the T.V. junk

24 hour bullshit

I want out don't want your help
Spend my time trying to distance myself
Fall in line now follow suit
It's my god and my religion

Beer gun car &amp; T.V.
That's all I need
I want to buy everything you've got
I could care less
