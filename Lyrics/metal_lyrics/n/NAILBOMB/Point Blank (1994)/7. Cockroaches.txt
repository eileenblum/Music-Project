It would be the best
Everyone could go to hell
Turn into yourslf
Always someone else

Don't need sympathy
Smile it's nothing but teeth
I'll keep my integrity
Even if I have to sleep on the street

Look around what are you doing
You think god's inside you
Telling people what to do
You don't know who are you

[Repeat VI]

Don't need sympathy
Smile it's nothing but teeth
