A dark room is my world
Life no longer turns me on
Forget my friends
That already forgot me
The needle is a bullet in my head

The needle in
The brain out
Don't know what I'm doing

Love me, hate me, cos I hate myself

Fuck, love me, dig me
'Cause I hate myself

Fucked up looks good, feels good
Happy with yourself
Now you got no attention

Don't take part, demanding more
You're predictable and fucking boring
Two faces one for me
And one for you, happy?

Same mistakes over and over
Getting away with it
I can't get over that
Getting away with it

A dark room is my world
Life no longer turns me on
Forget my friends
That already forgot me

Fuck, love me, dig me
'Cause I hate myself
'Cause I hate myself
'Cause I hate myself
'Cause I hate myself
'Cause I hate myself
