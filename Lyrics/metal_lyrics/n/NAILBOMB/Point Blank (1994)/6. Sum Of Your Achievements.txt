Children burning, crawling, dying
Knowledge and science used like toys
Splitting neutrons we made us a bomb
No advances, just death of man

Sum of your achievements

Sum of your achievements
You call this something to be proud of?

Achieve destruction, obliteration
How the west has won
Going further back to discover new arms
Science is working to destroy us all

Sum of your achievements

You call this something to be proud of?
