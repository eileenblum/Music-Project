So blind if you pray
Lost another day
Get off your knees
Do something for yourself

It'll teach you nothing
About the world today
Take the belief and throw it away

Throw it away
Throw it away / destroy it all
Throw it away

The church and all it's glory
Is draining all your money
No gods, no masters
Religious cancer

Throw it away
Throw it away / destroy it all
Throw it away

No
Gods
No
Masters
Religious
Cancer
