evil against evil
here I stand
far from the mind of the weak and the life of devotion
where all is a straight line
new nation is approaching in distance and time
higher mind will prevail with its might and disregard
my aversion leads to minority
hate brings destruction
now all is a distant fear
they will never ask if the truth is utility or harm
questions which are bringing fear are never heard on our ground
they can't understand
become aware of selfishness
much more indifference is needed
my aversion leads to minority
hate brings destruction
now all is a distant fear
evil against evil
eternal blindness dominates our world
negative emotions are crushing our minds
absence of humanity remains in their hands
expose your religion and presence of god
let me be your guide
let me be your leader
evil against evil
