slowly enter to mind control
passing like a sharp blade
swings by each passing
it grows stronger as it rolls before the eyes
unbidden anger grimaces appear so devoid
what can you tell me fill me with more pieces of corruption
you dare to step on my way
what the hell is your expectation
now I feel the chains are shattered the ones that weightened me down
can't you see and understand that all becomes more intense
slowly to corrode enough of mind control
so devoid fill me
