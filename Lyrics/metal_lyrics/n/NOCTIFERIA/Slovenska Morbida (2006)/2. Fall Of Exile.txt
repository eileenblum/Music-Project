where is this going?
how does it end?
the actual end of life where is this going?
how does it end?
or is it just a beginning of the end take the first step close to me head my voice and you will see pay attention and realize that you are living in your own lies down downfall fall of exile I am the new face full of disregard hate and selfishness the rest is useless I am that face full of vanity take a good look and fear me...
fear me...
hate me...
I want to know what I feel and then I see what is real
