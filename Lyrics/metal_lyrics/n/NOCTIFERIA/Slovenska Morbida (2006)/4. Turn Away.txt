I turn away
I am the project which lives subjectively
and before there was nothing else here
an object cannot become somebody
if it never were something
everything that counts is a will for might
and all that lasts is our freedom to create somebody
means same as to cause something to exist
I am my future
I am my time to come and go
I am a state of being guilty
I am my freedom
I turn away
I turn away
laughing progress is just a wrong placed idea
we were so fuckin' spoiled and failed
we talk and breathe as others do
but we never know who the others are
I am my future
I am my time to come and go
I am a state of being guilty
I am my freedom
the law of evolution is the law of selection
the perfect one's always promote
but we are still remaining cowards
we feel the differences
and being ourselves we operate without wishes and hope
I cannot see anything else except the failures and weaknesses
there is no external of absolute truth
