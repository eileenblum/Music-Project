project
an image of a hightower
standing just one of many backgrounds
fills with blast flash
weak winds blow through grey buildings
now entangled in the net of paths with blurred ends
there is a calm before the bang
ground shall shiver
disorder to deliver
towers shall fall
no means at all
towers shall fall...

no with fake foundation of lies
can never reach the skies
all ruins shall remain as nonsacred
image of pain
there is a calm before the bang
ground shall shiver
disorder to deliver
towers shall fall
no means at all
towers shall fall...
no
