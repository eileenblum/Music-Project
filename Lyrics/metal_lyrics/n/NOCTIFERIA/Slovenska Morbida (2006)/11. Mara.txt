back again the equalizer of great,
rich and poor always the same end
and the new beginning pointless
it seems so empty and plain
see as they all see all the way always the same end
and the new beginning
so one day reaches the source
so one day the ultimate goal
she is the gate way back and back again
she is the gate on and on how fortunate
can man be the purifies,
seeks and with wisdom follows
so one day reaches the source
the ultimate goal
pain is inevitable
suffering is optional
she is the gate back again
she is the gate on and on
she is the gate way back and back again
she is the gate on and on
