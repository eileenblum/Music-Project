I play a variety of roles which are slipping through my tired fingers
I am out of play
every trial hits another nerve
every character has a pointless point
my function was never accepted or it wasn't expected to have spirits
that dictate integrity feeling which provoke insanity
now I am sick of taking part of another fictitious sample
I am out of play spirits
that dictate integrity feelings which provoke insanity
empty soulless screen
I am fear machine
I am the last act created and failed
I am out of play
