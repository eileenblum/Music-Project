Your open your eyes
You are the product
Fallen into denial
With utopias
Of death culture

They keep you scared
So you think you need them
Feeding your life
And then take your freedom

We will follow someone you trust
Someone you like
Someone who supports you
We'll followâ¦

Deluders create followers
Create deludersâ¦

Clones of shadow government
Repetition from deluders mouth
Brainwashed, used dehumanized, abused
Still following, obedient crowd

No qualms
Just lying to your face
Over and over, over again
For anybody who might hear
Lies go straight into the veins

Deluders create followers
Create deluders
