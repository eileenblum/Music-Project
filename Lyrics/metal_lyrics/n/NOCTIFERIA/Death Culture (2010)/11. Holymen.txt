Demonic face yet holy grace
Repellent smiles dead and vile
So wicked minds behind the walls
Squeeze life as they rise

Power possession
Control obsession
Corrupt somber in the heart
Soulless or dead inside

Idols out of demons
Children into slaves
Careless men ignore it all
As pitch dark cloak the Earth

Verbal diahorrea
Hypnotic words
Repeating mantras on and on

No more

Ordinary becomes extraordinary
Rise above
Empty lives
On the contrary life is just temporary
Rise above
Holy lies

"One gods nation in the name of fake liberation
Can seal the fate of world"

Ordinary becomes extraordinary
Rise above
Empty lives
On the contrary life is just illusion
Rise above
Holy lies

Salvation

Demonic force of atomic age
The anointed ones of golden age
A new day will dawn
Eventually they'll all fall

Traumatized its no surprise
Hidden hands make us dance
New ego bursts when truth is told
That few controls all

Ordinary becomes extraordinary
Rise above
Empty lives
On the contrary life is just temporary
Rise above
Holy lies

"They must find it difficult?
Those who have taken authority as the truth
Rather than truth as the authority?"

They are - trying - so hard to - make us fall

Bring em down - Bring em down
Bring em down - your holy men

Ordinary becomes extraordinary
Rise above
Empty lives
On the contrary life is just illusion
Rise above
Holy lies

Lies!
Lies!
No more!
