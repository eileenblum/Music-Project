Always more but never enough
They take all and give to none
Irrational force of sickened mind
No need just greed and intolerance

Building ten when needing one
Taking all and sharing none
Prophets kings hand in hand
Raise ten more on their demand

New age slaves manufacture
Machines of men for concrete future
Death is profit gold seduction
Another day another torture

Slavedriver

The world will stop as monolith
As beautiful blue necropolis
No more life for thirsty eyes
Cash is drug like shit to flies
Dust to dust
Is our fate
Controlling this world
New age slaves

Slavedriver

New age slaves manufacture
Machines of men for concrete future
Death is profit gold seduction
Another day another torture

New age slaves manufacture
Machines of men for concrete future
Death is profit gold seduction
Another day new born vulture

New born vulture
Slavedriver
New born vulture
Another day
Another torture
New born vulture
Slavedriver
