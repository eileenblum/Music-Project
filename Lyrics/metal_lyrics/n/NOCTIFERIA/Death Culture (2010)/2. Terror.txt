Cross terror
Open eyes and see them
Ropes choking the freedom
Patterns in fractions
Break the chain reaction
All that last beyond us
Works of age
Down the drain
What a shame
Big mistake
Waste of time
Mankind fails
Ant it's erased

Our existence need some kind of assistance
Not persistence of idiotic acts of sub-consciousness

Now the terror ends

Christ terror
No profanity
Pure insanity
Nearly divine
Arise of iniquity
Parasites of the earth
We're the cancer the dirt
Here only to achieve
Termination and grieve
No escape in any shape
From suffering of the man
Euthanasia campaign

Our existence need some kind of assistance
Not persistence of idiotic acts of sub-consciousness

Now terror â¦ ends

An eye for an eye
And the world is blind

Our existence need some kind of assistance
Not persistence of idiotic acts of sub-consciousness
