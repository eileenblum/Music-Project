As you sow so shall your reap
Guided by yearnings and daydreams
Fools you have all become
Now learn to walk before you run

Oblivious of excess
Suppressing in progress
Possessing the sense
For social confidence
Taking control
The total obedience
Content with blindness
You made me immense

Societies
They need a leader
Someone to trust
Another one to feed them
Obsess
Social surpass
Ideology to bend at my will
Be my flesh
Be my working hands
Statues
Your lives irrelevant
Falling apart to pieces
Wonder will never cease

All that glitter is not gold
A rising tide lifts every boat
The facts you all could learn by now
But you choose to disavow

I am hope for nation
Your father redemption
The one for whom you pray
Hear the words I say:
Panem et circenses
Pleasing all your sense
Monarch anarch I am
Feeble minds shiver in shame

Serve

Exhale the words

Seething deep within
Inhale the demand
To breathe individually
Servants
Be no more
A stumble may prevent your fall

A man who makes himself a sheep
Will be guided with a whip
Of the million or two more or less
I rule and possess

I am the salvation
Your father
The one for whom you pray
Hear the words I say:
Panem et circenses
Pleasing all your sense
Monarch anarch I am
Feeble minds shiver in shame

Weakness deceives

Weakness deceives
Creates moronic believes
Blue blood falls apart
You make it what it is
Who's to blame
Your lives are lame
Big words frightened hordes
At the end it's all the same

Power depraves
Narrow horizons enslaves
You are mine on earth
Have no fear Jesus saves
Build my fame
Weak minds tyrant grinds
At the end you have no name

I am the salvation
Your father
The one for whom you pray
Hear the words I say:
Panem et circenses
Pleasing all your sense
Monarch anarch I am
Feeble minds shiver in shame
