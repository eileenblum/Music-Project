O great one the creator of life
The riddle of infinite for me to untie
Long was the path from beginning to the end
Now end seems nearer as I drift astray

Salvation procreates
As dust shell I become
Beast on the new level
Or vulture of new world
Endless are questions answers are none
But'll face the truth when my time is gone

Like a shining bits surrounding my mystic haze
In this wide spiral maze I'm going high
All the way up to the top above all on and on
I am may vortex my pleasure my way

Face creation of frivolity
Creation demise
Face temptation of high quality
Temptation in disguise

One more hit one step higher
Wider the horizon bigger the power

With consuming I create
My own world free of hate
It feels so damn great
The burning of my hate
