Be aware
Traps they throw our way
All the time is gone
We need to care
Let's change our voice
No more words but noise
Hearts are bleeding
Tongues are screaming

Be the one
The true
Yourself
Rebel

Will all of this lead to a global strike
The new century of another Reich

No regrets
No forgiveness
Guilt is ageless
Life so joyless

Confused by facts and attacks
Never surrender
Aware of failures
Feel rebellious
Stop the following
Be your king

Rise up from the ground
Terra Firma drowned
Leave the mark don't fade with masses
Manipulating words
For Manipulating minds
Don't fall for psyched up masses

Backs will bend no more
As they have before
Don't need the eyes
To fully realize
Let's change our voice
No more words but noise
Hearts are bleeding
Tongues are screaming

No regrets
No forgiveness
Guilt is ageless
Life so joyless

Confused by facts and attacks
Never surrender
Aware of failures
Feel rebellious
Stop the following
Be your king

Rise up from the ground
Terra Firma drowned
Leave the mark don't fade with masses
Manipulating words
For Manipulating minds
Don't fall for psyched up masses

Storming through images of life
We became what we are not

Rise up from the ground
Terra Firma drowned
Leave the mark don't fade with masses
Manipulating words
For Manipulating minds
Don't fall for psyched up masses
