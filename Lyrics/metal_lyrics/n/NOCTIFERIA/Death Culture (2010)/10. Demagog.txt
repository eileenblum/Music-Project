Twisting one word
And then the other
Making promise
With hypnotic laughter
Hysterical smiles of deluded ones
Cabalist from hell's lungs

Demagog the demigod
song of wealth and filthy mud
Demagog the dogmatic son
Soulless flesh deceiving tongues

To the left and to the right
His word is holy and his smile is bright
Words of Caesars acts of rats
Mass hysteria by his hands

What's the price for god's salvation?
How much money for liberation?
Is there any cost for living a lie?
Drop by drop until you die

Selling saints renting faith
Religion ultimately uncreates
One faith one mind all is numb
Demagog the refined scum

Demagog
Demigod
Demongod

Demagog the demigod
Song of wealth and filthy mud
Demagog the dogmatic son
Soulless flesh deceiving tongues

Demagog
Demigod
Demongod

What's the price for god's salvation?
How much money for liberation?
Is there any cost for living a lie?
Drop by drop until you die

Selling saints renting faith
Religion ultimately uncreates
One faith one mind all is numb
Demagog the refined scum
