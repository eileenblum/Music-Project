Sell yourself
For joy and hollow hope
Make sacrifice
Save your dreadful souls
Exhausted lives
Marching towards the fall
Empty old eyes
Of smashed down ones
So petrified
It makes your cold skin crawl
In silence
Where's your freedom call
It's time to march
To the beat of your own drum
In fury
Don't dwell for noble scums

Rust
Corrosion of life
To dust
Converting mankind

This is the architecture of a new destruction
So glamorous profound pure corruption
We're building the towers without foundations
How moronic is this goddamned nation

One step forward the two steps back
Slowly but surely we disintegrate
Collapsing bridges built to above
Compiling the tomb for a new world

Rust
Corrosion of life
To dust
Converting mankind

Zero ground zero mind
Idiot speaks and all is fine
Once a slave just once a slave come out
Run out of shades of gray

Rust
Corrosion of life
To dust
Converting mankind

Kneel to them not the crown of rust
Trust in them never again
Everything dies worthless are lives to
Rotting kings pulling the strings
