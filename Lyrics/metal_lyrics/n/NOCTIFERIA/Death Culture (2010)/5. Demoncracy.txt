"One bank, one army, one center of power.
Power corrupts. And absolute power corrupts absolutely."

Global genocide conspiracy
Dictating evil harmony
Profiting from death and demoncracy
Nations are bowed and obsolete to be

Born of ignorance
Raised intolerant
The beast is doomed
To crawl again

Creation eruption downfall destruction
Known is the path and blind destination
Moaning for heaven or at least a salvation
Evolution has failed you stupid man

Money is your god

Demoralized yet well behaved
All are guilty but none ashamed
Feasting on lives and wealth of the others
Modern vultures would kill one another

Basics of existence
From which suffering proceeds
Chatarsic release points
No meaning in deeds

Money is your god
