Yes, I gave my soul impalement
Cares I've buried with all the human waste

For only once lasts lifetime
And Thou marketh it for whole

Still, Death walks amongst us

Am I not at God's measuring the chosen one?
Not a son of perfection?
How can't mankind be saved?

I am - You are not
My life!
Hate I call!

And all my thirst for hatred,
Malevolence and for mankind slain
A broken unity
Help me Jesus!

I would love to know what's bad for Thee,
-My Dear God
What if I would resist Thy given price
For my life

A melting goblet
A lost victory

Hath Thou shouldst not cometh
From that realm of Thine?

Thou putrified liar!
Now and forever!
Amen!

Hate I Call... Or anything with evil blent

Shall we all be put to death?
Yet, Thou art The Forgiver
But to us, can Thou still forgive?

Liberty!

Hath Thou shouldst not cometh
From the realm of Thine?

Thou putrified liar!
Now and forever!
Amen!

Hate I Call... Or anything with evil blent

Shall we all be put to death?
Yet, Thou art The Forgiver
But to us, can Thou still forgive?

Liberty!
Quoth I

And Thy glory nevermore!
