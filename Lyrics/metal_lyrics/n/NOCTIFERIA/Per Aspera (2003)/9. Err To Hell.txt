What kind of guidance have I received
That sombre moment in the past?
Have you brought me a blade of salvation?

Starving heart of devotion
Now betrayed and forgotten
Thrown into the flesh

I scold the name of affection within myself
Shall you ever be forgotten
You are one of short duration that lasts forever

Gleam as my pride
Stand by my side... Temptations

A mere essence of evil accepted
Can it's goodness be ever rejected?

-Wandering of the Mad-

I put my glory and strength aside
I took the light in The Holy raid
No fiend of mine shalt Thee invade
Yet, Thy light shalt forever fade

What kind of guidance have I received
That sombre moment in the past?
Have you brought me a blade of salvation?

Starving heart of devotion
Now betrayed and forgotten
Thrown into the flesh

Be a God or a Lord
But still, Thee I can't adore
Thou hath reigneth of Thy time
Though you never have!

It is more than just intention of evil
I have taken my time
I have deceived love
It is more than just intention of evil
