The darkest delight is to raise up my pride
And take what is left of yours

Life betrays!
And all lies stay alive there
I shall make end to your ignorance
I grant you a day of suffering

Life betrays!
And all lies stay alive there

How will they adore all the darkness' empire
If there's no light to see it?

How will they adore all the darkness' empire
If there's no light to see it?

Worst are the lies
Told to myself
Sworn not to kill
Though now I still

Thus humans would cry
To drown in their tears
But tears are falling into oblivion

Atque tibi culpam demonstrantes
Et mendacem nominantes

Fond of Lies

How will they adore all the light's empire
If there's no darkness to make it from

Your eyes that make me wander
If we are but chosen
Or spawned by no meaning
There is no god that would die for you
But always counts to take your soul
...Or do you?

And want prevails
A truth of utopia
Concealed in me forever!
