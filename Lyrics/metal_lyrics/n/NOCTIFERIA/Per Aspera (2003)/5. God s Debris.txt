I am Deathstorm, I spread the rain of evil
I am Nightwolf, seeking flesh
I am Life, Death, God

Fall not into the life unchosen
Where dilemmas breed
You'll have a life of freedom raped
And I'll laugh above Ye mortal men

It is You making evil fertile
-Your bold ostentation
It is You giving me a succubus
-Your shit for osculation

Fierce destroying sacred
And their hands are cleansed with filth

I am dead, of life forgotten
Death! Carry me!
Through the Deathstorm, rain of evil
I - Feast for Nightwolves
I - God's Debris

I've been searching for You,
For I was lost
Yet every search I made for You,
Drove me in a deeper maze

And as passes every day of God
-Another man to kill
-Another lamb to fuck

Fierce destroying sacred
And their hands are cleansing with filth

You are a given trash
Or to someone
Some other time
Beyond defiance, You were born
This time of lifefall

Time is ceasing, Death is increasing

Your sight will aim my back from your den
And I won't return,
I won't return!

You are a given trash
Or to someone
Some other time
Beyond defiance, You were born
You were born!

You are a given trash
Or to someone
Some other time
Beyond defiance, You were born
You were born!
