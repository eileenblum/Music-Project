Honour of mankind did vanish since the counting began
Deaf were the ears of your god again
Betrayal unseen throughout oblivion

Feeble mankind!
Feeble beliefs!
Feeble souls!

And yet we still remain
Standing flesh and blood
Put them all to the sword
Drown them in the mud

Now we walk the road
That we carved in blood
Burning golden gate
And who see whole realm burning on

Realm burns on!
Realm burns on!
Until they
-all of them-
-to the last-
-pleading die!

With the fire blizzards
Awaken memories
Like our kingdom once
Now look and cry as your Realm burns on

And the fires shall gleam through the eternity

Do not be on the enemy's side
Be on the side of The Enemy!

Glorious is the warrior
Who wears the sign of the
Battlecourse
Fear spreads amongst the feeble
As they see the sign of the
Battlecourse

Do you remember the cries I have shouted
Cries of pain!
Hearken! Now as I cry again the cries of War!

Fear spreads amongst the feeble
As they see the sign of the
Battlecourse

Our death is bright
Yet, dark is our rebirth

Do you remember the cries I have shouted
God was deaf then
Now as you shout in pain
Your god's deaf again!
