One, two, three, society
Four, five, of life deprived
Six to eight, unseal your fate
Nine, ten, scream it again

There was a man and he went mad
Grim was the look of psychopath
The psycho of bursting ego
Only towards fall he can go
Clenching for top and all that's dear
His logic died incepting fear
Opened eyes but the mind went black
Modern man spreading sick mind
Plague

Stop
The madness of man's mind
Save
What's left inside
Accept
That you are sick
Wetiko is our own
Collective parasite

When he destroys what he creates
It's a shame, a big mistake
When destroyed something of nature
It's a progress for his future
Lost in maze of self-destruction
Panic driven innovations
Devolution, side-production
King of fools as a recognition
