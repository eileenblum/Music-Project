eat shit die fat
this is your future
nothing learned from the past
happy people gaga people
dumb bitch gold kitch
it's all you need
all you ever craved for
gaga people plastic people

whole world is a stage
a grotesque play for your fun
carneval bizzare
single truth is a multiple lie
done must be undone
your life is a piece of plastic cast
shit will hit the fan
we want you to lay to rest

we cross this world released of fear
we are among no one
here to turn you bungholes into dust
we want you all to lay to rest

consuming bull-shit
brain-dead maggots feeling free
bow to your freak show
it's the only thing you know
fuck fictional friends
world of shit latex romance
promoting regress
we want you to lay to rest

eat shit die fat
this is your future
nothing learned from the past
happy people gaga people
dumb bitch gold kitch
it's all you need
all you ever craved for
gaga people plastic people

we cross this world released of fear
we are among no one
here to turn you bungholes into dust
we want you all to lay to ... rest

for all the stupid man
is there no cure
is there no hope
for all you fools

your idol's dead
your dreams are dead
and he who slaves you

eat shit die fat
happy people gaga people
dumb bitch gold kitch
gaga people shitty people
