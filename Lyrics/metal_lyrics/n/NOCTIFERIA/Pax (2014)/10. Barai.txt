Drifting on and on
From birth 'till the end
Puzzle stays unsolved
All the questions contained
To firmly stand and spit in the face of fate
If not in this life
For next I will await
Time full of hollow words
When one ignores
What really matters the most
The empathy

Born as a wanderer
Raised to be a moral man
Of prejudice free, immune in vain
Born as a conqueror
Right seeking hunter of ignorant ones
Over life restrained

Time full of hollow words
When one ignores
What really matters the most
The empathy

In three words - it goes on
In two words - karma hurts
