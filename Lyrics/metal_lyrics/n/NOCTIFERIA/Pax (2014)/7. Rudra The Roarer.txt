Life
Transcending all states
Source
No understanding and sense
Fear
Of Death's abode
Force
Is existence to decode
Rays
Of a million suns
Shines 
On miraculous ones
Pure
Perpetual delight
Pain and bliss personified

Now roar
And peel off the crust to clean and cure the soul

Death
The circle connects
End's
Epoch of birth
Strength
Is hidden within
Art

Om
Existence
I am
Clouds
The storms can begin
Dirt
The sun shall ignite
Joy and tears glorified

Rudra
Reality obscene
Manifesting
Utopian dreams

Howl
For archers to come
Praise
Only the moral one
High
Awareness outset
Moult
To avert the threat
Deity
Is within me
I chant
For eternity to hear
Right
Lays in the heart
Wrong
Occurs in the mind

Prospect the spirit
Absolute truth's goal
Existence 
I am !
