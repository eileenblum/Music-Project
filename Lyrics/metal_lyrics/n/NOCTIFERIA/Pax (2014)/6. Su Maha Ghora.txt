How much silence can you really bare?
Like monument that withstands ages better than the rock
It is lost when is written - stars shoot joy through decay
By the rhythm of the heart
The sound that silences the mind
Make one irreversible mistake
That's when the desert giants rise
The same stream of life runs through your veins
In rhythmic measure single night and day

Bring forth what you hide
Cosmic child uprise
Align the stars and mind
Our sun sets to rise again

You are able to make the transition
But have to leave this third dimension
To grow above the earth

Su maha ghora...
