The Sleeper is awake
The Sleeper is awake
Awake, o sleeper

For Millenniums 
The dreams were all there was
And ten thousand eyes
Holding us in their paws

The Sleeper is awake
The Sleeper is awake
Now pitch black becomes a day
The Sleeper is awake
Deeper inner quake
Recall the dreams, incur a way
The Sleeper is awake
The Sleeper is awake
You too wake up and refuse to obey
The Sleeper is awake
Awake, o sleeper

Of million minds
And just as much of tongues with clenched fists
This sleeper can now walk
It's in all of us
The wondering soul
Undefeatable
Truth seeking Goliath

The lies were all there was
And ten thousand tongues
Dictating what is wrong
But the dreams
Will turn reality
Now the sleep is over
Dawn of the morality
