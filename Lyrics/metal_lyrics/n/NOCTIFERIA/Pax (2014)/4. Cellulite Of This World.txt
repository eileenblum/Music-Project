Questions are cancer to religion
Flames of truth scorching fools paradigm
Border line mentalist resistance
To take responsibility of own life
Murder, rape, deceit
Monstrous face
Of mass religion, man's disgrace
Afraid of life, they're hypocrite and naive
I... wonder if... this madness
Will... ever end at all

This is sick, sick, sick song
This is sickness called belief
Liars... sick, sick, sick tongues
Are you infected ?

Greed, war, disease
God is great
Heavens need money, not your faith
We feel
We see
We hear
(Only) fools don't

We feel
