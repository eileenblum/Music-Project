"If a cluttered place's a sign of a cluttered mind,
of what, then, is an empty place a sign?"
Force-feeding brain with verbal junk again
The life's a deep scar on face of integrity

Try to talk some sense to a moron
Ask him no questions, he will tell you no lies
When truth is replaced by silence
The silence is a lie
What is ever certain ?
A truth that's told with bad intent
Beats all the lies you can invent
Beats all... beats all the lies

Don't listen to what people say
Don't listen to what cowards scream
The words are weightless
Never fail to watch what they do
When their tongues are removed
Actions become louder than screams

When truth is replaced by silence
The silence is a lie
What is ever certain ?
A truth that's told with bad intent
Beats all... beats all the lies
