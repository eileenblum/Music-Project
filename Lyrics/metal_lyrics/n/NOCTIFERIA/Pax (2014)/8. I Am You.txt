I am the God to all men
Old giver of fate
Who conceives the minds
In which devils procreate
All of the saintly deeds
All the heinous crimes
Non-existence of rue
I am God and so are you
Your suffering is also mine
By killing me you're killing yourself

I destroy to create
These are my deeds
And so are yours
I am you, you are me

You are all things and all beings
Ever conjoined in the mind
You are the spiraling flow
The prophet, the soul
The rocks molding the mud
Seeds that grow the stem
Genes flapping the wings
Thoughts and lighting of mind
Your suffering is also mine
By killing me you're killing yourself
