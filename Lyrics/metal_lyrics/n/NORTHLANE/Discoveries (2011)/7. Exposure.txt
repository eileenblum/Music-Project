I'll tear the memories out of my subconscious and piece together where I went wrong
Sewn together with the strands of lament I'll cloak myself in a veil of remorse and regret that keep me bound to a world that will never forget
So as I walk through the street eyes and voices consume my mind, they stare ambiguously

Here I am with all my insecurities, all my imperfections, crying out to a world that just won't listen
Lend me your ears, your hearts and your minds and discover what's missing

These words are the only thing keeping me from falling into the darkness where my thoughts are no longer my own
In the arms of my kin, my family
In the hearts of those sincere
In the face of adversity
Here I am
Here I am

Free from hindrance, from all doubt, from all the voices calling me out
Free from hindrance, from all doubt, from all the voices calling me out

Here I am pouring my mind and heart into a world that doesn't listen
That doesn't listen
For those who remember
For those who care
Remember, you are not alone
You are not alone
You are not alone

Here I am

Here I am stuck in a world that never listens (never listens)
Here I am pouring my heart out, I am not alone
I am not alone
