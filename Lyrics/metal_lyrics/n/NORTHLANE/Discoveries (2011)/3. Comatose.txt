I'll let the silence speak for me
The words are like stars unimaginable in my sky

I can see what the eyes cannot see
I can hear what the ears cannot hear
I can feel what the heart and mind cannot feel
I am imagination

What if dreams were reality?
We could reap a world we've sewn
Lost in imagination
Lost in a world that is not your own

Watching my world crumble away
While I'm searching for meaning and purpose in this life
Flourished in knowledge and gifted with a pure existence

I can see what the eyes cannot see
I can hear what the ears cannot hear

I've given myself a reason to live for
On my own, I've given myself something to live for
On my fucking own

(On my own)
(On my own)
On my own
On my own

Upon this desolate rock I cast my soul into the sky, into the sky
Liberating myself and opening my mind to the universe
Liberating myself and opening my mind to the universe

Together we will shine a light like stars burning through the dark
Together we will shine a light like stars burning through the dark
Together we will shine a light like stars burning through the dark
Through the dark
