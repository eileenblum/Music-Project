I've lived life drained
Void of emotion
I've lived life drained
I will never become this again

I will rise over this
I will rise over this
Oh

Smash through obstacles with a heart of gold and a mind of steel
Smash through obstacles with a heart of gold and a mind of steel
Nothing will stand in my path

I've been consumed by my thoughts
I've become what I've always despised
The only way I can absolve myself is with your lies

I've been pushed to the edge
Where my mind knows no bounds

Never again, never again
Never again, never again
My mind has released itself from this anguish and I will overcome this suffering
I will be whole and I will overcome this suffering
I will be whole once again

I will be whole once again
I will be whole once again

And, and I will become the answer to my own prayers
And I won't let you bring me down
Oh

I will remain

Nothing you say can tear this heart away from me
