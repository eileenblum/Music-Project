All my life I've been searching for something to put my faith into, to give my life to you
And I will love you in this world and if there's a next
And I will love you in this world and if there's a next
Amongst the chaos of this world
And the overwhelming tide of responsibility
I remember how long it's been since I've felt warmth within my heart

A cold world where love would transcend this dimension
A continuous source of inspiration

And I've been waiting for all of my, all my life
I've been searching for something to put my faith into, to give my life to you
And I will love you in this world and the next

All I want is to remember what it's like to love again
This blistering cold, I've grown so fond of left me in a heartless state

And after all these years I've finally realised that maybe I was never meant to love, or be loved
And if you want to run away
I can take you there
I can take you somewhere beautiful and it can be our world
And if you want to run away
I can take you there
I can take you somewhere beautiful and it can be our world
