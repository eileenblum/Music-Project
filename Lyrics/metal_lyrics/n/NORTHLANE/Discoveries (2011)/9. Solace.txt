Leave me be
I grow tired of all your lies and false accusations
My only consolation

Painful, yet relishing
A melody of relief
These voices wage wars in my mind

I retire from this world and embrace silence
To rest my weary head and escape modern life

Oh the beauty of a realm with eternal peace

Leave me be
I grow tired of all your lies and false accusations
My only consolation

The beast that grows inside of me
The beast is solitude

Deep, dark, death-like solitude
The mist will settle on still water, go!

I won't let this go
I won't let this go

Oh the beauty of a realm with eternal peace
Where the silence comforts this heart
In this life there are answers buried deep within yourself
In this life there are answers buried deep within yourself
In this life there are answers buried deep within yourself
In this life there are answers buried deep within yourself
