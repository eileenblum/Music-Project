I opened my eyes to the world
Day after day I searched for answers
As time went by I grew further away from who I was

I felt lost chasing a ghost
I might never find
But what I found I wasn't prepared for
Everywhere I look I see crime without punishment
I just didn't know where to begin

I am holding onto what bit of sanity I have left
I am holding onto what bit of sanity I have left

Come fight with me my brothers
And claim our world that's been violated by the hands of the corrupt
I am but one, but together we hold the key to a new dawn of prosperity

We've created a seed that has spread to the core of humanity
Killing itself from the inside, unintentional suicide

Money and corruption ruin the land
Crooked politicians betray the working man
Pocketing the profits, treating us like sheep
We're tired of hearing promises we know they'll never keep

I will become the end of this sad and bleak corruption that reigns on all
I will become the end of this sad and bleak corruption that reigns on all
I will become the end of this sad and bleak corruption that reigns on all
I will become the end of this sad and bleak corruption that reigns on all
