Oh

Remake
Reform the consciousness
Let the light bleed
Out of your eyes and mouth
Seek the answers to the questions that constrain your mind to this futile dimension

We are the severed minds disconnected from the masses
A world of free thinkers

We are longing for an understanding of the universe
Around us when we barley understand the universe within our minds

Free your mind

Who will answer the call when it comes from within?
Who will answer the call?

I stand before you baring a flood of change
I stand before you to undo and rearrange
Remove the blindfold
Realize the lies told
And see the world with new eyes

Abra su mente a la realidad
Abra su mente a la realidad

We are the severed minds disconnected from the masses
A world of free thinkers

We are the severed minds disconnected from the masses
A world of free thinkers

So take this life and hold it
For it's about to change
Bleed out the coursing veins
Who will answer the call when it comes from within?
