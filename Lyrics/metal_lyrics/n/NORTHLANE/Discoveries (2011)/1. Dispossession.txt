Lost in a valley of smoke
I lose sight of those I love
I can't live in this dream
Wondering the world a lost soul

A shell of a man
Frozen in a toxic trance
A shell of a man
Frozen in a toxic trance

Unfamiliar reflection stare at me
These eye are not my own
Running from my demons in this endless valley

Uh

Show me the way (show me the way)
Because I no longer know
Right from wrong

I know what has to be done
The smoke will settle
The demons will come
And I will be torn apart (apart, apart, apart, apart...)

Exposing my weakness the world will see
What I never, what I never, what I never fucking wanted

As I stare at your face, soaked in disgrace
What is the price, a judgment of life
I cry out in this dispossession

Exposing my weakness the world will see
What I never, what I never, what I never fucking wanted

They crowd around me
Here to take their share of my mind
I can no longer
Muster the strength to face them alone, all on my own

They whisper echoes in unknown tongues
I refuse to absorb their toxic words
I've forgotten how to love
Searching behind locked doors in my mind

They whisper echoes in unknown tongues
I refuse to absorb their toxic words
I've forgotten how to love
Searching behind locked doors in my mind

Cast aside the fear of reality
Face the fucking world

Cast aside the fear of reality
Face the fucking world

Oh
