He saw the life slip from her emerald eyes
Confusion, illusion, had soaked up her mind
She clutched his hand, whispered her soul,
"I never wanted to grow so old
Life's agony, turn off the machine
Let me leave this world with dignity."

Just let me leave this world

Bed of nails under the guillotine
Wake me up when my heart stops beating
When my heart stops beating 

Wipe those tears of grief away young man
Let me leave this world
Let me leave this world in peace
Raise me from this bed of nails
And let the angels carry me away
Away
Carry me away.

Bed of nails under the guillotine
Wake me up when my heart stops beating
When my heart stops beating 

Let me leave this world
