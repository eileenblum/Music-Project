I am what I create

Lashed by tongues of electric fire
Shimmering rivers crystalline
Run through frozen glimpses in time
And
I just can't ignore this sight
Pouring down on me relentlessly
I just can't ignore this feeling
Deafened by rolling waves of realisation
Frozen, mesmerised in the rain

In my darkest days
I only saw the shades of grey
In a world that drips in colour

Droplets of life form
In freefall in convalescence
They hammer into the soil
Carving new streams of essence,
Through turmoil

I am just as fluid,
As immortal and lucid,
As the earth that morphs
In the violence of a thunderstorm

My life is what I make
Of my trials and my mistakes
My life is what
I make
I am what I create

In my darkest days
I only saw the shades of grey
In a world that drips in colour
