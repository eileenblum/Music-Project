So alone in our digital world

The walls are closing in
Shrinking down to the box in the palm of my hand
The shock has settled in
Fibers and wires
Feed me the link that we desire

Every circuit getting smarter
Every signal getting stronger
But our ties are getting weaker
And I see us sinking deeper

I see it sinking deeper

Flawed relations of ones and zeroes connecting us to our digital heroes
An anti-social network where everyone's a fucking expert

I see it sinking deeper

Hollow as a hologram
Electricity without the spar
Hearts left to flicker and fade
Out in the dark

So alone in our digital world

Impulses flowing through my veins
Impulses flowing through copper
Flowing in waves
It feels so close
Yet so far away

Every circuit getting smarter
Every signal getting stronger
But our ties are getting weaker
And I see us sinking deeper

I see it sinking deeper

The walls are closing in
