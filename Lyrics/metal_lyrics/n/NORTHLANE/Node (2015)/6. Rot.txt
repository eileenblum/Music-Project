So cold my soul's numb
Like an icy breeze on solstice morning
The worst enemyâs one thatâs homegrown
This is more than just a faceless warning.

Don't let the world rot
Don't let the world rot
Hanging by a thread they just putrefy
Our blood our birth our sky
And we will not stand by
Don't let the world rot

So warm the sun burns my soul
Like the fossils in the earth they take my breath

Black blood bleeding heart filled stone
Take the power away from the hands of death

A web of minds connected
Take purpose,
Take action
Cause a reaction
Entangle the spiders
Make sense of this mess
A mind at large
Is a power they canât repress

We are all connected
We are one you and I
Yeah we will not stand by

Donât let the world rot

Omnipotent mind at large
Sick of living underhanded
This is our life we command it
Go
We canât all hide in fear
A time of reckoning is near
We are all connected
Donât let the world rot

We canât all hide in fear
A time of reckoning is near
We are all connected
A web of minds connected
Take purpose,
Take action,
Cause a reaction
Entangle the spiders
Make sense of this mess
A mind at large
Is a power they canât repress

Sick of living underhanded
This is our life we command it
