The earth gets smaller with everything i see
A technicolor picture on a black and white screen
There's a blackout on the ground
But an energy above the trees
Just past the edge of sound
So climb the ladder with me

Wanderer
Survey the shrinking globe
All your troubles seem smaller
The farther you go
Wanderer
Never coming home
All your troubles seem smaller
The farther you go

Shed the dead weight
Flight will follow
From the island that world will surely swallow

Falling our of orbit 
My thoughts scrambled and distorted 
Sailing through space in a panic
To escape the static

Escape the static

Wanderer
Survey the shrinking globe
All your troubles seem smaller
The farther you go
Wanderer
Never coming home
All your troubles seem smaller
The farther you go

How clear is the air up there
Breathe easy 
Breathe easy as you leave the atmosphere 
Breathe easy
