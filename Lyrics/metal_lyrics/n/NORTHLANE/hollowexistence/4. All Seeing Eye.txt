Nothing but a memory its now not then that i treasure a glimpse of the past
returned to me through the eyes of the innocent. they dont care so why should i
!? it when you feel safe that you forget about the future, well its about time
i ripped you out of that suspended moment. throw you out into the cold. to let
the people speak their minds. voices of reflections help me carry on and
remember what its like to be alive, this wont be the end of me. nothing but a
memory its now not then that i treasure a glimpse of the past returned to me
through the eyes of the innocent.
