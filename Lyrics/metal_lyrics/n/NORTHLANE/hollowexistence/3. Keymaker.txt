Our secrets are laid bare before my eyes its i and i alone who can grant
passage to our most inner circle. who can judge the weak from the strong ? the
truth from the falsehood the sacred record of our unforgiving past and of the
torturous road we have trodden, i alone bare these burdens on my shoulders sit
sins of the angels, i alone know the names of those who've fallen from grace. i
cannot rest whilst they still remain to stain our our, im the master, your the
puppet that dances to my tune. our secrets are laid bare before my eyes its i
and i alone who can grant passage to our most inner circle. and you shall taste
the undreamed joys that lie beyond the bounds of a mortal sense.
