God has left this place a long time ago but i still remain here until the
bitter end i will never give up this world enthralled by hatred which swarms
and consumes this fragile society and when you think im done ill remain dead
inside you ill come back to haunt you, your so torn. i will rule this place ill
burn it to the ground i will rise from these ashes just to bring it all down
again! welcome to my wasteland! in the end it wont mean anything your presence
taints the air we breathe you fucking hide behind your numbers you return our
streets to sand you shall wither away where you stand shall wither away you
will drown in what you've created your false gods wont help you now, your fears
seep through the cracks in our walls destroying you rats from the inside, your
fears seep through the cracks in our walls, destroying you rats from the inside
out!
