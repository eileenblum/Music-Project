Words from a distant past echo throughout my mind! changing me, destroying me.
whispers of the dead pull me under and they have been doing so for so long,
they have been doing so. i have come from hell with sins stained clearly within
my skin but know i rest absolved, stand in light without fear. theyd like to
think our fate is set in stone, but i will build my own path, with these hands.
the words of the wise will be forever carved into my skin unless i make
something of these last breaths. words from a distant past echo throughout my
mind. changing me, destroying me. and now i have these wings i must fly
straight and not surrender to demons chasing me. my fate my destiny i hold to
these like i do my life, i am the architect of my fate.
