I've lived life drained, void of emotions, i've lived life drained, i will
never become this again. i will rise over this. smash through obstacles with a
heart of gold and a mind of steel. nothing will stand in my path, ive been
consumed by my thoughts, i've become what i've always despised, they only way i
can absolve myself is with your lies. i've been pushed to the edge where my
mind knows no bounds, never again. my mind has released itself from this
anguish and i will overcome this suffering i will be whole and i will overcome
this suffering i will be whole once again. and i will become the answer to my
own prayers, and i wont let you bring me down. i will remain! nothing you say
will tear this heart away from me!
