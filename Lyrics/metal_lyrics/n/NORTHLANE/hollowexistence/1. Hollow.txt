I never forgot the time i lost faith in this a lost journey of many years, my
heart has been torn in twain but still i stand and here i shall remain, with a
feeble mind and a sea of lies dragging me to the depths of false beliefs, i
seek the answer, the search will consume me until i sleep and perhaps dream of
such a reality. shame lurks within my soul, in my tortured dreams, but im free
from the shackles of ignorance, right now! i am free! i am drowning in
unhallowed waters, merely a hollow vessel of existence, merely a vessel of
existence. looking through faithless eyes, am i afraid to die ? are you afraid
to die ? i will remember, when the skies are clear, i will remember, when my
death is near, will you remember, the faith i had in you ? will you remember ?
when my time has come.
