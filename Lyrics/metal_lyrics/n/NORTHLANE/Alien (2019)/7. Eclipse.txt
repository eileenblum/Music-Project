Salted streams of dismay
Cascade down my swollen face
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
And I can taste your failure

BLAME
A loyal dog on a tight lead
SHAME
A rabid wolf you can't feed
PAIN
Is what you feel
But you can't speak
So take it out on me

Take it out on me

I was here to catch your blows
Bruises, tears, no place called home
By your design, my fear's alive
No place to hide, your sacrifice

Butterfly wings would shake the ground
Every miniscule action you surround
With anger, abuse and more bad news
Your truth is fear
You taste of failure

BLAME
A loyal dog on a tight lead
SHAME
A rabid wolf you can't feed
PAIN
Is what you feel
But you can't speak
So take it out on me

Take it out on me

Salted streams
Of dismay
Cascade down
My swollen face

I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid
And I can taste your failure

I will never let myself be like you

You think we're one in the same
There's more to me than a name
I'll wear it proud but
I will never let myself be like you
