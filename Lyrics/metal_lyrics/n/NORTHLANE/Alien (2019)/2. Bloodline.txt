I can't escape you
No matter how far I run (can't escape you)
I can't erase you
From who I've become (you're a part of me)

Memories coursing through my veins
Like the scars in yours, my roots remain

I was raised in hell
I made it out by myself
I was raised to bleed
Bad blood runs wild and free

(Bad blood runs wild and free)

I thought you were dreaming
Eyes rolled to the stars
Sinking slowly in muddy water
Set beneath the tar
You left me in dark

We grew up scared
Bruised and battered
Youth torn and tattered
As long as you were sky high
Nothing fucking mattered
Hotel homes in the cross
Under the bridge and lost
With your heads in the clouds above
You call this love

I was raised in hell
I made it out by myself
I was raised to bleed
Bad blood runs wild and free

I thought you were dreaming (hell raised me)
I thought you were dreaming
Bad blood runs wild and free

(Bad blood runs wild and free)
