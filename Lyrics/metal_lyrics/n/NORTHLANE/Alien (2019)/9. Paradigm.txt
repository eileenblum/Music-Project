I'm here with you
But I won't hold my breath
For you to fix this disconnect

I'm filled with doubt
Won't hold my breath
I've seen your past
I lived through it

You've come so far
Will you relapse?
I'm here with you
Please don't go back

I'm here with you, I'm here with you
(I hear the echoes of the past; will the feeling last?)
And I'm consumed by dÃ©ja vu
(I saw your faults spread into the cracks)
I'm here with you, I'm here with you
(Quicksand; I fear that you're sinking in)
The devil danced
In morning dew
Until the end
I'm here with you

I'm here with you

Standing where it all began
Bracing for complete collapse
Dread is over me
Hope rewinding time
Drowning in the change of tides
Will you mend our paradigm

I'm here with you, I'm here with you
(I hear the echoes of the past; will this feeling last?)
And I'm consumed by dÃ©ja vu
(I saw your faults spread into the cracks)
I'm here with you, I'm here with you
(Quicksand; I fear that you're sinking in)
The devil danced
In morning dew
Until the end
I'm here with you

Drowning in the change of tides
Will you mend our paradigm
Drowning in the change of tides
Will you mend our paradigm
