Brick by brick, from day one
The odds were stacked against me
Brick by brick, overrun
Now the walls that surround me
Block the sun
Now the walls that surround me
Block the sun

Stranded by what comforts me
Life's a nightmare blooming free

Bleary eyes
Trace the lines
I cross between
I can't see if the grass is green
Or if the garden's dead and twisted
Like me on the inside

Stranded by what comforts me
Life's a nightmare blooming free
Stranded by what confronts me
I escape with what I choose to breathe

The odds were stacked against me
Now the walls that surround me
Block the sun
Block the sun
Block the sun
Block the sun

Block out the sun

Stranded by what comforts me
Life's a nightmare blooming free
Stranded by what confronts me
I escape with what I choose to breathe
Choose to breathe

(Block out the sun)
The odds were stacked against me
