Tear my throat
From my neck
Wouldn't you love
A voiceless wreck
Pull me apart
Like I'm defective
Point out my flaws
Like you'll be respected

Strike out my name
With infinite potential
Speak for my fame
Like you're influential
How do you sleep so sound
With so many demons
In your head to wrestle (head to wrestle)

You fed me lies
I severed ties

You can't make me disappear
You tried to break me
But I'm still here
You can't make me disappear
You tried to break me
But I'm still here

You can't make me disappear

Keep running, joke
You are regret
Always bouncing back
Just like your cheques
A monument
On hollow ground
Lived nine lives more
Then fucking sold me out
Cat took your tongue
But none of your credentials
Don't waste my time with your sentimentals
How can you speak without shred of sincere

You can't make me disappear
You tried to break me
But I'm still here
You can't make me disappear
You tried to break me
But I'm still here

You can't make me disappear

Point out my flaws
Strike out my name
Pull me apart
You fucking fake

You can't make me disappear
You tried to break me
I'm still here

I'm still here

You are regret
Wouldn't you love a voiceless wreck
Tear my throat from my neck

You are regret
Wouldn't you love a voiceless wreck
Tear my throat from my neck
