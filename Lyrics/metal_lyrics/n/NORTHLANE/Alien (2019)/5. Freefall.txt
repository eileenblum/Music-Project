The curtains were always drawn
Splinters of light spilled through the walls
Escape was alone in my sleep
'Cause now I can't feel

I can't feel at all
I can't feel at all
Your embrace in this freefall

Sharing a tired mattress on the floor
Hazy eyes in the night
Waking to the crash
As he broke down the door
Loaded for slaughter
"Please don't kill me in the face of my son and daughter"
I still hear them screaming
But I can't feel at all

I can't feel at all
I can't feel at all
Your embrace in this freefall

Your embrace in this freefall
Your embrace in this freefall

Like cold metal to the temple of my father
I'm numb when you suffer

I'm numb when you suffer

No empathy to give to another soul
Stolen from me forever
I will never be whole
No empathy to give to another soul
I'm numb when you suffer
