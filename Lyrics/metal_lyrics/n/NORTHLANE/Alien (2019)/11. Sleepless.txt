I can't reach your hand
I can't liberate you
I know you're alive
But in my heart I've said goodbye
So tonight
I'm sleepless

Afraid of what I might become
A curse I've tried to ignore
But still it leaves me feeling numb
I wish I could have done more
It's taken over every cell
Why are you drowning yourself
When you are so unwell?

I can't reach your hand
I can't liberate you
I know you're alive
But in my heart I've said goodbye
So tonight
I'm sleepless

I keep this out of sight,
Out of mind
But I never left it all behind

I never left it all behind

I can't reach your hand
I can't liberate you
I know you're alive
But in my heart I've said goodbye
So tonight
I'm sleepless

I'm sleepless
