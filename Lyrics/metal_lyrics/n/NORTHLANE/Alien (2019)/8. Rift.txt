I'm not afraid
Of the void
Between me and you

The things that divide us
Just lines in the sand
Lies never true

We're all the same
The world's going to end
We're all condemned
And misconstrued

The world's going to end

I'm not afraid
Of the void
Between me and you

We're all the same
The world's going to end
We're all condemned
And misconstrued

The world's going to end
