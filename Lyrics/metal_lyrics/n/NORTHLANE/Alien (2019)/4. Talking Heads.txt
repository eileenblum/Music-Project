Tip-toe through the ruins of my mind
Desolation in disguise
I've been locked out of my thoughts for a long time
The rusted gates
Deteriorate
Do my insecurities relate?
It's like I'm waiting to fall apart (to fall apart)

Waiting to fall apart

My eyes are a sight below the surface
The veil's wearing thin
I don't fit into my skin
Maybe I'm just like the rest of them
But I refuse to take the medicine
To escape the mess I'm in
Outspoken
By the voices in my head

The voices in my head

My mind is silenced
By the talking heads
Chattering at me
With every waking breath
My eyes are a sight below
These voices I can't put to rest
My eyes are a sight below
The veil's wearing thin
I don't fit into my skin

Maybe I'm just like the rest of them
But I refuse to take the medicine
To escape the mess I'm in
Outspoken
By the voices in my head

The voices in my head

My mind is silenced by the talking heads
Drowning out reason, drowning in lament
My mind is silenced by the talking heads
Outspoken by the voices in my head

Outspoken by the voices in my head

My mind is silenced by the talking heads
Chattering with every waking breath
My mind is silenced by the talking heads
Outspoken by the voices in my head
