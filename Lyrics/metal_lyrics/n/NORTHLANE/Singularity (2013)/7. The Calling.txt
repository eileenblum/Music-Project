I am here to show you there is hope in a dying world
(I can hear the calling)
And if you don't believe me you won't even see that what you're living in is hell
You're living in hell
I am here to spread and speak the truth
I am here to heal and do what's right
Dissolving fear, spreading the light
I am here to open and free your mind
Together we travel into realms of evolution
The greatest mystery
We are the fractulated tendrils of this reality
All my will is bent on change
The universe is ours to rearrange
Follow my lead and in fact you'll see
We create our reality

I am here to show there's hope in a dying world
(I can hear the calling)
And I won't stand by
And watch the dream wither and die
This is my destiny in life
I can hear the calling

All my will is bent on change
The universe is ours to rearrange
Follow my lead and in fact you'll see
We create our reality
All my will is bent on change
The universe is ours to rearrange
Follow my lead and in fact you'll see
We create our reality
All my will is bent on change
The universe is ours to rearrange
Follow my lead and in fact you'll see
We create our reality
All my will is bent on change
The universe is ours to rearrange
Follow my lead and in fact you'll see
We create our reality
