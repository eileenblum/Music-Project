When the wind breaks before our very path
We are swept away (swept away)
I hear the wind howling my name
When the wind breaks before our very path
We are swept away (swept away)
I hear the wind howling my name

Leaving behind me everything I thought that i should be
Everything they told me was right
Leaving behind me everything I thought that I should be
Everything they said about life
We have made the sacrifices
We have been patient for long enough
It is our chance our time
Our time
Our time to rise the fuck up
I will break the wind

This road it leads so far away from home
I breathe in the air down a road to nowhere

Streams of oxygen soothe our forms
We long to breathe in the air around us
I feel the kiss of the breeze against my face
We long to feel the air around us

I'm packing up
I'm leaving here
Don't know when I'm coming back
Close your eyes and I disappear
I'm packing up
I'm leaving here
Don't know when I'm coming back
Close your eyes and I disappear
Floating free throughout this life
Reshaping my thoughts, time does wither the mind
And in due time
The life I thought I wanted I never seem to find
It might be dark, it might be cold
So if I ever feel like turning back
I just breathe and remember
Where I am (where I am) inside (inside) the dream
I will break the wind
When the wind breaks before our very path
We are swept away (swept away)
I hear the wind howling my name
When the wind breaks before our very path
We are swept away, swept away (swept away)
I hear the wind howling my name

Break!
I will break the wind
