Every single moment time will melt away my life
What choices do I have?
How do I know is wrong or right?

How do I speak of what I see through my own eyes
Without telling you that the truth youâve known is all a lie?
Stop living the lie, existing just because you can

I can be the dreamer
I can, I am
