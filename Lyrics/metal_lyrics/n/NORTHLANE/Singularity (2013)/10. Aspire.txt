I'll carve my own name into the earth
I'll carve my own name into the earth
Don't tell me how to think
Don't tell me how to live my own life
I make my own decisions
And I'll pay the ultimate price

A collection of memories (memories)
How could I ever forget? (How could I ever forget?)
This is a journey of lessons (this is a journey of lessons)
From my birth to my death

A path of opposites
And all the choices in between
I'm running scared through this poetic tragic movie scene
The days turn into weeks
Months then turn into years
We'll stand the test of time
Our hope will persevere

I roam across the land
I wish to seek and understand
The truth about life and about who I really am
My blood is still young and karma's knocking at my door
It's time to stand up
This is my life I'm fighting for

It's time to set the record straight
No more excuses, no more complaints
Leave everything behind, get up and live your dream
Don't let it fade away
We are all born to be free
Fuck who you want me to be
Born to be free

A path of opposites
And all the choices in between
I'm running scared through this poetic tragic movie scene
The days turn into weeks
Months then turn into years
We'll stand the test of time
Our hope will persevere

I roam across the land
I wish to seek and understand
The truth about life and about who I really am
My blood is still young and karma's knocking at my door
It's time to stand up
This is my life I'm fighting for

I roam across the land
I wish to seek and understand
The truth about life and about who I really am
My blood is still young and karma's knocking at my door
It's time to stand up
This is the life we're fighting for
This is the life we're fighting for

I'll carve my own name into the earth
I'll carve my own name into the earth
I'll carve my own name into the earth
I'll carve my own name into the earth
