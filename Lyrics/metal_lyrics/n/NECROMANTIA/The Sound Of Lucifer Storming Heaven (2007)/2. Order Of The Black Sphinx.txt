The ruby stone decoded
The way of Lucifer unfolded
Exposed by the formulas
Of the emerald tablet

The brain, the heart, the genitals
In formalin preserved
Serving the greater scheme
Unlocking the five angels

The science of Alchemy
Disciples of the Sphinx
And when the stars unite as one
Into angels we transform

An alchemical blend
A supreme form of magic
Destined to reveal the Pure
The highest of all secrets

Luminous and glorious
The Fallen One now speaks
Uncovering the veil of lies
Making our souls immortal
