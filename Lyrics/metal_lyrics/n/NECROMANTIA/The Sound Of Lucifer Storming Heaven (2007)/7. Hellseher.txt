Something has taken over my mind
Something is guiding my hand
I can see but I am blind
I feel the Devil's rage inside

It's burning, burning
From the depths of my soul
Like Hell itself has moved in me
Darkening my every thought

All this blood, these tears
Screams echo in my mind
Despair, power and lust
From the lions of the Scarlet Whore

I dream and I command
They follow like sheep
Lamps to the slaughter of my greed
A grand macabre sacrifice

The price of glorification
A million lives paid in blood
And I have to see them through
The eyes of the Antichrist

I am the Host
Of every sin
Bringer of pain
The Anti-god
