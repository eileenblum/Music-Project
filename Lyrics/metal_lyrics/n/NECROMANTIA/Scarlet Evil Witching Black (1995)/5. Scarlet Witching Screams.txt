Turn from the light and live for eternity

A mesmerizing whisper
I once heard in a dream
And blood painted my dream scarlet
Sending my soul to sleep

I dreamed a purple night sky
Which I crossed on black wings
I met the Queen of Darkness
Destined to be my bride
And blood painted my dream scarlet
Sending my soul to weep

I once dreamed of a tower
Of black ebony stone
Surrounded by three rivers
Flegethon, Acheron and Styx
And blood painted my dreams scarlet
Drowning my soul in grief

I dreamed of frozen caverns
Bathed in pale moonlight
Unearthly bat-like figures
Were resting in the vault
And blood painted my dream scarlet
Marking my soul to deep

I once dreamed of a grey wolf
Which came and licked my hands
I gazed into the beast's eyes
And saw that I must hunt
And blood painted my dream scarlet
Upsetting my soul from sleep

And now I dream of myself
Transformed and born again
Free from the earthen death tides
Entering dreams of others
And blood paints my dreams scarlet
Sending my soul to feed
