Oh ancient one, thy the knowledge of death
Rise from thy tomb
And reveal thy wisdom, the secrets of life
To the daughters of the endless night
Born in my womb

Oh powerful queen, thy the knowledge of fear
Dangerous when crossed, the art of sorcery
The bringers of joy and misery
Thy children never tell thy mystery

Oh mother of shadows, thy the knowledge of sorrow
Join the dance in the garden of Dionysus delight
Joy of life (ecstasy of lust)
We embrace thy shining light tonight
