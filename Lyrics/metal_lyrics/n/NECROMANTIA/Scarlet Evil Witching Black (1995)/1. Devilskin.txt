Draped in silken skin and torment
Hellbound and riding ghosts in flames
I'll usurp the moon and kill the sun
I'll sink the world into a dream of pain

I'll weave an invocation
To insanity and rebirth
Fiery lightning hold my hand
Show me your face in black waters

My worst, declared enemies
Are my most devoted slaves
They inspire me a wolf idolatry
I'll burn them in my witch-pyre

Tonight I'll drown the face of mankind
Into the dark blood of it's own heart
Even the shadows reflect my rage
Tonight I'm wearing Satanskin

Tonight I'm wearing Satanskin
And blood will paint my canvass
Tonight I'm wearing Satanskin
The beast is loose within me
DEVILSKIN, SATANSKIN!
