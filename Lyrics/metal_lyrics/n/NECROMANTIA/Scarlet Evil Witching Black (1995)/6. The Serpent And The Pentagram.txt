Spiritual bonds and scared oaths
Malevolent spells carved on pagan flesh
Paranormal symbolism of chaos
And the serpent crawling in dark paths

In the mirrored chateau of the Worm
Daimonia dance in pentagrams
And a Sumerian wizard's chanting
Mental spellbinding rhapsodies

The serpent is now fire
And the pentagram is one

Visions stream from ruined temples
Where shapeshifting witches fornicate
Poisoned by the ruby elixir
Made by the dreams of burning infants

Like profane whispers to the moon
Are the secret ways the Ravens pray
A carmine litany in reverse
For the spirits of the Unpure

Typhona, Leviathan, Jormungand, Tiamat
Bless me with your venom
And touch me with your soul
