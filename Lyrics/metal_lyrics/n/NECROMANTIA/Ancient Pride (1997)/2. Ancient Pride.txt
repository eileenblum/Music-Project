The Glory of Your Love
Is Built Upon Our People's Pain
And Your Glory is Painted Red
Of Our Noble Blood You Shed.

You Came And Slaughtered Odin
You Came And Murdered Zeus
Our Gods Became Your Satan
And Satan Became Our God

The Ancient Pride
Still Burns Within Us
Honour, Strength And Joy
By Force We'll Purge Our Soil

The Wolf, The Bear, The Raven
Still Guard The Ancient Soul
The Ram Will Crush Your Temples
The Bull Will Slay Your Priests

Your Brought The Faith of Slavery
You Crowned The King of Slaves
You Raped And Spoiled our Beauty
But Conquered Not our Hearts

The Woods Became our Shelters
the caves Became our Shrines
Gidden From The Greedy Eyes
OF Our Mad, Mercyful God
