[performed by Necromantia]Born in frenzied ritual dance
Hatched in a cleansing fire
Of sacrificed innocence
of a dark and faceless goddess
Children of the shadow self
Thoughts of a psychomancer
On astral seas the sail their ships
Usurping stealing mortals' dreams

Gazing into helpless souls
Harvesting for their master
The Beast, the witch, the hierophant
Offsprings of a tulpa spell
Shapeshifting serpentine
Extensions of the dragon
Predators of the spiritworld
Chimairas of the mind

I can hear the shadow-wolf
Fighting the dreamslayer

Spiritforms of the psychomancer
Shadowforms of the innerself
Spiritforms of the necromancer
Shadowforms of the innerself
