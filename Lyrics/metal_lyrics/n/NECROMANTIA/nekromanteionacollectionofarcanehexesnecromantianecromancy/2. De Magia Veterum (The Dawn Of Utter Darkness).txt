[Promo tape 1990 track][performed by Necromantia]Worship me you mortal fools
open my seal adore my name
cause I'm the messanger of pain,
the courier of hate,
the beloved of the ancient ones.
I came before their arrival
from the astral plains of cosmic chaos bow your heads!
Don't dare to face them!
They'll make humanity bleed!
They'll make Jesus weep...
I dwell in the ancient R'lye
dreaming in the blind depths of abyss my human servants
enlightened by my dreams now heed my call.
Now death is mortified, because it's alive
what has been eternal lain!
Alive is Cthulhu, the treatest of all!

Open the Gates

I'm veiled in hideous smells
that bring death to your mind
my face is a blasphemy
made by human entrails.
I'm Humvava, the dark angel!

Open the Gates

I'm the lord of Chaos
my hatred is blind, my wrath is insane.
I scream on my throne
from the center of the universe.
I'm Azag-Thoth the Blind God!

Open the Gates

I'm the all in one and one in all.
I dwell in the heart of chaos
and I'm lurking in the threshold of pain.
I'm Yog-Sothoth the ultimate God!

Open the Gates

Now the gates are opened.
Time stood still as waiting for our arrival.
The skies turned to black and the seas painted in red.
We came here from cosmic chaos,
our aim is one, our powers unamable.
Devastate your villages,
your cities and the lands!
Humans will stop existing as a race
and the earth will return to us...
