As the sun slowly fades
And the light begins to dim
When the night conquers day
My world of cruelty is revealed

Behind closed doors and sealed rooms
Your lusts, desires, fears and thoughts
Crawl from your souls like humble worms
Ready to beg my demons

My world, your hell
My lust, your pain
Our world, your hell
An orchestrated torment

My scarlet whores will quench your thirst
My minions will fulfill your greed
The blood of children for your hate
Venoms and poisons for your pain

My world, your hell
My lust, your pain
Our world, your hell
An orchestrated torment

Wombs bearing sin and malevolence
Are waiting for your semen
Treacherous serpents of the mind
Will lead you to your murder

Devilish tongues licking your veins
Taking away your sorrow
A sinister urge to assassinate
Hallucinating power

It's good to know you're satisfied
It's good to know you're happy
Entrapped into my tempting world
The one you know as hell

My world, your hell
My lust, your pain
Our world, your hell
An orchestrated torment
