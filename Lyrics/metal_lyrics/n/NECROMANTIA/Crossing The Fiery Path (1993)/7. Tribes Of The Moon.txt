A tempting blaze
That tears body and soul apart
Spellbound daughters
Devouring the hearts of men
Communion through the ancient circles
Deep in the forest of eternity
The hideous darkness
Centre of the vacant soul of death

Images on images
The universe of Hades
A lethal chant of horror
Whisper of the 9 winds
Lords of nightmares
Cross the blackened skies
As slowly rising
The moon of the undead

Angels' tears upon your tombs
What is dead it cannot die

Masks made of funeral mist
Hiding a frozen laughter
A calling from the undead gods
The breed of the Vampire
Of blood and fire, hate and doom

Necromantia:  
Morbid - bass, vocals
Baron Blood - 8-string bass
Slow Death - backing vocals, howlings, whispers
Inferno - synths, piano
