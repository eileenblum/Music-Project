Dwelling in the infernal domains
Riding the winds of pain
King of the realms of doom
Hiding your wisdom from fool

Wandering in parallel worlds
Revealing your secrets to (the) bold
Time and space are all one
Supreme ruler, deathless one

Sitting on your throne of horrors
Bearer of the darkest light
Feeling compassion for our sorrow
Endless, greatest is your might

Sing the psalms of the abyss
As five angels perish in the sixth
Scream the end of the god of death
With the angels of the path of the left

Reveal to us the ancient
Of dark evolution we're looking for
Inspirer of a new generation
Symbol of alienation

Prince of darkness I call thee
Bestow thy power unto me
Give me all of which I speak
Make me immortal, set me free

Honour to the Lord of the Abyss without
Whose laughter this world should not be

Honour to the Lord of the Abyss without
Whose sign we ourselves should not be

Lord of the Abyss I cry out thy name
Lord of the Abyss give me thy strength
Lord of the Abyss enlighten me
Oh Satan, incarnate through me
