The message is spread around
A new breed of warriors emerged
The fires of war shall burn
The howling of Fenriz will be heard

With blades forged in hatred
And souls baptised in Hell
Bearing the rune of power
Unchaining the wolf

We live the days of Ragnarok
Apocalyptic warfare
We drink the tears of Innocence
And spit your gods of mercy
Like humble dogs you'll lick our feet
Like raging wolves we'll hurt you
By the law of the Talon
We'll reclaim our jewel throne

The time has come, to claim our ground
The fallen one, is standing proud
Spirits of mayhem, sons of wrath
We praise thy name, strengthen our hearts
