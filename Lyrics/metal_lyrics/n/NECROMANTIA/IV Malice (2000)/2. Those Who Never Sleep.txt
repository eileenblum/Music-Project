They've lived a thousand lives
they speak in ancient tongues
like pale hungry phantoms
in our dreams they dwell

I've been to a tall black tower
half of my soul was stolen
they drank with such ferocity
devoured my memories and thoughts

We build churches in their name
we raise temples for their glory
they are our kings, our gods and priests
those who shall never sleep

Mortal, close your eyes and sleep
the Astral lords will guide you
you think you are in paradise
but you are dreaming only hell

[pre-chorus]
They come in dreams, they forge our nightmares
I can see their eyes, shinning in the darkness

[chorus]
Those who never sleep
will steal you dreams, on your soul will feast
Those who never sleep
will engulf you in their horror
