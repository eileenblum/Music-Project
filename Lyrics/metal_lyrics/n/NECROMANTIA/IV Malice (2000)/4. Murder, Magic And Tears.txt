Nine footprints to evil
hooves crack on petrified soil
coming forth from the abyss
lit by bonfires of sin

The quest for the grail of flies
into the black sickness beyond
exterminating angels
where all sanctuary is denied

A female coven in heat
and sexual pandemonium
gave birth to utter blasphemy
igniting an apocalypse

Satyrs reveal themselves
born in the bowels of the beast
and raised with inverted prayers
a beast who is legion

Life flows through fang and claw
our flag is made by sheer rage
by the fangs of the soul-stealer
from the skin of the risen dead

The blood of crow-headed dogs
drips from the face of carnage
and shapes a vile cosmology
of lethal sinful magic
