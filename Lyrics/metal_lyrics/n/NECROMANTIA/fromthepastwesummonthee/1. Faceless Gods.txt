Far away deep, in the deserted lands
Black cities rise, as monuments of hate
The crypts who hide the Ancient ones
Sources of Malice beyond the 7th gate
Kingdom of Darkness, dreaming dead
Faces of Abyss, beyond death
(Our world belongs to them as it was before)
Faceless gods invoking damnation
Usurpers of Throne, Fathers of creation
(One day they will awake and no human will be saved)
Mortals will open the eye of the throne
with the 7 keys of the land of the living
ERESKIGAL will reign at dawn
AZAG-THOTH will scream on his throne
CTHULHU will rise from his sleep
from the seas he was buried deep
Our mother ISHTAR will temporary die
nature will shudder from her nocturnelcry
chaos will swallow the Earth
when the fires will burn again
Human race will be lead to her death
The Ancients will howl their rebirth
