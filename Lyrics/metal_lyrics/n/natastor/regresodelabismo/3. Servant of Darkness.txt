Dark mausoleum without blessing
Cold breath on the marble of the grave
Lament's screams, break the quiet night

Submerged in your world
Nights of eternal solitude
Tears of despair
Run for your face without light
Open the crypt's doors
Hungry of life's nectar
You wanna satiate your appetite
It doesn't care who has to die

You suffer endlessly
You're lost eternally
You never can deserve remission
Of your accursed slavery
Within my mind's humility
You spoke to me
Your kiss would soon resuscitate
The cold cadaver of the vampire

I worship your life
I acknowledge the powers of darkness
And I'm proud of the immortality
'Cause you're the only god that is

I recognize the difference between the worlds of truth and fantasy
I know that my beliefs in tales are fantasy but the magic is real
I realize there ain't heaven as there ain't hell
Now I'm a predatory animal and I love my animal instincts

Master, I'm slave of your pain
Master, listen my pray
My lord, keep me beside you
Master, master
Master

I view death as the destroyer of life.
Therefore I will make the most of life here and now.
I am a vampire.
Bow down before me.
