Beware, beware
What're you doing here?
You're enter a danger zone
To disappear
Living in a toxic world
We have a one way ticket
No escape, no return
Just suffering for our actions

Virus, see your face
Virus, into your veins

We call humanity
Exterminating the rest of the world
To create what we call society
Irony, this is real
To progress we destroy
The things that we have
The future is here
We die everyday

Virus, see your face
Virus, into your veins

To kill species in laboratories of death
How do you can embrace to your chlidren
When you arrive home?

You say it is good for the human race
Trying to hide the only truth
Alway creating biological weapons
Just to kill, kill, kill

Pollution into your mind
We're in a countdown to extinction
Poisoning the air
You're take me to the end
Weak up, look what are you doing
I think there is time to stop
Although you don't care
Overall, just going to die

Virus
You're a virus
