I died too that day
She was so litlle but wiht a big heart
I don't understand what happened
Every time I look at her my lovely girl

She showed me the ligth, straigth up to heaven
I took her hand, nigth after nigth
Exotic blue eyes, ruby red lips
Beautiful skin, take me away

Even the darkest moments, feel like heavens come alive

We walked together, ever she and I
And side by side, two souls become one
Ans I saw she cries, echoes though my mind
When she whispered the words I have to leave you

Why her empty smiles hold what she said?
Only in the dark she came to me
Breathing deep I step inside and fall down
No one can ever take her place

Now my sweet lover baby has flown away
Somewhere I can't follow in the dark where I can't see
Let me be with you tell me you will do
Embrace my soul and melt into each others
I need the seassurance of her arms around
I wanna hear her breathing over my face

She has so beautiful and real
she was my ddady little angel

She didn't has friends and she can't see why
However she sees things that I normally can't
I didn't understand that she was a gift
She wanted someone beside her when she cried

She has so beautiful and real
Givme your inmortal kiss of love

When everything is dark, my soul is empty and alone
I miss her caring I'm daying everyday

Nobody ever is who they say they are
Every one of us hides part of us
For those who understans my words
When an angel dies another one born
