I still feel so much pain
I couldn't say all that I wanted
You were too young to understand
My poor litlle angel
I can remenber you sweet cry, cry

Out into the city's streets
You didn't wanna be alone
And I was waiting for you
This was your destiny
Your touched my soul with your silent love

Just 419, I'm losing my mind
And I fallen behind
I can't find my place, I'm losing my faith
I'm lost inside

Give me all that I want
Wake up now
You know I'm calling u tonite
Your soul is my soul

When I'm alone is good to me
This pain will pass in time
I don't wanna feel more pain

I'm living a lie,
My horizon I can't find
Your poor heart is breaking and now your mind is shaking
The last call was made and nobody is there

I have no reason to live
I don't need anything
You made me what I'm
Rest in peace sweet litlle love
