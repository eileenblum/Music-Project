How many you have to see
To be able to leave?
I can't understand
As it arrive 'til you
Drowning in your misery
Everything believes that's right
Dragging the chains
Of your ruin and desolation

Looking for in empty corners
Something that you can't see
Alone and desperate
Look where you are

You destroy your mind
You contaminate the pure thing that there're in you
To leave your ruin
Falling in an abyss without final

You have to quit it
You have to quit it

You have to quit it

How many you have to see
To be able to leave?
I can't understand
As it arrive 'til you
