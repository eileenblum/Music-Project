Do you remember my dreams?
Do you remember what I said than I going to do?
Just fantasies
Dreams that will never be able to be
My memoirs goes away
My forces abandon me
It's just wasted time
The world rotates without me
I haven't carried out anything
I've been living in a dream
A dream that never end up
Build up hopes creates by my mind
Just to delight me

I'm in a dark room
There ain't road to continue
Living off my memories
Just to survive
The reality becomes nightmare
And I wanna escape
I wanna escape from this world

I wanna live in an eternal dream
I wanna build my own reality
There're clouds in my mind
They don't allow me to see beyond

I live in an extraordinary world
I don't know to differentiate the reality
Of my beautiful nightmare
And I feel that I 'm lost
In that forbidden dream
That doesn't abandon my life

I look the high sky, I try to know
Why all my dreams leave me?, I'm prisoner

I image a fake reality to continue with my life
I wake up and I'm even dreaming and I know that I need to wake up

Yeah

When I sleep I dream that I'm alive
If I close my eyes I'm dead
Everything is lost time
There ain't longer remedy
