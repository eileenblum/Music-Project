That night you seduced my soul
Taking me to that place
Just to see
The crudeness in which
The children of your dark kingdom live
You took me with your look
Without caring that would come
You wise more than nobody
That I wouldnât see another dawn
You came dressed with black satin
With the face covered with pain
You broke up the peace of the alive ones
You donât have pardon for my lament

You dominate
In your kingdom of shades, you donât have an end to stop you
You enjoy
All the suffering, tears strengthen you
They wonât make it
Nobody in this world can escape from you
They will fall
As the cold rain of the sunset

Tender laments fill this hole
Your silent make you mine
Now Iâm part of you

Marbleâs tablets, for those that are rich
Graniteâs tablets, for those that live well
Stoneâs tablets, for those poor in misery
Sandâs tablets, for those who will never cry
