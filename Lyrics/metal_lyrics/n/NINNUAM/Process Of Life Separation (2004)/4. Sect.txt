Million lies now I understand
I am not the son of yours
All my life you have guided me
In a world of faith fucked believers

Paralysed I have always been
Never seen the sermonsâ fake
Now I know, a new way Iâve seen
I am just a chaos breed

I, so blind Iâve walked your path
Endless despising all your lies
So wonderful a life would be if Iâm dead
Pain, with pain Iâm forced believing
Refused my rights to exist
Impose me nothing I do not belong

Reflection of the darkest heart
Visualise my tree of pain
Blinded by your promises
Of a life untroubled and eternal

Isolated surrounding thoughts
In this chamber of religion
No mans cry can repay my loss
All I dream is how you disappear

Now I realize the pain in life is real
The color canât remain, just set me free

Retail my birth in this fucked up world
Soon to bleed Iâll make you suffocate
I wonât rest until you all burn
Burn right next to your icon believes

It is time to go down with me
Nevermore shall I be deceived
Society of the holy one
Forever killed in infernal ways
