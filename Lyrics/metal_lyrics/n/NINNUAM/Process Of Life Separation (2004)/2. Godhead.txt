Godhead, Superior, Deicide, Predator

With greed Iâm pushing the sweetest
Of death through my channels of life
No regrets, no return
I will make my body so golden
Fill me up with aggression and hate
To become mans sickest creation
Obey my thirst, circle my veins
Join my journey to Nederland

I am king of all my senses
Jesus dies, chaos rise
I am God and this is my anthem

I have the power to shape
The end of your life so worthless
Control, judging
My ecstasy makes you to the puppet
Pleading Iâm giving a last breath as your final gift
Creator, Cut-throat
Crown your superior predator

Born to rule your world
Things will change and you will follow
I am the Godhead
Death becomes my bride
To see you dead complete my drug
I am the Godhead

No remorse, merciless, I am your God

Amputate the wings of an angel
And make it fall to the ground
Incomplete, so frustrated
Canât wait until your life are drained
Strength by rivers of wonders
From the head of the needle
Pushing, embracing
I welcome the joy of killing

You are my weakness, you are my life
