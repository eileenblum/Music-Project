Burn me father for I have sinned
Rape me father for all I am
Kill me father for the fake I am
Surround me angels surround me whores

Trade this illusion that I called life
Give me your hell what Iâve deserved
My soul will drown inside your veins
Surround me angels surround me whores

A fallen angel will not return
The fallen one must forever burn
Feed me with your misery
Feel me as you rape my soul

Useless â I am alone
Useless â I stand alone
Useless â I fall alone
Useless â I die alone
