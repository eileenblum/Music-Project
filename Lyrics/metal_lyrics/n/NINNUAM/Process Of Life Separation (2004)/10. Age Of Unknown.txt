Lying here alone again
Waiting for someone to care
If I try to smash the silence
Would anybody hear me then?

One mind so infected
With a soul so purified
My face under water
See me drifting away

You gather around just to see me bleed
My style of death is determined by you
A fake illusion promised new beginning
Is this my end? You broke my wings
Fighting this fire within
On the edge of a life unseen
Kill me just to make me feel
If I am suppose to exist

Tell me is this what Iâve been waiting for?
Where do I go from here?
Escaping pain and return to black
