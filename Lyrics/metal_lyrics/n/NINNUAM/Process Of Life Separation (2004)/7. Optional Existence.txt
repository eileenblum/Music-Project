Realize my eternal wishes
All my hope is vanished and gone
Memories are clouded by sorrows
As I count the marks that stains my skin
End is near as I making my way
All my nightmares are fading away

Farewell to a world so hollow
By wounds I welcome your star shine

Swallow â I am dying
Despise my life â Soon I will fly
Shallow â I am ready
Reclaim my life

Here I am â I am drowning
By my Flesh I will feed my dream
Here I am â I am bleeding
Waste of blood will set me free

Embrace my end with open arms I am giving in

Never been so far away from your world
Never been so close to my dream of life

Slicing my veins wide open
Releasing all Life I am open
Soon to face my selected path
Create a world for my arrival
Shades of grey that is all I which for
Dying with a smile so longing
