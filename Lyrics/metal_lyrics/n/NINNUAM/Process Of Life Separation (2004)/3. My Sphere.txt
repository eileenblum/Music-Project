Blind trust with a mind collapsing
Missing human structure
Became the child of obedience

In my room of fantasy you die a little more
In my room of fantasy I feed my pleasures

Carve my name in pleasure killing
I kiss the triple 6
Purified by the war I seek

I make my own way to your exit
This is the game we play
Watch you bleed you please my needs
This is my game I play

I am not here
I am in my head

Lost world in a fake reality
I obey my inner voices
Escape the weakest part of me

In my world of reality you burn a little more
In my world of reality I create your final screams
