Failed to fit the design of yours
I hide my face
Desperate cries in mind it echoes
Iâve walked the shadow far too long

These four walls keeps closing in
Hidden away, I am the shame of yours
This pain I know is all I have
Eternal damned by discontent

See my wounds that Iâm projecting

You built me up just to break me down
I am so expendable
Invisible presents I stand in silence
No one else wouldnât dare to care

Used and raped in front of a million eyes
I am on display
You are building an empire on godless prayers
Canât you see I am ready to burn?

I am lost with chaos
Do not need your sympathy

Go away, wonât be your breed no more
My way out, Iâve beaten the chains of yours

You stole my youth wonât be ignored no more
Please die for me
Constantly dreaming with dark emotions
Fragments of hell puts the pieces in place

On your knees beg to kiss my feet
Youâre so fucking pitiful
The things you have done wonât heal the wounds
Cut the bounds weâre not connected

See my wounds that Iâm projecting
