Itâs been so many years since the first time I died.
The vultures have been gone for so long
The past starts again
But now itâs all been covered in ash
Dust yourself off and shine your bones cause
Weâve got a long way to go
I am the king of love to hate
You said weâd be together forever
I hope my candor doesnât piss you off
But I wasnât joking
Foreverâs the last word I want to hear come out of your mouth
You are unchanged, why?
And no matter how it looks
Iâm just now realizing they look better awake
Then they ever did asleep
The pieces are bursting together
Iâve been trying for so long to place them
Circles inside squares sparing and spoilingâ¦
And now finally Iâve left
Burning and gasping for life
Youâre drowning, but youâre not, you wonât
You are unchanged, why? Unchanged. How?
This is the only way. Spit out the candles that keep me away from you.
This is not an invitation. This is my plea.
I want to lay down in the trap you set for me
And wait in peace for you
Iâm bleeding from the inside but nothing can protect myself from you
I want to lay down next to you and forget the world
The only people that exist are you and I.
I want to look you in the eyes and count my blessings
You are so much more than just my other half
Iâm telling you right now, Iâd sell my soul for you.
