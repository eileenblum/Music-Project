This is a romance!
This is a fiction, itâs a friend
That we all, we want to take to the grave
But this isnât going to end well
This is a fable
Brought to you before a live studio audience
And it was created by adolescents
Singing âCash that check and check that cash that checkâ
No one says that fear is a liar
But Iâve been told âNo one gets out alive
So trust us with your life
The conclusion of the world is coming!
As soon as we have enough provisions
Plus management is God
And theyâre behind it all
Silence shows nothing but weaknessâ
By now youâve chosen the end
To live in fear is to not live at all
Worry is no form of treatment
You lost the sun to the walls of your bunker
But my love you know that I feel the same way
The only difference that fear is a liar
But at the top no one gets out alive
So trust us with your life
The conclusion of the world is coming!
As soon as we have enough provisions
Plus management is God
And theyâre behind it all
Silence shows nothing but weakness
No one gets away alive!
By now youâve stepped off the edge
This is a ROMANCE!!!!
Darling you know that I feel the same way
