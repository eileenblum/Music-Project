Our friendship has a white flag
Iâll surrender if thatâs what it takes
But Iâll never admit defeat
If thatâs the road then you have the map
You and I mean way less to me than anything
In the isolation of the thoughts and judgments
And whatever happens to be spewing out of your dependency jail
Thereâs a slow dance soiree of trouble and you threw the party
Weâre all doused in gasoline with no fear of flame
Well thereâs a lot of things that can start a fire
I hope youâre satisfied because we all know that itâs the last thing
That Iâll hide and itâs the last that you can expect
No! You make your own damn mistakes!
