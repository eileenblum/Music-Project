Rock N Roll has such a terrible name, who is to blame?
Perching birds drug by a string in the air, stitched together with careless intention.
Cleaner than the dagger that hollowed it out.
Masked and forgotten or no face at all.
Itâs got something or nothing to say.
Yeah donât we all?
A trance and a trust fund stitched at the same time and sold to the hogs.
All eyes on you. Whatever it takes the bottom line is the only one that youâll cross.
Keep selling what they want to hear, arrogant and insincere.
Youâve got something to say, but whatâs the pay? A million before you and more in line.
Iâve seen it a thousand times.
Built to die and dying.
Built to last and lasting.
Go along to get along.
I will not be defiled by the kingsâ meat.
The noise ainât noise anymore, whoâs to blame?
You and I.
