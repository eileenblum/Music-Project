It feels so good up to my skin. One more mile and it
is sinking in. I have tried to make mine a tree. And
not have so much of me. God has stolen my heart. So I
will write it down. I consume myself with invisible
things. Escape. Congratulations. This is my escape. A
pen and book and if the world can see what I got and
then lets all have a good look. A fortunate one.
