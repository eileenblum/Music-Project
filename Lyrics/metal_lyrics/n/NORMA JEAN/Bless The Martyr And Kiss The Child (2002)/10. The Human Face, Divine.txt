It is all done wrong, or so it appears. It is all done right.
Eternal eyes.
I am pressing on, no matter how it looks.
I am pressing on, no matter how it looks.
It is all planned out.

Understatement.

Lay your hands on your mouth.
Negativity.
I don't want to hear it.
Your cursed tongue.
It is all planned out.
Understatement.
This is greater than you (this is greater than you).
This is greater than me.

Flawless.

Increase time and it's all falling into place.
I don't care about surroundings.
I don't care about the way it looks.
I don't care about wicked words.
I don't care about desire.
I don't care because it is a waste of my time.
It is all planned out.

Understatement.

Don't sell out.
It all comes to these words, a battle field inside my mind.
Shall I take her or leave her.
I will set my sites north.
Increase time and it's all fall

I will not curse my tongue.
I will not feed it doubt.
I will not be cursed by doubt or a concubine wife.
