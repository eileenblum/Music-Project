Youâre acting like you donât sympathize with anything at all or anyone for any reason. Youâre desperate to fill the space and that makes me a weight pulling you away. I just made a decision. This condition is only what you made. Its calling out your name. I just want a
reaction from you. Negatives and positives will drift, contained on whispered avenues so run, get out while you can. Break a lot of glass. Leave the place in shambles. Be careful of what you leave behind. You will walk across companies of friends and accumulate all the pieces
that you lost. You have to know, I sympathize with you.
