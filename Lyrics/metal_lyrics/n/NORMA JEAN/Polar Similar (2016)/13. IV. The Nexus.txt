Weâve all heard them all say âIt takes one to know oneâ well small lies are big lies and weâve all told both. The whole world is wounded while you stand around and heal like an angel. You might think all of this sounds so crazy but we want to fall where there are padded
walls. I donât to be inside while the walls are closing in. if you want to make this all work then youâre gonna have to try. One word said softly and perseverant is the twin of an outright speech but lies travel faster than the truth is said.


Thanks to progressiveforces for sending track #1 lyrics.
