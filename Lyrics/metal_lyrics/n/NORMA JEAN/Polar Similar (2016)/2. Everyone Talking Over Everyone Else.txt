Sit and listen to the voices fade and sing again. Give them space to destroy it all and build again. Fill the space with the lies you shed and start again. Every sorrow, every misery can and will be brought to life if you put it in a story or a lie. Every sentence that you
recognize. Every word of every kind but I was waking up, I was strong enough. Every influential interview. I was in between the lies. But I was waking up, I am stronger now. Every picture, every photograph, I was disappearing lines but I was showing up in the center of life.
Every motion, every point of view: I was always giving up but I have woken up every time of day.
