Someone take me down to the river and leave no trail for which to return. Let the muddy water fill my lungs. The invincibility of our youth has just given way to the inevitability of our death and I hope it does. So donât raise your glass. Redemption wears a red dress but
carries a white flag. Iâll wear that red dress for you. The song on the wind is a desperate manâs hymn and death is a living partner. A consummate, consummate one.
