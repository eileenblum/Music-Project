You said love nothing and nothing that you love can be used against you, but if youâre trying to save me then youâll have to try harder. The sound is an infinite saint that brings me to its knees. To find my way through space, hurtling like a comet. To find my way through
space. Hey, youâve fallen on your dreams. Theyâre running like a river and sounding like a stream. We save for opposite ears. It doesnât matter what we say. Only diminished and divorced do we learn to what extent we can love. What has to, does.
