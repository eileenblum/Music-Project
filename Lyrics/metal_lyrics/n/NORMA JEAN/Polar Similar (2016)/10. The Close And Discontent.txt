We donât need to hash out anything when your friendship death toll says it all. It swims like a shark cutting through blood inked waters, safe from sight. Clouded in blood and seeking a leg to sink its teeth into. So sorry to tell you Iâm leaving this sea never to return, and
all of this time Iâm just trying to tell you this one thing. Donât bring me into this. Please donât bring me into this. I wish you well.
