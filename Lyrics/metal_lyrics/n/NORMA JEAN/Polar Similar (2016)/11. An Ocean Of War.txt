This is a break up scene. Youâre living like a cinematic dream. Just give me a chance to say everything. Youâre not thinking it through at all. Like you ever saw it coming. This is not an opening. So just give me a chance to say, we never saw us coming. If you wanted to leave
me, all you had to do was ask. If I want to be the guesser of you. If you say youâre my darling Iâm gonna throw up and die, if I want to be the guesser of me. Everything is under control. Does it hurt you to know that it does not hurt me at all?
