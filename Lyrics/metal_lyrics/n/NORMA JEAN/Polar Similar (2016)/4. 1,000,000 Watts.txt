If you want to speak to the devil, you will feel the wave of his or her invented wings. We see the shadow of the axe before it falls on the necks of the sheep, but if the light has a secret shade, I am the lamb that has become the wolf. One million watts because Iâm feeling
alive but youâre broken on the inside baby and that will never have the final say. I feel bad that youâre angry, but Iâm sorry. I donât care for what itâs worth and if it ever comes down to me or you, youâre probably going to die. So take yourself outside and be along to
mediate with a cigarette. Words of war become acts of war! Iâm not fucking around.
