I am just a sensory of what Iâve said and done. This is what I tell myself to pacify the room. âI suppose living like this is good to?â Iâm taking what youâre giving but the giving takes away. Is that what you came for? I should really go backwards like you do. If I wanted to
start over again but I donât want to be like you, like you do. I donât want to embrace my ghosts again. Once, twice and every desperate time. So you want to live. So you wanted to die. It that what you came for? Try not to fall into the dark again. Try.
