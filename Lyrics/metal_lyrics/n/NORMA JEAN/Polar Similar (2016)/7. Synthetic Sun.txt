Are you feeling alive? Pace yourself before you run straight into yourself. You sleep in fragmented glass with reflections of you, but are you feeling alive? I hope the dead brings the dead and they march across our beds. Iâve done it before and I rode the horse of death. So
ride the horse of death! But let me ask you, are you feeling alive? If the light doesnât come outside.
