Astounding! Let us consider our current state
A string of events and I tied the first knot
YouÂ´re an anchor and I won't be drug down
Because no matter what

Burn this to ashes
Ashes and framework

A dying man needs to die, as a tired man needs to sleep
And there comes a time when it is wrong, as well as useless, to resist

Burn this to ashes
Ashes and framework

You are forgiven
But this just does not mean that what was done is okay
Trust is destroyed for you and me
What's done is done and this will never be right
The sun has gone dry
So we can sleep forever

You can be free to turn your back
I'm not holding a gun

Trust has been destroyed for you and me
What's done is done and this will never be right

The sun has gone dry
So we can sleep forever

Burn this to ashes
Ashes and framework

Trust has been destroyed for you and me
What's done is done and this will never be right

The sun has gone dry
So we can sleep forever

Trust has been destroyed for you and me
What's done is done and this will never be right

The sun has gone dry
So we can sleep forever

And I've been so bitter towards you
And I've been so bitter

I've been so bitter towards you
