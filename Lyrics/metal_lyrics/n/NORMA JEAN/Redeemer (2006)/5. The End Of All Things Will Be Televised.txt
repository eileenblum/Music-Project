All we know will be folded. A day of clouds. Creation waitsâ¦

Get away blue collar instrument
Get away politicians and priests
Refined to consume
It will be laid down
On the necks of the pure
The proud and the damned

Your day will come
Turn the page, embrace your
Comforting company
The sun beats down on your
Comforting company
Everything is burning because

Tonight the south is on fire!
The south is on fire.

Creation waits in eager expectation. Anxious. Patient.
Heaven will pause.

Get away blue collar instrument
Get away politicians and priests
Refined to consume
It will be laid down
On the necks of the pure
The proud and theâ¦
Comforting company
The sun beats down on your
Comforting company
Everything is burning from your
Comforting company
The sun beats down on your
Comforting company
The seas are boiling

Out comes the light
Awake and rehearse

Out comes the demons
I never saw you
Out comes the mercy
Shutting down hell
Bite down until it bleeds
Out comes the exit

All things complete
O infamous city, full of turmoil, I'm terrified at your collapse
The kings, they shudder with horror, their faces distorted with fear
Endless empires gently brushed away in the blink of an eye
All Creation, wilted.

Captain, the ship is sinking. Have mercy.
