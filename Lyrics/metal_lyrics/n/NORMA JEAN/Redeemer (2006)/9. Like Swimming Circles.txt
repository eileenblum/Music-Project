I don't care what you said
I won't sink in the flood
But I listen to every noise
That you make and make sense of what you say
And I take note to every sound

We're not the same again

Don't you dare insinuate me

You don't care what you create
You can't swim in this flood
And you'll swallow with every wave
That comes by and take, take what you need
You'll still swallow with every tide

We're not the same again

Don't you dare insinuate me

To hell with that!
