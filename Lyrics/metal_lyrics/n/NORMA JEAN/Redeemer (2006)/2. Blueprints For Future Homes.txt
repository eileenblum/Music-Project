Like miracles like
Clockwork and like miracles,
You witnessed halos, but you failed to see its horns.

The illusion of intelligence, a continuous sounding bell.
And can feel the interruption in the air?
Can you feel the static?
I've never seen you like this, seen you.

Yeah, well that's what I said.
Drive, drive your vultures home.
You're killing me.
Just Bury me.
Yeah, Well that's what I said.
And I said exactly what I meant.
You're killing me.
Just Bury Me.

Holy ghosts and talk show hosts.
How I panic as you fail.
Your conscience is a wolf.
Walls are being built, deception wears its veil.
Her charm is fleeting but her love just will not last.
Far from men you hang and sway with no defender.
Pushed around by the noise of this carefree crowd.
Her charm is fleeting but her love just will not last.

I will not sleep while you are throwing anchors to a drowning generation.

Yeah, well that's what I said.
Drive drive your vultures home.
You're killing me.
Just bury me.
Yeah, well that's what I said.
I said exactly what I meant.
You're killing me.
Just bury me.

Yeah, well that's what I said [x4]

Hell is empty, the devils are here. [x2]

I will never sleep.
