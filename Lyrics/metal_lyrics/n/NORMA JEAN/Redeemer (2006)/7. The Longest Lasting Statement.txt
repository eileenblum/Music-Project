Will the body be abandoned? Will it?
Improvement is no redemption.
Unbelief is no diversion.
Drenched in blood, soaked in grace
Take this body.

A sound that has no sight.
2,000 years,
2,000 years until they crash never begging for return.

I was stabbed through the neck.
You will take this body, you will take this there (for the land)
There is not a separation.
You will take this body, you will take this there.
We will... we will... we'll run straight to the murder.
We'll run... we'll run straight to the murder.
