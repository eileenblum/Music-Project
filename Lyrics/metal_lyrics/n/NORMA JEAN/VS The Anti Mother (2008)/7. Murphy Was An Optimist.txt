Light that fuse, back up three steps
And bite down on that bullet.
You've been doing this
Way too long and it can't be fixed.

Don't worry
So pull up that chair
And suck down that trouble
Misery is the fuel
That keeps this broken down
Lifeless instrument running

I'm sinking in cursory
And I'm sinking headfirst

Clear your dusty throat and taste that stiletto
Can you taste that metal?
Don't worry it can't be fixed.
Don't worry it can't be fixed
So don't worry

Light that fuse, back up three steps
And sink without a trace

I'm sinking in cursory
And I'm sinking headfirst

Hold me down till I stop crying.
I don't want to feel this anymore
Hold you down cause you're not trying.
I don't want to feel this anymore

Hold me down till I stop crying.
I don't want to feel this anymore
Hold you down cause you're not trying.
I don't want to kill you anymore.

Is this what you were designed for?
Did you think you had it coming?
Hell follows with you

I'm sinking in cursory
And I'm sinking headfirst

Is this what you were designed for?
Did you think you had it coming?
Hell follows with you
