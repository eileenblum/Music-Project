Carry your flags, march into that fictional cause
And show off that medal
Just don't reach for that gun
Reach for that gun
Carry that banner, build that heart out of stone
Just don't reach for that gun
You scaled the high horse and I felt the change
I know the difference between you and me
You scaled the high horse and I felt the change
I know the difference between you and me
You and me

You cleaned the outside of your chalice
But it's filled with robbery and self indulgence
Just like the rest of us

You wear that cross like a crown.
You wear that cross like a dagger
You wear that cross like a crown.
You wear that cross like a dagger

Oh my god, take this sword from my mouth
You scaled the high horse and I felt the change
I know the difference between you and me

Come down from that tower
Come down from that tower

Nothing will be the outcome.
Nothing is the outcome
