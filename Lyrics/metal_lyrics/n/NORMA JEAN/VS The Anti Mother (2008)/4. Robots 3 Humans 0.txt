Open that door: I'll follow you into that space
Where nothing is regretted then forgotten
Where is that grace that carries me out?
So strange, it's mine, it's closed and locked

And if you open that door
It won't be yesterday when
Before the days of collapsing
And I'll stand through all these lines
Just to make it back to you

Can you help me every step of the way?
We can bury that battle and bury the cause
There is nothing that I can say
Because I was wrong this time

Everyone knows cause they see the glare in our eyes
Careful now, don't drown yourself in sorrow
I was the one that built that cross and weighed you down
And now I'll carry on till it's over and it's over

And if you open that door
It won't be yesterday when
Before the days of collapsing
And I'll stand through all these lines
Just to make it back to you

Can you help me every step of the way?
We can bury that battle and bury the cause
There is nothing that I can say
Because I was wrong this time

Yesterday when
Before the days of collapsing
And I'll stand through all these lines
Just to make it back to you

Can you help me every step of the way?
We can bury that battle and bury the cause
There is nothing that I can say
Because I was wrong this time
