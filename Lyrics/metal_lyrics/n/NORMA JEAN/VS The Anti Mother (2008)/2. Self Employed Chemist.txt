It's like you know the words
But you can't hear the music
You've lived a lie for so long
Now you believe it
You're shooting silver bullets
And taking magic pills

I'm asking you, do you know a way to delete my conscience?
Don't put your ear to the floor to hear the sound of the future
Yours is a history shaped by disaster
We're coming back for you
You better brace yourself

I'm telling you
We're coming back
To collect that killer
Who killed me and threw me away
Am I holding you up
Or you holding me down?

You killed me and threw me away
Am I holding you up
Or you holding me down?

We make the same mistakes
We always count them
I want to fail you so badly.

I'm telling you
We're coming back
To collect that killer
Who killed me and threw me away
Am I holding you up
Or you holding me down?

You killed me and threw me away
Am I holding you up
Or you holding me down?

What if I have to lose?
What if I have to suffer?
So what if I have to lose?
So what if I have to suffer?

You killed me and threw me away
Am I holding you up
Or you holding me down?
