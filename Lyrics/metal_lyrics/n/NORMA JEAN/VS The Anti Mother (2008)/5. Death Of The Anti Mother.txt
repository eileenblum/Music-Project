I hope you burn forever
There will be no other way
No more suffering
No more trust will be lost
No more wounded
No more blood will be shed
Just know, I mean to harm you
I want to see you choking
And kicking in your own blood
We all have our own person hells
I just hope yours burns brighter
Deception has been your right hand
Confusing the sight of my left
You won't leave the way you came
And now no more blood will be shed

We will burn for this
We will both of us burn
