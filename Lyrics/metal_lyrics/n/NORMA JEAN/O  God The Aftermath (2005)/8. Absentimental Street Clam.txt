Curses of black halos.

Go, run your mouth,
Open mouth.
Run your open mouth.
Close your open mouth.
Sun blacks out, sky blacks out
Don't plan on sitting under the falling sky.
You're so pointless to fall.

Please believe what you see,
And what you hear, not what you love.
Caught by the dove, caught by the dog

Your names are indications in red blood
And I'm choking on my tongue.
