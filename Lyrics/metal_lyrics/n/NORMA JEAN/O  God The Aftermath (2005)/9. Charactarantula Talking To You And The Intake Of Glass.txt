I will speak careful formulations of defense, these wary methods.
Words with no echo, this is an unfair architecture,
And my fists surrender to life emotion.

Canceling each other's experience with the intimidating sound of our voices.
Truth is the method of defense.
Places rise out from our fiery blaze of words.
They make monuments and we make no progress.
We could build a mansion with our million dollar words.

Canceling each other's experience with the intimidating sound of our voices.
Truth is the method of defense.
Save us of our voices.
Truth is the method of defense.
Places rise out from our fiery blaze of words, our blurs of words.
We could build a mansion, our million dollar words.

Celebrate but what about the bride
Separate the widow from the bride.
In this part of my story I am the one who dies...
The only one.
