We walked on glass all day long, with eyes rolled back
It came with smiles, it came with gestures, and it came with motives.
Investing flowers in one hand and a blade in the other
This is between me and this blade, and my heart. This is between
Eyes rolled back roll
Eyes rolled back look rolled back
Distributing rusty knives in these countless attractive letters
With a directional diagram of a guilty, a guilty heart.
"Insert knife here"

This is between me and this blade, and my heart. I'm lying here.
This is between me and this blade, and my eyes.

Lack of thought on this has attested catastrophic
Come one, come all, introduce knife to heart.
Introduced knife to your hearts
With our eyes rolled back.
