No one! We're all gone. We don't care, no one seems to care.
The mirror of our mouths endlessly yelling
May I have your attention, attention, attention
This is a quote from our new weapons,
"This fight is more important than your life."
No destruction. War's constructive. No!
The world waking, wearing. Leaving
No one left to concern a sound in darkness.
Second light, we will fight for the king. Desperation.
No! Destruction. Word's destructive.
Everyone stay calm, we're taking over this ship
With our lives, with our hearts, with our hands out
To this God forsaken town.

We will not know mercy.
