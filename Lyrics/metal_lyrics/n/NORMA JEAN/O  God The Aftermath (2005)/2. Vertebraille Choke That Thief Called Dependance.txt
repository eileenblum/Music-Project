You, like death never content
Starve the old and feed the new
It's all your fault
Yeah, it's all your fault
Worth it, not one time. Have I forgotten her
It's all your fault
Yeah, it's all your fault

I have been sold into slavery. Savory, wrong
I try to drown in my sorrow but the sorrow sorrow swims well.
It's all your fault. Your fault
Lust for complete nothing that lusts for more nothing.
Motion without meaning, meaning
Action without bullshit function.
Nothing will breed nothing.
It's all your fault. It's all
Why can't you brace yourself
And why can't you break your cell
