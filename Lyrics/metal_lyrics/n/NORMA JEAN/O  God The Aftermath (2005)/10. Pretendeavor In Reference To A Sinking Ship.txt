Oh my god, hand us down our ribbons,
You death defier you.
Far from fear, we are adrift, gone.

After the fallout, after a million miles.
Adrift is the reason for the rain and we're at the undertow.
So stop dancing around, in stories untold
The mind has conquered the whole heart, the whole life.
Sewing the insecure thread, reason.
I'll burn, what it takes to,
What it takes burn, what it takes drown.
We're going down with the ship. Worth the chef,
Worth the burn, what it takes to,
What it takes burn, what it takes drown.
We're going down with the ship.
I burned 41 hills for the lifeboat, academic ability
That exceeds the love of searching for the truth.

After the fallout, after a million miles.
Adrift is the reason for the rain.
Rain covering all except my head,
Covering all of me except my song.
