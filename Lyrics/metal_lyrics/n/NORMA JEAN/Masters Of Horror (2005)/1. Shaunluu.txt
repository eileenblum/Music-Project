Abundant or broke
The elect and the mute
All will slip away, the billions...
Like thieves through windows
It leaves their branches white
All breathe, be breathless
To quit this mortal frame, We're not safe.
Even lovers are asleep
Both deceived and deceiver are His.
This is victory, from all these years
Bowing in front of queens.
Have gun, will travel
Safe.
