This is pain draped in excellence, and there's no way to bury it.
I awake resolute and numb, climbing 15 stories just to fall asleep at the edge, and I'm praying for a sleepless night.
And how does this darkness always find me?
This is the time for you to leave in peace or stay and die.

We're crashing down and burning out with every word you say.
We're burning through the atmosphere and we hope...
we hope you never find us... we hope you never find us anywhere.

We're crashing down and burning out with every word you say.
We're burning through the atmosphere and we hope...
we hope you never find us... we hope you never find us.

I have nothing left but to let you lay there and die for it.
So just give up and write it down.
If you're paying for it, yeah, you might as well wager it.

We're crashing down and burning out with every word you say.
We're burning through the atmosphere and we hope...
we hope you never find us... we hope you never find us anywhere.

We're crashing down and burning out with every word you say.
We're burning through the atmosphere and we hope...
we hope you never find us... we hope you never... No...

We hope you never find us, cover your shallow grave.
We hope you never find us, cover your shallow grave. We hope you never...

...anywhere.
We're crashing down and burning out with every word you say.
We're burning through the atmosphere and we...
we hope you never find us... we hope you never find us anywhere.

We're crashing down and burning out with every word you say.
We're burning through the atmosphere and we hope... we hope you never find us...
we hope you never find us anywhere... anywhere... anywhere...
and we hope... we hope you never find us... we hope you never find us.
