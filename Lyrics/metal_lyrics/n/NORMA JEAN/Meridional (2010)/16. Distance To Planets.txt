[Bonus Track]You're burning like a sun and it's safe to say that I can't look away.
These lights are calling out my name
And I want nothing more than to attach attach attach, then try and get away.

Can't we get in over our heads?
Can't I just try and breathe?
Can't we drive in the wrong direction?
Can't we erase this map and always stay away?

Dig around and rid this place of distractions
And we will wash our hands clean until it's over.
I'll clear away the miles and drain the sea,
Then jump on the next dragon to the center of nowhere and consume you.

Can't we get in over our heads?
Can't I just try and breathe?
Can't we drive in the wrong direction?
Can't we erase this map and always stay away?

Can't I just try and breathe?

Can't we get in over our heads?
Can't I just try and breathe?
Can't we drive in the wrong direction?
Can't we erase this map and always stay away?
