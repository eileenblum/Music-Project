You have never taken any inspiration in a direction that won't end up with the death of you.
Do you really think all the saints are just lying... just lying...  just lying in their graves?

Where are we supposed to go? I want you to remember this.
Just because I understand, doesn't mean I really care.

Have you become smarter than your own father?
Are you ready to lead with no lesson?
Your death will bring you all the answers that you've been looking for.
How does it feel to kill?

Where are we supposed to go?
I want you to remember this.
Just because I understand, doesn't really mean I care.

The fruit has been tasted and their blood is on your hands.
You won't know the truth soon enough my friend.
Did you think that ended it? Do you really think it's over?
You will have all of the answers soon enough my friend.
You're standing near the edge.

Falling from the sky, day one. You never learned to fly.
Falling into the ocean, day seven. You never learned to swim.
Sinking to the bottom of the ocean, day twenty. How could you see the bottom?
Sinking to the bottom of the ocean, day one hundred... day one hundred... day one hundred.

Why canât you see the bottom? Why canât you see the bottom?
Why canât you see?
Why canât you see the bottom? Why canât you see the bottom?
Why canât you see? Why canât you see?

Why canât you see? Why canât you see? Why canât you see?
Why canât you see? Why canât you see?
