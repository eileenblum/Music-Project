Yeah...
And I sat through a thousand suns, much sooner than you arrived, and I know what you're thinking:
"Just pull the ripcord and let's descend."

You put your parachutes on parade and you left the pilots on the ground,
but if you're calling me in, then you better believe I'm gonna call you out.

If you're calling me in, I'm gonna call you out.

Who knows the cost and what may escape you and I,
'cause it's a long way down from here.
I have a feeling that we won't be landing soon.

Parachutes on parade and you left the pilots on the ground,
but if you're calling me in, then you better believe I'm gonna call you out.

We're standing at these doors, whether cowards or conquerors.
They make no promises, they just provide an opening.
And your speech is a thunderous noise, and my ears are catching a dreadful static.

You put your parachutes on parade and you left the pilots on the ground,
but if you're calling me in, then you better believe I'm gonna call you out...
out... out... out... out... out.. out.

Yeah... If you're calling me in, I'm gonna call you out.
