It's been years of waiting here for you (you) and I'm not waiting anymore here for you (you), here they burn for murder.
So now I want to see the world burn in flames (flames), and I'll light the match, till you respect me... till you respect me... until you respect me.
Burn... for...

It's been years of waiting here for you (you) and I'm not waiting anymore here for you (you), 'cause here they burn for murder.
So now I want to see the world burn in flames (flames), and I'll light the match, till you respect me... till you respect me... till you respect me... till you respect me.

Fiction is me and I'm my own apathy.
I have done nothing with my pistols.
They say it just takes a second to die, but I was set up to be knocked down.
Well, it's all over now.

Somewhere a violin plays as I watch this ship capsize.
But I am a long mean streak of independence, and between you and I, there's no difference... no difference... no difference... there's no difference.
