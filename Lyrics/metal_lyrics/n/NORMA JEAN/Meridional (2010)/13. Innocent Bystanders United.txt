These tears are carving trenches in my skin.
Put down the microscope, rip off my scales and take a look inside,
'cause I feel like... like Jesus don't... don't come around much more these days.

Skeletons are falling out through every fracture.
Look away, look away. There's nothing to see here.

Lies and mistakes all know me by my name, and...
and now they refuse to leave me alone, haunting me with their mutiny.

But there's no future in... in being a dinosaur, and...
and there's no future in the way I have been living.
But there's a hell of a past, so pull up a chair and I'll give you a good story,
because I know you're not attracted to the truth.

Skeletons are falling out through every fracture.
Look away, look away. There's nothing to see here.
Skeletons are falling out through every fracture.
Look away, look away. There's nothing to see here.

There's a hell of a past, so pull up a chair and I'll give you a good story.
