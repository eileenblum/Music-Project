[Bonus Track]I don't believe you can be troubled.
Another day, another customer paying for it.
I'll swallow every knife on this table.
Another day, another year with you would shake the ground in the sea.

Scarcity of lust, heartlessness prevails.
I guess we'll kill more presidents!
We'll need their faces for all the cash we'll get from selling our family.

Where are you now?
We've waited so long and our hearts will never be the same...
Our hearts never will be the same.
Remember, it's a buyer's market when you sell your soul, sell your soul.

Scarcity of lust, heartlessness prevails.
I guess we'll kill more presidents!
We'll need their faces for all the cash we'll get from selling our family.

Where are you now?
We've waited so long and our hearts will never be the same...
Our hearts never will be the same.

Our hearts will never... hearts will never... hearts will never... hearts will never....

Scarcity of lust, heartlessness prevails.
I guess we'll kill more presidents!
We'll need their faces for all the cash we'll get from selling our family.

Where are you now? (Where are you now?)
We've waited so long and our hearts will never be the same...
Our hearts never will be the same.
Where are you now?
We've waited so long and our hearts will never be the same...
Our hearts never will be the same...
The same...
The same...
