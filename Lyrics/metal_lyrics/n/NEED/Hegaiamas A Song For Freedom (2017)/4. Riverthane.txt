We build these thorns round our heads
And we hold on tight to our kingdoms
Deep in solitude we do confide
And now apathy becomes our god

Endless nights that lead to endless mornings
Filled with words from poets of the fall
Even though the water gave its warning
We were blind to heed the call

A cry for mercy from the bottom of a burning, bleeding heart
And who would know this, where we turn to in a time we yearn for change
A cry for freedom from the cruelty of this world weâre sinking in
And who will tell us where the hell we go from here

We live estranged from our brothers
Because all is mine and mine is all
Now the battle rages on and will go on forever
Until thereâs nothing more to die and there is nowhere else to go

Darkest skies that lead to darker mornings
And thereâs no one there to stop the fall
Who can see the light in years of scorning
Who erased the writings hammered on the wall

A cry for mercy from the bottom of a burning, bleeding heart
And who would know this, where we turn to in a time we yearn for change
A cry for freedom from the cruelty of this world weâre sinking in
And who will tell us where the hell we go from here

I canât recall those words that lead to nothing
These times when we feel small
In tears the answers flow

Moments wasted in anticipation of a brighter future that will never dawn
Still it echoes in me, loud as can be
The only truth that
Alone we stand and fall
Cause no one heard the call
