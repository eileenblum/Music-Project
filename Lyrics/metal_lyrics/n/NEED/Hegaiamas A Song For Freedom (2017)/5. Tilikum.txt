A lonely natureâs cry, a silent warning
A bloodless murder right before my eyes
With no one asking why we bleed for the fallen
The noise of guilt is echoing inside

Why did we come down to this?
Deaf, blind, sedated
How is failure now the norm
We should all be locked away left isolated
Now humanity has failed
We all have failed

I will destroy this mortal flesh that stands before me
I will avenge the years of suffering
Grey, the shade of light when you stand near me
Black is all thatâs left when I am gone

Why destruction is the core of our existence
How canât we all understand the way it ends from here
Hate has broken us inside with no resistance
Hopeâs been proven nothing more than notions obsolete

And still the noise of guilt it echoes

I will destroy this mortal flesh that stands before me
I will avenge the years of suffering
Grey, the shade of light when you stand near me
Black is all thatâs left when I am gone

I will destroy (I will destroy)
I will avenge (I will avenge the years)
Grey be the light (the years of pain and)
black all youâll see forever
