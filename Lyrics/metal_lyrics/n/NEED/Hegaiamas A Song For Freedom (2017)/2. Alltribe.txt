I woke up inside an unspoiled land
The air was clear, I stared into the sun
And I felt free

Had a dream of when it all began
Blackness all around me, stars like little grains of sand
It felt so real

Like coming home

We're flowing under the tides of starlit skies
We're glowing under a light that keeps on pulling us to the ground
In space and time we're floating and what we found
A land where we're all one.

And keeps on pulling us to the ground
In space and time we're floating and what we found
A land where we're all.

You were there
We're lying side by side
Trued to hold my breath and take it all inside 
So much to grasp
So much to learn

Felt the world was pumping in my chest
Like I'm giving birth to all that is and all that ever was
I saw it clear
I saw it all

We're flowing under the tides of starlit skies
A light keeps spinning so near and yet so far

Far beyond the past we left behind
There lies a distant field where light will shine so bright
Waiting for us to arrive

We're flowing under the tides of starlit skies
We're glowing under a light that keeps on pulling us to the ground
In space and time we're floating and what we found
A land where we're all one.
A land where we're all one.

All is one is all is one is
