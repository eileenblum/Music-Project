Try to breathe under the water
Try to live under no sky
Breathe the ashes, smoke and cinder
Bow to hegaiamas

The kings of old, they bleed through my skin
Bleed through space and time gone cold
A crown of stillness burning through the aftermath

Designed to suffer in silence, is this the life that youâre asking for?
Our voices caught in the distance
Bleeding, screaming, cynical
All I can see through this madness
In desperation forevermore
A warning call for resistance
Hoping, crying, take me home

I can feel it haunting me, I can feel it haunting me

In darkness we bleed the fear of loneliness and what is yet to be
In dreaming we see that from a window to a distant memory we fly

Weâve been trying to live in peace
Beyond this blue horizon
All I ever tried to build
A kingdom for our souls to dream

And yet we suffer in silence, itâs not the life we were asking for
Our voices lost in the distance
Bleeding, screaming, cynical
Weâre living trapped in this madness
In desperation forevermore
And now we long for resistance
Hoping, falling but still

In darkness we bleed the fear of loneliness and what is yet to be
In dreaming we see that from a window to a distant memory we fly

In the darkest corners of my mind
There lie the shadows that keep pulling me inside
And I can see them every time I close my eyes
The lights won't open and their voices keep on calling me
Haunting me
I can feel them haunting me forever

Rememory

In darkness we bleed the fear of loneliness and what is yet to be
In dreaming we see that from a window of a distant memory we fly
