We want to live in your head
We want to see freedom dead
You canât decide on your own
Thereâs no one there youâre alone

Dreams burst in my eyes
Time explodes
Life is passing by
Blow by blow

They keep calling calling in my skin theyâre crawling
Little people preaching from their pulpits all made of lies
No escape and no release
Now this void of nothingness wants me

No, donât scream in my head
Your voice is killing me
Leeches feed on my brain
Take your rotten filthy show
Canât take it anymore
Just set me free

Lost this fight so long ago
Long before I opened up my eyes
No one told me when the lines were drawn
Yet no one contemplated our demise

Nothing more feel I pumping in my veins
Left alone
Will you ever get away from me
Who am I just a number in your fucking game
Lost in time, I hate everything you stand for

They keep calling calling in my skin theyâre crawling
Little people preaching from their pulpits all made of lies
No escape and no release
Now this void of nothingness wants me

No, they keep crawling in my skin
No, they keep haunting me forever
This void of nothingness just pulls me in
Thereâs no escape, thereâs no escape for me
