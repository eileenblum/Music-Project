I wonder if itâs true what they say
in the books of Job for the dead
rotten flesh, so whatâs next? Elysium is it there?
Or is it all just a deceit?

am I damned? Will I ever be able to go
back where I came from?
tell me someone is it meant to be so cruel now?
solemn thoughts are misused

at last it falls, the grey curtain for my soul
and I feel that Iâve been deceived
the light of my life is dim
full of lies that will make me bleed

the last time I cried
for innocence unspoiled
I felt that she had to die

dancing lights in my head driving me insane
donât tell me what I should believe
drawn before me the sins that haunt me
a naughty parade of guilt

it was a boring day like the others
when my body was stripped of my soul
the flesh was sore and the mind was twisted
when they decided that I should pay the toll
as I walk through these forsaken lands
where soulless people are sold
all I have is in my empty hands
and Iâm left all alone and cold
I wonder if thereâs a god or a demon devoid of faith
to tell me what did I do to join the denmad?
