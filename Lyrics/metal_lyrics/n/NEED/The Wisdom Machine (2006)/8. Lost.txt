trampling on my dreams
as they die before my eyes
I âm stumbling on myself

I dreamt of choice
I dreamt of your voice
calling me as I fell from grace

youâre leaving me
youâre bleeding me again
deceived like Iâm no-one
in silent waves I crawl

sick and tired of all the silence
come breathe desire into my empty lungs
how I long to feel
devoured and wasted from all this hatred
my rain keeps falling from heaven down to earth

the wheel is spinning fast
my spirit crumbles in its last
twitch before itâs all turned blue

no magic carpets here
to make the longing disappear
no tears are shed for those who kiss the rain
