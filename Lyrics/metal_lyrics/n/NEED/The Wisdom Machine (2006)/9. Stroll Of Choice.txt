the open path is cold chilling my spine
I reek of life
if god already died, what am I to do?
I understand

raped my mind, still I choose blind

narrow paths are merging
show me how to reach the patternâs end

patterns upon the wind, did you leave us?
floating oblivion, they mean nothing

the price of ignorance I have to pay now
the choice is hard
patternâs changing fast my life is fading
donât read the lines

useless lives are sold
a universal stroll
