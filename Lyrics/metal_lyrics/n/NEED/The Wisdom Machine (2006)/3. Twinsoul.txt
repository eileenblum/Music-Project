two-fold puppets stand in line
sentient gnomes with forfeit lives
ripped away from illusions of choice
pitch-forked demons with a muted voice

it is the moment of truth
now that my soul is divided
spitting on my wounds to try and feed
my crimson beast with shards of light

itâs like chasing the patterns of the blue waterfall
when all of your dreams should be painted red
servitor, monochromatic race

two times blessed and two times cursed
living the details of someoneâs dream
two times dead and two times tricked
born again with both parts sick

faith, to divide the systems of god
to dismantle his three-folded case
embrace both darkness and light
nature and wisdom alike

keep on, stand up and struggle
shatter the shadows

thoughts die inside
neuron feelings
orgasmic psychotron

I am happy
I am sad
I am withered
chained behind
bathed in darkness
choked on light
far from heaven
hell inside
