wings, I feel wings
like the semen of god on my face
here is the proof of his love in my life
stuck like a whore in his brothel of light

bio-constellations of chastity in white
they saturate my voice to influence my choice
enigmatic shards of a crystallized sky
they gave me every reason for feeling blue

faith, I lose faith
to the empty remains of the cross
now I am chained to this circus of death in vain
praying to the emptiness for a mockery of pain

cursed be ye for sowing all this dying
your prophecies will burn for all their lying
oblivion still reigns upon your chosen
itâs sad to see them run to meet the fallen

theyâre still bleeding from your killing
