a fading moment of nothingness
and Iâm drowned in your pool of wonders
deaf machines stripping me naked
sucking the juice right from my soul

dreaming of wine and blood
spearing my soul to quench the truth
now Iâm torn
all these lies godly shame
now I see that you tricked us all
nothing left but fucked up pain
listen Lord thy kingdom sucks

finished up with a sack of guilt
nothing to show for but empty deeds
is it the end or am I just turning?
into a monster possessed by yearning?

you trashed my body
ruined my temple
now itâs just a worn-out dress
give me back my voice so I can scream again
