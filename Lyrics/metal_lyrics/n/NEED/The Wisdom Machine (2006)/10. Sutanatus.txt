breathe with your heart, sink in the cyan waves
now face the truth, god is an imbecile
slow beating thoughts carry my eyes
as they drift from today, flying to no-whereâs end

hurry, shadows are building aloud
carry my life in your eye, drink from my dirth

touch the end, just to begin again
suffer the hand, light of redemptionâs sand
crimson helloâs, joy of a babyâs cry
bearing a hope, enough to project a smile

now I walk, now I see all the answers in your eyes
human Iâve become, naked I am born
bound to face the horrors of the world
I âm alive, Iâm alive
Iâm alone, Iâm alone
