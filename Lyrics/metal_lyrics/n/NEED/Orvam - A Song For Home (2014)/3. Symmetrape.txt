Through the darkest lonely path I've been drawn
In a time when no one dreams anymore

What once was bright keeps fading

Through the years we believed were sacred
Life is starting to decay
I've destroyed all that I created
Trying to carve another way

The time I could believe is over
I know we've been betrayed
I'll sit and watch the lifeblood of our future being drained

One single tear will bring the flood
A crown of fear shines on hearts

Day will come and the remains will show
Help me go back to what I called home

Through the years we believed were sacred
Life is starting to decay
I destroyed all that I created
Trying to find another way
And I tried, I still try
