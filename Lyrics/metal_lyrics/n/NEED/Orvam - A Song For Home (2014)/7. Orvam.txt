There is no future for us it's all been decided
What will become of our dreams
Just blood in the gutter
An iron sun looks down at the mountains...Orvam

I don't know what tomorrow will hold
Day by day I am striving alone
There is nothing that's left to believe
My own dignity's taken from me
There's no room for just a chance to escape from this world
Now I feel small, I need a twitch in me to end it all

I hate your lack of voice
Let me make my own choice
Break free of this control
I crave for something pure
I need to end it all

Thoughts of cold and dead emotions
Feed my insecurity
But I'll find the path to finally build my own reality

Never again will I be capable to feel
I am so hollow...Orvam

Can you see now
what kind of world they have created for us?
All I see's treachery and pain and torment
We're growing merciless as time moves forward
A journey to the end

Can you see what they have created for us
All I see's treachery and pain and torment
I'm drowning in the ashes of my fire
And now I see I have to fly my way out

Release me now
from all the pain we've born upon our shoulders
Help me to get back what was taken from me
Help me to reach for me

Time to begin the preparation of the rise
And let go of this old world that's made of lies
To restore our lost connection with the sun
And get back a life in peace that's now long gone

Unify and let the bastards pay the price
Light the fire that once was burning in our eyes

(Free will)Where's my free will
(Trapped in fear) it's trapped in fear
(Slips away) It slips away
(Slips away)It slips away
It slips

Thoughts of cold and dead emotions
Feed my insecurity
But I'll find the path to finally build my own reality
