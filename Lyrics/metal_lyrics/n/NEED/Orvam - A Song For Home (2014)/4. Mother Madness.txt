I hear a voice inside that's crying
A void surrounding me, why won't you let me breathe
The echoes of a past unspoken
An ocean pulls me in, I feel its cold embrace

The water's getting darker, the waves come crashing on me

Lies remain on the surface, I'm deep down drowning
In the water I scream

Mother take me home, to a place so far away
Where we won't be blue and grey
A light that shines so bright, I will wait for one more day
Won't you come show me the way

There was once a time, you know
Where we could all be free from harm
Did we see the coming end
Did we see the coming end and looked away
No one else to blame my friend
Now the price is set and we will have to pay
Home is so far away, mother save me

I see myself he's torn and broken
I try to reach for help, nobody's there for me
Confined inside the walls of my mind
My pride was all I had I hear it slip away

The room is getting colder, the air is much too thick now

Shame remains, covers up the walls
I'm on my knees, I have no breath to scream

Mother take me home, to a place so far away
Where we won't be blue and grey
A light that shines so bright, I will wait for one more day
Won't you come show me the way
