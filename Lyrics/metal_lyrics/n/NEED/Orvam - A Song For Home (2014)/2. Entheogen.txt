Help me reach the shores of bright light

Help me reach the bright light
Help me drink the bright light
Help me find my true sight
Help me open up my third eye

What we are is what we are/ We're coming to be

Look to find the sacred gift from the sky
An urge that is pulling you in
Now unfold the holy path of your mind
The answers are floating within

Queen of dreams set me free again
Queen of dreams make me whole again
Let your light keep me clean from shame
Let your light, keep me free from pain
Let the earth come and take me in
Let the waves become one with me

Try to find what's inside

Queen of dreams set me free again
And reveal visions kept unseen

Lost myself inside a blue sky

Now it's time to hear the earth cry
Now it's time to let my soul fly
Help me find the source of true life
Help me find the source of true life

What we are is what we are/ We're coming to be

Look to find the sacred gift from the sky
An urge that is pulling you in
Now unfold the holy path of your mind
The answers are floating within

I have to face my denial, to break free of the pain
To step into another world that leads me to my own life
Where my spirit's alive, shadows dance in white rain
But there's something that keeps me back to my old life
And I try to escape it I try to embrace it
I push I scream I cry inside me
But nothing seems enough to save me
The light lives in me and I know I can feed on it
There's a deep black noise that blinds me
And I am finally back to where I belong
