Born in the age of control
chain round our neck is tight
freedom expired long ago
left to wonder if all is lost

I keep trying to find a way out of this hole
where I have been forced to live since I was born
so I am breaking my head my nails my bones
to open a crack between the stones but

hope's turning astray within a wall so tall
and time's ticking away breaking a will once strong
hope's turning astray within a wall so tall
when time's ticking away breaking a will once strong
in a world that's turned so wrong

Who's gonna show us to our graves
no tomorrow in sight
turning us into their slaves
they've decided what future holds

I keep trying to find a way out of this hole
where I have been forced to live since I was born
so I am breaking my head my nails my bones
to open a crack between the stones but

hope's turning astray within a wall so tall
and time's ticking away breaking a will once strong
hope's turning astray within a wall so tall
when time's ticking away breaking a will once strong
in a world that's turned so wrong

Now I know, I know, I have been waiting for so long
for one more chance to slip away from here
all this time it seems I have been suffering
and my time is drawing near I'm getting closer to the end

Hope is now turning astray within the stones of this cold wall
and time just ticks and ticks away the things I thought I could hold on
now all my dreams are fading
when my last hope is now turning astray within the stones of this cold wall
and time just ticks and ticks away the things I thought I could hold on
but I'm just tired of holding on...I'm so tired of holding on
