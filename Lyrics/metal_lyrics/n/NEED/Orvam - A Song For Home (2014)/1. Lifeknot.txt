Opened up my eyes and what I saw it only made me realize
that I am weak and there is nothing that comes close
to what it feels to be enslaved to this old shell
I am pretending is myself

what I live just can't be real
how I long to stop the fall

I can't breathe through all the smoke that's burning everything
that's left inside me
Swimming in an endless sea of what I once believed
could make me whole again

Now I need some space cause I am suffocating
lost without a trace, out on a journey to the sun
the only source that could refill my heart with hope
but it's too late, my eyes are far too tired to see

what I live just can't be real
I've been here for far too long

I can't breathe through all the smoke that's burning everything
that's left inside me
Swimming in an endless sea of what I once believed
could make me whole again

how I'll know what is for real
is there something left to feel
I got thorns around my soul
there's no strength in me no more
I'm heading downwards...these chains rip my skin

I have lost sight
they say living is easy when eyes are wide shut
I remember a time when we were bold enough
to look into the bright light

I can't breathe through all the smoke that's burning everything
that's left inside me
Swimming in an endless sea of what I once believed
could make me whole again
