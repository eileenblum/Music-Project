We can feel the strength rising to the surface
Only looking back to see how far we've come
We recall the moment
When courage refused to sit in silence
And we found a strength that we had all along

The black clouds that surround me
No longer hold the weight or strength to bind me
Because I'm standing right outside this castle
That now lays broken in her ruble
Screaming out a name
That brings me pain 

We're on our own, but not alone

Death is a lie that threatens my everything
My choice is clear so I'm not afraid to scream
"I found love, I fell in love"
Look in my eyes, tell me you feel the same
My choice is clear so I welcome the pain because
"I found love,I fell in love"

One by one, we float, rising to the surface
Showing our heart, showing sacrifice
One by one, we learned from all our disappointments
And we found a strength that we had all along

I can't shake the images I get
From stand up on the cliff
Because all it took was a couple matches
And a passion fueled by hatred
To redirect the pain
To start this flame
I fell in love [repeat]

Our heart is what guides us
Our dreams keep us pressing on
We've come too far to turn back now
