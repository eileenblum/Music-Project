We lost our way, 
eyes loaded with all we tried to save, 
when did it go wrong?
I can't live holding a clock in my hands, 
but that's something about me you'll never understand.

We lost our way, 
holding back the truth we tried to say, 
when feelings held us down
Open, describing something broken
Patience, a path too far to reach

Who will stand against them? 
Who will help me fight them? 
Who will be the voice to break the soul?
Who will be the first to throw this brick?
Who will stand against them?
Who will help me fight?

Take 10 years and break me at the seams, (we still believe...)
Curse the sky and damn the air we breathe, (the power in our dreams...)
Because we believed every lie, 
Every dream that we let die...took a piece of us with it.

Restless, a constant work in progress,
Shameless, is bearing all you have,
Willing to accept the fact we're dying,
A promise that you'll never be alone.

Take 10 years and break me at the seams, (we still believe...)
Curse the sky and damn the air we breathe, (the power in our dreams...)
Because we believed every lie, 
Every dream that we let die...took a piece of us with it.

We won't just give up on our dreams, (we still believe...)
We'll embrace the fall and make all our beliefs real, (the power of dreams...)
And I won't stop because you can't see, the tragic things that make me "me"
Bring on the flood, bring on the flames, bring on your empty graves

It's come to this, a choice is made...we'll never be the same

Expose us for the dreamers that we are,
We've spent our whole lives just waiting for someone to prove us wrong,
Expose us for the failures that we've been, 
What you call a mistake...is the best part of my life.

There are no victims here, just people who are sick of being hurt,
There are no victims here, just people who see the need for change.

It's come to this...it's come to this.
