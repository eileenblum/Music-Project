Just take a breath
The skin breaks but just won't stay broken
Capitalizing on their mistakes
They gave you everything to take them down

They're gonna get it now
You'll send em straight to hell
For everything they put you through,
Your heart is filled with sorrow
So poisonous and so hard to swallow
They're gonna get it
now
They can't hurt you

So why are you so afraid?
Are you ready to make them pay?
The ones you trusted, set you up to burn
So why are you so afraid?
Are you ready to make them pay?
Scared of what you'll find?
Ashamed of who you were?
You're not that person anymore

You're not the person that you were

Take what they did and rip them to pieces
They'll never cross you again 

Fists up, all eyes focus on one,
When these babies drop its gonna block the sun
They didn't feel then, they're gonna feel it now
Heads up, look 'em straight in the eyes
They escaped before, but not this time
They didn't feel it then, they're gonna feel it now

The skin breaks but won't stay broken
You couldn't save her but look how strong she's made you
