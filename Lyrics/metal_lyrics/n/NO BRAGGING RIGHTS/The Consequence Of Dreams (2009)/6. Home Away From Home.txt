Lights out over Portland,
My life changed the day she came in,
Lights out over Washington,
A beauty that I can't wait to see again,
Lights out under a dead moon,
I know it's dark the light will come soon,
Lights out and though I'm gone,
I won't say "goodbye" because that's not what this is,
I'll be back for a name that beats in my chest.

My chest is weighing me down,
And I'm so scared of leaving,
My heart knows what it wants,
Want to or notâ¦this is my home.

Lights out from the front line,
I was brave but so scared to die,
Lights out for the last time,
We found something here that they'll never find,
Lights out to keep you safe,
Her embrace leaves me homesick,
Lights out and though I'm gone,
I won't say "goodbye" because that's not what this is,
I'll be back for a name that beats in my chest.

(My chestâ¦is weighing me down) [repeat]
Please don't forget me,
Keep my memories,
I know where my heart is,
I'll be back I promise.
