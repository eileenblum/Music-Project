How could you just watch the flames consume your home?
And do nothing, all that you loved destroyed by fire, just lays in ashes now,
You just stood there.

Straight out of a dream, drenched in kerosene,
All I'll ever need is in your eyes,
Give me a smile, test my commitment,
Embrace me forever because we fit perfect.

All this for love (you don't, you don't understand)
All this for you (I tried hard to let go)
All this for love (you don't, you don't understand)
All because I don't know how to say goodbye.

Emerging from the flames, smoke still in my lungs,
No remorse at all for anything I've done,
All I ever wanted was to watch this whole place go down,
Go down in flames.

All this for love (you don't, you don't understand)
All this for you (I tried hard to let go)
All this for love (you don't, you don't understand)
All because I don't know how to love you.
All this for love
All this for love
All because I don't know how to say goodbye.

Under a reddened sky, in the darkest of places, 
Both standing tall, with smiles on our faces,
All you ever wanted was to never be alone,
All I ever wanted was to watch this city burn.

All this for love (you don't, you don't understand)
All this for you (I tried hard to let go)
All this for love (you don't, you don't understand)
All because I don't know how to love you
All this for love
All this for love
All because I don't know how to say goodbye
All this for love
All because I don't know how to say goodbye.
