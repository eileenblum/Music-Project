I'm giving up on finding love,
At least until the smoke and dust clears so I
Can finally see for once true love,
Not something broken and mistreated from being alone.

I'm breaking every rule that I made,
Just to push you away.

I won't stop trying to find you,
I'll spend my whole life here searching,
But when the heart talks,
You better listen upâ¦don't ever fall in love.

It's been so long since I've been gone,
This constant distance is what tore us apart,
I couldn't live inside your phone,
The heart grew fonder, then grew tiredâ¦its all my fault.

I won't down play this choice I've made,
And I won't deny that this is my life [repeat]

I'm breaking every rule that I've made,
Sorry to push you away.
