We both know how this ends, I'm on my knees screaming "Save me"
Free me from this hell,
I don't wanna stay here, (I'm ready to leave) 
I really hate to ask this (I'm ready to go)
Just close your eyes and squeeze...do this for me.

One shot to end this all, we both know there's no going home,
One shot to end this nightmare we can't wake from,
Our love is what got us here, we fought so brave despite our fear,
Your song is what's making this oh, so hard.

We both know how this ends, I'm on my knees screaming "Save me"
Free me from this hell,
I don't wanna stay here, (I'm ready to leave) 
I really hate to ask this (I'm ready to go)
Just close your eyes and squeeze...do this for me.

Say goodbye to the hero, say hello to the martyr,
You made me your scapegoat, send me straight to the slaughter,
You created a monster, eventually something had to give,
There's nothing worse, than losing your will to live.

We both know how this ends, I'm on my knees screaming "Save me"
Free me from this hell,
I don't wanna stay here, (I'm ready to leave) 
I really hate to ask this (I'm ready to go)
Just close your eyes and squeeze...do this for me.

There's more to life than this,
There's more to life than feeling like you're broken,
There's more to life than this,
There's more to life than feeling like you can't get by on your own,
There's more to life than this,
There's more to life than seeking their approval,
There's more to life than this,
There's more to life than feeling like there's no way out when there is.

We both know how this ends, I'm on my knees screaming "Save me"
Free me from this hell,
I don't wanna stay here, (I'm ready to leave) 
I really hate to ask this (I'm ready to go)
Just close your eyes and squeeze...

We both know how this ends, I'm on my knees screaming "Save me"
Free me from this hell,
I don't wanna stay here, (I'm ready to leave) 
I really hate to ask this (I'm ready to go)
Just close your eyes and squeeze...do this for me.
...do this for me.
