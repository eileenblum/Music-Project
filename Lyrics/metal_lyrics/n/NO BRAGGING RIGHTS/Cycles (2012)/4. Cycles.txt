This cycleâ¦ must never repeat;
This must end with me.

How could we know any different if this is all weâve known?
â¦This cycle must end with me.

I am the product of a broken man,
The embodiment of empty dreams,
A reminder of what youâll never be.
I am revengeâ¦ I am empty like your bottles.

Am I just like my father?
Well, I refuseâ¦ I refuse to be a monster.
I know I have the same weakness inside of me,
I also have the strength to control my own destiny.
This must end with me.

How could we know any different if this is all weâve known?
This cycle must end with me.
How could we know any different if this is all weâve known?
This cycle must end.

I choose to beâ¦ I choose to beâ¦ nothing like you.

You couldnât hold my hand because your hand held a bottle.
How am I supposed to be normal?
How am I supposed to anything but angry at the world?
Misguided hate that I knew all too well;
I had to learn to be a man on my own,
To not make your mistakes or share the pain Iâve known.

How could we know any different if this is all weâve known?
This cycle must end with me.
How could we know any different if this is all weâve known?
This cycle must end.
