Iâve seen the way you stare out your window to a sky that you knew,
And sigh angrily at a world you once loved.
Iâve seen you throw up your hands in frustration,
Because you give and give but itâs just never enough.
Why do things change? How come things fall apart?
Why are you still haunted by all the things that you arenât?
Iâve seen the pain photographs bring your eyes,
Yeah, you failedâ¦ but at least you tried.

Itâs not over, no, itâs not over,
Did you really mean âwhatever it takesâ?
Then put your money where your mouth is.
Roadblocks? Kick them over.
You see a wall? Grab a hammer.
No more nights of losing sleep;
Some things in life should repeat.

Iâm well aware that things should end,
And for a good reasonâ¦ some things are gone too soon.

Just moveâ¦ keep moving,
Some mistakes are worth repeating,
Keep pushing forward,
Keep pushing towards the one thing you want the most,
Because youâre not done fighting yet.

You canât start to live your life until excuses die.

The hardest thing life is being real with yourself,
Now the only thing left to do isâ¦

Moveâ¦ keep moving,
Some mistakes are worth repeating,
Keep pushing forward,
Keep pushing towards the one thing you want the most,
Because youâre not done fighting.

Take back your lifeâ¦ and let excuses die.
