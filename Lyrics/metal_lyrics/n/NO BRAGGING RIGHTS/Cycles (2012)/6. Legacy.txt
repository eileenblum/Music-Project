The icecaps are melting,
The plates have shifted,
Calendars counting down to our world endingâ¦ our world ending.
Are even prepared?
Have we seen enough?
Worried about our futureâ¦ weâre not even promised today.

Weâre not immortal but weâre so sure about tomorrow.
My end of the world could be today.

And if thatâs the caseâ¦ then Iâm proud of the life I lived.
Proud of my family and the friends Iâve made,
Can you say the same?

When I leave this place, Iâll have a smile on my face.

Pockets empty but full of memories;
My friends and family are my legacy.

Leaving nothing behindâ¦ living for nothing is such a waste of time.
