I prayed and prayed, but the break never came
I hoped and wished for change, but it just stayed the same
Tell me again how this is my faultâ¦ tell me again how this is my fault.
I tried to save it but it just fell apart;
Is this my punishment for following my heart?
Tell me again how this is my faultâ¦ tell me again how this is my fault.

Throw these things to the sun,
Face my fears head on,
Throw these things to the sunâ¦ all the things out of my control,
Face my fears head onâ¦ a freedom that Iâve never known,

Iâve seen the good I can do,
Iâve seen the change that Iâm capable of.
I need to stop blaming everyone around me,
Not let things of my past define me.

Never stop trying. Never stop fighting.
