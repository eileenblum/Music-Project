So sweet and beautiful,
Melodies that break the heart and tear the soul,
Never stop singing.
Smoke and mirrors drying up your throat,
Choke and spit as you reach out for notes,
Never stop screaming.

Pushed far beyond your breaking point,
You care so much even though you know they donât.
When does enough become enough?
What do you do when enough becomes enough?

You close your eyes
And scream, âGoodbye.â
You open your arms and find a way to fly.
And fly away from here
To where the air (is) clear.
Free from a judging world;
Your beauty is just too much to hold.

Theyâre driving in the fact
That youâre different, but thereâs nothing wrong with that.
Never stop singing.
Your song is brave with just a hint a pain,
Proof youâre alive and things can change,
Never stop screaming.

When you finally see things clearly,
You donât fear leaving
When they can no longer hold you backâ¦

You close your eyes
And scream, âGoodbye.â
You open your arms and find a way to fly.
And fly away from here
To where the air (is) clear.
Free from a judging world;
Your beauty is just too much to hold.

Their attacks are relentless,
And I see it all around usâ¦
Their selling us their ideas of whatâs âbeautifulâ,
What the hell do they know?

Burn the billboards down,
And pull the pages out,
Rip the TV off the wall,
That isnât beautiful.
