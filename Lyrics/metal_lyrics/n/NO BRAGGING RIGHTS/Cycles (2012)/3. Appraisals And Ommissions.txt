When my walls caved in and my foundation broke,
When my sky came crashing and I lost all hope,
I was welcomed with silence.
So I screamed again with desperate persistence,
When I needed you the mostâ¦ I needed you, not just anyone.

I moved onâ¦
Iâm saying thanksâ¦ thanks for nothing.
Thanks for never being there when I needed you the most.

When I screamed your name to a bleeding sun,
When I needed you the most, you were gone.

And I see where your priorities (lie),
Where our friendship ranks behind what you try to hide.
You canât be there for me despite what weâve been through;
It sucks but Iâm better off without you.
I canât believe what you placed above meâ¦ thanks for nothing.

Iâm saying thanksâ¦ thanks for nothing,
Thanks for never being there when I needed you the most.

Better off facing this alone,
And Iâm strongerâ¦ stronger than what Iâve shown.
No more making excuses, no more feeling worthless,
No more on relying on someone else to pull me through.
Iâm well aware of my strength and whatâs left to doâ¦
Pursue the life I want,
Free from fearâ¦ with or without you here.
