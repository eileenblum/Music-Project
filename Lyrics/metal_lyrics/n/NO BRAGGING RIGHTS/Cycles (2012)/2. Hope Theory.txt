Sheâs tired of my words,
Tired of a world that turned on her.
Things were great but short lived,
Now she doesnât remember how it felt
To greet the new day with a smile
Or a hope that would see her through tomorrow.
âYou said things were going toâ¦ going to get better.
So why arenât they getting anyâ¦ getting any better?â

I answered with thisâ¦
Iâm sticking to my wordsâ¦
Even life at its worst,
It doesnât even come (it doesnât even come close),
To the strength that youâve shown (the strength that youâve shown),
Or the fight that it took to get you to this point,

Never look back,
Never lose sight,
Never lose hope,
Thatâs not a noose,
Itâs a rope,
To pull you out,
To pull you out,
To pull you out of this mess that youâre in.

The change was subtle,
The change was slow,
The change became so beautiful,
Her smile back the darkness gone (her smile back the darkness gone),
Heaven is real when hell is where you escaped from.

Things are going to get better, to be better.

I still believe the power in our dreams.

Never look back,
Never lose hope,
I will never look back,
I will never loseâ¦ never lose hope.

I believe things can change,
I believe that brighter daysâ¦ are coming.
