It just takes oneâ¦

Why are we so quiet?
Is your life not important?
If just one goesâ¦ then more will follow after.
Yes, we can wait it out,
Or we can start right now,
Things donât have to stayâ¦ stay this way forever.

I donât believe that this is over,
And yes, I have faith that this will come back full circle.

It just takes one.

Why are we so scared of public burnings?
Are we that content with how things are going?
Itâs just intimidation, a vulgar display of power.
Iâll take the firewood myself and Iâll even bring the matches.

I donât believe that this is over,
And yes, I have faith that this will come back full circle.

It just takes one.

It just takes one to get things moving,
Donât put the fire outâ¦ we want it burning.

It would be an honour to be the martyr,
It would be an honour to be your martyr.
