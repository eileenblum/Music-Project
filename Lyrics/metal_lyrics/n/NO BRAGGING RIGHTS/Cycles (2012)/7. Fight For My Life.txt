When the curtain falls, will it fall without warning?
Or when the light goes out, will anybody be around?
Iâve seen the tide take everyone I know.
It makes my heart breakâ¦ is it time to just let [it]?

Maybe itâs time to move on?
Maybe weâve taken this as far is itâll go? Noâ¦
Not throwing in the towel,
Push a little further for now.

Iâm in the fight of my life,
Protecting something that I canât deny.

Protecting something that I wonât give up,
Fighting for something that I truly love.
Iâm not afraid of losing popularity,
But Iâm scared to death of losing something thatâs a part of me.
Something that Iâll always be,
Something that I feel inside,
Something Iâve been my whole life.

Maybe itâs time to move on?
Maybe itâs time to let go?
A constant fear that I canât hide,
Iâm in the fight of my life.

Maybe itâs time to move on?
Maybe weâve taken this as far is itâll go? Noâ¦
Not throwing in the towel,
Push a little further for now.

Iâm in the fight of my life,
A growing fear that I canât hide,
How can this be wrong when itâs the only thing that feels right?

Iâm in the fight of my life,
Laying down my pride,
No longer afraid of how I feel insideâ¦
Iâm fighting for my lifeâ¦ of my lifeâ¦ Iâm in the fight of my life.
