My faith is my strength,
Itâs my way to separate all the things that get in my way
From everything that Iâm trying to save.
The things that I believe and everything that I hold true,
Is my driving forceâ¦ itâs what gets me through.

Stop trying to sell me a lie,
Your ideals are poison.
Materialistic lifeâ¦ is not what I believe in,
â¦youâre lyingâ¦ lying straight to my face.

How am I supposed to feel?
Youâre talking about truth but youâre not being real.
What am I supposed to say?
I donât feel that way.
Iâve been a victim, mostly by my own doing,
Now I prey on all the dream crushers who said that I was wrong.

My strength is my faith that things can change,
My strength is my faith and my faith sets me free.

Weâre being churched out of our own faith,
Because being saved isnât being safe,
Be this, buy thatâ¦ investing in things that only distract,
Go there, marry themâ¦ when does it end?

How am I supposed to feel?
Youâre talking about truth but youâre not being real.
What am I supposed to say?
I donât feel that way.
Iâve been a victim, mostly by my own doing,
Now I prey on all the dream crushers who said that I was wrong.

Stop trying to sell me a lie,
Your ideals are poison.
A materialistic life is not my salvation,
Is not my salvationâ¦ salvation.
