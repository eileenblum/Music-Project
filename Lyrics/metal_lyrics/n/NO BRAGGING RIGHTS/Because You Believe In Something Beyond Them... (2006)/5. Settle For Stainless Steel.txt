Can you feel it every time my lips kiss 10 five 83? 
(It's all that's left, it's all you are) 
I have to settle for stainless steel 
(Stay respectful, stay away) 
My fingers go over inscriptions that bear the name of someone 
I've been dying to hold 
The fear of stepping on toes 
When you find something worth fighting for 
You don't just walk away, you don't just let that go 
When you find something you can't deny 
Especially something you've looked for your whole life 
We could look the other way and ignore whats in our face
Pass it off and move on 
But I've been hurt enough to know
It's not the fall that proves to be fatal 
It's when the hearts ignored 
I won't stop 'til a broke finger is answered for 
We found our fight 
When you find something worth dying for 
You'll feel it in your heart and you'll just know  never let it go 
We could look the other way 
And ignore what's in your face
Pass it off, move on 
But I've been hurt enough to know, 
It's not the fall that proves to be fatal, 
It's when the hearts ignored 
I won't stop 'til a broke finger is answered for 
Don't get hung up on threatening skies
Don't get hung up on sad goodbyes
Have faith that the sun will rise 
I found my fight in green eyes, my fight in green eyes
