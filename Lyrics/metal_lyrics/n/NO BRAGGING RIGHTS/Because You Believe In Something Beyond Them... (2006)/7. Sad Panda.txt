I miss her so much 
Here I stand, an orphan
Left for dead in a brand new land
Hands stretched out as far as I can
Hoping, reaching, praying but no one stops
Memories get me by
And scars remind me that you weren't just a dream
Every night the same nightmare
And waking with the pain of being here
I remember a time when I had it all
She gave me a name, she gave me a home, 
and I miss her so much I can't let her go
Forsaken and in search of a home
I'd have died with you if you would have let me, 
instead of being here left for dead
I'd have died with you if you would have let me, 
forsaken, alone she gave me a home
I remember a time when I had it all 
She gave me a name, she gave me a home, 
I miss her so much I can't let her go
Forsaken and in search of a home
