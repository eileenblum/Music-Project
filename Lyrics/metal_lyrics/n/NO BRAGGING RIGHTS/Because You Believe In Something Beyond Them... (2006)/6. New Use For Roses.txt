Don't give up
This arrangement of flowers is dying for answers 
And I won't let this go
This is so temporary I'm not ready to say goodbye

Because I've looked for you my whole life
Six feet from peace
And I've come too far to turn back now

Here I am, 
And I know this sounds crazy but I think you can hear me
And when you finally wake up
Don't say you're sorry, don't say that I was right

Because I've looked for you my whole life
Six feet from peace
And I've come too far to turn back now 

When tombstones lose their value and all that's left is an empty grave
I'll find an excuse for roses in honor of love saved

Let's go as far as this road may go
Let's face whatever consequences this love may bring
Six feet from peace, we've come too far to turn back now
