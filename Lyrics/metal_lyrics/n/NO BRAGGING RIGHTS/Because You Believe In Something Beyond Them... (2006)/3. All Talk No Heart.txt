No more being okay with sugarcoated answers
Last time we let ourselves be so naive
Before we fall into the same rut of our damned ancestors
Taking blinders off were ready to see

The taste of blood was starting to make you sick, 
So you stopped biting your tongue
I watched you hang for an idea, more like a passion you would not give up
You believed in yourself, but even more in the power of love 
And in the presence of death with eyes on a noose
I fell to my knees, said I was sorry, and I died too

Find something that gets you outta bed
Find something that keeps you from sleep
Find something that won't leave you alone
Find anything, something's gotta change

No more acting like everything's okay
Last time we take a bribe for keeping our mouths shut
Refuse to be fooled by headlines on a page
And don't ever let anyone tell you who you are 

The taste of blood was starting to make you sick, 
So you stopped biting your tongue
I watched you hang for an idea, more like a passion you would not give up
You believed in yourself, but even more in the power of love 
And in the presence of death with eyes on a noose
I fell to my knees, said I was sorry, and I died too

Find something that gets you outta bed
Find something that keeps you from sleep
Find something that won't leave you alone
Find anything, something's gotta change

All talk and no action
All talk and no heart

Realize the power to change but holding true to your beliefs 
Because that's what sets you apart
Realize the power of fear and how to over come
Realize the power of truth it's worth the fight

All talk and no action
All talk and no heart
