[feat. Evan Foxx of DESTRUCTION OF A ROSE]I don't fit in
And never will I'm not like them

Now I'm calling you out exposing you as a fraud
So the world can see its true enemy
This unbearable silence breeds unspeakable violence
When those left standing are like me

Those who defy
Will lose their life
What good is your life
If saved by a lie

Those who believe
Never die

Give me the strength to fight
Cause I'm barely holding on
Give me the sight to see beyond them
And I can't trust my eyes
Cause they've failed me once before
Fueled by what's inside
I'm tearing down your empire

Bow down
Or dance in the fire
Bow down
Or dance in the fire

If death is all you have to scare me
Then you're powerless to stop me
If everything I've done only frees one mind
Then this all wasn't a waste of time

Those who are free
Never die

Give me the strength to fight
Cause I'm barely holding on
Give me the sight to see beyond them
And I can't trust my eyes
Cause they've failed me once before
Fueled by what's inside
I'm tearing down your empire

Down I'm bringing you down
Down
We're bringing you down

If death is all you have to scare me
Then you're powerless to stop me
If everything I've done only frees one mind
Then this all wasn't a waste of time
