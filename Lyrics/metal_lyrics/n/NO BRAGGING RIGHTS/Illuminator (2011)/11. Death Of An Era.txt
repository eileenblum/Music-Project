Have you noticed the change?
Well so have I
We pay admission just to wait outside
I miss the way things used to be
The excitement is gone

I'm tired of preaching to myself
While everyone looks the other way
Your complaints fall on deaf ears
I'm losing everything I tried to save

This marks the death of an era
The start of a movement
A new breed of people
Who refuse to stay silent
If you're not here to help
Stay out of the way
Crashing through the fences
Change comes today

No respect for real talent
When gimmicks take the stage
Musicians thrown to the wayside
When thoughtless phrases pave the way
So sing along to every word
But it's a joke we've all heard
They force feed you this mindless act
And hope in time you'll sing it back

I'm tired of preaching to myself
While everyone looks the other way
Your complaints fall on deaf ears
I'm losing everything I tried to save

This marks the death of an era
The start of a movement
A new breed of people
Who refuse to stay silent
If you're not here to help
Stay out of the way
Crashing through the fences
Change comes today

I never thought this day would come
Now everything's in pieces
How did we let this happen
After all these years

Change comes today
