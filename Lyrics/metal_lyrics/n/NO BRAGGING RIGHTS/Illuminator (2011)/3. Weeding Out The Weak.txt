I can't believe 
What started out as a dream,
Is now finally in reach
But it isn't my goals in front of me
I'm staring into a ghost
But what's hurting the most
Is how far you strayed 
From what you said you'd be

You say it's me who betrayed you
The blind leading the blind
To still be lost in what you'll never find

Just cause you gave up 
Won't mean I will too

I won't let this go
When you're the one responsible
And I didn't lose my sight
But eyes burn when they see the truth but refuse to turn

Away from everything you left
Burn like all the victims in your wreck
I feel so cheated
So much time wasted on all the things you could have been

Despite how things played out
I thought you should know

I won't let this go
When you're the one responsible
And I didn't lose my sight
But eyes burn when they see the truth but refuse to turn

I won't stand for this again
I'm becoming who I'm supposed to be
This is me
Cutting the ties
This is me
Saying goodbye
Saying goodbye

I won't let this go (Let this go)
When you're the one responsible
And I didn't lose my sight (I won't let this go)
But eyes burn when they see the truth but refuse to turn

I won't let this go
(I won't let this go)
(Let this go)
I won't let this go
(I won't let this go)
(Let this go)
