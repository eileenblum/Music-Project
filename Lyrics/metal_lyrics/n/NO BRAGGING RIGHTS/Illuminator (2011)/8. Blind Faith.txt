The sun rises and sets without me
I hope I never leave your thoughts
Do you still hold on to my picture?
Does life go on without me there?
You love a ghost, you love a man you cannot see
You sleep alone and when you wake hope it was just a dream
Thank you so much for your faith in me
This is how I wanted to go out

I wouldn't change it if I could
My only regret is leaving you

True love never dies
So this isn't goodbye
Because you let me live my own life
Despite how much it hurts you to see me go
And to what me fall
You stood by me through it all
This is not the end
I'll see you again

Postcards from graveyards
Messages from beyond
Informing our loved ones
Of just how far we've come

And after handful and handful of soil
We barely scratch the surface
But your faith is a constant reminder
This grave holds a purpose 

This place is a graveyard
This place is a graveyard
We'll find our way

True love never dies
So this isn't goodbye
Because you let me live my own life
Despite how much it hurts you to see me go
And to what me fall
You stood by me through it all
This is not the end
I'll see you again

These graves hold life
We're gonna dig tonight
These graves hold life
This is not goodbye
We'll hold it together
Because our faith is strong 
And they'll speak our names
Long after we're gone

True love never dies
So this isn't goodbye
Because you let me live my own life
Despite how much it hurts you to see me go
And to what me fall
You stood by me through it all
This is not the end
I'll see you again
