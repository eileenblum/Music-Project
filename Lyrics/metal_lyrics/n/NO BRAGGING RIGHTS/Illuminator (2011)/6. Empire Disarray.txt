Let it be known
Your reputation precedes you
You proved everyone right
Let's see you talk your way out of this one
Or beg for your life
Heavy lies the crown that never quite fit your head
Sinking in your thrown
Just waiting for death

The sun will burn a hole right through your blackened skies
A light will shine exposing all your flaws unto the world
Will turn and everyone who bows to you will stand
(And scream) for your head unworthy king

You're a disgrace to everyone who came before you
There's a hope left in the kingdom
For a renewed sense of freedom
And even though spirits are broken
We're reaching to the skies and we're tearing them open

We'll move on without you
Rebuild without you
We've known all about you... All along
You've been exposed
Now you're the ruler of nothing
Just a man without a country
No mercy was shown, now that you've been dethroned

The sun will burn a hole right through your blackened skies
A light will shine exposing all your flaws unto the world
Will turn and everyone who bows to you will stand
(And scream) for your head unworthy king

We'll move on without you
We'll rebuild, rebuild without you
You've been dethroned,
You've been dethroned
