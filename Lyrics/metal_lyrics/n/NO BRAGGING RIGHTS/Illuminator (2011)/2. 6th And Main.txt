Is this dragging you down?
Because it's tearing me apart
I'm trying so hard to stay positive
But this one's too close to my heart

I'm taking this personally
Because lately no one seems to see that we're losing
The very thing that gave life meaning
And gave us all a place to go

I remember a time when this place was more than a building
Felt so afraid, felt so alive, oh how I miss the feeling
Although I know those days are gone
I'm not ashamed of where I came from

Doors are closed and the lights are out
(We've run this place to the ground)
Watched the fire as it burned out
(With the best of intent)
Leaving me here on my own
With nothing to call home

You claim to love something you helped destroy
And I just want to know why?!
We're making plans to build it up again
Don't get in our way

I remember a time when this place was more than a building
Felt so afraid, felt so alive, oh how I miss the feeling
Although I know those days are gone
I'm not ashamed of where I came from

Doors are closed and the lights are out
(We've run this place to the ground)
Watched the fire as it burned out
(With the best of intent)
Leaving me here on my own
With nothing to call home
We've run this place to the ground
With the best of intent
With nothing to call home

We won't be forgotten
Our spirit lives on

We won't forget
We won't forget
We won't forget
That you're spirit lives on

Doors are closed and the lights are out
(We've run this place to the ground)
Watched the fire as it burned out
(With the best of intent)
Leaving me here on my own
With nothing to call home
We've run this place to the ground
With the best of intent
With nothing to call home
