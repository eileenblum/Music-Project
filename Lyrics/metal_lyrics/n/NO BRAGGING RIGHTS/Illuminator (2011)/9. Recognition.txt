Oh I promise I will try my best
To finally get this all off my chest
But don't get me wrong
Or mistake this for complaining
I'm keeping my head up even though times are changing

You lit a fire
Inside of me

And now I'm moving on
Because you've woken something up inside of me
Gave me fire, gave me strength
Gave me what I needed to make it on my own
Gave me more than you could ever know

Now I'm awake
Feeling something that I haven't felt in a long time
And I won't forget what you have done for me
You gave me inspiration, a guiding light to pull me through
This is your recognition
And I owe it all to you

A fire burns
Inside of me

And now I'm moving on
Because you've woken something up inside of me
Gave me fire, gave me strength
Gave me what I needed to make it on my own
Gave me more than you could ever know

You gave me fire
You gave me strength [x2]

A fire burns inside of me [x2]
