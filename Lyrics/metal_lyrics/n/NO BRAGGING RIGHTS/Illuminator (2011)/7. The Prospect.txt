Is this the end Or just the beginning?

This is the end
This is the birth, this is the death
This is the first time we looked at ourselves
And didn't feel like screaming
This is the new, this is the past
This is the last time we doubt ourselves
And accept what we're becoming

Heroes don't wait to act
Or run when blue skies turn black
Don't wait for them to pull you through
Maybe they've all been waiting for you?

So take a stand
Fall or rise to the occasion
It's your decision to make
God only knows how long we've been waiting
For someone like you

The person you are
Is a direct result of your actions
All paths in life lead to one road

I see a light inside you
Suppressed by a fear of failure
How long 'til it breaks free?
How long until you can save me?

So what is it you're waiting for?

The bigger they are
The harder they fall
You have the strength to take them on

The battles been lost
But we'll win the war
Now that you found something to fight for

So take a stand
Fall or rise to the occasion
It's your decision to make
God only knows how long we've been waiting
For someone like you

The person you are is a direct result of your actions
All paths in life lead to one road
