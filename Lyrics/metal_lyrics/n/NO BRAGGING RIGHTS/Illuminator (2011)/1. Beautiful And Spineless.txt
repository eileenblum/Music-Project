I won't give up
Hope is not lost

I see so much room for improvement
When talking about my own game
Always working harder, always reaching higher
Always a step ahead.

But then there are those
Drowning in their own hype
Nothing to believe in
Rotting in the spotlight

Soon we'll be able
To cut them out of our lives
A long and awaited goodbye
Thanks for the dirt on our faces
Thanks for living a lie
Thanks for the constant reminder of why we fight

This is why we fight
This is why we fight

To keep this music that we love from scum like you
To show the world what working hard can do

The passions gone
Apathy has killed it
And we curse the ones
Who take it for granted

Soon we'll be able
To cut them out of our lives
A long and awaited goodbye
Thanks for the dirt on our faces
Thanks for living a lie
Thanks for the constant reminder of why we fight

We fight to free our own minds
Provoking thoughts cause change in time
Protect her with your live
She's mother to us all
Fight despite all odds
We won't fall
I won't give up
Hope is not lost

Hope is not lost
