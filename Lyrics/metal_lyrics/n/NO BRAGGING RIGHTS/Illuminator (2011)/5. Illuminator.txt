We've had enough
To finally see take the blinders off
We'll make a stand
Tear this city down with our bare hands

They won't know what hit them
As they brush the dirt and get back to their feet
...We'll hit them hard again

(Time) It's time to clean this mess
(To) to clench your fists
(Stand) and bring them to justice
(Time) It's time to make things right
(To) To be a light
(Stand) in an empire of darkness

We have the numbers, I like our chances
We have the numbers, I'm liking our chances
We have the numbers, I like our chances
We have the numbers, I'm liking our chances

Fight back don't be afraid
They may own you but you are not a slave
Step back and look around
You've got what it takes to tear this whole thing down

They won't know what hit them
As they brush the dirt and get back to their feet
...We'll hit them hard again

(Time) It's time to clean this mess
(To) To clench your fists
(Stand) And bring them to justice
(Time) It's time to make things right
(To) To be a light
(Stand) In an empire of darkness

We Shine

Be a light
In an empire of darkness
Light the way for others to see beyond this

We shine

It's time to clean this mess
To clench your fists
And bring them to justice
(Time) It's time to make things right
(To) To be a light
(Stand) In an empire of darkness

We're lighting the way
(Don't fall behind)
Stay close or you'll be...
(Left in the dark)
