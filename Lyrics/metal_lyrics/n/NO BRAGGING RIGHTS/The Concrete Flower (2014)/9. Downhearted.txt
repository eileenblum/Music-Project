Shutting gates...let me in...

You understand better than anyone,
So how could you expect me to go on?
When there is nothing left for me,
Just empty seeds and a shell of who I used to be,
Downhearted and frustrated on most days,
All hope I had is stripped away,

So what would you have me do?
Iâve done everything,
I already know what theyâre gonna say,
I see it in their face.

âA moment of weaknessâ¦a selfish actâ¦â
Proof no one really listens,
I took matters into my own hands,
â¦Please understand.

Each painful breath feels like a kick in the chest,
How could you expect me to go on like this?
Yet theyâll have the nerve to call me âselfishâ,
âA moment of weaknessâ a moment of weakness?
This could be the bravest thing Iâll ever do,
You have to understand, you have to,
If thereâs a plan, I donât see it,
If you showed me love, I didnât feel it,
These words arenât for them, theyâre all too late,
Please donât deny me your gatesâ¦

So what would have me do?
Already know what they're gonna say,
I see it in their face.

âA moment of weaknessâ¦a selfish actâ¦â
Proof no one really listens,
So I took matters into my own hands,
â¦Please understandâ¦please let me in.
