Attention. Attention?
Can I bring something to your attention,
22 military suicides a day,
In a year, that makes 8 thousand,
Why has this been kept a secret?
How is no one talking about this?

Thanks, thanks for your service,
Now die, die in silence.

You didn't die on their battlefields,
So you won't be front page news,
In fact, they won't mention you at all,
It's like they've already forgotten you,
Why has this been kept a secret?
How is no one talking about this?

Thanks, thanks for your service,
Now die, die in silence.

Why are we too blind to notice,
A system that breeds broken men,
A Purple Heart is a promise,
And we've turned our backs on them.

Thanks for your service,
Now die in silence.
