So let me get this straight,
My love for you is deserving of hate?
That I'm wrong for even feeling this way,
But my mind won't change.

Nothing will ever separate us,
I'll keep you close to me I promise,
I promise to never let you leave without "I love you",
Every decision made will be with you in mind,
Look in my eyes,
Not matter what, I will fight.

Fight against injustice,
Against those who won't accept us.

My love for you will not be silent,
What we have is ours and I couldn't ask for more,
My love for you will not be silent,
What we have is worth fighting for.

So how can this be wrong?
When it was right from the start,
All they know is hate,
And they don't know my heart.

Threatened by what they don't understand,
Abomination of a master plan,
So keep your mouth shut,
Because you know nothing about us.

My love for you will not be silent
What we have is ours and I couldn't ask for more,
My love for you will not be silent,
What we have is worth fighting for.
