Let's sing songs about hope
Let's sing songs about hope

Two worlds in conflict
Admiration, resentment
Will I always be a lit fuse
Who am I to turn to

How can I bring hope to the hopeless
When I'm barely hanging on by a thread
How can I bring peace to the restless
When I can't even silence my own head

Let's sing songs about hope
And pour our pain into every note
Let's sing songs about hope
Because we know that they won't

Who am I to be heard
Who am I that you should hear these words
Who am I to be heard
That you should sing these words

Let's sing songs about hope
And pour our pain into every note
Let's sing songs about hope
Because we know that they won't
