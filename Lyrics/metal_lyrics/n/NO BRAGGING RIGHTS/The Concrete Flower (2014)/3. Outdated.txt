Ignorance is dangerous,
Depression is a sickness,
Not a weakness.

I'm done with goodbyes,
I won't lose you,
To their lack of understanding,
Outdated way of thinking,
This can't be ignored anymore.

No, I can't snap out of it,
Or grow out of it,
You really think I choose to be like this?
That it's all just in my head,
So I should just get over it?
...Why didn't I think of that?

Words can be deadly,
But I won't bury another friend,
Actions speak louder,
And this can't happen again,
I would do anything but I won't bury another friend.

I'm done with goodbyes,
I won't lose you,
To their lack of understanding,
Outdated way of thinking,
This can't be ignored anymore.

Showing your strength isn't hiding your pain,
It's having the courage to let someone in,
Don't confuse sickness as somebody's weakness,
That kind of ignorance is so dangerous.
