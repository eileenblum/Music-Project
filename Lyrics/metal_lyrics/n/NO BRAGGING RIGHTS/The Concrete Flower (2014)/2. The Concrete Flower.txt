Why fight
(In a wold that's given up, if hope is really lost, why show the love I was denied?)
Why fight
(If hate rules everything, if nothing is worth save, then what's the point?)

Why fight the way I feel inside?
Please don't make me a liar.
Why should it even matter?
I'm so bitter and so tired.
So tired of smiling through this pain, with no end in sight.

Who knew having a heart could be a curse
I try to smile but my eyes scream hate
And loving anything will end in pain

How can I love when I never let anyone inside
Burned one too many times
I'm no defeatist but lets call it what it is
A world damned, a world that's given up
No signs of hope and no signs of love
in a world so full of hate, how could anyone rise above

Why fight the way I feel inside
Please don't make me a liar
Why should it even matter
I'm so bitter and so tired
So tired of smiling through this pain, with no end in sight
Tonight could change my life

In a world so full of hate how can anyone rise above
In a world so full of hate how can I feel anything but lost

In the land of the lost
In the land of broken promises
the land of lies and lust
I found a truth in my pain
and the strength to start again
Tonight should change my life

Why fight the way I feel inside
Please don't make me a liar
Why should it even matter
I'm so bitter and so tired
So tired of smiling through this pain, with no end in sight
In a world so full of hate how can anyone rise above
In a world so full of hate how can anyone rise above
In a world that chooses hate, I choose love. I CHOOSE LOVE
