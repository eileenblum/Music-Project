Can we just lay here for a second?
I won't speak. I won't ruin this,
Please feel free to talk if you'd like,
I'll be waiting out the storm until there is sunlight.

Calm all of my storms,
End all of my wars.

I never want to know a life without you,
On my own, I could make it through,
Can I find peace,
Stand on my own two feet?

I am responsible for my actions,
I can't rely on sympathy to get me through this life,
I recognize that I need to find peace and strength,
Independent from you.

I am not a martyr,
I am my own champion.

Done being my greatest obstacle.

I never want to know a life without you,
On my own, I could make it through,
Can I find peace,
Stand on my own two feet?
I'm gonna be the best me for you,

My head can be a hurricane,
But there's always sunshine after the rain,
And though there is conflict in my heart, my soul,
I'll find my peace, my way home.

Calm all of my storms,
End all of my wars.

I'm gonna be...the best me...for you.
