I drank poison in hopes you would die,
But you kept getting stronger and stronger,
I finally know why.

I had it all wrong,
I had been invested in this hate for so long,
I couldn't see clearly,
Blinded by hatred, the one dying was me.

When it first hit my lips,
I thought I'd have no regrets.

I did what I could to make you feel my pain,
I cursed the ground you walked,
I tried destroying your name,
But nothing ever seemed to break your stride,
You went on with your life,
but I couldn't move on with mine.

I drank poison in hopes you would die,
But you kept getting stronger and stronger,
I finally know why.

The only thing to do now,
Is bleed you out.

I'm bleeding you out,
To save myself.

Moving forward,
Strong on my feet,
Letting you go,
Sets me free. I'm free.

I did what I could to make you feel my pain,
I cursed the ground you walked,
I tried destroying your name,
But nothing ever seemed to break your stride,
You went on with your life,
I couldn't move on with mine.

I drank poison in hopes you would die,
But you kept getting stronger and stronger,
I finally know why.
