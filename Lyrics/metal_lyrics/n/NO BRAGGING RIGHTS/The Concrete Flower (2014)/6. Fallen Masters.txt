Itâs hard to apologize to someone you can barely look in the eyes,
All the pain you put them through,
all the times youâve made them cry,
They watched you destroy your life,
Never letting go and never losing hope,
Having all the faith in the world that peace would find you.

Iâm not saying what I did was right,
Sometimes hate is all you have,
But all it did was make things worse,
Please learn from my mistakes,

I challenge you to live the life I threw away,
The life Iâd take back in a second,
A life free from the cell I built myself,
A life free from the pain youâve caused from hurting someone else,
I wasnât just hurting myself.

This isnât a song of redemption,
Because Iâm too ashamed of how things happened,
But if your heart should find forgiveness,
Iâll humbly accept though I donât deserve it.

Iâm not saying it was right,
Sometimes itâs all you have,
But all it did was make things worse,
Please learn from my mistakes.
