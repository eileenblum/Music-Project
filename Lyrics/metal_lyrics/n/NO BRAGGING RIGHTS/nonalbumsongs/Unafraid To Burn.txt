Another king, another riot, 
Another martyr's been burned, 
And now the streets are filled with sorrow as I wait my turn, 
I can't convince you there's a problem, 
When there's food on your plates, 
But I'm not here to help you solve them, 
I'm here to test the flames

My ears can't take this anymore.

When did we give up? 
Why'd the fighting stop? 
I can't bear to watch the flames...
Save me forgive me...the last words I heard her say.

Bring me back to a time when real me walked the earth, 
Bring me back to blackened skies of those unafraid to burn.

Millions of lives to turn a profit, 
A modern slave trades begun, 
The only reason no ones noticed, 
Is because we sing along to every verse and empty chorus, 
They're playing chords we've all heard, 
It makes me sick to my stomach...singing without words.

My ear's can't take this anymore.

How do you say goodbye to something you've been your whole life? 
How do you walk away from something you fought for...from someone you'd die for
