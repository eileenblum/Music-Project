Where does she live?
My true and fair one
In the end of the world
Where falls the sun.

In the lost realm
Of ancient oaks
She sleeps alone
And can't wake up.

- What do your seek so far from home,
Wandering sad and all alone?
You spent the soles and broke your staff
- I look for my own true love.

Dark magic stands
Between our poor hearts
I crossed the desert
I passed she seven seas.

Dark spells for years
Keep closed her eyes
I will awake her one day
With a tender kiss.

Ask the crescent, ask the wind
Ask the raven, ask the friend
Ask the stars but even they
Will not see through the cloudy veil.
