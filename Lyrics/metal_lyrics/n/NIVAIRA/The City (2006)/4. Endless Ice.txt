The cruel snow
Falls over wings of butterflies.
But I still believe
That those who laugh
And those who dream
Whose hearts are gleaming
And songs fly high

They must not die
They must not die
Never die

So fair and white
The sea of ice has no end, no life.
In its very heart
There burns my fire
Bright as a star
And far above
My song will fly high

Where lies your way
Where lies your way
Far away

My heart will gleam as a million stars
I'll cry my song as loud as I can
Please, hear me
And find me here in the endless ice.
