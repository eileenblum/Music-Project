The pale winter maid
Was crying all the night
Plaiting snowy laces in my lips.
My eyes are frozen lakes
My hair is forest paths
Crowned with icy wreath.

For I passed you'll cry for me
You think I'm dead but I am not
You tame my heart, you know it now
I'm for you in the morning dawn
Very soon you'll leave your grief
Although now you won't believe.

What I was before is not what I am now
Let the fire set my spirit free.
My name was sang by the wind but unheard it was gone.
I am near but you don't see.

For I passed you'll cry for me
You think I'm dead but I am not
You tame my heart, my thread is cut
I'm for you in the morning dawn
Very soon you'll leave your grief.
