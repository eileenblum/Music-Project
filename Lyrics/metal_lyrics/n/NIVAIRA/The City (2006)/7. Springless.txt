You see, snow is falling
The ways are hidden
I'm ready to run away
As if there's nothing to loose!

All the poems are packed
All the winds are harnessed.
Could you run away with me
As if today was the last?

Golden dreams came true
Now it's time to decide
I fear if we stay for a while
Spring will not come this time

The words are all said
The memories are gone
What else can be holding us
In this grey realm of stones?

So saddle your cloud
And never look back
Leave coins and cristals here
Drink the light of the moon.

Golden dreams...
