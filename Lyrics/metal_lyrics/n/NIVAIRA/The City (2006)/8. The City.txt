That night
The snow was falling
To your streets
And you smiled and trusted me
And you shared with me your dance.

Then
You stayed there
And I was gone
Like all those forgotten ones
Couldn't leave on you a trace.

Under the transparent sky
You are changing your masks
Beautiful faces but none of them smiles
I wish I could guess that night
Who you really are!

But now, only in dreams
I can see you again
Dressed in pure gold, but so distant and cold
No one can touch your frail
Cristal heart!

Under the transparent sky
You are changing your masks
Beautiful faces but none of them smiles
I wish I could guess that night
who you really are!

Oh, God! Now in my dreams
I see you again
What was the spell that you put on me then?
How can it be after all
That you cry for me?

I
Saw you calmly
taking lives
I saw your tears but never the eyes
I know, your sorcery is dark.

Why
Did you come
For your own pain?
Why did you lie on the frozen plain
And were born to know no life?
