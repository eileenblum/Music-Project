Still proceeding cycle we dwell:-
At the stage of decline
Grim, erotic, thespian, faint
Somnifacient reflections of life
Nocturnal paths of flesh and blood...
Asleep, drifting through depths
Of derangement restrained
Vital catharsis, writhing collapse
Deliquesced human sense...
A days as calm as dream are mad...
