My consciousness retrieves itâs mental substantive form
Free soars in astral space - subconscious door
Once revealed in dream,
Now leting in
Desires are lost, dismissed - implicit rest
Tranquillity and self-integral state
In movement through world divine -
Flight
My immortal mental substance
Interflows with cosmic consciousness
LIVING STRUCTURES
[Solo: Sergey]
Another me was born for earthly suffering
Ethereal - my flight among the bliss
[Solo: Herman]
