[Solo: Herman]

...And world just an echo of notes
Sound in divine suite of creation
Cosmic art, unbegun, interstellar accord
...Essential...
Macrocosm,
Septenary structure,
Unparalleled purity,
Rhapsody of forms,
Spheres and planets,
Petrified chaos melody
Trapped inside
The lowermost form of being
Humanity is hopelessly deceased
Pre-ordained to be
Always searching
Shall we interflow with the Nameless?
My vision is transcendental
[Solo: Sergey]
