Thoughts of response, theological kind...
Chasing the demon whose name is ignorance,
Pass through the descriptions of mental
Planes: forms, words - in instant you
Will fall...
Sense is the blink, the empiric extract -
To realize and feel
There is a fracture in walls abstract -
Consciously built
Grotesquely marrow is perplexed
Innumerable births
Into a concept of world
Which is just a synth of
False ideas, faults. Synthinity
Conceals....
A symptoms of corrosion and decay in
Every step. I suppose the truth in rumours
Told light comes from the Orient...
[Solo: Sergey]
Breath of sudden releif, inadvertent, entire
Falling like blink you're in
So the harmony rises inside
And reigns supreme...
