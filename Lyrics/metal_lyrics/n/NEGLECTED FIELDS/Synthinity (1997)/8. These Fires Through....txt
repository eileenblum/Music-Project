Out of present grasp, events forsaken guide,
Pathways enchanted lead to cross the riverside
Of letha; they return - avoiding grief and pain,
Deleting all that hurts and blames.
Your fears like melting lead -
Deformed; and eyes are free
To see that's left behind
Berhyme horizon of neglect -
Ablaze until decline
Of youth of childhood, Past bitter fragrance is
Smelled. Again to solitude where dreams commence
Unshared secrecy, consumed with memories
You plunge headlong into days and time is ceased...
Unable to revert
- A trap, one - way path...
[Solo: Sergey]
Your tears like melting lead-
Corrode... And eyes are closed
To keep it deep entombed
- Till memory torches burn
We walk this fires through...
