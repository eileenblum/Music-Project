[bonus track]

Charmed by the splendour of this
Neurally perplexed body
To commence
Bio-organic alchemy
That's something morbid...

Wave! Curtains falls...
Twisted tactile witchery
Nevermore thing accept the way they followed
Bodily affairs... Psychotic trip
Chimerical hollow...

Suspended as I passed an instant after death
To scan a canvas chemical
Perception's in progress, entirelly reversed
Within it streams
Where sense a choir of twisted nerves

Stream
Cold liquid streams
Sweet silver smell
I'm floating in
Adhesive light
Self-tasted kinds
Transcendently devitalized

Where rapture's trapped
And turned apart
Revealing heart
Of sinesthetic art

Where silence flows
Beyond, below
Revealing claws
Of sinesthetic throe
