Doors of his face, the lamps of his mouth
Vargant Lord of plagues
And deserts; he speaks on behalf
Of savage and of charm
Thus loathsome and beautiful twin
Skilful, frigid hands.
So subtle the nature of sin.

The spider's kiss
Aesthetics bizarre
For many in shapes of the beauty unversed
Multiform it's species;
Vestments and vestures are diverse

Spider's kiss
So charming, attractive, delicious and sweet
There's a grace in vile, a glamour,
Enjoy the unique 
Comes now impetuous tide to waters wild,
Seas, ship furrowed not
Comes now the concept
Left to minds alert
A day when great is subverted.
And will we mourn over his gifts?
Nescient of the gloom, once sent to a realm of eclipse...

Former nevermore
Their commonness has passed us by.
Mortal architects, we raise the pathology high...
