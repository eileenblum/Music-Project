In expectance of the eons fall - we are ...

Endless entity in dream of wisdom hidden deep ...

Earth we know
Approaches to turning point
Passing through my eyes
Unknown, newborn world
Far-away of dead
Somatic sense
... Behold - entranced ...

[Solo: Sergey]

Creative tears are shed -
Eschatological, remixing colours of dead world

Regnal age
Of beauty; ancient, storming
River inside me
A drowned in sensual waters
Revelry of sun
Begotten by time

[Solo: Herman]
