My consciousness retrieves  it's mental substantive form
Free soars in astral space - subconscious door
Once revealed in dream,
Now leting  in

Desires are lost, dismissed - implicit rest
Tranquillity and self-integral state
In movement through world divine -
Flight

My immortal mental substance
Interflows with cosmic consciousness
LIVING STRUCTURES

[Solo: Sergey]

Another me was born for earthly suffering
Ethereal - my flight among the bliss

[Solo: Herman]
