Once before your birth
You were dead and separated
With neglected flesh
While personality was erased

Erased
Consciousness - serenity and bliss
Lost amount of human ego...

[Solo: Sergey]

Re-created soul
Replaced to newborn kind
Soon will be restored
An equilibrium of life

Completed coil
Post-mortal birth
SANSARA

[Solo: Herman]
