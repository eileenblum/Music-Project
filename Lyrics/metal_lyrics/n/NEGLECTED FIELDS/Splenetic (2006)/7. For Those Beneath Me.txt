To grasp the brute inside-
The arrogance of pride...

Observing
a myriad misled
Disgorging bane subconscious
For those beneath me I am weird

Exhibit harm of human tongue
The engine practised in disguise
A nutriment of flies...

Delusions
Too vacuous to hold
Ambivalent solution
For those beneath me I should fall...

In loneliness oblivion falls
Comfort me, desert of my fallen laws

This sole abyss contains no one
the private chasm, the lion's den
Divinity extends

Becoming...
Thus solitude invites...
When wings are spread in shining,
For those beneath me I will rise!

In loneliness oblivion falls
Comfort me, desert of my fallen laws!
