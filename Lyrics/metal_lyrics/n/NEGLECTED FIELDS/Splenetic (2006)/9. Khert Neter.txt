On the night of Remembrance
Wherein the years are counted up
And the number of the months is told
Let my name be given to me!
On the night of Remembrance
Let my name be given to me!

A coming forth by day...

In the House of Per Neser
And in the House of Per-Ur
Let me, oh, remember my name
Let my name be given to me!
In the House of Per Neser
Let me, oh, remember my name!

And in the house of Per-Ur
Reu nu pert em hru

Homage to Thee!
The mighty one in Sekhem
Lord of Eternity
Name of Thee is established in the mouths of men

On the night of Remembrance
I am dwelling with the Divine One
Take my sit on the eastern side
If any God cometh after me
I declare his name forthwith
I declare his name forthwith!

Reu nu pert em hru!
