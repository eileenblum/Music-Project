Light defiles the flesh
That speaks for filth and morbid
Dusk is the measurement
A tune of phobias

Birth!
Has birth the sanctity of scorn!
(Ignorance sparks a human candles)
Omniscient progenies of norm-
Incipient cancer...

Cipher mystery
A triple six euphory
Five horns in puzzle ring
Fantasmagoric
Beast
Who would be sinister enough?
(Ignorance sparks a human candles)
Sin-saturated god-like spawn
Inherent madness
