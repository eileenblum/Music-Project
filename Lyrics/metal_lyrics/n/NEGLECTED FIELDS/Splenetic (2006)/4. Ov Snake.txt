Praise the Serpent inconspicuous
A shade
Among a shades exiguous
Twisting
Coils like slithering mercury
... Three-feet long lethal fury...
Edenbeast Quetzalcoatl
Mostly a tempter rarely a victim
Reptile versus demigod-
Oh famous contradiction
Lunar-gold psychotic pits of eyes unwinking galaxies immense
... Esurient glance!

Ov grim...
Speechless scarlet restless cloven
The sting
An attribute appalling
Breeding
Rumours primarily abhorrent
Enlighten us in horrid!
Neheb-Ka Uroborus
Cold blood cult apotheosis
the Omnivorous
Reveal metamorphosis
Frigid nascency of slough an effigy piquant enough to daze
A Ravenous grace!

Venomous obscene...
Whispered swear for nasty knowledge
Unclean... With fantasy adorned
Endowed with spite to horrify;
A hiss to chant the chosen
Anthems to the Serpent Sire
The Sire of science and poison
Sin!
