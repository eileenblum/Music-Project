"We'll always be together. Forever" 
"Sweet dreams." 

Mirror, Mirror
This is the place
Where love is broken down
I'm barely free
As I want you now
Misery - seems so cold out
Misery - am I dead now 

Shine - enlighten me - shine
Shine - awaken me - shine
Shine - for all your suffering - shine
Shine - she's mine 

My face now pressed against the glass
The winter here it seems to last
Mirror, what they see
Misery in me 

Shine - enlighten me - shine
Shine - awaken me - shine
Shine - for all your suffering - shine
Shine 

Malachi

"Shine like a mirror reflecting, like the sun shines -- something that comes from above, when all that remains falls below." 

Bow before Hecate
Man of fortune
Man of shame
She's gonna reach for 
The hearts of all of you
And I know her eyes are true 

In a fatal world, 
They're afraid of what she brings
In an unknown world
There are fears of nothing 

And I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid 

I will bring her down 
Lord I'm barely human
I could raise her now
But I can't bear to lose her 

I'm not afraid 

I'm freezing, I'm waiting
All winter, her season
Asleep now I wait here 
Awaken
I can't let go 

The winter - the winter - the winter 
She's here again 
Is this the end
Here there's nothing left
Laid to rest now
Can't look away
I keep holding her
Winter without me seems so beautiful 

Be not afraid of the ways she brings
No, I'm not afraid of the way she shines 

"I'm dreaming all night. All night."
