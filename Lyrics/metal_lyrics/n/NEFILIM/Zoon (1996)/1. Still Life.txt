Rise, rise, rise, rise...... 

"We shall crush you down to the point, where there is no coming back, things will happen to you from which you could not recover if you lived a thousand years, a thousand years." 

Still life
Imitating man
In another life,
in a stranger land,
Am I dreaming I am awake, 
Is this hell or second sight
Are we born again like shadows
Outside of time 

"Feel I'm walking outside, circled around me are these faceless figures watching me, as if they are waiting for something to happen... then it happens."
