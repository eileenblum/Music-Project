Exit rites, new altered states
In the arena of light
We welcome your fate
Let the dead carry the dead
Pyre for the flames
Embers of life in the wilderness remain 

Xodus - I feel reborn
Xodus - reborn 

Your memory and life
I watch it all go up in flames
Left to die again
Fear is mine 

Morning comes as light 
Burning out my eyes
This is the place we're suffering
As we come in from the night
Alive 

"If you are human, this is humanity" 

Xodus - no place to run - meriahs impaled
Xodus - real blood - the rites of change
Xodus - now I feel reborn
Xodus - reborn 

Rise, rise, rise, rise...
