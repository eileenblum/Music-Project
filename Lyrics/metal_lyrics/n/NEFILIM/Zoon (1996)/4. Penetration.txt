"Seeing things in my whole life, images exploding. You have been chosen." 

"We are free." 

Endemion - magical son
Nothing here is real
Lasts forever
Shining like gods
New body, new blood
The fire that I feel
Armageddon
Vision 

Penetrating me
Penetrating you 
Penetrating deep 

Look out 

"What's happening is real. You can't stop them. What do you think, we just go on forever?" 

Ziarahs are all burning ahead
Illuminating ways I've not dreamed before
Eternals are inviting me in
I see images of you burn forever
Can't contain 

Penetrating deep - generating me
Penetrating you - let go 

We must go back now
Make my entrance one way
And I can't look in 
And I can't look back
We cannot stop, no
Black out
Listen 

"Repeat: we have confirmed angel touchdown. The place is completely ablaze of fire. It's like hell down here. I think we're going straight for the fucking light." 

Penetrating deep
Penetrating me
Penetrating you
Again
