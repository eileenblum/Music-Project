"Forgive me as I have become the trail of mutilation towards destruction, evil for all. We the arbitrary souls of our own temple -- need nobody as we reach out and hold your breath of life." 

Who has sent an angel for our requiem
Slaughter house religion
And the burning sun
Liars devotees of their deities
I see Venus decomposing 
Here in front of me, close to me 

"She's a liar." 

Hell hallucinates
As you're fucked and bled
My dreams made flesh
Your words are dead
Paralyzed 
Wide awake - reaching for the light
Dead to the world
Victim of today
Wide awake,
Victim you are mine
Still warm 

Your eyes
Your words 
Your faith
You burn so close to me 

Fear is losing control
Fear is losing your life
Fear is taking your soul
Fear is you are mine 

She feels
Still warm 

As the womb grows colder - sufferer
Dreams I will bleed from your heart
Reasons for my world go rushing blind
Know my name 

No invocation called me
As I reached her from inside
Love could have killed her just the same
Know my name - dead to the world 

My words - dead to the world 

You're dead 

Venus was decomposing
Her hair blazed like sunlight
Flowering in a stream of gold 

Your eyes
Your words 
Your faith
It brings you close to me 

Fear is losing control
Fear is losing your life
Fear is taking your soul
Fear is you are mine
