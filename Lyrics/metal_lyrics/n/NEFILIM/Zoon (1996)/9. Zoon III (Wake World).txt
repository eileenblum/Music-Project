As we begin the end
Let us close the womb this time
My friend 

We live together, forever
Every breath that you will take
I'll breathe
Perfect vision
What's your pleasure 

And we're here again
Where I live
In a perfect hell
And you're here again
I can hardly see 
I will live again
Until it hurts to be me 

What's your pleasure
My name
My face
My spirit
Now leave me
Now go 

This is hell this is
End of time
Lost completely
So this is life is this
I can hardly face to live
When it hurts to be me 

In my world
My world
I will wait for you
Take control of you 
You're lost, so lost
