As she crawls from my hands
Her eyes I think they've found me
Matter
Blood
Her features cease to be traced 

Oh forgive me 

Now have your place with god
Innocence can be hell
Of the perfumed and penetrated flesh
She's melting, melting away 

Of the passions that see and destroy us
This subtle fire, the secret flame
Torture by desire
Transformation from flesh to spirit 

Melting, just melt away 

There's a stillness
Between the light and me
Nothing but dreams and decay
And the angel
Whose wounds are my lamentation
Oh just melt away 

Melting, Melting away.....
