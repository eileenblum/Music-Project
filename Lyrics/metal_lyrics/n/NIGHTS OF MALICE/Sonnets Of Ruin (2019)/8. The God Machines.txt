[Lyrics: Brendan McGrath, Mark Marin]

Our codes have brought a death wish
To this frail existence
Our minds are clouded by unnatural means of subsistence.

God's a machine whose gears are turning at a rate that's faster than we can keep up with. A digital prophet created. A man made anomaly, making us obsolete.
The flaws of design reflect the flaws in ourselves. We'll burn to the ground with it. Dependent, we're selling our souls and the lack of autonomy renders us incomplete.
The pursuit of knowledge steering us further from the truth within
The rise and the fall are happening before our own eyes, a life unsustainable.
Our own evolution is halted but the wheels of entropy continue to spin.

Our codes have brought a death wish
To this frail existence
Our minds are clouded by unnatural means of subsistence.
Slowly the rust and smoke
Consumes the blue and green
Coerced dehumanization.
All hail the god machines.

Endeavors, deceiving. Mechanized conceiving. Compassion, receding. Energy, depleting.

Deus ex machina
Dioses causan lagrimas

Rise of the mechanical messiah.
Our minds surpassed by our own cybernetic creations.

Our codes have brought a death wish
To this frail existence
Our minds are clouded by unnatural means of subsistence.
Slowly the rust and smoke
Consumes the blue and green
Coerced dehumanization.
All hail the god machines.

God's a machine whose gears are turning at a rate that's faster than we can keep up with. A digital prophet created. A man made anomaly, making us obsolete.
The flaws of design reflect the flaws in ourselves. We'll burn to the ground with it. Dependent, we're selling our souls and the lack of autonomy renders us incomplete.

All the gods we've created and killed
It was all just a fucking mistake
Society and the structures we build
It was all just a fucking mistake
Dissociation from what we really are
It was all just a fucking mistake
No turning back, we've taken it too far
It was all just a fucking mistake
Mistake
Mistake
Mistake
Mistake
