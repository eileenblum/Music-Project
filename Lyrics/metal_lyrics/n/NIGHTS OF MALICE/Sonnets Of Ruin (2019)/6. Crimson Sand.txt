[Lyrics: Xavier Quiles, Brendan McGrath, Peter Irizzary]

It's dark and lonely on this unforgiving path you walk
To meet your maker with your head upon the chopping block.

Your only crime was not being one of them. The oppressors so hungry for malevolence.
They'll stop at nothing 'til their message is clear. Join them or fall in the name of their god.
Don't play on their mercy, they know no such thing. No man, woman, or child is safe from the butchering.
All that they know is their blades remain thirsty. The most insatiable need for...

The infidels neck
Decapitate
This offering of flesh
A gift to God
Sharpening the blade to send a message to those who disobey. Death, be their sentence
Sever the heads, force the damnable sinners to rectify. The stump lay lifeless

Life cuts to black with just one swing of the sword.
Cold kiss of steel, be thy fate of this weeping world.

Don't play on their mercy, they know no such thing. No man, woman, or child is safe from the butchering.
All that they know is their blades remain thirsty. The most insatiable need for...

The infidels neck
Decapitate
This offering of flesh
A gift to God
Sharpening the blade to send a message to those who disobey. Death, be their sentence
Sever the heads, force the damnable sinners to rectify. The stump lay lifeless

Truly unfortunate hands have been dealt
To go on like this would be hell in itself
Dark crimson red thickly paints over the sand
Your eyes only see black. Is this the promise land?

Familiar sense of nausea, your adrenaline spikes.
Your heart is racing faster. Then the headman strikes
The crowd gathers with hate in their eyes. Brainwashed by fear and force fed lies
They've come to see the end of a monster they've created.

Take their heads
Gods command
Bloods been shed
Crimson sand
