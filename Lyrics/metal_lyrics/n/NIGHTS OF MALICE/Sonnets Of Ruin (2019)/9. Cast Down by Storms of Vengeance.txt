[Lyrics: Brendan McGrath, Mark Marin]

Decades of damnation, resulting in infection
Of a mindless population controlled by hypocrisy.
Remnants of a nation, crumble into depression.
A massive soul abrasion of a monumental degree.

All the subjects are listening
The lord says as he sneers
"In my hands, I hold your future,
Darkness for a thousand years."

Fear and false prophecies
Faceless totalitarians, corrupted to the core
Fear and false prophecies
When the last drop of oil's drained from earth, what are you fighting for?

Suffer unto thee
Callous, unholy greed
Bloodstained legacy
An abhorrent mess indeed
Face your enemy
How can they truly believe that God is on their side?
Our wise entity
Hath shown us the truth that this murder will be justified
Ravage violently
They stand no chance at all, they have nowhere to hide
With bombs, we bring peace
We will rewrite history in favor of this genocide

All the subjects are listening
The lord says as he sneers
"In my hands, I hold your future,
Darkness for a thousand years."
Now what's left to be cherished
At the end of this reign?
And who shall gather the herd
Once the shepherd has been slain?

Blessed is this conquest of hate
Usurp the throne of this world of decay
The conqueror shall be crowned King of Nothing
The Lord giveth, the Lord taketh away.

These empty streets beckon me, forsaken wasteland be thine kingdom.
Cast down by storms of vengeance, swallowed whole by the maelstrom.

All the subjects are listening
The lord says as he sneers
"In my hands, I hold your future,
Darkness for a thousand years."
Now what's left to be cherished
At the end of this reign?
And who shall gather the herd
Once the shepherd has been slain?
