Another day, another life ripped from it's frail bones as the rations are hardly split.
Another night plagued by the tormenting churning, we're yearning for scraps as our insides are burning.

Woe
How can they simply sit by, always ready to dine?
Out of sight, out of mind. We are nothing to them. We are condemned.

Save us from humanity. Kill off this breed
Fuck this cruel world run by gluttony and greed
The innocent are always the casualties
Only in death will they ever be free.
With each day we grow weaker. Our bones, brittle and frail.
Can we survive with nothing? We try to no avail.
Clawing at the scraps and morsels, fighting tooth and nail
Our bodies decorate the land where God failed.

The selfish pigs have much to spare but our pleas fall on deaf ears.
"Think of our families and our loved ones. We're not so different.
We did not ask for such a life, but now our children's we fear."
Yet they shrug off their disgust with smirks of sadistic glee.

The rivers turning red, we're foraging the streets
We're whispering the words, "when death comes, we will eat."
The moment when we die, God will have food for those in need
And when we close our eyes, we'll see no more children bleed

Save us from humanity. Kill off this breed
Fuck this cruel world run by gluttony and greed
The innocent are always the casualties
Only in death will they ever be free.
With each day we grow weaker. Our bones, brittle and frail.
Can we survive with nothing? We try to no avail.
Clawing at the scraps and morsels, fighting tooth and nail
Our bodies decorate the land where God failed.

The rivers turning red, we're foraging the streets
We're whispering the words, "when death comes, we will eat."
The moment when we die, God will have food for those in need
And when we close our eyes, we'll see no more children bleed
The rivers turning red, we're foraging the streets
We're whispering the words, "when death comes, we will eat."
The moment when we die, God will have food for those in need
And when we close our eyes, we'll see no more children bleed

It would seem fortune favors the bold
Do we not deserve it?
All they care for are riches and gold
One can only dream
As we drop like the flies that swarm us, the flying beasts circle in the sky.
Once we take our final breaths, the vultures will be fed better than we ever were.

Famine spreads like a virus, forever plaguing our land.
We collapse one by one. Was this Gods plan?
