[feat. CJ McMahon of Thy Art Is Murder][Lyrics: Brendan McGrath, Xavier Quiles, Mark Marin]

Our days are numbered when the glaciers start to weep.
The monuments of fools will all be sucked into the deep
The water fills our lungs. The flood is here
We all will drown in Gaea's tears

The only survivors will burn in the fires or fall to the drought
No habitable place left to dwell on this planet. Our time has run out.

The water fills our lungs. The flood is here
We all will drown in Gaea's tears

When will we realize that we are hollow?
When the waves crash in our homes and the shore has been swallowed?
All of your possessions now belong to the sea.
Humanity is a fucking disease.

[CJ part:]
A thousand year plague emerged from lacerations in the ice.
We ignored the warning signs and now we're paying the price.
We just kept pushing and now Mother Nature is taking back her home
How can we act surprised when the planet cracks and it's no ones fault but our own.
Tides will swallow us whole, bringing the unforgiving doom
By the thoughtless humans living on a planet with no more room.
Unrelenting wrath brought to light
Crumbling under the storms might.

When will we realize that we are hollow?
When the waves crash in our homes and the shore has been swallowed?
All of your possessions now belong to the sea.
Humanity is a fucking disease.

It's not safe to breathe. Choking on the toxic clouds
There's nothing left to build from. No resources to be found
A mere shell of what we once were. We're now left in shrouds

The silent cries of Gaea echo through a forest where nothing grows
The irreversible damage that we've caused is catching up to us now. We will reap what we sow

When will we realize that we are hollow?
When the waves crash in our homes and the shore has been swallowed?
All of your possessions now belong to the sea.
Humanity is a fucking disease.
