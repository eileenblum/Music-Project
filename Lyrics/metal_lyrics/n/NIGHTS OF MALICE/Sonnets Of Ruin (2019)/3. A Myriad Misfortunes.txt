[Lyrics: Brendan McGrath]

The heart of humanity collapses into dust
A myriad misfortunes still to fall upon us.
Behind a curtain of lies is the truth of our apathy
We cannot hide forever from this painful reality
It's grim looking forward. Hard to picture a future at all
We can't keep moving forward. We've already seen empires fall
The fields have all been scorched and all the wells are dry
The hourglass is empty. We're living on borrowed time.

There's always room in the budget for death, but life will break the bank.
So many miles left to go in our path but we're running on an empty tank.
The upper echelons hide away, safe behind the walls of their ivory tower
While we suffer for their comfort, they sit back laughing and drunk with power.

This is the hell we live in. God has abandoned us.

Approaching absolute self destruction
All we seek is something to blame.
We destroy everything in our path
All while believing in the prosper we feign.

We weren't always afraid
Take us back to the solace that we remember
But it was never real
It's just a story for the dreamers and pretenders
And who we really are
Is all in the hate we try to defend
This life is nothing but pain
And I just wish it all would fucking end

Bleed out these wretched creatures. All of the oceans turn red
The void we've left fills the air, and there's no one left to bury the dead

This is the hell we live in. God has abandoned us.

Approaching absolute self destruction
All we seek is something to blame.
We destroy everything in our path
All while believing in the prosper we feign.

We weren't always afraid
Take us back to the solace that we remember
But it was never real
It's just a story for the dreamers and pretenders
And who we really are
Is all in the hate we try to defend
This life is nothing but pain
And I just wish it all would fucking end

And I just wish it all would fucking end.
