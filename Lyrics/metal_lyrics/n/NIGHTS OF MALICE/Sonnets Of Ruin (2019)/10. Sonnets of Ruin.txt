[Lyrics: Brendan McGrath, Mark Marin]

How many days can we waste on the same tired ideas? What would you sacrifice for what you believe?
When in the blink of an eye, all we know could disappear. Would it be worth it to know what you've achieved?
And what if all we fought for, and what if all we built was all gone in a flash leaving a void so empty
Would any of it matter? Would anybody care? If only we knew the truth of our impending catastrophe

It could all be for nothing
Another day closer to suicide
We're singing sonnets of ruin
In our final days when planets collide

Do you dream of love?
Do you dream of being complete?
Have you ever known peace?
Or is that just another one of your dreams?

Now if we could see ourselves, foolishly search for meaning, creating lessons and commandments so arbitrary
Could we learn from our mistakes? Or deserve another chance? Are we just doomed to keep repeating history?
So many questions left unanswered. So many plans for a future we'll never see.
So many stories never told. We're left unfulfilled by a life of mediocrity.

I wouldn't care if it all went away
This fucking world is dead to me.

How many days can we waste on the same tired ideas? What would you sacrifice for what you believe?
When in the blink of an eye, all we know could disappear. Would it be worth it to know what you've achieved?
And what if all we fought for, and what if all we built was all gone in a flash leaving a void so empty
Would any of it matter? Would anybody care? If only we knew the truth of our impending catastrophe

Emptiness. Just going through the motions, fucking dead inside. Buried and gasping for air inside a shallow grave. We've become a distant memory so meaningless in our endless pursuit of wealth.
Digging deep to reach a place that still has light. Painful torment creeps from within

It could all be for nothing
Another day closer to suicide
We're singing sonnets of ruin
In our final days when planets collide
It could all be for nothing
Another day closer to suicide
We're singing sonnets of ruin
In our final days when planets collide
