[Lyrics: Brendan McGrath, Xavier Quiles]

Damnation waits. You are denied at heavens gates. The judges become the judged as they descend into flames.

Judgement. Decay. Staring down the black throat of the snake
Judgement. Decay. Staring down the black throat of the snake

Damnation waits. You are denied at heavens gates. The judges become the judged as they descend into flames.

Follow the lost
Carry the cross
The serpents mouth opens wide to devour the unholy
These mortal sins carry with them, torment for eternity
You've spent your life judging. Above the rest, high and mighty
The Dark One spreads his wings. He has you in his sights
And now you crawl.

"They shall be made to crawl on their bellies to the kingdom of darkness"

Your flesh sloughs away. Your bones, black as coal
The lake of fire cleanses your treacherous soul.
Your holiness is hate. You've met your eternal fate.
Do you feel closer to God? Do you feel closer to God?

He has ignored the cries and prayers and the reprieve you seek
From the stygian nightmare you've peddled onto the meek.

Oh the irony as he feeds while your soul bleeds
Your creeds meaning depletes
A fate suited for your hypocrisy
Make yourself at home, you will never leave
Your pleads for forgiveness will never meet the ears of your lord and savior again.

"Lasciate ogni speranza voi ch'entrate"
