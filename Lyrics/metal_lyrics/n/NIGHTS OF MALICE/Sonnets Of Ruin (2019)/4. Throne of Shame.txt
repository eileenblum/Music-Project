[Lyrics: Brendan McGrath, Mark Marin]

Pestilence, we've spread the man made plague.
Venomous thoughts of the sick and depraved.
Forever haunted by the cries of the dead,
They tried to warn us, there was nothing to save.

Reckoning, the day of judgement has come.
There's nothing left of the cities but dust.
Ghosts of the frontline who've perished in vein,
Satisfying the empire's bloodlust.

Flames of purification in the name of freedom. Bludgeoning to the sound of the war drum.
Citizens bow to their sadistic and myopic leaders. Feeding them filth and lies they can bleed for.
Pray for resolution that we'll never see 'cause in their eyes, we are nothing and we all deserve to fucking die.

False prophets speak for the Father
Wearing death like a Medal of Honor
Digging graves for your sons and your daughters
The blind will lead the blind to the slaughter.

All shall soon witness the long awaited end of times
As they force our nations down tightropes to their demise
Our Father, in heaven, hallowed be thy name
Your kingdom's burning as you rest upon your throne of shame.

Reckoning, the day of judgement has come.
There's nothing left of the cities but dust.
Ghosts of the frontline who've perished in vein,
Satisfying the empire's bloodlust.

Pestilence, we've spread the man made plague.
Venomous thoughts of the sick and depraved.
Forever haunted by the cries of the dead,
They tried to warn us, there was nothing to save.

Death, the ravenous merchant, hath no hope or care
Grinning as the apocalypse draws near
When this bleeding world breathes it's final breath
You'll see, even Death himself will shed a tear.

False prophets speak for the Father
Wearing death like a Medal of Honor
Digging graves for your sons and your daughters
The blind will lead the blind to the slaughter.

All shall soon witness the long awaited end of times
As they force our nations down tightropes to their demise
Our Father, in heaven, hallowed be thy name
Your kingdom's burning as you rest upon your throne of shame.

Flames of purification in the name of freedom, bludgeoning to the sound of the war drum.
Citizens bow to their sadistic and myopic leaders. Feeding them filth and lies they can bleed for.
Pray for resolution that we'll never see 'cause in their eyes, we are nothing and we all deserve to fucking die.

Death, the ravenous merchant, hath no hope or care
Grinning as the apocalypse draws near
When this bleeding world breathes it's final breath
You'll see, even Death himself will shed a tear.
