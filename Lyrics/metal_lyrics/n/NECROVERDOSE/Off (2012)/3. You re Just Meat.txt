Whatever I do, wherever I go
When I pick up the children from school
As I go shopping or fucking my wife
The same thoughts always invade my mind

Everybodyâs meat
Youâre just fucking meat

Some would say Iâm a maniac
Thatâs not true Iâm a far-sighted man
When the war comes, Iâll be ready
Ready to eat my fucking fellow man

My tasty fellow man

My tasty fellow man

Canât wait for this war
Thatâs the dream of a lifetime

Some would say Iâm a maniac
Thatâs not true Iâm a far-sighted man
When the war comes, Iâll be ready
Ready to eat my fucking fellow man

Everybodyâs meat
Youâre just fucking meat

World is looking like a huge meat tank
They donât know for what Iâm prepared
No restriction is expected
Those visions make my mouth water
