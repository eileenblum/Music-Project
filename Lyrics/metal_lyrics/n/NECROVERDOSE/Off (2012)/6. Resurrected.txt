Awaken from the deepest sleep
They have returned for our sins

Raised from the dead
Back from the grave
Endless hunger
Boils in their veins

World is about to change
Theyâre back to take revenge on human race
They rise again
Seeking some human flesh
They need some flesh
They need your flesh

Raised from the dead
Back from the grave
Endless hunger
Boils in their veins

Raised from the dead
Back from the grave
Angry, greedy
Resurrected

Now that the dead donât croak
They wonât give you a chance
You are condemned
Our sins shall be punished
Resign yourself to become dead
Resign yourself to rise again

Brought back to life, evil inside
They feel nothing but anger
They cannot die
They walk, cold and decaying
Spreading their ill, growing the tide
We cannot stop the waves of dead
I donât want to die
What do you think about being a prey
Being their Prey

Fear the wrath of god
Pity was unexpected
Beware of god
His judgment is quite unbiased
Fear the wrath of god
Weâll compelled to swell their ranks
Beware of god
They woke up for a reason

Searching for an explanation, we donât care
Youâre not trying to tell me weâre innocent
Behold our own doom, Mankind will perish
Demise will be ours through self exhumation

Fear the wrath of god
Pity was unexpected
Beware of god
His judgment is quite unbiased
Fear the wrath of god
Weâre compelled to swell their ranks
Beware of god
They have brought hell with them

Fury can be unleashed, now Death fulfill life
They walk the Earth to satisfy their lust for flesh
Sadly thatâs the eternal life He promised
Corpses will rule this land, standing unforgiving

Hereâs our burden
The world weâve known will fall into their hands

Weâll all die to live forever

Raised from the dead
Back from the grave
Angry, greedy
Resurrected

Brought back to life, evil inside
They feel nothing but anger
They cannot die
They walk, cold and decaying
Spreading their ill, growing the tide
We cannot stop the waves of dead
I donât want to die
What do you think about being a prey
Enjoy being their prey
