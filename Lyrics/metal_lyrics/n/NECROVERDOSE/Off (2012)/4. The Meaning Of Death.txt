Since the beginnings of consciousness
We always wondered whatâs the meaning of death
What about ultimate fate of the universe
What we know for sure is we canât die while waiting for life
You can wonder if you wonder
I donât give a shit
You can lose your grip and your time
I donât give a fuck
Is there an after-death?
Why death has to stop?
Why are we condemned to live?

Donât fear life
You should die your death
Why are we condemned to search for a meaning?
No need for a meaning
Calm down, die your death
No need for a meaning
Enjoy and die your death
Life is the dawn of a new death
So I yearn for life
Since the beginnings of consciousness
We always wondered whatâs the meaning of death
What about ultimate fate of the universe
What we know for sure is we canât die while waiting for life
You can wonder if you wonder
I donât give a shit
You can lose your grip and your time
I donât give a fuck
Is there an after-death?
Why death has to stop?
Why are we condemned?

Who are we?
And what for?
Why are we here?
Why are we dead?
Who are we?
And what for?
Why are we here?
Why are we dead?

No need for a meaning
Calm down, die your death
No need for a meaning
Enjoy and die your death
Life is the dawn of a new death
So I yearn for life

No need for a meaning
Calm down, die your death
No need for a meaning
Enjoy and die

Who are we?
And what for?
Why are we here?
Why are we dead?
Who are we?
And what for?
Why are we here?
Why are we dead?

Shut the fuck up
