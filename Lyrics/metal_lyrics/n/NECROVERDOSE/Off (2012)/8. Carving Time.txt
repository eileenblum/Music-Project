Carving to sew, sewing to live
God on my side
God on my side

First, choose your victims with care and patience
After, follow them silently before killing them and
Cut out a piece of their body
To keep this part for my daily
Stitching

Compelled to sew

Of course, this sacrifice is useful
Finally, a necessary evil so
No one can say I'm a liar
The truth is life as to end one day

I steal their power
Which can nourish me

It's
Carving time
Stitching feeds me

No one can't stop me
I've got some sewing to do

Carving time stitching
Makes me be
Carving time
Carving before stitching

On my body

Carving to sew, sewing to live
Our God agree
Our God agree

Of course, this sacrifice is useful
Finally, a necessary evil so
No one can say I'm a liar
The truth is life has to end one day

Carving time
Stitching makes me be
Carving time
Carving before stitching
