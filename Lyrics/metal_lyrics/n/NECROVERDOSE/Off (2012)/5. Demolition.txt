Iâll set your world in order
It has to be purified
Resign yourself to vanish
Listen when I speak

Capitulation
Human race termination
Youâll die like pigs
Soon carrions to me

This wicked tale is nearly over
Tell me how you want to die out

Caution
Oppression
Constriction
Your life cycle cancellation
Scission
Repression
Extinction
Demolition â Your fate is written

Iâll set your world on Fire
Iâll mutilate your children
And sterilize your females
Listen when I speak

Extermination
Men balls excision
Youâll have a slow death
Youâll have a slow death

Thereâs no need for regrets and sorrow
Tell me how you want to die out

Caution
Oppression
Constriction
Your life cycle cancellation
Scission
Repression
Extinction
Demolition â Your future is broken

Proliferation is close to be over
We have to stop this critical infection
Soon youâll feed the ground where we sow
The real life

Caution
Oppression
Constriction
Your life cycle cancellation
Scission
Repression
Extinction
Demolition â Your future is broken
