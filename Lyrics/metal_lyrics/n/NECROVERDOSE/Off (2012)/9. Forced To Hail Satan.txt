Bound - Tortured
Born to Suffer
Trapped - Mangled
You gonna face your fate

Now you gonna stop
Lying to yourself brazenly
Stuck on this cross
Youâll test a new dimension - God looks away

You know your master
You have been chosen
You can scream for help
Nobody can hear you

Beg for help - You know I can help
You know I can help you if you want to
Confess - You better confess
You better confess you love your master

Bound - Tortured
Born to Suffer
Trapped - Mangled
You gonna face your fate

Now you gonna stop
Lying to yourself brazenly
Stuck on your cross
Youâll try a new sensation - God sniggers

You know your master
You have been chosen
You can scream for help
Nobody can hear â you

Worship - Satan - praise Him - as your master
Accept - Admit - Confess â concede the truth
Worship - Satan - call him â the only way out
Gladden - Your wretched life is ending

Beg for help - You know I can help
You know I can help you if you want to
Confess - You better confess
You better confess you love your master

Forced to hail Satan
Fingers severed in the sign of the beast
No need to snivel
Donât struggle, let you swept away

Iâve planned everything for ages
Thereâs nothing personal, it has to be done
Youâve got only one choice
The last thing you have to do on this earth is to hail

Beg for help - You know I can help
You know I can help you if you want to
Confess - You better confess
You better confess you love your master

Tortured - Severed
I set you free from your lie
Confession performed
Now that youâre gone, my work is complete
