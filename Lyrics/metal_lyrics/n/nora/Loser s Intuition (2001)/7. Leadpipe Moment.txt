My problem is I can see it.
My problem is I have seen it.
Look what it's done to me.
Watching what it's done to you.

13 hours at a time, or 9-5.
We're in this for our lives.
13 hours at a time.
Are you alive?
Are you a lie?

What about standing up?
What about fighting for your life?
What about standing up?
What're you going to do when the good guys lose?

Day after day you're on your back.
A slave so long,
You've lost track 13 hours at a time, or 9-5.
We're in this for our lives.

13 hours at a time.
Are you afraid?
Afraid to try?
Are you alive?
Are you a lie?

You're a lie.
This is a fight.
Do what's right.
This is a fight to stay alive.
This is a fight for our lives.
This is a fight.
