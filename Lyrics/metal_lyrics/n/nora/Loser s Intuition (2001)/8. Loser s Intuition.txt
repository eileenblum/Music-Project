I've had better days.
I'm not good enough.
ENOUGH.
How do I know today won't be like yesterday?
Give me one good reason to get out of bed.

Turn it off.
I can't get this weight off.
It keeps me warm.
I can't hold this world up.
It's always on.

I can control this,
I can control this,
I can control this.
I HAVE CONTROL.

I'm not going to die today.
I'm not going to waste today.
I'm not going to die today.
How do I face today?

What if today is as bad as yesterday?
How do I get up the next day?
It doesn't matter.
I'll just end up here anyway.

Turn it back on.
It doesn't matter.
At least it's on.
Give me one good reason to get out of bed.
