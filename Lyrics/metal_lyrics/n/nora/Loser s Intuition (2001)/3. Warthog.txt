You've got to give to get.
I took too much to forget.
You've got to give to get.
Don't close your eyes.
You've got to give.
What the fuck?
My friend?
Did you think I'd forget?
You had a chance,
We have the scars,
We had the dream.
They stole the dream.
They took the stars.
It's all we have.
You had a chance.
We have the scars,
We knew the world.
They stole the dream.
They took the stars.
It's all we had.
It should be ours.
You let it come down around you,
There's nothing under there.
I'm afraid I have to close my eyes;
I have to be selfish.
I hope you know we love you my friend.
What the fuck?
My friend?
What did you think, my friend?
I'd never walk away, my friend?
I remember what you look like standing, my friend.
I remember.
