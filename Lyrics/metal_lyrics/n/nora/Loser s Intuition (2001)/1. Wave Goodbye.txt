I'm doing alright with my convictions.
How are you?
You're like everyone...
What if you are everyone?
You climbed a bone ladder to the top.
Can't see the sun, can't feel the rain.
I noticed you aren't breathing.
Wave goodbye, I'm doing all right for myself.
Stand up on top of everyone around you and don't see anything.
Well, I guess it's fucking dark up there;
and what you don't hear is your heart.
It's lonely at the top.
(What you don't feel is)
Your mind living and what you don't feel is your spine bending,
Your back breaking.
I got no interest in fighting my way through all the compromises you left 
behind.
But they do.
Watch out for their foot in your back.
They're as blind as you are,
They're as dead as you are,
And you're in their way.
