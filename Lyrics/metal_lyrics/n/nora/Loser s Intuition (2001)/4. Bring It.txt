Running out of reasons to try.
Running out of things to say.
Running out of smiles to fake.
Running out of ways to lie.

Running out of reasons.
What the fuck am I going to do?
This is my life.
What the fuck am I going to do?

Too busy to hit bottom.
I don't have time to burn out.
I live to toe the line so bring it on.
I'm not interested in conciliation.
I don't have time for sympathy,
And I hate surprises.
If this is it then let me know.
If it's gonna get worse I can take it...try me.

It's the best that I've got.
Make it enough.
It's the best that you'll get.
Make it enough.

I don't have time to hit bottom.
It takes too long to climb back out.
I don't have time.
Bring it.
