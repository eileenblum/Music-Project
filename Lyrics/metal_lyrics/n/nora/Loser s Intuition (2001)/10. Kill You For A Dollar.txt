How do we act like this?
We've left each other behind.
Walked away from our own,
Left them alone,
Self-satisfying our desires from the top of another's back.

Liar.

Reduced yourself to this.

Lair.

There's nothing on the top of a pile of our own,
There's nothing on the backs of our friends,
There's nothing to our desires when we win like this.

Have you ever seen the eyes of a man,
As he's betrayed by his friends?
Have you ever seen him cry?
Have you ever seen his eyes?

Because every day we are beaten down,
Stolen from,
Lied to,
By our friends,
By our own,
By our fellow man.

It could have been so much better than this.
