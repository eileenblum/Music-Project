I just watched somebody die.
I just swallowed another lie.
I don't want to see people die.
I don't want to swallow another lie.
It's time to own up to what you said,
To back up what you've done.

The TV screen - you want something from me.
The TV screams - you need something from me.
The TV screen - you want something from me.
The TV screams - you need something from me.

Another life, another lie, mass murders of the mind.
I don't want to be afraid.
Another life, another lie, mass murders of my mind.
I don't want to be afraid to go outside.
This is why we hide.
This is why we die.
This is why.
