You're standing on my throat. I can feel your foot crushing my throat. I'm breathing through my eyes, and they're fixed dead on you. You're standing on my throat. I can feel your foot crushing my throat. I'm breathing through my eyes, and they're fixed dead on you. I see everything you do, I see every move you make, I see everything you do, I see every move you make. Things you do, move you make, things you do, move you make. Thought you had me cornered in my room, thought you had me, took all my reasons. Thought you had me, good as dead. I'm not dead yet, I know a secret, I'm not dead yet, I know a secret. As you killed her, Jeanette told me a secret, I got it all figured out now, this time it's my turn. I'm coming for you. I'm not dead yet, I'm not even fucking close, I'm not dead yet, not even fucking close. I'm just watching, I'm just watching, just watching, let up for a second and I'll tear your fucking throat out.
