I didn't wake up this morning, because I never fell asleep last night, It's basically useless. You can't get away from it and no one ever taught me to live with it... All these things, all these situations that take my days, they don't matter, they don't matter, wouldn't it be nice if they didn't matter. Somedays all that matters is tomorrow, not me or you to today, just tomorrow , just tomorrow. I think I did something wrong, and I think I did something, and I think I did something, and I think. I think I did something wrong, and I think I did something, I think I did something, and I think I. I think it's getting to me, I think it's this town, I think it's just me.
