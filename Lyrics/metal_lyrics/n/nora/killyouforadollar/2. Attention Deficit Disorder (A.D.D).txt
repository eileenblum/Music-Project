I wonder how much is to much, what will it take to bring me to my knees? I wonder how much is to much, what will it take to bring me on my knees? I'm trying so hard, as the days get longer and my eyes are dragged to the floor. As the day get longer my eyes are dragged down, through this eternal.. I walk alone. I've traveled thousands of miles in my mind, just to watch it all crumble down. We spend our lives, our lives learning things no one ever showed us. We spend our lives learning things... We spend our time, our time learning, we spend our time leaning things your way. No one ever showed us what to do, no one ever showed us what to do, no one ever showed us what to do. Fuck you, i'll do it alone.
