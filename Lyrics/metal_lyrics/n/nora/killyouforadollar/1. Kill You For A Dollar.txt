How do we act like this, we're left each other behind, walked away from our own, left them alone, self-satisfing our desires from the top of another's back. Liar, reduced ourselces to this, liar. There's nothing on the top of a pile of our own, there's nothing on the back of our friends. There is nothing to our desires when we win like this. Have you ever seen the eyes of a man as he's betrayed by his friends, have you ever seen his eyes, have you ever seen his eyes? Because everyday we are beaten down, stolen from lied to, by our friends, by our fellow man, by our own. It could have been so much better than this. It could have been so much better than this.
