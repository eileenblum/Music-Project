It consumes my thoughts and haunts my solitude, we cover it up as best we can't hide ourselves. Hope and ideals are just that, but the pain and the sorrow is real. We can't see it coming but I know where it's been and I can see what it's done and I know how this is going to end. Eventually all our pets will run away or die and then where will we be. Creation was kind and we learned to live on lies and I wish I could feel the other way. I feel the pain. Our smiles are lies, our smiles are lies, our smiles are lies, shouldn't we be ashamed..
