look outside as the world is dying. 
look inside half of you are dead. 
look outside you want a reason. 
hell on earth with the angels dead. 
living life under the shadows of illusion.
protected by others from the horrors of ourselves.
threat of destruction by our own twisted creations. 
ignore the warning cries from the strawmen who failed us.
die for your dollars, die for your leaders,
die for your religion, die for your car. 
die. (x5) 
The scarecrow walks tonight. 
stop killing ourselves or tomorrow we'll wake up dead. 
look outside as the world is dying. 
look inside half of you are dead.
look outside you want a reason. 
hell on earth with the angels dead. 
die for your religion. 
die for your country. 
die for your faith. 
your death was a waste. 
hell on earth.
