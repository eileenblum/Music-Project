what could I ever say to you to stop you for a moment? 
when it's every day and it's every way and 
I think I might explode from the adrenaline. 
[Don't say I'm wrong.] 
you say my dreams are wrong and my ideals are flawed. 
refuse. 
I won't stop trying. 
you don't care, you don't try, 
but you're always there, in the line. 
fuck you, I am the better man, 
I'll give you all the chances that I can. 
smile as you cut me, thank you as you smash me,
grit my teeth as you crush me, scream aloud as you silence me. 
but I don't think it's you, it's the you I'll meet next time, 
and the two I'll meet tomorrow. 
the never ending you line. ... no matter what it's always you.
