I remember everything you said to me, 
I remember every laugh you laughed at me, 
I remember how you used to look at me, 
I remember everything you did to me, 
I remember a decade later, 
my neck still hurts from staring at the floor. 
I always wanted to see myself run in slow motion. 
it's my turn. 
what I meant to say.
what I meant to do. 
what I meant to say. 
what I meant to do... to you. 
A decade later, my heart still hurts form staring at the floor. 
I always wanted to see myself run in slow motion. 
you never let the weak go by. 
you never let the small man walk. 
I never let that memory go. 
I'll remember until the day I die.
I want ten years you took from me.
