what am I standing here wearing? 
what am I sitting here watching? 
what happened to let this happen? 
we're just trying to be ourselves, 
to be yourselves. [but] someone I, 
I let you die. 
someone I, I didn't try.
scorn reigns deep in the soul without recognition. 
sweatshops. 
bankers. 
politicians. 
all murderers. 
so deeply ingrained, so simply accepted, 
but still (unconscious) reality that kills. 
and we're just trying to be better than that. 
to get to tomorrow, and maybe someday, 
my waking up and living won't have any effect on you. 
I swear I'm trying. 
and I let them... and you them...and we let them... kill you.
