I shouldn't have said that
What was I thinking, what was I doing?
Where did I go wrong?
I walked so far and followed for so long
Just to say the wrong thing
It's going to be a good time
But I know you're not coming
Set it free if it loves you...
It's not coming back
I've lost weight and I look pale
But you look good, I couldn't help but notice
I've lost weight and I look pale
But you look good, I couldn't help myself
Just like last time, just like this time
Just like next time, just like the last time
I was your number one god damn fan
I was the best friend you never had
I was your number one god damn fan
I was the best you'll never have
Is this supposed to make it better?
If you're gonna burn it, burn it all
Burn it all and walk away
What was I thinking, what was I doing?
What was I thinking, where did I go wrong?
What were we thinking, what were we doing?
What were we thinking, where did we go wrong?
I haven't been sleeping but I've been dreaming
I haven't been eating but I've been thinking
I've found the best place in the world.
