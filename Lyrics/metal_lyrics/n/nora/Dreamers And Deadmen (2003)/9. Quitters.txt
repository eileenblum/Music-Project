I can write you a list of everything
I've ever done wrong
Because it's always on my mind
But I already forgot what I did right today
What a sad way to live
Self absorbed and wasted
Did you do something right today?
I can tell you what I did wrong
I wrote this song
What makes the wheels in your mind turn?
Lobotomize ourselves with work and television
You're looking forward to never thinking again?
Forget it, quitter
What did you do right today?
