Go about your buisiness
There is nothing to see here
Go about your buisiness
There is nothing to love here
There's a storm coming, lock up your windows
Go about your buisiness
There is nothing to see here
Go about your buisiness
there is nothing to love here
There's a storm coming
Lock your windows and bolt your doors
There's a storm coming
Give it a second and you'll see everything
You'll see
There's nothing to see
I've been falling asleep at the wheel
Daydreaming of insomnia
Have you been watching?
Cause I've been waiting
I never want to see the sun come up
I'm never going to be able to finish this tonight
My mind won't stop
There's a war coming and we're all out of heart
We're not ready for the last dance
I didn't save a thing
There's a war coming
And I didn't save anything for this dance.
