Last chance kids, it's time to rock
It's time to move, it's time to live
Last chance kids, before we're old
Before we're tired, before we give
If this is the last time we play the last song
Will you remember how you moved?
If this is the first time you heard a new song
Will you feel it, feel the burn?
I can dodge bullets and get up from any beating
I can be whatever I want when I grow up
Will you remember how you danced
And how you felt and what it was like to matter?
Will you remember what it was like?
Before we got old, before we got tired
Before we gave in?
Last chance kids, it's time to rock
It's time to move, it's time to live
Last chance kids
Before we're old, before we're tired
Before we give, last chance.
