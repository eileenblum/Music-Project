I took two and I didn't notice
It's still noisy as Hell
I took two and it didn't make a difference
I did the best I could
The sun doesn't always shine
And the good guys don't always win
All the promises that we broke
And all the lies that we were told
We'll go to bed
With the best and worst thoughts in our heads
And hope for sleep
Cause tomorrow you'll wake up beautiful
And all the people we made cry
Everything will be alright
We've walked through suicide
And come out on the other side
I'm worn down and wearning away
It's bedtime everyone
So I'm gonna take two more
All the promises we broke
And all the lies we were told
All the beatings that we took
And all the people we made cry
For all our friends who we left behind
Or we lost to suicide
We're never coming home.
