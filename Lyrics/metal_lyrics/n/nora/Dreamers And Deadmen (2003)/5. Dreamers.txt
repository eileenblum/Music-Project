I'm calling the sun
It only takes a moment for you to realize
You own it, it's yours
It's massive and brilliant and it's mine
I'll never look at the sky without it again
Smiling faces
I'll call the sun and show my best
The best of you and the best of me
What happens next?
What if we're not even close?
What happens next?
I can't wait to show you
What happens next?
It's the sun and it's ours
What happens next?
It'll never go out
I'm so glad I woke up this morning
Because I can't wait to see what happens next
What happens next?
You'll see.
