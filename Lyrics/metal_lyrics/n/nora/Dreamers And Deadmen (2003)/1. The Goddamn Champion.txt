I got a bone to pick with you
And I'm gonna pull it out of your ribs
You're not all you're cracked up to be
And I'm not big enough to walk away
You be the bigger man
We won't stay down
Because we're knocking down your door
Because we're burning down your house
I've got a gun to your head
And I'm asking do you wanna live?
Is this how you wanted it?
What's behind my eyes?
What's behind my skin?
Can you see in?
What's behind the barrel
I'm holding to your head?
I've got whatever it takes
And you came up wanting, get up
This is a love song, it's a sing along
I wrote it just for you
How long is your list?
Mine's about to get shorter.
