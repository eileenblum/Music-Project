Chaos feeds a bliss in me
Pleasure falsified
Self destructive intimacy

Craving digs my grave in lies
No one hears the inner cries

Chaos now presides in me
Evil archetype
Self inflicted hypocrisy

Fear, I meet, between the lines
Love, through pain, I try to find

Enter the chaos in motion
Repulsive, are, my emotions

In hell, I descend
As my coma rises
The mask of joy,
With shame, I wear
As I sink in demise
