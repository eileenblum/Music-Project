I'm in hell, can you feel my pain?
Can you feel my sorrow?
Can you see my will falling apart?

I can see clearly, my end
It crawls on me
My feelings turn in circles
Help! Help me!

They see my end
It crawls on me
My feelings turn in circles
Help! Help me!

The wreck of mind!

Pain, I shall bear, no more
Sadness, will be turned to light
Freedom of soul, I aspire
Happiness I'll find through...

A spark of life
