Thorns that pierce
Contemplative stone
In neon light
Blood and mud

Heroes and fools
Drenched in regret
And shame

It's all dust
And random chance

Dust and chance!

The locks that have no key
Ambivalent and free
Absent, distant
Plastic transcendence

Stripping your bones
Of dying flesh
Faces so pale
Claws so black

It's all dust
And random chance

Fathered by stars
Which shine no more

Dust and chance!

The locks that have no key
Ambivalent and free
Absent, distant
Plastic transcendence
