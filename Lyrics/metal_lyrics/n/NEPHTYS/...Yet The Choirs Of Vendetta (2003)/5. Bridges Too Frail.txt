As giants
In a kaleidoscope
Without grace
And without sense
Trampling the rainbow
With angry feet

Burning like beacons
Deep in the dark
Screaming and shouting
At deities gone deaf

Clinging to life
As if their own

Ignorance and virtue
Are bridges too frail

They share an abyss
In silent passion
On opposite sides
Standing alone

Blindingly brilliant
Superhero rage

Vortex suns
Colliding in rapture

Within
Parallel to naught
Unbridled brute force

Blindingly brilliant
Superhero rage

Burning like beacons
Deep in the dark
Screaming and shouting
At deities gone deaf
