Void of dementia
Clarity, illusion
Illusion

Smiling faces
Murderous gazes
The stylish savoir-faire
Of a pompous assassin

In minds that rot away, in pacing decay

Sin, delightful and warm, wine of the damned soul
Wandering in stupor

Smiling faces
Murderous gazes
The stylish savoir-faire
Of a pompous assassin

In minds that rot away, in pacing decay

Walls, cold and unforgiving, drink my blood
Mockingly, mockingly

Solitude's arms stretch far indeed
In strangling embrace

Like petals of nothingness...

The tragedy of the lovesick
In passionate distance
A comedy of gods
Blinded by arrogance

Singing of fire and flesh

They take us in their arms

The tragedy of the lovesick
In passionate distance

Singing of fire and flesh

They take us in their arms

A comedy of gods
Blinded by arrogance
