The touch of rubber and clatter of chains, electric pulses from the brain, the ardour flowing
Through the nerves, a passage to eleventh heaven, pulses travel through chaotic seas
Painting the eyes with different scenes, visions bouncing back and forth like laser beams...

The Sadovenus, open her veils, the veils to the art of pain...

Riding, diving, up and down the waves of pleasure and pain
Climbing, sliding, the black silver rainbow from skin to brain
The beauty of pain, the angel in chains, underlying monsters will exacerbate
The beauty of pain, the angel in chains, dark side of Venus burns like a flame

Deep in the dark abyss in the fountain of Sodom roars thye jailed beast under a thin exogenous web
Out of the dungeon the nightside calls, the beast crawls and the art unfolds
The man of moral and righteousness hides face in shame
