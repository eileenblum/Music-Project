There's a silence in this empty head that reaches the furthest corners
Til where my eyes can see there's utter emptiness and I'm crawling towards the border

Brooding gloom is everywhere, I'm mixing my blood with chemistry
Chemical shelter where the world fades out
I'm dodging the silver tears...
Haphazard run-ins with eternity
O'm soaring to touch infinity
Searching bounds of my wretchyed brain my soul squirms naked in red rain
This station lacks arrival, departures well at hand, queuing for destruction of demand
Blackened thoughts surround this cage of bone that shelters my liquid mind...

I'm searching...if only I could find an exit out of this misery...
I'm searching...if only I could find a way out of my private hell...

I'm swimming through the darkness where unknown horrors fly
Earth is far beneath me yet I cannot touch the sky
Here be monsters, far and near, celestial melodies that my ears can't hear
I'm falling down, I'm searing up and everything in between
I'm falling down, I'm soaring up between joy and spleen...
