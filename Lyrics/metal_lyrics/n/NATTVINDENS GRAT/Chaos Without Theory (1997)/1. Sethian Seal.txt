"Wande in peace O Great Pharaoh to the land of Osiris in the west
No one will disturb your peace without punishment, the brotherhood will guard your rest"

Under the burning desert sun seven men shoveled away hot sand
To discover the door to an ancient tomb where rested the one born of a divine womb

When the door was discovered they opened it with greed
They didn't know what was to become their destiny
The protector of this tomb was...
The Curse of the Netherworld, it wanted them dead
The Curse of the Netherworld, the Sethial seal

"We warn you vile intruders, do never break this seal
Let the God on earth rule this hall alone, do not defy the power of the ancients"

Without caring about warnings the men broke into the tomb with golden glitter in their eyes
The vast richdom theu carried away to their homes only laughing at the curse as a joke

For two weeks they enjoyed the life of a magnate
Until the breaker fell into a coma and couldn't be saved
He had defied...
The Curse of the Netherworld...

After his death the thieves started to drop like flies until even the last one of them had died
They all had defied...
The Curse of the Netherworld...
