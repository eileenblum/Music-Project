A moonbeam peeks down from the tiny window to greet me trying to create some light in this lonely darkness
In these halls amongst the gothic images I dwell, created by artists living when I entered this hell
Yes friends since centuries I've haunted here forlorn, I know every single brick in these castle's walls
Gargoyles on the roof are my only friends, only yearning thoughts can I to my beloved send

I yearn her warmth and the gaze in her eyes, though it has been ages since the world heard her last sigh
Still I'm sure we will meet whenever I reach the beyond between our hearts there has always been
An unbreakable bond...

For centuries I've tried to sove the secret of gold, until I manage I'm trapped in these archways cold
Ages back the lord I served gave me this task, must find the answer though it might forever last

All these endless nights I carry out experiments on how to make make gold
Confidence eroded, but still hard at heart I know I must go on
People passing by at night can hear me sighing for my life
I only want to know would the lord have cursed me if it wasn't his wife...?
