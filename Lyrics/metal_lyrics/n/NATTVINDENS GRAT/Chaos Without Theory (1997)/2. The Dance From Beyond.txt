When I lay down on my sheets and close my eyes
In sweat I wait for her to come and to enter my mind
Still one moment I always dive into sweet unconsciousness in the silence of the night...

The very moment I fall asleep my soul is torn off into a dream
A shadow with a female shape takes my hand and leads me
Over the forests and hills we fly among the clouds in nightly sky until we arrive at a glade
Where the shadows gather at night

The shadows dance in the night on the edge of two worlds, their foreplay to the kingdom come
The shadows dance in the night where past and present collide, the bridge for mortals unexplored

Between two elms I stand marroned on the edge of the glade
While waiting to get back I watch the shadow's obscene plain
Every now and then a flame flashes and washes away a few souls through the gates of hell where
He calls them to fulfill their fates

Twelve nights I've had this dream haunting me constantly by the dawn
She has always come and taken me back from this fantasy
But now the shadows surround me calling me enchantingly they grab me by my hands
And lead me towards the gates of no return...
