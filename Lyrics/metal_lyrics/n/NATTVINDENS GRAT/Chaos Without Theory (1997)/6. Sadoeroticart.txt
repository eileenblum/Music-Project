To catch the rays of the lunar aura, sepulchral vow of fullmoon
My heart pounds faster and bestial instincts arise...
I'm refusing to bow, looking at your world raising my howl
Without mercy or bad conscience I'll watch it die...

I have it in my heart I have it in my soul, every night the mankind's fall
Don't feel heavenly grace but inernal might when I come out looking for you
I hyave it in my heart I have it in my soul, force the people mystified
Feeding force of anger, power from within, I'm killing the human inside

"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law", weaklings never succeed never oh no...
The nights I gather anger, the days I hide the need, just waiting for dusk and come and
Glowing cold to arrive...
