Nocturnal mist falls down like the shroud of a ghost of centuries pass
I walk alone through the monuments of remembrance
This drizzle chills my bones as the sound of steps across my resting place
Pondering the questions should the accuser finally come after me...
Don't believe in saviour and now I know I never will
Touched by indifference, touched by the hand of fate unseen
Gardens of stone become a monument of my mortality, there is no heaven
Hell has always been right here with me...
Death is not the end, perhaps a gate to sleep eternal, I shall begin my journey to unknown

Calmness enthralls me, I see the beauty of her soothing hands
I sense the footfall, she enters and she takes takes me by my hand
The darkness takes me, lead through in the misty veil of tears I am at peace now
In love with the eternal rest to be...

My chilling friend you come for me, unhallowed end the rest to be
Calm as you come for me, I come undone right in your hand that touches me..
