Night fell upon the world
All there asleep but the rider
Birdsong echoed no more
Horizon bathed in fire

From behind the cloudwall they came
Myriad in numbers - the sky filled with flames
"Fires, be my guide! Show me there to ride!"
And the fires formed a sea
Showed him waves, pointed towards east
"There is my sign! Drawn on to the sky!"

Like the old man hath told
That night hath to be the one
When nature is asleep
The skyfires begin to dance

From behind the cloudwall they came
Myriad in numbers - the sky filled with flames
"Fires, be my guide! Show me there to ride!"
And the fires formed a sea
Showed him waves, pointed towards east
"There is my sign! Drawn on to the sky!"

Time passed so fast
Morning arised
The rides had fallen asleep
The first rays from sun
Opened his eyes
He knew not if he had been dreaming
He remembered the night
Skyfires dance
Something there was so enchanting
How could the fires
Obey his command
Come into his eyes dancing

With the mourning he rose
Strong was his faith - he would find
The answer to his question
Again returned the night to his mind

From behind the cloudwall they came
Myriad in numbers - the sky filled with flames
"Fires, be my guide! Show me there to ride!"
And the fires formed a sea
Showed him waves, pointed towards east
"There is my sign! Drawn on to the sky!"
