The path to home seemed so strange
Fades trees in twilight
Many things he remembered has changed
New people stared him like a ghost

He rode across the village
To the last cottage's door
There he saw two oaks standing
As proud as a century before

Suddenly he began to understand
The meaning of the signs
This is his home where he belongs
The answers he could here find
In vain he wandered across the lands
On and on and on and on
The nature showed the answer is
The two oaks...

The labyrinth was he quest
When thou enter there is no exit
To understand it took his life
He has only some weeks to cry

The meaning of oneself
Is searching only in vain
It is a secret of nature
And so shall it remain

Suddenly he began to understand
The meaning of the signs
This is his home where he belongs
The answers he could here find
In vain he wandered across the lands
On and on and on and on
The nature showed the answer is
The two oaks...

The nature told him so many times
How futile was his voyage
The echo, the sea - he did not listen
In dreams lieth his world

Suddenly he began to understand
The meaning of the signs
This is his home where he belongs
The answers he could here find
In vain he wandered across the lands
On and on and on and on
The nature showed the answer is
The two oaks...
