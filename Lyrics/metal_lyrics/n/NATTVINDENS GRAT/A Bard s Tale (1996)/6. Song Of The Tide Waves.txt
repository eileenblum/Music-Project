"Shadows are marching closer
The maiden in tower is getting old
Those years passed all of a sudden
The winds that blow are so cold
Autumn calls...

Thy wings can't fly
These wings can't bear thee high towards the moon
Thou see, the quest is not all
Thy wings can't fly
These wings can't bear thee high thou soar
"Tis worth it..? Hear the autumn call

Thou are the midst of labyrinth
Search so long - there is no exit
Say goodbye to the warm breath of summer
Northwind comes - skyfires are lit

Thy wings can't fly
These wings can't bear thee high towards the moon
Thou see, the quest is not all
Thy wings can't fly
These wings can't bear thee high thou soar
"Tis worth it..? Hear the autumn call

The answer is the two oaks in woods
The answer is the two oaks in woods
The answer is the two oaks in woods
Hear the autumn call"
