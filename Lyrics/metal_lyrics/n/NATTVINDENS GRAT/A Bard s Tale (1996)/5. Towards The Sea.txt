Through vast landscapes he rode
towards east
Until he felt the salty odour in his nose
The sound of waves come from far away
Under all thorns he found the rose
A moment later the infinity opened
Foaming waves splashing onto the sands
Notes began to surround his ears
Carrying message from foreign lands
So sang the sea...
