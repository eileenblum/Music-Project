Three miles east he found a molten gate
Entered through it into the unknown in fear
Enchanted his horse carried him to his fate
Across moors not to walked for a hundred years

In a cave of the furthest hills
Dwelleth a man so old
Has seen trees grow and fade
In the ancient lands cold
Keeper of the Stone of Ages
Knowing future and past
Stormwind his name, a soothsayer
His wisdom was vast

"What do thou seek?"asked Stormwind behind his cloak
"A path of life, the meaning of me"
"Why do thou wander then? The answer is two oaks!"
"I know, but now will I reach it? Lead!"

In a cave of the furthest hills
Dwelleth a man so old
Has seen trees grow and fade
In the ancient lands cold
Keeper of the Stone of Ages
Knowing future and past
Stormwind his name, a soothsayer
His wisdom was vast

"Stormwind the Soothsayer
Stormwind Set me free!
Stormwind the Soothsayer
Stormwind! Help me, please!"

In a cave of the furthest hills
Dwelleth a man so old
Has seen trees grow and fade
In the ancient lands cold
Keeper of the Stone of Ages
Knowing future and past
Stormwind his name, a soothsayer
His wisdom was vast
"Let me be and go!"
