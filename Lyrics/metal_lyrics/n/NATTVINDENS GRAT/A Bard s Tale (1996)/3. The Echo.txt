Into an ancient valley
He rode alone
Where the winds forgot howled cold
And where no man dwelt
There lived the Echo
Hath been for ages before man
The rider and the stallion were still
Everything was still

"Thou wanderst a ghost above thy head
No voices, no whispers
From earth below nor from heaven above
Inside the labyrinth - forever!"

The rider started downwards
And wondered
What could the Echo mean
By her magic words?

"Thou wanderst a ghost above thy head
No voices, no whispers
From earth below nor from heaven above
Inside the labyrinth - forever?"

The rider came up from the valley
Still thinking the words of Echo
He rode along a path through lowlands
All the way he heard the Echo repeating
herself
The further he rode the more quiet
became the voice

"Thou wanderst a ghost above thy head
No voices, no whispers
From earth below nor from heaven above
Inside the labyrinth - forever?"
