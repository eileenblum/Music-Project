Every time I look at you I know something you hate
Every feeling by your touch becomes a deadly sign
Everything I know
Everything I do
Everything I know
Becomes so fucking low
The perfect li(f)e I've been always working for
Ask me not to tell you why
Such need for perfect life
It's the way been grown up
Walking away from stinky mud
But through the days I killed
To catch the moral dream
I realise all in vein
Was the effort and the pain, for
The perfect li(f)e I've been always working for
