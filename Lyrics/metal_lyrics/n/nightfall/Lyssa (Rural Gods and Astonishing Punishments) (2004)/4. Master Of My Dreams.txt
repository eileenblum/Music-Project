Deep within the world of dreams
True desires reveal their will
But tell me why can I see
No more beauty in my dreams
Master of My Dreams I don't believe you
I am an absolute dreamer
Don't go too close to such a sinner
I hear they say to children attracted by my smile
I hear they say to children in search of true lifetime
I know you know we all been drow
But have to escape before the dawn
