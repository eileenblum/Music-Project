Empty soul in an empty place
Haveforlorn your adorable face
I know the one close to me is not the one you wish to be
Shut the door remain alone
Cold and ice, what perfect lies
I know the one close to me is not the one you wished to be
Father I got more to tell you, wait
I can only blame you for keeping away
The secret of life since birth of time
Rapid though again in front
All alone, tremendous fall
I know the one close to me is not the one you wish to be
Shiny face off left for good
Touch the deepest fade of blue
I know the one close to me is not the one you wished to be
Happiness, I wanna feel how it feels like
Misery takes on me each time
I try hard to resist
But seems I am already in the belly of the beast
