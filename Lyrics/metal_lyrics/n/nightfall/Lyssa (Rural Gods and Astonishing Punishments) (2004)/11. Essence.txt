Time to believe to the essence of the meanings
Time to come back to the roots of human learning
I call the winds to stand by me
Isolate my weak feelings no more to bleed
Hide the morning star, the hope from their eyes
Let them wait their son to rise
Lies
Never shall believe all truth is said
Never shall believe there is no end, to the pain they feed you
Try to expand the limits of your mind far beyond the logic's circle
Glad to see the motion in your eyes, so deep within
Analysing words that mean so much
You become a master of an ultimate art
You become the one and only
To tear apart theories once so solid
