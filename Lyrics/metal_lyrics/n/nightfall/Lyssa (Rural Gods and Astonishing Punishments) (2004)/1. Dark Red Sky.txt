To the sphere of darkness
I send my self to spread my race seeds
Enter into nothing
Inside a body made of evil deeds
Blame it all on you
The one who knew
That each day that passed
Gave birth to the age of rust
I am the one to save no
Dark Red Sky
It's so beautiful
Such a beautiful day to die
Why dying feels so good
Wonder what for we all stood
Destroy your symbol of trust
Come along to the cosmos of cerebral lust
I am the one to say
Shut your eyes begin to pray
As your life fades away
The only icon that remains is the
Dark Red Sky
