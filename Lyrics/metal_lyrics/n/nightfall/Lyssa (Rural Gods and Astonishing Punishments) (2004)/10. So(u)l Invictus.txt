Freeze the moment under lunar light my dear
Displace such view from the book of fear
Nail a lie that caused so much, nameless spirit now drives in lust
I feel almighty, I am almighty, I AM GOD
I am on fire, I am desire, I am the Sol Invictus
Share these moments of absolute glory
Never again for others feel sorry
Wait, wait my line have to finish first
I can feel I tell you your spirit's thirst
Rail at you nothing else can do
Rain gifts upon those who come true
