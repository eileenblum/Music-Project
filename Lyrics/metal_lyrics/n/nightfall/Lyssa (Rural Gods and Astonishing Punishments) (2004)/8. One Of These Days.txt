Pain, so much pain I can smell it everywhere
Love, where's that love by my mother had been told
Run
One of these days father will come to take you
Run
Run as fast as you can to avoid these days rush
Try to come back when this world again will be a piece of art
I know we are trapped to endless nothing
But just to remind you we have to hold onto something
Anything you feel satisfies the true meaning of our lives
As time passes by there's no room for the true meaning in your life
That sweet thing once you disliked
