How many times you considered life
Seriously, truly not just to kill time
How much I loved you you'll never know
How many times I dreamt of you you'll never know
All those momment there unite
All those momments stand to remind
Of the faces that cursed you sometime
But anger turned into generous vibe
I know you like staring at the sky
Lettin sun to blid your inner sight
Pray for you
Pray for me
Together we have
To take the trip
All the way down
To the magnificence sea
As life goes on feels like riding on a wild horse
Into your fields of eternal pleasure amd sweet dreams
