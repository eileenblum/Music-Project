[Efthimis KARADIMAS 1995]

Love is the realm of moon
Love is the gate to my ivory dreams
Love is the deep red wine I'm drawn into
Love is my eyes, diving in the lakes of thoy face

Love is the poison I'm dying to taste
Love is the highspirited thorn that keeps beauty pure
Love might be the reason you were born
Love is pain, and O' damn...
...I'm dying to see you suffer
