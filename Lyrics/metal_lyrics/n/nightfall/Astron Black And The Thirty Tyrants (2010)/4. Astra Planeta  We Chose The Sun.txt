Times where eyes come to rest
Elliptic shaped lights profile
Andromeda's solar breasts
So gigantic, monstruous, fire

Blast
The kiss of stars, explode
Galaxies unite
Inner hyper force to form

Dark surrounds the space
Lights suffer
Frequencies thrive
Grand buster
Dark clouds dominate my wrath
Approaching end of cycle
From coma come to life

We are about to fall [x3]
But we chose the sun
Sterling sun

We are about to fall
Believe it
We are about to fall
Can you feel it?
We are about to fall
Can't you see it?
But we chose the sun
Sterling sun

Play with your silent parts
A shadow ready to transform
Don't let your self in scripts of pessimism
Don't let it drown

Fate
Shows her ugly face
Stare at the sun now
An orison asks your grace

We are about...

We are about to fall (x3)
But we chose the sun
Sterling sun

We are about to fall
Believe it
We are about to fall
Can you feel it?
We are about to fall
Can't you see it?
But we chose the sun
Sterling sun

We are about to fall (x3)
But we chose the sun
Sterling sun

We are about to fall
Believe it
We are about to fall
Can you feel it?
We are about to fall
Can't you see it?
But we chose the sun
Sterling sun
