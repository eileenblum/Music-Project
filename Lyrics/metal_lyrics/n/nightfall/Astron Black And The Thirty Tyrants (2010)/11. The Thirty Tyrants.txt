Think of what we did to end up here
Who called the rain on the seed of fear
Supplement to life is to rule
All yours now is the role of fool

Now you all live under their command
Rulers to oppress, aspiration ban

The thirty tyrants [x3]
Rule this city with fear
The thirty tyrants

Athena

Light becomes so violent
We are all becoming silent

Stronger soon dominant and willing to protect Zeus child
His child is ours
Prominent against the tyranny of

The thirty tyrants [x3]
Rule this city with fear
The thirty tyrants

Athena
