Darkness
Fast, enormous
Fields desirous by luminous
Rings remain in tact
Light under black attack

On a dark terrain proclaiming snake defeat
Horses frenzy pace, forever so unique

Chaos
In absolute harmony
Apparent
Calmness remedy
In a sea of deep motion vibes move the universal notion

On a dark terrain proclaiming snake defeat
Horses frenzy pace, forever so unique
Spectral thoughts embrace the titan mega son
Tolerate pain you soon become the one

The first, the second, the third and then all
Dance in a serial of fiery response [x2]

On a dark terrain proclaiming snake defeat
Horses frenzy pace, forever so unique

Chariots of fire and liquid flaming tongues
Mark the sky blackness with emblem of the torch
