As from now I call you echo
Incapable to paise your ego
Navigate the pain
Tramp the fields of lame

Indecision weak in vision
Leading off another fall
Navigate the pain
Tramp the fields of lame

Inner stable lasting view
Don't forget the real you
The criterion in life
Creation is the true wheel guide

Walk against current advice
From nadir zenith to face
Navigate the pain
Tramp the fields of lame

The pleasuredome don't want for home
Creation is my only dorm
Navigate the pain
Tramp the fields of lame

Inner stable lasting view
Don't forget the real you
The criterion in life
Creation is the true wheel guide

We kill our saviors just to thrill
Those times of endless bleed we spill
Fed a life on great ideas
The greatest spring of luscious tears
The greatest spring of luscious tears
