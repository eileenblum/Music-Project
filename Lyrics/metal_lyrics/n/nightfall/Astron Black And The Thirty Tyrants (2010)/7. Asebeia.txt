Lies
Is the air you breathe
Seethe
Empty soul of purest greed
Evil seed
Fear shall regret the day
It entered that low man's lair
Mirror too refuse your face
Listen them
Demanding
Your fall from grace

Foe, foe
You are a revolting soulless foe, foe [x2]

How can feel they
Like a rainbow in grey
Sundress feelings burn
Facts burn like flame
Lured by will of mind
Motion kills the height
Nailed the wings of phoenix bird
Punishment to spread

Yes
Felt repress
In distress
Wanted gold, haggle our souls, sold [x2]

Foe, foe
You are a revolting soulless foe, foe [x2]
