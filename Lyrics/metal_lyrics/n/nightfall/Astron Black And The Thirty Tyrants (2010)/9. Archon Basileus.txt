Archon times leading manifesto
Glory shines chronicles absento
Million dive, chameleon cult
Solar grace, destiny of man

Neon signs show the way down
Maze calls
Brave soul no doubt
Furious storm spread fear hot
Bethlehem star
Friend of dark is not

Hold the flag
Never let us down
Victory
All crying out
Earth and sky and the stars bless thee
Father you of Hellene

Archon Basileus [x2]

Archon king, the world on its knees
Medal crowns, mass in total bliss
Tongues of honey, links the fumble division
Never in default, always with a reason
Heart of king, courageous and bright
Inspire all, push the fears aside
Seed the mass with hope and rightful will
Win the class, titan king

Hold the flag
Never let us down
Victory
All crying out
Earth and sky and the stars bless thee
Father you of Hellene

Archon Basileus era [x2]

Hold the flag
Never let us down
Victory
All crying out
Earth and sky and the stars bless thee
Father you of Hellene [x2]
