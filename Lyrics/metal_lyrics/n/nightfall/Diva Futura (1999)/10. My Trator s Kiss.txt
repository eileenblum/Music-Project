Humans, a race so bloody weak
Strange points of view that make me sick
On that cross they wear their faith all is lying
It's a confused world that's slowly dying

How many times I've felt betrayed
So many times I feel insane
I have an eye for them all, I grow strong

The traitor's kiss many missed
The beasts nobody dares to kiss
I'm just a child of this earth
That's how I got the traitor's kiss
