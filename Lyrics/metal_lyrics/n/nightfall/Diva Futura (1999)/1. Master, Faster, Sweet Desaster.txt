Sail in gray
Eyes stare at black
Snow in May
Love you feel but not for me you said

Out of love
I feel like dying
No more your touch
No more to life

The sun I've missed
I'm freezing
Lucid soul

You're killing me

Master, faster, sweet disaster

Hazy dream
Hazy life
Say saw the sun
I say you're lying

Why you denied you forgot you left by all those castles that
I built in the name of your light.
You betrayed what you created like a dream of a mid summer night

I feel, I breathe your skin your smell still haunts me,
I can't escape, I dream of you
Love, pain, emotional paint will never let your rust come through
