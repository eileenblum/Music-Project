Horny feelings haunt my mind
And I'm afraid I can't escape
How a dream can turn so black
Or it's again that female god
Or it's again that devil's mark

She's so real, full of beauty
Everlasting like hope, I hope

Please turn away and leave my tranquil mind
My christian flesh cannot stand a devil's night

Liar, you wanna kiss her
Liar, you really feel her
Liar, you wanna love her, that's you the moral face

Horny feelings haunt my mind
I am afraid I won't escape
How a dream can be my dope
Or it's again that female god
Or it's again my female god

She's surreal, full of beauty
Everlasting like hope, I love her so

Please turn away and leave my tranquil mind
My moral eyes cannot stand your sinful sight
