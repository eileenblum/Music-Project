Do you remember when we both watched the stars
Can you recall the thoughts we did for their airy dance
It's what I'm doing now with my own life;
I make it fast, I make it lust living for the moment's light

I've missed the days; I've missed the nights
I've missed the sun, the moon my life's flaming eyes
I ride the wind, I touch the stars, I blow away
I wanna taste what fairytales say

My life, I feel her vibes she makes me shine
My life, fulfils my soul, she makes me strong
