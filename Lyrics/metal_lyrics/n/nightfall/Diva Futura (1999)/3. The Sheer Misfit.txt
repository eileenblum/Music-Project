Please teach me father how should I love

When all love is gone I feel another nail in my hand

Hold me mother I think I'm lost again
Words so many words try to warm me up but still I'm cold
Lies so many lies to compose my life's song

Please sister help me I wanna live

When all love is gone

Please brotha help me a bright star to be

A sheer misfit it's what I am, a black flame, my soul burns
