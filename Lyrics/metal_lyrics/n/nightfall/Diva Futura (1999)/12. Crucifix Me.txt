[Japanese version bonus track]

Show me what you feel sister
Show me what you need
Show me how much you want me
Your kiss my lethal dose will be

My lethal dose your love will be
Love me, kiss me feel me bliss me touch me kill me all I want is
You, my savior, please take me away from here
You

Dear goddess I feel you
I feel you deep in me
My soul reflects your body
My senses bear your skin your skin

My lethal dose your love will be
Love me
