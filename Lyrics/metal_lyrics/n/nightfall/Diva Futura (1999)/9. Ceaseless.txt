One million nights, for one million nights
I've been wondered about this world that shinny dream I turned dim and called
it life

One million lies, with one million lies
I stole that light from your eyes, made you cry, forgive me for I was blind

All those dreams that you've made now fall apart
And I'm the one the damned to blame for the thorns that surround your heart

One million days, one million days
I counted them all it's long the fall, but please don't ever, never leave
 me alone

One million suns, one million suns

You've denied for that love I tried to give you but never did at all
