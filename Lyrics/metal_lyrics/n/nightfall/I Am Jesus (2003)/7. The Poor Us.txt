We are nothing
We are looking like nothing
We are nothing I tell you
Just a big juicy nothing

The Poor...us

Hold me
Hole me tight
For I see no sun
That mourning star refuses to come

The Poor...us

Loveless nothing that's a song for you
Your poor old laughing is no more you

No more you...it's no more you
