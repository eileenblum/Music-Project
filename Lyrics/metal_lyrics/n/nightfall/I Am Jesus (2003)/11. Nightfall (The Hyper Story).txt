"The Rewakening"

Teardrops from heaven decorate my pity soul
With roses from the fields of the greatest lands I know

The sad of the day is passing away when the night arrives to blind the day
But the sad in your face remains there, it smiles at me

"The Renovation"

Teardrops get my thirst away, the question of time though remains
I am on my own in a smiley silly world and all that I see are anything but free
I won't ask you to join me twice, cause I know you ain't feel so nice
Recall the days of last and a glorious like forever past

Am I still here?

"The Attack!"

As Nightfall coloured the sky
I saw the tragedy in your eyes
