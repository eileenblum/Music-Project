Take me back to the golden age
Lay down to the empire of rage

I've never dreamt the life the share
I've never thought we could be the same

Burning mud on my nasty face
None will run in this bloody race

I've never dreamt the life the share
I've never thought we could be the same

Fear unites all the sheep of god
No reason why to deny their gold

I've never dreamt the life the share
I've never thought we could be the same
