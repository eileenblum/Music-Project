I am Jesus, this is who I am
Never died, never been a man
Stand by me under the stars
I love you, I envy your human scars

Hold me up, then push me down
Seize the pain of the clown
It's a day, I praise the night
Who said wrong ain't loves the right?

I am Jesus

It's the new, I am the old
It's the rumour, the untold
It's the good, I am the mean
It's the heaven, it's the sin

It's the beauty, I am the beast
It's the misery of your feast
It's the never, I am forever
And forever you are never
