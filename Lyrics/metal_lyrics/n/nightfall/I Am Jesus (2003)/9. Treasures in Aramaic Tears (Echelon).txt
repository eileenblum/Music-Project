Misery of looking things with no sound around
Moving people in a box with all hope a ground
Between that I feel and what I see
I am sure truth lies there in the oceans of the sea

Darkness means so much, I know, brother, you know
Empty glass I am drinking from, I know, sister, you know
Deep inside your karma I see my dreams to grow
From the house of light I know none will let me go

Hey, you can't stop me now, I feel so strong
Hey, you are down you know, from my ashes
I grow like I am reborn
