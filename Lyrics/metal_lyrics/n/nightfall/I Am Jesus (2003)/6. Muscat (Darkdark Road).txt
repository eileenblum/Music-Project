Dark sun you see upon it's nothing but your faith
Dark clouds that bring the reign
Each soul believe in vein

Feel the heat, it's my need to see the cosmic light
Feel the beat, it's the dream moral life denies
I'm the one, you are done, forget the human life
Let me scream, let me scream, I wanna touch the sky

Proud, loud, sound!
Pain, hate, fate!
