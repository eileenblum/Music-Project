You like this, don't you?
You love the sound of the blade
Crossing your tinny blue veins
Those lanes of life that you've never
Used and seemingly you never will

You know, the bleeding flesh has an aroma
A perfume I love to smell, a perfect mixture of sweat, blood and tears
Tears like the ones that blind your eyes
Fear takes over your inner site

Isn't it wonderful? Isn't unique to playing god for one moment?
Isn't it wonderful to practice it on you? Oh yes, it is and you know it

There is no god, nor laws in this travel my friend
It is just you, you, and you alone
Riding white horses, colorfoul rainbows
And flaming dragons all the way down to hell
Poison runs fast in your fantasies again

Don't lose your faith in you
Don't lose your faith in me
Don't lose your faith in us
Gone are the days of trust

Beautiful mournings never last too long
And the beautiful youth is most likely to follow their example
Tragedy is the sister of happiness and likes to visit her often
Don't open the door, let her out with the dogs of bark
Whent the best comes it's time to leave and a life full
Of unspoked desires and poor memories
Is a like a virgin body full of lust
Give it pleasure now, you will love it

I'm alone...father, I'm alone
I'm freaking out...cause it's my life I doubt
