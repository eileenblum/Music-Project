I know you are coming down to me
I know you are coming down to see how I feel, for you...

Never, for ever, the only dreams I've made are fake, like you
Fake all the perfect words you told to me, just like you...

I've never thought this light to be solid stone with no sign of life
The magical flash the fears reveal, as you remain there laughing

Diamonds flashing my eyes but blindness feels so good this time
The spirits dance all over my tired body, and the dawn, forlorn, for those who wait...

I've never thought this light to be solid stone with no sign of life
The magical flash the fears reveal, as you remain there laughing

Despite the pain you feed me, despite that mourning cry
You're still the one I remember, you're still my only smile

Silence...and my heart speaks louder than words
I am cold, sure I am, otherwise I can't explain my lack of emotion
I am absolutely frozen, it's you around
