Many ways exist to erase one's dream
Many people say the worst one is she
Never had a thought that this might be true
Till the bloody day I found out how wrong was you

I hate you, I hate your sunless smile

I see people dying in the name of love
Friends and brothers dancing in the love's dom
I used to be among the mesmerized ones
Till that bloody day I found out how wrong was you

I hate you, I hate your sunless smile!
