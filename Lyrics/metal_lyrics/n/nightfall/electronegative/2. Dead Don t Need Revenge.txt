Hello spider
My dear fellow
I think someday
I'll become like you

So many years
So many visions
And always
in deep blue

Tell me
Tell me
Do you remember
remember sun
Can you
Can you recall
Just a single
ray of his light?

Dead don't need revenge
Their world is a dance away from hate and pity suns.

Oh my dear spider
The world of light abandoned us here
I have you and you have your world
Please let me in, I'm afraid of staying out forever
