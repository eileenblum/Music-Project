What you know about me is
All those stars right above
What you felt for me was nothing
But still I do

Adore you like the night does the moon
Adore you everything, everything, everything is you

In your eyes I see the world
In your arms I feel so warm
By your touch I feel I'm blessed
Without you life makes no sense, my life makes no sense
