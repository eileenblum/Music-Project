[Efthimis Karadimas / 94]

Master one's grief
and I walk through dying gardens
Suffer martyrdom, enforced to admit my fate
I came across
abysmal
feelings never met, before
Audiece
thou adorned, ivy
of the thousand pleasures

Apologia's withering, words echoing in silence
you used to be the apple of my eye, a flame within me
my armful's bleeding as the fleshy aroma still disarms
me
and thorns become the carpet for my dream

Come apart, in my hands, be one with your emotions
lay down to the kingdom of the auburn one
imposing view, I'm dying of touch you deep
pain you shall feel, painful
odes to flay the untouchable skin
that I kiss.

Don't catch me as I fall, let me touch the end
let the seas to become charmy lakes, where my soul dives,
and as skies wispering my name, as clouds torn apart,
oh this misery fits me so great...but I'm lost, I feel it.

Eroding, the end shall be mine
Ogress, feel my vibes as you cry.
