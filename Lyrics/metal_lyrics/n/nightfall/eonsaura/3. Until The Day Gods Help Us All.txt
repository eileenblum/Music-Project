[Cover : Army Of Lovers, the original title does't have 'Until']

Stand to be found
Found to be guilty
A foolish game a crying shame
Over the hills
Down through the valleys
The evil eye an end to die

Until the day the gods help us all
Chained my heart shall stay
Until the day the gods help us all
Wipe the earth away

Rhythm divine
Breath of the forest
The trees hear sigh to heavens high
Cry of the whale
Voice from the desert
The evil eye an end to die

Until the day the gods help us all
Chained my heart shall stay
Until the day the gods help us all
Wipe the earth away

There comes a better world
A perfect place to live
The moment gods appear
Away this life I give

Until the day the gods help us all
Chained my heart shall stay
Until the day the gods help us all
Wipe the earth away

Until the day the gods help us all
Chained my heart shall stay
Until the day the gods help us all
Wipe the earth away
Until the day the gods help us all
Wipe the earth away
