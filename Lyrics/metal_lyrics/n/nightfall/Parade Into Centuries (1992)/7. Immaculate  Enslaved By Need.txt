[Music: Christian / Lyrics: Efthimis]

"Forcing" now your life
For ending it up in the sky
In the kingdom of your god
Far from earth's "trap"
Face now the end
As your flesh's gone ripped

In the sight of the sinners
Where we all belong for you
Rivers of tears, even Christ
Would have laughed with you

Rotten beliefs surround you with fear
And dust's what you're made of
Nonthinking mass
Being obsessed ny immaculation
Away from human needs
Love to "hate" your body
The place where your soul is rest

Temptations, the kinds of nature
Controlled by what's above, the sky
Rivers of tears are falling
Obsessions that torture your life

You're falling apart
In the hell of your god
Avoid the lies
With "sins" for you
My blesses to you
