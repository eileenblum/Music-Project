[Music/Lyrics: Efthimis]

Death and life in this world
It's not the romatic thing
Living now for just to die
And after death there's a life

Wishes and hopes for immortal life
But none can see the truth in sight
Failed to live in promise land
Mind and body to live apart ?

Cry now for the end
While you're lying on your bed
With angels upon your head
And demons to eat your flesh

Crying out the fear within
Believe it you not live a dream
No more gospels from above
Telling what's right or wrong

Join the life my friend
Living with us till the end
"Fallen angels" as they say
Is to live your own way

Live your life as a bird, away from the rest
Apart from those who are crying
Begging to survive

Proudly remain the same, even when
You're near the end
You don't have to cry, to go to paradise
