[Music: Christian / Lyrics: Efthimis)]

Variety of thoughts, deep within my mind
Memories from the past
Lost in the labyrinth in front of walls I stand
Fairies dressed in white the message is to die

Find the passage, the passage to the light

Lost in the labyrinth of image amd thoughts
Die, immortal lie, mortal pain
Damnation of the reign
