[Music/Lyrics: Efthimis]

Horror and agony, darkest brains reign here
Emptiness of "modern" life, sentence me to die

The vails of "black" and "lie" have been fallen
Front of eyes, in our minds, darker than the night
Destiny calls my nature, take me away from here
I won't die, I wanna fight, to build my own illusion

Corruption is not offence, but freedom always is
Creators of depair minds, rules of our lives

For my soul, when the dark fall into...
For my soul, when the dark fall into my heart
