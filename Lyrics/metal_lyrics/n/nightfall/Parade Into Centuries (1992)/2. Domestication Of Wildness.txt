[Music/Lyrics: Efthimis]

Nature reveals its warning sign
Rivers and trees helpless they're dying
Hidden from evil seeds all over around
In my kingdom of peace people aren't allowed

See what they've done, destroy the land
And nothing but pain is what they've got
Visions of lunacy with tombs all around
Burning flames desires for chaos

Beyond our sight and all of the evil minds
There where I rest under colorfull skies
The river I hear and my "Gods" appear
With kindful presents, eyes full of tears

Is what I believe, in power of mind
Near to people but out of their sight
Soon, I'll return back to my home
In nature of darkness where I was born

They try again to domesticate my flame
The feeling of wild, as before they tried
Believing in me, in my soul and flesh
Omit the pain, in peace I'll rest
