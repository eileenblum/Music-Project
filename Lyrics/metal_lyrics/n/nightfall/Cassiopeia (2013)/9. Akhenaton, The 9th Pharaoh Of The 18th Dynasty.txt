Thirteen hundred years before Christ's emerge
There was a pharaoh once raised his hands

Towards to the sky to his sole single god
Aton was is name, Akhenaton his man

Die old world
His greatness comes forth

One above the rest
Followers all be blessed

A man reckoned the weakness of his time
Profondly stepped in to the revise the prime

Ruler called the brightest star in the skies
Glorious sun released his rays and shined
