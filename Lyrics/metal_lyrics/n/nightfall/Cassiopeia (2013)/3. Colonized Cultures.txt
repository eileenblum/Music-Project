Under one god
Under one faith
Preconscious data reprogrammed
To unify means to obey

Destroy their tongues
Deny their grace
Repaint their flags with signs abstract
Reshape their face

Perpetual feelings so obscure
Subconscious vibes struggle to cure
Expansion slaughters with precise
A massive change of enormous size

Heavens are under...
New command robotized and colonized
Raw blood the alien phoenix rise

Cosmotheories adjust new gods
And values they trust
Cultures fail to react
Amalgam of fictions fact

Algorithms take full control
Scientific moral fall
Hyperhuman with no eyes
Only mouth to spell colossal lies
