The guards of rules, so dire / Never scorned, never tired
Flames come out of guns / Knives mark their lands

Stare the skies and pray your lord / Let us do the sneaky work
The arm of law is strong and bold / In the name of noble oath

God forgive them all, it is their thirst for striking mesmerizing gold

Hail to the Nightwatch

Honored to secure the rights in life / Faith, astounding, atrocious siren in white

Oath, the epitome of spiritual life / Loathe the symptom of grime

Glorious arms, shine so great / Power's taste defines their fate
The sun seems below their seats / Dramatic looks, resembling kings

Prepare your gear the worst to meet / In darkness lurks the evil deed
With dignity and pure beliefs / The Nightwatch created its myth
