[Based on Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream"]

[He is the king of fairies ans She is the fairy queen.
Their powers and skills forcefully turned against each other.
Like maniacs blinded by light of passion and haughtiness, they drag themselves to the lowest dungeons of nature.

Ceaseless passion between two beings.
Passion that unites before it destroys anything around if once unleashed.
We are nothing when it comes to sustaining our gratefulness in front of desire.
We are born broken in a diluted world poets' admiration cannot disguise.

None can break the broken.
Broken we all are.]

Oberon, king of fairies, husband of Titania
They collide for a child causing weather mania
Contra, furious nasty matching part
Calling wind, calling storm, calling thunder ram
Calling thunder ram

Fog, darkness, cold icy breathe
Spell expands, release seethe
Contra, furious nasty matching part
Calling wind, calling storm, thunder rams

None can break the broken
None can break the broken
None can break the broken
None can break the broken

Can't hold
Can't hold
I am sure I'll fall apart
No hope
No hope
The two cannot come one
Love lost
Love lost
Its beauty lost its class
The spell
The spell
I must regain my thrust
