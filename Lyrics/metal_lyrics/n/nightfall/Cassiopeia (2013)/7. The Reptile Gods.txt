Across the mountains and seas man knows
Under a volcano's golden stones
A breed of lizards with tongues like whips
Prepare the arrival of its kind king

Through fires they passe and dance strange songs
On trees they climb to watch the stars to fall

They laugh at stories about their race
Their children are taught to live with grace

Through fires they passe and dance strange songs
On trees they climb to watch the stars to fall

I don't want to tell you more
About this race of creatures born
Under a sign of burning crown

I only want to share with you
A minor detail-cum-brutal truth
These are the gods your world obeys

Born by fire

They love the flames

Salamander
