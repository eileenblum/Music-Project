Wonder minds unlock the Earth
Count the distance from life to death

Those minds' torque, superior swift
Reckon the power the world to shift

One hundred of hundred more
Myriads of numbers respect his call
Analyzing nature with virtuous pace
Correlate assumptions defining space

Mind, bright, right side, a bless that is to human kind

Ferocious nature been whipped
Throwing numbers, mind skim
Multiply tens with tens
Projecting space in human sense

The sand reckoner

Mind, bright, right side, a bless that is to human kind
