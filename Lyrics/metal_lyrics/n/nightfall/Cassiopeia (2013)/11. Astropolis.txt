Erase the memories of loss / From time the capsule set to toss
The vibrant journey in whirling space / The masterplan to save the race

Rise, arise

Landing on, our new sanctuary, our home

Above the skies / Where light hides
Behing cold spheres / A colony's dreams

An independant soul / Away from its mal past howl
A new beginning, new explore / A promise new offspring implore

Astropolis
