Morals / When life shows kindness / And gods serve your needs
You tend to believe that greatness / Apparently lies in your own genes
You tend to believe in your self / You tremendous mistake on Earth

Hubris

The words, the acts, the dreams, your past

Try to feel the pain you caused / Horrid end to lustful call
Decorate the grave of world / Enemies in wooden horse

Never forget / There where you start is where you return
Dust to dust / Replica stars, your pride is ruthless so does your final mar
You dream of heavens / Drown in lust / Furious burst

Hubris

The words, the acts, the dreams, your past
