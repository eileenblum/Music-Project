A fading life I deny
Your life to change, never fear

A star on fire calls my name
The breed survives, never fear

Growl, and pain expires
Believe my truth, karma sear

Growl, dominion sol
I move the Earth my dream to stall

Common people never dare
God and demons they fear

Common people, they forbid
The call of duty they fear

Growl, and pain expires
Believe my truth, karma sear

Growl, dominion sol
I move the Earth my dream don't stall

Across the borders of delight
The beauty's name shines so bright
The crown of flames burns my heart
I want to touch, to feel the sun

Immortal dreams lead my ways
The passage to the lands of grace
The soul of man, ethereal charm
Aggressive shocks pound like drums
