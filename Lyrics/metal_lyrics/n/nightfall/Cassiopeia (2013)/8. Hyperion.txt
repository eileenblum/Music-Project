The titan beast in flaming suit / The lord of light, the saturn's moon
The father he is of dawn and sun / Beneath the realms of moral man

Blast, above the spring of cosmic dust
The hordes of monster rays ram

Selene and Helious form the bridge / The darkness passes through the rim
Defending beams protect the world / The tongues of flames resist the cold

Hyperion
