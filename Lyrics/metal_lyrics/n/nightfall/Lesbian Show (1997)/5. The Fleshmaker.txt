[Efthimis Karadimas/Nightfall 1997]

Tell me, have you ever touched the edge
Upon the highest top, there where life really ends
Wind to kiss you like a seaman does the whore
As life leaves you like wave does the sea shore.

Passion for passions and vanity remains
Quest for tranquil space, panakea for pains
Somebody calls but body is one with the wind
Somebody cries behind but you don't bleed.

Finally I approach the port of my desires
Faces of strange attitudes look so bizzarre
Nothing seem the same to lands I've reached before
Misery's queen falls in comma as you pass ny door.

Not far from what I was looking for you seem
The point of no return I step and conquer my dream
I'd hold my ships course until the unknown end
In promised lands, my oath was, my self to send.

The crown of the immortals now you wear
The throne of this bloody land you share
With millions and millions old brothers' fate
Hail to you and this glorious state, of death

You don't need
You don't bleed
You don't feel
You don't breath
You don't live
You don't dream...
