[Efthimis Karadimas/Nightfall 1997]

I want to dive in a cold lake
I want to kiss her lips
To reborn by her liquid womb
Deep within in hazy mist.

My life I'm dying to finnish
In this dream I can't resist
What I've adored, it left me by
Like child I cry...

Loving you at the edge of madness
Missing you in a spark of sadness
Drowning me in full blast sorrow
Love affair in horror.

Hate hangs me, I cannot weep
Love left me but still I dream
Breath on mirror stinks it black
Alike the sperm of mine my soul you sucked

More of what I've known
I want to know now
In muddy waters I've been drowned
New life... calls me now.

That lovely face I need to see again
That milky neck I want to break.
