[Efthimis Karadimas/Nightfall 1997]

I've standed between east and west
I've made friends the south and the north
The charmy sea now I call as a nest
The precious ground offers me strength and growth.

One God, No Godess
On eground, no sea
Death jealoused your beauty
And stole you from me.

Strange nature, cold as ice
So warm for me, your touch, your eyes
White in black and black in white
This furious spirit once has my bride.
