[Efthimis Karadimas/Nightfall 1997]

Ask me to draw you one million suns
Why your eyes remind me of the rain it comes ?

It is that sky that folds you
It is his strength
It is that promise I gave you
Forever hold your hand.

Feathers die as crow shot down
But the soul remains
My dreams are made to pass away
As on morals' happyness I seize.

Death star let me blast with you up there
Let me touch at least your breath
Let me be your flaming rear
Let me fold our end.

Is for the dusk your life always lies with
It is the life it self that ruins your delicate dream.

Enough, enough, ...

I played with life
She played with me
"I love you" said, then kissed me
I wanted more, I wanted more
But life refused to teach me.
