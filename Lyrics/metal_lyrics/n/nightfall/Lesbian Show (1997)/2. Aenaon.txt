[Efthimis Karadimas/Nightfall 1997]

Across those bridges far beyond
Once upon I walked, but never more
To Roads of marvel some say they lead
Bitter humans who patiently bleed.

I recall the thoughts my mind captured
As from the bridges high I stared the world seemed raptured
My teeth rapidly moved as skin turned red blue
No cold then raped me but the bloody time's crew

I stared at sky, no can't be true
I kissed the earth, no can't be true
I released my will, I thought I knew,
I thought I knew,
But...

Life, slowly fades as the reader turns the page
For this bible of vain morals pray
Life, slowly fades as the reader turns the page
Like a peace of paper in reign.

Live loner and then die
The lands you dreamed, so you will find
The voice inside me wisely spoke
Hell, vanity's statue my gyues I broke

In state of pleasure now I walk
No saviours doors I'm forced to knock
My fate is built upon my own
Fools grasp the thorns, I keep the crown.

Life, ...
