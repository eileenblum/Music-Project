[Dedicated to the one and only mother earth "_Dan_".]

You mother, you bear me by fire
Into the lake of the abyssic dark
There where no light shines, nor even God's fire
Upon the stones, upon the great rotten ark

Set me on fire, thou shall be the King
The chosen one who rises the kingdom
Power to us for rest enthroned, never bleed
Upon our slaves, our servants, our followers
...See no freedom

Oh mother, you gave me birth
Resting together with the stars
The oriental's night, the desert's cold on earth
Feel me night, I'm stronger, feel my "arms"
Resting in peace, in silence
My ears still blown by the battles, in past
The heads I've taken, the blood I've drunk
And the beautiful bride, lady night I've been married once...

Mother of all Gods, mother of mine
Oh dark queen, oh earth of wisdom
In your hands I'll lay again, as my old sword shines
I've taken the baptism of fire, of thy wisdom
