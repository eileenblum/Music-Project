[Dedicated to the dark "Goddess" ATHOR.]

Oh my lovely sharping night
Stay with me forever
The eyes of my soul, blindness
Dark Goddess make me yours
I'm making you mine

Oh, you, you're mine
Stay forever, eternally we rot
Step away from, feel the end
My end and yours together
Eternally together
Flashing shadows dancing, bit me, suck me
The morning of the mourning
To the breed of night I do belong
On the majestical tunes of fleshing beats
Of rot I lay on

As your god is failing once again
In stealing the treasure of man's inside
My soul, my heart, what I've so far learned
I'll set my soul on fire as I die

Die now my dear, join me
Kill you, kill you, feel you, kiss you
Bloody dying body
You're finally mine
