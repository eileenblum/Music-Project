[Inspired partly by the ancient greek mythes of the King AIGEAS;]
[one of our glorious ancestor.]

Alone as I'm staring
The beautiful sun goes down
Thinking of the wisdom I'm carrying
And the vanity of my crown

As a king I've lived so far alone
The image of a God I've been hold
With my power surrounding my throne
But my body's already gone old

"Here I'm waiting, oh God
Please receive the soul of mine
Take me from the earth's dark
Make me holy by your sign"

"C'mon you fool; where are you "God"
Where are you dog?
Where are you damn bastard, lier, lier, ...lier..."
As the waves smashed like dreams on the headstones
My soul is flying, I left my bones
On the earth's weird ground of greed
Another kingdom to create, by my holy seed...
