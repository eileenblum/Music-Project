[Inspired by my dreamy golden voyages to the lands of my deepest desires.]

Enter its kingdom...
Fear is conquering my body, touch my hand
My soul of sorrow is blessed
Cry now for holyness, my flesh turns into dust
Lying the cold axe upon my naked chest

Fearful eyes staring to nowhere...
I feel the rainfall that breaks the silence
Paucity, paucity of love, enlight, see the
Propensity of my ego to the hands of black
Lord, within anon I fly, seeing...yarn
Crock, I'm falling in, sacrament, I
Drink the conium from the altar

Falling into the fields of silence...
Concede with fear, the burning swan
Song, in a sea of tears
My ancestor ones, ever lost, I find
Nonentity the nostrum, nonsectarian

Failing from the enormously cataract...
Into the lake of fire...
Welcome to the lake, the forest of your
Dreams, the place of the Nil
Burn, I'm lost into the silence of the
Lustrate, my arms are useless and eyes create
Pictures of my conscious, as my soul turns
Inside out
What a bless, what a blaster the experience of
Pain... to feel inside
The war, the battle, the flesh
Which has gone rapped

Soul remains...
Rotting flesh and hopes a step
Beyond the threshold of the everlasting temple...
I cry now for holyness, my flesh
Turns into dust
Lying the cold axe upon my naked chest
Sear, I conquer my fear, I love it
... Yell
I'm an angel in gold and take my
Share, eternal's pie

Let my soul fly in memory...
Cry for the deadly inner flash I
Had before
As I creature of the dark, blind
Useless mortal sense
As I died I left, I throw my
Breath and flesh
