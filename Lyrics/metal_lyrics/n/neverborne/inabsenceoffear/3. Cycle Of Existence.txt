You can scream from the top of your lungs till they bleed raw
A soldier of your own misfortune and greed
Ignore
Tell tale signs surround every breath
Every movement every step 

As you forge through this life the darkness surrounds you
Emptiness despair, these feelings consume you
Are you alive, are you even inside

Breathe in now 
All around me hell
I live for something I wonât die for nothing!

You lie awake theyâre deaf to your prayers
In this existence, your torment lies without you not within
Give in no more
No more

Rely, on no one, nothing no more

Breathe in now 
All around me hell
I live for something I wonât die for nothing!
