This is the first day of the rest of my life
No more will I give in to bitterness inside
I stand tall before all my enemies
My life the barricade that brings you to your knees  
I stand tall before all my enemies
My life the barricade that brings you to your knees 

Bleeding, falling back down in my own hell
Crawling, rising, eternity will deliver us
We will not be broken
Your dying lies undone
I will not be driven

We will not live through you, in defiance the fucking truth
Driving and pushing harder no remorse we will not falter
Truth will not die in vain; your lies in time will fade
Rising above deception, noose is tied time for reflection
Truth will not, die in vain; your lies in time will fade
Rising above deception, noose is tied time for reflection

Bleeding, falling back down in my own hell
Crawling, rising, eternity will deliver us
We will not be broken
Your dying lies undone
I will not be driven

This is the first day of the rest of my life
No more will I give in to bitterness inside
