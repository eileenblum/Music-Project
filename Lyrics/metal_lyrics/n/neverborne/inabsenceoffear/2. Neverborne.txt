Between heaven and hell, thatâs where youâll find my lost soul
Give in to temptation, there is no in-between for sin,
I live with my own thoughts now
And dream of salvation how
I thrive in the absence of fear

In time, nothings ever clear
I fight through the absence 

Drowning in my own lies, a step forward is always one more behind
Everything Iâve come to believe in is taken away from me dead and not breathing
Times changed me forever 
Thereâs nothing left for this hopeless sinner, remain remorseless 
Push on forever and forget the rest

Blood stained my hands remain, is there no pleasure through pain?
Torture the procedure
Thereâs no denying now itâs clear
I live with my own thoughts now 
And dream of salvation how
I thrive in the absence of fear

In time, nothings ever clear
I fight through the absence 

Drowning in my own lies, a step forward is always one more behind
Everything Iâve come to believe in is taken away from me dead and not breathing
Times changed me forever 
Thereâs nothing left for this hopeless sinner, remain remorseless 
Push on forever and forget the rest

I live with my own thoughts now
I dream of salvation, how
I thrive in the absence of my lifeâ¦.my mind
