As the sun sets it casts a shadow
Another falls another born tomorrow
Born with an enemy
Of which you may never see
It lives and breathes within
Consumes your everything
Within the darkness
Your scars are hidden
Become the night, consume the day
Your life is just beginning

Down where the lies are taken
Blind to the fire and torment
We are not dead to the flame
We go down, we donât know how
Fear of the gods weâre driven
Gone, bye tomorrow
â¦on god-forsaken grounds

Ignite the flame, don't waste your life away
Adapt to the unknown
Become the sickness embrace this
love lost gone forever
i remember the one who never forget
the day you taken the ones i care for
sorrow inside it drives me further
I wept no remorse forgotten the day forgotten tomorrow

Dark brings deep shadow
Comfortably in grace
Where love dies, dreams decay
Everythings in place

Down where the lies are taken
Blind to the fire and torment
We are not dead to the flame
We go down, we donât know how
Fear of the gods weâre driven
Gone, bye tomorrow
...on god-forsaken grounds

Live life for you
Push on
The lies they will drive you
Live life for you
Push on
The lies they will kill you
Live life for you
Push on
The lies they will kill you
