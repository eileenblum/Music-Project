Glass optics beneath the blackness
Hide from the world you once knew
Escape, elude, break free 
Ablaze in this wreckage of life

Forgotten, by the way
Death to one devoid of misery

Never fail to falter
Stumble on an everlasting high
Frail forgotten forgiven
Rundown from inside
Never fail to falter
Stumble on a never ending sky 
Frail forgotten forgiven
Rundown as I die

I crave for comfort, relieve me
The search for solace on
Face your fears dispel me
Ablaze in this wreckage of life

Forgotten, by the way
Death to one devoid of misery

Never fail to falter
Stumble on an everlasting high 
Frail forgotten forgiven
Rundown from inside
Never fail to falter
Stumble on a never ending sky
Frail forgotten forgiven
Rundown as I die
