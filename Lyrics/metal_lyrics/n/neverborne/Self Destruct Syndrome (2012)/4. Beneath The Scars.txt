Dust to dust, in needles I trust
My body my temple, my temple my hell
Ashes to ashes I fall to the ground
Bloodstained and broken, no one hears a sound

Die each day I wake a little more everything falls apart
You left me here alone like this
 Abandoned life and took your last breath

Trust in me, you will never be the same
Take it all kill everything
Iâll drag you down until thereâs nothing left
Exposed alone

Try as I may, forget dissolve this hate away
It stays the same
Where did you go?
Why did you leave me this way?
This nightmares real a living hell alone now that youâre gone

Dust to dust, in needles I trust
My body my temple, my temple my hell
Ashes to ashes I fall to the ground
Bloodstained and broken, no one hears a sound

Die each day I wake a little more everything falls apart
You left me here alone like this
Abandoned life and took your last breath

I am, so far away lost in the emptiness
Never again, never the same without you
Everything is grey
Turn my back and walk away
Iâll hide my scars for one last day

Call it what you will
Each day I live through my own hell
Call it what you will 
This is the only life I know 

Die each day I wake a little more everything falls apart
You left me here alone like this
Abandoned life and took your last breath

Push the pain away
Never look back bury the memories each day
Nothing remains I am to blame
