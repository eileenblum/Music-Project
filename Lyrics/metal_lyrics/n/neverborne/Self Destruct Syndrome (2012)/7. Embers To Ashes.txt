Truth begins today
The lies lay shattered on the floor
Exposing all your shame

You werenât born a sinner
This life made you who you are
You canât judge a book by its cover 
But you can judge me from the scars

Burn it all way once more the life you gave 
Embers to ashes
Bare these scars forever more forever torn

Are you proud of your creation?
Am I everything you hoped Iâd be?
A manifestation of the chaos
The pain youâve caused no one will see
Youâve stripped me of emotion and molded me from hate
I live and breathe the torment thereâs no escape from what Iâve seen
What Iâve seen
How can I forgive, how can I ever forget

Burn it all way once more the life you gave 
Embers to ashes
Bare these scars forever more forever torn
