Today, is the last day canât take any more
Driven me away, taken this too far
Itâs always the last time Iâve heard it before
Everything I am, always wanting more

Peel away the lies all youâve given me is emptiness inside
Shallow be thy name all youâve given me is hurt so deep
My darkest days

Lifeâs wasting away with you by my side
This tide has taken its toll and Iâm drowning so fast
Thereâs nothing to hold on to but you

Thorn in my side in my life 
Is it murder if its pleasure that I gain from the killing 
If I ended it
Today is the reckoning this is everything you deserve
Where love runs dry Iâll be right there this is goodbye

Lifeâs wasting away with you by my side
This tide has taken its toll and Iâm drowning so fast
Thereâs nothing to hold on to but you

Now that youâre gone it seems so unreal
Everythingâs lost but I know I can feel again
Start it all over, forget everything

You are the reason Iâm broken Iâm lost
You are the reason Iâm broken Iâm lost

Lifeâs wasting away with you by my side
This tide has taken its toll and Iâm drowning so fast
Thereâs nothing to hold on to but you
