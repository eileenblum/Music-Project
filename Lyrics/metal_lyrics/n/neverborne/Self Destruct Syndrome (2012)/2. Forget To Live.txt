What if the hand that feeds
Were touched by evil, impurity
A city stained in pain
You call this living
I feel the worst is yet to come
Darkened the days will we ever belong
We're caged within our own lives
Within our own minds
Is this the end?

Which way is out, when there is no way in
How do you start, when there is no beginning

Live each day, as if it were your last
Breathe new life, forget about your past
This may be your only chance
Close your eyes and count to ten
Don't wish your life away again

Which way is out, when there is no way in?
How do you start, when there is no beginning?

Our loved ones left behind
Forced to remain
Our hands are tied forced our goodbyes
You call this living
Never look back on the choices you made
No regrets no fucking shame
Live for today live in the now
Escape the mundane this prison this hell

Live each day, as if it were your last
Breathe new life, forget about your past
This may be your only chance
Close your eyes and count to ten
Don't wish your life away again
