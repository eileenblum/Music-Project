How do you find, something that canât be seen?
How do you belong, when you know you donât believe?
Life the lesson learnt the hard way I live by my own rules
Who says I have to follow this hollow existence that you choose

Is there any way Iâll ever know?
Where to find this I seek
And if itâs hidden deep within the depths of my sanity
Will I ever get closer, its divinity I seek

How can I be saved, no salvation that I seek
You question my faith, inside doubt your own beliefs
Life the lesson learnt the hard way i live by own rules
Who says I have to follow this hollow existence that you choose

Redemption, this is only for the week
Redemption, is it closure that you seek?

How can I get closer?

Is there any way Iâll ever know?
Where to find this I seek
And if itâs hidden deep within the depths of my sanity
Will I ever get closer, its divinity I seek
