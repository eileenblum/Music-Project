Life loosens its grip as the world falls apart
The sign of the first this seal is the start
Nations on fire as heaven departs

Thereâs no escape from this hell
This is our world look at what weâve become
This is our undoing the damage is done

If given the choice then what price would you pay?
Wait till the suns black and you find itâs too late
Give everything up just to go back to where this began

Thereâs no escape from this hell
This is our world look at what weâve become
This is our undoing the damage is done

We are the weak, we walk among these demons
Itâs the enemy that we keep
Never alone, never alone

Life loosens its grip as the world falls apart
The sign of the first this seal is the start
Nations on fire as heaven departs

Thereâs no escape from this hell
This is our world look at what weâve become
This is our undoing the damage is done
