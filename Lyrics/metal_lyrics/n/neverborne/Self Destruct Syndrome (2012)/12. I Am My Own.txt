[Bonus Track]Somewhere within me 
Locked up deep down inside
Thereâs a fire that burns and it keeps me alive
What you see outside this skin disguised
Paint it red, paint it black
What your seeing is a colour this runs deeper than that
To live is to learn, what we learn is to hate
Choose your own or die and you will never know

I am my own
I live free
Abandoned the hold
I wish you could see what I see
Insanity, this enslavement is a burden

Believe in truth, believe in life
Believe in the blade on the edge of this knife
What you see is not what you get
I was built for a reason Iâm not like all the rest

I am my own
I live free
Abandoned the hold
I wish you could see what I see
Insanity, this enslavement is a burden

Change, itâs never too late
Make a change
Inside find youâre whole again
They donât own you no one does or ever will
