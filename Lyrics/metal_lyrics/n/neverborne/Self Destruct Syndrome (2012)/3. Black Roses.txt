As pain subsides in this lifeless soul
Iâm giving in just trying to let you go
Trying to feel anything more than this

Everyday is a constant reminder
Why could you wait for me to say goodbye

And know you leave me
Black roses on your grave
I will remember you, the memory remains
Iâm so alone, youâve left me forever this time
No chance to say goodbye

This emptiness is filling me whole
Leaving me numb, nobody knows
Youâre taken too soon
Taken away with broken wings
Iâll see you again

Everyday is a constant reminder
Why could you wait for me to say goodbye

And know you leave me
Black roses on your grave
I will remember you, the memory remains
Iâm so alone, youâve left me forever this time
No chance to say goodbye
