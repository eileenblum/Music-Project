Before your days are numbered
Before the last grain falls through the hour glass of our existence
Only then will we realize the damage we've done

Today we rise
Tomorrow we fall
Were given a miracle
In time destroy it all for nothing
Undone
Realize what you've got till itâs gone
We are the source of our own destruction

Hate is very much alive
We live within our own demise
The end of days our own creation
Force fed bullshit
&gt;From the start
The world our scar
We'll wear it on our hearts

The beginning of the end
No time for reflections
Of what could of been
Only what will be

Today we rise
Tomorrow we fall
Were given a miracle
In time destroy it all for nothing
Undone
Realize what you've got till itâs gone
We are the source of our own destruction
