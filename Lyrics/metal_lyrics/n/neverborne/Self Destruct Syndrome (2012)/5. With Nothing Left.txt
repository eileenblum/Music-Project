Where will you be?
When death comes knocking at your door
How will you feel, when your time is up
and there is nothing to show for this life?

Will your words be frozen in time?
Or will your hands be those that saved lives?
I want the world to know who I am
Be remembered for something
By someone

Where will you be?
When death comes knocking at your door
How will you feel, when your time is up
and there is nothing to show for this life?

Born without a name
Surrounded by chaos raised on pain
Brought into this life by sins of the flesh
A forced existence
Until the last breath weâre faced with a choice
Of which path to choose
Itâs break or be broken
And hang up the noose
I have lived through the darkest of days
And come out on top, stronger unchanged
The path Iâve chosen has lead me to see
There's something worth fighting for
Need to succeed

Where will you be?
When death comes knocking at your door
How will you feel, when your time is up
and there is nothing to show for this life?
