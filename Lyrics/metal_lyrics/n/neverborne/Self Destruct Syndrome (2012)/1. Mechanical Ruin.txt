We are the anti, uninvited ones they chose to forget

Under this blood stained sun, something is lost, something is wrong
These bodies, they lie scattered
These lives, theyâre lost
The families, theyâve shattered
Choose your own donât you feed the machine
These corporate killers, silhouettes of pure human greed

Everything we are is born from blood
This isnât manufactured
Uninvited and outcast
More than a number diseased all the rest

There's life beyond the suite and the shackles
These cracks run deep
Some can never be saved
There is an empty inside
A synthetic being, living only to die

Everything we ever fought for
Everything we lose
Sacrifice is everything
Itâs who we are
The life we choose

Everything we are is born from blood
This isnât manufactured
Uninvited and outcast
More than a number diseased all the rest
