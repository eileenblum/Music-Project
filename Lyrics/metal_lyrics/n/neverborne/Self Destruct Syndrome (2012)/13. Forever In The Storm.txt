[Bonus Track]Forgive me, forgive me not
I am the one who chose this
I will be the one to live with it
Darker my days, darker every breath I take
I am the one who chose this
I will be the one to live with it

Forever forbidden
Forever living life I'm driven
I don't need your prayers, your healing
I swear to god, is anybody listening?
I am the one who chose this 
I will be the one to live with it

A choice, to be alone
An outsider, this is just where I belong
So far away, so far from you the truth
Itâs all just a lie

Forever and outsider
Forever in the storm
Face of the faceless
I choose to live outside the norm

Forgive me, forgive me not
I am the one who chose this
I will be the one to live with it
Darker my days, darker every breath I take
I am the one who chose this 
I will be the one to live with it

A choice, to be alone
An outsider, this is just where i belong
So far away, so far from you the truth
Itâs all just a lie
