Life is a prison and death a release
With crippled body and corrupt mind
Years wasted watching the world die
Seeking solutions that epitomise mankind
Human spark defies the illusion and senses
Existence perpetual in diminishing time
Abhorrence is as it should be
Unending! ...abhorrence

Limitless anger surges through your veins
Rage intensified, emotions too confused to measure
Abhorrent knowledge saturates
Contracted tendons, unadultered pleasure
Chastised by visions of abominations
Hidden, but volatile and insipid treasure

Rambling turmoil, you savour lunacy
Immortal reflections return unbidden
Legacy of doubt rides the waves of insanity

My resilience nourished by unabated violence
Substance in what I see
Savour malevolence, contagious self-pity
Infiltrate the hierarchies that be
I realize death at your trivial hopelessness
Let abhorrence reign free!
