Come to me with darkness in your heart
Condemned by fate abandoned in flames
Eternally descending, chronic damnation
Valiant prayers spoken in hate
Forfeit the right to existence
Renouncing gods their faith
Nightmare plagues your subconsciousness
Genderless demons await

Desperate celestials being drawn
Magnetically into the abyss
The lord of change returns
Unchained by fettered lives

Raise the knife
Feel the fear
Nocturnal lies
Your death is near

Flesh lacerated in orgyous lust
By devils fanatical with greed
A change now...
Mutated, deranging terrorize
Down I strike, now I must
Tear your soul, bloodlust

Stagnation, mutated land
The last vestiges of mortal men
The lord of change returns
Unchained by fettered lives

Raise the knife
Feel the fear
Nocturnal lies
Your death is near
