Ambitious primates conquer the complexities
Feast atop their temporary solace

Unabated devastation at the inevitable demise
Dominant lifeform irresponsible

Mankind inexplicably overthrown
Inheriting disease with abhorrence

Terminations inflicted upon their own
Desolate derelict cities writhe with restless dead

Through wars crusades and experimentations
Battlefields littered with undeath, the dead and dying

Suspended aloft in the noxious ether
Dubious deities lay claim with ritual acts

Incubated plagues immune to inoculation
Contrived from the Necronomicon

Virulent organisms for planetary assassination
Global catastrophe, ominous despair

Vaccinations bred for disease
Misconception oblivion seed

Depravity secured by desecration
Inanimate symbols carved in archaic stone

Oblivion seed!
