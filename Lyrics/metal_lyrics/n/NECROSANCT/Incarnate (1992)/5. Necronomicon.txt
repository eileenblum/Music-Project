Alone in darkness, an obsession to control
The crackling of manuscripts the ritual unfolds
Presence of mind cannot be found inside
Absorbing cryptic messages predating mankind
...Necronomicon

Learning the secrets of primal ones
The watcher in the dark
Incantations of summoning of nightmare and discord
Knowledge that should never be straining at the mind
Cascading flow of consciousness
Sanity left behind

Magus adept his power untold
Calling darkness the portal holds
Under the earth Pazuzu awaits
For Eldricht incants to open the gate
Stoop not down therefore
Unto this darkles splendid world
Wherein continually lies a faithless depth
And Hades wrapped in clouds
Delighting in unintelligible images precipitous, unwinding
A black ever rolling abys ever espousing a body
Unluminous...formless...void!

Drawing out the talisman under the glowing moon
Mumbling thoughts of blasphemy
The power comes too soon
Below in vaulted darkness in ager despair
Shifting in his plasmic void
The watcher starts to stir

Demons unchecked rise within circles on the hill
Drawn into the world of men so they can kill
Blackened souls and reddened limes hurled into the gate
Wailing immortal wakes the horrors from time and space

Man tormented, great old ones arise
Death amongst the living eternal wails and cries
Blind and idiot elder gods plot the worldâs doom
Magus rocking madly chained at Pazuzuâs throne

Necronomicon
