Nexus absorbed by nihilist obsessions
Infested by fresh vigour
A reverence to live again
Sanctity cremated
Theocracy reigns
Inseparable paths collide
Endless travel exhausted

Skeleton
Now the vessel of endless pain
Born to rise
Eternal reign

Unrest
Restless dead
Rise again
Restless dead

A relentless persecution endowed with grief
Accustomed to submission
Plummet to oblivion, gnawing at restraint
To reek on the world they hate
Eternal spiral descends
Life breeds torment

Skeleton
Now the vessel of endless pain
Born to rise
Eternal reign
