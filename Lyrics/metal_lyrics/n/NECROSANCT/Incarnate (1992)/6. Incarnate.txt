A crooked god flourished on submission
Corrupted by peace, deception complete
The rewards cripple your very thoughts
Sadistic realms of total confusion
Wallowing in excruciating pity
A manipulation of seething minds
Exalt the decaying moralities
Released from containment to arise
Subconscious thoughts can materialize
Whose judgement can incriminate
In your aftermath, minds will awaken
To rewards from the dark side

Incarnate!

The sins of flesh weaken the soul
Taint the skin with an unleashed legacy
Righteous prayers resolve your sins
Through the lies and disharmony
Consciousness dissolves in prophecy
Wicked calamity still remains
Hope to receive your inheritance
As your life-force slowly drains
