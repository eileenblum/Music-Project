Sublime merciful release
Dishonoured this desolate shell
Take me from my world torn astray
Only ashes intent left unburnt
Turbulent past unending future
Days receed counted on skeletal digits
A meaningless heartbeat beckons
Diminishing seconds
Another breath closer to self-destruction

Waiting only the secret of being to be revealed
The last clutching moment a shroud of some reality

Psychosis, inbred revulsions playing
Upon non-existing themes
Unrelenting forms of veiled illusion
Can no one hear my malicious screams
Released devoid of any sanity immersed
In deathlike dreams

Excruciating pleasure of pain
Deeper than the well of souls
Immortal reflections return

Life's never achieving goals
A host of unsummoned horrors
Mocking me malcontent
Dislocated thoughts running undefined
Ripping away at my fragile intent
Can no one hear my pleas?
Help me release me
All I ask
Solace!
