Sickened verses chanted in hushed conviction
Acolyte consumes the precious blood
Reluctant witness betrothed to death
Pulsating heart held dripping alopt
Elegant rehearsals in garments of black
Macabre congregation anxious for incision
Desecrating, sanctimonious realize death at the plunging blade
Mortification of corpses, eternity of death confirmed
Destined to die, baptized in blood...ritual acts

Abhorrent intent
Denial definitions
Slaughtered defense
Infinite intrusions
Repulsion, genocide
Inerrant dissolutions

Ritual acts

Sadistic realms lie in deep confusion
Brought forth by willing minds
Justifying acts of cruel redemption
That the powers that sleep can arise
Hierarchies of contrived manipulations
Invisible evil structures immense

The pain is never-ending, never enough
Pain is an illusion of the senses
Despair, an illusion of the mind
