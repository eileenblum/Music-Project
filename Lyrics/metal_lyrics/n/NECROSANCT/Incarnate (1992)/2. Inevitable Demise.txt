Graceful forests weep from manâs solutions
Orifices and animals clogged with toxic puss
Ungerminated seeds sporn contorted figures
An impenetrable veil of death cloaks the land

Cancerous growth clenches
Decimating in service to man
Grimacing salvations at the hands of technology
Virulent tendrils
Invisible certain death

Man swept aside, now inevitable demise
Poisoned sterile veins, never to flourish again
Irreversible damage as bilious gases rise
Lifeâs fatality festering aborted life
Carcasses writhe with carrion unfathomable
Masses swarm over corpses with unbound ferocity

Eradicated, life with no sanctuary
Contagious destruction succumbed
Corrosive red skies burning
Suffer now the populace sickly infested

Without eternal change, the pain
Lifeâs conservation thrives
Fixity of mankind
This metastatic world of yours
Clinging, dying
Promenace or order
Sickens my mind!
