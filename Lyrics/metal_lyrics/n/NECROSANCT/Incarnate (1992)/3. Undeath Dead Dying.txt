Eternity yours for lament
Oblivion the scriptures authentic
Irrelevant existence youâve had
Insanity extreme mental anguish
To preserve your life physical
Exertion painfully saps

Undeath dead dying undeath

Monotonous your craving for life
Inseparable the bonds that ensnare
Hysteria surges from within
No sense why you...die!

Numbness creeping over you
Continual ageless pain
Insane cling to mortality
In death remain the same

Undeath dead dying undeath

You find yourself abandoned
On the corridors of death
Insane cling to mortality
In death remain the same

Undeath dead dying undeath
