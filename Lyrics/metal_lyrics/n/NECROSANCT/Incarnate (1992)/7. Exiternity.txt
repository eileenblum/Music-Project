Lives threatened in pain of torture
Condemned to time eternal
Blood possesses what death has given
For that is the end of all creation
Entrails spilled on the stone of altar
Delivered your despised children
Now the time of your lives I require
He carries death in his name

Tortured the needles of your mind
Time! Lies motionless in the still air
Into! A stillness that warrants no reply
Against the dying of the light
In death! There is no dominion

Fatal negatives beget the beast now a son
In darkened enclaves dwells
The blackened pit of despair
Contrived in congealed blood
Pray the merciful
Come to infest your soul
The ends has just begun

Your death arrives on swift wings
Nurtured in famine
Now you mortal must die
Unprepared deathâs elixir
Unstable mind begins to splinter
Its fractures immersed in fear
Are you prepared now?
Non-existence
Exiternity!
