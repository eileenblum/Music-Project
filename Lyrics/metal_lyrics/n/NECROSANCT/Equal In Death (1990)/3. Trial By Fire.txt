[Derech]

Where is the evil on the day we rejoice?
November the fifth, we all hear his voice
A whispered voice that his plan was complete
The house of hell burnt to their feet

Burn him bonfires
Sat him on flames
Guy Fawkes alive
Immortalized

The taste of the air phosphoric thrill
The spills of ejecta, lavic and bright
The works of fire made with a skill
Explosions of violence to mettle the night

We keep him alive, why do we care?
We'll low the government into the air
Martyred, Guy Fawkes alive, immortalized
He dies again

Burn him bonfires
Sat him on flames
Guy Fawkes alive
Immortalized

We keep him alive, why do we care?
We'll low the government into the air
Martyred, Guy Fawkes alive, immortalized
He dies again

A clap of fire-burst and gunpowder smells
The flame of excitement in veins that swell
The blood of rebellion, the devil may care
To honour the faithful with valour to dare

Burn him bonfires
Sat him on flames
Guy Fawkes alive
Immortalized

Guy Fawkes on thorns, hopes for the day
When someone of courage fulfills his dreams
To rid us of this torment, blaster cremate
A church of hate this house has been

We keep him alive, why do we care?
We'll low the government into the air
Martyred, Guy Fawkes alive, immortalized
He dies again
