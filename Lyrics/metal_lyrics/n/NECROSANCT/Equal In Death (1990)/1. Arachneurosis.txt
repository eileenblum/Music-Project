Flash of arachnid in dream wracked night
Bite on arm and hand in suck glut delight
Horror is close, now as she pumps into veins
Terror struck as the pain hits again

Blackness of fear
Spinning, unclear
Nauseous tendrils flick up inside
In sickness and wretching pain

Sweating, bad dreams crawling mind of fear
Crying, shrieking, close, near
Caverns of feelings hiss with still air
Waiting innocence... in there

Rank evil stirring
A terror lurking
Mortally afraid of darkness
Unknown depths their inside

Creeping fear
Evil near
Crawling fear
Creeping fear

Mouth erupts in a livid howl of hatred and dismay
Furry legs scamper from nostrils torn astray
Biting at the living corpse, the spiders start to feast
Twitching, as all nerves give way
The victim long deceased

In the spiderâs lair the eggs are cracked
Darkest evil nightmare, ready the attack
Flash of arachnid in dream wracked night
Bite on arm and hand in suck glut delight

Kidneys rip apart crawling from within
Thousands of bodies, eternal exodus begin
Rippling belly, rectum spews blood
Small forms hungry, a living flood...

Rank evil stirring
A terror lurking
Mortally afraid of darkness
Unknown depths their inside

Creeping fear
Evil near
Crawling fear
Creeping fear

Anal tract spews its load of bloody carnivores
Rending with mandibles, chomping flesh and gore
The still warm host is gnawed away
Spiders run to seek new prey
Pattering on stone...
Theyâre gone!
