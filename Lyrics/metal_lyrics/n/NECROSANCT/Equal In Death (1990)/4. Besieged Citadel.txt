[Fin]

Nothing moves in the forest, darkened shadows
In overgrown fields a corpse hangs on the gallows
The Necromancer ponders and apprentice in death
An evil spell to revive his youthful breath

Summoning demons to assist him in his goal
No thoughts for consequence
No, he has lost his soul

Observed from the void...

High in his castle alone in the night
Shadows the sun, alone in his might
Fragments of mind, in death he seeks to live
Demons he asks their secrets to give

Die, die, he cannot die
Defying death with a cast of a spell
Die, die, refusing to die
Necromancer, alone with his hell

Seeking flesh, sacrifice his wraith, lust rituals always wants more
Abused and lifeless, bodies lay tortured and drained on the floor

Necrosanct wars observed from the void
Always battle and gore, as field run blood
How evil the cause? Shall he make his claim?
To be fighting again, but his life hangs on a thread blood red

Summoning demons to assist him in his goal
No thoughts for consequence
No, he has lost his soul

Hoards fill the citadel from the villages around
Swords held by ghouls brings the stragglers down
Death is n haven for the villagers now
As the evil necromancer raises them from the ground
Homes are ablaze as the war-dancing ghouls
Rant and rave at the soldiers on the city walls
Swearing their vengeance, glaring with glee
Grinning at the living, the hated enemy

In the city within its walls armed with weapons an men
To the gods they pray, a miracle to send
Observed from the void

No sanctuary, walls crumble like dust
Against the head, weapons are rust
In the city is slaughter, no mercy shown
Blood red mist, a king overthrown

Death delights death as day turns to night
Thousands die, always alone
One man's might
Observed from the void

High in his castle alone in the night
Shadows the sun, alone in his might
Fragments of mind, in death he seeks to live
Demons he asks their secrets to give

Die, die, he cannot die
Defying death with a cast of a spell
Die, die, refusing to die
Necromancer, alone with his hell

Die, die, he cannot die
Defying death with a cast of a spell
Die, die, refusing to die
Necromancer, alone with his hell
