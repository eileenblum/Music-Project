[Fin]

Destiny wields its foreboding hand
Agonizing lobotomy of death
Assumed consequence of impending doom
Phlegm drowned lungs gasp for breath

Rambling tongue of wisened man
Prepare your time of judgement
Monoliths of your momentous past
Indiscriminate persecution
Awaiting death's moment

Awaiting to die
Immersed in void
Caress oblivion
Equal in death
Perplexing mist
Nostalgic dreams
Sense distort
Equal in death

Anxious cries in blood laced throat
Arteries bulge as the venom begins to flow
Organs collapse with spasms of rot
Idiosyncratic mumblings pain not known

Incurable disease sweeps the body
Twitching convulsions dripping pus and gore
Unreasoning pain of callous possession
Clutch your writhing body upon the floor

Preconceptions
Acquiesance achieved
Inclinations collide
Equal in death
Death succumbed to all
Experience fading away
Equal in death

Unleashed boundaries of mortal man
Analyzing thoughts of an irrational mind
Chosen time is come, philistine die
Your fate predestined, await the time

Functioned fatalities quickly crumble
Indecipherable stammerings yield to life
Physicians ponder of your condition
Little hope as from your stealth
You draw your knife

Equal in death!
