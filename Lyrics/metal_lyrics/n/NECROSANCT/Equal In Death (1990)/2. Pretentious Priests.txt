[Fin]

Mesmerized by stars in skies
Clerics in their false disguise
Bishops and priests call you to pray
Force in fear you obey

Ordained by the rites of man
Lacquered in the awesomeness of thee
Succumbed to all by ill faith
The reasons belong to me...

Indulgence in this sickened farce
The church laughs and mocks
Orthodox they ways of the people
Scrutinize the flock
Bible preached with vomitous tongue
Putrid deception lies within
Confessions on this sylilic
An aurical relevance to skin
The entombment of your devious ways
They'll chastise, let's begin

A dictionary of exalted beads
Unsurpassed in their exoneration
Condemned to a sacred life
Conquest of the obligatory damnation
Drafts of doom exaggerate the lies
Prepare my son for termination

Ordained by the rites of man
Lacquered in the awesomeness of thee
Succumbed to all by ill faith
The reasons belong to me...

Sacrosanct with intrinsic lust
Soon to be quenched in the fire
Ignorant of sound or rational thought
Blind to selfish desire
Catacombed with the lust to please
You stand alone robbed of dignity
Resentment befalls you as you roam
Again a beggar in the city

Ordained by the rites of man
Lacquered in the awesomeness of thee
Succumbed to all by ill faith
The reasons belong to me...

A dictionary of exalted beads
Unsurpassed in their exoneration
Condemned to a sacred life
Conquest of the obligatory damnation
Drafts of doom exaggerate the lies
Prepare my son for termination
