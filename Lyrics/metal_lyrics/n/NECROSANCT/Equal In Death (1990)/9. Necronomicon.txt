[Rik]

Alone in darkness, obsession to control
Crackling of manuscripts, the ritual unfolds
Presence of mind cannot be found inside
Absorbing the cryptic messages predating mankind

Necronomicon...

Learning the secrets of primal ones, the watchers in the dark
The incantations of summoning, of nightmares and discord
Knowledge that should never be straining at the mind
Cascading flow of conscience, sanity left behind

Drawing out the talisman, under the glowing moon
Mumbling thoughts of blasphemy, the power comes too soon
Below in vaulted darkness, in anger and despair
Shifting in its plasmic void, the watchers starts to stir...

Magus adept, his power untold
Calling darkness, the portal holds
Under the earth, Pazuzu awaits
For eldritch incants to open the gate

Stoop not down therefore, unto the darkly splendid world
Wherein continually with a faithless depth and Hades wrapped in clouds
Delighting in unintelligible images, precipitous, winding
A black, ever-rolling abyss, ever espousing body
Unluminous formless void

Moon falls behind the clouds, the time is yet at hand
Scribblings read aloud in darkness, the wisened voice of mortal man
Irreverence in the extreme, the carving of the stone
Starts to grow in eerie light, the earth begins to groan

A circle of light marks the gate, a crusted square of black
Green spots of iridescence, dance across the forming cracks
The Magus strikes the talisman, blue smoke engulfs his sight
A croak of cataclysmic glee and blood lust rend the night...

Demons unchecked rise within the circle of stones on the hill
Pazuzu leads them into the world of men, so they can kill
Reddened limbs and severed soul are hurled into the gate
Feasting in the underworld wakes the horrors from time and space

Man tormented, the great old ones arise
New world established, eternal wails and cries
Blind and idiot elder gods plot the world's doom
The Magus rocking madly, chained at Pazuzu's throne

Necronomicon...
Necronomicon...
Necronomicon...
