[Fin]

Equanimately shattered as limbs rot and swell
Strength falsified by spasms of pain
Nucleoid form, you envisage your disconsolance
Embalmed in laminate as tumours consume your brain

Catastrophe unleashed feeding of the slain for sustenance
Plague dissects the living tyranny quelled under dominance
Intoxicating, evisceration, decomposed limbs lying everywhere
Lingering decay undisturbed, stench defecated the nostrils and air

Populace cling to existence
Limbs fester like rust
Mutilated corpses decay
Tissue dispensed like rust

Invisible ethereal beings plot the fall of humanity
Unforeseen the onslaught, famine, disease and insanity

Engulfed in the Realm of Nurgle, to fester and rot for eternity
Prominent malfunctions oozed and separated for centuries
Non-coherent masses, their weapons primitive tools
Their language defunct, their speech of gibbering fools
Emotions compelled to kill, fanatical obsessive chores
Pre-apocalyptic victims, a mass of unhealing sores

Invisible ethereal beings plot the fall of humanity
Unforeseen the onslaught, famine, disease and insanity

Conjugal bond on unclean beasts
Dance of decay, insipid feast
Father Nurgle points his necrotic hand
Viscid fluid secreted on his land

Demanding amulets of mouldered flesh, a fell awesome
Uncouth vengeful friction of eternity normally drenched in truth
Bipedal bodies abort fetid limbs his skin Nero's digested
Internal organs so nourishing unclean one now rested
Horrific manifestations, their appearance taking shape
Earth spews chaotic mutants, dismemberment with hate

Lying dormant for centuries
Arise, our lord of flies
Unforeseen the onslaught
Legions that won't die

Effluence stains the land, usurper clutches domain
Beguiled implicit hypocrisy, nurglings chomp his remains
Pus encumbered tyrant, his domain now lies in ruins
The monarch's palace deserted food and gore lie rotting

Plague dissects the living
Wilting foliage upon the ground
Malignant tumours within the earth
Frenetic combustions abound

Lying dormant for centuries
Arise, our lord of plague
Unforeseen the onslaught
Congenital decay

Deceased, unhealthy, sickly, morose
With pestilence, virus infect your host
Adulterate, corrupt, defiled and contaminate
Exulterate and waste our lord of decay

As fetid forests burn back to the cavern to jubilate
Nurglings rummage in his flesh others quashed under his weight
Plague bearers calculate the casualties oblivious to the carnage about
Nurglings fondle their lord beats feats and shout
Nurglings rummage in his flesh rotted a clotted cess
Beast-men feed on their lord feeding off crud his ribcage a nest
