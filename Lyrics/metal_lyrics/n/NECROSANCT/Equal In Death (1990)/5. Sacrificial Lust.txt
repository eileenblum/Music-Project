Reflected in the doorway in front of him
Maeldun saw Leucosia's form change and warp
Saw her hunch down as her legs and arms seemed drawn into her
Her features shifted and sharpened and as he turned around the creature
That had been Leucosia, rose up on huge leathery wings
That almost completely filled the room...

Staggering back!
Catching a glimpse of the siren fiend
Crow goddess of death
Leathery wings now striking his arms
Send him crashing and sliding polished stone
Flames of the candles tugged to her wings
And died as Maeldun tried to escape
Her pointed break, struck the stones
Her claws crackling, scratching in his wake

How strong was the siren's night sight?
He edged himself along the wall
In absolute darkness, in panic and fear
His fingers touched the fat tube of candle

Air parted as claws struck a hand span from his ear
He twisted beneath the siren's wing her gaping mouth so near

Claws struck in insensate fury
As Maeldun knifed the wax
It sank into soft foul smelling plumage
The creature screamed in attack

He threw himself upon her back
One hand digging into matted fur
His other drawing back her head
But the wings clapped above him

A blur Maeldun stunned, slipped off her back
A handful of heartbeats whirl around
Then conscious again he saw her stamping
Hooked talons pinning him down

Maeldun wondered why he could see
And a womanish cry echoed in pain
He caught the stench of burning plumage
Of scorching flesh, the curling of flames

Leucosia reared as Maeldun thrust up
Toppling her off him, thanking his luck
Her huge wings bent but her flailing claws
Caught him across the chest as he swung

He staggered back against the wall
Fire and ice in his lungs
It was then that he saw the hole in the roof
And he painfully climbed from the cavern uncouth

He looked at the siren
Blindingly crashing around the room
Demon â trashing wings
Only serving now to fan the flames
Drawing them in and onto herself

The pain in his ribs made him want to be sick
A Leucosia lumbered past
Spots of colour danced in his eyes
And he clawed his way up in gasps

Leucosia turned towards the sound
And began again to transform
Maeldun paused at the top and looked down
But all he could see was wild crackling flame

Again Leucosia in human form
Retaining her leathery wings
Pursues her prey and the flame wreathed around her
Like serpents, like tongues, flickering
