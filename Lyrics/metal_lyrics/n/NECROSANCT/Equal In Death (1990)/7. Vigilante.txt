[Derech]

A darkened corner of the yard hides an old yew tree
Her tapping roots bugle and writhe the earth contorts in agony
A vault revealed of blackened stone of aching limbs and ancient bone
The immortal vigilante rises from the tomb of purgatory

The vigilante with shield of fire
Wields a battle axe honed from bone
His morbid battle shall be won and was shall be no more

He carries zealously a casket of God, ebony and pearl
A maiden girl with innocent hands delicately carved the burl

If he wills his time and place the pain has ripped him raw
But ever a grimace of wandering eye will benefit his foe

The urn held the hearts of three soldiers bold
One a centurion, one a barbarian, the last a private, a hero untold
The hearts were taken in glorious celebration in victorious combat thrones
The very soul of vital fire entrapped in blood enthroned

The vigilante with shield of fire
Wields a battle axe honed from bone
His morbid battle shall be won and was shall be no more

As centuries mocked the cage of time, man fell below
His creation destroyed the world, memories of long ago
Flood with a vengeance for this mother's death
He dare not let go...

A mighty cluster of metallic luster crowns his head of bone
His arms enhance the strength of kings
His skin resembles tattered clothes
And yet he marches ever on in silence and alone
Never turning, ever dying, scarcely even known

The vigilante with shield of fire
Wields a battle axe honed from bone
His morbid battle shall be won and was shall be no more

He gained the keys to open the city, seven set upon a stone
The first, the fifth, the third dripped blood, the rest in runic code

The lords of chaos gave him these
In concealed crypts of pallid glow
Empowered the vigilante's task his mother
Temperance wails and moans

If he wills his time and place the pain has ripped him raw
But ever a grimace of wandering eye will benefit his foe

The vigilante with shield of fire
Wields a battle axe honed from bone
His morbid battle shall be won and was shall be no more

The vigilante with shield of fire
Wields a battle axe honed from bone
His morbid battle shall be won and was shall be no more
