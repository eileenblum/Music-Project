Taste the disease infected through solitude
Living scenes imagined, disgusting, depraved, deformed
The epitome of all hatred, repugnance is a virtue
Wrapped in deceit, heralded by denial
Misery the only reality, degradation the only way
Taste the disease relying on infection
Tasting the disease riddled with imperfection
Socially immortal desires
The disposition of a plagued mind...

No escape from this demented being
Again he ravishes, defiles, abuses
Now unable to withstand repeated insanity
Relentless torment ensured, attacked yet again

Fighting back hard long forgotten memories
Stolen youth, maddening hands
Confrontation, rejection, the pallid glow of life
Frightening grave, abuse devours

Young and innocent, corrupted juvenile mind
Taint the pure thoughts now defiled
Rent frustration, clawing degradation
Taste the disease, flickering pleasure held

Struggling with conceptions of morose indignity
Bruised and brutalized, bleeding violent lust
Break bones, forced tissue in joyful glee
Hopes of some normality torn to viral dust

Plagued mind
Plagued mind
Plagued mind

Plagued mind
Plagued mind
Plagued mind
Plagued mind
Plagued mind!
