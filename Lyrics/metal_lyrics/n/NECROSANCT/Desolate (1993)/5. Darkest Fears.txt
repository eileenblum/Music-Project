Dignified in fear, drowning in repulsion
Bilious thoughts emerge in waves of your compulsion
Confounded by the helpless
Delusion running rife, the maze inside your head
Your never-ending life...

Mocks me even in death
Miseryâs sickened pain
My darkest fears

Suffer beyond the call of your darkest fears
I will sense it all and feast upon your tears
To sleep within your fate
Hallowed lifeâs demise
Enslave your conscious state
Will you see with better eyes?

Life mocks me even in death
Encompassed by pain my darkest fears
Coveting only the truth
Deceived by honesty
My darkest fears...

Deformation, all that I breed
Visitation, false domain
Insurrection haunts my need
Invocation, born of pain

Compound evil, confounding truth
Possessed of mind, loss of reason
Cheated by hope, esteemed by none
True to form, turn to none...

Life mocks me even in death
Miseryâs sickened pain
My darkest fears

Life mocks me even in death
Miseryâs sickened pain
My darkest fears...
