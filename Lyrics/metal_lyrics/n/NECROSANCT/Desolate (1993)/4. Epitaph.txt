This miserable dire existence
No crowning glory be
Involuntary self-indulgence
All consuming anxiety

No light at the end of this tunnel
No eternal truth to see
My only pleasures are forever
Sickening perversity

Flickering curious pain caress my dying breath
Torturous murder mutilation
Rotting uncontrollable flesh

Intolerable pain, vengeful vision, intensify morbidity
Visions of blindness, unseeing eyes, clarify insanity
Charred remains, timeless regret, unbounded decay
Senses aware, magnified is pain, achieve and die

Changing, the flesh is ripped and torn
Screaming as the body is reborn
Arteries run dry of my lifeblood
Inhuman from what have I become

The pain outside my body is like Iâve never known
To worship pain, dominant submission
An allegiance to death
You can only feel the hatred
Here is where it hides

Inside
Pray for death

Changing, the flesh is ripped and torn
Screaming as the body is reborn
Arteries run dry of my lifeblood
Inhuman from what have I become

Punishment, more than flesh and blood can bear
Benign twisted corpses, burnt dismembered bodies
Promised eternity, they give nothing, hateful souls
Survivors in solitude, fearing life and death

Revealing timeless torment
Nauseating cut of all
Itâs not the dying
Itâs the living thatâs become my hell

Senses aware
Magnified is all pain
To achieve and die
