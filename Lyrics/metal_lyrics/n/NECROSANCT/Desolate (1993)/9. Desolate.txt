Hateful grave my fate
Alone in life and soul
Agonizing pain
Isolation curse of birth
Accursed all to feel
My emptiness is all I crave

Existing solitude
Inverted cross to bear
Vexation the victims pray
Enough, there is not more
Lament your crippled form
Desolate...

Ravaged world in sufferance, bleeding seas now rise
Expose the rotting corpses, on cholera, pleurisy thrive
Misbegotten halflings, diseased with famine rife
A blood red sky low overhead no longer sustains my life

From the cradle to the grave
Alone I shall remain
Desolate

Winds of burning acid, skies in deluge rage
A barren wasteland within my soul, counting numbered days
Desolate amongst the masses, rejection holds my name
The ills that flesh is heir to, surrounded but alone

In me your death is born
Prophecies now foretold
Reject your fettered ways
The desolate ones forlorn
Alone...

Your salvation my eternal damnation
Waiting my demise
Your salvation my eternal damnation
Waiting my demise

Bastard sons of black thorned souls
Of motherless fathers and virtueless priests
Accounting disciples of a despised and unsacred god
Exploring countless steps to death
Die...
