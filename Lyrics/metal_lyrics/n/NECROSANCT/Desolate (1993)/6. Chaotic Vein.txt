A semblance of remorse passes not his consciousness
His negligence of brightness brings quick his fall
Insatiable destruction nurtures and satisfies
Brutal be his blood discharged through every vein

Beg redemption before the priest
For he knows the way of the lost
Who fall from grace without ceremony
But try to tread a righteous path
Insaneness drives away the entombment
Decadence begins to rise
Ink to the pit of depravity
What spiritual oath from whom

Rhythmic madness strikes quickly
Crazy momentum spins down
Unchecked passion for power
(Salvation is rejected)
Violent removal of life
Symphonies of unsurpassed pain
Merciless reign of terror
Stalk the streets in a mental trance
Exhilarating is the taste of terror
