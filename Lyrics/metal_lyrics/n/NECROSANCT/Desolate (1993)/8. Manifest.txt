Languishing there on the wheel of confusion
Hatred dwelling inside
The powers of evil are strong
Tonight dark forces return alive
House of hell rises above
Lights in the blackened sky
Hallowed souls and broken vows
Living only to die

Seal of fate
Words of power uttered in dark despair
Vanquishing life in its abhorrent dreams
Evil without a care
The sky turns red, the sea boils at dawn
Only ashes remain the land
Icons of hate adorn this world
A last vestige of mortal man

Choking, death by air
Cremation, death by fire
Internment, death by earth
Elemental death

Moon falls behind the clouds
The time is yet to be chanting ancient mystics
The one-eyed gods of thee
Irreverent in the extreme
Carvings on the stones start to grow in the eerie light
The earth begins to groan

A circle of light marks the gate
A crushed square of black
Mist across the altar
Dances across the cracks
Feeble human talisman
Smoke engulfs the sight
Fear and hatred
Bloodlust, tears at the night 

Choking, death by air
Cremation, death by fire
Internment, death by earth
Elemental death

Fifty names raise the dead with their beckoning call
Despair reaches its lowest depth and coldness fouls your soul
Legions surge from the gate emerging fetid void
Slaughtered, disabled our usefulness expired

Worldâs light passes in a blinking of a thought opening neural
Floodgates insanityâs lessons taught
Vanquishing life, perish in flames, artifacted reality
Every heartbeat separates a man from his eternity 

Choking, death by air
Cremation, death by fire
Internment, death by earth
Elemental death

Choking, death by air
Cremation, death by fire
Internment, death by earth
Elemental death!!!
