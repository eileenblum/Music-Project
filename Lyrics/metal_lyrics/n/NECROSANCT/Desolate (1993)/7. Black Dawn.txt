Heavenâs spawn fills the sky
Signifies the very end
Suffering starts below
Bodies scattered by the wind
The final war descends
The one we knew would never come
Broken earth burns
Incinerated streets of fire

Living nightmare, devastation
Charring lungs, no room to breathe
Holocaust strikes every nation
Nature brought down to her knees
The weak and helpless wander lonely
As always the first to fall
Deep beneath the flattened landscape
Crushed survivorsâ screaming call

Putrefying flesh, weeping wounds congealed with gore
Cities lay in ruin, satisfies the urge for war
Searing heat, caustic pain, mutated life
Grieving watch the outcasts die
Innocence is nothing worth
Justifies this hell on earth!

Black dawn beneath the veil of darkness
Certain slaughter, merciless carnage
Unceremoniously slain, life extinguishes
Outside awaits the dissipating gloom
Survivor in solitude now fears life
Nourished by death all around
Come the mourning to venture from safety
Hollow sadness for families and homes
Sickened by the enormous depravity
Inside cowering in weakness and despair
Only flesh disguises the living
Technology has wiped the earth bare

Living nightmare, devastation
Charring lungs, no room to breathe
Holocaust strikes every nation
Nature brought down to her knees
Innocence is nothing worth
Blinded by eternal night
Justify this hell on earth
The grieving watch their loved ones die...
