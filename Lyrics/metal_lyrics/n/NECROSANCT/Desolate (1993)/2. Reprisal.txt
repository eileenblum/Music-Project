Clouds litter the sky
Dark and foreboding
Collide upon another
Lighting shakes the ground
Upon the ground a congregation
Worship dark and file
Awaiting a message
To reek their havoc

Reprisal
Through the eyes of the dead
This vision of what is to be
Depriving the mind of the senses
To honour the ritual complete

Reprisal
Through the eyes of the dead
This vision of what is to be
Depriving the mind of the senses
To honour the ritual complete

Hysterical chanting
In robes of black
Swaying in time
Their excitement blinds
Acolytes await
Impatient for blood
The sacrifice screams
Pleading for mercy

Reprisal
Through the eyes of the dead
This vision of what is to be
Depriving the mind of the senses
To honour the ritual complete

Reprisal
Through the eyes of the dead
This vision of what is to be
Depriving the mind of the senses
To honour the ritual complete
