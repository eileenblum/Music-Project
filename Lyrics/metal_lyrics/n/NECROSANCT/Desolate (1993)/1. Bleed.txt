Evisceration, disembowelment
Gushing fluids from bursting flesh
Ruptured brains, stench of blood
Smeared entrails, rotting remains
Digestive juices, splitting skulls
A writhing nest, rasping breath
Rancid air held with screams
Malignant weight of suffering

Cervical salivations, dark stains
Eerie silence consume the brain
Splintered bone, tearing through
Glassy eyes drowned in gore
Excreted milk of human kindness
Deaths carrion the gaping wound
Snatching down, feasting hard
Feeding frenzy, kill for more blood

Bleed! Bleed! Bleed!
Bleed for me!

I pity you
Condemned to a life of eternal suffering
Now dead
Blood to sustain the output of evil
Sin is complete
Legions of Satan walk the earth
Unholy creed
Discarded awake in a pitiful cell
Victims pray
Time to feed
Time to die
Time to feed
Bleed...
