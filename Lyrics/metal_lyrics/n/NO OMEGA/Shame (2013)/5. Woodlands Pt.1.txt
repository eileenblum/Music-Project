Actors keep on acting
people keep on clapping
they all hang their heads
they all hang their heads
in sorrow.
in utopia.
when all the money burns
in sorrow, in utopia
the beggar receives no money
from the man in a suit
he's just another
poor man
dressed in a suit
he can't stop world hunger
on his way to work
on his way to ruin
let us rest at
the woodland cemetery
our silent film
a vast ocean of nothing
will everything continue without us?
