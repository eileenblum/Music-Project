Sleeping in
it puts me to sleep
i dig into this frozen dirt to see what lies beneath
i dig into frozen dirt to be
in a worthless, cold and empty grave
for a man so sick no god could ever save
A MAN SO SICK NO GOD COULD SAVE
so this leads me to believe that I shrink become thin
and that love is a lottery I'll never win
it's not your fault
but still i'm losing faith in
everyone i know
so this leads me to believe that I shrink become thin
still i'm losing faith in everyone i know
and that life is a lottery, that I'll
NEVER NEVER NEVER EVER WIN
