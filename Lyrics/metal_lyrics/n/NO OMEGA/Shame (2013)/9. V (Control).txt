Capitalism infests
our minds
it crawls up our very spine
controls our every heartbeat
and hangs us out to die
capitalism is the root
to all problems
we need to stop
fuck money
fuck greed
this is not the way for us to live.
it hurts too
like when the sickness took you
and we had to sell our house
like her she filled her life
with all these things
consumed herself
drowned pretty accessories
hierarchy
climbing ladders
it's murder to the world
but it's kingdom (a) throne to the rich
it's the false paradise
the egoistic
why let go
when she worked so hard
oh she worked so hard
