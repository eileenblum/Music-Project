Can't you see the lack in me?
the lack of hope and integrity
it vanished so quickly no eyes could see
can't you see the lack in me?
the lack of love and sanity
when the sun turned black and betrayed me
darkness caught me
it caught me and you stood there watching
every place where death lies below
there's always this fucking crowd
they yell, pull my shirt not to leave
i understand this crowd, but do they understand me?
