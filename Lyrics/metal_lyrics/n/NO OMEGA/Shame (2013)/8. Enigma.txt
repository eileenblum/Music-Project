Tracking down the missing link
seeing everything in blank
watching everything sink
seeing everything
END
i'm trying hard to give myself a reason
to stop questioning
to begin
did you ever stop before you started
did you ever give in without trying
without trying
do you sometimes write without sorrow
do you sometimes love without heart
do you sometimes
have you ever
have you ever wasted ink
more wasted ink
