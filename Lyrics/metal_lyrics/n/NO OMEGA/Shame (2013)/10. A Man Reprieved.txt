I cough up grey dust
i look up and seeâ¨that all kings are dead
and that we're finally free
i stare at the joy in everyone's eyes
they tell me they also can see it in mine
am i dreaming?
i must be dreaming!
i always thought that there was more to life
than money, and working
that other things had value
food under lock and key
this can't be this can't be
this can not be
we're finally freeâ¨
BUT I MUST BE DREAMING
