[Bonus Track]Itâs never been this easy to tell
â¨that youâre pouring gas over gasâ¨ over Metropolisâ¨
you want it all to burn
itâs black and white
â¨iâm ashamed to be the same as you
â¨to carry your bloodâ¨
as we bow down to the heavensâ¨
crashing down on every light of life
â¨a shitty snapshot of a world i could barely bother with
â¨for all i care
â¨ruin it all you wantâ¨
just keep taking and takingâ¨
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK IT
i hope youâre ready to dig graves
â¨because thatâs where weâre headingâ¨
eager to dieâ¨
are you eager to die?
