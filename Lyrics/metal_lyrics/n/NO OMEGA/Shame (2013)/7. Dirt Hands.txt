I hope you can look her in the eyes
i hope she can be more than a target
and reject all the ideals we made for her
in our fake world
in our factories
what's life like in a fucking factory?
make the corporate son work in the industry
built by his father's dirty hands
her head is aching
a blank stare
a bed invitation
she doesn't know what to do
cause she is too obsessed
to fit the mindless image
the picture you made for her
the ideal was forced on her
i hope she rejects me,
i hope she rejects
make the corporate son work in the industry
built by his father's dirty hands
(he washed them in the blood of the workers)
(blood of the workers' daughters)
