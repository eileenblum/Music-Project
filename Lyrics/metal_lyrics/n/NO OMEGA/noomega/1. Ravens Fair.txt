Sometimes I think that weâre supposed to fade

After another dreamless night
In this city of the dead

But I canât complain
At least Iâm not alone

Always thought
That the dead
Would be
Good company
Now Iâm not so sure

Am I alone in the
Land of the dead?

Sometimes I think that weâre supposed to fade
Sometimes I think that weâre supposed to fail
Sometimes I think weâre supposed to fade
Until weâre all dead
