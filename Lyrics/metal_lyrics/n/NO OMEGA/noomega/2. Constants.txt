Do you know
What it feels like
To be broken?
I mean really broken?
I know what it feels like to be washed off,
Like the dirt from your night before.

Deceit, disease, fucking actors
Deceit, disease, fucking actors

To speak of trust
To speak of distance
As a factor
On feelings

I hope this world breaks
I hope you ruin everything
The way you ruined us

Loveless
Cold
Fucking world

That doesnât deserve
A single tear of mine
Let it all fade into nothingness

Let me sleep and dream about constants
Something out of this world
