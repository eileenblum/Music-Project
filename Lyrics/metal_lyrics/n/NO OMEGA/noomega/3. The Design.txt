If life is truly designed
I want nothing more
To do with it
If life turns out to be
Just another vast
Factory
I want nothing more

My complete disdain
Our infection spreading
If I had the bomb
â¦trust me

If I could end it all I would
No more regrets
The last of my empty thoughts
And memories forgotten

Stand alone â a complex
A dying wish â come to an end

Humanity is a thousand screams
Waiting to be silenced
