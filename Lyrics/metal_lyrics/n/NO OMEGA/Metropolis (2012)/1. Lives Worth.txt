Concrete, concrete fucking dreams
Is this the life you dream?

Concrete dreams in a concrete world

This is not a life worth living

Townhouses for miles and miles

We're nothing in this world of emptiness

Weep for humanity
Weep for the murders done in the name
Weep for the murdering done on the plates

Hope we all die young
