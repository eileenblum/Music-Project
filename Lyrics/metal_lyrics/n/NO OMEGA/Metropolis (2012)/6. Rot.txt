Set fire to burning hearts
And tell them how it's all unreal
MAKE ME DISAPPEAR

For all I know
- everything -

Of a confused intellect
A misguided creature
Left too much room

For all I know
- everything -
Our culture destroys

Leave me to rot
'cause I don't care
I have both loved and shared
I've been to places
I'm ready to die

Leave me to rot
'cause I don't care
If the world destroys us
Or if we destroy it
