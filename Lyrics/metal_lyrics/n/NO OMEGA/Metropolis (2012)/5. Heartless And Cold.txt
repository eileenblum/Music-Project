I've walked far too many miles on this dark and endless road.
Now I'm stuck in a village called Heartless &amp; Cold.

Keep seeing your face everywhere
Hoping that you never went away

Is it okay
If I scream

I don't know what I'm doing here

I'm the grand failure
I stopped living the day I gave in

I've walked far too many miles on this dark and endless road.
Now I'm stuck in a village called Heartless &amp; Cold.

It doesn't matter. I will lose you either way.

Either way.
