I miss the hunger
That society stole from you
You missed me
Sadness spreads like a disease
And we stay quiet
Trying to touch the breeze

I see it as if everyoneâs in cages

I see it

Everyoneâs in cages

Now death circles above the city
Like a flock of birds
And machines reveal themselves as monsters

We are doomed to slavery by our fathers

We are chained to a racing train

And the only way
For us to be happy again

Is for the world to end
