I see you lie. see you pretend
I see you wish for an end.

Feel you seek for the best air there is

I hear you whisper my name
Why wont you get out of my head.

Oh, I wish you the best though you're full
Of hatred and regrets.

I know what you've always wanted,
But you knew this was for the best.

Now I can clearly see
That love is slowly fading away.

WE ONCE HAD A DREAM
WE HAD EVERYTHING.
