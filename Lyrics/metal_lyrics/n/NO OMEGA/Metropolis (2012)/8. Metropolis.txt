Tonight we drink to
The death of everything we perceive
Everything we could never love
Because we could never truly see

Your world of hate is going under
And I'm screaming let it fall asunder

Blue skies
Fade into dark skies
Swallowing all light
Revealing
A life time of lies
Harboring

Tonight we drink to
The death of everything we perceive
Everything we could never love
Because we could never truly see

As long as the music is loud
We wont hear the sound
Of the world falling apart
