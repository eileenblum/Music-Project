I resign my empire tonight
I don't wanna be king
Had everything planned out for me
But I have decided
You win

There's not a crown for this jewel
There's no jewel on this crown
I don't care about the money
I don't care if I drown

Cause it's all gone
In the dark
When I close my eyes
Remember the time
You asked me about concrete

Now we've come a long way
But my mind can't stop question

Is this it?
