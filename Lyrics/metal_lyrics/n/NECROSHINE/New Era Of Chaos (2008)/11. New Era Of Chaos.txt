In the new era of chaos
we have to reconsider our idols,
false idioms for foolish dogs
holy icons for wretched souls.

Destroy
Destroy

Destroy human ideals
destroy the old ideas
of a peacful world
destroy the saints' words

Destroy
Destroy

Why men are so blind
behind the useless of their beings
sins are for the surviving
they don't let their souls die.
