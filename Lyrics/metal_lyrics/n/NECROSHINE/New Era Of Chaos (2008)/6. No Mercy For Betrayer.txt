When the (full) moon will shine
in a (black) sky without stars
as blood thirsty wolves
we'll return to dominate our lands
you'll see our blades to shine
in the dusk of the night
it's the sign we are returning
to take that is ours

Look in face the death
now it's time to die
no mercy for betrayer

As evil wolves we'll fight
to unmask your false gods
created from you to elect you
to elect them, damned

Look in face the death
now it's time to die
no mercy for betrayer

(but) we are coming back
from the dusk of the night
and with our blades we'll give end
to the life of the lies' preachers
