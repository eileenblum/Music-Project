Winter forest with the ice you protect your creatures
White expanses of snow which reproduce everything in confusion.
The man is lost everything seems equal
there is no rumor nor a sign of life

He feels alone
He is afraid

Winter forest with cold you stun the minds
the man is lost he runs full of panic
It's night darkness frightenes
and the man runs

He feels alone
he is afraid

Winter forest with darkness you become invisible.

The wolf howls in distant, a mournful scream breaks the silence,
the man feels his end, he sits down a waits for the grey wolf
that with its yellow eyes will hypnotize him
and feed with revenge.
The man is waiting for whom  that every nights
meets in his dream, the father of all nightmares.
Nature revenges on man when the grey wolf
digs the heart for his quarry
under the ice moon
