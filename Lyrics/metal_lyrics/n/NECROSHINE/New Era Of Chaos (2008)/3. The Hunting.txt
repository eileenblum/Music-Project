The essence of life
is the willing for death
all the sufferings of men
are just what they need
to survive

The hunting
has begun
primordial screams
are heard from our voices.

You have arisen
as a lonely creature
the desperation in you
is just what you need
to survive

The hunting
has begun
primordial screams
are heard from our voices.

Searching, hunting, killing...
Loneliness, sufferings, blood...
Desperation, fear, death...
Is just what we need to survive.

We have to return in a primitive age
where man was nothing but a fearful creature
all alone
in the hunting.
