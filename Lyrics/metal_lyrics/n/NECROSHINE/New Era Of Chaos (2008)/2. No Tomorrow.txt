Slaves of this old world
chained by false god
forced to think
as they want for you
Wake up from the torpor
or you'll die enslaved
decide for your future
make your fucking choice

Die,
for the day that never will arrive
and that you remain to wait for cry
for a dawn that never you will see
for what you could never be.

Don't wait that someone choice for you
live like there will be no tomorrow
They want only a bunch of puppets
trained puppets to bow ones head
Cut the thread that tie you to them
break down the chains of hypocrisy.
