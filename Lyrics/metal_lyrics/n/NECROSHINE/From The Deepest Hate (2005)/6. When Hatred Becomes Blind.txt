They come when is dark
And fill my head
Clouding the mind
Black is the heart

Yaaah!
Dangerous thoughts invade my mind
And my hatred becomes blind

Like damned souls
Dancing around me
I don't laugh with you
I laugh at you

Yaaah!
Dangerous thoughts invade my mind
And my hatred becomes blind

When hatred becomes blind
And the rage coming up
Strange thoughts in my head
Suddenly silence around me
