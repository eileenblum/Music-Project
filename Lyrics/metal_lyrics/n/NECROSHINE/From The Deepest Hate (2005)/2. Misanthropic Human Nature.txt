Misanthropic human nature!

It's in my deepest nature
To dominate on the weak
Eliminate them all
And leave nothing around me

Misanthropic human nature
My morbid desire
Misanthropic human nature
My inevitable choice

I don't need others
Only I and myself
To rise from the mass
And reign on their world

Misanthropic human nature
My morbid desire
Misanthropic human nature
My inevitable choice
