Don't tell me other
Lies fucking liar
I heard enough of
Your fucking lies

Words only words
Nothing concrete
Lies only lies
You'll pay everything

Don't show me other
You're able conjurer
I don't need to see
Your paradise lost

Words only words
Nothing concrete
Lies only lies
You'll pay everything

Don't try to trick me
With your sly words
I know your game now
I know your deceits

Don't tell me other
Lies fucking liar
Don't show me other
You're able conjurer

Words only words
Nothing concrete
Lies only lies
You'll pay everything
