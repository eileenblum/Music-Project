Slaol, shooting red fire sphere, lower!
Let Lahanna arise, your rejected bride.
Jelous of your followers, envious of your powers.
You, giver of light and life, let the darkness in.
The world of Death!
Oh Lahanna distributor of death, your winter will never end.
Your army of darkness will kill all traitors and bring you their souls.
Satisfy thee!

For you we'll erect a sacred temple of death.
Its rocks as your wish will always be dirty of fresh blood,
The blood of children worshippers of Slaol.
The maidens will consacrate sweet melodies to your beauty,
Men will fight for you, to have your favour and your grace.

Oh Lahanna, goddes of the Moon, your winter will never end.
Your army of darkness will kill all traitors and bring you their souls.
Relish them!

Your temple, Stonehenge, will be dreadful for men and women.
Slaol, the bastard, bringer of life shall kneel to your power.
Stonehenge, the centre of the world, will be your abode,
Your damnations will dispell all the desecrators.

We hail thee, oh Lahanna, goddes of death
Your winter will never end
