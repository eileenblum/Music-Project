Killing myself in obscure nightmares
Drowning in the limbo of my fears annihilating my mind
Transmigrating my soul in the eternal world of darkness
Sinking my collapsed heart in the lust of sin

The funeral of my mind as empty as the soul
Of the killer that slowly dies annihilating my mind
Transmigrating my soul in the eternal world of darkness
Sinking my collapsed heart in the lust of sin

Killing my essence in the cage of your world
The inequities of human law does not allow
The true nature of all to express the outpouring of freedom
Transmigrating my soul in the eternal world of darkness
Sinking my collapsed heart in the lust of sin

The limit of human thoughts doesn't go beyond appearances
What is seen is what is real what is read is the faith
Asked to live and die asked to live and die 
Transmigrating my soul in the eternal world of darkness
Sinking my collapsed heart in the lust of sin
