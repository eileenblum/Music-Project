Thousands years of oppression thousands years of lies
Thousands years of nothingness thousands years of blasphemy

Perverted souls inquisitor of freedom feeding like dogs the corpse of a decayed god
In line like sheep waiting for a sentence dazzled by a pig judger of nothingness.
Reading false promises on the book of ignorance condemned to be burn too blind to accept the truth
Iâm a deicider Iâm your new prophet Iâm your sacred law Iâm your crown of thorns.

The saints cry of terror escape from earthly truth,
The vanity of men breaking the limbs of history crumbles
Crushing the sceptre of power of religion penetrating into the side of churches
Raping the beliefs of the ignorant eroding the steel of their armour of falsity
Iâm a deicider Iâm your new prophet Iâm your sacred law Iâm your crown of thorns.

Thousands years of oppression thousands years of blasphemy

Perverted souls inquisitor of freedom feeding like dogs the corpse of a decayed god
In line like sheep waiting for a sentence dazzled by a pig judger of nothingness.
Reading false promises on the book of ignorance condemned to be burn too blind to accept the truth
Iâm a deicider Iâm your new prophet Iâm your sacred law Iâm your crown of thorns.
Declined world commanded by the power of limits martyrs and saints proclaiming war
