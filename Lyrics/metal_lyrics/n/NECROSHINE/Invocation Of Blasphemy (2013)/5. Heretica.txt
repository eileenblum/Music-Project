Written in the book of lies words of a false god born to save us from our sins die nailed on the cross
Thousand lies have been told only in order to convince us of their weak point of view visionary raving of sad man
Heretica heretica

I say open your eyes to the flash of black light learn to live relying on yourself will not be a dead god
To show me how to live my days on this earth everyone is the god of himself so fuck your idols everywhere
Heretica heretica

Who can choose, choose to reign on this earth choose to live without any type of conditioning
Cult of I man single inner strength believe only in their individual abilities
I chose not to believe those who want to impose their god but I prefer to make my own decisions
Without being influenced in my choices break the chains that enslaves the freedom to seek one's own ego
Rebel against the preacher who tries to sell his pale rhetoric
Heretica heretica

I chose to be the maker of my destiny slave to any false worship
Aware of the strength of my being aware of the freedom of my mind
