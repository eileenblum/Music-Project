Come before me Great Lord of abyss manifest your presence arise from the deep
I have put my thoughts on the fiery pinnacle burning in luxurious choice of the moment
May my secret thoughts be introduced in the movement of the flesh of the women I desire
That my lust can be satisfied morbid perversion Osculum Obscenum

Sends before him who is the the bearer of voluptuous thoughts and let these obscene visions
Take form in future deeds and actions of my hungry flesh
May my secret thoughts be introduced in the movement of the flesh of the women I desire
That my lust can be satisfied morbid perversion Osculum Obscenum

From the sixth tower of Satan there will come a sign,
That join those who are eager and as such the flesh of the body to move my invocation.
From vision to reality through the nourishment that my sacrifice has provided.
Finally the angels of the first dimension will come consistency for the third
May my secret thoughts be introduced in the movement of the flesh of the women I desire
That my lust can be satisfied morbid perversion Osculum Obscenum
Manifested in the emptiness of the night, and gets into our minds
That responds with thoughts that lead to the abandonment of the obscene paths
