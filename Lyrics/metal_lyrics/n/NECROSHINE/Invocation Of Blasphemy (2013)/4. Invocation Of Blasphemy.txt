Abhorrence of kindness we shoot on your head distortion of brightness this is what we said
I look at the window of your perfect world unfaithful devotion and blasphemy words
Skulls and bones make my crown virgins and pregnant under my throne
Feeding with blood and fresh meat I just give you all the shit

Abhorrence of kindness we shoot on your head distortion of brightness this is what we said
I look at the window of your perfect world unfaithful devotion and blasphemy words
Skulls and bones make my crown virgins and pregnant under my throne
Feeding with blood and fresh meat I just give you all the shit

Blackened nightmares and fallen white stars
This is the red blood that paints your scars
Invocation of blasphemy invocation of blasphemy

Feeding with blood and fresh meat I just give you all the shit

Blackened nightmares and fallen white stars
This is the red blood that paints your scars
Invocation of blasphemy invocation of blasphemy

This is the red blood that paints your scars
Invocation of blasphemy invocation of blasphemy
