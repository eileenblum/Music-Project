On the couch bondage you remember your life
On the couch bondage you remember your sins
Wasting your life parasite of the world with your lies
You have infected our minds but now youâll pay for all the tortures
And now weâll purge you and in your heaven you will burn

I watch you bleeding I hear you screaming and by my hands you will die
I feel your demons screaming in your head and with your death theyâll arise
Wasting your life parasite of the world with your lies
You have infected our minds but now youâll pay for all the tortures
And now weâll purge you and in your heaven you will burn

I watch you imploring I hear you crying and now you think of suicide
I feel your terror eroding your brain and in your torment you will die
By my hand you will die now you think of suicide
You were born to be a liar you were born to be a sinner and in your heaven you will burn
I watch you bleeding I hear you screaming and by my hands you will die
I watch you imploring I hear you crying and now you think of suicide in your heaven you will burn
