A cold wind blows
On mountains of the north
Through the trees' branches
Like hands to the sky
Old forest
Protecting an ancient knowledge

In this desolate place
Time seems never pass
I vague in the remotest minds
Through fear and madness

Alone with my troubles
The dusk embrace me
Wrapped from the fog
That grows under my feet

In this desolate place
Time seems never pass
I vague in the remotest minds
Through fear and madness

From the deepest of my soul
The anger grows in me
Trying to suffocate it
I can feel it on my neck

Leaving to emotions
I let me draggin' down
Full moon in the black sky
Pale light on my life
