The angel dust fall on the earth
Covering every one, secreting the true human face
Givening idea of cloudless happiness
But...

The cruel reality is different about so there see
The happiness is ephemera and fleeting
Go out of society
Abjure your human nature... hypocrite

The angel dust fall on the earth
Secreting the truth
Free yourself from the shackles of morbid society
Return to the roots, get to re-born again the beast

The cruel reality is different about so there see
The happiness is ephemera and fleeting
Go out of society
Abjure your human nature... hypocrite

The angel dust fall on the earth
Covering every one, secreting the true human face
But now we there sweep away off
With the blowing
