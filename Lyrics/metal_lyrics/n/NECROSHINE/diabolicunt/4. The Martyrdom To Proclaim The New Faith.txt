Remember of yourself, of who you are,
of how you live and how you die.
Remember of me, of your Lord,
I decide of you live I decide how you die.

This is the eye that is watching you
investigator of you privacy,
it's the darkness grinding you
and drags you into the abyss of anxiety.

This is the black nightmare that fills your mind
of blood and death while you try to rebel,
without to strenght to react,
without the desire to be.

This is the sword of truth
piercing your heart it shreds your flesh.
In pain you'll find the strength to destroy
what you thought was the reality.
In blood you'll find the way your martyrdom
to proclaim the new faith.

Rebel from the ties of your past
your blood will be renewed
your body will never be slave of anyone
forgive the ideals which whom you grew up.
Lies that made you weak and unarmed.
