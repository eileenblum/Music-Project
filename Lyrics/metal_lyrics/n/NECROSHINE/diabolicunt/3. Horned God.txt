I hate your religion
create on false truth
blind crowds don't want to see
beyond the lies.
It's wrong to believe that
it's the right way to live
pray your dead god
silence his reply

Horned god,
Lucifer
take my cold soul.
Evil Lord,
Satan
tear my warm flash

Better to reign in Hell
than serve in Heaven
words of a rebel angel
unchained soul.
I can rely only
on my strenght
surrounded by fools
I'm my only god.

In the name of Satan
Armageddon finally comes.
