Crowd of bigot people
listen your lies about a peace life
empty words from the man in white
red form the book of lies.
Who are you to tell me waht to do,
fuck you, I smash you away.

Look your god nailed to the cross,
crown of thorns on his head
blood spits from the hands' wounds
where is your god now?

I stay here in this place of Hell
am I living in another world?
You tell me about charity and love
where is you fucking promised land?
I see a world of war and hate
are you sure we live in the same hell?
