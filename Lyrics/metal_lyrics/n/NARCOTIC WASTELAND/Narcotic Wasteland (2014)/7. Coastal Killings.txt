Abused as a child
Blunt force trauma
Taught only violence
Not raised just growing
Mutating into a special mind
That gives me the permission to kill
Stealing raping murdering
Just to get rid of those bothersome feelings
In and out of reform school
Forced into sexual slavery
Then later into prison
Desensitized insane

Cruising the coasts of Carolina
Wielding my Arkansas toothpick
Looking for the next victim
To torture rape and slay

Oh Carolina
Home to the meanest son of a bitch that ever lived
From burning barns to sodomizing children

Oh Carolina
Her forests and swamps tremble in fear
Rural country living has created a monster
I walk the same path as God by taking lives and making others afraid
I become God's equal
Through killing others I became my own master
Through my own power I come to my redemption
Cruising the coasts of Carolina
Wielding my Arkansas toothpick
Looking for the next victim
To torture rape and slay
