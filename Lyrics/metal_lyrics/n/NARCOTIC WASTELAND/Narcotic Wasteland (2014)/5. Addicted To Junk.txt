Living from one fix to another
Hopeless addictive personality
Has no chance against a drug like heroin
It will take control of every aspect of your life
Then one day you drown in your vomit and die
Leaving nothing behind but bad memories debt and sorrow

You betray your family
You betray your friends
You betray yourself
Look into the mirror and despise
The person you see is no longer there

Hearts exploding noses bleeding ruptured vessels in the brain
Shattered future forgotten past you will never be the same

You think the rules of nature do not apply to you
Ignoring all you have learned from your overdosing friends

Hearts exploding noses bleeding ruptured vessels in the brain
Shattered future forgotten past you will never be the same

[Solo: Rhone]

If you are ignorant enough to become addicted to junk
Then one day you will die
You will ruin everything you have ever worked for
If you ever worked for anything
Leaving nothing behind but the worst of memories
Your family will feel guilty but relieved that itâs over

You think the rules of nature do not apply to you
Ignoring all you have learned from your overdosing friends

Hearts exploding noses bleeding ruptured vessels in the brain
Shattered future forgotten past you will never be the same

[Solo: Rhone]

You become a shadow of your former self
An empty fiend heroin zombie on the edge of life and death
