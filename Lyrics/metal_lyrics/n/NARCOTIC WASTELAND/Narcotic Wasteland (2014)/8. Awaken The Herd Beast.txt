I loathe humanity
Despise your ignorance
A world of hatred the infectious breed
Taught from birth not to question or to think for yourself
Restricting mental growth the oblivious will descend

Awaken the heard beasts make them feel their lie
Shallow little existence forever trapped inside
Outdated books and scriptures I loathe humanity let religion die

Awaken the heard beasts
Embrace the animal lust
Realize knowledge and science

I despise your ignorance
Forever dying within those pages
You refuse to open your mind
To the possibilities of free will
Religion for the masses designed for control
To keep you weak and humble

Shackled by a fairy tale
You flaunt your paper lie
You live in fear of your god
A god that makes you ashamed

Awaken the heard beasts
Embrace the animal lust
Realize knowledge and science
