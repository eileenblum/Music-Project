Welcome to this place in the south where Christianity is law
For those that mindlessly commit themselves for social acceptance
But the fear of god only lasts for three hours a week in church
Then itâs back to drinking booze and beating their wives

You drink
You hate
You pray
Youâre fake
You lie
You rape
No shame
Youâre saved

Disgusting hypocrisy is all around us
And they drink every day into oblivion
So judgmental of anyone
Who does not go to church and drink with them

Then they mix the alcohol
With pharmaceuticals that make them blackout
This brings out the violence
That makes them crash their cars beat their children and rape their wives
Pray all you want you will always be a heathen
Itâs obvious to me that you hate your lives
Because the pressures of life and what is expected
From this ridiculous religious society

The preacher is on his drinking binge again
To help him cope with his own homosexual tendencies
He is ready for all of you to confess your sins
And judge you for not believing in God

You drink
You hate
You prey
Youâre fake
You lie
You rape
No shame
Youâre saved
