Drowning in blood from the scars of the past
Conflicting hemispheres will it not pass
But what the mind does not know is greater than knowing
Clot in the blood through the mind it is flowing

Visions in the brain
Erratic mental strain
The course through which twisted perception is gained
No truth will be spoken or known
Unwanted information in a mind that will never be shown

Dishonest humans speaking for what they want known
Lingering in their mind is the truth that will never be shown

I purge myself of this common sickness
While reflecting my true past shaping the person within
Lying through your face to me is the only sin
With paranoia high and patience getting thin
I unleash my mind in its truest form
So self denial shall not be born

[Solo: Rhone]

Drowning in blood from the scars of the past
Conflicting hemispheres will it not pass
But what the mind does not know is greater than knowing
Clot in the blood through the mind it is flowing
I unleash my mind in its truest form
So self denial shall not be born
