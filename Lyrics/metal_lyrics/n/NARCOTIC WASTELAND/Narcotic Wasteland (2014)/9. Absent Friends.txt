You are lost but not forgotten
You are with me every day
All of the friends I had
That threw their lives away
The mark they made on space and time
Like the addict they became it is fading away

The epidemic is growing
Taking more lives everyday
Some drugs are even prescribed by a doctor
They take advantage of people in every way

I wish somehow
That I could have made them change
Make them see how important they were
To themselves and the people around them

They became slaves to the substance
They could not help themselves
They could not realize
So they passed away

I tried to encourage them
To embrace their talents and crafts
They could not realize
They passed away
