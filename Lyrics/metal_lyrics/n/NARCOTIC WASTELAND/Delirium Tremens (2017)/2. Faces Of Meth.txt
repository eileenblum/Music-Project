Your innocent youth is now a faint memory
The meth has control
Slowly killing you while robbing your youth and beauty
Turning you into a waste of human

Your body is decaying and deforming
Picking at the scabs on your face
Mindless slave to the glass dick
Euphoria combined with paranoia

Dismantled from the inside out
Feeling helpless never felt so good

The faces of meth are forever changing

Never had a chance at a normal life
Raised by generations of ignorance
Total abandonment of rational thought
Say goodbye to functionality

Too late for recovery the damage is done
Draining the very last bit of self-esteem
Your teeth have completely rotted out

The faces of meth are forever changing

Smoking crystal meth until your face is deformed
Altering your chemistry you start to think like a criminal
Losing control of your very short life
You become a menace to society

Your body is decaying and deforming
Picking at the scabs on your face
Mindless slave to the glass dick
Euphoria combined with paranoia

Dismantled from the inside out
Feeling helpless never felt so good

The faces of meth are forever changing
