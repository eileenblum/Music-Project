Drowning in obscurity
Grasping what is left of me
I'm still dreaming â severed vital parts of me
Scattered like glass shattered
It's an unseen internal disaster

Please take away all this pain, or take me away in the night
Got nothing left for this place, time to move to the next life

Everything is drained of essence
Hard to hold coherent thought
Tunnel vision, shallow breathing
Everything is what it's not
All embrace, hail the rot

I am now the spiritless, a ghost no longer resides
Now my specter is a refugee fleeing the wars inside
So it seems that down is the way! Husk!

Sanity weathered, serenity never! Desire extinguished, eager to leave this!
Nothing is left of me, nothing is what it seems
I picked a good time to die, to be alive
Pushing opposing forces to find light in this
Found only black in the place you said heaven is
I guess the light was a lie to hide behind

I found that the silver lining
Was just tragedy in hiding
I found that the hope you cling to
Is just that, just hope, you need to
I found that the strongest wither
Deep within their spirits shiver
I found we're on borrowed time
The falling sands are yours and mine
Drained from this, its light gets dim

I've stood long in the blighted winds
To the end and then back again
I've seen gods be written in
And return to myth again! Husk!

Let it go, watch it drop
In the end we all know we will stop!
