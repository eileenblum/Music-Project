I'm losing, I'm losing
I've lost all that was sane
Heart, body and mind revolted
Pandemoniacal identity unfolded
Now this life goes down into the chasm
Deep into a hole, inner sorrow and depression

I'm going under, so far under
I've lost the ability to comprehend existence
Thoughts of happiness gone, violence remains
Clarity abandoned, only desire for pain
Time to go, insanity beckons

Life revolted by the choices that were set
Absolutely feeling disgusted and wrecked

Negativity made sentient drives me to the edge
Laying more burdens down upon my soul
Until pushed deeper into a dark hole
Where running rampant and indescribable
Live my thoughts that once were controlled

Feeling so revolted by the day to day
It may be time to throw life all away
Nothing is real when life feels concocted
Miserable, a thing of pure mockery

Late night shakes. Toxins my dominion
Through my veins chemicals dominate certainty
Nothing is real when life is revolted
Self-immolating logic, I must ruin my soul

In the mirror I dared look, incubus of distress manifested
Not sure if you are even real, doesn't matter
I will keep soaring through the confusion of my lunacy
The undoing began with the poison I gathered
So it shall end, mind deterioration, embracing dissolution

Despair and debauchery holds my soul hostage
There is no escape I have gone mad

Skull is shaking, eyes wide open again
Living with a stranger in the mind unspoken
A stranger growing stronger crawls out of the void
Not a corner
For the former tenant inside
Degenerating, unyielding, massive state of ruination

Still my eyes are vacant, masking the chaos behind
Every single day, and every single night
My thoughts a raging storm, and offer no comfort
And you, your words are adrift
In endless waves of deceit
Distorting any chance for me to exist
Destroying any chance for me to exist
