Self critical to the point of lunacy
Thinking of the things I have done
And what I have become
Everything always hanging in a delicate balance
Descent into drunken apathy
Throwing caution to the wind

As the dark horses ride the shores of night
I awake inside a paralyzed state
Frozen in a life of constant turmoil
I must free my mind
So turn that bottle up
Turn up the metal
To cancel all the frustration
To delay and disrupt the horrid engrams

Introspective nightmares, festering in mu mind
My conscience fills with pus and maggots
That decay as they turn to flies
Swarming around, distorting m thoughts
Then drowning in the irresistible rot
I try to kill them with the consumption of poison
And thus begins the purge of mental blood clots
No escape, no respite, only suffering
Wandering aimlessly in this intoxicated haze

No escape from the inner voices
No respite from these twisted visions
The only way to achieve temporary serenity
Is excessive consumption of vial liquid
Then once I fall into enchanted slumber
Too drunk to awake
From this horrible introspective nightmare

As the light grows dim
And this life slips through my fingers
Never did I care if it was meaningful
Just another waste of existence
One hazy day blurring into another
Time itself becomes irrelevant
I must evade the terror
Before my journey is complete on this earth
