The diseased one has gone astray
Nodding in and out of consciousness
As you repeat drunken incoherent babble
Rage takes over my face

You waist your life trying to forget reality
With booze pills and cocaine
I will not remain silent
While you piss your life away
This self destructive behavior
I will no longer tolerate

Blackout zombie, faded image of your former self
You become a liability
Trying to stop the voices in your head
With self medication
Forever scarring me
With this constant life of chaos

Too selfish to consider
The pain you put friends and family through
As we watch you slowly kill yourself

Blackout zombie, faded image of your former self
I have to leave, I cannot stay
I wish to feel my pain and survive
And let my open scars bleed and swell
Bleed and swell
