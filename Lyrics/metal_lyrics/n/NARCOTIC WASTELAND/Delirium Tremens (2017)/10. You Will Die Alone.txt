Constructing a self serving hierarchy
To pamper your weak little ego
Feeling the need to subjugate others
To feel better about yourself
Full of countless double standards
Undeserving of the praise you receive
Living a complete lie
Sensitive ego held up
By the smoked and mirrored masses
Hiding behind that big front

You will be exposed
For the slimy person you know you are
You will suffer for all to see
Your selfish ways will strangle you
You will die alone

I laugh at your petty little games
Narcissist used to getting your way
Thinking we should be grateful
For your twisted web of lies
Always underestimating the people around you
Utterly disgusted by your presence
You will die alone
Your fake smile and mannerisms
Loaded with condescension
Makes us sick to the point
Of vomiting in your presence
Wallowing in your own slime
You fit right in to a society
I will never want to be in

You will be exposed, you will die alone
Cocooned in your intricate web of lies
You will be exposed, you will die alone
The facade is over, you will die alone
