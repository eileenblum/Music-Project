Trying to stop this insanity
Time to end the consumption of evil rotten nectar
Hopelessly afraid of the voices and the visions
And the vivid hallucinations
The poison has bonded with my chemistry
Manifesting mental inability

Caught in a vortex of habitual behavior
I try to break free
But every time I try
To turn my back on the poison
I start to shake uncontrollably
And my heart begins to race

Beyond brilliance or intoxication
Stumbling on the line of life and death
Crossing over into an alternate state
Has become a necessary path

Stuck between the voices in my head
And the ringing in my ears
I recoil and tremble in horror
Every attempt to escape the malignant toxins
I feel the fear and begin to shutter

Delirium tremens!
The perpetual fight within
Has become too much to contain
As the purging ritual begins
Not one single moment of clarity
No serenity just delirium tremens!

Fear of being sober, fear of aberration
Stuck in an introspective nightmare
Serenity prayer will not save me
From the grasp of delirium tremens!
