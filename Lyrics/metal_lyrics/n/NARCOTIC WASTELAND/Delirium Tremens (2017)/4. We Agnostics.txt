The idea of a higher power
Has been obscured by calamity
Completely void of spiritual experience
Nothing to give purpose or direction
I will never believe

In the face of collapse and despair
The only higher power I see
Is a bottle of whiskey
As the brown bile rises up in my being
And assumes control of my faculties
I start to believe

Let the temporary false happiness
Flow from the bottle
Let my sense of purpose
Stem from intoxication
As I become lost in the dimming light

I fall to my knees
Accepting the higher power
As it renders me totally impotent
I finally believe
Now hatred flows through me in liquid form
Never again will I succumb
To the voices in my mind
So dependent on impure substances
As many are dependent
On their concept of god
