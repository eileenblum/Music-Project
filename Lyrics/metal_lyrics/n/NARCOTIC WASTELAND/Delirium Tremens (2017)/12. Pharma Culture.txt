No money in the cure, only in the medicine
Never addressing the problem
Prescribing drugs just to get you by
Corporations lining their pockets
With our shattered lives
Creating a society of zombies, awake but still sleeping

Slaves to the yuppie scum drug dealer, giving opiates to children
Diluted and hazed nation on the verge of collapse

At the mercy of political greed
They live in their castles, the rest of us suffer
In this doctor approved narcotic wasteland
Turning pain into profit
Feeding on souls, destroying countless lives
The lost line up and beckon their saviors

Trading their very essence for the mirage of feeling complete
And so the light dims and the pain fades for a day

Not disappearing, just displaced, further away than ever
Turning your bane into profit
They use your weakness to propagate the device
Tricked into feeding it with your life
Not knowing the cost
So many lives living that are already lost
Planting the seeds for
The next generation to kneel to the beast
Propagate the machine, turning your plight into profit

With each day, more become entangled in their web
Assimilated and sedated, overprescribed and hollowed
Ambitions downgraded to visions
And exchanged for fading memories

The hypocrites imprison us, for possession of a benign plant
While pharmaceutical drugs
Kill more people than all street drugs combined
While our working class struggles in absolute poverty
They seal our fate to a life of slavery
