No expectations from a pretentious industry
No ridiculous rules and meaningless imagery
Creating the art we want
Unshackled by the ravages of mediocrity
We are totally free
To connect with people on a more personal level
Not restricting ourselves to countless false deities

Regurgitated for the neurotypical masses
Deluded and controlled by popular fashion
Fabricated to feel against the grain
Delusional outward image of angst and pain

Return to the underground
Let the music flow, up close and personal
No smoke and mirrors
No fucking filter

We dedicate our lives
Never faltering
Never weakening from external pressures
We will never create typical garbage
Just to make a profit
No one will ever tell us what to do

Never will we feed you template breakdowns
To blend in with the trends
Or cash in on past glory
Every work complete and honest
Never just displaying skill with mundane filler

Return to the underground
Let the music flow up close and personal
No smoke and mirrors
No fucking filter

We put our lives on the line
Just for this insatiable need for metal in our lives
We will never care about keyboard warriors
And their biased magazines
