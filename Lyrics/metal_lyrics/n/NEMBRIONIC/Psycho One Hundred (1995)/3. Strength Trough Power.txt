Do they shiver
Can they feel
Where show
Meets the unreal

How senseless is this thing before me
Who's stupid trauma's enjoy me

Treasured prey
As we obtain
A rancunous lust profaned

And here the audience joins me
Feeding them is holy

Take it, Feel it
I see life, I kill it
Touch it, I master it
Dead you'll be, no limit

You've nailed
Slowly impaled
To torture is to create

How senseless are you for me
The strength through hate is coming

I'm coming
