Gimme time gimme time
Time to achieve what is mine

Give me fate, give me hate
Give me cause to persuade

Gimme soul gimme rest
Give me strength to confess

Give me pain gimme pain
Restless blood flowing through my veins

And now the strength comes thru the pain

Give me blood unholy blood
This bleeding gives me cause

Give me sun the bright sun
It shines so hot unspoiled

And give me pain give me pain
To suffer is to gain

The pain the sweet pain
My body, I'm embraced

And now the strength comes through pain

Far too great far too great
Promises where much too great
