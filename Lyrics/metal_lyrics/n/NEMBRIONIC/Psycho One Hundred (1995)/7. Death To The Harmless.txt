You claimed to be a frustrated pig
True ally of the thought
Not the one we now should fear
Guard is from what's wrong

Oh, you treasure what's wellknown
Are we not to judge
Being here to feed the claims
It seems accepted that you must

Take it, do not dare to leave it
In circles feeding what's frustrated
No, they shall never get their rest
All of them not proven not to be

Harmless clean pure and sober
Trust love hope it's bright
Show, yes, show your meaning
This homemade god brings the light

Death to the harmless
For some truth you don't have the nerve

Death to the harmless
Are we not to judge

Antibehaviour is salvation
