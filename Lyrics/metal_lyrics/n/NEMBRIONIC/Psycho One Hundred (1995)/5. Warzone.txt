Take no gun and run away
If that will make you strong
But it makes you weaker
And proves that you're wrong

The mind's for you a tree
Where is the ground for it
You turn to me the other cheek
But I don't believe in that bullshit

Warzone
Take it as a man
Warzone
Take your final stand

Pain is a reward
Death a gift for the weak
Loyalty aborted
The bullet for the hypocrite

Warzone
Try me if you can
Warzone
But this takes more than just being a man
