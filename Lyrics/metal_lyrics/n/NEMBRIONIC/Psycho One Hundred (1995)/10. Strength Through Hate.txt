Strength thru power, strength thru hate
Strength thru evil, creates fate
Confronting mindless behaviour

I do battle and survive
The blood and sweat pumps in the life
Free me from the enslaver

See his kingdom
Built with hate
He shall free you from this weight
Don't deny your own failure

Pounding hard walking fast
Feel the grim heart in my chest

Definition of cruel
Judging the fool

It's my lord he who speaks
And he says who are you?
I awakened but so weak
Wake up fool
