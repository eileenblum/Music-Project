I feel triumph, call me names
As rage is yours I remain
Double strong and serene
Victory is bold, sweeter than sweet

Attempt to get a grip
Pressure gives the pain
Released unorganized, worthless ones are chained
Blade of the fury comes, astounded now your face
After the last night, welcome, the dawn of rage
Dawn of rage

I stand for torture you won't understand
You call yourself human, but you can't act as a man
You will drown in your own fucking rules
When the madman is separated from the fool

Attempt to get a grip
Pressure gives the pain
Released unorganized, worthless ones are chained
Blade of the fury comes, astounded now your face
After the last night, welcome, the dawn of rage
Dawn of rage

Let's rock!

Attempt to get a grip
Pressure gives the pain
Released unorganized, worthless ones are chained
Blade of the fury comes, astounded now your face
After the last night, welcome, the dawn of rage
Dawn of rage
