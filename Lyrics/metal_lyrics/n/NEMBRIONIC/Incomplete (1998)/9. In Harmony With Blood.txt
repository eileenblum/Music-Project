To suffer is to bleed
A view we all enjoy
Using human flesh
As a personal toy
The art of the blade
The sight of bloodred walls

Make me watch and come
See how you try to run
And fall on your knees
While the head explodes
I never tried to kneel
It seems so easy for you

Lets call it revenge

In harmony with blood
Carved within the soul
In harmony with blood
Bleed for selfcontrol

We rise, from creation to battle for the one we honour
Bravery, is what we are, in the sight of immortal warriors

We rise, for destruction, it is Hell which we are serving
For noble lord, we're fighting, in the quest for filthy heaven
We obtain the might to preserve, all the treasures of deep below
He, the prince of eternal darkness, the king is our lord Satan!

Rejoin our blood, give us the power
Rejoin our blood, we owe our Master
Rejoin our blood, comrades in hatred
Rejoin our blood, rise from beneath
Rejoin our blood, give us the power
Rejoin our blood, we owe our Master
Rejoin our blood, comrades in hatred
Rejoin our blood, rise from beneath
