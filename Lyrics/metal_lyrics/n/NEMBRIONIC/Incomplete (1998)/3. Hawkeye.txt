Living undenied, astral faith
I'm the eye of the justice seeker
Like a bat, complete the task
Landing forfilled on the hand of the master

Hawkeye
Seeking revenge
Hawkeye
Searching new horizons
Hawkeye
Struggling with the truth
As I repent

With irony I breath to death
Wings of steel combined
Arrogance
A good friend of mine
Is not the same as being blind

Hawkeye
Seeking revenge
Hawkeye
Searching new horizons
Hawkeye
Struggling with the truth
As I repent

Hunting
Prowling
Diving
Destroy

Hunt me
Seek me
The bastard
Is gone, to hell
