I hear clinging swords melting in a cacophony
No bulletproof armor is there to protect
The sound of battle arisen in agony
As night falls, time comes to attack

Breaking the limbs under thundering hooves
Heroes preparing to die
Tasting the blood of the severed head
Vengeance makes enemies blind

Tasting the blood of the severed head
A force of thousands gathered in a warfare noise

With daggers raised in nights of steel
Pulling the trigger to assassinate
We sign contracts of black blood
There is no mercy as time comes to attack

Breaking the limbs under thundering hooves
Heroes preparing to die
Tasting the blood of the severed head
Vengeance makes enemies blind

Tasting the blood of the severed head
A force of thousands gathered in a warfare noise
