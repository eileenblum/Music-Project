Corroded
Corroded
Corroded
What you are is corroded

I hardly recognize
This face that turned to grey
I remember a time
Now old, a past of victory
This person is the past
I have lost you

Stupid fuck, you should know
I have changed, so did you
But when there are two tracks
One always goes the wrong way

Corroded
Corroded
Corroded
You are corroded
