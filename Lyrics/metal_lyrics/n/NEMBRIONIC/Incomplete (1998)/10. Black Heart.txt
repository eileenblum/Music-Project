Revenge
We
Fathers of hate
Irony and faith
Forged in concrete
Unbound in pain
Made to suffer
Untamed insane
We seek revenge as we break out

So rip out my black heart
So be it, vengeance is mine
Rip out my black heart

We seek revenge as we break out
No unmarked body on our path
We race with speed unknown to man
And praise ourselves as saints of wrath

Discover the smashing taste of blood
Another human life is lost
Astounding signals mark our feast
It's supernatural and all within reach

Revenge
