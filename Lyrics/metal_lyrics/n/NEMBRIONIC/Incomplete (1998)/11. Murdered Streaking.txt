Come, in front of me
I want to see you naked
Run, I'll give you time
You'll be murdered streaking
Go, don't feel no fear
That would be far to easy
Stop, when we are near
Means you'll be murdered streaking

We see the prey run
It's almost an escape
As we pick up our guns
We have no time to wait
You, in the van
As I take my bike
Pedal to the metal
As we will fucking strike

Poor child, face the gun
You took time to wait
But she's smart, and suddenly jumps away
I order now all my man
She'll be murdered streaking
Her shadow fades away, but our engines say go

Run baby run
Run baby run

You can run, but never hide, from my gun

Finally we found her
She'll be murdered streaking
Finally we found her
She'll be murdered streaking
