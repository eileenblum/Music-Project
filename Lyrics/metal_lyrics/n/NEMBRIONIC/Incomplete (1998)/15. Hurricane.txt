Blood, death's all around
Bombs, hit now the ground
Confused you are, as hate is spawn
This is the land where guns are drawn

Mud, no bodies found
Point, taking them down
Confused you are, as hate is spawn
This is the land where gun's are drawn

Knee deep in blood we're standing
Serving the lord demanding
Firing the guns of hatred
Preserving the dark creation

Take comrades who are dying
In search for place of hiding
Refill the guns with steel
Firing when they're asleep

Trenches with blood are filled
Look in the eyes who are killed
Barbwire with flesh is smoking
Dawn of the dead awoken

Hurricane
That's what I am
Strong and fierce
The Ultimate Man

Hurricane
That's what I am
Strong and fierce
The Ultimate Man
