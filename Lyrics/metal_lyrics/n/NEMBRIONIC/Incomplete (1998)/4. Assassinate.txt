We wait together for the bus to arrive
I grab my shotgun when its finally in sight
We check in and take a quick look around
And leave unnoticed when nothing is found

Again we wait as the plane hits the ground
The metal of our pieces makes an itching sound
You check the luggage as I take a lunch
I will not leave without using my gun

My gun!
My gun!
My gun!

Assassinate!

I run through the alleys of the airport
I hear there's a shooting near the plane
I hide when I see that you are gone
That doubles the price for me to gain

We came uninvited to assassinate
And I wont leave without the job undone
As the victim's guard looses attention
He never saw the shiny metal of my gun

My gun!
My gun!
My gun!

Meet the steel
Come taste the gun

Meet the steel
Come taste the gun
