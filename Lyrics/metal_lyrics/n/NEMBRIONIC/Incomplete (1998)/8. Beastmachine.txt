Cutting through the black sand
A highway with the speed of light
Introducing twist to the heavens
The fallen angel rides now at my side

Feel the burning wind
The strength of steel
As our lord has spoken

You're made to conquer
Made to kill
The dawn of hell has broken

Beastmachine
I own the road
Inhale gasoline
While the gun reloads

Hell
On burning wheels
We take their towns
Cut of their heads
As the humble bastards kneel

From black steel
I'm made
Hellsavenger
Feel my blade
From black steel
I'm made
Hellsavenger
Feel my blade

Satanic Deathforce
