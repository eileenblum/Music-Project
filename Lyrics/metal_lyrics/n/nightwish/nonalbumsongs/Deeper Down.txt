[2012 "Imaginaerum - The Score" Track]A crow flew to me
Kept its distance
Such a proud creation
I saw its soul, envied its pride
But needed nothing it had

An owl came to me
Old and wise
Pierced right through my youth
I learned its ways, envied its sense
But needed nothing it had

A dove came to me
Had no fear
It rested on my arm
I touched its calm, envied its love
But needed nothing it had

A swan of white she came to me
The lake mirrored her beauty sweet
I kissed her neck, adored her grace
But needed nothing she could give
