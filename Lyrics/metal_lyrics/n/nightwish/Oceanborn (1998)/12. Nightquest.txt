[Bonus Track]Born to the false world, the wanderer,
Storyteller, The Pied Piper
On a quest for immortality
Gathering a troop to find the fantasy

Led by a maid - Queen of the night
Voice of angels, such a divine sight
An Amazon to fight and cure
This reality with her feline lure

Patriotic to the promised land of Neverwaking Dream

Nightquest - quest not for the past
But for tomorrow to make it last
Simply the best - way to walk this life
Hand in hand with the dreamers'minds

Enter the realm, don't stay awake
The dreams remain, they only break
Forget the task, enjoy the ride
And follow us into the night

A merry minstrel with his fingers fast
Playing his lute, charming every lass
Joins the troop with a glitter in his eye
"Shall I find fame or shall I die"

A warrior of power along the path
A hammerheart, his gallantry to last
Rhythm of sirens, enemies, take heed
For in this war laws are a silent sleep

Patriotic to the promised land of Neverwaking Dream

"Come to the elfland" the eldest said,
"In my guidance you shall not be afraid,
I am the mastermind, the wizard to show the way"

First ones to guard this path of night
Lady in black, Lady in white
Followed by legions of night-time wanderers

Guardians of the halls of heart
When we from our homeland depart
To challenge the gods of emptiness
May the quest begin
