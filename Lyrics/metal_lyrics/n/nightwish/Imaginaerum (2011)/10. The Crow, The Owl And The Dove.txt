Donât give me love, donât give me faith
Wisdom nor pride, give innocence instead
Donât give me love, Iâve had my share
Beauty nor rest, give me truth instead

A crow flew to me, kept its distance
Such a proud creation
I saw its soul, envied its pride
But needed nothing it had

An owl came to me, old and wise
Pierced right through my youth
I learned its ways, envied its sense
But needed nothing it had

Donât give me love, donât give me faith
Wisdom nor pride, give innocence instead
Donât give me love, Iâve had my share
Beauty nor rest, give me truth instead

A dove came to me, had no fear
It rested on my arm
I touched its calm, envied its love
But needed nothing it had

A swan of white, she came to me
The lake mirrored her beauty sweet
I kissed her neck, adored her grace
But needed nothing she could give

Gar tuht river, ger te rheged
Gar tuht river, ger te rheged
Gar tuht river, ger te rheged

Donât give me love, donât give me faith
Wisdom nor pride, give innocence instead
Donât give me love, Iâve had my share
Beauty nor rest, give me truth instead
