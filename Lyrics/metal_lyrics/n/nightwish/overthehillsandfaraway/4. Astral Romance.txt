A nocturnal concerto
Candlelight whispers me where to go
Hymn of gathering stars as my guide
While I wander on this path of the night

Embroidery of the stars
Undress my feelings for this earth
Send me your salva to heal my scars
And let this nakedness me my birth

Macrocosm poured its powers on me
And the hopes of this world I now must leave
The nightwish I sent you centuries ago
Has been heard by those who dwelled in a woe

The distance of our bridal bed
Await for me to be dead
Dust of the galaxies take my hand
Lead me to my beloved's land

"This constant longing for your touch
This bitter ocean of hatred and pain
This loneliness I need to be who I am"

"The oceans are as lone as I
Somebody take away this gift of mine
No charisma for the beast!
But still I love you forevermore"

"Come to me
Deliver me from you
And from all the days of the Earth"

No last words to say
Only memories remain
A farewell then, my path goes forever on

All live tracks recorded at Pakkahuone Club, Tampere, Finland, on the 29th of December 2000.
