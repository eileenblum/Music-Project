The ticktock of time allows me to see
An authent to an echo
New butterfly to a cocoon
The swan to ugly duckling
The lake to an ocean

The deep times awake
As I can calm myself to yesterday
The flower has fallen its petals
Out of the petals a cradle I will

My cradle rocks with the waves of time
The time of beauty will never be the same
Falling again has no man's knowing
Please take me, take me with thee

Now I hear my mother from the deep
Sing me a lullaby of eternal sleep
With thou replant the plaster call
This and silence we seek to reborn
