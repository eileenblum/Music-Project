A nocturnal concerto
candlelight whispers me where to go
Hymn of gathering stars as my guide
whilst I wander on this path of the night

Embroidery of the stars
undress my feelings for this earth
Send me your salva to heal my scars
and let this nakedness be my birth

Macrocosm poured its powers on me
And the hopes of this world I now must leave
The nightwish I sent you centuries ago
has been heard by those who dwelled in a woe

The distance of our bridal bed
Await for me to be dead
Dust of the galaxies take my hand
Lead me to my beloved's land

Departed by the guillotine of death
I received a letter from the depth
The dream of my lover it carried inside

Caressed by the sharpest knife
I asked you to be my wife
Rays of the setting sun
were my tears wept upon promises undone

Come to me
Make me believe
to you and your love again

Above the universe
Beneath the Great Eye
I shall desire you forevermore
