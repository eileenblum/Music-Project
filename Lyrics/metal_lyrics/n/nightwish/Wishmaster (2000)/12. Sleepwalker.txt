[bonus track]

Close your eyes
Feel the ocean where passion lies
Silently the senses
Abandon all defences

The place between sleep and awake
End of innocence
Unending masquerade
That`s where I`ll wait for you

Hold me, near you
So closely, sear you
Seeing, believing
Dreaming, deceiving

Sleepwalker seducing me
I dared to enter your ecstacy
Lay yourself now down to sleep
In my dreams you`re mine to keep

Sleepwalker
