[Christine (Tarja):]
In sleep he sang to me, in dreams he came,
that voice which calls to me,
and speaks my name.
And do I dream again? For now I find
the phantom of the opera is there
inside my mind.

[Phantom (Marco):]
Sing once again with me our strange duet;
my power over you grows stronger yet.
And though you turn from me to glance behind,
the phantom of the opera is there
inside your mind.

[Christine (Tarja):]
Those who have seen your face
draw back in fear.
I am the mask you wear,

[Phantom (Marco):]
it's me they hear.

[Christine (Tarja) &amp; Phantom (Marco):]
Your spirit and my voice in one combined;
the phantom of the opera is there
inside my/your mind.

[Voices:]
He's there the phantom of the opera.
Beware the phantom of the opera.

[Phantom (Marco):]
In all your fantasies, you always knew
that man and mystery

[Christine (Tarja):]
were both in you.

[Christine (Tarja) &amp; Phantom (Marco):]
And in this labyrinth where night is blind,
the Phantom of the opera is here
inside my/your mind.

[Phantom (Marco):]
Sing, my angel of music!
