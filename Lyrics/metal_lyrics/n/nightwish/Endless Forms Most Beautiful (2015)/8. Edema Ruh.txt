One by one we light the candles of this show
One by one, enter the theatre of the primal birth
Silently watch the planetary curtain go down
Laugh and rejoice, as the powerful play greets you tonight

[Chorus:]
We are the Edema Ruh
We know the songs the sirens sang
See us dream every tale true
The verse we leave with you will take you home

[Verse 2]
Weâll give you a key to open all of the gates
Weâll show you a sea of starlight to drown all your cares
Mirrorhouses, the sweetest kisses and wines
A Debussy dialogue between wind and the roaring sea

[Chorus]

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge]
Dance to the whistle to the play to the story
To infinite encores
Laugh at the royalty with sad crowns
And repeat the chorus once more

[Chorus]
