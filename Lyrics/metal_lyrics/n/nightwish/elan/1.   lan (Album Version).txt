Leave the sleep and let the springtime talk
in tongues from the time before man
listen to a daffodil tell her tale
Let the guest in, walk out, be the first to greet the morn
The meadows of heaven await harvest
the cliffs unjumped cold waters untouched
The elsewhere creatures yet unseen
Finally your number came up
Free fall awaits the brave.

Come, taste the wine, race the blind
we will guide you from the light, writing noughts till the end of time..
Come, surf the clouds, race the dark,
it feeds from the runs undone,
meet me where the cliff greets the sea...

The answer to the riddle before your eyes
is in dead leaves and fleeting skies
returning swans and sedulous mice
writings on the garden's book
in the minute of a loverâs look.

Building a sandcastle close to the shore
A house of cards from a worn out deck.
A home from the fellowship, poise and calm,
writing lyric for the song
only you can understand..

[Chorus]

Riding hard every shooting star
come to life open mind
have a laugh at the orthodox,
Come, drink deep, let the dam of mind seep,
Travel with great Ãlan
Dance a jig at the funeral...

[Chorus]
