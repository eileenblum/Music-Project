Night falls across the sky
And penetrates my soul
Lost in absence so alone
From bliss apart forever torn

Dead I live inside the flesh
Where hope no longer dwells at all
My body aches alone
I have to confess my pain before I turn to stone

You were always so far away
Drifting through the channels of my inner prayer
No point is there to keep me here to stay
No fucking meaning can I see in a world of gray

I can see no meaning in life
Forever trapped in a void so merciless and so sterile
My strife into shadows will always remain unknown
I've always wished for a quick death
Or to remain unborn
