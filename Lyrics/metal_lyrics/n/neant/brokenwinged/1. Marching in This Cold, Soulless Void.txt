Marching in this cold soulless void, I wander
My next step into nothingness, I ponder

I lie alone in absence and bewilderment
My pain is a fixed, ruined continuum
As I pray to her old eternal light, I realize
No muse is there to guide me home
Only emptiness, that withers my soul
I take the path of the few
As I know, my hearse will be my truth

I walk the frozen path of time
I endure the emptiness on my skin
I can't go through this nightmare
My fate is aching and bleeds out of my aura

I have no strength remaining to turn the tide
Alone constantly I struggle in an uphill climb
Marching in this cold, soulless void
My pain numbed me to remain a fragment of life destroyed

In frozen cold I march abyss
Obscure is the path to thy glade
No shelter is ever seen from here
As fallen I follow hollow voices I hear
