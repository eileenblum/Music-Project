[musick &amp; lyrixxx - Matt Harvey, 1993]

Churning and warm, your insides I gnaw, I dribble and fuss over the bubbling
pus...  Masticate the foaming carnage, Eviscerated human garbage, Curdling
innards now ground and chewed, Cannibalized torso ensanguined and nude...
Eating the bleeding, the reeking splattered limbs, Now chomping the entrails
to bits, Feeding off seething bowel and intestine, The spurting of enzymes
of swill...  Innards rent and dribbling, Are consumed with sanguinary
delight, The organs and offal are so succulent, The exquisite flavour of
gastro-anal tripe...  I drink the viscous lymphatic fluid, And delight in
the consistency and flavour, The putrid aftertaste of masticated bowel,
Meets with my overwhelming favour...  I slobber as I dine, I suck the marrow
from your spine, I gobble the feotid faecal matter, With no regard to my
table manners...
