[Sarcofago Cover]

[musick &amp; lyrixxx - Sarcofago, 1989]

Inside my freedom
I'm slaved
By those tastes of lust and evil
I cannot escape

I ever hear a voice
A voice that is my sign
Sex, drinks &amp; metal
The destiny of my life!

Beware
I'm alive
And licensed to:

Sex, drinks &amp; metal

Some forces tried to stop me
But I destroy them with my hate
'cause in blood I will have my revenge
I'm not worried if it happens late

I'm living in sin
And it's a hard way of life
But in sex, drinks &amp; metal
I will die!!!
