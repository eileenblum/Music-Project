I'm open arms and ready for the end.
Sell me to the sea and let me be one with the wind.
Such a glorious apocalypse.
Our thrones have burned to the ground.
We have ruined a life worth living.
We have done ourselves in.
The muffled screams will now be heard along with the voices that've never spoken.
This is the end of the youth that I knew.
I would die for a generation of lost souls.
A generation of so many lost souls.
We were meant for ruin.
