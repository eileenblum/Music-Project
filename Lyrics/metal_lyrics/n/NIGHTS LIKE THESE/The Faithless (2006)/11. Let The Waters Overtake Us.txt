Wait up for me, I've been running forever.
My heart has been beating too slow to catch up with my feet.
So this is what it's like to be alone.
I never thought I'd end up like this.
And for the first time in my life I find myself on my knees (reaching up) to the sky.
I am the greatest of all pretenders.
You will never know how my insides burn.
Please don't wake me up.
My soul hurts to even be.
What have I found in this life of mine except that no one can ever find true happiness without finding it within themselves first? I shouldn't have to feel this way.
No one should have to feel this way.
Sometimes the only way out, is giving in.
