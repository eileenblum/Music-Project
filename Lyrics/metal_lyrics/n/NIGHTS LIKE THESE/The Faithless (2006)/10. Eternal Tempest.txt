When we fly, we can't fall bitter, the devastation haunts me and you.
You all dropped dead in place.
In place you rise.
The ones who speak, fight me off.
I am mute.
Convinced are those who hear me speak.
They never really heard.
Let sleep my restless spirit bring peace within me.
The anchor that binds me.
The wind that engulf me.
It swallows me whole.
