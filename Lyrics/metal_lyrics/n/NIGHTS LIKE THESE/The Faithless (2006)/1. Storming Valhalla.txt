With each step I can feel the ground shake as if we were to die this very instant.
We bleed like running water.
We are alone in this.
You're dead to me.
Welcome home in a bodybag.
You have no morals left and your love is lustful one.
Follow me to the edge, let's hold hands and die together.
I can't look up for the life of me.
I can't take seeing and empty sky once more.
We have killed ourselves and slit our wrists dry.
Each and every one of us.
