When will we notice, the faces we see everyday?
The ones that matter most are the ones that I will see pass before me when I go.
I can't but help to wish we'd all be stuck here and never grow, never leave, never change.
I will never forget you.
I'm so sick of all the so-called failures and the blame we put on ourselves.
There is so much more to this.
There is so much more when you have given up on the world and whatever holds us past the sky.
