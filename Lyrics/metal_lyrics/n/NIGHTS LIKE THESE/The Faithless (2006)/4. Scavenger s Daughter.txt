This is the director's cut.
The version where the rest of us don't get left out.
For what it's worth, I've always cared, just never wanted it show it.
We've always wanted more but now it's time to take it.
It's come from making love on the altar to dining with savage souls.
Forgive me, I was born a plague into my mother's arms.
I am the black cloud that ruins your day.
I am the voice that never goes away.
We are the faithless and thou shall take no pity on me.
Gone but not forgotten.
Your demons will be left in your coffin.
These eyes are bloodshot from no sleep but I will never sleep again.
