Engines are turning with nothing to run them.
But the going gets tougher as the years roll on.
Remember way back when? We need something new.
Something better.
Not broken and fixed.
We are the medicated zombies roaming the earth with our empty bodies.
I wasn't able to do this before but now I'm letting go.
I am falling apart.
You are falling apart.
I am falling apart.
We are falling apart.
This city is dying but we were already dead.
