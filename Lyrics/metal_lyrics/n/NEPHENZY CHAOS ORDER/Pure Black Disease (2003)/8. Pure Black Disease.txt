How does it feel to be dead inside?
How does it feel to have nothing but pain?
Kneel to your lust and make it go away.

I will show you the way!
The only true way
So come here
And receive my gift.

Pure black disease
I give to the world.
Pure black disease
Oblivion, my friend.
Pure black disease
I am the way.

If you ask me what I feel for this world
My answer will be remorse.
Remorse, because I could not end it until now.
The fruit of my labor is what you get.
I am the Purifier, your last sight of humanity.

Now my mission soon will end
Because my visions spread like aids,
I am fucking your precious world
Giving you my sickness and joy.

Pure black disease
I give to the world.
Pure black disease
Oblivion, my friend.
Pure black disease
I am the way.

Completed it is,
My pure black disease,
And you will exist
In dust and painful memories.
