You shall feel my power.
You shall taste my strength
When your souls are burning.
I shall rule again

Upon my throne of hatred.
I look down on my slaves
Little child of light
You will bleed again

DEATH MANIFESTO

I step down from my throne.
With vengeance I strike again
My visions where carved in stone
A thousand years ago

Power from the strongest
Fire be thy name
I crush your whole existence
War shall rule again...
