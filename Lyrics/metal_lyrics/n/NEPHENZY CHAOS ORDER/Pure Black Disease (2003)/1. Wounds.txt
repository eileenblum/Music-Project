Leave my wounds open,
'Cause I am not here to heal.
Leave my veins pumping,
'Cause I am not here to live.

Cut my wounds bigger,
'Cause pain is all I have.
Don't stop my blood from spilling,
'Cause life is just despair.

Burn my fucking body,
I'll burn for you in hell.
Fierce thoughts of anguish,
Exploding in my brain.

Treat me like your garbage,
'Cause I am not worth the pain.
Treat me like a tumour,
'Cause that is what I am.

Leave my wounds open,
'Cause I am not here to heal.
Leave my veins pumping,
'Cause I am not here to live.
And when this life is over
My destiny is fulfilled.
