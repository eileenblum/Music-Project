If it is to be only
an element of a whole,
to hide behind others
and form the eclipse of mind.
Ignominious And Pale.

If it were to one
having nothing to tell,
this would equal
a state of being the one,
ignominious and pale.

Fallen in the abyss of indignity,
doubt does not exist
or come into being. Pale...

Incarceration of personality
is the sad inception of self-denial.
The one that denies the inner self
flees into deception.

[Solo: Suicmez]

Incarceration of personality
is the sad inception of self-denial.
