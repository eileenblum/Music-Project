EXTREMIZATION OF BIOLOGICAL REDUCTIONISM CONCEPT
HUMANITY REDUCED TO MERE SHELLS
FROM THEORY TO PRACTICE 
MAN IS NOTHING MORE THAN A MACHINE
INSIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS SOLDERED 
IN A WAYMORE COMPLEX CIRCUIT BOARD

HUMAN ORGANS ARE SIMPLY SPARE PARTS
DECEASES ARE A SOURCE OF RICHNESS
MINDS ARE INSTRUMENT OF CONTROL
FAITH IS A PRISON
A PLACE TO CONFINE WORTHLESS EXISTENCES
TURNED TO BLIND AUTOMATONS 
A DESPICABLE PILE OF SENSORS

DENYING THE MEANING 
OF THE ORIGINAL CONCEPTION
BY NOW THE MANKIND WILL BE TREATED
LIKE SOMETHINGTHAT IS 
CAPABLE OF BEING CONSUMED
A DISPOSABLE PRODUCT 
DESIGNED ONLY TO BE USED AND THEN DISCHARGED
WRITING THE ELEGY FOR THE FLESH

INESORABLY THE PROCESS OF 
HUMAN MECHANIZATION
CONTINUE EXPLOITING 
THE WEAKNESSOF THE SUBJECTS
MERCILESSLY CYNICALLY CRUSHING 
THEIR FEEBLE RESISTANCE
ERASING EVERY TRACE 
OF THE PRIMORDIAL ESSENCE

[Solo A. DE MURO]

THE WEIGHT IS UNBEARABLE 
FOR ALL THOSE WHO REFUSE 
EVERY FORM OF SUBMISSION
THEIR KNOWLEDGE IS A BLADE 
POINTEDAGAINST THEMSELVES
SHUDDERING TO THE THOUGHT 
OF BECAME CONSCIOUSLY A PART 
OF THIS CORRUPT MECHANISM

AN INFINITE RESERVE 
OF FLESH FOR EXPERIMENTATION
FORCED REPRODUCTION AND TRANSPLANTING
A CONSUMABLE OF A SOPHISTICATED DEVICE
