WATCHING WITH PITY AND SCORN
HUMANITY CREEPING LIKE RATS
MECHANICALLY FED WITH LIES
CONSUME THE FLESH OF THEIR GOD

ANXIOUSLY AWAITING WITH IMPOTENT EYES
THE AXE OF MARTIRIZATION FALL ON THEIR HEAD
THEIR VAIN HOPES ARE WRAPPED
IN A SACRED SHROUD WOVEN WITH BIGOTRY

SCROLL BETWEEN THE FINGERS BLOODY ROSARIES
MARKING THE INELUCTABLE ADVANCING OF TIME
WHEN THE ATROCIOUS DOUBT 
NESTED IN THEIR MINDS
THEIR EXISTENCE IS IMAGE AND LIKENESS
OF THE POOR GOD THEY ADORE
CONSCIOUS OF THY WEAKNESS OF THY DESOLATION
A QUESTION HURTS LIKE A STAB IN THEIR BRAIN
WHY HIS FATHER HAS ABANDONED HIM

[Solo A. LOCCI]

EAT THY SACRED FLESH DRINK THY BLOOD
AND YOU WILL BE SAFE FROM THE TRUTH AND REASON
BLINDLY FOLLOW
EAT THY SACRED FLESH DRINK THY BLOOD
AND YOU WILL BE SAFE FROM THE TRUTH AND REASON
DO THE SIGN OF THE CROSS
BLINDED BY THY SIGHT

[Solo A. LOCCI]

ANNIHILATED UNDER THY PROTECTIVE WING
