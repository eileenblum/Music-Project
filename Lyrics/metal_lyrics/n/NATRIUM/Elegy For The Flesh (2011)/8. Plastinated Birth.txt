DEATH LIVES THROUGH ART
GUIDE THE ARTISTâS HAND
TO CARVE BODIES
TO CREATE HUMAN SCULPTURES
A GALLERY OFFLESH MASTERPIECES

PLASTINATED REBIRTH 
FROM THE ETERNAL SLEEP
TO ADMIRE THE BODY COMPLEXITY

ATAVIC DESIRES OF ETERNITY
CHASING THE DREAM
TO BECOME FOREVER IMMORTAL
TO RISE FROM THE DEAD 
AS AN ARTWORK

THE VOLUNTEERS DONâT FULFILL
THE NEED FOR BODIES
NEW CREATIONS
MADE WITH UNKNOWN CADAVERS
TREATED LIKE RAW MATERIALS
THEIR HEAD SLICED
THEIR ORGANS EXPOSED
THEIR BLOOD REPLACED WITH RESINS
STRIPPED OF ALL THEIR DIGNITY

NEED FOR MORE FRESH CORPSES
THE OBSESSION TO CREATE
TO RISE ABOVE PUTREFACTION

MANIACAL ANATOMY
SYNTHESIZED IN THIS MACABRE EXPOSITION
REPRESENTATION OF HUMAN FRAGILITY

A LONG AND CHALLENGING PROCESS
TO DEFY THE LAWS OF NATURE

PLASTINATED REBIRTH
