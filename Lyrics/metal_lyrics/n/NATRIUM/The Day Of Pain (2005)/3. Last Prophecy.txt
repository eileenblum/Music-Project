Shadows of my past have come back last night
Future is uncertain and confuse
I see a mirror without my face
Hundreds of spirits and abuses

Long corridors of sadness separate our souls
Infinity is a little bit more than me
I've known dead for much time
The war is won and gone

Behind last mountain I see the world
In the middle there's only a little part
Behind last prophecy I see the world

Immortal grasslands let space to the progress
Fastest winds run only for kill
Trees and half-men are taken away
I see the first fire of this land

streets are not clean - world in my hands
tear up the judge - brain sight
