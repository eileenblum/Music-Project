Inner devastation - It's like I feel
It's as a domination - But it's all real

People that can find you - In time to dissapear
They can't understand you - They can still you kill

Rage, lie, life, death

Like a murder doll - I am dancing now
A game not in my hand - Laughing with loud

Don't trust in nothing - It's a deadly fault
They can only lieing - No trust!

Rage, lie, life, death

Never ending distance - Between life and death
I see near and far - It not has any back

Falling all the darkness - But I can't see the light
Nothing I feel inside me - And the dark is bright

Rage, lie, life, death

I can't see the end - Of this day of pain
It's bleeding in my brain - It's hunger of revange

It's spreading its big wings - Behind it there's a man
It was his day of pain - This man with my face
