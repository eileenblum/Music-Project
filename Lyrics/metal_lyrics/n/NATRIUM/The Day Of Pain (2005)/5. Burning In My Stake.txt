Old faces run through time and space - Farewell last dance of hypocrisy
Something changes my mind so in my face - Don't misunderstand it's too much easy

Lies writing my designe - I'm burning in my stake
For all my mistakes - They tread on my heart and on my face

I fell down and I broke down the bell  - Omnipotent presence saves our hell
bell sings our last hour - This change can be a growth

Try to keep the last time
Desire to desdain your race
Of terror that pumping inside my mind
They think to deviate the rain
