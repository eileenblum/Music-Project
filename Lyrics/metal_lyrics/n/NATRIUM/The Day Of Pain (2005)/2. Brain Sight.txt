He's always there - where you lived him
always ready to hit - always ready to kill
He doesn't listen to you - your words are shit
manifest of your life - is the war low

streets are not clean - world in my hands
tear up the judge - brain sight

He's waiting for you - nothing can be better
only to suffer more - another fear

Praise your gods - to save your soul
