...And the blood gushed forth...

From one world to another, one slavery to another
Darkness to follow eternal perversion calls you
Eyes, black eyes, filled with demise when you realize you're mine
At last tonight you please all death desires

Beauty has to be punished, the punishment is beauty itself

A butterfly, cut off wings left to die
A stab into perfection, ugliness rewarded
Eyes cold dead, spots in crimson red
Burnt flesh pus, oozing larva nest

In filth you crawl
Of filth reborn

Dreamt of this before

Passing through the dead dreams door

Skin ripped apart, boiling with flies
Deadly dream, bringing death into your sleep
Claustrophobic panic rising, dreamt of this before
Passing through the dead dreams door

Asleep alive no more life
Captured in endless spiral demise
Deadly dream, your body and your mind
Forever lost on the other side

Skin ripped apart, boiling with flies
Deadly dream, bringing death into your sleep
Claustrophobic panic rising, dreamt of this before
Passing through the dead dreams door

Filth crawl reborn
Nightmare's no more

Like the serpent swallowing its tail, destroy yourself
No matter how much you beg or fucking pray

God will never again be on your side

I tell you
I told you

From one world to another, one slavery to another
Darkness to follow eternal perversion calls you
Eyes, black eyes, filled with demise when you realize you're mine
At last tonight you please all death desires
