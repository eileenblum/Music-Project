The wicked plot unravels, the day of doom
Demons ejaculate in the cunts of angels

Endless battle roar, endless hate for all
Collide, shatter, deform

Chants of evil, verses of death
Spawn of obscurity

You will see blasphemy
Ejected from chasity's womb
When purity dies, you can't deny
Oozing placenta of rotten disgust

Women lay with their offspring
On the altar of sickness
To spew forth abomination of mankind

Deformed, corrupt, depraved
The dead arise from their graves
Deflowering the children of purity
Maggot infested

Plot revealed
Omen of disease
Treacherous priest
Of blasphemy

Kill decency
Depravity
Day of doom
The dead walk the earth

You will see blasphemy
Cast out from purity's womb
When virtue dies, you can't deny
The morbid phallus ejects the demon seed

Deformed, corrupt, depraved
The dead arise from their graves
Deflowering the children of purity
Maggot infested impiety

The wicked plot unravels, the day of doom
Demons ejaculate in the cunts of angels
