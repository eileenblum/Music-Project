No law or order, machete corruption 
Judgement in the twilight zone, revenge is called upon 
Inner sanctum in the heart of dark and light 
The Loa guide never divides, Bokonâs time to punish has arrived 

Gain strength through ritual sacrifice 

Poison drug is prepared, the process starts, you will appear dead 
A dark world that drives you insane, into the coffin youâre now laid 
From behind the wall in your nightmare crypt, the sobs of your loved ones you hear 
Paralyzed and low of life, youâre about to be buried alive 

Dirt in your tomb, darkness embraces 
You never got a chance to get away 
Loved ones gone 
New life in zombie slavery 

Insects crawling upon the skin 
No strength to move 
Still paralyzed down in this hell hole 

Eyes turn white 
From the grave reborn 

Dirt in your life 

Beginning in the end, supression and abuse 
Only terror and emptiness behind those lifeless eyes 
Once free now under the masters whip of slavery 
Future bear nothing but pain, zombies only release is in death 

Dirt in your tomb
