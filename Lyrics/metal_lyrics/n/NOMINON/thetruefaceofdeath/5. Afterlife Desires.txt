I find scratching at the coffin lid
Smashing through the carpenter's work with great strength
Your near ones, mourners, left long ago
You're all mine now

How I wish you could rise
How I wish you'd look into my eyes
But you stare blindly into the dark
Yet I pretend you're smiling

I need your cold gray skin against mine
Penetrating every rotten hole, drooling in your face
Taste your flesh, wish mine would taste the same
Panic strikes me, I vomit upon your chest

How I wish you would rise
How I wish you'd look into my eyes
But you just lie there
Yet I pretend you're dead

We cannot meet like this, but still, you're all I have
I must stab my flesh and prepare for the next life
Each sharp edge to my life makes my urge stronger
