Bodies devoured in a frenzed manner, death comes slow
Lost litte puppets of death and fate, they won't show
Darkness made of white downfall, frozen grave
Lashing towards you at speeds unknown, white death rave

Blizzards cast by satans hand, diabolic fate
Lift your head in fear and witness deat's true face
Incredible mass of burial ground coming through
Inverted desert on glacier fields entombs you

[Chorus:]
No escape, no time for panic
Psychotic thought, you know you're trapped
Cannot move, your dreams go manic
Asphyxiation, released from the pestilence called life

Satanic winds, you feel them coming, scars your skin
Raging cold and a distant rumble, you can't win
Standing helpless against him might, watch his grin
The winter of your perishment, settles deep within

The white death celebration of nature, as it takes toll
For you the missing soul and body, the bells will toll
White death, final breath, casked bed of ice
White death, total death, you will not be born again

[Chorus]

Death comes slow
End of life
End comes slow
Death is life

Lost are they when buried by nature ruled by his hand

[Chorus]

Bodies devoured in a frenzed manner, death comes slow
Lost litte puppets of death and fate, they won't show
Darkness made of white downfall, frozen grave
Lashing towards you at speeds unknown, white death rave

Blizzards cast by satans hand, diabolic fate
Lift your head in fear and witness deat's true face
Incredible mass of burial ground coming through
Inverted desert on glacier fields entombs you
