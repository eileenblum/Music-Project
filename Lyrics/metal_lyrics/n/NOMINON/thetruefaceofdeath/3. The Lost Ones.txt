[Prologue:]
From a time before time
From a land beyond the stars
A war of angels has passed
Back when anu walked the earth
Dark angels now approach
Converting the peace into war

Oh, wicked god
Oh, wicked demon
Spirit of the sky, remember
Oh, wicked god
Oh, wicked demon
Spirit of the earth, rememb

The angels of light are impaled
We hail the age of nominon
We have surivived the first war
Between the power of the gods
We have witnessed the wrath of the ancient ones
On the top of mountains
Beneath the soil of the seas

We are the lost ones

We have survived the wrath
Of good and evil powers
We have spoken to scorpions
But our allegiance was betrayed
Promised never to be attacked again
But the gods are forgetful
We have survived the first war
Between the powers of the gods

Neither of light or darkness
Beneath the world lies sleeping
The deity of Chtulu
Will lead us to victory
To fight immortal foes and gods
That's our destiny surpreme
With winds of war and evil
We allie with demands of hell

We, from a race beyond the wanderers of night

Oh, wicked god
Oh, wicked demons
