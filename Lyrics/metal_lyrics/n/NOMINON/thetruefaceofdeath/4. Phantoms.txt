Before god's creation evil roamed the earth
Countless years awaiting mass rebirth
Sheltered by secret caves while biding its time
Now awaken from its slumber, to end the human race

Unleashed phantoms descend
Spawned by evil
They feed upon your flesh and sanity
Your morbid nightmares become reality

Infected by abominated seed, a part of evil itself
All hope is lost, abandones by Jesus Christ
Extinction at dusk
Chaos in the flesh

Mankind's existence will end before dawn
As the phantoms sweep the wastelands to conquer human souls
A pile of rotten corpses a symbol of the war
Mother earth is crying, she's drowning in human blood

Enshrouded by hell, curtains of might
Inhuman incubator of evil itself
Face the truth, the beginning of hte end
Cry out in anguish, no one will live to tell

Infected by aboninated seed, a part of evil itself
All hope is lost, abandoned by Jesus Christ
Extinction at dusk
Chaos, no one will live to tell
