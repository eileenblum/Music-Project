[Music: Juha Sulasalmi, Lyrics: Nicke Holstenson]

Emperor of Valakia anno 1442
They called him Vlad Tepes, also known as Dracul
Invented awful forms of torture, master of impalement
His cruelty was legendary, he's reserved a place in hell
Overthrew his enemies, captured them in cages
One by one they met their fate in the boiling oil

Crushed them to shreds under wheels of torture
Skin them alive while staring at their entrails
Put a stake through the mothers breast and throwing up the infants
Nailed through the arses and out of their mouths

Burn the villages to ashes, impaling everyone
Outside his castle the forest of the dead
Roast them over burning coal screams of pain fill the air
Feast upon his victims well tasting body parts

Chopped up in pieces this bloodbath will never end
As his passion increases
The slaughter will never end
Disrespect for humans lives
Decapitated bodies left to rot on the ground
Son of the dragon
Dark medieval emperor

Disrespect for human life
Decapitated bodies left to rot on the ground
Son of the dragon
Dark medieval emperor
Lord of impalement
Superior power of Transylvania
Son of the dragon
Malicious reign of
Transylvania, Carptia

Women and children crucified
Nailed to the stakes they all
Will die
Showing no mercy to anyone
Senseless slaughter 'til
His battles is won

Son of the dragon

Oh mighty emperor, Lord of impalement
You're the mighty ruler of Transylvania
Over Carpatia
