[Music: Jonas Mattsson, Lyrics: Jonas Mattsson / Nicke Holstenson]

Utmost agony and hate want to end my worthless life
I summon the spirits from hell, darkness urges for my soul
I slit my throat and watch the blood cover the moisty
Ground
My soul starts the journey to become one with evil

I saw weeping angels fall from the sky to burn for eternity
Within
The glorious fire eternal cleanse their putrefying souls
With delight in my eyes, I saw them rise to hail
My lord from hell
Their hearts turned to black, black as
This night of damnation

Superior powers - Raged within
Bring forth - My infant supreme
Cursed realm - Oh, mighty abyss
Untamed reign - Blood Sacrifice
Drink the blood

In the halls of obscurity
Ceremony for sacrificial rites
Raising my dagger to fulfill his
Needs, stabbing with morbid lust
In ecstasy I drink the blood and
Smear the entrails of the infant
Child
I have prevailed, I'm a servant to
The lord of lies, mortal cries

This is the night of damnation
