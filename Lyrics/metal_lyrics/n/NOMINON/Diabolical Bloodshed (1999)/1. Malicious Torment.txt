[Music: Jonas Mattsson / Juha Sulasalmi, Lyrics: Nicke Holstenson]

Lurking in the shadows unseen to mankind
You feel my presence near my eyes staring blind
Malicious tools of torment crave infected blood
Sadistic laughter echoes as I mutilate with lust
Beg for mercy - There's no need
On you blood - I will feed
Penetrate your disfigured cunt
My tools of torment will hunt you down... die

Stalking the misty alleys hatred fills my mind
My blood's pumping faster as a fuckin' whore appears
I cut her abdomen wide open I slit her from ear to ear
And carving out the entrails with morbid insanity

They'll never know the reason why,
Why they had to die
Dismembered pieces on the floor
You've paid your price fuckin' whore... just die

Another slut approaching that cocksucking pig must die
In disgust I swing my axe and split her fuckin' skull
My tools of torment plunge deeper into a lifeless heart
Ripping out the eyeballs reflecting the shape of a reaper

They'll never know the reason why
Why they had to die
Dismembered pieces on the floor
You've paid your price, fuckin' whore
Yearning - Screams of pain in the night
Your body trembling with fright
Feel the embrace of death
As you take your last... breath
Feel my embrace of death
As you take your last... breath

Die you worthless cunt

I'll baptize you in torment
I'll baptize you in blood
I'll slash you beyond recognition
As my bloodlust is proceeding endlessly

Malicious torment

[Dedicated to the infamous butcher J.T. Ripper who stalked the streets of London anno 1888]
