[Music: Juha Sulasalmi, Lyrics: Nicke Holstenson]

Almighty powers has been unleashed upon this earth
The sun no longer shine, darkness embraces the world
Pure instant evil that knows no bounds
All angels sentenced to extinction, the new era has begun

Put your faith upon the holy cross
You shall be perished by the force of Armageddon

Once betrayed by the light, now seeking for his vengeance
(Now hear his command)
Behead the Nazarene, no holy ghost shall rise
Unleash the hordes of hell, crucify the priest of lies
Summon the hounds of darkness, let them stalk this
Infected world

Burst out in hatred, slay the lambs of God
Rape the Harlot nuns
Burn them at the stake, decapitate them all
Tear out their hearts

Curse the Ten Commandments, despise the holy law
Crush the pearly gate, enslaving all the weak

Hold his banner high, desolate the sacred church
Invert the holy cross
When heaven forever burns, the victory is ours
The victory is ours

Put your faith upon the holy cross
You shall be perished by the force of Armageddon
