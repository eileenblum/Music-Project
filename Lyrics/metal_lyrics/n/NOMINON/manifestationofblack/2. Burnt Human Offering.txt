I am the incubus from beyond
Step aside and behold the might
Unquestioning obedience of the dark
Annihilation of all that is sacred.

No more lies in the name of holy one.

Handmade scriptures will guide us
Beneath the kingdom of death
Through passages dripping of disgust
Built out of the purest malevolence.

Bodies on bodies, Burnt human offering
Sacrifices to the dead
Limbs on limbs, Burnt human offering
Volcanic bloodshed.

Repulsive paths of entangled chaos
Inhuman entities cutting throats
Place for the final separation from God
All saints and prophets fall from grace.

Ritualistic obsession of repugnance
The triumphant return of the reaper.

Irreligious laws obeyed and followed
Determined ghouls under oath
Before  the final separation from God
All saints and prophets fall from grace.

Handmade scriptures will guide us
Beneath the kingdom of death
Through passages dripping of disgust
Built out of the purest malevolence.

Bodies on bodies, Burnt human offering
Sacrifices to the dead
Limbs on limbs, Burnt human offering
Volcanic bloodshed.
