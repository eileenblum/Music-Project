Kneel to the God that is here to betray you
Glorification and sanctification of all awaits
The holy fiction known to man as eternal life
Consecrated lambs eager to inhale the lies.

Manifestation of black, ceremony of doom
Manifestation of black, worship and die.

The order of the new cult stand united as one
Obey and welcome the last and final command
No repent when the blade cuts through the dirt
Soldiers from Hell soaking in enemies filth.

Manifestation of black, ceremony of doom
Manifestation of black, worship and die.

Decapitation of the one that owns thee
Your mind and soul skullfucked and torn
Now let us hear what you have to say
When the venomous vultures are here to slay.

No more life.

There's no flesh and blood on the other side
Endless flames of plagues and disgust
Mighty insects rumbles in rapture
Kingdom gone through a blaze from below.

Manifestation of black, ceremony of doom
Manifestation of black, worship the end.
