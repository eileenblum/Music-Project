Host and hostage
Hostile virus spread
Horrible infectious disease
Ebola breed

Iâm your dying body now
E-B-O-L-A
Disolved from the inside, you turn back to clay
Host and hostage
Hostile virus spread
Horrible infectious disease
Ebola breed

Hospital visit
Wounds cover skin
Warm blood pours out from every hole (of your soul)
Strapped to the bed
White cloth, bled through
Unable to cure and heal

A devilâs creation
Satanic fever
Inverted life, final rest
Inside a mess

Hospital visit
Wounds cover skin
Warm blood pours out from every hole (of your soul)

Rotting world
The black plague returns
No mercy, no life spared
Piece by piece
Degraded and deformed
E-B-O-L-A prevails

Host and hostage
Hostile virus spread
Horrible infectious disease
Ebola breed

Iâm your dying body now
E-B-O-L-A
Disolved from the inside, you turn back to clay
