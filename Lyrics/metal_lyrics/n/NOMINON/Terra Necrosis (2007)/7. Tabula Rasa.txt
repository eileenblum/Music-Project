A blank page to form and fill
The abstract absurdity to get control of my dreams
Shattered thoughts inflict with reality
My mind sets off on a journey on its own into misery

Anger, aggression out of control
The mind living on its own
Can never be saved
Just condemned my-self to death
Surrender my will, Iâm about to explode
How can I bear this horrible truth?
Something I canât understand

So many things I want you to know

Enemies behind every face
Every one wants to see me dead
Spinning thoughts in an endless loop
A ticking bomb waiting to explode

So many things I can never undo

A victim of my own dark sickness
An outcome no one ever could forsee
It was not me but a monster inside
Paranoia desperation set free

If you for a while could be me
So that I clearly could see
So many things I didnât know I was able to do
Like the murder of you

Canât repair what I caused
A horror world swirls around
An escape from disillusion
Please hand me the solution

No turning back, for once Iâm clear in my head
Can only end this by my own hand
Is this how I can repay my deeds?
This is what I can do at least
The page I can not reset, my future lies after death
