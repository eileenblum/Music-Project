Dark side about to be exposed
The deck of card piled up before his eyes
As the character âfoolâ awaiting doom
In need of guidance youâre eaesily fooled

Card by card â the secret torn apart
The great arcane foretold what to do
Cut by cut â future laid to waste
Life vanished right before the face

Inside a truth you canât deny
Tarot triggers your weak mind into a world of lies

Thirteen the card of death staring him in the face
That of what all life depends
The grin of the reaper daring him to face his fate
Severe judgement drawn to the inevitable end
No chance when life versus death

Fate lies in the hands of perdition
Persuade into deathlike decision
Life has never felt so short
When you know itâs gone tomorrow

Undeniable â still in denial?
It ends right here
Illusion â Arcane

Card by card â the secret torn apart
The great arcane foretold what to do
Cut by cut â future laid to waste
Life vanished right before the face

Inside a truth you canât deny
Tarot triggers your weak mind into a world of lies
The fool believed the deceiving words
