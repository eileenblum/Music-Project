Gun cocked and loaded to blast the sin
Burn â for our faults youâll pay
God forgive, brutal and supreme
Creating war, nothing but pain
Beliefs made up by the human race
No way to deny, God has to pay
Sacrifices and martyr death
Celebrated and given a reward in hell

Wherever you look
Wherever you turn
Hell below as well as above

God must be proud in his heaven home
Spreading the wicked word from a murder throne
Disciples force beliefsupon tribes
With history way beyond Christ

Isnât all just a greedy conspiracy
To claim the world their own
To judge other peoples choice
And ways to them unknown
Man never learns from history
It will repeat itself into infinity
A sinister world â with a hell above

Referring to the holy world
Adjusting it to their world
You will come clean whatever the fuck you do

Wherever you look
Wherever you turn
Hell below as well as above

Fanatics shown what religion is all about
Blood all over and Godâs work is done
God works in fucked up ways
I bet it sucks to be Godâs son
