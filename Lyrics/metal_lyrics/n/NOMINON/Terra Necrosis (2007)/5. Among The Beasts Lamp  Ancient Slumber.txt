Day of reckoning, day of resurrection
Monstrous entity worshipped as God
Early myth from the beginning of life
The testimony of ancient times
As the old one woke

A beast with thousand faces
Unleashed from its crypt cages
Nightmare of humanity
Worldwide insanity

Tentacle creature surmounted over the earth

A head octopus like grotesque
Finally displacing humanity forever to rest

Risen from the water depth of the city Râlyeh
Slaughter and mindless violence followed
As the great beast dragon wings
Cast shadows over man
A head octopus like grotesque

Tentacle creature surmounted over the earth
Finally displacing humanity forever to rest

Among the beasts and ancient slumber

A head octopus like grotesque
Finally displacing humanity forever to rest

Rituals from dark ages summon hellish madness
Words not to be written
Spells not to be spoken
Oh, wicked being, monstrous God
Unleashed from its crypt cages
Free from ancient slumber the beast will kill

The old oneâs awake

KAOS!
