Concrete skeleton
Mighty monument
Giant grave
Everlasting death

Air reeks of disturbance
Core melts all devotion
Deadly doses
No time to evacuate

Nothing alive, not for a while, thousand years to pass
All infected souls dissected, all the cells collapsed
Enter the ghost town â Pripyat gone

Reign of Chernobyl doom

A pulse so strong still carries on into aeons to come

Marked and abandoned deserted land left
Life swept away in decay
Trapped in the steel and concrete core
The end of all

All life vanished into magnificent chaos

Air reeks of disturbance
Core melts all devotion
Deadly doses
No time to evacuate

A visit in the ultimate dead spot
Melted from radiation, prepare for devastation

Reign of Chernobyl doom

Life extinct
Concrete skeleton
Mighty monument
Giant grave of mankind fall

Life extinct
