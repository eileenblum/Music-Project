Thousand years of repression
Forcefed with lies since the beginning
Oppression in the shadow of the cross
No belief I'm your scapegoat
Behold the new era has finally come

Revoked is the presence of god
Repulse soaked in blood

Holy words infect their minds, believing the lie
Everyone kill each other now
The saints go marching into death
No miracles payback time, there's no escape now

War is your miracle, is fear what you teach
Pain to disbelief, torture is honour
Commandments to gain control
Everyone broken by your own
The last chapter will finally be written in blood

Words carved in flesh will remain
In life even in death

Guilty of innocent slaughter
Your greedy crusade to convert
Revenge! Echoes from the past
The innocent souls will claim your death
The bitter end

Always proclaimed others imperfection
What you seek you'll find within yourself
Raped by religion a sign of trust?
By their own misled deceived betrayed
Erase yourself

Prayers for the prey
Not even aware ehat they obey
Damned, cursed wrath seeks revenge
Hate, death nothing will be
The same again

You can't come clean, no more confessions
To your false icon
Into diabolic netherworld
Recremation until there is nothing left
Darkness gather upon you
