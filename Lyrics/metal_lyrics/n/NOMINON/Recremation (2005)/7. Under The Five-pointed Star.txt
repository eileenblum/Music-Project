Out of chaos universe beyond
Upon the sky stars has formed the sign
The pentagram
"How long we've been waiting for
This to come the birth of the evil son"
Oh, godless goddess Venus of the dark
Mysterious orgy in sinful lust

With combined force of the five
Ignis, Aer, Aqva, Terra and light
A carnal feast to create
The offspring
That will grow within
Vibrations of the heathen chants
Spawn in black seed

Bearer of the light Lucifer
The star born tonight
A cermenony of elements
When four becomes five
The deep and the skies
Join with soil and inferno

With combined force of five
Ignis, Aer, Aqva, Terra and light
"At last the sacrilegious wins
A bond in all seven sins"
From chaos from universe beyond
Stars has formed the sign
The pentagram
