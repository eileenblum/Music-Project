In the search for the supreme power
The supreme force
Gave my soul swallowed by darkness

One with the dark
One with the unknown

All are summoned tonight's the night
When light turns black
And everything is destined to die

One with the supreme
One with the end

The ancient will rise
Believers/deniers face the end
Face the abyss drowned by its might
Eyes from the depth staring back at you
Into black our journey goes

Into black swallowed by death

Faces of desperation
Horror has them by the throat
We already knew

End has reached us all
World swirls into a vortex
And darkness swallows all

One with the ancient
One with Chtulhu

All are summoned tonight's the night
When light dies out
And everything turns into black
