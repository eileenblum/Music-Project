Preserved for the rest of the world
An exhibition of our specimen
A reflection of life in dead tissue
Study your entrails in the mirror of dead flesh

Malaise
Corpse after corpse
Lined up in the show
Penetration
An anatomical trip inside us all
Relentless
Lesson in human art
The dead
Resculptured

Cysts in the upper kidney pole
Malignant tumours eating from inside
Multiple forms of cancer organs
Our fragile life on display

Malaise
Corpse after corpse
Lined up in the show
Penetration
An anatomical trip inside us all
Relentless
Lesson in cause of death
The dead
Resculptured

Dead sadistic art see what you will become
One of them one of those gone gaping craniums
Staring at you whisper what awaits you

With precision body slices in intersection
So vulnerable without skin to protect you
Preserved and saved from decomposition
A reflection of life a memory of how it was before
