[bonus LP track]

[Whiplash Cover]

Ruthless and evil lies that deceive
Meaningless virtues knee deep in greed

I am the master with the iron fist
I am the master no one knows exists
I am the master I'll take your life
I am the master I'll spit on your grave
Taking advantage guilty as sin
And into the cauldron where no one can win

Thrown down and stepped on and knifed in the back
Civilization is under attack.
