Days are outnumbered a crumbling sky blackens the sun
Slow deformation decay from day one
With the first breath the final follows
With life death will follow

Born in blood and pain from our mother's womb
We crawl the way straight to the tomb from
The first day cursed you are doomed
Earth to ashes dissolved into dust
To live to die is life just a lie?

Born in a casket condemned at arrival
Safe only when you're dead

Rejected in vomit and pus from your
Mother's cunt in slime you crawl the path for
The time will come the time when everyone
Die suffer through the short but extracted atrocity
To live to die life was just a lie!

Condemned to die

Disease sickness mutilation
Destiny will come for us all
Murder suicide war
Awaiting death to claim my soul

When you die - you soul dissolve
Pathological examination will show
Disturbing images of the true life

Awaiting as life passes by
No chance to avoid this time
Hopelessness the end in sight
Finally death embraces life

Days are outnumbered a crumbling sky blackens the sun
Slow deformation decay from day one
The final question when life will be put to an end
By a fragile thread you're holding on
You will soon be gone

The final solution your options to choose is laid t your feet
Take control of your fate and make a mess of yourself
For the curious mass the pathological dissection will reveal
What life is all about what you already knew to die

Condemned to die.
