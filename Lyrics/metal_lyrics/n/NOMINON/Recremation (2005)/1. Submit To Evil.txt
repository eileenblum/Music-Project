Handmade of darkness
black magic is the game
An urge and power to control
Let the devil capture your soul

At the altar of bones
Remains of the ancestors
A doll made of cloth
A puppet a reproduction of you

Flames sweep closer and closer
Time for needle torture

Burning pain paralysed
Vital organs marked
Eyes open wide filled with fright
You're on your way down

You are mine for humiliation
No pulse no heartbeat equals dead
Lifeless but alive inside
No breath no moves you're in hell

No understanding with a dead mind
Watch in apathy you're hollow

Tate the sweetness
Needle in deeper in
Captured into weakness
Infernal pain
Now you're my slave

No objection no rejection
Submit to evil just submission

An empty shell A shell of flesh
I cast my spell now be my slave
Submit to evil surrender your soul
The spell is spoken
It can't ever be broken!

No objection no rejection
Submit to evil just submission
