Death is in me
The world ends here
Hell returns
As I consume the stars
The sun will perish
And darkness covers all
Sunrise will die
When earth becomes a thrall

Eternal night will descend
Through shadows where light were spread
All the beauty, all the pity will drown
Reigning terror in the city of the dead

Moaning agony is whispered in the wind
Count your sins
The serpents will arise
Wings of damnation, death and dust
Trumpets of the one is the world's demise

[Solo - Alex]

Women and children will be blessed in fire
Lakes and seas will turn into steam
Gusts of smoke erupts into the air
While earth turns into one deafening scream
