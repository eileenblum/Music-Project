Assassination of the lambs
Violence's a prime company
Don't let them get away
Inhume the fuckers, six feet down

Disgusted by their defective mind
Useless abhorrent parasites
The wrath of the hatchet's in command
Decapitated. Amputated. Dead

The rattle of my axe
A savage noise of triumph
Necro to the core
Face the inquisitor, embrace Hell

Disgusted by their defective mind
Useless abhorrent parasites
The wrath of the hatchet's in command
Decapitated. Amputated. Dead

Before the storm
Vicious deranged cruelty 
The power of oppression
Become one with mastery
Sons of the reaper united
Side by side, infinite carnage
Till the day we die

Disgusted by their defective mind
Useless abhorrent parasites
The wrath of the hatchet's in command
Decapitated. Amputated. Dead
