I am the son of the black light
I am the kiss of death
I am the creature you fear at night
I am Leviathan and Seth

I am the tongue from ancient times
Destined to ruin the sacred garden
Plant a seed that will germinate
Into the forbidden psalms of death

With sinister power it increased
Became your definite desolation
All ye phobias and deepest doubts
Lays in the hands of annihilation

I am the son of the black light
I am the kiss of death
I am the creature you fear at night
I am Leviathan and Seth

As you drank, the wine turned to dust
Your faith vanished in dismay
The holy chalice turned into rust
A seal of fate now rules your decay
