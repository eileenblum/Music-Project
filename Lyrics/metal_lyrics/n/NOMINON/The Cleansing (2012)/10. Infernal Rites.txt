There's no glory in boundaries
To serve and hunt is the key
Immortal spirits step forth
Conquering with ancient might
Like lions feasting on fools
Swallowing the traitors souls

No graves left unturned
The legacy is cut in stone
Through gates of madness
Bewitched by glorious destruction

Infernal criminal fire
Blackest rites desire

Starvation for those left behind
Never deceive the storm
And the thunder it holds
Become one with insanity

Infernal criminal fire
Blackest rites desire

[Solo - Alex]

Infernal criminal fire
Blackest rites desire
