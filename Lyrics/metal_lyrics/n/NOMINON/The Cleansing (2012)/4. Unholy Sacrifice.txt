Stench of death. Eyes of fire
Ancient spirit. Hellish pyre
Blasphemic ritual. No help in sight
Awoken death. Unholy night

Blood runs from her breasts
Drips into a chalice
then her soul leaves her body
Drifts into the abyss

A fivepointed star within a ring of chalk
In morbid visions, the dead start to walk

He will take her in the Darkest hour
Prostrate her being to the Ultimate power
Speak the words that you shall not mention
to call on evil in the fourth dimension

Hands of the uncreator through the seventh gate
Reach out for our gift to confiscate

Passway opens. Pitch black hole
Dedicated to the darkness. A virgin soul

Stench of death. Eyes of fire
Ancient spirit. Hellish pyre
Blasphemic ritual. No help in sight
Awoken death. Unholy night

Blood runs from her breasts
Drips into a chalice
then her soul leaves her body
Drifts into the abyss

A fivepointed star within a ring of chalk
In morbid visions, the dead start to walk

Boiling blood pours down on sacred stone
Place the offering beneath the throne
