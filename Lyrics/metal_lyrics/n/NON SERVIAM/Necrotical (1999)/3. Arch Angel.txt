Oh mighty angel, fallen from the sky
Can't you see the tears in my eyes?
The morning star brings me light
And I kneel in reverence and I cry for you

My blood it issues the skin that I carve
Inscribel in circle, a five-pointed star
A soul to heal a need to feel
And to unseal thy powers I cry for you

Liar, tempter, thief, come and take me in your hands
Liar, tempter, thief, I lay my soul into your hands

I cry...
I cry for you
