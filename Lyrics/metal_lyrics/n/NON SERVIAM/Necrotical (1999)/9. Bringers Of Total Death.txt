Your powers so great, oh mother earth
Perchance beyond all imagination
What's made by heroes, made of steel is
Dust that sweeps with your thundering breath
Your powers so frail, oh mother earth
We tear all apart, piece by piece
What's made by heroes, made of steel is
Dust that sweeps with your thundering breath

Our powers so great, oh children of the earth
We're angels of death, preparing our rest
What's made by whom, made of what will
Lie destroyed among bloody bodies
Death, destruction and total disorder
Riders of doom, side by side
What's made by whom, made of what will
Lie destroyed among bloody bodies

Obliteration, desolation, annihilation
We're bringers of total death
