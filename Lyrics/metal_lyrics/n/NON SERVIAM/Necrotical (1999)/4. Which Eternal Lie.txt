Ph'nglui Mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh Wgah'nagl Fhtagn, La! La!
N'ghaa,
N'n'ghai! La! La! Y-hah, Y-nyah, Y-nyah!
N'ghaa, N'n'ghai, Vaf'l Fthaghn - Yog-Sothoth! Yog-Sothoth...!

The wretched man swore the oath
And drew the sign of fire
Gazing up, towards the skies
Aiming for the stars

That is not dead which can eternal lie
And with strange aeons even death may die

Call of Cthulhu
Call of Cthulhu

Old bones I bow for you
Old bones I kneel for you

Mysterious shadows, a cold wind unwind
Forming as one, controlling his mind

Calling forth powers he cannot control
Powers to great for his soul
Evoking that which, rests in R'lyeh
Dreaming and waiting for thee

And as the fire dies, the man lies on the ground
Evil has struck his mind, to powerful to hold
In the centre of the sign a figure is taking form
The portal is open the circle is closed, as the old ones told

Yog-Sothoth arrives from his wicked domain
From far beyond the stars
And he, whose name pronounced must not be
From his palace in Carcosa
Raging inferno, as the old ones return
Returning and claiming their earth
Slaughtering all that come in their way
So long they've awaited this day

All that is human, extirpated
All that man has built, devasted

Corpses and blood cover the earth
The old ones are in power
But at distant places the elder Gods
Prepares to set earth free of evil

That is not dead which can eternal lie
And with strange aeons even death may die

Call of Cthulhu
Call of Cthulhu
