In a bed of blood the traces of love
A part of you, a part of me, the essence of life

My life disgraced, infernal ways
Have lid your way, to see me

Total dismay, paints your visage
As you obey, and feel me

So full of sin
So full of sin

My glorious precious seed, is spread out by the wind
To nourish all my deeds and feed my utter sins
I am the chosen one, I am the sovereign
What I accomplish, is what lasts...
