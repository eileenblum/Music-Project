Inherited blood
I'm leavened by this germ
Decepted light
Transmitted and confirmed

A hereditary disease, the plague is in my blood
Eternal precipice, my agony floods
The ending has no light, my blood must be drained
Sacrificial deathrite, to seal my pain

Don't know if it's mortal, just a despairingly wait
This epedemic, sent to a victim of hate

An effort to be spared from the obsess
I'm pestered by tjis obnoxious germ
Maimed by slaying apprehension
Incurables have come for me to stay, to stay...

The ending has no light, my blood must be drained
A sacrificial deathrite, autopsy remains
