Come with me, I'll show the palace
Where darkness rules and time stands still
I'll show you everything there is to see
Just follow me, let your mind unfold

A left hand path, through the woods
Now prepare for a mental flood
Intensive evil possesses your mind
Attracted to death, to spill the blood

Hail the sons of darkness' whores
Sacrificed to the haunted domains

Woods of pagan, obscure rites
Hides the power, the twisted lights
Through all times kept clandestine
The root of evil so divine

Now you've seen the sacred place
The offerings for our race
Now I'll tear your eyes out blind
You will never more this path find

Hail the sons of darkness' whores
Sacrificed to the haunted domains

Bow to your fate
Dark force of hate
