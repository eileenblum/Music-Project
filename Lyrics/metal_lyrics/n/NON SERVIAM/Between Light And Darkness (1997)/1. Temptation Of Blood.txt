The dark force inside my heart
Awaits the day when screams are heard
The vampire is once again reborn
When the moon, strikes full

Screams from the cold winter night
Screams from the vampire's bite
Immortalized souls have gathered once again
The christian woman is now dead

The dark age has now arrived
I feel the temptation of blood
My heart is full of hate
When my teeth reach her throat
