Seducted by the stars and the moon
To meet my fatefull and burning doom
To enlight your evil ghastly grin
Like a filthy eternal sin

Infernal spirit walk with me
Like a falling bird of purify
I look at my fate and face the eternal goddess
As the mist falls into the vains of the earth
My death becomes my real birth

As the sky turns red and the sea is boiling
I would be the greatest
I would rise above them all

Hallowed be my name
And the kingdom will be mine
And the glory...
