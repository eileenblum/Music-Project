I close my eyes to summon my thoughts
So I can see when they come forth
My mind is overtaken
My pure soul is now forsaken

As my soul,my body is changing
Fearsome figures are rising
Majestic desires raging, whispering eyes are beholding
Vampires surround me, they are enchanting me
We join them in their journey
We seek for human blood

I try to erase my carnal desire
But it's so strong, the lust of the vampire

Like the lure of the sea
We tempted them with pleasure
But now I will face the sadistic
To please its will
And satisfy my desire...

My mind is reborn
I leave the demons decay
Leading the victims astray
I will forevermore dwell

My vampiric lust is appealed
I follow my instinct to the nest
The sun is rising from its sleep
Now it's time for me to rest
My new life has begun
Never under the sun
Avoid the life, live at night
