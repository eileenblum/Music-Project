A look in the mirror, whose is this face
So much pain to deliver, without mercy or grace

On hate and fear I feed, and the sins that you bleed
Open your veins and let go of all pain
Forget the light, you belong to the night

The face in the mirror, I can't live with that face
The face un the mirror...
