Two millenniums of constantly fighting
Waht is good and what is evil, bewildering
God is claimed to be good, why is he killing
Why can't they just give up their lying

Jesus, Satan
Good and Evil
The epic battle Between Light And Darkness

As you embrace yourself and your divinity of the light
My vomits will fill your throat as you forcefeed
me with your holy scam
All I want is to terminate your rotten weak and fooled mind
You think you're so good but you're killing and lying
