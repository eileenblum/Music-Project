Pure betrayal, darkening desires
Seducted by chaos to pain and perdition
Affected by the lusts of flesh

Alone with thoughts, shadows on the walls
A dark moon is rising, portending death and destruction

What brings thou to my simple hut
Perchant a kiss for my beloved...

one

Distressed for a moment, an anguished cry
Yet his eyes percieves no beauty in light
Blinded by his dark desires
