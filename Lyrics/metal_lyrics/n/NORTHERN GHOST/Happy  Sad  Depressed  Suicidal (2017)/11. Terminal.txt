I'm terminal

I feel them crawling underneath my skin
Knowing exactly how I tick tick tick
Why can't I fake a superficial sin
I want them genuinely sick sick sick sick sick
Add your name to the list

(When the morning breaks)

When the morning breaks my hands will start to shake
The waking light exposing me of all of my mistakes
But it's just leaving me blind and I can't see in the dark
A little taste of heaven has left me scarred and marked
I've been marked

Isn't God with me?
Or is the devil playing games again
You know how much he loves the irony
Codependent kid I can't go on with only one of them I need them both to keep my sanity

Run
We'll run forever
We're not turning back
Cuz they can only follow us if we don't stop
So let's stay on track
My legs are giving out
(Run)
A whisper to a shout
(Run)
How can I stay away if my body won't even let me

When the morning breaks my hands will start to shake
The waking light exposing me of all of my mistakes
But it's just leaving me blind and I can't see in the dark
A little taste of heaven has left me scarred and marked
I've been marked

I'm terminal

Bite
Bite
How does it taste to figure out the truth?
White
White
Just like your eyes when I get through with you

I've lost everything
So I've got nothing to lose
I've lost everything
So I've got nothing to lose
I've got nothing
I've got nothing

When the morning breaks my hands will start to shake
The waking light exposing me of all of my mistakes
But it's just leaving me blind and I can't see in the dark
A little taste of heaven has left me scarred and marked
I've been marked

When the morning breaks my hands will start to shake
The waking light exposing me of all of my mistakes
But it's just leaving me blind and I can't see in the dark
A little taste of heaven has left me scarred and marked
I've been marked

I'm terminal
