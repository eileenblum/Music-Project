Tragedy
Consuming me
Fake your love
Infinitely

I need more inspiration
So I'll continue thanking
The donors
The donors
I'm here for my donors

My third eye
Is going blind
Paralyzed
My vacant mind

If every life in this world comes with a death sentence
Is that the reason I can still feel my mother present
I'll never leave here again
Because I'm nothing without them

The donors
The donors
I'm here for my donors

We are we are the donors
We are we are the donors
We are we are the donors
We are we are

The reason I breathe
Is now the reason I can't fall asleep
I thought I left it behind, only to find
They bled me dry like last time

I'm not afraid of the dark
But I'm afraid of you
I'm not afraid of the pain
I'm scared of what I'll do
I brought this on myself
I craved the worst I'm going through
The voices said I need it that's why
I'm addicted to

The donors
The donors
I'm here for my donors

We are we are the donors
We are we are the donors
We are we are the donors
We are we are
