Phantoms follow me because my poor self couldn't handle it
I guess it's ok
God only knows I could use the company
Demons tuck you in because your poor self couldn't handle it
I guess it's ok
You never knew til the voice was deafening

Scream out your lungs dirty your hands
It's time for the wolves to give up their demands
Let em all know
Let em all know
Let em all know
That we're here to revolt

We are so lost in the white noise
Even my soul tried to get away
But now I'm caught in this hole
I can't see how it was supposed to be
No I can't tell if anyone is finally listening

Claw at the wall
Bite your nails to the bone
Lock yourself in your lust
Dig in your neck
With the blade of your rapture
Cuz that's all you're gonna get

We are so lost in the white noise
Even my soul tried to get away
But now I'm caught in this hole
I can't see how it was supposed to be
No I can't tell if anyone is finally listening

I know I'm sick but you're much sicker
I know I'm sick but you're much sicker
I know I'm sick but you're much sicker
I know I'm sick but you're much more sick in the head

Dead

Demons tuck you in
Demons tuck you in

We are so lost in the white noise
Even my soul tried to get away
But now I'm caught in this hole
I can't see how it was supposed to be
No I can't tell if anyone is finally listening

Is anyone listening
Is anyone listening
Is anyone listening
