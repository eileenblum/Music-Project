I'm covered in scars deeper than an ocean
We bury the truth as a notion
But all these faceless bodies tell me what I need to know
I walk the halls of regret
With no end in sight it's not over yet
We all change when the sun goes down

It's funny we see things so different in the dark
It's funny how life works when everything falls apart

Yeah yeah

So this is what it's like to die
To be on the other side
I'm afraid that I won't catch you
Is it God is it me
Who's controlling everything
Does it matter when I'm begging for a death wish
Death wish
Death wish

Pull me under 'cause I'm not the same
And I'm not the way they want me to be
Is this the only thing you seem to notice
Give me my mind give me back my mistakes

So this is what it's like to die
To be on the other side
I'm afraid that I won't catch you
Is it God is it me
Who's controlling everything
Does it matter when I'm begging for a death wish
Death wish
Death wish

I think I need a priest to exercise what's in my head
He took a look at me and told me I'm already dead

So this is what it's like to die
To be on the other side
I'm afraid I won't catch you
Is it God is it me
Who's controlling everything
Does it matter when I'm begging for a death wish
Death wish
Death wish

Oh!

So this is what it's like to die
To be on the other side
I'm afraid I won't catch you
Is it God is it me
Who's controlling everything
Does it matter when I'm begging for a death wish
Death wish
Death wish
Death wish

Searching and searching for a death wish
But something inside is telling me I can't quit
Drag my body
Drag my body
Bring me back to life

He told me he told me he took a look at me and told me
