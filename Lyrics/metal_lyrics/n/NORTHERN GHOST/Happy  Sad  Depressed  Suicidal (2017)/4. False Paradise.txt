Cut me off cut me out
I'm everything that you feared you wanted
Cut me off cut me out
These ropes around my neck

I am not even here anymore
My mind has been replaced
Left wide open and vulnerable
I want it all erased
Oh!
It's best to leave it alone
Let it heal let it learn let it grow
(Oh no)
But I'm the passionate type
I never quit but never can live to the hype

Take my hand and fall down with me
I swear I'll never let it go

We're slipping under
We're tranquilized in false paradise
Trade your blood for lies
It's now or never
No thinking twice
What we believe in won't believe in us

Secrets living inside of my throat (inside of my throat)
I constantly decay
Words left silent are choking me up (choking me up)
Can't end the suffering
Oh!
I couldn't leave it alone
On my tongue in the dark on its own
(Oh no)
Aren't we the fortunate ones
With what we know and nothing but this loaded gun

Take my hand and fall down with me
I swear I'll never let it go

We're slipping under
We're tranquilized in false paradise
Trade your blood for lies
It's now or never
No thinking twice
What we believe in won't believe in us

Author of my life read me the title
Happy sad depressed suicidal
Author of my life tell me the truth
Am I emotionless or was it my corrupted youth

False paradise
We paid the price

We're slipping under
We're tranquilized in false paradise
Trade your blood for lies
It's now or never
No thinking twice
What we believe in won't believe in us

We're slipping under
We're tranquilized in false paradise
Trade your blood for lies
It's now or never
No thinking twice
What we believe in won't believe in us
