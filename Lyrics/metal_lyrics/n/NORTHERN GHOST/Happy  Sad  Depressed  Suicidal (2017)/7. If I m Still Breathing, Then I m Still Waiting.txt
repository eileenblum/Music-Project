I can see my outer body float above my head
When I'm deprived is when I try and sink instead
I've been terrified of what's behind those hazy eyes
So rip them out and end it
Backed in a corner like a fox I shape shift my way away
Lunacy derived from the spirit that's now possessing me
Slave to the illusion

Black White
Day Night
Dark Light
Peace Fight

How did it ever come to this
Holding the knife in my hands
Being fearless left me lifeless
But now I'm finding out I fell in doubt
All these visions seem to never let me go
So maybe if I'm still breathing
Then I'm still waiting
For someone like you to kill me soon

Focus
I'm living inside a box of glass
I watch it crack
I watch it shatter
As if any of this would matter
Every clock is broken
Everything is still and I slowly fade away

How did it ever come to this
Holding the knife in my hands
Being fearless left me lifeless
But now I'm finding out I fell in doubt
All these visions seem to never let me go
So maybe if I'm still breathing
Then I'm still waiting
For someone like you to kill me soon

Watch me clean up the guts I spilled
And I hope that you enjoy the show

How did it ever come to this
Holding the knife in my hands
Being fearless left me lifeless
But now I'm finding out I fell in doubt
All these visions seem to never let me go
So maybe if I'm still breathing
Then I'm still waiting
For someone like you to kill me

I'm begging you just to kill me now

If I'm still breathing then I'm still waiting
If I'm still breathing then I'm still waiting

We're overthrown
The innocent spinning
The world isn't spinning
I'm all alone
Caught in your gravity
And its been hell for me
