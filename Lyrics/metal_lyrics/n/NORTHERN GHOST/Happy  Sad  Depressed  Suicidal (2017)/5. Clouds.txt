Recourse recourse recourse
And if I failed to mention the words I've been saying are
Keeping you half alive
Well I'm sorry but I can't escape from the way that I think
You see me giving out a blank stare
Sinking into the dark but I don't care
Never feeling right
Cursing that my soul and I
Never wanted the same

Come down
What's it like with your head in the clouds
Come down
It'll tear me apart til we're deep underground
Held back everything and you're suddenly
Right back to the place you don't wanna be
Come down
What's it like with your head in the clouds

Relapse relapse relapse
Well I'm sorry that I didn't turn out the way I should
Show me you're still alive
I can feel a heart beating where I know I'm dead inside

Come down
What's it like with your head in the clouds
Come down
It'll tear me apart til we're deep underground
Held back everything and you're suddenly
Right back to the place you don't wanna be
Come down
What's it like with your head in the clouds

They were the ones who said that I need this
They were the ones who told me I had nothing left
But how are we to know the way that this should end
If all that we hear is what we comprehend

Its never over

So come down
So come down
Yeah

Come down
What's it like with your head in the clouds
Come down
It'll tear me apart til we're deep underground
Held back everything and you're suddenly
Right back to the place you don't wanna be
Come down
What's it like with your head in the clouds
