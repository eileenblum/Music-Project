We were watched
Being tested in paranoia
You say you want to die
Well so do I

I'm deaf to every word
Every truth they try to force in me
When will you realize
That we're all hypnotized
Everyone is a fake
No matter what they say
We over analyze
We can't be recognized here

We were watched
Being tested in a paranoia

Take my heart
When I fall apart
Take my heart when there's nowhere to turn to
A heart of stone that'll never desert you

I hope you're watching me close

I'm innocent
Innocent
But you caught me in a tidal wave (wave)
Drowning in
All the sin
But I found a way to get away (away)
So get away

Now it's my turn to make a move
Now it's my turn to show you
Who's in control
I'll never change
You'll never learn
Yeah!
I'll never change
You'll never learn
And we'll both be trapped here

Take my heart
When I fall apart
Take my heart when there's nowhere to turn to
A heart of stone that'll never desert you
Come with me
Forget everything
Come with me and I'll start over with you
Even if I would drag you to hell too

See the thing about a heart of stone
Is that it always breaks a heart of glass
And when the fear of pain is on its own
Maybe then the dark times will pass

Take my heart
When I fall apart
Take my heart when there's nowhere to turn to
A heart of stone that'll never desert you
Come with me
Forget everything
Come with me and I'll start over with you
Even if I would drag you to hell
