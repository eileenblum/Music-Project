Desolation turned into machines
But they're too busy watching us from satellites to streets
Ignore the warning signs look the other way
There's nothing left to say

A nation full of narcissists a colony of killers
(War)
Society of psychopaths holding up the pillars
(War)

They control the surface of our screens
Spinning in a carousel of dying hopes and dreams
They tell us what to think they tell us what to feel
They tell us what to kill

And we all obey
We're all lead astray

I felt the world halt
Its purging us reverting back to the start

We're having an emergency

Low
A new low
A new low for all the parasites that turn us into drones
They hide in the shadows

Oh!

I see all of the pieces becoming clear
I see a bigger picture revealing our toxic atmosphere

I felt the world halt
Its purging us reverting back to the start
I couldn't make out what the symbols meant
But I believe this time we've gone too far

If only we had more time
There's no one left to blame
If only we had more time
There's no one left to blame
If only we had more time
There's no one left to blame
If only we had more time
There's no one left to blame

Sacrifice

When you look up at your life
Are you really worth saving
When you look up at your life
Are you really worth saving

I felt the world halt
Its purging us reverting back to the start
I couldn't make out what the symbols meant
But I believe this time we've gone too far

If only we had more time
There's no one left to blame
