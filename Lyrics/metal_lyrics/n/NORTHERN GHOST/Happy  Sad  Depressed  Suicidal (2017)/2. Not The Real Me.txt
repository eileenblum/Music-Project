You're blurring out your reasons
Blur it out
Blur it out
You threw me to the flames
Burn it down
Burn it down
There's no way I'm escaping
Get me out
Get me out
Stuck in fate

Can you sense it
An open exit
But a door not big enough for all of the desperate
We're trying to change
The rules of the game
From the same thing to the same thing

If we don't end this then it'll end us
So if we want them to take us serious
We have to open up our eyes
We have to make them realize that we're gonna rise

Hold on this is getting worse
(This is getting worse)
While I hang by a thread and they're one step ahead
Pretending they're breaking this curse
Resistance is no use a coma self induced
Accepting what I'm meant to be but that's not the real me
It's not the real me

Did you find it
Another counterfeit
Spinning in the cycle of being a hypocrite
We're better than this
The game that we quit
It's the same thing the same thing

Hold on this is getting worse
(This is getting worse)
While I hang by a thread and they're one step ahead
Pretending they're breaking this curse
Resistance is no use a coma self induced
Accepting what I'm meant to be but that's not the real me

I'm stuck in fate
Fate
I'm stuck in fate

You're blurring out your reasons
Blur it out
Blur it out
You threw me to the flames
Burn it down
Burn it down
There's no way I'm escaping
Get me out
Get me out
Stuck in fate

Go!

Stuck in fate

Hold on this is getting worse
(This is getting worse)
While I hang by a thread and they're one step ahead
Pretending they're breaking this curse
Resistance is no use a coma self induced
Accepting what I'm meant to be but that's not the real me

Fate
I'm stuck in fate
