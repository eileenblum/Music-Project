Pain is becoming too familiar
Rain from a little black cloud follows me
I forgot what's its like to be in the light
And the storm overhead always pours in the day and the night
But that's alright
That's alright

I pulled the trigger at the edge of the world
There's nothing left for us here
Or would you rather see me disappear
So if I end up in a lifeless nowhere
I'll crawl back to my hole
And now there's nowhere else for me to go
I'm on my own

Love is becoming unfamiliar
Death is the only thing that's haunting me
But no ghost can posses me
If I'm not alive I'm not alive
Always left second guessing the will I have left in the fight
But not this time
Not this time

I pulled the trigger at the edge of the world
There's nothing left for us here
Or would you rather see me disappear
So if I end up in a lifeless nowhere
I'll crawl back to my hole
And now there's nowhere else to go
I'm on my own

You don't know what I'm capable of
I'm not dead yet I just should be
And I don't think you should stay long enough to find out
To find out
To find out
To find out
To find out

I pulled the trigger at the edge of the world
There's nothing left for us here
Or would you rather see me disappear
So if I end up in a lifeless nowhere
I'll crawl back to my hole
And now there's nowhere else for me to go
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
I'm on my own

Yeah
