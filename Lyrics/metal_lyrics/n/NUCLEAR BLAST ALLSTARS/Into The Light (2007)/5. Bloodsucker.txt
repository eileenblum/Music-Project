When this world dies the land is total mess drowning in chaos
A million cries will be unheard victims of terror
Deadly wings of horror break the will of resistance
Hostages are whining the cruel invaders will be contented

Bloodsuckers armies of the brain-dead bloodsuckers
The evil takes the crown bloodsuckers armies of the brain-dead
BLOODSUCKERS!

This war can't be won the leaders will sacrifice the last drop of blood
Law of the gun hunters of dead traders of weapons
Unholy greed for power will lead to our downfall this world will fall
Unholy greed for power the world will fall then it will be to late this world will fall
