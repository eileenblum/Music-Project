There is a nation in the western world they've got the power to control.
All the resources to take what they need and they are willing to take all.
Time will show where they'll go ruling the world by the sword.
Can't they tell, they've made hell ruling the world by the sword.

Step on the land with an arrogant smile force everybody to their knees.
Breeding the envy in everyone's head give birth to hate, like a disease.
Time will show where they'll go ruling the world by the sword.
Can't they tell, they've made hell ruling the world by the sword.

Ruling the world by the power of god they are ruling the world by the sword.
