So many things come in my life that steal my energy so many questions where I find no answers
But thereâs a place where I can go thatâs deep inside my mind a great relief and time to go!
Time to go inner sanctuary inner sanctuary, now I have found my peace somehow

You donât know what youâve done to me tell me the reasons why what have I done that I deserve such treatment?
Why do you fill my heart with grief my tears will never dry your monster creeps in me when I am sleeping
Time to go inner sanctuary inner sanctuary, now I have found my peace somehow
