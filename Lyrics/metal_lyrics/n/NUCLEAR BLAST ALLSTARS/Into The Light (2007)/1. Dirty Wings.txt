Is this the view from fallen angel's eyes it's time to dry the tears
Like something new far better than the lies of honour pride and fears
I will return more stronger than before this is my chance to grow beyond the past
I know I burn I burn for you much more I pay the price I know now it will last
Sacrifice of that I had inside shed it all, my senseless fate of pride

Through the fires of the night from the ashes out of sight wide away
So I will ride on dirty wings through the darkness of the night
From the ashes to the light wide away now I will ride on dirty wings

I never knew this choice was in my mind
It never felt so right what cannot do a man is sometimes blind
Give me a chance and be with me tonight
