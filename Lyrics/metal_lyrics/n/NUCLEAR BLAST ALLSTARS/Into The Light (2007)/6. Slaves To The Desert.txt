Skin burned to leather, endless the pain struggling against the heat
Are people to die for a building campaign treated like lifeless meat?
Bridled to follow the orders of Thebes driving the lot insane
Short-lived, encircled, degraded, the eagles a caravan of pain
And their sorrow will last till tomorrow and they long for the poisonous arrow

A thousand times Iâve stung the day dragged along the Nile
Men too cheer, a sinister priest Iâm stuck into a pile
Perfect programs high proficiency
You celebrate and clap but you forgot those men who left their marks on me
And their sorrow will last till tomorrow and they long for the poisonous arrow

A song from the desert revealing its secret to me easily, I hear them creep
The kings of the desert concealing their glamour from me because they feel what I need
A song from the desert revealing its secret to me easily, I hear them creep
The kings of the desert concealing their glamour from me because they feel what I need
The slaves of the desert concealing their glamour from me because they feel what I need
