Wake with a smile on your lips let dreams alive
Rub your bedroom eyes this will be a perfect day
Jump out of withered written in time
Only vast intentions their words are right
It will be coming your way no escape
Itâs just a second away itâs too late
Itâs just another life goodbye, itâs just another perfect day
But just from now to a perfect day to die

Feast on the other faces they smile at you
Was there something more like a grin, how can you tell?
Feel thereâs a shadow rising clouds hide the sun
Some thingâs here, you shiver from deep inside
It will be coming your way no escape
Itâs just a second away itâs too late
Itâs just another life goodbye, itâs just another perfect day
But just from now to a perfect day to die
