Waited so long, I felt so strange I couldnât move in hours
A pulse of light that disorients I tremble with might in me
The fever is killing me creeping and mourning
Spreading all night and day insatiable yearning
Youâll never see me running away I will stay to be in the picture
Canât believe my eyes images blur, Iâm coming alive
From where did you come whatâs your mission?

Though they lurk, still out of range I bow down before the strange
And finally they showed their faces I recognized myself
Fear in the neighbourhood of hope and commitment
Dreams out of meagre signs that lightened a weakness
Youâll never see me running away I will stay to be in the picture
Canât believe my eyes images blur, Iâm coming alive
From where did you come whatâs your mission?

Youâll never see me running away I have to face the oncoming pain I will stay to be in the picture
Youâll never see me running away I will stay to be in the picture
Canât believe my eyes images blur, Iâm coming alive
From where did you come whatâs your mission?
Canât believe my eyes images blur, Iâm coming alive from where did you come?
Canât believe my eyes I was fated to be in the picture canât believe my eyes
