All the saints will come, guide the soul when you die angels cry, you won't be alone
All of my friends are dead, I am still alive all of my friends are dead.
Couldn't I go instead let me die couldn't I go instead.
I lives eternal ages, I've seen the empires fall. I've played stages and after all
Death is alive, death is alive death is alive in me.
Anytime, anywhere, come to me at anytime, I'll be there, can't you see that anytime I'll be there.
Come to me at anytime

Rest in peace my friend, in your grave when you're dead
Leave the pain behind, turn the page.
All of my love is dead, a hollow man all of my love is dead.
Where are the tears I've shed, my heart is dry where are the tears I've shed.
And all the years I've wasted; and all the endless nights
Won't heal the pain I've tasted because after all
Death is alive, death is alive death is alive in me.
Anytime, anywhere, come to me at anytime,
I'll be there, can't you see that anytime I'll be there come to me at anytime...

Keep the fire burning, don't give up your soul.
Soon the times are turning, you will hear the call.
I never wished to be immortal, nor do I know why
I was chosen. How can I fill my days, waiting for the last judgement
