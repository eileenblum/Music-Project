I've heard what happened in the news you fool, this really was the worst to choose
Now it's too late to find a better way solutions are around but you won't see
You've thrown your life away
This time you know it is eternally too late you cannot change what is eternally too late

Cool down, you better let your heart decide calm down, no reason to make wrong to right
Too bad, what have you done, it's such a shame think twice before you act, it's all your blame
You've thrown your life away
This time you know it is eternally too late you cannot change what is eternally too late

Suffer eternally you've thrown your life away
This time you know it is eternally too late you cannot change what is eternally too late
