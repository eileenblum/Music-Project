I am stepping out, let me warm you no longer keep it inside.
So full of rage and frustration, it's going to come to the light.
I'll spread my wings, don't stop me I am breaking out

Too long I had to endure it it made me sick, wore me out.
I nearly lost all my fire, forgot what it's all about.
I might be scared, whatever I'll spread my wings I am breaking out

Terrified, tantalised, stuck in this mental horror,
I no longer find what's in my mind.
Terrified, hypnotised from what I fear so much, now
I root out what keeps me terrified.
I'll spread my wings, I am breaking out.
