All primal instincts awaken a territory unknown
My eyes cannot relate to the sane this body acts under oath
And then, worlds are caving in divine paranoia from within
I overshadow all reason with the magic I hold
I inject all the faith that I need to lose all control
And then, worlds are caving in divine paranoia from within
Visceral stimulus responses emotions lead you
Under oath to forget deeds I have done and never will you learn never ever
And then, worlds are caving in divine paranoia from within

I never admit my calling now heard from deep inside
Even though ill never be unscarred again choice is lost to the need inside
Visceral stimulus responses emotions lead you
Under oath to forget deeds I have done and never will you learn never ever
And then, worlds are caving in divine paranoia from within
