Welcome to the boiling point you've got a lot to fucking learn.
Experience by dysfunctional hours I've seized my apparent.
In progress of getting nowhere I catch a glimpse of prosperity.
And I've got this feeling that eats me up inside I was told to believe in but all I do is hide
So I lose the fight like so many times before this feeling eats me up inside

In the valley of the compressed there's no room for errors
Fighting me, the negative, the less I see room for the nothingness
Need, something to, build on but I find nothing at all.
And I've got this feeling that eats me up inside I was told to believe in but all I do is hide
So I lose the fight like so many times before this feeling eats me up inside

Whatever is hiding in the dark come forward, show yourself,
I need, to make up the consequence you've got, what I need.
And I've got this feeling that eats me up inside I was told to believe in but all I do is hide
So I lose the fight like so many times before this feeling eats me up inside
