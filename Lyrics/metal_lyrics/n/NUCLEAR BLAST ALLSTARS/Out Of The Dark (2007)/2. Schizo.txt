Ploughing through the shit every day I cannot get a break
Nothing seems to go my way it's not my day, it's never been my day
Rots is glowing up my veins I feel old, I feel drained

I am on this quest to find out where I am from and where do I belong
Life is not what it seems to be from all the sacrifices, I live my life like a dog
What a joke desperation is bringing me down on my knees
I am running into darkness, I am fighting myself

Schizophrenic battle in my own mind I don't know if I should laugh or if I should cry
Why am I here, where do I belong is this the end of my life what the fuck is going on?
I am running into darkness, I am fighting myself through sorrow and through madness I try to stay sane
Time is running it's over I am falling it's over
I am running into darkness, I am fighting myself through sorrow and through madness I try to stay sane
