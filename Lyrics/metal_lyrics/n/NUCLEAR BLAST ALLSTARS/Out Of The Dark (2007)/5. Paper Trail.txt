It seems the pen is so much mightier than the sword that slices for answers
You distract me with a smooth sleight of hand this lab rat is running out of gas
A policy of don't tell and never ask this unholy alliance couldn't be more bland
It's my collective amnesia it only helps me to forget so much reinforcing I don't need you think that be enough

In the centre with all rifles drawn smiling at the targets my eyes are on
The same old shit couldn't be more stale and I got proof with a paper trail
Standing in the centre with rifles drawn smiling at the targets my eyes are on
Empty out every shattered shell because I got the goods with this paper trail

The boats sail in different directions stark naked without protection keep tight with all my Freudian slips
It's my collective amnesia it only helps me to forget so much reinforcing I don't need you think that be enough
It's my collective amnesia it only helps me to forget so much reinforcing I don't need you isn't that enough
