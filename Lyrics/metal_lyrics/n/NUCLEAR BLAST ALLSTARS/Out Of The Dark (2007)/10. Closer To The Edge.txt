A lonely curse, a lonely violence this lonely curse is waiting inside me
Some empty spaces these empty spaces which made me sick they're coming back to me
Why I am getting close to the edge but well I know why
Why I am getting close to the edge well I know why

Breathing on the surface and dying on the inside and I am displaying this new dirtiness of my soul
Some empty spaces these empty spaces which made me sick they're coming back to me
Why I am getting close to the edge but well I know why
Why I am getting close to the edge well I know why

Why I am breathing on the surface dying on the inside displaying this new dirtiness of my soul
These empty spaces which made me sick are coming back to me
Why does it have to be like this why does it have I am left alone!
Why I am getting close to the edge but well I know why
Why I am getting close to the edge well I know why
