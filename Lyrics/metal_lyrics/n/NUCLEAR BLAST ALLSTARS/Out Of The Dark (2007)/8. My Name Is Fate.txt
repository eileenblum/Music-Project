Fate highs you want and times you don't you think you more, or less get to choose.
Strip you down drag you around leave a proud man feeling used.
Test you all break you all get you all in due time
Make you crawl make you fall question your design

Fate things you need to feed your greed just don't matter when I am done
Scream your prayers into the air to a god that never comes
Test you all break you all get you all in due time
Make you crawl make you fall question your design
Say my name fate you won't escape fate say my name fate my name is fate

Live your life like human mice another bright eyed foolish sheep
In the end you're mine my friend no matter what you choose to see
Test you all break you all get you all in due time
Make you crawl make you fall question your design
Say my name fate you won't escape fate say my name fate my name is fate

Time will waste away babies start to crawl
I have no guilt, or prejudice I will take you one and all
Rivers dry, and crack oceans fill with oil
Some of you will lose your limbs like ripping trees from soil
Kings, and queens, and rabbis ministers, and priests holy men, and lords of war have suffered my disease
Butterflies, and birds savage jungle beasts harmless old ladies who never woke from sleep
Fate say my name fate you won't escape fate say my name fate my name is fate
