Forged strength for understanding, tolerated this long by will
Now that trust has broken down, there's no use to pretend
No one can close the wound this time my friend because this is the beginning of the end
Deceits and lies, won't lead you far, you're trying so hard to act like a superstar
Stood you more than no one can take, fallen for the same mistake
Manifestation of fake were others made to break ain't your sanity wearing thin, now that everything is caving in
Dark days leads to darker nights and the world crumbles around you is that what you desire?
Ain't there something that you'd die for something that you'd really care for is this what you stand for?

Sacrifice the devotion to hate lies the only way to be free in your fucked up reality
Betrayal you stab in the back for others destruction pain no recognition for chaos
Is this what you stand for ain't there something that you'd die for?
Sacrifice, the devotion to hate and I have given everything
Dilation of chaos is eternal and this state of hate shall prevail
Keep grinding and grinding rip everything apart, destroy the world around you
Withering from within, until there is nothing left until there is nothing left this is your beginning of the end!
