There is no time to waste it's time to face the truth
This pain you can't deny it's been there to defy
I am the one you hate this fate you can't escape
Will you beg for mercy or will you beg
Forgiveness cold is my vengeance

This time there is no past your lies are great and vast there will be blood
Your mask in life is sold your existence is mine to be devoured
Forgiveness cold is my vengeance

Sweet is resurrection among a faithful combination
Between betrayal and fear the souls imminent destruction
By the name of your god swift is my vengeance
By the name of your god cold is my vengeance
