If you could only see would have been such a sweet relief
Because you could carry carry it all
How about break it all apart tear it up and make you want to start
You could redeem yourself unless you want it all
Could you still rescue me can't understand straight from the heart
I only desert you I have only deserved you I can't, the signals you send
I am still tossing to wonder on I just feel like the only one that deserves you the one that deserts you

Would you still rescue me if I told you quite desperately you've been so wrong wrong of all time
How about break it all apart tear it up and make you want to start
You could redeem yourself unless you want it all
Could you still rescue me can't understand straight from the heart
I only desert you I have only deserved you I can't, the signals you send
I am still tossing to wonder on I just feel like the only one that deserves you the one that deserts you

As long as we realize throughout those lonely nights
Truth might be modified truth might be modified the signals you send
As long as we realize throughout those lonely nights
Truth might be modified truth might be modified the signals you send
How about break it all apart tear it up and make you want to start
You could redeem yourself unless you want it all
Could you still rescue me can't understand straight from the heart
I only desert you I have only deserved you I can't, the signals you send
I am still tossing to wonder on I just feel like the only one that deserves you the one that deserts you
