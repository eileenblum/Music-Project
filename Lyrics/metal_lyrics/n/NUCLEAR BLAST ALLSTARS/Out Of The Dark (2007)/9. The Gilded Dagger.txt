Slowly, fading, to the grey zone pray not to wake the mind ghosts
They root far too deep I'll be forced to play the kill-card and unmake them
If, you don't want the answer don't, ask the question then I'll be your shadow dancer a dead heart's lesson
If, you don't want the answer don't, ask the question
Then I'll be your shadow dancer a dead heart's lesson
The mind may be the only freedom let me now decrypt my dreams
They seem significant where God failed I will succeed find a way out of the maze
I can see it hanging there the dagger on my wall
I know exactly what it means reminds me of my fall

Used to set my, friends on fire learned how to choke the flame
Burning deep in my soul found the golden key to master its mechanism you threw it all away
I can see it hanging there the dagger on my wall
I know exactly what it means reminds me of my fall

The coin is still turning the coin is still turning
The coin is still turning back stabbed or liberated
The coin is still turning to back stab or liberate
