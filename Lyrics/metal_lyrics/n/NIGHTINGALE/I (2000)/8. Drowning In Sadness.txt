[Nouga - Swano]

Darkness all around me, I believe
That we will be together once again
The time has come to leave this dreadful place
I think I've found a way out of this maze

Tonight the moon will shine upon my grave
God has failed. Here's one he cannot save

My life is over, I just can't go on
Nowhere to run, I'm turning black inside
I hope to meet him in the other sky
I've realized I'm only born to die

I close my eyes and ask myself again
Is there really nothing left to do?
The silence in my heart just prove me right
Soon my journey will begin towards eternal night

I'm breathing water, death is closing in
It's cold and dark but I am not afraid
I'm out of breath. There's no way out of here
This is the end of all the pain and fear
