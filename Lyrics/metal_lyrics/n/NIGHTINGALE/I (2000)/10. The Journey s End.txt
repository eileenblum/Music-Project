[Swano/Nouga - Swano]

My heart never wanted to leave
The silence was gold for my soul
But I am heading back home, I return
To the world that I decide to leave

My life is a waste of time
I wish I could end it
But something won't let me go

I'm back, everything looks the same
All these people but I still alone
I'm soon to arrive at the place where my fear was born
Torn, torn apart
The scars are still bleeding inside
I'll never forgive you
One part of me always cry
And it's crying 'cause of you

So long ago
I gave you my heart, it was...
So long ago
I gave you my soul, it was...
So long ago
But you gave me hell in return

You made what I am here today
All the sadness you brought to my soul
Is something I'll never find ways to defy
If you could see me what you've done to me now
Maybe you would understand 
The love you never gave me
Would have made me much stronger inside
But it is too late to change

So long ago
I gave you my heart
So long ago
And I gave you my soul
So long ago
And I gave you, I gave you my heart
So long ago
But you gave me hell in return

I'm back where the darkness began
All is empty, not a soul around
Where are you now?
Where did all of you go?
Nothing is left
Nothing is left from before
It seems like a lifetime has passed here
While I was gone
