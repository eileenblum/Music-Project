[Swano - Swano/Elkhart]

I'm feeling so empty inside
When the fragments of pain return from the back of my mind
Of all of the lies I've been told "We love you" must be the worst

I couldn't find any reason to stay
My life is too precious to sacrifice
The darkest of shadows follow my soul
Tonight I will join all lost ones on the run

I have to run away

I'm all alone in this world
When the memories arise and punch a new hole in my soul
I'm hiding my head in my hands for the fragments to disappear

I wait for the nightfall, eager to leave
I whisper goodbye to the house of fear
Watching my sister cry in her sleep
One day she will understand

I know I'm scarred for life
all messed up with no place to go
I'm out here all alone
Lonelier than the streets I wander
I'll always have these scars inside

I'm scarred for life

I'm lost in the cold of the night
Looking for shelter until the dawn turns to day
I'm holding my hands to my head
For the silence to reappear

The fragments and places remembered with fear
Never to leave, just fade away
I'll carry them with me forever and a day
Just like a nail in my heart
