[Nouga - Swano]

I lie here by the lakeside
I am still alive somehow
It's all too strange for me to understand

How could someone see me
In the darkness of the night?
How could someone bring me back to life?

Is there another world?
Dead or alive?
Oh, life is haunting me

I can't describe the feeling
Could it all just be a dream?
I'm still wet and the memories remain

I rise and try to make my way back to the normal world
I'v realized that life has to go on

It's so hard to decide
Dead or alive
Now fear will carry me, back to the world

Another day is dawning
Now my journey will begin
Destined to return to normal life

It feels like I've been out here
For eternity and more
I've lost all sense of time
But I'll be strong

It's so hard to decide
Dead or alive
Oh, my past is haunting me
