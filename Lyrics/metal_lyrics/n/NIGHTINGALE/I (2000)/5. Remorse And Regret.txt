[Swano - Swano/Elkhart]

My heart is in pain
Surrounded by emptiness
How could I do this to my only friend?

The memories of joy vanished without a trace
Wandering aimlessly
Empty inside

I know I'll never be, be myself again
Death and despair is forever to dwell in my soul
It's never to leave me, no

I feel so alone
Guilt is written all over me
I'm losing myself in this maze of remorse

Please wake me up from the nightmare that's haunting me
I only see darkness wherever I turn

I know he'll never be, be alive again
Death and despair is forever to rhyme with my name
I can't stand the pain any longer

Lonely
Losing time and space
I am reborn in remorse and regret
Oh, no sight of light inside
The darkness is all around

I'm calling your name
I wish you could see me now
But only my echo is with me tonight

You know I would trade my life for your return
But you'll never hear this promise I make

I know I'll never be, be myself again
And the tears that I cry is the lifeblood I stole from your eyes
I can't stand the pain any longer

Lonely
Losing time and space
My soul is reborn in remorse and regret
Oh, no sight of light inside
The darkness is all around

My world is insane
I surrender to silence
But will I be able to bury the truth?
