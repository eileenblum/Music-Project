[Nouga - Swano/Elkhart]

The rain is cold as ice today
The day I never wanted to come
We have come to the final round
We have reached the point of no return

I can see that you're afraid, but there is no way out
You are the one to show the way

This is the final dare
I know this could be your last day
I place the rope around your neck
I can see the anguish in your eyes

No! My breath is swept away by the sight I see
I cannot move, I cannot scream Oh, No!

He chokes for breath in vain
I fail to cut the rope in time
The game is over now
His broken soul is lost for evermore

I feel his soul far away
A part of me has died
I wonder who's to show the way
He left this world behind
I feel his soul far away
A part of me has died
I wonder who's to show the way
