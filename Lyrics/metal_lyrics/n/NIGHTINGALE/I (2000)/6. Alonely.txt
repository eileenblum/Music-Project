[Nouga - Swano/Schect]

I'm all alone
Waiting for no one
I see the daylight fade away

I'm so afraid
I know you're around me
I hear you crying in the wind

If I could bring you back
If I had the power, I'd give you my world
And my life, you'd have it all
But life is not a game
And I know the rules and I know I must follow
them every single day

I feel that I'm loosing it all
There's nothing left to live for
I'm ending it all in my dreams
It always seems so easy in my sleep

I'm all alone
Waiting for darkness
I wish the sun would slip away

I still believe that you didn't leave me
I see your shadow in the haze

If I could have some peace
Ending the nightmare, closing the chapter
And join you in your sleep
But life is not a game
And I know the rules and I know I must follow
them every single day

I feel that I'm loosing it all
There's nothing left to live for
I'm ending it all in my dreams
And deep inside I knew

That there was one part of me
That tried to save you from yourself
The other let you go and I will
Never deny I was walking on the line of
Here and nevermore in selfish pride
