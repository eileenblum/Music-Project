All I can feel is the beat of my heart
And I count every breath that I take
The darkness will drain all the pleasure and pain
And delete all emotions inside of me

(For better or worse)
There's a shadow in my soul now
I feel it inside as I am fading away
(The replay of my life)
I see it running in my mind now
Familiar faces smiling back at me
On the day I was born

Now I am dying all alone

A view from the past will remind me of the good times
That I had in the innocent days
I was one of the young with a spirit so strong
Never knew make believe from reality

(The tears that I cry)
Through the eyes of the betrayer
It might be the last that I taste in this life
(There's no room for the sorrow) 
In this is image of a lifetime
Only delight and the joy life has given me

Oh, it's taking me back to the glory days
I smile as I fade in this empty space
The memories awake and it feels like I'm alive (like I'm alive)
In the glory days.

I have no regrets, I know there is no return
Awaiting the end of it all
But I'm walking on air every minute in here
This is a beautiful way to go

It's taking me back (taking me back) to the glory days
I smile as I fade in this empty space
The memories awake (the memories awake) and it feels like I'm alive (like I'm alive)
In the glory days.

I know the end will soon be here
And all I am will disappear
I wish I could stay in wonderland
And relive the glory days
