The dawn replace the night
It brings me shelter from the darkness
And let me live another day.

I hear the night birds sing
Their final encore to the moonlight
The morning sun is on the rise.

In the safety of the light
I see the world ignite.
For some a day, for some a lifetime.

The spirits all around us
Are so anxious in their daydreams
I know something here ain't right.
I hear that you're awake
Your eyes are smiling when you see me
You are purity personified.

In the safety of the light
I see the world ignite.
For some a day, for some a lifetime.

The real life tragedienne
Defy the shadows again
Out of the darkness, into the light
A will of steel inside
Rule over time and tide
Out of the darkness, into the light

The nightfall dim the light
And bring me closer to the darkness
And deprive me of another day.
Oh, I hear the night birds sing,
They sing the tribute to the moonlight
While the sun dies in the sky

The real life tragedienne
Defy the shadows again
Out of the daylight
Into the night
I must be strong inside
Now there's no place to hide
Out of the daylight
Into the night

Among the shadows here
All goodness disappear
Out of the daylight
Into the night
I must be strong inside
Now there's no place to hide
Out of the daylight, into the night
