The darkness returned in this void where I will fall
All the dreams from my past they're all clouded by their call
I'm getting used to funerals that no one attends
So I'm following the shadows to where they will descend
(Oooh ...)

All I can hear is the rhythm of my heart
And the blood that will run for the last time in my veins
Nothing here can save me I am already forlorn
So let me leave this body let my soul be reborn

Now I feel that I am fading away (fading away)
Another destiny, a different day

I am no longer you, I'm falling
You are no longer me, I'm falling
We are no longer one, I'm falling

[Lead: TN]

The feelings growing stronger
Now I know that it's you (I know that's you)
After all these years of pain
You're finally through

The pattern in the sky
I see a soul is reborn
The shadows, they gather in a celebration of life

Now I know he's no longer falling (falling)
Now I know he's no longer falling (falling)
Now I know that he's no longer falling (falling, no longer falling)
