I'm in too deep
Climbing up and down these walls
My heart is lost
Though I never thought I'd give it up

Now I'm back in the darkness
Of the waiting room for ones to be
I sacrifice your body and my soul
So that he'll be coming back for you
So that he'll be coming back for you

Cause when you feel all the darkness surround you
You're selling your soul to the shadowman
In pain you are begging your master to guide you
Back to the dark though you don't know why
And now you realize that your soul is no longer alive
And than you feel that you are dead inside

The stars align
In a formation never seen before
A premonition, a prophecy
(And) the shadow has returned to life

I hope you won't remember
Who you were and how you used to be
You gave it up cause you couldn't take the pain
Of always looking through a strangers eyes

All the stars alight
In the newborn night
They are falling from the sky
And the colors here around me is fading to gray

Now I can feel that the powers surround me
Caught in the spell of the shadowman
The spirits awake and they gather to hide you
Cause this is the end and I don't know why
What in the world can I have done to deserve the pain
That is burning inside me as I close my eyes.

The light of the day has awakened to open up my eyes
Where are you now, did he take you away
The spirits arise and they tell me that they will show the way
They will lead me to a sanctuary
If you were there it would really ease the pain
(Aaaah :) He will return tonight

Now you're on the outside looking in
Waiting for the battle to begin
Waiting for the shadowman to take a part of me
Wonder why he couldn't end it all
When he had the chance to make me fall
Could it be the love inside of you?

Now I can see that the darkness surround me
The night is in league with the shadowman
All of the spirits are gathered beside you
Guarding your soul in the candlelight
If we are strong and fill our hearts with love we'll survive
The joy and the laughter will defend your life
