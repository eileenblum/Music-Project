The time has come to tell the story.
You have to know.
I must unveil the truth about the way that we are

Oh, I'm afraid
I can't imagine what it must be like
To hear the words that I'm about to tell you: your world is a lie

Oh no I can't believe it nor deny it
Can someone tell me what I am to do now
Why was I abandoned did they leave me for dead
(And) the writing on the wall leaves me in a state of shock

Oh, who am I?
I'm just a stranger to myself
My heart is aching
I must find the truth of my life

Now I will be searching night and day
Until the day I will reveal the secret
A necessary evil but I'll do what it takes
I just have to find the one that will end the state of shock

Now I will be searching night and day
Until the day I will reveal the secret
A necessary evil but I'll do what it takes
I just have to find the one that will end the state of shock

I wave goodbye
I see you're crying
But I'll return to tell the story
So I can paper over the cracks in my soul

I can hear the voices in the night
I can't be real, it's my imagination
I know that I am worried
That I'm tired and afraid
Just a stranger in the dark living in a state of shock

Living, living in a state of shock
Living, living in a state of shock
Living, living in a state of shock
