I can't believe that this is happening to me
So many years of being young, wild and free
When I'm asleep I'm living like a refugee
A plague upon my soul for all eternity?

How come I never knew until the night that she had spoken?
Why did she have to tell me 'bout the way we used to be?

She made a sacrifice for the sake of your survival

I'm awake in shadowland
Somebody take me to the landscape where the dawn awaits
Wide awake in shadowland
Let me unite with my reality in the light of day again

[Lead: DS]

The sprits took me to the valley of the light
Where the rays of dawn prepare for battle with the night
Withering dandelions are scattered in the wind
And right there by a gateway, no! I can't believe the sight.

Someone is standing there in a silver blue reflection

You see the one that you were in the life you had before.
It's just a memory. They come alive here by the gateway

I'm awake in shadowland
Somebody take me to the landscape where the dawn awaits
Wide awake in shadowland
Let me unite with my reality in the light of day again

As I enter the gateway I can see it disappear into the mist
It seems like there is no return from here
I feel so peaceful inside, like my soul is led to rest
The landscape is so enchanting, I'm spellbound by the light.
(What is happening to me?)
(What is happening to me?)

[Lead: DS/TN]

The dream is taking me to places unknown
I'm not so sure that I wanna be here anymore
I've lost the power to control my awakening
(I'm imprisoned in the world of sleep.)

I can't believe that this is happening to me
A plague upon my soul for all eternity?

(Yaaeh!) Right here in front of me I see the angel of illusion

She's just another image from the comers of your mind
She's just a fantasy from your imagination

I am lost in shadowland
Nothing can take me back to where the dawn relight the day
All alone in shadowland
And I wonder if I'll ever feel alive again

(What is happening to me? ...)
