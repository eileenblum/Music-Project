Life, is forever in this world of light
Beyond the veil of time and space.
Here I hide from the shadows

Nothing here can hurt me
I feel stronger now
I was revived at the gate
No more tears and no more pain
Here in the empire of my mind.

I can hear the spirits calling
They say that I must leave now
Or become the dreaming dead

Death is eternal, life is not
I've made my choice this is where I belong
A slave to the illusion

Nothing here can hurt me
I will never leave
Never return to the gate
No more lies and no more sorrow
Here in the empire of my thoughts.

And for as long as the world is turning
And for as long as the sun is burning
I will be here, forever and never leave
And for as long as the world is turning
And for as long as my heart is yearning
I will be here, forever
Forever and never leave

Back in the real world
A family is gathered
Around a hospital bed
Mourning for their son,
Living thru the machine

A gypsy woman found him lifeless in the cold
In the forest, near the tree from the legend of the breathing shadow

For as long as the world is turning
And for as long as the sun is burning
They will miss you forever and never forget
For as long as the world is turning
And for as long as the sun is burning
They will miss you, forever and ever
Forever and never believe that you are gone.

You stop. It's over now.
The machine is silent and so are you.
The gypsy woman spoke to your coffin.
(And) she said: I hope you liked my bedtime stories.

Aaaaaaaaaaah!!!

The end.
