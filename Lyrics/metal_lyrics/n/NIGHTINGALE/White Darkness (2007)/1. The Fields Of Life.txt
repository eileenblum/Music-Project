Tell me why I stand here again
I cannot seem to make up my mind
And now I'm right where I wanted to be
But still I find it hard to smile

I wait for the euphoria to come
Maybe I've got it all wrong

I'm stranded
On the fields of life
No

Not again, I said to myself
But there you were and shook me around
Dragged me out from the cave in my mind
A place I wanted no one to find

Destiny has always had a way with me
Opened up my lying eyes and made me see

I hope you hear me
When you come too near me
I don't know how to handle desire

On the fields of life
I don't know where to go
On the fields of life
I don't know where to turn
On the fields of life

I don't wanna lose what I have found
A light in the darkness around

Why can't I let go of the fear
And let all my doubt disappear
I depend on the balance divine
Always so hard to combine

I hate the insecurity inside of me
I will always be my biggest enemy

I will always fear me
Cause when no one steer me I will go
Into the fire alight

On the fields of life
I don't know where to go
On the fields of life
I don't know where to turn
On the fields of life
I don't wanna die alone
On the fields of life
