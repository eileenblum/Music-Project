I told you my secret you said it would be safe
You would never show, and no one was to know

Sharing my burden, giving some relief
That was my true belief, but the I was deceived

Just like the stars that keep on glowing when they turn to dust
You left your mark that stained my soul with your betrayal and your broken trust

Kissed me like Judas and poisoning my heart
That's what you've done to me
I want all of the world to see

Just like the stars that keep on glowing when they turn to dust
You left your mark that stained my soul with your betrayal and your broken trust

Oh I wish we'd never met
It's time to forgive now, it's time to forget

Then these feelings would be gone
It's time to look forward, it's time to move on

I'll never know the answer why
Never know why

Don't need your confession, or any lame excuse
Because what goes around, always comes around

Just like the stars that keep on glowing when they turn to dust
You left your mark that stained my soul with your betrayal and your broken trust
