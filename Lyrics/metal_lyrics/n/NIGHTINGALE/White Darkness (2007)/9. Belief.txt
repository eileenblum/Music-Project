Now I know nothing's what it seems
Money talks
Now I see religion screams
I believe in what I hear and what I see
and in myself, the king of my own destiny

The angles of heaven, the demons of hell
are creatures we had to create
Why are you scared to see who you are
and be in control of your life, and fate

I can't see why you choose to dedicate
all your life to assure you enter heavens gates

I can't say that I am right and you are wrong
but common sense can tell a truth or two
All those lives lost in battle of belief
It's all because you were born to believe in
different lies

The angles of heaven, the demons of hell
are creatures we had to create
Why are you scared to see who you are
and be in control of your life, and fate
If god is above us and Satan beneath
we all belong here on earth
Cause no one is good or evil to the core
We all have our halos and horns to bear
