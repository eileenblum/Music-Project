It's the way you behave and the things that you say
It' the twinkle of frustration in your eyes
That reveals your illusion
A life built on bundles of lies

For some time I believed you
And the stories that you told
It really was a glamorous display
Now your fortune is long gone
Reality is heading your way

Trial and error without reason or rhyme
All those hours and days such a waste, a waste of time
Trial and error takes us further apart
Never learn anything from mistakes or by heart

I have begged you to listen, tried to slow you down
But you're not so keen on taking my advice
You're so blind, you don't notice
You make the same mistake twice

Trial and error without reason or rhyme
All those hours and days such a waste, a waste of time
Trial and error takes us further apart
Never learn anything from mistakes or by heart

Mountains of failure
You're standing on the top no one can see you
Mountains of failure
You're standing on the top no one can hear you

You are stuck in the circle, chasing yourself
With no way out there's one thing you must learn
At the end of the day
There's no more bridges to burn

Trial and error without reason or rhyme
All those hours and days such a waste, a waste of time
Trial and error takes us further apart
Never learn anything from mistakes or by heart

Let's try again.
