Nothing can move me when I'm fading
Slowly turning into air
No one can see me when I'm hiding
Somewhere beyond reality

I'm drifting away to my own landscape
Floating on the rivers of despair
And when the world upon my shoulders wears too heavy
I let it slip away

I am safe here
Inside my white darkness
Problems don't bother me in here
All alone here, a world in white darkness
The one place to where I always will return
Always will return

I won't deny that I am tempted
To stay here and to never ever leave
But to go where for good I need a reason
A battle impossible to win

Nowadays I'm stronger, feeling more secure
Dealing with my problems that I've had before
I've finally found the harmony I need in life
I need to be awake, don't let it wither away

We all have dark days in our lives
There will always be the moments when life has no mercy
Any loved ones will believe him
Before we die

I am safe here
Inside my white darkness
Problems don't bother me in here
All alone here, a world in white darkness
The one place to where I always will return
Always will return
