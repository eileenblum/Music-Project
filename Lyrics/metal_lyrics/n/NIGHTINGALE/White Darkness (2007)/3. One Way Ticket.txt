He always tried to seize the day
Now he let it slip away
Shining sun or falling rain
Doesn't matter anymore
Another boring day begins
Already knows how it will end
And now he's losing faith in you

You used to guide him
You showed the way the he should follow
He built a world upon your promise
He would be saved

He's all alone, no one to hold
When the nights are long and cold
He prayed to you for some relief
For some reward for his belief
He tried so hard to do it right
Saw the world in black and white
But now it's fading into grey

He feel temptation
He's never had a night of passion
Or numbed his mind with the firewater
Never felt alive

Oh he's lost again
Now the world will see
Another soul led astray
Another destiny thrown away
The one way ticket in his trembling hand
Is the testimony to the tragedy
Was he never meant to be
never meant to be

He boarded the plane towards the end
A grave among the neon lights
Realized his wildest dreams
In a drunken, hazy night

He sold his life and the money made
Spent it all on the last crusade
His celebration of the end

The one's who found him
Said he smiled and looked so peaceful
And in his hand he held a letter
It said... "No one came"

I hope you're happy in the world beyond
That you find what you need
That you get what you want

The world has lost again
And no one will see
Another soul led astray
Another destiny thrown away
The final letter in his lifeless hand
Is the testimony to the tragedy
Was he never meant to be??
