I still feel your presence
Although you're not here
Your voice your smile and laughter
Is now replaced with fear
I'm holding on to memories
That slowly fade away
Force my self to hold on
And to live for one more day

Time is a two-faced creature
Of mercy and of pain
No way to control it
All efforts is in vain
Destiny is lawless
It makes up its own rules
Together they are mocking
And make us look - make us look like fools

Give me reasons to leave
Turn around and walk away
Give me reasons to stay
And be a part of this world once again
Give me reasons to leave
Turn around and walk away
Give me reasons to stay
You held the fate of my life in your hands

I thought I could handle everything
I thought that I was strong
Life was running flawless
And nothing could go wrong
But I froze when I saw it coming
Oh, the turning of tide
Washed away in sadness
With no place for me to hide

Give me reasons to leave
Turn around and walk away
Give me reasons to stay
And be a part of this world once again
Give me reasons to leave
Turn around and walk away
Give me reasons to stay
And be a part of this world once again
Give me reasons to leave
Turn around and walk away
Give me reasons to stay
You held the fate of my life in your hands
