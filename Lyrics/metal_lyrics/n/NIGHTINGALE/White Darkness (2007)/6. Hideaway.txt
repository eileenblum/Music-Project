There's a place that no one knows of
A safe haven filled with bliss
It's far away I'd like to stay there
And make my clouded sky clear up

No tears no sorrow
In my hideaway of dreams

Suddenly my pain has turned into laughter
No restrains are keeping me locked inside this shell I'm in
And soon reality comes crawling again
Disabled as I lie, you enjoy life
(you enjoy life)

There's no light, where I'm abandoned
I've lost all track of time and space
No friendly face, is recognized here
Behind my eyes I'm still awake

Suddenly my pain has turned into laughter
No restrains are keeping me locked inside this shell I'm in
And soon reality comes crawling again
Disabled as I lie, you enjoy life
(you enjoy life)

I'm stashed away, to waste away
I won't be preying on your mind anymore
I will forgive, you will forget
What goes around will come around at the end

Suddenly my pain has turned into laughter
No restrains are keeping me locked inside this hell I'm in
And soon reality comes crawling again
