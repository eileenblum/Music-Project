Now I Am here again
So tired of pretending
I know what my life is about
Trying to find a way
The almighty solution
Before I have run out of time

I still remember when
I believed that the fire
Inside me was destined to burn
Every day and night
For as long as 'I'm breathing
Now only the ashes remain

Always seek always speak
Of the moment all comes together
Am I back right on track
Are the changes made to the better

I hope that what will end all this confusion
The conclusion
I am just healing the wounds of my soul
(healing the wounds of my soul)

Maybe I'll never learn
From all the mistakes I have done
Since the day I was born
Maybe I'll die alone
Surrounded by memories
Of all of the love I denied

Always seek always speak
Of the moment all comes together
Am I back right on track
Are the changes made to the better

I hope that what will end all this confusion
The conclusion
I am just healing the wounds of my soul

Here in the darkness
I wait for the light to arise
And bring me back to where my heart was filled with life
Here in the darkness
Will someone please show me the way
To reignite the spark
And let me glow again

Here in this empty room
In my tower of sorrow
I decide to start over again
I hope to find someone new
That will search for the pieces
And try to recover my heart

Always seek always speak
Of the moment all comes together
Am I back right on track
Are the changes made to the better

I hope that what will end all this confusion
The conclusion
I am just healing the wounds of my soul
