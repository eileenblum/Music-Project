All my life
You have been here beside me
Through the days and nights
We were as one
Now you're gone
I'm sorry that I couldn't see
That I treated you wrong
That I drove you away

Oh... my love don't leave me here alone
Oh... I cannot make it on my own
Without you all I am will slowly fall apart
I need you here to bring some light into my heart

Now and then
I feel you inside of my soul
Like a flash of light
In the dead of night
Everyday I hope I will meet you again
And invite you to stay
Forevermore

Oh... my love don't leave me here alone
Oh... I cannot make it on my own
Without you all I am will slowly fall apart
I need you here to bring some light into my heart

Then there is moments just like this
Times that I so dearly miss
When you return in all your glory

A piece of paper and pen
Some time alone and then
We are immortalized forever

I beg you
Don't ever leave for good
