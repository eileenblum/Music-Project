Come into my game of solitaire
You could enter in and read me like a scrawl
Adrift upon the tide and in the air
I will let you see the dreamer through the wall

I wish that we could pick the world apart
I believe there is someone inside the pain
Life is wasted here behind the veil
I will never be free
Can't you see that I've mourned again

I watch the days they crash into the night
All the secrecy the angels never came
The fine line between what's yours and mine
Is it mine alone the solitude of shame

The whispered word and now you're on my side
I am almost alive in your care my love
I'll believe you when you set me free
I'll believe you though you don't know who I am

Take me through the darkness to the world beyond
Will you wait for my arrival at the wake
No one will remember me when I have gone
And they'll never understand they're at the wake

The fear of fire burning red and white
Will my name remain carved inside a stone
Your celestial son is born tonight
To a waiting grave the dreamers have to go

I see the signs of the veil up high
I can feel you whenever you move on the wall
I'll release you when you've turned the tide
I'll release you and burn you away from my soul

Someone here will never see the world outside
I will never know who's waiting at the wake
Someone here will never have to be alone
You're the one who will remember at the wake

I'll let the waters cleanse my eyes
And follow the priest into the circular light
I'll let you go when I have fallen
And you don't know where you've arrived this time my love

Curse believe me when I summon you
There's another dream it beckons you to go
Summer's waiting for you to be new
I'll erase the dream now I go to sleep

And I can feel forever cry for me this time
You are not the only one here at the wake
No one will remember what was once my crime
And they'll never understand this is my wake
