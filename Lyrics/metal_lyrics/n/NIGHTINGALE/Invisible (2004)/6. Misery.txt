I believe in self-destruction
I am heading for the grave
I am losing my direction
I will never smile again

I am waiting for the downfall
I'm longing for the end
The darkness all around me is my one and only friend

I believe that life is just a game
Another day, but the pain remains the same

Eternal misery
I'm living in denial of all I am

The world around is waiting for me to stumble and to fall
And whenever I need someone I always find no one at all

It has always been this way for me since the day that I was born
A bearer of a shattered soul and a mind all ripped and torn

I believe that life is just a game
Another day but the pain remains the same

Eternal misery
I'm living in denial of all I am

I feel my time is running out
I am wasted in this world
But I am too afraid to end my life
I live in fear of the other side

I find shelter in the liquids
I'm hiding in the smoke
I wish I knew why I was born and why my life such a joke

I am the god of self-deception in the kingdom of despair
Even in the light of day I see darkness everywhere

I am looking for the answer
Can you tell me why I am here
I'm feeling weaker day by dad
I am soon to disappear

I can feel my time is running out
I'll never know what life is all about

Eternal misery
I'm living in denial of all I am
