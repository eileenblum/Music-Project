I'm afraid I have to go and never return
It will be over in a while

I can't believe I'm going to die
There is no remedy or cure
This is the end I'm going to die

So many things I wanna do, that I wanna try
But they say the end is nigh

All of my dreams are fading away
Why is it happening to me
Life is pain when you're going to die

I never found the time to tell the world
I'm sorry for the things I have done
They might be wrong
And there could be a miracle
A raincheck on my demise?

In my dreams they find a cure
I feel so alive
You find me walking on the wind

But then I wake up with tears in my eyes
My heart is pounding and I feel that I am dying
I'm dying inside

They gave me days, maybe a week
Before I must go to the land of no return

I wish I knew if I was going to burn
Or if the angels will arrive
And show me the heaven I denied.

I never found the time to tell the world
I'm sorry for the things I have done
No, I was wrong it was too late for miracles
And a raincheck on my demise?
