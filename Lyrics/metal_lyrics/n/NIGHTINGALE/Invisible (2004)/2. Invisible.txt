We'll be together forever
Without you I'm sure I will never
Live through the day, you're the lifeblood in me

All of the days I've been living
I never took, always giving
Take me for granted I'll always be here
For you

Tell me something more to tell you
We're only talking if it matters to you
Tell me something more to tell you

I wish I could be more than no one
I know this game, it will go on
I am one the pawns and you're always the king

Tell me something more to tell you
We're only talking if it matters to you
Tell me something more to tell you

I am so lonely without you
When I am alone I'm beyond blue
I am the jester in the kingdom of you

Tell me something more to tell you
We're only talking if it matters to you
Tell me something more to tell you

Tell me something more to tell you
We're only talking if it matters to you
Tell me something more to tell you
