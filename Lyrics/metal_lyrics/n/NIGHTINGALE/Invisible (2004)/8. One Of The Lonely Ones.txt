I can still remember the life I had before
One of the careful children of the light
No one heard my prayers no one came to save
Save me from the forces of the dark
Inside looking outside
Doomed to avoid the sun
A slave to darkness at nightfall I arise

I never believed that they were real, just a fable
All of the stories I have heard, could be real now
There is no cure for what I am, I'm eternal
Now I know, I'm one of them,
One of the creatures of the night

We're always all around you
At night we're rising to feed
We lie in wait in the shadows 'til the dawn
I know you won't believe me
I hardly believe it myself
But I can feel my soul have been replaced

I never believed that they were real, just a fable
All of the stories I have heard, could be real now
There is no cure for what I am, I'm eternal
Now I know, I'm one of them,
One of the creatures of the night

Waiting for the night
To shelter me
I'm ling out of sight
For the world to see
I will be alive
Forevermore
When the sunlight disappear
You better stay away
You better get down and pray

There is no escape
Once you're in my sight
You can see your fate
In my demonic eyes
You will be one of us
A child of the night
You will never die
One of the lonely ones
