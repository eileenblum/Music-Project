I'm taken through the hourglass
I'm being tossed upon the sand
Am I alone
The words still linger
In my head

I'm breathing in the salty air
There is a mark upon my hand
Is there a seat for me
Among the dreaming dead

I was sealed in a tomb of sadness
I was trapped in a cell of sleep
I was held by the hands of time
Now this time is mine to keep

I'm still alive
Far from the casket and cradle
I'm still alive
I've taken the fate out of fatal
I'm still alive

They tied me to the pendulum
They hung my heart across the sky
I found my soul eclipsed
My body crucified

I was caged in the age of miracles
I was set in a hollow sky
I was kept under shadow's lock
Now I don't know how to die

I'm still alive
Far from the casket and cradle
I'm still alive
I've taken the fate out of fatal
I'm still alive

My star is rising now
As the ferryman appears
He bears an offering
A piece of silver for my fears

I couldn't cut the deal
Mine is not his fate to buy
And as I fly my canvas
He ascends on high

Shattering the Earth and the Heavens
(I feel his icy breath of fire consuming me)
Shattering the Earth and the Heavens
(The demon rises up, a bird of coal and flame)
Shattering the Earth and the Heavens
(I am surrounded by the wings of water now)
Shattering the Earth and the Heavens
(They've come to lift me out of here)

I'm still alive
Far from the casket and cradle
I'm still alive
I've taken the fate out of fatal
I'm still alive
