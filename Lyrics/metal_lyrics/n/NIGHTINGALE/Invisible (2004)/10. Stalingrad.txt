The memories remain from when I was alive
All I used to be is buried in the snow.
I lie there all alone faraway from home,
Fought until the end, with nothing to defend

We were told that we were heroes
Not to be defeated
We found it out the hard way, they all lied
I can see the few remaining dying all around me
None of them will go to heaven

Let me take you back to where it began
Remind you of the pain gathered here today

I was young, the road before me wide and never-ending
Heading for a life of you and me
The days of joy, the tears of laughter
Echoes here forever.
The time had come to prove I was a man.

One of a million marching into a certain grave
I made the war my enemy, no lorry to the brave
If only I could find, a way to ease my mind
Leave all this pain behind.
Why I am here. Tell me why

The world I knew was out of reach
Reality was under siege
The innocent was torn apart
In this hell out there we were dying one by one

Faraway from the battlefield
By the choices made our fate was sealed
The visions of a mind insane
Is to blame for this massacre in vein

Never to retreat
Never say surrender
The winter and the cold
The invincible defender
They had the nation and Mother Nature on their side:

I was told I'd be a hero
I would be rewarded
But I don't see the stone upon my grave
Now I am just a lonely spirit
Trapped inside a nightmare
The souls of all I killed won't let me go
