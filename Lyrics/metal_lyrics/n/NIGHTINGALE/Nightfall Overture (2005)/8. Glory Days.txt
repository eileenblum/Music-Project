[Swano]

Like I'm alive!

All I can feel is the beat of my heart
And I count every breath that I take
The darkness will drain all the pleasure and pain
And delete all emotions inside of me

(The tears that I cry)
Through the eyes of the betrayer
It might be the last that I taste in this life
(There's no room for the sorrow) in this is image of a lifetime
Only delight and the joy life has given me

Oh, it's taking me back to the glory days
I smile as I fade in this empty space
The memories awake and it feels like I'm alive
(Like I'm alive) in the glory days.

A view from the past will remind me of the good times
That I had in the innocent days
I was one of the young with a spirit so strong
Never knew make believe from reality

(The tears that I cry)
Through the eyes of the betrayer
It might be the last that I taste in this life
(There's no room for the sorrow) in this is image of a lifetime
Only delight and the joy life has given me

Oh, it's taking me back to the glory days
I smile as I fade in this empty space
The memories awake and it feels like I'm alive
(Like I'm alive) in the glory days.

I know the end will soon be here
And all I am will disappear
I wish I could stay in wonderland
And relive the glory days

Oh, it's taking me back to the glory days
I smile as I fade in this empty space
The memories awake and it feels like I'm alive
(Like I'm alive) in the glory days.
(It feels like I'm alive) again.
In the glory days.
