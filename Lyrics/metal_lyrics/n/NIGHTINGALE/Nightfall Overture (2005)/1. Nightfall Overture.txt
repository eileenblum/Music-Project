[Swano]

Just another midnight hour
Enjoying the cold of a dark winter night
I see the darkness devour
Everything that once was light
And the stars in the sky
Are so lifeless and so grey

Iâm walking in the light of the moon
When the night repairs the day
From the trees comes a mournful tune, oh
I am not alone I can hear them say
The moon is your guide
There is no place you can hide

Oh, when the night comes down
And all the colours turns black and white
Oh, when the night comes down
And the dark is conducting the nightfall overture

Who am I in the eyes of the world
What have I done that will remain
Who am I? Will I ever know?
But right now I am the king of this winter lane, oh

Is there anybody out there?
In the middle of the mist in the field
The air here donât relieve me anymore
Something is here that I have never felt before
Iâve never felt before...

I am lost in the maze of the night
Iâm surrounded by lights so dark
Am I losing all track of time?
I'm trying to come out of this endless park

And the air is so dry
I can hear the daylight cry

Oh, when the night comes down
And all the colours turns black and white
Oh, when the night comes down
And the dark is conducting the nightfall overture
