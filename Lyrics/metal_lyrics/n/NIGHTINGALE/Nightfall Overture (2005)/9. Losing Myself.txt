[Music by Dan Swano, Lyrics by Jonas Renkse]

Losing time, counting hours
I'll never see myself again
And even though I'm alone
I can't remember what I'm missing
So I leave it be

Closing down
I expect the hopelessness and everything
And even though I'm alone
I can't remember what I'm missing
and that's all I need

I am lost
I feel I am sinking now
like I was made of rain
Like a wave I roll into the endless night

[Chorus:]
I am not afraid
as the darkness starts to make its way
I breathe as hard as you as I end my day
I sigh in silence as I try to sink that deep
as deep as you and make sure that I won't fall asleep

Losing days, I need no hours
I'll never be myself again
And even though it's killing me
I can't remember what I am missing
so I leave it be.

I'm closing down
I expect the hopelessness again tonight
And even though it's killing me
I can't remember what I am missing
But it might be you

I am lost
I feel I am sinking now
like I was made of rain
Like a wave I roll into the needless night

[Chorus]

That I won't fall asleep

[Chorus]
