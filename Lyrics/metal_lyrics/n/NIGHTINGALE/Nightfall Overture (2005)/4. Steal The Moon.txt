[Swano]

Now he's here inside her ocean sky.
He's dreaming again, he's released from all his fears.
Oh I'm standing here watching the world through his eyes,
There's no reason to leave since I know no time never dies, no.

And I can fell the rain upon your cheek.
You don't know that I could steal the moon for you.
You don't know I'd sing an endless croon for you. oh.

Oh It's strange in here, knowing I'll have your name.
I will never be me, I'm like art in a stolen frame, oh.

And I can fell the rain upon your cheek, oh oh.
You don't know that I could steal the moon for you.
You don't know I'd sing an endless croon for you.

And if I would die, would I be reborn like you,
And start all over again, with a life so fresh and new?
A combination of love hate and jealousy.
I'm stuck in here but you will soon be free.

You don't know I could steal the moon for you.
You don't know I could steal the moon for you.

You don't know that I could steal the moon for you.
You don't know I'd sing an endless croon for you.
You don't know that I could steal the moon for you.
Iâd steal the moon for you.
You don't know I'd sing an endless croon for you.
Iâd steal the moon for you.

Steal the moon for you.
