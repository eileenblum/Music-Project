[Swano]

I fly away to another dimension
Far beyond reality
I fly away from these evil voices
Is it time to meet my destiny?
It brings me back to my childhood
And the hateful memories
The show is rolling before my eyes
And once again I see the tragedies

Dreamland is calling I am drifting away
Far from the shadows that's haunting my day

Now I can see the old wood hillside
That's the place where we used to play
I brings me closer to the place I fear
The place where my best friend passed away
I didn't mean it, I didn't know
But what I did made him fall dead to the ground
I get to see the scene repeated
And then I hear the voices call

The dreamland is showing the dark of my past
One with the shadows, the die has been cast
...And I lost...
...And I lost...

Let me awake, let me open up my eyes
Back to reality
This nightmare seems so real
There is no way to be free
I must return to my body
I will die if I don't wake up
The voices say that I should stay
I wish that I could make them stop
The dreamland is hell and I know it for sure
I need to stay alive and this ain't no cure

I feel that I am fading away
The shadow come closer and it force me to stay
I'm falling apart with every beat of my heart
The frost in my soul is so cold
And in the haze I see a hand to hold
I try to reach out but it's moving away
And the voices are laughing
Laughing as I pray...
