[Nouga / Swano / Schect]

I'm all alone
Waiting for no one
And I see the daylight fade away
I'm so afraid
I know you're around me
And I hear you crying in the wind

If I could bring you back
If I had the power,
I'd give you my world and my life,
You'd have it all.
But lifeâs not a game,
And I know the rules,
And I know I must follow them every single day.

I feel that I'm loosing it all.
There's nothing left to live for.
I'm ending it all in my dreams.
It always seems so easy in my sleep.

I'm all alone, waiting for darkness.
And I wish the sun would slip away
And I still believe that you didn't leave me.
And I see your shadow in the haze.

If I could have some peace
Ending the nightmare, closing the chapter.
And join you in your sleep.
But life is not a game
And I know the rules,
And I know I must follow them every single day.

I feel that I'm loosing it all.
There's nothing left to live for.
I'm ending it all in my dreams
And deep inside I knew that there was one part of me,
That tried to save you from yourself.
The other let you go and I will
Never deny, I was walking on the line
Of here and nevermore in selfish pride.

I feel that I'm loosing it all.
There's nothing left to live for.
I'm ending it all in my dreams.
It always seems so easy in my sleep.
