I woke up with a feeling of emptiness inside.
Suddenly felt so lonely like a part of me had died, oh.
I could sacrifice the knowledge and the powers I possess,
To relive the moment when my hand caressed your frozen soul.
Nevermore, never ever, here beside me.
You and I alone when daylight is falling. I'll never see you again.
Deafened by the silence, present in this room.
Waiting for my maker to save me from this gloom, oh.
And then I had this sight inside me I had never seen before,
And suddenly the one I missed, came in through my door.
Finally, you're here beside me, in the darkness.
Something about you has changed, I don't seem to know you.
I see in your eyes you're not here. It's not you.
Stricken by illusion, vision in my mind,
a victim of confusion, all sense is left behind, oh.
I felt that deep inside him was still a part of you.
So I seduced a shadow and what might be you came through
Into my womb.
Oh I feel, you're here inside me, and I will give you shelter now.
I will always be here. I know that I've found you again.
