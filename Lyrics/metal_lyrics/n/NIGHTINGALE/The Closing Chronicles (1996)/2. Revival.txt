No longer a shadow, once again I walk the face of the earth.
I'm in his body, I'm free to live,
And I will make sure that he will see no rebirth.
He'll never find the answer, he'll never know the way
I'll never ever forgive him for what he did to me that day.
I don't know how to be in this world, I left so long ago.
Now I'm back in the shape of another,
But that is something that noone ever will know.
I'll never tell the secret. Noone would believe it anyway.
Well nothing's going to take me away, no. I have decided to stay.

I see the horizon through the eyes of a stranger,
the one that I'm living inside.
For seventeen years I've been held in the darkness,
My life is no longer denied.
I wonder where he is right now'
Probably trapped in the parallel sky.
I've been there, I have felt all this darkness.
Though I was reprieved,
I was far too young to die.
I regained the power. I was strong, I returned
Like a breathing shadow, I will receive what I've earned.
Even though I pretend I'm someone else, I have finally had my revenge.
