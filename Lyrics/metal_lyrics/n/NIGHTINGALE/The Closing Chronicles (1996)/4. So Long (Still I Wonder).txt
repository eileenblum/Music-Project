It's morning again.
I wish all the emptiness would end and my friend would return.
Though I know that you're still alive, I'm scared, I'm almost paralyzed
Of the emotions that's growing inside. And something is missing.
And when I take a look around me, it's like I see you everywhere,
Anywhere.

So long, still I wonder why. So long, and my river runs dry,
And I know all the secrets you know, But I don't know where to go.
Life must go on, though it is hard not to end it all.
I wish I had known what you knew. I'm blaming myself.
The shadow is oh, so strong, its power distorted my view.
And something is missing.
And when I take a look around me, it's like I see you everywhere,
Everywhere.
