Suddenly something changed inside as like the darkness turn to light.
And I saw reflections from the past flashing by
Like a starfall in the night.
It feels like I'm turn into someone else,
It's like my past life said goodbye.
Reincarnation of our souls well now I know it's not a lie.
I wonder what I will be or when I'll arrive'
The magic moment my body comes alive.
But who am I to say all this, I may not even remember what I miss.
I can come to a different part of the earth, maybe to another world.
Who can tell'
I know he is out there pretending he's me,
I guess it's a sight I will never see.
I still remember a few things from my past,
But only things in relation to aghast
Here in this waiting room for one's to be,
I guess there's nothing more to do
than to realize I might be reborn and the whole of me will be new
Oh how I wish I could dream again so I could dream of you.
But It took the last of my soul, it took the last of my soul,
but I remember you.
I wonder if she can remember, or maybe the world doesn't even exist.
To me it feels like yesterday, but I might have been lost,
I might have been lost for ages.
Wishing I could be more human, though I know I still have a soul.
With a few sad memories, without any sentences structure,
I may be lost forever. And the darkness turn black again,
And now the journey will begin, am I moving to another stage,
In the process of clearing my thoughts.
It seems like my mind is harder to erase
I may remember too much from the past.
The darkness' no longer carrying me,
and it feels like I'm back at square one.
The pressure is driving me insane,
and maybe there is no sanity left.
This stage of cleansing is twisting my thoughts,
I can think no more, and once again I'm falling a sleep...
Unintelligent life is born, our friend is no longer here.
He's replaced, he's initialized and noone shed a tear'
He was so eager to live again, but now he's gone for all time.
It took the last of his soul.
