[Swano]

I try to escape from the shadows of mine
It's following me wherever I go
It's like someone is breathing behind
My own reflection has turned into my foe
I hear his voice as he speaks unto me
I am here to torment, you will never be free
You'll know the difference of pleasure and pain
If you're sunshine the I am the rain
Can you remember can you recall
You put the noose around my neck
I won't surrender until you fall
You will obey

I am from the other side
And I have come to teach you pain
I'll give a lesson in evil
From the evil side
You're the ocean that I have to drain
And I have come here to reign

It makes this noise that will never stop
I will be strong and never give it up
My shadow drag me like a magnet field
There is no return the maze has been sealed

Can you remember can you recall
You said it would be such an innocent game
You're the offender, and now you crawl
And you obey!

I wonder where we're going
We're gettin' closer to the hill
And the forest of the nightmares
Will we do the same again?

Will he see me hanging just like the way he did
And will he see me end my life
Just the way I ended his?

Hide and seek of life and death
Now it's my turn to see you gasp for your last breath
My friend!

There is this noise in my head
That forces me to do things I do not want to
I hear him say:
I want your body dead
So that I can be reborn, it's my turn to live now
I have been here in this place
that turns hell into heaven for too long now
I will have access to your mind
And I'll get what I want!
