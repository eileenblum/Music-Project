[Swano]

She woke me up in the morning
With a soft and gentle touch
And now I realize that I need her too much
I really don't know if my body will move
If I try to walk away
And something in her eyes are begging me to stay
... Begging me to stay ...

Back on my feet, I'm standing
But I can hardly walk
She's bound to mystery
And I am a sparrow and she's the hawk
I know I must leave and get on with the search
My soul has left me in the lurch
And there is something about her smile
That's killing me inside

Totally drowned in gypsy eyes
I know she can see right through my disguise
Totally drowned in gypsy eyes
And when she smiles is the closest that I'll ever get
To paradise

I am at her door I am leaving
Now it's time to say goodbye
I can see a gypsy tear is shining in her eye
I try to say that I will soon return
And seek shelter for the night
But now I must return to where the dark deceived the light

Totally drowned in gypsy eyes
I know she can see right through my disguise
Totally drowned in gypsy eyes
She is the one that makes my lifeforce arise
Totally drowned in gypsy eyes
I know she can see right through my disguise
Totally drowned in gypsy eyes
And when she smiles is the closest that I'll ever get
To paradise
