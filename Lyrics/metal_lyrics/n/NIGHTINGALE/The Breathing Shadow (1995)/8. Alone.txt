[Swano]

Thinking of the wood that guards the hillside
It has changed in many ways
The best friend that I ever had, I killed him
And I'll always remember his face
But I'm alone...

I'm thinking of the voices from the parklane
How come they just disappeared
Right now I am back where it all started
And now the voices are calling again
But I'm alone...

And the voices are only one voice
I hear it much clearer now
It's like on another level
Where I can hear the words without a blur
And it seems like that we can communicate
I hear him say he's such a lonely soul
A spirit from the lonely skies
And somehow I recall the voice
But I just can't place it in time
- Hey, you should remember me! It said
And then it was gone
Faster than it came
Faster than it came

I am walking down the lane and I am shaking
Now the voices have returned
And I wonder who the hell I've been forsaking
Who will see my bridges burn?
And I am not alone...
And I am not alone...
I'm not alone...

I saw my shadow move
But I didn't move
I has a life of itself
And it's breathing
And you can't runaway from your own shadow
I'm desperately trying to run away from myself
But the shadow is following me wherever I go
Just like my shadow, but it's not my shadow
It's not my shadow
It's not my shadow
