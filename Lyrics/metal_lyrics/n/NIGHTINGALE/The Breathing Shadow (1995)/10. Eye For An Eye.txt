[Swano]

I have no control, he's making my moves
I am like a puppet on a string
To get a hold of my body he must empty my soul
But right now I wonder what the end will bring
I wonder if I am dreaming, if I do will I wake up
Before we reach the forest
Where my dreams will stop
Thinking about the woman
That has saved me from the cold
I really need her here now, I need a hand to hold

And the more that I think of you
The more you fade away
And here in this hell that I am going through
I can't even close my eyes and pray
The noise drives me crazy
But I remain calm
In this blur I hear a melody
It might be the final psalm

It's time for a change
An eye for an eye
Admitting it's strange
He'll live and I'll die
He's out for revenge
An eye for an eye
It's my turn to suffer now
The final goodbye
An eye for an eye
An I for an I

Desperation takes control
My life is slipping away
We're coming closer to the end
And there is nothing that I can do
I see through these eyes, I am blind!

I am thinking about my life the way it used to be
Through the good times and the bad
And all the moments that I've had
It's not a way to end a life
But I guess it was just pretend
I am out walking this winter night
And everything is like before

We enter the forest now and I can see the tree
The rope is still hanging there
Like a monument to forever be
In the noise I hear laughters but I also hear cries
I guess it is my soul I hear
Knowing of his sacrifice?

Please someone release me father
Let this torture stop
I feel a tear is coming as I am climbing higher up
Please my friend forgive me
I wasn't meant to end this way
Trying to control myself, but I am the game you play

And the noose is around my neck
And now my time is here
I wish I could show my regrets and express my fear
Where am I going to can you tell me what we'll be
Will I come to where you are?
I guess I'll just die and see!

The gallow is ready now, an eye for an eye
I wish I could live somehow, but lifeless I'll lie
And he will be born again, I die oh I die
I am jumping now I am losing life an eye for an eye
It's only black and no signs of light

And the shadow has entered my body
And I can hear him say farewell with my voice

"Oh, when the night comes down
And the dark is conducting the nightfall overture"
