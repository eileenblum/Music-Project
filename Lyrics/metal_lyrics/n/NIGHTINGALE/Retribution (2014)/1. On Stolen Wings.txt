Always standing quiet in the shadows
Waiting for the perfect time
Always watching from a striking distance
Ready for the crime

In control of every situation
Good appearence, very polite
After finishing another victim
He's gone and out of sight

He's a modern vampire
He feeds on our energy
He will totally drain you
Before turning his eyes on me

Flying high on stolen wings
Filling his heart with your fear and pain
On the move all night and day
Searching the grounds for an easy prey

He's a master of infiltration
He can blend in everywhere
Never Showing his real intention
The reason why he's here

So remember to look over your shoulder
Be prepared to call his lies
And if you ever think "now it's over"
You will be surprised...

He's a modern vampire
He feeds on our energy
He will totally drain you
He will never set you free

The deep humiliation
Following his trail
Stealing your creations
Leaving you to fail
All your work for nothing
All your dreams are gone
See hime claim your glory
When his work is done

Broken spirit, on your knees
Holding the pieces of what used to be
Everything you struggled for
Living will never be the same no more

Flying high on stolen wings
Filling his heart with your fear and pain...
On the move all night and day
Searching the grounds for an easy prey
For an easy prey
