Her face was smiling, her bright eyes were filled with tears
A people's temple were crowded, she felt no fear

And then she saw him, a man in white
He came so close, she touched him with her hand
And when she heard him, all doubts were gone
"I really think he is a chosen one"

I see Your fate, I give salvation
I'll save your mortal soul Forevermore
Just drink my wine, this bitter potion
And bring an end to all Forevermore

I can't believe that I am here, bloom new paradise
And everyone will see it
See as I watch You'll hate us all, shame we are lost
I count for all eternity (yeah)

The morning sun is cold, she takes a place in mine
The final hour strikes and darkness fills her mind
Where will he see through, no one can tell
The doors of heaven or the gates of hell

I see Your fate, I give salvation
I'll save your mortal soul Forevermore
Just drink my wine, this bitter potion
And bring an end to all Forevermore
