There was something inside of him
About to fall apart
Drifted closer to the edge
Couldn't still his bleeding heart

All doors had closed on him
The riddles would not solve
Weakened, he just shut his eyes
Let the darker side evolve and prevail

Quickly and quietly he faded
As he lost the strength to carry on
It never seemed worth all pain
He had fought in vain
Inside the darkness he would stay

The moment his soul turned cold and jaded
And his will to live had died and gone
The only way out came clear, had to disappear
And lose the dead weight on the ground

The echoes of a dream
Was all that he would be
His puzzled mind could never find
A good reason for his time

He realized too late
We assemble our own fate
It's sad to say, so much easier
To erase than to rewind

A note that he left behind, it said
"Nothing here is true
This world was never meant for me
But I'm sure I'll find mine too..."

The absence within his mind
Was present all the time
The burden from a grain of sand
Was too heavy to withstand

The moment his soul turned cold and jaded
And his will to live had died and gone
The only way out came clear, had to disappear
And lose the dead weight on the ground

The echoes of a dream
Was all that he would be
His puzzled mind could never find
A good reason for his time

He realized too late
We assemble our own fate
It's sad to say, so much easier
To erase than to rewind

Living came to a state
Of merely staying alive
The house of cards caved in
A better deal next time
