Seeing it all, but do we really understand
The consequence of choosing to ignore
Or is it just a paralysing state of mind
No one seems to bother anymore

Still we try to keep our sleeping conscious clean
But doing "right" has never been more wrong

The world will spin for one more day
That's what we pray for anyway
And as the clouds turn dark and grey
We are only chasing the storm away
And it's bound to return

Keep moving on
With no care about the aftermath
Leaving the bill for someone else to pay
The future is not too bright
In fact it's filled with wrath
We turn our heads and look the other way

The world will spin for one more day
That's what we pray for anyway
And as the clouds turn dark and grey
We are only chasing the storm away

You can choose all the winners
But the game is not the same
When the rules don't matter anymore

And the saints and the sinners
They will bow their heads in shame
When the truth come crashing through the door

The world will spin for one more day
That's what we pray for anyway
And as the clouds turn dark and grey
We are only chasing the storm away
And it's bound to return
The world will spin for one more day
But we are only chasing the storm away
