He saw nothing
The night kept its secret well
A storm was raping the sky
A premonition, his reign heading for the end
And there was no time to hide, no

One ship after another they came ashore
A fleet of death and despair
In formation and silence they tread his land
In the name of power and greed

From overseas they'd come
For riches and for might
The Warriors of the Dawn
The Warriors of the Dawn
Killed or enslaved everyone
At first morning light
The king had lost his crown
By his blood they were renown
By his blood they were renown

Without warning
As swiftly as lightning strikes
Another battle begun
In great numbers
Forcing all barricades
Set cities ablaze

From overseas they'd come
For riches and for might
The Warriors of the Dawn
The Warriors of the Dawn
Killed or enslaved everyone
At first morning light
The king had lost his crown
By his blood they were renown

From overseas they'd come
For riches and for might
The Warriors of the Dawn

From overseas they'd come
For riches and for might
The Warriors of the Dawn
The Warriors of the Dawn
Would unleash hell to serve their gods
And bathe in delight
Empires were struck down
By blood they were renown
By blood they were renown

Mountains of silver
And oceans of gold
The fruits of war, irresistible
The slaughter would never end, no
