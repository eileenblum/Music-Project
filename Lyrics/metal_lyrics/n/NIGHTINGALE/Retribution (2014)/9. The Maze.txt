The perfect mind
A math machine
The one to rule them all
Ripping through equations
Like no man had done before

Scientist, anarchist
Born to lead the way
Unveiled the truth behind the numbers
Never seemed to fail

Then it came
Like clouds in the open sky
He could see the bridges burning
Tore him down
Slowly denied him life
Never thought that it would end this way

Lost in the Maze of the Mind
Oh, he's fading away
No, Lost in the Maze of the Mind
A place of fear and dismay

All alone with teary eyes
He stares into the night
Memories are flashing by
And then just disappear

Nevermore to feel the joy
Of when all is adding up
The logic-defying multiplying
Withering away

Night or day
It doesn't matter now
Where he's gone no rules apply

No, Lost in the Maze of the Mind
Oh, he's fading away
No, Lost in the Maze of the Mind
A place of fear and dismay

Sometimes it seem like it would turn around
And maybe his mind found a way
To navigate through this infernal place
And return to the real world again

But thn he caves
Something is string inside
Pulling him right back into the maze

Lost in the Maze of the Mind
Oh, he's fading away
No, Lost in the Maze of the Mind
A place of fear and dismay

Lost in the Maze of the Mind
Now he's lost all control
Oh no, the legend has faded away
The reaper came for his toll
