He was one of the few, when it all began
When creation still was new
With a task to fulfil, to obey and serve
And always follow through

He stayed loyal and true
And then out of the blue
It all just went astray

Something went wrong, just a slip of his tongue
Enough to punish him, sentenced to stay
And to rule in a bottomless hole

Take me at my word when I say
He was given hell to pay

What can he ever do to leave that place
Forever be free, abandon his throne
When will he hear the words:
"Just let it go. It's over and done.
It's time to come home"

Hopes they can hear all the cries
From the souls he has gathered there.
They're feeding the fire
But why does he still feel so cold?

Waiting here for aeons of time
Waiting to redeem his crime

What can he ever do to leave this place
Forever be free, abandon his throne
When will he hear the words:
"Just let it go. It's over and done.
It's time to come home"
It's time to come home

In his dreams he travels back again
To the time when they could talk
When no one ever called him Morningstar
Who's descending to the dark

The only time he dared to speak his mind
And to question what was planned
The servant from the early dawn of time
Now inferior to man

He never wanted it to go this far
But he refused to be replaced
He knows he never can come back again
He's still falling away from grace
He'll never come home again...

Falling, still falling away from grace
Oh, he's still falling away
Falling, still falling away from grace
He has fallen from grace

Take me at my word when I say
He was given hell to pay

What must I ever do to leave this place
Forever be free, abandon my throne
When will I hear you say:
"Just let it go. It's over and done.
It's time to come home"
