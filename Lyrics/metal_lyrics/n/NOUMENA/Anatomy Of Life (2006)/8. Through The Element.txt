In another place or time the sound will play forevermore
The one with magic in name is deep down and stuck there to the core
Can not see all this wanton misery
Through the night of shades, through the doom

The echoes of place and time carry the voices evermore
The one with tears in eyes is stuck here, but deep down in the core
None to see but this wanton elegy
Through the silver tears, through the wounds

The sound of place and time
Echoes in chambers nevermore
The one with wounds too deep
Is broken and cast out to the core
A wanton deep for this wanton elegy
Through the element, to the core

Forever in disguise this chosen place and time
While all was aligned one shed the tears for life
