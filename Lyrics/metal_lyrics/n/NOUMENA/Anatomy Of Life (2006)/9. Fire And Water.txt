Earth bound to fire
Fire bound to earth
Matter and substance forlorn in mortal word
I am immortal, I am the one
I am the soul in reign
I am the one enslaved beyond decay

Life turned to death
Truth turned to lie
Crumbled the mortal order beyond life

Life bound to death
Truth bound to lie
Crumbled the mortal order, man-made lie

Fire and water
Creation and decay
A moment of chance
A moment of cause
When life is torn away

Fire and water
Symptoms without a cause
Polar to death as polar to life
Symptoms define the cause for life

Water bound to fire
Fire bound to water
Matter and substance forlorn in another

I am the wisdom, I am the cause
I am as whole in pain
I am the one enthroned beyond decay

Hope with me for this to suffocate now
It is time, it is right
It is everything
Hope with me for this to suffocate
Die, die, die
And born out of fire
