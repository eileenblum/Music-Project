Breathing, breathing
This morning still shadows the night
Hiding, hiding so long behind the mask of the lies

From depths of the fire this water was born

A moment of hope
A moment of truth
A moment of all that we stand for

From depths of the fire this water was born

This moment, bygone, still echoes the time
The time when this water was pure
This moment, bygone, turned earth against earth
All lives turned to matter from mind

From depths of the fire this water was born

Find
A moment of hope
A moment of truth
A moment of all that we stand for
