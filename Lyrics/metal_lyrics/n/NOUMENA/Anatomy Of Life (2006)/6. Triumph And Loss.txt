Putrid and foul
Gone and wasted inside out
Putrid and foul
Gone and wasted

This is an apocryphon

Concealed inside me
Concealed inside, a scenery
Concealed inside me
Concealed inside, a scenery

Concealed for the very first time
Concealed inside, for a reason why
Concealed for ages to come
This scenery of triumph and loss

Regret, remorse
This is hatred inside out
Regret, remorse
This is hatred outside in

This is an apocryphon
