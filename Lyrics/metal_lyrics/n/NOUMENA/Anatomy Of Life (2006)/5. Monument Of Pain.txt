Since the beginning we have stumbled in scattered ashes
Since the beginning we have buried justice in mass graves

Lest we forget the past
Build once more a sinister monument of pain
Lest we forget
Build once more this sinister monument of pain

Legacy binding us
To fulfil our nature of the beast
Legacy binding us
To unveil the bleakness in our deeds

Since the beginning we have followed
the heart of darkness
Since the beginning we have sworn
by horror and cruelty

It dwells deep inside
Under the fragile surface
Awaiting with teeth bared
In the darkest of corners
