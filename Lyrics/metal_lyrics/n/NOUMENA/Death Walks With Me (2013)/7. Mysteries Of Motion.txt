Oh, the travesty of life
Perpetual carnal flame rendered motionless
Unleash the fateful might
The essence that holds the stars in place

[Chorus:]
With grace, Iâll enter your realm
Send trembles from afar
Unravel mysteries
With magic in your eyes
Traversing mysteries of motion unveiled

Oh, the dance of the flames
Struggling on the verge of consciousness
Aura of burning flesh
The innocence so pleasantly defiled

[Chorus]

Unravel mysteries
With magic in your eyes

[Mandolin solo: Lamminaho]
[Guitar solo: Tuomela]

Oh, how jaded I am
Oh, how torn is flesh, so motionless
Again and again
I will defy fate, ignite the flame

[Chorus]
