Whatever place called home
Is a dwelling of those
Since the dawning of the ages

Burned in one soul, the wisdom untold
Of the concept of reality
That slowly fades away into dark

[Chorus:]
Within the elements of sleep
A veil beneath the waters deep
Within the dreamless sleep awaits
Twilight of the everflowing rain

In lifeblood will fall, so weary of it all
The one without the azure skies

Sensation and the awe
Of silence, nothing more
The sound of night, a lullaby
That slowly fades away into dark

[Chorus]

Sleep, sleep, sleep in silence
Underneath the sky
Free from sin and broken will
A timeless lullaby

In dream you tell me
Always let your fate to make you fall
Into the heart of mankind
Where there is no pain at all

Sleep, sleep, sleep in silence
Underneath the sky
Sleep, sleep, sleep in silence
A timeless lullaby
