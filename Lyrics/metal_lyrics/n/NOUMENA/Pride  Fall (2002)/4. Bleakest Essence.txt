Seek the truth from my eyes
Can you see into the depths of my soul?
Can you see the eternal sin?
The morning embracing the sunset

Hold your tears in my heart
Lay my arms enchanted tonight
Enslave your dreams to seek
For the throes of the nothingness

Lament your sorrows The throes of the sunset
To chase the moonlight from the darkest deception
Forever to capture the autumn rain
To enthrall your bleakest essence with tears

My soul is torn apart
From the presence of your everything
My heart bleeds forever
For the remnants of yesterday
Seek the truth from my eyes
Can you see into the depths of my heart?
Can you see infinite grief?
The morning embracing the sunset

Seek the truth from my heart to approach the darker reality
Seek the truth in my eyes, see the remnants of yesterday
