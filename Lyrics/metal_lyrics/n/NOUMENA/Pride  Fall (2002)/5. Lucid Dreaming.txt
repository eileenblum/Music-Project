For the fragile one I will encrypt my thoughts
The sinner's tears enthralled by wild agonies
The inner deception, betrayal of dawn
In the gloom's paradise you will inherit my scars
A wound of mankind, a spirit in blood,
The unfamiliar guest beneath the masquarade
Fight for me to dim the daylight,
To suffocate the sun, to justify your needs

Underneath the inner deception
I can reach your soul, I can reach your heart
Underneath the tranquil masquarade
There's a storm inside enslaved to darken the light

And in the end I have the universe in my hands
And in the end I have to realize that I'm not immortal
Before the night I have to dream my sorrows away
Will I see the dawn again after the bleakest night?

Can you feel the pain? The cancer grows inside you
Can you bleed the pain? The morning breaks your heart
Can you seek yourself? Will you ever grasp the pain?
Can you separate yourself from the lucid dreaming?

Why can't you be immortal?
Why can't you betray your life?
Why can't you believe the fame
Of inner deception, of inner pain?
