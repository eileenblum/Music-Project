The oath sworn by the faithful
Decades of decayed thoughts, false belief
Crushed by one man with the sword of word
The chosen one is yet to be come...

Worship the messenger of the true god
And the pain, which flows from heavens
Hark the messenger of the messiah
And the punishment, final burning

Masquerade has been going on for
Too long, time to tear off disguise
The apostate crawling amongst the orthodox
In wait to swallow the fallen souls of ours

Archtype sunken into our existence
Archtype devours entire common sense

The legions of the hallowed land
Will follow the truth and holy light
The saviour invincible in jihad
Will you raise your voice in favour of messiah?
