A real of the dark hemisphere
They signed us here for life
Enchained us, tore away our pride
No will to resist, no will to exist

Experimenting with these newly born
A little game with the insane
Rolling back the time for centuries
Make us live and die like our fathers

Harvest the damned, reap the bleak
Bring here for us to bear
Enchanted simplicity
For a mind, so blind, so open to find

This mere bliss, sheer emotion
They call this fate
Sincere, unreal devotion
Controls this mind
Blanks out this anger

Inner peace, enchains me
Entities fall off from the timeline
Burning will, storms there still, suffocated thrill
Subconscious ravishment
