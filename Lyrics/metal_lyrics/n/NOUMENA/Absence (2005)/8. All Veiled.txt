All veiled in same silence
All wonders in same equation
Forever disequilibrium holds
The pulse of our existence will fade

Illusions over matter and mind
A dream is a dream, no more
Straight lines and circles of time
Ignore other forms of continuum

Truth was never more than a one view of the world
Lies, history's scars are too deep

Lost souls of millions I bear
Lost thoughts of aeons I hear
More questions than there were answers
Our paths cross on an unknown shore

All veiled in same silence
All wonders in same equation
Where past, present and future sleep
These fallacies will never die

I believe what I see
I see what I choose to believe
Where answers I seek
Questions are hidden from me
I'm an illusion of my past
An illusion of mine is my future
The end is the end
The end is where I begin
