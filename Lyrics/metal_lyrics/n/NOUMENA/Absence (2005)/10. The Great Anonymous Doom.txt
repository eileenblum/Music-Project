I've waited for this night in shame
They say, it's the grace
Of the great anonymous doom
Don't help me, I'm not falling yet
For woe, I won't forego
The moment of great anonymous doom

Still awake, it may take all day
So silent and slow, like infinite flow
The fuel of great anonymous doom

Not for me a wish
For hope or for mirth
I long to be tied in a coil of rebirth
Absent and pale
In black-eyed night
I'd hate to be wrapped in a veil of delight

Once I leave
In graceful flames, I long to be burned
Once all leave
Once when I leave, I never return

In a dream that flies over the darkest lullabies
This was my fate, a wish to sedate
In presence of great anonymous doom
My wish, was to be just like this
A dark distant shade that lingers, delays
In coming of great anonymous doom
