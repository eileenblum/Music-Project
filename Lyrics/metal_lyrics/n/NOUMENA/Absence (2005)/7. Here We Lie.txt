Morning bleeds me pale
Words feel so numb
I'm frozen in a place of time
I'm stuck to where I left

A modest wish has come true
A thought I never meant
For a light that was so bright
The night sets forever

Turn your face towards the one that's deranged
Tell me the truth, I'm not here
For a light that was so bright
The night sets forever

So jaded, I am here
And again, filled with grief
For a light that was so bright
The night sets forever

In my chamber of liquid dreams
The one I feel, the one I beseech
Hunt for life for a non-divine
The anguish leads to the world I entreat

Here we lie in silent breeze
In this vault it makes me feel
How my world is shred by grief
How this thing just should not be
