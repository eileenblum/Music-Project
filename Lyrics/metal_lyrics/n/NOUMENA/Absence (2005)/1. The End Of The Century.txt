I take a deep dive
Plunge into downward spiral
I am after virtue
Once again, after virtue still alive

Shades of existence
can't quench my thirst, my burning thirst
The Worst pain will never,
Ever vanish from this insane world

Will, power and pride
Kill my frailty inside
Silence futile words
Darken fearful eyes

I choose my side, yield myself to the beast
Or to immortality, nihil, vancancy

The world is declining, crumbling down to the ground
Wormwood delusions torment me in the end of the century
The world is declining, sinking low below the edge
Breeding offspring of lunacy in the end of the century

I tear apart the canvas
The final triumph of my creation
The ecstasy of decay
I am wriggling on the filthy floor

Trance of addiction
I must obey my muse, my frantic muse
They abuse my weakness
The make me shed my soul once more

Everything is losing away it's meaning here
Everything is fading away like you and me
Just burn out, just die down, slip off yourself
Fall of the West, fall of this unearned dignity
