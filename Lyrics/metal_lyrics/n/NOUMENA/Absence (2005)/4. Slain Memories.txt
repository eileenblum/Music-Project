He came by the shore
From dark, so sick so frail
In gloom of his eyes
The fear he couldn't restrain

I'll try to capture the feeling
I'm feeling inside
I won't hide it
I'm second to none

I want to enter my pain
My slain memories
My final atrocity
I'm second to none

As time has passed by
No trust, no place for relief
I will adopt my fate
My desire was more than this

Falling into infinity
This is, who I, this is who I am

Washed by the waves
Embraced by the infinite sea
Nevermore, the darkest deed
For the one once beside me
