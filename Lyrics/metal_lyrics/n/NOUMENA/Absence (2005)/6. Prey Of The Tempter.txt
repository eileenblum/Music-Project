Woes of mankind, too dark to desire
Breathe the fumes of death and decay
It all depends on when everything ends

Enter this place
Enter disgrace
Enter this void, this forgotten soil
No one will ever leave

Tempts me, tempts you, chains us deep inside
Like one of our kin
Throw your hope to the flames that are burning bright
Be damned within
Come dwell where forgotten redeem their price
Slaves so sickening
Step in, to an endless pyre
Our blood becomes thin

Hark at old man, his appealing words
For there lies the truth forevermore
Poisonous, full of deceit
He will cloud the reason of us all

Promised myself, deceived myself
I am prey of the Tempter
Waiting in this ancient inn, in this very room
I am prey of the Tempter
