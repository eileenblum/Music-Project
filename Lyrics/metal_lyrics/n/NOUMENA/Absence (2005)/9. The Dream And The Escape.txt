My heart devours the emptiness
This lonely need from deep within
To breach through these decadent dreams
My heart yearns for a step astray
For an escape, perfect deceive
To break through these elegant needs

I am crawling before thy grace
Leave me to die alone
I am cringing before thy tears
Leave me to thrive in pain

This fateful essence
All life's adornments
Too distant from this realm
Absent from this world

So let us stray
Enter dream, escape
Lull ourselves into oblivion
And let us wait
For a serene day
Lead ourselves into delirium

I deny this fateful coil forevermore
