Hey, above the mountain, hey, above the valley!
Hey, above the mountain the sun rises up.
High in the sky, in the blazing solar ship,
The son of our pagan god drifts across the heavenly waves

Brother Moon, Mother Kolyada,
Sisters of Sunrise and Sunset
Hey, Kolyada, my shinning mother
My blood flows for you!

Brothers of Blood, Brothers of Rin
Enough to live in a lie!
Let's outcast the Chirst from our homes
Across the whole Ukraine!

Hey, Kolyada, shinning mother,
Hey, Kolyada!
Hey, Kolyada, mother of the Sun
Hey, Kolyada!

Sisters of Sunrise and Sunset
Hey, Kolyada, my shinning mother
My blood flows for you!

Ukraine - You're my song,
Eternal is my love.
Without pity, I would give my life
For you, my native land

The ways of ancestors we've striden through ages,
Water from Ra we brought to our Sacred Dnepr
With mighty Thundergod, with blazing ruler of the Sun,
With great Allfather and furious God of the Wind

This is your Home
This is your Land
These are your Gods
This is your life
