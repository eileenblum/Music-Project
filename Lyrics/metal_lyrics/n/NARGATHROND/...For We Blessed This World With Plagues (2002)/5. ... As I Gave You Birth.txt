My precious child,
Won't you (finally) grant me your love
My dearest treasure,
Won't you (finally) please my desire

Living and lying
Crying out for you
Where were you?
Where was your sacredness?

Take my fault (heartlessly)
And set me free
Take my fault (heartlessly)
And set me free

Take my fault - stay away
Set me free - burn these chains
Take my fault - stay away
Set me free - burn these chains

My precious child,
Won't you (finally) grant me your love
My dearest treasure,
Won't you (finally) please my desire

Living and lying
Crying out for you
Where were you?
Where was your sacredness?
