What can I do for myself
Couldn't I change my life
And start it all over again?
Couldn't you just walk away?

Blessed is this world with plagues
Named my love, your hate
Blessed is this world with plagues
Named you and me

Can't find the way
Burning you, as I cease
Can't chase your stare
Burning me, as you leave

Blessed is this world with plagues
We brought forth the light
Blessed is this world with plagues
Abandoning each and every thing

What can I do for myself
If there's not really much to do
A new life, a new beginning
... our most common failure

Can't find the way
Burning you, as I cease
Can't chase your stare
Burning me, as you leave
