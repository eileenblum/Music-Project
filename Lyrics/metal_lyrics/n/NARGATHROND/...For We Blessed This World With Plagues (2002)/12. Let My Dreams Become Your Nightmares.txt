Let my dreams become your nightmares,
Let my words become your sweetest rhyme...
Let me spill your blood, the one who dares!
Let me come forth and ruin your time...

To bring our swords upon the light
To bring my lust towards your sight
To bring our flames upon the night
To bring my hate towards mankind

The time has come for me to take command
And my dreams to come true into this world...
The time has come for hatred to expand
And my love to be transformed into the cold...

Let my dreams become your dreams,
Let my dreams become your sweetest pain,
Let my dreams become your dreams
Let my dreams become your darkest fantasy

To bring our lust upon the light
To bring my sword towards your sight
To bring our hate towards mankind
To bring my flame upon the night...
