Didn't you know what and who I am?
Don't you fear me, don't you fear the reaper
I am your first and only love
I am the one to grant you flowers

Don't you fear me
Don't you fear the reaper
Don't you fear me
Don't you fear the reaper

Have you forgotten everything...?
How could you,
How could you leave me be (alone)...?
Have you condemned our sacred memories...?

No one, but me
No one, but you
Graven in a shining bed -
Isn't a tremendous death?

Are you ready to be my lover?
Are you the one I know?
Are you ready to be my loss?
Are you the one I... slain?

Have you forgotten everything...?
How could you,
How could you leave me be, alone...?
Have you condemned this sacred memory...?

Don't you fear me
Don't you fear the reaper
Don't you fear me
Don't you fear the reaper
