Come nearer, let me look at you!
Absorb me, devour me, perish me!
Rise from within, the unbound shade!
Tempt me, caress me, dream in me!

(I bet you know), immortal is not my flesh
... and nor is yours...
(I bet you know), forever we are not
... none and no one...

Aren't you in fear?
Aren't you... my dear?

Dive in, and beyond!
Transintegrate, emerge and go away!
Come out from oblivion!
Fly away, forget and...
Die at last!
