Deep beneath the darkest sea
We pledged our hearts in silence
Hoping not someone would turn us loose
We embarked on a zero path
Which has been long time lost

Making love in godforsaken halls
Of marble, blood and ice
Giving birth to a sacred one
Amongst the blissful silhouettes

Will our child grant us rebirth
... as darkness sweeps all over the place
Will this spawn of ours be a true-born conqueror
... as pain sweeps all over...

Deep beneath the darkest sea
We pledged our hearts in silence
Hoping not someone would turn us loose
We embarked on a zero path
Which has been long time lost

Will our child grant us rebirth
... as darkness sweeps all over the place
Will this spawn of ours be a true-born conqueror
... as pain sweeps all over...

As pain sweeps all over you and me...
