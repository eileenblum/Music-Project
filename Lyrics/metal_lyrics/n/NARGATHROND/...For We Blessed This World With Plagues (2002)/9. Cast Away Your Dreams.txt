No more dreams and no more fears
No more laughs and no more tears
Now leave your human shape
And let yourself be sweetly raped

No more torture and no more pain
No more ecstasy and no more gain
Now leave this mortal earth
And let yourself be darkly mirthed

Cast away all the dreams you had
Enter me and leave the day behind
Cast away all the dreams you had
Exit me and join the night

No more dreams and no more fears
No more laughs and no more tears
Now leave your human shape
And let yourself be sweetly raped

Cast away all the dreams you had
Enter me and leave the day behind
Cast away all the dreams you had
Exit me and join the night
Exit me and join the night
Exit me and join the night
Exit me and join the night
Exit me and join the night

Look at me and tell me who you see
Is I'm the one still dwelling in your memory?
Rise above, float nearby the highest mountain
Are you the one I still recall?

Die, and become!
Cry out helplessly
Die, and become... my long-awaited bride!
Cry out helplessly, as you're now by my side

Cast away all the dreams you had
Enter me and leave the day behind
Cast away all the dreams you had
Exit me and join the night
Exit me and join the night
Exit me and join the night
Exit me and join the night
Exit me and join the night
