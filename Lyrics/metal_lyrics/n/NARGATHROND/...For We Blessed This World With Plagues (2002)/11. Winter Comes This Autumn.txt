Winter comes in autumn
Winds're blowing right through your face
Seasons change the way we knew not of
... whilst this one comes at night

Winter comes in autumn
Winds're blowing right through your face
Like it has never been before
... whilst seasons change with time

Winter comes in autumn
Winds're blowing right through your face
Seasons change the way we knew not of
... whilst this one comes at night

Winter comes in autumn
Winds're blowing right through your face
Like it has never been before
... whilst seasons change with time

These storms we painted in bloodred
They soar in mangling emptiness
(Moaning and) loathing in a harmful way
They keep on killing me
