[War General:] âThe war is not stalemated. We will keep fighting, week by week, month by month.â

Sounds of distant aircraft get louder and louder an louder
Massacre of innocence
Men, women and children flee from the open in search of safety.
A woman breaks down and cries
Her child is left playing in the street.
