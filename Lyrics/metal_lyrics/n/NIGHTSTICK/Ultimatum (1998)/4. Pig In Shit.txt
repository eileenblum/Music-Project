Flash a million dollar smile
Begin to speak and all the while
Your actions say youâre filled with rage
Youâre counting lives like coins backstage

Oh, youâre happy as a pig in shit
Oh, youâre happy as a pig in shit
Oh, youâre happy as a pig in shit
A pig in shit!

But really youâve a grand design
Of mudslinging to undermine
opinions of any of those
potential foes who might oppose
the master plan. We must preserve
the privileges which we deserve

American prosperity
Forever for posterity
Thick as thieves, sly as a fox
Right as rain and hard as rock
Colder than a witchâs tit
Happy as a pig in shit!
