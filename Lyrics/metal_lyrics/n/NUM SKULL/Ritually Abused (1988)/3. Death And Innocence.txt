[Act I]

Executed for something that you've never done
Your life has barely even just begun
You swear every last one would pay
You promise to return from the Grave
As a man of religion you will die
But the promise of God is lies
Your faith was given all in vain
Hope - mere illusion in your brain
Free from grace of Holy Rest
Absolute nocturnal death
Soon lie in the grave awaiting those to be repaid

The trial - how long you have waited for this day
Guilt is what you hope they won't say
But luck forgot your name this day!

Sent to Death
Die
No delay

Now in your grave you rot, deep inside your cemetary plot
Your epitaph spells out lies, as a friend looks down and cries
Break the brace of certain death, return from your eternal rest
Strike out from your very grace, soon they all will be repaid

As you rot awaiting your great transition
Patience is a virtue in this plight
Hell's price for rebirth and reprisal
Long awaited
Many Full Moon nights

[Act II]

Now the time has ended, your corpse has fallen to dust
Your Blessed Death the jury's invitation
For you're falsified unjust
Now you'll gain the satisfaction of your unrelenting thirst
But the Hell that's expected now a violence getting worse

[Act III]

My soul is reborn with hatred and scorn
For vengeance of death and not prison
Beware of my toll I'll torture your soul
From the Black of Hell I have risen

The jurors die in cold blood in their bed
For the verdict that left me dead
And for the lawyer the went unsaid
A pathetic man from Havard now dead
The judge will be torn at his seams
For the hammer that smashed my dreams
Now they're all here in Hell
They learned a lesson I can tell

[Act IV]

Free from all the misery, I killed those who sentenced me
Sent to die at twenty-three, now I roam the fiery sea
A case with no evidence ends in Death an Innocence
Easy people are misled
Soon victims of Undead
