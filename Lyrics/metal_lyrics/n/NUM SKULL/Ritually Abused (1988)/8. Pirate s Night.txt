Cannon balls are waiting - heavy, hard, and black
Waiting for the time, in which we will attack

Jolly Roger is flying high, seeks you like a scout
Treasure, death, and piracy is what we're all about

We climb abroad your ship to penetrate your neck
To leave you in the blood spilled across the deck

And if we let you live you'll have to walk the plank
You know you can't survive this homicidial prank

With vultures above and serpents below
Out on the high seas there is no place to go
It's Pirate's Night, Pirate's Night
They're out to kill, they set sail tonight

We'll sail up the coast to rip a little more
And leave behind the helpless ships
To coat the ocean's floor
Blackbird and Captain Hook
A few that keep the faith!
We all stand together
Though each other we hate
With the heavens above and Hell below
We still pledge to kill, to rape and to rogue
