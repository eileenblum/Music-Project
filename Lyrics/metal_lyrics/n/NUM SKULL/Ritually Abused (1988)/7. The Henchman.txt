I was born "The Master of Death", creation of Hell
"Lucifer's Breath"
Sent to kill drifting through time, entering souls
controlling their minds

I killed the King, I shot the Pope
I raped your wife and then make her choke
Once as a priest I killed a goat
Now in the night I cut your fucking throat!

Day after day, year after year
Breeding the dead, the reason I am here
I never die - I'm Death it selves
I fill the ground and I fill the shelves

Electric chair - I pulled the switch
And in the past I drowned a Witch
I killed the Jews they threw in a ditch
I put the dead into their crypt

I stalk you/I hunt you/I chase you/I rape you!
I shoot you/I choke you/I stab you/I burn you!
I beat you/I axe you/I drowm you/I chop you!
They bleed as they plead as they cry and then die!
