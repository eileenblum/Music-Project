There was a man who had a plan that took a bit of wit
He took the earth, made human birth
And left it all to sit
With just one guide he's set asidein which we were to learn
To choose his path or feel his wrath and go to Hell and burn!

We all believe in this way
Believing that we should all pray
Life slips away
No more beliefs
As violence and death comes our way

Its all the same, quite like a game but not upon a board
A complex one, not for fun - created by the Lord
You cannot win by choosing sin kwoning Hell awaits
Just sing his song and play until you reach the Gate

Such a struggle always trouble, not what you'd been taugh
Turn to sin and soon begin to loose your train of thought
Now to you, nothing true - you've lost your sense of care
And now the game is not the same and was never even fair
