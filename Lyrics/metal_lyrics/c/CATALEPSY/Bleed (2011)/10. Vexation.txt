He stands alone
Portraying a picture that's comfortable
But inside his mind, the only way to stay sane
Is to leave everyone else behind
He wallows in pain
Hoping his last few nights were just a dream
Yet he can't shake the fact, that his life is lost
And it is never coming back

He falls to his knees
What have they done, he pleads (what have they done)
"Everything I loved
You've taken from me"
How can he go on
When all he hears are his family's screams

Pick yourself up

He drags his feet to nowhere
Hoping death will find him
He knows there's nothing for him here
He drags his feet to nowhere
All he wants is to be with them again
