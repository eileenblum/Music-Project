And it begins
The vicious cycle
Eye for an eye
Leaves the world bounded by vigilance
We're all gonna die
Because we refuse to turn the other cheek
Survival is hopeless
When the ground crumbles beneath your feet
Running is pointless

We are all accomplishes to our own murders
If we don't demand the truth then blood is on our hands

When they push the button
The blood is on our hands

These infernal waves wash us away
The tide has come to purify
Be not afraid

Somethings got to give
Before there's nothing left in this world for us to take
We take this life for granted, day by day
If we don't learn from our mistakes, then we will fall away

Caught in this downward spiral
There is nothing that the human race can do
To stop the hate-filled fires
Sparked by the ones they consume

These infernal waves wash us away
The tide has come to purify
Be not afraid
