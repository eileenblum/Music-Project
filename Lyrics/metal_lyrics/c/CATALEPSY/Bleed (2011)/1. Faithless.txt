We are the light in the dark
In a world where the blind lead the blind
You're the infected spreading the disease
Open your eyes. Reason is the vaccine

You follow the leader
A false figure
Searching for hope
When you know that no one lives forever
Know that we can see through the lies
We are the faithless

Look into my eyes and tell me you believe me
Look me in the eyes and tell me he can save me

We are the faithless (your God is dead)
We are the faithless (your God is dead)
We are the faithless (your God is dead)

You judge us because you fear us
We are the faithless spreading truths of your corrupt disease
We are the faithless and we will not be deceived.
