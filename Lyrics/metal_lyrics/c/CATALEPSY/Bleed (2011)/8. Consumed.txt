There's not one thing you could say
To change the way I feel inside
Clenched fists, closed ups
Pretending things are fine
Hoping it will all fade away
What's done is done
What is there to say?

All the wasted breath
All the wasted time
The clock is ticking away
This time the choice is mine
There's something changing in me
My hate will set me free

I am taking a stand
This is who I am

I am the reason you lock your doors
I am the fear in your eyes
I am the reason you can't sleep at night
I am the winds of change

This is for you. The person I could never be
Bound by restraints
Held hostage by the hate inside of me
There is nothing more to consume
You've destroyed what's left of the good in me
This is for us, what isn't and will never be
I drew the line. I did my time and now I'm free
There is nothing more to consume
You've destroyed what's left of the good in me

You've destroyed the good in me
