I've seen things only the blind can see
Below the surface, waiting impatiently
I've been places you would never want to go
Yet you're there, and it's here and you don't even know
I've seen things only the blind can see
I've seen things you should see, so follow me
So follow me and you'll see

This hell is real
Look deep inside to find that
This hell is real
It breeds in all of us

We will never change
We can't be saved from this hell
So get off your knees
Your whispers in the dark are pointless

This hell is real
I've seen things only the blind can see
This hell is real
I've been places you would never want to go

This hell is real
Look deep inside to find
This hell is real
So follow me and you'll see
This hell is real
It follows us everywhere we go
This hell is real
We will never change
