My obsession with causing torment will be the death of you
You should have listened
So bitch scream murder for me just one more time
You should have kept your distance

I will round up your family
One by one, against the wall
Lie to their face and tell them that it's going to be okay
Or shut your mouth and say nothing at all

I am humanity's savior
In a world overcrowded with the diseased
I am doing the fucking world a favor
This is the cleansing

My obsession with causing torment will be the death of you
You should have listened
So bitch scream murder for me

I should have never taken off my mask
Now I have to kill you all
I am extermination
I am Goliath

In this, your end of days. You've crossed the line from enemy
You became a casualty, but I fear that you will outweigh your losses
I'll tear down the crosses
I'll destroy your faith
Your God
I know it's all that you have

You'll never wake up again
You hear me?
You'll never wake up again
