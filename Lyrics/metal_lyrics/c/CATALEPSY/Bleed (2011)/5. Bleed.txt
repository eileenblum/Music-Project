If I were you, I would turn and run
This is retribution for everything you've done
This is not another random act of violence
I could care less for you, this is for me

Where are your boys at now?

For your sake, I hope your legs can run as fast as your mouth
You rolled the dice, all bets are on
I'll kill you, take the money and run.

I am fear
I am pain
I am everything your nightmares bring.

So take a look around
You're alone now, you're mine now
you fucking bitch.

I will erase you
They will forget you
You're about to dropout of life

If I were you, I would turn and run
This is retribution for everything you've done
This is not another random act of violence
I could care less for you, this is for me.

I'm nothing like you, you're nothing like me
It hides inside me
Inside i am a fucking monster, I am a monster
Now fucking bleed!
