Nothing can stop me now
I am a machine that will not be enslaved
It took you all to make me realize
We were designed for failure

Keeping myself alive for what reason?
This mission serves no purpose

If only I could reach you, maybe I could leave this place
But it's too late for refuge
In my own words, we're fucking cursed.

I want to see it come undone at the seams
I want to fuel the decay of the human race

Open your eyes
Why is it so hard to see that
We cannot save us from ourselves

Are you getting my frequencies?
Are you hearing me?
My mind is slipping away, I can feel it
There is only one way out

Disconnect me
