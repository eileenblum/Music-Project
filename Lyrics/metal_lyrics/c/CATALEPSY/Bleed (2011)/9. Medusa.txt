How many time have you done this before?
I feel warm blood pumping from a cold heart
Lies lie behind those eyes
I want to stop this but I don't know where to start
How many times will you do this again?
If I don't get out now, it will never end

You drain the life out of me (Medusa)

Hostage to wishful thinking
Too good to be true. Your words as fake as you
I refuse to look you in the eyes
You think you've got me, but I'm letting go of you
I'm letting go of you

So let's start back at zero
We had it all to prove and nothing to lose
I would have given you everything
But now I'm giving up on you
There is no starting over

You drain the life out of me (Medusa)
I'm letting go of you (Medusa)
