Absent
In his reveling moment
YOU SCREAM HIS NAME
Hoping you would be answered
Repent your sins
In these last moments of life
If there's a voice to be heard
Where is the voice?

Hope does not exist for you [x2]

But will your faith stay true? [x3]

All you life investing false hope into a book you've misheard
In the end will you stay true to maintaining faith in the one who misheard you
Don't you know your only savior is you? [x4]
