As she drives lay to sleep i hope you choke in your dream
There is no turning back
Can you see what you have done?
I seek vengeance
For your blood
I plot vengeance for blood [x2]

I see broken dreams threw shards of glass [x4]
Ill make you beg
For what you've taken from me
I hope burn alive for all your
fucking lies

I can not be accounted for
The way that you i deal with lies
My thought of your forgiveness is you buried alive
All your hopes and dreams broken shattered by glass [x2]
Shattered by glass
