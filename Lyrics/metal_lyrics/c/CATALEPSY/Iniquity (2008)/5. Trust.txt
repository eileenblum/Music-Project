As she falls to
The feet of a killer

She lies trembling in fear
First she fell to his lies and deception
Now she falls to the ground

All you know your meaning to existence
All your friends and family gone
Down you fall to the feet he will show
No mercy
Battered and broken

She screams murder
And now that this is the end
Your pathetic life
Flashes before
your eyes [x4]

As he drags her
He drags her to
the place where he
Intends to torture
For everything you've caused your
Blamed his misfortune
Every time he hurt he pictures in your face
You'll never make trough his maintaining innocence
And with this forceful action
And your foolishness
Fate has placed you here
In hands of certain death

Your pain your tears relives his disgust
Your pain and your tears
This isn't the end it's now just the beginning

He brings her to terms but consequently
In his actions leads her to bleed
For nothing more than satisfaction

And if you notice a moment of weakness
Run if you can [x2]

You'll never make it out alive [x3]

She screams murder [x2]
