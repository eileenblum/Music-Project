Like a plague
Flooding streets
Is the stench
And blood blood of the innocent [x2]

this is everything, you've
been dreaming of.
they still die
for your benefit

Our friends still die
For debts
You raise.

I'm not standing for
All your fallacies
We're the living proof
Of his treachery [x2]

Your destroyer
Hands soaked
In blood and oil
War lies they cry

Whats the reason for fighting
If there's no fucking end [x2]
