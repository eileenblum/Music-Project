Resistance will result in a massacre
Giving in could spell obliteration

You'll be forced to retreat
And to give up everything
If that's what he wants then that's what he gets
helpless, your people run and hide
Scatted like ants [x3]

You're fucking done

In this war the lies spread
Through his teeth
I'm not letting this go.
You'll sallow your pride or sallow your tongue

I will not be a pawn to your torment
I cannot be a salve to your laws
But still in the end you remain unquestioned
In your anticipation of the end [x2]

I will rip out your throat [x2]
