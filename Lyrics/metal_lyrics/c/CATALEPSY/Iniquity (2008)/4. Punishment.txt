I can see that you remain
Consumed inside by your mind
I can see everything
That you fucking hide
I see scum
That forms beneath your skin
I see your mask
This is for everything
Disregard the fact
Your ignorance has brought you this on
Now were here watching you regret it
All.

PREPARE TO BURN
PREPARE TO SUFFER
For every word you spoke,
On every line you'll fucking choke.

This is punishment

We see
you're scum
This is
Punishment [x2]

This will not be fast.

For your ignorance
For your selfishness
For your weakness

Admit your weak
Admit your Fucking weak
Admit your worthless and everyone [x2]
