If you're there come forth and show yourself
Why let the millions die and burn in
Hell
Because they don't believe in your so
Called religion
Repent now and drown yourself

I'm still here
Remaining unanswered
The prayers spread
Still stand unheard
I'm not standing and waiting for an answer [x2]
If you says he's real than why can't he hear? [x4]

There's something more, then what you want it to be
There's something more, than what
you said it would be
You take thinner minds mending them
The way you please,
How can i find comfort in a god
That judges me

Get on your fucking knees
Or burn in hell [x2]

This is what they teach your children
They listen and worship your god

This is not the way to worship
To consume the mind of our youth
If he died for your sins
Where the fuck is he now? [x4]
Where the fuck is he now?
