[featuring Shane Mac Gowan on vocals]

True you ride the finest horse I have ever seen,
Standing sixteen, one or two. With eyes wild and green,
And you ride the horse so well, hands light to the touch, 
I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to.

[CHORUS (Two times)]

Ride on, see you, I could never go with you 
No matter how I wanted to.

When you ride in to the night without a trace behind,
Run your claw along my gut one last time.
I turn to face an empty space where once you used to lie,
And look for a spark that lights the night
Through a teardrop in my eye.

[CHORUS]
