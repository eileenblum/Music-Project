Medb; You said you would always be there,
You said you would always care,
You said you would always be there,
You said you would always care,
I was nadve and I was wrong, 
To you, I do not belong!

Ailill; Say what you want to say,
You always try to have your way,
I try to say that things in life are different.
If this is how you feel in your heart,
Then I don't want to be a part,
In anything you say -I won't listen.

Your love redeems my pain, 
But I don't want to feel the shame,
You've tried to pierce my heart,
And you've succeeded.

We know now it could never be,
What we once had was ecstacy,
I can't pretend my soul is not bleeding.
