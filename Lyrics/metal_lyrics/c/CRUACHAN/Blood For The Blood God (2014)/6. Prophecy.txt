A question to you false, deceived fools,
who venerate nothing but a falsehood,
Why do you perpetuate this lie?,
your blind faith will never be understood.

A hateful concept from its inception,
born in a sea of blood and terror,
Yet based on many of my traditions,
perverted, corrupted and broken.

Listen to my word and understand my way,
I will sanctify, I will have my day! â I am risen!

I am as ancient as the earth itself yet veiled in secrecy,
When I rise â mankind will kneel and worship me.

Listen to my word and understand my way,
I will sanctify, I will have my day! â I am risen!
