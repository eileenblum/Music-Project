From Limerick the Vikings came
To the village of the Dal gCais
To rape to pillage and to maim
With Viking sword and Viking axe.

So many lives were lost during this Viking raid
Brian's father fought heroically but fell to a Viking blade
A seed of hatred was planted, the promise of vengeance was strong
"To the Northern invaders of Ireland, leave now! you do not belong"

Brian's brothers were not convinced
They sued for peace at any cost
And formed a pact with Ivar of Limerick
This pact was flawed and would not last.

In the year of our lord â Nine hundred and Sixty Eight
Brian led a raiding party to King Ivar's fortress gate
Then fled towards a forest, Limerick Vikings took the bait
They left the safety of Limerick, they could not foresee their fate.

Three hundred Dal gCais warriors
Faced six hundred Viking men
On the hillside known as Sulcoit
Viking blood would flow again.

Brian's men were ready to unleash a surprise attack
The Vikings were caught off guard, they desperately tried to fall bad
The tangled forest confused them, their wall of shields did fail
A single Viking warrior was no match for a single Gael!

The fighting started late
And lasted through the night
The Dal gCais were victorious
They killed Vikings with such spite!

Brian then went and sacked Limerick
Though little fighting would ensue
The Dal gCais warriors were relentless
Behold the rise of Brian Boru!
