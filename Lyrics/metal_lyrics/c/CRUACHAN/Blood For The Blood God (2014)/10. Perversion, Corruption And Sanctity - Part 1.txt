An evil in our midst that pervades our modern lives
An arbitrary congregation of the lowest form of man
Governed by a doctrine almost two thousand years old
Allowed to fester in our world for far too long!

So many times we hear the stories of their sick and vile crimes
The rape of innocent children, the destruction of their minds
Several decades of abuse have been carried out by some
The pleasant parish priest? the abhorrent raping scum!

And from the Vatican â silence! they turn a blind eye
No condemnation of crimes, accusations they deny!
It's time to make a change, time to call them to account
This corruption can't continue, we have to flush them out.

Our children they are sacred, more so than this church
That needs to disappear, to die out and withdraw
But not before we try them and make them recompense
Do unto others as they would unto you,

And to the leaders of our nations that allow this cancer spread
Who carried out no trials or looked away as the priests fled
You are just as guilty of this sodomy of innocents
Shame on you to let it happen, you should be put to death.

Deliver us from evil so that we may find respite
Grant us peace and let our children see a world that is forthright
Let them be free forever from these sick and aging men
And guarantee this ancient cult will never rise again!
