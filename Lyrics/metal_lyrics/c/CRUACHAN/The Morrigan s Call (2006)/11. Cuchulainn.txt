The Hound of Culann, the Hound of Ulster,
he is of the otherworld.
His father is God, Lugh Lamheada,
his mother Dectire is mortal.

Culann the smith was holding a feast
for the Ard Ri Conchobhar.
His mighty Hound had been unleashed
to guard the fortressâ mighty door.

Setanta arrived late at the gates.
He did not know of Culannâs Hound.
The Hound attacked and met its fate.
It lay there dead upon the ground.

Culann was angered when he learned,
his favourite Hound was no more,
but Setanta swore heâd stay at night
to guard the fortressâ mighty door.

He took up arms on the day,
which Cathbad declared auspicious.
He took up arms on that day,
would become famous but short lived.

On his first battle foray,
he killed the sons of Nechtin Seine.
Also on that fateful day,
he took his first battle frenzy.

His body begins to twist and turn.
His flesh revolves within his skin.
His features turn red one by one
and the slaying then begins.

He returned to Eamhain Macha
and threatened to destroy the town.
The naked women were then brought forth.
He then began to calm down.

He fell in love with Emer.
Her father was appalled.
âNo warrior shall be with her
unless by Domhnall he is called.â

He went to train with Domhnall
and learned from him all that he could.
âYou must go and train with Scathach.â
He bowed his head and said he would.

Having learned the martial arts,
he returned to claim the hand of Emer.
Her father, he quickly refused.
Cuchulainn showed his battle temper.
He entered the fortress
and left many of the warriors dead.
Emerâs father killed himself.
The lovers were made to wed.

Cuchulainn, the Hound of Culann,
Cuchulainn, the Hound of Culann,
Cuchulainn, the Hound of Culann,
he is the son of a God.
Cuchulainn, the Hound of Culann,
Cuchulainn, the Hound of Culann,
Cuchulainn, the Hound of Culann;
serpents and dragons he fought.

Cuchulainn solely defended Ulster
during the mighty war and tain.
When Maeve of Connaught invaded,
he stood his ground despite the pain.
He is called a tragic hero.
With Caladin, his Sword,
he killed his best friend Ferdiad
at the battle of the Ford.

Cuchulainn, the Hound of Culann,

he is the son of a God.
Cuchulainn, the Hound of Culann,
Cuchulainn, the Hound of Culann,
Cuchulainn, the Hound of Culann;
serpents and dragons he fought.

In Cuchulainnâs final fight,
a javelin was thrown at him.
It sliced his belly like a knife
and caused his innards to fall out.

He staggered to a nearby lake,
where he took a final drink.
A raven, who was drinking his blood,
tripped over his intestines.

The hero gave a last great laugh
and tied himself against a stone.
He faced his enemies standing up,
but he knew his life was quickly going.

For three days the foe were scared
until a crow perched on his arm.
An otter began to drink his blood.
âCuchulainn is deadâ, is what they said.
