Maeve was a queen with a passion for war.
She had riches and wealth, but still wanted more.
She wanted the bull that dwelled in Cooley -
a magnificent beast that she longed to see.

The men of Ulster would not concur.
âNo one shall threaten us, certainly not her!â
She gathers her armies she looks to the north.
On the eve of the solstice, the armies march forth.

On the eve of the solstice, the armies march forth.

Maeve is warned by a faerie prophet:
she had a vision of evil, malice and death.
âThis cannot be, as anyone will tell,
the men of Ulster are held by an ancient spell.â

But true this news was and here I will tell why -
Ulsterâs defender was merely a boy.
Cuchulainn was his name; he was free from the curse.
Single combat was arranged and he would fight first.

He slays many soldiers through the day and night.
No matter whom he faces, Cuchulainn wins the fight.
He is watched by The Morrigan, the Goddess of war.
Love grows in her heart as she views from afar.

The combat continues, Cuchulainn kills with spite,
until his old friend Ferdiad enters the fight.
Cuchulainn kills Ferdiad, with a slash of his sword.
He feels sad and angry and will fight no more.

Cuchulainnâs father then rode to the North,
to Eamhain Macha, King Conchobarâs fort.
âMen are being killed, women carried away!â
He called to the warriors who were in disarray.

âMen are being killed, women carried away!â
Their lines are broken, in disarray.

An accident happened and his head was cut off,
but continued to speak and choke and cough.
This spectacle brings Ulster out of its spell;
they go to Cuchulainn and Ulster fights well.

Maeve has been defeated and to Connaught he returns,
but there is a twist to this tale, a very strange turn.
She captured the bull and brought it to Cruachan.
It killed her own bull and in the morning was gone.
