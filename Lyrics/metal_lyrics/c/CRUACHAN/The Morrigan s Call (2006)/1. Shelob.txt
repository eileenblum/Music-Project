A tyrant so evil, so nasty, so vile,
a beast with no mercy or heart.
She will lead you in with a sinister grin,
and then she will tear you apart.

Her fiendish fangs will rip and bite.
Her cruel claws will hold you tight.
This sickly spider will rip your skin
and poison you from within.

Her horrible reign has lasted an age;
yet no one will challenge her rule.
She lives un-checked in her cave of web,
so brutal, malicious and cruel.

But a traveller came from the north one day,
so innocent, caring and kind.
Blind walked the traveller into the cave,
unaware of what he might find.

The beast attacked with all its might.
The traveller ran from its sight.
He pierced the creature, a painful strike,
then ran from the cave in fright.

Now the beast remains in her cave of hate
claiming victims whenever she can,
but not our hero, who came from the north.
Stronger is he since he ran.
