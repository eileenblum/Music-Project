Iâve been the wild rover for manyâs a year,
and Iâve spent all my money on whiskey and beer
and now Iâm returning with gold in great store,
and I never will play the wild rover no more.

And itâs no, nay, never!
No, nay, never, no more
will I play the wild rover.
No, never, no more.

I went to an alehouse I used to frequent
and I told the landlady my money was spent.
I asked her for credit, she answered me âNayâ,
saying âCustom like yours I can have any dayâ.

And itâs no, nay, never!
No, nay, never, no more
will I play the wild rover.
No, never, no more.

I took from my pocket ten sovereigns bright
and the landladyâs eyes opened wide with delight.
She said âI have whiskeys and wines of the best,
and the words that I told you were only in jest.â

And itâs no, nay, never!
No, nay, never, no more
will I play the wild rover.
No, never, no more.

Iâll go home to my parents, tell them what Iâve done,
and Iâll ask them to pardon their prodigal son,
and when they have kissed me, as oft-times before,
I never will play the wild rover no more.

And itâs no, nay, never!
No, nay, never, no more
will I play the wild rover.
No, never, no more.

And itâs no, nay, never!
No, nay, never, no more
will I play the wild rover.
No, never, no more.
