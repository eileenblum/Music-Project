I fall to my knees, I await my death.
A fallen warrior, hear my last breath.
I fought so fierce, I fought with pride.
Now I am just another who died.

Who will care for my child? Who will care for my wife?
I leave them behind at the end of my life.
I long to stay and watch my child grow,
but I am dead and I must go.
