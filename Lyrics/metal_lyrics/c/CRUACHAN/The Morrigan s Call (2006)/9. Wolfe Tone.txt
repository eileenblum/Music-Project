Born in occupied Dublin town, as the sun shone down on tyranny,
Wolfe Tone grew up a privileged man, receiving a Trinity college degree.
He despaired for his fellow countrymen under the rule of the British crown.
When they rose up to claim their land, the British always beat them down.

The society of (united) Irishmen he founded in 1791.
They called for freedom from the crown. They wanted justice to be done.
Outlawed they were for their noble views. Wolfe Tone was exiled from his land.
All talk of freedom and liberty was forbidden and completely banned.

He fought the fight he knew was right.
For liberty he would give his life.
His cause was just, his reasons fair:
to free poor Eireann from despair.

In Paris he got the support he craved: troops and supplies to aid his fight!
The French would help the Irish cause; the flame of hope was burning bright.
But not for long Iâm sad to say, the British knew both where and when.
Their spies had told them all and more; this rebellion failed again!

Peasants armed with farming tools, filled with honour, strength and pride,
faced the might of British steel. Thirty thousand Irish died.
Wolfe Tone was captured. He cut his throat; he used his own kitchen knife.
âAfter such heroic a sacrifice, it is no great effort to add my life.â

He fought the fight he knew was right.
For liberty he would give his life.
His cause was just, his reasons fair:
to free poor Eireann from despair.
