I hear you calling
Your voice so fair
I reach out to touch you
But know you're not there

The summer is ending
Clouds darken the sky
As the rain starts to fall
I weep and I cry

No more can I see you
Now you have passed on
The world seems so lifeless
And cold with you gone

I look at the place
Were we both used to lie
And think of times past
With a tear in my eye
