As I look out across the sea
I stand proud but am I free?
A thousand years have come and gone
I have won, I will go on
Stand firm against the storm
I cannot see it but it will come
And with the ghosts of a million Gaels
I will rise up, I will prevail

You can starve my children
You can kill my fighting man
Take away my right to freedom
And when my back is turned you kill again
You can burn my houses
Take away all that I have known
But the seeds are sown

When the Dane invaded
The held the Gael with a strangle-hold
Until Boru joined to clans
He won the war, re-claimed my lands
My green fields have been stained red
 From the blood of the Irish dead
But with this fire that burns inside
I will always rebel, I will survive

You can starve my children
You can kill my fighting man
Take away my right to freedom
And when my back is turned you kill again
You can burn my houses
Take away all that I have known
But the seeds are sown
