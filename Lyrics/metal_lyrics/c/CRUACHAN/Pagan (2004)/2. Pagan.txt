A scourge on the world from the earliest days
Christ, his church and his sinister ways
Starter of wars, Instigator of crimes
Despoiler of cultures, Destroyer of minds

More people have died in the name of Christ
Than any other in the history of life
You kill all who oppose your perfidious might
A religion of conquest born in black light

Our father who art in heaven
Corruption be thy name
You blind your people with lies
False prophet your only gain
Thy kingdom come and be done
Your time is now at an end
The veil is slowly being lifted
Your past you must try to defend

They prey on our children so young and naive
These pedophile bastards they are a disease
They preach about love, or so I am told
But the love that they practice is twisted and cold
