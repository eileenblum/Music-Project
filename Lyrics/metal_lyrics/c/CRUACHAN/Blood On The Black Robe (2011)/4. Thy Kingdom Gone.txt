Holy man take a look at the world
See the terror that we live with every day
How can you quote from your filthy bible
You're a waste of flesh and bone I say!

I laugh when I see your waning flock
Foolish people led by foolish lies
Constantine did not believe
Now he smiles as your religion dies

I confess to my own God
And to you, my brothers and sisters
That I have lived as I seen fit
In my thoughts and in my words
In what I have done
And in what I have failed to do

I will not ask these characters of myth
These angels and saints
Nor you, my brothers and sisters
To pray for me that farcical God

I believe what I see not what I am told
Your doctrine was written by ancient men
They blindly assumed the world was flat
And it's creator would one day come again

I'm sorry to say your mythology is wrong
And your prayers will never be answered
Those who believe   now need to accept
To this world you are cancer!
