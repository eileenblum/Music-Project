There is a pain inside me
A pain as old as earth
That has outlived civilizations
A primordial anguish so strong
So unforgiving in its innocence
That I would cut it from me.

There is fear inside me
A fear that twists my mind
A vision of what the future holds
For my land, my home, my kin.
A future void of dignity
I would use this fear
As a warning of what may pass
I would use this fear.

There is hatred inside me
That has stemmed from a millennia
of pain, hardship and fear
I have watched my people prosper
And I have watched them turn to dust
I would watch them crawl in filth
I would use this hatred.

"We are ready to die and shall die cheerfully and proudly,
you must not grieve for all of this."

There is evil inside me
I fear its power so strong
I fear as it compels me to hate
A primal energy so powerful
An ancient force flowing in my veins
I am one with malevolence 
And no regret shall come from my deeds
For I am at one with malevolence
