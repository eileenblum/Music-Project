Here I stand, I am naked and bloody,
My fists are clenched and my body is ready.
I grip my sword, I pray to my God,
I touch the Earth, I can feel its life.

My task is clear, to defend my land,
To rally my men, to lead and command.
My strength is hatred for these flaxen men,
Who invade my country again and again!

I am Warrior, ready to fight!
I am Warrior, ready to die!
I am Warrior, noble and true!
I am Warrior, Ceitheirn Abu?

Black is the colour of my heart today,
I see their armies, I hear their cries.
Sailing forth in their mighty ships,
They are not men, they have no pride.

They came to my land in search of spoils,
To take my women, my home, my wealth.
Today we stand, united we fight,
Our Gaelic blades shall now be felt!

I am Warrior, ready to fight!
I am Warrior, ready to die!
I am Warrior, noble and true!
I am Warrior, Ceitheirn Abu?
