All I see each night in dreams
Is a beautiful illusion
A figment of my heart

Haunting me, so close but never there
But I can feel her
My secret counterpart

And she looks like you
That's all I know
How she got there
Really I don't care
Cause she looks like you
She looks like you

Now I see you in front of me
In a men's blue dress shirt and paris jeans

A charcoal coat in modern style
A whistful face and a secret smile

You're the one I see
You're the woman in my dreams

All I wanted deep within my soul
Was someone I could talk to
Someone I could hold
I knew that any day now
I'd see her and I'd know
