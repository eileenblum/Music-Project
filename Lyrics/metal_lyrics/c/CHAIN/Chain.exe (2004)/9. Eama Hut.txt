I lock away that familiar pain in a place so that it's safe and
I put on a face that misleads the ones close to me
Tucked inside treasures of mine sit patiently waiting for the perfect time
My selfish, my kind, my loves, my prides, my pensive side, my secrets rob the heart blind

Over there behind the door are things I love and fear and so much more
Tapping louder than before the more intense the more ignored
The grey is flooded often with those hauntings in percussion
My childish dreams and fantasies keep them under lock and key

Should I let them out to escape the sound?

Where am I gonna go
To flee my sanity
I'm always running
From all the things I keep
Inside
To leave my sanity
I always hiding
From everything in front of me

My Life
Is creeping up on me
I try to hide it from all my friends and family
But why
For all that I see
That beat's still coming through clearly

So tell me what should I do - would you let them out and let em' play through
The song of Lenore, the love and pain that keep my core
Hush, can you hear the pounding
If walls could talk and doors could speak of what they've seen inside of me tucked down deep in the corner of my memory -
Hush, can you hear them coming
Sick of running from the past I will reveal the truth at last to anyone who wants to know this is how my story goes...

Who was watching a wasp when I started thinking
Why can't I be the real me
Here are my faults, they come as I am breathing
Why can't I be the real me
You love what you don't know so now I am asking
Why can't you love - love the real me

I will try to set it free
Release the demons that I keep
It is time to turn the key
Open the door and be the real me
