Assassination, stolen planes an', greed that always sets it off
Religious crimes, guided minds, bombs that drop don't land soft
Name your price and start whatever fight your looking for, it's at your door

Mass extinction, genocide we've all been guilty of these crimes
Domination liberates people are to blame reads a old cardboard sign
I want to look back and see weaker part of me and us better after all those years

None of that all of that can you hear that
All of it none of it learn to see that

Try to fly - broken wings - learn the hard way - suffering
Never try never learn never gonna be ready when it's your turn
Never see the warning signs - I've learned in my life
Never leave the past behind
Letting go - foolish pride - the help I need - denied
Turn away in the middle of a fight just in time
'cause you know that they were right - I've learned in my life
Never leave the past behind

Lines of The Prince and The Republic show warning signs of long ago
But who remembers to ask Plato.
Yeah, forget the books and history's waste
Full speed toward the next mistake
Panic cheers, jello, nikes, Heaven's Gate, comets won't outrun your fate

None of that all of that can you hear that
History wants a piece of you
All of it none of it learn to see that
History just repeats in you

Cultural jeans need a place to survive it's not just a fashion it's about staying alive

Remember your little eyes, little minds soaking knowledge from your fathers voice
Sitting smiling on your grandpa's lap resting on the wisdom that he had
Funny by thirteen you know it all savvy until you fall, just remember what made you trip
Next time how will you handle it

Cultural genes need a place to survive it's not just a fashion it's about staying alive
