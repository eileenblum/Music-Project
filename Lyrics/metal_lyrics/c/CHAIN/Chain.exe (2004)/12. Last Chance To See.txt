I bet you were right
With everything you wrote
And the essence of your words
Is what keeps a mind alive

There were gods and monks and bablefish
But in the end it's you and me
You chose the stars and scary creatures
To show us what we couldn't see

I thought that I knew
I thought I was on top of it all
And I hate that I now understand
That because you've gone away
I missed my
Last Chance to See

After seeing the world
You opened up my eyes
Made me ask where we come from
Gave more meaning to my life

It might be just a number
But now I'm closer to the question
And I will continue searching
For I already know the answer

I wanna understand
'Cause I thought I was on top of it all
But until now I did not comprehend
That because you've gone away
I missed my
Last Chance to See

Dolphins, Rhinos, Kakapos - you had your chance to see
But what about rest of us who had a different dream
I am tempted to use just one word to show you how I feel
Belgium man, yes Belgium - that should be pretty clear

We are all just asking questions
And are happy not to know what the answer is

You used Marvin's, Ford's and Zaphod's life
To show us more about our own
You wrote volumes just between the lines
And I just can't believe you're gone

We are all just asking questions but
You're the one who dared to give us a simple answer

I thought that I knew
I thought I had it all figured out
And I hate that I now understand
That you've been taken away
And I missed my Last Chance to See
I missed my Last Chance to See

Every night
I listen to your voice
And the wisdom in your words
Will always make me smile

I should have known
Should have thought about it more
Should have read between the lines
Should have been on top of it all
And I hate that I now understand
That because you've had to go
I missed my Last Chance to See

I really should have known
Should have asked asked and should have probed
Should have read between the lines
Should have been on top of it all
And I can't stand that I now apprehend
That because you've left the scene
I missed my Last Chance to See
I missed my Last Chance to See
I have missed my Last Chance to See
I have really missed my Last Chance to See
