out of the flames 
burned black from shame 
we rule again 
no need to hide 
the purest pride 
we kill again 
whatever's lost - at any cost 
we claim our ground 
what blood may spill 
the perfect kill 
without a sound 

annihilation's pretty sweet 
our hearts are pure hate 
you can't stop the beat 

the bastard sons / the no. 1 
not of man but pure machine 
the antisoul / the antiblood 
compassion's dead and so are you 
flick the switch - the killing itch 
now watch it burn, burn, burn 
the antisoul / the antiblood 
not of man but pure machine 

with blazing eyes and havoc cries 
we storm the world 
the 13th freeze 
down on your knees 
we crush the world 
our ice cold fear 
the darkest sphere 
so blessed be 
antimatter thru 
connects the crew 
we're your destiny
