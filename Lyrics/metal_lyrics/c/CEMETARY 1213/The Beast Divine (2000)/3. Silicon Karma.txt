the last decision 
just couldn't fail 
in an icebox prison 
too blue to set the sails 
from out of nowhere 
they came around 
then what do you care 
if i'm above or beneath the ground 

it just can't stay the same 
blow it all away 
just can't take more for less 
when you're always dying 

nightmare nirvana 
before my eyes 
silicon karma 
the implants make us high 
chromatic virus 
deep in our hearts 
now who cries for us 
when the whole thing falls apart
