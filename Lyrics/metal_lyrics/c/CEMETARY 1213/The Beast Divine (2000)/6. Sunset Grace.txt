call to remember 
dark december 
falling flat 
sure went down like that 
ain't the way i see it 
ain't nothing 'bout it 
coming down of the ground 
you know it never disappears 
'cause the truth is out there 
now looking back i see 
there's something wrong with me 
all bouncing back again 
from way back then 

let-me-die-alone 
under stick and stone 
let them curse my bones 

call to remember 
that red december 
falling flat 
it was just like that 
as they kept screaming 
and i kept fireing 
one by one 'til there was none 
all 4 one and one 4 all 
watch the mighty start to fall 
and that's the way i see it 
ain't nothing to it 
so pull me down into the ground
