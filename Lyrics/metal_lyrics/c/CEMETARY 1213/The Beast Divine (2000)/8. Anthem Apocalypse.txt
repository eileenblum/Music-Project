burning - i kill on demand 
sweet .16 in my hand 
await the command 
closer - and closer by far 
now i know who you are 
the gemini scar 

this is our world 
this is our time 
grab a gun / come on let's go 
this is our world 
burning bright 
come on let's end it all tonight 

bleeding - a sad sight to see 
pale and down on your knees 
i'll set you free 
fire &amp; flame draw the blood 
leave you dead in the mud 
now where is your god
