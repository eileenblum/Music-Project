my time is gone it's been too long 
ounces to tons i'm not that strong 
the visions bleak / the vision's pale 
a losers streak that's born to fail 
bring it on / bring me down 
scar the face of the clown 
it's a fact / it's a fear 
it's a pact / then it's clear 
come little closer to the ledge 
a midnight waltz at the razors edge 

desire burns again 
all alone and trapped again 
someone get me out of here 
the skies are cold alight 
a millions ways to die tonight 
someone get me out of here 

- someone get me out of here - 

one final sleep / the seconds slip 
to play to keep / one final trip 
the sun burns red / the sun burns wild 
to be free from you - then dying's mild 
bring it on / bring me down 
scar the face of the clown 
it's a fact / it's a fear 
it's a pact / then it's clear 
no turning back / unveil the end 
come down the shack / come let's descend
