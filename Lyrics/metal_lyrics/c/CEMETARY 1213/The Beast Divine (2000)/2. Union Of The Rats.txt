it's always finders keepers 
this moves too slow 
down with the crawly creepers 
what you borrow you owe 

- now here we go - 

set the pace / set the tone 
the stangest thing 
you've ever known 
nothing left to die for 
bitter seed / sour grapes 
the point from where 
there's no escape 
nothing left to die for 

undead &amp; unfamiliar 
they trim the fat 
unlocked &amp; unpeculiar 
we're the union of the rats 

- we're the union of the rats -
