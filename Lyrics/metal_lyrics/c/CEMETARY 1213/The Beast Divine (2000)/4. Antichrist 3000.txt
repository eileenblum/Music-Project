the fury five / dead not alive 
cryogenic speak 
electroshock / the slaughtered flock 
now watch us hit our peak 
one last goodbye / with snipers eyes 
a winning murder smile 
so neatly bound &amp; gagged 
diced / cut up &amp; bagged 
electron burning trial 

we're the guilty ones 
take command / all systems go 
we're the hand of god 
nuclear angels watch us glow 
the radiation kings 
our reign is closer than you know 
the one true clean machine 
pull the plug / all systems go 

so state the case / no interface 
to cover for your loss 
so reconcile with suicide 
in glittery shiny gloss 
resistance whore / 
bitch you ain't that pure 
that virus looks pretty neat 
a prison for the board 
static overload 
the one killer elite
