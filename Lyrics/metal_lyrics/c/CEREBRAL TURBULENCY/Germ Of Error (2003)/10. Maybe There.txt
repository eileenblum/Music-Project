You lie next to me but I feel like you're not here at all
I've known you since childhood but all of a sudden you've changed
Is that even you?
A chill goes up my spine when I look into your eyes
They are so dark, lifeless and dull
I want to help you but I don't know how
Is it still worth it now that you've given up?
Why did it have to happen?
Why you?
I wanted to tell you so much but now I can't because you gave up!
