I must write to not forget it
I must dance to not get stunted
I understood nothing but have been renowned as genius
Glazed windows and shod soles
We embrace but struggle
Our considerations are queer
Who doesn't know it - lies
Who laughs at it - doesn't understand
Who doubts about it - searches for
Beautyful roads paved by shits
Equality wrinkled, not irreversible
Course predetermined, not formed
