I don't want anything from you
Leave me alone!
Let me live my way!
I'm a person like the rest of you
Not dangerous, just different
You turned me into an animal
Trying to make me listen to your rules at all costs
So don't be surprised when something happens
I'm like a timebomb thanks to you!
I wasn't dangerous until you made me this way
