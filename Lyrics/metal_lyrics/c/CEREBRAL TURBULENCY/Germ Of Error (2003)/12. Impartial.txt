Lie or truth that you don't belive in
Pain of desperation
Sadness hidden behind reserved needs
Anger is like hot water
Truth or lie that you rise up yourself
To have pleasure from life
Not thinking on pain
That's hopeless - stays hopeless further on
I am not afraid because I faked it up
Pleasure is like ice
