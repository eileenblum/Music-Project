Sit down and die!
I'm glad you understood your surroundings
Understood and didn't let know
And who will instruct us "the best knowing"?
Wealthy? Bliss? Love?
Suffering? Hardship? Solitude?
Rise and fly up!
I feel your confusion
And who will show the way us "infallible"?
Ambition? Belief? Success?
Desperation? Nothingness? Doubts?
With opened month and closed eyes I burnt my life and stood upside down
Thoughts converted for money and awoke in summer storm
