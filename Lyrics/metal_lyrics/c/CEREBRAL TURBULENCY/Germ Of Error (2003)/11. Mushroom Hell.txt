Where did the light go?
Why is it dark now?
Suddenly it's as quiet as a graveyard not a sound to be heard
How can I hear whistling inside my head?
I don't hear myself speak so where do all the voices come from when I'm silent?
Something's wrong
It was all going smoothly as butter but now there's lard everywhere
What happened?
