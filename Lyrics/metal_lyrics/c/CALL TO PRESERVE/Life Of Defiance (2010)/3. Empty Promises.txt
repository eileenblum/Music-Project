You thought you'd prove them wrong. You thought you were too strong. But everyone that professed their love would pick up and run. And they promised to stay behind under a dark blue sky. Now they've all walked away. Left you waiting in vain.

It's an empty shadow of what... of what it's supposed to mean. But all those words have you chasing what it used to be. What used to feel so real makes you feel... makes you feel so numb and cheap. How much more until your heart stops to beat?

How long can we afford to live this way? They'll keep on lying, taking everything.
Could we afford to trust anyone else? How could we trust ourselves?

Break the cycle. Break the cycle. Break the cycle of giving in. Go...
Break the cycle of giving in. Break the cycle of losing everything.
Break the cycle of giving in. Break the cycle of losing everything.
