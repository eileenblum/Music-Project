Nature plays you for a fool. You've lost all your control. Your mind betrays your body. Your body betrays your soul. No excuse for the ones you use. A slave to attention. Their dependence comforts you. You don't need love, do you? Just a collar to pull. A sleeve to hold on to. No excuse for the ones you use. At the end of the day you're still the same. Everything weighs down on you. Still empty and ashamed. The days stay long and the nights stay dark ...and the nights stay dark.

It leaves you cold and numb. Waiting for something to come. All of this will never change the tightening grip of empty space. It leaves you cold and numb. Waiting for something to come. All of this will never change the tightening grip of empty space. No excuse for the ones you use. At the end of the day you're still the same. Everything weighs down on you. Still empty and ashamed. The days stay long and the nights stay dark.

Still feel the same. You still feel the same. You still feel the same. You still feel the same. It weighs down on you. You can't seem to escape. Through all the lives you use, you still feel the same. You still feel the same. You still feel the same. You still feel the same. You still feel the same.
