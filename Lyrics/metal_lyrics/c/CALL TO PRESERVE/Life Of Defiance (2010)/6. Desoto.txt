I can't stay in this place. Just after four years I can see their eyelids getting heavy. Between the 9 to 5 and the drunken nights, it's just empty promises and empty lives, and everything that held us together is gone. Paved over and forgotten. Paved over and forgotten.

We never even saw it coming till the concrete started closing in. Till the sprawl became the nails in our coffins. Look around. You'll always be one step from getting out. So if you want something better, start running now.

Look around. Look around. Start running now. Start running now. Their prosperity. Our grim reality. The concrete started closing in. The sprawl became the nails in our coffins. Look around. You'll always be one step from getting out. So if you want something better, start running now. Paved over and forgotten. Paved over and forgotten. We never even saw it coming. We never even saw it coming. We never even saw it coming.
