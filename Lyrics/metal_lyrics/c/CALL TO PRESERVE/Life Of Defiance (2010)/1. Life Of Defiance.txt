Waking up from an apathetic life. The last of the malcontent. Won't be held back by a failed cowardice. Won't dig our own graves. Won't dig our own graves. We won't dig our own graves.

Won't sleep in the daylight or abandon the lost in the dark. We'll be the cause of the stir. A return to a life of defiance. Won't sleep in the daylight or abandon the lost in the dark. We'll be the cause of the stir. A return to a life of defiance... a life of defiance.
