My hands hold nothing. There's no place to rest my head. As the long nights turn into sunken eyes and the letdowns turn into regret.

Everything they needed me to be, slips through my fingers. So temporary. But I'll stop and strive to be content in their world of selfishness.

The fear. It kills and it steals. The hate. It leaves them ashamed.

This weight. This weight. It brings men to their knees. Their worthless wealth could never lift it from me. This weight. This weight. It comes to set me free. Leaves me asking. Leaves me praying take everything from me.

So I wait and I wait. It brings me to my knees. One peace. One relief to cure the insatiable greed.

The fear. It kills and it steals. The hate. It leaves them ashamed.

So can I break free from the disease they feed to me. Wake up and walk away. Their wealth could never lift this from me. Walk away. From their disease. Their wealth could never lift this from me. Walk away. From their disease. Their wealth could never lift this from... lift this from me.
