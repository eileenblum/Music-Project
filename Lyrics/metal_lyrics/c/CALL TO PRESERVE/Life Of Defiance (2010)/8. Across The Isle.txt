[feat. Joe Musten of Advent]Could we waste anymore time on this? It's a strange thing to show love with your fist. We screamed until they went deaf. We pushed until they bled. A slave to your politics.

(Won't be a slave). The way they use our God (the way they use our God) to justify a war (to justify) or toe the party line (or toe the party line). The way you play the whore. I won't close my eyes and justify a fight for control. I won't toe your line.

I can't close my eyes. I can't toe your line. I can't close my eyes. I can't toe your line.
