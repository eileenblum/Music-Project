I refuse to be another cog in their machine. I can't take part in your decaying tradition. No love. No heart. A perversion of what you set out to start. Void of a substance. A decaying tradition.

Your need for assimilation attacks the vulnerable. With a heart driven by fear. I won't... I won't participate. A hateful rhetoric disguised as holiness. With a heart filled with fear. I won't... I won't participate... I won't participate. This hatred ends with me...

This hatred ends with me. This hatred ends with me.
This hatred ends with me. This hatred ends with me.

I refuse to be another cog in their machine. I can't take part in your decaying tradition. No love. No heart. A perversion of what you set out to start. Void of a substance. A decaying tradition.
