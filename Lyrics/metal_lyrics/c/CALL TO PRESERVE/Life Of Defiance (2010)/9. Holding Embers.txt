I said I'd never go back again. I'm holding embers in my hands. It was compromise after compromise. I pulled closer and still nothing satisfied. Every attempt to feel something pushes you further away. I can't recognize myself. I became someone else.

I pushed it further than I thought I ever would. The fool. The coward. The shameful son. I pushed it further just to find I lost myself. I became someone else.

Waking up wanting to start again. I'm holding my head in my hands, but the days trail behind. My eyes forever fixed. My gaze forever fixed. Every attempt to feel something, pushes you further away. I can't recognize myself. I became someone else.
