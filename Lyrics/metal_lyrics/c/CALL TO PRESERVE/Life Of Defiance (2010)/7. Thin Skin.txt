So sick of defending myself. Creating a facade for everyone else. We live so guarded you'd never know we're alive. Worried they'd damage what's inside.

After years of being guarded our defenses are wearing thin. Becoming vulnerable to live... to live again. We're coming of age in hostility. We're taught to despise our own skin...

They lie and wait for us. They try and pick us apart, but we're no longer afraid to show our scars. They lie and wait for us. They try and pick us apart, but we're no longer afraid to show our scars.

We're coming of age in hostility, but we won't despise our own skin... our own skin. We're not afraid. We won't be fazed. We won't despise our own skin. We're not afraid. We won't be fazed. We won't despise our own skin.
