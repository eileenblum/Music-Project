You drown yourself in a drink. I'd rather be lost at sea. The constant struggle to breathe. Never the life for me. I don't want to see through the eyes of a hazy mind, or look at the future and blindly... blindly close my eyes. Don't try to say you live your own way.

Don't try to say you're living your life your own way. Won't disconnect from reality. I won't bury my head and suffocate. Lost at sea. You're not living your life your own way.
