I've watched it rot away. Every defense I had fell into decay. I've watched it fall and break. Every defense I had fell into decay.

I'm running out of space for things to say. I'm tired of spending my life lamenting to a page. I'm losing ground. I'm losing sleep. I'm watching the ones I love go where I can't follow. But I know... I know it's all a means to an end. I can't be made to just sit in the dark. Just watch the world pass by and not progress at all. I'm watching the ones I love go where I can't follow. But I know... I know it's all a means to an end.

This is my last look back. A final farewell to the past. Embracing uncertainty. Give and regret nothing. This is my last look back. A final farewell to the past. Embracing uncertainty. Give and regret nothing.

And all these frustrations seem to go unnoticed, unanswered. Just when I start to feel content, everything starts to shift again. So I try to figure out what's the lesson in all this. But I know... I know it's all a means to an end. I can't be made to just sit here in the dark. Just watch the world pass by and not progress at all. But I know... I know it's all a means to an end.

I've watched it rot away. Every defense I had fell into decay. I've watched it fall and break. Every defense I had fell into decay.

This is my last look back. A final farewell to the past. Embracing uncertainty. Give and regret nothing. This is my last look back. A final farewell to the past. Embracing uncertainty. Give and regret nothing. This is... (this is) ...my last look back (my last look back). This is... (this is) ...my last look back (my last look back). This is... (this is) ...my last look back (my last look back).
