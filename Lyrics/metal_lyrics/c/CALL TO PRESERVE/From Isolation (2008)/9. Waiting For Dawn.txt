Push through the night!

Running with all we've got through
Streets with self abandoned
Down highways waiting for dawn
Empty pockets, but we're not poor

Always looking for a brighter sky
Always praying for better times
Don't care about the pain
Don't care about the separation

Wanting to live, but I'm not afraid
We're not afraid to die

Shake off the snares from your mind
You've got to leave those old things behind

Till my candle burns out
When the suffering never seems to end
Before I'm dead, gone, and forgotten
I'm giving all I can

Till my candle burns out
When the suffering never seems to end
Before I'm dead, gone, and forgotten
I'm giving all I can

From the low times we push ahead
From the low times we push ahead
