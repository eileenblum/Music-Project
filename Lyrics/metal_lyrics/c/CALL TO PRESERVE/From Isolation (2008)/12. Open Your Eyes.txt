Look up and open your eyes
See everything you meant to be
Selling yourself short when there's only so far you can see
Though your body is broken,
Your soul remains intact
Finding wholeness in the places that you lack
Look up and see who you are has become so clear
Hold on, for the dawn is drawing near
Clouds of depression are fading away
For what was once dark is light again
Look up and open your eyes
See everything you meant to be
Selling yourself short
When there's only so far you can see
Though your body is broken,
Your soul remains intact
Finding wholeness in the places that you lack
Look up and see who you are has become so clear
Hold on, for the dawn is drawing near
Clouds of depression are fading away
For what was once dark is light again
Let go, let go, and open your eyes
Keep these words with you,
For I make all things new, all things new
Keep these words with you,
For I make all things new
Let go and open your eyes
