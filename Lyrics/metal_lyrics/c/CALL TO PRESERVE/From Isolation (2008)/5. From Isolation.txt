I used to want you notice
The hidden messaged in my sigh
About loss and isolation
You could say it would be my goodbye
I'd sing a song of deep despair just to see if you would
Hear, but no such thing happened
No rescue would come back here

Maybe I'd just quit
And bury my head in the sand
Go out with the tide
And never come back

But at dawn,
I'm seeing now that broken hearts
Don't make you right,
And self pity is comforting,
But you'll let it swallow you alive

Though the pressure's on,
The broken are never on their own
We've come from isolation, but we're never alone
We are never alone
