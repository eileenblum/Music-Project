Just give me a light for my path
Show me the parts of my heart only you can see
Just give me a light for my path
Show me what you see

I've been downtown for far to long
Living wih burn-outs in the filth of the city
Nothing to do, Nowhere to go
Finding out my lonely life isn't so perfect

But even though I don't see it,
You've carved a path in this grid of cobblestone
Even when I've blown my inheritance,
You have the gall to welcome me be back home

I've never been the best at listening
And I've been prone to wander
But even as I walk these streets,
You can still see, You can still see inside my heart

You know I've tried to live this life
With reckless abandon
So forgive these dirty hands,
But I've been digging through the grey

But even though I don't see it,
You've carved a path in this grid of cobblestone
Even when I've blown my inheritance,
You have the gall to welcome me be back home

Just give me a light for my path
Show me the parts of my heart only you can see
Just give me a light for my path
Show me, show me, show me what you see

Just give me a light for my path
Show me, show me, show me what you see
Just give me a light for my path
Show me, show me, show me what you see
