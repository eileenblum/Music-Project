Iâm just trying to better myself.
Iâll leave behind what I donât need, but youâre so quick
To judge when Iâve tried to be accepting.
You think you know my thoughts, but you still think Iâm
Looking down on you.
What else do you want me to do?
I donât think I know whatâs best for you.
This is my choice. Live what is right for me.
This is my voice. Living by what I say.
So much to say about the choices we make.
Always a problem with the words we say.
Iâm not out to change who you are.
Iâm just trying to live my life clean.
But you want to take something positive and turn it into
An argument.
We havenât uttered a word, but already youâre head is
Turned.
Iâve got to do all I can to live a life thatâs free of
Shame.
Iâll be held back by nothing.
Let nothing get in the way. My life. My choice. Iâll be
Held back by nothing.
My life. My choice. Let nothing get in the way.
