What have we become?
Another faceless generation.
Another victim found nameless. Born at the bottom without
A chance.
Let down by our own impulses.
Shut out by our own emotions.
Remnants left in ashes, but now is where it ends. Picked
Up. Picked up from this mess weâre in.
From misery. Hope for the fallen.
A way out for the ones who have spent their lives
Enslaved in chains. Up out of darkness.
Time to start again. So sick of being disconnected, but
Nowâs where it ends.
Picked up. Picked up from this mess weâre in. From
Misery. Hope for the fallen.
A way out for the ones who have spent their lives
Enslaved in chains.
Picked up. Picked up from this mess weâre in.
From Misery. Hope for the fallen.
Itâs time to leave this past. We have been set free.
We were restless minds paralyzed by own doubts, but now
Weâre letting go and now weâre getting out.
Weâre getting out.
