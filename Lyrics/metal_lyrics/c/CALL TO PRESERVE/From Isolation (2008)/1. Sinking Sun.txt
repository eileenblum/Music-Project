Weâve come from isolation but weâre never alone.
When the sun sets on everything you know how will you
Know where to go?
Iâve spent my whole life running and now Iâm left with
Nothing to show.
Now my life ahead looks nothing like how I thought it
Would.
Iâm left behind.
Iâm looking for a future that I canât find.
Not who I thought I could be.
Being held back by my humanity and now my life ahead
Looks nothing like how I pictured it.
But somehow I know itâs always darkest before dawn so I
Look into the black and I keep walking on.
I know thereâs more than what I can see.
Because sometimes youâre the only one searching for
Whatâs real.
There is another way than this.
Thereâs got to be another path than this.
Beyond what I see, beyond those darker days ahead of me.
But somehow I know itâs always darkest before dawn, so I
Look into the black and I keep walking on, because
Sometimes youâre the only one searching for whatâs real.
Sometimes youâre the only one discontent with just living
By how you feel.
