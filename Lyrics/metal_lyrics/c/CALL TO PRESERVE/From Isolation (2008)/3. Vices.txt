We were all born with vices
We've never had control
We've been locked in a battle off ill will and defeated
Soul

We are the eciled
Stuck in our own vices
We walk this desert without end
We are the exiled
Stuck in our own vices
No matter how much we plan,
We come up short

Why my best intentions could be so destructive
Or why my virtue has been drowned out by my own
Selfishness
How can I be so proud and still doubt myself?
How can I be so depressed from acting on my own will?
Because there's been something holding me back

Something keeping me from becoming the person I've
Needed to be
It took me so long to find out why everything
I put my hand to had become a testament to failure

We are the eciled
Stuck in our own vices
We walk this desert without end
We are the exiled
Stuck in our own vices
No matter how much we plan,
We come up short

How can I be so proud and still doubt myself?
How can I be so proud and still doubt myself?
