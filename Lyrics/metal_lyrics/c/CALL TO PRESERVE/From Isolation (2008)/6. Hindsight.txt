Hindsight isn't always 20/20
When you romanticize history
I've been filling in all the gaps
About how things used to be
I'm only better off
'Cause I prefer you the way I remember
I guess "us" sounds better in past tense
The present would never be better

Don't bother me with reality
Just leave me with my own memories
'Cause I know the past can't change,
But nothing ever stays the same
