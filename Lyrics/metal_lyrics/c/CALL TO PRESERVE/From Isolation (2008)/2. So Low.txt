I can't see it your way
I will never see it your way

I've never wanted to dull the pain,
To stop thinking about today
The world may look safer to you
from the bottom of a bottle,
But I've never wanted to ever see it that way

Numbing the body, numbing the mind
It never solved a thing
Rather give up my comfort
Than my ability to think

The world may look safer to you
From the bottom of a bottle,
But I've never wanted to ever see it that way

It's easy to let go
When the world turns on you,
But you will never ever know
What you're able to do

'Cause with progress can only come pain,
So how will you ever learn from your mistakes?
So I can feel the chill in my bones
And I can feel the pain inside,
But at least, at least I know that I'm still alive

But at least I know that I'm still alive
I'm still alive
