[Lyrics: Lord Mystic]

Awaiting the arrival of the impending plague,
The Black Hordes rise to face the growing threat.
Religious vermin, increasing in number, yet vague
And indistinct in appearance. The minds resolutely set
To defy the imminent danger - Blood shall be shed!

The Back Hordes rise - realise false religion's demise
Superior and grand in force - eliminate this sordid source
The Black Hordes behold - mocking the enemy appalled
Total rapture on that day - manifestation of total dismay

Crawling back to their holes as the hordes ruthlessly slay,
Frozen with fear they realise this is their final day
The religions of fear and their dogmas are about to cease,
We are the blunt force cure for this disease

Pity them not, they shall rot

The Back Hordes rise - realise false religion's demise
Superior and grand in force - eliminate this sordid source
The Black Hordes behold - mocking the enemy appalled
Total rapture on that day - manifestation of total dismay

The hypocritical source of belief crushed entirely,
Like the wolf that the obedient sheep slays,
The plague that spreads invisibly but murderously;
Numbered are their days, certain death in many ways
