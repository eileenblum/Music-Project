[Lyrics: Nimroth]

Cataclysmic brutality is spawn upon thee all
When fields of the giant mushrooms will rise
Assassinating the source, will be their final fall
No remorse for these devils in disguise

The source of world's hypocrisy
Spawn by Islam and Christianity
Will be nothing more but a memory
Caused by pure exquisite blasphemy

Their final destination is total annihilation
Creating heavenly sights, exteriorised by hell on earth

Hunt them down and kill them all
Drench this world in a black infernal holocaust
No surrender and no retreat
Our only charge is to defeat!

The source of world's hypocrisy
Spawn by Islam and Christianity
Will be nothing more but a memory
Caused by pure exquisite blasphemy

We are the concubines of Satan
Feasting on your desecration
Your final destination is total annihilation

Another battle is to be fought,
When the black storms are to be awoken
This great void of eternity
Marked with pure exquisite blasphemy
