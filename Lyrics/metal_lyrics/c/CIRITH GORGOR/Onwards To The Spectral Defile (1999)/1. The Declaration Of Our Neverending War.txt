I will have no mercy
For this moslim bane
In my darkest fantasies
They will die in pain

Rulers of the seas, the mountains and the sky
Strong pagan warriors, not afraid to die
Hearts filled with pride and wargods on our side
Recapturing our might, by desecrating Eastern light

Icewinds blowing in your face
Trying to stand my disastrous mace
Unable to stand it anymore
We will win this eternal war!!!
And as we've conquered this world of lies
I speak my freezing incantation
Which turns this world in a world of ice
A world without any ... salvation!

Rulers of the seas, the mountains and the sky
Strong pagan warriors, not afraid to die
Hearts filled with pride and wargods on our side
Recapturing our might, by desecrating Eastern light

Watching those beneath me
Noticing how they struggle
Trying to stand my blasphemy
Avoiding to be trembled
Neverending hate
Against the Eastern enemy
Before it will be too late
And they will spread more misery

Wodan, Odin, god(s) of wisdom
Riding Sleipnir through the sky
Guided by your darkest ravens
Your spirit will never die!
I raise my head to the cold blue sky
Even so I do with my sword
I have the power, I cannot die
This was given to me by the thunderlord!
