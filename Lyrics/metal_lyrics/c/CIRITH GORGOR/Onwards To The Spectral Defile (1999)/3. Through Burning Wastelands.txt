Passing fields where once was joy
They felt the mighty emperor's wrath
Through woods of eternal winter, wolves howl
An everlasting serenade to praise the demonkind

They know who I am, for they are damned for life
Do they know me from a distant past, from ancient times
Or have they seen me in a future in their dreams?

All the innocent will be burned, for I kill and conquer
The snow turns red, the lakes turn black
The skies now stand ablaze and swords
Are raised to hail thee, for thou art back

Now the sun has failed, a waxing moon
Now rules the sky, once ablaze, now grey and cold
Wolves howl day and night, and the weak ones flee
Where is their god as their end is now to see?

All the innocent will be burned, for I kill and conquer
The snow turns red, the lakes turn black
The skies now stand ablaze and swords
Are raised to hail thee, for thou art back

Behold his throne, a majestic shade in the night
Their screams are heard, but there's nothing they can do
For we, stormrulers of the two-horned empire
Now wander eternal and all the lands we rule
