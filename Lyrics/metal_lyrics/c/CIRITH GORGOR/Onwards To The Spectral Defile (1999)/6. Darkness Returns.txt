When the leaves fall from the tree
And the sun shines not as strong as it did before
You can feel the wind is getting colder
The days become shorter, every night

The freezing wind rages through the trees
At this time dark powers unite
We exist to reach our desire
The end of daylight

Darkness has returned...

Lightning in the blackened sky
Black clouds quickly passing by
The moon sometimes appears
Rain falls down like little tears

The summer has disappeared
And winter has returned to earth
Winter's darkness rules every night
The end of daylight

Now the sun is out of sight
Finally darkness has returned
This is what we were waiting for
Our desire, for the dark
