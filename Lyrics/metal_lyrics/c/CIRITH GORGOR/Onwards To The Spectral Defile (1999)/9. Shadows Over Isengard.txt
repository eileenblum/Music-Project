For the dawn in Isengard is sunless
For the day in Isengard is black
For the evening storms roar crimson
As the night falls with a fiery sky

When the words are spoken
The shadow rises from his tomb
A majestic shade over the world
As I grant thee the key and the spell is broken

We proudly stand at the gates of paradise
Until the evening storms roar crimson
And the night falls with a fiery sky

Shadows over Isengard
