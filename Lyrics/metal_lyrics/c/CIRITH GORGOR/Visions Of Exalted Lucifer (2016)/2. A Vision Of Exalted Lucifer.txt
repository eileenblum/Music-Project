â NON SERVIAM â

An earthly life instilled with strength and honour
Long, mind and soul have left this false humanity
Superior soldier raised to fight for blood and soil
Subservient to none until my dying breath

The human race inevitably must perish
A law which keeps me focussed and prepared
Lay waste the lies and lives of all who founder
And slaughter all unworthy and all weak
