Penetrating the cosmic shield
Letting formlessness seep through
Challenging the artificial need for order
Through Chaos achieving ultimate freedom

I am All, All is Nothing
Let Nothingness Reign supreme

I am You, You are Nothing
Through death You will be free

With claws grabbing hold / With talons running deep
Depleting the massive flock / Of mindless docile sheep
With fangs gnawing through / And mighty crushing beak
Weâll diminish the meek / And destroy the weak
