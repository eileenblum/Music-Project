Covered in ashes, drenched in blood / Witness this apocalyptic funeral pyre
Covered in ashes, drenched in blood / Of Gods, kings and vagabonds alike
Covered in ashes, drenched in blood / Keeper of the spark of creation, the blade of flame
Covered in ashes, drenched in blood / Hearken the call of the fabled shrieking horn

âThis is the moment I ride forth, accompanied by my sons of the barren earth
I wield my sword and incinerate all; casting all worlds back before their birthâ

In the chaos of battle shall the heaven be cloven,
and the sons of salvation ride thence:
The Redeemer shall ride first,
and both before and after him burning fire

Redeemer I am called.
For I make the earth shiver,
Empty the oceans on fertile land,
Let the heavens drone,
Resound the horrifying darkness of death!
The star bearing wind I put in motion
With my thunderous call rich with ravenous wrath
And penetrate into the deepest forests
But the minds of young and old I reach
With my steady voice full of malice
