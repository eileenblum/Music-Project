â¦As below, so above

Skin is rupturing, black flesh is oozing out
Hate flowing like pyroclastic energy through my veins
Feeding my dark spirit
While bones slowly whither to dust

...Evolving beyond mere mortal men

My life is now totally spent
Though I relinquish it without remorse
So I perform this last ritual
To cleanse and to purge

Loathing increasing, hate growing
As I strayed further from society
Body dissolving, mind solidified
Black sun gaining critical mass

...Thus my Black Flame ignites

Black Flame lashes out
And takes to the skies
Disembodied yet conscious
As I rise higher and higher

...I rise into the endless void

Leaving this cursed world behind
Determined to become its final bane
As it seems without a fight
For this goes beyond comprehension

Loathing increasing, hate growing
As I strayed further from society
Body dissolving, mind solidified
Black sun gaining critical mass

My spirit reaches critical mass

Generating dark energy on its own
Immense spiritual implosion follows
Producing a monstrous shockwave
Destroying everything in its wake
Like minded entities arise from the ashes
Coagulating into a dense black nebula
