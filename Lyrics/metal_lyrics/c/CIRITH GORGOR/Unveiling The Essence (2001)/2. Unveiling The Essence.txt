[Lyrics: Astaroth Daemonum]

...A starlit path
Leads me to a darker place
Which shall reveal to me its true face
Its mask it wore too long... 

Of grotesque forests and ancient trees
Grinning faces carved in wood
The scars of time mark their shadows
Yet young in an infinite way they stood
Unveiling the essence of majesty and pride
As if it was a strange mist over all land
Which flees with the rays of a new dawn
Still knowing that it will be overruled by a new night 

Is it melancholy that is lurking behind every stone
The subtle embodiment of yearning and death
Overshadowing life like a night so eternal
Causing all meaning to cease, so it seems
Or shaping a new state of perception and dreams 

Craving to dethrone all elements
That in perilous ways hide and cloak
Grinning invincible, darkness impenetrable
Yet drowning in knowing its fate
That once the true essence will be unveiled
...Like the rays of a new dawn 

Yet night is the hunter for all...
