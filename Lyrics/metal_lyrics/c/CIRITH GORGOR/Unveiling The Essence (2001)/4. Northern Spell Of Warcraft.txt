[Lyrics: Nimroth]

Centuries have past
But wars did never last
Banners of war were raised
And will be raised again
An ever-recurring ritual
So malicious, but inevitable 

When the northern spell of ice
Turns skies into a crimson veil
Our blood will crystallize
Spell-bound by a wizard's seal 

Hatred in our eyes
Warcraft never dies
Poisoned world of lies
Our warcraft never dies! 

With chain and axe in hand
Fighting for, where from we descend
Our forces will never last
Equally wars from a distant past 

Infernal legions straight from hell
Spell-bound by the northern spell
Warriors of a black horizon
Fighting until Armageddon 

Hatred in our eyes
Warcraft never dies
Poisoned world of lies
Our warcraft never dies! 

Fires are raging
Armageddon is fought
A new dawn rises
Like the ancient scalds taught
