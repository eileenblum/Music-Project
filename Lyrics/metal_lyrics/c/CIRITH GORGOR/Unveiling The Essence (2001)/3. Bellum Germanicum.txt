[Lyrics: Nimroth]

In memory of the Germanic tribes whose spirit still burns in me, And will never fade
away, hail to thee 

"Bezit sterft, families sterven
Jijzelf zult sterven als zij
Maar Ã©Ã©n ding weet ik, dat eeuwig leeft
De heldenroem van de dode." 

From this grey land of mist and rain
Batavian blood still flows through my veins
Barbarism, is what I adore
Time after time, it leads me to war. 

"Veni, vidi, vici..."
Is what you said old Roman emperor
Ik kwam, ik zag en overwon
Is what we say today... ha ha
Reunited Germanic tribes
Proud and strong, like we've never been away. 

Batavieren, Eburonen,
NerviÃ«rs, Friezen en Teutonen,
Verenigt u en sta als Ã©Ã©n
Want angst, dat kennen wij voor geen!!! 

Germanic tribes unite your forces
Take up your arms and ride your horses
Raise your swords engraved with (mighty) runes
Perpare yourselves when you hear the battle tunes 

Impetuous, stormy and combative
Will lead us to apocalyptic violence
Totally controlled by a blind pugnacity
Yes, that will be the "Bellum Germanicum"
Just after that we will be free
Oh... "Bellum Germanicum"... finally 

Ik kwam, ik zag en overwon
Is what we say today... ha ha
Reunited Germanic tribes
Like we've never been away!
"Bellum Germanicum"
