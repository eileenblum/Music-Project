[Music by Marchosias - lyrics by Lord Mystic]

Listening to the wolves in this cold winter night,
This night we start our battle with pride,
Their time has come...
Return to where you are from,

Them, the ones we despise,
Will soon be at their end,
They will suffer for their own (believed) lies,
For all eternity they are damned,

Filled with a sense of hate, we burn and kill
Driven by our might, we fight
Their destruction is what we must fulfil,
Power given to us by the moon in the midst of night

We will accomplish our desire,
We fight with sword and fire.

Eternal Damnation,
Infernal Devastation

We will destroy them by fire
It is the will of him, they serve
The ones we were always told to admire,
Being burnt is what they deserve

The battle will last long, they will be strong
But we will fight for our victory, forever will be
One by one we will watch them die,
For the life they live for a lie

We will accomplish our desire,
The time has come for him... the liar

Eternal damnation,
Holy termination.
