[Music by Marchosias - Lyrics by Nimroth]

I have been wandering the ages
Felt the pain, injecting my heart with misery
For we are particles of matter
Throughout the centuries,
Evolving to each other's agony,
The evolution of the human mind,
Causes the degeneration of mankind,

I want to float among the stars,
Between a composition of light and darkness
Gifted with powers of future times to come,
Released from a race, which drowns in vain,

For my transmission to the stars,
I've been travelling the desert of my mind,
With eyes frozen by the Eastern Wind,
Forever gazing into the Stratosphere,
Surrounded by imperceptible phantoms,
Astral guardians, which never last

Experiencing the transmission to the macrocosm,
Into a world where my spirit flies free,
Make me rise like a Phoenix again,
Guide me through the halls of eternity
