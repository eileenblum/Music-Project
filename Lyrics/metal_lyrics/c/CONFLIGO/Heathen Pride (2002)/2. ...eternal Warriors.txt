One army of braves
With their pride fight again
Gloomy dim lights

Ghostly parade
Of grudged corpses feel the Hell
Fighting again

When freedom calls
Shake the graves of valiants knight
Resort for revenge

Back's from the graves
For who betrayed a glory past
In battle again

Under the sign
Of the sacred Muntain their guide
And for the last time
...other pain in my mind

"Eternal warriors
You'll fight forever
In blood and fire rule again

Shortest way
To die is courage
Proud way, follow it

Eternal warriors
Spirit of ancients
Lost of the heroes
Our guide

Children of Sorrow
Reborns in rage, forgets the Heaven
Now your home is the Hell"
