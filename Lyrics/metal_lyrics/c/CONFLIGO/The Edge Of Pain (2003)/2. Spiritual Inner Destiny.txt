Deep hidden destiny of man
Dance trough the flames of damnation
Century and century of mankind
Marked by the seal of pleasure
Forget man your holy hopes
Draw on the goblet of sin

I will feeding the embryo of sin with my scarlet blood
Burn in every soul giving her vigour
Is an eternal law
Come to me and make me free
Enthralling force against the twilight of life

Escape from the hypocrisy now
Follow the light of reason
Don't deny your darkest desires
Let them flow, draw enjoyment
Everyone outline his fate
The unfathomable mean of life is sin.
