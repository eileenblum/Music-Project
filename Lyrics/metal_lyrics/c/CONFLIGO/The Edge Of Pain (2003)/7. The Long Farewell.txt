Wasting an useless life
Feeding her with vain illusions
Trusting in violed dogma
Dream yourself as shadow of future

See your corpse
Torn with regrets
And feel your soul
Vibrate at the recall of death

"Sterile madre di infiniti pargoli,
Ignota ai piÃ¹ ma a tutti celebre
Dama di tenebre
La sua ombra ci tocca
La campana dell'Ade rintocca
...Giungiamo a Te
che accogli gli eroi come i vili
In un silenzio che fa male,
Madre per noi, torniamo a te
come schiavi in un supplizio senza fine".

When the frozen winter's breeze
Sweeps away the last autumn leaves
The last breath deletes our dreams
Shattering every hope of tomorrow

See your corpse
Torn with regrets
And feel your soul
Vibrate at the recall of death

"This is the life a journey of grief
Day after day we drew to twilight
Dust is my future and wind my breath,
I close my eyes and wait for my fate".

We are just senseless pawns in a game
Wrong is the first move, the birth of a new life
We keep on steadily playing loosing pawns
And we culminate in the checkmate of death.
