Living in an ephemeral realm trying to hide
Memories behind obscure disguises
Shaming disgust towards the cruelties of life
But the life it's the real ugly thing

"This is the life a journey of grief
Day after day we drew to twilight
Dust is my future and wind my breath,
I close my eyes and wait for my fate".

We are just senseless pawns in a game
Wrong is the first move, the birth of a new life
We keep on steadily playing loosing pawns
And we culminate in the checkmate of death.
