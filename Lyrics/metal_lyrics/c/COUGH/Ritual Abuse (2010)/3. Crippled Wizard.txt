(1:10)

A barren wasteland
Desolate plains
Charging through madness
Living in pain
Crippled and broken
Cast down in shame
Drowning in misery
Eternal rain

Broken throne
Dying alone

His words forgotten
His way ignored
Crawling onwards
Lost in time
The death of ancients
His time has passed
A once immortal reduced to ash

Broken throne
Dying alone [2x]
