Now there's nothing
I can say to you
Broken promise
That you cling to

Turn to nothing
Torture, envy inside
You can hope for
Pain and suffering

Your eyes are blind
There's no reason to live
Cutting the limbs
Your God is dead
There's no reason to live

There's no way to leave
These Killing Fields
Fucking hell
Now sent for you
There's no future
No escaping
Coming for you

You will rot
You're face is grey
There's no reason to live
Breaking the limbs
Now your God is dead
There's no reason to live

No escaping
These Killing Fields
Torture, envy
That pleasure you
All around you
A barren land
No Saviour
Coming for you
Pain and suffering

You're eyes are blind
There's no reason to live
Broken, the limbs
Your God is dead
There's no reason to live...
