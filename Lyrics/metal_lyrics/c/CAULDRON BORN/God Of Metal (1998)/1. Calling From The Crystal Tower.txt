Crystal shards have been found in some ruins in Babylon
It was plain to see a primitive civilization held the key to advanced communication

Mothership we keep calling you back to our new-found prison home
Those who dwell here are wicked
We should have sewn them in the sea and left them alone

A tower was constructed so the zealots could speak to their deities
To touch the heavens, make them bleed
The radio crystal from our world they'd need

Mothership we keep calling you back to our new-found prison home
Those who dwell here are wicked
They hold us, the scientists of our world in captivity
Ibis headed jackal brethren set us free

Deception was our only hope in pretense to speak the tongue of their gods
The interdimensional cry rang forth
It was answered instantly
Across time space continuum salvation came

Mothership came when we called, back to our new-found prison home
And as we depart this world the wicked lie in dead in the ruins of the fallen Babel Tower
