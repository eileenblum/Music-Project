Midnight on a lonely night a star it fell from the sky
It went down down into the fire and it makes me sigh
Daybreak
Daydreams of long ago and far away

Down the river Styx we glide on leathern wings of night
Where fallen stars never swept the winds before
Can we find peace of mind
In this nevermore

Midnight on a lonely night a star it fell from the sky
It went down down and it fell into the fire
And it makes me cry
How long gone and how long will we stay

Born of night we were strong
Couldn't bow before the Tyrant's throne
Fallen angels lost their way
There's tears in the prophets eye as we dream to fly
On our broken wings of sorrow

Cadaverous children rise from the grave
Steal the sulfurous scented night
As dead and living watch them go mount the sky of night
Bathing with darkness blinding moonlight
Now we're rebel angels just left out in the cold
Haunted by the memories cursing streets of gold
And how long since we've gone away
Streets of gold haunt my dreams forever more
