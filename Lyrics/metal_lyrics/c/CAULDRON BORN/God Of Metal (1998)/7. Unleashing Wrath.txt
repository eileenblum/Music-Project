[Music and Lyrics by Howie Bentley]

Call me call me a thief and liar
The flames lick higher and higher
Caught up in a web of your own weaving
Your undoing is coming slowly creeping

Day after day my magic drains your life away
Life away

Four crown princes
Gather around the table for the celebration feast of your wyrd
Drink of plasma
Laugh with the joy of your utter destruction

You took from me
I wished you no harm
Fool fool pulled the Devil's card

Four crown princes
Gather around the table for the celebration feast of your wyrd
Drink of plasma
You suffer Leviathan's bite

Unleashing Wrath
Call me call me a thief and liar
The flames lick higher and higher
Caught up in a web of your own weaving
Your undoing is coming slowly creeping

Day after day my magic drains your life away
Life away

Four crown princes
Gather around the table for the celebration feast of your wyrd
Drink of plasma
Laugh with the joy of your utter destruction

You took from me
I wished you no harm
Fool fool pulled the Devil's card

Four crown princes
Gather around the table for the celebration feast of your wyrd
Drink of plasma
You suffer Leviathan's bite
