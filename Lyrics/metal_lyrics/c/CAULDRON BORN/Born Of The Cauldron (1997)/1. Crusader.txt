Riding in righteous rage, laying waste the land
Killing women, children, beast and man
Raping the young, torturing the old
Forging your way to streets of gold

Madness is in your eyes, the cross upon your chest
You want to die in battle

Stealing, plundering, No! Take that which is rightfully yours
Your book of insane dreams and tyrant king told us you so
Destroy the non-believers just to save your soul
Evangelize the land make it pure again

Madness is in your eyes, the cross upon your chest
You want to die in battle because you know you are blessed
Crusader, kill to please your god above
Crusader, make a joyful sound
Spill the blood upon the ground

You gasp your last breath of icy autumn frost
You look into the eyes of the youth whom to your life is lost
Cast your blurry glance to the skies, realize
No one comes to take your hand from the promised land

Madness is in your eyes, the cross upon your chest
You want to die in battle

Madness is in your eyes, the cross upon your chest
Crimson gushes from your mouth as you wait for death

Crusader, Die to please your god above
Crusader, Make a joyful sound
Your blood got spilled upon the ground
