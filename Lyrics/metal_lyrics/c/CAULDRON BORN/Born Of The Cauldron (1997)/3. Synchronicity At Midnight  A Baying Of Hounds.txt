A black mirror forged in the ancient way
Consecrated to the moon
Look into it long enough
Look deep inside of you

What the moon brings, visions holy or obscene
the walls of this world faded away
Sad voices they bade me follow them
the dead lotus faces led the way

Onward I strode the moonlit stream
The stream became a lake, the lake a sea
The dead faces vanished in the darkness
The moonlight showed what lay before me

What the moon brings, Horrors unholy, obscene
Great columns and spires obscurred by seaweed

A city lay there in the sea
Where the flesh from all churchyards comes to be
It knew me, I knew it

The monolith it arose from the city in the sea
Spake mind to mind with me
Tonight you're in the company of the old ones
Man has called through the ages Daemons,
So you wanted to see yourself on the grand scale
Look into me you and I are one
To know thy God is to know thy Devil,
Midnight rapture, synchronicity

Back through the waters of the worlds dead I ran
Both angular and curved currents of time
Carrying only my dark souls reflection

The apple, the snake, the garden, the fall
Vague symbols of the deed much worse than them all
They scented me at one point as I escaped through time

Plaster the walls 'round
Evil travels through the angles
A baying of hounds, beware
Evil travels through angles
The broken circle will be my end
Avoid the triangle, it's just a matter of time
before the gates will open
I hear the baying of hounds

The monolith it arose from the city in the sea
Spake mind to mind with me
Tonight you're in the company of the old ones
Man has called through the ages Daemons
So you wanted to see yourself on the grand scale
Look into me you and I are one
To know thy God is to know thy Devil
Midnight rapture, synchronicity
