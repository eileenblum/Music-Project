Priests of my temple sustain me
I have gone beyond the gates of forever after
Beyond the shade gates, but not revealed to me
the key to the mysteries

Consciousness comes and Consciousness goes
Locked but never dying in death's smothering throes

Hieroglyphics on the wall
Foretell the doom of he to be
Imprisoned with the Pharaohs
Imprisoned with the Pharaohs, with the Pharaohs
Eternally

Vague recollections of lives fell past
This time my acolytes surround me
they are garbed in blood stained colonial attire
Athames flash maniacal eyes gleam and I scream
These four walls where I begin I will learn
These four walls of the pyramid
Triangular damnation

Hieroglyphics on the wall
Foretell the doom of he to be
Imprisoned with the Pharaohs
Imprisoned with the Pharaohs, with the Pharaohs
Eternally

My sorcery was feared in the land
Even the priests of Isis
Trembled before me
I knew all of the gods of Aegyptus well
To know ones name is to have control by spell
Black Gods of Aegyptus you are the
Devils of Sumeria in disguise
Given form to the formless ones,
I was accurst with this thirst
Despised of all gods
Sorcerer Supreme
But still just a man

Imprisoned with the Pharaohs
Eternally I am damned
