Born on the battlefield,
Heat of the melee during a Vanir raid
Before he had lived to see fifteen snows his name by
Council fires was praised
Intent to colonize southern Cimmeria,
Aquilonia built Venarium
Out of the northern hills swept the Cimmerian steel, tasting Aquilonian blood

In true berserker form he fought on and on beside his Cimmerian kin
The Aquilonians driven back across their frontier
He returned for awhile to his tribe
do you wonder what they mean
Distant voices forever calling In Fate's Eye A King

He spent time with a band of Aesir
He raided the Hyperbareans
The Hyperbarean castles were ruled by wizards called by the fearful Witchmen
He lead a foray against the Haloga Castle to free the daughter of the Aesir chief
The mission a success, but as they fled they were taken by an army of living dead

Toiling away at night he ground his chain until it was weak enough to break
One stormy night, whirling the heavy chain, he slain his way out into the rain

In vague dreams of conquest and kingdom
do you wonder just what they mean
Distant voices forever calling In Fate's Eye A King

Tyrants and wizards, they fall before you and what your wyrd will bring
It was written in the furthest of stars
In Fate's Eye A King

Swordless and fleeing into the mountains
He was chased by a pack of wolves
He found refuge in a cave
Before him sat the corpse of an ancient chieftan upon a throne
Across his knees was a bronze sword grasped by huge hands of ancient bone

When he sees the sword the corpse came to life
He fought with everything in him
Escaped armed this time

In vague dreams of conquest and kingdom
do you wonder just what they mean
Distant voices forever calling In Fate's Eye a King
Tyrants and wizards fall dead before you and what your wyrd will bring
It was written in the furthest of stars
In Fate's Eye A King
Witches and warlocks, women and wine
Songs sons of men will sing
Your life becomes legend, legend becomes myth
In Fate's Eye A King
Your wyrd neverending it turns the wheel do you know the riddle of steel
Never knowing what the next day will bring
In Fate's Eye A King
