Long before man had begun to evolve
There was a warlock, half god, half daemon
Through reckless invultuations he stumbled upon
Things that ought not to be given manifestation

Innocent blood it must be spilled
The runes written in the plasma
A heart filled with courage torn out beating still, and placed in the Cauldron
To bring forth the Hell Storm

Out of the Cauldron arose from the mist
Chaos lain dormant for ages
Hands gripped the steel that smote down the gods as predicted by prophets and sages
A shadow of darkness that dwarfed any host of Hel or Hell envisioned by man
Born of the Cauldron

Malefic language breaking hermetic law
Into the wrong hands the grimoire will fall
The sonorous rhythm from the barbarous tongue sang,
From a devil gorged nightmare
the Cauldron Born came

Innocent blood it must be spilled
The runes written in the plasma
A heart filled with courage torn out beating still and placed in the Cauldron
Hell-Dark sorceries race out on the wind

Very little is known of the necromancers life
But it was whispered of how old Malygris died
