I walked into a blackened room all eyes ablaze upon me
I felt a frost chill tear up my spine as the child gazed upon me

Pulled out into the abyss voices calling me
Falling out into the abyss brought this festival in the snow
Across nameless stars
My forefathers called me from long ago

Twelve figures were there other than myself
Cloaked and hooded in black robes
They raised the dreadful grimoire
And chanted bring forth the ancient ones

Now I am two as one for I gazed too long
Through the black mirror to a world beyond decay
Infinite hells, voices calling me and I was gone with...

Those gathered here tonight were here in a time before man
before time
Beware of those who people the dark circle
Vessel of flesh you will dispatch the child to the House of 
Shades
Before the altar I stood my sabre steeped in blood
I, high priest of the black arts

[Solo]

Now I'm wandering through the streets
Looking at the ruins, I have not seen since I was a child
When the winged gauntsbore me to the edge of midnight and
some beyond
Now, I remember it all

Those gathered here tonight were here in a time before gods 
or even time
Beware of those who people the dark circle
They watch you through dreaming eyes and soon will raise 
their heads
