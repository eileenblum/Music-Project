For victory and glory we follow the legend
He who bears the mark of Kane

Steel sinews grasp the blood drenched steel
Wild flies his red mane

Sunrise bleeds the dawn
His legions charge on and on
Assault on this fortress of stone
Storming the castle at dawn

Eyes wide in fright, we're in the enemies sight
As our seige engines fire the dead bodies
Onto the walls our rain of gore it falls
Hearts of steel melt down
Hearing
nearing 
hell's calls

Cursed by a mad god it is whispered of Kane
that he cannot die

Our enemies fall by the gore axed he weilds
high above him the vultures fly

Sunrise bleeds the dawn
His legions charge on and on
Assault on this fortress of stone
Storming the castle at dawn

The seige engines roll, boiling tar takes its toll
On our men in the front lines
With an awful shout, every man, he rides out
"You won't live at all if you don't take that wall"
shouts Kane the killer

[Solo]

Archers fall as we charge the wall
Not far till we close with the enemy
From the Aerie wide eyed the watchers look down
at the rushing steel tide

Sunrise bleeds the dawn
His legions charge on and on
Assault on this fortress of stone
Earth drinks the blood at dawn

Steel on steel will clash
In a lightning flash
Thousands of men fall down and die
At last we break their lines and now they will find
All who defend the castle will die
Will die
Will die
Will die this day
