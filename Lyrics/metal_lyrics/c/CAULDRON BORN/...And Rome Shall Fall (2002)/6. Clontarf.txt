The Norms weave grief and defeat
For Odin's sons, invaders from the sea
The standards are flying of high King brian
None can stand before the hosts of the irish lion
Years of torment the irish lament to hell the Vikings must be 
sent

The fury of a woman scorned
Gormlaith hath stirred the chieftians to make war on the Erin 
kings

Sitric Silkbeard hath gathered the Viking chieftains anchored 
off
the isle of man

The Valkyries race the skies tonight
Norsemen you will fall when you fight
Drowning in wound dew
Red thor walks the world of men
Odin rides the Wild hunt with his kin
Dragon ships flee from Dublin town

The din of the battle it rocks the sky
As the Kelts smote and heap the carnage high
The Vikings form their shirld wall
But the Dalcasian axes see that they fall
Berserkers die for father one eye
As Crom laughs from his mountain high

Mail is torn and limbs are shorn as the verdant greens
are washed in blood

Helmets are shattered and limbs are scattered
As the red ruin washes the land clean

The Valkyries race the skies tonight
Norsemen you will fall when you fight
Drowning in wound dew
Red Thor walks the world of men
Odin rides the Wild hunt with his kin
Dragon ships flee 

The Valkyries race the skies tonight
Norsemen you will fall when you fight

Drowning in wound dew
Red Thor walks the world of men
Odin rides the Wild hunt with his kin
Dragon ships flee into the sea
