When omens of all portant come to be
and the ancient ones rise up from the sea
and the winged one comes forth from the moon

The one will appear whose heart knows no fear
When those who dream in Ryleh draw near
Bringing forth their mockery of flesh and our doom

A King of Kings, the druid he brings
To test his soul in the fire that sings
A dragon's song from an age that fell to dust

He holds the Dragon Throne
Wielder of Atlantean Steel

All men at arms they gather round
To see if he is the one that they found
To deliver them from the fate the demons bring

He mounts his throne, his face set as stone
All who are false are charred to the bone
By the dragon's flame that reckons the real King

Witch woman, white godess
Daughter of Poseidonous
She holds the key to defeat the beast

He holds the Dragon Throne
Wielder of Atlantean steel
He holds the Dragon Throne
Wielder of the steel

And it's out on his quest
for he will know no rest
armed only with his sword the druid has blessed
Through magick storms and blood feast

[Solo]

Ah, she had been found
Mayana, the white Goddess from the sea
She who held the talisman to defeat the beast

"I will grant this strength for your boon if here with
me you reside for one moon" spake Mayana, the White
Godess from the sea

He rode two horses to death on the way

And when his feet hit the dirt he was in the melee
And his gleaming steel from his scabbard flew wild and free

And last died the demon King
For Elaks hand held a beating thing
Mayana gave her heart the talisman
He holds the Dragon Throne
Wielder of Atlantean steel
He holds the Dragon Throne
Wielder of the steel
