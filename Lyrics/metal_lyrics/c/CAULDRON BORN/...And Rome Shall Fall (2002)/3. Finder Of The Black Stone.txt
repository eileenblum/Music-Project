King of the Race without a name
galloping hard across the moor
Past great menhirs to hells door
Seeking the witch down Dagons moor

In my mind's eye, I watch my people die
scattered like chaff in the storm I ride

I won't see my world in chains
while my fists can still grip steel
I will go to the worms of the earth
and I'll strike my unholy deal
I won't break and I alone, I will be the Finder Of The Black 
Stone
For victory I would taint my soul, throw myself in the demons 
hold
I won't break and I alone, I will be the Finder Of The Black 
Stone

Finder Of The Black Stone

There were woman down a Dagons Moor
Atla holds the key to hells door
To taste a kiss only a king can give
She will tell me where the black stone is hid

Night fall comes and the deal is sealed
The black stone's power shall be mine to wield

I won't see my world in chains while my fists can still grip 
steel
I will go to the worms of the earth and I'll strike my unholy 
deal
My kin won't wear the yoke of Rome, I will be the Finder Of 
The Black Stone
For vengeance I would taint my soul, throw myself in the 
demons hold
My kin won't wear the yoke of Rome, I will be the Finder Of 
The Black Stone

Finder Of The Black Stone

Down in the earth blacker than night
on an altar of human skulls a light

Carved in cryptic runes the stone
before days when demons left men alone
To see the object they worship again
The demons agree to crush the Roman men

I won't see my world in chains while my fists 
can still grip steel
I have gone to the worms of the earth
and I struck my unholy deal

Military leader of the outpost of Rome lays
mindless at my feet alone
Fled his mine from that fouler than beast
On his soul the worms now feast
For vengeance I tained my soul
I gave up humanity to crush my foe

Finder Of The Black Stone
