Inspect all the crazy things in life
Help me now, don't want to fail
Breakdown, watching the time
Insist, lost in flames

Coming with the frankinsence
Come and go

Destination is our fall
My skill is my pride, help me try

Frustration is calling your name
Frustration/insane
A piece of your heart
Frustration/insane

Reaction, the situation runs away
Suffering, the choice is yours
Realize, it's your generation
Run, out of control

Coming with the frankinsence
Come and go

Destination is our fall
My skill is my pride, help me try

My skill is my pride, help me try
