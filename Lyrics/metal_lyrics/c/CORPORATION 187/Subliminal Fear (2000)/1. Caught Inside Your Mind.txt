Run, don't fade away
Wait for your way
Breakdown, why stay?
Broken bones will rise again
Stop it and feel the pain
Asking, is this a state to blame?
Breakthrough, listen to the victim's rage
Slaughtered by all the crossing thoughts

Fear is helping you die
Is helping you down
The fear is caught inside your mind

Crime, it's all the same
Stay at the flame
No one to blame
Artificial defence of mind
Waiting betray yourself
Remember you're in the space games
Somehow, death is breaking through alive
Miracle in my own darkest law

Walking right through your life
The fear is caught inside your mind
The fear is caught inside your mind

Reach out your hand
Find mysterious land
Waiting, don't care
See your life in a stream
Darkness it's close it's near
Pretending you're in a holy grave
Listen to all the voices screaming loud
Don't let them into my dream
