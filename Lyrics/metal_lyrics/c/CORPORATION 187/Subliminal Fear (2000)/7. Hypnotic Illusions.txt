Somehow, you're standing there bleeding
Somehow, your life is feeding
Somehow, feelings are blind
While you're counting all the lies

I come to get the anger you're afraid of
I come to take the pain away
I can't control my life it's in danger
Holding my breath for some days
The ground is moving, come here help me find my way
Everything looks good, but I'm standing on the wrong
Side of the fence

Hypnotic illusion
Atomic fear, confuction?
Heaven's gate, you can't see
Atomic fear is here

Somehow, you're standing there bleeding
Somehow, your life is feeding
Somehow, feelings are blind
While you're counting all the lies

I come to get what is left of your pride
I come to find a better way
Living by the rules, fast obligation
Control it, fade away
Big contrast, hold it for the last, convulsion, starting to scream
Fictional aggression
There's no palce left to rise

I'm calling for an answer
Hypnotic illusion, confusion
Mind is not clear, it's like an infection
Sweating blood
