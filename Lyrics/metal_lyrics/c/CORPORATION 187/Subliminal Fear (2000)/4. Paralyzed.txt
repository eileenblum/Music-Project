It's a work of fiction, panic in your dream
Propaganda, no one has succeeded
Old comission, your ambition
Starting to heal, redemption of a crime
What will you find?

I lay down on the ground
Feel the aggression, what is my destiny?
I'm searching for an answer
While the whole world is, paralyzed

You
You don't care about that/this
You don't seem to understand

Power is coming with anger, while your knees are weak
Despise and falling, is it your breathing that I hear?
In need of protection, there's no objection to that
Ready to climb, reaching the ultimate mind

Raise your head moving slowly
Your blood is cold, raise your head

Raise your head moving slowly
Your blood is cold, raise your head

It's a work of fiction, panic in your dream
Propaganda, no one has succeeded
Old comission, your ambition
Starting to heal, redemption of a crime
What will you find?

I lay down on the ground
Feel the aggression, what is my destiny?
I'm searching for an answer
While the whole world is, paralyzed
