Can't explain, my life for you
Standing in the dust and screaming in despair
Walk a mile, with wicked eyes
Wondering why life seems to be a spireful dream - no

Standing on a sinking stone
Flesh is starting to moulder

Empty thoughts, in my own law
I can control every little move inside my brain
Make your move and you will die
Nothing to prove, nothing to live for - no

Standing on a sinking stone
Flesh is starting to moulder

Now. Can you see me?
Living in a dream, the darkness screams
A cold shiver, straw coloured corpse

Not a shred, of evidence
Every little memory is gone with the wind
Standartize, starry-eyed
Look before you leap, it's not so difficult you see

Dedicate, no one to blame
What do you know for sure? Leave me and you will see
Exorcise, an evil spirit
Crawling on the ground, going deeper to the south - no

Standing on a sinking stone
Flesh is starting to moulder

Infiltrate, long way down
I can't see a think of you don't turn the light on
History or future
Don't be afraid, just listen to the voice
Think you need an explanation
You are so misunderstood, so frail and weak
End of life, it's your decision
Is this a holiday? I say yes, and you say - no

Standing on a sinking stone
Flesh is starting to moulder
