Calling it agony, be there in time
Everything smells like shit, stand in line
Obscene behaviour, facing the weak
Donw on your knees you're so obscene

Ger ready for the battle, showing no mercy
Standing still till the bottle is gone
What is your religion? Who is your god?
Poor and broke. Where is the dawn?

Crack under the strain with bleeding hands
You're looking so pale inside that sphere
Suddenly the silence breaks through
Only some lonely screams

Low-pitched
I can't hear it
Turn in your grave
What do you say?

Listen to the voice, the words are mine
It's burning down, down deep inside
It feels like an electric shock
A gentle touch is all that I need

Time to think before it's too late
It's not that easy when the anger fades
You don't know why, and try to find
A simple way in life

Burn
Those words are mine, those thoughts are mine
Low
Those words are mine, those thoughts are mine

Calling it agony, be there in time
Everything smells like shit, stand in line
Obscene behaviour, facing the weak
Down on your knees you're so obscene
