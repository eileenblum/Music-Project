Love the face that's facing the dawn
Love to hate reflections, it's your connection
All the broken records, live through a grade, do not fall
Falling down, it's your conception
Fast on the stage, breaking, it's a cross
But it's lost, and your memory isn't really on a lovely spot

I want to see your old souls
Salvation, no complication
Do you want to go?

Fastest call, calling for more
It's a reminder, look around
There is a chain-reaction in your veins
Just like some dying trees falling to the ground
Fade away, it's your conception
Help me to see the land of disease
Lack of hope and motivation
Your mind is blocked it's just like a stone

I can't stand here, all alone
I can't ignore you
Remember that picture is a fake
Smiling, fade away
