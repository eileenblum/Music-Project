Come here toc atch the moment of this glorious day
Falling down into a hole, you're insane
Not in control, there is something on the other side
Finish your life with a rope around your neck
It's time to find a better place, immortal, future is fantasy
Emptiness is coming, closer, but your soul is not with you

I get infected
I can't control myself
I get infected
My own mistake

It's clear, please watch the time for me
Show me the fastest way out of here
Calling is divine, in your fire the sky is clear

I get infected
I can't control myself
I get infected
My own mistake

All the leaves turn to soil can't feel free
And it's because of a broken promise
Run, your aggression is pain
Rise, trembling around, moving with your sins

Be quick please close your eyes for me
The breaking point is not here, you see
Deep inside this dawn is clear
In search for blood, even a cold heart bleeds
Shattered in despair, tears are falling
Don't try to hide yourself and thinking about
Your aggression is pain

I get infected
I can't control myself
I get infected
My own mistake
