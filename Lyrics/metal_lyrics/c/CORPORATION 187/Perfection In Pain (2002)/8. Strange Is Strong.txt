[Music: Pettersson/Eng/Knutsson Lyrics: Carlsson]

Strange is strong
Come follow my steps
Don't look down
Sleep, with your eyes wide open
Now, have a moment, your own

[for-ref.]
Chained to the face
Clearly criminal
Do you provoke me?
Stand on all fours

[ref.]
I see the end, cause I know what will be
From heaven send, the truth will set you free
Just walk away
Just go, just walk away

Make me king
I rule you like hell, so come on
Be my device to unlock
Portraits of open foreheads

Chained to the face
Clearly criminal
Do you provoke me?
Stand on all fours

I see the end, cause I know what will be
From heaven send, the truth will set you free
Just walk away
Just go, just walk away

[Solo]

Time is slipping my hands, once more
For a piece of my mind
Take my body to hell

Time is slipping my hands, once more
For a piece of my mind
Take my body to hell
Satisfaction to kill

Chained to the face
Clearly criminal
Do you provoke me?
Stand on all fours

I see the end, cause I know what will be
From heaven send, the truth will set you free
Just walk away
Just go, just walk away
