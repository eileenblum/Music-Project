[Music: Knutsson/Eng/Pettersson Lyrics: Carlsson]

Perfection in pain, a sensual violation
I may be cheap but I do it right, of course
I'm your chilinut whore, coming back for more

[ref.]
She said please please please,
I'll be better this time
I must control my needs and deeds
I'm at the end of the line

[Solo]

I'm ending this game, and waiting for my vacation
You may be sweet but I do you harm, of course
I'm your chilinut whore, won't be nice no more

She said: Can I stay, I can pay you again
How come you are so hard and fine
And say you can not be mine?

The deeper we go
The more dedicated you get
It hurts me more than it hurts you, right?
Bring out the rubberman, bring out the rubberman
Bring out the rubberman

[Solo]

[ref.]
She said please please please
I'll be better this time
I must control my needs and deeds
I'm at the end of the line

The deeper we go
The more dedicated you get
It hurts me more than it hurts you, right?
Bring out the rubberman, bring out the rubberman
Bring out the rubberman, bring out the rubberman
