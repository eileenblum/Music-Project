[Music: Pettersson/Eng Lyrics: Carlsson]

Can you see the madness deep inside?

Seems like my worst behavior
Is the ultimate choice
So now I am bound to be bad
Whether you like it or not
Can't explain but my weird personality
Appears to be fighting inside
Whether I like it or not
Whether I like it or not

Can you see the madness deep inside?

[ref.]
Treat me good
I plan to hurt you like
You've never been hurt before
And I would if I could
Violated relation

Stretching the ropes around you
Now you're fading away
So now you're bound to the bed
Whether you like it or not
You are here but there's no sensuality
You're making me spiteful again
Whether I like it or not
Whether we like it or not

Can you see the madness deep inside?

Treat me good
I plan to hurt you like
You've never been hurt before
And I would if I could
Violated relation

No more, reason
To get to know me
No more, prison
I will release you, now!

[Solo]

Treat me good
I plan to hurt you like
You've never been hurt before
And I would if I could
Violated relation
