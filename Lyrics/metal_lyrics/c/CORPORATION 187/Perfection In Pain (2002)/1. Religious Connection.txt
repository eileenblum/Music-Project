[Music: Knutsson/Eng/Pettersson Lyrics: Carlsson]

Do you see me clear enough
Can you feel the anger running through my blood?
If a chainsaw can't make you understand, who can, you're through

Our connection through blood makes me wonder
Can I take you down with me?

[ref.]
So you can dance the twisted dance
So you can sing the morbid songs
So you can end your living lies
I hate your paradise

Older, wiser, but you're not
The hard way will strike your so pathetic life
You have no respect for me
You bring out the worst in me

Our connection through blood makes me wonder
Can I take you down with me?

So you can dance the twisted dance
So you can sing the morbid songs
So you can end your living lies
I hate your paradise
I hate your paradise

[Solo]

So you can dance the twisted dance
So you can sing the morbid songs
So you can end your living lies
I hate your paradise
I hate your paradise
