[Music: Knutsson/Eng Lyrics: Carlsson]

Feed in front of my eyes
Disgusting living in moving pictures
Do I want to watch your, ordinary days?
Ordinary days

Don't want to be in between
You're the worst I've ever seen

[ref.]
I can't help you now
Your path is way to long
I can't see behind
Your face will be your fall

My Thursday-night aggression
A weekly night obsession

Kill your own alibis
Let down your family, friends and others
Do I want to watch your, ordinary days?
Ordinary days

Don't want to be in between
You're the worst I've ever seen

I can't help you now
Your path is way to long
I can't see behind
Your face will be your fall

My Thursday-night aggression
A weekly night obsession

[Solo]

Don't want to be in between
You're the worst I've ever seen

I can't help you now
Your path is way to long
I can't see behind
Your face will be your fall

My Thursday-night aggression
A weekly night obsession
