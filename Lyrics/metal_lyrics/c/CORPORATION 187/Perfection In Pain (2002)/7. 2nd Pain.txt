[Music: Knutsson/Pettersson/Eng Lyrics: Carlsson]

Enter the second life
Explore the unknown world
Rule another kingdom
All opposites confirmed
All opposites confirmed

Confront your fears
The deadly truth of yours
Search your mind, the thoughts you dare to think
The thoughts you dare to think

[ref.]
Nothing slips into my veins
No defence, your destiny
Soul-chained to the second pain
Different control, you are mine

Defy your fears
The deadly truth of yours
Tear up your heart and search for your weakness
And truth, my truth
Your weakness and truth
Your weakness and truth

Nothing slips into my veins
No defence, your destiny
Soul-chained to the second pain
Different control, you are mine

Up and away, or go down on me
Break your bones, break those bones
Up and away or go down on me
Bite the pain, bite the pain

[Solo]

Your weakness and truth
Your weakness and truth

Nothing slips into my veins
No defence, your destiny
Soul-chained to the second pain
Different control, you are mine
