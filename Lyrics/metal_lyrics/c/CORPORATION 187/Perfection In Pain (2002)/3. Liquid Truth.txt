[Music: Pettersson/Eng Lyrics: Carlsson]

It comes in like the tide
Now you're biding your time
I'm the dark can you see?
We are one, you and me

Give me life to set free
The living monster in me
I'm the dark, can you see
We are one, this is me

I am your mentor in pain
You're the bad seed in vain
You're in line to be me
We are one can it be?

[for-ref.]
I stain your face, with liquid truth
The only way is my way, I will end your days,
This is war

[ref.]
I am your master, I mean, I am the bandit
He is the cave in which I shelter

[Solo]

It comes in like the tide
Now you're biding your time
I'm the dark can you see?
We are one, you and me

I stain your face, with liquid truth
The only way is my way, I will end your days,
This is war

I am your master, I mean, I am the bandit
He is the cave in which I shelter
He is the cave in which I shelter
