[Music: Knutsson/Eng Lyrics: Carlsson]

Try to live with the
Ghosts of confusion

I'm rolling without reason
My dreamland is just around the corner
My caffeine-twisted brain runs high, runs high

Suddenly I turn into a penguin
I swim towards the sea
My wings are short but shiny
I'm glad I'm not a bee

Try to live with the
Ghosts of confusion

[ref.]
One hour after midnight
And I'm a penguin, black and white
I wonder can these take me
Above the sea tonight?

But even if I'm trying
My wings can't make me fly
I'm waking up and crying
At least I had to try

Now here I am reminding
You all to think about
This story I was writing
A very sleepless night

[Solo]

One hour after midnight
And I'm a penguin, black and white
I wonder can these take me
Above the sea tonight?

Two sides of one story
Living next to the evil airlines
Hysterical pilots flying in my head
Corrupted politicians filled with seed

I'm rolling without reason
My dreamland is just around the corner
My caffeine-twisted brain runs high, runs high

Suddenly I turn into a penguin
I swim towards the sea
My wings are short but shiny
I'm glad I'm not a bee

Try to live with the
Ghosts of confusion
