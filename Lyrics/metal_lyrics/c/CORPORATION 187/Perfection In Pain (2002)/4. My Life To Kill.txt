[Music: Pettersson/Eng Lyrics: Carlsson]

I have a dream where I must hang myself
Just throw myself into eternity
You won't catch my fall, you never will
You won't catch my fall, you never will

This is the final mark
Help me up, then drag me down
Smell it, the air of evil
The air of evil

[ref.]
I am gun
Suicidal pain-machine
I've lost all senses
Seeking death instead of pain

I am bound to chaos
Forever bound to chaos

I'm here to teach you my reality
Surrounded by those who refuse to see
You won't hear my call, you never will
This will end it all, my life to kill

This is the final mark
Help me up, then drag me down
Smell it, the air of evil
The air of evil

I am gun
Suicidal pain-machine
I've lost all senses
Seeking death instead of pain

I am bound to chaos
Forever bound to chaos

[Solo]

I am gun
Suicidal pain-machine
I've lost all senses
Seeking death instead of pain

I am bound to chaos
Forever bound to chaos
