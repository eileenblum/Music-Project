[Music: Pettersson/Eng Lyrics: Carlsson]

Spin my head
Cut my hands
I wash away my lunacy
In the dark of the midnight-sun
Is this mind-control?
Mind-control?

[ref.]
I decide to not give in
To not be a slave
Yet, still I am
I fail once again
How can I say no
To the joy of being addicted
So please let me go
I've lost all will to live

Breathe, sickness fills my lungs
Deal, sell my soul for guns

Overstate
To eliminate
I have the will to end this hell
But the balance can not be done
Is this mind-control?
Mind-control?

I decide to not give in
To not be a slave
Yet, still I am
I fail once again
How can I say no
To the joy of being addicted
So please let me go
I've lost all will to live

Breathe, sickness fills my lungs
Deal, sell my soul for guns
