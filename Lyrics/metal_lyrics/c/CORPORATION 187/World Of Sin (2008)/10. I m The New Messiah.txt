I'm the new messiah
I will bless you all
I need you here with me, you see,
I am your destiny
The weak and poor and those who failed
We are demons, so praise the lord
The weak and poor and those who failed
We are demons, so praise the lord

In a storm of snow, the liars will fall
But keep me warm and let me be, your god, eternity

I'm the one the world couldn't live without
You will have no other gods beside me
As I lay my hands upon your face
Walk into my land and my truth unhol, unholy

Who are Jesus Christ, and the great jehova?
I guess they couldn't come, so you'll just have to play with me

Let your soul be free and then pay to me
Bring me wine and food and I'll let you live
We could live together in harmony
Just do what I say and then smile at me

Won't you smile?
