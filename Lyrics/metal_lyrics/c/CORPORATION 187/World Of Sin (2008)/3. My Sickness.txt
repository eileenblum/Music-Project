As others, run around with strength
I manage only to be there
A closet with one window
We can not touch we can not speak no more

Forgive me that I leave you here
I did not choose this sickness
I'm lost with no control
I've struggled and I want some more some more

What will you do when I'm gone?
I can't control you anymore
I sit without my powers
And gently try to live

I count the days and seconds too
I can't stay longer here with you
If I could live for one more day
Just you and I for one more day

We'd spend it in a better way
Like frozen teardrops in the spring
I'm slowly dying from inside
A terrifying feeling
My lips can't speak my words no more
