I have waited, I have learned
Through my blood I saw my way
This is now or never, hear my call
You found me on my dying day
Let's be holy, let's be right
Raise my devils hold me tight
I am down below
And here I live my yesterdays

The morbid ways I live my life
I let you in to die tonight
This is all forever, kill you all
Come on play this wicked game
Let's be wet and let's be tight
Drink my darkness, do me right
You are down below
We drown your sky in blood tonight

Join me here forever
Chain my heart
Join me here forever
Take my hand and lead me

Tell me the truth
Question the light
Live with it
Understand it
Bring me the secrets of the night
