January first
A new year of forbidden life
Smoke, death and dirt
I am the virus of this earth

Hang the monkey upside-down
Pop the eye, get me some
Will you bleed for me?
If I sing for you?

The liberation of your mind, will fall
The liberation, is all

Sanctification
Bleed for me
The virus nation
Set it free

Concrete/steel
Lay me down in a bed of dust
Lights, sirens and screams
I am virus of your brain
