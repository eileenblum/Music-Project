Just like the dead I stare blind
This house is alive
I can't believe my eyes
The dead are friends of mine

Blood, it feels my throat
My god, it's drowning me
Insane, this can't be happening
I promise not to tell

This madhouse inspires me
It frightens me
I've seen the total madness it creates
I'm on my knees, I crawl
Afraid I'm losing it, Again
Here are the ghosts again

I choke, my colours fade
I'm at the hospital
They hunt with needles today
I suffer as the play

Fast, it runs so fast
My heart is leaving me
Inside my world is shaking
I promise not to tell
