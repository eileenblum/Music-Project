Sacrifice,
The holy way to end your life
Ride me now, the serpent colours fits your eyes

Merciless, everyone's in arms tonight
Forgiveness fails, close your eyes so close your eyes

Open the door for the next generation
Let it out for the grand manipulation
Agony, react with anxiety so taste the publicity

Suicide ring, it burns within
It's spinning around with jaws inside
Pain is lust, a deeper kind of trust
The newcomers of sin will burn and rule your king
And we will laugh forevermore
When you suffer the suicide king
