The decision left for me
Still attached to reality
Weak and fragile we will be
Passed by, there for all to see

Your perception, will be mine
Undone, brought through time
My strangled will
Forevermore
Until I'm free

Moments in time left for all to see
The sore is open wide

Will

Moments in mud left for all to see
The sore is open wide

Falling under apathy
The world as my will
Further drawn to infinity
Inside the end I will be here

Will
Moments in mud left all to see
Will
The sore is open wide

Closer, I'm closer as the leaves fall too early
Left my eyes, left my eyes as my will was bent to rust
Closer, I'm closer as my future is spelled in lies
Numb fire, numb fire as the sun was turned to ice

Skies cried for what was to come
We're emptied and dried by a concept of lies
Will try to make it undone
A structureless plan controlled by a dice

Will

Time dies a moment in bliss
Stifled by the dream you created
Now we have come to this
The part were all your deeds are degraded

Will

Odd-shaped forms drift from the one weight
Wake the waves, the waves fain
Displaced drama unfold between barriers of dust
Evergrowing conflict, perspective denied
Dynamics, alternate ways, here
As you are

Will shaped, all is lost
Will shaped, all is lost
