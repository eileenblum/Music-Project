Once reflected
Refused to shine again
This may vanish
The source of will slowly drain

Still blank face grin
Your rapture will ignite
Under your dead masque
A painful fade from sight

Are we here?

Once eternal
I drank a thousand minds
Dead shapes turn real now
They are of thousand kinds

Exposure, a death show
Dim lights pierce my mind
A passage though substance
Clairvoyance, a rare find

Are we near?

No, I won't view your sight
A sickened voice to here
I won't sight your mind

Once rejected
The voice spoke so clear
Stillness absorbed by
The everlasting fear

Construction of dead minds
A beauty of behold
Followed in vague steps
The end was foretold

I have drowned in white infinity
Driven to the edge of sanity
Shadows of declined supremacy
Debased by our thoughtless sanctity

No, I won't view your sight
A sickened voice to hear
I won't sight your mind

No, I won't view your sight
A sickened voice to hear
I won't sight your mind
