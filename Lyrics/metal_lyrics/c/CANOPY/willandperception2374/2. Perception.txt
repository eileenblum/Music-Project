Suffering
All you hear
Is the voice

Prophecies
Of
The end

Reflections
Of a clouded mind
Evolves

Serene faces bold in design
Locked insertion, rapture of time
Debasement
Defacement

Can't you see
As the dust settles
Over humanity
All that has ever been
And ever shall be
Lays in front of your feet
