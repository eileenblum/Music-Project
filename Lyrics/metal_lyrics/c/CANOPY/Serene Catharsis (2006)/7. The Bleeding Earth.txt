In distant I
Of movement still
The trail of absence
Infected will

Of blood thirst rise
No other strive
A lying tongue
Of vision deprived

Now another day
It's just like before
We slaughter mornings epilogue

Crucified by another remission
Since the victim never lie
We're lead by a dead vision
On a bleeding earth

The father and all children
Of a vision turned to rust
Will reach back for one second
Hesitation, fragile lust

"the earth in its entirety,
 drenched in blood is nothing but a
 vast altar on which every living being must die
 until all is devoured, until the wicked is rid,
 until death itself is dead, on our,
 our bleeding earth"

Crucified by another remission
Since the victim never lie
We're lead by a dead vision
On a bleeding earth
