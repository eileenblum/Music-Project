Falling from your eyes
Blinded by disgust
Slowly fading into
Submission of your mind

Presence of mind lapse
Obstruction of real life
Worthless prophet
Liar without remorse

Thoughtless actions
They focus or slumber
Slowly fading into
Submission of your mind

See inside you
You can't deny
What you are

As the sun filters its rays
Your life passes away
Your mind passes away

Misery foretold as
Words lost there essence
Worthless prophet
Liar without remorse

No you can't deny
What's in front of your eyes
You can't believe
The lite that you once told

You can't deny
In front of my eyes
You can't believe
The lite that you once told
