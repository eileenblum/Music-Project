Submissive state of mind
Without intention
New visions found in life
These scales are beyond your sight

Dismissed duality
Lying
Closure of sanity

A multitude of eyes
Are staring into the light
Emotions lost in life
The serpent revealed its face

Subtle movements
Unfolding from every lie
Interpretation
Of false faces, lest inside

Eradication
Of broken bounds
Rejuvenation
From undiscovered grounds
