Thrive
All time we've used for nothing real
Strive
Suffer now, at least you feel

Soulless body here to wander
Fed the tragedy of lust
Fooled through concepts, fake designs
Ongoing, you know you must

Who will justify?
A parametric tragedy
Who will testify?
I'm dead all through
Who will justify?
A paramedic tragedy
Who will testify?
One mourning firmament

Repression, erasure of real thought
Fading away, is this the goal you sought?
Spirit died, left issues unbrought
Desolate ways, for this place you fought

We are left beneath

It's a dead position here
Without particular reason
All these schemes that you hold dear
It can't seem to be treason?

Firmament, one firmament
