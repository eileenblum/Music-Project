As it looses touch
Our mind fails again
It stops in a deafening roar of silence
We are the unknown
A single mind born
A solution to the pest that is humanity

A dance of death within nothing
We are the unknown who do not desire
As a single mind, we are born
Creating a world beyond what we deserve

We are the silent ones
The invisible
The ones without hope nor future
Within madness we are born
Creating a world beyond what we deserve

As it looses touch
Our mind fails again
It stops in a deafening roar of silence
We are the unknown
A single mind born
A solution to the pest that is humanity

As sanity moves away
We observe
We distance ourselves
The hope once had fades
The choice was made
Into oblivion we fall

We grin behind our masks
Behind our masks
