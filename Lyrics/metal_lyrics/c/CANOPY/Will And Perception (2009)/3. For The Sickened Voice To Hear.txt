Once reflected
Refused to shine again
This may vanish
The source will slowly drain

Still blank face grin
Your rapture will ignite
Under your dead masque
A painful fade from sight

Are we here?

Once eternal
I drank a thousand minds
Deadshapes turn real now
They are of thousand kinds

Exposure, a deathshow
Dim lights pierce my mind
A passage through substance
Clairvoyance, a rare find

Are we near?

No, I won't view your sight
A sickened voice to hear
I won't sight your mind

Once rejected
The voice spoke so clear
Stillness absorbed by
The everlasting fear

Construction of dead minds
A beauty to behold
Followed in vague steps
The end was fortold

I have drowned in white infinity
Driven to the edge of sanity
Shadows of declined supremacy
Debased by our thoughless sanctity

No, I won't view your sight
A sickened voice to hear
I won't sight your mind
