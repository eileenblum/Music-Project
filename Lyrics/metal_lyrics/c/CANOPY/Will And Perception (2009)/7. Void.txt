Structureless shapes
The world as you know it will fall
Last lingering thread
Its origins denied by us all

Pulsating through deadscapes in floods
Poison every last withering vine

The core is rotten, an undergrowing seed
A sight of aw, bend to the obscene

Fractured world
As will and perception, follow me
Driven by one sole intention
As we arrange the patterns, bound to you
Inactivate our trauma

Motionless acts
The world as you know it in wait
Further away
Give in to the concept of hate

Pulsating through deadscapes in floods
Poison every last shell of rust

The pendium is swinging, unearth all you need
Galleries emptied, a sickening deed

Fractured world
As will and perception, follow me
Driven by one sole intention
As we arrange the patterns, bound to you
Inactivate our trauma

Picture myself in void
This one design I'm through
Picture myself in void
All debt left for you

Walked into the hallway
Gathered dust, right on time

Pour my mind open
Drastic change, still inclined
Stand, ready and waiting
Time is now, will decide
