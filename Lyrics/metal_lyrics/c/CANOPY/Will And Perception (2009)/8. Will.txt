The decision left for me
Still attached to reality
Weak and fragile we will be
Passed by, there for all to see

Your perception, will be mine
Undone, brought through time
My strangled will, forevermore until I'm free

Moments in mud left for all to see
The soar is open wide

Will
Moments in mud left for all to see
The soar is open wide

Falling under apathy
The world as my will
Further drawn to infinity
Inside the end I will be here

Will
Moments in mud left for all to see
Will
The soar is open wide

Closer, I'm closer as the leaves fall too early
Left my eyes, left my eyes as my will was bent to rust
Closer, I'm closer as my future is spelled in lies
Numb fire, numb fire as the sun was turned to ice

All sights unseen
Numbed and relieved
This, my end

Closer, I'm closer as the leaves fall too early
Left my eyes, left my eyes as my will was bent to rust
Closer, I'm closer as my future is spelled in lies
Numb fire, numb fire as the sun was turned to ice

Skies cried for what was to come
We're emptied and dried by a concept of lies
Will try to make it undone
A structureless plan controlled by a dice

Will

Time dies a moment in bliss
Stifled by the dream you created
Now we have come to this
The part were all your deeds are degraded

Will

Shapeless forms drift from the one weight
Waves, the waves again
Displaced drama unfold between barriers of dust
Evergrowing conflict, perspective denied
Dynamics, alternate ways
As you are.

Will shaped, all is lost
Will shaped, all is lost
