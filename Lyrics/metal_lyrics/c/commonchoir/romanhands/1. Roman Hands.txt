I want to exhale smoke
I want to destroy the beautiful
What's the point, if you can't destroy what you've created

Trial and tribulation all seem insignificant to me
Everything under the sun
Insignificant to me

I want to exhale smoke
I want to destroy the beautiful
What's the point, if you can't destroy what you've created

Trial and tribulation all seem insignificant to me
Everything under the sun
Insignificant to me

Pass the conch
A new order has begun

I want to exhale smoke
I want to destroy the beautiful

At my side my demons lie forever
Open wounds and dirty clothed
At my side my demons lie forever
Salted wounds and broken home

Pass the conch
A new order has begun
A new order has begun
A new order has begun
