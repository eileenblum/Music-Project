I'm always drowning in a sea of moral ambiguity

This moral compass keeps spinning around, spinning around
A sense of direction always lost and found, lost and found

I find it hard to do what the world tells me is right, my only fear is my own fight

This moral compass exists, as an anchor around your wrists, can't tread water without your arms, what's meant to save just does more harm

Always drowning in the depths of undefined righteousness

This moral compass keeps spinning around, spinning around
A sense of direction always lost and found, lost and found

It doesn't to make sense to live in reverie, I don't feed into the pipe dream of immortality

This moral compass exists, as an anchor around your wrists, can't tread water without your arms, what's meant to save just does more harm

To you the mouth of blasphemy
The mouth of truth to me
The mouth of truth to me

If I'm to burn, then let it be, let it be
If I'm to burn, then let it be
If I'm to burn, then let it be, let it be
If I'm to burn, then let it be

This moral compass exists, as an anchor around your wrists, can't tread water without your arms, what's meant to save just does more harm

I'll find my own way, without the light of the holy
I'll find my own way, without the light
Without the light
