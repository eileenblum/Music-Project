I've lost everything I've invested in you
In a moment
I could speak in volumes, on all the times I've heard you lie
Oh I could speak in volumes, but your own words will do just fine

You're loosing your grip
You're loosing your sight
You're loosing your grip
You're loosing your sight

Go back to California
Run back to your golden coast
Like that that could ever heal
These salted wounds or broken bones

Your words could never last
You built them on pillars of salt and sand
With neuropathetic hands
With neuropathetic hands
Sharks smell blood from the depths of this shallow water

You're loosing your grip
You're loosing your sight
You're loosing your grip
You're loosing your sight

Go back to California
Run back to your golden coast
Like that that could ever heal
These salted wounds or broken bones

Sharks smell blood in shallow water
This coastal feeding has become a coastal slaughter
The sharks smell blood
This feeding is a coastal slaughter

As you slip away
Slip softly into the sea
Your body bleeds, as it sinks

For once this coastal feeding won't be on me
And I've lost everything that I've invested in

You're loosing your grip
You're loosing your sight
You're loosing your grip
You're loosing your sight

Go back to California
Run back to your golden coast
Like that that could ever heal
These salted wounds or broken bones
