As cold accumulates on your skin
You stand tall, yet so frail, so very thin
In your mind this virus is feeding
Your strength is receding
Into a void

I'll pull you back
I'll bring you fucking back
I'll pull you back
I'll pull you fucking back

Cut these scarlet threads
Pull this scarlet thread
Before you're fucking dead
Before you're fucking dead

Pull this scarlet thread
Cut this scarlet thread
Unstitch all this dread
Before you're fucking dead

As cold accumulates on your skin
You stand tall, yet so frail, so very thin
In your mind this virus is feeding
Your strength is receding
Into a void

I'll pull you back
I'll bring you fucking back
I'll pull you back
I'll pull you fucking back

Cut these scarlet threads
Pull this scarlet thread
Before you're fucking dead
Before you're fucking dead

Pull this scarlet thread
Cut these scarlet threads
Unstitch all this dread
Before you're fucking dead

Your weary bones
Puncturing, puncturing, puncturing
Your flesh
Your weary bones
Exaggerate, exaggerate, exaggerate
Your end

I decide who will live and who will die
I decide when you die
I decide when you die
