I've heard it said that
Living is like licking honey from a thorn
And it makes me wonder
How often these thorns would adorn
My memories of you

I've heard enough in my day about idealistic romances
Held in high regard
I've seen enough in my day to know what you really are
What you really are

I've heard it said that
We accept the love we think we deserve
And it makes me wonder
What he ever did to deserve
A hell like you

I've heard enough in my day about
Idealistic romances
Self absorbed, over saturated
I've seen enough in my day to know what you really are
Under diagnosed, over medicated

I've seen enough in my day
Under diagnosed

With you it seems like, I'm always breaking oysters but never finding pearls

No matter what you say
You never try to find you way home at night
It seems like no matter what I say
My words will always pass you by

For you affection, is a violent infection
Burning through your flesh and bone
Ruining your home
For you, affection, is a violent infection
Ruining your home
