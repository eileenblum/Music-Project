I have seen the modern man
Mixing scripture into his vomit
I have been at the edge
Of my own existence
And it's hard to say that my perception
Will allow me to be blinded by your
White washed lies
Blinded by your white washed lies

The age of true emotion is dead
Corroding from the seams of everything I see
Lay this down to bed, rotting away
Lay this down to bed

Write a catchy hook, sink it deep
Who gives a fuck what it means
Sing the words, keep it clean
Never mind what they fucking mean
Who gives a fuck, it's all you'll ever be

From the seams of everything I see
Lay this down to bed, rotting away
Lay this down to bed

Write a catchy hook, sink it deep
Who gives a fuck what it means
Sing the words, keep it clean
Never mind what they fucking mean
Who gives a fuck, it's all you'll ever be

It's all you'll ever be
It's all you'll ever be

Write a catchy hook, sink it deep
Who gives a fuck what it means
Sing the words, keep it clean
Never mind what they fucking mean
Sing the words, keep it clean
Never mind what they fucking mean
Who gives a fuck, it's all you'll ever be
