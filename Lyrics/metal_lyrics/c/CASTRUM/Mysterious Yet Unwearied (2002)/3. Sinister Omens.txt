Cataclysm or catastrophe?
Who have the answer on it?
We feel the presence of something we can't understand
And it is here... to take us

What came with that storm
From the outer cold alien world
Breaking through to our reality
And sowing the fear in our hearts

Blinding circles are in the sky
Fools think that it is the second coming
But it is our end that draws near
It is the sinister omens

What hides in this strange light
That is flashing in the height
Blinding our eyes and frightening our minds
The foe, alien light

People are always fear the things
Which they does not understand
Someone even deify it
But there's no saviour or god
In this light in the sky
It came to destroy human race

In wait all fell in deafened silence
In wait for something that will happens soon
And blinding mysterious lights still shine
The unearthly sinister omens

And it had begun....
None shall survive this invasion....
