Imprisoned in the cell of thoughts
In the spheres of no return
Insensible, unconscious beings
The reincarnation of the human thoughts

The creatures of energetic structures
Fleshless beings of astral creation
Lighter than air, lighter than gas
Infest the primal spheres of space

In the dimension where frost is the king
And for warmth there's no place
The occult beings forever dwell
Dwell in countless astral spheres

People born, people live, people die
Buildings ruin by the sands of time
But dimensions are stand constantly
Without any changing in structures

The cold endless universal paths
Giant realm of molecular shadows
Forever hold the gates opened wide
To the great universal mystery
