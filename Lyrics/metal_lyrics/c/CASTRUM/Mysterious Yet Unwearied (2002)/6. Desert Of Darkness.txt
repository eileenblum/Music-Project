Climbing up to the hill
Under the shine of the silver eye
Revealing the ancient mysteries
Of the ancient forgotten times

Standing on the highest top
Beholding the lands around
I looked to the left -
Soulless desert rises in my sight

All is silent, all is dead
Only black sands under the light of the moon
Wrapped in mysterious mist
Of deadly rest and gloom

Like ocean of blackness
The desert lies in front of me
Behind the boards of mortals' world
Sad land of no return...

I descend to the bottom of the hill
And reach the boards of my world
Standing before the gates of darkness
Wandering what waits me beyond

The desert mesmerizes me
I hear its call in my subconsciousness
And trembling in fear...

I make my first step....
The darkness swallows me
Surrounds me like a stone wall
I trapped in nothingness
And doomed to roam
To roam in everlasting night...
