Existed short and futile
Lying, unfair and vile
A flock of germs, best in breed
Reloading the planet, regressing indeed

Unstoppable madness rules
Primitivism deeply improves

Globalization-mixation
Dignity's total termination
Liberty's asphyxiation
Money trouble domination

Cornucopia in non-existence
Here and there, in and out interference

Swarming fashionable mass ï¿½
Waste, no more nor less

Gentle fragrance of half-dead
Even blood is now not red

Wideness, so called complexity
Only outer forms diversity

Simplicity not far from ferocity
No limits to the world velocity
The speed increasing
The beast releasing....
