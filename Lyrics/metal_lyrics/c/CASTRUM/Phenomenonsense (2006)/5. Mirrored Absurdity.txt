Epochs gone, ages ahead
Cattle satisfied, humans misled

Honor threatened, children mutilated
Flesh in tribute, charity ill fated
Simplified complexity
In complied simplicity

Erased brains, unconscious minds
Bloodthirsty angels with knives behind
Silenced sounds, devastated veins
Feelings forgotten, firstborn pains

Weapons modified, purpose left
Words released, meaning bereft
Destinies faded, experience not learned
Nature embarrassed, innocence burned

Varied monotony
In monotonous variety

Lost liberty, mislaid obedience
Confused courage, gray brilliance
Envenomed eyes, empowered hands
Limited wishes, infinite offends

Voice deafened, whisper amplified
Dried burns, liquid solidifies
Spirits clenched, patience lost
Number of days, nothing to boast

Mirrored absurdity
In absurd of mirror
Victims counted, names unknown
Enemy changed, fury to be sown

Battle clarion heard, desires released
Fallen hair, bastards increased...
