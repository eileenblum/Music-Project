Sometimes they come back
Pictures of known age
Which are waiting on my advent
Bitter and cold land calls me
Mountains invoke my return

Shadows will slow the path
To gates... land of dreams
When the moons become connected
Extended will be powers
Undefined spells
They shall be only mine
Winds plead me to come back
To reach the path
Through temptation fo night
'Cause throne is alone
In cold eternal kingdom

I shall be returned through infinity
There... Where mountains reach the sky
Once more that I could see
How "Order Of Dragon"... arises

From the darkness we are sent

Visions of unknown whispers
Dusk brings silent words
And tries to remember me
That once I was there
In frozen land of sorrow
Where forever rules winter
Which I create with my departure
Ice... and eternal white horizons
Years are inaudible vanishing
Through dank and dark time
I will never find the gate
And the land of my past

In depths I heard them
Nocturnal children of dusk
Starve and plead for more
Insatiable hunger for mortal blood
In depths I deliver them
Toward heights of... sky.
Lunarshine
Will be my guide
A path to find
I rise from my burial-ground
They're crying my name
Immortal voices from the graves
And resound the same
When I was burnt in the eyes of death.
