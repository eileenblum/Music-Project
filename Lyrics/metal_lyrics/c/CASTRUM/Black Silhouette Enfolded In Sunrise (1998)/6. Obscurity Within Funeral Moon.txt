They come with shelter of sun
To desecrate master of night
With torches and poles
Slowly they descend by the stairs
In chambers of valets of death
Walking upon humidity and filth
Taking one of coffins
And dragging it on sunlight
I feel unbearable pain
By night grief rules the earth
And dark visits the land
Father I bewail you in infinity

Obscurity within funeral moon
My damnation above land so cold
Obscurity within funeral moon
Throne wrapped with eternal dusk

Overhelmed by suffering and lust for revenge
I stand on tower and invoke the ghosts
With dripping my blood I pronounce the blasphemy
Mystic words of my past and damnation

Children of death devilish sons
Phantoms of past give me the might
Traitors shall drown themselves in their own blood
Through moors they shall not see glimmer of hope

Accept my claim - kill the traitors
Leave desolation behind you
Like sign of devotion
Let fire eternal burn their icons
I want to hear their screams and see abbacy in flame

And when at last everything be over
Land shall fall asleep in dismalness and dust
Memories will be buried in time and mist
Somewhere between four stars
...of apocalyptic signs.
