It's very easy to live
Without thinking of death.
When each of us knows what to do
And is sure in all he has...
It's very hard to believe
In magic power of mind.
We try to see all things around,
But we never look inside.

Dreams of your native people,
Strength of your native land
Mostly depend of your life.
It begins from your heart,
From your soul,
From your mind...

We have to change our mind,
When all we do's always wrong.
Taking away our mistakes
We'll be ready to go on.
You never know what to do
For living well, being glad.
Trying to take all that you can,
You just have to don't forget
