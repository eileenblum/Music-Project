Leaves fall and touch the ground,
Cover all around
With brown coverlet.
Wind takes away ash of times.
Eternal's only lies
And there is nothing more

I forget all my dreams and desires
And fly away...

Night... Night has come again
And I feel the pain.
Pain inside my head.
I can't imagine how
My heart is empty now.
I am almost free.

I forget all my dreams and desires,
I lost myself.

When the skies fall
Seems like time is over.
The world is closing in,
The words are told.
I will find the way,
Nothing stops me ever...
My destination's glory in the world!

I forget all my dreams and desires,
I'll find myself.
