Close your eyes, set me free.
Let us see the heaven.
Hold on me and agree
That's we are lost together.

Playing dead we'll get much closer.
I will feel your every breath.
We shall melt that all is frozen
And will love until the end.

We are the ones...
We are the ones tonight...

I'm with you in my dreams
Both in joy and sorrow.
Wash away all my tears
Be ready for tomorrow.

Playing dead we'll get much closer.
I will feel your every breath.
We shall melt that all is frozen
And will love until the end.

We are the ones...
We are the ones tonight...
