Watchin' the stars
I felt so restless and so alone.
Buried my dreams
Into the shadows of your dark throne.

Give me back all you're keeping for me
Into this world.
And you'll see how I'm deadly forgotten
In this deepest sea.

We have returned
And from the dust new spirit is arising.
We have returned
Like rising sun our weapons brightly shining
Cause we have returned!

Trembling with cold,
I try to swim in the sea of time.
Against the tide
I hold on water trying to survive.

In the end sun is waiting for me
But I've got lost.
Set me free, hear my voice that's so close
In this deepest sea.
