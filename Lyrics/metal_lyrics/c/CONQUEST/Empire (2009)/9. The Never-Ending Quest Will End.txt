Storyteller wrote a secret
For a child who just was born.
Darkest curse or holy blessing
What he chose I'll never know.
Never forget those who create our fate,
Give a chance anyway.

I can fight my troubles,
I can win the battles,
I will raise my banner high
On my way into
Place back, where the rain grows,
Place, where wind blow through my face,
Where I will finally get.
Never ending quest will end.

Life is such a disappointment,
Troubles falling over me.
But the load upon my shoulder
Just a new chance to believe.
Never forget those, who create our fate,
Give a chance anyway.
