My soul is lost now among the neon lights.
Like a stone prison city is pressing me down.
I've found a picture which showed the eldest times.
I was excited watching my ancestors' town.
Hearing of that sound, feeling of that days
Makes me be stronger.

I wanna get power of ancient spirits.
I wanna hear the voices of Space.
Song of the wind, flame of magenta sunset
Show me the way to break all the chains.

My mind was looking for fairies to believe
But now my spirit's rising with wind to the sky.
This magic picture can really help to live.
The stars and moonlight show me the reason to fly.
Hearing of that sound, feeling of that days
Makes me be stronger.
