Open door in your tired heart
For Earth and Wind, for Water and Fire.
Try to touch the strength of them
And you'll become the part of Empire.

Live in the harmony
With all around you,
Let your soul
Make it's flight
And create
Your own way
Into Empire.

How to stay in our time
On way you chose? It's difficult question.
Cause there is a lot of those
Who want to make on us their pressure.
