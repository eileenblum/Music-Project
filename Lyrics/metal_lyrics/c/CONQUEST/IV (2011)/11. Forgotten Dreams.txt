Shadows of the past corrupt my mind
Point of no return was left behind

I still can feel you
Can hear your breathing
Things will never be the same
Release me

I cry, I cry for you, my friend
I'll try. I'll try to find the land of my forgotten dreams

I will fight untils the suns turn cold
I will triumph as it was foretold

No sence to judge me
My feats and blunders
I will find the way, I hope
For wonder

I cry, I cry for you, my friend
I'll try. I'll try to find the land of my forgotten dreams

Who could forgive me,
Remove the darkness
Who could make my soul alive and dauntless?
