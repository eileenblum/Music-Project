Be my light
Please, I beg you, be my light
I want you to shine my way

Winter night's
Never been so warm and bright
Heal me, take my pain away

I'm falling
I can't see your eyes
I'm falling
Give me my last chance to rise

Show your smile
Show your shy but shiny smile
I've been missing it, my dear
All the time
I was struggling through the lies,
Through the realms of doubt and fear

I'm falling
Try to understand
I'm falling
Save me now, I need your hand

[Refrain:]
When the nights are cold - let me warm you
When the darkness comes - let me break through the dark
When you fall asleep - let me guard your
Sweet and fairy dreams till dawn blows out the stars.

I'm falling
Try to understand
I'm falling
Save me now, I need your hand

[Refrain.]
