The smoke is rambling on the shining water
And songs of cannons glorify the death
The clash of steel is all you hear you're sentenced
And blood is running down the afterdeck
Battle rages on
And your hope is gone

[Chorus:]
Trapped in this hell your dying soul is trembling
Taste my soot, taste my blood
Nowhere to run now do you feel me breathing
On your back, time to die

The glowing sheets won't catch the wind of rescue
And broken mast can't hold your flag no more
The gallows pole is only dream you suffer
Again the living envy to the dead
Battle rages on
And your hope is gone

[Chorus]
