Feel that strange
Weakness of your hands. Itâs
Part of your
Human mold.

Free your rage,
Search for any chance to
Change the core
Of your soul.

Throw wicked flesh
To the pack of hounds.
Meet burning hell
And call it home.

Now your dreams
Spin like gear-wheels and
Fuel flows
Through your heart.

Wear the skin
Crafted from the steel and
Find your soul
Torn apart.

Alter your fate,
Change your destination.
Hunger and pain
Will light the way.

[Refrain:]
Let the rain
Wash away
Sins from your metal wings

Hold your breath
Let the death
Sing on your metal wings.

Alter your fate,
Change your destination.
Meet burning hell
And call it home.

[Refrain]
