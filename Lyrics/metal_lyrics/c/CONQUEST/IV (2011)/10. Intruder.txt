Cultivate grief and pain.
That is your sacred way.
Tears and nuclear rain
Watered your fields again.

[Bridge:]
Taste the smell of the burnt remains,
Know your real name,
Intruder.

[Refrain:]
Hatred and fear -
Enemy's near.
Swallow their dreams and gore, `cause the gods of war
Are watching.

Legions of damned
Heard your command,
Slaughtering more and more and the gods of war
Are watching you.

Those, who were doomed to die
Will never ask you why.
Throw out of burning mind
Echoes of children's cry

And the lips of the fallen will
Say your real name,
Intruder.

But the mother who'd lost her child
Cursed you real name,
Intruder

[Refrain]
