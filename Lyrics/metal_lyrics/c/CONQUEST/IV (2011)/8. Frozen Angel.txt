Life goes on
Right before my eyes
World of vice
And we keep it dying

Heaven burns in the children's cries
Roll the dice
As they keep on dying

Scared number of the beast I've seen
In the dirty hands of their false king

Slaves of flash
Lust is changing faith
Human race
Watch it keep on dying

War is near
Sacrifice your heart
Tear apart
Way it keeps you dying

The salvation for this world I've seen
In the power of their black king

Hear my farewell
Fallen soul forever stoned for all sins of the world
Caught by the spell
Covered with the snow pure heart longs for dawn
