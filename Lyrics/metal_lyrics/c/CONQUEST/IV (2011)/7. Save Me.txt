Time is rolling back my life
Who am I to all of you?
I can't decide.
Cut with the sharpest knife
All these moments we've been through
Left behind

In the ashes dreams remain
Waiting 'till another day

Home â another painful lie
Frozen flames of feelings gone
Dead inside
There I have lost your smile
Clear sky, where I belong
Guiding light

Can't you feel the past is gone?
Please, forget mistakes I've done

Save me fromm hell endless falling
Break midnight spell and I'll fly again
Can't see your face eyes are burning
I need your love to regain

In the darkness lives the pain
Every moment is the same
