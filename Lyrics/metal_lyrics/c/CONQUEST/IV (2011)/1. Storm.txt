Playing with fire
Gone up the skyline
Fearless desires
And freedom calls
Dreams, you've denied
Rised from the twilight
Sins you admired
And passion burns
The time is bluring
Now you have to go

[Chorus:]
Storm will set you free now
Even with your wings down
Hide the pain and stand still
Ride the winds of your will

Kissing the lightning
Lust you are hunting
Step on the sharp sting
To break the walls
Down in the highlights
Heaven in your eyes
Run to the sunrise
Before it blows
This flashing midnight
Will unite our minds

[Chorus]

Feel the sacred rainfall
In your mind and your soul
Strong enough to face God
Rise again for a new start
