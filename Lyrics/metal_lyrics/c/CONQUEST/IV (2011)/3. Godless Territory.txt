Black rain is falling
My blood running down the face
My execution
Darkness embrace

The last in line never forgiven
Stand on my knees rope on my neck
Last sacrifice try to believe in
Unspoken god

My temple burning
Still I smell the holy smoke
Stone walls are falling
Sign of the cross

The last in line never forgiven
Stand on my knees rope on my neck
Last sacrifice try to believe in
Unspoken god

Unholy
Unworthy
Condemned to madness
Forgotten
Denounced
Unspoken god ... Asp
