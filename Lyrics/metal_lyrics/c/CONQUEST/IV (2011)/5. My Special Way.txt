No one tries to understand my soul
No one lets me start again the show
I have chosen this role, I'll be there
Because I'm strong to go

Struggling hardly with myself each day
I'm still trying to accept my way
If I could only know,
Is there any place for me to go?

[Chorus:]
I wish (to) find my own way
Who knows, who can only say,
How hard (I'm) feeling each day!
But now's not like before
I feel really something more
I hear the voice of my own soul

Don't remind me who I was before
I can never be the same once more
My new goal for today's be myself
And realise my way

[Chorus]

I have lost my special way to live
I want it back

[Chorus]
