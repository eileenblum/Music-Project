Desert plain, swelter blows yoir brain
Raven's cry brake the sile ncrystal sky
River of time pass you by

One by one, leave the battlefield
Let them try, give just one chance to survive
Mercy will be glorified

The dance of death is over now ...silence
And taste of flesh for you (is) so sweet

Leave the tent, watch your banners high
Raise your bent carven warder and command
Power is paid by the pain

Rotten bones, faces carved in stone
Kings will fall, lost in twilight ...all is gone
Only the wise can remain

The dance of death is over now ...silence
And taste of flesh for you (is) so sweet

Pay the price with your own blood and soul, the damned one
Time has power over life no more, the dark one
Step into the world of shadows now, the phantom
Feel the beat of heart, which is your last
