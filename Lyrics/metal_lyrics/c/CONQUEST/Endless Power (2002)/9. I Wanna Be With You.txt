Nightmare came to me
Where's the light? I can not see
Madness in my head
I don't know I'm live or dead
I can not hear this voice
I wanna fly
All I need's to die

[Chorus:]
Nowhere and nowhere again
Now I can feel only pain
I can not live without you
I'll die without you, it's true
I wanna be without you

Lightning broke my mind
I can't fly - it's too high
When the candle fades
I can see your face
I feel your warm breath
On my leaps
All I have - these dreams

[Chorus.]
[Solo: W. Angel]
[Chorus.]
