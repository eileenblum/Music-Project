I saw the sunrise in the sky
It was so long
So many years I couldn't find
The magic crown
The crown of woman of the night
Beyond this world
Of woman who came in my life

[Chorus:]
I've seen you in my dreams
and I wanna be with you forever
I need you, stay with me
Just touch my skin, Just take my soul
Into hell.

Your arms are cold your eyes are dark,
Lady Night
You drift inside my gloomy mind
Like ray of light
You'll take my mind so far away
From real world
Into your kingdom I'm your slave

[Chorus.]
[Solo: A. Zakharov]
[Chorus.]
