Way that you chose is hard
Fear and pain
But this campaign of blood
Won't be win
Gods have blessed you for the feat
We'll give up our lives for Motherland

[Chorus:]
Riding through the night
Like our forefathers
We can win this fight
And any others
When we'll all unite
In ancient tower
We will feel again
Our endless power

Spirit of ancient days
Appealed to you
There's many different ways
One is true
This is way we have to go
Fighting till the end
We'll give up our lives for Motherland

[Chorus.]
[Solo: W. Angel]
