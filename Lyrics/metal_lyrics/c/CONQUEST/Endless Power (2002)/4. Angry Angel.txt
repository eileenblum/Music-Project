Night is falling on the Earth
Will ever show life light of day?
It's the end but where is source?
Why did the sunbeam go away?
Do you remember time when sky was blue?
It seems these days will never true...

Chorus:
Angry Angel spread his wings across the sky
And world's immersed in endless night
Moon is coldly shining, sun will never rise
Forgotten world is gonna die under ice

Take your sword and take your shield
When we're together - we are strong
Enemies had burnt your fields
We're waiting for revenge so long
Do you remember time where sky was blue?
It seems these days will never true...

[Chorus.]
[Solo: A. Zakharov]
