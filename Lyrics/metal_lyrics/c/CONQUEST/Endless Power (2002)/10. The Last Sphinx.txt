So many years ago the sphinxes ruled the world
But people came here and the Earth became so cold
The sphinxes fell and people turned them into stone
But one of them survived and he's forever gone

I hear the flap of mighty wings
I know it's sole survivor sphinx

[Chorus:]
The sphinx returned
He's flying through the times
The fires burnt
Into the brilliant eyes
He's back again
The Legend came alive
The holy flame
Is burning in the skies

He went away but people stole the holy gold
And he decided to come back in wicked world
He spread his wings and raised his head into the air
The lion's paws stand strong the wind flutter the hair

And he's returning in this world
To guard his diamonds and his gold

[Chorus.]
[Solo: W. Angel - A. Zakharov - W. Angel - A. Zakharov]
[Chorus.]
