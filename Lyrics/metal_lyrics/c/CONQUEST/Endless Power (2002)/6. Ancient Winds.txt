Time. It's time to open your own eyes
Gods will accept your sacrifice
Turn around - bloody faces grinning to you
Groaning world is waiting for you

[Chorus:]
Ancient winds are blowing
They're asking where you going
Lightings show your way
You can not stay
Shining stars are crying
Damned world is dying
Abyss calls your name
Universe in flame

Time, it's time to bring here a miracle
Try, you must try but it's so difficult
Turn around - acid rains are falling down
And now you have to save the Earth

[Chorus.]
[Solo: W. Angel]
[Chorus.]
