Clouds, the snow and steam above
I can't see the way to go
It's so cold, my life is fading out
I scream but I can't hear my shout

[Chorus:]
When I've died I've seen the light
Shining through the endless night
I've seen the flames, chain on my neck
I don't want this. I'm flying back

Way of saint is always hard
It's a tune inside my heart
Take my hand, let legend come alive
You'll see the man who has survived

[Chorus.]
[Solo: A. Zakharov]
[Chorus.]
