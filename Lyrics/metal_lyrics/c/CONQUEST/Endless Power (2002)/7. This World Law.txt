The years are passing by
And Earth is growing old
The minutes fly away
Like arrows in the air
So many faces I saw in this world
So many things are gone and really I don't care

[Bridge:]
But only death plays another game
A game without habitual rules
No turning back, it's the only way
The way that's so cruel

[Chorus:]
But stars are the same
And moonlights illuminates
The mountains with peaks
In the snow
And oceans of sand
Cry under the hottest sun
IT'S happening by
This world law

The world wars of our time
Are a flash of universe
The floods and whirlwinds
As a few drops in the sea
Somebody's hand is turning
The pages of old book
Somebody's fingers make our life and destiny

[Bridge.]
[Chorus.]
[Solo: W. Angel]
[Bridge.]
[Chorus.]
