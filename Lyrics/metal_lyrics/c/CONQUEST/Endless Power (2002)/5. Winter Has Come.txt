Winter has come and this snow will be forever
Clouds above, and I'm alone
But every time I will fly with wind together
I'll forget who I am
Wings of light put me up to stars
And I see they are crying

So many years whisper tells me what to do
I was ray of the moonlight
But in my dreams shadows bring me back to you
Dreams disappears pain is staying here...
Wings of light put me up lo stars
And I see - they are crying

[Chorus:]
Take me to the heaven and never let me go
Let me see the Angels that loved me so
Clouds will be dispersed to show me the way
To my soul

[Solo: W. Angel]
[Chorus.]
