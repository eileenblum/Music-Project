These hateful sounds of war
Just irritate my ears
The fire clouds in the sky
And nature disappears

[Bridge:]
Just think about it before it's done
Don't let these dreadful nightmares come

[Chorus:]
Depth of oceans and mountain's height
You can make them to live or to die
You should do for them something good
If you can
Burning forest, tears fall as rain
Animals scream because of the pain
Do you wanna see it again and again?

Catastrophes of this world
Threat of the nuclear blast
Hey human use your chance
Because the death is fast

[Bridge.]
[Chorus.]
[Solo: W. Angel - A. Zakharov - W. Angel]
[Chorus.]
