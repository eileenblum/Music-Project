We're living in the twilight time
When truth is lie and lie is fine
Innocent martyrs are living in hell
Who can break this spell?

Earth! What is happening with your kids?
We have to stop these dirty deeds
Mankind is falling monsters on top
Madness has to stop

[Chorus:]
Shine my sword like the sun
Lead me forward
Drink the enemy's blood
Smash everyone

Men! Don't you see we're occupied?
We can not hide we have to fight!
Someday we'll win and world will be free
It's our destiny.

[Chorus.]
[Solo: A. Zakharov - W. Angel]
