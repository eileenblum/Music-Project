Since you were born nightmares tortured your soul
And the Sandman often came in your sleepless nights
Deadly fearing human brittle life, you were just
Growing numb and stiffen like a piece of ice

What was your curse, where've you immersed
In your last life that you can't remember?
What do you see paying the fee
Feeling the taste of your tear?

It's your temple of fear

Growing older you perceived the being
Of this doleful life that's keeping brining you down
Gone insane you started killing people
So the circle locked and burdened you with its crown

What was your curse, where've you immersed
In your last life that you can't remember?
What do you see paying the fee
Feeling the taste of your tear?

It's your temple of fear
