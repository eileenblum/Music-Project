Closed door before my eyes
I will never find the way to paradise
More and more I see the light
But ravens are discouraging my sight

I will fly forever in the sky
And I will never die
I'm flying in the rain

Still holding on the fire strong
But inside me my dream is gone
The sense of words leads to the end
I'm leaving now this cruel land

I will fly forever in the sky
And I will never die

Fly away higher and higher
Fly away from here
Far away, so far away
Only angels near

[SOLO]
[CHORUS]

Fly away
Fly away
I'm flying in the rain
