About now to hold the night
I need you, become my light

So many years I've been searching for true
Finally found only you

To nowhere my road leads
Coming down, down to defeat

Show me the path to the glorious fate
Got no more ways through this gate

I will walk in the shadows of majestic trees
Mending all I've done wrong by my hands
Higher time for me to get inspired by peace
Treading down all the roads and trends

[SOLO]

Show me the path to the glorious fate
Got no more ways through this gate

[CHORUS]
