Doubts overfilling my soul and my mind
There's no more ways to avoid this torture
Torment goes on as I'm falling apart
Who'll tell me what is the will of fortune?

When the sky was deep and so blue
I in the clouds flew

My stumbling block is my way of disgrace
Made by myself for the sins committed
Tighten a rope that leads up to the end
Spirit is leaving my flesh mistreated

When the sky was deep and so blue
I in the clouds flew

Oh, life, let me go, I want to feel this freedom
Flying high free my soul and to hear mighty call of frozen sky

[SOLO]

When the sky was deep and so blue
I in the clouds flew

Oh life, let me go, I want to feel this freedom
Flying high free my soul ain't no more place for
Oh life, let me go, I want to feel this freedom
Flying high free my soul
And to hear mighty call of frozen sky
