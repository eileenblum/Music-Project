Moonlight dancing on the wall
I keep my pain inside my soul
I tried to call you in the night
There's still confusion in my mind

Shadows take me back to you
Will you ever make it true?
I remember your sweet smile
And all I can is just to cry

Don' tell me farewell

Sunshine makes me blind again
Darkness brings me to the pain
Now you're an angel in the sky
And all what's left is just to cry

Don't tell me farewell

[CHORUS]
[SOLO]

Now my fairytale begins
Flying high I spread my wings
I'll find you in my sweetest dream
My love is shining like sunbeam

Don't tell me farewell
