Menace is near bringing the fear
Baptism of fire begins
Byzantine sword is put to our throat
No way to take their faith

Start out the holy war
Die, save your soul

Now the War beast comes
And we'll never turn around
Gods will lead our rows right where the victory grows
Now the War beast comes
And we'll never turn around
We won't fall apart shielded by justice of god
Forever just War beast

Mighty Perun, we are your sons
We are applying to you
Give us your strength for bloody revenge
Our purpose is our truth

Cry out the battle call
Go free your soul

[CHORUS]

[SOLO]

Start out the holy war
Go save your soul

[CHORUS]
