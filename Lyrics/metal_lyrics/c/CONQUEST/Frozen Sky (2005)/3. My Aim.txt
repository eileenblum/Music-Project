Doomed for so long I was longing for something real
Something that could bring the use of my life
Opposing the stream reaching the sense of being
I tried my best to understand

Someday I will find you
With the next step I will make
Somehow I'll get to you
On the last breath I will take

Frantic with pain going under the sea and desert
Never complained of the almighty fate
Anyhow I'll face my aim that came from forward
At the horizon we'll embrace

Someday I will find you
With the next step I will make
Somehow I'll get to you
On the last breath I will take

Anyhow I'll face my aim that came from forward
At the horizon we'll embrace

Someday I will find you
With the next step I will make
Somehow I'll get to you
On the last breath I will take
