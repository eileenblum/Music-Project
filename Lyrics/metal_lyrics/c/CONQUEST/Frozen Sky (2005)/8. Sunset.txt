Sun is dropping, I touch it with my fingertips
Like the heaven is pouring blood upon my lips
I have closed my eyes, but still I see the skies

Verifying its promises to set me free
Wind is crying and quietly mourning over me
I forgot my home the place where I was born

Remember your glance from far away
So desperate gaze now I pray
So tired and amazed I'll walk this way

[SOLO]

I forgot my home the place where I was born

Remember your glance from far away
So desperate gaze now I pray
So tired and amazed I'll walk this way

In silence your voice whispers to me
So long I was blind and now I see
A cold desert dawn is calling me

Verifying its promises to set me free
Wind is mourning over me
