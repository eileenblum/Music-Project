"When you drive, you practice mindfulness of driving. It is possible. When you stop at a red light, you look at the red light and smile. You look at the red light, you smile, and you breathe in and out, and sit back, relaxingly. Breathing in, I calm myself. Breathing out, I smile."

"And the red light become a friend, become a bell of mindfulness. Something unpleasant become something pleasant. We have the habit energy of wanting to arrive. That is why we want to go as quickly as possible. But according to this practice, we arrive at every moment. Life can be found only in the present moment. Everything that we look for must be found in the present moment. Peace. Joy. Happiness. Buddha. The kingdom of God."

"What is our final destination? If we abandon the present moment, our final destination may be our death. We don't want to arrive there, we want to go in the direction of life."

"This concludes Tape 1, A Retreat on the Practice of Mindfulness. Our program continues with Tape 2."
