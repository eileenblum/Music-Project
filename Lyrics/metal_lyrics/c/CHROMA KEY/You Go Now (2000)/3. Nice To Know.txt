Saw her at a red light
Headlights flashing like shooting stars
In the fast lane like an airplane

Never saw the tail light
Windshield cracked like an insight
Was a long flight but i'm alright now

I can tell you're falling
It's nice to know
I can tell you're falling
It's nice to know

Oh no there you go
Now i won't be home for the late show
Sorry about the window what a nice throw

Sometimes i can see
That you finally got me where you want me
Guess i can't complain though
'cause i can't go home

I can tell you're falling
It's nice to know
I can tell you're falling
It's nice to know
