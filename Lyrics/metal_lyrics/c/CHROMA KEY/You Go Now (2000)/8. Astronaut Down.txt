You look so mysterious
But you sound so serious
You should have told me on the phone
I'm sorry i'm sorry i don't know what i'm saying

I guess you tried to let me know
By leaving notes on the stereo
It's not the typical way to go
I'm sorry i'm sorry i don't know what i'm saying

'cause i found myself
Back in the bachelor scene
Feel like an astronaut
In a submarine
If i fall asleep
I could fall out of bed
Maybe the helmet helps
But it hurts my head

Let's not get hysterical maybe you need a sabbatical
You get so angry when you're wrong
I'm sorry i'm sorry i don't know what i'm saying

You know it came as quite a shock to find your note in the cereal box
And why'd you have to change the locks
I'm sorry i'm sorry i don't know what i'm saying

And i found myself
Back in the bachelor scene
Feel like an astronaut
In a submarine
If i fall asleep
I could float out of bed
Maybe the ceiling helps
But it hurts my head

Cause i found myself
Back in the bachelor scene
Feel like an astronaut
In a submarine
If i fall asleep
I could fall out of bed
Maybe the helmet helps
But it hurts my head
