It was five o'clock 'cause i checked my watch
When i woke back up on the subway
And i missed my stop it was 10 blocks back
But i liked my seat so i kept it
And i'm still surprised that you stayed with me
'till my first mistake of the century
It was so extreme i controlled my dreams
With the radio and the late show
