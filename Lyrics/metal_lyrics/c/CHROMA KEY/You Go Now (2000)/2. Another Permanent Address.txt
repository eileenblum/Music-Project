Sometimes i wanna sleep in the street
But it feels a little funny without you
Down in the basement feeling the pavement
Holding my stomach

And sometimes i can't believe my own feet
So i found another permanent address
Sold the old mattress keeping the changes
Talking to strangers

I knew i could forget you
That's what i'm gonna do
Now i'm staring at a stop sign
Just like the last time

Hey you're everything you dreamed you'd be
What a civilized way to be angry
Locked in the attic, starting to panic
Wait, that's me

Always it's the same situation
It's got to be somebody's fault
But i never know what to do
So let's say we put the blame on you

Standing in a phone booth
Waiting for the punch line
Trying not to call you
Just like the last time

Sometimes i wanna sleep in the street
But it feels a little funny without you
Down in the basement feeling the pavement
Holding my stomach in

And sometimes i can't believe my own feet
So i found another permanent address
Sold the old mattress keeping the changes
Talking to strangers

I knew i could forget you
That's what i'm gonna do
Now i'm staring at a stop sign
Just like the last time
