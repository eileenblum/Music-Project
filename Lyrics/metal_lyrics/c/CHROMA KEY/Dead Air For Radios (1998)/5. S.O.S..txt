Fly blackbird fly
Frozen the sea i see you
Old cover clouds    new snow    there they go

Silent but wings
Sun orange small i see you
Nowhere is home    go alone    and alone

Fly angel fly
Older than me i feel you
Coalcovered clouds    white snow    there you go

Heard myself call
Far from them all i feel you
Left them behind    or ahead    and he said

Sooner or later you get up off the floor
When no one wants to hear it anymore
Someday soon you're gonna get up off the floor
'cause no one wants to hear that shit

Cry blackbird cry    over the waves i hear you
Coalcovered clouds    white snow    there they go
Ice on your wings    songless he sings i hear you
Nowhere is home    go alone    there's a phone
