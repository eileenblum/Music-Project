Tell me something stupid
Auction off my diary
Life is getting esoteric
Let me in your movie
Each time i walk out the door
Someone mixes metaphors
Life is so much cleaner on the page

It's like the morning when i'm dreaming
And everything is so pristine
It's just a seven hour movie
And i'm in every scene

Let me in my t.v.
Get this tape to tori
Got to have a subplot
When i sell them my life story
Maybe i should write it first
And do the living later
'cause life is so much cleaner on the page

It's like the time i lost my body
And then i saw it on t.v.
Somehow it shed a whole dimension
But it still looked like me
(hey! that looks like me!)

Each time i write lines for it
Someone improvises it
Life is so much cleaner on the page
Life is so much cleaner on the page
