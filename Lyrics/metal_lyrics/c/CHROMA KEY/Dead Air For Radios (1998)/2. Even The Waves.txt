Me &amp; judas lost at sea
Under electric twilight fading
I look at him he sees through me
40 days and we're still waiting

I'm not tired but i think i'll lay back anyway
I'm not welcome but i think i'll stay

Me &amp; jonas lost at sea
Deep inside a dream we're trailing
Heard him whisper wait for me
Sun goes down and we're still sailing

I'm not nervous but i think i'll lay back anyway
I'm not helpless but i think i'll stay
And even the waves won't carry me away

Keep heading west    that's the best
May be lost but i'm not crazy
Stay where you are    not too far
Keep it up you're doing fine
Well i thought i was fine

Me &amp; joseph lost at sea
Under rain and slowly waking
He looks around and smiles at me
41 and we're still waiting

I'm not tired but i think i'll lay back anyway
I'm not hopeless but i think i'll stay
And even the waves won't carry me away
