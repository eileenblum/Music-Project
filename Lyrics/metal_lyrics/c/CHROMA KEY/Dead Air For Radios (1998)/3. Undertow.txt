Last night    hit the net
Woke up    in a sweat
Same scene    different dream    sudden ending

Grabbed a pillow and covered my head
Kicked the phone off the side of the bed
Tried to sing but the damn thing kept on ringing

I know
I'll go to mexico
Someplace nothing changes
Maybe i'll call on the phone
Maybe i'll write you a letter
That's what i meant when i said goodbye

Backed the shovelhead out of the shed
Hit the interstate hard heading left
The street below is water flowing undertow

There's a song that i'd rather forget
But i don't think i've shaken it yet
As soon as i do
I'm gonna write us another one

I know
I'll go to mexico
Someplace nothing changes
Maybe i'll call on the phone
Maybe i'll write you a letter
That's what i meant when i said goodbye

I know
I'll go to mexico
Someplace nothing changes
Maybe i'll call on the phone
Maybe i'll write you a letter
Maybe i'll die    maybe i'll learn how to fly
That's what i meant when i said
