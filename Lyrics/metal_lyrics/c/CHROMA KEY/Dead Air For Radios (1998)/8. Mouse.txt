(now, now I know I'm not crazy. the fucking mouse, the mouse is back again. and I got him here, mother fff - he's in the fucking radiator. this prick, and he's lay - he's eating a fucking Dorito. and I can't get him. and he's looking at me, and he'll still eat the Dorito. he's behind the fucking - i'm gonna fucking kill him. this is war. now this is war. now watch what happens.) [Todd Farrington]

Took the flower back
His wayward love had been mislead
The sun is dying
Apologies she can't accept
Check the window quick
The sun is dying
Blue and red of day to purple night
And absent light to disarray
Took the flower back
His wayward love had been mislead
The sun is dying
Apologies she won't accept
Check the window quick
The sun is dying
A candle marks her tears
The flame will fade
She'll greet the dawn in disarray
She steps into the stream the level rising
She steps into the stream the level rising
Took the flower back
His wayward love had been misled
The level's rising
Steps into the stream
We're so misled
She'll watch the pain the level's rising
Blue and reds of day to purple night
And absent light to disarray
She steps into the stream the level rising
She steps into the stream the level rising
She steps into the stream the level rising
She steps into the stream the level rising
