I was half outside and half inside a dream
When i thought i heard your voice on my machine
Sang along    had the song    almost memorized
Liked the track    so i laid back    and let it fossilize

(i've got all of this on video
It just gets better every episode)

America    i was blind but now i see
America    right there in front of me

Lost my head in my hotel room when the ground shook
Had to choose between the bible and the phone book

You're never home but that's okay
It's so much easier that way
'cause i can't tell it to your face in real time anyway

America    i was blind but now i see
America    right there in front of me

And it makes no sense to me
Unless i see it on t.v.
So just launch that satellite
And get it right

America    i was blind but now i see
America    right there in front of me

And it makes no sense to me
Unless i see it on t.v.
So just launch that satellite
And get it right

(sometimes the answer just comes)
