On a beach twenty yards from the roadside
Back again 6 AM far from sleep
Must be 290 blue on the water
It's gray to me 3 CV is all I see

Green can only hold you in the garden
Too much red will go right to your head
But if it's all the same to you
Give me back my blue
Other colors fade anyway

I'm colorblind    three way tragedy
Pantone memory    grayscale eyes
Maybe i'm paranoid    yeah that's my problem
You almost have to be    when you look like me

Stopped in the shade of a road sign
When the sun rose like a bomb
Tried to read the simple writing
But the letters came out wrong
It's all white lines to me
But things are getting clearer
I can almost read the writing in the mirror

I'm colorblind    three way tragedy
Pantone memory    grayscale eyes
Maybe i'm paranoid    yeah that's my problem
You almost have to be    when you look like me

Green can only hold you in the garden
Too much red will go right to your head
But if it's all the same to you
Give me back my blue
Other colors fade anyway

I'm colorblind    freeway tragedy
Pantone memory    x-ray eyes
Where'd all the color go    on my radio?
You almost have to be    a satellite to see.
