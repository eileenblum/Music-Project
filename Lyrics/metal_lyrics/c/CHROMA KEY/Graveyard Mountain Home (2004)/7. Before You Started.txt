Before you started calling, I'd walk to the phone
Now I never never walk, cause I know you're never home

(no one's home I guess, no one's home ring ring)

Baby's always comin' round don't that feel nice
Baby's always comin' round ain't the great?
My sugar's always comin' by just in time man
Here she comes now baby it's too late

I thought you had enough of me, I thought you had enough of me
I thought you had enough of me, I thought you had enough of me
I thought you had enough of me, I thought you had enough of me
