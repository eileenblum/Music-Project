My mistake is never knowing, by mistake I keep on going
Love is in the room but I don't know it, love is in the sails but I kept rowing

Sad sad movie, sad sad movie, sad sad movie, I see that now

My mistake is never knowing, by mistake I keep on going
Love is on the rails but I'm still rolling
Love is on the lawn but I keep mowing

Sad sad movie, sad sad movie
Sad sad movie, I see that now
