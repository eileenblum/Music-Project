Master of the mind
Promise to be kind
Dense crows you can't see
Desperate and blinded by greed

Weary nocturnal death
While praying to these gods
Precious brighted last breath
Striking you down one by one

Savior carried the light
While you locked out the night
Laughs and joy had just begun
Haze grew dense, blocked out the sun

Weary nocturnal death
While praying to these gods
Precious brighted last breath
Striking you down one by one

Turn to your haven, lumen
Turn to your savior in need
Chant the words
Spare us, spare us
The sun no longer sets you free

Weary nocturnal death
While praying to these gods
Precious brighted last breath
Striking you down one by one

Turn to your haven, lumen
Turn to your savior in need
Chant the words
Spare us, spare us
The sun no longer sets you free
Free, free
