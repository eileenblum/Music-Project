There was no helping hand to hold me back
The night I found the pungent binding black
A sea of lust and strife once showed the way
But now you're left outside, no words to say

Hypnotic...
Mesmeric...

Rapture
Save us

Rapture
Brave us

Obsession of the gold and forests green
No longer shows, you should in time foresee

A sea so dark turn to delusive hope
There is not much time left, cut off the rope

Rapture
Oh, save us

Rapture
Oh, brave us
