Soaked in helpless matter of your own
Learn to worship chaos, premature
Soul rubs you blind
Death please be kind
Angel from below
Teach us what to show

Hold me
Set me free
You can't do it on your own
Hold me
Set me free

We're here by the end of all we know
Sister, father, mother it's time to go

I see the light with my weary eyes

Hold me
Set me free
You can't do it on your...

Hold me
Set me free
You can't do it on your own

Hold me
Set me free
Hold me
Set me free

You can't do it on your
You can't do it on your
You can't do it on your
Own...
