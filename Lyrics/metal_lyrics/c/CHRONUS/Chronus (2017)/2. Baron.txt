Live too fast
For you to last
This lifetime

Death around
With him you found
Your last day

Real life changes

Lost,
You fade away
Power is not yours
Lost again
And you fade away
Evident, you want more

Simpletons
On your knees
For nothing

Think again
Do not pretend
It's thrusting

Lost,
You fade away
Power is not yours
Lost again
And you fade away
Evident, you want more

Real life changes
