Reach for spiritual needs
Avoid calamity
Breathe, live only to die
Look to maternal sky

Is this the end?
Look to!

City of light
Fallen
In its own right
Again

Mind dwells deep
Secrets I know you keep
Lack of rejoice
You've got no choice
When you have fallen from eternal skies

Strife til you reach from colour to bleach
When you reveal the pity and the dust

City of light
Fallen
In its own right
Again
