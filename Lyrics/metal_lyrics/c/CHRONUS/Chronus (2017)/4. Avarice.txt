Frail bones are crumbling
The strongest arise
Vigorous shoulders
Leaves you traumatized

Into the dust
And all of its weight
Sitting down i ponder
Is it still too late?

I want it all
I want it now
To be part of patience
I want it all
Luck won't ever leave
Open the door
Lead me ashore
To be part of patience
I want it all

Teach them to listen
Teach them to speak
Hear to their wisdom
Change may be unique

Perhaps they hold the secret
The one and dire key
Times of desperation
Chimes with culprit needs

I want it all
I want it now
To be part of patience
I want it all
Luck won't ever leave
Open the door
Lead me ashore
To be part of patience
I want it all
Luck won't ever leave

You will not understand
You will not understand
You will not understand

I want it all
I want it now
To be part of patience
I want it all
Luck won't ever leave
Open the door
Lead me ashore
To be part of patience
I want it all
Luck won't ever leave
