Have I lost my mind I'm suffocating, it's killing me and I can't face it
Will I ever learn enough is enough
I count these scars and wonder what have I become

Looking at me, now tell me what do you see
Feel like I lost control, but I won't let you see through me
I let you get too close, I don't care how hard I try
These walls are caving in and you're not getting out alive

These scars are tearing me apart and I can't hide what I've become inside
Cause I've got an appetite for sin, I'm self destructing
And I wanna take another hit, but I'm drowning, drowning

Strip me of everything on the surface I've become so artificial
I just wanna feel something real, can you blame me
Somebody save me from myself
Cause you were drowned out like the ocean waves
And now you're drifting away
Turn me inside out so that I can see what's become of me

I'm drowning in the waves and I can't take the weight
This is the start of the end, the bitter taste of regret
The wolves are at my door waiting to come inside
I sold my soul and now I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind
I lost myself
This isn't what I'm meant to be
Who's gonna save me now
I lost myself
This isn't what I'm meant to be
No, no

Strip me of everything on the surface, I've become so artificial
I just wanna feel something real, can you blame me
Somebody save me from myself
Cause you were drowned out like the ocean waves
And now you're drifting away
Turn me inside out so that I can see what's become of me

I've got an appetite for sin
I'll self-destruct until there's nothing left
