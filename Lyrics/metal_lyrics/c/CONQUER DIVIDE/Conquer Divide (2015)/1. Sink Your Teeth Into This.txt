[feat. Denis Stoff]Hell-bent on the past, I'll become a martyr for your cause
True revenge, so here's to the friends I've lost

You took what you could get at my expense
So I'll burn the only bridge that you have left
And now you're wondering why you and I are through
Cause sorry is a word that you never knew

This foundation crumbled to the dust
I got up and brushed it off
I guess you thought you were flawless, hypocrite
Talk is cheap so put your money where your mouth is
Look at me now; can you stand to see what I've become? (What I've become)
Follow the masses and fall
All will fall, the war is won

How does it feel to know you threw it away
As you watch my dreams come true?
How does it feel to hear 'em screaming my name?
But they won't remember you
You put the knife right in my back
And you lost the best thing you never had, oh

Cast the first stone, we both know it was easy for you
Let it sink in, I built an empire from the stones that you threw

I maintained my pride in the face of men
Draw me out of nothingness to make me what I am
I guess you walk the path of righteousness
I hope you drown in the water under the bridge

(Today)

I've been searching for a reason why
Today you turned your back on me
You used up all my loyalty
And then lied to me (Yeah)

How does it feel to know you threw it away
As you watch my dreams come true?
How does it feel to hear 'em screaming my name?
But they won't remember you
You put the knife right in my back
And you lost the best thing you never had, oh

There are seventy-two thousand
Five hundred and nineteen stones in my walls
Today you turned your back on me
You used up all my loyalty, loyalty
Another lie, another fake friend
Look at me now, can you stand to see what I've become?
