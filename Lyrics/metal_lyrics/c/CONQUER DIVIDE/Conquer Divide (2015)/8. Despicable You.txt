Transparency behind those eyes
I see your twisted lies, can you feel the tension?
Oh, so high on your vanity, you lost all your humanity
When you sold me out and you let me down

You know I think I got you figured out
You look at people as obstacles to climb
They say girls like you are overrated
And I see this all the time (Don't think I didn't notice)
Can't you tell that they're laughing at you?
Do you even care?
Well if it wasn't for your body and your fake smile
Girl, you would never get anywhere

She can't break away from what she'll never be
So she'll run away but her demons consume her
They won't stop until she's sucking the life out of every victim
Chew 'em up and spit 'em out
She's dug her last grave with no means to break free
How can someone so shallow fall so fucking deep

You started a fire but you're afraid of the flames
You don't know the rules so you cheated the game
You're hypocritical, fucking despicable
And you are a walking contradiction
Act like a god but you reek of deception
You brought this on yourself

You think you've got it all (It all)
Your character is forged
But honey, you've got it all wrong
You're rotten to the core

I know she's gonna play the victim again
Just to see how far she can get
She'll put on her mask and reel 'em in close
But it's all mirrors and smoke (You're poisonous)
But now you don't have a friend in the world
Go on and take a bow (They're gonna give you a test)
And don't come crying to me girl
Your time's up, show's over now

I saw you infect them like a plague
Bring them up to tear them down and watch them suffocate
It's not over yet so you better think again
Here comes the storm, you better learn how to swim

You started a fire but you're afraid of the flames
You don't know the rules so you cheated the game
You're hypocritical, fucking despicable
And you are a walking contradiction
Act like a god but you reek of deception
You brought this on yourself

Someday you'll find yourself and wish you hadn't (Open your eyes)
The consequence of being hollow (So hollow)
And you tried to bring the wool down over my eyes (My eyes)
A betrayal that was hard to swallow (Take a bow)

Someday you'll find yourself and wish you hadn't
But I've already figured you out
Same old story, come on, lie to my face with a smile
And don't apologize
