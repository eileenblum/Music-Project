I'll walk on water and you'll say it's cause I can't swim
You never fail to judge but all you know is how to quit
Ten years of blood, sweat and tears
Success is never easy, you think it just appears?

"It's just another gimmick, manufactured image
So generic, it just fell out the sky
They must have gotten lucky", you pretend to know the story
We've heard it all before so let's see you fucking try
We've heard enough of this, we gave up our lives for this
You don't know the half of it, so keep talking, talking shit

Heads held high
We don't care what they say this is the time of our lives
Eyes open wide
We're running circles 'round the game as they're falling behind
So everybody sing it with me
And don't stop till your lungs give out
Everybody sing it with me
Heavy is the head that wears the crown

Let me shed some light on the hate that you're spreading
You think you're doing damage; that's the point you're not getting
So let your insecurities belittle what is mine
Cause at the end of the day, I'm the one with the mic

You're just another hater, condescending motivator
Someday it will come back and eat you alive
You know your words will shatter, cause you can't meet your standards
So just get back in line

So let's hear another line that's been played out
You're like a broken record (We've heard it all before)
And there's no way your words will ever bring us down
(We'll keep our heads held high)

Heads held high
We don't care what they say this is the time of our lives
Eyes open wide
We're running circles 'round the game as they're falling behind
So everybody sing it with me
And don't stop till your lungs give out
Everybody sing it with me
Heavy is the head that wears the crown

Let's debunk your fucking fiction
No one put a gun to your head and made you listen
Another point that you keep missing
Until you walk in these shoes, no one cares what you do
Haters, no one cares what you do
You didn't see all the times that we tried and fucking failed
Just to keep this spark of a dream alive

How can you say you see through our eyes
When you can't even see through your pride?
And if you think you know where we have been
You better think again
Cause you're only on the outside looking in
Yeah, yeah (We'll keep our heads held high)

Heads held high
We don't care what they say this is the time of our lives
Eyes open wide
We're running circles 'round the game as they're falling behind
So everybody sing it with me
And don't stop till your lungs give out
Everybody sing it with me
Heavy is the head that wears the crown

Haters, no one cares what you do
