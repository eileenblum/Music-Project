I wish that I could end this but I'm too afraid to try
Afraid to try, and I wanna scream

I feel it in my lungs, in every breath I take
In my bones, in my heart, with every smile I fake
The look of dead eyes, the fear, the lies and this disguise
And I feel it in my blood and it makes me numb

I wish that I could end this but I'm too afraid to try
And I don't know what to say to you if you wanted to know why
I wish that things were easier but the stars are not aligned
And my heart can't survive, the pain let's me know that I'm alive

Something surrounding me, pulled under and I can't breathe
Reflections lie to me, I see what they don't see
The look of dead eyes, the fear, the lies and this disguise
And I feel it drowning me and I wanna scream

I wish that I could end this but I'm too afraid to try
And I don't know what to say to you if you wanted to know why
I wish that things were easier but the stars are not aligned
And my heart can't survive, the pain let's me know that I'm alive

And I was broken
But now I'm standing on my own, a new moment to begin
The scars of our past don't have to hold us back
But I'm addicted to the way you make me feel and
I'll never understand, you'll never understand

(And I wanna scream)

I wish that I could end this but I'm too afraid to try
And I don't know what to say to you if you wanted to know why
I wish that I could hate you but I cannot live a lie
And my heart can't survive (My heart can't survive)

I wanted to stop breathing but I'm too afraid to die
And I don't know what to say to you if you wanted to know why
And now everyone is telling me that I lost my mind
And if I tried to get me back I'm scared of what I'd find

I am broken
