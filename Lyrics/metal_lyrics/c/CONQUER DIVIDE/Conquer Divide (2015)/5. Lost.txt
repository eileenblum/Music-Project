Where are you tonight?
We can't erase the mess we made
It wasn't worth the price I paid
Where are you tonight
Cursed every mile we ever crossed
And have you ever been so lost

This is over with, I'm done fighting against myself
This is over with, I deserve better than this

I just wanted to find myself, I'm holding on to distant memories
I'm trying to fill this void
I can't face the storm raging inside of me
Oh, if I could just find my way back then I would be whole
Can you hear it, can you hear my heart giving up I'm breaking

Where are you tonight
We can't erase the mess we made
It wasn't worth the price I paid
Where are you tonight
Cursed every mile we ever crossed
And have you ever been so lost

It's taken my heart, my mind, my body and soul
To get myself out of this bottomless hole
No matter hard it is to run away
I'll have to say this is over with
I'm done fighting against myself
This is over with, I deserve better than this

Where are you tonight
We can't erase the mess we made
It wasn't worth the price I paid
Where are you tonight
Cursed every mile we ever crossed
And have you ever been so lost

Couldn't let this go I'm so alone and I've never felt so low
I left it all behind I've been torn apart for so long
Whoa

Trapped in my own ambitions I'm so alone
Parted, I've become so distant I guess I should have known
I was one foot out the door never satisfied
But I can't admit no I just can't admit
I was looking, longing for a life
That does not exist no it does not exist
The clock is ticking disconnected from reality
As my eyes skim the horizon
My heart is pounding this road was a dead end
So I'm coming home, yeah I'm coming home
