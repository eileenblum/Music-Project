You're like a deer in the headlights
What I said you didn't wanna believe
You're so inane and misguided
You won't get the best of me

Well I can't help that it's not worth it
You had your chance and you missed out
You couldn't change me, so don't mistake me
I'm not someone who will back down

Last night I saw that your intentions
Were relentless (Relentless)
What makes you think I won't fight back?
I'm outstretched but you're outmatched

So here we are, make your move
But you don't have what it takes
I'm on the edge and I don't care
I never said that I'd fight fair
I'm awaiting the next provocation
It's not me, you just love the fixation

You could break me in every way
You could bring me right to my knees
By the time you count to three
I'll be standing on my own two feet
You're the nightmare that's chasing me
You could tear away all my dreams
I'll show you what it means to scream
When I'm standing on my own two feet
My own two feet

The skies disguised like you with all your charm
Till lightning hits the ground
I can't believe you thought I'd save you
When you'd just let me drown

Wake up cause you're not listening
Tell me what it is that you fail to see
I won't let you destroy this
You're just a self-fulfilling prophecy

You could break me in every way
You could bring me right to my knees
By the time you count to three
I'll be standing on my own two feet
You're the nightmare that's chasing me
You could tear away all my dreams
I'll show you what it means to scream
When I'm standing on my own two feet
My own two feet

Is that all you've got?
Try to bring me down, let's see how far you get
Just walk away, you're too little too late
And that was your last mistake

You can't take away part of me, my dreams
Your voice meaningless, I'm what you'll never be
You're not what I made up, a figment of a dream
You said you'd bring me to my knees

These footprints in the ground
No, I'm never falling down
When will you see (These footprints in the ground)
I'm done playing these games, screaming in vain (No, I'm never falling)
Waiting for you to hear me (Down)

You could break me in every way
You could bring me right to my knees
By the time you count to three
I'll be standing on my own two feet
You're the nightmare that's chasing me
You could tear away all my dreams (Tear away all my dreams)
I'll show you what it means to scream
When I'm standing on my own two feet

(You're the nightmare that's chasing me)
A figment of a dream
You're not what I made up
You said you'd bring me to my knees

(Now I'm standing on my own two feet)
