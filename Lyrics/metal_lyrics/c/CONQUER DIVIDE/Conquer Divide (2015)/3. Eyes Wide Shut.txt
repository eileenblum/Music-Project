Mistakes that you made
Don't be surprised that they're carved in stone
I never thought we'd come undone
Till I learned that you can't trust anyone (Oh)

It's times like these that I gave in
But times have changed; you're getting under my skin
I think I'm out of my mind
Because I'm staring with my eyes closed, sitting here
You keep ignoring the past
On your knees like a bitch and you keep crawling back
It's a waste of my time
Because I'm staring with my eyes closed, sitting here blind

I closed my eyes, ignoring the circumstance
It's so clear; you were never there
And I can't pretend there's nothing wrong
When you loved me in your messed up ways
Well it's not enough for me to stay

Games that you play
Don't be surprised when you're all alone
You better hurry up, get going
Cause honestly you think I'm joking

There's no hope for tomorrow
It's a lesson learned so I let you go
And I'll bury your name
Because I can't live off the happiness of better days

I closed my eyes, ignoring the circumstance
It's so clear; you were never there
And I can't pretend there's nothing wrong
When you loved me in your messed up ways
Well it's not enough for me to stay

Why can't you face me?

Well you've got the best of me (Best of me, best of me)
Well you've got the best of me

I tried to forget you
But baby, you were my perfect disease

(Oh) Was it all a dream? You can't seem to disagree
Well I wish I'd never let you get to see this side of me
Here's another story for your eyes to finally see
What will never be, we'll never be
Watch me walk away

I gave you everything and now I'm so numb
Cause I'm staring with my eyes closed, sitting here blind
I gave you everything and now I'm so numb
Cause I'm staring with my eyes closed, sitting here blind

I gave you everything
I gave you everything
I gave you everything
I'm so numb
