This flame is coalescing
This fire's burning bright
I know Iâll get burned but itâs alright 
(Waiting anxiously)

Itâs too late to change direction
Iâm fixed on her in my mind
Trade sense for sensation this time
(Takes control of me)

I canât wait

I want to be with you right now anyway
Reckless, so what?  I canât wait to be around you

Take me, break me, right now - Why wait til hell to pay?
So dumb, so what? I canât wait to be around you

Her skin is laced with poison
Her words are laced with lies
Affliction is waiting in her eyes
(Take them willingly)

I canât control this compulsion
Like a moth into the flame
Her fiery embrace completes my shame
(Donât let go of me)

We bathe in this denial
Lay bare the secret place
For just a little while
Submit to this embrace

Pain unfolding
Shame beholding
Donât let go of me
