Sit down and shut up I don't want to hear a word come out of your mouth.
Why wont you listen to me?
You're dreaming - outside life's great but inside you're screaming
Its not how you thought it would be?
(Aimlessly)
Are you hoping for something?
(Patiently)
Waiting for some sign?
(Mindfully)
Its time to jump in or simply get the hell out
(Finally)
I think you better make up your mind
Your perfect world
Has been upset
And this is the best its gonna get
C'mon, get up shake it off and work your way beyond the fallout
But you still wont listen to me
You're screaming Bam! the smack of the truth wakes you from your dreaming
So inconveniently
(Irony)
It sucks that it was all for nothing
(Painfully)
Your plans were redesigned
(Mournfully)
Its a shame you didn't stand for something
(Finally)
Now its too late to make up your mind
Your life's been overrated
Hopelessly complicated
You can keep your fame and you can
Keep your money
Keep your beauty
Its a shame how long you've waited
Constantly constipated
So grab your knees and clench your teeth and
Reap your glory
Reap your glory
