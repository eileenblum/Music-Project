Fight!
Fight!

Get back up,
What are you waiting for?
This time I'm over playing with this plight
But I'm still handcuffed, ball-gagged,
Facedown to the floor,
And I'm waiting,
While I'm hating what I'm waiting for

It's time to take a hold of what belongs to me,
it's time to walk away with no apologies
Voices in the mirror start quietly,
now they're screaming back at me

(Don't back down!)
Holding on until my hands and mind are bleeding
(Don't back down!)
This is my birthright
(Don't back down!)
I'm so sick of feeling like I'm helpless
(Don't back down!)
This is over tonight!

Don't back up,
your ass is to the wall again
And aren't you sick of wasting so much time?
Yes, it's true, you're a fool
If you think you were born to be waiting
while your hating what you're waiting for

It's time to take a hold of what belongs to me,
it's time to walk away with no apologies
Voices in the mirror start quietly,
now they're screaming back at me

(Don't back down!)
Holding on until my hands and mind are bleeding
(Don't back down!)
This is my birthright
(Don't back down!)
I'm so sick of feeling like I'm helpless
(Don't back down!)
This is over tonight!

How could have I been so earthbound,
with my heart in the depths and my face in the ground?
It's time to uproot myself and move on!
How could I make a sound
when my mouth and my lungs are both fused to the ground?
It's time to uproot myself and move on!

Voices in my head have all begun to sing
(Voices in your head've all begun to sing)
Sure as hell hope I am listening
(Sure as hell hope you're listening!)

It's time to take a hold of what belongs to me,
it's time to walk away with no apologies
Voices in the mirror start quietly,
now they're screaming back at me

(Don't back down!)
Holding on until my hands and mind are bleeding
(Don't back down!)
This is my birthright
(Don't back down!)
I'm so sick of feeling like I'm helpless
(Don't back down!)
This is over tonight!
Over tonight,
This is over tonight,
Tonight!
