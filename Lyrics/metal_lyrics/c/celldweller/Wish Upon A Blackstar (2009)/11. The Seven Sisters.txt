âLook up at the stars sonâ my father was saying
âNow go wish upon one then spend your life waitingâ

The Northern Lights could hear me whispering
Hunter Orion are you listening?
Nine rings of Saturn circle endlessly
And Iâm still waiting

I cast my hope upon The Pleiades
The Seven Sisters who would come for me
Theyâd fall to earth to grant a childâs dream
But Iâm still waiting

Alone in this darkness thereâs a dream still worth saving
I cling to a promise, and I am still waiting
