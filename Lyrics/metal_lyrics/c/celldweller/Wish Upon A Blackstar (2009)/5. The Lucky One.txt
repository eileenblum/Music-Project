Payback is overdue
So much for the I.O.U.
My head is stuck underneath God's thumb
I guess that makes me the lucky one

Stupidity is a constant trend
Murphy and I have become best friends
Hooray for dreams gone before they've come
Hooray for me I'm the lucky one

I am the lucky one
I am a comedian
the jokes on me, I'm the lucky one

A sinking ship, holes in my lifeboat
I'm sorry for choking but I've got a wishbone stuck in my throat
I never thought this could be such fun
Hooray for me I'm the lucky one

I tried to jump straight through the suck
Headfirst but now my freaking head is stuck
I'm feeling like a stupid schmuck
Lucky for me I don't believe in luck
Thank God I don't believe in luck

Rusted linings on my black clouds
It's raining piss, will somebody tell me what's that all about?
Wish on a Blackstar until it comes
It's here for me, I'm the lucky one

I am the lucky one
I am only human
I guess that makes me the lucky one
