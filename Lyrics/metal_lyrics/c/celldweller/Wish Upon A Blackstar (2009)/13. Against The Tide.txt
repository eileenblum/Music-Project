I finally get what you've been saying
Now that we're knee deep, side by side
The storm clouds are circling above us
As we struggle...
Against the tide...

I feel your grip firm on my shoulder
But this fear in my head won't subside
They patiently circle around us
As we hold out...

Oh father why have they forsaken me?
You warned me that they would
The curse is passing down the bloodline 
it's spoken and misunderstood
We're losing light
And strength of will
The darken depths beckoning still
And we hold on
Against the tide

"Another storm you're left to fight alone
Remember son you're reaping what you've sown
Another way isn't sinking like a stone
I'm sorry son you're reaping what you've sown"

"Another storm you're left to fight alone
Remember son you're reaping what you've sown
Another way isn't sinking like a stone
I'm sorry, son, you're reaping what you've sown'
(You're right I was your son)

You're reaping what you've sown!
(You're right I was your son)

You're reaping what you've sown!
(You're reaping what you've sown)

Slowly losing ground
And hope is harder to maintain
When all the prayers we prayed
Feel lost like tears in the rain
The waters pulling down
The moon's eclipsing the sun
The ending that we knew would come
Has finally begun
(You're the only...)
You're reaping what you've sown!
It's fianlly begun! 
You're reaping what you've sown!
(You're reaping what you've sown!)
(You're the only...)
I'm sorry, son, you're reaping what you've sown
You're reaping what you've sown!
(You're reaping what you've sown!)

This sorrow weighs down on my shoulders
This fear's getting harder to hide
You'll leave me alone in this darkness
Left to hold out...
Against the tide...
