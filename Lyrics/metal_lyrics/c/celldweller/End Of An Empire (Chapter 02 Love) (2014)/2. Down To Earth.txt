It seems like right from the moment of your birth
Someones been needing to bring you down to earth
Lost up in your atmosphere of self entitlement
That broken halo on your head is hardly heaven sent

Its time for someone to bring you down to earth

You go on pretending that you own the universe
And weâll all be here watching as you're falling down to earth

Won't matter how high you climb
When rules of gravity apply
Won't matter how hard you've tried
When your ego and earth collide

You're falling
Down to earth
Down to earth

Down to earth

Look down on those with their fingers in the dirt
We look up and see that your own life is inert
Sidetracked by your self-important Babel-building schemes
But broken wings wonât let you fly above all your broken dreams

Its time for someone to bring you down to earth

You go on pretending that you own the universe
And weâll all be here watching as you're falling down to earth

Won't matter how high you climb
When rules of gravity apply
Won't matter how hard you've tried
When your ego and earth collide

You're falling
Down to earth
Down to earth

Down to
Down to

You're falling
Down to earth

Deactivating
Accelerating
Disintegrating
Detonating

Won't matter how high you climb
When rules of gravity apply (you're falling)
Won't matter how hard you've tried
When your ego and earth collide

Won't matter how high you climb
When rules of gravity apply
Won't matter how hard you've tried
When your ego and earth collide

Won't matter how high you climb
Won't matter how hard you've tried
Won't matter how high you climb

Down to earth

Its time for someone to bring you down to earth

Its time for someone to bring you down to earth

Down to earth
