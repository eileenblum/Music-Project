Iâve fought a monster a mile high
Arm wrestled twenty octopi
I had a sword fight with a samurai
And sang the sirens a lullaby
Iâve pinned my heart to my sleeve
So that the whole world can see
I have a heart on for you

Well Iâm not sure now what's left to do
Or if my actions are loud and clear to you
So I guess that Iâm just trying to say

I fucking love you
I guess that Iâm just trying to say
I fucking love you
Iâve pinned my heart to my sleeve
So that the whole world can see
I have a heart on for you

Well Iâm not sure now what's left to do
Or if my actions are loud and clear to you
So I guess that Iâm just trying to say

I fucking love you
I guess that Iâm just trying to say
I fucking love you
I fucking love you
I'm just trying to say
I fucking love you!

Iâve pinned my heart to my sleeve
So that the whole world can see
I have a heart on for you
I cross my heart
And hope to die
Stick a needle in my eye
If you stick a needle in my eye
Iâve already crossed my heart and hoped to die
And itâs true, I am a fighter with a point to prove
Iâve fought monsters, sirens and samurai for you
I will take you everywhere I fly
And it doesnât even matter when, where or why
And itâs true, I am a lover with a point to prove
Iâve killed monsters, sirens and samurai for you
If you stick a needle in my eye
Iâve already crossed my heart and hoped to die
And itâs true, I am a fighter with a point to prove

Well Iâm not sure now what's left to do
Or if my actions are loud and clear to you
So I guess that Iâm just trying to say
I fucking love you

I guess that Iâm just trying to say
I fucking love you
In the lowest depths, the highest heights
Through the shortest days and the longest nights
The warmest fires, the coldest ice
Through the brightest place and the darkest times

I guess that Iâm just trying to say
I fucking love you
In the lowest depths, the highest heights
Through the shortest days and the longest nights
The warmest fires, the coldest ice
Through the brightest place and the darkest times

I guess that Iâm just trying to say
I fucking love you
I'm just trying to say
I fucking love you
I'm just trying to say
I have a heart on for you
