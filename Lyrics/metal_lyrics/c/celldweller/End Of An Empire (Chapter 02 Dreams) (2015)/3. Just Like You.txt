You...
You...
You...

It's the dark of night and I'm at the end of the line
Alone in my head and waiting for something divine
To answer me
Drowning for silence the internal violence, I pray
To make it through
The stormwinds are growing as my dreams are blowing away
Just like you

You....
You...
You...

Out at the edge the moonlight reflecting from me
The collapse of the waves echoing eternally, as I cry out
If I'm living my life then why does it feel like my heart,
will break in two?
Failure is calling as my dreams are falling apart
Just like you

You...
You...
You..

Just like you

You...
You...
You...
I feel just like you
