Traces of cyanide in your cigarette
Gun full of bullets for your Russian roulette
We all feel sorry for you now

Your luck is sliding like a bat out of hell
You're empty-handed at your life's show and tell
You have no idea what's coming down

One million voices call from the other side
If you could hear them you would be terrified

Good luck, you're fucked
And we hate to see you go, man, but everyone knows you're screwed
Good luck, you're fucked
It's like a losing game of hangman, the letter we need is U
U, U, U

Good luck

Piss in your coffee and there's nails in your bread
Snakes in your toilet and a shark in your bed
We all feel sorry for you now

The grim reaper's grading your show and tell
That bat is taking your life back into hell
You have no idea what's coming down

One million voices call from the other side
If you could hear them you would be terrified

Good luck, you're fucked
And we hate to see you go, man, but everyone knows you're screwed
Good luck, you're fucked
And your life's about to blow, man, and everyone knows but you
you, you, you

Good luck
Good luck
You're fucked
Good luck

Good luck, you're fucked
And we hate to see you go, man, but everyone knows you're screwed
Good luck, you're fucked
And your life's about to blow, man, and everyone knows but you
you, you, you

Good luck
