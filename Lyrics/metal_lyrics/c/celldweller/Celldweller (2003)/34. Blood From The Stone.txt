[Unreleased Demo 2005]This isn't really what it seems
We're feeling different things
I see the edge beneath the dreams
To which an ending clings

I never promised it would last
I never thought it would
And now that so much time has passed
The memories aren't good

I am the blood from the stone

And now you know why I said
I am the blood from the stone
And now you can see left to me
I will end up alone

This isn't really what it seems
We're Feeling different things
I see the edge beneath the dreams
To which an ending clings

I never promised it would last
I never thought it would
And now that so much time has passed
The memories aren't good

And now you know why I said
I am the blood from the stone
And now you can see left to me
I will end up alone

And now you can take
What I break
And turn it to gold

I am the blood from the stone
