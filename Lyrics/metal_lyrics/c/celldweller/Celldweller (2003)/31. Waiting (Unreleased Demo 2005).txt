I'm still waiting
am still
I'm still waiting
am still
am I obsessed why can't I be for a moment,
you rather let me down than strain yourself,
can I request a minute to just think about it, (I'm still waiting)
I know that's not asking much when I'm still waiting here
I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting here
I'm still waiting
By your right
nothing has come from this you're praying,
dont forget to make them say they're sorry,
it's no wonder you're alone and saying:
make it wait
make it sting
that's ok
I'm still waiting
am I obsessed why can't I be for a moment,
