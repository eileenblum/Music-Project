"Control my tiniest motions
Withhold my simplest needs
I wish you weren't this close now
I wish you didn't succeed

Yeah, so what - it's another day
You're gonna take it from me anyway
I can't seem to remember now
What it was like to live life before you, symbiont

I want to go but I have to stay
I know you'd be there anyway
I need you and you need me
So much for bliss when I kiss this enemy
Mine
Were dancing on a thin line

Control my tiniest motions
Withhold my simplest needs
I wish I didn't need you now
I wish you didn't need me

Yeah, so what - it's another day
You're gonna take it from me anyway
I can't seem to remember now
What it was like to live life before you, symbiont

I want to go but I have to stay
It doesn't matter if I leave because you'd be there
Anyway
I need you and you need me
So much for bliss when I kiss this enemy
Mine
Were dancing on a thin line

Erasable - Expendable
Untraceable Unmendable

Erasable - Expendable
I Wish I didn't need you now
And I Wish you didn't need me

I Wish I didn't need you now
And I Wish you didn't need me
Need You Now
You Need Me

Cause you hate me
And I hate you
But you need me
And I need you
I need you
Need you now"
