I'm not clear how it is that I ended up here
(Let me help you clear your clouded memory - it's easy
Cause nobody in the world could know you better then me)

DÃ©jÃ  vu - think of you now so far, once so near
(Don't get all sentimental using up your prime - showtime
This pile of shit you're shovelin's getting hard to climb)

Tangled in my own reflection - on the way down - Fadeaway

With my hands on my mind I hold wounds that won't mend
(Well just stop trying to be something that you're not - Maggot
You'll never shake me, never break me and never overtake me)

With my eyes opened wide I can see it's the end...

Tangled in my imperfections - on the way down - Fadeaway
Don't hate me now
They've torn away the ground from under me
Right after they were reassured that I believed
Normality is not a word I understand at all
I set myself up for the fall(Fadeaway)
Withdrawing deep into the hole(Fadeaway)
This isolated little hell leaves me cold and faded
(Fadeaway fadeaway fadeaway)
(Fadeaway fadeaway fadeaway)

I'm my one and only friend - I am my worst enemy
I find new methods to pretend that this is not reality
(Don't be lonely - now I'm your only...)

Just stay far away from me
When I fadeaway from me (Just stay far away from me)
Just stay far away from me (Just stay far away from me)
When I fadeaway from me (Just stay far away from me)
When I fadeaway from me (Just stay far away from me)
When I fadeaway from me (Just stay far away from me)
When I fadeaway from me (Just stay far away from me)
When I fadeaway from me

When I'm not all I used to be
Yeah when I fadeaway from me
When I stuck between myself and me
When I fadeaway from me

Decline - More whine - Deadline - All mine.
