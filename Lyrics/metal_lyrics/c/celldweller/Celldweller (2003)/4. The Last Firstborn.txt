Oh man, I can't believe
That you did what they said you did
And to this day
I've still gotta say
That in my mind I question it
I wish
I knew
What you had meant
Before you went
And left me wondering
To just an echo of your voice
'Listen...'
Now I wait to take my turn to bleed
Like a kid playing
With a razor blade
And wonder if I have
The balls at all
Or am I gonna be afraid
Where are you?
What do you think?
'cause I'm not sure when
Knocking at death's door
If I will be welcome in
Or be left alone outside

[Chorus:]
I hear the sound of a heart
From the shadow in the dark
Waiting for the poison to hit its mark
(listen--my son)
I see the darkness surround
The shape on the ground
The killer straight up
And a body face down
(firstborn-last one)
I hear the
Din of the screams,
Sorrow in streams
The smell of farewell and gasoline
(listen--my son)
I see a heart set free
And my legacy
Hear a voice from a shadow
That is beckoning me
(firstborn-last one)

I guess there comes a point
When you think to yourself
"This isn't worth it,
It isn't worth it"
And now I feel what you felt
And now I feel what you felt inside brother
And now I feel what you felt
This isn't worth it,
It isn't worth it

[Chorus]

[x6]
I wish it didn't [x4]
I wish it didn't end this way

Live a life in hell
Through a mortal shell
Asphyxiating smell
For a crime lifetime
Imagination locked in a cell
And to the other firstborn,
I see the same scene
That must play over in your mind
And now how much more
I'm sure
It's fucked with your head
Just like it's fucked up mine.
"Listen my son - firstborn last one"
The message you sent out to me-
I can't change what's meant to be
The message you sent out to me-
I can't change what's meant to be

[Chorus x2]
