So lost tell me how can it be I'm desperately
Trying to understand why I will push you from
Me so close but so far away I cannot see how
This happened to me I'm so sorry to say
So lost for so long I cannot tell how in my
Mind and what moment in time I woke up in this
Cell so close yet so far away I cannot see how
This happened to me I'm so sorry to say
I want you to go away from me
I want you so much to stay with me
