"Welcome home" she said to me
"Let's hide away before they see.
I need so much to be alone with you, I do"
"Come with me" she took my hand
"Please try to help me understand"
So pointless when my heart has
Turned to stone, I know

[Chorus:]
I wish I didn't need you now.
I wish I didn't need you now.
I wish I didn't need you now.
I need you now.
I need you now.

"I wish we could" she whispered near
"Go some place far away from here."
While hoping that small voice would
Disappear that said "Welcome to the end"
