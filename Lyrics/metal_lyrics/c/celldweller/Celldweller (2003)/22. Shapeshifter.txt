[feat. Styles Of Beyond]Get ready
Get ready, get set
Get ready, get set, let's roll

Ha, get ready, get set, let's roll
Road warrior in a bit of petrol
Red, yellow, hit green, then go, breathe in slow

S.O.B
You ain't never seen nothing so rugged at 90
Uh huh, with the cops behind me yo!
The boiler's grinding, keep the cuffs, enjoy your doughnuts sir, you ain't gonna find me
It's not likely their brains is blown out
You're chasing a ghost with no brakes, slow down
Hundred proof octane, ready to drink bitch
Stop playing, I'm hot man, gimme that pink slip
Time's up, the animals crept through
Leave them in the dust with a packet of jet fuel
Too quick, eat 'em up, better for pet food
No brain, slow lane, missing your head screws
Skin and bones let mess with your chrome set
Tricked out, hopping like your cruse in a cold chest
Parked in eagle with a safety pin
Take the backseat, now let the games begin, yeah

Ha, get ready, get set, let's roll
Road warrior in a bit of petrol
Red, yellow, hit green, then go, breathe in slow
Shape! Shifter!
Come on man, you can't be real
I'll show you what it is, let the anthem build
Shape! Shifter!
Put the pedal to the metal and go

Tough match, you lost by a hubcap
The big boss spray painted on my mud flap
Get a rush, yeah we're calling your cold bluff
Can never get enough
Step in, hold your breath and hang tight
Known for the big dollar bet in the cage fight
You're playing with the sharks, step inside
Everybody on your mark, get set, now let's ride.
That's right, put the pedal to the metal and go
The yellow madellow with slicks on sending 'em home
Stick cars in the concrete, gripping the road
So quick, get in the palm trees, look out, whoa
We got car keys hooked to remote controls
Hit a button that'll smoke and they'll rip you off
I told you, I don't want to close your casket
Quit now before you go blowing a gasket
Ha, get ready, get set, let's roll
Road warrior in a bit of petrol
Red, yellow, hit green, then go, breathe in slow

Shape! Shifter!
Come on man, you can't be real
I'll show you what it is, let the anthem build
Shape! Shifter!
Put the pedal to the metal and go

Melting! - Meltdown!
While time is shifting
Transist! - Transform!
Yielding! - Bending!
While time is shifting
Two shapes they can't get straight!
Get ready, get set, let's roll

Shape! Shifter!
Come on man, you can't be real
I'll show you what it is, let the anthem build
Shape! Shifter!
If you want it, come and let me know
I'm right here, put the pedal to the metal and go
Shape! Shifter!
Come on man, you can't be real
I'll show you what it is, let the anthem build
Shape! Shifter!
Put the pedal to the metal and go
