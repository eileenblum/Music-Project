Make way
Royalty is coming
Obey
Though some say your welcomes overstayed

Fly high
While you're still able
In time
Your wings will surely touch the ground
When you're uncrowned and on your way down

Big shot
Everybody loves you
So what?
Soon enough they'll all forget your name

Fly high
While you're still able
In time
Your ego crown will weigh you down
When You're uncrowned and on your way down

My nights alone were worth it all,
Just to see your face on the way down
(you're on your way down)
There's no one to hear you when you call,
No hands to help you as you drown
(you're on your way down)
On your way down
(you're on your way down)
(you're on your way)

Hole in your face with pointless noise spilling out
Think about what you say before you open your fucking mouth
Everywhere we look
And everything we hear
You can only imagine how good we'll feel when you finally disappear

It's so sad
When I picture your face
Gone before you knew your place
Your dreams
Let them go
Let them go
With you pleas of desperation
No one wants to hear

My nights alone were worth it all
Just to see your face on the way down
(you're on your way down)
Here's no one to hear you when you call
No hands to help you as you drown
(you're on your way down)
On your way down
(you're on your way down)
On your way down
(you're on your way down)
On your way down
(you're on your way down)
(you're on your way)
(you're on your way)
