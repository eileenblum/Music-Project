Build them up-high and strong
So you'll never have to hurt too long
Put them up-til they surround
And there's no real you left to be found
Hold it up-high above no fear of hope or trust
Or love
Close it up-and hold your ground and wait until
It's time to finally close it down
"even if you want--you can't hurt me now"
(this isn't easy to admit but I don't think I'm
Believing it-I'm afraid this time)
