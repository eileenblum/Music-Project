[10 Year Anniversary Edition Disc Begins]
[]
[feat. Tom Salta]Ghost in a place of fear
dreams and memories are decaying here

Cold constantly turning sphere
where shadows gather and quickly disappear

Stepping through time and our minds are always focused on our prey
Our Spirits gone recon
Our former lives have fallen far away

Ghosts
See the face of Fear
To think they know their enemy
will make you stronger

Ghosts
Recreate the Fear
to think its only in their minds
will make them weaker

We will vindicate

Ghost in a place of fear
The screams of enemies
are replaying here
Old phantasms perserver
Til threats to innocence
no longer interfere

Stepping through time and our minds are always focused on our prey
Our Spirits gone recon
Our former lives have fallen far away

Ghosts
See the face of FEAR
To think they know their enemy
will make you stronger
Ghosts
Recreate the Fear
to think its only in their minds
will make them weaker

We will Vindicate
We will
We will

Ghosts
See the face of FEAR
To think they know their enemy
will make you stronger
Ghosts
Recreate the Fear
to think its only in their minds
will make them weaker

We will
We will

Ghosts
Recreate the Fear
to think its only in their minds
will make them weaker

We will make them weaker
We will vindicate
