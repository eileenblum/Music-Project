Atmospheric light
Here alone, Breaking ties
There and back again
In my mind, there's no time
To regret this all again...

Mother...
I'm coming home to you...

Receive me! Receive me!
Receive me! Receive me again!
...ah-ahh, ah-ahh...

I'm coming home to you...

Receive me! Receive me again!
...ah-ahh, ah-ahh...

Atmospheric light
Here alone, Breaking ties
There and back again
In my mind, there's no time
To regret this all again...
...ah-ahh, ah-ahh...

Mother...
I'm coming home to you...

Receive me! Receive me!
Receive me! Receive me again!
...ah-ahh, ah-ahh...

Mother...
I'm coming home to you...

Receive me! Receive me!
Receive me! Receive me again!
...ah-ahh, ah-ahh...
