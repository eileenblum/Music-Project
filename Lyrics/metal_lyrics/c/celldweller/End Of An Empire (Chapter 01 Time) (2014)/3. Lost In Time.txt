When I'm lost in time
I'm lost in time

The criminal in time
He is stealing and feeling

I'm not crying
But I'm dying
And I can't help but feel I'm running out of time

A problem I'm not solving
Eternally revolving
I wandered from the pathway
Praying you will come to save me

I feel lost in time
but if I wait for direction my lifetime will pass me by
I feel lost in time
I think if I live for forever this feeling will never die

The criminal in time
He's not healing all revealing

I can't deny
I question why
And I cant help but feel like I be lost in time

A problem I'm not solving
Eternally revolving
I wandered from the pathway
Praying you will come to save me

I feel lost in time
but if wait for direction my lifetime will pass me by
I feel lost in time
I think if I live for forever this feeling will never die

Lost in time
Lost in time
I am criminal without a crime
I am a genius without a mind
Always a reason but there's never a rhyme
How can patience be my virtue when I'm out of time?
(I'm out of time)

I am criminal without a crime
I am a genius without a mind
Always a reason but there's never a rhyme
How could I know where I'm going when I'm lost in time

I wandered from the pathway
Praying you will come to save me (PLEASE COME TO SAVE ME!)

I feel lost in time
but if wait for direction my lifetime will pass me by
I feel lost in time
I think if I live for forever this feeling would never die

(PLEASE COME TO SAVE ME!)

This feeling will never die
I'm lost in time
This feeling will never die
I'm lost in time
Never
Ever
Die

PLEASE COME TO SAVE ME!

I'm lost in time
This feeling will never die
