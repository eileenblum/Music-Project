Beyond the reaches of our galaxy
Three figures watch over us all
As suns are rising on a distant planet's shores
They are watching, and waiting, always orchestrating

Celestial covering of human kind
Perfectly hovering in space and time
A world that turns when you're in control
Means we're bound to stand on ground that's unshakeable

Unshakeable

Unshakeable

They are watching, and waiting, always orchestrating

Beyond the reaches of mortality
Three figures watch over us all
As suns are setting on a distant planet's shores
They are watching, and waiting, always orchestrating

Celestial covering of human kind
Perfectly hovering in space and time
A world that turns when you're in control
Means we're bound to stand on ground that's unshakeable

Unshakeable

Unshakeable

They are watching, and waiting, always orchestrating

Unshakeable

Unshakeable

Unshakeable
