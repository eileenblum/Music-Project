["Deadrising 2" Soundtrack]

I'm trying not to drown
Beneath the sound
But it's taking over
I've tried to shut it down
But it grows ever loud

Two voices in my head
And I want one of them dead
So I can focus on
Remembering the words you said

Kill the sound!

Foundations trembling
These voices deafening
Feels like I am running out of time
I need to...

Kill the sound!

Way down
Dark on the sound
Simple scare will take you down
Sell yourself inside in suffering
Protect, Protect low
Take it slow, down it goes
Don't save yourself
We'll set you free

Kill the sound!

Two voices in my head
And I want one of them dead
So I can focus on
Remembering the words you said

Kill the sound!

Foundations trembling
These voices deafening
Feels like I am running out of time
I need to...

Kill the sound!

Way down
Deal now
I'll gasp and the page you know
You can make it all better

Infect, Affect now
Make it slow, let it go
Don't save yourself
We'll set you free

Kill the sound!

Two voices in my head
And I want one of them dead
So I can focus on
Remembering the words you said

Kill the sound!

Foundations trembling
These voices deafening
Feels like I am running out of time
I need to...

Kill the sound!

I'm trying not to drown
Beneath the sound
But it's taking over
I've tried to shut it down,
But it grows ever loud

Way down, take it now
Simple scare will take you down
Infects; Protects
Make it slow

Way down
Take it down
Simple scare will take you down

I'm trying
I'm trying
Not
To
Drown

Kill the sound!

Two voices in my head
And I want one of them dead
So I can focus on
Remembering the words you said

Kill the sound!

Foundations trembling
These voices deafening
Feels like I am running out of time
I need to...

Kill the sound!
