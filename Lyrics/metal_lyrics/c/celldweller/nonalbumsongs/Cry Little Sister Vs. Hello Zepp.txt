"Thou shall not kill."

"Congratulations, you are still alive.
Most people are so ungrateful to be alive.
But not you... Not any more."

A last fire will rise behind those eyes
Black house will rock, lost boys don't cry!

(Thou shall not fall)

Thou shall not die
(Lost boys don't cry!)
Thou shall not fear
(Cry little sister!)
Thou shall not kill

Temptation heat beats like a drum
Deep in your veins, I will not lie!

Thou shall not kill
Thou shall not die

"I tried to make you immortal.
You tried to make me a killer!"

Cry little sister!

"You'll never grow old, Michael.
You'll never die.
But you must feed."

Come to your brother!

Cry little sister!

"Let the game begin.
Before dawn; make your choice.
No!"

Lost boys don't cry!

Thou shall not kill
Thou shall not die
Thou shall not die
Cry little sister!
Thou shall not kill
Come to your brother!

Thou shall not kill
Thou shall not kill
Thou shall not kill

"You tried to make me a killer!"

Cry little sister!

Come to your brother!

Lost boys don't cry!

Thou shall not fall
Thou shall not die
Thou shall not fear
(Cry little sister!)
Thou shall not kill

"Oh yes, there will be blood."
