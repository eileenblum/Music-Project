Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith

Hey Miss Murder, can I?
Hey Miss Murder, can I?
Make beauty stay if I,
Take my life?
(Reach out and touch faith)

Hey Miss Murder, can I?
Hey Miss Murder, can I?
Make beauty stay if I,
Take my life?
(Oh)

Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith

He left us all, behind
Hey Miss Murder
(Oh)

Reach out and touch faith

With just a look, they shook,
And heavens bowed before him
Simply a look,
Can break your heart

The stars that pierce the sky,
He left them all behind
Weâre left to wonder why,
He left us all

Hey Miss Murder, can I?
Hey Miss Murder, can I?
Make beauty stay if I,
Take my life?

Hey Miss Murder, can I? (Hey!)
Hey Miss Murder, can I? (Hey!)
Make beauty stay if I,
Take my life?
Reach out and touch faith

Hey Miss Murder, can I? (Hey!)
Hey Miss Murder, can I? (Hey!)
Make beauty stay if I,
Take my life?
(Reach out and touch faith)

Hey Miss Murder, can I? (Hey!)
Hey Miss Murder, can I? (Touch faith)
Make beauty stay if I,
Take my life?
(Oh)

Hey!
Hey!

Reach out and touch faith

(Hey!) He left us all behind
Hey Miss Murder
Hey Miss Murder can I?
Hey Miss Murder
(Oh)

Reach out and touch faith
