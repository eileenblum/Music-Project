Don't back up, your ass is to the wall again and
Aren't you sick of wasting so much time?
Yes it's true you're a fool if you think you were born to be waiting while you're hating what you're waiting for

How could have I been so earthbound with my heart in the depths and my face in the ground?
It's time to uproot myself and move on
