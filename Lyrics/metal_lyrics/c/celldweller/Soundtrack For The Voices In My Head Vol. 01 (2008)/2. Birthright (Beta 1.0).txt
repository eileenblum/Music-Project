Get back up, what are you waiting for this time I'm
Over playing with this plight
But I'm still handcuffed, ball-gagged, face down to the floor
And I'm waiting while I'm hating what I'm waiting for

It's time to take a hold of what belongs to me
It's time to walk away with no apologies
These voices in the mirror start quietly
And now they're screaming back at me

Don't back down
Holding on until my hands and mind are bleeding
Don't back down
This is my birthright
Don't back down
I'm so sick of feeling like I''m helpless
Don't back down
This is over tonight

Don't back up, your ass is to the wall again and
Aren't you sick of wasting so much time?
Yes it's true you're a fool if you think you were born to be waiting while you're hating what you're waiting for

It's time to take a hold of what belongs to me
It's time to walk away with no apologies
These voices in the mirror start quietly
And now they're screaming back at me

Don't back down
Holding on until my hands and mind are bleeding
Don't back down
This is my birthright
Don't back down
I'm so sick of feeling like I''m helpless
Don't back down
This is over tonight

How could have I been so earthbound with my heart in the depths and my face in the ground?
It's time to uproot myself and move on

How could have I been making sound when my mouth and my lungs had both fused to the ground?
It's time to uproot myself and move on

Voices in my head have all begun to sing
(Voices in your head have all begun to sing)
Sure as hell hope I am listening
(Sure as hell hope you're listening)

It's time to take a hold of what belongs to me
It's time to walk away with no apologies
These voices in the mirror start quietly
And now they're screaming back at me

Don't back down
Holding on until my hands and mind are bleeding
Don't back down
This is my birthright
Don't back down
I'm so sick of feeling like I''m helpless
Don't back down
This is over tonight
Over tonight
This is over tonight
Tonight
