You can see we're alive
You didn't think we'd survive
From the hills and the ground
We've risen from the sound
Through the flames, Purified

Raise your hands to the sky
Raise your hands to -

Purified [x2]

You can see we're alive
You didn't think we'd survive
From the hills and the ground
We've risen from the sound
Through the flames, Purified

Raise your hands to the sky
Raise your hands to the sky [x2]
