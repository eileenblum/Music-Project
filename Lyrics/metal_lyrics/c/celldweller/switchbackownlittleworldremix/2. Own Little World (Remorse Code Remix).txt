Na na na na - Na na na na
Na na na
Na na na - na na na
Na na na
Na na na na na na na ooooo
Itâs time to go!
Go! (DJ Scratching)

Explain the reasons,
explain the rhymes
It's not required,
inside our minds
It's safe to try, no need to justify
It doesnât matter - it doesnât matter what they say [distortion sounds]
It doesnât matter - it doesnât matter what they say [distortion sounds]
Or take their guilt trip at the end of the line
Break it down Break it down
Break it down Break it down
Break it down Break it down
My own little world
Welcome to a world where the air I breathe is mine (mine)
There's nothing to overwhelm me and nothing to cloud my mind (mind)
Be anyone, do anything I'd ever want to try (try)
Time doesn't exist here, we will never die
Go! [DJ Scratching]
(we will never die)
Mutual sight,
Mutual sound
Mutual struggle,
For shared ground
It's safe, to say, they'll try to take from me
They're for themselves, it doesn't matter what they say
I'm just another one for them to break down

Steeped in denial,
the daily grind
Dream of a world
for me and my kind
It's safe in the alternative reality
It doesnât matter - it doesnât matter what they say [distortion sounds]
It doesnât matter - it doesnât matter what they say [distortion sounds]
So stick your standards where the sun doesn't shine
Break it down Break it down
Break it down Break it down
Break it down Break it down
My own little world
Welcome to a world where the air I breathe is mine (mine)
There's nothing to overwhelm me and nothing to cloud my mind (mind)
Be anyone, do anything I'd ever want to try (try)
Time doesn't exist here, {Time doesn't exist here,}
Slip to a world where the air I breathe is mine (mine)
There's nothing to overwhelm me and nothing to cloud my mind (mind mind)
Come with me into it and you know what you will find (find)
Time doesn't exist here, we will never die
We/we/we will never die - Die
Never Dieâ¦
G-g-go!
We will never die
We will never die
Na na na na na na na na
Die
Break it down Break it down
Break it down Break it down
Break it down Break it down
Break it down Break it down
Na na na na - Na na na na
Na na na
Na na na - na na na
Na na na
Na na na na na na na
Break it down Break it down

Welcome to a world where the air I breathe is mine (mine)
There's nothing to overwhelm me and nothing to cloud my mind (mind)

Time doesn't exist here, {Time doesn't exist here,}
Slip to a world where the air I breathe is mine (mine)
There's nothing to overwhelm me and nothing to cloud my mind (mind mind)
Come with me into it and you know what you will find (find)
Time doesn't exist here, we will never die
