Switchback [major distortion and cuts]
Uh!
Uh!..
I see, is what I getâ¦
Switchback!
Switchback! Switchback!
Switchback! Uh!
Switchback! Switchback!
Switchback! Switchback! Uh!
Wait, how can it be too late
Late, late, late, late [repeats with major distortion and cuts] to-to-to
Switchback!
Switchback! Switchback! Switchback! Switchback!
Switchback! Switchback! Switchback! Switchback!
Never late to
Too late to
Never late to
Too late to
Uh!
Switchback!
Wait!
Uh!
Switchback!
Uh!
Never be the same!
Switchback!
Switchback!
Switchback!
Switchback!
Wait, how can it be too late
Because I don't want to play
With such a price to pay
Chained to what I can't reclaim
I'll never be the same
Switchback! Switchback! Switchback! Switchback! Switchback! Switchback!
It's too late to look back
Ain't OK I've got no way to switchback
Same [repeats with major distortion and cuts]
Switchback!
How can it be too late
Late, late, late, late [repeats with major distortion and cuts] to-to-to
Itâs to late to look back
It Ainât OK [distortion sound]
To late to
Never late to
{Switchback}
To late to
Switchback! [major distortion and cuts]
Ainât OK [distortion and cuts]
Uh!
Switchback
Uh!
Wait!
Switchback!
Wait [repeats with major distortion and cuts and repeats in the background]
Never late too
Never late too
Never late too
To late too
Never late too
To late too
Switchback [repeats and fades]
