In the wake of my broken dreams
In the dirt and the dust and the days that felt like weeks.
I found the person that I'm meant to be

'Cause when I felt like giving up
When death was closing in
I shut my eyes
And black out the darkness with light from inside

I've given more
Than what I've got
I've given all
Of what I'm not
I've watched this war consume all that we could become

Facing my fears in the dark

But if I die
Before it's done
Please take these words
My final thoughts
The only way to shine your light is in the dark.
Never let life kill your spark

This is the fallout
Yeah it's the end of the world
We'll spread the noise to everyone and let them all know you heard
A system meltdown
It's time we expose
The 'cause of chaos is our own

I've given more
Than what I've got
I've given all
Of what I'm not
I've watched this war consume all that we could become

Facing my fears in the dark

But if I die
Before it's done
Please take these words
My final thoughts
The only way to shine your light is in the dark.
Never let life kill your spark

Never let life kill your spark
Never let life kill your spark
Facing my fears in the dark

I've given more
Than what I've got
I've given all
Of what I'm not
I've watched this war consume all that we could become

If I die
Before it's done
Please take these words
My final thoughts
The only way to shine your light is in the dark.
Never let life kill your spark

Never let life kill your spark
