Ha ha ha ha
Oh well look what we have here boys
Everybody give a warm welcome to
Johnny!
Ha ha, what do you say we show Johnny a thing or two about what it's like to die.

How could this really have happened
One second life was looking up
The next I'm on my way down

I thought my story had ended.
But if this hell is where I'm trapped
Then I will seek my revenge

I've come for
Blood, blood, blood!
And I'm not leaving till I
Have your heart
You're going to pay for all that you have
Done, done, done!
I'll feel alive when I have
Blood, your blood (Blood, your blood)
Because revenge is all I haven't lost

You thought I was through
You may have killed me but now I'll come for you

You thought I was through?
Well that was far from your first mistake...

I have a twisted mind
And I have seen your fate
You think the end is close for you
When really, you're fucking late.
Your reign is over

There's no forgiveness
There's no forgiveness for all that you've done.

I've come for
Blood, blood, blood!
And I'm not leaving till I
Have your heart
You're going to pay for all that you have
Done, done, done!
I'll feel alive when I have
Blood, your blood (Blood, your blood)

Because Revenge is all I haven't lost
You've taken everything I've ever loved
So give me blood, blood, blood!
I'll feel alive when I have blood
Your blood
I want it all
I want it all

See the way
Your blood spills on the ground

But then before my eyes
He turned into a man...
I've been fooled again
I've been fooled again

You are just a slave...
You've dug your bed, deep inside of your grave.
Now slave, you will sleep
For eternity, for eternity

I've come for
Blood, blood, blood!
And I'm not leaving till I
Have your heart
You're going to pay for all that you have
Done, done, done!
I'll feel alive when I have
Blood, your blood

Because revenge is all I haven't lost
You've taken everything I've ever loved
So give me
Blood, blood, blood!
I'll feel alive when I have
Blood, your blood
I want it all!
