Oh, sweet catastrophe
Where have you been?
I've looked for you so desperately
Inside of this pen
You're the answer I've needed
The question I've feared
I know light is your mother
But darkness I fear

Sits inside of you silently
Just waiting to crawl
It's way back to the surface
Like an infected scar
I feel balance is over
The balance is gone
Please somebody save us
Please somebody come

Oh, catastrophe
Leave me to fade out the light
And uncage the night
