On trial for our fates,
we are The Runaways.
Outta place with mistakes we never made,
because, all we are 
to anyone is just a Runaway.
So fate found a day to take it all away.
Cut down and encased inside a cage.
Because all we are
To anyone is just a Runaway.

Well if the waters so deep,
Then why are all of you still standing?
And if the sinner's asleep
Then how can I rattle his cage?
I'm so sick of these dark days chasing me further under ground,
But I'll find my way to light,
And you'll find your own demise.

We were not born the enemy,
and we will not stop for anything!
So try to tell me all the things that I've done wrong.
This fire will burn until we fall!

Well how am I supposed to feel like everything will be okay,
When you try to suffocate
What little is left of me?
So fuck off you've dug your grave and I will be just fine,
Cuz I'll find my way to light,
It's always been here inside!

We were not born the enemy
and we will not stop for anything!
So try to tell me all the things that I've done wrong.
This fire will burn until we fall!
So try to live with the things that you've done,
and try to take all the things that I've loved.
You won't break me, I will rise above.
This fire will burn until we fall!

Run, run, running, 
I keep running,
I keep on running, away.
Run, run, running, 
I keep running,
I keep on running, away.
Run, run, running, 
I keep running,
I keep on running, away.

I keep on running!
