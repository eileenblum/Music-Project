When color starts to fade everything you see is tainted grey
As hope drains from your veins
Fear will slowly take its place

Feel the charge rush down your spine
Every hair stands on end, in shock of your own mind
Lost in the sound of the pounding hearts
The wires have shorted, the circuits gone dark
All it takes is a spark

The masquerade
Is lit ablaze 
Surrounding me as fear consumes my soul

There's a maniac within, taking hold of me again
No place left for me to hide behind the eyes of a maniac

I'm a fucking maniac!

Scarlet drapes my eyes the phantom calls from deep inside
Revealing my disguise, the freak beneath has come alive
Suffering is all I'm wanting
You've been chosen for my haunting

The masquerade
Is lit ablaze 
Surrounding me as fear consumes my soul

There's a maniac within, taking hold of me again
No place left for me to hide behind the eyes of a maniac

I'm a maniac, a maniac, a maniac!

I am the bane of your existence
Feeble are all your attempts at resistance
Stealing your sanity, watching you rot
Just lying in wait, ready or not

Here I come!

You stare in the mirror and the evil you see 
Is the menace within you that you have set free
Unleashing the beast brings the freedom you seek
But there's no escaping maniacal me
