Welcome new recruits to your evaluation and initiation course. 
This system is designed to test your survival and critical thinking 
skills in Aeon City. 
Please adjust the volume and do not move. 

Welcome. 
To the Resistance. 

I've been a victim. 
I've been a coward hiding underneath my pain. 
I've been immobilized and watched the system 
Destroy everything I loved 
We cannot take this. 
We must Resist this. 

Who will you follow when the world fades to the grey? 
Where can I turn when the world gives up on me? 

I keep waiting in the dark for someone to come and save me 
And I've been holding on to something I can never change. 
We all search for higher ground 
When the world comes crashing down, but I know 
Nobody will come in to the dark and save me. 

With iron claws and casted hearts 
I feel my fear just fall apart.
I'm melted down to clear my past 
then forged from fire so that I may ask 

Who will you follow when the world fades to the grey? 
Where can I turn when the world gives up on me? 

I keep waiting in the dark for someone to come and save me 
And I've been holding on to something I can never change. 
We all search for higher ground 
When the world comes crashing down, but I know 
Nobody will come in to the dark and save me. 

All new recruits, 
We have been surrounded by scarecrows. 
This is not a drill. 
I repeat this is not a drill. 
Runaway status is active to all new recruits starting immediately. 
System failure. 

Look what they've done to us. 
Look what they've done to us. 
Look what they've done to us. 

I've grown so sick of hiding, 
It's time we reclaim what's ours. 
They try to say what we'll become 
And rearrange the stars. 
I know I'm sick and fucking tired 
Of this mess they've made. 
So let their arrows block the sun. 
We will fight under the shade. 

Welcome to the Resistance
