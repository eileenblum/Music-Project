Sh...

I hear the static drawing nearer, there's no way out.
I breathe the ice and let the fire die.
They keep on feeding me the chemicals I need to breathe,
But how can something so important not belong to me?
I can't pretend like I'm the one who's gonna change this but all I know is that our time is running out.

I get so tired lighting fires when I know we still have so much further left we could go.

So how much longer must I wait to fill this emptiness?
I've made mistakes and had my dreams slip through the cracks.
I've seen such hate surround me inside of this dark abyss
But all this pain just makes me certain that there's love for me to find on brighter paths.

And out of the dust I see the light creep in and I know it won't be long.
But I'm still terrified 'cause at least in the dark no one else can see who you really are.
So bring me, raise up your guns
And blame me for all of your wrongs.
It seems hate is all I have left, yeah, it's all I have left, it's the only thing that's left in me.

I get so tired lighting fires when I know we still have so much further left we could go.

So how much longer must I wait to fill this emptiness?
I've made mistakes and had my dreams slip through the cracks.
I've seen such hate surround me inside of this dark abyss
But all this pain just makes me certain that there's love for me to find on brighter paths.

So when you feel like you're falling under, holding on to the things you thought you loved.
Will you let all of the things you've run from chew you up and spit you out?
(there's so much now)

I get so tired lighting fires when I know we still have so much further left we could go. [2x]

So how much longer must I wait to fill this emptiness?
I've made mistakes and had my dreams slip through the cracks.
I've seen such hate surround me inside of this dark abyss
But all this pain just makes me certain that there's love for me to find on brighter paths (find on brighter paths)

Don't be scared, we'll see the lights go out...
