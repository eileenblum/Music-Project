(Ohah, ooahooah)
(Oohaah ehaheahah)

Rise!

You took a part of me.
I've wasted all this time just giving up.
The revolution's starting,
Why don't you try and stop it.
We've lost control of our minds.
You think we're giving in?
It's time to prove yourself.
So let the battle begin.
Oh!
We're not the same kids you used to know.
So you wanna play this dangerous game?
Well, we're ready to go.
(Yeah we're ready to fucking go!)

So at the end of the world.
Let's let em hear us say;
We are, we are, we are- the creatures that you've hunted.
We are we are, we are- the ghosts of hope you've killed.
Stand up, stand up, stand up,- we're taking back tomorrow.
Become become become- become the cog and crown.

(Ohah, ooahooah)
(Oohaah ehaheahah)

You think you're done with me?
Like you can light the match and not get burned?
We are the kids you love to hate.
The ones that never learned,
To be part of the system.
We were born to tear shit inside out.
So sharpen your teeth,
And ready your guns,
The Revolution starts now.

We've already died if we give in to everything they ask.
So become more tonight.
We are your bloodline.

We've already died if we give in to everything they ask.
So become more tonight.
We are your bloodline,

Unleash Hell!

This is your bloodline, bloodline.
We are your, we are your lifeline, lifeline.

This is your bloodline, bloodline.
We are your, we are your lifeline, lifeline.
So let them hear us say;

We are we are we are- the creatures that you've hunted.
We are we are we are- the ghosts of hope you've killed.
Stand up stand up stand up- we're taking back tomorrow.
Become become become- become the cog and crown.

We are we are- the creatures that you've hunted.
We are we are- the ghosts of hope you've killed.
Stand up stand up stand up- we're taking back tomorrow.
Become become become- become the cog and-

(Ohah, ooahooah)
(Oohaah ehaheahah)

Become the cog and-

(Oohaah ehaheahah)
