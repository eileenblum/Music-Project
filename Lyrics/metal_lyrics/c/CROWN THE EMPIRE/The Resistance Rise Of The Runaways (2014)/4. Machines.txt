We hold on to the lies to feel free,
So shackled by smiles, so empty.
We're scared of the war, so we've forgotten who we are.
We've traded in hope for safety, we're raised in the smoke,
Insisting that we're all too tired to light the fire,
And shake the earth.

But if all we are is just machines, then let's become a miracle
And break free from these chains.
We must be more than just machines,
So let them hear our hearts, so let them hear our hearts.
So let them hear our hearts, so let them hear our hearts!

Yeah!

Where will you run when there's no place left for you to hide?
When you're faced with the flood, will you stand for the future,
And swallow your pride?

Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who dares to dream!
I scream at the top of my lungs, I hope that I'm proven wrong!

But if all we are is just machines, then let's become a miracle
And break free from these chains.
We must be more than just machines, so let them hear our hearts
So let them hear our hearts!

Where will you run when there's no place left for you to hide?
When you're faced with the flood, will you stand for the future,
And swallow your pride?

Where will you run when there's no place left for you to hide?
When you're faced with the flood, will you stand for the future,
And swallow your pride?

If all we are is just machines, then we must be the cogs,
Inside the wheels of change.
We must be more than just machines,
We can't afford to hide.
We must embrace the pain.

If all we are is just machines, then we must be the cogs,
Inside the wheels of change.
We must be more than just machines,
We can't afford to hide.
We must embrace the pain.
