[from "Punk Goes Pop 5" compilation][originally by Maroon 5]I'm trying to call home,
All of my change I spent on you.
Where have the times gone? baby it's all wrong,
Where are the plans we made for two?

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember, 
The people we used to be.
It's even harder to picture, 
That you're not here next to me.

You say it's too late to make it, 
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down.

I've wasted my nights, 
You turned out the lights (turned out the lights),
Now I'm paralyzed.
Still stuck in that time, 
When we called it love, 
But even the sun sets in paradise, yeah.

I'm at a payphone, trying to call home.
All of my change I spent on you.
Where have the times gone? baby it's all wrong,
Where are the plans we made for two?

If "Happy Ever After" did exist (did exist), 
I would still be holding you like this (holding you).
All those fairy tales are full of shit (shit),
One more fucking love song and I'll be sick!

You turned your back on tomorrow,
'Cause you forgot yesterday.
I gave you my love to borrow, 
But you just gave it away.

You can't expect me to be fine, 
I don't expect you to care.
I know I said it before, 
All of our bridges burned down.

I've wasted my nights, 
You turned out the lights,
Now I'm paralyzed.
Still stuck in that time, 
When we called it love, 
But even the sun sets in paradise.

I'm at a payphone, trying to call home.
All of my change I spent on you.
Where have the times gone? baby it's all wrong,
Where are the plans we made for two?

If "Happy Ever After" did exist (did exist), 
I would still be holding you like this (holding you).
All those fairy tales are full of shit (shit),
One more fucking love song and I'll be sick!

Now baby don't hang up, 
So I can tell you what you need to know, 
Baby, I'm begging you just please don't go, 
So I can tell you what you need to know, oh, oh, oh
So I can tell you what you need to fucking know!

Ring ring, motherfucker!

I'm at a payphone, trying to call home.
All of my change I spent on you.
