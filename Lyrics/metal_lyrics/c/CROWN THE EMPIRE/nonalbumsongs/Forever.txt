[originally by Drake]It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine (ever mine, ever mine)
I'm shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she's the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine (ever mine, ever mine, ever mine)

Last name ever
First name greatest
Like a sprained ankle boy I ain't nothing to play with
Started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis
In your city faded off the brown, Nino
She insists she got more class, we know
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I ball, chemo

Drop the mixtape that shit sounded like an album
Who'da thought a country wide tour'd be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one

Yeah what about my business?
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it at least you got to witness
Bitches

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine (ever mine, ever mine)
I'm shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she's the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine (ever mine, ever mine, ever mine)

I used to have hood dreams
Big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring

Y'all seen my story my glory
I had raped the game young
You can call it statutory
When that blow up they gone build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button, what, nothing
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelles husband
You would think these people know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasn't
You're such a fucking loser
He didn't even go to class Bueller

They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever y'all can have it back

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine (ever mine, ever mine)
I'm shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she's the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine (ever mine, ever mine, ever mine)

It may not mean nothing to y'all

And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine (ever mine, ever mine, ever mine)
