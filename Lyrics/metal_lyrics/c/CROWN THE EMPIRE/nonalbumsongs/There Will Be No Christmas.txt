[from "Punk Goes Christmas" compilation]Sometimes I wish we never spoken
Sometimes I wish we never met
Sometimes I wish our love had never had a chance to start and
Sometimes I wish I had you back

I wish this love ended in Autumn, that way it'd float off with the breeze.
Instead this dark December, I'm all alone and colder than I've ever been.
And since you left

There will be no Christmas,
At least not for me. This year I'm all alone waiting for the spring.
There will be no Christmas no Santa no sleigh but I hope that you know, that through it all... I still wish you a happy holiday

I wish you a happy holiday (There will be no Christmas)
I wish you a happy holiday (There will be no Christmas)
I wish you a happy holiday (There will be no Christmas)

There will be no Christmas, at least not for me. This year I'm all alone waiting for the spring.
There will be no Christmas no Santa no sleigh but I hope that you know, that through it all... I still wish you a happy holiday
