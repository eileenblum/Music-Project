[feat. Dennis Shaforostov]This song goes out to everyone whose felt broken
Who searched for the answer and was left in the dark
this is for you

STAND UP!

OH!

I will never be afraid, you shot me once,
I'm still standing
I will never dig my grave,
you shot me once,
I'm still standing;

And every part of me keeps screaming,
"Get on with your life, and start by leaving."
I'm trying to heal these wounds but I'm still bleeding
(I'm trying to heal these wounds but I'm still bleeding)

I've run out of all that I was
(all, I, was)
I've searched for the meaning and ended up lost,
but I see the light at the end of the road,
and it's guiding me,
(and it's guiding me)
guiding me home
(guiding me home)

I know, I no longer must walk through this world alone;
We must resist to be a part of their insolence;
We must start the resistance;
Follow no one;
I've run out of all that I was,
and I'm searchin' for the meaning and ended up lost;
But I see light at the end of the road,
it's guiding me home where I'll heal all
that has left me bleeding,
while their words still burn,
these scars are another lesson learned;

You live your life so disconnected
as you sit there mighty in your fucking little throne;
I'll see to it that all your walls crumble;
I'll tear it down stone by stone;

Bow down! I will not kneel before you!
Bow down! You're never gonna wear my crown!

You shot me once, but I'm still here!
You shot me once, but I'm still here!

This is for those who've seen the light,
we must rise, we're limitless tonight!
And though the sun may never shine, we must know,
we're limitless tonight!

This is for those who've seen the light,
we must rise, we're limitless tonight!
And though the sun may never shine, we must know,
we're limitless tonight!
We're limitless tonight!

It's time for destruction.
