This world keeps pushing down upon me,
And I keep hoping for a sweet dream.

There's something left for me to see,
There's something left for me to be.

We can't ponder on this, world forever.
You know we can save it, if together
Growing, day by day to make it,
but my time's been wasted.

And while my eyes are open wide, I'm sound asleep on the inside,

Wake me up, from this dream that never ends.
Haunting me, Haunting me till my bitter end.
Wake me up, from this nightmare that I live.
Something inside of me keeps on giving in.

Well I keep searching for an answer,
But time will never tell, and you will never know.
My choices are my own, but I can't choose where I call home.
This life isn't carved in stone, this life has left me on my own.

And while my eyes are open wide, I'm sound asleep on the inside,

Wake me up, from this dream that never ends.
Haunting me, Haunting me till my bitter end.
Wake me up, from this nightmare that I live.
Something inside of me keeps on giving in.

WAKE ME UP!

I'm wide awake,
I'm not afraid anymore,
I'm wide awake
It's you who helped me win this war.

Wake me up, from this dream that never ends.
Haunting me, Haunting me till my bitter end.
Wake me up, from this nightmare that I live.
Something inside of me keeps on giving in.

Wake me up, from this dream that never ends.
Haunting me, Haunting me till my bitter end.
Wake me up, from this nightmare that I live.
Something inside of me keeps on giving in.
