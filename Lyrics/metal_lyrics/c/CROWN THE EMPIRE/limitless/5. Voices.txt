The voices inside my head are taking over
They're telling me that my life is in danger
I'm scared that the silence won't come back forever
I believe this is my darkest hour

I pray
Over and over again
That this won't be my end
I still have a long life to live
I'm begging you, begging you

I can't remember the last time
That I said goodbye, or that I even tried
I'm becoming afraid, it's already to late
I'm on my knees, please help me stay alive

I hope this isn't my last night
As I lose my mind, and try to save my life
I'm becoming afraid, it's already too late
I'm on my knees, please help me stay alive

It's just to much to handle
I feel myself turn into stone
Desperate, as the voices linger
There's nothing left for me, please save my soul

I'm running out of time
I can feel the words crawling down my spine
I'm running out of time

(I can't remember the last time)

I can't remember the last time
That I said goodbye, or that I even tried
I'm becoming afraid, it's already to late
I'm on my knees, please help me stay alive

I hope this isn't my last night
As I lose my mind, and try to save my life
I'm becoming afraid, it's already too late
I'm on my knees, please help me stay alive

Take my hand
Don't let me fade away
Don't let me fade away
Don't let me die today

Take my hand
I'll pray for you today
I beg to see another day
Don't let me die today

Take my hand
Don't let me fade away
Don't let me fade away
Don't let me die today

Take my hand
I'll pray for you today
I beg to see another day
Don't let me die today, die today

I can't remember the last time
That I said goodbye, or that I even tried
I'm becoming afraid, it's already to late
I'm on my knees, please help me stay alive

I hope this isn't my last night
As I lose my mind, and try to save my life
I'm becoming afraid, it's already too late
I'm on my knees, please help me stay alive
