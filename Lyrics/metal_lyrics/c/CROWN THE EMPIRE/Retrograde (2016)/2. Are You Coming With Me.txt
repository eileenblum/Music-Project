We know now that in the early years of the twentieth century,
This world was being watched closely by intelligences
Greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own

Did I find the blood inside my bones
Reaching out into the great unknown?
What a life, what a fucked up love we hold
Polarized by what we can't control

We have the chance to realize
Are we the stars, or just the sky?
We have the chance to find our eyes
So are you coming with me?

I'll go, whoa, hey hey hey
I'll go, whoa, hey hey hey

When you find the dust behind the sun
You're alive, but so misunderstood

We're so afraid to change our minds
Are we the shark or just the prize
No I'm not afraid to open wide
So are you coming with me?

I'll go, whoa, hey hey hey
I'll go, whoa

Climb the sky or cauterize (or cauterize)
Golden eyes are better blind (are better blind)

I don't know what I'm meant to see, meant to see
So I'll just hold my breath, and wait for gravity

We don't know what we're meant to see, meant to see
So we'll just hold our breath
We don't know what we're meant to see, meant to see
So we'll just hold our breath

So we'll just hold our breath

Now are you coming with me?

I'll go, whoa (I'll go)
I'll go, whoa

Climb the sky or cauterize, or cauterize
Golden eyes are better blind, are better blind

I'll go, I'll go, I'll go
Hey hey hey
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go
Now are you coming with me?

With me
