Are you hanging on my words tonight?
Don't you get it? Don't you get it?
Hold your breath and everything's just fine
Don't you get it?
Forgotten we could be alone if we waste away, waste away
If there's a love that brings us home, it drowned today
We smile and grind our teeth away
Good luck forgot to call our names
Good god
Lucky us, lucky us, lucky us
No one's hanging on our words tonight
Don't you get it? Don't you get it?
You can try, but you won't change their minds
Don't forget it
Burned in the sun
Afraid of what you'll become
You'll pay the price when you're free, you'll see
Tell me who you want to be
Tell me what you want to see
We smile and grind our teeth away
Good luck forgot to call our names
Good god
Tortured, but no one leads the way
Force-fed like rats inside a maze
Good god
Lucky us, lucky us, lucky us
Are you hanging on my words tonight?
Don't you get it? Don't you get it?
Hold your breath and everything's just fine
Don't you get it? Don't you get it?
We smile and grind our teeth away
Good luck forgot to call our names
Good god
Tortured, but no one leads the way
Force-fed like rats inside a maze
Good god
Lucky us, lucky us, lucky us
Lucky us, lucky us, lucky us
