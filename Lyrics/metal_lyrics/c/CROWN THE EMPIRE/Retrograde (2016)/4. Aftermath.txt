There's nothing I can't face
So open the flood gates
No fear of what's to come
I'm not going under
Not running for cover
Standing against the sun

After the fire, after the flames
Nothing will feel the same
My scars are closing, my heart is open
I am not afraid

I'm ready to breathe again
I'm beginning to catch my breath
I'm ready to dream again
Surviving what left me for dead
I had to bleed to lose
Find myself to prove
I could feel love without end
I'm all that I have
I am the aftermath

Show it no mercy
'Cause you cannot hurt me
No more will I bite my tongue
Tired of worthless fighting with purpose
No longer will I stay numb

After the fire, after the flames
Nothing will feel the same
My scars are closing, my heart is open
I am not afraid

I'm ready to breathe again
I'm beginning to catch my breath
I'm ready to dream again
Surviving what left me for dead
I had to bleed to lose
Find myself to prove
I could feel love without end
I'm all that I have
I am the aftermath

Break my bones, you will see
You can't kill me, you can't kill me!
Break my bones, you will see
You can't kill me, you can't kill me!

You can't kill me!

I'm ready to breathe again
I'm beginning to catch my breath
I'm ready to dream again
Surviving what left me for dead
I had to bleed to lose
Find myself to prove
I could feel love without end

I'm all that I have
I'm all that I have
I'm all that I have
I am the aftermath!
I am the aftermath!
(Aftermath)

Break my bones, you will see
You can't kill me, you can't kill me!
Break my bones, you will see
You can't kill me, you can't kill me!
