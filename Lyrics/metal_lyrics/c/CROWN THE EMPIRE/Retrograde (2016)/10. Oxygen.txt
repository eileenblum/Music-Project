The chemicals
I think they're telling us we're not alone
The molecules
They're taking shape until we let them go
Breathe you in, breathe you out
When it's all too much
Breathe you in, breathe you out
You're my one true drug
I can hardly wait to float above the angels
I'm high again off your oxygen
Calling in the dark, you pull me through the stars
I'm so high again off your oxygen
There's something changing inside the way I see
The air I thought that I needed is just a memory
So captivated inside a world we dream
Breathe you in, breathe you out
When it's all too much
Breathe you in, breathe you out
You're my one true drug
I can hardly wait to float above the angels
I'm high again off your oxygen
Calling in the dark, you pull me through the stars
I'm so high again
The chemicals
I think they're telling us we're not alone
The chemicals
I think they're telling us we're not alone
I can hardly wait to float above the angels
I'm high again off your oxygen
Calling in the dark, you pull me through the stars
I'm so high again off your oxygen
