Say hello to the night
Let order and chaos fill your eyes
Brave the fear in your mind
Walk into the afterlight
Afterlight [4x]
The colors fly like gold in my hands
With open eyes, I'm starting again
Before you go, I think you should know
The world is your kaleidoscope
Break the sequence of hate
There's nowhere but up to go, so follow close
And you'll see the dawn of an age
Where pillars have turned to stone, and martyrs pave the way
The colors fly like gold in my hands
With open eyes, I'm starting again
Before you go, I think you should know
The world is your kaleidoscope
The colors fly like gold in my hands
With open eyes, I'm starting again
Before you go, I think you should know
The world is your kaleidoscope
Kaleidoscope
Afterlight [4x]
Say hello to the night
Let order and chaos fill your eyes
