Through your eyes I fight for gravity
A place to stand, and a place to breathe

When the walls begin to shake
In the home you thought you knew
Will you run? Will you stay? Will you choose?

Do you know who I am?
Iâm so afraid youâll never understand
Thereâs a part of me still lost out there
And I just want to know
Yeah, I just want to know
Am I becoming a hologram?

Close your eyes from the darker side of things
A shade of grey hidden under sheets

When the walls begin to shake
In the home you thought you knew
Will you run? Will you stay? Will you choose?

Do you know who I am?
Iâm so afraid youâll never understand
Thereâs a part of me still lost out there
And I just want to know
Yeah, I just want to know
Am I becoming a hologram?
Now I think Iâm worried that Iâm in too deep
Like a phantom that youâll never see
So I just want to know
Yeah I just want to know
Am I a part of the hologram?

You have seen this incident based on sworn testimony.
Can you prove that it didn't happen?
Perhaps on your way home someone will pass you in the dark, and you will never know it, for they will be from outer space
