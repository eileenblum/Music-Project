It's never too late
It's never too late to let go of all that you know
You're never the same
You're never the same when you find the highs and
the lows
A lonely reminder, a lonelier message
It will swallow you whole
I'm not okay, I'm not okay this time
I'm gonna break, I'm gonna break tonight
No one can see the world I see
The ground below me starts to sing
No one can see the world I see
I'm not okay anyway
You're bending the road
You're bending the road when you hide and wait for a sign
The answers await
The answers await when you find the fear in your mind
But if I could find you, you know I would take you
I would swallow you whole
I'm not okay, I'm not okay this time
I'm gonna break, I'm gonna break tonight
No one can see the world I see
The ground below me starts to sing
No one can see the world I see
I never closed my eyes
I never turned away
But I did this on my own
I did this on my way own
I never closed my eyes
I wanted everything
Now I know it's all my fault
My fault
I'm not okay, I'm not okay this time
I'm gonna break, I'm gonna break tonight
No one can see the world I see
The ground below me starts to sing
No one can see the world I see
I'm not okay anyway
