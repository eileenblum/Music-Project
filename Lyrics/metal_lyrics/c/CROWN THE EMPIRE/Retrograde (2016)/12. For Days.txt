When you find what you love let it go
When you find what you love let it go
Don't wait
Don't wait
When you're lost in the tide, then you know
You can swim but you're not gonna know
The way
The way
All this time I just smiled
Held my fist and closed my eyes
Told myself we'd be just fine
Caught in a haze of blurry lines for days
For days
Do we find who we are in the cold?
Do we fight when there's no one to love?
There's a calm in your eyes when you know
That you're floating above the unknown
All this time I just smiled
Held my fist and closed my eyes
Told myself we'd be just fine
Caught in a haze of blurry lines for days
For days
For days
For days
