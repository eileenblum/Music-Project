Don't be sad for me
I've found the peace that I was looking for
Don't be sad for me
I'm free to hunt but I can't shoot at the birds
Don't be sad for me
I spend my time laughing till one cries
Don't be sad for me
Live your life, then there's the Paradise

I've dreamt or I've seen a starlet in the sky 
I've seen a starlet risin' in the night
I've dreamt or I've seen an angel in the sky 
I've seen an angel reachin' Paradise

Don't be sad for me
I run as fast as train on infinite roads 
Don't be sad for me
I can swim like fish against the flow
Don't be sad for me
I lost my dad, but now we're together again
Don't be sad for me
Live your life, then there's the Paradise

I've dreamt or I've seen a starlet in the sky 
I've seen a starlet risin' in the night
I've dreamt or I've seen an angel in the sky 
I've seen an angel reachin' Paradise

Wide plains, sweet air, the highest mountains 
Calm seas, old trees, it's not fantasy

I've dreamt or I've seen a starlet in the sky
I've seen a starlet risin' in the night
I've dreamt or I've seen an angel in the sky 
I've seen an angel reachin' Paradise
