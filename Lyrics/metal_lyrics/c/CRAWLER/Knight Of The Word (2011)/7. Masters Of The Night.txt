They're coming from a dying world where
The night reigns almost for eternity
They look like humans but they are
Cruel monsters faster than the others are
Leaving in the open while the wars
Are destroying men and all the world
They can hide their crimes to humans and
So they can rule over that lands

Bite!

They can bite their victims to create
An army of immortals at their command
Or bleed their victims to increase
Their strength, their knowledge and their immortality

They want our blood, 'cause it is their feast
They are Masters of the Night
With our blood, deep in we (they) can see
They are Masters of the Night

They're coming from a dying world where
The night reigns almost for eternity
They can change their bodies and they can
Read into the minds of feeble men
Fighting for a land against yourself
Fighting for a land until the end
They don't die with garlic, cross and sun,
But (they) die if (they) touch Dampyr's blood

They want our blood, 'cause it is their feast
They are Masters of the Night
With our blood, deep in we (they) can see
They are Masters of the Night

Bite!
