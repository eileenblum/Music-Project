In this world there is a war
Deep and damned for most of us
The war between the Word and the Void
The war between the day and the night

And here I am
I am a Knight of the Word

Every night I dream
Every night I see the future
What will be if I don't stop the Void
Demons and darkness, pain and anger
This is my work
What will be if I don't stop the Void

One day I met the Lady
That's the voice of the Word
And so I could find my way
And my life will never change

And here I am
I am a Knight of the Word

Every night I dream
Every night I see the future
What will be if I don't stop the Void
Demons and darkness, pain and anger
This is my work
What will be if I don't stop the Void

O'olish Amaneh visited me inside my home
And he gave to me a rune carved staff
When I touched it I crippled in my foot
It has given me the power but it reminds me to walk

Every night I dream
Every night I see the future
What will be if I don't stop the Void
Demons and darkness, pain and anger
This is my work
What will be if I don't stop the Void
