I walked through the desert to
Sneak into Memnon's camp
I found my way to enter
The sorcerer's tent
The guards discovered and caught me
Thanks to the treacherous Takmet
Buried in the sand to my neck
Left here to be eaten by the fire ants

If I become your lover
I will lose my prophetic sight
When I kill the Akkadian
I'll no longer need your gift of sight

... And the king will come
the king will come
... And the king will come
the king will come
The people will (be) saved
The kingdom will (be) free, it will
Make its own destiny
... And the king will come

Deeper in the desert to
Reach the Valley of the Dead
I was hired to kill the sorcerer
But I helped her to escape
Memnon sent his right-hand man
To kill me and to take my head
He gave him a secret weapon
To be sure to see my end

I've killed all the soldiers
Just one is still alive
This arrow from Memnon
Will stab your legs and slowly you'll die

... And the king will come
the king will come
... And the king will come
the king will come
The people will (be) saved
The kingdom will (be) free, it will
Make its own destiny...

In the Valley of the Dead
I'll no longer move my legs
The venom is killing me
Nothing, I can see
I'm dying!
I am healing you
(I'm) riskin' my life
The scorpion's blood in you
You won't be dying!
You're the Scorpion, the Scorpion,
You are the Scorpion King.

You'll ascend to the throne
You'll ascend as a king

Tonight I've had a vision
Memnon's armies will ride
through this place
They will kill the people
He will die by my hand

... And the king will come
the king will come
... And the king will come
the king will come
The people will (be) saved
The kingdom will (be) free, it will
Make its own destiny
... And the king will come
