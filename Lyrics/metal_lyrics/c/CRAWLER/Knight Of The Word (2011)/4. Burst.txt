An asteroid went up to the earth
It's so fast that it won't be too late
to destroy, and for us it will be the end

There are some scared people that run away
In their mind the thought is the same
Stop the march of the great stone and save their lives

BURST, all around me, BURST and around me
BURST, all around me, BURST
BURST, all around me, BURST and around me
BURST, destruction and pain

Oh, no my eyes!
Oh, no what they see!
I should like be blind
For don't see this dark sky and
day after day my world decay

Bombs and rockets have not brought it down
The sky is covered by dark giant cloud
The cities are desolated and went up in flames

Without the sunlight for more than a year
The frost has shrouded the lands and the tears,
that I'm crying, frozen with my heart

BURST, all around me, BURST and around me
BURST, all around me, BURST
BURST, all around me, BURST and around me
BURST, destruction and pain
