Are you ready to kill me?
Are you ready to die?
Are you ready to kill me from the inside?

Are you ready to burn me?
Are you ready to cry?
Are you ready to burn me from the inside?

By day, by night
Thousand voices in your mind
By night, by day
Thousand voices in your brain

Are you ready to shoot at me?
Are you ready to die?
Are you ready to shoot at me from the inside?

Are you ready to crush me?
Are you ready to cry?
Are you ready to crush me from the inside?

By day, by night
Thousand voices in your mind
By night, by day
Thousand voices in your brain

Take a walk in... Take a walk in...
Take a walk in... Take a walk in...
Take a walk in... Take a walk now,
In your sick brain!!!

Take a walk in... Take a walk in...
Take a walk in... Take a walk in...
Take a walk in... Take a walk now,
In your sick brain!!!
