Talk to my mind
Look into my eyes
With its magic it can control me

Jump in through the walls
Walk in through the men
With its magic it can control me

A cat is changing my dreams
I can't believe what I see
Cagliostro is playing with my dream

Stronger than a witch
Stronger than the death
With its magic it can control me

A cat is changing my dreams
I can't believe what I see
Cagliostro is playing with my dream

Only you can read my mind
Only you can save my life
Only you, only you
Only you can read my mind
Only you can make me fly
Only you, only you

A cat is changing my dreams
Nothing is what it seems
Cagliostro is playing with my dreams

Only you can read my mind
Only you can save my life
Only you, only you
Only you can read my mind
Only you can make me fly
Only you, only you
