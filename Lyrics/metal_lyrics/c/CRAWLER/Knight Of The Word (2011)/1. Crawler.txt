We're arrived and saved our world
Not with weapons without a war
Hear our voice, make your choice
Metal is music and ain't a noise

We don't want your blood
We don't want your flesh
We like horror but don't want to kill you
We ain't assassins, we ain't Satan's beasts
We like to play, to play for faith

CRAWLER for the glory of Metal!
CRAWLER, CRAWLER
CRAWLER for the glory of Metal... of Metal!

We're united, to save our world
Not with the weapons without a war
Hear our call, destroy the wall
We play for Metal, we play for all

We don't want your blood
We don't want your flesh
We like the horror but don't want to kill you
We ain't assassins, we ain't Satan's beast
We like to play, to play for the faith

CRAWLER for the glory of Metal!
CRAWLER, CRAWLER
CRAWLER for the glory of Metal... of Metal!

The Metal was, Metal was!
The Metal is, Metal is!
Until we live, Until we live!
The Metal is, Metal will be!

CRAWLER for the glory of Metal!
CRAWLER, CRAWLER
for the glory of Metal... of Metal!
