Freddy's back, Freddy's here
I hear him, I don't wanna sleep
If he kills me in my dreams
I'm dead for real

..."Now I'll lay down to sleep
The master of dreams, my soul I'll keep
In the reflections of my mind's eye
Evil will see itself and it shall die!"...

Close your eyes, Close your eyes
Close your eyes and let me enter your dream!
Close your eyes, Close your eyes
Close your eyes and let me enter your dream again!

I'm not dead, I'm alive
You shouldn't have buried me
You have torched me, you have killed me
But I am here again for you
I will kill you and see you in hell,
Tell'em Freddy sent ya!

Danger, Danger
I don't wanna live this nightmare
Danger, Danger
Freddy's coming back

I'm not dead, I'm alive
You shouldn't have buried me
You can't escape from me, you can't hide instead
I will find you everywhere
Feel my razors, look at my tongue,
Tell'em Freddy sent ya!

Danger, Danger
I don't wanna live this nightmare
Danger, Danger
Freddy's coming back
