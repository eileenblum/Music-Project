I have created a virus that
Will make dead men alive
It's not so perfect but soon it will be
`Cause I will give them a brain

Now they are only some cannibals that
Kill for the pleasure to eat
(But) if I want, with an order they'll stop
Slowly undeads return to death

Not Alive
Not Dead
Without a brain

They'll wake up again... UNDEADS
Who will get away
They'll wake up again... UNDEADS
They want your flesh
Don't let them bite you
Or you'll wake up in the living deads' dawn

Through the undeads I will destroy the death
I'll create a new life on the earth
I'm the one, I'm the legend, I'm Abraxas
Nobody can stop me now.

Not Alive
Not Dead
Without a brain

They'll wake up again... UNDEADS
Who will get away
They'll wake up again... UNDEADS
They want your flesh
Don't let them bite you
Or you'll wake up in the living deads' dawn
