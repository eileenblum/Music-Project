[1987 demo track]

What a useless waste of time
Trying to perceive you
The ignorance of your wants
Claws the anguished dying soul

The pinnacle was surpassed
But you perceive anotherâs grasp
Dedicated to nothing
And disregarding the merit one

Unleash your deadly message
To the imbecile of your dreams
And kill off a confiding swash
That dies slowly from your means

So defraud all you want
âCause I abhor you like the world
And my soul companion
