[Bonus track]

Iâve seen a thousand years
Pass before the eyes
The docket has been lost
As time slips slowly by

Oh here I come
To see the light of day
No, I canât face the day

I donât want to see myself
Die in so much pain
Youth eternally
Let me be young again

Oh here I come
To see the light of day
No, I canât face the day

Canât you see, you must
You must find the answer in me
Your youth lies not in the flesh
Eternal life comes after your death

So find your eternal life
Iâve come to show you how
Canât you see, oh, canât you see
The time has come, the time is now

Canât you see, you must
You must find the answer in me
Your youth lies not in the flesh
Eternal life comes after your death

So find your eternal life
Iâve come to show you how
Canât you see, oh, canât you see
The time has come, the time is now

Now I see what Iâve been after
Eternal life
The secret is death

Eternal life
The secret is death
