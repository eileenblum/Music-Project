Oh why are you doing this to me
Oh why does my life seem incomplete

Rain falls as I dye
Waste away in death
I waste myself away in life

Oh why are you doing this to me
Oh why does my life seem incomplete

Shame falls as I cry
Kick myself to death
I kicked myself enough to die

I believe, I can't see
I believe, I will keep
All my dreams, mind is free
All I need
Until tomorrow
I'll feel no pain
Until Tomorrow

I'll fade away

Oh why are you doing this to me
Oh why does my life seem incomplete

I believe
