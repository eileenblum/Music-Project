Let's count the layers then
Then multiply by ten
A cross section of prayers
And erase all the sin

Strata of Fear, laminate my life
Strata of Fear, sharpen well the knife

Drop a penny through
Collect a sample on the face
Count the lines, count the rings
The slide is upon the stage

Strata of Fear, laminate my life
Strata of Fear, sharpen well the knife

All you staring from earth
Are you real sure

All you staring from earth
Up here lies the cure

I play dead
