Hibernation

Tucked away inside this cold place
Walls begin to close, but I'm still safe
Safe from the unknown sins out there
Live each day alone and scared

Hibernation season
Hibernation season

Curled up in a ball of yarn
My mind's unraveled and soul is torn, but I'm still safe
Safe from the unknown sins out there
Live each day alone and scared

Hibernation season
Hibernation season

Days, I waste away
Dreading more, the next day
Retreat back, into my shell
Feel the pain, of living hell

Life...here I go

In the recent years, all I've seen is fear
Now the time has come, for my....

Hibernation
