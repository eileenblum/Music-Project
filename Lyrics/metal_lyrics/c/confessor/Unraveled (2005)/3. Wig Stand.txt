Down in your dumps
All you see is your junk
Spilling out over the rim
Shit flowing filled with sin

Wig stand, perched up with your cross to bear
Wig stand, an empty shell topped with hair

Feeling sick about your life
And the food that gets you high
Another bite at the hand that feeds
Off the plate that fills your needs

Wig stand, perched up with your cross to bear
Wig stand, an empty shell topped with hair

Did you, see this end
Such a price to pay
Waste your life away now
Life away
