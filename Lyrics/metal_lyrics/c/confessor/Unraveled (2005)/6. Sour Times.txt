We are in/Sour Times

The hole is open, and the maggots call me in
So easy to give up and dive in
But the tide will lead me to my bridge
With the answer I know
With the answer I know to jump in

Sour times are soaking up my soul
Closer to the edge of that hole
Sour times
There're many wars to fight
Way past the front lines
Behind the scene there's much to hide
Ghosts from the past
Wrap their sheets on my mind
Friendships and sin which have died

Sour times
Are soaking up my soul
Closer to the edge of that hole
Sour times
Are soaking up my soul
All hope is gone I'm losing control

I'm not the person I used to be
Not sure who or what to believe

Sour times
Are soaking up my soul
Closer to the edge of that hole
Sour times
Are soaking up my soul
All hope is gone I'm losing control
I'm not the person I used to be
