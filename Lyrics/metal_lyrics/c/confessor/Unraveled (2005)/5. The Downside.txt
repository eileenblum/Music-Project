There was something you wanted
It was really a blessing for you
How could you believe that
That dream was to come true
That's so unlike you

The downside is, you're full of fear

The stars were in line that day
Gods were watching you
You thought that it was your time
There was nothing you couldn't do
That's so unlike you

The downside is, you're full of fear

Must be hard, to go on
Light will shine, Fade away

Must be hard, to go on, Fade away
Seems for you it's no joke, there's no hope

The downside is, you're full of fear

The downside
