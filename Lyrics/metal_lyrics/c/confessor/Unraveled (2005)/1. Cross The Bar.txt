Too soon you have gone
Too late we have come
To accept what we lost
To reject what you won

Cross the bar, oh my friend
Cross the bar, to your end

The dreams they recur
The reality stays sound
The life that was lost
The death that was found

Cross the bar, oh my friend
Cross the bar, to your end

Handful of years
A pinch in time
You left us here
We sent you there
Everyday we remember

We hate what, what he took

Cross the bar, oh my friend
Cross the bar, to your end
