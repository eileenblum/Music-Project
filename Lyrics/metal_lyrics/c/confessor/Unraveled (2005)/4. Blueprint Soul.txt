My blueprint soul
Photographs of my years
Generations will know
MIllions revered

Now I see, all the things
From my kindness career I've retired
Skin away, my poor heart
Map out all my Frugal charts, map my frugal charts

My blueprint soul
Photographs of my years
Generations will know
MIllions revered

A section has been torn, it's been studied and forlorn
Specimen not to clone, but one that stands all alone
It stands all-alone

Healing must now begin, a new life to start herein

My blueprint soul
My blueprint soul
