a constellation of dreams
crumble to this foundation
on which we base them
every day, a rejected day

confidence is dimming
setting the mood to darkness
hesitating a sense of hope
it may lead to hopelessness
to exhibit any faith
it may impede any faith
therefore not to expect
secures no disappointment

the pain of rejection
dwells in the present
never to forger yesterday
(always wonder about tomorrow)
what's the deciding factor
what determines happiness
