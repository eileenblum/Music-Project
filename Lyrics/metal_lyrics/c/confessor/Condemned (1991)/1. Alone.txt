seems like nothings clear to me
I cant find my mind to pacify

countless millions dying alone
countless millions dying

alone with no signs of sadness, alone
nobody sees the pain

countless millions cry
attempting mass suicide

dying for help I hear their screams
to end their frantic dream

seems like nothings clear to me
