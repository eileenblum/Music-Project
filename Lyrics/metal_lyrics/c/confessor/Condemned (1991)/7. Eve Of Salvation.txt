the hinderance of thought
and dashed hopes of repute
hanging compulsion
leaves a grievous view

a malignant outlock
grows darker everyday
another consumption of pain
another leaven of dismay

glutton for relief
disorderly you find
perishment is choice
than a wretched life

insufferable intake
ejected from fortune
harbor one last dream
conclude your existance

abuse the essence
that's sordid from pain
relinquish the mind
that bellows with shame
accomplish your dream
indulge the demise
detect your salvation
by your unhinged mind
