joining me in your search of peace
the latest findings in your quest for pain
you reach, I resist, I forgive, you condemned
your expressions to condemned

condemned is everyone's belief
if not the same as yours

fantastic views of reality
seduction of your burning mind
you reach, I resist, I forgive, you condemned
your expressions to condemned

difference of oppinions
my way is not like yours
difference of oppinions
that does'nt I'm wrong
