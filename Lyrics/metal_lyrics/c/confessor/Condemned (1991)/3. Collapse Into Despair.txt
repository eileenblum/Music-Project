confronted with illusions
of twisted untold dreams
a fragment piece of none
falls slowly into place

collapse into despair
who will you find there
collapse into despair

I, I've endured in doubt
rapture's just a dream
to placate my mind
I must placate my soul

sorrow is all I feel today
Tomorrow is just another day

Darkness confronting all my dreams
Wasting away towards tomorrow's pain
