the unholy oppress the harmony
of the eternal blessedness
trough the rejection of the prophets

lend to trust transparency
the invicible one deludes reality
by the missionaries of sin
who evict virtue for fame

judgement of the marionettes
is decided on the goodness
determind by the divine
is your eternal suffering

suffer
suppress the righteous truth
impractical reasoning
blinds all those engulfed
in this prevariance

doleful dogma doubted by doom
jesters join with jaundice
progenitors profile the path
for flustered fools to figure
