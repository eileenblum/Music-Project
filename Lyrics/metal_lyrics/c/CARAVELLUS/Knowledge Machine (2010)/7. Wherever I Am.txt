Now everythingâs all right
The morning comes around
And after all the sadness has gone
But I need to leave you now
Thought my will is to be with you forever

Oh, itâs so hard living without you
You made me feel alive always

Wake up my love
Life must go on
The sun has gone
Announcing another day
Youâre not alone
My eternal love
Iâll take care with you
Wherever I am
Oh, Oh, Oh

You never be alone
You made the choice and I agreed
Wherever I am, wherever I am
Everyday looking for you
Oh, the sun has come
The morning comes around
Comes around, comes around
Wherever I am
