Life is a narrow road to walk
Where one false step can bring you down
Oh, but if this happens you need to lift
When you make the choice
No way back to the door
Keep on look forward
Try to find: redemption!

You still trying to understand this world
Keep running!

[Maracatu:]
Comes a time when we must bleed tears
Abandon your old fears
Like a vase filled your mind overflowed melancholy
You'll be wise to understand that the way is within you
A faint glow in your eyes and lights the flame of hope

[Chorus:]
Sail with me! Tell me your deepest dreams
Throw your sadness into the Sea of Bitterness
Trust me, your soul will soon be free
Now you can look the true and find your own route

The sea is darker than before
Forward you will facing the storm
Touch the sea and feel what you left behind
Keep Facing!

Comes a time when we must bleed tears
Abandon your old fears
Like a vase filled your mind overflowed melancholy
You'll be wise to understand that the way is within you
A faint glow in your eyes and lights the flame of hope

[Chorus:]
Sail with me! Tell me your deepest dreams
Throw your sadness into the Sea of Bitterness
Trust me, your soul will soon be free
Now you can look the true and find your own route
