Winds of agony
Bring me your mysteries
I set sail for your soul
Now I am by your side
Iâll give you hope and wise
Wake up and follow me
âCause trip has begun

Like a dream, every night
A whisper: âDonât give up!â
You are so far away from the right answers
This life is a piece of road that youâll walk to be strong
How you keep your guilt
Longed to be released from it
Life has no meaning anymore

Dance with me
Canât you feel the fantasy?
Let me guide your mind
Listen my melody, my symphony
Look at me
What you want from destiny?
Come with me throught the stars
Close your eyes and Iâll be back again!

No one could resist me
Not even you, my queen
Donât be afraid! Why are you crying?
Iâve come to answer your prayers
Now, the wine has no taste
What if I could give it back to you?

Oh Heather, pleased to meet you
My name is Calisto
Iâm not an illusion
Itâs real, just come with me
Donât try to understand from where I came or who I am
Just forget about that coil
Oh, most of all, you longed for death
But, hush now! âCause here I am
Let me turn on the light
