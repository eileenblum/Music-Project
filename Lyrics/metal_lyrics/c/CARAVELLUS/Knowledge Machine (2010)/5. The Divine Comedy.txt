Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita
mi ritrovai per una selva oscura
chÃ© la diritta via era smarrita.
Ahi quanto a dir qual era Ã¨ cosa dura
esta selva selvaggia e aspra e forte
che nel pensier rinova la paura! "

Wild Beasts have surged to me: Panther, Lion and Wolf
I felt so much fear, but itâs just the beginning
Then a strange came to meâ¦
Virgil, guide me! Across the journey
I donât walk alone
Itâs a hard way until Paradise
We just carry on! Through the Realms of the Deads to her arms

Now you can see your enemies, how many people were there?
Always you think about it, they were burning in hell

Virgil, guide me! Across the journey
I donât walk alone
Itâs a hard way until Paradise
We just carry on! Through the Realms of the Deads to her arms

Save me! Fellow-passenger
Now, use your bright like a passport to another world
There is someone to hug
How much time to arrive in Paradise?

Walking to your heart, there torns all the way
But Iâll never give anymore
I will face the death for you
I will face the nine circles until you
The time is running out
Everything I want to find you
My words are true

Itâs a hard way until Paradise
There is someone to hug â Itâs my desire!
Itâs a hard way until Paradise
I donât walk alone â We just carry on
Oh, itâs a hard way until Paradise!!!
