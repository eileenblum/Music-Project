I can feel my truthâs falling
Living in a world I donât belong
Inside a cage of appearances
Things that never should be done
Friends that never gave me a hand
And never stare into my eyes
And with a smile you are
Youâll be still trapped on this corner of lies

Now the anguish fills my heart
The damnation fills my eyes
All the enemies upon me
Betrayers as I never seen

Our lives cannot be corrupted by a black veil
They are liars behind the mask, hate full betrayers

I feel so cold, I think like dying
Depression come in me, stop the lies
Smash the mask!

Now the anguish fills my heart
The damnation fills my eyes
All the enemies upon me
Betrayers as I never seen

Our lives cannot be corrupted by a black veil
They are liars behind the mask, hate full betrayers
Itâs time to be true âcause the end of time has come
To the liars behind the mask, the time is coming
