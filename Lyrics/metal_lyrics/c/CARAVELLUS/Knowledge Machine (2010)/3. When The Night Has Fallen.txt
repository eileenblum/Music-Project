How many ways to decide, a way to follow
The time is short to change your life, another horizon
We are The Eye that behold the fallen Gods
Watching you! Something in you! Inside you!
Everyday reading your souls

Life is just a dangerous game to play
So on and on, weâre learning day by day
The light and shadows from the some place
This is your fate
But the true road is nothing far from here
You just have to want see

When the night has fallen
Brings the kiss of mercy
When the moonlight has gone
The sunriseâll arrive

Here, we are! Another day!
Breathing inside the toxic place
Here, we are! Trying to keep us alive
Struggling for a better life

Searching for a place, safe and free from slavery within
The chains so hard that destroy me inside
Looking for a seed of life we will save everything
Including you!

Life is just a dangerous gameâ¦

We are The Eye watching in the night
Searching for a place to live
Donât matter the time
The secrets unknown, weâll find someday
