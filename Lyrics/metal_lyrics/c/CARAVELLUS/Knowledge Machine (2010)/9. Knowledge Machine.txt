Doesnât take long time to understand that there are no limits to the imagination
Doesnât take long to turn this into a way to grow
But the longing to be greater is a cruel price that we pay

How can we be so fools?
The Heaven was there and now thereâs only darkness
How we can achieve it
Where are the old trees? I can only see machines
Itâs time to put together everything weâve learned and return to Paradise
Then we will see the blue sky and with you
Back to the past, stop the gears while there is time

Weâll reborn! If you believe as one
If you believe!
Weâll reborn! If you believe
If you believe as one

Children playing on the ashes of a decadent reign
Dressed in special clothes, using on a daily
Their parents are slaves of the villainy that just wants to profit and not leave us free

Oh, we have forgotten the old desires drafts of our lungs
Waiting for the day that I can return
Their parents are slaves of the villainy that just wants to profit and not leave us free
How can we be so fools?
The Heaven was there and now thereâs only darkness
How we can achieve it
Where are the old trees? I can only see machines
Itâs time to put together everything weâve learned and return to Paradise
Then we will see the blue sky and with you
Back to the past, stop the gears while there is time

Weâll reborn! If you believe as one
If you believe!
Weâll reborn! If you believe
If you believe as one
Thereâs time to change our lives
If you believe in a place for all
Weâll make a better world

Itâs time to surrender! Now, we need to decide how it will be our future
Itâs time to engagement! Already reached our last chance to build a new tomorrow

How can we be so fools?
The Heaven was there and now thereâs only darkness
How we can achieve it
Where are the old trees? I can only see machines
Itâs time to put together everything weâve learned and return to Paradise
Then we will see the blue sky and with you
Back to the past, stop the gears while there is time

Weâll reborn! If you believe as one
If you believe!
Weâll reborn! If you believe
If you believe as one
Thereâs time to change our lives
If you believe in a place for all
Weâll make a better world

Tears fallen down, blown by despair
Where is the awareness that we need?
Dark clouds go away, let me breathe
Before my life disappear

I hear a cry of the Earth lamenting our lack of love
Not want to hear it anymore

Disconnect your brain from your kingdom of illusion and come to the real world
Get out your bell jar and use what you know to save what remains

The readjusting: the device has changed
Then, we are programmed to a new beginning
Henceforth we will be alone
Restart the system of Knowledge Machine
