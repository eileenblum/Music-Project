Can you give me answers?
About the reason of life
Beyond science and religion
Why does we born and die?
Living inside illusions
Surrounded by the lies
But Iâll never believe it
I just follow my thoughts

Then we will remember things we said
We will feel the wind across our face

Looking through your eyes
Bleeding into me
Iâll be walking by your side
Donât slave your mind
Donât worry âbout me
Weâll be together again

There are mysteries beyond the skies
To know the Truth
Whereâll you go when you die?
Grow up! Thereâs so much to build
Learning to live your dreams

Tell me why
This worldâs living in disguise
Oh please, just tell me why
And what must we find
Maybe weâll find something

Then we will remember things we said
We will feel the wind across our face

Looking through your eyes
Bleeding into me
Iâll be walking by your side
Donât slave your mind
Donât worry âbout me
Weâll be together again

There are mysteries beyond the skies
To know the Truth
Whereâll you go when you die?
Grow up! Thereâs so much to build
Learning to live your dreams

[The Architect:]
â the time has come for you
With the last chance to change
No one can help you now
Just close up and take my hand
No time to hesitate
Decide or stay alone
The sand of timeâs strait
Leave the sadness and be strong
To face a better life
Iâll show you another place
To finally feel fine
For the rest of your days
So many things to do
So many things to learn
Now you have made your choice
Welcome to your ancient world!!!â

Looking through your eyes
Bleeding into me
Looking through your eyes
Bleeding into me
Iâll be walking by your side
Donât slave your mind
Donât worry âbout me
Weâll be together again

There are mysteries beyond the skies
To know the Truth
Whereâll you go when you die?
Grow up! Thereâs so much to build
Learning to live your dreams
