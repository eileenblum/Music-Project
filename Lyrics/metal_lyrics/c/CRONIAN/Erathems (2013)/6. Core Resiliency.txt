Ancestry recoils into future generations
An everlasting Heritage of catastrophe 
Revolving pillage of vast dimensions
Evolving drape of existential intoxication
Instinctively, Relentlessly
Oh, Glorious self-hostility

The Sky is red, cluttered by Man
The rainbow draped in shades of black
Washed in blood, polished by sand

Behold the ravished sky
The furious curtains aflame
At the verge of Human collapse
The existential communion derailed

Mankind's departure
Nature withstand
Core resiliency
The Future echoes in silence
An evolutionary branch of dead-end
Frequencies tone into oblivion
Complexity drains into sand
Impotency, Infertility 
Oh, Glorious self-emasculation

Stains the outskirts, mental insignia
Contaminated, intoxicated
Oh, Glorious self-mortality

Behold the ravished sky
The furious curtains aflame
At the verge of Human collapse
The existential communion derailed
