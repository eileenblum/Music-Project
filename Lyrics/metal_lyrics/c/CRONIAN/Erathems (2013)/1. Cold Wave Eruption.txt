"Volcanic ash clouds, incoming sunlight
Temperature drastically increases
Persistent snowing infects our sight
And our water supply freezes"

We're encompassed by inclement outbreak
Of unyielding forces, a disastrous invasion
Escalating the exposure with every snowflake
Gradually changing the Arctic oscillation.

Facing a year without a summer
Blizzards hit plains and portholes
Like a cold and striking hammer,
Feeding the glacier in our souls

A spiky landscape with unbendable fibres
Through a transparent gleaming filter
Frostbitten fields forever,
Where fire is the safest shelter

Facing a year without a summer
Blizzards hit plains and portholes
Like a cold and striking hammer,
Feeding the glacier in our souls

Cold wave eruption

We seek the heat of the rupture
As air bites in the harbour of gale
Inhaling the wind of thionic torture
At the burning palace that nature exhale

A cold wave erupts
From afar, from beyond
From above, from below
It halts the world here and now
Into the future with a ruinous past.
