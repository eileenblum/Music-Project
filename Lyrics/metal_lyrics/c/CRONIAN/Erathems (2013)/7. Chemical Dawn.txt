The fading colours of the horizon
The vast token of a chemical future
Hasting seasons, grinding weathers
Revoke the apocalyptic change of Eon

Vast, bleak and barren lands ahead
Ecological downfall, ethereal dilution
Feverish, in furious convulsion
Sensory deterioration, Reptilian restoration

Gasping for air
Through the rusty pipes of tomorrow
Gazing for light
Through the dusty scopes of hollow
Drain to drink, drained to sink

Patterns intractable, directions revolving
Oscillating moments, drifting semantics
Ratifications dissolved, chaos evolves
Humanity crumbles, deviancy trembles

Gasping for air
Through the rusty pipes of tomorrow
Gazing for light
Through the dusty scopes of hollow
Drain to drink, drained to sink

The dead, rancid waters I swallow

At the break of dawn
The Future breed of Mankind's seed
Contamination, intoxication
In disgust I bleed

Gasping for air
Through the rusty pipes of tomorrow
Gazing for light
Through the dusty scopes of hollow
Drain to drink, drained to sink
Chemical Dawn
