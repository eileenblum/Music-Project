Time comes
Raging and grandeur
Rises on the ground of relativity
The prime existential potency
The fusion of matters' scenery 

Time changes
Momentary circular
Bends into forever
The power of the waves
The golden clover of space

The warming noon of Man
Comfortably numb, swollen wealth
Domesticated thoughts of fever

The shimmering dawn of Man
Evolving through time and space
To conquer the outskirts of the frozen land
To conquer the profound depths
And ambitious heights

Time passes
Inevitably lost
Crumbles into the cosmic waste
The fires of history
The fatal liberty of synergy

Time changes
Momentary circular
Bends into forever
The power of the waves

Time passes
Inevitably lost
Crumbles into the cosmic waste
The fires of history

The shimmering dawn of Man
Evolving through time and space
To conquer the outskirts of the frozen land
To conquer the profound depths
And ambitious heights

The chilling nightfall of Man
End of harvest, end of heat
Revelation of the deepest truth
Revelation of the freezing ecocracy 

Time passes
Inevitably lost
Crumbles into the cosmic waste
The fires of history
