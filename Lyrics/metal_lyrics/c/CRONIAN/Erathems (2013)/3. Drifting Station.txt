Mounted on ice, carried by the current
To measure Earth's hydrosphere
Below white clouds, above black torrents
Embraced by the Northern celestial sphere

Built to operate in this terminal cold
An excursion of Life and Death
Following the drama behind a Human threshold
With the duality of mind and breath

I travel with a drifting station
In this Kingdom of flaming skies

Below the clouds, above black torrents

Drifting away from the present
Exposed for Gaia's obscure prime

I'm collecting Evolution
In the North pole's aeon old ice

Like a glimpse of future raiment
A new dissertation is written all over the clime

I travel with a drifting station
In this Kingdom of flaming skies

A frozen World with a clear message
Evolvement can't be defeated
And it replaces hope with knowledge
"Mission completed"

I'm collecting Evolution
In the North pole's aeon old ice
I travel with a drifting station
