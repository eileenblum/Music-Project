You speared the sea-bed
With advanced technology
In an ectopic act,
Supplying sanity's wreckage
You thrust the giant lance
Into the heart of Ecology,
Intensive detriment / Extensive damage

You built floating towers at the surface
To drain the World out of the deepest well 
You handed out the tools of wickedness
Unlimited income / Poisonous Hell

Explosions and fire storms ahead
Black fluid, oceanic contortion

You left behind this Heritage:
A bleeding Earth from a depraved experiment 
You turned out like a refined savage
Momentary lunacy / Historical torment

Throughout the continuous horizon

Explosions and fire storms ahead
Black fluid, oceanic contortion
Burning waves above a ruined sea-bed 
Throughout the continuous horizon

You painted the water's eclipse
Until the sea was calm and lifeless
You couldn't see the Apocalypse
Technological development / Human darkness

Explosions and fire storms ahead
Black fluid, oceanic contortion
Burning waves above a ruined sea-bed 
Throughout the continuous horizon
