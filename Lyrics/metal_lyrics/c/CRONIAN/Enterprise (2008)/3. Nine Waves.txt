The oceans, the freezing passages
Wipe out the traces of the mankind
Eradicate glance once released
Uphold the order of the cycles
The patterns of the stellar rage

To ravish the insomniac dynasty
With the pale northern tranquillity
Screams cease to silence and no rumble
The fire, fierce, calms to ashes and debris

Ocean waves, the pulse of time
Beats through the icy kingdom
A chapter to open, a story to close
A moment of release, a heart that froze
Nine waves

Ashore, throughout the nine waves
Adore, the memory of the cronian seas
The lore, the era of equilibrium
Summer and winter
Autumn and spring
The entire entity

The utter province of the world
The habutation of all domination
Adrift and afloat, yet sinking
The final adventure of man's proclamation

Ocean waves, the pulse of time
Beats through the icy kingdom
A chapter to open, a story to close
A moment of release, a heart that froze
Nine waves

Ashore, throughout the nine waves
Adore, the memory of the cronian seas
The lore, the era of equilibrium
Summer and winter
Autumn and spring
The entire entity

Ocean waves, the pulse of time
Beats through the icy kingdom
A chapter to open, a story to close
A moment of release, a heart that froze
