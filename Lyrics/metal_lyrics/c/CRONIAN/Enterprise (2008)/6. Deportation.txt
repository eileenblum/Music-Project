Somewhere in the maze
Mankind's solace is rendering
Throughout the starlit haze
The woven rim groans eagerly

Monochrome forecast of the future
Poetry of the incoherent rhymes
Is the last speech of mother earth
End of the journey the fall of night
The curtains of greed fade the light

A history of evolution
Ages of constructions
Moments of endurance
The glimpse of reproduction
Selection evolving to perfection
Balancing without distraction
A glorious heritage
Left behind, by the blind

Somewhere in the face
The children's tears sparkle
Yet there is no place to become
Neither father nor mother
Neither brother nor sister
Deportation

Ice melted, water drained
Skies are red, air that chokes
The shallow horizon stains
Trees blooms in grey
Not for another day
Deportation

A history of evolution
Ages of constructions
Moments of endurance
The glimpse of reproduction
Selection evolving to perfection

Neither father nor mother
Neither brother nor sister
Deportation
