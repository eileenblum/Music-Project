The icy path, the steep passage uphill
Soaks in the steps of infinity
Through this withering weather
Blazing the moments of reality

At the plains, the highest compound
Of the frozen constellations
The defiance of degeneration
The gravity of existence

Where the stars descend
Where the sun deserts
Illusions delusive
The encounter
...of the above and below

Time coils with reaons coherent
Serenity exuded and benightened

Where the stars descend
Where the sun deserts
Illusions delusive
The encounter
...of the above and below

At the plains, the highest compound
Of the frozen constellations
The defiance of degeneration
The gravity of existence

The encounter

From the melting shores to the icy hills
The route from the membrane to the core
A ladder of evolution, a crossroad of confusion
Sharpens the spear of delineations

From the icy hills to the melting shores...

From the melting shores to the icy hills
A ladder of evolution
The encounter
...of the above and below
