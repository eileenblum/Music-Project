As soon as we held sceince key
Our thinking became infected
We tried to reclaim to cronian sea
Like infinitely wise we acted

But the sea conquered our toil
Still we knew it all
With egos firm as frozen soil
Our mastery began the poles fall

Like a dying season we fell asleep
Our sensibility desisted to grow
The pit of stupudity seems ocean deep
As we still bury our heads in the snow

We have to handle preparation before we summon erudition
Otherwise wthe world's like glaze
Transparent, but a slippery derision
That covers the earthly maze
And we're lost in haze

Alarm! Alert! Wake up from your (un)conscious
Adjust your soul to this colure's frequency
We need a cessation of failing nunscious
And hibernation is a way to consult modesty

As the barren lands becomes grime
The biomes suffer by our torment
Cause we are insulated by time
Result: awake but dormant

Like a dying season we fell asleep
Our sensibility desisted to grow
The pit of stupudity seems ocean deep
As we still bury our heads in the snow

We need maturation of our capacity
Hibernation is a way to consult modesty
