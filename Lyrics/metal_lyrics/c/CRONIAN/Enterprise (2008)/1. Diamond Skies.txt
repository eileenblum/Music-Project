The skies of a future horizon
Blind my sight like an icy spear
Like a beam through a starlit mirror
Illumination of the world entry

Millions and billions of shining embers
The stellar manifestation of the skies
Like a frozen leash of gleaming moments
Tied to the seeking glare of my eyes

The illusion of existence
Frozen by this winterland
The purpose of revival
The coherent collusion

Millions and billions of shining embers
The stellar manifestation of the skies
Like a frozen leash of gleaming moments
Tied to the seeking glare of my eyes

Through the hidden realm of the fallen
Where the predatory effusion rises
Concourse - the dwell superior to every war

Man and nature
Fire and ice
Under the diamond skies

Emaciated yet strong, shaded yet sharpen

Diversity of colours fades to monochrome
The mundane weakens to starve
Hours disrupt in a glimpse of moments
The horizon fall with the snowflake

Man and nature
Fire and ice
Under the diamond skies
