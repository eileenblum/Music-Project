Earth inclines away from the sun
As the cold season is improving
At my viewpoint, a palace of eccentricity
Where the whole scenerey is moving

Nature's monuments in a transpolar drift
(Casting dark blue shadows that we fear)
The coastline ends up in this delta's rift
(A dynamism ignited by the obliquity of spheres)

Standing still, still travelling through an area of ice
By a slowly rotating current that leads the stream clockwise

An omnificent hall of brutal adventures
Ejecting islands from a polar den
Formation - growth - deformation - disintegration
At the annual snowline, again and again

I'm sailing on crystal sheets
Where explorers met tremendous drama
The scenery's harshness can't deplete
Imagination's cyclorama

I'm on the move, or is it the world?
Nature stages a shifting play
By uniquitous events my view is purled
And lionized by ablation's pray

Standing still, still travelling through an area of ice
By a slowly rotating current that leads the stream clockwise
