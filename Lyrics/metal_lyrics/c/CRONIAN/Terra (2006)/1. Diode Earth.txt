[Ãysten G. Brun]

The fuse is about to burn
Energy ignites the frames
The halo around and through
Flares in the sea-color blue

The fable is about to regain
No order is here to endure
Disruption will come true
Final eruption of the icy blue

Hypothermic future
Gate to a new existence
Never to let anyone through
Neither a glimpse nor a view

Earth concealed, never again to be revealed
An evolutionary implosion, summary erosion
Mankind had its chance, no more advance
Diode Earth

The route is about to turn
Failed existence - error
An ending has come through
That summons me and you

Earth concealed, never again to be revealed
An evolutionary implosion, summary erosion
Mankind had its chance, no more advance
Diode Earth
