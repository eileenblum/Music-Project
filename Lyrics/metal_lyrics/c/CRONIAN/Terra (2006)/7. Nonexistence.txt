[Ãysten G. Brun]

The polar sun protrudes through the frozen wilderness
As the endeavours of the silent wanderer summon in vain
Cease to exist as the blood crystallizes blending with snow
I am there; I was there - in Nature's fierce trap

The flesh is frozen covered by layers of numbling snowflakes
Assail at this square of ice amidst the enervating worlds
A dream of endurance torn in pieces hollow and in vain
This is my last passage through the state of being sane

Equal to nonexistent, drifting away
Untamed courses, swifts astray
To another time, to another bay
To a nonexistence...

At the top of the world, yet in deepest sorrow
The endeavouring character of cruelty and love
The brilliance of death, the pursuant of life
Rumbling at this square of my deterioration

The polar sun protrudes through the frozen wilderness
I am amongst the pale, frozen haze, like a dream
The light weakens upon the sea of everlast
Yet the horizon is crystal bright, the air cold and light

Equal to nonexistent, drifting away
Untamed courses, swifts astray
To another time, to another bay
To a nonexistence...
