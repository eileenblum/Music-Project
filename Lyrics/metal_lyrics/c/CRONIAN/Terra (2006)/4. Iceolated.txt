[Andreas Hedlund]

In this wasteland mankind has found its curse,
The suffocative coldness and the ice storms
Still, I am standing on a frozen universe,
A sealed space for unknown life forms

Where centuries of blizzards have paraded
To conceal organisms' survival
From a distant sun this essence invaded
Our world, tender and pervial

A riddle in Cosmo biology,
Existence without metabolism and fetor
Crystallized cells that found an analogy
To breed inside a massive isolator

Under the hostile surface, dwelling in the dark
Like a mysterious and unseen ghost
Waiting to consume daylight's spark
And find a suitable host

Imitating the known human guise,
A bacterium supernatural
From hidden depths in the multilayered ice
It adapted to the new material

A riddle in Cosmo biology,
Existence without metabolism and fetor
Crystallized cells that found an analogy
To breed inside a massive isolator

It was Iceolated
Until it gyrated
Around our numb and innermost
Structure, until it became our host
