[Andreas Hedlund]

I've conjured my visions awake
To render excitement to pride
I visit the old for this sake
And credulously follow the guide,

A natural thought which I can't omit
Outspoken by the sagacious alp
Leading upwards to the summit
That the luminary sun scalps

Thousands of obstacles pass my way
Mile-wide rivers and abyss-deep questionings
Within the senses I feel astray
Effected by the human reasoning

The greatest alp is my own perception
Of my skills in relation to the rock
So, the highest summit is the senses' inception
Not a planestesimal or material parrock

At childhood I started to climb manhood
At manhood I climb the future
Progression is the only ladder, good
Enough to mount failure

To my awareness I am the same factor
As the blizzard is to the mountainside
A both creative and destructive actor
That carries the circumstances inside

Among Alps - my mind is the highest peek
