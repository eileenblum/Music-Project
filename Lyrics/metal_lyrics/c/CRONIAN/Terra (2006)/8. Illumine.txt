[Ãysten G. Brun]

Frozen columns spearing the horizon
Gazing throughout the stellar endlessness
Alone at the peak of sole endurance
Under the blue and desolated skies

At the frontier of the icy wasteland
Grid by the urge for a new conquest
A discovery, a spiritual recovery
A moment of profound release

Illumine - the everlasting path
Illumine - the broad horizon

At the polar mesial, the foreland
To unleash, rove and to cease
No way back at the end of this track
Where the sun is my friend, fiend and decease

At the end of the icy wasteland
The last resort, the last deport
Traces beyond the stellar map
Coexistent from here on

Illumine - the noble moments
Illumine - the cause of those

I am here to die..
