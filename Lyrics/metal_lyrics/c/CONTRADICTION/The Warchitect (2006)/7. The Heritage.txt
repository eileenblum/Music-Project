Don't believe the shit
The mighties keep to tell
These words are coming
Straight from hell

Go strong, courageous and just
The way the fathers have told
In truth and justice you shall trust
Remind the words they wrote

Clean your mind
Truth you'll find

Standing tall
Never fall
Hear the call
The heritage

Don't believe the words
The preachers keep to tell
Their book is coming
Straight from hell

Go strong, courageous and just
The way the fathers have told
In truth and justice you shall trust
Remind the words they wrote
