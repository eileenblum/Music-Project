World so bad, liberty rotsSlaughter the lamb in the name of god A place like hell as long as they tellStories of good and tales of bad Axis of evil against allies of the braveAs long as they live no one will be saved A place like hellAs long as they tellWho is good and who is bad? Claiming the truthThe final abuseThe crowd is going mad I will break the silenceI will end all violenceWill you get on your knees?When I will bring you peace Mouth of madnessMankind starts to bleedWithout forgiveness and unholy deed A place like hellAs long as they tellWho is good and who is bad? Claiming the truthThe final abuseThe crowd is going mad
