We are sent to tell
In the name of the lord of hell
Punishment begins
Atonement for your sins

Here comes the storm before the calm
Just get the book and read the psalm

Thunderstorm coming down
Run for cover on your own
Thunderstorm brings the drown
Thunderstorm - The all ending dawn

You don't need to run
No place left under the sun
Time is running out
Mouth of madness eating the crowd

Down with the face
All fate is done
Caught in the race
Carnage has begun
