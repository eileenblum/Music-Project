Power
The force within
We're coming out to make you bleed

Violence
The pain within
We're thrashing round to make you feel

Energy
Metal supremacy
Through high intensity
The power within is we'll set it free

Energy
Violent ascendancy
The thrashing courtesy
The power within us we'll set it free

Loudness
The noise in front
We will get you by your balls

Movement
No choices left
The contragroove will get you all

Faster
The speed of light
We're coming round to bring the sound

Metal
The heavy sound
Lifetime compressed the moment rules
