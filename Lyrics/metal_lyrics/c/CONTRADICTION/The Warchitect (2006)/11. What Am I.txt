Hey guys!
I have something to tell you motherfuckers
So open your ears
I won't repeat it...

I'm not you cunt
Don't treat on me
'Cause you will decline
When vengeance is mine

Times are bad
Feeling sad
Hear it roaring
Fear and loathing

Violent ages
Hard cash rages
Voice of hatred
Terminated

Ages gone
We are still at hand
You are done
Hatred never ends

Out of control
I'm full of wrath
When you will demise
You pain shall arise
