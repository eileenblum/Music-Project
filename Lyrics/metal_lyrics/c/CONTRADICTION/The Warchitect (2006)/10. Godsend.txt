Older than time I am
Older than mankind I am

Hidden in the dark - Demon
Darkness the reason I live

I am the master of disguise
I am the priest of all lies
I am the master of disguise
I am the lord of the flies

I'm coming down
To bring the ends
The sword of justice
I'm godsend

I'm on the way
To bring the end
The sword of justice
I'm godsend

Judge of mankind I am
Revenge the reason I am

Coming from above - Warhead
Reborn through violence I am
