Life of despair
Misleaded way
Time to adjust
Today's the day

You sacrifice your destiny
I will be there and I will give you peace

Bad things done
Wrong way gone

I'm your god, your bliss, your fate
The voice inside your head
I'm your lord, your hell, your grief
Now I dominate you

A thousand years
I'll wait for you
And in the end
I'm coming through

You're offering a precious thing
Just go my way and I will get your soul
