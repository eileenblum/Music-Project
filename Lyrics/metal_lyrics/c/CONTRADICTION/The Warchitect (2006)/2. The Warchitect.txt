To hit and to fight is my greatest delight
I'm bringing fear and pain
Don't you call me insane?

My troops are heading to anywhere I like
You can't staunch the bleeding
Ready for another major strike
Machines of war we're feeding

My will to kill
You pain, my thrill
To kill my will
I like to kill

Warchitect
Face the fact
Leader of the world
I am the Warchitect
Disrespect
Master of the warmachine

Murder is right
The law is by my side
I am the perfect state
Delivering your fate

My troops are heading to anywhere I like
You can't staunch the bleeding
Ready for another major strike
Machines of war we're feeding

I am the state
I am your fate
