Down from the skies
From lofty places
The warlords come again

Destroyers of the world
Erasers of mankind
Born to eliminate

Tunes of war
Times of fear

From down below
They're climbing up
Created to destroy

Up to the swords
It's time to fight
Against the dark
Protect the light

Tunes of war
Times of fear

Hand in hand
We will stand
We will fight
For the right

We will stand
As one man
Age of pain
War again
