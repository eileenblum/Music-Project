Lost in chaos
Lost in fear
Feeling empty
No more tears

Nightmare - where I'm gone
Sorrows for what I've done

This chaos coming from within
The punishment for all my sins
The penalty for all my lies
For a life lived in disguise

I will regret when I will get absolution for my faults

I will repent

Roll the bones
Seal your fate
Heart of stone
I'm desperate

Lost in turmoil
Lost all hope
No more control
End of my rope

Soul inferno
Endless pain
Hearing voices
Gone insane

Roll the bones
Seal your fate
Heart of stone
I'm desperate
Only shadows
No more light
Soul turns black
Eternal night
