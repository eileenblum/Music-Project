War - The devastating force
Greed - The power from within
Hatred - Makes you strong
Grind - Your enemies

Confrontation
Detestation
Violation
Risk of damnation

The end of all things to come
No chances left to be done
There's no escape from the global cage

The abyss is what we see
Here comes the final decree
The closing step leads over the edge

Crush - Just kill the things you see
Waste - The world philosophy
Wrong - We desecrate our time
Shred - Their lies you must deny
