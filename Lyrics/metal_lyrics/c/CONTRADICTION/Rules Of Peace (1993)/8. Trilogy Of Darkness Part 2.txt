Don't you know, we are living like dogs
We have to fight to get rid of the chains
I want you for revolution now
It's time to rise with power
Democratic lies and meaningless decisions
Are taken by corrupt politicians
They want to control the human race
It's time to rise with power

Now hear the words I have to say â obey
Don't follow them on this dangerous way
Don't believe the rubbish that they pray â obey
Termination shouldn't be our fate

They created so many problems in the past
The damages they caused
For a long time they will last
Open up your mind and you will see:
It's time to rise with power
Third world exploited by economic interest
Whole world dying by destructive contest
There is no escape from a globe of fire
So it's time to rise with power

Now hear the words I have to say â obey
Don't follow them on this dangerous way
Don't believe the rubbish that they pray â obey
Termination shouldn't be our fate
