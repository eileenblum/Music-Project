Don't you know what I think about you?
I've never loved your face
I only feel hate when I see you
Don't you understand?
Just wait a minute and I'll beat you up
If you don't get out of my way
You will feel my fist and it'll be hard for you
'Cause you will lose at last

Don't you understand that I really hate you?
So make my day, you ugly motherfucker
I really hope that we'll never meet again
And if I see you here again, you slimy son of a bitch
You will die hard and full of pain you'll scream
So many feelings full of hate
Reserved only for you

When I get you in my fingers
So many things I can do
It brings me high to stomp on you
Smashing down your head

And when you breathe your last breath
You'll remember what I've said:
Don't you understand that I really hate you?
You say that I'm cruel â so what!?
