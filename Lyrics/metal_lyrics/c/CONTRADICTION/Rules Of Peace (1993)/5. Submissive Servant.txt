You know why they took you here
'Cause there are people that I don't like
No make them disappear
Obey me without fear â no fear
Mortality â I don't wanna hear
Again they're trying to bestir
And I want them to die
Because they lie

Evil â yes, that's what I am
Master â and you have to play my game
Evil â victim of mortality
Master â you tool of bestiality

There's a burden I can't bear
'Cause most of them don't want to follow me
In my opinion this is insincere
I'm not an unknown personality
They use to call me a criminal
Ridiculous â you know the real me
Eliminate without no fear
Dignity â I don't want to hear
