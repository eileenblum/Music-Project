Just look around, all you see is just an illusion
No way out, there's no way our for you
Material success is what you need to survive
In this world â a realm of money and corruption

Follow me â I will show you the way

Pray â you don't know to whom you have to pray
Pray â I will be your god and your destiny
Pray â independence, a nice price you have to pay
Pray â you will change your life the way I say

Perversion of justice is justifiable?
Power â they got the power but they don't got the right
Perfunctory, conformity, slavery, misery
Dignity â they really got no dignity

Pray â you don't know to whom you have to pray
Pray â I will be your god and your destiny
Pray â independence, a nice price you have to pay
Pray â you will change your life the way I say

Pray to me
Just do it as I say
If it's done how I say
We will live in harmony

Pray to me
Just do it as I say
If it's done how I say
We will live in harmony
