Our world is dying, the sky is burning red
Walking this day, it will be the end
What shall we do? Who wants to show us the way?
If we don't find a solution, we're going
To challenge judgement day
I remember a time when there were birds on the trees
Now those trees have stopped to breathe
The birds flew away, so far away

Don't you see the rivers, the oceans and seas?
Mother Gaya is dying, falling down on her knees
Don't you know the fountain of life is running dry?
To be one of the guilty I can't deny

To save environment
Our common task is endangered
We may repent to rely on politicians
You will see my friend
It's the shortest way into dead end
Where are the people full of hope?
Ready to preserve our life-giving globe
Follow the words that I use to pray
Otherwise feel the judgement day

Don't you see the rivers, the oceans and seas?
Mother Gaya is dying, falling down on her knees
Don't you know the fountain of life is running dry?
To be one of the guilty makes me cry
