Don't you see the people destroying the world?
Atomic bombs are threatening
They may kill us several times over
History ends by starting new wars

Nuclear disaster

Large areas polluted by nuclear trash
Health-hazards torment mankind
We are exposed to our own toxic waste
Challenging the death of human life

Nuclear disaster

Don't you see what's going on?
Forests are rotting by pollution
Don't you know what's happening?
Children are born into this cruel world
Don't you recognize?
Catastrophes are afflicting the world
Don't you feel ashamed?
You don't care about, you even close your eyes

Don't you see the madness?
To create in order to destroy
Don't you know what's going on?
Foolish decisions, made by politicians
Don't you recognize?
We lead our world straight to the end
And don't you feel ashamed?
You don't care about, you even close your eyes

Now, get yourself in action, each one is needed
It's not too late to commit yourself for survival of life
It won't be in vain 'cause you're not alone
We are to avoid the process of destruction

Nuclear disaster
