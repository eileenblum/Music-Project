I'm always watching what you're doing
And you better do it right
Because when you do an evil thing
I'm coming in the night

Even a little mistake will be punished
So be careful what you do
They call me The Hunter â The Punisher
And I'm justice's working hand

When I gaze into your face
Into your eyes
You will know your time has come
Don't try to run away from me
You've got no chance

Today's your judgement day
I always keep an eye on you
What you still can believe
I've always done it and I've done it well

There's no reprieve
And when you feel my hammer
Smashing down your head
I'll break your neck gazing into your eyes
And you will never forget
