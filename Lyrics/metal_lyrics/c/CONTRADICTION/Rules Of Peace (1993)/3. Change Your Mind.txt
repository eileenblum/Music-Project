Needful things and needful laws
You're giving to me but I cannot agree
I don't want to hear what you are telling me
'Cause I have to decide for myself

I don't mind what you say
Yes, I don't mind

You think you're a wise man but I call you a fool
You don't need to know it all, you only need to grow
Know-how is not all â humanity counts
Reflect yourself and you will see

You have to change your mind
Change your mind

What you say and what you do is not mu interest
Not my goal, I don't care what you say 'cause
I can't believe you

Needful things and needful laws
You're giving just to me
I don't wanna hear about it
'Cause I cannot agree
You think you're a wise man but I call you a fool
You don't need to know it all, you only need to grow
You only have to change your mind
Say you will
Say you will
Say you will
Say you will
