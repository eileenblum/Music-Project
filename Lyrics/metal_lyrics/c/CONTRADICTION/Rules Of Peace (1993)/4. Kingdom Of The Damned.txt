Life can be so cruel when death is coming closer
I have to face it certain â I have to face it now
Filled with sickness â no cure â my dying is for sure
Infected by a deadly sin â but I don't want to die

Kingdom of the damned â outcast

There is a place of endless suffering
Where you will feel alone
'Cause anxious friends will be your sorrow
If you've entered danger zone

There is a place of endless suffering
Where you will feel alone
Where you will see no future
It's called the twilight zone

My blood's contaminated by a virus in labs created
Irresponsible experiments for war-technology
Disease â no cure â my dying is for sure
Infected by artificial sins â I don't want to die

We are the people from the kingdom of the damned
The people put to death
We have to realize
That we have to pay the price
