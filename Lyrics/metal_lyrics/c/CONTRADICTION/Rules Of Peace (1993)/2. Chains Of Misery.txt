Telling sunshine when there's rainfall
Bit I know that you deceive us all
Don't tell us of democracy
It's your certificate of poverty
Watching wars instead of act
Human rights you do neglect
What's about equality?
Common welfare â I can't see

You are so unbelievable
Your chains of misery
Make me pay endlessly
You are so unbelievable
Your chains of misery
Bring me down

You don't care how I feel
You don't care about my life
You don't care what I think
Think about...

You are so unbelievable
Your chains of misery
Make me pay endlessly
You are so unbelievable
Your chains of misery
Bring me down

You don't care how I feel
You don't care about my life
You don't care what I think

Telling sunshine when there's rainfall
Bit I know that you deceive us all
Don't tell us of charity
'Cause you are hated by majority
Take a look at your allowances
Continuously they increase
Do you know that there is joblessness?
Your fault â You don't confess

You are so unbelievable
Your chains of misery
Make me pay endlessly
You are so unbelievable
Your chains of misery
That bring me down
