In words there is a human line
The truth is that there's none
Decency becomes a foreign word
Replaced by money, it is gone

Measures to exploit me
Corruptibility
Intentions to shape history?
I won't listen any longer 'cause you only...

Lie â You lie
Lie â You lie
Lie â You lie
Lie â You lie

Hey fool, you really see a difference
Your brain seems to be filled with emptiness
Racial comments â evidence of ignorance
Your attitude is meaningless

I'm fed up with your narrow mind
Pure stupidity
You're doing harm to mankind
I won't listen any longer 'cause you only...

Your keep telling me that you're in love with me
And emphasize it twice a day
But recently I found your diary
Where all those guys stood in our way

"This love is ever-lasting"
"Next week is the wedding"
"No doubts, this is the real love"
I won't listen any longer 'cause you only...

Lie â You lie
Lie â You lie
