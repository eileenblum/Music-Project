Darkness â embracing the world
Prayers â are only heard
Violence â is all I see
Sorrow â surrounding me

When the sun is going down
The king will lose his crown
And day will never break again
All we did is now in vain

Victims â killed by death
They've taken â their final breath
Ulcers â of society
Standing right â in front of me

When the sun is going down
The king will lose his crown
And day will never break again
All we did is now in vain
