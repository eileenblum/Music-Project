Misjudgin' any kind
Lady Justice, are you blind?
Go and use the sword
Smash those who spit on you

I hate the way they deceive
Hate the way they used to be
Laughter behind my back
I've got no confidence

'Cause they oppress the masses
Strucking them with blindness
Despising human rights
No liberty â the sight

What they say is all we hate
What they do is all we hate

System of necessity
Pretended democracy
Forced to subjugate ourselves
No right to determinate

They oppress the masses
Strucking them with blindness
Despising human rights
No liberty â the sight

Lies â we hate all their lies
Crimes â all those hidden crimes
Burglary â your taxes caused our misery
Waste â just spend it on your insanity
