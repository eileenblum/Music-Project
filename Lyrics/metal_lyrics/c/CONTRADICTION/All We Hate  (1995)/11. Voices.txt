I hear the voices from the underground
I hear them begging me for coming down
I hear them calling me

They've got to go away
I want to see just one more day
I can't believe
Oh! I can't believe my time has come

They give me promises of better times
I hear them claiming to be friends of mine
I hear them calling me

Lovely voices seducing me to suicide
To be one of those
Joining their circle tonight

"We set you free from agony"
"Take place in a better society"

I hear the voices from the underground
I hear them begging you for coming down
Can you hear me calling you?
