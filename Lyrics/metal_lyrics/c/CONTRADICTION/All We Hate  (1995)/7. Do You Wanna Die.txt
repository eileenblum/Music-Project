You are hunted by your visions
Hallucination, day dreams
Madness is following you
Reaching for your mind
Your brain is damaged by drugs
Your life is an endless horror trip
Voices screaming from behind:
Hey! You're gonna die tonight

They're crawling through the night
Waiting for you to start up the fight
You're creeping through the day
Standing at the edge of insanity

You don't need to hide
'Cause they will find you soon
If you don't stop sonning your brain
Your life is just in vain
Don't lose control over your mind
Voices screaming from behind:
Hey! You're gonna die tonight
