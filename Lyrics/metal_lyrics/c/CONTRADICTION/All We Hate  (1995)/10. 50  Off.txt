You can buy a bitch for just a fuck
Have a lot of fun for fifty bucks
So tell me, guy, do you respect them?
I guess not 'cause you're really free

I would like to see all the beauty of the world
No satisfaction â living life in modesty
What can I do to taste sugar every day?
Please, tell the truth, is my soul under lock and key?

Don't sell
Don't sell

Don't sell it less
This range of your soul

I do believe
I'm no myself
Feel like a bitch
Without liberty

What's your price? Guy

Don't sell it less
This range of your soul
