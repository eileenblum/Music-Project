What do you mean...what life is worth?
Why do you say...my life is worse?
I don't like the way you're giving rules to me
Telling me the way my life has to be
Domination from the day of my birth
Making my lifetime to hell on earth

Lifetime
You're wasting my time

Why can't you see... that I wanna be...
Wanna be free? ...You have to agree

You're wasting my time
You're wasting my life
You're wasting my power
You're wasting me

My time has comes
You won't give me no more rules
Today is the day, I ain't no more the fool
My time has come â now I'm ruling you
And I'm giving your life that hell on earth

Lifetime â now I'm wasting your time
Lifetime â now I'm wasting your life
Lifetime â now I'm wasting your power
Lifetime â now I'm wasting you 'til the end
