Terror â all around my head
Voices â disturbing thoughts
Feelings â burning down my soul
Sickness â is all I feel

The wheel of time is running low
Insanity â infiltrating mu soul

I always feel this pain inside
A migraine headache on left head side

Suffering from mental pain
Can't avoid I'm going insane
My movements are delayed
Completely isolated
My mind is losing consciousness
Chorea minor â sickness

I always feel this pain inside
A migraine headache on left head side
Migraine headache boiling my brain
Suicide to release me from that pain
