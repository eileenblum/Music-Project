You've never done what you've told
I don't believe your imaginary deeds
Pretended things, not even worth
A word of mine â you've only lied

Why do you need to tell these stories?
Why do you need to distinguish yourself?

You've made up those hero tales
Commanding respect â don't understand
Searching for appreciation
But I've got your number
Pulling down your mask

Why do you need to tell these stories?
Why do you need to distinguish yourself?

Pretender
Pretender
Pretender
Pretender
