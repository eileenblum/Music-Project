Call yourself the master of the masses
You bring sadness to

Let them fight for you
To make your dreams come true
You're ruling the world...

But I'm the one who's gonna stop
You let us people bleed
You and your dirty greed
You put yourself a monument
You for leading us into dead end

War of races
Exterminate their faces
Delivery of pain
The outcome of your reign

You're telling lies
Hide in disguise
Looking in your face
The pure disgrace

Accusations
Defamations...
Always alibis
Violation
Confrontation...
That's your paradise

What about... the innocent? Left to die
What about... the people? Left to die
What about... the innocent? Left to die
What about... the people? Left to die
