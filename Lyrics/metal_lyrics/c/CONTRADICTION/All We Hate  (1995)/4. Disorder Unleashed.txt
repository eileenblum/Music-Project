Days of chaos, armies on the streets
Shooting the masses, people are in rage
Mass execution to stop the revolution
Legal aggression against progression

Day of terror, disorder unleashed
Against the power of those who are forcing us
To suffer under the establishment
Destroy the power of those who are forcing us to die

Piece by piece

Renewal of an antiqued system
National desires are meaningless
The wish for peace and eco-balance
Nations come together by the will of the people
