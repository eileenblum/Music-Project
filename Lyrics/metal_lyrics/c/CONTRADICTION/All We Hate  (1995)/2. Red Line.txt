Just take a look in history
And you will see
Thousand years of pain and misery
Thousand years of  greed and hate
That is human race's fate

Violence is all I see
I don't want to be
In a world full of hate
Warfare is the fate

Looking back two thousand years
A preaching man nailed on the cross
Nobody took his words for granted
Of spreading lies he was convicted

Starting wars for profit - Ruthlessness
Genocide for money - Your Business
