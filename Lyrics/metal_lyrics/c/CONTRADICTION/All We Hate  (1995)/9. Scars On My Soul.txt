I loved you and I never will forget
How you touched my skin
But you betrayed me â what a crime
Love turns to hate

Now I stand alone
Trying to forget you
And what you did to me
Waiting for revenge

Do you really think I can forget?
Do you really believe I will forgive?
Oh! What a fool! Did you think about
That you've scratched scars on my soul?

In my fantasy you're dying a thousand deaths
With my fist I smash your face
I make you suffer from pain you can't imagine
And I know no grace â only revenge
