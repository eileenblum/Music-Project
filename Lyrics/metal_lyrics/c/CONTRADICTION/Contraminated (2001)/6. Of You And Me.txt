All of these days
Were passing beyond
The cause for delays
You lost the ground
In times of tension
I offered it all to you
You paid no attention
So please, let me go

Now we feel sorry
That is the sad story
Of you and me
No future to see

All of these days
I spent hoping
Made future plans
While you were provoking
The end that I face
It's my silent farewell
No final embrace
See you in hell

Now we feel sorry
That is the sad story
Of you and me
No future to see
