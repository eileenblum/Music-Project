Try to fall
Endlessly
And the ground will have you soon
Try to fly
And to reach the sky
You will never touch the moon

We're all waiting for the day
That takes our tears away
For someone we can follow
To overcome the sorrow
We're all waiting for the day
That takes our tears away
That will be giving us access
To joy and happiness

You're so proud
Of what you are
And of everything you do
You're not aware
And never take care
What others should means to you?

We're all waiting for the day
That takes our tears away
For someone we can follow
To overcome the sorrow
We're all waiting for the day
That takes our tears away
That will be giving us access
To joy and happiness
