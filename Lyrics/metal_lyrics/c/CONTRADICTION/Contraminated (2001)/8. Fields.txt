Now the time has come
They want you to join the war
Follow the leaders
Do not ask what is it for
Bullets flying all around
Grenades smashing bodies to the ground
Soldiers dying by the gun
People on the run

No one's crying when someone's dying
That's how it feels on the killing fields

Operation is complete
Battle is already lost
Imprisoned by the enemy
Freedom's what it cost
Peace, peace...
Screaming just for peace
No one's sure who's won the war
Do not ask what was it for

That is how it is
When the mighty ones are playing war
Cannon-fodder is the game
Democracy...? No more
Their eyes ranging the battlefield
A hundred thousand young men killed
Human flesh to feed the gun
But business is going on
