I know, oh, I know for sure
That the sun won't shine anymore for me
I see, yes, I see the light but it seems
That I cannot reach out for it
That's the tragedy of my life
That is the reason why I'm feeling dead
It's the matter that I cut me out
Cut myself out of reality

I am rotting from the inside
Rot
Slowly rooting from the inside
Pain will remain
Pain will remain

Life, what means life to me?
Nothing more than pain and suffering
Everything I've loved before
I have lost in a moment of disgrace
I had seen it coming down
Helpless, innocent and alone
But it's the fate god gave to me
No escape from my misery
