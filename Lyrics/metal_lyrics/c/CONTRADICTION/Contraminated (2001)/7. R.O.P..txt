Take a look to those people there
And you will realize
That peace is impossible for us
Until they won't face the truth

Fire â see the light
Destroys â terrible sight
Blood-red â holy fire
...to serve their God

Totally possessed to kill
By old man's commands
Together they are following his will
Genocide's what he demands

Fire â see the light
Destroys â terrible sight
Blood-red â holy fire
...to serve their God
