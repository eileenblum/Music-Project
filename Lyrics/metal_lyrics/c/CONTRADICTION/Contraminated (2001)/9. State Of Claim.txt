Paralyzing games
Multimedia control
Loss of capabilities
Develop mind and soul
A puppet on a string
Thinking's not allowed
More profit for the ghosts
Manipulating the crowd

Oh, how I hate
Hatred is deeper than oceans
It is enough to drive me mad
More and more temptations
Limited state of mind

Incompetent to live
Masses staying in ease
Artificial requirements
Emptiness will increase
Directed information
Forcing wishes to consume
True colored reality
The brain an empty room

I feel the storm blowing
Straight into my face
I will never howl with the wolves
Hope â I see just a trace
