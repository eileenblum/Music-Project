New Year celebration
Hope for alteration
Have another drink
Or pour it down the sink

So what is the matter?
Couldn't be better
Lives down the drain
The end of pain

Not a single deed
From the masters of words
Driven by greed
They are the curse

So what is the matter?
Couldn't be better
Lives down the drain
The end of pain
