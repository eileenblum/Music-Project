You â always want to share my troubles
Simulating sympathy
Why don't you care my privacy?
I beg you to keep out

Pretended sympathy
A disease
Your insincerity
Brings me on my knees

Confidence lost
Tell me who is the one
I can trust

It drives me insane
I cannot believe
The way you are treating me

Why do you try
To suck me dry from emotions?
I need to exist
Greed â like a leech absorbing the tears
That my soul sheds

Don't say a word stretching the truth
Unbidden affection
Conflict of emotions it seems out of place
To assure me your honesty
