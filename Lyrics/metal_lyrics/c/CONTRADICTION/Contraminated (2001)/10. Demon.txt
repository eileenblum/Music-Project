Eastern Europe after the change
Democracy is forcing its way
Forty years of the Iron Curtain
Revelation of what it repressed

Face the disease
Warfare and hate
Look into the mirror
Reflect your insanity

Terror is coming up
Total violence erupts
United Nations live in fear
Demon is back

Street fighting nationalists
Independence â the only interest
Violence without limitation
Desire for liberation

Face the disease
Warfare and hate
Look into the mirror
Reflect your insanity

Terror is coming up
Total violence erupts
United Nations live in fear
Demon is back
