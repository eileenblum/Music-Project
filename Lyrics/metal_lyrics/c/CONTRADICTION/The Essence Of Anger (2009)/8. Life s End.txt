One moment of fate
All help comes too late
The sickness raging
Subzero, down youâre forced

Life ends
No proof for grace
Leaving this place
Without a trace

In pain we drain
No light in sight
And where is heaven?
Where is this god?

In pain we drain
Ni light in sight
Promises broken
We simply rot

This is the final stand
Last fight without a chance
In darkness life will end
To twilight we descend

Some die in useless pain
In grief the soul will drain
Therapies overrated
End without dignity

Here comes the end
The final order
Getting over
This is the border
