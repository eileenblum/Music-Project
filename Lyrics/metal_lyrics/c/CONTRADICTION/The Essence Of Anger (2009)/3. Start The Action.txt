One day they should have realized
One day theyâll get the answer
One day it will come down on them
And one day their instance will end

And all is lost
A final crash
What greed will cost?
The global bash

Start the action
Come one letâs thrash around
Start the action
Letâs push them to the ground
Start the action
One needful final step
Start the action
And stop this mindless crap

Today theyâll get the final answer
Today they will pay the cost
Today all meanings will be changed
And today we finally react
