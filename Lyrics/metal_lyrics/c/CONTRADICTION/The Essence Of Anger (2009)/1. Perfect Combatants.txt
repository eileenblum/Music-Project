They are the constancy
The final evolution
This is the last conception
That God has done

Built for eternal combat
A war that still remains
The end of destination
When all is gone

Fight, kill, blood and gore
The quintessence of war is what theyâre living for

Pain, death, they donât mind
Pure bloodlust, raging blind
When factions will collide

The violent spawn
Still rages on
To kill the dawn
They fight a war

The iron creed will sow the seed
All that we bleed to fight a war

The violent legacy
Eternal loyalty
Surrounded be devotion
Theyâre marching on

One closing intervention
Unending desolation
Last act of wickedness
Before he is gone
