Iâve seen all details
I saw the past and I can see
All things that once will be

Dramas continue
Over the years
All the things over and done
All that lives that are gone

And so I carry on
Through the lines of time
And I will stay the same
A thousand years

Staying for infinity
Everlasting constancy
Voyager in time and space
Spectator of the human race

I am damned
I am the one who knows the riddle
All whatâs happened throughout time

Being here for all the moments
That have been during spring and fall
All the ages that I have seen
All the lives that will befall
