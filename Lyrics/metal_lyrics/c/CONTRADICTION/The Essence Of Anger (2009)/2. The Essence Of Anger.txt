[feat. Leif Jensen]When all attempts have failed
All prayers been unheard
We missed an immense chance

Predators have arrived
Unawareness has survived
Then comes the final dance

Clash and kill
Feel the thrill

War
We hear the war tunes humming
The age of war is coming

War
Prepared for the deranger
Here is the essence of anger

When all the brave are gone
Sardonic work is done
We have lost our beliefs

Perception`s going down
Malice obtains the crown
A hellhole we receive

Temples burnt to ashes

An age of ice
The highest price
Unending frost
Culture will be lost
