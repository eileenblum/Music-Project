The land of the poor is in need of cure
Itâs suffering again the eternal pain

Misery has got a name
Who is the one to be blamed?
Iâm talking about you
Now pay the dues

The forces unite
To lead off the fight
The fight you cannot win
Now atone for all the sins

Col-la-ter-al
Col-la-ter-al
Carnage

Collateral
Collateral
Collateral carnage
Collateral
Collateral
Collateral carnage
In the name of peace

The land of the poor is in need of cure
Your helping hands are deceitful plans

The forces unite
To bring back the light
They are striking back
With an angry attack

Invaders come in peace leaving bodies in pieces
And the peopleâs relief has turned into grief

The forces unite
To bring back the light
The enemy cannot prevail
Forever they have failed
