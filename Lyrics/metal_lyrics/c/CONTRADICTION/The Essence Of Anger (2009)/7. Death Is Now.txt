I guess youâve heard of me
I am the agony
Too late to roll the dice
Youâll never see me twice

Todayâs your final show
There is no more need to bow

Lifeâs an illusion
The final truth
One last confusion
Thatâs all you loose

Death is now

You walked on parole
But you have missed out
Pay the toll âcause itâs too late
On your knees and take your fate

May they bury you in hell
Moaning for mercy
May they bury you in hell
Boiling your flesh
Too late to roll the dice
Youâll never see me twice
Pay the toll âcause itâs too late
On your knees and take your fate
