[feat. Leif Jensen]Conditions made to tame
Just cattle we became
And we are going on and on
Donât stop until the business is done

And life is running low
Inner wheel is turning slow
Feeling unrest in the mind
No doubts, any motive we will find?

Duties made to let us bleed
Without clamour we proceed
No misgiving we rely
Never ask the reason why

Bite the apple, getting wise
Contradiction to realize
Is there something in the sky?
Donât know, but for me God is a lie

This world of disgrace
Youâre caught in the race
The face in the dust
But still in God you trust
In God you trust

Theyâre still on top and get it all
The craving bunch is standing tall
In all conscience they do act
Hands up, all the others will be sacked

Holy thoughts causes holy deeds?
Never hit that hand that feeds?
Deep inside a growing greed
They still harvest without seed

Old fashioned ways hard as concrete
No suspicion, they proceed
In their power they rely
No one asks the reasons why

Searching knowledge, getting wise
Opposition to realize
Is there someone in the sky?
Who knows? But for me God is a lie
