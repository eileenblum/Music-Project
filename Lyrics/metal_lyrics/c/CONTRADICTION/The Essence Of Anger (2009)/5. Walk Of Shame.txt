That greed for green has lead us to the crash
No fear, no clemency

Doubts, you donât know what happens?
Time will show the end of poverty?

We spit on you

Like dancing on the wire
Above the burning fire
No one takes the blame
You stroll the walk of shame

Jobless, homeless, future is lost
Doesnât matter what it cost
World wide ruin, lost economy

Youâll never bet it all
At long last you must fall
Arrested by your misery
