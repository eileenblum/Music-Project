Pride, vigour, confidence
Traditions, marching on
Steel weapons forged in fire
The iron force

Cold blood, the power source
Spells spoken, magic might
Break bones, call the hammer
Eternal light

Eternal light

And on we fight
The victory in sight
âTil we have won
What fathers have begun

And on we fight
Truth is by our side
And on we fight
To bring back the light

Truth, honour, loyalty
Inferno, burning on
Strong hearts, iron minds
The holy truth

Hot blood forced by fire
Enchanted by the dusk
Called curse, dark desire
The end of fate
