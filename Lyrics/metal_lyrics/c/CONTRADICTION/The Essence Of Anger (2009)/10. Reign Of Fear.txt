Weâve analyzed the universe
We thought weâve found a way
We gave it all to philosophy
Heading for a better day

We have seen it all
The wicked standing tall

Weâve seen children killing
Prophecies fulfilling
In the end we had to fall

Times of dread
World turns mad
Fall of justice
Trail of tears

Doom is calling
Eden falling
Global terror
Reign of fear

Fate fulfilling
Endless killing
Total panic
Reign of fear

Weâre paralyzed by uselessness
We walked the path of fault
Sacrificed to stupidity
Beaten by the last assault
