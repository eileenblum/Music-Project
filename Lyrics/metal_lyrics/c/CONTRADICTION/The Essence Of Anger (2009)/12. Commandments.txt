I am the last result
I am the final gift
I am the answer
I am the one

To seal your fate

And I came down
From hell to earth
And now Iâm here
To bring you tears

Iâm the reaction
To all the sins
And I will punish you
A thousand years

I am the savior
I am damnation
I am the sickness
I am the one

To end all life

I am the enemy
I am misfortune
I am the revolution
I am the one

To kill mankind
