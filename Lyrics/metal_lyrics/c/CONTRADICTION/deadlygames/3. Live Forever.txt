This is the story of a guy I knew, he was very close to me
He was chosen to live for eternity
He got only the chance, the decision was up to him
Now this guy is standing here to sing the story of his life

Now I know, I love you so
Now I see, I want to live forever
And now I know, I love my life
I understand, I'll never die

I choose the way to live forever, it stand great
But friends grew older, I stayed young. Was it fate?
Times went further, I stood still, is this god's or my will?
I realize, the decision was wrong, I'm the one to pay the bills

Now I know, I love you so
Now I see, I want to live forever
And now I know, I love my life
I understand, I'll never die

This was the story of a guy I knew, guy that was me
I had been chosen to live for eternity
I've got only the chance, the decision was up to me
Now I'm standing here, I've told you the story of my life

And now I know, I love you so
But I see, I don't want to live forever
Yes, it's true, I love my life
But I understand, I'll have to die
