You think you are out of danger
But don't you feel the death surrounding you?
I say you are endangered
They want to get you, too
They don't want to make you feel better
Because money is their only interest
Beware and get yourself in action
You have to oppose them now!

Their minds â full of crime â take care
Or you'll be the next in line
They are so cruel â no chance for you
If you play the deadly games

Causing damages in your brain
Drugs will drive you insane
Don't you realize the madness?
Don't you recognize you're running out of breath?
Your friends will keep away from you
Premeditation for the social way down
The rest of your life will be marked by
Unemployment, crime and prison

Their minds â full of crime â take care
Or you'll be the next in line
They are so cruel â no chance for you
If you play the deadly games

Don't play down this appeal to your reason
'Cause the temptation is given always
Even a friend of yours could be the one
Who persuades you to "just a try"
Only one step can be the end
Only one step into the abyss
Addiction holds away over your acting
Your mind resigns â game over!

Their minds â full of crime â take care
Or you'll be the next in line
They are so cruel â no chance for you
If you play the deadly games
