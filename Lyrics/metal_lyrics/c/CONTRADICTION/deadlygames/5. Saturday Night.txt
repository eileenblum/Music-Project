Saturday night, weekend, time for fun
Time for the real life
That makes worth living

Saturday night, hitchhike to the city
Looking form some pretty
In order to...

All-day-routine, don't worry any longer
Use the time to relax
And soon you'll feel fine

Meet your friends, enjoy this moment of joy
No reason to be annoyed
No place for frustration

Feel the power deep inside
Use the power for this night
Too many drinks attack your brain
Tomorrow you'll feel pain

Sunday morning, hangover ain't no fun
You'd like to take a gun
All the hell's about to come

Waking up, you think the end is near
Although you know it's wrong
You're longing for a beer
