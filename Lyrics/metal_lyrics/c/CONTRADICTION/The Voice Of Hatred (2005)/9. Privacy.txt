I see where you go
And I know what you know
I'm the voice inside your brain
To hide from me will be in vein

Because my eyes are everywhere
I am watching you do not dare
Don't disappoint me you can't hide
I'm walking by your side

This is the end of privacy

Time will fade away
I - but I will stay

I still know your way

'Cause I'm scanning everything
What you do I can see
Don't do it wrong do it how I say
I observe you anyway
