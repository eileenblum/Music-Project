last days of democracy
free world is falling down
in the name of security
vanishing human rights

a thousand reasons to live in fear 
lady liberty will disappear
in the name of loyalty 
humanity out of sight

distrust and despair 
united nations of fear
distrust and despair
freedom will disappear

united war machinery 
god may bless the brave
the spirit of economy 
justyfies battlecry

suspecting unknown enemies 
terrorizing innocents
conspiracy of madness
an end in disgrace
