there is a certainty 
you are different from me
but I care what you say 
even if I had a bad day

never left you alone 
never hung up the phone
never pushed you away 
never forced you to stay

fear - pain
tears - insane

can't believe what you say - arguments
'cause this is not my way - arguments 
we don't need to fight - arguments
we solve the problem right - arguments

hey, can you please get real 
and listen to the deal
what's the point of discussion
in case of aggression

another disagreement 
another heavy argument
is there anybody wrong 
it finally makes us strong

can't believe what you say - arguments
'cause this is not my way - arguments 
we don't need to fight - arguments
we solve the problem right - arguments

what's up to your mind 
better look up behind
here where we are 
and never push it too far

never left you alone 
never hung up the phone
never pushed you away 
never forced you to stay
