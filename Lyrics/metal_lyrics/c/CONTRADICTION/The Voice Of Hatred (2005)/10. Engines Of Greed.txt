world will change its face
the outcome of a race 
made of flesh and bone
rubber, steel and silicon

the end of all we'd known
consequences shown
sciences worst creation
decline - the destination?

no order they will miss 
absolutely emotionless
doing what the leaders told
eyes are looking cold

engines of greed
subhuman breed
godgiven fate
disintegrate
engines of greed [4x]

manmade technorganics
disposable bionics
way to devastation
optimized for occupation

will mankind survive 
the enemies of life
words between the lines
humanity declines
