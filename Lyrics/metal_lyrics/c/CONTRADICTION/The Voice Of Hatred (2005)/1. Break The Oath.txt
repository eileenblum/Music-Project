displeasure signs the seasons
incompetence the reason 
democracy has failed
justice has been nailed

words of worthlessness
mental emptiness
the cross a sign of lies
truth hidden in disguise

surface will be broken
too much words are spoken
an oath is broken  

violent storm - disorder
break down the border
we are nemesis

the end is near
shadows you fear
the oath is sworn
new age reborn

forced to stay in ease
multimedia disease
false publicity
governance minority

who's the hand that feeds
serving all your needs
ignorance will end in grief
the bill you will receive
