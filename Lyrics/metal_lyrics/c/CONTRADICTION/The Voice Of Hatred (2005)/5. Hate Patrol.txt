I set you free
And give you peace
Your fate will be
My act of hate

I set you free
And give you peace
Your fate will be
My act of hate

But I won't tell 
A piece of that
Instead I ring
The freedom bell

Why should I care
If no one dares
To stay in front
Of me - agony

I set you free
And give you peace
Your fate will be
My act of hate

I set you free
And give you peace
Your fate will be
My act of hate

ACT OF HATE
ACT OF HATE

They know me better
But no one ever says
That your freedom
Doesn't matter

I am the leader
Of greatest nation
My reign is
My own creation
