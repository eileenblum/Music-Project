When you think that you can reach the sky
comes the point where your friends are gonna die
thinking forward don't accept the latest stop
all the sudden there comes the deepest drop

struggling no more words to say
paralysed I can't forget that day
desperate nothing, more to give
in this state I don't want to live

I'm falling down - down
My fuse is blown - blown
I hit the ground - ground
I'm falling down - down
Down - I hit the ground

If you have the power to climb the tower
You can reach a point which is even lower
Don't think you could stride through every door
Before getting a price you will hit the floor

Innocent - I just want to stay
Want to practice  what I always pray
Thinking forward I decide to grow
In the end I am feeling low
