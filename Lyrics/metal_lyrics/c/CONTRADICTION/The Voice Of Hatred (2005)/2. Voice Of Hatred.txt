some things will never change
one day this world deranges
but they don't recognize
the risks - they just despise

live with no consequences
they don't see differences
everything seems to be fine
until the day they will decline

We'll fight them back
we tear them down
we are the voice of hatred

the time has come 
reconquering the crown
we are the voice of hatred 

personifying all their fears
we're gonna make them disappear
one day that is for sure
they are the sickness, we're the cure

the day they now what's going on
no time left to fight us back
the final day they realize
no time left and no regret
