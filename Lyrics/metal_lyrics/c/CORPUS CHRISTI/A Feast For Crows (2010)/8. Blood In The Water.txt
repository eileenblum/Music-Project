Take a look at yourself then tell me, is this going according to plan?
Chasing everything that never mattered, trying to catch the wind with your bare hands.
You bought a ticket on the wrong ship and it's all going down.
This ship is going down.
We're all gonna die.
Take a look around and tell me, can your money buy you all that you lack?
All alone and surrounded by strangers, you can't remember how to get back.
Is this life, everything you wanted?
Is it worth the price you pay?
You're treading on bloody water.
Is it worth the price you pay?
Take a look at where you are and tell me, is it everything you dreamed it'd be?
You're in a thousand miles of open water.
A thousand miles between you and me.
If I could reach you, you know I would.
I am right here waiting for you to make your move.
The blood is burning, the waters churning, it's time to sink or swim.
Here come the sharks...
