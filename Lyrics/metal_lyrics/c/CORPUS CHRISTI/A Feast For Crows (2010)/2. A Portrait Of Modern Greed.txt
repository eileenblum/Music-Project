This is all out war.
Born into this struggle.
We've become the things we hate.
No longer will we be the downtrodden - beggars at your gate.
To - all that we own we've been given - over as slaves we are the resistance.
What made you think that we would bend so easily?
(We're not like you)
We're not like you, my friend.
You're so weak.
(We're done with you)
Our entire lives we've been told we have to buy your lies.
But all that will gain us are things that we can't take with us when we die.
Your narrow perception, a weakened device.
Your veil of deception, now falls from our eyes.
What made you think that we would bend so easily?
(We're not like you)
We're not like you, my friend.
You're so weak.
What made you think that we would bend to suit your greed?
(We're done with you)
We are the â resistance.
What made you think that we would bend so easily?
(We're not like you)
We're not like you, my friend.
You're so weak.
What made you think that we'd ever be slaves to your greed?
(We're not like you)
You're so weak.
(We're done with you)
Your veil of deception, now falls from our eyes.
We'll never be your possession.
You'll never get out alive
