The latest sun is sinking, as I stand and watch it fade alone.
Now my breath turns to vapor, and I feel a chill in my bones.
Your words have not fallen on deaf ears.
Your presence relieves me of my fears
(I am the Light in the darkness [x2]
The city on the hill, I am the Lion of Judah.
I can never be killed.
I am the First and the Last.
No beginning and no end.
I am the Father and Son, I am the three who are one.
My eyes are open for the first time
As I taste you in the air.
I can see you for the first time.
For the first time.
Now I stand in the doorway.
And I know I must walk through it alone.
I can hear angels singing.
And that melody is carrying me home.
Your name is honey on my lips.
Your words are the water of life that I sip (I am the Morning Star)
I am the Cornerstone.
I am the Great Physician.
Separating marrow from bone.
I am the King of Glory.
Who was and is and is to come
(I am the way. The truth. The life. Almighty Holy One)
I can see you for the first time.
My eyes are open for the first time.
