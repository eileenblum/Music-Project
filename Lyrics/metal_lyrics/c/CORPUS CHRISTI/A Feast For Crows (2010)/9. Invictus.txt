Our wisdom is the raving of fools.
Our knowledge is partial and full of holes.
What can you offer me that I could never lose? This is my offering.
A sacrifice you must choose.
Die to yourself.
This sacrifice you must choose.
This sacrifice you must choose
This sacrifice you must choose.
I am called to stand and be counted among the victorious dead.
When self was laid aside, I became more than I had been.
And on the day I die, I rise to walk again.
I am called to stand and be counted among the victorious dead.
Crucified to the flesh I am bound in, I am the victorious dead.
Selflessness breeds fearlessness.
To face our lives, our death, or anything.
It's all the same.
I am called to stand and be counted among the victorious dead.
Crucified to the flesh I am bound in, I am the victorious dead.
