You hide behind the pretenses of the meek.
You've turned a nation of warriors into a herd of voiceless sheep.
Shepherds in sheep's clothing.
We should be more than conquerors, not a herd of frightened sheep.
I am disgusted by what I see we've become.
When greed outweighs the greater good, the end has just begun.
Righteous anger should consume us once again.
Every nation that has fallen, has fallen from within.
And when I look at where we started, then see where we are now, it makes me sick.
Righteous anger should consume us once again.
Every nation that has fallen, has fallen from within
