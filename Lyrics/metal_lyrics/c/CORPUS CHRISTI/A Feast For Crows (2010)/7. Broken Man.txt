I am a pariah
The product of all the bad choices I've made

Even one such as I,
Seeking redemption,
Burn in my pride

See me now
Desperate for change
I've seen the writing on the wall
First came my pride
Then came the fall
Then came the fall

Here I am
Can you mend this broken man?
Here I am
Can you make me whole again?

See me now
Desperate for change
My heart betrays my mind
My flesh betrays us all

My heart betrays my mind
My flesh betrays us all

Here I am
Can you mend this broken man?
Here I am
Can you make me whole again?

As I fall on my knees
With my face to the setting sun
Oh, God, have mercy on me

Here I am
Can you mend this broken man?
Here I am
Can you make me whole again?
