The silence echoes through the empty halls
No salutations... something was very wrong
She went searching for signs of life with hope... but nothing was found.

On the floor he lay
All the air when cold
The gravity of all her fears
Taking hold.

Now the bitter tears of despair streaming down her face
Silence shattered by the mourning cry
His soul taken away

She embraces reality with hope in spite of the pain

[Chorus:]
So in spite of all her fear she will never run away
This is her life

One last kiss goodbye
Tear drops on roses
Her held held up
While the pain imposes

[Chorus:]
So in spite of all her fears she will
Never run away
And as she soaks the ground with tears she says
"I will not run away. This is my life"

Black cars with flags... the cemetery quiet and still

No words of comfort can assuage the agony of loss
Above herself she reaches to find strength to carry on

As she turns to face her life alone bearing so much pain
She sees his eyes and finds her hope looking upon her daughters face

[Chorus]

The silence echoes through the empty halls...
