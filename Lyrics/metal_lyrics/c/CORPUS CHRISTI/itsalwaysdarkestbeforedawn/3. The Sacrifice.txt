How do you measure cost of that which can't be bought or sold.
The giving of which bears the price.
This is my sacrifice.
The price I'd pay for you alone.
Let not winters ragged hand decay the beauty of the heart.
Not even such a thing as death can keep our souls apart.
And i pledge my devotion to you.
In life or death my all for you.
This is my sacrifice.
Live and die for you without hesitation.
Live and die for you with no reservations.
This cost is nothing when weighed against the reward of a lifetime spent with you.
There's nothing i want more.
There's no price too high.
This is my sacrifice for you.
Test me.
See my proof.
Try me.
With fire and youth.
I may not have much i can offer.
But all i have is yours.
Every single breath of life i take for you.
Were it mine to give I'd give you the world.
And seal it with a kiss goodnight.
