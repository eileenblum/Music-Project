We've been transfixed before our encounter will ever take place.
We've heard the stories and the words that have entered our hearts forever.
And with every effort we make preparations and persue on with the passion and the love that you've shown us with no end.
The death of every passing day is only another step closer to uniting lovers separated by this wicked world and wicked men.
United souls screaming.
How long.
Over the sound of our hearts breaking.
How long.
Until the day we become one.
How long.
Until the day.
When it all comes together we'll know.
When it all comes together we will know our time was spent accordingly.
We've been forgiven.
Set free.
We'll know it's true love.
We'll know it's true.
