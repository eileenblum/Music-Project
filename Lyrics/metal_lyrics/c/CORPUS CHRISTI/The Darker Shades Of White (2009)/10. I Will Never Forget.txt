You cut the chord between us.
The knife is bloody in your hands.
The blame's on both our shoulders.

But you cut and ran.

You have forsaken everything we shared.
All the pain that you can't forget is all the same as all of my regrets.
I will never forget you.
The look on your face said a thousand words.

And when you walked away silence was all I heard.

The last day I saw, you never even said goodbye.
I will never forget your face.
So sorry I made you cry.
I will never forget your face.
