One day at a time now, to figure out my mind.
Rigorous mind games of American kind.
Get out, stand up, give us something to believe in.

Find me, pick me up now.
I know it's not another dead end ride.

I have seen and I have tasted all that you have shown.
I have followed, I have led and this is what I know.
You have nothing I need.
Can't you see that this is something to be taken serious?

You have set us up to fail.

Step out face what you know.
The door is wide open.
Unknown is the next day.
Give me passion.
I know that you don't see the same.
This is harder than it seems.
I know that you don't see the same as me but we do agree on this.

Instinct speaks loudest.
Guidance from the heart.
I have seen and I have tasted all that you have shown.
I have followed I have led and this is what I know.
You corrupt the innocent and smile, laughing as you go.

You have nothing I need.
Tear me down.
Build me up.
