How do you measure cost of that which can't be bought or sold?
The giving of which bears the price, this is my sacrifice.

The price I'll pay for you alone... sacrifice.
Let not winter's ragged hand decay the beauty of the heart.
Not even such a thing as death can keep our souls apart.
And I pledge my devotion to you.

In life or death, my all for you.

There's no price too high, this is my sacrifice.
Live and die for you, no hesitation.
Live and die for you, no reservation.
Were it mine to give, I'd give you the world and seal it with a kiss goodnight.

There's no price too high; this is my sacrifice for you.
