I walk the streets again tonight blinded by the actions of the fight.
The fire biting at my heels,

my God I've forgotten how it feels to live by grace, now in this fallen state.

Once there, this new life can't compare.
My God, where are we?
How can this be?
I've felt the flames and they were cold.

We've been apart so long.
We've been apart for so long.
I'm baptized in fire, sanctified by flames.

This heart of stone breathes new life and beats again.
I walked away from you tonight, denied the knowledge that you're real.

My God, I hate how this feels, the pain of this empty heart.
Please, breathe new life in me.

Consume... fire.
