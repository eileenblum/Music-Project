The silence echoes through the empty halls.
No salutations, something was very wrong.

She went searching for signs of life, but nothing was found.
As she turns to face her life she says, "I will not run away,"
and as she soaks the ground with tears she says, "I will not run away."

On the floor he lay.
All the air went cold, the gravity of all her fears taking hold.
The bitter tears of despair streaming down her face.
Shattered by the mourning cry, his soul taken away.
She embraces reality with hope in spite of the pain.
