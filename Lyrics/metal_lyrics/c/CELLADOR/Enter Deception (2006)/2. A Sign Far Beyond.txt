ThereÂ´s not a way around it
WeÂ´re no longer one ahead
As we fall into a world
Of endless doubt and constant worry

Losing all our senses
As the sky is turning grey
How can all these things we know
Be deemed alloweed and forced each everyday

Cannot we ever find what we see as the truth
When we leave all the dreams that we knew...

On and on, to the edge of the world
Lead on and see what our reason will do
On and on, not a sign far beyond
Will we be leaving the truth, long and gone, from all that we knew

But its not too late
To turn around and watch again
All the things that we had learned
And where weÂ´d gone with all our worry

Is there still a chance to make
Amends with our regret
And turn around towards our home
Where we belonged yet left in burning rage

On and on, to the edge of the world
Lead on and see what our reason will do
On and on, not a sign far beyond
Will we be leaving the truth, long and gone, from all that we knew

And in a sudden flash it came to me before my eyes
In a true revealing picture of the things that I despise
Now I see whatÂ´s happening
Is a self-deceiving luxury
IÂ´ll no longer run, IÂ´ll return to home and fly

On and on, to the edge of the world
Lead on and see what our reason will do
On and on, not a sign far beyond
Will we be leaving the truth, long and gone,
Gone and beyond
On and on, from all that we knew
