Hard I have fallen for a lost illusion
Running through my head
Coming to me in a waking dream
Was a sight I wonÂ´t forget

In the vision thereÂ´s an open sea
Where in isolation lies
A secret haven with shores of gold
And a sun that never dies

As I followed to its warmth and feeling
Losing touch with time
Embracing me in harmony
Was the palm of perfect man

To a city pure of heart and free
With a mind not torn from lie
Standing there in harmony
With an aura so divine

Following to my destiny
For its beauty soaring high
Brings forth a light I find
True glory in its shine

Across the hills to the gates of tomorrow
IÂ´ll sing the song that you sang forth to me, now I go
To travel life without fear and misfortune
And bring the light found with internal peace,
Now IÂ´ve gone forth and left, to live once again

My wakening of thought

Rushing me was a sense of urgency
For a question did arise
Before I wake itÂ´s the path of truth
That I have to realize

And the perfect man he spoke to me
"Look inside your heart and find,
Truth it dawns on the simple man
Let it be no compromise"

Following to my destiny
For its beauty soaring high
Brings forth a light I find
True glory in its shine

Across the hills to the gates of tomorrow
IÂ´ll sing the song that you sang forth to me, now I go
To travel life without fear and misfortune
And bring the light found with internal peace,
Now IÂ´ve gone forth and left, to live once again

My wakening of thought

Following to my destiny
For its beauty soaring high
Brings forth a light I find
True glory in its shine

Across the hills to the gates of tomorrow
IÂ´ll sing the song that you sang forth to me, now I go
To travel life without fear and misfortune
And bring the light found with internal peace,
Now IÂ´ve gone forth and left, to live once again

My wakening of thought
