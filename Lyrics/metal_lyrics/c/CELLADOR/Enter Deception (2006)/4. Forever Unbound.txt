Call me an unbeliever, maybe a skeptical
I just can't understand what seems to be above us all
Some people preach of glory, seeking a mystical
Why won't they realize the dream they seek controls them all?

Across each land and country, through nations big and small
A force invisible, created by its own people
They seek for good intentions, spreading what they think is right
But really all they ever do is bring a neverending fight

Why not make up our own minds?
We all have nothing to hide..

You have it all down inside
No one can tell you how to think
It's your heart and mind
You have control of your life
Riding on wings up to unbroken light

Waking up to a day of nothing, the mind is set to something told
Another dawn that has no worth, a hope adorned you can't behold
Working through each day for something that one day you think you'll earn
But why waste time for something then, when everything now's for what you yearn?

Life's too short to sit and cry
One day you live, another you die

You have it all down inside
No one can tell you how to think
It's your heart and mind
You have control of your life
Riding on wings up to unbroken light

You have it all down inside
No one can tell you how to think
It's your heart and mind
You have control of your life
Riding on wings up to unbroken light

You have it all down inside
And you have control of your life
No one can tell you
Just leave all your worries
And free your mind
Again..
