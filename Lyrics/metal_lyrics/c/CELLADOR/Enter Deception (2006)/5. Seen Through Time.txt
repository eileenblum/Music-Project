On the dark and blue horizon
Beyond the realms of land
About the edge of time
There showed a shape of wonder
With sheering course of might
And true revealing light

Feeling it's force drive me closer
I drew upon it's guide
Rising up and through the ruins of man
A vision so appeared before my eyes
With blinding light..

I never thought I'd find
True meaning to me inside
With all hopes I'd dreamt to see the end of life and time
Forever close your eyes
To seek the dream within the night
(Seeking the dream in the night)
Never looking back to see what's left behind

As if it were a nightmare
I woke from my old life
I opened up my mind
The mist of haze and darkness
Covering all our eyes
Was lifted off of mine

The chaos and panic and terror
Of a world that lives in fear
Wasting away thinking purpose was planned
Eternally forgotten souls of time
To life they bind

I never thought I'd find
True meaning to me inside
With all hopes I'd dreamt to see the end of life and time
Forever close your eyes
To seek the dream within the night
(Seeking the dream in the night)
Never looking back to see what's left behind

I never thought I'd find
True meaning to me inside
With all hopes I'd dreamt to see the end of life and time
Forever close your eyes
To seek the dream within the night
(Seeking the dream in the night)
Never looking back to see what's left behind
