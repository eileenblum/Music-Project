Into the darkness with sickness we fall
On mental quest fought for one and for all
To seek deceiver, release of the lie
Dissolve the spread now, for real truth we find

The man in black at the end of the sky
Spreads fear of death now how to live your life
In deep construction we fear to survive
Under the sheet now the weak become blind

Calling forth to a world unhalloweed
To break free the chains
And the face of an earth tomorrow
Leading from today
Clearing storm I absorb the thunder
To seek out the rain
Inner source of endless might to drive away
From the seed of your lie

Flying high over seas of eternity
Through the gate never fear whatÂ´s behind the shadows
Free your mind from the things being shown
See the light you have always known
Deep in your heart from within

Fabled life, crumbling to the ground
Chasing hard the memory of a need beyond whatÂ´s found
Not a dream but insanity that steals away our destiny
When deceived we arenÂ´t whatÂ´s meant to be
We believe the false around

Try to see whatÂ´s beneath the hollow
Stray from their game
Underneath breaths a force to follow
Feeding your shame

Do you feel whatÂ´s beyond the shallow
Tales that they say
Opening of a light towards a brither day
To be free for all time

Flying high over seas of eternity
Through the gate never fear whatÂ´s behind the shadows
Free your mind from the things being shown
See the light you have always known
Deep in your heart from within

Flying high over seas of eternity
Through the gate never fear whatÂ´s behind the shadows
Free your mind from the things being shown
See the light you have always known
Deep in your heart from within
