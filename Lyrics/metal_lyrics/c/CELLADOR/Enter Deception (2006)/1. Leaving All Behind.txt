Lost all alone and bound for nowhere
With no thought nor aim to find
Your choices made, decisions hollow
And forced into your mind

In darkness you wander
Abound in an empty endless night
Forever searching for the light

Controlling your mind
(All thoughts and all dreams turning to illusion)
Leaving all behind

Upon your face stares the watcher
Following words of lie
He guides your steps walks you to sorrow
Misguiding your life

The hand of the master
The palm of the maker shields your eyes
Break from the feeder or go blind

Controlling your mind
(All thoughts and all dreams turning to illusion)
Leaving all behind

One day you will realize
In time you will blink and see the light
And from out of grace your soul will shine

Controlling your mind
(All thoughts and all dreams turning to illusion)
Leaving all behind

Controlling your mind
(All thoughts and all dreams turning to illusion)
Leaving all behind

Just wake up and open your eyes
