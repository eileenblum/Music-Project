[Music / Lyrics: C.Petersen]

Iâm an outside traveler
Who roams this empty city
Surrounded by no source of life
Though people still remain

As empty shells of lost ambition
And friends of former days
Devolved into same-habit creatures
Dwelling in their caves

Though none is left my head is high
Iâll take another breath and reach for the sky

[CHORUS]

Iâm the Omega, the last left alive
Freedom and spirit in me shall thrive
With self inspiration, and will to be true
This existential life shall prevail on

Domestication overdrive
Societyâs old mission
Fulfilled their instincts, bred their line
Gave them to submission

Now socially re-digitized
In networks they can wallow
And feel themselves identified
âCause really they are hollowed

But still I see the spark inside
If theyâd ignite that flame, theyâd release their mind

[CHORUS]

Iâm the Omega, the last left alive
Freedom and spirit in me shall thrive
With self inspiration, and will to be true
This existential life shall prevail on

[INTERLUDE]

Free your mind, and wake from this struggle.
Thereâs life I still see it from inside

And though none is left my head is high,
Forever proud that I have escaped the hive

[CHORUS]

Iâm the Omega, the last left alive
Freedom and spirit in me shall thrive
With self inspiration, and will to be true
This existential life shall prevail on
