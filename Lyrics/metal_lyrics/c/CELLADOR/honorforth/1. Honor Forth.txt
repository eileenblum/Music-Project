[Music / Lyrics: C.Petersen]

We travel on to the land of the dead
Smiling at the dangers and perils ahead
Cares tossed away
Like the dust in the wind

Weâll vanquish horror and evil repel
Days start to fade on this descent to hell
Are you afraid of the darkness that creeps in?

Onward to our fortuneâs glory, carry on
For one and for all
To all who shall live, this purpose we give

[CHORUS]

Oh heralding glorious days
Where courage shines with wisdom on this fight we shall praise
When darkness falls, the light of our ways
Heeds forth our freedomâs call

Weâve reached the tower still guarded with fear
Shining with vengeance, our reward is near
Strike down the beast and reap what there lays

This realm is sacred, its goodness I feel
Fateâs in our grasp as we shatter the seal
Promise in blood, until the last foeâs defeated

Invoking illumination, shining on
To light where thereâs none,
And restore the sun

[CHORUS]

Oh heralding glorious days
Where courage shines with wisdom on this fight we shall praise
When darkness falls, the light of our ways
Heeds forth our freedomâs call

[INTERLUDE]

An end to this chapter is written
With honor forth
But though victory is won, our quest is far from done
Onward to our fortuneâs glory, carry on
For one and for all

To all who shall live
This purpose we give

[CHORUS]

Oh heralding glorious days
Where courage shines with wisdom on this fight we shall praise
When darkness falls, the light of our ways
Heeds forth our freedomâs call

When darkness falls all away
Freedom calls us home
