[Music / Lyrics: C.Petersen]

A flash of our destruction
Into conformity
So many hopeless lives
Fulfulling false legacies

Wisdom of ages crumbling
Corrupted minds still grow
Now people woe and cry
With no rights to show

Their beta lives will hear the alpha call
Self actualization waits for them all

Never surrender
Unchained til the end
Mental ascension aligned with the self
From this day, weâll take our own way
Where freedom and might shall befall the heart of us all

Awake the grip of fury
Within the fireâs glow
Embrace the warmth inside
And strength here will flow

Escape the social cycle
Defy the status quo
And single-mind free-thinking zeta will show

End the dependencies of mind and love
Roll like the thunder rising above

Never surrender
Unchained til the end
Mental ascension aligned with the self
From this day, weâll take our own way
Where freedom and might shall befall the heart of us all

[INTERLUDE]

Found restoration
Strong like before
Inner sustation will live ever more
Transfiguration
Straight to the core
Singular spirit reforms

A new beginning for a mind reborn
Unlock the shackles
Ride with the storm

Never surrender
Unchained til the end
Mental ascension aligned with the self
From this day, weâll take our own way
Freedom and might shall reside in the heart of us all

Never surrender
Unchained til the end
Mental ascension aligned with the self
From this day, weâll take our own way
Freedom and might shall befall the heart of us all, again
