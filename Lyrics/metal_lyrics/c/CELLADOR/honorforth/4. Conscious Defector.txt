[Music / Lyrics: C.Petersen]

Dark are the visions that plague me in the night
Bleak apparitions still filling me with fright
Harsh revelations with a purpose never told, is this my future?

Sign of damnation to the person I behold
Weak and disfigured is his spirit of the old
A haunting reflection of what I should become, if I surrender..

If I just stay strong, the vision will fall
Break every social bond, for once and for all

Never satisfy!

Destiny to defy
While the flame in me will never die
So the sign of life in me lives on
I have seen its light all along
in every thought its guide always kept the dream alive

Voices like howling they whisper to the mind
In sick desperation, mere buzzing from the hive
Focused temptation still calling from inside, searing tradition

Never have I listened, their forces in decline,
Failed in their mission of claiming what is mine
All of us face it but few shall defineâ¦ the conscious defection

Out of the dusk and into the dawn
Awakened in honesty to lead ever on

Never satisfy!

Destiny to defy
While the flame in me will never die
So the sign of life in me lives on
I had seen its light all along
in every though its guide
always kept the dream alive

[INTERLUDE]

Destiny to defy
While the flame in me will never die
Now from the abyss Iâve withdrawn, and my demons begone, forever light shining on

Destiny to defy
While the flame in me will never die
So the sign of life in me lives on
I had seen its light all along
in every thought its guide
always kept it, now protected, always kept the dream alive
