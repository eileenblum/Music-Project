Pretty fingers get cold
I'm letting them go
Tried to discern what feral dogs disclose
To an unfettered night
Claimed we're killing them slow and taking control
The girl from the painting that we stole stands outside
Watching cars come and go

Tracks filling with snow
Followed them home
Wanted to see her for myself this time
Where it's too bright to hide
Us and Kellie Marie trying to sleep
Worried about you worrying about me
Thus is the power of the leaf

Found my faith fast returning
The bush is burning through the dawn
Never consumed or the least discouraged
It takes courage falling so far
Longed for nights well spent foraging
Living off the land of a midnight sun
There down in the fields you'll find me toiling
I know my work is never done
