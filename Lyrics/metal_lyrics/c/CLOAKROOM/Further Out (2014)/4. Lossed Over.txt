Steady in your pace my friend
Troubles abound
The pale moon boils the blood of men
So calm down
Far too much faith given into the curse
It's like we kept it hanging around

Giving up the chase my friend
Of days you knew when
Why spend the better parts of your life
To find them
Far too much faith given into the cure
Almost like we think we'll live again

More than once in a while in return you must force a smile
And it's easy for me
For some centuries now it's been known that the world is round
Ain't it hard to believe
Inland beyond the North sages spoke of a sarsen door
At the mouth of the sea
For some centuries now it's agreed Earth is hollow throughout
And we're forging a key
