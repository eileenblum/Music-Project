Took a long drive
Got a few dents
Told a couple jokes at your expense
Showed yourself out
Found your way back
Thought you'd never leave the cul-de-sac
The longer you stay the more that you see
It's not a world of possibility
Even I from time to time
Will believe anything

Spent a few weeks
In a cold bed
Had a lot of plans to circumvent
In your fair skin
Spared no expense
Never felt the sting of consequence
In the right mood for the right plea
Cell phones killing every worker bee
What has been destroying me
What has been destroying me
Such a subtle frequency

You were not the least concerned with Eternal Return
But you'd never want the cycle to stop
May the cycle never stop
May the cycle never stop
