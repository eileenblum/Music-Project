[Because, just like our forefathers, we love to get drunk...]

Always willing 'til the morning
Keeping drinking, don't need money
Right here friend you must stand
And close this bar drinking 'til the end!

Don't give up, forever think
Every place is good to drink
If you wanna have some fun
Drink with your gang...

For my mouth is not enough
When I get back into booze
Drinking hard to cheer me up
But I don't care 'cause it's what I am!

[Bridge:]
I see you twice, my tongue is out
Singing songs out loud
Giving all and lots of laughs
Although I get drunk!

[Chorus:]
When the night falls we drink with our folks
And we sing, we fight, we lose control
Down on the floor, we don't wanna go home
When you've drunk it all, we always need some more!

One more beer is what I need
Maybe two can quench my thirst
Drinking wine, gin, run or mead
All drinks are fine...

Your cheeks are red just like wine
Don't be careful, all is right
Take a good drink and feel its might
Rest your mind and enjoy this night!
