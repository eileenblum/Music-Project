[During a meeting at which the Lusitanian people were to give up their weapons to Rome and thereby to sign a peace treaty, they were betrayed, killed and sold as slaves. This vile act against these people would not go unpunished, and there was an uprising against Rome, headed by a courageous Lusitanian shepherd called Viriathus.]

Bloody dawn of that day
We don't know the price we pay
Now peace turns into rage
When their deal is so unfair

A dirty game is all they play
All they said now is worthless
Disarm the weak, chase the faint
Break our pride and kill the rest

[Bridge:]
Why came you here? Shake my hand and betray me
With void and worthless words. You swine and deceiver
Why did I trust you? You sell peace after killing
It's a double-cross trick to avenge and take our goodwill

Their steel against bare hands
Fighting hard with tooth and nail
Dead brothers lying in our arms
Choosing death before being slaves

Nevermore hear the children's cry
Never again see the fathers die
Nevertheless a few can't be chase
And beating hard, let's the riot start

[Chorus:]
And now the blood of a guiltless town on the ground,
We are alone,
Elders, mothers, brothers and sons, all forsaken by the gods,
Blood of a guiltless town
Stained lands with the heroes' marks who tried to endure and stand up,
Mourning and in pain
Like slaves, chased and sold, we'll survive to take revenge,
Blood of a guiltless town
