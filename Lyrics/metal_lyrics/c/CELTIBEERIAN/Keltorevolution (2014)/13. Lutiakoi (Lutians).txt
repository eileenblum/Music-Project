[During the Celtiberian Wars, four hundred Lutian warriors went out to help their Numantians brothers. These warriors were betrayed by their own elders who tipped off the Roman army. As a result, each young Lutian lost the hand that wields the sword.]

Late at night, when our brothers arrived
Asking help, coming from Numantia
Runaways, escaped from the Roman's gaze
Let them go inside to talk with elders

No, we're not gonna take part here
Nevermore, was the elders' reply
Afraid of the wrath of the enemy
Know that if we lose, they'll raze all of us

Don't care! We will do as our heart says
Cowards! You refuse to give them help
We, the young, we'll stick with them
This is no time for words but facts!

[Bridge:]
They walk straight into the ambush
Betrayed by their own
The heroes gone

[Chorus:]
Now, to katum eimos lutiakoi,
To relieve our brothers
Now, to katum eimos lutiakoi,
Duty of our blood tie

Now, to katum eimos lutiakoi,
Go against the elders
Now, to katum eimos lutiakoi,
To fight 'till we die

Four hundred marching men of Lutia
Go to war, across snow and ice
Dark fog as their only shield
Caught in the act by the Roman squad

A trap, surrounded and captured
They cut off our right hands
Like rats, they afraid of us
So we can't come back to lift a sword

[Speech:]
Brothers! We are the town of Lutia,
And we carry the torch of brotherhood
Against what the elders said,
We will help to our brothers of Numantia
We may be only a few warriors, but with our
Courage we will defeat the Roman invaders
