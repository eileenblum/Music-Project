[feat. Jonne JÃ¤rvelÃ¤ &amp; Tuomas Rounakari (Korpiklaani)][About our love for this way of live, a simple life that involves working hard, making music, enjoying the food, and drinking to the last drop with folks.]

[Yoik]

Sitting in an olive-tree's shadow
Getting up with the morning breeze
All I see is that green meadow
Work all day among cows and sheep

Working hard 'til the sun goes down
In this land where I learnt this craft
With my bare hands I work on my own
It's only me with my dog and beer

[Chorus:]
This simple life is what I want to live
Working all day and drinking all night
We don't need more! Just to feel so fine
Keeping this line, you will do it right!

Coming back from a hard day out
I need a drink much more that a rest
With my friends I head to a tavern
To drink it all when the wenches call

[Dialogue:]
Gus: Hey! What's going on? Jonne.
Jonne: I'm fine brother.
Gus: You wanna have some fun?
Jonne: Fuck yeah!
Gus: So, let's go and get drunk!
Jonne: Sounds like a good plan, let's do it, alright!

Keeping this line, you will do it right!

Hey!
