[In ancient times, as at present, the Celtiberian dwellers oppressed by their tyrannical rulers who were trying to deprive them of their freedom, harassing them and forcing them to live under the yoke. Now it is time to join together, to become strong and to destroy them. Now, it is time for revolution.]

Here we are, one more time
All together still alive

The blaze on swords, the taste of blood
To win this war, we were waiting for

Our people are brave, and fight face to face
Showing our bare chest, no time to rest

We have the power, now start to pray
The sound of our name will make you feel pain!

We the people, ready to fight
We were born free and free is our life

Under the yoke never again
You could kill us but it's not the end

We'll rise up to chase you again
And fighting hard, we'll break the chains

Blessed by our gods, hidden in woods
When the Carnyx calls, there's nothing to lose!

[Chorus:]
Fighting in brotherhood
When freedom is the highest good
Shackles will turn to dust
Hold the line and strike with us

We never believed in a lying speech
You better go out and run away from here

Since our outbreak we fight with pride
This is our land, there's no place to hide

Seeing your face, the fuel for our rage,
We will nor rest 'til we see you in the grave

Won't tear us apart, your stupid game
When this old take, it's always the same!

[Recitation:]
We just wanted to live in peace,
But they came to enforce their will.
We refuse their deals, keltorevolution is here
They're craving our land but now it's time to draw the line...
