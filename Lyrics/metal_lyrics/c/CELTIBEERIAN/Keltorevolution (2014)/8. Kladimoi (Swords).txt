[The mighty "falcatas" were the swords that the Iberians and Celtiberians wielded when the Roman Republic came to conquer the land. The Romans found that this young steel had an amazing cutting power and had to learn different crafting techniques for them. The Celtiberians defended their homes with rage and harshness, doing battle when the Empire was on their doorstep.]

I will tall you about our steel
Crafted i our fields
Chopping wooden shields

Falling hard from above the arm
Tasting blood of man
Sparkling with the sun

[Bridge:]
One sight
One strike
Our rage won't die
Hostiles
Beware
Or Carnyx cry

[Chorus:]
With falcatas in hand
'tis the duty of a man
To defend his own land
Against the threat
Of the empire

Broad swords blessed by the gods
When the battle calls
Feeling no remorse

Breaking through the enemy's line 
Defending our home 
Fighting for our pride

Ansro adilos
Ansrom teirom
Adunei kom
Kladimubis
Ansra toutas,
Katomes riti
Eksgeninus
Orum reigdoum
[Our duty is 
To protect
Our land by 
The sword
Our people,
Let's fight against
The foreigners
From the eagles' realm]
