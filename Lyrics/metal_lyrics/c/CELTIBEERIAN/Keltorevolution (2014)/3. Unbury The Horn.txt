[The Roman Republic first arrived to Hispania to fight in the Punic Wars against the Carthaginians, leaving the peoples who dwelt in the peninsula in peace. Only after those wars did the Republic think about the strategic advantage of controlling the peninsula, and started its invasion in which the Celtiberian Wars are framed...]

This is my land,
I was born a free man
And here is where i stand

You're now waging war, 
And you'll get what you sow
From seeds of greed and gore

We could have lived in peace,
But you've chosen siege,
And for that you shall bleed

Our lives you might take,
But we'll answer with rage,
With the fury of the Celts

[Bridge:]
Carved on bronze plaques
Our names will prevail
Gods from days of yore, 
Prepare us for war!

[Chorus:]
Tonight I'll take the fight
To defend my land with pride
By taking this side, by right
You make me unbury the horn
To defend my home

We'll strike like a gale
On plain or on dale
Forging an epic tale

Bronze and iron we wield,
Sword, pike and shield,
To meet you on the battlefield
