[The Celtiberians had an ancient tradition of drinking Caelia (their beloved beverage), in order to be prepared and recharged before fighting in every battle.]

Brewed deep in hell, the wise men said
Caelia is the warrior's health
It's so easy to prepare
Drinking it gives you a beard

So take a pot, and fill with wheat
And wait 'til the water boils
Open your throat and drink a toast
It's more that a ritual

Approaching the wall, they call us to war
Ready to raze our land
They are looking for a fight,
And we are ready to strike

So take your jar and drink it all
To feed and heal your angry blood
You are strong, your mind explodes,
Together we go to war

[Bridge:]
Learnt and given by our ancient gods
Since the past, Caelia stayed with us

Now we drink like our ancestors
So we are strong!

[Chorus:]
Come with us to win another battle
Before fight we drink as brothers
Come with us to win another battle
Raise your swords and get ready to strike

Come with us to win another battle
See the vultures flying around you
If you win, if you lose, they'll eat, that's for sure
So take care and win to fight against

Bloodstained corpses, the clash of swords
Beating with no remorse
Caelia's running through your veins
If you're hurt, you feel no pain

Rip his head off and show your wrath
Defeating them one by one
Someone falls, you'd better run
Another one bites the dust
