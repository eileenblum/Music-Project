[Ode to Celtiberia, our land. Sometimes threatened, sometimes great, forever strong. We don't care where we go, Celtiberia will be always in our hearts.]

There's a land
Where we are from
Where I grew up
And I'm never alone

Cold winter sun
Brightening our land
Fresh summer nights
With stars shining high

[Chorus:]
Fields of Celtiberia
My home, a place to shelter
The fields of Celtiberia
Where my heart grows

Fields of Celtiberia
Your might will live forever
The fields of Celtiberia
Take me back home

Rivers and hills
Shaping the fields
Where our folk live
Strong through the years

Wolves running free,
Howl-carrying breeze,
And among trees
Hidden is the lynx
