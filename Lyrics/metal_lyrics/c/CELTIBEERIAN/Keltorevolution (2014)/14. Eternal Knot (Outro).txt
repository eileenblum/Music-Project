Memories of ancient knowledge,
Ancient empires, visions of new ages
The past, the present, the future.
We all wander through time.
Our ancestors, our descendants...

We are all the same in the beginning,
We are all the same at the end

And, alas, we have battled and killed our kind
Yet are the true wars fought with the flesh?

Old rituals surviving in the new
New rituals pretending to be old

History is an eternal knot,
Never started and never ended
Essence of this world,
In our nature, in us all...
