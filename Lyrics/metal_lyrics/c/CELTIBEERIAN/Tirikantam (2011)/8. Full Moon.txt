In a forest to the north
in a vast land without lord,
there's a group of warriors
that marches for others to war.

Night falls and they set camp
in a clear where they can stand.
They're here for lord's demand,
just for greed upon these lands.

There's a man that stands aside
beyond the camp and the fire light
The captain walks to his side
and asks him if he's feeling fine.

"No, my captain, all is wrong
as I'm thinking of my love:
the day I marched to war
was the day of our sacred bond"

[chorus]
Under this full moon you must to leave this war
and meet your wife.
Take your horse and saddle it to ride so far
and go to live your life.

In the forest, the moonlight
reminds my marrying day
and I cry for I can't stay this night
close to my wife.

But the war is something bad
and we can win with one less man.
Take your horse and saddle it
to ride so far and go to live your life.
