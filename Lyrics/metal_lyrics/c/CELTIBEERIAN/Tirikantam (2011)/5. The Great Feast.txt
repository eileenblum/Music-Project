Hey! Hey! Hey!

The feast needs our biggest table,
all the drink that we are able,
lots of people, lads to hire,
and hunted meat by the bonfire.

[chorus]
Wanna drink beer?
Wanna eat meat?
What a great feast!
Wanna drink some wine?
That will sure be fine!
Let's keep on this line!

Strong men carry heavy wood,
and pretty women cook the food.
All children playing together,
the long war's gone forever!

Bellies full of hunted meat,
and rising pints all full of beer.
The table plenty of wine and ale,
let's drink till we feel like we sail!

Now everybody is getting drunk,
with shining eyes and smiling mouths.
People lie down under the trees,
they don't care, 'tis the great feast!
