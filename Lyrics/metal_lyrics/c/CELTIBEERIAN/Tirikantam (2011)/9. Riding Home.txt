Dawn is breaking,
I'm riding home.
My good captain released me from war.
Soon enough
I'll meet my wife,
but this old forest I need to pass by.

In this clearing
Behind the trees
There's a gathering of goblins with beers
âFor seven years
Stay with us
Or youâll die if you try to escape fastâ

[chorus]
Deep inside this forest
all goblins gather
in a big party
dancing. But you can't
chase me, damn dwarves,
I know your desires:
you wanna cheat me,
Iâm out of here.

[post-chorus]
Why me?
Stay still! [x4]
Why me?

My wife awaits
I must go home
Is a good girl, I can't leave her alone
If I drink all
Youâll set me free,
for I can drink more than you in seven years!
