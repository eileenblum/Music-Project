At the heart of Celtiberia
you can taste our finest grapes.
The best wine of all the area
and not worse are our ales!

Hear us now, while we sing
and we fill our wineskins.
We are all just human beings
and sometimes we need to drink.

Now are coming summer times,
all fruits grow and grass is high.
The sun above the field shines,
we must thank Her for her light.

In the summer will work hard
on our fine and vast vineyards
the vintager under the sun
once the harvest has begun.

[chorus]
Gods of ages, keep our health,
one thing we want to beg:
give us your blessing with this praise
and let's drink to celebrate!

Creels of grapes from the harvest past
the vintagers will step on and smash
let the jouice of the fruits pass
through your feet while you step on fast.

Take a pint and taste this wine,
take some more and drive you wild.
Careful not to get too ill
or you'll fall to the green field!
