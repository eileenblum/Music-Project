The body of pain lives within us all
Organs forming the cancer of the soul

A cry fills the air again
Black fog from the mouths of cursed men
From Hearts of lies and malignity
A pestilence revived and renewed in fading light

How did it come to this?
False enlightened evangelists merely talking shit
Shoved down our throats
I'm sick of this
Break away from the change
And clench your fists
Ignite your rage

Let's scale the walls that deceive us
Look over the waters to the evergreen plane
It's time we face the night
Turn away from the light
Turn away from here

The colour of this life
Withers beneath a sense to survive
We all forfeit peace for greed

I had a vision of a burning land
Death filled the soil beneath
Where there was oceans now was burning sand
And towering flames had devoured the trees

My mind went into the mire
To resurrect a forgotten dream
And when my heart had nothing to cling to,
I clinged to myself with a hope that screams

I've waited for so long violence cascading and collecting in the core
In time we'll come to understand
And leave this land on the wings of human survival

Violence cascading
Collecting in the core
