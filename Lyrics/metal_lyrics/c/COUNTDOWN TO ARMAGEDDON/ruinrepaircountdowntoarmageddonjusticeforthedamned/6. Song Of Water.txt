Here we are, Idle on the verge of a colossal fuck up.
This hell we've created can it be undone?
I believe the earth can sense our lack of heart.
Abuse of the gift our mother gave us.

For now I will revel in my innocence
Through me love will do what love does best
Sister, brother I ask of you but one request
Do what brings you happiness and nothing less

Intuition calling forth a new leaf
Carving snow and keeping up with the breeze.
An inner-vision formed within a dream.
Present with her in synchronicity.
Upon the slope of frozen misery,
Echoed out the divine, in an angelic scream
With the golden tongue of empathy
"I know that she's the One in me."

For now I will revel in my innocence
Through me love will do what love does best
My sister my brother
Do what brings you happiness and nothing less
When I think about consciousness and what i've seen
The expression of positive and negative relativity.
The yin and yang of what the world will be and always has been
We must live present in joy and pain. Embrace universal harmony.

For an eon we've waited for our suffering to evanesce.
Innate, yet sleeping is the white tiger of the ancient days.
We're living seperated from what nature intended.
They've diluted her essence of pure perfection.
