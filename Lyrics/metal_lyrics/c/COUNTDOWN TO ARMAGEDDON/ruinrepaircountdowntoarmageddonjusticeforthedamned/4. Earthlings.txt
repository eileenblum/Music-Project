[feat. Karl Schubach (Misery Signals)]Sexism, Racism, Speciesism made me lose direction in a sea of western misconceptions.
And in return it twisted my perception.
Force fed segregation changed my vibration to the verge of self-immolation
Our dominion over Gaia will bring annihilation

Now times grown on me, I put forth three questions
Why do we weigh up what we show compassion?
How are we so blind to globalisation?
Will we ever form a unionised revolution?

My passion is to show the light and dark of the planet that we inhabit
We're the protons, electrons and neutrons of elemental fabric
The mass asteroid where we reside is a vast ion in the cosmic tides.
I know we can lose our view just keep in mind the divine is on our side.

For the sake of all we ride with heart on sleeve toward this summit of truth and solidarity.
In mind waters through pain ego eludes.
Love is a wind upon this water.
Make waves in you.

Prioritised money and economy over basic food, water and air quality
Concrete communities advocate environmental deforesting
We murder animals in excess, for an agriculture that will disrupt our ecosystem.
Acidic and carcinogenic standard of modern health

Why rationalise this capitalistic society?
I'm sick of this cataclysmic society.
The suffering we are living in.

Sexism, Racism, Speciesism made me find direction in a sea of western misconceptions.
And in return it opened my perception.
Force fed segregation birthed new intentions to free us from aged condition
Our dominion over Gaia will bring annihilation
