Picking up the pieces of a shattered dream
Ain't as easy as it seems
But how much longer can I spend on my knees
Open your eyes to the world of the living
Close the curtain on the world of the dead
Rise above fear and regret

I know I'm not perfect nor do I try to be
But something things at work within us
My angel let's take this back to the start
Cause even though we're apart
Something still stirs in our hearts for today

Live with hope glistening
Learn the vibrant beat in this song
I love to sing to this broken choir
Finally seeing more than plain black and white
If I touch the stars in my sleep at night
Night after night
I'll dedicate my life to making it happen
And when I struggle with myself day after day
I'll clench my fist for what will greet me next

Now it's time that I forget. I'm no longer scared of death
Live. Learn. Love.
