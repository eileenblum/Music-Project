I cannot withstand
This wretched vulgar place
A monument to my distaste
Compressing my lungs cursed by dysania
Tones of torment I now create
Barricaded by boundless hurt
Fragments of me bound &amp; burnt
Cynical plans flooding my thoughts
Images of this place buried in the dirt

You know we've been here far
Too long to say goodbye
I swear I heard your spirit sigh
Counting the times we wish we never had
I'm taking my life back

This very air is thin and wreaks of fury
With the surmise of my theory
Adrift in blackness home to obscurity
But liberated for eternal discovery
So in the end we'll take our memories
Throw them into the wind
Forget life's cold and heartless melodies
Smile for the last time
With this in mind and close our eyes
