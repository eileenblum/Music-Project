Another day slips by unnoticed when time means everything
We watch it all waste away again fading, fading into nothing
Suddenly I felt a fire like the surface of a sun
Another day brings forth the hatred, burnt in a battered mind
Thought I could push through this hopelessness
Breaking into pieces
Wake up to the fool that I've become
The suffocating weight of age, tearing limb from lifeless frames.
My fragile human cage

I can't seem to find myself,
I'm lost chasing something

Conviction choking me,
Compelling me to change I can't seem to find myself,
I'm lost chasing something
I can't seem to find myself;
I'm lost in a dream
Another day just out of reach
Thought time meant everything
To have seen what I've seen
Is to fathom the end of all things I wish I could believe in me again.
