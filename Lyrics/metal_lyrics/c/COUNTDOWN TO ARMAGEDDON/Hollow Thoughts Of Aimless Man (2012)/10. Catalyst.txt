Your agony is bliss to me with every failure I breathe new life
I'll live to see your dying day, feel the guilt the misery
You are repulsive, your deeds are sickening
To me your name is so fucking repulsive

Lost and astray a mirage of deceit,
Pacing tormented roads of memories

Your words are venom in my veins
But they're worth nothing more than clay
I will deconstruct the foundations of what you meant to me
Soon you will burn in treachery no one will hear your empty cries
Your lungs will bleed out, you will slowly die
I'll watch the light fade from your fucking eyes
I am numb with bitter hate when I see clouded eyes on my angels face
Ripped wings from her back lies and deceit plaguing her dim lit past
Even if it leads me to hell, I swear I'll drag you down with me
Down with me.
