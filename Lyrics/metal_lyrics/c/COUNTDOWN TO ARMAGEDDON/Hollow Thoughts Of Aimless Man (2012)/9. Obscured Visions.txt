Wandering through timeless delusion
As bones pave my way through the filth
Where once stood kindred souls that now rot in the hatred around me
This is bitter to endure, dreary and horrid
Death itself is little worse, monstrous fate condemned us all
Obscured visions paint a picture of a rotting world
Unnaturally dark &amp; still

Time cannot erase our inner worth,
Will this be our last day on earth

Their souls may burn in hell but there's time to save ourselves
Just save ourselves their souls can burn in hell
My wounds rip open again but they're way past bleeding
My veins have long since dried, my ears still hear them screaming
Butchered in the blood they shed

Time cannot erase our inner worth,
Will this be our last day on earth
What madness is this? Shaped figures of the damned
The fall of the testament of man
