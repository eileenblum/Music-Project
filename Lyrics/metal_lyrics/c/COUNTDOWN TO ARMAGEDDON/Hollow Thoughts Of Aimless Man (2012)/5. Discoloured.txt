This is no ordinary story you can't just read between the lines,
You'll never turn a page in hope to find the slightest peace of mind.
Discoloured pictures line these hollow corridors,
Where in salvation blurs my thoughts become the rise and fall of things to come
Though the tables turned I feel your still with me somehow
My heart is fire for the words you left with me
Burning to see a brighter future as clouds move in the lights grow dim,
I search the soul within
Light rain envelopes me cold to the touch bitter to taste,
They still have their king but I have lost my ace

I've colored the pictures in between the lines
I thought this story was ours to write
Despite the fall, we'll find our way
Still it feels so cold without your flame

It's not that I'm disappointed you've become more than everything
And the world will know your name tonight
I don't care if it's no important I just wanted you to see
Because I'm right, the whole world will scream your name tonight
All this blistered skin screams is piercing notes blurred empty love
They still have their king but I have lost my ace
