My shadow has consumed me and now all light passes through
In one ear and out the other salvation dissipates when I think of you
Standing at the point of no return I came to find myself
Hesitating and looking back on a life guided by a hearse
Beating through this empty chest the sweet nothingness
Looking at this faceless name destined to a premature death
Solitude is where I live pathetic is how I've come to be.
Feeling its strength upon my breath until my skin turns black and blue

Sometimes I wonder why I feel so close to death
Stretched thin and hanging by a thread
Waiting on the edge of something I can't escape,
Could it be that I'm the reason all this pain is now the final breath I take

I've been led astray by no one other than myself
This labyrinth inside my head is like a personal hell
Finally I've come to an end after sifting through the shit
Only to find the last piece of the puzzle doesn't even fucking fit

This dream has taken its toll on me.
