Moving through the trees a voice is calling me
Out to meet it face to face
Guile as the softest breeze it
Whispers to me "Did you forsake yourself?
Do you recall your name?"
Pressing on me
To realize what has come to be
Disconnected for infinity
One last time I'll make you remember
Will you bind the ties that were severed?
I'll tear down the sky
In hope to bring you to me
I don't care if it kills everything.
I wouldn't leap but for a reaching hand
But all I see is a moon and a lonely man
I'm a poor man when it comes to
The wealth of love
A slave to the recession of you
I look to the midnight clouds and find myself
Lost in the stars the lone wolf howling at the moon
One last time I'll make you remember.
