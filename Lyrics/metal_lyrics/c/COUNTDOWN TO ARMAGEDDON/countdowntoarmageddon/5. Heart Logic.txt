As long as those bright eyes gleam up at me
Ill smash through all adversity
To the voices that scream along with me
Your true people here deliberately
You are my everything so fuck the petty diversity,
My heart won't submit to tergiversation the apparent state of duality
A logic born from a focused rage of clarity that bloomed inside of me
I'll never preach from the book of tragedy
What I am now is what I have been
For I am a spawn of infinite awareness
What I will be is what i do now
We gave our minds and our bodies
And this is what we've got in return
Its so surreal watching dreams and reality merge,
And we're still so far from the end of the story
But all the world's fame and money
Could not compare to what we've gained already
Know this, know this, you're my only reason to live
In life we find pure gems in non-physical stasis
Show me your heart, open your mind
Relinquish the senses and see me.
Lost myself in the smoke and the haze,
Stuck looking at the world through a toxic gaze
Dependent on a love sick phrase
Dictated my deranged fucked up ways
No more breath for own sympathy
As there's millions without anything
This broken choir that's deafening
Can shift the minds of humanity
Now forget the mind and the body,
look deeper inward, I'm sure you will learn
that you could heal all the pain in the heart of the world.
and we're still so far from the end of the story,
so fuck all of the fame and money
and just enjoy what life brings in our journey
