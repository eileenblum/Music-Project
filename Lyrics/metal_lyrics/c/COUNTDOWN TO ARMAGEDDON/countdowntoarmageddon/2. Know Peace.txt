I wish to set a fire in your mind, to strike you like lightening through the heart.
I want to break down the walls that keep you blind and rebuild them
With truth, love and light.

Feel the pace is quickening, a spirit storm of the consciously waking
Still the mist is thickening, undiscerning souls at bay with the deafening

We were born from the mud,
As entities of love,
Soul mind and body entwined

Enshrine and revive that hunger to reach the sun
For then the cowards will run
For the dark with their serpent tongues

Spent my nights distant from nature
Now in my head I have to face this creature
I'll close my eyes and appreciate this place of pleasure
A battle for bliss, A gravitational pull
Into the wilderness

Peace, Heiwa, Frieden, Salaam. Peace, Hotep, Sossego

"The weak cannot forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong."
So be a wise man, or be a dead man
Be ignorant but in the end you know you're still fucking wrong.

My journey led me to dismantle the soul gate.
Now disconnected from this cycle of relentless hate.
I kneel before the river of life that flows out space and time.
And wash myself clean of all the filth that plagued my life.

Enshrine and revive, be the tree above the status quo
Hate filled seeds won't let you grow
Make it love and everything will flow

I have been graced with eyes that pierce the blackness
And I will change to make myself an example
The world will know peace and it will start with me
And it will start with us.
