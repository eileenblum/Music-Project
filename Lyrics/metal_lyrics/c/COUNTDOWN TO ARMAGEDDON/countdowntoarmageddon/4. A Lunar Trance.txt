My eyes adjust to the dark, I see them clearer now
The cancers hooded and cloaked before the sea
Of universal fear, a womb forged, I dove for eternal swim.
"Submerge to abyss,
Drown and die in the rising tides.
Repossession into light, decipher the fire and return to night"
I won't be institutionalised, For a journey forms inside
We are the substance they are trying to hide
Behind another subcontracted lie
Engineered version of mankind,
Subjects Forced to procreate work and die
The fruitless sublime design
They've made the skies grey, To lock our minds away
In this planetary cage, A fathomless truth awaits
My feet ache, Can't fucking walk straight, Can't shake this headache
I thank you for this pain now I can focus my rage
The only tyrant i accept is the silent voice within
That voice within
"I've been to the ends of the soulless black.
Felt the chill climb up my back"
Death, consumes us all. spawning the phrase for the corrupt to fear
"Fear, our soaked pours of fermented pain"
I hear children dying, I'm here naked and crying for their lives
Minds poisoned locked away from light
Evil comes for each and every child.
