Now as my death brings an end to the hurt,
And my body is one with the earth.
My soul transcends above this universe
I know the truth about what I'm worth

A voice descended from the constellations
And echoed through the trees
The moon and the stars calling us to meet
Where the sun sets fire, to the sea

If you take away my light,
Then I'll decide to live in shadow
To face all the ages of this world alone

With eyes unclouded witness my rebirth
I grew tired of all the propaganda
And found myself in this sick utopia

We create

Only hate for the oppressors
We are the slaves and they're the masters
Hear me now we are the answer

If you take away my light,
Then I'll decide to live in shadow
To face all the ages of this world alone

We create our ideal place or state.
