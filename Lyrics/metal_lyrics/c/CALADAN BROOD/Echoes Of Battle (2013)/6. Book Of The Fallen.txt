Still we ride, fight, and die
Wayward path far beyond the pale
We are lost, marching on
Heavy hearts longing for those lands we once called home

Emerald hills, sparkling seas
Fade to distant memory
Horizons blaze in foreign land
Ochre seas of scorching sand

The fires of YâGhatan burn in the night
The shadows of a fallen god
Chains against light

For weeks on end we journey on
Weary and worn, the glory is gone
All thatâs left are tired souls
Aching limbs and dreams of home

The fires of YâGhatan burn in the night
The shadows of a fallen god
Chains against light

Marching on as one as the ghosts of brothers sing
Deep in the night where their faces haunt our dreams
Halfway through the veil we are summoned to Hoodâs gate
Lands rimed in frost, they will damn us to our fate

Push on through the din of the slaughter
Flight through this perilous land
To where our blades spring forth
Soldiers of Empire Malazan
We fight for the seat of the highborn
Our fates were never our own
Weathered skin is battered and broken
Bloodstained dawn in a land unknown

Stars reign in the sky of the desert
Lost in the blistering sands
A host now long forgotten
Soldiers of Empire Malazan
Far away from the hearths of our fathers
Weâre never returning home
Weathered swords are a warriorâs burden
Battles fought but our deeds will go untold

Still we ride, fight, and die
Wayward path far beyond the pale
We are lost, marching on
Heavy hearts longing for those lands we once called home

Dawn has brought its cleansing light
So we behold a mournful sight
The fading sounds of clashing steel
Bodies strewn across the field

The fires of YâGhatan burn in the night
The shadows of a fallen god
Chains against light

Buried seeds, scattered bones
Blazing hearts by steel sent home
Mortal screams, names unknown
Shattered dreams by steel sent home

Strap on your shields and raise your banners
Hear the call of raging battle
Beneath a hail of burning arrows
Push ever forward, never surrender
Siege weapons tolling out like thunder
Ripping the city walls asunder
Columns of flame reach ever skyward
Horizons filled with burning pyres
