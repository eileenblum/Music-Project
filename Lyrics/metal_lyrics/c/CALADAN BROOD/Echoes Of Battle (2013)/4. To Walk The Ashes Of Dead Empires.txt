The burning fires fill the sky as a golden light enfilades the night
Shattered mountains crumble away, their smouldering heaps upon the plains
Ashes of gods, a cinereous rain
A torrent of death covers the slain
Blood has stained the silent stone where armies have fallen before the throne

The burning fires fill the sky as a golden light enfilades the night
Shattered mountains crumble away, their smouldering heaps upon the plains
The mortal cries of perishing thralls
Ancient towers topple and fall
Beleaguered spirit, dying pride
Dawn of sorrow, lamenterâs shrine

Such a slaughter, this battle of gods
What a deluge, these rivers of blood
The call of T'iam beckons me
I have awoken to the rage
Lost in thought, lost in space, lost in time
Lost within this storm we drive
Unleashing chaos inside
The endless night sky dims my eyes

The burning fires now subside as a golden dawn dethrones the night
The aftermath of battleâs toll, mighty silence they behold
Landscapes bathed in colours pale, dressed in blood and broken maille
Splintered spears, shattered swords, unmarked graves
The cost of war

Son of shadows betrays the night, father walks away from light
Mother Darkness leaves us to die
Kharkanas sounds its final hour, resplendent halls are empty and pallid
Brothers forced another way
A breach was sealed but a host was torn, raised this wall only to fall
Bones ground into sands of the shore
A voice reborn and a voice was shorn, the vice of centuries of life
Must we make this sacrifice?

Empty halls sing a hollow fall
Dust-strewn cobblestones lead them home
Ships now dreaming in their quiet ports
Raise your glass to the ones returning
Icy barrows and forgotten swords
Snow-capped mountains hold forgotten words
Deeds heroic and deeds unknown
Carved upon the empty throne
