Across the plains come drifts of sand
From graves of water and tombs of man
The hollow weight of history
Desiccated and blowing free

In the wake, all is dust

The bones of beasts and the bones of kings
Become dust in the wake of the hymn
Mighty kingdoms rise, but they all will fall
No more than a breath on the wind

Spectres and gods adrift in the wild, mournful wind
Vast cycles unfold across the span of Ã¦ons
Colossal keeps consumed and left as burial mounds
And even stars will fade into empyrean shrouds

In ashen vaults, on parchment scrolls
The echoed verses state soft the toll

In the wake, all is dust

Vast desolation
Silent grave of Ã¦ons

Revenants watch from cold cosmic towers
Glimmering eyes of jade bear final witness

Temples crumble as the great wheel turns
Ground to dust
Monuments and megaliths unnamed
Fall the same
Earth and sky enrobed in deathless void
Endless night
Worm of Autumn claims its final throne

The bones of beasts and the bones of kings
Become dust in the wake of the hymn
Mighty kingdoms rise, but they all will fall
No more than a breath on the wind
