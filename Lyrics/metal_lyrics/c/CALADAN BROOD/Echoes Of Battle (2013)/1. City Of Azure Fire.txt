The pale blue fire of glittering spires ablaze
The sojournerâs beacon, a wondrous shimmering place
Through ages forgotten, in many a travelerâs dream
Through winding cobblestone pathways
Where dwell demons, mages, and thieves

In temples and taverns where secrets are whispered
Arcane knowledge hides in their halls
Shadows gather in midnight processions
As wraiths and ghosts sing laments in the walls

Written in blood and sealed in death
Bound by the ages, the tome of regret
Fates will be sealed and swords will be met
With the cold embrace of steel and flesh
Eldritch beasts converge on the streets
Of this ancient city, so beautiful and wild
Veils of night, the tolling of bells
Funeral march to the sound of the knell

The pale blue fire of glittering spires ablaze
The sojournerâs beacon, a wondrous shimmering place

Far beyond moon and sun
Long is the path to the end
Azure flames light the way
