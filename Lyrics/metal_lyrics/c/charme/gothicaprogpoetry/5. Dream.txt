So the dream has come to an end
And I'm taking all you down with me
Nothing's gonna change my mind
My anger dwells inside of me
No one is getting out alive
This time I've lost my mind
But I don't care
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your doubts
Mean nothing
And still my answer remains
My soul will never surrender
'till I find peace of mind
My dream has come to an end
But I won't die
I've fought to get your love
Guided by desire of getting you
But everything had no use
All was rigth but you don't believe
And for that I am here to say
You're the cause, you're the guilt
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your doubts
Mean nothing
And still my answer remains
My soul will never surrender
'till I find peace of mind
My dream has come to an end
But I won't die
