Nobody has come to see you there
But you're so proud you don't see that
Everything you'll do this afternoon
Will lead us to the emptiness
Surrender to this double dealing
You'll never walk alone into the eyes of the night
Remember I got you on my mind
And you're so far from home
When it all comes down to the line
You will just feel the pain
A million network slaves
Trying to break away
From running with the pack that you betray
See, what's ruling our lives
Inside my head I feel the fear is rising on
Every minute
I'm getting weaker while into the jungle
They grow strong, they grow...
What is there for me you can't understand
Gotta get my song, I can't go wrong
Leaving you alone, lay by my side
Look into the dream, so I realize
Step on those who put you on your throne
All you care about's to get your score
Raging by myself I just can scream
But still my eyes can see
When it all comes down to the line
You will just feel the pain
A million network slaves
Trying to break away
From running with the pack that you betray
See, what's ruling our lives
Inside my head I feel the fear is rising on
Every minute
I'm getting weaker while into the jungle
They grow strong, they grow...
What is there for me, the story's been told
What is there for me, my days have been sold
What is there for me, my hope falling down
Ruins of your power lay smashed on the ground
