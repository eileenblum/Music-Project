My sweet prince, you used to love a lady
You wrote poems for her, you were so kind
Now she's hearing you're becoming crazy
That you've lost grip of your amazing mind
And she tastes sorrow as youtold her
Love is vain, she'd better be far away
A thousand needles stuck in her tired heart
The last thing she expected you to say
They say it was him to take away your life
Beloved father I'm going to meet you again
Everyone but this river has let me down
So I just let me drown
I let the river flow over
A life driven by others
I let the water cover
This burden of troubles
Flows my body among the flowers
Thank you, branch, wooden savior
I watch me drown, finally free
Now I'm dying I start to breathe
My dear brother, please don't you suffer
I'll be fine, you'll always be this strong
It's so hard to face the loss of everything
That gave you meaning to belong
In this place, this cold and rotten nation
Twenty years of blind obedience to what you all told
I can't go on without an explanation
Wanna leave behind all the evil of this world
Still in death I can't find my peaceful sleep
I've been stumentalized against what made me real
I've set free my head, they labeled me just mad
These flowers be my crown
I let the river flow over
A life driven by others
I let the water cover
This burden of troubles
Flows my body among the flowers
Thank you, branch, wooden savior
I watch me drown, finally free
Now I'm dying I start to breathe
I let the river flow over me..
I see teared eyes around,
Around my grave
Who're you talking to, love?
The skull you hold won't speak
You see, my flesh, so solid
Now is melting
To die, to sleep, to dream

Was my choice
I let the river flow over
A life driven by others
I let the water cover
This burden of troubles
Flows my body among the flowers
Thank you, branch, wooden savior
I watch me drown, finally free
Now I'm dying I start to breathe
