Treat me like a princess
Treat me like a goddess, treat me like a slave
Make me go insane
Let me dive in your eyes
Let me drown in your smile, let me adore your face
Die in your embrace
Couldn't you just own me?
Lump in my throat, hold me, I'm clay in your arms
Half-killed by your charme
Not for love, I'm looking for a proper place to die
In my soul lust is inborn, can't smother it though I tried
Not for love is flowing up the fire in my soul
Deep inside, screaming wild, yearning more and more
I chase hunters to be a prey, masters to be a slave
Passions for my blood to be drained
For my sweat to run, for my skin to burn
Too much won't be enough
Shivering for your scent
Melting down in your hands, you can torture me
Anyway you please
Let me caress your lips
Then kiss your fingertips, get down on my knees
Crawling at your feet
Make me beg to have you
Rape me 'till I cry blood, tie me to a bed
Swear you'll die for me
Not for love, I'm looking for a proper place to die
In my soul lust is inborn, can't smother it though I tried
Not for love is flowing up the fire in my soul
Deep inside, screaming wild, yearning more and more
I chase hunters to be a prey, masters to be a slave
Passions for my blood to be drained
For my sweat to run, for my skin to burn
Too much won't be enough
Heaven dwelling in my hands
Pleasure giver, pain receiver
Heaven sneaking on your skin
Feel for me
I chase hunters to be a prey, masters to be a slave
Passions for my blood to be drained
For my sweat to run, for my skin to burn
Too much won't be enough
