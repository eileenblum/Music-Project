I have bottomed out and my future doesn't fit into my schedule.
All booked up on depression and self-loathing.
Buried deep in sleep from passing out, no time to plan ahead. 
Someone please tell me, why do i think this way?
Someone please tell me that this isn't the end of everything. 

A chemical imbalance? No. The smell of my own vomit lost in my last tears.
No more kissing clocks or throwing coins into wishing wells to try and fix the way I fucked myself. 

When it's finally here, it's never enough and when it's finally gone, it's never coming back.
Somehow I fooled myself into believing that this would work out, that I wouldn't end up hurt.
