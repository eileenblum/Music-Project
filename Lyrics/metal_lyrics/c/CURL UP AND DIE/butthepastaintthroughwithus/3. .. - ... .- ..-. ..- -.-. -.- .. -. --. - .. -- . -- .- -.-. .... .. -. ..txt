Sick of being sick and sucking the disease.
A longing for longer than just temporary, because it's
contaminating.
And I want to tell the truth...I'm not doing so well. How do I
save myself?
It feels like I'm lost in the climate of lonely apartment life.

This way, I can't be who you want to be.
And this way, I can't be who I really am. But I am trying.

(Deal with what you have and what you'll have left, because
there is no such thing as fresh start.)

I am no good at being around. I am no good at being alive.
But I am trying.
