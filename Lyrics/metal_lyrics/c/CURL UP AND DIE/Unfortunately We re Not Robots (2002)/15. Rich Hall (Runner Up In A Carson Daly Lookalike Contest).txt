Away from the rivers we gather our things for tonight. apart from the ocean the smell of this worn away machine carrys her away. alone i said to myself, "i will wait for you." the city shined shades of white tonight. covering all the filth, it almost seemed safe here. clouded city now hidden by the crowded structures and her lost citadels. you never wanting and me never knowing, we move on. tired angel buried beneath the towering divide come back to me, wake from your slumber. for all the reasons these fingers never wanted to quit drawing yours. (these words were all for you.) like a story she read once i lie in an empty bed. together we're better seperate. i'm better off alone. this quick romance has killed me.
