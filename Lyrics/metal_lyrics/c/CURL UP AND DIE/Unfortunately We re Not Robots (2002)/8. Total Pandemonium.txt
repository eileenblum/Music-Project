We set our heads to rest and fall out of form and grow numb enough to never move again. we lose our sights and these roses no longer blossom. i fail to hear these sounds now. tightly our hands felt for eachother's when we said goodbye. the exquiste architecture ruined our blessed nights and we can no longer pretend. for months for these memories to melt away at the most akward of moments. this is my last word, my lost love. we will never meet again.
