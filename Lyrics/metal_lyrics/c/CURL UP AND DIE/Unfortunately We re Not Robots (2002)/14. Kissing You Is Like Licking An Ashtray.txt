Letters smear like butterfly wings for this pulse which lost itself into mechanisms and diagrams. she found me upon lonely traveled roads wading through these unforgiving waters. through the unfamilar voice of acheivements and this coincidence. these are the subtle moments that frame us with her voice now heard across these great distances. we couldn't keep our arms around each other long enough to fall in love. silence clenches this throat in ten years past.
