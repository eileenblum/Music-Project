i have fallen for you. i never got the chacen to tell you, 'tear these feathered wings from my back.' i couldn't hid this internal bleeding. smiles of my filth on my dripping second. seconds counting, i fade away with the wind to deny me freedom. please let me go. a child bearing his final sign. lying in sheets tainted with splattered blood of what was once me, but things aren't so beautiful anymore. now i am death. these voices i draw are direct, seemingly undecieving. nothing comes out so simple. i notice i tore these wings with my own hands. everything seperating me from what is life. entwined in messages of inexistence and missing memories desolving like my one love, my only love. i will never feel your touch while i hear my name from your lips again. my sunrise is the darkness. i will miss you.
