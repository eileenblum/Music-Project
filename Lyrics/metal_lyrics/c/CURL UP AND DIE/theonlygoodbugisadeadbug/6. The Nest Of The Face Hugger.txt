blank sheets enveloped in grieving. foolishly bleeding for you. waiting. it was never meant to be today. window panes coaliding and worried drips of sweat that have fallen from my chin. the devil devoted and she brought this trembling. all of this collapsing, i seed through. seized ceiling preaching sinister color. i reach to anything recognizing and it all comes back to you. you with your hands would heal all my scars and so i as, 'after i lost everyhing would you hold me and would you love me until this spine could hold this head up high again?' that's all i'll ask, i won't ask. he is dead.
