broken in sections. my breath is losing it's rhythm and my pulse is the center of attention. render these arms useless. i tryed not to hear her voice, but it is everything. this was the goodbye i never said. pain trhust through chest, i miss her bearthing and i am so sick of mine. dying in bleachers with my corner eye crush. was this the last time i would see you? was this our farewell? it just isn't enough when i can never see your face again.
