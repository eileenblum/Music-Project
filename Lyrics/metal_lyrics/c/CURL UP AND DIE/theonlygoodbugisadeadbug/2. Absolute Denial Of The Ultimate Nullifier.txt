bury the knife deep within my chest and with one last kiss goodbye i'll shut my eyes for a final time. whether or not i found this falling i will carry the strength of the dead and be buried by the fear of these thoughts. and just like those pictures, i am melting through your hands. these demons dividing, they burned out our one sun and i cower beneath it all. i'll find them overhead. death from above
