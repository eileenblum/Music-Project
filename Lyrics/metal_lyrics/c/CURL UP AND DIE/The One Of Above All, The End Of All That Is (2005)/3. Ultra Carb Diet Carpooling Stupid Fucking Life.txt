Is there anyone in this city?
Anyone who isn't asleep?
I'm feeling lost counting steps between street lights.
Still drawing triangles on my wrists.
Hanging out in grocery stores without a home.
Not anymore.

I'm all alone. I'm all alone again. I'm all alone.
Chasing my memory. Everyone's moving but me.
