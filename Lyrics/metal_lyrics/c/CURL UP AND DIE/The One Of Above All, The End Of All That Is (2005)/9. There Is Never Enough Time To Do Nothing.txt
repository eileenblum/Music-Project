There is a need that comes in the night.
Heavy in mood. Draining of life.
We're closet lovers with our secret sex.
We fall in love trying to fill the holes.

There is a need that comes in the night.
Someone who somehow medicates.
We're closet lovers with our secret sex.
We fall in love trying to fill the holes.
