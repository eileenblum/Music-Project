I'm black eyes and bruised bones.
Open wounds that won't close.
More drooling than dreaming.
In a cold cough barely breathing.

I'm flash floods and mudslides.
In dry heat that never dies.
More than ordinary stale as shit.
Bipolar explorer.

I'm the power of worry and panic attack.
A shot in the dark. The beauty in black.

I'm the stomach of a new found love.
A lonely man's grocery store crush.
I'm the heart and the blood in failing hard.

Still...
You can't destroy me.
I'm invincible. Unbreakable.
