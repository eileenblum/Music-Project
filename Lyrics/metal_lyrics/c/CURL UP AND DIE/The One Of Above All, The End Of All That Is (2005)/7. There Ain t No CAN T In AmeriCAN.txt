This is how I react to everything.
I'm trying to fit images like people looking for love.
And still trying to find a way to be straight with myself.
But nothing seems to stick. (I pick everything apart.)

This is just a life without leads.
A sad song in french.
The things no one knows how to talk about.
And this is how I react to everyting.
Second guessing certainty.

I'm falling in and out of life
Like people looking for love.
I don't know what I want.
I don't know what to do with myself.
