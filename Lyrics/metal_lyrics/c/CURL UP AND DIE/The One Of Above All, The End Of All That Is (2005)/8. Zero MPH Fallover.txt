A sweet sweat. A wet mess.
I want everything all at once.
And I always do what I hate.
I've run into running in place.

I'm single speed sprinting a marathon.
I'm slipping away, it's all or nothing.

I feel trapped and I don't know why.
I don't understand goodbye.
You keep me alive.
You keep me alive.
