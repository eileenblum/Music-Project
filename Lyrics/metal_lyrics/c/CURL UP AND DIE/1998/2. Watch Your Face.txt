i didn't really need an explanation, when half of the time i was wondering if we were both in this the way i was, if every second you were thinking of me, when all i was thinking about was you. sometimes, i truly wish that i wasn't real. sometimes, i'd wish that they would remember the five hundred million dead, because when you were off alive, i'd lie here in my own blood. the blood you'd wash away every single time, right before i'd fall just far enough into being the model they created me to be. sometimes, i'd wish that they would remember themselves. that was only half of the time though.
...you better watch your face.
