I foment the needs of man
I am the perfume of soul extremity
My spirit is shining to debouch in dazzling flames
Frozen heart of darkness in earch of peace of mind

[Chorus:]
Far away is the end of times
Horizon pierced through my silence
A rapture in fall the triumph of lighting
Descent inside me the sacred past
Transcendence I tempt myself to it

Delirium tremens of world
Falling blood the gangrene of beyond
I'm waiting on the dreams of night dawn to bright
I've lost my footing and I have outgrown my life

Far away is the end of times
Horizon pierced through my silence
A rapture in fall the triumph of lighting
Descent inside me the sacred past
Transcendence high residence of bold
Transcendence imminent soul return
Transcendence purity of essence
Transcendence I tempt myself to
