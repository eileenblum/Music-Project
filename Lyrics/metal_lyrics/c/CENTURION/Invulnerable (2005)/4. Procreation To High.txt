Modern world lost the meaning
Of the ancient tradition
The heroic concept of family
Out of control the real centre
Figure of father killed by the
Shadow of individualism

Unity of today
Conception of conformism
Spiritualism is going down

[Chorus:]
I'm the throne of wonder
Invisible touch
Holy reroute to the procreation to high
Monumental ferro-concrete area
High climax of man by the
Procreation to high

Prime regeneration
All around reigns the end of
Searching for the way to skies
Consecration of falling
Contemplation of void
Land of tears and the
Awakening of the wild

Animal spirit of degradation of life
Unstopped dissolution of life
Basal completing of man

[Chorus]
