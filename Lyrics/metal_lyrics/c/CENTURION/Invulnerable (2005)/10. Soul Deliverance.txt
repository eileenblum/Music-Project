Transcendent trust
Completing delivering inside
Window of beyond
End of good and evil the sacrifice
Dangerous try
Absolute entity of the truth
Pure affirmation
Sacred heart and high level of myself

Bound to readiness
In a world without sense
I crashed the limit of the existence

[Chorus:]
Soul deliverance freedom I am
Bold deliverance passion I am
Soul deliverance discovered I am

I carried myself beyond my being
Witness of life
Golden building heritage of pride
Spiritual fire
Greatest might dimension of no shape
I'm the spreading future
High pleasure dominion inside
No temptation
End of touchable god of mankind
I'm the reaction of sign
Definitive shoot of morrow
I'm myself and I'll be for ever myself master

Bound to readiness
In a world without sense
I crashed the limit of the existence

[Chorus]
