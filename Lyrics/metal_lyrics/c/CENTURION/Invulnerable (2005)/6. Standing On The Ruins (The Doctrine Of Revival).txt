I behave without the behaving
With the success or without the success
Of my seed
I'm the will without desire
The real new dimension
The evocation of mine

Naked interior way to reality
Domination of the invisible reload

I'm the clarity of every toward
I'm intact in the fragment
And erect in the curve
Super natural divine nucleus
Landing of unconscious
Expression of myself

[Chorus:]
Alone I'm standing on the ruins
Of the human madness
Like the statue of dominion of fear
I'm the temple of the doctrine of revival
I'm the new man

I'm the final searching shoot of might
Of the one way the sovranity of mine
I'm the witness of nobility inside
Superior spiritual courage of life

[Chorus]
