The escalation of what I am
The elevation of high existence of new health
The transformation by the grace
Of detonation of the becoming purity

Invulnerable sign of endless birth
Irrevocable destination of pride

[Chorus:]
I'm the bridge between brutality and eternal
Chrism of matter I'm the ropes of eternal return

I'm the powerful tension to high
The servant of faith
Veteran of interior war
Inebriated arise of morn
To the absolute ordered from high to high

Invulnerable sign of endless birth
Irrevocable destination of pride

[Chorus]

I'm the bridge the eternal return
I'm the ropes he endless rebirth
