I'm not a member of this world
The abyss of life
Never surrender to the endless
Falling of treasure of mankind
The man of tradition I am from high
To high I'm the kingdom
Of honour and pride

[Chorus:]
I'm the riot against the modern
Vision of society
The secret of the truth I feel
I'm the supreme valour
And the sacred order of eternity
The dawn against the chaos
Of human minds

I am antithesis of this world of pain
Blood red tomorrow
And forces of evil
Invade horizon of man
Leader of future
I am the reality of brave
Guardian and rebel
Storming word fever

[Chorus]

The flower of morn I am
