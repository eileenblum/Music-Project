Stranger I am the stranger
Loudness here is my loudness
Gasping heartbeat dauntless ground
Lament of knowledge can be found

I feed on all need reroute to feel rebirth of the soul
(Revision of fire)
I'm on the ground over the crowned deploration of world
(Addicted to turn)

[Chorus:]
New freedom high level of getting clear
It's spitting out the way
Last pathway man-eater dead soul grind
It's the new resistance the insurmountable river

Father I saw my father
I'm catching the acid reign of mindless
Laceration rostrum of deal
Sacerdotal sword and shield

I feed on all need reroute to feel rebirth of the soul
(Injection of power)
I'm on the ground over the crowned deploration of world
(Explosion of soul)

[Chorus]

Face the new freedom
It's coming out from my future
The insurmountable river
