I act in the dimension of promise
Dead and reborn under the sign of haul
I'm the tradition divine reign of searching
The meaning of our life I know it very well

Out of it I can't exist without me it can't be free

[Chorus:]
I'm the man who must always get over
Myself the master of will and the fury of soul
Regeneration high to the new nation
I'm getting over the same life
Virtus of millions of heartbeats

I'm the control of the entirely of fire
Revenge of high effect evolution of chime
I'm the radiant ascension of power
I feed on fogs of life the rationalism world

I'm sorely in need of fountainhead of the heat

[Chorus]
