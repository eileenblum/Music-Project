I am myself and I'll be for ever myself
I'm the action from inside
The definitive hard strength
Against the incapacity of mankind
The passive obey
And its ordinary existence
I am the cure the forthcoming life

[Chorus:]
Invulnerable
I am the son of soul
Invulnerable cause I am invulnerable
I was born out of light
Invulnerable

End of negativity transcendental fire
Intrepidity meaning
I'm the shoot of future power
Super intensity of might
Unconditional will
I'm the lawmaker from inside
Supreme flag of framing

[Chorus]
