It's the beast called simply life you can't face it
The savage terrorizer is growling
Put the meet in the point of defence and
Wait for the right moment
To jump on the neck of smoking demon

Hard attack I'm the heart of tradition
The warrior of soul

[Chorus:]
I am riding the tiger's rage
Riding. Riding the tiger

Dangerous war against the wild
Baptized fighting
Ready to face the earthbound message
Animal spitted out of hive
The industry of blinder
It's not the death by misadventure

Hard attack I'm heart of tradition
Warrior of soul the heat seeker of underworld
I'm the man begot by the last future
For the clash inside

[Chorus]
