While the woods call my name
frozen winds blows through my hair
Eagles of Rome fly up high
Are you ready to feel the power
of this land

Snow covers imperial Alps

Where the wind kiss the clouds up high
Up high the white mountains
touch the blue sky
Great endless realm is open wide
The grasses of Gods sing the glory of this show

Snow covers imperial Alps

You're face to face with the force of nature
It's time to fight no turning back
It's time to live the power of Alps
It's time of victory!
