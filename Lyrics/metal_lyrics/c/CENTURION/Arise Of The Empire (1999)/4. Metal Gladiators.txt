I'm the master of destruction the leader of the armies
I'm the shadow from the endless night
The death walks behind me you can't stop the saviour
I'm the demolition dynamite

From the void of the dark high up to the wind
Let the sons of Rome kill the wild in a chariot of gold

Side by side with Caesar I'll open the graves of soldiers
I'll smile 'cause you damned to die
Metal gladiators shall rise from the abyss
Do you hear their power that will blast the savage lands

Razing to the ground every street of every town
Let roman steel rides the clouds in chariot of gold

Shooting the brains by the stainless steel bent
I was forged in the fires of Hell
Through the bullet storm I'm the scream of the fright
I was born in the fire and I'll ride the sky

Northern ravens stopped their dance on the roman heads
sucking blood and turning fast
All the arenas are prepared to catch the god of thunder
Do you hear their power that will blast the savage lands

Razing to the ground every street of every town
Let roman steel rides the clouds in chariot of gold
