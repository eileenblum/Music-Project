Guns are screaming
It must be law exploding all the balls
for running blood
Drawn out of anger don't fear the war
Steel kiss of guns unchains my dynamo

I'm chromium plated rebel
like storm I'm coming
to neutralyze again
The leather I wear is to kill
Like whirlwind by wings of steel
I'll rise from fogs of Hell

Guns are screaming straight out of Hell
My father is the pain and my mother
is the suffering
Through blood by thunder take Latin steel
Your children will cry on other knees

Guns are screaming!
