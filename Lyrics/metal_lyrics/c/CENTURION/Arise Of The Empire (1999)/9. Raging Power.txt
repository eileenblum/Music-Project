Rise up from the dark of the no return
Brighter than a million of atomic bomb
Ride the wild horizon by the will of revenge
Shine on blind them show the dawn of a new age

No more tears of children
no more crimes of strangers
high will shine the light
No more sicks of madness
no more middlemen
in the place where the future roamed

Thunder roaring cannons from Armageddon
Blaze up the worldwide your fury cuts up
The asphalt is burning it's the sign of rebirth
The power the will of power pumps our heart

No more christian puppets
no more sweat of backs
the flame will burn on and on
The lower people eye
must be closed in time
for the nation where the future roamed

Take my hand

No more sicks of madness
no more sweat of backs
high will shine the light
No more tears of children
no more middlemen
in the place where the future roamed

Rise up the future of gold
the eagle has landed to spill the blood
highways has cracked up
Rise up days of light!
