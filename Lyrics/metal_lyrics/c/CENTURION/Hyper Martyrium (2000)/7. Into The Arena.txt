You'll pay by your lives dirty and mean
For your crimes in the bloodstained show
The thought about your stench of your guts
Through the air drives me mad

You'll go to the gallows, enjoy ourselves!
Spreaded laughing, it's a good slow end
We are bold praetorians, enormous rams
And wild obsession through your flesh

Violence of the eagles din will rise again
Prostration of bloody arenas of purity

The tortures are prepared
They're half beast and half machine
Demonic jaws
You'll face the ravening troops, brazen chaos
Of the insatiable prince of death

Violence of the eagles din will rise again
Prostration of bloody arenas of purity
