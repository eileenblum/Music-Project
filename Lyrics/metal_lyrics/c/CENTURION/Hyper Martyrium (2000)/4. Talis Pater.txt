The plague lives in lots of brains, don't close your eyes
It sucks the way to perfection under vigilance
Of merciful fate called Christianity
They gonna blind you mind, come total light!

Die protectors (of seed of hot madness)
It's the call-up for legions (against the vile impotence)
Taste our fury (it's the high road to refulgence)
Clear the veins of earth (to stop the seed of plague)

Destroy immediately the terminates of diffusion
Atomic gods are screaming for the new estirpation
Rend their difference called morality
They gonna blind your mind, come total light!

Die protectors (of seed of hot madness)
It's the call-up for legions (against the vile impotence)
Taste our fury (it's the high road to refulgence)
Clear the veins of earth (to stop the seed of plague)

You'll be born again, flame of imperial might
You will blare the fight
Death to plague, it's our radiant orgasm

Gring the clutches of selection, preserve our future
Disintegrate their rules, open the doors of redemption
Born the tattered priests and their controlling dreams
We're blowing up to skin
Broaden our slaughter horizons!

You'll be born again, flame of imperial might
You will blare the fight
Death to plague, it's our radiant orgasm

You will change our life
