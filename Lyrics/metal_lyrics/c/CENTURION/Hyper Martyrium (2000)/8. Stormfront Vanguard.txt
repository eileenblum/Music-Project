Blast millions of bombs to reach full growth
Sing high let me though the fields of ceremony
We fell obligate born to lead
Boiling blood in the veins make raise our strong arms up high

Storm closed the ranks
Lock out morbid shit!
We kill off firmly, dazzled by the rapture of pride

The raking devastation
In the storm lord pure dominion

Death warrant force
With no remorse spits out the fire of hatred cleansing grip
We are supermen born to win
Our slavery is broken by the roman eruption for the new world

Rise from the dead
Crowned days of daze
Deluge the losers 'cause they're shrouded in docility

The raking devastation
In the storm lord pure dominion
