Brothers, listen to the voice from the underground
He was born by power bound to dominate
Under the same flag sons of the same blood
United we are the only force free to celebrate

In his hands lies the doom of elected people
Of our's that's looking for freedom

Caesar, give me a pair of wings!

Stand a sone, together proud we'll be on the march
Whirlwind war emergence is the absolute release
Glorious past holds our spirit to the fight
Primal nuclear anger established our power hearts

In his hands lies the doom of elected people
Of our's that's looking for freedom

Caesar, give me a pair of wings!
And I will give you my soul
Oh Caesar, call me! Take my hand!

Get ready to welcome with open arms
The flower of tomorrow forged for the great victory
Swell with pride your hearts and brand your front
Bewitching blazon mellows the superiority of elected blood

For your name we will die!
Blasting soldiers of the faith
Spangled banners shine our way
The return of purity will flood the world
The supremacy of yours

Caesar, take my hand! Call me!
