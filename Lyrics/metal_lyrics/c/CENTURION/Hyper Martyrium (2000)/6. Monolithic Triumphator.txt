Look at the future
It's the hulking sculpture against the sky
Cry for your bones
It's the monarch of terrorizing jails
That's your paved way fawning pace
Threating and wild slavery, swinging gladius impugnes

You'll crawl mat it's feet
Subdued to the roman art of battery
Admire the immortal
Carnefix and cruelty dominator
Face it's majesty, town of the towns
Fanaticism moulds the vision of final return

Inclines to immensity
Lasting overpowering prevaricator
Rome is the light
Sadist race of fatherland, Sadist race of fatherland
