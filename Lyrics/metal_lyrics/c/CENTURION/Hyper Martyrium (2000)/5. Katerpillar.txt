Come out side from the dark
We are waiting for your backs in the sun
You will be buried alive except your heads
That will come to a bad end

Fine painted faces, fancy clothes and muscles of clay
Rolling steel will turn red by your blood
You're an insult to the primal strength
Effeminate nonsense crushed the breach of the power law

You were bound to get killed
Degenerated shame against the course of life

Hey! Dead meat, we're cheering on
Ignition of infernal engine
The roar will make bleed your trembling ears
Until the extinction we'll kill, kill and kill
Mistakes of shit!
