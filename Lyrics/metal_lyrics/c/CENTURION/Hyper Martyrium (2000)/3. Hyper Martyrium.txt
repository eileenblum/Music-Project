Hyper killing legions will raise to the ground
Hopes of equality
Ideologies of microbes burst
Into flames on seeing our eyes

Open - the gates of wander
Embrace - the revive of
Eagles - rebellion healing
It's the hyper resurrection power
The hyper martyrium

Harrowing Roman clawers
Harvest bugs and mindless middle man
Turbo hellish bruisers
Will fling the way open to the eternal town

Open - the gates of wander
Embrace - the revive of
Eagles - rebellion healing
It's the hyper resurrection power
The hyper martyrium

Caesar's sun will shine down on the lands
Keep your eyes in the temples of light

Open - the gates of wander
Embrace - the revive of
Eagles - rebellion healing
It's the hyper resurrection power
The hyper martyrium

Our vaulting ambitions will broke into pieces
All the years of oppression
