World wide stop little wars
here comes the winged redemption in blood
you all will return provences of Rome
the Legitimator restoration called
Bow and scrape at our feet
comprehension plan by birth
accept the part of slave or destination road to
Golgotha pain is coming maximum execution
Golgotha pain is calling maximum crucifixion
Born again holy hill of pain
push the way of new golden fields
we make no bones about promises
stand in awe of our apocalyptic pride
Let's get down to brass tack
we make bold to give back the world
purity order and peace
gripping dawn of the new empire
You can't decide about your life
it belongs to the eternal Rome
Slavery and Colosseum law
forget mercy and suicide escape
Golgotha maximum restoration calls.
