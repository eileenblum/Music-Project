Blood to bedew will flow for the bowels
of roman rebirth sacred transfixion
the enemy darkened the empire
and on they cross they'll find the furifying death
deluged with their bastard blood
I'll not make them draw breath hanged through flames
their prayers can't dispute the Caesar's magniloquence
Crucifier starves for the killing time
Death rides heel for leather
Crucifier spews the noble revenge
Death rides hell for leather
Hot nails will tear the flesh of oblivion
awful magma blessed the hammers beating
