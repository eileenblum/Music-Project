Hulking pincer movement roaring epilogue of mistakes
Shout! Fire! Panzer chime omnipotent solemnity of hate
do you believe in the apocalypse day?
killer machines opened wide their steel jaws
Turbulent proud splendour hurricane steam roller
Shout! Fire! Panzer chime high convulsion of furnace of pain
do you believe in the apocalypse day?
cleansing machines straight to drain in the earth
Panzermarch run wild the blockade
burn up the road to the glory
Panzermarch claim the divine due
you're dab in designing for death
Faultiness rabble rousing faints offence undoing
Shout! Fire! Panzer chime flagellation born out of hate
do you believe in the apocalypse day?
roman machines prevail over the world
