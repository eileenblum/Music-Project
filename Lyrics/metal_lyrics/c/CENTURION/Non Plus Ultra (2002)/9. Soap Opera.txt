I was born for the end I'm bursting out
I dislike to watch working half done
I look bleeding of crime the circle of soap
I'm in charge of lead to him I come after
like Dallas Fountain of stone and Falcon crest
continous flow production I bring the end
Soap opera no spare no lives
audience of mine no spare no lives
I was born to feel chastity of mind
I raise the series at last fragrancy of success
inhaling the light the passage way
I reprise the serial it laying at me under
I'm the community centre tearing out of my heart
the teamwork calculator for the final instalment
Wake up actors of mine.
