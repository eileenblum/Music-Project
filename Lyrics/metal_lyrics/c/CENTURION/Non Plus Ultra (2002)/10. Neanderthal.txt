I'm the invisible thing that you need
the reflection of your mind
deceased unchristian scream before you bleed
Resuscitate!
'cause I'm the inaccessible madness that reincarnates
the wildest power the bouncer into your nightmares
I was ever born and I will never die
Resuscitate!
I'm the cannibal morbid chill
the measureless multiplier of primal thundering rage
I'm on the prowl
I'm the crowning megalith breathtaking wonder champ
a mammoth into stiff the strongest beast
I'm the primitive regurgitation of prior bestiality
the storming pure energy
I'm the monstrosity carnivorous feast
implacable war the legion of hell
never born never die never die
reincarnate reincarnate
the wild power that will survive
