Vile worms snaked from east to hurl our people in the abyss
revenge blood curdling law it's the highpitch of excitement
we do not entertain a dream we ourselves are the dream
Do you hear their scream from caves high from those mountains burst
you haven't ghost of chance our Caesar blinds the sun
we do not entertain a hope we ourselves are the hope
Non plus ultra eye to eye
We're prop and stay for gear hard elimination smash
you'll burn on seeing our flag starry sky is over our heads
we do not entertain the fate we ourselves are the fate
we do not entertain the war we ourselves are the war
we do not entertain the death we ourselves are the death
