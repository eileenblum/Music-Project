Death - re - born - for... - we are.
Nameless - holocaust - in all ages, - truth - to be - forgotten.

Could we all run down the brutal acts executed in previous times?
As we never learn, take notice of the deeds in the present.
Who has to be supreme, and who wants to be suppressed?
Should man be handled as inferior, should we all point fingers?
Death - re - born - for... - we are.
Nameless - holocaust - in all ages, - truth - to be - forgotten.

Heretics burned by belief.
The play of death on holy ground.
Crusade to mend one's way.
Claim you right of speech.
Dead and gone.
Fair reason to exterminate.

Acts-of-the-past, ex-ce-cu-ted.
Deeds-on-to-last, time-less-a-ges.
Caught-in-all-minds, as-it-all-is.
All-time-des-pair, no-one-to-be-fouled... 
The point of no return.
Raise...the awareness of present be.
Death-re-born!!!
Fair... violations, dead and gone.

Could we all run down the brutal acts executed in previous times?
As we never learn, take notice of the deeds in the present.
Who has to be supreme, and who wants to be suppressed?
Man should be handled as inferior, death reborn.
