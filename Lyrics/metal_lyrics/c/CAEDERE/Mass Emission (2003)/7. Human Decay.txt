Burning eyes, a glowing red.
Sandblast tortures our faces.
Sight reduced to zero.
A sinister howling, heaviness of heart.

Rays of light blocked by toxic clouds.
Dejection by the nutritive strength of darkness.
Smog like our perfume,
masks in front of our faces.

Greenhouse effect causes the melting of polar ice.
Land vanished by the great flood.
Acid rain sours the remainded land.
Which was green in the past, now death in the present.
Due danger of extinction, animals are cloned - animals are cloned..

Production of genetic manipulated food,
blending it with disputable pigments.
Green liquid floating through the sewerage.
The result of chemical infected faeces.

Instead of pestilence, medicine are rare.
Strong will conquer the weak, the killing for sound bodyparts.
Paying high prices for admission in hospital.
The hope to recover totaly is an Utopia

Human decay, memories are fading away. Human decay, no more.
Human decay, suffering under our defeating strike, no more.

Dark future - we posses our,
Dark future - it lies in our hands,
Dark future - we control our,
Dark future - we guide ourselves to our,
DARK FUTURE!!!!

Burning eyes, a glowing red.
Sandblast tortures our faces.
Sight reduced to zero.
A sinister howling, heaviness of heart.
..., heaviness of heart.
..., heaviness of heart.
