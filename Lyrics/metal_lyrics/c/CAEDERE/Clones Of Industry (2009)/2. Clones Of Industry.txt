Profit in a way but who will have the advantage.
The fairest solution is not the only solution.

Creating a sick society.
We are becoming machinery.
Part of the assembly.
Uniform body's without a mind.
A pounding hart but no soul.
Mechanical control.

Clones of industry.
Paradoxical is our evolution.
Technology should enrich our ways.

But we are becoming more pores by it.
Technology takes over human control
Whenever we want it to happen or, or not

Developing a downfall.
Clones of industry.
Tormented genes collides.
Clones of industry.
Interrupted by a syntax error.
Clones of industry.
Just to set our minds free!
Clones of industry.

Should we be?
Paradoxical is our evolution.
Technology should enrich our fucking ways.

Clones of industry.
Forced between the boundaries of the technical definitions which we can't break.
All we can do is to obey our sophisticated creations in our aluminous state.
