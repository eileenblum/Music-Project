As we become more subtilized in our minds
We can perceive different ways of energy and light
Everything is life
Everything is alive with conciousness

Living in the dark at the edge of reality
Not knowing what's real what's not and what's in between
Manipulated souls blinded by masterminds
Reality that's truth and lie at the same time

When you dream you go away into another dimention
You can explore experience it's like an inner extention
Your other self

In my dreams reality means nothing at all
Everything is possible I am in control
A place where there's no fear
A place I wish was real
How come a mind so powerfull
Can be as well so weak
Not capable of understanding our hidden abilities

Live and die  Play the part
Don't ask why  Agonize

I wonder about demons U.F.O.s , deities
Could they all be real
maybe they're just fantasy
Were we created by God
Or did we evolve
I'll never know the answers to the mysteries 
Of this world
