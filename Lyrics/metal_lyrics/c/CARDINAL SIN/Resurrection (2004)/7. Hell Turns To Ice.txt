Human beings
Is that what you call yourselves
Human beings
If you think you deserve respect
But there's nobody we can blame for the misuse of our name

Emptyness lashes unmercyfully
Time seems to stop against my will
I rip in the fangs of a slavering beast
Against the mighty hall of the still

[chorus]

Ashes of pride
Euphoric suicide
When hell turns to Ice 
When hell turns to Ice

Pitifulness sleeps in my head
Washing away all this mess
How can I actually pretend
If I'm worth more than the rest

Criptic missionaire
Sailing the roaring seas
There's no spot on this earth
Where I can be pleased

[chorus]
[solo]

I won't march the protest lines
What do you think?
Am I out of my mind?
Listen to me
Ears close on my words
I'm nothing but I help
To keep alive the world
It's painfull to knowledge
The difference of thoughts
Even the deepest feelings 
With wealth can be bought

[chorus]

Living dangerously
But breathing worse
Impurity Anarchy
Endless source of waste
And who will respond to this call? You?

Don't think twice
Because hell turns to Ice
When hell turns to Ice
When hell turns to Ice
