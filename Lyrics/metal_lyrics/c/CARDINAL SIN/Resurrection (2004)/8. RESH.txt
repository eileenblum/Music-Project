You need my lethal dosage
That deadly poison that flows through your veins
Little by little get's worse every time
Your life goes down the drain

Your mind is overshadowed
Ruins remain through your system
Your blood is in my hands
I feed on your lack of wisdom

[chorus]

Resh
Resh

Flashbacks become a habit
Your mind is on a lease
Devoured inch by inch
Devoured piece by piece

[chorus]

Resh
Resh
Rudely enjoyed suicidal habits 

[solo]

Now that I own you
Disconected your soul from your mind
Put you to death made you new
gave you a taste of my wine
You dwell within my evil
You are troubled you are in pain
Too late can't get out of here
Your sacrifice becomes my gain

[chorus]
