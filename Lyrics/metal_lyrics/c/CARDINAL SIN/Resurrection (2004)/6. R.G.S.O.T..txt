Look at the sky 'cause It's turning red
Nothing to do we shall be dead
The push of a button Apocalypse can begin
Why do we have to die for others to win
You made your bomb as you preached for peace
When will hipocracy ever cease
I won't fight for expression of your hate
It is your bomb and it's your mistake

Many millions who died during the wars
Many mutations and horrible scars
Those who lived the pity holocaust
Living reminders of warefare's cost
We know the ones who started all
We gave them power and now we'll watch them fall

[chorus]

R.G.S.O.T.
Take away our hard working green
R.G.S.O.T.
To make the most powerfull machines
R.G.S.O.T.
Who gives a damn if you win or lose a war
R.G.S.O.T.
Like things are marching the end is not far

Nobody got the right to take our lives
How can we make peace with such a threat in mind
They are leading us to the abyss
Tell our rulers they can sit on this
They think the world is theirs to do what they want
About the people they really don't give a fuck
They cheer for victory death is for us
Lets waste the bastards nail'em to a cross

[chorus]
[solo]

Written on the walls are the names who fell under their seige command
Nobody can erase them but have dared to forget the mortal men
What about the people who await their family to come back
They suffer for reasons that nobody can or will understand
Until they experience the loss of flesh and blood
That's what we have to do so we can be the country's sons

The maniacs who killed humanity
They won't even die of insanity
They force you in with persistence
Like the choice you have for existence

It's only a life we lose
Only a life we lend
You can always make another one 
It's only a life my friend

[chorus]
