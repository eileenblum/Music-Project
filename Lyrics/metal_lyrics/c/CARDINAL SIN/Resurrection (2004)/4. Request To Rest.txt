Strange thoughts blazing through my head
A nether darkness is where I've been led
The world has nothing to offer me
Sometimes I think i wasn't meant to be

Is it attention?  Is it love I want?
Or is it the end pleading in my heart?
My will is weakened by my disbelief
Death could be my only hope for relief

There's no other way for me to turn
Confussion and sorrow is all I've earned
My life has been a total waste of time
A slice of the razor and I'll be fine

Crying out   Pleading out
Heard is no sound
Life to choose  Win to lose
Straight to the burial mound

request to rest to end my sorrow
Request to rest   No tomorrow

In pain 
I dwell
My life
Is hell

Hatred 
Now my eyes only see red
All the pain that I've been fed
Why can't anybody care
For you and me  Nothing is clear
Why am I here?  Who'll dry my tear?

No!
I got no right to take my life
No other answer but to fight
Will not give in 
Someday I'll win,
because we must fail to get it right

We don't choose to be born
Much less when to die
We're not to decide
It's just one life to live
Don't throw it away
Love will find it's way
