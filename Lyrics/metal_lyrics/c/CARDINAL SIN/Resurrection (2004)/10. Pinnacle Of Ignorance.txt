Since the begining of time
man has been obsessed
with finding the means 
to his own extermination
Yes, it's the way of mankind
the way it shall be 'till the end
Pinacle to all ignorance
what we don't understand
we must destroy

Thousands of living species
disapear into oblivion
Irreparable the damage caused
to the delicate balance of the ecosystem
Human imperfection
our terminal disease
Like we have proven before
man is his own worst enemy

How can we be the source
of such stupidity
Why do we always have to be
testing the fragility of life
Increasing warmth of the atmosphere
or a sun blocked by nuclear dust
That's the edge The end of the line
To achieve our own extintion
