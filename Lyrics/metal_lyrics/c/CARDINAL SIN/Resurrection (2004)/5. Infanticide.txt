A sentence of death  
A choke is my last breath
A mistake has given me my life
A homicidal trend 
At the border to the end 
Pain comes ripping like a knife

Sucking my limbs
I lose you win
Let me live don't drain my soul
As soon as I'm done 
Like many more to come
They will throw me in a hole

Succion
Breaking me tearing my limbs
Forceps
Grabbing me crushing my ribs
The only thing that will be left
Is my empty crib

Victims of manipulation
Never enter the population
Genocide Infanticide
All across the nation
Infanticide

Clock is ticking fast
A chance is all I ask
Save your own begotten son
Avoiding my reality
Gambling with your sanity
Remember where you came from

A shallow room a stench of doom
A shattered dream fills my empty crib
A void is left 
A soul without rest
I died before I ever lived
