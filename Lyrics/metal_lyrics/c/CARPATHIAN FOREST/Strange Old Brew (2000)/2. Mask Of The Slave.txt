10 times the power
10 times the pain
He rolls you over
And rape what remains

He exists in every town
He is all around
He stab you where it hurts
Up under your miniskirt

Something never never changes
Something never will
He loves the fire

He degrade
He deprive
He is the judge and jury
Of your miserable life

You are his toilet seat
You are beneath his feet
With this spiked device
He rapes you twice
