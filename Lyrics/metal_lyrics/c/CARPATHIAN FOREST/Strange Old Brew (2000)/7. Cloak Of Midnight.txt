The trail I walk is haunted
By his blinding light

Somewhere
Down there
For eternities undefeated
Unwanted
Untouched
The evil incarnate

The cloak of midnight
Screams are strong
Around the oppressed

Like a blizzard
Like a whirlwind
Like the long lost divinity!
It falls heavy like a stone
I am what I am
Spill the blood one more time

The trail I walk is haunted
By his blinding light

Cloak of midnight
