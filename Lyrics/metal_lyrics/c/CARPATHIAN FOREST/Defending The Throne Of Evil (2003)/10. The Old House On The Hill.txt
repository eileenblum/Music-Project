He lives in a old house on the hill
This elderly man of dark secrets
Haunted by the memories decades ago
Which shaped this man throughout his life
The old house on the hill
A call from hell
Far from people, he lives in the past
Alone by himself, always alone to the last
A saw, a drill and hammering on nails
The curtain covers the dusty windows
Scratching sounds and the sound of knives
Being sharpened from time to time

The old house on the hill
The old house on the hill
