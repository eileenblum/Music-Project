My cold goddess of the night
Squirming under my spiked fist
She's giving me all carnal delights
Submit yourself and drink my blood

I am the bringer of hate
Evil reigns supreme on earth
Defenders of the blackest faith
Which strengthen my inner glow
Mind expanding inner journey
From a grim and bitter soul
Misanthropic violent hellblast
It's darker than you think...

For seemingly endless time
There is still blood on the old oak
This is where you come to die
Over three hundred years old
And still stretching towards the sky
The hangman's oak...

Burning, bleeding, dying
From the inside
Hitting, whipping, kicking
Tthe corpse of christ!!!
Reading, learning, seeing
All knowledge of evil
Watching, waiting, observing
My fallen angel...

I am the mortal guide
With spiritual possessions
I have seen the other side
And I have sold my soul!!!

I have no earthly tombstone
And I have no christian grave
I am a misanthrope
I am not a fucking slave!!!

[Repeat verses]
