I walk the path of death
Which no one will return
I will lead you to this path
And see you burn
The only guiding light
The blackest light
To you who seek the knowledge
I will spill your fucking blood!!!

Follow me through this earthly hell
And lay thy hands on his horned skull
And worship!!!
The fallen angel of doom

Faster, faster
We're heading towards total disaster
My father is fire my mother is hate
Nourished with the blood
That blackened my hellish faith

Poisoned by the christian earth
Baptized by priest at birth
I command and follow lucifer
As the only representative
Living force... Lucifer!!!

The blackest light of evil
I have the knowledge
Spilling my blood!!!

I fell first amongst the angels
Who despise jesus christ
And all other heavenly creatures
Of the so-called heaven
The age of the moon
That should be observed by
All of the true heathen blood
I expect no less!!!
Spill the blood of the fucking lamb!!!
