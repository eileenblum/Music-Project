Why don't you kill yourself
Slit, your wrists
Slit the right one
Now the left.

As a symbol for our end.
Hang yourself in the stairs.

Throw yourself in front of
An eighteen wheel semi truck.

Try to stick your pencils, up your nose
And smashing it into a table

Take a shotgun
And blow out your brain.
You're not using it anyway.

People Don't Care.
This is how life goes.

Take a heroin overdose
Your death is your extasy
And it beats lusting for me.

Why don't you kill yourself
Slit your wrists.

Hang yourself in the stairs.

Throw yourself in front of
An eighteen wheel semi truck.

Try to stick your pencils, up your nose
And smashing it into a table

Take a shotgun
And blow out your brains
You're not using it anyway

People. Don't. Care.
This is, how life goes.

Take a heroin overdose.
