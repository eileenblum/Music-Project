Evil surrounds you, channelling hell
Through the seal...
The only answer lies within
Beholder of all sorrow
The root of damnation, eternal dedication

The night closes in
Dark and cold
Life is an abyss
Profound as a thousand nights

Through the seal of the dark
A journey through the bleakest mist
Evil surrounds you
The presence of death

The gates to madness
Channelling hell
The only answer lies within

Over the ice-cold fjords
Under the wind-swept mountains
The deepest of all forests
Where darkness lies unknown
A layrinth of trees
Grown on the most unholy soil

Forever in darkness
I have touched the hands of death
Beholder of all sorrows
And the well of all human tears
The root of damnation
Suck the marrow of the fucking bone
Eternal dedication
We, brotherhood of the blood

Beholder of all sorrows
And the well of all human tears
