A shiver creeps down my spine
As I wander through these hordes
And when these callous arm
Streches out for me, I feel at home

You are the beholders of silence
Still your voice of wisdom means more to me
Than the words from a thousand men ever will

In a time with religious whores
Which keeps fucking the same cock
I gasp for air, you are my shelter

A forthcoming winter-night
From one of your mighty arms
I will hang in a rope
I am you, and you are the earth!!!

Your presence is indispensable
For the existence of life
Your elegy in stormy nights
One with the earth
And one with death!!!
