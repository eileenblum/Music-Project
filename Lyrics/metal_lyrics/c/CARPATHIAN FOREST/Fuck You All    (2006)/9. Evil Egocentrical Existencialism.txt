[Music: Tehort, Lyrics: Nattefrost]

I vomit on your compassion
Cause there is no salvation
This is maximum fucking hell
I cant fucking breath
I used to live a long life

Maximum fucking hell

A burn and destructive carnival
I vomit on your compassion
Jesus Christ come
Total evil, total hell
(And) time has showed no mercy on me
Understandable I feel the cold I feel the hatred
In the vast glorious nothingness I call human heaven
I'm going down! I'm going down!!! Down!!! Down!!! down!!!
Down!!! Down!!! Down!! Down!!! Down!!!
We're all going down!!! Come on!!! We're all going down!!!
I sing the sons of your meaningless death... Death (din tulling)
You cant save you from your burning
You can feel the devil breathing
You can hear the loud voice of hell
(And) time have showed no mercy on me... (for faen)
Let us all burn!!!
Let us all burn!!!
(And) time have showed no mercy on me...
Mercy on me...
I'm going down...
Down...
