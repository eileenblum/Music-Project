[Music: Nattefrost, Lyrics: Nattefrost]

I embrace the cold Death..
With the burning Blade of Evil
The warm Blood on my hands
THE PENTAGRAM!!!!!
The trembling in your Christian knees
Liar, Weak is the Nature of Man..
What the hell are you waiting for????
Submit to SATAN!!
Cut the flesh (and) submit to Death!!
Whip and burn your skin
The Hellfire will burn deep within
Come Sodomy, Satan and Sin...
KILL GODDAMMIT, Let the war Begin!!
Priests and prophets and the gospel of lies..
The Heaven shall burn, all humanity Dies..
I sin, I sodomize, I slaughter, I sacrifice!!!
SUBMIT!!!! Submit to SATAN!!
Pervert you useless soul
My inner destruction demons
Hold high the black Inverted Cross!!!
Forever submit to SATAN!!!
SUBMIT!!!! Submit to SATAN!!!! Embrace the cold grim Death
The burning blade of evil
The warm blood on my hands
Hold high the black Inverted Cross!!!
Submit to SATAN!!!! SUBMIT!!!!
