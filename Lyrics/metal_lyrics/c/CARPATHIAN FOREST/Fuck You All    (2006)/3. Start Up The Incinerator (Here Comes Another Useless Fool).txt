[Music Tehort, Lyrics Nattefrost]

Start it up
Start it up!!!

I got a desperate urge to slaughter
I have a sickening need to torture
I can die by no human hands
This unholy demon force

I was born to line the tombs of men
I am born of Satan and of sin
Black as a sculpture
Full winged on every cold night
Everyday I eat the fucking apple of Eden
Awaiting the destruction of the gods

I command you all to go out and slaughter
I command you fools to rape and murder
All for the glory of Him!
All for the glory of Hell!

Start up the incinerator
Here comes another useless fool

Thrash!!!
Who the fuck do you think you are?

Start up the incinerator
Here comes another useless fool

You must always live in sin
You must never help the weak
You must never feel guilt
And you live in the sorrow
And you live in the pain
And who the fuck do you think you are?
Start up the incinerator!

Takk...
