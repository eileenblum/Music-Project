[Music by Nordavind '91]

Once upon a midnight dreary. while I pondered, weak and weary
over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore-....
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one, gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
'Tis some visitor' I muttered, tapping at my chamber door....
Only this and nothing more....

[Fretless Bass solo]

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
and each seperate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow... Vainly I had sought to borrow
from my books surcease of sorrow.... Sorrow for the lost Lenore-...
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore-...
Nameless here for evermore...
