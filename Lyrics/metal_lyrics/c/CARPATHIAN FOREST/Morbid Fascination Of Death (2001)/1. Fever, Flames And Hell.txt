On a battlefield up north
Tons of steel united in bloodshed
Sombre men of invisible might
The fallen snow covers
All the wounds of the earth

Slaves of restriction
Remains this skeleton earth
The dust kills all sound
We're sucked into a black hole
The eyes that watched
From the top of the hill
The eyes that capture human guilt

A stiff vulture claw shows the way
To a land of mist
To a land of war
Night of torment
Fever, Flames and Hell
In the cold grip of Armageddon
