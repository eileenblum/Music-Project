An evil face
The eyes so cold
The dark labyrinth of the human mind

Key to a kingdom
A world of bones
New revelation, anger is the fuel

I am a sinner
On the last dreadful day of judgement
Heaven
I unbind all spirits who
Abide this hole
In symbols speaking
I woke you from the deepest dream

Open the gates
Behold your sentence
In the sign of the cross
And the crown of thorns

The precious (human) blood
Burning holy tears
Lifetime sinner
Which saw his sign
But the eyes were cold
