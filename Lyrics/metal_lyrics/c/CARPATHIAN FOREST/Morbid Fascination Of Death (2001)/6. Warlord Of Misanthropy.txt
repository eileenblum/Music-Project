I have died from within
The beginning of an end
But I still stand
Seeing red
The anger made me strong

The vision was mine
Horizon becomes vast
Claim your throne
The fire turns to flames

I had it all
Before the fall
Warlords of misanthropy
Powers
Spiritual powers to foresee
Warlords of misanthropy

Warriors of the fall
Through sinful years
The hellish burden
That I was given:
