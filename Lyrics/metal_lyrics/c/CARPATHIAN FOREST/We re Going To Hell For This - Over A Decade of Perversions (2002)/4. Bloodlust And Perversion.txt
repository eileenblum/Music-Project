[text and music by Nattefrost '92]

Freezing rain pours down from
The clouds
Roar of a distant thunder
Awakes my thoughts
As we ride towards the
End of our fate

Our horse are carrying us
Through the winterland
Dark Medieval War!!

The mild breeze are getting
Stronger
My hands grabs the frosty
Sword
Through the vast winter
Landscape

As we enter the kingdom
Of the unknown
With hate, death and pain
Deceitful eyes!!!

War of chaos and thundering
Rage
Our hands are open to welcome
Their death

As our sharpened weapons
Collide
Into the battle we ride!!!

After the anger the silence
Began
And now, the cold night
Approaches
From the top of the winter

Mountain
To ride with glory and
Armageddish anger
With hate
