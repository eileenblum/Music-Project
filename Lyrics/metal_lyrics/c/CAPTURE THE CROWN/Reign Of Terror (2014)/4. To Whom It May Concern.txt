The hope. The dreams. You make the innocent believe.
The greed. The lies. How do you fucking sleep at night?
The shame. The hate. Apologies you've left to late.
You try to take this crown. Fuck off. You won't break me down.

There's so many times. You've stepped in shit.
You forged ahead &amp; found yourself. Stuck in this prison.
I refuse. I refuse to follow your path. Refuse to live my life by the lies you've masked.
Refuse to give into the words you asked. Fuck the words you've written.

You won't break my down.
Not with the back of your hand. I found the strength. To break. These chains.
You know I wont be caged. I'll bite the hand that beats.

You. You were my hope. You held my dreams. You make the innocent believe.
You were the greed. You told the lies. How do you sleep at night?
I'll stay away. Keeping myself safe.
I'll dance the night away. As you stand there out of place.

I was told. Show no trust in you. You'll only make me pay. If only I had knew. You'd tear away.
The hope. The dreams. You make the innocent believe.
The greed. The lies. How do you fucking sleep at night?
The shame. The hate. Apologies you've left to late.
You try to take this crown. Fuck off. You won't break me. You won't break me.

You. You were my hope. You held my dreams. You make the innocent believe.
You were the greed. You told the lies. How do you sleep at night?
I'll stay away. Keeping myself safe.
I'll dance the night away. As you stand there out of place.

Take a look at me now!
