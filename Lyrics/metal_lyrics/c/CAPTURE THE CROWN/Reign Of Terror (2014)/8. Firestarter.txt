Breathe in, breathe out.

Breathe in, breathe
OUT!

Burn [4x]

There is only so much I can reach out from the deep.
I never thought this could happen to me.
I never believed, weâll just have to see

SO

Breathe in, breathe out.
Breathe in, breathe out.

Iâve been to hell and back. [3x]

Can you give me just another day
and Iâll make it worth it.
You always get what you give, thereâs nothing more to say.
So tell me do I really deserve this.

Burn [8x]

The flames, they lick my flesh.
Tell me when is this my fucking day?
I pay for my sins, the hard way!

Can you give me just another day
and Iâll make it worth it.
You always get what you give, thereâs nothing more to say.
So tell me do I really deserve this.

How did this happen to me? [2x]

Hey, I donât wanna believe
You always get what you give
This is the reign of
TERROR!!

YEAH!

COME ON!

Breathe in, breathe out.
Breathe in, breathe

Can you give me just another day
and Iâll make it worth it.
You always get what you give, thereâs nothing more to say.
So tell me do I really deserve this?

(Whoa, whoa, WHOA!)
You always get what you give
[3x]
