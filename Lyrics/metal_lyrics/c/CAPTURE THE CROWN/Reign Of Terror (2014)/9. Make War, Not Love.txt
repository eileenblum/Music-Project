Three, two, one.

Go!

I can see no end, the legion is closing in.
What separates me from you is all but an open door.
This is the only way out.

Give up, give out, give in.

Drop to my knees, Iâll never.

Give up, give out, give in.
This is the fight youâll never win.
And I wonât let this go until you
Give up, give out, give in.

Youâve gotta give them the truth.

The world is vast, I bid you farewell.
The world is vast, Iâll see you in hell.

We are the evil, there is no purity.

Give up, give out, give in.

Drop to my knees, Iâll never.

Give up, give out, give in.
This is the fight youâll never win.
And I wonât let this go until you
Give up, give out, give in.

Youâve gotta give them the truth.
I might be the light in the dark, a calm in the storm, a hole in the floor.
I might be the knock at your door, the cut in your hand, you let me [?]

This is a war! [2x]

Give up, give out, give in.
Drop to my knees, Iâll never.

Give up, give out, give in.

I wonât let this go until you
Give up, give out, give in.

War! [8x]

Give up, give out, give in.
Drop to my knees, Iâll never.

Give up, give out, give in.
This is the fight youâll never win.
And I wonât let this go until you
Give up, give out, give in.

Youâve gotta give them the truth.
