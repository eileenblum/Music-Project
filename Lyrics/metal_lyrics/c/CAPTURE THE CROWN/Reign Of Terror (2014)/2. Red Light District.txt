Yeah

You fucking lied
Cut a hole in my chest
Pushed your fingers inside
I want to watch you bleed
Over and over
Rip these scars that were healing
Over and over
Again and again
I tried to mask all these feelings
Over and over
Again and again
You pushed me deeper and deeper
And now we've reached the end
Fuck

[Chorus:]
I, I just can't do this without you
I, I felt alive when I found you
I, I hope you know
This song is about you
Running away, running away

It's all it takes
For a person to break
Disturbed, infatuated
Reduced to filth
I might be the disease
But you were made to displease
I can't get enough of you

[Chorus x2:]
I, I just can't do this without you
I, I felt alive when I found you
I, I hope you know
This song is about you
Running away, running away

Is this what you want?
Is this what you want?
Is this what you want?
I said is this what you fucking want?
Well here I am

You brought this upon yourself
You brought this upon yourself
Listen
You brought this upon yourself

[Chorus x2:]
I, I just can't do this without you
I, I felt alive when I found you
I, I hope you know
This song is about you
Running away, running away

Is this what you want?
Then this is what you will get
