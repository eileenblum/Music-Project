Itâs been a long time,
I thought Iâd never see the day.

I got caught up in myself,
now Iâm left with memories
(I canât believe we)
I lost a friend
and thereâs no turning back
there was a sickness inside your head.

I canât pretend,
that youâre still here [2x]
but youâre gone!

I miss you [4x]

So take my word
Thereâs not a soul in this world
That could ever take your place

And as sad it is to let you go
I feel better that youâre not in vain

I lost a friend
and thereâs no turning back
there was a sickness inside your head.

I canât pretend,
that youâre still here [2x]
but youâre gone!

I lost a friend
and thereâs no turning back
there was a sickness inside your head.

I canât pretend,
That I was always there for you.
Now I am learning to forgive myself.

I miss you [8x]
