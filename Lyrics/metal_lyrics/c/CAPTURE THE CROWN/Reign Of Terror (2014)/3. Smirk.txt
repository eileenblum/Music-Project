Drifting from the route
Left for dead
Left to search within myself
Emancipation is my affliction
This heart feeds all my starved addictions
It's weakening but I like the taste
I like the taste
Digging deep inside
I'll wear me with pride
Have I gone too far?
Have I crossed the line?

[Chorus:]
You'll never know, never know
What it's like to be me
(Because I'm broken)
(Because I'm broken)
But you'll never know, never know
What it's like to be free
(Because I'm broken)
(Because I'm broken)
But I'm setting myself free

Free what you love
Free what you need
Fight for everything you believe
The road is long
You'll never know
Until you go you'll never know
What it's like to be
Be like me
Nothing is like it seems

You'll never know
Never know
What it's like to be me
You'll never understand

You'll never know, never know
What it's like to be me
You'll never understand

[Chorus:]
You'll never know, never know
What it's like to be me
(Because I'm broken)
(Because I'm broken)
But you'll never know, never know
What it's like to be free
(Because I'm broken)
(Because I'm broken)
But I'm setting myself free

[x7:]
Take

[x3:]
Break

Take, take, take
What is rightfully mine
And I'll break, break, break
Through the walls I've confined
I'm setting myself free from this
I'm setting myself free

[Chorus:]
You'll never know, never know
What it's like to be me
(Because I'm broken)
(Because I'm broken)
But you'll never know, never know
What it's like to be free
(Because I'm broken)
(Because I'm broken)
But I'm setting myself free
