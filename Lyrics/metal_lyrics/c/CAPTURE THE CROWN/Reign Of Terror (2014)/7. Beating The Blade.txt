I will never give up on you, I'll never, I'll never give up

This world it can seem so cruel and so vast

Your life keep looking forward not back to the past and
When times turn for the worse and you feel like letting go
Just remember

I will never give up on you
Remember, Remember the truth
I will never give up on you
Remember, remember, don't give up

Some days you forget to breathe
The times have turned for the worst
But let me tell you one thing,
There's more to life, more to life than this

I will never give up on you, remember, remember, the truth.
I will never give up on you, remember, remember, don't give up.

I want you to see,
yea yea

I'll never give up,
Because it's never enough,
It's never to deep,
For you to stitch up the cut,
And every time you say you'll never make it to the end,
Remember the truth because its you that I trust,
You walk so many miles,
All the water you tread,
Just remember all the times it was over your head,
And after all the lies you told the truth instead,
This is your life you should never have a single regret
Scream as loud as you can,
You gotta get up and dance,
Here's the moment don't let it go even if its breaking your hands
I'm never gonna lay down for the end,
I swear I'll die where I stand,
You gotta capture the crown and now it's your chance

I will never give up on you, remember, remember, the truth
I will never give up on you, remember, remember, don't give up.

Would you do the same for me?
Would you do the same for me?
Would you do the same for me?
Cause I'll always be there for you
