I am, my own worst enemy
Exercising the stimulation
Canât escape from the harsh reality
Iâve been relentlessly
Letting myself,
GO!

I can feel myself slipping away,
Itâs been a while since Iâve seen the light of day
One for every single pill that I take.
Iâll just take, till they take me from my bed and put me in my
GRAVE!

I donât need this, I donât want this.
I really need this, I really want this!

I donât need this, I donât want this.
I need to have it, I fucking need it!

I can feel myself slipping away,
Itâs been a while since Iâve seen the light of day
One for every single pill that I take.
Iâll just take, till they take me from my bed and put me in my

(Druggy moans)

(Itâs shit, itâs fucked, but I canât get enough.) [3x]

SHUT UP! Now put these voices to SLEEP!

(.......)
These are for my addiction
With every hit that I take
I thought his mind would come awake

I can feel myself slipping away,
Itâs been a while since Iâve seen the light of day.
One for every single pill that I take.
Iâll just take, till they take me from my bed and put me in my
Grave!

Till they take me from my bed and put me in my
Grave!
Til they take, till they take
Now put these voices to sleep!
