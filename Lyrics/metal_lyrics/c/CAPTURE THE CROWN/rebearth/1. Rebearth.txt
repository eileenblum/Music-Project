With the world at our feet
And the words in our souls
We could change the world
But we're comfortable living in a fucking hole

With the world at our feet
And the words in our souls
We could change the world
But we're comfortable living in a fucking hole

We all try to change it so easily
By stomping on the necks that need to breathe
We stick our fingers in their eyes
When they need to see, yeah

We stomp on their necks when they need to breathe

We poison the water
We drink but it tastes so good
We poison the water
We drink but it tastes so good

The architect looks upon his craft
Falling through his hands and says,
"I'm sorry. It has to be this way"
This is who we are
Not who we need to be

Throw away what you know
This world is a stage
So let's give them one hell of a show

Meanwhile the cities fall
The forests burn
The hate consumes us all
There is nothing left

Living in a fucking hole
But we're comfortable living in a fucking hole
Sing it to me

We poison the water
We drink but it tastes so good
We poison the water
We drink but it tastes so good
But it tastes so good
But it tastes so good

"I'm sorry. It has to be this way"
This is who we are
Not who we need to be

Throw away what you know
This world is a stage
So let's give them one hell of a show

With the diamond in the palm of your hands
Throw away what you know
Look past your own nose
This world is a stage
Let's give them one hell of a show
Hell of a show
Hell of a show
Hell of a show

There is still hope
But we're comfortable living in a fucking hole
There is still hope
Hell of a show
Hell of a show
Let's give them one hell of a show

This world could be so beautiful if we unite
