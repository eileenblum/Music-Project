Go! It's time we've realized fighting my eyes
With the sun, this insomnia is eating at my soul
and I got nothing left to show
This could honestly be a problem
I've had no sleep and it's getting hard trying to think
I haven't slept a night and I'm paying through the fucking nose
Try and wake me up, let me know which way the wind blows
Fuck what you said, fuck what you did, listen
All alone trying to read all the faces unspoken
In other words, must be broken
Hypnotize me, make me believe that this was all just a dream
I wish I was, waste away, wasting way
Spending all my time running these empty fucking streets
Watch me waste away, it's quite simply said
What's the point of a day. We are the walking dead!
Watch me waste away, all alone
trying to read all the faces unspoken
in other words I must be broken
Hypnotize me, make me believe that I must be dreaming
I wish I was, fucking oath mate, let me sleep!
