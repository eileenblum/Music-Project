We're lead to an end of our integrity
The cracks that have been brought upon ourselves
But most of all, and most of all
So what a way to waste a day with all these broken promises
I'll give back what you have given to me
so can you hear me? No, for I've given right back into what
you've given to me. How can you take and take
and sleep so soundly after all you've done to me
Now I see through my own eyes, and it's not because
and I'll give you and I'll give you what you want.
With all these broken promises, it's so hard.
I have heard those words before
so what a way to waste a day with all these broken promises
I'll give back what you have given to me
so can you hear me? No. You give me. Fuck you (all)
The night is sweeter spent alone (so much sweeter)
This night is sweeter spent alone (There's nothing left for you to change)
This is the end of you and me
There's nothing left of you and me. Fuck you!
