Strain
But I will strain the qualities I take on you
To be or not to be
Thy will not matter at the end of the day

Knock, knock
Who's there?
Well look who it is
An opportunity
Where'd you come from?
I been searching for years
To find a young ear
To wrap around my solidity
I've been...
I've been watching you from a distance
From a distance, from a distance
And now it's easy to see
You've always needed me
You've always needed that sense of character

I see all that you never did
Let them take you away
I believe that we've made amends
So take aboard what I've given you and sail away

What goes around comes around
An eye for an eye leaves everyone blind
To see
To believe
Is a start to a new beginning
Tear away all yesterdays
So breathe in and be out in a second
What goes around comes around

Your day will come
Your day will be bitter sweet

I see all that you never did
Let them take you away
I believe that we've made amends
So take aboard what I've given you and sail away

Your ambition is not a purpose
Your ambition is the light at the end of the tunnel
