Trying to comprehend,
Trying to understand
The gravity of what has happened.
Its so hard to say.

And life's just all a game,
And we're here to play.
But surely and slowly,
I think that this flame has burned out.

And I've seen what life does.
Don't remind us
That we can't rewind.
And I've seen skies turn to grey,
And I live life in hope
That I can prove to,
That I can show you
I'll be okay.

When I think, 
I'm thinking about all the times inside my mind.
And now I have no doubt
But you're departed,
And you've left me where we started.

Life's just all a game,
And we're here to play.
But now I think I'm losing.

And I've seen what life does.
Don't remind us
That we can't rewind.
And I've seen skies turn to grey,
And I live life in hope
That I can prove to,
That I can show you
I'll be okay.

And I've seen what life does.
Don't remind us
That we can't rewind.
And I've seen skies turn to grey
And I live life in hope

Hold on
Hold on
Nothing lasts forever
