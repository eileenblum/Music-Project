The World Ends Here

The World ends Here

How many times 
Have we been washed out to sea
Drowning and grasping for a breath of fresh air
It's hard to recognize the shores from the water 
I NEED HELP

[Refrain:]
I need help 
I don't feel real, today there's something going on upstairs
And it's not so easy when you're one and two with reality
And I'm trying to find a way back in 

This eats at me from the inside
This drives me to the point of peeling me fucking skin off
My chest beats out of place
And I don't whether today will be the end or a new beginning

[whispered]
Rage

Before I open the gates 
I will warn you
To find some shelter
To find some solace
As we march into hell
As we march into hell

[Refrain]

And I'm one two
With reality 
And I'm freaking out 
Someone please grab me I'm reaching out
Before I open the flood gates 
I will warn you
Find some solace

Oi, we done? NOPE 

RAGE
