It takes a big man to want to say
to want to feel just anything
I takes a big man to show you
They feel remorse for the shit they've put us through
But oh I want you to know
There's no forever and no way out
I can't believe that a certain someone could be so selfish
He wanted more so pull me up, grab me by the throat
Push my buttons like a remote
How can I say what I feel when I don't feel anything at all?
What's a dude gotta do to live up to his morals?
To show how he feels, there's no forever and no way out
This is not a test, although I think you've lost all your respect
Ha ha ha ha you beg forgiveness and I've had it up to here
I've had enough ha ha ha
This conversation is almost over
am I ever going to see the resolution?
Choose your friends ever so carefully
How can I say what I feel when I don't feel anything at all
What's a dude gotta do to live up to his morals?
To show how he feels, there's no forever and no way out
Have of taste of your own damn medicine
Wait 'til you see the mess you've made.
