[Bonus Track]This is a sticky situation, and I'm making no progress
This must be done all and only by me
So who the fuck are you to delegate and choose
what is best for me? I'll do this once and for all on my own
Hesitation, just grab the opportunity
What if your life was to change and you were made?
To change your way, come with me
Don't want to feel the same, this time is for real
My hopes, my dreams men nothing to you
At the end of the day, I'll do what I have to do
And after all these hard yards have been put in
I cant stand in these shoes, I'm making no progress
You can't hold me back anymore
What if your life was to change?
Keep your head up high, there's no time for goodbyes
Come with me, come with me, away.
I'm for real this time, so make your choice
Just make your choice!
