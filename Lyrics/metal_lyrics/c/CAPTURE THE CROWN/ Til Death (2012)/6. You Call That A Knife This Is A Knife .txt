Welcome to sin city bitches.
Please refrain from throwing your fucking body over the side
Fasten your fucking belts 
Because this is going to be a rocky ride

Youâre nothing more,
Than a self-centered whore.
Youâre nothing more,
Than a self-centered whore. 

How does it feel bitch?!

Iâd ask where youâve been,
But would you know where to begin?
Itâs time you had a change,
Because every night is the fucking same
Each time you go to bed you meet someone new.
I swear to God mate,
Who could think highly of you?

I could say youâre the only one,
Then Iâd be lying.
I could say that we are dead and done
But I know youâd only be crying.
Thereâs only so much I can do,
To try and fix you, to try and fix you.

Your time is up,
Look me in the eyes you slut
Your time is up bitch
You filthy fucking cunt
You filthy fucking cunt

If only you knew this one was for you
If only you knew..
Face down, ass up
Thatâs the way you like to fuck.
The way you like to fuck..
(fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck)

I could say youâre the only one,
Then Iâd be lying.
I could say that we are dead and done
But I know youâd only be crying.
Thereâs only so much I can do,
To try and fix you, to try and fix you.

[instrumental]

Heads will roll!

Open your eyes,
See the world,
Youâre not daddyâs little fucking girl.
Open your eyes,
See the world,
Youâre not daddyâs little fucking girl.
