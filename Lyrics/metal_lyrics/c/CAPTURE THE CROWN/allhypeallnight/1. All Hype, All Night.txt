All hype
all nightÂ 
it's friday nightÂ 
and the weather is good
my mates are on the way
I'm stoked because
tonight we're getting
fucking loose

dressed to killÂ 
walk right out the front door
my mom and dad yell
don't be home later than 4
sorry guys I've busted my assÂ 
at work all weekÂ 
and I deserve more than a few drinks

it's time to rage just fill up a cup
kiss the nearest personÂ 
just don't give a fuck
live a little, scream out your lungs
go hard, or go home
don't be a bitch cunt

don't think of tomorrow (think of tomorrow)
we're living for now
so rage, all night
let's go to hell on this town
staying up late, that's right
all hype, all night
staying up late, that's right
all hype, all night

drop a molly
climb a roof
pretend to fly
tonight will be the greatest nightÂ 
of my life
pop a bottle, smoke a bowl to this

this is every night we're young
this is the way we live
walk into the partyÂ 
there's not a soul to be seen
fuck I been pumped for this shit all week
bung as I'm losing sight
I close my eyes without a care
open them and there's people everywhere

don't think of tomorrow (think of tomorrow)
we're living for now
so rage, all night
let's go to hell on this town
staying up late, that's right
all hype, all night
staying up late, that's right
all hype, all night

here's to you
you're true blue
you're a piss potÂ 
through and through
you're a bastardÂ 
so they say
you tried to go to heaven
but you went the other way
you went down
you tried to go to heavenÂ 
but you went the other wayÂ 
so get downÂ 

(you've got to fucking fight
for your right to party
I'm not fighting for shit)
