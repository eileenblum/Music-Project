Through the eyes
Of the alleys we're made up

And through the eyes
From the alleys
We're made up
I can see the world
For what it really is

Excuse me
If I'm mistaken
But these walls
I'm afraid
Time, doesn't mean anything to you
Are you listening?

I'll say it once, I'll say it twice
I've always told you
I just want to be where there's something bigger
And I just want to see the real world
Was this a waste of my time?

Hats off to you
Hats off to you

Hats off to you
For what you've done
You try to leave
But your plans we're injected
So I make the mistake, this time
Everyone else take a worry
Insert you go
Everyone else, everyone close
