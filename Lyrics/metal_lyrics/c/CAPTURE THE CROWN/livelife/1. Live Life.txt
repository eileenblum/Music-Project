I saw you. So live your life.

Living on this dragging ocean we are in this alone.
In this moment we're untouchable. Take it down, this is our word.
[?] to give it up, to give it up, to give it up, you dumb fucks.

If you want to be likened to me then I'll gladly touch back.
Turn back the rocks are tied to your feet [?]
If the world is your oyster then I'll do what I can
to join your fucking house and leave you alone by yourself.

Without a doubt, we're singled out.
They, they never said this will come easy.
Take my hand and just believe me.
Live your own life.

Is it a crime to say,
all I ever needed was something to call the truth?
I was grown up on the ground of something to get me through.
This ink was crafted by the tragic you all keep.
Welcome back back back back to the farm you fucking sheep.

If you want to be likened to me then I'll gladly touch back.
Turn back the rocks are tied to your feet [?]
If the world is your oyster then I'll do what I can
to join your fucking house and leave you alone by yourself.

Without a doubt, we're singled out.
They, they never said this will come easy.
Take my hand and just believe me.
Live your own life.

We all are one, but we are not in need. [x3]

We are equal, we are marching mind.
Right here, right now.

I'll say it every fucking night.
I'll say it every single fucking night.
