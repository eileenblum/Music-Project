"Always behind while building to none
Behold a beginning that's swept up in one
(twisting in pair)
Magnificent minds and the furious blind
Tremble in calm for the days left behind
(within...meridian's tear)"

Born from disease, misled to echo
Shaping delusions while memories grow
Filled with the sense to follow the cast
But blessed with the will to raise ill of the past

Trained by the word and hand to complete the strand
Encircled by a frame to abide the name

In every face lies the presence of one
In every voice cries the answer to come
Within the language of time, form, and thought
Replies the aware of what has been taught

Guided by a reason, to become or to betray
Embodied to a boundary that's inner tides turn to portray
For every word that bleeds to beg, to vow, a plea to be
A cross to bear for a life chased but never free

From zero to end lay the stain of bonds left to mend
A subtle decay for the faith that remains of the day

See the shade
Of a wordless being, forced into seeing
Trace the way
Through inner resign and endless design

In every choice lies the presence of one
In every breath cries the answers to come
Within the language of time, form, and sound
Betrays the aware of what has been found
Behind the seasons, an end to a change

(see the shade Where wisdom is broken of a wordless being forced into seeing,
Within the language of all that can be trace the way
Replies the unspoken through inner resign and endless design)
