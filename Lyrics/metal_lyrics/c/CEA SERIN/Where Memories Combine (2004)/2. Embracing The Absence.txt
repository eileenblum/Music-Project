Brazen and benighted, all glaring turned to high
Beautified and battered, vast hallowed limbs are shattered by
Praises...presumptions, these naked words do build upon
An ever changing affinity, brought to light by this breaking dawn

Lured into a deep regression, stifled in repose
But slowly this torrent with black lights enclose
Banished breaths and enraptured eyes, wrapped and wrung to white ribbed skies
But failing...failing to turn the wise

Barehanded bereavements enfold as one
While colors collapse and briskly bow undone
Untouched designs resign unbound
To further spill between the time of no sound

Lured into a deep oppression stifled in repose
But slowly...slowly these garish lights enclose
Banished breaths and enraptured eyes, wrapped and wrung to white ribbed skies
But failing...failing to make more the wise

Faced by none
The climax in question's begun
Beyond the pale of self decay
The widowed will cease to obey

Fixed on the heavens that split in two and rescind
Look to the other with sense and will shared in mass

(faced by none)
(beyond the pale of self decay)
