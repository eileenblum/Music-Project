[Bonus track]

I press the temple of your name
With folded hands and bended shame
And every begging thought's obscured and cursed into the heavens

All my life spent in doubt
To bleed my freedom out
All this time spent in vain
In search of reasons

Sanctify my soul, satisfy my needs, numb my beliefs
Cast this servant down
Whose last words ring in righteous sound

Drifting through a pale life
Owing down the sacred
Until I'm caught between the black and gray
Do I turn forsaken

Take my hands away from me
To ungrasp heresy
Bless my cries with guilt and shame
For spiritual treason

Sanctify my soul, satisfy my needs, numb my beliefs,
Cast this servant down, whose last words ring in righteous sound

Where is your god tonight?

In my hour of self inflicted fate
I'll trade my words for a touch of sudden faith
(your hope, your trust, your life dies with me)

(your will, your dreams, your light dies with me)
