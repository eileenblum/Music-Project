Upon a rock I find my stance
with vain image my mind in trance
I gaze down cross the florid vales
to lift myself on timbered gales

So I sweep down to drink of my wake
in a languid glassy stream
which flows to the grand blue lake
where I swim to inner theme

So easily closed - my inner faces exposed
Frames of changes hold slow
to fear me, to judge me, to know

Throwing my unity to the wind
I step through aeons in an effort to transcend
Searching the lines beyond all I have to ask
I gently fly my Illumination Mask

Down past the arbored way
my diverse charismas writhe
In antimasque they sway
to visualize my different sides

In a world of appearances I separate myself
to find my youth I unveil truth
and drink of innocence

So easy to hide - true emotions divide
Frames of changes hold slow
to fear me, to judge, me, to know

Throwing my unity to the wind
I step through aeons in an effort to transcend
Searching the lines beyond all I have to ask
I gently fly my Illumination Mask

Throwing my unity to the wind
I step through aeons in an effort to transcend
Searching the lines beyond all I have to ask
I lay to waste my Illumination Mask
