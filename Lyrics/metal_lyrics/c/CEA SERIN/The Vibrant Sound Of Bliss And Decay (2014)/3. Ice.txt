[originally by Sarah McLachlan]The ice is thin, come on dive in
Underneath my lucid skin
the cold is lost forgotten

Hours pass, days pass, time stands still
Light gets dark and darkness fills
my secret heart forbidden

I think you worried for me then
The subtle way that I gave in
But I know, you liked the show

Tied down to this bed of shame
Tried to move around the pain
but oh, your soul was anchored

The only comfort is the moving of the river
I enter into you a lie upon your lips
Offer what you can I'll take all that I can get
Only a fool here

I don't like your tragic sighs
as if your god has passed you by
Well, hey fool, that's your deception

Your angels speak with jilted tongues
The serpents tail has come undone
You have no strength...

The only comfort is the moving of the river
I enter into you a lie upon my lips
Offer what you can I'll take and take
only a fool here to stay
only a fool here to stay
only a fool
