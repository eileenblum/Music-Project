The blackened wraiths are gone that settled half past dawn
Their earthen feet move slow to regard their words of woe
On and on the door insists to thin the room as time persists
And idle lives can now reclaim their rightful place away from blame
of the parents that hold a frame
of a child to rest they've lain
and the son who's left alone
to wonder when she's coming home

Oh how mercy slept behind the rail from which she leapt
Passive by the daze beneath he stare
that graced a flight to open air
(a wish to fail)

Now in plain sight to all
was a word behind her fall
and a secret that she kept
in spite of how the banister wept

All these crimes that brought me to this day
were marred as moments of abject hearsay
All these nights of sleepless thinking
I've run from the light behind the innocence veil
and the wail of impunity that was riddled by scale
Then one night of labored dreaming
I heard the voiceless mass that were teaming
In our space of arduous paths
the mask of idolatry was lifted by an enemy
the lines ran black and framed my shadow half

Hold on to these
Breathe in, release
Remains of the day
Reflects what falls away
In all we see
And all we speak

It's 3pm again and silence fills the den
A lonely figure sits with a stare
of the notes that should be there
From the things she used to play
that he'd wait for every day
A life led in quiet (resigned and uncertain)
A line left of perfect

Oh he called her name out
as he rushed to fix her hair
Inside a mass of splintered cedar
on the marble by the stairs
One mind only spoke of life in regret
and gains at what cost
while wrapped up in distractions
he let her get lost

What need be in all we see
is a value that we pay for what falls away
Time's lone pace will blur her face
and each thing has its day
for what falls away

His mother knows that he can't understand
how things end and why the broken parts can't seem to mend
What you missed can't be found on my walls or in pages
While you were gone I poured my soul into the darkest of places
You kept your eye on the surface
Beguiled by the wit of my smile
I suffered gladly in the still of my style
The plane of want
subdued and gaunt
I feared the first step taking and reached back in a moment of waking
