[Step 1: Misery of Submission]

Inhale the fabric of the gods to live their dreams
Walk the powdered line
Inspire death with a single breath
Blasphemy and blood mix like a toxic kiss, such familiar bliss
Her face was freed from my arm
Elated in vermillion charm

Look down upon salvation
Stare down at what is killing me
In one euphoric moment
I'm blessed by the touch of faith

Holy Mother
I'll give my life to bleed you
Holy Mother
Just one more rush to see you forever...forever...forever

[Step 2: The Chemical Christian]

Leaning to a new light in my chemical conversion
I spill her face again to feel that sweet perversion
Take me with carols and make my heart silent
Show me a promise to stir with the timeless

Look down upon salvation
Stare down at what is killing me
In one euphoric moment
I'm touched by the face of faith

Holy Mother
I'll give my life to bleed you
Holy Mother
Just one more rush to see you forever...forever...forever
