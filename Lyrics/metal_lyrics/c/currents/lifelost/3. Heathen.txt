Who are you to judge the person I am?
When you look at yourself,
Thereâs nothing of a man always on his knees.
I see the lies embedded in sin.
Cast down from the sky into a hell within foreign tongues.
Forsaken me to hell for what we believe.
We are the begotten for what we cannot see.

We cannot see.

This is what we deserve.
We are the black sheep of the herd,
Preparing the purge.

I see the lies embedded in sin.
Cast down from the sky into a hell within foreign tongues.
Forsaken me to hell.
We are begotten, tormented, forgotten for what we believe.

The church is a lie, but that doesnât mean that what I believe is not the same as you perceive.
Youâre all cowered in fear, force fed lies. Heretic, where is your mind?
Walk down the line. Face your demise.

Do you see yourselves always on your knees?
Blinded by a church who forces you to believe.

Fuck.
