Iâm staring at the sun
Wondering where the time has gone.
Cause I can honestly say that the way I feel
Is something more than I have ever felt before.
I can never find the words to say
How much I care,
And never do enough to try and make you aware
How much you really mean to me.

Loveâs a funny thing;
It creeps behind and turns your head to a window.
Becoming tongue-tied too nervous to look inside
Because you canât believe your eyes.

I donât know where to turn,
But like a child chasing the sun,
I felt its rays kiss my skin.
Iâm not afraid of being hurt again.

Holding her in my arms is where Iâm meant to be.
As everything fades away and itâs just her.
See, love's a funny thing,
It traps you inside,
It holds on tight,
And never lets you go.
Cause these past two years I have lived in fear.
Been through hell and back and tried to disappear.
But when I woke up,
I saw you standing there and I was so starstruck.

Iâm hoping one day Iâd get lost in your eyes.
Let the whole world disappear.
I hoped that one day Iâd get lost in your eyes.
Let the world fall apart at our feet.
Iâm staring at the sun.

You see, love's a funny thing,
It traps you inside,
It holds on tight,
And never lets you go.
Cause these past two years I have lived in fear.
Been through hell and back and tried to disappear.

But when I woke up,
I saw you standing there and I was so starstruck.

Iâm staring at the sun.
