Who the fuck have you become?
I don't know who you are anymore.
Selfish, a liar, a fake,
A person I hate who is bound to his fate.
What has happened to my son?
Please tell me, where has he gone?
With the light taken straight from his eyes,
This path you have chosen is one I despise.
You're not the son that I've raised you to be.
You're pathetic and weak.
The world isn't yours,
It owes you nothing for what you've endured.

Can't you see?
You're not the son she wants you to be.
You're pathetic and weak.
Why can't you see? Why the fuck can't you see?
You're breaking your mothers heart.
Breaking her heart, you're breaking her heart.
Can't you see you are breaking her fucking heart?

If you saw the world through my eyes,
You'd feel the constant pain.
Ignorance is bliss so keep assuming that I changed.
Open your fucking eyes.

I am proud of who I am.
Why can't you understand?
I hate who you have become.
You are not my son.
What makes you think I'd believe in you?
Everything you do is far from the truth.

But I am wrong.

I often wonder from the edge of my bed to the depths of my head,
âWould I rather be dead?â
Making friends with cement,
Wondering where it went wrong.
Fuck everything you said.
Fuck everything that you said.

Can't you see I am breaking your heart
For being alone?
I'm breaking your heart
For being my own.
I'm breaking your heart for being strong.
I'm breaking your heart, for being a son.

Bastard, please tell me where have you gone.
With the light taken straight from his eyes,
This path you have chosen is one I despise.
It's clichÃ© to say that I hope and pray that there will be a day
You'll come back and say you are proud of the son I became.
