[feat. Ricky Armellino of This Or The Apocalypse]Welcome to hell.

I am the one who is bound to chains,
Forced to live my fucking life as a victim in pain.
Thereâs no escape. Get out of my head.
I would rather be dead.

Anxietyâs a fucking disease; itâs tormenting my every thought.
Thereâs nothing left of me.
I spend my life begging on my knees
For someone to end it all and forget everything.
I am the one who is bound to chains.
Forced to live my fucking life as a victim in pain.
Get out of my head. When will this pain ever end?
Just put a gun to my head, cause I would rather be dead.

Stop your worship.
Stop fucking around.
You will never ever ever make it out.

Don't ever lose hopelessness. [4x]

I got a heart that feels like it's a broken neck
All the time.
You stay on your side of this motherfucking line
For all time.

I am the one who is bound to chains,
Forced to live my fucking life as a victim in pain.
Get out of my head. When will this pain ever end?
Just put a gun to my head, cause I would rather be dead.

Anxietyâs a fucking disease; itâs tormenting my every thought.
Thereâs nothing left of me.
I spend my life begging on my knees
For someone to end it all and forget everything.
