I canât explain what all of this means to me.
The sound, the feel as it vibrates everything.
Iâm getting lost in my mind swinging back and forth to something I canât describe.

It consumes my life and I wonât let it go.
It is everything between you and me.
Thereâs nothing that can take it away,
As I close my eyes and begin to dream.
Letting the melody take me away, itâs going to take me away.
I lose myself to the sound of every note lifting me from the ground.

I am free, and no one can take that away from me. [2x]

It consumes my life and I wonât let it go.
It is everything between you and me.
Thereâs nothing that can take it away,
As I close my eyes and begin to dream.

I can feel it. It just takes me away.
Something I live for, I let it dwell in me.

I canât explain what all of this means to me.
The sound, the feel as it vibrates everything.
Iâm getting lost in my mind swinging back and forth to something I canât describe.

It consumes my life and I wonât let it go.
It is everything between you and me.
Thereâs nothing that can take it away,
As I close my eyes and begin to dream.

It is all I see between you and me 
It takes me away and sweeps me off my feet.
To a place where I know, that I am home.
I am free.
