Eternal sleep.

Iâm digging my nails as hard as I can.
Over and over again, ripping the pain from my skin.
Will it ever end?

A drone, no past, no future lost and alone,
I can't even tell who I am anymore.
To shut my eyes and to never be seen,
What the fuck is happening to me?

Between two entities, holding onto the edge,
I don't know how much more I can take before I fall and descend.
Whispering in my ear,
âNo one will miss you, just disappear.â
I'm choking on my words, as my body grows numb.
Iâm trying to scream at the top of my lungs.

Lay me six feet deep in eternal sleep. [2x]

Eternal sleep.

Wrapped in soil, soaked in tears, I am a product of fear.
Trapped inside a mind I can't control,
Contorting mind body and soul.
I'm trying to scream,
But no one can hear
The fears in my head
That have brought me to tears.
Will it ever end?
I'm begging on my knees
Cause I want to believe.
But Iâm too blind to see that itâs not God but the devil answering.

His hands around my throat and I can't breathe, I cant fucking breathe.
I'm screaming.
Lay me six feet deep in eternal sleep.
