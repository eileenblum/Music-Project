I feel your pain, this sensation is no stranger to me.Â 
It has encompassed the person who I used to beÂ 
Yet you show your face, while the rest cower behind their prideÂ 
We Are The CrucifiedÂ 
We Are The CrucifiedÂ 
But never forget, you are not alone.Â 
I bare no mark of a man, forcing my eyes to see that this life, isn't real.Â 
Each day is a tragedy , that I could never escape.Â 
Each day is a tragedy , that I could never escape.Â 
I wait to hear the words.Â 
How much longer must I wait for this life cease.Â 
To fall asleep forever, and never wake upÂ 
I hide my pain for this is who I amÂ 
This is who I am, Crucified.Â 
We are the Crucified.Â 
But there are those who share your pain.
