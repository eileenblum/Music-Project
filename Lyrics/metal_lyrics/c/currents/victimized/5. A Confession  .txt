Whenever, I think about the times that we used to share.Â 
A tear begins to shed, as more follow in its place.Â 
I put my hands up to my face.Â 
I am soaked in disgrace.Â 
Left to wonder why, left to wonder why.Â 
Why you set a divide between you and I.Â 
What we had we will never get back.Â 
What we had I will always want back.Â 
You've tossed away the key and all the troubles with it, it seems.
And you've moved on to bigger and better things.Â 
With the memory of a person you will soon forget.Â 
Along with the smile from the day that we first metÂ 
All I want is to hold you in my arms again and tell you the words that I've wanted to say.Â 
But that day seems so far, more like a dream that has come and gone.Â 
I want to believe that you'll wake up someday and seeÂ 
That I was always there for you even when you turned your back on me.Â 
The imprint of what we had will always remain in me.Â 
Even though we have grown apart this confession to you means everything..Â 
There's not a word I'd take back.Â 
Nothing more I would do.Â 
Than have said these three words.Â 
I Loved You!
