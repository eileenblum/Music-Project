No words can describe this feeling .Â 
But this three word phrase I have come to repeat.Â 
Is not enough..Â 
I'm surrounding my mind with these thoughts of you.Â 
It is in everything that I see, a mirror image that is staring back at me.Â 
It is in everything that I see, a mirror image that is staring back at me.Â 
Each and everyday I am counting away, til the day I have until I have to see your face and say.Â 
This is my life and I want to see it through.Â 
I want to see it throughÂ 
I want to see if through..Â 
As if everything was meant to be.Â 
I cannot escape what has become of me.Â 
But it will never take it's hold, it will never take it's hold and let me free..Â 
This is a bond that will never be tornÂ 
We are an undying flame, that will always burn.Â 
We will never be torn.Â 
We are an undying flame, that will always burn.Â 
But through this journey I have lost your hand.Â 
I know that someday soon, you will understand.Â 
That we were meant to be.Â 
I'll keep fighting for you.Â 
I'll keep fighting for you...Â 
No matter has been doneÂ 
This is truth that I have known all alongÂ 
Since the day that we metÂ 
And until you return.Â 
This is my, My promise keptÂ 
A promise meant for you.
