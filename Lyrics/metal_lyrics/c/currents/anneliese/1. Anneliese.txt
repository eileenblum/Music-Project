Open your eyes...Â 

...to witness the truth
an eternity of casting in the shadows all alone.

I am not here
I am not here

Nothing more than an illusion left in the back of your mindÂ 
but i never leftÂ 
i never left....

Creeping into your thoughts, I become nothing more than a dreamÂ 
as the days grow longer and nights get colderÂ 
you begin to fallÂ 

I creep in the depthsÂ 
never to be seenÂ 
You will become who you were meant to be
I am the nightmare that keeps you awakeÂ 
playing tricks on you, made to believe that nothing is wrongÂ 

Dragging you down into the depths
we have come to claim your soulÂ 

Your salvation is deniedÂ 
death has comeÂ 
so embrace meÂ 
and descend.
