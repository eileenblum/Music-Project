I cast aside faith; you see these hands are trembling so why push me? I can't be bothered being everything that you need
Always on about making the right choice, but how should I know when I just can't stop what I've pushed away for way too long, the path I know is gone.

I take this pain as if I could wake up, say I'm done. Brush it off and forget it.
My mind is stuck. I bring the worst out within myself. There's too many nights I've been kept up that I've had enough. Don't tell me that I think too much.
And I've never felt so out of touch.

Pull me away from my pain
I can't stop this hate [2x]
I can't stop the shaking and can't stand the sight of my face
I can't stop this hate [2x]

I pray to be back to days where there was substance, I can't forgive these feelings that I hold inside, they destroy me. No matter what I say, I still feel this fucking hate.
Nothing gets past you, or so you think. Always putting your faith where it shouldn't be. So you can pull the claws out from under my skin; I won't let you in. I don't want you in my head.

Wrong from the start, I see right through. Everything you hate in me will blow right back on you.
It's taking over all of me. And there goes all the progress that I've made.
It's taking over all of me. And there goes my progress. I'll never leave.

Pull me away from my pain
I can't stop this hate [2x]
I can't stop the shaking and can't stand the sight of my face
I can't stop this hate [2x]

I take this pain as if I could wake up, say I'm done. Brush it off and forget it.
My mind is stuck. I bring the worst out within myself, there's too many nights I've been kept up
that I've had enough. Don't tell me that I think too much.
