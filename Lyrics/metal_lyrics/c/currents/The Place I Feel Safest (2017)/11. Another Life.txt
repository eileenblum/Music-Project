You felt the slow-motion dream
You knew the consequence
A quick fix, you're worry-free
What's the difference?
A pierce of the flesh;
You sealed her death
It should be you who's not breathing
You felt the slow motion dream
You knew the consequence
A quick fix, you're worry-free
Floating on top of the world as her soul leaves her body
I feel something change in me.

You made your bed, always strung out, and ignorant. Living in excess only to be suppressed.
You'd be surprised just how fast your life can turn around. You try to run but it's too late to take it back now.
You think you've seen it all? You think you've seen it all?
You're just in time to watch the whole thing fall.
You're just in time to take the fall.

In death, solace follows.
The final product of your mistakes. The dream is dead, another life laid to waste.

In testament to your failures.
The final product of your mistakes, another life laid to waste.
She wasn't a saint but you still pulled her in, you still held her so close to your heart, now you say that you weren't involved and that's the way things ended up, it was never enough. Now you're left to wander finding no solace inside a broken world.
You're a subject to your deceit. I won't let you get the best of me.
You're a subject to your deceit. I won't let you drag me down into your misery!

You say that that's the way things ended up, it's never enough. I bet it's hard to be a father when you're always out shooting up.
If you ask me, I find you fucking disgusting, it's not worth remorse or saving, you're a subject to your deceit.

If this is how you wanna live your life, then understand that you won't survive to see a second of peace inside this sick, sad world of your own design.
Desensitized.
