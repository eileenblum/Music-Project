My friend, your will is weak. I know one day, you'll be scared of me.
My problem is you don't understand that this is how I'd rather live my life instead.
You and me, we're exactly the same. I hope one day, you believe it.

Always seen as the second best. I always thought it was a test, but it's a matter of respect. And you have none for me; you'd rather see me fail than have me under your wing. You were the man I could never be. Why'd you leave so suddenly?

Every second's a loss, I've failed you the same. Compassions gone for me, no more settling.
Somehow I still feel so broken, at the sight of myself at the edge. You will never let me go and never let me in.
You won't break me. This isn't worth all the effort and suffering.
You don't care about anything I need, leaving you abandoned is my best memory.
I know one day, you'll see we're the same. I know one day, you'll resent what you have come to be. [2x]

You were the man I would never be. Why'd you leave so suddenly? [2x]

Every second's a loss, I've failed you the same. Compassions gone for me, no more settling.
Somehow I still feel broken, at the sight of myself at the edge. You will never let me go and never let me leave.
You've mistaken my love for a weakness. I won't let you just take advantage of my heart. Have we mistaken our pride for our progress? Do we accept and learn from mistakes? I won't be the same. I will not relate.
You can push me off day after day but you can't expect me to stay. You've mistaken my love for a weakness.
Forsaken.
You were the man I could never be, why'd you leave so suddenly ?
