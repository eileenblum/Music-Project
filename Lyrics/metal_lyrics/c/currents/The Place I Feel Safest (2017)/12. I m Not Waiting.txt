It's coming down on us all
time to watch the world fall
as we sit on the sidelines, all our pride is gone
But we can crush everything we've set in motion
if we choose to make a change.

Instill in me the death of thoughtlessness, take out the sickness. I wanna find something much
bigger than me. This feeling of darkness tears me down; living life under a black cloud. Through self-destruction we'll resist,
We can be bigger than this.

It's time to wake the fire in me. Nothing here on earth can hold me down, here on earth we stand our ground. I just can't help but be ashamed that we didn't take these steps in the first place.

So I refuse to live this life and have nothing to show, I'm sick of watching it come down and holding onto hope that someone else is gonna save the world. It can't wait, but we can fix it with the choices we make.

This is home and I can't let it go but it's dying slow. If we don't stop, we'll let it go up in smoke.
I can't just stand idly by and watch it die. It hinges on the next move, we can turn this all around if we chose.
So I'm not waiting for you.

Can't see the future, but I refuse to stand on my knees, so I'm not waiting for you. It's up to us to change the problems we see.

It's on me [3x]
Can't see the future, but I refuse to stay on my knees.
So I'm not waiting for you
It's on me [2x]
It's up to us to change the problems we see.

That sinking feeling in my head; this planet's slow and painful death. I try to put it all in perspective but I can't. Our world has gone to shit and we just sat there and we let it tear to bits.
