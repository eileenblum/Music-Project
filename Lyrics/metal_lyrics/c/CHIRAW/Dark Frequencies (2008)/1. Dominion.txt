As I walk this long road
Justify my intentions
Redesign my inflictions
What is left, what's left of me

My shattered dreams
All bruised and broken

Is this my only way out
Left for dead, beat down and destroyed
And as I die, will I be remembered
Now I'm alive, I won't be forgotten

Within strength you'll find salvation

Unknown this path I'm walking
Unsown these fields of gold

Redirect my intentions
Reclaim what's rightfully mine

Let the fire consume, let the water wash away my pain
Come and wash it all away

Arise inside this is the second coming
You came to leech, out of reach this is my domain
Dominion
