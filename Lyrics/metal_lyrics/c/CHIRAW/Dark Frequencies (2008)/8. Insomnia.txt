Insomnia
Fuck you you bitch, get out of my head
I'm twisting turning dying
Lying here thinking of all that you said
Fuck you

I will not surrender
You won't take me alive
Forever is waiting, engulf me in sleep

Calling out to you, follow me
Let me stay here for a while

Escaping erasing this torment inside
I'm twisting turning dying
Blocking memories replace them with pride
My pride

Insomnia
I'm still awake
Insomnia
As I lay down

This state of bliss I so desperately miss
This is what you show me
This state of bliss I so desperately miss
Peace is what you owe me
