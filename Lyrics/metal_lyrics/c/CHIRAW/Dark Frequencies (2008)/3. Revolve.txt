Tomorrow will I forget yesterday
I wonder what tomorrow brings today
Come what may

As the sun sets prepare for a new dawn to arise
Elimination of the old day, this thorn in my side

Can you feel this, will we ever know?
Just believe it, the day will start anew
Just believe it, that hope will see us through

Wait for me, 'cause I'm not ready to go
Shine for me, 'cause I've got so much left to show

A long road, 24 hours to go
Will there be meaning?
