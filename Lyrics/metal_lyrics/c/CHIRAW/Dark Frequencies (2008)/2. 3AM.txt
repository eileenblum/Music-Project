All my malice, will tear you to pieces
Transformation, will soon be completed
Drifting away, your soul is mine to rape
Drift away

Reality has caught up with you
Didn't see the signs in front of you
Domination is upon you
I'll take hold and never let go

Now, you know definition of power
Now, you know the true meaning of strength

Open eyes, still you can't control
Victimized, swallowing you whole
Come to find, there's no U anymore
Step aside

A fallen angel with rust on its crown
Fear from below, I've clipped of the wings
Don't tell me you've had enough
Don't you ever tell me to stop

I'll take hold

My power devours

You're about to feel what you've become
Screams in vain, I've just begun

My power, I will devour you
