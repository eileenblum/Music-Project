If you play with matches
You're gonna get burned
So close to the flame, so close it fucking hurts
Fueled by rage, powered by desire
Unleash the pain before it expires

Trauma accept closure

Always the feeling that something is missing

Confide in me
I will not disappoint you

Fine on the outside
Bleed within

Surpassed by devastation
I'll dig a deeper hole
The birth of a new sensation
Will take a stronger hold
Fueled by rage, powered by desire
Unleash the pain before it expires

Trauma accept closure

Always the feeling that something is missing

Confide in me
I will not disappoint you

Know my name, fear my thoughts
Know my name, fear me

Two years of wondering what life could be like, if I were with you
If there was any chance would I take it?
And when all is said and done, are we still the same?

Confide in me
I will not disappoint you

Know my name, fear my thoughts
Know my name, fear me
