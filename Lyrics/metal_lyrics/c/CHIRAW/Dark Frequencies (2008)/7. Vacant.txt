Without a care I was brought into this world
With a vacant stare I'll leave to the next
As I try to reconnect my life's interrupted
Every time it puts me to the test

This life, overrated suffocating
This life, overrated intoxicating

Just point the finger at yourself
Nothing left inside it's an empty shell
Projection of rejection, my souls dissection
When will I ever be at peace

This life, overrated suffocating
This life, overrated intoxicating

Take this life from me, take it all away

See me crawling, I can't stop falling
Weakening

You complicated me, everlasting misery
You complicated me, I'm cold inside

This life, I should be hating
But I'm not fading
