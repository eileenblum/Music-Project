All I want is for you to see
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
In the end it'll be OK OK

Serpents kiss venomous
The way you feed on my emotions
Take this poison out of me of me

Compromise refuse to try
Live the lie inside inside

Penetrating mind fuck
I lost myself along the way
I carved your name in my heart forever

Sick and tired of apathy
I want to live feel loved again
Kneel down before me
Two faced, you snake

Compromise refuse to try
Live the lie inside inside

Final solution

Break the cycle and weep no more
