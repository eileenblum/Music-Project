As the demons speak the angels whisper
The ground breaks, heaven is silenced
Behold the beautiful eclipse
Here stands a blackened soul

Always the urge, always the wanting
It never ends
It never mends

What once was red, now black instead

Betrayed by destiny, as I follow the spiral
Follow it down

Scratch the surface, reach inside
Return to me illumination
Behold and stare with wonder
Blank eyes no sign of light

Behold the beautiful eclipse

See how a man could change
From this to nothing
Evaporated by fate
