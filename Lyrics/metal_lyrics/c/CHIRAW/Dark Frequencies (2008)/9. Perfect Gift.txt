Devotion

Loveless, lifeless
Results into numbness
Once clutched within my hands, but the grip wasn't strong enough

Is this the final hour? Am I to far gone?
Will I ever receive the perfect gift again?
Is this the final hour? Am I to far gone?

Questions remain unanswered
Can't kill what cannot be found
Can't sedate what keeps resurfacing
I am hell bound

Is this the final hour? Am I to far gone?
Will I ever receive the perfect gift again?
Is this the final hour? Am I to far gone?

The only truth I have to face
Is this possession, no reconnection
For this road that I have paved
Is turning into quicksand day by day

This isn't the way I envisioned it
It wasn't supposed to end

It was my gift to you
