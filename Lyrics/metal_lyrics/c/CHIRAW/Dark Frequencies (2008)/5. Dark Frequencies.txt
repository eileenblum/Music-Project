Misery loves company, and so I sit here with you
To steal the light from your eyes
Misery kills company, this glitch is taking over
Waiting still for your last sigh

Engulfed by dark frequencies

Contemplate to saturate
Hope replaced by failure
Getting thought of grandeur
Mutilate and evaluate
The skin is getting colder, as I wait for you to die

You look so jaded, now that you're fading
Come on fade out with me

All within my might, god is not here tonight
Call it what you want, possessed psychotic
Dark frequencies

Yeah it's over now, you're lost in me somehow

God is not here
