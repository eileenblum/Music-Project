Searched for a leader
An undisputed ruler
The one responsible for the energy
Unholy unions
Clashing of titans
Our own undoing lies ahead

I am the destroyer of all
And this Armageddon bears my name

Recur, revert
Our return to the energy

Beyond reasonable mind
Whirlwinds of mistakes
I set the stage for damnation
An end to creation

Now we will cease to exist
We will be no more

As we stand on the edge of oblivion

Lay down and pray
Pray for preservation, pray for tranquility

Once I was so much better than this
What has happened, how could this happen
I've lost myself along the way
Fuck, what have I become
