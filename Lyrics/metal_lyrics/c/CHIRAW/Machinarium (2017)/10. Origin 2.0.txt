Free from strain pain and consequences
Paved ways to unite us all
Disassemble and reassemble
Until all is right and pure again

We are the answer
We are the way

This is the anthem for all
Those who seek to unite
As one
Let this be the moment
We ascend and move on as one
Ascend through unity ascend and dominate

The time has come for the righteous to prosper
All the sins washed away
This is the time when we'll all be synchronized
Cerebral unity

Push pull down and redefine
Breath in out and realize

We will improve what makes us move away from sanity
Improve the core and make use of our abilities

Origin 2.0
A new world order
