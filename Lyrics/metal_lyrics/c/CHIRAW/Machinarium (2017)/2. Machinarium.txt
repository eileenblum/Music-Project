Pave the way for future generations
Decipher an endless design
Accumulate and gain all the answers
We must control
Coincidentally or meant to be
You decide, what you believe
Faith in humanity what does it all mean

What makes us human?
What makes us who we are?
Will we ever find a way?
To learn just who we are?

Unknown

Unlock shackles once bound
The keys are thrown in front of us
Unveiled new ground
Gain control
In this facility of divinity
Recreate the steps of purity
Lash out to infinity
Ambient

What makes us human?
What makes us who we are?
Will we ever find a way?
To learn just who we are?

And we will find a way
Find the answers find a way

As we strive for perfection
And demand the best results
To eradicate all doubts, of our existence
We. Will. Succeed.
