Weary and unaware, I open my eyes
As I stumble and fall
I try to make sense of it

What have I done....

Is this the price we pay, for our indifference?
We've dug our own graves

Pieces of what somehow resembles me of something human scattered on the floor
Signs of what used to be civilized shred to pieces
It's tearing me apart

Tell the world
That I never meant for it to end this way
That I didn't know that this was the day

Questioning reality
Or all that seems to be

It's crawling in my skin, something eerie resides in me
How could I have been so ignorant to think that this would actually work.
Events occur with a catastrophic detail that wasn't foreseen
Reality fades and blurs, I've officially lost it

The day the sun died

Tell the world, I am the disillusion of mankind
And I regret nothing
