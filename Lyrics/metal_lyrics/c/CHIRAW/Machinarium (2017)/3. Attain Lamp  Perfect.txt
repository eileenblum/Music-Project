We're about to reap what we have sown
Confined answers are finally known
Peeled the layers, wiped away the dirt
Orchestrated and organized we move on

Move on towards the understanding of all
Move on towards perfection
The endless possibilities await

No toleration of weakness
No stone left unturned
No excuses, no half measures
Only greatness will suffice

Obtain the final answer
Attain and perfect

I was meant to divide and conquer
Every obstacle in my path
Through grotesque and colossal movements
You will know my name

I'll transcend

All my life I've been waiting for this
And nothing will take it from my grasp
Realizing it was I and I alone
I am a god among insects
