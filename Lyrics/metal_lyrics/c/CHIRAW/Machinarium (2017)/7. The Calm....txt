I don't know if anyone can hear this
But I want you all to know that this was never intended to happen

Unforeseen circumstances drove us to the brink
And I fear that there is no turning back

I however will do everything in my power
To restore and rebuild what's been destroyed

To whom it may concern forgive me
I was not aware

Breathe in breathe out, but don't improve what we know

Breathe in breathe out, and don't forget what we know

I do ask forgiveness, father I have sinned

Though your non-existent I do pray you'll let me in
