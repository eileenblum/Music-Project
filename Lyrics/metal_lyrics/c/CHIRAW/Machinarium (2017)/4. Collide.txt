Black out the sun
Let darkness reign
Revealing substance from deep down within
Collide and research that which breaks away
Finally leading to our decay

Scratching and clawing and tearing away
Disrupting the fabric our reality

We start to see it come down
As we stop and stare
We start to see it crumble down
Collide

Progress formed by devastation
If only we had known
The sum of it all is our penance
A price to pay for all humanity
And as we stop and stare and wonder
Where to go from here
Horizons are torn asunder
And logic disappears

We start to see it come down
As we stop and stare
We start to see it crumble down

Spiraling into the void
Thrown away and all is null
We'll stay preserved

Misguided souls beckoning
A way out of here
'Cause this is the reckoning
We've been led astray

A chaotic turn of events twists our minds
We begin to see beauty in suffering
Beauty and suffering

Spiraling into the void
Thrown away and all is null
We'll stay preserved
Thrown away
And fear the shape, the presence
We've lost all control

Be mesmerized by it all
In and out surrounded by matter
