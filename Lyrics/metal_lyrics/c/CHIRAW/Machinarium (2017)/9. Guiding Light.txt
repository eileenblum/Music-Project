Suddenly we are right where we need to be
Consciously we are one, and all are free
We can finally stop running
These quests are over

Freedom

Through all the smoke and the fire
We have rebuild
Though all the anguish inside us
We have prevailed

Welcome
To this new haven
A guiding light to shine for all

I see everything through different eyes
The colours are mine once again

Integrated

The wait is finally over
And we are whole again

Escape this grim and black present
Together we march to the future

We march as one come on down and take hold
Future alignment is here as foretold
