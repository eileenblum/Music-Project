We walked the line, and that line has been crossed
We went to far now we find ourselves lost
Lost to the void of an intricate structure
Cut straight from reality

For a new solution, we must rectify old mistakes

Go on
The night is darkest before the dawn
The light that touches will take you home

So now we've come to the realization
Overwhelmed we start to proceed
To lead the way for purification
Recreate balance

When we go from non existing
To existing once again
The lessons where learned

This second chance earned

Crushed and destroyed, this hell we leave behind
Fear and doubt replaced by neon

Yet so much remains, locked away and undiscovered

And so it ends
The search for forgiveness
Finally we found
The essence of existence
