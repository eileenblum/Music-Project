Fuck you you bitch get out of my head
Twisting, turning, dying
Lying here thinking of all that you said
Fuck you

I will not surrender
You won't take me alive
Forever is waiting
Engulf me in sleep

Calling out to you
Follow me
Let me stay here
For a while

Escaping erasing this torment inside
Twisting, turning, dying
Blocking memories replace them with pride
My pride

Insomnia I'm still awake
Insomnia as I lay down

Calling out to you
Follow me
Let me stay here
For a while

This state of bliss
I so desperately miss
This is what you show me
Peace is what you owe me
