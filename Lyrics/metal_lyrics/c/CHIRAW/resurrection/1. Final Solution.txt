All i want is for you to see
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
In the end it will be OK (OK)

Serpents kiss venomous
The way you feed on my emotions
Take this poison out of me (of me)

Compromise
Refuse to try
Live the lie
Inside

Penetrating mind fuck
Lost myself along the way
I carved your name in my heart (forever)

Sick and tired of apathy
Want to live, feel loved again
Kneel down before me, two faced (you snake)

Compromise
Refuse to try
Live the lie
Inside

Final solution
Brake the cycle
And weep no more
