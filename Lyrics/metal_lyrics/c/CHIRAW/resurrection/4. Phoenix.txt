So pure once
Now completely soiled
All that once was
Is now forgotten
My imprisoned soul
Four walls standing tall
Faith is the only way out

Passion love hate
Erase

Conflicting
Inner turbulence is rising
Fire
From the inside
Is there another way
To reflect
Constant continuing
Thoughts of neglect

Passion love hate
Erase

Remember the fallen tears
Let them guide me home again
Remember all those years
Erase and start anew again

Resurrection!
