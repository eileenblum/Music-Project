Shed my skin and reveal
Would you suffer
You can't fucking break me
I'm to stubborn
My sins my flaws
I will repent
Constructing this entity
Into a legend

There is no justice only pain
Only the strong will remain
For those who fall we will seek
And lift them up to lose the weak

As you reap what you sow
Realize what is known
The truth is existent
The lie is invented
Your sins your flaws
You will repent
And now your suffering
Becomes a legend

There is no justice only pain
Only the strong will remain
For those who fall we will seek
And lift them up to lose the weak

All will know
You reap what you sow
