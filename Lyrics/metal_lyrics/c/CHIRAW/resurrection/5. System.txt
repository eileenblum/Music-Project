As we proceed, we leave what is left behind us
Moving forward to the next level
Evolving into something new
Never looking back, no regrets
As I stand here and face tomorrow
I know my time will come
'Cause these are the golden years
And it's my time to...

Let it go!

I tell myself it will be OK
I won't go down this way
You fuck it up that's all you do
Lying that's all you know

I will bleed for you
As long as you want it
I'll bleed myself dry

Would you bleed for me?
Would you beg me please?
Would you turn around?
Would you strike me down?

Fuel ignites the flame, burn it down
Incineration, system overload

Liberation
Liberate me
