I find it imperative I say something you'll cherish
In fear there's no other chance past here
I ran away to escape a routine now it seems I'll never make it back
No matter where I rest my head for the night, you're resting in my mind

When no one else would listen your attention was consistent
I just want to hold on to the best thing to fucking happen to me
Maybe this is more than you asked for, maybe this is more than I can handle
I can't remember the last time that I held on so tightly

Maybe look a little closer. You'll see the change I want you to see in me
Maybe wait a little longer. You'll see the person you're wanting me to be
Just wait for me. I can be who you want me to be
Please wait for me

Just promise me if I fall back asleep, you'll be there when my eyes open

To be clear on what I'm saying, I just hate to keep you waiting
But nothing is changing for now
For the first time in quite some time, I'm holding myself accountable
I just want to be reliable

I've let you become a part of who I am
But if you can't wait for me just know I understand
