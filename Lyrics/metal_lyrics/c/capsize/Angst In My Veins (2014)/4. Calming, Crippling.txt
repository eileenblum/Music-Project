Burn. Please. Burn. That calming crippling

You can't afford to hit that peak of rage again
So just take another hit
The only thing that's calming me is fucking crippling
But I need that numbing to breathe
Another dollar down the drain, another problem paused for now
But what did it really solve? I don't want my mind involved at all
I'm losing regard for myself. I'm losing track of all my thoughts
I needed something to erase the moment, something to carry me away

I don't want to be stuck in this reality
I lie motionless, drifting in and out of the colorless walls closing in on me
I want to drift away and let my mind fade to black
Fall into nothingness, 'cause there's nothing left
No chance to catch myself when I'm heart set on escaping
Never had a chance to catch myself
I don't want to be stuck in this reality
I lie motionless, drifting in and out of the colorless walls closing in on me

Burn. Please. Burn. Breathe it out, sink and let it numb me
