Three minutes left, the clock clicks toward your final breath
Now what's on the line is what you will say for the thousandth time
Close your eyes and wait patiently. Recall back to apathy
Love wilts and the flower dies. Forever never had a place in me

You wanted something, something for nothing
Would life be good enough to set you free?
You wanted something, something for nothing
Would death be enough to let you sleep?
You wanted something, something for nothing

It won't be getting easier
The light in me is fading dimmer
Was I good for this? Me and life seemed to never fit
Were my intentions considered in the way this played out?
Or am I just filling in another grave? Did I take enough to even the score?
Or did life just run its cycle on another number

You wanted something, something for nothing
Would life be good enough to set you free?
You wanted something, something for nothing
Would death be enough to let you sleep?
You wanted something, something for nothing

If you could see what I've seen you wouldn't question me
Don't question me. Don't you fucking question me
