I'd rather not be seen again
I hate the air I'm breathing in
I don't want to be
alive anymore
You'll never hear from me again
When it's all brought to an end
It's all brought to an end by me
For you

I'm more deserving
of the damage I'm causing
And you deserve to feel alive
No end to regret
From the selfish decisions
And there's no turning back from this

I backed out
And you were backed into a corner
But I've been running so fast
That I can't look back

So aside from what you're thinking
This is what I'm feeling
I just wanted the best for you
But this is what I had to do
So aside from what you're thinking
This is what I'm feeling
I just wanted the best for you

I'm truly more alone than ever before
That broken home stole my soul
And I hit the road

So watch me tear myself apart
like I've do every day

I wouldn't have it any other way

I tried to talk to god
Fell asleep by the phone
And never got the call

So now I'm screaming at god
Is there a purpose at all
Should I expect anything more than this

So aside from what you're thinking
This is what I'm feeling
I just wanted the best for you
But this is what I had to do
So aside from what you're thinking
This is what I'm feeling
I just wanted the best for you

I'll take the blame
If it'll fix the bridge I burned that day
I'll take the blame
Let the all weight
hang off of my name
I'll take the blame
put that smile back on your face

I'll take the blame
