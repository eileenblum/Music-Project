When life unfolds and you're still all alone
Your life spent chasing a home
No place to feel safe, no place to be
When there's only one person that looks out for me

Desperate, just to move another mile
Hold on, 'cause we could be here for a while

But I cant be here too long
I must keep moving on
And I'm always racing the sun
But I feel I'm sinking faster
So I've stopped asking questions
'Cause I know there is no answer

Just a bastard child with no where to run
The short end of the stick lead to the end of a gun
Abandon me, the same routine
'Cause there's no more room in your heart for me

Desperate, just to move another mile
Hold on, 'cause we could be here for a while

And all the people,
All the people around me look down on me
I know I'll never,
I know I'll never be what you fucking wanted to see
The perfect picture,
The perfect picture painted in the back of your mind
Don't say you're listening,
Don't say you're there for me

Drown in the fear, sink in the guilt
In this hell, in this hell I have built
