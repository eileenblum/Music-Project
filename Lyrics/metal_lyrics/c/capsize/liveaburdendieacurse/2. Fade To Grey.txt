Everything changed
I'm breathing after all, just waiting to wake up
But I'm still left shaking
Is this a dream or is this real
Still lost in question
Of what to feel
Tear down the walls
Or build them taller than ever
I'm still lost as fucking ever
Everyone I know is changing
My life is rearranging
Please take me far from this place
To never return

Building bridges over mental scars
Our lives could end tonight
Give me the comfort to still feel alive
Building bridges over mental scars
Our lives could end tonight
Give me the comfort to still feel alive
I'll never feel alive

Catch these dreams of failure
and give warmth to my white knuckle fears
Tones of grey
Shade the days
I'm getting past the moats I've dug into my floor

Just wake me up, 'cause I can't take this anymore

And everything I question
Just confuses me so much deeper
Oh, will the answers
Become clearer?

So we forever anchor our ankles,
Let us drown in love.
