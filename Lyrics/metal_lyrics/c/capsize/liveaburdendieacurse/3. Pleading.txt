And I scream,
As tears pour from my eyes
In hopes you can relate to the pain inside
Some people live their whole lives
Afraid to remove the masks
That have become their faces
But we're forced to find comfort in unfamiliar places
Approval of this world, means nothing to me
I'll turn my fucking back to everything
I'll turn my back to everything

Don't let the love disappear with the sun.

As the night falls I follow in motion
I'm on my knees like a broken man,
'cause now I'm feeling broken, man
Your face was the light that shined,
But only in the darkest times
There's just no sinking when you've hit the bottom

It's hard to accept that there is this little feeling
In a room that's filled with human beings

I can't be the only one
Willing to tell the world I will not die proud of what we've become

But I'm done wondering
What happened to that passion and melody
When we felt free
But I can finally see
That's there's no room left for me
And you're not worth my pain
Your eyes are open but your mind is shut
It was me that dug this fucking rut
Please take me away from here
There's no saving me
I hope that I have made that clear

If this world is stage, then the curtains are closing on me
They're closing on me

I can't be the only one
Willing to tell the world I will not die proud of what we've become
