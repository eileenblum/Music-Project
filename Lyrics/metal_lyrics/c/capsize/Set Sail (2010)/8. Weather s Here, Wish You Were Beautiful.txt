A year spent tied down to the shackles that kept me restrained from getting the most from my life. But this feeling of discontent is where I find my comfort. Easy to accept, when pain is consistent. Love is struggle, when you hand your heart to a closed hand.. 12 months wasted, I still donât understand. All I ever gave you was all I ever had. And open arms just to fall back on, still you were nothing but a broken promise. Tell me when your idea of forever turned into Iâll never have your heart. Whatâs left when all I have to give isnât good enough? Without your voice here, December is colder. Iâm done, waiting a fucking round. Iâm done, for you to come back around. Donât want to see your face ever again. All I have left to give you is a page scratched with angst. So now Iâm left asking, did you ever even care? Iâm so sick of feeling let down, every time you werenât there. And now I fucking wonder, would anything have changed your mind? Just help me find an answer and Iâll stop wasting all your time.
