Youâre all the fucking same. Day to day, holding hope tight. And still, nothing changes. You all stand and hope waiting for a brighter tomorrow, when today just passed you by. And it feels like everyday is darker than the last, well Iâm not living in the past. But this depression is all Iâve ever known. And hating you never gets old. I donât want to live, I donât want to live another day, with you fucking pretenders. You make me fucking sick. You bunch of fucking pretenders. You make me fucking sick. Canât stand another wasted night. I wonât live another wasted life. Tell me why I should try to make change for a world who never spared me a thing. Tell me your idea of what needs to be done. Tell me when you think the war is won. In a town full of fakes, no one left to believe. When will I get my relief? Youâre all the fucking same day to day still holding hope tight. And still, nothing ever changes. Nothing ever changes. And still, this path I keep treading, with all of these words said. Moving on is all I have left.
