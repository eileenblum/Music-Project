So much lost time, so many wasted years. Searching for better things but thereâs nothing to be found here. And everybody questions why they cant find the time to smile. In a world where everyone shops for status, happiness is lost in the isles. And when your self worth is only your possessions it wont be long till all you own is your own depression. Everyone need something, something to hold on to. But all Iâve got is this music that no one understands. Everyone has something, something to hold on to. Well, all Iâve got I the music that no one under stands. Quick to judge, quick to turn away. And so Iâll scream, since no one cares what I have to say. The world around me is filled with nothing but a fucked up society. Iâll tear past it all in hopes to find a better place for me. I watched the rise and fall. I watched it die.
