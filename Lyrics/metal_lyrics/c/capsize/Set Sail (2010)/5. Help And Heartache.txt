Everyday I tried to help. I saw hope they said you couldnât. You turned away, ignoring me. Now youâre thinking thoughts you shouldnât anymore. What am I here for? Itâs not for me. Why the fuck canât you see? Everyday shit got worse. Losing friends, they dropped you first. You asked for my help but wouldnât listen, turned your back on all the advice given. And itâs all just a slap in the face. I hope this song makes your heart race. Forget I said anything. Your life, your way. All you ever say. Your life, your way? Well now youâre living far from your dreams. This is me letting you go. Forget I said anything. This is you living far from your dreams.
