Can you relate to your heart losing density? The feeling of your heart sinking. Everyday I bring myself face to face with these questions: How could you have done this to me? How could you have done this to us. So many promises I held so tight. Promises un-kept. Promises you broke that night. You were handed the heart of a broken man in hopes you would be the answer to every worry he ever had. But itâs all meaningless to you. Itâs all meaningless to you. Can you feel the pain one bit? Or does it reflect off your insecurity driven excuses? Iâm sick of spending every midnight clenching to the roots of my own hair. And killing myself on the inside because you werenât there. My heart wont be given away ever again. You fucked it up. This was your last time. You fucked me up. Iâm letting love die. Broken hearts. Weâre drowning in our sorrows tonight.
