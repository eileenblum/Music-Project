It seems these days anyone who ever heard anything about anyone thinks they know about your whole life. It gives me reason to take a step back, with assumptions made without the cold facts. Stay the fuck away. No one wants you here. Stay the fuck away. No one likes you anymore. Fuck your status. Fuck your crew. Itâs people like you that shows have to lose for the scene to improve. No one cares where you came from. No one cares where you have been. When you show no respect for the city you live in. Iâm trying to forget it all but I canât escape these judgmental walls. You make a stand for what? Nothing but a hypocrite piece of shit.
