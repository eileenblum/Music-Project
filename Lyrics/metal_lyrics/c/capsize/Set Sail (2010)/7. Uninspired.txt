Is there anything left, worth fighting for? These days have got me wondering, what the fuck is a bright side? And is there hope? Or are we destined for pain our whole lives? I pray one night Iâll be able to fall asleep without wondering if Iâll wake up tomorrow. âCause fear has been riding my coat tails for the last 20 years. So loud I sing, is there anything worth fighting for? âCause all I ever see is the same bullshit attack our lives over and over. So loud I scream, is there anything left to believe in? Weâre searching for answers without knowing the questions. Iâve yet to go a day without being uninspired my the failure that surrounds my life. Iâve yet to go a day without being uninspired by the road blocks invading my life. Itâs time to turn, turn the tables on this fucking world. Give me something worth dieing for. This world wonât break me. This world canât break me. No one can save me.
