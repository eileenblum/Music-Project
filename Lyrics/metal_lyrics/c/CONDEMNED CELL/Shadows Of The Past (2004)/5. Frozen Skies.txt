Nothing holds me in this world
Now I'm not afraid to die.
I do not want to suffer more
How I want to be free!
My blood is mixed with dirt
My heart beats with pain.
Battlefield is full of corpses -
I'm so alone among them...

In the end of hall of pain
I see the burning bridge of hope,
I see the broken maze of faith,
I see ecstasic dance of the Death!
My blood is mixed with dirt
My heart beats with pain.
Reality slips away
Under these frozen skies!

Noise of battle has died for me
I look through the frozen eyes of the skies.
Slowly Death is coming to me
And I'm not resist - how I want to die!
My blood is mixed with dirt
My heart beats with pain.
But soon I will leave this place
Shadow of Slumber is covering me!!!
