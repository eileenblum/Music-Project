Under the arches of the ancient church
I'm standing between the holy walls
I'm seeing the priest in front of the altar
Praying for our sinful souls
But can you hear his words, when you're dying alone
Can you her the god, laughing at your naiveness
The church has forgot you - it needn't you now
And you'll die in your bed insulted and helpless

Praying for rescue-working so hard,
The blind religion - the faithful heart.
Asking Jesus to realise your sins.
Ok! Heaven awaits you - let the show begins!

Praying the icon, praying the doll
Funny stupidity or the naughty insanity
Bloody sacrifice for our god
That's our church - blackened reality!
Welcome to fire-fair inquisition
Here's the witch, raped by the priest
The witch tried to tell you the hidden truth,
Oh, that's not a truth - that's a pagan filth!!!

Praying for rescue-working so hard,
The blind religion - the faithful heart.
Asking Jesus to realise your sins.
Ok! Heaven awaits you - let the show begins!

Take our prayers, father; this victim is yours now
But the sorrow still remains
We know the truth
That's not a truth, created by the god
That's truth born in our minds
But the primal faith has taken our minds forever
And we're a primitive sheep
Capable only for instinct life.
