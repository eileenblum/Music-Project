Give me your hand, now our quests begin,
We need to clean our minds from dust of grief.
Turn the key, and time will be frozen.
Let's follow the way, that we have chosen.

Knife in my hand that is a key.
My flesh is door, that opens only once.
Escape from pale life
To the world of our dream...
We'll open new horizons
When old ones will be cleared...

Don't say, what you want. Don't say what you need,
I know chains of this fucking life hold your breathe
Rise from your knees, you know you can do it.
Chains of life - we can remove it.

Knife in my hand that is a key.
My flesh is door, that opens only once.
Escape from pale life
To the world of our dream...
We'll open new horizons
When old ones will be cleared...
