The night falls, I'm left alone in my house
Only dismal rain knocks at the windows
There's no anyone near-only silent shadows
The silent shadows are calling to me...
I'm listening to the singing of trees
I'm watching the dance of shadows
But there's none, who believing me
That they are livin' in my house. Shadows...

Left alone with my frayed destiny.
I'm slowly going insane...
I hear the voices behind the door
Concocted voices, but so real pain!

Candle burns... Time's fading away,
And I see the emptiness in my life
They're calling to me, I hear them everyday,
I hear their voices laughing at my cries!

Illusions and the fear
I cannot calm myself.
Only the voice, speaking from the past,
Sweet past that I have dwelt
Sometimes I remember my father
My childhood, my friends -
I feed the sorrow on my memories -
Sorrow, that will never end.

Left alone with my frayed destiny.
I'm slowly going insane...
I hear the voices behind the door
Concocted voices, but so real pain!
