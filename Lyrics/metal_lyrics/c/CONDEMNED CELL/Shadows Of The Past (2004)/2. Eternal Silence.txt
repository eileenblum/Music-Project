I cannot sleep, I'm afraid my dreams
I lost my hope, but I found the fear
Praying alone-can you hear my screams?
Can you hear my voice, speaking somewhere near?
My best friend are my hateful enemies
My cold flat's bleeding loneliness now
Only small pieces of my broken destiny
Are fallin' into my mind, falling deeply down...

I knew the people, who's loving me
But when I've needed the help, they've left me alone!
I knew the friendship so true and real
But when I've needed understanding - my friends have been gone!!!

Die! I must die... None is carrying about my life,
No reason to live-only madness and lie,
Just eternal silence in my mind.
Welcome to my blackened world
The endless circle of my morbid thoughts,
Silence is near, silence I've called -
And no need to live - my future is lost
