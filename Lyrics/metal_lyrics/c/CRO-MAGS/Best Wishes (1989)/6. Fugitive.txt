In this lifetime I know I found what's real
So hard I try to control my mind
I'm coming back, coming back
I feel it in my heart

I know I lived a life of strife
And this could be the last chance in this
Ad I know I got to change my ways
I know there ain't no compromise I can be livin' a life of lies
Life of lies and I know I gotta change my ways

Time's gonna get you got you it's creeping up on you
It's time to do the things I've always known I had to do
I try, yes I try, how I long to be with you again

In this lifetime I see you everywhere
The pleasure and pain was all to my gain
I tried so hard looking so far
My faith this is my courage I must go on

I call to you savior of my soul help me please
I'm just begging to see the line that's drawn
Between the good and bad
And I know I've got to change my ways
When I recall the things I've done

I can see I was completely mad
I know I cannot change my past
But with you I could change my destiny
How I long for you to set me free
