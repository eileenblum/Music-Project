God has taken me for a life of crime
Misery and suffering and losing my mind
Trying to succeed but I was so very blind
There's no material pleasure that can satisfy time

Serving my sensed with no hesitation
Never even thinking of my situation
Been smashed so many times and it made it so clear
That I was only living in illusion and fear

It's time to advance towards a spiritual state
Instead of serving your senses falling victim to fate
The strength is there inside you, it's never too late
So don't be lead astray by illusion and hate

I'm telling you, you gotta believe in him
Nothing else can save you, open up your eyes, see the light
Hear the truth, nothing else could set you free
Be brave, be strong, you can't go wrong
Be brave, be strong, you can go on
