I'll never forget when I looked in your eyes
My destiny unfolded to me
You tucked my soul, delivering me
From all of my pain, setting me free

I know I lost control, my mind was in a rage
But then you came to ease the pain
You are the only one, who makes me feel this way
This is not hard for me to see
The only one who makes me feel this way

When I hear your name there is no more fear
You're in my heart this is so clear
They'll be no more pain, once I join you again
I'm begging for you, to pull me through

When I hear your name, just your name, when I hear your name

I won't forget the way I felt when I first looked in your Lotus eyes
For the first time in my life I could see what I must do,
I need to be with you, yes you, you are all I need
Your everlasting love for eternity
You are the only one who makes me feel this way
This is not hard for me to see
