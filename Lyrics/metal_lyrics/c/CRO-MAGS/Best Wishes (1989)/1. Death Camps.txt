The organized slaughter of the innocent
Can't you see this is a hellish state we're in
No sympathy in their hearts at all
At the death camps in our midst

Execution without a trial
Think about that for a while
The day they're doomed they're doomed to be killed
So your foul desires can be fulfilled

Execution without a trial
No regret for life at all
Meat hooked conveyor belts line the walls
Don't it remind you of Buchenwald

You don't even see the genocide
I can see you only care for your own hide
And because of the ignorance that clouds your mind
You've left your compassion so far behind

You don't even know what it involves
Because you never see the bloodshed on the walls
Conditioned since childhood kept you from the truth
They just go on lying and poisoning the youth
It's time to be intelligent and open your mind
Reach within yourself and see what you find
Do you really wanna be responsible
For the brutal slaughter of the animals
