Ignorant fools don't believe in the truth
They are doomed to live in illusion and fear
Cut loose the doubts that arise in your heart
The time of redemption is near

Now in these times of frustration and anger
We've come out of the darkness that kept us blind
With the torch and wisdom and the sword of knowledge
We'll leave the corruption behind

Gotta kill, gotta fight, gotta crush Demoniac
Gotta wipe out, gotta destroy, gotta crush Demoniac

Demoniac reigns in their hatred and anger
And all of the sin that they bring
In the lie that "true" happiness can be found
In the pursuit of material things

Polluting our minds and corrupting the masses
With pride false attachment and greed
We've seen through their lies and there's no compromise
We know that it's time we were freed

The Demoniac who are lost in themselves and have no intelligence
Engage in unbeneficial, horrible works meant to destroy the world

No we won't, no we won't, no we won't ever serve their demands
Cause we know, cause we know, cause we know the Lord and his plans

Gotta kill, gotta fight, gotta crush Demoniac
Gotta kill, gotta fight, gotta crush Demoniac
Gotta kill, gotta fight, gotta crush Demoniac
Gotta kill, gotta fight, gotta crush Demoniac
