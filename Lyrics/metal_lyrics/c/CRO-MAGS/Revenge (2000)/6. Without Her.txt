Everyday and night
I walk these same old streets
Nothing seems the same without her

Sleepless nights
Days of misery
When will I learn to live my life again?

Everyday and night I think about her
Everything I see reminds me of her
And every night you know I dream about her
My life feels so incomplete without her

All I (all I)
All I wanna know
Can I ever live without her?

All I (all I)
All I wanna know
Can I ever live without my baby

Everyday and night I think about her
Everything I see reminds me of her
And every night you know I dream about her
My life feels so incomplete without her

Everyday and night
I walk these same old streets
and nothing seems the same without her

Sleepless nights
Days of misery
When will I learn to live my life again?

Everyday and night I think about her
Everything I see reminds me of her
And every night you know I dream about her
My life feels so incomplete without her

All I (all I)
All I wanna know
Can I ever live without her

All I (all I)
All I wanna know
Can I ever live without my baby?

All I, all I
All I wanna know

All I, all I
All I wanna know
Can I live without her?
