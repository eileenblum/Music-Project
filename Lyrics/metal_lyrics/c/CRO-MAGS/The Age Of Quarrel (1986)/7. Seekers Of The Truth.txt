Wasting my time serving my mind
For sense pleasures I can find
Gotta get back, back to the truth
You know it was left behind

It's so easy to see, if you wanna be free
Don't wanna be just a slave
'Cause no matter how you choose
You know you'll lose
If you ain't looking for the truth

Searching and searching for something real
You gotta know how I feel
'Cause we been looking after the truth
Rejected those lies of our youth

You've seen the proof
This ain't no spoof
They tried to bend the truth
And we won't regret the things we met
If we're on the path of righteousness

Now we gotta, we gotta go back
Something ain't right so we gotta, we gotta go back
Trace our steps and see what we've done
It's time for us to go back to square one

You just can't seem to see what I mean
You know what I'm talking about
'Cause we been in bondage much too long
Don't you think it's time to get out

See time has taken it's toll and they're in control
We can't let this madness last
Gotta make our move
Get in the groove
We gotta do something fast.
