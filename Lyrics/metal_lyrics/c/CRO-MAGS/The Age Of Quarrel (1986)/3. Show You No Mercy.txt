I tried to stop myself
Told you those games ain't good for yourself
Gave you advice 'cause I thought you could hear
Better listen closely 'cause your end is near

Won't show you no mercy at all
Gonna kick you, kick you when you're taking your fall
Won't show you no mercy today
Gonna hit you, hit you when you're moving on your way

Put you in check 'cause I thought you were my friend
Sorry it had to come to the bitter end
Just like a blind man you can't see
Better move along and just let me be

Don't come to me for no sympathy
You won't get none here
Just leave you in fear

Won't show you no mercy at all!

What does it take to prove you were a fake
I thought so anyway,
Won't show you no mercy today!

Won't show you no mercy at all!
