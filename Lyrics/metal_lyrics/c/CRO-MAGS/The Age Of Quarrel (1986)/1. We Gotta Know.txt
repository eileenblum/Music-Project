Struggling in the streets just trying to survive
Searching for the truth is just keeping us alive
Gotta break these shackles gotta break these chains
Said the only way we'll do it is if we use our brains
Said there's gotta be some meaning to the purpose of life
I know there must be more than the struggle and strife
'Cause I'm looking for the answers and
I need a clue
'Cause my mind's so disturbed now what do I do?
Notice everywhere there's mass confusion and packs of lies
We gotta know!
We're staring down our enemies in the eyes
We gotta know!
These are the days of the cheaters and the cheated
We gotta know!
But we're not gonna bend you know we won't be defeated
We gotta know!
'Cause my minds so disturbed now
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I do?
This planet's turning into a hell
And I figured out that things don't really look too well
Reactions coming they're already starting to show
But the question is who'll go with the flow
You know there's gonna... be a fight
'Cause somebody's always trying to keep you... from doing the right
There's always gonna be somebody coming no matter where you go
So now you know why we gotta know
