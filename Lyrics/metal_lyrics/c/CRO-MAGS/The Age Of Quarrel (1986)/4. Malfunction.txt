I just can't get through to you
Despite all the ways
I try or any of the things I do
Maybe I'd be better off talking to a wall
'Cause you ain't making any sense at all

I'm walking and I'm talking
And I'm trying and I'm lying
But I just ain't getting through to you!
I'm walking and I'm talking
And I'm trying and I'm lying
But I just ain't getting through to you!

Am I just wasting, just wasting all my precious time
'Cause I ain't wasting a breath on you or any of your kind
If you had any brains you would open your mind
But, I guess you're juts afraid of what you're gonna find

I just can't get through to you
Despite all the ways
I try or any of the things I do
Maybe I'd be better off talking to a wall
'Cause you ain't making any sense at all

I'm walking and I'm talking
And I'm trying and I'm lying
But I just ain't getting through to you!
I'm walking and I'm talking
And I'm trying and I'm lying
But I just ain't getting through to you!

It's a malfunction...!
