Why you messing around with me
Pushing me around
Values changing
But I can't get caught in it today
We won't lose with what we've got
'Cause we'll just sit and watch it all rot
Keep your ideas
But keep your distance from me
Keep off my back cause the things you do
I don't wanna see
I don't wanna see
Wanna see how far I can go
Test my patience see what I know
Just not happy with nothing to do
Getting bold when there's more than two.
