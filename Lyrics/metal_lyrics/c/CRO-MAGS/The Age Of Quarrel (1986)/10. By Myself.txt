Fighting it's such a struggle and I got so far
Got so far to go
Don't want to except no answers
But I ain't got nothing
Got nothing to show

It's such a struggle but I gotta do it
By myself
Can't except no logic so I gotta do it
By myself
It's such a struggle but I gotta do it
By myself
Can't except no logic so I gotta do it
By myself

Such a lonely path but I can't turn my back
Can't turn my back right now
See I got a role to play
And I gotta fill it, gotta fill it somehow
I set myself on this path and now
Now it's just too late

It's such a struggle but I gotta do it
By myself
Can't except no logic so I gotta do it
By myself
It's such a struggle but I gotta do it
By myself
Can't except no logic so I gotta do it
By myself

I'd put it all aside but you see this madness
Just won't wait
Talk nice things but I see I'm really,
I'm really overflowing with hate I'm talking,
I'm talking but I never seem to motivate
The answers you say they're outta reach
But first you gotta learn and then only can you teach
You say I'm insecure but ain't you scared of death
'Cause everyone's grabbing, holding for their final breath.
