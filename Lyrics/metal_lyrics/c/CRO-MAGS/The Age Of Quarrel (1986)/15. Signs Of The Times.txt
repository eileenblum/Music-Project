Signs of the times,
They're all around us
No one will look you in the eye
You don't know who to trust
I'm looking around me
And don't like what I see
Corruption all around me cause these,
These are the signs of the times
Seems like they're losing their minds
These are the signs of the times
Do you think that we're really progression
Just seems to me like some steady regression
I'm looking on and watching it corrode
Gotta hold back or I'm gonna explode
Take a look at where we're going
I'm seeing the signs and what they're showing
I'm totally in disbelief of modern man
And all his grief
These are the signs of the times
