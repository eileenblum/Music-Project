Lie to all your friends
The trouble never ends
You're gonna take a fall
And I don't care at all

Stabbed me in the back
Someone I trusted
Let's get things straight
Don't tread on me

I thought things were cool
But I guess I was a fool
And now I know
All about you

Stabbed me in the back
Someone I trusted
Let's get things straight
Don't tread on me

You crossed me once,
Don't try it again
You didn't learn,
I'll show you again
What goes around,
Comes back around
Revenge, revenge is sweet

Don't tread on me! [x4]
