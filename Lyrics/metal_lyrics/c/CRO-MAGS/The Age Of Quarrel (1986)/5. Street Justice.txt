Street justice happening all around you see
Won't try to talk my way out
Don't try to play those speech games anymore
Overpower-overcome

Street justice! Street justice! Street justice!

No way out gotta stand strong
Can't you see that I'm not wrong
That's the way it is and can't you see
Street justice for you and me.

Street justice! Street justice!
Street justice! Street justice!

If it really doesn't matter why do you care?
Don't turn around if it's not your affair
Don't try to play those speech games anymore
Overpower-overcome

Street justice! Street justice!
Street justice! Street justice!

Justice!!!
