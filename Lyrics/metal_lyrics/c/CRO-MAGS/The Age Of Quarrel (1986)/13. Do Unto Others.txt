Ain't really got nothing to say
It all comes across in a negative way
You, you best learn about bout be humbled
'Cause you too you'll wind up stumbled

Not one bit of substance
In a word they speak
When they get outspoken
It's only with the weak
See these wars they're happening
And then you're asking why
But just stop by some slaughterhouse
And hear the animals cry

You missed the point it's over your head
I guess you'd rather be negative instead
You can't account for these things you've done
I'll bet you think this MOI is fun

Take you down low
And show you some things
You've never seen
Riding that borderline
But there ain't no thing
Called in between
Kick you with some advice
And show you now
Just what I mean
