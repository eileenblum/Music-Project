A divided nation in these times of hate
So much racial tension say it's not too late
Won't you please god save us all
Won't you please god save us all
See the prophecies of things to come
Can the human race exist as one
Or the fire of disaster be the final doom
All in its path it will consume â fight back
Our happiness will turn to sorrow
Will  we live to see tomorrow?
Put the power of evil back in line
Won't be crucified no not this time fuck no
Fight back for all

See where you stand know who you are
In your heart
Yeah
