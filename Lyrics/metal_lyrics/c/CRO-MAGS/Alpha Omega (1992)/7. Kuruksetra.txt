Got to find a solution
To the battle raging in my heart
Timelessness it seems
Has no place in the movement
That we all must know
Nothing seems too clear
Illusions seem so permanent
When you doubt or think you're in control
You have the key to free the knowledge
The knowledge that was with you all along
Set it free then you'll see
We've forgotten truth and what we're living for
Forgotten answers
You know it's not as simple as it seems
So now through great revelations
Wisdom that will wake us from our dreams

I feel the conflict that exists within me
It's something that I can't control
Many other souls have battled in these realms before me
Always been a struggle in my heart to be free
Looked so far
Where else could I go?
Had to come to the answers
That's all I know
