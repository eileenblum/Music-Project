Walking alone in the cold dark night
Got a chill in my bones no relief's in sight
So much time spent with revenge as a thought
In this life alone so many wars I've fought

Oh leave what you know behind
I will take you
Beyond the limits of your mind
So take a trip with me
To the other side of madness
So close to the edge
The other side is madness
This ain't no fantasy
The other side is calling me
So take a trip with me
Tell me if you think you really dare

Try to hold on just for sanity's sake
So many so-called friends turned out to be fake
You better hope that there's a better way
Than me as the hunter cause you know you're the
prey
Oh leave what you know behind
I will take you
Beyond the limits of your mind

So take a trip with me
To the other side of madness
So close to the edge
The other side is madness
This ain't no fantasy
The other side is calling me
So take a trip with me
Tell me if you think you really dare

Come on yeah I'll take you there
The place where your nightmares live
Pain and fear is everywhere
You get down on your knees and you start to pray
You know you might never see the light of day
Oh god oh god what you gonna do
There ain't no running away when you're calling is due
Oh I've gone over the line
Hatred is taking over my rage is making me blind
Oh I want to live in peace
But there are those
Who would make the mistake
Of invoking the demons in me

You get down on your knees and you start to pray
You know you might never see the light of day
Oh god oh god there's nothing you can do
All of your worst nightmares are coming true

When I look up into the sky
I ask no forgiveness for we all have to die
But one thing that I know
Is I came to take your soul

Oh yeah

Days and nights of frustration
Have taken their toll
The blood is boiling in my veins
I'm out of control
