Quest â searching for the answers
Seek â the meaning of your life
Truth â in knowing life's perfection
Now â as infinite as time

Be free from your mind â and travel through time
See what you'll find â fly free
The essence of true living
Loving â life and all its worth

Peace â and transcendental knowledge
Knowing â heaven 's here on earth
Sight beyond sight
Peace from inside
Beyond all time

Now you see the truth is just a little bit closer
Closer than you ever guessed
Now you feel the proof is just a little bit closer
With every single breath
You see the truth is just a little bit closer
closer than you ever guessed
Now you feel the proof is just a little bit closer
With every single breath
