I see the signs of a corrupt nation
Living off the blood of humanity
The poor got nothing and nowhere to run
And the rich got more than they know
What to do with

Yeah, don't you see the signs?
Got our homeless on the park bench
With nowhere to go

Yeah, don't you see the signs?
There's people suffering everywhere
And no one seems to care
Yeah, don't you see the signs?
We got our children begging for money
With no food to eat
Yes, it's true!

I can't believe it (no!)
I can't believe it
I can't believe
The signs I see (no!)
I won't receive it (no!)
I won't receive it (no!)
We go to end the misery

I see the signs everywhere I look yeah
People try to escape through material game
I look around at society
I can't stand what I see

Stand up, stand up and fight
Don't be afraid, freedom's your right
Revolution set yourself free
This world belongs to you and me
