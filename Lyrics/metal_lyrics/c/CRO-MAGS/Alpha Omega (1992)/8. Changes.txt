So much confusion in this life I've been living
It makes me wonder what I'm searching for
Reflections of my past present and future
Things that always seem to haunt my soul

Born and raised in the slums of the world
One side of life is all I've ever known
The hard core truth it's a struggle for life yeah
That's the only thing I've ever been shown

Gotta find the key to free my mind
Could it set me free?
Is it so hard to know
You can look but will you find

Oh my god
I just can't lose control
Deception of the blind
I try so hard to find the answers
But I know that it's in my heart
Now I know that I shall come to see the truth
As I drift into my dreams

Got to make the changes
Out of darkness into light
Cut these ropes that bind us
Hope the truth can free us from the pain

I try so hard
To find the answer
But I know that they're in my heart

We've got to make the changes
First we have to look within
We've got to make the changes
It's a place we must begin

The changes must start in my heart
To find the answers
