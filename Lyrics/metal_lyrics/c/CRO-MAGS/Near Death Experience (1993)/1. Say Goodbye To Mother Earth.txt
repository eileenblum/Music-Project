It's time to stop this mindless system
System of death that destroys the earth
We're not blind, I see the changes come
Barren toxic wastelands when they're done

Save her

Chrystal clear waters become lakes of poison
Lush gree forests destroyed for one reason
Dying generation that brings us down
We got to make the mother fuckers step down
We're gonna bring 'em down
Revolution with a cause
Save the air, trees, water and the animals
Just for their greed they'll make the sacrifice
World where we live so now we gotta fight
