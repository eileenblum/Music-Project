Ancient reminders of worlds gone by,
Concrete tombstones reach for the sky,
Like hieroglyphic writings on the wall,
Modern man just doesn't seem to hear his call,
Force of times behind the changes bound to come,
Primitive man was once forced to succumb,
Both caught in a web of eternal quest,
Wiped out by their search for conquest,
Taken back to a land of wonder and of fear,
Prehistoric creatures stalked the wild frontier,
All can be told in unlocking of the past,
Cyclical repetition ah we see the contrast,
Skeletons in a closet as dark as the mind,
Hidden truths there shine light for the blind,
Somewhere back in time when cave dwellers walked,
Was a spoken language that needed not be talked,
Extinction found the way to man of yesterday,
Only to occur in tragedies today,
Lost innocence in the maze of confusion,
Sets the final stage for this drama of illusion,
Simplicity's dig to unfold great mysteries,
As we plunge forward engulfed by our destinies,
What will future man uncover in our ruin,
Kali-Yuga progresses wheels of time are spun,
Technological society buried by ignorance,
Fossils for decay victims of circumstances
