I can tell you that the murder's plain to see,
Every time I think about the unborn's misery,
I know that every soul's got a right to live
And so you take that life that only god could give.
Oh, you know it's true,
Oh, your body your choice,
Now listen to your unborn babies voice.
You know I'm never gonna see the light of day,
Not a single word ever will I say,
When there's death in the womb life is lost
And your life will someday be the cost.
You see the prophecy's unfolding,
They told us what this age would bring,
I've taken shelter in your womb and it's become my resting tomb.
I can tell you that the murder's plain to see,
Every time I think about the unborn's misery,
I know that every soul's got a right to live
And so you take that life that only god could give
