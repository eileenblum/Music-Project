Many eyes look to the skies never to see me,
All is lost by the power of time and that which must be, time
I am, destroyer of your world,
My wrath won't be surpassed as I down all in my path,
As time takes its toll upon the seasons,
I am the force creating change,
You have to dream each breath as it may be your last,
You can study me but you'll never know just what happened in the past.
Time I am â I am that time.
Conquest no one will evade me,
My test will you lose your dignity,
Moments that you try to embrace,
Get snatched ripped from outta time and space,
Cruel hand of the master called time,
Wreaks havoc on you every lifetime,
Time will make its final sever,
Nothing ever lasts forever.
Use me, oh so very wisely,
Or grow old only to despise me,
Seconds pass who can ever possess,
Moving on with such grace and finesse,
Victims caught in a web of quest,
Crying out trying to achieve their best,
Time I am the only killer of all,
I am your eternal downfall
