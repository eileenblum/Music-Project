Walking alone in the cold dark night,
Got a chill in my bones no relief's in sight,
So much time spent with revenge as a thought,
In this life alone so many wars I've fought,
Oh leave what you know behind,
I till take you beyond the limits of your mind,
So take a trip with me to the other side of madness,
So close to the edge,
The other side is madness,
This ain't no fantasy,
The other side is calling me,
So take a trip with me,
Tell me if you think you really dare,
Try to hold on just for sanity's sake,
So many so-called friends turned out to be fake,
You better hope that there's a better way than me as the hunter
'cause you know you're the prey,
Oh leave what you know behind,
I till take you beyond the limits of your mind,
So take a tip with me to the other side of madness,
So close to the edge,
The other side is madness,
This ain't no fantasy,
The other side is calling me,
So take a trip with me,
Tell me if you think you really dare
