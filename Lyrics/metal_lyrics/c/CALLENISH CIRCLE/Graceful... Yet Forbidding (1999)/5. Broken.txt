[Lyrics by: Ronny Tyssen &amp; Patrick Savelkoul]

Behind these eyes and their colourful lustre
hides a place of shades and dim
By no winds dark clouds can be driven
My silent grief will never be heard

Come on and walk with me into reality
Dance with me untill my shadow sleeps

Feelings of sadness and betrayal
flowing through my empty veins
It resembles my deepest sorrow
As the mist resembles the rain

Pushed aside and left behind
My memory is slowly fading away
Though thinking of your empty words
haunts me every day, every single day

Your vows are all broken
The echoes I cannot believe
How could you ever forget
and live on with this deceit

All these useless conversations
floating into the darkest night
Same mistakes over and over
Finally I see a different life

Come and walk with me...
