[Music by: Callenish Circle]
[Lyrics by: Jos Evers &amp; Patrick Savelkoul]

Once a mighty tribe full of pride
one with nature till white man arrived
They came for trade in name of their king
Exchanging slavery and hate

Dying of violence and foreign disease
Defending their holy ground
Their native belief

Exiled from their land
Deprived from their faith
Brave warriors in battle were slain

For centuries condemned to live in reservations
Another example of so-called annihilation

After all those years nothing is changing
Prejudice and death are still here reign
