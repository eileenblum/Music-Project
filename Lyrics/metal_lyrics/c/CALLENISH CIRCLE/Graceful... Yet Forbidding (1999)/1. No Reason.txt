[Lyrics by: Ronny Tyssen &amp; Patrick Savelkoul]

Ever heard my suffer
I wonder why, is this real
What have you done to me
For no reason at all

And I feared
You don't seem
Just gave up
Why...do you care

Everything is lost
All hope is gone
And I even won't complain
For this is my way of the cross

And I feared for this to happen
You do not seem to care
Just gave up all we had
Don't you bother
Don't you fucking care

Do you care

And still I try to forget
It keeps on running inside my mind
Alone...
