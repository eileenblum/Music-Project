[Music by: Callenish Circle]
[Lyrics by: Ronny Tyssen &amp; Patrick Savelkoul]

The dawn has reached the sky
What does the darkness try to hide
Shadows overrun the sunlight
Nocturnal violence took it's price

Diabolic evil minds
They rule atrocious bestial crowds
Ideas seem to fade away
as their presence is shown by howls

The dawn has reached the sky
Shadows overrun the sunlight

Confusion, don't let the shadows rule your life
Existence, hold up the sun and humanize
Eyes betray their parlous lies
Their purpose should be known by now

Anxiety for improvement
Trying to neglect their appearance
Forced into seclusion
Secrecy has caused your breakdown

In the darkness you fear for your life
When the shadows appear into your mind
Your dreams seems to turn to dust
The desire you feel deep inside
