[Lyrics by: Ronny Tyssen &amp; Patrick Savelkoul]

Trying to hide your face on my shoulder
Cannot change the way you feel for me

Don't want to see you cry
When you think of me

I know it's hurting you seeing me like this
You will remember this for the longest time

Don't let these images become a curse

Illusions in words confusing me
Your voice sounds so unreal

Don't tell me you cannot forget
I see future black

Just waiting for my day to come
To be released from agony

What's the use of holding on,
the few more times I'll see the sun
