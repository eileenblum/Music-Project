[Music by: Callenish Circle]
[Lyrics by: Ronny Tyssen &amp; Patrick Savelkoul]

A fear to be alone
has driven us apart

In your hollow eyes I sense the ultimate frost
A story never to be told

Caught by deceit
We dance on a river's stream

Although survived a storm of pervading insane words
This stream is flowing to the sea

I haven't trusted my distrust
Now my wariness, it lets me down
No place to go
My fate remains still unknown

A disgrace is banished from my insane mind
Yet my harm, it tends to hate
