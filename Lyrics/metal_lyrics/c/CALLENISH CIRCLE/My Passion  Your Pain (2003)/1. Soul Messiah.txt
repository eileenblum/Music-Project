Sin, sinful, as a sinner I am
Conceived by a jackal
Cunning as a serpent 

I'm hiding inside your conscience's parasite
I am the controller
The 
autocrat
of the soul
After me, no turning back
Gaining full soul control
Sin, 
as a
sinner I am
Conceived by a jackal
Cunning as a serpent
I'm hiding 
inside

Need, needle as I am your neediness
Conquering flesh and bones
I'll be 
taking
over 'till breathing finites
For I am you
I am the controller
The 
autocrat
of the soul
After me, no turning back
Gaining full soul control

Searching
for thy partner in distress
My endless journey continues
The end is 
ending,
as there is
Nothing more to take
No more than a shadow now
A splinter 
of
what you used to be
I am the controller
The autocrat of the soul
After 
me,
no turning back
Gaining full soul control
Need, needle, as I am your 
neediness

Conquering flesh and bones
I'll be taking over 'till breathing finites

For I am you
