Crossing boundaries of indifference
Your greed exceeds the line
Egoism 
even multiplied

Pressing forward your lies
A path of endless consequence
Paved with bare 
hands
You'll
start your endless journey soon
A path of endless consequence
Paved with 
bare hands

You'll better be of dead
Exercise my fantasy
How my passion is your pain 

Senses
sliding into sin
Further and further away
Wake up, enjoy reality

Pressed to the ground,
a black curtain
Covering your illusions, chains of discomfort
Choking 
unbound
Feel
my rejection
My hate unfolds
When your blood stains
It leaves me cold 

As life is
fading
You're all alone
Feel my rejection
Your fate unfolds
Exercise 
my fantasy

How my passion is your pain
Senses sliding into sin
Further and further 
away
Wake
up, enjoy reality
Pressed to the ground, a black curtain
Covering your 
illusions,
chains of discomfort
Choking unbound
Feel my rejection
My hate unfolds 

When your
blood stains
It leaves me cold
As life is fading
You're all alone

Feel my rejection

Your fate unfolds
You're all alone
Crossing boundaries of indifference 

Your greed
exceeds the line
Egoism even multiplied
Pressing forward your lies

Exercise my
fantasy
How my passion is your pain
Senses sliding into sin
Further 
and further away

Exercise my fantasy
How my passion is your pain
Senses sliding into 
sin
Further
and further away
Wake up, enjoy reality
Pressed to the ground, a black 
curtain

Covering your illusions, chains of discomfort
Choking unbound Feel my 
rejection
My
hate unfolds
When your blood stains
It leaves me cold
As life is 
fading
You're
all alone
Feel my rejection
Your fate unfolds
You're all alone
Your 
fate unfolds
