Relying on, a conscious you never had
Ignorant for the rage within

Feeling like, you're
betraying yourself
The urge creeping right under your skin
This miry 
deception, it crazes
you
Crestfallen, you are losing your way
Your blood, now it starts to 
boil again
But
your disguise is not gonna fall
Now the time, has come to pay back
It's 
time to show
them all
This miry deception, it crazes you
Crestfallen, you are losing 
your way

Becoming way too much, way too much for you
Sick of walking away

Oppressed carnal
mayhem
Criticize the truth you dread
Forever living the lie
Enforced 
weakness misled

Reached the point of no return
Too late to turn the tide
Resurrect to 
inflict your
pain on others
Being part of the masterplan they can not hide
This miry 
deception, it
crazes you
Crestfallen, you're losing your way
Becoming way too much, 
way too much for you
