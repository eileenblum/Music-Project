Fearless I pushed the switch, causing you
Suddenly to disappear
The echo 
of thunder
again reduced
Never thought you
Would leave me
Still chasing time, so 
close
Yet
so far apart
My understanding is killing me
I know you had to
Follow 
your heart

Don't look at me now
It's for your own good
Just to walk away
Road 
ends, remains

The unspoken truth
All hopes merged into stone
Terrified of the unknown 

What could
have been I realize
All hope merged into stone
Terrified of the unknown 

is now
forever gone
Let it slip through my fingers...
Don't look at me now

It's for your
own good
Just to walk away
Road ends, remains
Not aware of the scarlet 
claw

Seemingly uncomplicated
What could have been I realize
Now your love

Forever lost

Fearless I pushed the switch, causing you
Suddenly to disappear
The echo 
of thunder
again reduced
Never thought you
Would leave me
New day has come
but 
I'll get over
you
Tide is high
Access still denied
