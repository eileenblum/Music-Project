Seeing you simper awakes the
Gloomy part inside of me
It's making me 
shiver
sickening
Self-complacency
Dwelling in disdain
You keep on turning 
back at
me
Just a matter of time before I'll
Show you that my hate's sincere

Your
contempt is really choking me
Better step aside
Awaiting patiently, our 
moment
will appear
This detailed script before my eyes
As long as it takes I'll 
be
re-reading
Re-reading it every night
Dwelling in disdain
You keep on 
turning
back at me
Seeing you simper awakes the
Gloomy part inside of me
It's 
making
me shiver sickening
Self-complacency
Awaiting patiently, our moment will 
appear

This detailed script before my eyes
As long as it takes I'll be 
re-reading

Re-reading it every night
Dwelling in disdain
You keep on turning back 
at me

How I try to turn away
It seems you're the next in line
