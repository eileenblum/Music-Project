Passion, desire keeping me living in sin
Aiming for flesh, power and 
dominion
The
embodiment of mankind
My mind overfed
Fortitude overflow
My mind 
overfed
This
convenant, our endless bond
A parasitic twin
This covenant, our endless 
bond
Convulsive
clang to the past
Sharing, the blood running through our veins
Fed and 
feeding opposite
minds
The embodiment of mankind My mind overfed
Fortitude overflow
My 
mind overfed

Obey me, seduce me, please me
Now touch me, adore me and serve me
I'll 
harvest without
sorrow
Obey me, seduce me, please me
Now touch me, adore me and serve me 

Trust me,
I'll be your guide
