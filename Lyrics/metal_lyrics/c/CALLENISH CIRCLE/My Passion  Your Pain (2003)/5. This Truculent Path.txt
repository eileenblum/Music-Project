This Enigma Keeps Me Entangled
On the Edge Of Insanity
Living My 
Transient Being In
Trance
Wisdom Has Withered Me
Within This Warren Of Confusion
I Feel A 
Zephyr,
Showing Me The Way
Stealing The Pleasure To See Me Fall
All Atrocities, 
Carved In It's
Walls
Fed My Hate For A Long Time
I Know They Did Not Expect
It Felt 
So Good Having
Control
Their Faces Made Worth All These Years
A Trucelent Path Paved 
With Disillusions

Made Me Conscienceless
I Trapped Through All Stages Of Life
Trapped 
Inside, Myself

Trapped Inside Myself
From A Distance Observing
How My Passion Is Their 
Pain
Now I'm
Pulling The Strings
And I Won't Stop The Bleeding
From A Distance 
Observing
How My
Passion Is Your Pain
Now I'm Pulling The Strings
And I Won't Stop The 
Bleeding...
This
Enigma Keeps Me Entangled
On The Edge Of Insanity
Living My Transcient 
Being In Trance

Wisdom Has Withered Me
Fed My Hate For A Long Time
I Know They Did Not 
Expect
It Felt
So Good Having Control
Their Faces Made Worth All These Years
A 
Trucelent Path Paved
With Disillusions
Made Me Conscienceless
I Trapped Through All Stages Of 
Life
Trapped
Inside Myself
From A Distance Observing
How My Passion Is Their Pain

Now I'm Pulling
The Strings
And I Won't Stop The Bleeding
