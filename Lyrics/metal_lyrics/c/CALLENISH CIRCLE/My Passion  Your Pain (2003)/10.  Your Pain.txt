All having the urge
Flesh too weak to resist
Temptations, engraving 
scarves for life

Enforced by, by innate lust
Once scarred, forever lost
Till final 
relieve sends it's
farewell
Redemption for the chained
Pain, the agony keeping me in black 

My mind
clouded, dark and frail
Hollowness of a tormented soul
Unable to burst 
out
Of the
vicious trail
Unable to burst out
Obey you, seduce you, please you

Touch you, adore you
and serve you
You own mind, body and soul
