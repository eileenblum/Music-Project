Seemingly controlled monotone breathing
It cannot hide I'm raging within
Loose your vanity so you can admit
The kiss of Judas on my lips

Balancing the rope, spinning the wheel
Putting your thumbs on the scales
I guess you've got something to say
Now don't spill clichÃ©s

Take a trip down to memory lane with me
Then you'll know what the fuck I mean
Think it over, watch it come down
The end draws near as I'm closing in

Ignorant
Following the red trace
Unaware of the things to come
Unknowingly injected by the virus
Am I not the only one?
Ignorant
Unaware of the things to come
Ignorant
Am I not the only one?
