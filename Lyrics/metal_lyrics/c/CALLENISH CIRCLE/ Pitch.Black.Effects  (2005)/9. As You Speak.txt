As you speak once again
I feel the anger in my veins
Thick bloodcluts speeding
Through my blood banes

Pathetic passion
For glamour, living the lie
Dispirit conversations
Turned compassion into rage
Wasted too much time, you fucking clown

Desperately seeking for my loyalty
Indignity your only salvation
It's far too late, I'm breaking this chain

Once you ignite
The fire, the heat will burn relentlessly
Wounds will heal, but stains remain
Recalling my long lost pride
We'll meet again one day

Choking, gasping, forced beyond lanes
Tides are changing, I'm reclaiming the crown
Choking, gasping, forced beyond lanes
Restoring my faith, enjoying your pain

Bracing the ties
He's sulking... luring him
Into my web with my intricate lies
I love it when they struggle
