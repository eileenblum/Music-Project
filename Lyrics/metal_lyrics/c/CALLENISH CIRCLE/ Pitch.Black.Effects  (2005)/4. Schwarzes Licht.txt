Leaning out of the window
Breathing, my eyes wide open
Embracing this shaft of light

Feeling Frightened, timorously waiting
Hoping, for my rebirth to come
Striding for that open door

Black is the light, that sticks to my retina
Black is the light, that whispers of hope

Black is the light that haunts me
Another dawn, another stroke
The searing pain prevails

Das Schwartze Licht
Es nimmt mir die kraft
Es nimmit mir die hoffnung
Ohne furcht in das nichts hinein

I open my eyes, feeling the cold
I hear the cries, smelling humid soil
My bones are broken, yet I'm running
Floating on a pitch black effect

Feel the effects, of a black sear
My lungs are tattered, my eyes are shut
The last image in my retina
