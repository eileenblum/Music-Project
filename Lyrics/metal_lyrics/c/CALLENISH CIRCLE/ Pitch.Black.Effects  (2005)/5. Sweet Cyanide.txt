Don't act so ingenuously
You know you let me fall
Don't play your tricks on me
You know you're the cause of it all

I know what they're saying
That my sun soon starts to fade
What they say it is not true
My rays are pointing out to you

Wiped my tears away
This desolation makes me strong
Cannot stand this punishment
At the end I will walk alone

Sweet Cyanide
This time I choose my own way
Sweet Cyanide
Easy exit on the fast lane

Broken dreams in my mind
My confidence shamelessly betrayed
This act of obsession
There's always one escape
