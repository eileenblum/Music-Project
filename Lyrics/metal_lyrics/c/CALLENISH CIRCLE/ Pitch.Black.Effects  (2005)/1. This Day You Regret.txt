Suddenly, the sun at it's highest peak on my life's brightest day
I will never forget this day you regret
All I can do is turn my back
Never felt this empty inside
Arms open wide
But there's no place for me to hide

What were you thinking?
Can you think at all?
Can you bear the consequences?
Can you feel anything at all?

The truth or your lives
I don't know what is left to believe
I'll save myself once more
Don't you dare to reach out to me

Fooled yourself and brought me down
This pain is much too real
Do you see what you have done?
My wounds will never ever heal
