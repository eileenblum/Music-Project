Your courageous insanity follows
Indefinable ways of your infinite mind
Temperature's rising fast
Minutes before your world collide

The truth drifting further away
Paranoia insomnia taking over
This guilt forcing you to confess
Trapped by the conscience you never knew you possessed

Self-Inflicted
Don't believe what you feel
Self-Inflicted
Now look again, have faith in me

Acting like an innocent victim
Did you forget your pain is self-inflicted?
Remember you changed your own fate?
Unable to break the fall

I know it's hard to believe... but for real
That what you see is real... can't accept it
I'm reaching out, please accept
This doubt is slowly killing me
