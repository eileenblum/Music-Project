Behind these eyes and their colourfull lustre
Hides a place of shades and dim
By no winds dark clouds can be driven
My silent grief will never be heard

Feelings of sadness and betrayal
Flowing through my empty veins
It resembles my deepest sorrow
As the mist resembles the rain

Pushed aside and left behind
My memory is slowly fading away
Though thinking of your empty words
Haunts me every day, every single day

Your vows are all broken
The echoes I cannot believe
How you could you ever forget
And live on with this deceive

Your vows all broken
Echoes I can't believe
How could you ever forget
And live on with this deceive

All these useless conversations
Floating into the darkest night
Same mistakes over and over
Finally I see a different life

Pushed aside and left behind
My memory is slowly fading away
Though thinking of your empty words
Haunts me every day, every single day
