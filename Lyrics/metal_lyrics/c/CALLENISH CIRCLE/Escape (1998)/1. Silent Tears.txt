His needs controlling his mind
His heart is beating fast
Among their anxious eyes

This easy prey's heart is bleeding
Wishing it's just a dream
In this silent moment
The serpent's desires allayed

They look deep inside as cold as ice
The ink-stained memories
forever stay
They look deep inside as cold as ice

His needs controlling his mind
His heart is beating fast
Among their anxious eyes

And they look deep inside as col
as your eyes
And they look deep inside as cold as ice

One night's crying can't make up
for years of denial
But all things will come to an end
Torment and damnation will not last forever
After darkness there will always be light

The angels will expel the demons
out of your mind, life, mind
The angels will expel the demons
out of your mind

[Repeat all except firs chapter]
