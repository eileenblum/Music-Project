I am staring in glass
I see someone that is standing
Who looks a lot like me

Staring in glass, I see someone
Standing who looks a lot but is not me
Just my split identity

The paradise throws me on ice
And I awake with a scream

Can't you see the light, can't you see the time
That is cutting open my sorrowfull eyes

And I am a person who doesn't bleed
from a thousand wounds
I have finally overwon my life
With me go content and moral
and disappear forever
I have finally overwon life

The road I walk is grey
Without reflections, full of delusions
And I don't know where I should go

In the mirror I see my infinity
My crying infinity

I am staring in glass
I am standing alone

And I am a person who doesn't
bleed from a thousands wounds
I have finally overwon my life
With me go content and moral
and disappear forever
I have finally overwon life

Right before me I see my solemn eyes
Looking in the mirror of serenity
They are shining so mysterious
and wide
Even already resigned,
almost immovably

In the mirror I see my infinity
My crying infinity
