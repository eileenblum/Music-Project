Obey me, seduce me and fucking please me / Kneel down, now touch me, adore 
me and serve me / Never forget my wish is your command / What I want is what 
I get... is what I get / My final warning / I'll hunt you down / I hear you, 
I feel you, I fucking smell you / Don't you dare to run away / My final 
warning-shot, you're begging / Your begging turns me on... turns me on / My 
final warning / I'll hunt you down / I hear you, I fucking feel you, I smell 
you / Don't you dare to run away / Please come out / Come home with me / 
I'll never touch you anymore / I can't be alone tonight / It will be the 
same as before / Don't hate me, call me / Come see me / Don't be afraid / 
Where are you, can't fucking see you, I seek you / You can't hide away from 
me / My final warning / I will shoot you down
