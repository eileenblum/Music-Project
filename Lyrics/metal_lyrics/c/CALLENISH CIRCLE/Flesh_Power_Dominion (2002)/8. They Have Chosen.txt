Leaving me nothing to believe in / Now I'm craving for silence / Never alone 
again / They have chosen me / Took away my life / Took away my pride / 
Sustaining echoes through the night / Forcing my decline / Whispers 
screaming from within / Same words over and over again / Lies becoming 
bitter reality / The mirror reflects a stranger's eye / Whispering feels 
like fire / Screaming feels like ice
