I'm hearing your reproachful words / Within seconds my rage is blackening me 
out / This feeling is way too much for me / I'm crying out my disbelief / 
Can't handle you showing discontent / After all this time you do not know me 
at all / Can't you just handle the truth / You're letting me down 
forevermore / Reality becoming crystal-clear / Don't bother me with your 
pathetic dreams / You stigmatised my fate / I would die for seeing you 
suffer my disbelief / This is the end of the line / Not endless after all / 
You've got to get away from here / Far away from here
