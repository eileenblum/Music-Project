Empty feelings inside / feelings I cannot hide / Can't bare it anymore / 
Tell me what it's good for / Blamed for something I didn't do / Blame it on 
me but I can't help you / Pathetic lying fuck / And how can I make this come 
to an end / I can see only one way, my way / I'm not finished with you / 
Since you started with me / My bitterness will be your end / And now you 
will loose again / Blood drained illusions / When it comes to seeing you / 
Sudden dark emotions / One day I am completely breaking through / Pretend 
you do not hear me / But I have one more thing to say / My bitterness will 
be your end.../ Now you will lose again
