Whisper slowly, words retrieved / The more you suffer the more I grieve / No 
cure to ease your pain / Forgive me I feel ashamed / I'm keeping my promise 
/ It will be over soon / Gently, softly, you won't feel a thing / This is 
what you wanted / I will end your suffering now / Between these grey brick 
walls / Weeping empty tears / Still picturing your face / Your embrace 
haunting in my dreams / Choose now or never / It is time to end this now / 
This will be the promised relief / Hearing your heartbeat slowing down / 
Pulling you close where you belong / Pushing you away / This is your final 
swansong
