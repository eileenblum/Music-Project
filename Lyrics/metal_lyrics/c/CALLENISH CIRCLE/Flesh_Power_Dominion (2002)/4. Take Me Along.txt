And why can't you wait a little longer / You don't want to leave this soon / 
There's one thing I want you to know / Give me some time before you go / My 
ears cannot stand this silence / Please say my name one more time / My eyes 
cannot stand the light / So fragile how can you cry / How can you see / My 
ears cannot stand this silence now / Say my name one more time / My eyes 
cannot stand the light / So fragile how can you cry with a smile / Can't you 
wait a little longer / You don't want to leave this soon / There's one thing 
I want you to know / Give me some time to explain / Listen to me before you 
go / Take me along / as you sit here all alone / Getting to know myself / I 
do not care about the birds / Nor about the sun / I know it is not your 
choice / I know it's not your fault / That you'll be gone / So take me along 
now / Together we cry / As we see the end coming near / Your tired eyes feel 
my fear / Feel my fear again
