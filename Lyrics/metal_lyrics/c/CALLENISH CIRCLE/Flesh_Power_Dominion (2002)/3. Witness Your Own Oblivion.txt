Relieve, the realm of the dead / In complete darkness you awaken / Not 
knowing where you are / Breathing tastes thin and dry / Your primal fear 
begins to stir / Helpless awaiting the reaper to come / Fighting against the 
nothingness / A thousand colours surrounding you / Relieve, the realm of the 
dead / Tasting blood coming / from under your nails just makes you aware / 
All the scratches in the wood mark your final attempt / Tasting blood coming 
/ from under your nails just makes you insane / Being just six feet 
underground / Still an escape cannot be done / Heavily breathing your last 
breath / Your face expressing it all / Witness your own oblivion now
