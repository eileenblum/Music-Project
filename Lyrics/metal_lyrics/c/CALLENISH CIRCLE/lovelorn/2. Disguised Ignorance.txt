[Lyrics: R. Tyssen]

Lifting my eyes I feel the hatred coming out
Reality is scaring the hell out of me
Cruelty of people who believe in their own destiny
Compulsion of your soul into deceitful confidence

[Chorus:]
Power abuse for their own welfare
With the evil intent they hide their own thoughts
A crystal illumination
Is what the prophet foretold
With a visual revelation
Of their disguised ignorance

What do they receive for wasting their lives
Illuminating answers to the questions which arise
Nobody knows what cooperation is about
Why are they so mentally blind

[Chorus:]
Power abuse for their own welfare
With the evil intent they hide their own thoughts
A crystal illumination
Is what the prophet foretold
With a visual revelation
Of their disguised ignorance

[Solo R.C]

Inconsistent regulations
Creating forced obligations
Exploiting harmless followers
Causing a worldwide genocide

[Chorus:]
Power abuse for their own welfare
With the evil intent they hide their own thoughts
A crystal illumination
Is what the prophet foretold
With a visual revelation
Of their disguised ignorance

[Solo J.E]
