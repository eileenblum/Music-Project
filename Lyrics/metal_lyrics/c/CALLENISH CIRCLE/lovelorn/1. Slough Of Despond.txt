[Lyrics: A. Beckers, R. Tyssen]

In silence I am wandering
Can't avoid the screaming words
I try to make up my mind
All this thinking makes me blind
No control in my mind.

[Chorus:]
And I open my eyes
Don't know what to do
I'm waiting for answers
But they are all untrue

There is a never ending pain
Slowly tearing me apart
Never ending insanity
Your darkness makes it hard

[Solo J.E.]

[Chorus:]
And I open my eyes
Don't know what to do
I'm waiting for answers
But they are all untrue

There is a never ending pain
Slowly tearing me apart
Never ending insanity
Your darkness makes it hard

In silence I was wandering
Couldn't avoid the screaming words
I tried to make up my mind
All this thinking made me blind

The reason for my suicide.
