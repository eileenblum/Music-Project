The dawn has reached the sky
What does the darkness trying to hide
Shadows overrun the sunlight
Nocturnal violence took it's price

[Solo J.E.]

Diabolic evil minds
They rule atrocious bestial crowds
Ideas seem to fade away
As their presence is shown by howls

The dawn has reached the sky.
Shadows overrun the sunlight.

Confusion - Don't let the shadows rule your life
Existence - Hold up the sun and humanize
Eyes betray their parlous lies
Their purpose should be known by now

[Solo J.E.]

Anxiety for improvements
Crying to neglect their appearance
Forced into seclusion
Secrecy has forced your breakdown

The dawn has reached the sky.
Shadows overrun the sunlight.

In the darkness you fear your life
When the shadows appear into your mind
Your dreams seem to turn into dust
The desire you feel deep inside
