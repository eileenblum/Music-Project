[Lyrics: A. Beckers, R. Tyssen]

Her last hour has come to past
Together we whisper her last
I'm trying to hide the tears
Created by my own fears

Now it's time to let her go
Time to relieve my soul

[Chorus:]

Holding her hand
Thought she would understand
Whishing that she could stay with me
So much to say
Now that she's on her way
Starting her unknown journey

Holding her hand
She's slipping through like sand
Wishing that she would stay with me
Together as one
The time for her has come
As she's turning her eyes away

I wish I could guide her
Lead her over all these lonely paths
Her time has come
I see you relieved
It makes me sad.

[Chorus:]
Holding her hand
Thought she would understand
Whishing that she could stay with me
So much to say
Now that she's on her way
Starting her unknown journey

Our separation is now complete
Why did she leave me so alone
Now that she's gone
Her love disappeared
I'm feeling cold
