Elvenwell

A lady with an elven skin
Came brisk and bright in my darkest dream
"I make a deal with you," she said
"If you show me the mud god made men of."

For I can give you, I can give
All the things you lost, all the things you miss
I can give you, I can give
Heaven gifts and hells darkest wishes

She held the silence in her hands
Then she gave me to drink from the golden well
So gracefully and strong she was
Lulled me asleep in yonder grass

For I can give you, I can give
All the things you lost, all the things you miss
I can give you, I can give
Heaven gifts and hells darkest wishes

So she took me, so I went
On a carriage of ivory
Through mist and rain, to distant islands
Hearing her sing

For I can give you, I can give
All the things you lost, all the things you miss
I can give you, I can give
Heaven gifts and hells darkest wishes

Seven years and seven days, my heart, asleep
My chest in her white hands, alive, alive
She held me, but my fear remained
So I returned to the muddy well
To find friends and family buried and gone

For I can give you, I can give
All the things you lost, all the things you miss
I can give you, I can give
Heaven gifts and hells darkest wishes
