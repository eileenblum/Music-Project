Yellow leaves at my window
The picture smiles its gentle smile
Still you sit around, reminding me of the time
When your smell was at my side

Still you show me your latest autographs
And I laugh though I should cry
But I can't put the blame on you, babe
For I always knew you were
An autumn child... Uuuh autumn child

Stars were guiding your way
The big guides know their child
I still imagine your face
Though I don't know your name
Wish I'd know you in your life times

I read this muddy letter a thousand times
Knew its yours though there was no name
And I always knew in worlds apart
Yeah, I always knew you were
An autumn child... Uuuh autumn child

Above your head shines a fresh bright light
The universe brought its seasons in your life
A thousand autumn leaves in a thousands of shapes
I will elect them for my time

I saw your back mirrorized by lakes
Reached to grip down to the ground
But I couldn't catch a finger of you, babe
For I cannot ever live
In autumn time... 

In my sleep, I thought I heard your voice
And I wished I could live in, live in my...
...Dreams...
