Smell the burning cinnamon
On Cathy's floor when you return
Hear her dark voice, the gloom of dark voice
I know her house well, boy
For I lived there on
There on her floor beside her door

Living on Cathy's, living on Cathy's floor
You're following roses, following roses
Roses

And the child beside her
Was singing "nana, nana"
When I was there, there on her floor
And Cathy had parties, boy
Was she laughing
I couldn't help laughing
I laughed with her...

Living on Cathy's, living on Cathy's floor
You're following roses, following roses
Roses, uuuh roses

Roses for my love
To hold her, to hold my treasure
Roses for my love
To hold her, to hold my treasure

Sometimes when I stayed awake
I thought I heard her at my door
I thought I felt her at my cheeks
Then I tried to speak to her
But always, but always, I scared myself
Waiting at her
Closed door

Living on Cathy's, living on Cathy's floor
You're following roses, following roses
Roses, uuuh roses

Roses for my love
To hold her, to hold my treasure
Roses for my love
To hold her, to hold my treasure

Living on Cathy's, living on Cathy's floor
You're following roses, following roses
Uuuh
