The whole world is fighting
So many have died yet
They lost their lives for a crazy idea
They misunderstood the will of their own god
Their victims selected by nothing but pure chance

No holy wars in the name of any god!

Donât pull the trigger
Lay down your weapon
Stop killing people
Itâs not your business, not your faith
Donât hate the difference
To all our brothers
To all our sisters
Resign to hate and to revenge

War was never the aim of our old gods
War is never the aim of our new god
Hold on
Stop to kill

Syria is burning, the Middle East in flames
The Near East dies and Africans starving
Ukraine is breaking and pirates rise again
Northern Korea still threatens the whole world

No holy wars in the name of any god!

Don't pull the trigger
Lay down your weapon
Stop killing people
It's not gods will, it's just a sin
Don't hate the difference
For love and living
To all our children
Resign to hate and revenge

War was never the aim of our old gods
War is never the aim of our new god

We stand together, just one for the other
We hold on to the believe in our power
We will not fail as long as we are united
No fear, not scared of the future to come
We stand together, just one for the other
We hold on to the believe in our power
We will not fail as long as we are united
No fear, not scared, we will withstand all those threads

No holy wars in the name of any god!

Donât pull the trigger
Lay down your weapon
Stop killing people
Itâs not your business, not your faith
Donât hate the difference
To all our brothers
To all our sisters
Resign to hate and to revenge
Don't pull the trigger
Lay down your weapon
Stop killing people
It's not gods will, it's just a sin

War was never the aim of our old gods
War is never the aim of our new god
Hold on
Hold on
