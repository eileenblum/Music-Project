Long ago, such a long time ago
I walked amongst the living in here
Bound to these walls,
The stones and the trees
This place is mine
Until the end of all time

A long time of mourning
A heart that died in grief
A long time of haunting
The lady of the wall

[Chorus:]
I was like a falcon kept in cages of gold
Princess from the highlands to the glades
But my father killed my love, my dear
So I made my step off the wall...

Long ago,
A long time ago,
I swore to love him in life and in death
Now I am bound here, I have to fulfill
The promise I once gave

A long time of mourning
A heart that died in grief
A long time of haunting
The lady of the wall

[Chorus]

Where is he?
Just tell me,
I force you to show me
Where his soul has gone.
I'm searching
And haunting.
Who are you?
What was my name?
Remember me in the centuries to come.

One day I will find you,
One day we will find deliverance
I'm sure, I'm sure we'll reach heaven's bright gate and cross

So long I will rule here instead...

[Chorus]
