Cha b'e sneachda 's an reÃ³thadh bho thuath
Cha b'e `n crannadh geur fuar bho `n ear
Cha b'e `n t-uisge 's a'ghaillionn bho `n iar
Ach an galair a bhlian bho `n deas
BlÃ th, duilleach, stoc, agus freumh
CÃ nan mo threubh 's mo shluaidh

[Chorus:]
Thig thugainn, thig cÃ²'ruim gu siar
Gus an cluinn sinn ann cÃ¡nan nam FÃ©inn
Thig thugainn, thig cÃ²'ruÃ­m gu siar
Gus an cluinn sinn ann cÃ nan nan GÃ¡idheal

Nuair chithear fear-fÃ©ilidh'sa ghleann
Bu chinnteach gur GÃ¡idhlig a' chainnt
Nuair a spion iad a threumh as an fhonn
`N Ã ite GÃ ldhlig tha cÃ¡nan a ghoill
`S a Ghaidhealtachd creadhal-nan-sonn
`S tir "Mhajors" is "Cholonels" `n diugh innt'

[Chorus]
"Thoir a nuas dhuinn na coinnleirean Ã²r
'S annt caraibh na coinnlean geal cÃ¨ir
Lasaibh suas iad an seÃ²mair a'bhrÃ²in
Tigh-aire seann chÃ nan a' GhÃ idheil"
'Se siud o chionn fhad' thuirt an nÃ¡mh
Ach fhathast tha beÃ² cÃ nan a' GÃ idheal

[Chorus]

Ged theich i le beath' Ã s na glinn
Ged na cluinnear a-nis muigh i's an DÃ¹n
O DhÃ¹thaich MhicAoidh, fada tuath
Gu an ruig thu Druim-Uachdar nam bÃ²
Gidheadh, anns na n-Eileanan Siar
'Si fhathast ann ciad chÃ innt an t'sloigh

[English translation:]

It was not the snow and the frost from the north
It was not the sharp, cold blasts from the east
It was not the rain and the storms from the west
But the disease from the south that has starved
The bloom, foliage, stalk and root
Of the language of my race and my people

Come with us, come with me to the west
Until we hear the language of the Fein
Come with us, come with me to the west
Until we hear the language of the Gael

When a killed man was seen in the glen
It was certain that Gaelic was his language
But they have torn his roots from the ground
In place of Gaelic is the Lowlander's language
And the Highlands, cradle of heroes
Today is the land of majors and colonels

"Bring us down the golden candlesticks
And place in them candles of white wax
Light them in the chamber of sorrow
The wake-house of the Gael's old language"
That's what the enemy has long been saying
But the language of the Gael still lives

Although she escaped with her life from the glens
Although she's not heard in the castle
From Mackay's county in the far north
As far as Drumochter of the cattle
Nevertheless in the Western Isles
She is still the mother tongue of the people
