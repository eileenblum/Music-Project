All the angels are blind, forced to shut their eyes to slow down
And the angels won't fly, their wings were cut down as a sign
A sign to the crowd that all the good and the glory ran down
We run out of time, our time is short so follow the light

Get up and run
The guardians of holiness coming undone
I fly as you hide
Incoming darkness
I've become so

Blind, blind
I am so blind

All the angels won't cry, they've constantly dried out inside
And the angels will fall, lost lightness and turned so cold
Bloody cruelty has left this emptiness in me
Ignorance all around, so where have all my guardians gone?

Get up and run
The guardians of holiness coming undone
I fly as you hide
Incoming darkness
I've become so

Blind, blind
I am so blind

Get up and run
The guardians of holiness coming undone
I fly as you hide
Incoming darkness
I've become so

Blind, blind
I am so blind
I've become so
Blind, blind
I am so blind
Why?
