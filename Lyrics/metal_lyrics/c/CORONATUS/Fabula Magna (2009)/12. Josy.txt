I am a waitress in a temple of swing,
working every night until the morning begins
I see the people come, I see the people go
and most of all I see the whiskey flow

Yes, in the nineteen-twenties the times are hard enough now
My friend Josy disappeared, she was a dancer here

My boss is a bandit, I know where he gets his money from: illegal alcohol, even prostitution

My boyfriend Jonathan, he is a loyal man, truly wants to marry me as soon as he can
He says whenever he will find steady employment, he wants to get me out of this environment

Where is Josy? Where has she disappeared?
Where is Josy? This is a mystery!

The night of nights has finally arrived
My freedom shall no longer be deprived
But just when Janathan tried to walk off with me
My boss got a hold of us, and caught us suddenly

Where is Josy?
Where is Josy? This is a mystery!

A ghost took a bullet for me and so she saved my life
But how can this be possible that I see Josy's eyes?
Yes, in the nineteen-twenties the times are hard enough now
Who will survive until the end? The dead girls my friend!

Thanks to Damned for sending track #12 lyrics.
