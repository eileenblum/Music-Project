How far will you go:
Will you lead us to a shore
Will we find the promised land
Or will we drown and find our bitter end?
Are we in to this too deep?
The doubts go after me right in my sleep
So, how far will you go?

How far will you go? And what will this lead to (oh no)? Time will show.
You're choosing the way, we stand by your side every day.

How long can we go:
With our victuals on board
Won't the water soon run short
Or will our ship succumb to mighty storms?
Are we in to this too deep?
The doubts go after me right in my sleep
So, how long can we go?

I wonder what will we become
Tell me, will our lives overcome?
Oh, I'm asking you, how close will we stay
Reconsider what's leading you today

How far will we go:
Will we follow and obey
Will you lead us wise and strong
Or will this journey in the end go wrong?
Are we in to this too deep?
The doubts go after me right in my sleep
So, how far will we go?

How far will you go? And what will this lead to (oh no)? Time will show.
You're choosing the way, we stand by your side every day.

How far will you go?
Far will you go?
Will you go?
You go
Go!
