Odi et amo, quare id faciam, nescio
Sed fieri sentio et excrucior

No, not longer I'll try to escape
Love and hate are reflections of pain
No, nobody might force me to hope
And no, I donât want to stand this cold
No, whatever will come my way
I will welcome it as a releave

Not what you have done to me
Not what you did say
Not what you did blame on me
Just all the things we failed to do

Here we go again, we head towards horizon
We follow the path, leading to new and better days
Here we go again, we head towards horizon
We follow the path, leading to new and better life

Odi et amo, quare id faciam, nescio
Sed fieri sentio et excrucior

Now my heart will stop beating my soul
And remind me of how it began again
Yes you will feel this emptiness, too
Yes not a spark in the dark at all

Not what you have done to me
Not what you did say
Not what you did blame on me
Just all the things we failed to do

Here we go again, we head towards horizon
We follow the path, leading to new and better days
Here we go again, we head towards horizon
We follow the path, leading to new and better life

Odi et amo, quare id faciam, nescio
Sed fieri sentio et excrucior
