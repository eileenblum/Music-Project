I'm drawing pictures in the air
And I breathe like I never did before
I see the sun, I stop and stare
I can't go back now
Now that you opened the door

Be careful you caught a falling soul
Let the sun shine
Keep my heart alive
It's bleeding in your hands
It's bleeding in your hands
In your hands, oh
In your hands

I close my eyes to see your face again
I can't reach you where have you gone
I feel the sun, get up and run
To have you once again
So I can feel alive
