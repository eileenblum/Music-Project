It keeps raining in my heart
And I begin to tear apart
As my tear drops on the floor
I know I'm lost forever more

Silence pounding in my head
But I can hear you scream instead
Still I feel like I can't breathe
It's the air smothering me

Where have you gone
What has turned out so wrong
Don't run away from me
Did you turn around to see me
Hold my spirit in your hands
So my heart can break in silence
You're here but in reality
You're far away from me

The dark has overcome
There's no home no where to run
Fallen angels sinking deep on my chest
I still can't breathe

The world is so colourful
But I am black and white
The sun reflects in my eyes
And grief is, grief is the light

Dreams shattered hearts broken
And words that remain unspoken
I can speak just through my eyes
Every tear's a thousand lies

Where have you gone
What has turned out so wrong
Don't run away from me
Did you turn around to see me
Hold my spirit in your hands
So my heart can break in silence
You're here but in reality
You run, you run away from me!
