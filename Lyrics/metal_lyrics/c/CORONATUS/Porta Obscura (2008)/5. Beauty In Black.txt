She is so beautiful - it hurts my eyes
Looks like an angel - in disguise
Hides her feelings - away from my eyes
No on shall see her - when she cries

And she cries, she cries

Beauty in black -
why can't you tell me
what's wrong with you
What kind of horror
you have gone through
Put down that mask
that hides your pain from me
I'm not afraid to see
beauty in black

On her way back home -
she walked through the dark
there were no others -
as she reached the park
it wasn't her own fault -
it was her fate
No one could help her -
it was too late

Searching for a holding hand -
for the open door
Warmth is what she's longing for -
got no trust no more
She was humiliated -
treated like a whore
Her life won't be the same -
as it was before

I'M not afraid to see, to see - to see
I'm not afraid
