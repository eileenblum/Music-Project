Fourty nights and fourty days -
I've been waiting for this hour
That I meet you at this place -
and deprive you of your power
I know that you've been enchanted -
since the day that we first met
Finally destiny's granted -
us this night we won't forget

Can you feel me when I take your breath away
Angels calling cause they want to hear you pray

I can hear the angels of love,
I feel near the heavens above
I will cast my spell on you
Time stands still, the air heated well,
wine and candles spread out their smell
on you I will cast my spell
At midnight earth and heaven unite,
raising lust to infinite might
I will cast my spell, I will cast on you, I will cast my spell on you tonight

The stars came out tonight,
never I've seen them shining
the stars came out tonight,
never I've seen them shining so bright

You've been with me in my dreams
invited me to paradise
Dinner's boiling and it seems
you have composed it with your spice
Our skin so hot, salt's in between
dessert takes place one floor above
In the dark I'll play your queen
we won't forget this night of love
