It's an unknown land, full of mysteries
and full of legends,
Terra Incognita
It's a godless land, full of questions
Full of sorrows
Terra Incognita

Some say itâs evil and some say itâs holy,
could be God and devil are one.
Stories of undead and mysteries unsaid,
cause if you knew, youâd better run.

It's an unknown land, full of mysteries
and full of legends:
Terra Incognita
It's a godless land, full of questions
Full of sorrows:
Terra Incognita
Its an unknow land, full of legends,
a godless land, full of mysteries
full of sorrows, full of questions,
Terra Incognita

But an ancient land with a story so grand
should be known to every one.
Tales last for centuries, about heroes and fears,
not finding the one final truth.

It's an unknown land, full of mysteries
and full of legends,
Terra Incognita
It's a godless land, full of questions
Full of sorrows
Terra Incognita
Itâs an unknown land full of legends,
a godless land, full of mysteries.
Full of sorrow, full of questions,
Terra Incognita.
