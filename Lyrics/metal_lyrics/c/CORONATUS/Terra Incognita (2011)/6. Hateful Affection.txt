Furor amoris ira
Furor amoris ira
Furor amoris ira
Dis iratis natus.

Youâre there, when I need your care
But youâre just pain; Iâm addicted to the burning flame
Youâre there, when I need your care
So youâre a burden, but I canât tear apart this hateful affection

My skin is getting hard as stone
(the darkness is coming for you)
There is no air, my lungs stop breathing
(your lungs stop breathing)
I think your auraâs defeating me
(defeating, defeating, defeating you)

My body, my spirit, my soul
(I am coming for you)
I feel the pain inside
(I am the one inside you)
Agony says itâs not you
(I am you, the dark side of you)

Youâre there, when I need your care
But youâre just pain; Iâm addicted to the burning flame
Youâre there, when I need your care
So youâre a burden, but I canât tear apart this hateful affection

Canât believe that this madness is me
(I want to be free)
I see the picture of those who bleed
(I love the sound of its streaming)
I hear your thirst is screaming
(I love it, I love it, I want to see them screaming)

Iâll stop this never-ending hell
(you canât do anything)
Not when it means I have to kill myself
(you would not kill yourself)
And I drove the knife in my heart
(Iâm bleeding, itâs over, Iâm bleeding)
