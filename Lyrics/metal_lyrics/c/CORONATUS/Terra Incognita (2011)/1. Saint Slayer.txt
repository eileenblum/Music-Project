They claim to be the hand of god
If right or wrong they just have one thought
That what they do, is no sin, no betrayal, no fraud
They can kill, they can steel, but we know someday it will stop

Youâll pay for all the pain
Youâve caused innocent men
Saint slayer, time has come to say your prayer
Youâll pay for all the pain
Youâve caused innocent men
Saint slayer, time has come to say your prayer

Your death means  freedom for us all
Donât think youâre safe, one day you will fall
Youâre the devil in disguise, youâre a murderer of humanity
Youâre a priest from hell, you'll regret your vanity

Youâll pay for all the pain
Youâve caused innocent men
Saint slayer, time has come to say your prayer
Youâll pay for all the pain
Youâve caused innocent men
Saint slayer, time has come to say your prayer

Youâll pay for all the pain
Youâve caused innocent men
Saint slayer, time has come to say your prayer
Youâll pay for all the pain
Youâve caused innocent men
Saint slayer, time has come to say your prayer
