We told our king to meet us
We'd wait there in the rain
He had a lot to give for us
Had a lot to sing, to sing

Tables full of promises
Promised for a tale
So we told for our lives
Obeyed to his will, his will

Rosen rosebud, Rosy, Rosy mine
Rosen rosebud, Rosy, Rosy mine
Try to catch the scream, the scream of the butterfly

[2x]
Rosen rosebud, Rosy, Rosy mine
Try to catch the scream, the scream of the butterfly

While waiting
He caught us by surprise
He gave away our promises
Full of butterflies

Will you come
It hurts there in the rain
You have lots of burning castles
We have a burning will

Rosen rosebud, Rosy, Rosy mine
Rosen rosebud, Rosy, Rosy mine
Try to catch the scream, the scream of the butterfly

[2x]
Rosen rosebud, Rosy, Rosy mine
Try to catch the scream, the scream of the butterfly

I can see you downstairs, hiding in the darkness
Wheezing miserably in anxiety

I cannot see, I cannot see

I'm shivering
Freezing
Suffering
Bleeding
I'm whispering
Crying
My silent scream

[4x]
Rosen rosebud, Rosy, Rosy mine
Try to catch the scream, the scream of the butterfly
