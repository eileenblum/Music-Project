Blue young lady came across
The fire of my burning heart
Tombs of a candy rose, that young heart
Cold desire
Fading with her last breath
Fading with her last breath, my rose
Desire, my rose desire

My rose desire, my rose desire

She never had roses from a lover's hand
She never knew the breaking that a heart can do

Wild, wild, wild
She keeps her love and stays alive
Wild, wild, wild
She keeps her love and stays alive

Blue young lady came across
The fire of my burning heart
Tombs of a candy rose, that young heart
Cold desire
Fading with her last breath
Fading with her last breath, my rose
Desire, my rose desire

She never had roses from a lover's hand
She never knew the breaking that a heart can do
She never cried bitter tears when feelings died
She never knew the tenderness of me and you

Wild, wild, wild
She keeps her love and stays alive
Wild, wild, wild
She keeps her love and stays alive

Blue young lady came across
The fire of my burning heart
Tombs of a candy rose, that young heart
Cold desire
Fading with her last breath
Fading with her last breath, my rose
Desire, my rose desire

Find me rose, desire
Find me rose, desire
Come reflect my fire
Search you heart's desire
Find me rose, desire
Find me rose, desire
Come reflect my fire
Find me rose, desire
My rose desire, my rose desire...
