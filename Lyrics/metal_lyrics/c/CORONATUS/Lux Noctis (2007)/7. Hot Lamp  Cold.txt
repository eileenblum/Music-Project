You have retired
In a room that's just for you
You don't talk all day
Want to be left in peace to build up strength

You know you're sexy
And that you're popular
You're acting so cool
If I sat next to you I would freeze like ice

But when the day grows older
And when the night gets colder
You suddenly approach to me
And as you treated me, I will now treat you

I am gonna make you hot, I'll make you hot
And right then when you're hot I'll leave you cold, I'll leave you cold
I am gonna make you hot, I'll make you hot
And it's cool that when you're hot I'll leave you cold, hot and cold

You make me angry
And so unconscious, too
Your words are just short
When you open your mouth, a dagger in my heart

But when the dayâs passed
At night we are a team
I found the right words
When the right words are found you thaw like ice

But when the day grows older
And when the night gets colder
You suddenly approach to me
And as you treated me, I will now treat you

I am gonna make you hot, I'll make you hot
And right then when you're hot I'll leave you cold, I'll leave you cold
I am gonna make you hot, I'll make you hot
And it's cool that when you're hot I'll leave you cold, hot and cold

And when the day grows older
And when the night gets colder
You suddenly approach to me
As you treated me, I will now treat you

I am gonna make you hot, I'll make you hot
And right then when you're hot I'll leave you cold, I'll leave you cold
I am gonna make you hot, I'll make you hot
And it's cool that when you're hot I'll leave you cold, hot and cold
