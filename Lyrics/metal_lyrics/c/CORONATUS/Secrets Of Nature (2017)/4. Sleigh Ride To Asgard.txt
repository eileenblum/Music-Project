Forest in winter,
A sleigh-ride through the snowy woods.
The reindeer are running,
They pull the sledge onward a mystic

Pathway to Asgard,
The home of northern gods and heroes
Heaven to vikings
And all the other folks of Midgard
Lead us to Asgard
We'll find a way to overcome the gate,
To overcome the bridge between the worlds

Sliding through the snow,
Snowflakes in your hair,
The reindeer run along,
Increasing speed is fair,

Sparkling lights appear,
Underneath our skids,
The reindeer roll their eyes,
A magic whip them hits,

Lightning all around
But without a sound
The sky is ripped ahead
And then we leave the ground

The shiny rip reveals
Bifrost's mighty shape
A rainbow-colored build
From where there's no escape

When the reindeer's hooves the first time
Hit on the bridge
A sound arises like bells made of ice
A wall of fire explodes to the sky

Asgard is calling...

Bifrost's fiery wall
Fight off giants' raid
Odin's strong defense
The toll with life is paid

A magic shield around
Our carriage
It prevents us from
The deadly fire edge

We are breaking through
Through the fiery wall
And ahead we see
A strongholds mighty halls

And in front of it
Stands the guardian
A mighty warrior,
And real tragedian

Eternal guardian and keeper of Gjallarhorn
The horn to blow for the final battle
Due to our magic we slip through unseen

Asgard is calling...

At last arrived alive
There lie the halls
Glare in the silvery light

Forest in winter,
A sleigh-ride through the snowy woods.
The reindeer's are running,
They pull the sledge onward a mystic

Asgard is calling
The home of northern gods and heroes
Heaven to vikings
And all the other folks of Midgard
Lead us to Asgard
We'll find a way to overcome the gate,
To reach and cross the bridge that leads to

Asgard, it's calling....
