Golden eagle
Diving in the blue mountain sky
Realm of a ruler
Living on the mountain so high.

Here in the heavens,
Gliding along steep mountain sides.
In this proud living
Only pure freedom hides.

Power!
Is streaming out of the sky!
You shiver from energy,
Power runs through your veins,
Opens your mind to the high!
Feel it!
A force runs from down the sky!
Invisible golden beam
Powers your body and
Tickles your skin like a dream.

Experience of such mighty
And all heart-catching sight
Will open up ways
And channels to an unexplored height.

Natural forces
Made of a mystical kind.
Referencing powers
Included in the deep of minds

Power...

Eagles are flying
High above the steep mountain sides.
Such a proud living
Opens up a mind so wide.

Within
Blue mountain sky
Gliding along
The eagles won't die.
All of this pride,
All of this might,
Just feel the flow of the....

Power...
