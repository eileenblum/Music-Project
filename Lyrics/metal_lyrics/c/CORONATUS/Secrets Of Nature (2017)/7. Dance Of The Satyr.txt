Deep in the woods lies a gladem
Green and bright, wonderful,
Gentle light bleaks through leaves,
Mellow shades mask a shape of a wild

It's the dance of the satyr
It's the dance of the satyr
The dance of the satyr
The dance of the satyr

All around this fine glade,
Moves his hooves, shakes his horns,
To a tune, of a flute,
Audibly, only to
Creatures of, other worlds

Fast move his hips,
Spins around, cross the glade,
Prance in rut, bounce in heat,
To the beat of the tune of a wild
It's the dance of the satyr...
