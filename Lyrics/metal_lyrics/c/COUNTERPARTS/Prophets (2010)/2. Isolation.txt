The best news I've ever heard was when you said you wouldn't leave
Because I know the distance would tear us apart.

And all the things you say wouldn't mean a thing if you weren't here with me.

So as you turn your back to me,
I just want to let you know I would never do this to you.
Let's go!
This is where our roads divide and they split in two,
And I will never see you again.
I will never see you again.

But I respect your choice.

The familiar pain sets in again,
And I won't let this bring me down.
It's things like this that made me who I am today.

It's thing like this that helped to shape/make me who I am today,
It's every hardship that I've faced.
Oh!

And I've lost hope in myself,
And I just want you to know:
As everyday goes by, everyday goes by...
As everyday goes by, everyday goes by
I must accept that you're now living your own life.
