We are quickly being led to an early grave
By the ones that were meant to nourish our growth.
And though their influence is the tallest barrier that we are left to face,
We can overcome this.
It's us against this fucking world.
But, we are armed with hope and heart,
And we're unbreakable. this is an uprising,
And we will be the ones left standing.
And if you answer this calling,
I promise you that we will remain true to ourselves,
And we can put this all behind us.
Confide in us, and we'll confide in you.
And together we are unstoppable.
We're taking back what belongs to us.
(We need to find a different way,
A way to stay true to who we are,
And and a way to overcome this.
