Iâve never told this to anyone. Iâve just tried to move past.
But lately it seems that my insecurities have got the best of me. And Iâm no
longer in control. No one should ever have to feel like this. To feel like me.
Even though the good I have outweighs the bad, the bad is whatâs leaving me
with sleepless nights. I spend most of my time arguing with my own reflection.
For no apparent reason. And it may seem as if I have all the answers, but Iâm
just as lost as you. Iâve spend the past few years trying to overcome my own
misery, but these sort of things take time, and Iâm running out of mine. So I
will pray to a God that isnât there, to a world that doesnât hear, to anyone
who will listen, to keep me from becoming everything I promised myself that I
would never be. I do not deserve this.
