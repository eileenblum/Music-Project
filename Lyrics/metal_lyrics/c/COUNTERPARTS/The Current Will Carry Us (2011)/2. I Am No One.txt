Every fucking day, I have to deal with the pressure I put on
myself, to outdo myself. But I canât ask for help, I canât admit Iâm weak. Iâm
going back on my words, Iâm going back on who I used to be. I canât take it
anymore. Every day I wage a war on myself because Iâd rather die than let this
win over me. I canât let this win over me. How can I be expected to help anyone
else, when I canât even help myself? Call me a hypocrite and Iâll be the first
one to agree. I am no longer the prophet I once claimed to be. Iâm stuck
between trying to find where I stand, and what it is I stand for. I am no one.
