This is the only thing I have worth holding onto. I have
condensed my past to fit the lines on the pages that no one will ever see. But
still I fight, day after day. âCause this is all Iâve ever wanted my life to be
and I push everything Iâve ever loved away to keep myself from sinking. If I
find the bad in everything, I can never be attached. Iâm trying to find a
balance, trying to find my way, and every choice Iâve ever made brings me
anywhere but home. But Iâve welcomed sacrifice with open arms, and I will never
regret my decision. This is the only thing I have worth holding on to. This is
the only thing that makes me feel alive. Iâve simply been searching for the
right place to rest my head. Iâm searching for common ground between all that I
am, and all that you need me to be. Iâve seen a future and want nothing to do
with it. A constant campaign to impress those who never ever cared.  Iâm
struggling but I wonât allow myself to sink. You know where to find me. I keep
my composure and assume my place, in front of the people I love most. Youâre
the reason why weâre here. Iâm struggling, but I wonât allow myself to sink.
