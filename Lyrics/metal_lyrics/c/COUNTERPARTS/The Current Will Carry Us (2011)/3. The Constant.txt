I will graciously accept that my lifeâs work, whether it be
in the past, the present, or the future will be overshadowed by those around me
with a different definition of âsuccess.â Though I canât explain the path Iâve
chosen, all I know is Iâm right where I need to be. And though Iâve turned down
a chance at fame and fortune, I know that there is no greater payment than
this. And Iâm so fucking far from the life Iâm supposed to lead, and the man
Iâm supposed to be and I couldnât be happier. And I will remain a constant, I
know where I stand, and I refuse to let their selfishness take control of who I
am. While I may die poor, at least my life had meaning, thereâs more to life
than living, and I truly feel alive. And I know that when I die, there will be
others who feel the same way ready to take my place.  This is our song of
protest. I promise you that nothing is slowing us down. While I may die poor,
at least my life had meaning, thereâs more to life than living and I truly feel
alive. And I know that when I die, there will be others who feel the same way
ready to take my place. I will laugh in the face of those who tell me
different. Even with both of my feet planted firmly on the ground, I am free to
move in my own direction. I will remain a constant. I know where I stand.
