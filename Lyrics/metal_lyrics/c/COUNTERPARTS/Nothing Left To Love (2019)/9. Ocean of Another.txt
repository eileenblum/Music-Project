Tear the tears out of my open eyes
For I no longer need to drown
In the ocean of another
Tear the tears out of my open eyes
Above a buried garden we've both lived in
And bring me back to life

I promised I'd be devoid of devotion
Until a blinding light could thaw me from my core
Shining between the lips of lacerations
As we compare the way that we burn to the sun

Throw yourself into the middle of my arms
And I swear I'll keep you safe
The scars that you keep secret were placed upon my limbs
And I would fill them in with my flesh if I could

I swear I'll keep you safe

Tear the tears out of my open eyes
For I no longer need to drown
In the ocean of another
Tear the tears out of my open eyes
Above a buried garden we've both lived in
And bring me back to life

Pull the nameless arrow from my chest
And exchange it with your own

Replace the hurt within me with a stare
That watches over me
When I allow myself to sleep

The scars that you keep secret were placed upon my limbs
And I would fill them in with my flesh if I could

Throw yourself into the middle of my arms
And I swear I'll keep you safe

Tear the tears out of my open eyes
For I no longer need to drown
In the ocean of another
Tear the tears out of my open eyes
Above a buried garden we've both lived in
To bring me back to life
