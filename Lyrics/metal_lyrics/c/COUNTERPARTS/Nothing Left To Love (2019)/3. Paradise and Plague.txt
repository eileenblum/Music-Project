Warn only those who choose to hear a disappearing trail of death
So spare me your sentiments and accept me as I am

Salvation reaches out through familiar screams, begging me to stay
Reserve your mourning for the dead who wish they had but one day left
No need to waste your grief on me, I'm with you now

Will the ones I love forgive me for leaving too soon?
Caught in the space between paradise and plague
There's nowhere I'd rather be than with you

Warn only those who choose to hear a disappearing trail of death
Abandon the hope you had and accept me as I am

No one could save me
I was born inside my grave

No one could save me
I was born inside my grave

Reserve your mourning for the dead who wish they had but one day left
No need to waste your grief on me, I'm with you now

Will the ones I love forgive me for leaving too soon?
Caught in the space between paradise and plague
There's nowhere I'd rather be than with you
There's nowhere I'd rather be than with you
There's nowhere I'd rather be than with you
