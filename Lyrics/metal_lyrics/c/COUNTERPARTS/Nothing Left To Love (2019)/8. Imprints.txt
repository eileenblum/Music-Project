Hands of hesitation intersect and leave me dead
Sharpening their edges inches from my neck
Inhaling the uncertainty that hangs above my head
With portraits of my death carved into my chest

Running without feeling in our legs
We don't appreciate the cuts that we've collected
Drifting through a swarm of thorns
As our agony reminds us these scars were self-inflicted

I'll give you every second until I'm gone
I hate it here and never want to leave

I hoped this flame would burn forever
And I'll give you every second until I'm gone
Staring in the face of my own fate
I hate it here and never want to leave

The imprints I have left will surely fade
But the memories remind us we shared the same pain

I'll give you every second until I'm gone
I hate it here and never want to leave

I hoped this flame would burn forever
And I'll give you every second until I'm gone
Staring in the face of my own fate
I hate it here and never want to leave

I will incinerate myself
In my own circle of hell
A blind world won't read my lips
Though it might hear my faint farewell

I will incinerate myself
In my own circle of hell
A blind world won't read my lips
Though it might hear my faint farewell

All living things will starve
Cradled in complacency
Content inside the coffin I've created
I hate it here and never want to leave
