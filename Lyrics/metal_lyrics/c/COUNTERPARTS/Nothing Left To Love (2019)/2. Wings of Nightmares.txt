I'm clinging to the wings of nightmares
Detaching every finger one by one
Shaken awake to find our absence hasn't manifested yet
Longing for a sense of loss
Picking me apart like birds of prey
Where illusions will depart from unhinged jaws
Silent in the presence of your name

Rip the memory from my mind
Perfectly still but somehow running out of time

Keep your distance
From the flowers that will decorate my corpse
Undeserving of a chance to watch them thrive
Remove the sickness
Before it has a chance to run its course
I knew we'd never make it out alive

Clairvoyant only to delusion
As you salvage fantasy to fit your needs
You held my lifeless body to your heart
And convinced yourself that could feel a pulse
(Laying traps beneath my feet)
(I will chew through to the bone in my desire to be free)

Rip the memory from my mind
Perfectly still but somehow running out of time

Keep your distance
From the flowers that will decorate my corpse
Undeserving of a chance to watch them thrive
Remove the sickness
Before it has a chance to run its course
I knew we'd never make it out alive

Your shadow will keep me blinded by the light living in lies
Allowing fallen petals to turn black
Reflecting the colour of your insides

Rip the memory from my mind
Hold my lifeless body to your heart
And convince yourself that you still feel a pulse
Rip the memory from my mind
Perfectly still but somehow running out of time
