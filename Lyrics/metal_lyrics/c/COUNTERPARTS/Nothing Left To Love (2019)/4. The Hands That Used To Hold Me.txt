Hold my eyelids open and secure my hanging head
Digging shards of bone from both our feet
Removing teeth to free what's left of sentences unsaid
Ensuring my last breath echoes relief

We ignore the sound of two dissolving souls
As our home disintegrates into a grave
Rebuilt above burnt earth to be sure
Nothing else can grow

You left as I was dreaming
But when I opened my eyes
You swore you were still here

Preserving footprints in the colour of our blood
And as our veins ran dry you swore you were still here

Suffocate me in my sleep
The weight of my belief will bury me
Suffocate me in my sleep
The weight of my belief will bury me

I felt your presence fleeing long before you took your leave
You swore you were still here
Leaving small incisions in the hands that used to hold me

And as our veins ran dry you swore you were still here

Hold my eyelids open and secure my hanging head
Digging shards of bone from both our feet
Removing teeth to free what's left of sentences unsaid
Ensuring my last breath echoes relief

We ignore the sound of two dissolving souls
As our home disintegrates into a grave
Rebuilt above burnt earth to be sure
Nothing else can grow

You swore you were still here
You swore you were still here
