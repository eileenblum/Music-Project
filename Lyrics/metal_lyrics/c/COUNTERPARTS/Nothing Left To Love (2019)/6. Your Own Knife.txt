Resurface from contaminated soil when you're starved
As the poison thins your blood, drown in your dependence
Writing a false doctrine in which you portray a victim
While we both know I'm the reason you were spared

I should have let you die
And I live with the regret of my decision
I should have let you die
And the day will come when I will be the reason you repent

You threw yourself onto your own knife
I should have let you die

No man but me can disfigure my creation
I will absolve you of your sins and hurl you into hell myself

Your senses can no longer recognize my saving grace
As the poison thins your blood, drown in your dependence
Silently securing your neck within my noose
To mirror your vicious transgressions

No man but me can disfigure my creation
I will absolve you of your sins and hurl you into hell myself

I should have let you die
I should have let you die
I should have let you die

(I should have let you die)
