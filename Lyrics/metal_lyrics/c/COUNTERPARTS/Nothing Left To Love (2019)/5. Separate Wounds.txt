Numbing the nerve endings in my arms to endure a vain embrace
Exhausted by the light leaving our eyes
Our leap of faith will lead us to a bed of blades
Remove the skin and reveal to me the likeness of a ghost
As teardrops find their way towards my throat
Our leap of faith will lead us to a bed of blades
Descending from the heaven we created in our heads

We both bleed (We both bleed)
But out of separate wounds
Not meant to mend a different breed of broken
Pulling the cure out of the suffering themselves
We are two different breeds of broken

Remove the skin and reveal to me the likeness of a ghost
As teardrops find their way towards my throat
I'd sooner die with the deserted than coexist amidst feigned love
Bringing your hands towards the sky, expecting me to cast myself down

We are two different breeds of broken
Our leap of faith will lead us to a bed of blades
Descending from the heaven we created in our heads

We both bleed, but out of separate wounds
Not meant to mend a different breed of broken
Pulling the cure out of the suffering themselves
We are two different breeds of broken
We are two different breeds of broken
