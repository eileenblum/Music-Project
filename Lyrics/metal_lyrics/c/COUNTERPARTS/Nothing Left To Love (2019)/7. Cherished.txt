I am the dagger
I will drive into my heart
To drain myself of my impurity

Abandoned at conception
Feeding off affection left behind
I'll never know acceptance
If people only come to me to die

All I've cherished will run from my embrace
Nothing will stay, nothing will stay
Dwell in my debris
Never knowing how it feels to be at peace
Nothing will stay

A confidence I could never conceive
When the weight of insecurity becomes too much to bear
Perception will deceive me
Losing sight as I stare into a razor
To be rewarded collections of my flaws

I am the dagger
I will drive into my heart
I am the dagger
I will drive into my heart
To drain myself of my impurity
I am the blade forced into my face
Rearranging features for the pleasure of perfection

Losing sight as I stare into a razor
To be rewarded collections of my flaws

All I've cherished will run from my embrace
Nothing will stay, nothing will stay
Dwell in my debris
Never knowing how it feels to be at peace
Nothing will stay, nothing will stay
All I've cherished will run from my embrace
Nothing will stay, nothing will stay
