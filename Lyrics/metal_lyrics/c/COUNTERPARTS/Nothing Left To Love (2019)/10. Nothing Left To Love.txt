I long to run
Hand in hand with angels
To feel the grace
Of shattered glass against my wrist

Did the mother of god cry for her son?
Will mine suffer the same before I'm gone?
The last thing I will see is my own face
As I float between two worlds

I long to run
Hand in hand with angels
To feel the grace
Of shattered glass against my wrist
Don't weep for me
I will shine brighter from above
To feel the need
For the first time as I leave

Did the mother of god cry for her son?
Even though she knew this day would come
Before I'm gone the stations of the cross
Serve as reminders of the closest things we've lost

(Nothing left to love)
Will you love me when there's nothing left to love?
Will you love me when there's nothing left to love?
Will you love me when there's nothing left to love?
Will you love me when there's nothing left to love?
Love me when there's nothing left to love?
Love me when there's nothing left to love?
Love me
When there's nothing left to love?

Nothing left to love
Nothing left to love
Nothing left to love
Nothing left to love
Nothing left to love
Nothing left to love
Nothing left to love
