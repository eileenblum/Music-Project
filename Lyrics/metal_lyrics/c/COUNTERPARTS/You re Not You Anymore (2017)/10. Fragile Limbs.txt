Dissolving in small oceans.
Responsible for concentrating currents to match a pulse in us that no longer exists.
Resurfacing only when we're running out of air.
Apprehensive from our absent-heartedness.
Spitting blood from confidence confessed.
Inducing dreams in which we never met to rid myself to regret.
We were a pair of fragile limbs, too weak to carry us to bed.
Stretched so thin but somehow burning at both ends.
Foreshadowing the pain of transferring dead weight, while we can barely stay awake.
A self inflicted severance will seal our fate.
Let it die.
We had to let this die.
Dissolving in small oceans like the salt into our wounds.
To match the pulse in us that no longer exists.
We were a pair of fragile limbs, too weak to carry us to bed.
Stretched so thin but somehow burning at both ends.
