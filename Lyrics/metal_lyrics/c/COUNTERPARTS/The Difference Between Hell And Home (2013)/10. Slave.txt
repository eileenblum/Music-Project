If I allow the light to leave my eyes
I will never see again
The thoughts disintegrate into cognitive pollution
Abandoning my body, renouncing my existence
Show me the meaning of happiness

Trapped inside this nightmare
But I haven't slept for days
I am a slave
A slave to what I cannot see
Are we being strung along or are we just strung out?

The quest to be clairvoyant:
You are your own black hole
How much longer do I really have
When I wish every breath would be my last?

Your words like rope
Tied around my throat
Remove the earth beneath me
Watch my spirit sink
