Born of two; raised by four
I guess I took it all for granted
And only three remain

Even though you're wounded
I know that you're still here
I don't blame you
You just can't face the change

We spend our golden years as living ghosts
Caught in a constant state of purgatory
We are only burdened by our memories
Until the day they cease to exist
And we follow shortly after

Although I wonder if at any time
Our minds fell upon the same plane
I know they did
I just wish I had a chance to go back and appreciate it
But we'll always have the winter
And the snow that got you trapped behind the glass
You may be only a shell of the man that you used to be
But I love you just the same
And I will until the day you're gone

I just never know if I'm communicating with you or the disease
And even though I curse the idea of an afterlife
I still hope you're taken care of
You deserve to be at peace
Please don't forget my face
I won't forget to remember you
