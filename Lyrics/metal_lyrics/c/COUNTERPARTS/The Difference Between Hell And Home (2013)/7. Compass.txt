The weight came and went and took my will to live
Spoiled by defeat, forced to drown in what's left of me
That's when breathing became routine
And I could feel myself fading

No direction, I am a compass
Constantly spinning
Constantly searching for the end
Never reaching our destination
But the goal was never when
Or where
Or who...
It was only you

I appeared in your arms as if I had been born there
You promised you'd never let me go
But I don't know what I believe anymore
Affection allowed me to let the light in
The fear made me whole again
Help me rebuild my broken bones
Help me regain my sanity
But with caution always present
Our pasts manifest themselves
And we act as if this is what we deserve
But I refuse to fail again

I'd force my ghost to write your name in the flowers on my grave
I watched the world give up on me

I used to spend my nights praying for air in my bloodstream
Now I long to feel your breath pass throughout my arteries
The goal was never when
Or where
Or who...
It was only you

I appeared in your arms as if I had been born there
You promised you'd never let me go
But I don't know what I believe anymore
Fill me with your faith and let me leave

I'm scratching at my skin to take my mind
Off the absence we've created
The lines blur together like the veins in my arms
And I wish I wasn't so alone
You are the difference between hell and home
