Everything ends
At least that's what we hope for
Plagued by our past
And we're doomed to repeat ourselves

Afraid of the thoughts that dance in revolutions
And circle the mind like a snake
Binding me
I'm just trying to feel something

Cold and stale
Searching for warmth inside of every promise wasted
You wrap yourself around me
But I can only sense your presence
You're nothing but a carcass

I've never felt more alone than I did on those nights
I spent watching you sleep
You're the furthest thing from me
And you've been there from the start

An empty shell
You're vacant and it scares me to death
One by one
I watched them leave me behind like living debris
Fortunately, I know that I'm not worth it
In my purest form, I was never good enough for anyone
Why did I think that this time it'd be different?

I came bearing only the beat of my heart
And the best of my intentions

I tried my hardest but I couldn't make you feel a fucking thing
