Expose me for all that I am
The man behind the masquerade
I am my own false witness

Fact resides solely in the depths of my mind
And will I ever really let it come to surface?
You only see what I want you to see
And you believe all that you're told

Serenity is a beautiful hoax, a liar
I have the whole world convinced of my contentment
No truth in this
I've lost count of all the times I've made it home alive...
And wished I hadn't

Expose me for all that I am
The man behind the masquerade
I am my own false witness
I'm left to conquer the mountains in my mind
And I am my maker

Life is what's killing me
I hate the fact that I'm just fine
Forever seeking anything to take responsibility
Life is what's killing me
I hate the fact that I'm alive
Forever searching for my scapegoat because
I refuse to face reality

At least I can say I tried to cherish
Every single day when I woke up and didn't want to die
I'd work my hands to the bone
Trying to stay suspended in those specific seconds
But I know I'm just counting down the minutes
Until I'm miserable again
