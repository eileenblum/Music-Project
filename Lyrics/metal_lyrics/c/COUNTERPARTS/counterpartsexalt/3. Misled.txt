We have become mere filth beneath your feet.
Thrown back and forth from the views we kept close to our hearts.
We've been misled, we've been counted out.
A fleeting high for an empty life that we were told to strive for.
Caught in a prison - paralyzed by impurity.
Taught to be starved - of our surroundings. 
Carried by our apparent friends, we surrender morality, to gain vanity, and to find a new home. 
We like the think that we're growing up, buried in holes that our hands have made, we believe that the world revolves around us. 
I live in toil, I'm looking for something I can't find, I'm searching for solace, I'll keep hunting for something so contrived. 

Eyes never felt so pure, I was searching for solace with intentions wrong. 
Eyes never felt so pure, I was searching for solace. 
My heart never felt so pure, I was searching for love with intentions wrong. 
Heart never felt so pure, I was searching for me.
