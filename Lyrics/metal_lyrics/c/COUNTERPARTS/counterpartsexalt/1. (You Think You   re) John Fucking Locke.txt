The most common insecurity is our destination after our conscious fades away. The biggest factor in how one molds their existence, is nothing more than a distraction from what is really important; who we are in the present. I know in my heart the life I lead now means more to this world, than any "reward" I may receive after death. I know this to be the truth. I refuse to sacrifice the life that I've been given in the hopes of something greater, when all I need is right in front of me. Because I believe in man, I believe in myself, and nothing else. I can't put my faith in uncertainty. While there's still no proof of validity amongst the old familiar pages, which to me are nothing more than fucking words. I  will choose life over faith, and I will put my trust back in myself. And then I'll be free. Together we can eliminate the worry and the fear from the minds and hearts of our fellow man. I know in my heart who I need to be.
