We were in way over our heads, held close to old habits. 
Brought down by past regrets and I hope you come to find that it all comes back to you. 
I know that you will probably, never hear these words. 
Love come undone, for us all, for the hopeful words. 
Come undone, for us all and let false hope live on. 
And only in my mind has this distance become discovered. 
Walking the tightrope in between love and insecurity but I'm torn. 
Broken homes for broken souls, in this bed of nails I'll stay. 
Love come undone, for us all, for the hopeful words. 
Come undone, for us all and let false hope live on. 
Let false hope live on.
