We shiver in the pause between words. Abandonment still fresh upon the tips of our tongues. The whispers weâve chosen to live and die in will infect deaf ears with the discordance of deceit. Why do we scream when there is nothing left to say? Silently acknowledging the
solace in loss. I am content with throwing everything away because I lost myself when I found you. Carry me back to your bed, my conscience is my coffin and I swear sometimes Iâd rather be dead. Make sure that I still feel, I donât care how much it hurts. Iâll always be
numb on my side of the earth. In the dark I watched the light hit your skin, hoping that my eyes might never adjust. Soft sounds save me from the confines of sleep because hearing your voice once was never enough. I think Iâve finally identified the Difference. I think I
live in both my hell and my home. I will forever be a slave to your distance, donât let me in, donât let me go. Carry me back to your bed, my conscience is my coffin and I swear sometimes Iâd rather be dead. Make sure that I still feel, I donât care how much it hurts.
Iâll always be numb on my side of the earth. Donât let me in, donât let me go. (In this moment) Iâd rather die than live without you. Iâd rather die.
