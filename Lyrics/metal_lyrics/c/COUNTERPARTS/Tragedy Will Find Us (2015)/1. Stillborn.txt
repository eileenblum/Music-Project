A calm rushes over me as I picture my corpse ill-fated with the faults I canât escape. A sigh of relief used to signify the blight that infects the last few fragments of my skull. Sometimes I swear I think that Iâll be fine. Iâve made up my mind. Death is my birthright.
I am a noose waiting to be tied. Still I try to elude the truth and embrace my disguise because this way of life takes itâs toll on mine and I donât want to be alive. Bury me breathing so I can watch myself decay. We are stillborns by definition but our pulse-infected
wrists will disagree. We burden ourselves with intent and ambition when weâve accepted that all hope is lost. So dance past my lips and disperse, leaving no trace of human condition. Our bodies blind the world with a sense of selflessness that only a trained eye can see.
You blame me for your blindness. Open your eyes.
