Back-pedaling into the black
But I can still make out the figures
That will threaten my well-being
The wind will rise and fall
But never sway from side to side

Progression halted
Encapsulating the fluid weave of death
Like a garden that contains all of its arrested offspring
Weâre afraid to force our legs to break free from the earth
And take the first step towards our insecurity

Sleep away your selfishness
Slip into collapse
A still-like state of disregard
From which you canât fall back
You never fully moved me
Iâve been embedded in the dust
And my mind has been ravaged by war

Pray for farewell as if I was yours to lose
I would love to love you, if you were someone else
So forgive me for being unresponsive
Iâm sure itâs hard to train your ears
To hear me crying out for help
With my lips sewn shut by the stitches of my own indecision

So Iâll speak in whispers to permit my throat relief
I bite my tongue
Fill my mouth with blood
And swallow enough to kill me
Before Iâm forced to lose more sleep
So Iâll speak in whispers to permit my throat relief
I bite my tongue
Fill my mouth with blood
And swallow enough to kill me

I would love to love you
If you were someone else
Am I fit to walk alone again
Or will you save me from myself?
Breathe life into me
Be all that I can see
Or carry on without me
And just know I wished you well
