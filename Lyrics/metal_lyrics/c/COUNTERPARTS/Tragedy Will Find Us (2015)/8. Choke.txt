Congregate what little ounce of decency is left and gather enough courage to invoke contractions in your vocal chords. Admission of guilt through confrontation. Iâve had to chisel every lie out of your mouth and after all this time Iâve grown immune to your embrace.
Spare me and my virgin ears from a stale conception. Admit that Iâm the victim and cradle consequence. Line your insides with a sense of wrongly obtained righteousness. Spread your poison as thin as you possibly can to ensure you violate every inch of common ground. Call
me a cancer, keep convinced that youâre not sick yourself. You will be exposed as soon as the worlds eyes can fully adjust to the dark. I was the cure to your corrosion, but now I want to watch your skin rust and slowly grow discolouredâ¦ and when your throat buckles
under the weight of the accumulation of perjury, I want to watch the life seep out of your tear duct as your death rattle hits my eardrum and thaws whatâs left of my cold heart. I hope you choke to death. The compass has been crackedâ¦ I hope you fucking choke to death.
