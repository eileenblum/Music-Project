Immerse yourself in the water that flows freely from my hands. Youâll find no substance, just the rain that we use to simply bathe and disregard. I bless my arteries with blades, and I welcome the sight of the back of my eyelids. In our most peaceful and remote state,
weâre allowed to choose what we want to feel. Mortality is the greatest gift given to the living, but a curse to those who feel that theyâre truly alive. Sentenced to trespass, I should spin towards the northâ¦ but your gravity has left me alone and Iâm left to roam as an
apparition. Abandoned, I am a phantom limb in search of a frame to spread my plague. If the light leaves you blind, just shut your eyes and embrace the undertow. Let the waves puncture your lungs. In my dreams we drown together. Everything goes black but I can see you
just fine. Condolences flourish and fall upon my feet and help pollinate the dirt that sits in the pit of your stomach. I need to shed the idea of a lasting impression. Make peace with my spirit breach. Everything goes black and I still see you in my dreams. Lower your
head to sleep and let me do the same. Iâm confident that we will meet again, every time you wade in a body of water. I am the light that leaves you blind, but I watched you retreat and cover your eyes. In your rivers I reside. In dreams we drown together. Everything goes
black but you will see me just fine.
