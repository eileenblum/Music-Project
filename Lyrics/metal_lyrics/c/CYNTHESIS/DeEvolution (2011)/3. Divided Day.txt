[Music: Jasun Tipton / Lyrics: Erik Rosvold]

I AWAKEN IN THE NIGHT
BUT IT JUST MIGHT BE
THE DAWN OR THE DAY
HUMMING MACHINES SOUND
I'VE SEEMED TO HAVE DROWN
IN A SEA OF CHANGE

CAN I REALLY PERCEIVE?
CAN I REALLY BELIEVE?
IN THIS NEW-BORN DREAM
HERE THEY COME AGAIN
TO IMPLEMENT TO IMPLANT ME WITH THEIR SCHEME

LIES
CLOUDING EYES
WITH "HOLY" WATER
TO RENDER BLIND
TO DEFEND DEFEAT AND TO CONQUER

I'M YOUR LIFE I AM YOUR SAVIOR
ALWAYS NOW AND FOREVER
I'M YOUR LIFE I AM YOUR SAVIOR
DO NOT THINK THAT YOU WERE NEVER
MORE THAN YOU WERE EVER SHOWN
SO COME IN DON'T GO OUT ALONE
FOLLOW ME AND YOU WILL SEE
I'LL RELEASE THE DEITY

LIES
TOO MANY TIES
TO SO-CALLED FATHERS
TO LOOSEN AND UNBIND
TO RIP TO SHRED TO TEAR ASUNDER

I'M YOUR LIFE I AM YOUR SAVIOR
ALWAYS NOW AND FOREVER
I'M YOUR LIFE I AM YOUR SAVIOR
DO NOT THAT THAT YOU WERE NEVER
MORE THAN YOU WERE EVER SHOWN
SO COME IN DON'T GO OUT ALONE
FOLLOW ME AND YOU WILL SEE
I'LL RELEASE THE DEITY

DENY YOUR MAKER
DENY YOUR MAKER
DEFINE YOUR MAKER
I AM YOUR MAKER

NOW THEY SEE THE WINDOW
THE WAY THEY MUST GO
TO WIPE AWAY THE SHADOWS
AND THE DUST TOO
TO LEAVE IN ASHES
TO FORGIVE THE PRESENT TOO
AND THROUGH THAT WINDOW
I WILL GUIDE THEM THROUGH
