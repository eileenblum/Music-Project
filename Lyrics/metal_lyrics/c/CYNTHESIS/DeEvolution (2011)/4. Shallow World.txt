[Music: Jasun Tipton / Lyrics: Erik Rosvold]

THEY ARE HUMAN BEING BUT THEY ARE NOT HUMANE
ILLUSION IS THE SOLUTION IN THIS MAGICIANS [sic] GAME
I SHOW THEM ONLY SHADOWS TO MAKE IT APPEAR
THAT THE TRUTH IS SO SIMPLE BENIGN AND SINCERE
TO PACIFY TO OCCUPY TO GENTRIFY TO SOLIDIFY

THIS IS ALL WE'VE EVER MEANT YOU TO BE
JUST LOOK IN AMAZEMENT AT THE FLICKERING SCREENS
THE COMMANDS ARE LISTED HERE FOR ALL TO SEE
CAMERAS' EYE EVERYWHERE STILL YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE FREE
IN STATUS AND IN STATE TO ANYONE TO ANY FATE

STAY RIGHT IN LINE DON'T YOU EVER STEP ASIDE
NEVER THINK FOR YOURSELVES FOR I WILL ABIDE
YOU ARE NOT ALONE YOU'LL NEVER BE ALONE
FOR I AM HERE BESIDE WATCHING THE MINDS DECLINE

WE'LL KEEP YOUR [sic: sung as YOU] ATTRACTED TO ALL OUR DISTRACTIONS
ERASING ANY DOUBTS AND CRUSHING ALL FACTIONS
SO BECOME A HEATHEN WITHIN OUR NEW HEAVEN
NO NEED TO EVER THINK AS TO WHAT IT ALL MAY MEAN
