[Music: Jasun Tipton / Lyrics: Erik Rosvold]

YOUR LACK OF SELF WILL DRAIN YOU
SO YOU WILL CONSUME ANYTHING
FROM A HAVE NOT TO A MUST HAVE
THE COMFORT [sic: sung as COMFORTS] THAT SOME THINGS BRING

WE MAKE YOU FEEL ALONE JUST ANOTHER DRONE ANONYMOUS UNKNOWN
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE YOU TREASURE YOUR WEALTH SIN NOW AND PAY LATER

FROM MANUFACTURED INSECURITIES
TO SILVER TO RINGS OF GOLD
YOUR IMAGE IS ALL THAT YOU ARE
ALL YOU ARE IS WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TOLD

SO BY AND BY YOU WILL BUY
INTO A SLOW MOTION SUICIDE
OBSESSED WITH YOUR POSSESSIONS
ADDICTED TO YOUR PRETENSIONS
WOULD YOU TRADE YOUR LIFE FOR JUST ONE DIME?

AND SO YOU WILL BLEED
DROWNED BY THE ENDLESS NEED

AND SO IT WILL FEED
THE GREAT GREEN GOD KNOWN AS GREED

YOU BEG FOR MORE FOR ALL YOU ADORE
ALL IS HERE BUT BEWARE
THE AWE LASTS FOR ONLY A MINUTE
AWFULLY STILL IN YOUR DESPAIR

SO BY AND BY YOU WILL BUY
INTO A SLOW MOTION SUICIDE
OBSESSED WITH YOUR POSSESSIONS
ADDICTED TO YOUR PRETENSIONS
WOULD YOU TRADE YOUR LIFE FOR JUST ONE DIME?

FILLING EVERY ROOM
OVER-FILLED WITH YOUR PRIDE
YOU WANT TO TAKE IT ALL
STILL MORE LACKS INSIDE

DON'T THINK THAT WE
NEED TO FOOL THE WEAK
THEY DO IT TO THEMSELVES
&amp; BELIEVE "IT'S PART OF ME"

DON'T THINK THAT WE
NEED TO FOOL THE MEEK
THEY DO IT TO THEMSELVES
AND BELIEVE THEIR ENEMY

FILLING EVERY ROOM
OVER-FILLED WITH YOUR PRIDE
YOU WANT TO TAKE IT ALL
STILL MORE LACKS INSIDE

FILLING EVERY ROOM
OVER-FILLED WITH PRIDE
YOU WANT TO TAKE IT ALL
STILL MORE TO SATISFY

DON'T THINK THAT WE
NEED TO FOOL THE WEAK
THEY DO IT TO THEMSELVES
&amp; BELIEVE "IT'S PART OF ME"

DON'T THINK THAT WE
NEED TO FOOL THE MEEK
THEY DO IT FOR THEMSELVES
&amp; BELIEVE THEIR ENEMY

DON'T THINK THAT WE
NEED TO FOOL THE WEAK
THEY DO IT TO THEMSELVES
&amp; BELIEVE "IT'S PART OF ME"

DON'T THINK THAT WE
NEED TO FOOL THE MEEK
THEY DO IT TO THEMSELVES
&amp; BELIEVE THEIR ENEMY
