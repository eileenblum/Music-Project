[Music: Jasun Tipton / Lyrics: Erik Rosvold]

WE MUST GAIN MORE POWER
OUR ENDS ARE OUR MEANS
WE NEED MORE AMONG US
TO ELEVATE ME

IF WE VENTURE OUTSIDE
BRING THEM INTO OUR MAZE
THEY WILL LISTEN TO ME
AND BE AMAZED

TAKEN FROM THEIR LANDS
BROUGHT INTO THE FOLD
SELL THEM A FREEDOM
NOW THEY'VE BEEN SOLD
OUT

A CLOAK CONCEALS A DAGGER
A SMILE HIDES MALAISE
WE SOLIDIFY OUR FUTURE
SHROUDED IN A HAZE

COME NOW MY BRETHREN
LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED
THEY ARE ONLY CHILDREN
TEACH THEM TO LEARN

RECRUIT THE DESTITUTE
THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE FOR
A MILITANT RELIGION
BRUTAL TO THE CORE

THE GODS AND I HAVE SPOKEN
SO LEND ME YOUR EARS
PROVIDE ME YOUR BODIES
I'LL SUPPLY THE FEARS
WITH MINE

A CLOAK CONCEALS A DAGGER
A SMILE HIDES MALAISE
WE SOLIDIFY OUR FUTURE
SHROUDED IN A HAZE

WHILE WE STAND UPON A HIGHER GROUND
WE WATCH YOUR SHIP GO SINKING
DEMIGODS ARE WHAT WE ARE
WE MAKE YOU WEAK
BUT WE ARE REALLY WEAKER
PROVIDING THE PROBLEM
AND THE SOLUTION

ONCE THEY'VE SERVED THEIR USEFULNESS
WE WILL QUICKLY DISCARD
DEALING THEM A LOSING HAND
WHILE WE HELD THE WINNING CARD

ALL MEN ARE NOT CREATED EQUAL
SOME ARE LESS SOME ARE LESS AND SOME ARE MORE
THEY LOOK TO ME AS IF I KNOW EVERYTHING
ALL I KNOW IS HOW TO TAKE THEM INTO WAR

TAKE THEM FROM THEIR LANDS
BROUGHT INTO THE FOLD
SELL THEM A FREEDOM
NOW THEY'VE BEEN
SOLD OUT
