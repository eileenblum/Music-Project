[Music: Jasun Tipton / Lyrics: Erik Rosvold]

PLEASE GODS DO NOT LET THEM FORGET ME
SEASONS HAVE CHANGED AND NOW HAVE FORCED ME
TO FIND A WILL AND A WAY TO GO HOME
AS I LIE IN THE COLD I AM DYING
I LIFT MY HEAD AND BEGIN CRYING
OUT TO SOMEONE TO SOMETHING TO ANYTHING
TO ANYONE AT ALL

THE HORRORS RETURN AND CHURN IN MY MEMORIES
THOSE BODIES THAT BURNED
THERE WAS BEAUTY AND GRACE
IN THAT PLACE THAT WE LIVED FOR
NEVER A TRACE OF A FACE WE DIDN'T CARE FOR
BUT NO MORE

NOW SOME PRAY TO THE MOON AND SOME STARE BLANKLY
INTO THE EYES OF THE DOOMED
THEY PLACE THEIR HANDS GENTLY
ON THOSE WHO HAD GONE TOO SOON
AND PLEAD TO ME INTENSELY
"GODSPEED BE ON YOUR WAY GO ON"

SO PLEASE GODS DO NOT FORGET ME
AS I LIE AT THE GATES OF THIS CITY
FIND ME THE WILL AND THE WAY TO RETURN
