Here we are so far away
So far from where we began
The end
Forever and ever
The cities walls look high now
But I will get us in without sin
With reason with reason you're all I need to convince them
Follow me manifest our destiny
Enter this living hell where I fell into a hole that was a part of me
Where I wish to return to heal and learn
The saints and angels they spoke without saying a word
Envision a window again and again
Never look back over your shoulders learn to begin again
We are part of history now
He who's calm is mad and insane
Don't ever don't ever forget or try to sever
This was the source of my power
This is the result of my reign for fame
With treason with treason I sought to deny their seasons
Follow me manifest our destiny
Enter this living hell where I fell into a hole that was made part of me
Where I wish to return to heal and learn
The saints and angels they spoke without saying a word
Envision a window again and again
Never look back over your shoulders learn to begin again
A humming din greets them as they scale the wall and make their way
Into a sterile stainless right-angled edged room containing countless scores
Of domesticated lifeless forms
Berated hated shunned and scorned
A line of people gaunt and deranged enters the chamber a parade of strange
The tribe is astonished cannot comprehend porcelain women and mannequin men
Those straight and narrow follow a course not by willing but by force
His thoughts soon wander are they from my past
Forgone and broken his ancient mask I connect and sympathize
Their hearts are dark without a spark fluorescent lightning blinding and stark
With you the one with lucid eyes coaxial cables joined together
A seething mass separate never I will wait for you and the key
Tracked and traced and databased running in circles inhumane race
For you are the I in me
Innocence lost but they're forgiven pawns in a game they were given
