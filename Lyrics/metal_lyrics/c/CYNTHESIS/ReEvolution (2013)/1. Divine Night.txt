Follow me as I retrace my steps
Divine night you will not regret
Inviting abyss
Warm sweet air, a heightened mood
Liquid languid, all is in tune
Enchanting mist
Moonlight symphony speaks to me
Speaks to me [x2]
It says, "My astronomers, let us study the stars"
May the shadows fall and so display
a righteous path and show us the way
