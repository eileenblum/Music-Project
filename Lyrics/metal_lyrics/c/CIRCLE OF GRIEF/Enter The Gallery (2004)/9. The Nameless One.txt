Once upon a time, the cross arising,
Coming from the shadows of the flames.
Once upon a time, the templars riding
To the gates of Jerusalem.

Oh see them prowling on the plains,
A flash of lightning strikes again,
The sun has darkened and the icy winds blow cold.

Lead by the spirit of the One,
We hail the unforgiven son
To seek our victory, to bathe in christian blood.

They are striking in their battle
Down the faithless with their steel.
Bless the children of the darkness,
Never, to no one they will kneel.

So do you hear the battlecry?
Blessed by the nameless One am I,
My blade is cutting through the unbelieving flesh.

Fierce is the iron in my hand,
We're armed for our final stand,
In fear and agony our enemies shall die.

Once upon a time, the cross arising,
Coming from the shadows of the flames.
Once upon a time, the templars riding
To the gates of Jerusalem.

They are striking in their battle
Down the faithless with their steel.
Bless the children of the darkness,
Never, to no one they will kneel.

And with the drowning sun,
The fallen bodies wasted,
They claim their victory
Of honour and of faith.

As they are gathered here,
The moon arising slowly,
A fair young maid to be
Their master's sacrifice.

On the hills they are standing proud,
Looking up to the sky above,
Praise their lord for his endless grace
And the death of all their enemies.

This is the end of all hope,
This is the end of your world.
