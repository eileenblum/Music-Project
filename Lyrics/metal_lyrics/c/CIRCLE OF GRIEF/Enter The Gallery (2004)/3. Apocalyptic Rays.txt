Down from the sky with a thundering sound,
The heavens tear open, the clouds disappear,
Burn in the fire of venomous light,
Visions fade, our end is near.

Apocalyptic rays will devastate us all,
Apocalyptic rays, devouring your soul.

Our earth has endured this torturing,
All the failures and all the blindness,
The destruction, the wars, the suffering,
Our mother was left in darkness.

Erase our lives in the glimpse of an eye,
Our fragile existence is wasted away,
You hear the cries from the blistering throats,
This is our final day.

Apocalyptic rays will devastate us all,
Apocalyptic rays, devouring your soul.

As as I wander through the wasted lands
The blood of mankind stains on my hands.
Your God has left you in ruin and demise,
Lost and forgotten... you die!
