Shining in the darkest night,
Who keeps the flames of the fires burning
Brightly in the darkest night?
Who keeps the flames of the fires burning bright?

I've seen with my own eyes
All the fantasies untold,
So raise your voice and
Join me in our singing of the darkest night.

Who keeps the flames of the fires burning
Brightly in the darkest night?
Who keeps the flames of the fires burning?

Bards around the fire,
Dwelling in the distant night,
Who can keep the flames
Burning in the darkness?
Bards around the fire,
Rhymes of untold fantasies,
Telling of dark ages and the sorrow of the day.
