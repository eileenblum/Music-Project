Wandering in the forest of the night,
Have you seen the stalking shadows?
Hiding there, forgotten by the light
And the crown of the ancient times.

As the moon is rising gently,
See the creatures creeping out of the dark.
As the light is slowly dying,
Hearken to our words.

Listen to the tales of forgotten times,
Days of the falconer,
Telling all the sins of a man who lived long ago,
Listen to the songs of the ancient bards,
Days of the falconer,
Hiding in the shadows he had vengeance in his mind.

Sending out all his mighty birds of prey,
Rising with the screams of vengeance,
Soaring high through the everlasting dark
And the clouds in the solemn sky.

As you see the raves flying,
You can hear the voices of nevermore
And the wings of the night embracing
Slowly the misty plains.

Listen to the tales of forgotten times,
Days of the falconer,
Telling all the sins of a man who lived long ago,
Listen to the songs of the ancient bards,
Days of the falconer,
Hiding in the shadows he had vengeance in his mind.

And again you can see ascending
All the mighty creatures in endless grace.
As the king is slowly dying,
Hearken to our words.

Listen to the tales of forgotten times,
Days of the falconer,
Telling all the sins of a man who lived long ago,
Listen to the songs of the ancient bards,
Days of the falconer,
Hiding in the shadows he had vengeance in his mind.

In the light of early morning, rising up their wings...

Sending out the falcon in the everlasting sky,
He is standing in the shadows, in the forest of the night,
He'll be hunting for his victims in another day...

I see the ravens flying, I see the ravens fly,
I see them flying on another day...
