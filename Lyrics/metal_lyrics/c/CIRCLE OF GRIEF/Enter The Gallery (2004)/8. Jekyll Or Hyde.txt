Last night I came to the end
Of a very long journey,
As for months now I've been engaged
In the dryest kind of study.
But last night all the barriers fell before me,
I have made a great breakthrough...

Carrying another person within myself,
I brought it out, I set it free.
Good or evil? Black or white?
Jekyll or Hyde?
Which one will I be?

Haven't you ever wished
For a completely new life?
Suppose you were able to do
Whatever you wanted,
Without consequences and no regrets.
Do you know who I am?

Carrying another person within myself,
I brought it out, I set it free.
Good or evil? Black or white?
Jekyll or Hyde?
Which one will I be?
Which one will be my fate?

A cruel trick it was to take his life
And leave me behind to suffer.
I found out how to ensure
What I had always wanted:
To be the knife as well as the wound.
I wanted the night and here it is...

Carrying another person within myself,
I brought it out, I set it free.
Good or evil? Black or white?
Jekyll or Hyde?
Which one will I be?
Which one will be my fate?
There is no turning back, too late.
