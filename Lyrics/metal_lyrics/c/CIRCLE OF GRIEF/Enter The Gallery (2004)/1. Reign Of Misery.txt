Out of the dark, into the night,
All that I see, misery reigns...

Down in the dungeons of torture and hate,
Far from the valleys of fortune and fate,
I have seen the moon arising high
In the distance of the night.

As we have suffered since ages ago,
No one to save us, we're facing the storm.
Our paradise was cast in flames,
Endless misery shall reign.

Far from the sea, shining in the night,
All that I see: Reign of misery.

Down in the dungeons of torture and hate,
Far from the valleys of fortune and fate,
I have seen the moon arising high
In the distance of the night.

Still we will suffer when the earth will be gone,
No need to save us, we're torn by the storm.
Our paradise was cast in flames,
Endless misery shall reign.

Far from the sea, shining in the night,
All that I see: Reign of misery.

From the darkest sea, oh, hear them crying in the night,
I see them riding on the wings of desperation.
