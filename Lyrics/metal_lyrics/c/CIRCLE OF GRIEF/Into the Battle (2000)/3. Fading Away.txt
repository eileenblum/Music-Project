Many happy years have passed
but somehow it all went totally wrong
you have left my life
my soul cries out, I'm left alone

And see...
as the night devours all the light of day
And see...
how my life is slowly fading away

I'm drowning, I'm dying, I'm fading away
I'm leaving this world, I am fading away

I am drowning in sorrow
lost the will to live one more day
suffering in this world
I wish my life was fading away

I promised you my love
till the very end of all times
but you broke my heart
filled with grief I'm left here to die

I see...
how the blood is running slowly down my arms
I feel..
how death is longing for my broken heart

I'm drowning...

I'm drowning, I'm dying, I'm bleeding, I'm fading,
I'm leaving this world, now I'm fading away
