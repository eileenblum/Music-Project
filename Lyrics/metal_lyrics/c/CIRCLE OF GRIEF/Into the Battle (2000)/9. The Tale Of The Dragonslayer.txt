Long ago in a time of tales when
Mighty dragons ruled the sky
In his castle a knight so wealthy
Dwelled in the woods by the riverside

Filled with greed he dreamt of the treasures
That the dragons were said to own
So one day he went out to kill them
Claim all the riches for his own

Dragonslayer - Raise your sword up high
Dragonslayer - Blood is spilled tonight

Soon he had slain many a dragon
Just a single one of them left
Far beyond all imaginations
Were the treasures that he possessed

No one had ever seen this monster
The most dangerous beast of them all
And the knight in his shiny armour
Headed for this last dragon to fall

Dragonslayer...

To a cave in the highest mountains
He then rode with an evil grin
In a fierce and long lasting battle
Neither the dragon nor he could win

His eyes then caught a glimpse of the treasure
Fascinated he turned his head
In this moment the dragon hit him
Bleeding his body dropped down dead

Dragonslayer - You are gonna die
Dragonslayer - Your blood is spilled tonight
