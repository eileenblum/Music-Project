Shadows of the glancing moon
embrace me now with your cold veil
deep, deep in the glacial waters
the moonlight is shimmering pale

There is darkness in my bleeding heart...

I have lost the will of living this life
for me it has no more worth
I am drowning in the glacial waters
my soul leaving this earth

There is darkness...

In my deepest desparation
all my thoughts are lead astry
come and join my in the glacial waters
I will show you the way

There is darkness...
