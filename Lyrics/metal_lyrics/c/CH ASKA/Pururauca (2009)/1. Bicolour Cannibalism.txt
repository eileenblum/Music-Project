Pleasure for flesh,
Soul, heart and life.

Pumas devouring pumas,
On coasts, ridges and jungles.

Multicolour blood beasts,
In the land of the Sun.

Hypocrisy runs deep,
In the rituals of the crimson god.

Creole feast,
Of false identity.

Nothing is what it seems,
Bicolour Cannibalism.

Mud over a two colours flag,
Blood after mud.

The world's Navel cries,
While demons are dancing

The procession of lies goes on,
From the bridge to the avenue.

Infected by rotten minds,
The beloved crystalline liquor.

Creole feast,
Of false identity.

Nothing is what it seems.
Bicolour Cannibalism.
