Upwards into the dark
Expressions of horror
Rise from my heart
Disturbing my mind.

A Shape lying lifeless
Breaks the shadows.

It can't be real,
My goddess falls.

Night after night
Death visions descend
Upon the dust
Within my head.

Gray skies embrace my soul
A cold wind strokes my face.

Silent notes of agony
Born from my heart
Ancient sorrows
Images of death
Embellish my sight
Spread out my paths.

Night after night
Death visions descend
Upon the dust
Within my head.

Gray skies embrace my soul
A cold wind strokes my face.

Silent notes of agony
Born from my heart
Ancient sorrows
Images of death
Embellish my sight
Spread out my paths.
