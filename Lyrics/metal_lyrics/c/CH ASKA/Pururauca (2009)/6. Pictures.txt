Seven rivers of red wine.
Thirteen clovers on an elf's hand.
Outstanding volcanoes
Throwing out death in a dark blue sky.

Shining eye in a crystal sphere,
Marble towers turning around.
A twisted landscape,
Awful, obscure, obscene.

Corridors of geometry.
Apple tree, poisonous.

Undulate shapes crossing a mirror of liquid mass.
Oceans of illness kissing the coasts of brutality.
Monochromatic art showing a diversity of faces.
Lifeless planet, empty and gray. A gloomy scene.

On the heavens, a stone citadel.
Greatness, mystic beauty and perfection.
Cascades of blood.
Vulture clouds over fields of starvation.

Golden mask. Lines on desertic paths.
Ancient god, thunder and lightning.
Under filth rain,
Open wounds in the heart of the earth.

Labyrinth of ivory.
Evil beast, dangerous.

Sunflowers garden in the middle of a tiny swanlake.
Plague of rats running down the streets. Chaotic streets.
So delicious, fine still life, displaying in a reddish room.
Morbid claws above mankind, pulling the strings.
