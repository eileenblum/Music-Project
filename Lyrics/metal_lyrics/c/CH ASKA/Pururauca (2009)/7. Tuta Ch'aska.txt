When the night burns
And its heat embraces the Andes (Andes),
The real me awakes
And puts its sight on that light.

Glow of an immortal fire.
Energy of another dimension.
My soul is under attraction.
A new trip begins.

Flying into infinity,
The cosmos lodges my existence (infinity).
The universe shows its magnificence.
That mighty call rides so...
Quiet.

My journey turns eternal.
This stellar path never ends.
A strange force rules my movements.
That power is ethereal.

Why can't I reach it?
The same old scene, again and again (again and again).
Spell that captures my spirit.
Charm that exposes my weakness.

Seducing is that presence.
Everlasting is the nightmare.
When the night burns (burns...)
And its heat embraces...
The Andes.
