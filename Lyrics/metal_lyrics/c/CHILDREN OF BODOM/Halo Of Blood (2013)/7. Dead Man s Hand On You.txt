Walked a long, long way down there,
Just to see, feel your glare,
I wanna sleep, just drift away,
Mother Kali, just tuck me in, take me in,
Take me out!
Heaven, earth and the underworld,
Give me the white, the red, and black

Itâs all I ask, itâs all I need
Please come to me, I need to feed

If you let me love and be, true blue
Iâll be more than just, a dead manâs hand on you
Tell me lies wonât be denied
Mother Kali, will you be my bride?

Iâd paint your roses black and show you heaven,
Just to feel your skin, for one more second,

Itâs all I ask, thatâs what I do,
Love me one more time and Iâll let you kill me too,

If you let me love and be, true blue
Iâll be more than just, a dead manâs hand on you
Tell me lies wonât be denied
Mother Kali, will you be my bride?

If you let me love and be, true blue
Iâll be more than just, a dead manâs hand on you
Tell me lies wonât be denied
Mother Kali, will you be my bride?
