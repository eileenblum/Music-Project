Let me break it down real easy
Got nothing left to burn
So you preach over me, like I will never learn
Go over it one more time
Just for your piece of mind
I've got no fucking shame
Got nothing left for your God

Wonder wonder, why you wonder
Look inside me and you'll see
What the fuck can be asunder
Oh, you just let me be!
They got to push, so up yours
Don't blame me for beating him, let me out!
To the fact that I don't care
Your buried fact, your gonna care

Take me away
Anyway, that's not my way
I don't care, I don't care which way
Toss me aside
I won't crash
I will never judge,
On account of being done for the deed

I'M DONE WITH YOU!

Take me away
Anyway that's not my way
I don't care, I don't care which way
Toss me aside
I won't crash
I will never judge,
On account of being done for the deed
