I gotta say sumtimes I just canât
Deem all the things Iâve done
Haunted to break the silence
Outcrying the truth that I want gone
â¦ and Iâll run

[Pre-chorus]
Back to the place where
I was told, drunken ignorance
Is Pure, true gold
Feeling safe to rage, start acting mad
No regret, Iâm content to be bad

[Chorus]
Relentless, no way Iâm giving up
I dare you make me stop
Reckless â shattered dreams and broken ribs
Annihilated into bits
Forever â Iâll stay on the run

You like to cling to my back like a monkey
Not even a chance youâd let me go
Fuck yea Iâm a madman, a Jameson junkie
But I know u reap what u sow
And it all just goes to show

[Solo]

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]
