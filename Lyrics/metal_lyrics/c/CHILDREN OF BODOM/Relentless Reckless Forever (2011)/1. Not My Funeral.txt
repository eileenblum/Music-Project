Let me get this one flat out straight
Illuminate please itâs not too late
Since when did you become a god?
You might be right, Iâve been tattered
ân torn, self destructing since I was born
So whatâs that got to do with you?

[Pre-chorus]
Close yet far â Iâve gone now
Safe and sound â I donât know how
Knuckled under â never giving up
And it all goes to show exactly what?

[Chorus]
So much fun when you can tell me Iâm dun
Such a sweet unchaining sound
Whisper me softly that Iâm gonna die young
Before you do take a look into the ground
Itâs not my funeral

If you rip my life apart in no time
Iâll put it back together in 2.5
Howâs that for punctuality?

Since you wanna fuck me over
And I know you do
Better be aware Iâm gonna fuck you too
But you should by now be schooled in that very piece of my mindâs obscurity

[Solo]

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus x2]
