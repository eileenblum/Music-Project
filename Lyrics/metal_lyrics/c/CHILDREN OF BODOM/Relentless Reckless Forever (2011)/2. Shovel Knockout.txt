Hundred killers after you
What the hell you gonna do?
Think theyâre gonna kick your ass
Bring you down, make you crash

I never thought the tables
Would turn like this
That one day on your grave
Iâm gonna spit and piss

Câmon, you fucker, letâs go
By this time you already know
With that standpoint of bias
You can kiss my Nordic pale white ass!

Iâm a raw loose cannon til the end
To the depths of hell you
I will send

[Chorus]
I donât think anyone ever liked me
And I donât give a fuck
Would you really think I ever dug you
Hit me with a shovel if I do

[Solo]

[Chorus]
