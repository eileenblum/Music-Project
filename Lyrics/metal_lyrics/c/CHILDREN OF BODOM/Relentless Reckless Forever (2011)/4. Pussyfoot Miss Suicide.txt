Hey there, I think I know you,
What was it, youâre condending to do?
Thatâs rite, manipulate everyone
Around to dream youâre over due

[Chorus]
You try to slit your wrists
With a dry, blunt block of wood
Upgrade it to a grater and still wonât do no good
Câmon Miss Suicide, let me hand my blade
To you and since weâre here
You might as well cut me too

Like an acid flashback, it all came
Back to me
Slipped to drop a hit of you, one second later
I vomit I odâdâ¦ oh yes indeed

You try to slit your wrists
With a dry, blunt block of wood
Upgrade it to a grater and still wonât do no good
Câmon Miss Suicide, let me hand my blade
To you. And since weâre here
You might as well kill me too

[Solo]

Miss Suicide, let me get the door for you
Let me love you black and blue
Itâs the least that I could do
Miss Suicide show me the way to go to the floor way down below
Itâs just a trifle hunch, that Iâll beat u to the punch
