Donât care have faith or mindset
Plunder and pillage yet
Complain whine and cry like a baby
Ainât so tough after all
U claim that u donât believe in nothing
Goddamn that must be exhausting
I know, you know this is getting
Boring, a lil dull, donât u think?

And not to mention hatred, loath and revulsion
You just throw around, like itâs not even there

[Pre-chorus]
Embrassing dissolution
Is that who
I have become
Over the years?
Aversion to entity and
Life in this world
Broke you up in tears

When the nite comes, when the sunlite dies
Thatâs what it sounds like
When a nihilist cries

[Solo]

[Pre-chorus]

So it finally all got back to me
A real reactionary is what youâd like to be
When the nite comes, when the sunlite dies
Thatâs what it sounds like when a nihilist cries
