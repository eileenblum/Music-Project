From the reign I've built
Of shame and guilt
I go back and take a look
At myself and what
I have done so far
At the bridge she's
Dying waiting till light

No choice to go
Backward, inwards
Okay, shatter us
You're too cold to swing by

Going down I walk my way to hell
Deep to the obscurity
Obliterating you in every way
With my life's insanity

Battered up again
I'm going all insane
Curled up on the floor
Wonder ways to kill the pain and
What doesn't kill you
Only makes you pissed off

Sweep back to kill
You pray, make it go away
So long to pack your shot at me
Cause when you punch me, I bleed

Going down I walk, my way to hell
Deep to the obscurity
Obliterating you in every way
With my life's insanity

[Solo]

No choice to go
Backward, inwards
Okay, shatter us
You're too cold to swing by

Going down I walk my way to hell
Deep to the obscurity
Obliterating you in every way
With my life's insanity
