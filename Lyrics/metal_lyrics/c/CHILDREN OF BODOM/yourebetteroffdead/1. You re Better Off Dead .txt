War-eyes!
Hey what's the matter with you?
Whatcha trying to do?
We're wrecking the place...I'll never get it
Did I ever hurt you in any way?
If I did then hear my apology--fuck you!
If I did anything to batter you down
...all the way to six feet under!
And why in earth should I stop
 Until I see your fucking ass drop
Mind your own business and leave mine alone
To take a look at the real world for a sec
It's a hell for heroes and heaven for fools,
What makes you the luckiest bastard on the earth

In the prejudiced mind you narrow yourself in,
I'm the servant while you're the king

Ohhhhhohh,
Til' tomorrow is the better day to be
Ooohhohohoh,
You're better off dead than fucking with me!
Ohooohhoooh
What if there ain't no tomorrow?
Ohooohoho
Let me tell ya, there wasn't one today!

Hey! If you like me to dare,
So that I know why itâs gone.
The only one to be.
But itâs raining flesh and blood!!!
