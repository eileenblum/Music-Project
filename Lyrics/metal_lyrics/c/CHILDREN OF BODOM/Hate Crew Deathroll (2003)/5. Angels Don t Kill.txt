[Spoken (continues from the previous track):]
I want no one to escape.

I hear the footsteps crawling by,
Watching myself slowly die.
Sharp pain is impaling through my heart,
Slowly tearing me apart.

One minute you're an angel fallen from grace,
Next, the fix that I hate.
Pick me up from the gutter with a gentle kiss,
Then rips out my heart to show me how black it is!

No!
You're no good...
It feels so cold...
Yet I won't turn back.
I'll die alone!

I hear the footsteps walking by,
Watching myself slowly die.
Sharpening pain leading through my heart,
Slowly tearing me apart.

When you appear as an angel
Look at me now, losing my way.
Could you ever kill the pain in my heart
Even though they say angels don't kill?

No!
You're no good...
It feels so cold...
Yet I won't turn back.
I'm dying alone!

No!
You're no good...
It feels so cold...
Yet I won't turn back.
I'll die alone!!
