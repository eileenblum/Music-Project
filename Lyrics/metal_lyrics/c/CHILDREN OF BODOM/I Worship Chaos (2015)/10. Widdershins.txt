The path I have walked
Is now covered in dust of contrition
As you say I've lost my way

The night's getting clouded over
I hear the echo of your call
Sweet words softly weaving
My eyes are open and bleeding

One way or the other has never been the right direction
Our sky or another could be on reflection
I'm looking if the stars sigh the afterlife that is to be mine
Donât wounder if you let them shine

Alive or dead but not dead yet
Widdershins and hence we fly
The left hand path
Attract a wicked mind

Yeah, backwards we walk through the maze of the life we spent
A new beginning could be the end
I'm looking up and the stars sigh on afterlife you are to be mine
Don't wounder just let them shine

Widdershins and hence we fly
The left hand path
Attract a wicked mind

Alive or dead but not dead yet
You dance around me widdershins
And the two tormented souls met
