You run but Iâm always a step ahead
Iâm a stalker you embrace while dread
Iâm not your lover, youâre not my only one
Iâm not your child but you made me
Your creation, your enemy
That one thing youâll regret forevermore
You canât destroy what I have become
Too little too late, damageâs done
From here on out itâs torture
While I laugh, I laugh and you will cry

Cause and effect and then you die
Thereâs more to pain than meets the eye
Iâm deep inside you and youâre mine
So take this to your mind

I am dominant
Vile, too malevolent
The more you suffer I hurt
Iâll get under your skin
When you scream I hurt
Motherfucker Iâm pain

I give you life then you take mine?
Donât forget you were the partner in crime
I might be your slave but youâre not my God
Youâre neither inside my head nor fiction
My malady, my affliction
The cross I carry on my knees until you laugh
And I will cry

Cause and effect and then you die
Thereâs more to pain than meets the eye
Iâm deep inside you and youâre mine
So take this to your twisted little mind

I surrender
Got no fight left in me to render
I wanna forget, do you remember?
I gave you a go
The lightâs now green, all you gotta do is kill me
But you keep me alive
To reap what you sew
Just let me go
Let me go

Cause and effect and then you die
Thereâs more to pain than meets the eye
Iâm deep inside you and youâre mine
So take this to your mind

I am dominant
Vile, too malevolent
The more you suffer I hurt
Iâll get under your skin
When you scream I hurt
Motherfucker Iâm the end

I am dominant
Vile, too malevolent
The more you suffer I hurt
Iâll get under your skin
When you scream I hurt
Motherfucker Iâm pain
