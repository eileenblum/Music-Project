Holding the key to my darkened past
she's painted with my sins unsurpassed
that'll live on to distend
she's the story that'll never end

and I choose her to take, carry my soul
to fly away with me when all's said and done...but now she's gone

I don't believe in faith
the un-acquired love
I refuse to let this cut me deeper
bound to make her mine
left to feel so numb
yesterday can't be undone
but I'll mark these words with a blade that'll find you once again...
Morrigan

she's the conduit of my demise
in a bewitching alluring disguise

a six foot drop and a jet black sun
is all that's left with the things I've done...because she's gone'

I don't believe in faith
the un-acquired love
I refuse to let this cut me deeper
bound to make her mine
left to feel so numb
yesterday can't be undone
but I'll mark these words with a blade that'll find you once again...
Morrigan

I ache and I ache from the fall so steep
I'm awake I'm awake from a twilight's sleep
but I refuse to let this cut me deep
I refuse to let this cut me deep

I don't believe in faith
the un-acquired love
I refuse to let this cut me deeper
bound to make her mine
left to feel so numb
yesterday can't be undone
but I'll mark these words with a blade that'll find you once again...
Morrigan
