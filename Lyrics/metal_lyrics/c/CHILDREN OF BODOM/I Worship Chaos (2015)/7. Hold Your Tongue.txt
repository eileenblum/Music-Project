Sick to death...filled to the brim
Of feigning interest in your life
Be it a god...be it a knife
An answer to the never ending strife

To hold your tongue speaks of truthful pain
It's not like I haven't already heard you complain
Breathe it in or out
Puke, swallow or spit
Silence ain't golden then gold has turned to shit
But enough's enough...

Don't tell me, once again
Life is constant pain
I've lost what I'll never find
Tripped down when I was blind
But at least I know when to drain the bitter cup
And when its time to simply just shut the fuck up!

Go ahead...cut it up or cut this back
I only hope you understand indifference,
That I don't give a damn

To hold your tongue speaks of truthful pain
It's not like I haven't already heard you complain
Breathe it in or out
Puke, swallow or spit
Silence ain't golden then gold has turned to shit
But enough's enough...

Don't tell me, once again
Life is constant pain
I've lost what I'll never find
Tripped down when I was blind
But at least I know when to drain the bitter cup
And when its time to simply just shut the fuck up!
