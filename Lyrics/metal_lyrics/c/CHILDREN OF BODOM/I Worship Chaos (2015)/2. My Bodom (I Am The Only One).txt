Woke up in a ditch, oh son of a bitch
This time Iâm not gonna make it (Last Night)
Lingers in the air Iâve been everywhere
And I canât I just canât shake it

Pick up the broken bones
Anything goes
I just wanna run the fuck away
As fast as I can, further than
In the middle of nowhereâ¦ Anywhere!

Two shots to run, what the hell have I done, thereâs blood everywhereâ¦
I see it, feel it, donât want to believe it
Iâve crossed the line, way past the line

Iâm addicted
Dejected over the edge, my soulâs infected
You were my first, bottom of the stack
Iâm done with the past
Iâm reborn, so watch your back!

Run away, crawl away, come come closer
Avert your eyes, itâs almost over!
Go ahead, sit please, put your head down
Cover your face like itâs gonna fucking help
Are you ready?
Are you ready?

I am the only one, who walked away (dismay)
Slowly turns exerted (not gonna be deserted)
I am the only one, you left me unscathed
Keep your eyes averted
You were my only one (but now, youâre another victim deserted)

Run away, crawl away, come come closer
Avert your eyes, itâs almost over!
Are you ready?
Are you ready?

I am the only one, who walked away (dismay)
Slowly turns exerted (not gonna be deserted)
I am the only one, you left me unscathed
Keep your eyes averted
You were my only one (but now, youâre another victim deserted)

I am the only one
I am the only one (not gonna be deserted
I am the only one
Keep your eyes averted
