Nightmares come as they go
Recurring as they show the movie
I've seen way too many times

Don't ask me how it all ends
Just count your stars and pray
That there won't be a part for you to play

Let me break it down while
You're racking up your brain
It's a constant downpour
And never only rain

Push me for more mileage
Or just drive me fucking insane
It don't matter to me, just pick a lane

You've been on this trip before
How long until you learn?
I'm a suicide bomber, born to crush and burn

Flying on a suicide bomber we're gonna crash, we're gonna crash
We're gonna burn, we're gonna burn
