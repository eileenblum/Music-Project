Soldier take a seat and make yourself ready for take-off
Helicopter will manage the distance
Proceed to next objective - standard command
Check the satellite scans for a barren spot
In the devastation

Sun is rising on the horizon
Flooding the land with color and life
Take a grip to withstand the strong wind
Dead land is passing by

Reaching the army of pines
Instant infantry stand tight
Shield prypjat from the threat
Absorbing prime emmision

A place of nothingness among the devastation
A place of nothingness thats left for revocation

Instant infantry stand tight
Shield prypjat from the threat
Absorbing the prime emission
Complete absorption

GUARD THE CITY - with a solid green skin
SHILD THE CITY - in bleeding orange
CONVOY THE CITY - in a death-yellow down into the grave

Proceed to next objective
Eternal autumn sector within the fertile nature
Radio active shock - bio collapse - sudden decline
Instant forest death - I take one look and I never forget

Disassembly the trees during contamination
Fallen, buried, off-duty
Nothing will grow again
Incident legacy - the nature inherits emptiness
A place of nothingness among the devastation

Sun sinks in the horizon
Revoking color and life
Take a grip to withstand the strong wind
Dead land is passing by

Leaving the army of pines
Instant infantry stand tight
Shield prypjat from the threat
Absorbing prime emission
All getting absorbed
