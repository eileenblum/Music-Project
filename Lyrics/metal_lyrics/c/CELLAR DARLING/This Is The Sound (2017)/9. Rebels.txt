The sun was set
The light
The moon will call to arms
In the hours of night
Face the shame
Rule the world
I can't deny it
I wish I was your fool
Lie for our leaders
As they burn the vacant stakes
Come, douse the flames
Smoke of the fear of the falling sky
Thereupon, run the gaunt, anyone
Plead to leave utopia, fraudulent utopia
The sun was set

The light
The moon will call to arms
In the hours of night
Then the race
Bleed 'til it hurts
We won't engage you
But break away
Lie for our leaders
As they burn the vacant stakes
Come, douse the flames
Smoke of the fear of the falling sky
Thereupon, run the gaunt, anyone
Plead to leave utopia, fraudulent utopia
The sun was set
The light
The moon will call to arms
In the hours of night
