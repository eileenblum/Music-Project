On the first day of nothing
The moon told him to go
Or punished he shall be
With gusts of freezing cold

On the second day of nothing
The sun begged him to leave
Or she shall embrace him
Burns deep under his skin

On the third day of nothing
The planets screamed with rage
United they'd be
And cast him out with flames

On the fourth day of nothing
The Devil said hello
Embracing all the gods he knew
The games they shall begin

On the fifth day of nothing
He felt his skin dissolve
And felt the rain pouring down
Although the sky was dry

The world, it has vanished
All that's left are shards of stone
And one faithful man
Who hasn't yet let go
The universe swallowed
Every single thing he loved
And the planets don't know, oh
Why he's holding on

The world, it has vanished
All that's left are shards of stone
And one faithful man
Who hasn't yet let go
The universe swallowed
Every single thing he loved
And the planets don't know, oh
Why he's holding on

Hold on to a fraction of your sanity
Hold on, hold on
Go on, live in consciousness eternally
Go on, go on

On the sixth day of nothing
Salvation was announced
It rang allowed in his head
Only for him to hear
Surrounding him vast nothingness
The punishment's at halt
And all that he could ask himself
Was why did I hold on?
