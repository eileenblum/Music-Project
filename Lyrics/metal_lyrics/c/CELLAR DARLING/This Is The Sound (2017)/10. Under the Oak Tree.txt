Under the oak tree
My best friend lies
Under the oak tree
A part of me dies

You liked the sunshine
You loved the bed of snow in wintertime
Your innocence so blind
I wish we had time

Why did you go?
Why did you go?
I should have known
I should have known

Under the oak tree
Is my best friend's home
Under the oak tree
He lies all alone

I hope you understood
Things I meant to convey but never could
I thought you'd always be mine
I thought we had time

Why did you go?
Why did you go?
I should have known
I should have known

Once I realized the end
Coming near
Once I saw it in your eyes
I had to let you go
