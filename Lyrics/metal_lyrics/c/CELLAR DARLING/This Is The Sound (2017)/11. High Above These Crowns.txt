I kiss the ground you are part of
I hear you calling my name
May your spirit rise
High above these crowns
May your breath become the wind
Whispering to me

I kiss the ground you are part of
I hear you calling my name
May your spirit rise
High above these crowns
May your breath become the wind
Whispering to me

I will let you go
I will let you go
I will let you go
I will let you go
I will let you go
I will let you go

(I will let you go)
