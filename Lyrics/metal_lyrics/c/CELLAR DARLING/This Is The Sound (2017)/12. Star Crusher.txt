Lo and behold the fairy dust, run!
Lo and behold the fairy dust, run!
Splitting asunder
Our home
Roars of thunder and lightning
Try to stun her to no avail

(Hell-bent)
Hell-bent on crushing stars
She's come to haunt our dreams
Her dust will coat the skies
And poison our land

Be careful of the fairy dust, run!
Be careful of the fairy dust, run!
Splitting asunder of our home
Splitting asunder of the night sky
