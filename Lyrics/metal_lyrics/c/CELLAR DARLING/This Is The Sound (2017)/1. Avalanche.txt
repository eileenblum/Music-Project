Freeze your pain
It won't take long
Take my hand and hear me call

This is who we are

Ease your fear
Elevate
Lay with me and close your eyes

Cover me with snow
Freeze me to death
Forever I'll lay in the alpine bed
Seasons will change
But I shall remain
Stripped bare of my coat
I will rest in peace
