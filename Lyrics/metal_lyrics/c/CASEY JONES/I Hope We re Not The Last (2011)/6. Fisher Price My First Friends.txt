Disconnected from the world
I see change from day to day
Are they friends or are they just names
Memories of better times
Time when life was more than
Fine with me and fine with you
They watch me live as I watch them die
Watch them die!
Destroying their minds, destroying their lives
And how long will it take for the smile to fade away
You're acting like a fucking child
Burning out and burning down
This isn't
This isn't
This isn't ... a fucking weekend gateway
When will you stop losing
When will you, when will you
When will you stop using
When will you
You're acting like a fucking child
Burning out and burning down
You're acting like a fucking child
Burning out and burning down
