Go ahead, shoot me dead
There's nothing left to believe in
Do you know what happens here?
Fucked people with fucked minds â fuck up all fucking lives
When will they fucking disappear
And nothing stays the same
But I will be right here
And things will always change
But it will be..
Like assholes at triple A
Just another shitty day
And I'll still be standing right here
Watching out and taking names
Playing this shitty game
I will finish and get the final score
And nothing stays the same
But I will be right here
And things will always change
But it will be OK
People will look into your eyes
And lie through their fucking teeth
Just to get you believe in their cause
Go ahead, shoot me dead
There's nothing left to believe in
Do you know what happens here?
Fucked people with fucked minds â fuck up all fucking lives
When will they fucking disappear
