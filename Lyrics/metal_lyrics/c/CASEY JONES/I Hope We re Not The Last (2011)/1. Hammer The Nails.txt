When will you see
The words I scream are reality
Pure, clean and free
I'm not these things, they are me
Growing up and growing old
Some will try to pull me down
But I won't let them change my ways
I will always be this free
And nothing you will say
Will keep me from my ways
And nothing you can do
Will ever change me into you
I live my life for me not you
I'm these words so fuck you
Straight edge is me
Until the day I die
