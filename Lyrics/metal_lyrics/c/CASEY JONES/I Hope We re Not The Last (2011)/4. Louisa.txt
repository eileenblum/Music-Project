My dear friend
The emptiness I see you carry all alone
I watch you and can't help but worry whats on your mind
Its eating me alive
Things were fine
In past times
My dear friend
I know its hard as we grow old
Time flies by and life starts to take its toll
But just stand still
And I will be right here
And if you leave know that
I will still be near
Hard times come and go but
I will be right here
And I will never let you go
So know together we'll move on
We'll move on
Still searching
Still searching for the things we left behind
Still fighting
Still trying to remember all our times
Just remember I will be right here
Just remember I will always be right here
GO
I-WILL-BE-RIGHT-HERE
