So fucked and pathetic you sniff your own shit
Drink up the piss out of your own dick
Waiting to swallow a pile of your choice
You smile ear to ear as the waste takes its course
Human waste â what are you doing to yourself
Human waste â dying young
Human waste â hitting bottom isn't enough
Human waste
A drastic digression, a worthless depression
Sinking to a perplexed state of mind
All hope is lost for your time well spent
No one can change you, get rid of it
Human waste â what are you doing to yourself
Human waste â dying young
Human waste â hitting bottom isn't enough
Human waste
When will you fucking get it
Lifeless, dead alone
Lifeless, hope is gone
Human waste, what the fuck
