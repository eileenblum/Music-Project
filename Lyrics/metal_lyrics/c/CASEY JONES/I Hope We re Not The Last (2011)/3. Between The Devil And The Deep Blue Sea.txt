One, Two, Three, Four...
No one ever told you what life would ever really be like
At twenty-five, confused, afraid of how the future could be so bright
Facts of life are hard to see when all you do is to think who you'll be
And living life is hard when nothing seems to work for you
So you have to choose
The path you'll go, the things you'll lose
What are you gonna do
When times are hard just like the past
Close your eyes, hold your breath
You gotta think fast
Cause no one can help you they don't give a shit
They choke on display of solitude
Just think of it
How could you guess when no one has a clue
It is all up to you
To make this what you want
To do the things you do
It is up to you, it is all up to you
