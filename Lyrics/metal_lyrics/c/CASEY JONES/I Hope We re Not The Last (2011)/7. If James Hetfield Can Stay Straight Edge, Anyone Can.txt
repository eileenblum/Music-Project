I know I don't fit in
I know the type you think I am
Elitist of the world today
Thinking there's no other way
Tomorrow giving up
Turning to a smoke of luck
Mocking my old words, making up for lost time
But I thought that you should know
Still drug free â for myself
Still drug free â for no one else
And I thought that you should know
And I thought that you should know that you're dying on the inside
Out of grip with no self control
Screaming out your lungs right now, wishing to be saved somehow
Tomorrow giving up
Getting loaded and fucked up
Thinking of what you said, its clear I'm living and you're dead
Its clear you're dead
Dead to the world you once knew and I thought that you should know
And I thought that you should know... GO
And I thought that you should know
Still drug free â for myself
Still drug free â for no one else
And I thought that you should know
