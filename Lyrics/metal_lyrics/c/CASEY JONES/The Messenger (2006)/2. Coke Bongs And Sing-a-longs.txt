Here we go once again riding in our shitty van
Broken down in another town. Burning up, freezing cold.
Fuck this shit, it's time to go only 18 hours to the show
Stand up, fist up, sing loud, the crowd.
It's our dance of days giving all - that we can give
Wishing we - could do this more a short few times a year facing our parents fears
Throwing all caution in the wind
Coke bongs &amp; of course sing a longs
Josh Smith hasn't hear ï¿½ of these songs these days are memories
These days are our memories.
