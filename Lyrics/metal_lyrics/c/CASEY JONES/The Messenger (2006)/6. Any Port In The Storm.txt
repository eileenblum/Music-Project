Another trap that I fell for several in the past I'm sure there will always be more,
NOTHING EVER LAST. Times, dreams - problems I have.
All alone - friends that I have.
No matter where in the world you are everything's the same.
Times lessons have taught me well; hardships &amp; mishaps.
Will I find my role in life &amp; will it ever last?
Times, dreams - problems I have. All alone - friends that I have.
No matter where in the world you are everything's the same.
Times, dreams, WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE.
