In another place in another time dying, DYING, dying all alone
I am the voice inside your head taking lives again.
On another fucked up mission.
Who will survive, survive this massacre?
There's no way out, there is no way out from here
There's no other place, there's no other time dying, dying, dying lonesome
I am the voice inside your head letting you know.
Letting you know, what you want, what you want, what you want dead
Saying what to do against your will, against your way
You can't escape
There's no way out there is no way out from here
