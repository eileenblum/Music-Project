Broken face, no one knows why
Crushed ribs, and 2 black eyes
All because he's never been to a show
Stand on the stage, preaching your rage
Letting it all go at every show
When did this turn into who you know?
Do you even know what this song's about?
Do you even care this scene's been torn down
You pick your clicks, you join your teams
You start the fights, you've fucked this scene
Fuck your shitty scene
