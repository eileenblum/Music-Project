Every smile you'll break every breath you'll take
Suddenly I see how you've changed
I'll tell you that I'm the same
Every X you wore is another X you tore
Don't tell me that you're the same
Don't forget you've changed
Look me in the eyes &amp; I'll tell you, "You are nothing"
Look me in the eyes cause I told you, "You are nothing"
