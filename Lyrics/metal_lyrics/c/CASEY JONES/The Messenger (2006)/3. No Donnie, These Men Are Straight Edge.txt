Without shame I'll put this black X on my hand
Without shame I'll speak up and make my stand
In the end I will use this, use this for my voice
Spread your rumors about me because of my choice
What the fuck do you know?
About me? Why the fuck do you care? What I do?
Who the fuck are you? You ain't fucking shit.
You think I care about you or what you say about me?
Keep talking shit
You think I care what you write or what people read on me?
I AM STILL EDGE
Care these words high. STRAIGHT EDGE
I AM STILL EDGE
