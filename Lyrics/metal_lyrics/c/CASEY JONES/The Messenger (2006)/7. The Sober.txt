I will carry this torch till the day it burns out
I'll breathe in these words &amp; push them back out.
The shit in the world won't turn me around
I'll yell these words till I'm taken down so point your finger &amp; have your good time.
Don't forget to make me your jokes while you party it up just remember
YOU'RE THE ONE, THE ONE THAT'S GETTIN' FUCKED UP
You're fucked up.
