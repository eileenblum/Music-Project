He left them just in time where they needed him most 1987.
No future, or direction what all did they do? To make him want to go away?
What else did they say to make him want to stay?
Please don't leave you're killing us please don't stay just go away
One by one we'll slowly fade away but in the end we'll see what we did wrong
And in the end we'll find out what makes us strong.
All the things you'll ever do or say those memories will haunt you everyday fade away one day we'll all fade away
