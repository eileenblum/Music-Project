Fuck it up I'm standing strong, living the words from this song.
No front, no fakes, NO FUCKING MISTAKES.
I'm never fading away, still believe in these words today;
My life my rules, NOTHING TO LOSE.
I'll never step away from the edge, THE EDGE,
The edge that separates us
I'LL NEVER BREAK THIS. Straight edge.
