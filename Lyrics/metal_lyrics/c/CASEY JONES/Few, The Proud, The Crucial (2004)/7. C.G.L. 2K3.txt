Hanging with my friends every Saturday night.
Throwing stuff at bums.
A few looking to fight.
I love my friends.
Sing it with me till the end.
Oh my god, Carl got laid!
These are the days that last a lifetime.
Quit the drama and just have some fun.
Memories are made with the best of friends.
The true ones have your back till the end.
