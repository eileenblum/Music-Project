This time I'll take every word with a grain of salt and stare you down.
One day you'll learn what a promise really is and the meaning of pride.
Go ahead and X up.
Sellout.
Straight edge for a while, a crooked x for that crooked smile.
A new trend.
A new start.
The X on your hand will never be there in your heart.
I AM STRAIGHT EDGE!
