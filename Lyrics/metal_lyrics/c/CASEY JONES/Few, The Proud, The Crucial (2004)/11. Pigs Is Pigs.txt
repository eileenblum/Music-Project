Everyday old things change.
Nothing ever stays the same.
Everyday, everyday something fades.
It's funny how things can change.
Nothing is for certain.
Tomorrow is a gamble.
Like the man on the street.
All you have is yourself.
People change.
Friendship's fade.
Roll the dice for this game called life.
People change.
Friendship's fade.
Time for your best poker face.
In the end, believe in yourself.
You're all that you have.
Believe in yourself.
You're all that you have.
