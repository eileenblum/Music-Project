So you're fed up with your life?
Time to grab the knife.
No more problems.
No more fears.
Not even your mother's tears.
Grow guts, step up.
No one likes you anyway.
Grow up, step up.
Time to change today.
Now there's two things you can do.
Number 1: grow up, be a man and quit crying.
Number 2: just do yourself in.
Quit faking it and stop wasting my precious time.
You're a selfish piece of shit and a weak link in all of humanity.
Someone's gone through the same shit before.
Quit wasting all my time.
Someone's gone through worse shit before.
Quit bitching about your life
