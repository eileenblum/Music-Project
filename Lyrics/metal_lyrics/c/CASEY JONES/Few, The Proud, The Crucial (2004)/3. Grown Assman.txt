One chance is all I got.
I'll take my time and give my best shot.
No regrets, I can't live in the past.
What's done is done.
I'll see how long this lasts.
I've made mistakes, I'll be the first to admit.
Through my time I've done some fucked up shit.
I'm trying as hard as I can to live my life and be a fucking man.
Stand up for things that are right.
Never back down from fear or a fight.
This is my pledge.
