Keep that shit outta my face.
Keep that shit outta this place.
Keep that shit to your fucking self.
Roll up your windows.
Shut your fucking doors.
That cig is cramping my style.
The pleasure is all yours.
Before you light that smoke, remember you're the joke and you look like a tool.
Your breath smells like shit.
I'd rather suck a dick,
than be the one who looks like a fool.
You're the joke.
