I wish I took you away from your problems and your worthless life.
I would have forced you to leave the pills, the bottle behind.
I just wanted you to be as free as me and see the world the way it was made to be.
Now 6 feet deep and nowhere to go.
No life.
No future.
And no one to hold.
20 years of life shut down by substances of waste.
No laughs.
No smiles.
Only tears of shame.
Dead.
You threw your life away.
Dead.
I wish I took you away
