When it's all over said and done, I'll still be standing, screaming this song.
Look me in the eyes and tell me what you see.
A standard issue mind.
Pure, clean and drug free.
I have made my choice.
This is my voice to teach what I believe is the right way for me.
This is my voice.
I am proud to be drug free.
This says it all.
