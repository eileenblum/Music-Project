[Bonus track]

Welcome, this is your boy Johnny Unstoppable,
Hey yo, this goes out to everybody who sold out to their friends,
'cause they thought it all was a trend.
check it:
Hey kids, I can only ask to hold my glass while I grab a golf club and a goalie mask.
I got to spit a verse with Casey Jones,
We're here to blaze the domes in every racist home.
Every block party and traffic jam, back in the day son, you know I had a plan.
Me and the Boys caused a ruckus, cause no one could touch us, a whole lot of love with a little brass on the knuckles.
And when I say hardcore I don't mean a Korn fag, and when you see three X's I ain't reading a porn mag.
See you just confused like a gangster with an orange rag.
I''m watching the scene split up like a torn bag.
With all the fakers fall out, taking the wrong route, now kids wonder... who I'm making this song 'bout?
See back then my mom thought my friends were satanists, now there not even my friends there just acquaintances.
When I came home from college I was startin to rap, everybody would trade in there X's for cartons and packs.
Rest of the cats think weed sacs will help them get their steeds back, and they wonder where the cheese at.
Ya'll turn the red light off for a one night stand, becoming whores for some empty coors and budlight cans.
If you don't care about that, pfft, I could care less.
I'll be making six-figures, while your peepin' hair nets.
I got a real appetite, I can't eat off their checks, so I stand alone in the pit and beat on my bear chest.
Take a look at what's left, from old school to new school.
The only thing that's real is The Few, The Proud, and The Crucial.
