I'm breaking out, these walls can't hold me any longer.
Days pass me by and I got stronger with every breath I took.
I doubted this world as a whole.
I refuse to live in a world that refuses me.
I refuse to live a life that isn't right for me.
I refuse.
I'm breaking out.
When reality comes I'll shove it away and try to make it to another day
I refuse.
