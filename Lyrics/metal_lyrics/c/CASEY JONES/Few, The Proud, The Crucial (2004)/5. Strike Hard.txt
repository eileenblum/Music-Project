Strike hard, strike first, no mercy.
2 months in your newest crew.
Trends are changing and so are you.
Trade in everything you ever had for what's the newest fad.
Shut your mouth.
Take a good listen.
Write this down.
This is your next lesson.
No matter what, what your fashion, show your heart through your actions.
In the end, where do you stand?
Is this all to impress the bands?
In the end, where do you stand?
You're preaching something you don't know.
Just doing it for a show.
In the end, where do you stand?
