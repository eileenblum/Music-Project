Darkness inside my mind guides me trough
The silence of danger keeps me alive
For a lifetime I fight to find the truth
To find the key to set me free

Time to go find the way
Leave the past and pray

Summon my demons, sadder for my life
This is a nightmare, a purified fear
Into those secrets my dreams are hidden
They make me follow the path to the death

Iâm alone burning in flames
The road Iâve chosen, the heart I broke
Were screaming my name, not anymore
I let my cries forevermore

Time to go find the way
Leave the past and pray

Summon my demons, sadder for my life
This is a nightmare, a purified fear
Into those secrets my dreams are hidden
They make me follow the path to the death
