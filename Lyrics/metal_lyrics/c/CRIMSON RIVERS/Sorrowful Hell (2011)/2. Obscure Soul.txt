Words of tears and pain you said
Theyâre all the same to me
The effort to bring this new reality
Has collapsed
So many things to sacrifice
Thereâs nothing left to live for
Thereâs nothing left to die for

Look at me, this is not what you see
Just an illusion of a lunatic man
âCause they donât know
Who really I am, what really I do in my life
An internal journey to Hell

Dreaming a world in my own time
Without any tears in your eyes
The blood in my veins, my soul still remains
And fight âtill death for you

Every time, every moment
My thoughts are lost in misery
Just a nightmare
Donât you know?
The blessings of a priest
Have never been heard
By anyone in this life

Dreaming a world in my own time
Without any tears in your eyes
The blood in my veins, my soul still remains
And fight âtill death for you
