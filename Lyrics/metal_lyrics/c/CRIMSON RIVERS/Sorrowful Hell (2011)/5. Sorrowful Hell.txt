How can I say it's all right with my life?
Who's the reason I just have to stay behind?
There's no way for me to get away, to be free
There's no God to help me with my life

In the silence of my sorrow hear the echoes of the past
Where all my hopes are dying, all my dreams are crying
Life is no more than a game
Empty souls are burning, all my fears are growing
I cannot stand them all

Haunted whispers so many thoughts in my mind
Secret voices have taken my heart into lies
What is growing just behind my bleeding eyes?
Killing my dreams, killing my fate just a growing Hell

Memories are flying away
With broken wings and angel's tears
Nightmare whispers sorrowful notes
All I want just a dream for me
