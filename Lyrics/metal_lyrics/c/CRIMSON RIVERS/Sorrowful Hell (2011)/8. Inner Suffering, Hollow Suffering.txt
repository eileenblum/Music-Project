Voices in my head I can hear
Screams are hurting my soul
What is it, reality or a dream?
Whispers are bringing back
The memories of dark

White light I see reminds me the past
Filled with hope, I will come back
Being by your side erased my life
See the signs and pray for us

Donât you know thereâs a sacred bond between us?
If I die Iâll take you with me

Life is a gift but death is near
Try to hide your sins and live with no fear
Power of your soul will render everything immune
Make the angels cry

Have to find a way to complete this task
To separate myself from my destiny
To kill my demons from the past
The secrets and the lies

Explicit scenes overwhelming my mind
Of all those I left behind
The sun will not rise up high
Only you will survive

Donât you know thereâs a sacred bond between us?
If I die Iâll take you with me

If you donât, I will sacrifice my heart
I will bury it with my emotions
Foreverâ¦
