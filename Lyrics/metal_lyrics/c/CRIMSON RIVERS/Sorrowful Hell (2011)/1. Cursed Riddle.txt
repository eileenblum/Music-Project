Riddler lost at the ends of the ground
So many Seekers to bring him around
So many years, so many fights
This mystery stayed in the dark
Spells of the chosen one
Open the gates to the Holy Land
Find the answer, find the way
Make the prophecy true someday

Riddler Iâm asking for an answer
This is the legacy of mine
The key to a descent life
This curse is hunting my mind
The chosen path by the Siren
Is this a life to believe, to live?

Memories of this magical time
Embrace your feelings, cleanse your mind
Follow the secrets, follow the scars
Youâre lost in this game
Strange people keep asking me out
"Are you the child who found this out?"
Upcoming curse ruined my life
Thereâs nothing to do anymore

Riddler Iâm asking for an answer
This is the legacy of mine
The key to a descent life
This curse is hunting my mind
The chosen path by the Siren
Is this a life to believe, to live?

Try to find out the way
Keep your fillings inside you
This curse is only a dream
It will take you to Hell
With me
