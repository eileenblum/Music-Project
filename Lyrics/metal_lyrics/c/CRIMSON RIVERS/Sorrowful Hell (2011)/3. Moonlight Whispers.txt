'Love is only an illusion that we are all condemned to worship
Whoâs the one to follow, whoâs the one to question?
All you need is trust, a false pretense of interest

No one cares about you anymore,but you persist on believing so.
Run to hide, run to be free,
you can't escape this maze. Nothing's for real,
these spoken words are never to be trusted'

Darkness around, the sun is gone, my heart is cold as ice
Silent thoughts haunted my mind
Silent dreams are haunting my nights
Still I canât deny my fate, my destiny
You were here with me, but not anymore

In my time you see me cry for the child I used to be
Brave man with life ahead, but somethingâs lost in the past
A memory, a sin or a deadly wish
Why youâve gone?
I want you to know

Forever inside my heart youâll be there
Whenever the night falls Iâm dreaming of you
I whisper your name in the moonlight again
Sounds like a melody through the wind, through the sky

Time of dark, time of light, time I thought you were mine
Soul was covered by a veil of pain, so much poison in my veins
Why I have to feel the sorrow, the immense void?
Wait for me and hear these words

Forever inside my heart youâll be there
Whenever the night falls Iâm dreaming of you
I whisper your name in the moonlight again
Sounds like a melody through the wind, through the sky
