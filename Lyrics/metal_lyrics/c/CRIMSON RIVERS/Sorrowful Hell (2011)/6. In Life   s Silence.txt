Walking down this endless road
Only love can fight depression
Please take my helpless hand
And pull me out of this aggression
Make the night smile for us
Let the day sing along
Change your thoughts and take me with you
Just for now

Lies and death are all around
Dreams are lying on the ground
Save me while Iâm falling down
See the darkness all around

I need that light so we can fight
The death we will tease
My Prince of Sun hold on for a while
A new day is hear
Follow the path to the sun
I will be there for
Burning in flames
For my lifetime

Together weâll built our heaven
Together weâll built our burning hell
Please love me âtill the death
Will take our souls to the silent hill
Make the memories of me
And keep them in your mind
In your soul, in your heart
Now and forever

Lies and death are all around
Dreams are lying on the ground
Save me while Iâm falling down
See the darkness all around
