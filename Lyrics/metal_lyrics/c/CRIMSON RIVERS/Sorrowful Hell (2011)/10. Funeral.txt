This child saw him alive for the last time
Running away from this wrecking life
First man down on the field, his blood with magical power
Embraced his fighting soul to the sky forever

Birds are crying for his fate, sky is keeping his soul mate
Nature whispers his name to his grave
Wind is covering the voices, calling him back from the dead
The destiny of his own, his death

His loss is a sign to kill the enemy full of madness and hate
This grave is only a prison for his soul, for his heart
He is not here but I can feel his presence by my side
It canât be for real
Pain is my feeling for the rest of my life
Fighting my fears, my demons without him alive

History is written with blood and pain
With scars on your heart
Itâs insane, Iâve lost my faith
Every time a friend of mine is dying
Iâm crying out forever more

Inside the tears you can see the sadness
You can feel the pain for this unfair loss of this man
Riddler was telling me the truth, this is my deliverance
A path to the silent hill, a thrill

His loss is a sign to kill the enemy full of madness and hate
This grave is only a prison for his soul, for his heart
He is not here but I can feel his presence by my side
It canât be for real
Pain is my feeling for the rest of my life
Fighting my fears, my demons without him alive
