In the dead of night
A stranger omen still
The witches footprint
On your window sill
When hell lets loose
And draws ever near
A soul like ghost
Will transmit fear

There's always doom for the wicked
Take hold of the pain

With witch like rays
To deliver your doom
The owl tranced prey
Destined for ruin
