Mistress of the universe
Beware her curse
Lucifer's morning star
Bringer of dawns war

Selfish warrior your discontent grows slow
Apocalyptic soul soon grows old

Cuts like a knife

Fire wave of morning light
Cast off the shadowed night
Visions a soul has seen
But eyes can't believe

Selfish warrior you're better off to wait
Can't you see there's a square axe in you mind?

Sleighted hand seeks revenge
Queen of the night avenged
Invocation at hand
The venus pentagram

Endless voyager you wasted life in wander
Can't you see your journey's coming to an end?
