Burning village on the run
Feel the knife peace torn
Frozen horse on the ground
End of dreams coming round

Black riders mount
Ready to die
Sun goes out
Beholden their might

Bad trouble on the iron road
Strike deep and run free
Dying breed stand your ground
Thunder beings coming round

Behold elders speak
Dark shadows men lost
Another world calls to me
Dying breed stand your ground
