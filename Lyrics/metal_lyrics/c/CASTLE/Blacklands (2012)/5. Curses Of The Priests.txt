Voices like a clang
The deafening clash of blades
The crackling roar of flames
The screams of frightened maids

Over the beaten earth
A ring of iron hoofs
Dying groans upon the field
Curses of the priests

Council of the cave
The nights of forty days
Under a wash of blood
To kill the christian ways

Curses of the priests

From hollow tombs of sin
Dead men walk again
The great bell tolls of fear
The witching hour is drawing near

Winter of the years
Shall fall before this rage
Long to cast the chains away
That hold the soul a slave
Arise beyond the earth
Break the dungeon walls away
Life lies in embryo
Right until the grave
