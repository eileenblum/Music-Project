Corpse candles light my way
Haunted people you will pay
Slaughtered where the bodies lay
Crushing all into mass graves

Deathly white a life like fright
Frozen masks a pained delight
A thousand eyes shine dead light
And drip like wax into the night

Burn

Corpse candles are revealing
What death has been concealing
When life gives up its secrets
This death will lose its meaning
