Ever hunter in the fray
Always gaining on its prey
Running wild in the night
Close behind and out of sight

Cross hairs levelled for the death
Grip the trigger hold your breath
Right between the eyes it hits
Kill it all if it fits

Skin grows cold the night wind blows
Turn your face into the pouring rain
No one knows friend or foe
Until the moment that it's too late
A deadly blow the hammers throw
Descend to darkness and the burning lake
When death comes to the here and now
Secrets of the grave lie in wait

Ever hunter on the path
Bringing all unto its wrath
High upon the cliffs of black
Planning its surprise attack
