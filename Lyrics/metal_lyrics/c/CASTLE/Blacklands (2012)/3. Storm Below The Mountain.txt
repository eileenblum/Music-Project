Twisted fingers splay in death
Crawling across the land
Like witches spells decending
Into a perfect storm
This sweet touch of death
Lay rest your uneasy soul
The waters getting dark around you
Death twisting into form

Ride! You prince of hell
Capture all your cities well
Ride! Into the storm below
The mountain our righteous home

Rising shadows grip of death
A fog of ancient form
Like electric shocks of lightning
Crashing around your soul
This blackened soul of fire
A force that you can't see
The hills alive with evil
Death circling from above

Ride! Like ghosts of hell
Hold you forever in this spell
Ride! Into the storm below
The Mountain our forgotten home
