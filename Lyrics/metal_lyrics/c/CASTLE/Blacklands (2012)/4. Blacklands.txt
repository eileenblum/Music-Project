Bloodlust and evil rising higher
Like a pagan god of fire
All through the ceremonies rotting
See the prophets veil is failing

Pray and believe
The Wicked eyes
Dragged to the altar
Of shameless lies

On the altar
Be sacrificed
Through the fire
To arise

Faces of a vast and somber dream
Haunt the past with perfect grief
Listen to the hiss of time outside
Enslave the paradox with lies

Crumble to dust
This holy light
A blackened void
Of endless night

Evil rising
