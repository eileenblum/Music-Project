A death like seasons sleep
The silent gnashing of teeth
And eyes as wide as terror
Time slithers at your feet

Doomed from the womb
To destruction

Seek the secret part of night
Through the maze a hidden land
Like Gods of their own betrayal
Who holding the losing hand

Follow me to Hell
With your painted mouths
Open for all to see

The fire never dies
This burning still alive
The fire never quenched
The burning relentless

Hellfire

There's a picture that you keep
Of wrath you always seek
For you there is some door
You are closing forevermore

What mirror could draw and hold
What night hides and day unfolds
And in these shadows still
In cryptus in this labyrinth?
