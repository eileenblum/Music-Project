Speed and violence sits alone
The ancient one
Circling vortex of the burning sun
Like the Devils smile

Vanish forever
Without a trace
Secrets remain
Never to be found again

Torn in half by the rampage
Of endless waves
Guard the secrets of this
Final resting place

Distant attack awaits you
Forevermore

Solar winds will burn
Into oblivion
Burried in a watery grave
Never to be found
