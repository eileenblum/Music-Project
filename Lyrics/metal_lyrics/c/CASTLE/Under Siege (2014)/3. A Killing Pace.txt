A test of endurance
Ride to the end
Leaping over the edge
Nowhere to go but down

Craven are the souls
Who lost but never found
The one way to the end
Without breaking from the load

A killing pace
Racing towards the end of days

A killing pace
One already in the grave

Send me a voice
From a place beyond the sun
Voices are calling
I hear them one by one

Behold! the power
Beating like a drum
And what you desire
Is what you will become

Running hard / Heart explodes
The earth beneath turns to black
Stone
My eyes walk on / The skull beneath
Last breath of a dying breed
