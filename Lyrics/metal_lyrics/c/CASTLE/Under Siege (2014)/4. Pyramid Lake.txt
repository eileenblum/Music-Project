Dejected cries I hear
Invisible child is near
The elders run and hide
A figure in black appears

Turn to stone
Lake of tears
Turn to stone

Now the serpents emerge
Ill-formed an premature
Devouring all they see
And taking their form

Unleash the slaughter

Raise Hell!
You serpent mother
The lives you stole
