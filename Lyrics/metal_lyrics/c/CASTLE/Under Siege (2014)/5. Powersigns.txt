In this house of treachery
Things are never what they seem to be

Evil formless enters the night
As the moon is taking light
Swarming from below the sea
Where the darkness rules the deep

And fades away

In this house of misery
Creation bowing down in blasphemy

Signs of power from beyond
Immortal coil cursed by Gods
Lift the seal upon the gate
Where the dreaming dead will rise

Outside time and space
Through the void beyond the planes
Of evermore where chaos reigns

Sleep the dream of death awaits
Break the seal of life away
