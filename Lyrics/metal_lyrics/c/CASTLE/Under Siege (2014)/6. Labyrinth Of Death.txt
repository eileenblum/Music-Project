In the days of ruin and fear
And gangways chocked with despair
Stone walls meander and hide
A monster within the lair

No resting here all along
The path is unmarked
A labyrinth of death where
The unguided are lost

One way in and
No way out
The door of no return

The passage to darkness
Is a thunder within
This pit of burning bones
Seals the burial rites in

Dream on the eve of battle
The scars they have won
An echo from the center paints
The soldiers shields with blood

So the hard way
in darkness
So hard the way

From tomb to temple the rise
Of the dead king God

Pestilence burns by day
And the death vapors by night
A world of corpses paralyzed
Within this dream of life

Satan's mills of endless wheels
Capture all in flight
And the secret path of thieves
Is plotting out the light

Creator of this vision
Interpreter of it all
Apocalyptic arrows aimed
At sword forged on anvils old

Terror struck and trembling
outstretched upon the path
Turn to see a voice that speaks
And behold falls bead now
At its feet

I rule in fear
All death is near
