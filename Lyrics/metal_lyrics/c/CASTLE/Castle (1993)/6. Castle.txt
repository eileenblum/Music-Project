Billions of years ago, sudden I was there
Placed on a rock, around it a lake, the borders that far
In the middle of the waste, it rose to the sky
The place was warmed by a young, yellow burning star
But why???
It had no enemies, until our tribe appeared
They filled the waste with science, soon it all was fertilized!
They filled the waste with the victims of human GREED!!!
Huge, black walls surround the place; the last defence
Massive towers, with magic aura, grabbing for the sun
Winged guardians on the walls, armed with sorcery
The Arch-mage and his son prepared a medusa-stun

Mustard-seeds growing on the walls
Soon they tumble and they fall
The guardians fought at Thermopylae
Choosing Hades as the only way

Impale them with your lust!
Stun them with your GREED!!!

Soon they all, they tumbled their fall
They fell, bleeding, into an endless night
The Virgin was raped, but no one helped her at all
The Arch-mage, he wept, his Son was crucified!

The Arch-mage scorched the Earth with his magic breath
After that he drowned us all, with his endless tears
Forty days of bitter sorrow brought the tribe to death
Very few survived it all, haunted by their fears

Man was scattered over Earth
Lost in too many different languages
