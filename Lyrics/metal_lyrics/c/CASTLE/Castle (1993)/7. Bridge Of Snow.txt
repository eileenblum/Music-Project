Travelling... lands of Snow
I came across a bridge of choice
Meeting... The One below
Recognizing his unique Voice

Doubts on the bridge of Snow
Crossing or not is the question
All that remains is hiding
Seeking for a solution

Going to the One I owe a favor
Leaving myself until it's over
Leaving the bridge...

Travelling... everywhere
Remembering what's left behind
Knowing... every sphere
Seeking Light, for my mind
(Perseiving life as a Bridge)
