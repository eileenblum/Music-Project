Children... on their way
Travelling... lands of Snow
They are... on a mission

Five... so they say
Exposure... long ago
Causing... purple visions

Consumed by innocence (?)
When clouds of the lords collide, I did collapse too...
Swarms of (f)lies, enter our void
Rearranging every kind of humanoid
There is no one to recreate our lost minds
Petrified eyes, perceiving nothing, no one find

Walls of Ice, exist no longer, we're exposed
Remaining Lies, growin' stronger
Heaven's closed...

Travelling... lands of Snow
They are... on a mission

Five... so they say
Exposure... long ago
Causing... Inner collisions

There is no God but Man; he's the Emperor
