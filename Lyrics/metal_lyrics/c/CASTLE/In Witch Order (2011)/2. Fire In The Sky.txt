Fire burns and fire turns
All evil away from me
Fires power and fires might
Protects me every day and night.

Fire spirits of endless change
Burn away my lazy ways
Light my will with your strong flame
Fire spirits action and change.

Fire fire roaring higher
Bring the heat that never dies
I see a fire in the sky 
Make my heart blaze and shine.
