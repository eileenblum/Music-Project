My specter round me night and day
Like a wild beast guards my way
My emanation far within
Weeps incessantly for my sin
A fathomless and boundless deep
There we wander there we weep
On the hungry craving wind
My specter follows me within

He scents my footsteps in the snow
Wheresover i might go
Thru the winters hail and rain
When will you return again?

Seven of my sweet loves this knife
Has bereaved of their lives
Their marble tombs i built with tears
And with cold and shuddering fears
Seven more loves weep night and day
Round the tombs where my loves lay
And seven more loves attend each night
Around my love with torches bright

The door of death is made of gold
That mortal eyes can't behold
Close your eyes and you might see
In my hand the golden key

Poor pale and pitiable form
That i follow in a storm
Iron tears and groans of lead
Bind around my aching head
And throughout all eternity
I forgive you you forgive me
As the great redeemer said
This is my life and this your death
This your death now!
