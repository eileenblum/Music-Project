Divergencies, great naivety,
We're begging for a meaning
While everything around us is falling apart

Can you see how dying of boredom is such a blessing?
I dream of the beginning, sinking into the chasm

Abyss of time

A place for us isn't given, other than the eternal void that always feeds with its fingers the morbidity we so chastely keep.
A place for us isn't given
A place for us isn't given
A place for us isn't given

Echoes resound around the despair of youth lost in sorrow
Both day and night
This life's been carried like a boat drifting out to sea
Where lies torment and nothing is clear
Divergencies, great naivety
Mortality begging for a meaning that'll never appear
There is no place for us
There is no place for us
