Staring at the wall, suffering.
This lake of disgust, an endless sinking.
Your words of comfort, a useless thought
Then all I had was a gift
That allowed me to feel all the pain from surrounding people
I could touch their anguished souls
I could feel the weight of their eternal failure

I felt the pain of the victims
Gushing out of wounds
All given by devils feasting upon their souls

Now that I don't feel anything at all
I need to taste this torment again
