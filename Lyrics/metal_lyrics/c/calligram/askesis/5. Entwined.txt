How did I get here? Maybe just following those traces that were slowly fading away on the sand?
I don't remember nothing apart from that celestial sound of waves crashing against the shore.
There was a fainting light, pale like winter mornings, the beauty of unknown

Feeling
The desire
To sink
Away

Fearing
The lack
Of empathy
To give
Coil of unknown
