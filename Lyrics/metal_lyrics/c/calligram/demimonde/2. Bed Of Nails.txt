You parked your car and waited inside
You gave me sweets and spoke with a smile
You kindly offered to give me a lift back
You drove back to your house
Locked me inside a room
You left me with a child whose face told stories from hell

What you had in mind was so far from what I ever imagined how can one do such things?
My wrath will come upon you, my time will come soon

You'd come once everyday
You said nobody cared
I kept a record of your sickening visits, scum
Circles for every time
Stars to rate the pain
Each time I heard your footsteps my heart would sink down

Smile while you can
Laugh all you can
I'll make you pay for this
I'll paint tears on your face
Die
Rot in hell, fucking filth
I've got plans, to finish this
Now I know how to end this

I'll spit it out
And let you bleed to death
Your luck has turned
Rot in hell
