We'll walk, until the night drowns this laughter
We're on a mission they can't comprehend
Some kind of sayonara
Some kind of kamikaze dive
Somehow chained together

A flying ball, up in the night sky
The lights of lorries, like neon signs
Don't try, to fight against it
The clock's ticking
There's nothing to do about it
Such is life you see
Sad news, under a wretched sky

What a way to die, with a bride in mourning
What a way to die, with no fear left inside me
Another time, another mountain to climb
While a man, blinds himself not to see
Beauty marred by fate,
Heaven for the mad, hell for the sane
Another day, another chapter
Another sad man trapped in a reverie
Such is memory,
Nothing really goes away, no
This life cannot be undone, life's a stream
Nothing ever goes away
We'll walk, until the night drowns this laughter
We're on a mission they can't comprehend
I understand these sorts of comments
I wouldn't get it if my heart weren't so black
Some kind of sayonara
Some kind of kamikaze dive
Somehow chained together
Sad news under the sunset
