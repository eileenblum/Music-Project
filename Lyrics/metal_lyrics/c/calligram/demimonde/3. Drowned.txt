The tide has come my brother
Lost and found in water
Forsaken, my second son
My pride, will not die for nothing
Red are the sea and the sand
Of this country, of this land
Wash all your sins, wash your hands
Of those coming on your strand

Drowned
Ballet for corpses, floating like branches
Red are the sea and the sand
Of this country, of this land

From the cross, from the fire of the bombs,to the deadly sea
Welcome boy, welcome to the land of the free, welcome
Open your eyes and see. Please, wake up.
Grapes of war. You've been forever forsaken

Ballet for corpses floating like branches
