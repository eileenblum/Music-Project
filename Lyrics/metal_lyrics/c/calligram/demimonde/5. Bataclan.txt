Rise
Like a fist, like a figure
Like a wounded beast
Not scared to look death in the eye
Like a mother whose life won't ever be the same
Like all the young ones left behind whose dads won't come back

You're all wrong,
Empty souls, just like your shells
Je suis Charlie, je n'suis pas mort
I'm not afraid to die, I will stand proud
Je suis le Bataclan
A mind fed with lies, a soul dies
What's left of this boy? Now it's time to die, for a god, for a cause
Others made up, others made up

A wave of hatred is coming down

You're all wrong
Empty souls
