Last night. Last night, I killed you
Oh, Lord, was it me, the devil?

A cloud, a mask, a shadow, a spell.
A cloud, a matter of stardust

Time never erased that fateful twelfth round from my mind,
I recalled everything from that fight, each night for forty years

I killed a man a most forgave me
I love a man and they call me the evil
