The rain falls down, washes out your eyes.
I've told you many times,
"This will turn out to be nothing."
Now that you're out you feel the pain escape.
No longer practice restraint,
Even though they'll always judge you.
You, you walk in silence.
Don't be afraid. You walk in silence.
Don't be afraid. You walk in silence
Don't be afraid. You walk in silence.
They kicked you out.
Your family hated you.
They left you in the streets.
Your life disrupted for the choices you have made.
Your secret life, out for the world to see.
Your courage goes unmatched.
They will be proud of you someday.
You, you walk in silence.
Don't be afraid. You walk in silence.
Don't be afraid. You walk in silence
Don't be afraid. You walk in silence.
You will, you shall,
You will, you shall,
You will, you shall,
You will overcome.
