Waiting at the gates it's begun to take over.
Now I can feel some joy,
The cobwebs falling slowly.
You begin to remove these calluses from my heart.
This is so new to me.
I don't know where to start.
I can't explain it,
What you do to me. YEAH BABY!
I can't explain it, what you do.
The feeling I get when you come near,
Is so incredible, grips me with fear.
Now I've let you in.
I'm an open target for you to leave behind,
But I will take my chances.
I can't explain it,
What you do to me. YEAH BABY!
I can't explain it, what you do.
Wishing, waiting, hoping, praying,
Someday you'll get close to me.
Yeah, I try so hard, I try so hard,
To win your heart.
I can't explain it,
What you do to me. YEAH BABY!
I can't explain it, what you do.
