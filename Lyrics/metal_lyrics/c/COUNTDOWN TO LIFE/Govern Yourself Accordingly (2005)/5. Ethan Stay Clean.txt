Don't let this pain be forgotten,
'Cause this pain don't come for free.
This part of us is irresistible.
This part of us is tragedy.
We take the bait, walk right in, have a seat,
And watch our lives flash before our eyes.
This circle of failure continues.
It's up to us to show some fucking strength.
This battle seems to take so long,
But our link to the, the other side is strong.
Don't let them walk on us cause it's not over.
We won't go quietly.
Don't let this pain be forgotten,
Cause this pain don't come for free.
This part of us is irresistible.
This part of us is tragedy.
This part of us is tragedy.
Seems like good intentions,
Are what we need to practice.
Things don't always have to be like this.
Don't let them walk on us cause it's not over.
We won't go quietly.
Take the stand or take the fall,
Before this world ceases to be at all.
We're gonna cross this border.
We're gonna get it right.
Tonight we'll see the walls falling down.
