Hell yeah. Right now, this is the time and place. [x4]
The one thing that you have is the one thing that I hate.
(This is, this is, this is)
You are my hate beyond words.
And all these questions still need answers.
Can you provide?
Will we figure out this isn't working?
Well there she goes just like the others.
This seems to happen,
This seems to happen every time.
Can't live like this forever. (Can't live like this forever.)
I'll take this all away from you.
Seems like it's never ending, (seems like it's never ending)
Everything that you and I go through.
Do you still want me?
It's been three years since my last entry.
"Be good at something," that's what you told me.
It's been six months since I've been healthy.
This seems to happen,
This seems to happen every time.
Can't live like this forever. (Can't live like this forever.)
I'll take this all away from you.
Seems like it's never ending, (seems like it's never ending)
I'll say it's over.
I'll walk through broken glass to let them know,
Who you really are.
One last time, for my father.
The one thing that you have is the one thing that I hate.
Your love, your love, your love, your love, your love.
The one thing that you have is the one thing that I hate.
Your love, your love, your love, your love, your love.
The one thing that you have is the one thing that I hate.
