I have the strongest urge.
This is going to be real bad.
But for a short while, I'll feel completed.
This whining, crying has to stop.
It's worth my life if I am caught.
Come on kids, lets go for a ride.
This won't take long, just your life.
You promised to keep your mouth shut.
Feel the cold steel.
Feel my flesh on your face. (on your face)
This empty feeling I have got to replace,
With your touch.
Feel the cold steel.
Feel my flesh on your face. (on your face)
This empty feeling I have got to replace,
With boys love.
They could take 18 years.
Guilty for loving too much.
Show me love, body, give me love, baby.
Come on kids, lets go for a ride.
This won't take long, just your lives.
You promised to keep your mouth shut.
Feel the cold steel.
Feel my flesh on your face. (on your face)
This empty feeling I have got to replace,
With your touch.
Don't look at me stare at the pictures on the wall.
(On the wall)
This empty feeling I have got to replace,
With boys love.
Is there something wrong with me?
Is there something wrong with me?
I don't think you know what it is I see,
When I'm looking at myself.
I hope they believe me when I say...
When I say.... when I say....
