Can you hear us? Or should we turn it up?
The best relationship is the one built on trust?
Isn't that what you wrote?
Back down. Didn't sign up for this state of waste.
Back down. Back down.
Didn't sign up for this state of waste.
We want it. We got it.
We're going home. (We're going home.)
Going back to what this meant to us.
We want it. We got it.
We're going home. (We're going home.)
Going back to what this meant to us.
Pave the way that's the intention.
We'll find a new way to get out.
Coming out a little better than before.
Always better than you.
Back down. Didn't sign up for this state of waste.
Back down. Back down.
Didn't sign up for this state of waste.
We want it. We got it.
We're going home. (We're going home.)
Going back to what this meant to us
We want it. We got it.
We're going home. (We're going home.)
Going back to what this meant to us.
Are you guilty? Guilty of a wasted life.
This time, we have, we sing, the last word.
