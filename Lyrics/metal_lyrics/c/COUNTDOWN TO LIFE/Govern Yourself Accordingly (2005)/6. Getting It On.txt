Lock all the doors. Turn out the lights.
You're gonna pay for all the mistakes that I made.
This is your end.
I wanted to grow up to be just like him.
You've cast me out and I'm coming back for more.
A voice inside me says, "Do this or do that."
And if I do not obey I usually rue the day.
You will see through me just want you wanted.
You will end up just like me.
So close your eyes.
Keep your head in your hands.
You're gonna pay. This is your end.
I wanted to grow up to fucking murder him.
You've cast me out.
I'm coming back for more.
A voice inside me says, "Do this or do that."
And if I do not obey I usually rue the day.
You will see through me just want you wanted.
You will end up just like me.
You will see through me just want you wanted.
You will end up just like me.
You will die. [x4]
You will see through me just want you wanted.
You will end up just like me.
You will see through me just want you wanted.
You will die.
