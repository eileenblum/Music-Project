This is what happens when the heart explains.
It's love and hatred for the things you do.
You can just promise this won't happen again.
It's killing you quick and killing me a little slower.
Not fatal but that knife still twisted in my back.
From here on out I'll trust myself.
Words cannot express.
Say the Right thing. Admit you were wrong.
Do the right thing go your own way now.
Say the Right thing. Admit you were wrong.
Do the right thing go your own way now.
Does it make you sick inside,
Knowing that you sunk so low?
Knowing that you shit on everyone,
Who ever helped you?
Remove that mask so we can see who you are.
You're not the person you claim to be.
Words cannot express.
Say the Right thing. Admit you were wrong.
Do the right thing. Go your own way now.
Say the Right thing. Admit you were wrong.
Do the right thing. Go your own way now.
Does it make you sick,
Knowing what you have done?
Does it make you sick,
Knowing what you have done?
Words cannot express.
Words could never explain.
