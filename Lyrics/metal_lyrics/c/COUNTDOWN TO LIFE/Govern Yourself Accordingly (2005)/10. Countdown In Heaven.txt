This one goes out to the creator.
Whom I've never seen.
Whom I've never heard.
This one goes out to the deceiver.
Who never seem to listen.
Who never seem to care.
Get your bibles! Get your guns!
Time is now; they're on the run.
You can't take what I've found without hypocrisy.
All these words. All these words.
You said you'd show me,
If I kept you in my heart.
Still no sign or whisper.
So far I'm still here.
And I struggle to believe your words.
That your gift to us is to destroy the world.
Get your bibles! Get your guns!
Time is now; they're on the run.
You can't take what I've found without hypocrisy.
Never mind what we say or want.
We speak so loud so you will never forget.
I've heard your stories,
But I don't listen.
I will never trust the words that you preach.

And don't believe them,
Cuz you still have a choice.
They want your money, not your faith.
So let 'em live rich in those fairy tales.
We won't allow 'em to suck us in.
I back the fallen.
The ones who can't speak.
The ones who can't see.
Don't pray for me.
