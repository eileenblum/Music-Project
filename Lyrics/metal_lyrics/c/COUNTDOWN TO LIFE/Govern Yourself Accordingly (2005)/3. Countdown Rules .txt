Take this knife, dig it deep within my face.
Consume the fluids that will make us Gods.
Get it right, get it right.
Tonight we'll get it right.
Get it right, get it right.
Tonight we'll get it right. YEAH.
Come on everyone, do this tonight.
We're gonna live forever.
Come on everyone, do this tonight.
We're gonna live forever.
And I only wish we could be here just to see,
The looks on their faces,
When they see what we've done.
Get it right, get it right.
Tonight we'll get it right.
Get it right, get it right
Tonight we'll get it right.
Come on everyone, do this tonight.
We're gonna live forever.
Come on everyone, do this tonight.
We're gonna live forever.
And now my dream is becoming reality.
Come on! Come on!
We're doing this tonight!
Come on! Come on!
Let's do this tonight!
Right now, you're all invited.
The ones back then that I have made it with.
You're all invited.
The ones back then that I have made it with.
