You never did, tell me what you wanted
I've been waiting, I've been taking notes
All along

What did you expect to happen,
When you left us out
Did you think we would give up? 
Just look at us now

It's not the same without you here,
And so we all agree
I really hope your dreams come true, 
And that you think about me

Absolutely lost and broken
How can you say we need you now?
We need you now and forever

[Chorus:]
You never did tell me what you wanted
I've been waiting, I've been taking notes, 
All along
For what you said, for what you did,
You've been waiting, you've been losing hope,
For so long

I thought you knew that this was coming,
I sung this just for you
But don't be afraid to sing along,
Because it's all that you can do

I hear your name a thousand times,
Everywhere I go
If it's declared that we've moved on,
I want everyone to know

Look at me now!

[Chorus:]
You never did tell me what you wanted
I've been waiting, I've been taking notes, 
All along
For what you said, for what you did,
You've been waiting, you've been losing hope,
For so long

Absolutely lost and broken
How can you say we need you now?
We need you now and forever
