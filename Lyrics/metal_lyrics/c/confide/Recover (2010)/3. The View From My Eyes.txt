After everything we've been through,
After all the times I've felt you,
You wouldn't think I'd ask you why I'm here.

It's all because I believe in you.
I know now you believe in me too.

I could not believe in all the things you told me
if you had never shown me.

After all the gaps I fell through,
After all the times I left you,
I wouldn't think your answer would be so clear.

It's all because I believe in you,
I know now you believe in me too.

This doesn't mean I'll stop.
I never thought that I'd believe
But now you feel so real to me.

I could not believe.
You showed me.
