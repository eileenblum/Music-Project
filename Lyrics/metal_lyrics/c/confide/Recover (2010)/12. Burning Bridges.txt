[iTunes Bonus Track]Tell me how you feel when my mind is,
Out line and not in your presence,
Tell me you're not here, but I'm choosing 
They're lies 

Because I know for sure you wont let go!
Theres no surprise to me anymore that you
Have my heart close to yours 
My mind is possessed with these thoughts.

Tell me how you feel when my mind is,
Out of line and not in your presence
Tell me you're not here, I find to think they're lies
[x2]

I don't know how it got to this,
I may seem lost and that's just it
You always showed me ways that you exist
All this time I've been the worst there is
But you always provided away out of this
You always provided away out of it

Tell me how you feel when my mind is,
Out of line and not in your presence
Tell me you're not here, I find to think they're lies
[x2]

I've been here for way to long
I've been here for way to long
It has to end, this has to end

I can not be the boy you want me to be,
I can not see, unless you show me 
I'm tired of waiting for the prize
Why can't I just realize

I don't know how it got to this,
I may seem lost and that's just it

Tell me how you feel when my mind is,
Out of line and not in your presence
Tell me you're not here, I find to think they're lies
[x2]
