Now and then
You'll show your face again
And you think we're still friends
But I know you all to well

(Where did you go?)
Back to where we started
(Where did you go?)
Back to all we know
(All we know)

So raise your hands and sing along
To a song about a broken one
Who's seen this all before
So raise your hands and sing along
To a song about a broken one
Who's seen this all before

We should be everything that we could be
If only you could see how much you mean to me

(Where did I go?)
Back to where I started
(Where did I go?)
Back to all I know
(All I know)

So raise your hands and sing along
To a song about a broken one
Who's seen this all before
So raise your hands and sing along
To a song about a broken one
Who's seen this all before

When did we turn from all we know? [x5]
(I don't remember letting go)
(Of these things I've been living for)

So raise your hand and sing along
To a song about a broken one
Who's seen this all before
I've seen this all before
