Don't turn your back on me
You're not my friend
If it was up to me
I'd never see you again
But the next best thing
Is that you're on your own
I really don't care where you go
It's not right that I'm thinking like this

[Chorus:]
Are you even listening
This can't be it
I've come to conclusion you're stuck in confusion
You left me alone when I needed you most
Is this it
Are you listening
I've come to conclusion you're stuck in confusion 
You left me alone when I needed you most

I know now that you don't understand
What it means to be a faithful friend
But I hope you realize on your own
The very best thing is that we still have hope

You never admit you're wrong
And I could never keep this to myself
You never admit you're wrong
Like I could never tell

[Chorus]

Don't tell me to close my mouth
Don't tell me to keep this down
This cannot be
You won't be laughing at me anymore

This cannot be
You won't be laughing at me at all

[Chorus]
