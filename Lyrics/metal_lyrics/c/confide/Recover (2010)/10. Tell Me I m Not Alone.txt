I know that you are right
I'm aware that you have plans
So I feel I need to sacrifice everything I want
And put it on hold
Although that we've been here 
A million times before
I know that I just need to trust
In everything that I've been told

So tell me I'm not alone
I really should have seen this coming
How could I be so blind?
Be honest, tell me something
Am I really that far behind?

I really should have seen this coming
How could I be so blind?
Be honest, tell me something
Am I really that far behind?

I know what I should do but I never did ask you
I'm in a rut and I need to get out
And the only way I know is to come to you
And show you that I'm still here
Even though I disappear from time to time
I've had myself in mind
I know it's not fair to either of us now

So tell me I'm not alone
I really should have seen this coming
How could I be so blind?
Be honest, tell me something
Am I really that far behind?

I really should have seen this coming
How could I be so blind?
Be honest, tell me something
Am I really that far behind?

If I'm farther down this road
Then when we started this
Then everything I know is waiting on a ship
To sail on my own uncharted waters there
Because I can't breathe the air here

So can you tell me I'm not alone in this?
So tell me I'm not alone in this
So can you tell me I'm not alone in this?
So tell me I'm not alone

I really should have seen this coming
How could I be so blind?
Be honest, tell me something
Am I really that far behind?

I really should have seen this coming
How could I be so blind?
Be honest, tell me something
Am I really that far behind?
