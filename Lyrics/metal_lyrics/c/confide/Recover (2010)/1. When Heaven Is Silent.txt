Just when I thought you had left me for dead, 
You show up and save me again.
Piecing things together like only you can do.
And when I thought I was alone till the end, 
You're right there and you assure me again.
You piece things together like only you can do.

I've waited too long to say...

I can try to make this work. 
I'll try my best this time 
And even though you've heard it all before, 
It's not that easy.
I can try to make this work. 
I'll try my best this time 
And even though you've heard it all before, 
It's not that easy.

I can see clear.
Now I realize that it's all in my head. 
I think you're gone but I'm gone instead.
Do I remember the way that I should be?
So when I'm missing what I need the most, 
I'm feeling lost and I think it shows 
That I don't remember the way that I should be.

I've waited too long to say...

I can try to make this work. 
I'll try my best this time 
And even though you've heard it all before, 
It's not that easy.
I can try to make this work. 
I'll try my best this time 
And even though you've heard it all before, 
It's not that easy.

(Can we try one more time?)
I need to feel you close to me.
You're someone I'll always long to be.
I'm lost but something's clear to me,
You're as close as I will let you be.
(One more time)
I need to feel you close to me.
You're someone I'll always long to be.
I'm lost but something's clear to me,
You're as close as I will let you be.

I can't believe this is what you have for me.
I can't do this on my own.
