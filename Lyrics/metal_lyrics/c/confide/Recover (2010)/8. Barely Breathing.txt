Can't take your eyes off me
There's something you don't see
I am the one that you've been thinking of
You're tearing at the seems
But we'll make this right you see
I am the one that you've been dreaming of

If this is what you want from me
You'll have to try harder then that
I want to know just what you see
You must know I'm not like that
Do you think we have life easy
I have to set you straight
Our life is not as you think it is
I hope you can see clearly now

Don't waste your life trying to live someone else's

Can't take your eyes off me
There's something you don't see
I am the one that you've been thinking of
You're tearing at the seems
But we'll make this right you see
I am the one that you've been dreaming of

We're staring at each other in the face
When will you learn I'm not easy to replace

Just watch yourself I'm not the same anymore
I've been waiting for someone like you
To come along, so I can say  
What you're thinking of me is all wrong
Well at least, most of it
I'm sad to say I'm not the one 
You'll ever want me to be

Don't waste your life trying to live someone else's

Can't take your eyes off me
There's something you don't see
I am the one that you've been thinking of
You're tearing at the seems
But we'll make this right you see
I am the one that you've been dreaming of

You think you know just how this goes
Don't believe what you've been told

You tell the world we've got it all
But we're barely breathing
You know the truth but you tell the world
You tell the world we've got it all
But we're barely breathing
You know the truth but you tell the world

Can't take your eyes off me
There's something you don't see
I am the one that you've been thinking of
You're tearing at the seems
But we'll make this right you see
I am the one that you've been dreaming of
