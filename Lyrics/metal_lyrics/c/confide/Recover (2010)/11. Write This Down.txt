The last thing I want to do is sit here
and write another song for you but God, you know.
God, you know I have to.

Is this what they want to hear?
I don't think they want to hear the truth but God, you know.
God you know I have to.

Don't forget to write this down, I'd rather now than later.
This will be the last time you hear from me, I guarantee.

I've got no place to go,
I'm waiting for a sign,
I'm putting up a fight,
I'm holding on.
When all is said and done,
I need to realise I'm fighting for my love.
You're by my side.

The worst part is I cannot lie,
I wish I could look you in the eye
and tell you how perfect I am.
But the truth spills out,
I am who I am.

I'm not saying what you want me to say,
It's not how you pictured this,
So the truth is out and you've come to see.
I'm not who you thought I was.

You never thought I would say this to you,
I'm just trying to tell you the truth.

I've got no place to go,
I'm waiting for a sign,
I'm putting up a fight,
I'm holding on.
When all is said and done,
I need to realise I'm fighting for my love.
You're by my side.
