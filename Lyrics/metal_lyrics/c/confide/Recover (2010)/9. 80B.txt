You want to know what's inside my head
But I don't want to leave you hanging
If you knew what's inside my head
You would have chose to ask me nothing

Separation is not the key
I don't feel you close to me
I don't see you where I turn
I understand but I never learn
The path I chose is not easy
I have to ask, are you here with me?
I know that I'm not trying hard enough at all

I never knew I was big enough to see it
I never knew that you would open up that door
I never thought I ever wanted to open it up
But now I'm standing here waiting for more
And I am waiting for more and I am yours

You want to know what's inside my head
But I don't want to leave you hanging
If you knew what's inside my head
You would have chose to ask me nothing

I need somebody to answer me
Is this really what it seems?
Do you expect me to believe
This gap inside is because of me?

I didn't think I could be wrong
I've been like this for way too long
I know that I'm not trying hard enough at all

I never knew I was big enough to see it
I never knew that you would open up that door
I never thought I ever wanted to open it up
But now I'm standing here waiting for more
And I am waiting for more and I am yours

I left all I had behind for you
I left all I had behind for you, oh

I am yours...
And I am waiting for more and I am yours
And I am waiting for more and I am yours
(I never knew I was big enough to see it)
(I never knew that you would open up that door)
(I never thought I ever wanted to open it up)
(But now I'm standing here waiting for more)
And I am waiting for more and I am yours
And I am waiting for more and I am yours
