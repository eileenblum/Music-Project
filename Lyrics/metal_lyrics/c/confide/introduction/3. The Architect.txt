You have carved these wings into my back &amp; taught me how to fly.
You betray the one you cal Father
I have been sent down to pursue your plan.
This blasphemy.
You are killing the mids of the children you swore to protect.
You have taken me in like your own.
Nothing will being you path.
For the greatness of this world
Raise your own
They will give everything for you.
Create what you've become.
But in your own company &amp; noting the color of white
