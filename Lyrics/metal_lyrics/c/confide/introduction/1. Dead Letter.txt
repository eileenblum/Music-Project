This envelope is sealed with a shadowed kiss.
To the one I love.
This will be my last reply.
Your toxic kiss on my mind.
Turn away from the skies.
You are the one who has left me to believe this is real.
Is this what our world has come to be.
Heaven is only a room away.
This will be my last reply.

Angel from below.
Make last this love.

Angel of my God.
I'll Wait For You.
I will wait for you
Make last this love.
