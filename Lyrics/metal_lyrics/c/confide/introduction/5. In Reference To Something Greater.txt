Distanced and torn between the truth and your lies, 
Which burned a hole in my skin so deep it doesn't bleed. 

Like you bled for me. 
You saved me. 

I live for you. 

Helpless. 

Fear what I am. 
This life is!.... yours.

Wake from your sleep. 
As blood spills from my throat. 
Please save me from this suicide. 
Your fate is my desire. 
Fall to your knees. 
Too your knees. 

I fall into your arms. Ive found you

As you take my life. I thank you. 
I fall into your arms. End my life. 

I lie among the dead. 
My thoughts deceived me.
