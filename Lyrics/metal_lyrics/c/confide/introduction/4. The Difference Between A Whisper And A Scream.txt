This distant nightmare. 
Come real.
Your tainted promises.
Dead is my decision to cry your name.
Hidden in sight again.
Your empty promise is the one that kills.
I fear the serpent's eyes.
Kill you ignorance.
You stand there watching me. 
True to your word.
Kill me with what you make of yourself.
My emptiness is light shown through you and de4ad to my life.
Lifeless.
Your hand determines my fate
Deceived by the crimson stains on your face. 
Your empty promises
Tearing at my flesh
I fear your tainted lied.
Kill your innocence
It's real
In my dreams
Unveiling
Unfailing.
