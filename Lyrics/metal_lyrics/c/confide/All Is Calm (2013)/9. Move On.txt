It's cold tonight.
I don't know how much longer
I can carry on.
I wonder if they know that
this smile was fake all along.
I tried my best to fit in
with people that don't even care.
It's time to move on from this
and take my life somewhere.

I've got my tips around your words.
I've got your goals over my own.
When will I ever really learn?
I want a life that is my own.

We can make all this better
one day at a time.
I just had to realize where my priorities lie.
I'll find out who really cares and I'll make my way right there
and I'm sure you'll hear real soon
that I'm fine and I pulled through.

All my anger, all my fear,
all my blood, sweat and tears.
I'm leaving behind.
