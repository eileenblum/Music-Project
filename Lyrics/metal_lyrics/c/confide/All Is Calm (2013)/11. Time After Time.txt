I was everything they talked about
When we were young and we were broken
Now I see with eyes wide open

I can't believe we're here again
And you're still the same
This time I can't hold back
From what I need to say

We were young and made mistakes that we can change
But I moved on since then
And you're still stuck in your old ways

Time after time we learned that we can't change the past
But lets move on we'll fill the cracks [x2]

You swear we're no different but we'll never be the same

I was everything they talked about
When we were young and we were broken
Now I see with eyes wide open

Why would they ever take me back I've fallen
Bury me deep beneath the ocean
I cannot breathe how did this happen
Confide - Time after time

I know you don't want to talk about forgiveness
But if it was the other way around
I know things would be different
How do you not understand that people can change
You've been holding on to this too long
It's time to forgive

Time after time we learned that we can't change the past
But lets move on we'll fill the cracks [x2]

I was everything they talked about
When we were young and we were broken
Now I see with eyes wide open

Why would they ever take me back I've fallen
Bury me deep beneath the ocean
I cannot breathe how did this happen

I don't want to live like this
I wish you'd come to your senses
We don't live perfect lives in a perfect world
And the sooner you realize
We can all go back to living our lives

I was everything they talked about
When I was young and I was stupid
Now I see with eyes wide open

Why would they ever take me back I've fallen
Bury me deep beneath the ocean
I cannot breathe how did this happen
