When breathing becomes too hard.
When close starts to feel too far.
Seems there's nothing that I can do.
I can't fool me anymore
and I promise that I will open up.

Just give me a voice 'cause I'm all out of words.
Don't give me a war 'cause I'm all out of swords.

Guess I can't see the other side,
where the sun shines bright and fills the sky.
When my dreams have all broken down,
let the light break right through the clouds.
Just give me some hope.
I can't take one more fight.
