I remember all the times we spent together when I was young.
You'd be there for me when I felt like I was all alone.
I would bring you back if I could.
It's hard to say it's too late,
but I'll pray every day
that you made it somewhere safe.

'Cause I wanna feel.
I won't let you go.
I won't let you go.

You were still so young when taken from us.
I hope you know haw far I'd go
to have you back for just one day.
I hope that I get to see your face again someday, until then.
I'll hold on tight to memories.

From a body to dust,
overnight gone from us.
I'll never feel the same
without you calling my name.
