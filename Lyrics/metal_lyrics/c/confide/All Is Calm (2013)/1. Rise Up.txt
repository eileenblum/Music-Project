We're not forced to fit in the crowd!
We're not forced to look a certain way!
We're not forced to sound like anyone!
We're not forced to act like we do!
So why do we choose to be the same?!
We're all the same!

Rise up
If you want to be, different!
If you want to sing, believe!
If you want to sing, you better make a, make a change!
Rise up
If you want to be, different!
If you want to sing, believe!
If you want to sing, in order to make a change!

Can you see that we were made,
For so much more than how we spend our days?!
We were told that we could live,
Forever but we took it for granted!
Warning signals have filled the air!
For indifference cause no one cares!
Will we ever want to change, the way we think,
We do this for ourselves!

For ourselves!

Rise up
If you want to be, different!
If you want to sing, believe!
If you want to sing, you better make a, make a change!
Rise up
If you want to be, different!
If you want to sing, believe!
If you want to sing, in order to make a change!

It's time to wear the truth!
And say everything we that were meant to be!

How are we so golden, with everything we have?!
So much grace we're blessed with but we're falling!
Apart.

Rise up...
Rise up...

Rise up!
If you want to be, different!
If you want to sing, believe!
If you want to sing, you better make a, make a change!
Rise up
If you want to be, different!
If you want to sing, believe!
If you want to sing, in order to make a change!
