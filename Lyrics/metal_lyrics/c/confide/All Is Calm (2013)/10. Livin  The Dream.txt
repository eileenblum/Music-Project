Quote on quote signed from the age of 18.
I'm on the road living my dream.
I didn't know what I'd signed up for.
Is this really what they call tour?
I'm in a van feeling home sick.
I never thought I'd get tired of this
but now I want home as much as I wanted to leave
and it's hard to believe.

Although I would do a few things differently,
I swear I wouldn't take back anything.
I just wish I'd of known the facts.

I waited so long,
come back to me,
come back to me.
I've missed this feeling
so come back to me.

Every sacrifice we made,
all the times we were away,
every night I had awake
was worth the time on this stage.
