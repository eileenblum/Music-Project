There's times I want to walk away.
I've been searching every day for somewhere to call home.
I'm picking up the pieces from where I left off.

They say home is where the heart is,
but where's my heart this time?
I thought this would be the last time,
but I can't stop changing my mind.
Where do I belong?
Have you heard this all before?
Can you hear my voice
or am I missing yours?

The worst thing I have left is,
is that I'm somewhere with someone and I don't belong
because no better how much I convince myself.
I know my actions and thoughts are wrong.
Where do I belong?
Have you heard this all before?
Can you hear my voice or am I missing yours?

Calm down so I can breathe you in.
