I see myself in front of you
Time and time again
I hope when the time comes
That you will let me in

I would take back all the time spent without you
'cause I'd be alone forever
Or we could be together

I would take back all the time spent without you
'cause I'd be alone forever
Or we could be together

All I need to know is you
I don't want to miss a thing
Everybody knows and everybody sees
You are the best of me

All I need to know is you
I don't want to miss a thing
Everybody knows and everybody sees
You are the best of me

Can it be you and me?
I swear I will wait
Can it be you and me?

Can it be you and me?
Sooner or later?
I swear I will wait till the end
Can it be you and me?
Sooner or later?
I swear I will wait till the end

I realize that without you
I'm alone until the end
You've been right by my side
Always there again and again

There is no place I would rather be
You're on my mind every moment of every day
But I can't find the words to say

There is no place I would rather be
You're on my mind every moment of every day
But I can't find the words to say

All I need to know is you
I don't want to miss a thing
Everybody knows and everybody sees
You are the best of me

All I need to know is you
I don't want to miss a thing
Everybody knows and everybody sees
You are the best of me

Can it be you and me?
Sooner or later?
Can it be?
Can it be?

Can it be you and me?
Sooner or later?
I swear I will wait till the end
Can it be you and me?
Sooner or later?
I swear I will wait till the end

Can it be you and me?
Sooner or later?
I swear I will wait till the end
