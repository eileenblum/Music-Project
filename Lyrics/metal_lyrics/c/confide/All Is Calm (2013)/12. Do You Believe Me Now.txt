How has it come to this?
I needed something more to hold on
I'm gonna break away
Open my eyes and take me,
Just take me,
Take me home.

Why does she have to be away, every single time.
Can't you see that I'm stained?
She won't be even trying
If she's the only one who's good for you, then don't forget
I could spend my time on other things
I want to break free.

I just want someone to love

How could it be?
When every time she wouldn't get me come to around me
She'll bite through that open door
Cut through my heart, watch me hit the floor
When do 1 + 1 become just you and nothing more.

I can't wait to see, you alive without me
I'm gonna watch her all fall down,
I'm gonna watch her in the ground.

You threw it away
I don't care what you have to say
Do you believe me now, believe me now?
I finally see a line
Now I'm walking away
Do you believe me now, believe me now?

So when you find the truth
And all you want is all you had
Nothing, Nothing you could do
To get embraced back
Cause you didn't trust me when you had the chance
So don't expect me to give you everything you want.

I just want someone to love

How could it be?
When every time she wouldn't get me come to around me
She'll bite through that open door
Cut through my heart, watch me hit the floor
When do 1 + 1 become just you and nothing more.

I can't wait to see, you alive without me
I'm gonna watch her all fall down
I'm gonna watch her in the ground

You threw it away
I don't care what you have to say
Do you believe me now, believe me now
I finally see a line
Now I'm walking away
Do you believe me now, believe me now

I'm never gonna give up
I'm never gonna.
I'm never gonna give up

I'll find love.
I'll find love.

Love.

Find me now
