The days are gone,
they pass us by,
we try so hard to hold on to time.
It's what we fear.
We're losing our minds
more and more each day that goes by.
It makes me sick,
we waste our lives living in the past,
open your eyes.
Your chance is now,
so take your life
and show the world that you're alive.

Time goes by,
we're fading away,
each day we're fading away.
Can't take back the hours that pass,
accept we're part of the past.

If we could change and go back in time,
would we make our future more bright?
Hope is here.
We have the chance
to live each day as if it's our last.
Don't be around those that bring you down.
Push forward and get yourself out.
Your chance is now,
so take your life
and show the world that you're alive.

This is your chance to make your life count.
Start living your future,
stop living your past.
