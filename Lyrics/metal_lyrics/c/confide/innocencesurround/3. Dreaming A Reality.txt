Walk this thin red line of life
Forgive the choice your soul has given
These falling tears
Run down mother Marys face
This rude awakening
Will let you know you always cared
But now
Your love

Is
Gone
Waking up to the memory of you
My body is numb
You weren't there
Until you were gone
Until you were

Gone
In My Arms
Ambiance
Behind
Tonight

Tonight
Waking up to the memory of you
My body is numb
You weren't there
Until you were gone
Until you
We miss you
