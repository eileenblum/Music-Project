I sit here, Looking on, Towards this light, In your eyes
Hypnotized, Memorized, Awkward silence, Was the sign
Stoned to death, Failed to please, Sinking in, Murder
I'll die, In time, This time, I'll die

Save me from this nothing

Why, won't you let, go, I'm killing myself through my senses
Why, why won't you, let go, I'm killing myself through you

Why won't you try?

Don't let this sadness take you
You've crossed this desert of shattered hopes
If you die I'll have nothing, don't leave me alone
I wont let you, drown in yourself

Please try. Move or you'll die, drown in lies. Why

Don't let this sadness take you.

They gave me a sign as I looked in their eyes. Their eyes

Call my name
Your life's in my voice and I'll try. I'll try

The nothing can't stop me now
Nothing can stop me now

Nothing can stop me now
Nothing, nothing can stop me
Nothing, he died in your eyes
Nothing, nothing can stop me
