The gun is covered
Until exposed by the truth
This bullet inked with greed
From the gluttons heart
In tongues he spoke

He cried out with pride
Saved with that of envy
Bathed in lust
Desire of you purified by hate

Die With me
Everything I know
Everything I know has killed you
Everything
The anger in your heart will not go
Unnoticed

Unnoticed

When will you hear
The shrieking of your shameful heart
That death has claimed many for his own
