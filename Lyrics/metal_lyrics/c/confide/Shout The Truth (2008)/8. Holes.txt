Oh, here it is again
Face to face with everything
That keeps bringing us down
So in me, and this place thats full of regret
You'll see that nothing is quite, perfect

Now, All eyes are focused on me
And everything I do is for only you
We didn't want it to be like this
We didn't want it to be like this

Oh believer, Theres things you've never seen
There's things you've never been told
Oh believer, Theres things you've never seen
There's things you've never been told

I pray to God, 
That the devil never sees my sorry face [x3]
I pray to God

So be for your safety
In a time when you have nothing, and no self control
Now take the respect you won from your most, meaningful
It's all you have left to show

Now, All eyes are focused on me
And everything I do is for only you
We didn't want it to be like this
We didn't want it to be like this

Oh believer, Theres things you've never seen
There's thigns you've never been told
Oh believer, Theres things you've never seen
There's thigns you've never been told

I pray to God, 
That the devil never sees my sorry face [x3]
I pray to God
