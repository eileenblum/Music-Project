The great wall that stands between the lost 
and the seen and the lies we let sink in.

What is this? We've broken the trust of a fallen man. 
So quick to pick you up but quicker to put you down. 
No actions have been thought through by the both of us now. 
Can we wait to see if they ever understand.

I am the words when you are silent. 
I am the comfort when you're gone. 
I am the thought behind your actions. 
I'm on the end of your last breath.

I can be whoever you want me to. I can be... 

I won't compromise this time. 
You can't take what's mine.

Give in now, I can never forget the things you said. 
I'll look to where I'm known the most for my escape. 
They won't stop buying your smile they wont stop they wont stop.

I am the words when you are silent. 
I am the comfort when you're gone. 
I am the thought behind your actions. 
I'm on the end of your last breath.

I can be whoever you want me to. I can be... 

Your eyes can wait, what do they want to see? 
If I walk away from everything would that be it? 
You caught me living my life as someone else.
I am the words when you are silent. 
I am the comfort when you're gone. 
I am the thought behind your actions. 
I'm on the end of your last breath.
