[Re-Release Only]Iâve been looking for, 
looking for the tag thatâs been tied around my neck.
Iâve been searching for, 
searching for an identity thatâs found in You.
Because I know thereâs times when I feel your afar and thereâs times when
I know I am further and thereâs times when I really feel Iâm alive and 
thereâs times when I feel thereâs no-one in sight.

Recently weâve been holding on to everyoneâs last breath,
And letting it replay in our head.

I realized I was in too deep.
You never had to explain yourself to me.

How can we hide from our cold insides?
I canât live side by side the description youâre giving me. 
I find myself in something bigger than the size of your lips.

Take a step back, hold your thoughts. 
It was never too easy for you.
Iâve found a peace in silence, as I listen, Iâm lost for thought.

Recently weâve been holding on to everyoneâs last breath,
And letting it replay in our head.

How can we hide from our cold insides?
How can we hide from the one who never blinks?
