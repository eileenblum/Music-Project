So lets piece things together from now on one by one
I'm hoping you know the way, because I'm so alone
Taking what you have for granted is a mistake you always made.
I'm hoping you know the way because I'm so alone

Just Know, I'm relieved, things are clear
my feet are where they should be.
Can you do this without me?

You're there everytime
You're there for everything

My God, I can see clearly why I'm calling you
I can see clearly why I need you
