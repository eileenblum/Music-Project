Honestly, were you sleeping? 
Reach out, touch me now
Where can I take my dirt filled head?
Where can I take my past where no one can see?
I'm at the foot of your cross but I'm a wreck.
Im stumbling, I cant see straight.

[Bridge:]
Will you still love me when, I am selfish and
I never seem to show you my face?

[Chorus:]
I need to ask, 
what is the name of God on my lips?
Is there something I missed?
I'm holding on by my fingertips
I need to ask, 
what is the name of God on my lips?
Is there something I missed?
I'm holding on, I'm holding on

I should know where to draw the line, 
But sometimes I get dragged and I
Can't face the consequence. 
I want to see the world through your eyes
I want to see how hurt you are
I want to take out my insides, 
And burry the bad in the earth

Is there a stone around my neck?  
Am I somewhere else instead?
Is there a stone around my neck?  
Am I somewhere else instead?

[Bridge:]
Will you still love me when, 
I am selfish and
I never seem to show you my face?

[Chorus:]
I need to ask, 
what is the name of God on my lips?
Is there something I missed?
I'm holding on by my fingertips
I need to ask, 
what is the name of God on my lips?
Is there something I missed?
I'm holding on, I'm holding on

I'll sit for hours until 
I can't think anymore, 
About the world we live in without love
But you're still here

Is there a stone around my neck?  
Am I somewhere else instead?
Is there a stone around my neck?  
Am I somewhere else instead?
Is there a stone around my neck?  
Am I somewhere else instead?
Is there a stone around my neck? 
Am I somewhere else?
