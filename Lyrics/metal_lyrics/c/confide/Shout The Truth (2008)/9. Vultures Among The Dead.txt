You watched me fall
You never take your eyes off me
Who am I to ever leave your side when I am lead to believe
that temptations not a living disease.

And although, I'm like this at times, 
you'll still see the cross at the back of my eyes.
Thin ice is beneath our feet as we fight

You watched me fall
You never take your eyes off me
Who am I to ever leave your side when I am lead to believe
that temptations not a living disease.

Face it, face it, climb out of this hole you live in.
Face it, face it, escape from a world your leading.

And although, I'm like this at times, 
you'll still see the cross at the back of my eyes.
Thin ice is beneath our feet as we fight

This was it for a short time until eventually I could see 
and when it's all over, Thank God for forgiveness.

There's a light
When your done tonight, 
you've done alright, 
you got what you wanted

Find yourself and never fall back. 
You have your life on the line, it's all too much.

And although, I'm like this at times, 
you'll still see the cross at the back of my eyes.
Thin ice is beneath our feet as we fight.

When your done tonight, 
you've done alright, 
you got what you wanted

This was it for a short time until eventually I could see 
and when it's all over, Thank God for forgiveness.
