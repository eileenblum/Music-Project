I was backed in a corner, and left myself no room at all
I left myself wide open to fear
And in the end, so vulnerable

You will take back every word you said
You will take back every word you said

[Chorus]
Show me how to pull back from the thought that seems to
Break me apart, and hold me down
Show me a way back to you, When I'm so deep in fear
And I feel there is no escape
I can't hear your voice but i hear

"Can you breathe as I'm halfway down your throat?
As I'm the weight that's resting on your chest. 
As I'm the pressure thats weakening your lungs."

This feeling just keeps repeating
I know it's got a hold on me
I've been left alone for too long (or thats just how it seems)

Drag me out alive from this
Thats all I need right now
And when its over, I'm over this
You'll see how weak I was.

[Chorus]
Show me how to pull back from the thought that seems to
Break me apart, and hold me down
Show me a way back to you, When I'm so deep in fear
And I feel there is no escape
I can't hear your voice but I hear myself

I believe that we can make it
Just settle down settle down
I believe that we can make it
Just settle down settle down

I believe that we can make it
(I've got a feeling it's beginning to make sense)
Just settle down settle down
(I've got a feeling that this is over)
I believe that we can make it
(I've got a feeling it's beginning to make sense)
Just settle down settle down
(I've got a feeling that this is over)

I believe that we can make it [x4]
Just settle down settle down
