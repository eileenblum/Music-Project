We need to break the mold
and hope there's something more to
This wretched place called home, 
That we continue to drown in 
We must be more than this
Something had to be said before we, 
Followed the footsteps, of everyone else

[Chorus]
The world has eyes to see, between you and me
and how cruel we are

Tell me I am born, 
Tell me I'm worth the ground you walked on
Tell me I am born, 
Tell me I'm worth the ground you walked on

O God can you keep me grounded?  
I don't wanna let it pull me under
O God keep me grounded, 
I don't wanna let it pull me
under keep me grounded, 
Don't let this pull me under
O God keep me grounded, 
Don't let this pull me under

Why do we continue to, 
Live day by day without you?
Are we too proud, 
To ever move out from your comfort?
Now I could never live without 
The strong beat that continues to
Get me through these days
That are getting colder in this dying land

[Chorus]
The world has eyes to see, 
Between you and me
And how cruel we are

Tell me I am born, 
Tell me I'm worth the ground you walked on
Tell me I am born, 
Tell me I'm worth the ground you walked on

[Chant]
Tell me I am born, 
Tell me I'm worth the ground you walked on
Tell me I am born, 
Tell me I'm worth the ground you walked on

I'm not home, until I'm done in this place
I'm not home, until I'm done in this place
I'm not home

This is so clear to me
This is understanding
