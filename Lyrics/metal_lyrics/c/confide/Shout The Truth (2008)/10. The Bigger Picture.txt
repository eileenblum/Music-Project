Lately I've been feeling a light.
Alive at last
My eyes have been opened and I can see the path ahead.
Tear down the walls thats been made around you.
Escape to see.
Its what you've been waiting for.
I can see my world.
PULL YOURSELF UP.
I can see my world.
Pull yourself up.

Oh do you feel alive? 
Can you feel the thirst? 
Can you feel the light? 
What a great move at last.

Do you feel the light? 
Can you feel the thirst? 
Can you feel the light? 
What a great move at last.

This is Perfect
This is a Plan
