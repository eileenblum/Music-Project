When your money is no good, and your mouth is sealed shut
We're moving, We're moving ... Out
And how often did you say, you wanted things your way?
We're moving, We're moving ... Out

Is it too much to ask for?
Open your eyes and see
It's not too hard to believe, We're in Way Too Deep
Is it to much to ask for?
Open your eyes and see
It's not to hard to believe, We're in way too deep

I've been told it's not too long
I know it's not that easy
I've been holding on to this
Do you understand?

Stop and listen
Can you hear me now?
It isn't always the hard side you have to face
Unless you want to, we could be here for days

There's a light you think is hidden that
Will be shown if you ask
There's a light that can bring you surface
When you think its over

As fire glazes the city
Our eyes are forced shut, and our hands have never held so tight
Buildings fall
And punctured lungs fail to breathe beneath the rubble

We're as dead as
Our chests that pour evil
