Spread out spread apart lets tell the world. 
There's something burning through my skin. 
I'm going to reach the ends of this ground. 
Everybody needs to know we won't be silenced this time. 
We're going to love like you've never seen, like you've never seen.

Dancer dancer keep your feet in time and inside the lines

Everybody is starting to wonder what I'm talking about. 
How can I explain this? My God, explain yourself.

Time's running out and this feeling is getting way too old. 
I can say i believed every word you said. 
I always got what I wanted. It never hit so hard. 
I've never been so unexpectant. 
I couldn't stop this if I tried.

Dancer dancer keep your feet in time and inside the lines.

We're moving forward we're not looking back and we won't be stopped.
