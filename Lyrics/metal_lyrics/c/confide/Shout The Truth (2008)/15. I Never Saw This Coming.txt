[Re-Release Only]What have you done? What have you done this time?
Am I so different? Am I acting out of line?
There is no place I'd rather be right now. 
I follow the light in the center. I follow you forever.

Follow you now, I've been gone too long.

I feel it in my bones. This was truth. This was the truth.

I've never felt this way before, did you see it coming?

I mean it when I said "I'm never coming home". 
You thought you knew me all along and you said I wouldn't change
at all. 
I remember when we could last this out. 
Was your only intention to drag me down?

I feel it in my bones. This was truth. This was the truth.

Can you see where we both are now? 
And how hopeless you've become?
Are the nights you spend alone becoming old?
Are you feeling this? Are you feeling this?

I feel it in my bones. This was truth. This was the truth.
