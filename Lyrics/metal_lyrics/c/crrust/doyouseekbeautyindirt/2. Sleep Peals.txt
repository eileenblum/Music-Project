Stuck in my sight it's sealing off all the guilt
Deep in the vortex with nowhere to quit to left
Left unprotected for memories to fade
Flatterned by the weight of the oncoming hate
Oncoming hate
Oncoming hate
Oncoming hate

Pinned to the wall by the truth and the fistings
Peeling sences off it opens the instincts
Following guidelines and ripping out fears
Smashing through walls and breaking your spears
Breaking your spears
Breaking your spears
Breaking your spears

Going through space it brings out the ashes
Scattered by the winds to hilite the importance
Of this very moment supposing it is worth the time, the effort -
Something like a chore left off somewhere in the beginning,
When it all was grayscale and therefor remained unattended
For ages, but in fact it was something more - it was

The end

And if I've failed I'm sorry
And if failed don't worry
