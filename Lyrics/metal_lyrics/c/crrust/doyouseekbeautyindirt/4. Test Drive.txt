This was a test drive heading the lane
The sound of the tollbooth pride shaked up this grey frame
In this we all are flapping our body's fame
Shaking off the remains of the vigorous blame

I pollute everything I see
I pollute everything visible
I see everything
So therefor...

Fly away, bolt off to the air
There's nothing to it
Fly away, bolt off to the air
There's nothing to it

Like the crowd out front the mausoleum
Never different never alike
You remain a quiz for yourself and the others
Just like me but sadly though I haven't found you yet

Fly away, bolt off to the air
There's nothing to it
Fly away, bolt off to the air
There's nothing to it

Push me away
