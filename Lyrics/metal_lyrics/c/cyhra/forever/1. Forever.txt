Just beyond the end of time
In a world that's yet to come
After we have lived a thousand lives
You and I might meet again
Innocent and unafraid
Feel the love that time I will survive

Once unspoken pain then will disappear
Maybe someday far from here

Till forever, till the last tear has finally fallen down
Love will find us in a brand new life
Till forever, time for our heart to heal
I'll be waiting on the other side

People pass me on the street
As another day goes by
Sea of strangers on the borderline

My confession, it shattered as worlds collide
Unforgiven, undefined

Till forever, till the last tear has finally fallen down
Love will find us in a brand new life
Till forever, time for our heart to heal
I'll be waiting on the other side

And now the shadows
The start of a lonely night
Why would I need you by my side
