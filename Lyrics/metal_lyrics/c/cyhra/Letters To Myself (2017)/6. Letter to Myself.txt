Scattered dreams
Collect what I used to be
This fight is an infinite maze
A hunt but without the chase

Reject the cure
My symptoms, your metaphor
Immortal yet still so feeble
Half human addictive evil

For a life I obsessed you
Now it's time to forget you
And no matter how hard, I try
Cross your heart and swear you'll try

I am full of forgiveness
Let me out of this illness
There's a reason I stand revived
No more fears where tears don't dry

I write these lines
A crossword with random rhymes
Expressing the voice within me
The scars that won't ever leave me

Escaped it all
Imprisoned with hollow bars
Reducing my own desire
By calling myself a liar

For a life I obsessed you
Now itâs time to forget you
And no matter how hard, I try
Cross your heart and swear you'll try

I am full of forgiveness
Let me out of this illness
There's a reason I stand revived
No more fears where tears don't dry

I run
I cry
Please wait for me
I hold my breath just as I'm
Drowning
Feels like I'm
Flying

For a life I obsessed you
Now it's time to forget you
And no matter how hard, I try
Cross your heart and swear you'll try

I am full of forgiveness
Let me out of this illness
There's a reason I stand revived
No more fears where tears don't dry
