What more can a man do than do the right thing right?
I came to the crossroad while my mind wondered
Where would I be
What would I become
And the mask is burning
The heart aches from the path of errors
I'm infected through addiction, and I live a life
But my sanity belongs since long to evil
To who it may concern
Live, with a notion
To scars that you can't see, but I
I will come out stronger
And in a long run, a winner
Over my greatest fucking enemies
You are all dead
To me

I tell you I am sorry, I cursed you
I'm under your skin
I am a burden a leech that is buried within
I am pollution, I'm darkness
The scars you can't see
I am the fire that burns when there's nothing to win

Mistake me for a liar
Higher, my purpose in life
Was just to spread feelings and laughter but look at me now
You made me weak and I'm fragile and cold
Why do I have to make this journey
All by my own

What more can a man do, I am infected
My sanity's clear, what will it become of me
Will you please forgive me, find the answer
I'm righting my wrongs
Will questions conclude what went wrong

What more can a man do, I am infected
My sanity's clear, what will it become of me
Will you please forgive me, find the answer
I'm righting my wrongs
Will questions conclude what went wrong

I came to the crossroad while my mind wondered
Where would I be
What would I become

I tart to build up anger within me
It runs through my veins
I am electric, I'm screaming
Let go of this pain
I am confronting my demons to win
This is a battle I must conquer in this pendulum swing
Cause this is now I get out of here

What more can a man do, I am infected
My sanity's clear, what will it become of me
Will you please forgive me, find the answer
I'm righting my wrongs
Will questions conclude what went wrong
