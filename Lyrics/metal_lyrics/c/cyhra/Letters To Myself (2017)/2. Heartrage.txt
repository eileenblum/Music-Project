They told me to be strong
Prolong
Ambivalent
The future was my past
I was decadent
I felt my heart beat like
A beating drum

I know that I was blind, alone
Uncertainly, I left without a sound
Afraid my enemy
A constant battle that keeps going on

Headstrong I fell into oblivion
Revenge is burning in my mind

So this is how you're killing me
Feeding my anxiety
When there's no tears left to cry
We're all destined to die
Tell me why you're killing me
My independency
I put my life on the line
I'm preventing my final demise

Was I the one that sold a false conspiracy
Hold on tight, it empowers me
To take this final battle for another spin

I know that I am my own worst enemy
I hold the future in my hands

So this is how you're killing me
Feeding my anxiety
When there's no tears left to cry
We're all destined to die
Tell me why you're killing me
My independency
I put my life on the line
I'm preventing my final demise

I see my pain reflecting in the hundred thousand pieces
Scattered all around me from the mirror
Now we're even
After all these years
Feel my blood and tears
Ain't saying I am a saint you say I hurted you
I am picking up the pieces
I am leaving you
Time to say farewell
We will never meet again

So this is how you're killing me
Feeding my anxiety
When there's no tears left to cry
We're all destined to die
Tell me why you're killing me
My independency
I put my life on the line
I'm preventing my final demise
