You know that feeling when you're lonely
But got no one to call
And you're concealing your own misery
Got nothing to live for

You are the preacher of insanity
This is the lesson for your dignity

I know you're walking in circles
You try to hide your dysfunction
You're feeling captured
As you've taken every shortcut to function

You know I'm in your mind
It's time to start another rescue ride
Tonight we fight

There's nothing left to lose
Hang on
I feel your pain
But we are here
To guide you all the way
You need to open up your eyes
Tonight we fight
It's time you let it go
Away
I know your fears
We're all ashamed
We all seek sympathy
You need to claim your hollow soul
The future is calling for you

You know that hunger you can't handle
When you're under the pressure
You wish for someone to
Remote you through the end of the letter

You are a candle on a stormy day
This a battle you must fight afraid

I know we face a disclosure
And I'm about to cross over
It' s a submissive combination
When you burn every border

You know I'm in your mind
It's time to start another rescue ride
Tonight we fight

There's nothing left to lose
Hang on
I feel your pain
But we are here
To guide you all the way
You need to open up your eyes
Tonight we fight
It's time you let it go
Away
I know your fears
We're all ashamed
We all seek sympathy
You need to claim your hollow soul
The future is calling for you

There's nothing left to lose
Hang on
I feel your pain
But we are here
To guide you all the way
You need to open up your eyes
Tonight we fight
It's time you let it go
Away
I know your fears
We're all ashamed
We all seek sympathy
You need to claim your hollow soul
The future is calling for you
