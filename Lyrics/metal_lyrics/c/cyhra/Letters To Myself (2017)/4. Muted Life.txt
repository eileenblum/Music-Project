Falling
Higher
Stimulate my muted life
Screaming
Fold your eyes

Stalling visions
Crawling
Missing
Hope
When there's no time to run

When is it time to run
Is this my chance to start a fire?
I'll be the first in line
To see your world go down in flames

Facing the border
You trust
In dreams you falter
Faith and pride

I am silenced by "brothers"
But I resuscitate my strife
Is this my place to die?

When is it time to run
Is this my chance to start a fire?
I'll be the first in line
To see your world go down in flames

When is it time to run
Is this my chance to start a fire?
I'll be the first in line
To see your world go down in flames

When is it time to run
Is this my chance to start a fire?
I'll be the first in line
To see your world go down in flames

When is it time to run
Is this my chance to start a fire?
I'll be the first in line
To see your world go down in flames
