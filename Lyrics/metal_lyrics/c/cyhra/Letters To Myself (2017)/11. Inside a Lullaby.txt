You fold your arms around me
The world embrace and lift the fear
Won't be missed 'till it disappears

Can't siege this growing hunger
I hear you whisper in my ear
I'll be here

So this is why I cry when I'm asleep
I am fragile I feel weak
Without you I feel hollow
I'm alive
I dream with open eyes
When darkness turns to white
The moment when your life's inside a lullaby

I know I hurt your feelings
I'm hanging on for one more day
And I know what you've done for me
We are alike though different
We are together yet apart
In our hearts

So this is why I cry when I'm asleep
I am fragile I feel weak
Without you I feel hollow
I'm alive
I dream with open eyes
When darkness turns to white
The moment when your life's inside a lullaby

So this is why I cry when I'm asleep
I am fragile I feel weak
Without you I feel hollow
I'm alive
I dream with open eyes
When darkness turns to white
The moment when your life's inside a lullaby
