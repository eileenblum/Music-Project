I live with a dream
To master the stars
To gather the oceans
And draw them apart
And all these tears your shed in vain
Belongs to me
You will never get me

I fought to stay alive
As my dreams collide
Got nowhere left to hide
I was forced to abide

When there's nothing left to prove
I'm coming to get you

I am alive
And I will stay
Come and feel my flame
And as darkness hanging over you
I am here to save you
I am your pain, I am your goal
I am what's lost inside your soul
But I am here to make it go away
Still you wait until the break of day

I'm turning away
I'm losing my mind
Got nowhere to go
Got nowhere to hide
And all these fires that extinguish our flame
Let's burn this masquerade

A slave for humankind
I made sure I would survive
To stay alive
Now it's time to move on

When there's nothing left to prove
I'm coming to get you

I am alive
And I will stay
Come and feel my flame
And as darkness hanging over you
I am here to save you
I am your pain, I am your goal
I am what's lost inside your soul
But I am here to make it go away
Still you wait until the break of day

When there's nothing left to prove
When there's nothing left to prove
I'm coming to get you

I am alive
And I will stay
Come and feel my flame
And as darkness hanging over you
I am here to save you
I am your pain, I am your goal
I am what's lost inside your soul
But I am here to make it go away
Still you wait until the break of day
