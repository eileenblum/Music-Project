I am losing all my sympathy
A reflective dance with misery
'Cause in 18.000 days
Our own hearts cease to obey

I'm romancing a clichÃ©
In this life we portray
We conduct our own demise
I want to break out
I want to break out now

I always saw myself as "come and get me"
I never thought that I would let you in
Some say that I have always lacked control
I'm balancing my deviant revolt

I never thought that I was here to save you
If someone told me I would die alone
This is a battle against my own relief
It's hard to face the fact you're on your own

Through these battles
I allude myself
While debating my indifference
Keep the pressure
See it heal
I am scared to be relieved

I am dreaming of a day when I don't feel a thing
A repulsive piece of mind
I want to break out
I want to break out now

I always saw myself as "come and get me"
I never thought that I would let you in
Some say that I have always lacked control
I'm balancing my deviant revolt

I never thought that I was here to save you
If someone told me I would die alone
This is a battle against my own relief
It's hard to face the fact you're on your own

I always saw myself as "come and get me"
I never thought that I would let you in
Some say that I have always lacked control
I'm balancing my deviant revolt

I never thought that I was here to save you
If someone told me I would die alone
This is a battle against my own relief
It's hard to face the fact you're on your own
