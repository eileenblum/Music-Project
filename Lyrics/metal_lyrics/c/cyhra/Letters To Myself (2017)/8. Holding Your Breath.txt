You tell me you're sorry
You tell me you're holding your breath for me
I see you fight through another day
I know it's hard for you
The weight on your shoulders
You are the one for me
I love you 'til the day I go under

I see how you're hurting
I feel like I'm chained to a wall
I wanna be near you
To help you regain your control
But every step will take me back to the start
I
Want you to know you are the center of my heart
And
You need to understand
I'll stay with you through heaven and hell

But you keep smother me relentlessly
Please carry me home
Future is my enemy
I am not dying here alone
Save me from insanity
Just give me wings to fly
My precious life
'Cause I am way too young to die!

I used to be a drifter
I was used to walk alone
When I met you all my darkness disappeared
You were the one
That showed me how to live
Instead of whom to be
I had no option to surrender your divinity

And I was selling my soul for dirt
Anything for money
Pawned my dreams so I could lead your way
But every step will take me back to the start
I
Want you to know you are the center of my heart
And
All I ever wanted was for you to love me

But you keep smother me relentlessly
Please carry me home
Future is my enemy
I am not dying here alone
Save me from insanity
Just give me wings to fly
My precious life
'Cause I am way too young to die!

But you keep smother me relentlessly
Please carry me home
Future is my enemy
I am not dying here alone
Save me from insanity
Just give me wings to fly
My precious life
'Cause I am way too young to die!
