I know we're used to fighting
Indifference contrived
You make it disappear in a blink of an eye
It makes me come clean
I need to come clean

'cause you're my only passion
The balance
The pain
Abandoned like a stranger
Alone in the rain
I know you see me
But please just leave me

Heal my heart
Remove my remedy
Let my soul be saved
'cause tomorrow
It might be far too late

When there's no one to blame
And you're left with shame
I'm standing alone
Left to fight off my demons
As you rise from the dead
All those lies you've read
I'm turning my head
As I fight off my demons

I know we're used to fighting
For difference we strive
To make our voices heard
In this carousel called life
It makes me come clean
I need to get clean

'Cause you're the only one
I ever loved in this life
And I don't ever wanna lose you
Yet I'm done with this fight
I know you see me
But please just leave me

Heal my heart
Remove my remedy
Let my soul be saved
'cause tomorrow
It might be far too late

When there's no one to blame
And you're left with shame
I'm standing alone
Left to fight off my demons
As you rise from the dead
All those lies you've read
I'm turning my head
As I fight off my demons

When there's no one to blame
And you're left with shame
I'm standing alone
Left to fight off my demons
As you rise from the dead
All those lies you've read
I'm turning my head
As I fight off my demons
