I haven't eaten, drinking or been up for days
I'm walking 'round in circles with an endless headache

I feel misplaced tonight
We're getting back to square one
Our journey has begun
The future we outrun

But you will always be my brainchild of passion

I am the child from the stars
That got lost in the dark
Between heaven and hell
I am forced to live on
I am the cause when you sin
I am the demon you skin
But there is no more tears to beautify
This is my last goodbye

Getting ready to fight
We fight for our lives
We're buried in trenches
We're bruising our minds
And every single argument's like walking on glass
Whatever the setback
I'll never look back

So this is how your life's supposed to be?

I am the child from the stars
That got lost in the dark
Between heaven and hell
I am forced to live on
I am the cause when you sin
I am the demon you skin
But there is no more tears to beautify
This is my last goodbye

I am the child from the stars
That got lost in the dark
Between heaven and hell
I am forced to live on
I am the cause when you sin
I am the demon you skin
But there is no more tears to beautify
This is my last goodbye

I am the child from the stars
That got lost in the dark
Between heaven and hell
I am forced to live on
I am the cause when you sin
I am the demon you skin
But there is no more tears to beautify
This is my last goodbye
