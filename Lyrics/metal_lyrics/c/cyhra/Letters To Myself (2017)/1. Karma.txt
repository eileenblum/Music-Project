We're like a virus that refuse to fade away
A realization we are to convey
Reach our limits and no matter
The price we will go our way

Forever
One world stabilized
Re-entered
We will rise

Kill me I'm out of here
Grieve
What's been said and done
Break break
Me out and you will be outrun

Kill me I'm out of here
Grieve
What's been said and done
Break break
Me out and you will be outrun

You try to kill us
But we'll stand the end of days
Consumed by greed
You trade your hearts away
You don't practise what you preach
Well you're planting your own dismay

Blood brothers
Lost along the ride
Forever
Crucified

Kill me I'm out of here
Grieve
What's been said and done
Break break
Me out and you will be outrun

Kill me I'm out of here
Grieve
What's been said and done
Break break
Me out and you will be outrun

Kill me I'm out of here
Grieve
What's been said and done
Break break
Me out and you will be outrun

Kill me I'm out of here
Grieve
What's been said and done
Break break
Me out and you will be outrun
