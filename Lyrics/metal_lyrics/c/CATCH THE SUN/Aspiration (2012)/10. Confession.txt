It's hard to change this world,
Forget all the pain you have ever felt.
Ascension of the senses leads to the death, to the suffering.
Hypocrisy and contempt.
Above the rest.
Never lose your face.

Gather you will,
Never give up,
Day of redemption will come,
But no one repents.
Escape for your soul,
Leave your past.

But we are obsessed,
We are obsessed with delusions of grandeur.

Leave all that precious for you,
Look what surrounds you around.
This your resurgence.
Never lose your way and don't fall back.

Feel the lights of the sun on your face,
To find your new dream.

Gather you will
Until th end,
Trust your heart
And you will never lose.
This way is hard.
Overcome the pain,
To correct the past.

Savior had been betrayed,
And the darkest days comes in the world.
No one repents,
No one will save.
Confession exchanged for thirty pieces of silver.
You will remain alone.

Your heart turn to ice.

Bleeding to death,
Fight to the finish.
You must survive,
Survive at any cost.

You will search this source,
That will stoke the ice.
I'll give you a sign:
Look at the sky.
Look at the sky.
