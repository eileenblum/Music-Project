It makes no sense to be afraid.
You will not feel the fear,
I promise you'll be free.

I can't stay here.
You see a light up stars,
They fall shining for the last time.

Sensation of flying,
Higher and higher,
Spotlights make me blind.
To be the center of the world.

Listen, what i say to you,
I don't care, what you think about me,
Maybe my dreams unreal, but i'm free.
Your envy is absurd,
Don't try to stop me.

Forget about everything you wanted.
No place to stay, no love.

These moments, nothing else,
Got everything i wanted,
Sensation of flying, higher and higher,
But i was wrong. (but i was wrong)

Nothing lasts forever,
I am falling down,
See the stars still shining, but not for me.
I'm falling down.
