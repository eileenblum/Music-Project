Wander in the dark,
To lose last hope.
We still believe,
That we'll find way out.
There is nothing to remain.

The sky above us,
There someone who will never leave you.
Wherever you are in the darkness, there is a ray of light,
I see it in your heart.
It will point your way and give a hope to you.

But you remember,
Never surrender.
We fall and don't fall back,
Erase the past,
Revive the glory.

But there is nothing to say,
And there is no need in words.
We have a strenght,
But we can't save this world.

Forget what happened yesterday.
Doesn't look back.
The sun goes down.
The sky above us.

Do you know what is death?
Feel the creator.
You can't turn back the past,
Just wait for the sunrise.
