Without sleep and full of fear,
Beads of sweat running down my face.
I hear the ticking of the clock.
This night will never end.

The dawn is only thing i'm waiting for,
waiting for the years.

The walls of mud and pain around me.
I find myself in place of my fears,
Where i was over and over again every night,
My fear revived before my eyes.

You take me by the throat,
I can not breathe.
You kill me and take off your mask,
But I can not see your face.

Here and now i draw a nightmare,
That cursed me every night.
I give him life,
Now i'm your nightmare.
This is my world.

My visions don't deceive me,
The light comes after darkness,
with the flare of light everything will die.

Last chance to leave this place.
I should have time,
I run away.
I need to open my eyes.
