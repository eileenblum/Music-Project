The world fades,
But only not for you.
Your image is perfect,
Your face of an angel.

All the beautiful pales.
I have never been a god, but i tried,
And i believed in you.
You're forever young,
You're forever young,
You're forever young,
Don't fall apart.

There is to much deception.
Take everything,
Nothing to regret,
But you will die in your desires.

More sensations for you.
You will not survive,
Not survive.

Beauty can give you more,
But you're dead inside.
Try to feel.
The most beautifull thing,
But i can't save.
Your my mistake.

I create you,
You are monster.
There is no soul,
Only your reflection.
Your my mistake,
But don't give up.

Leave the darkness behind,
Bring the light in this world,
Don't fall back,
And only god can save you.

Still have a chance
To learn this world,
To correct mistakes.
You are forever young.
