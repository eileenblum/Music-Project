She was perfect all over time,
I want give you more, but i never can.
I lost my voice,
Couldn't say anymore,
And those seconds I'll never forget.

But your cold eyes cuts my heart.
The most beautiful, that i have ever seen.
I froze, i was blind of your charms.
The world doesn't worried me.

Immortal queen,
Your proud sight i ask:
What did i do wrong?
My fate is indifferent for you.

My sorrow kills me inside.
To lose your love forever.
I am ready to give you my life,
With last dying breath

Feel insane.
I can't understand.
What's going on with me?
You belongs my destiny.
My sorrow kills me inside.

Queen of spades.
I'm doomed to die.

I'm losing the will,
Can't resist your anymoe.
I can't live any longer.
I have no strength to endure my suffering,
To endure my pain.

Ocean will share my life with your.
There will be no words.
You won't see me.

I wanted to tell you a lot,
And i would like to hear you all the time,
But now i'm nothing,
But now i'm ocean,
But now i'm silent forever.
