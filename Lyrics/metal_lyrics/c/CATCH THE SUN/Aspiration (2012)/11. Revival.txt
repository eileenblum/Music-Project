Search, overcame the pain,
Break everything, that prevents on my way.
I left my life behind.

The surge of my emotions,
How much seductions.
Surrender return,
In order to survive.

The stars shine stronger,
High overhead.
They want my fall,
But i won't give up.

Blinding light comes down.
I think i found, what i was looking for.
The way to upward waits for me.
You leave this world every day,
Hidden behind the horizon.

When the darkness everywhere,
Until tha dawn,
The death walks beside.

I swallow the air.
I am on the way to the sun.
I want reborn,
Stoke the ice in my heart,

Darkness goes away,
Above the sky.
I feel the warmth in my heart.

The hardest behind.
One step to catch,
And i won't fall.

One step to forget
All that happens to me,
But i won't fall.
I know the place, where i'll be free.
This is the story end.
