We can't choose our fate,
Predict our lifes,
And try to make a choice,
That you'll never regret.

No heroes no ideals,
It does not matter for me.
I wasn't born as a hero.
Flame burned in me inside,
I believe in myself and nobody else.

Fire in my eyes
And in my heart.

Look around what do you see?
Empty eyes empty faces.
You decide yourself
And prepare for your destiny.
There is no wrong way.

Feel it for what you were born,
Your actions will pave the way,
The way to your grave.

All will be judged,
Your savior is dead,
You have no one to save.

Forget everything you know,
Too many rules to win,
You have own our game.

We went across the fire and death.
I know it will end.

Some heroes are real.
You knew that you won't survive.
Heroes must die.

I remember that day,
Nothing could to save you.
I'm late
And the hero has died.
Many years have passed,
I close my eyes.
Forgive me.
