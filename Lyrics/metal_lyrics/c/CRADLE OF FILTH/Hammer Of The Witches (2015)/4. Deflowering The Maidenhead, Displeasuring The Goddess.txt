Cracked Mirrors scatter reflection
Beauty falls from Her state of perfection
Good grace has fled this dream
While the cat's away the rats will ravage

Despotic, Necrotic fingers
Have lingered with Rape's Affection
Hoods face this global scene
As they stoop to prey nature grows more savage

She shudders at our foetal, fatal touch
Heavenly her body reft and left amongst the dead
Once grateful seeds in Her natal hutch
Our species breeds, deflowering the maidenhead

Religions caw epistles
Twisted laws extend their thistles
A crown to justify
Our place atop this hellbound carriage

This judgment has come from on high
Deforesters pray to the amplified sky
Stripped of her gowns, temples ripped down
Her curses hearse NOW
This judgment has come from on high
Look to her spears with true fear in your eyes

Summoning the coven, The Four Horsemen, Eschaton
She, the sumptuous Earth deep scars were forced upon
Queen Catastrophia seer renewal grew to see
Humanity in ruins sped to Death on rotten knees

We freed the flames that came to haunt Her
The greed that tore Her Elvish bodice

She was the storm that warmed to slaughter
Our selfish needs displeasuring the Goddess

Plastering disasters, faster pandemics appear
Anthropocentric pockets, last plagues are spreading near
Grand levelling with seven tongues acerbic, whore-astride
As the oceans swell in venom at our slick black ecocide

This judgment has come from on high
Poisoners choke on the smoke-ridden Sty
Forewarnings ignored, faith in a Lord
Life's blessings uncared for
This judgment has come from on high
Suffer this Kiss as She whispers goodbye

Goodbye

What have we done?
And what have we become
In this distance from our Mother
From the gates of late Eden?

Blinded, undone
Glowering into the sun
A world of mass congestion smothered
In the waste of late Eden

and what of Her?
Gaia, Cybele
where is jewelled Ishtar
That shone forth like the stars?

Now maniacal
Now maniacal She moves against us all
To destroy, recreate anew
To dance amok amidst annihilation

Extinction greets foul creatures left
Deflowering the Maidenhead
Displeasuring the Goddess
