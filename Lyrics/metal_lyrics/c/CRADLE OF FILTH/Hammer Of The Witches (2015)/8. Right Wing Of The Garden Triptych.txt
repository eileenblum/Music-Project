Death darkens all
Right wing of the garden triptych
Left marks The Fall
The middle ground apocalyptic

Why stay the grim inevitable and play out with a whimper?
Fate is raising coming to our faith!
NOW! The future cows!
Before the vows, prophets thunder from the heavens

We seek to justify, our seed spread far and wide
The eve that virtue died bore witness to this plague
Great hellscapes rape enflamed horizons here.....

This is the sore beginning to the war to end all wars
GÃTTERDÃMMERUNG, GÃTTERDÃMMERUNG, this hate brings fever
GÃTTERDÃMMERUNG, GÃTTERDÃMMERUNG, the great bereaver
Throw wide splintered lichgates to the eldritch show's return

Unforgiving proof accrual begs this cruel rebirth
A living fuel for the blaze of renewal razing the earth
Pariahs and messiahs of the highest worth, fodder for the denizens of risen
Hissing hell nothing screams out mercy more than vivisection of the soul

GÃTTERDÃMMERUNG, GÃTTERDÃMMERUNG, all base deceivers
Coddle abaddon, God, you got it wrong, now fall believers!
Liars and deniers, thick in mire's grasp, treacherous and lecherous
Retching a sick bloodbath

Peace sits alone midst the desecration sewn like a stony queen of winter, throned...
This is the penalty for lust- long dreaded, read in scripture, vain pleasures fed to paint this...

NOW! The future cows! Before the vows, prophets thunder from the heavens
We seek to justify, our seed spread far and wide
The eve that virtue died bore witness to this plague
Great hellscapes rape enflamed horizons here.....

GÃTTERDÃMMERUNG, GÃTTERDÃMMERUNG a twilight for bone idols
Sewer-suicidal from the heights, a dead man's stance of prayer
Deafened ears to mortal plight

Pleas and effigies, clergy bang to rites belief is superficial when the missals dance alight

All death darkens all
Right wing of the garden triptych
Left marks the fall
The universe is at worst, ecliptic
