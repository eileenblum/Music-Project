I wish upon a star
And think of all the things
I should have asked
Instead, I let the moment pass
And now I'm bleeding
On her faded photographs

Tears
So hard to swallow
Sorrow blears and leaves me hollow
Empty years, I should have followed
My inamorata to the grave

Uncertain words my heart denied
Now seem so trivial
I lost it all the night she died

Lies!
She is alive!
Beneath the ice
Only darkest mirrors crack this
Curse
And I, immersed
Invoke the worst
Blackest Magick put to practice

I remember then
When the Autumn moon
Would turn us back again
We'd laugh and bask
Amidst the underworld of men
Both citing Baudelaire
As our immoral saviour

Tears
So hard to swallow
Sorrow blears and leaves me hollow
Empty years, I should have followed
My inamorata to the grave

Words are so benumbing
In my head, I hear the drumming
Summoning, the dead are coming
From fetid crypts my lips create

Now grave powers start to rise
Deflowerers shall suffer
And witness to your sacrifice

Lies!
She is alive!
Beneath the ice
Only darkest mirrors crack this
Curse
And I, immersed
Invoke the worst
Blackest Magick put to practice

I think upon our time
Those golden summers
Of love echo so sublime
As do winters drinking
Too much festive wine
Now the seasons shift
Neath a creeping mist of horror

Malefic entities
I call upon thee
Vibrating cosmic threads
With shredded flesh
Manifest destinies
For those opposing me
Everyone is killable
Some just choose a vulgar death

Now we will see
What terrors shall be
The dark crimson sea
Drags the sun to oblivion

Faced demons
Arousing fire with tongues
Laced with vicious memories
Spatter twisted trees

Rape is returned a thousandfold
In the garden of unearthly delights

Only when their minds lie in ruin
Will I then hand them the knife

Towers fall like broken skies
Crashing through to Hell
Where amid the debris, angels writhe

Lies!
She is alive!
Beneath the ice
Only darkest mirrors crack this
Curse
And I, immersed
Invoke the worst
Blackest Magick put to practice

Death left me hopelessly blinded
Resigned to the wrongs of his design
I will never be alright
Never be alright
Never see the light
That shone in the heart of heaven
