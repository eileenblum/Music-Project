Aching floorboards spoke my name
In the belly of the beast to foreign shores
In tune with tides that whispered fame
And fortune for our humble Lord

Ecclesiastical banners
Unfurl in the manner
Of those who seek conquest and gain

Sail forth for Outremer
The Promised Land prised from the hands
Of blasphemers amassing there
Awakened from the desert sands capes

Onward Christian soldiers
Fated Nazareth and Bethlehem
Have fallen to an enemy bolder
It is said to widespread slaughter and rape

We are all sinners, enslaved to the cross
God wills The Great War to erase
The Judaic acres, the Mohammedans
In defence of our revenant faith

Political prowess takes to the stage
A pilgrimage led bu the sword
The sweet maiden blast of our clarion rage
Against the foul heretic hordes

The blazing invader Crusader parade
Vatican sanctioned and Mammon adored

Now, papal-led to die
The fatal battle cry
A natural army vies
For stretching Christendom

Wide, we slay the infidel
Remiss our way to Hell
Pay well the wishing well
With golden martyrdom

Scaling the towers with power ordained
Dark flowers of infamy bud

Ransacking, hacking off Saracen reign
The temple drinks claret in floods

Mercy forgotten in our ill-gotten gain
Of women and innocent blood

Death abides in this domain of ashes
The streets are stained
With the butchered foe
Now I hear the bells of triumph ringing
As they lay there rotting in their thousand shrouds
Beneath the clouds
That skitter and scatter
Dispersions on the truth of heaven

We are all sinners, enslaved to the cross
God wills The Great War to erase
The Judaic acres, the Mohammedans
In defence of our revenant faith

No crescent moon
No prophet of doom
Shall wail above Jerusalem
Vast hypocrites
All grasping for glitz
Have taken The Mount and The Tomb

Here in the kingdom of loss
