This night is chilled by ghosts
And the woods are full of werewolves
My heart is pounding with the stars
I feel the darkness rising

I'm blessed, addressed
By a voice of sweet caresses
Intoxication feeds
This freed reality
My inspiration speaks
Enshrined in crematoria

A sight of winged delight
Two great cherubim abreast her
Encase her grave, like once I prayed
Upon her sacred chest there

None more tragic for the lovelorn addict
Than the death of a beautiful girl

Although I was the author of sin
That compelled her wings to furl
She represents the pleasant scent
Of asphodel in this wretched world

Moonlight
Announce the presence of God again
The Ark of the Tragedian
Glitters like bright Hittite treasure

At best, obsessed
By her loss and my excesses
Judgementalism heaped
Upon the mercy seat
Means nothing to her sleep
Enshrined in crematoria

The trees are gaunt
But the cemetery beckons
Before her marble colonnades
I feel a stirring in the temple

As Israel waited with bated breath
At the foot of Mount Sinai
So I sated my wait for death
And miracles from on high
In wine and finite poetry
As fires bathed the sky

Moonlight
Announce the presence of God again
The Ark of the Tragedian
Church to her virgin measure

My tethered heart, a sacrificial lamb
Thrashes madly as the Lioness approaches

Moonlight
Announce the presence of God again
The Ark of the Tragedian
Is built on biblical pleasures

Poe-esque, grotesque
In my need for this catharsis
Her dark commandments teach
Through my prolific reach
A taste so bittersweet
Enshrined in crematoria

I find phantasmagoria
Enshrined in crematoria
