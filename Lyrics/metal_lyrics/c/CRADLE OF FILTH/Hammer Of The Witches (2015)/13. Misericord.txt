[Bonus Track]Nightmares on a roll
The spirit of fear
Has alighted here
Mercy on your soul...
This fright, crepuscular
Is muscular with vitriol

Misericord
I pass by as your shadow
The ghostly burning arrow
A marksman for your swerving heart

Misericord
I support your faith
When weary, in disgrace
You fall to doubt and pull all life apart

On this mist-enshrouded pathway
And through this hateful tarantella
In this thin labyrinth of razors
I shall grin, your soul's propeller

Misericord
Respite from the grief
These spiteful nightfall teeth
Grinding minds to tiny pieces

Misericord
Clockwork works the thief
Like an ever-ticking beast
Whose biting cogs self-denial greases

Drowned in alcohol
Sirens of the deep
Are demon forces
Mercy on your soul...
A life lived more monastic
Drastic measures must extol

On this mist-enshrouded pathway
And through this hateful tarantella
In this thin labyrinth of razors
I shall win, your soul's propeller

Bound to you like bloodline
Familiar with the cracks
The foul and fetid landscape
Just off the beaten tracks
Broods treacherous with sinkholes
The moon is doused in tar
And the fiend disaster preys upon
This straight and narrow path

Like an ever-ticking beast
Whose biting cogs self-denial greases

Misericord
I free you of the bond
To pain, now flee beyond
The veil of Death
Where peace holds reign

Misericord
I'm the killing stroke
The dagger in your throat
Under the armour
Calmer with its gain

Enemies take control
The swarming hordes
Have stormed the walls
Mercy on your soul...
Tonight I close your eyes
Before the temple falls

Before the temple falls
