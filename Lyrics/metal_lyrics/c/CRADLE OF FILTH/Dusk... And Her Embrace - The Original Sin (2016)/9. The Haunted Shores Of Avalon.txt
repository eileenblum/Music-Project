Herodias and I have led a phantom cavalcade
Through veiled romantic history where superstitions reigned
And Christendom sought to pervert, but poets of my name
Sang of penumbral victories that sorcery had claimed
The Graal and mighty Caliburn as votive offerings
To an England rearisen under vast prophetic wings

These are the shores where to my soul
Blood-drenched and unredeemed
Shalt seek solace in secrets told
And tranquil as a dream

From the woods Pendragon-born, I rose Arcturius
A proud and mighty king robed in the chivalry of lust
Death and fate undaunted me, I drew a throne divided
Glorious the battles won Black Adraste provided
Then treachery, a wingless beast, came crawling to my court
And now I lie at cursed Camlann, from wounds a traitor wrought

From wounds a traitor wrought....

I fear the Augean light is gutting Camelot
How bittersweet my triumphs seem
Now Autumnal dreams succumb to frost
Morganna art thou near me?
My strength wilts near a grave
Cast my sword to the sylphid grasp
Of the Naiad 'neath the silvered lake

When waters stirred lay silent
Mistress let the mists descend
Thy tears cannot thaw Death's cold heart
His sombre gaze defies legend
More so than thine lest thy dew-lidded eyes
Art for the Banshee's song.
Or our souls entwined like vein upon
The haunted shores of Avalon

The haunted shores of Avalon

I greet thee Dark Immortals
On this isle 'neath the moon
Why hast our kingdom fallen
To the enemy so soon
Let loose the hounds of darksome night
To pillage, plague and burn
As slumber lures me 'mongst the dead
To scheme of my return

Archaic ghostly echoes breathe like thunder of the storm
A tempest fools miscall divine as they crouch awaiting dawn
Their ignorance has forged for me over centuries a sword
Burnished to flash like lightning on the precipice of war
The wolves are dead in Albion whilst the passive flocks roam free
Thus my penetrant spearhead shalt pierce these foul trespassing breeds

These are the shores where to my soul
Blood drenched and unredeemed
Shalt seek solace in secrets told
And tranquil as a dream

"I have awoken from the past
Lenghening the shadows
Over England's bitter scars
I prize wide the wounds
Her soils whetted, drink
Remember me as king
When I cradle elder stars
Like lovers in my arms
Nestled vipers to my breast
Venomed forces work these cards
Of Devils and priestess....
Thus I shall rule anew
Through sinews of a song
Played upon a storm
By the ghosts of Avalon
And all in league will bow to me
From death they shall ascend
To whisper winds of war to stir
The dark-one-thing in men

The Principle '95
Black Metal masterplan...."
