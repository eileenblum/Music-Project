Rise crepuscular
Devildom voyeurs
Rise towards the light
Nascent aeons confer

The noose of revelation
Tightens 'pon misdeed
And the serpent of truth
Eats the nomad destiny

Vast shadows gather
In penumbral reign
Blind masses bring the jury of chaos
Poised to sodomize the human world back

Supernal curtains hang tattered
As others feast on the loss of command
Vengeance climbs Babel's ivory tower
Masturbated by a Cretan priestess

Victory spent
Breathe deep benighted scent

Seething fever demons gnaw in me
Like the tugging of my veins to feed
From sweet flowing waters of divinity
Millenniums turned black....

Attack!

Pour out our rages on those despised
Vulgar religion of the skies
Storm the citadels aloof upon the clouds
Erasing jealousies beneath eternal shrouds
Come lift thine eyes bedizened with delight

The fifth epoch is ours!

Artemis
Spread the lust of the dark Fantasia

Celebrate, renew the grave
The infidel soon unmasks her face

A crescent moon waxing forevermore
Sharpened to skewer dawn....

I am as a plague born unto darkness
The secret amour of an archangel's rape
A casualty when my mother, possessed
Cursed at the stake

Attack!

Pour out thy rages on those despised
Vulgar religion of the skies
Storm citadels aloof upon the clouds
We're erasing jealousies beneath eternal shrouds
Come lift thine eyes bedizened with delight

The fifth epoch is ours!

"The most asplendid sorcerers of Hades
Darkly seized for me a throne
And the upraised scythe so terribly scribed
vengeance in Jesuit blood on stone

From this ransacked celestial temple
I hold the prophet's severed head unto all nations"

Tremble before us
Lords of the star-veiled red sepulchres
Rushing deathwards, our Tartarean fires
Kindle pandemonia to furnace the earth

"Our voices are opened graves,
Through which the never-dead escape"

From deep abyssic dream
Pursuing ascendancy....

The noose of revelation
Tightens 'pon misdeed
And the serpent of truth
Eats the nomad destiny

Vast shadows gather
In penumbral reign
Blind masses bring the jury of chaos
Poised to sodomize the human world back

Supernal curtains hang tattered
As others feast on the loss of command
Vengeance climbs Babel's ivory tower
Masturbated by a Cretan priestess

The enemy has held three seasons
Imparadised, whilst we writhed
To psycho-dramas penned by aerial decree
Now freed to plunder....

Heaven torn asunder
