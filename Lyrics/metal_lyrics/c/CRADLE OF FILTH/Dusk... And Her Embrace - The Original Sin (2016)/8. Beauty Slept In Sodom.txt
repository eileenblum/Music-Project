Death, spirit me away
My anguished soul doth strain
On taut and twisted reins
Yet, insatiate I remain
A proud, unfallen star
That dares thee from afar
To calm my thund'rous heart
Yet rend it's knot apart

So I may never sing
Of red skies o'er my strings
And love, a wanton thing
Can plunge on burnt, black wings
To hang amid the thorns
Scarlet like velvet worn
About the cloud-wracked moon
Who wanes in solitude....

I am alone
Thirsting for the dark
That breathes beneath the stone
What black witchcraft
Shall cast me from thy dreams
And what perverse world-strategy
Will crawl with thee from sleep?

"Rouse my disease
And with cadent naked dance I shalt teach
Thee wisdom of darkness
From earth and red sea

Lightbearing Samael
Coalesce with me...."

Twilight
Through frosted gates
Entwining shadows of the snake
By candlelight
Thanateros rites
Death seduced and chaos wakes

Obsession grips, blindragon fever
In throes of scythed orgasm, Eros dies
And Saturn rapes faith's lovelorn Diva
Upon a cyprean altar
Stripped bare for sacrifice

Virtue births a demon
Pandora's box, unhinged, sets loose the night
Winged Lilith born for want of Eden
Fanning plumes of harlotry
Like pearls before the desert swine

In time, the oceans parts
Storm as a Kraken
Reborn Venus as thou art
Feeding at my banquet
Of Saturnalia.
I call thee having wrestled
The tides from lonely Diana

"For thee Endymion,
I forsake the cerements
Of this star-flung tomb"

Be-with-us, come
Unveil the ancient flame
Throw the cats our enemies
Desire's menstrual strain
Eastern Devil eyes
A cruel erotic plague
The Shekhina is in exile
And the Israelites.... enslaved

Midnight
Jerusalem
A tenebrous phantasy
Revelates to men
Their celestial walls crumble
When walks the Xul
Born to the scarlet whore in Babylon
