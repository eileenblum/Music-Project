Candelabra snuffed prey, silhouette wedded
Nightfall, take my hand
Seduce me with silky timbred limbs
Grant me thy dark command
Over the peaks framing tapestries
Of thick forest, dusk has filled
With Lucifugous kisses enwreathed in mist
Creeping surreptitiously to kill

Lucretia, I drain thy veins
Thy tears are sweeter than the mountain rain
Bewinged, infested belfries
Toll o'er the sobbing throng
A writhe of lethargic, terrored nudes
Dance to my tortuous song

I am He
The crowned and conquering darkness
Satan robed in ecumenical filth
Livid Bacchus sustained by bridal echelons of sylph

This wintry eve when the snow lies deep
And jagged ramparts wed the moonlit sky
I shrug off the shroud of preternatural sleep
Embroidered by these words Malaresia scribed....

"Beauty slept and angels wept
For her immortal soul
In this repose, these Devils chose
To claim her for their very own"

Carpathia ~ The dead shall speak of her
In graveyard tongue where pack wolves run
Blood red mist seeps across the sun

Never leave me....

This wintry night when awed stars report
Their absence from the heavenly brow
Crippled seraph shalt cower in illustrious courts
Whilst the cloaked maelstrom resounds

"How the storm it fulfills,
My heart though unhealed
Celestial knifes ebonied
And wild woods thrill
Yet far fiercer still,
Her lustre encompassing me"

Carpathia ~ Nature has long incurred
The trees to weave the cold fog like thread
Across the path the righteous tread

I rule as Master here
Where cruel winds impart my temper
Love sank wounded when I, betrayed
Saw Death etch cruelly, upon my lineage

"Arise panthered Draconis
And commit this world to thy ancient sovereignty"

Erubescent veil descend
Eclipse without an end
And legacies blessed with darkness
Forever more

Supreme vampiric evil

This wintry eve when the snow lies deep
And jagged ramparts wed the moonlit sky
I shrug off the shroud of preternatural sleep
Embroidered by these words Malaresia scribed....

"Beauty slept and angels wept
For her immortal soul
In this repose, these Devils chose
To claim her for their very own"

Carpathia ~ The dead still speak of her
In graveyard tongue where wolf packs run
Blood red mist sweeps across the sun

Candelabra snuffed prey, silhouette wedded
Nightfall, take my hand
Seduce me with silky timbred limbs
Grant me thy dark command
Over the peaks framing tapestries
Of thick forest, dusk has filled
With Lucifugous kisses enwreathed in mist
Creeping surreptitiously to kill
