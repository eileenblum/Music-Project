Weak midnight promises of love,
were wept upon her grave and shunned by stars above.
In mortal life lurks my dismay.
An Angel stole my heart and Death took her away.

She sleeps beyond the grace of God,
a dreaming beauty.
If wishes could only fray that bond,
the dead would sing for me.

Twelfth moon arose with ghostly voice,
a poet's serenade.
Her name a whisper upon my lips and lo,
Rorasa came!

Fear me not my grieving king,
funereal in breath.
The secrets of the dark I know,
and thus, we shall cheat Death.

My promises wrought though despondence that night,
have delivered me gifts from the grave.
Rorasa enshadowed and eternal life,
never a Devil so vain.

The Angel is fallen, for I thought her lost,
and no heaven would silence the pain.
Teach me these secrets, the sensual frost,
desire for warm blood again.

Dark nature clasp my soul,
around her throat mine arms enfold.
To sleep, perchance to dream,
and then to dusk and flesh ascend.

The sun descends, magenta spirits fill the skies,
and wreak erotic maladies where sex and Death abide.
From writhing tides where gothick siren weave their song to shore.
Through the ashes of the battlefields where ravens and angels war.

As phantoms we have fled the basilisk of day,
to rise as phoenix taloned, nightly taking prey.

We rule like the red and risen moon upon the sea.
The stars of judgement silent, for we share joyous eternity.

Damnation!
Salvation!
Stigmata plague!

The wine of Bacchus flows.
Listen to the thunder rage!

Deceivers dragged before their cross!
I am he that vanquished Death and bore the sting of loss.
What vulgar Christ will unprise my grasp?
His temple, ruined, burns and sweet Rorasa laughs.

[Guitar solo]

I am enamoured and imparadised,
to catch the fires dancing profanely in her eyes.
I will crush them all if this holds thy delight.
Rather dead forever than to lose her.
Nymph-lascivious Aphrodite!
