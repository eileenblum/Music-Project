When the moonlight sleeps upon the waveless lake
And the mists steal in with ease
The children of the night may sing
But I will call to thee

"I will call to thee...."

Encroaching evening skies die with such tragedy
And the dead in their graves dwell on pleasures to be
In deepes Styria where our legend still breathes
Thou has murmured my name as the wind through the trees

And I will come, as if in dream
My languid, dark and lustrous Malaresian Queen,
Of noble love fatale
An eager guillotine
Erishkigal, raven-haired
Thy seduction haunts the castle in erotic despair
I know thy scent by candlelight
Immortal flesh I yearn to share
Excite my greed on spattered sheets
Dyed unearthly red as sobriety weeps

Nocternity.... She shall come for me

A black velvet painting sprung to elegant life
Like a poignant Madonna perverted to night
And I have ridden from the westerning light
To expend my lust
Tear away the funereal dress
Know that I will escape from my death
Surrendered to the splendour of her sharpened caress

Lo! The pale moonlight
Weaves a poetic spell of vital death and decline
Of mist and moth and the hunger inside
Kisses took to fever and the fever, demise

"Through twilight, darkness and moonrise
My scarlet tears will run
As stolen blood and whispered love
Of fantasies undone"

Countess swathed in ebony
And snow-white balletic grace
Ruby lips procure the wish
For dusk and her embrace

Dusk and her embrace

We shall flit through the shadows,
Like a dream of (were)wolves in the snow
Consumed with ardour
A romance that ever unfolds

Beneath the stars death bedevils me
"Beneath the stars taste the death in me"
Evil is a fiery wish to sever thin mortality

The candlelight flickers
Under the deadly nightshade
Together insane
Screaming through nails of pain

Elizabeth
My heart is thine
Thy fragrant words
Warm within like wine....

"Sexual dusk allure
With asphodel eyes
Moon-glancing maleficia
Enflame the tides"

And I will come, as if in dream
My languid, dark and lustrous Malaresian Queen,
Of noble love fatale
An eager guillotine
Erishkigal, raven-haired
Thy seduction haunts the castle in erotic despair
I know thy scent by candlelight
Immortal flesh I yearn to share
Excite my greed on spattered sheets
Dyed unearthly red as sobriety weeps

Nocternity, She shall come for me....

Unfurl thy limbs breathless succubus
The full ebmossomed fog
Imparts the night to us....
