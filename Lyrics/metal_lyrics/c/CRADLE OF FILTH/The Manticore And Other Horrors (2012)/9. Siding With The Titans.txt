Where nature's russet beauty grew the roses of Utopia
The stench of vented corpses floats abroad
These killing fields will yield to new horizons so Cyclopean
With the advent of our resurrected Lords

Siding with the Titans

Cast into the ancient dark of Tartarus
Below the underworld
These ancient bastards bore their agonies
Or, locked in slumbrous nightmares
Twixt the spheres or 'neath the seas
The slept until the righting of the cosmos set them free

They slept until the blighting of the night sky
Let them loose on you and me

Welcome this return
Titanomachian and Vatican-hearsed
The mass enslavement of a passive Universe
In nary a day the earth was burning

Leviathans and Krakens
Colossal horrors rising forth
From oceans spewing Tsunamis
Like heralds of malevolence
Dispensing holocaust

The grandiose ballet
Of death and ravaged flesh
The span of Mankind shut down
In one massive shattered fucking breath

A slice of moon thrust a fatal glow
On their cold relentless freedom
From core to crust and conquered pole to pole
Reconfiguring for a fecund second Eden

I had glimpsed this Hell before
This twisted fungoid Boschian garden of insanity
An infested Nevermore
Rife with delights to annihilate humanity

Gods fell upon us insects with world-devouring maws

When nature's empty bounty died,
I dreamt this tragic sight
We precognitioners just tuned the signal to you all
Amplified, the vision fried, pulsing magnetic stars were right
Vast gates drew open
What slathered forth began the fall

Siding with the Titans

Our last mistakes to which awake
Past masters, mad and cruel
Shalt witness the explicitness of their rule
But I shall be rewarded
And take my place amidst the black
For what else is there left to do save usher these monsters back?

I welcome this return

I welcome this return
Mountains of perversion, Elder versions and worse
The mass enslavement of a passive Universe
In nary a day temples were turning

On judgment day
I'm siding with the Titans...
