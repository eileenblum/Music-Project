Here forms a knotted sorrow
The vivid grasp of fading faces
Storm clouds plot to follow...

I wander despondent, a curse on the grave
Her hair in my locket, a lock of nightshade
And there in my pocket, I nurse the charade
Her ring is awaiting her back
I watch her from shadows, pariah by day
I sleep in dark belfries and cellars away
From the ungiving living, their neurotic plague
Has turned her, as I to the black

"Faster beats the drum of dark arcanum"

Marie
I turned a deaf ear to heaven
When the evil eye accompanied me

You'll see
I am no further needed in the mirror
By my pallid reflection

I thrust so perversely, the worst is this crave
For sweet scarlet blood from a harlot parade
Of dutiful victims I beautifully take
With delicious malicious intent
A gift from a goddess who toyed with her game
The price of my night's infidelity paid
At the altar of her never faltering blade
Of infernal nocturnal descent

"Faster beats the heart of dark arcanum"

So I walk the moonlit quarters
Like a driven beast of prey
A catalyst for madness, slaughter
Given the leash to play

I'm detritus to my chosen
A ghost for all her days
Thus is Cocytus frozen
From those loved and left betrayed

Dream-dappled streams of sunshine
Dread fogs shall dissipate
As red skies descend on graveyard floors
Where the dead exhilarate

"My heart is gone
Taken by a nightmare bourgeois creature
Now you belong
To your sick womenagerie..."

N, n, no, no
I'm not the reason for this bleeding
N, n, no, no
My past is fast leaving me
Aghast in purgatory

"Faster beats the drum of dark arcanum"

Marie
I turned a deaf ear to heaven
When the evil eye accompanied me

You'll see
I am no longer greeted in the mirror
By my pallid reflection

So I stalk the moonlit quarters
Like a driven beast of prey
A catalyst for madness, slaughter
Given the season

I taste the true nature
Of this secret caste
This devil undone
Soars free at last...
