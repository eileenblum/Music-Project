Succumb to this slicker genesis
The serpentine wish of a decadent stranger
This fixed insistence
From a twisted out-of-mind

Succumb to this

He is scum to his kind
Slumming with the cast
Of his vast Imaginarium
Darkness come refined

Succumb to this wicked nemesis
The paralysis of hissing imminent danger
His kiss persistent, lips whisper his design

Numb with bliss, licked of menaces
This Philistine itch caught pissing in the manger
Is never distant from unresistant sides

Succumb to this

He will promise the earth
Laughing with the grasp
Of all past denominations
A master of rebirth

"Flee demon flee
I cast thee out with the power invested
Please leave me be
My heart is a biblical wreck"

Cease and just see
I rule this wide-eyed world unmolested
Increasing fantasies
With a wave of my hand
And high tides of turning freed

From the dizzying breeze of Quarantania

Beauty swoons in caresses of nature
Pleasures of the rooted flesh await her
The taste of heaven for endeavouring Man
To a greater measure of temptation's folly

Lo! The splendour of the throne
The feasting spread of best harvests
Picked clean off the bone
The shining kingdoms
Blent against red sunset skies
And everywhere the scent of better wonders
Set desires to fiery rise

"Tonight
All the stars burning bright are but a canopy for me
A Cinderella story, stellar jealousies are rife
For my Prince holds a divine right
Enlightened with the glorious"

Blind faith falls for the First Seduction
Induction into halls of shame

With classic joys and fresh allures
Life leads fantastic overtures
"Indulge, only the coy abjure"
This orgiastic ride

Sigh!
His smile's just a laceration
With a fascination for the massing dark side

And he means war...

Succumb to this wicked nemesis
The paralysis of hissing imminent danger
His kiss persistent, lips whisper his design

Numb with bliss, licked of menaces
This Philistine itch caught pissing in the manger
Is never distant from his soul-corrupted prize

He will show miracles
Building on the fast
Iconoclastic innovations
Growing empirical

Succumb to this
