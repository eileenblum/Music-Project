[Deluxe Digipak Edition Bonus Track]As far as we can discern, the sole purpose of existence is to kindle a light in the darkness of being
[--Carl Jung]

Sometimes red curtains fall
Before the act has headed for the wings
As on that night disaster crawled out from the stalls...

Suddenly the dark, the thickest Stygian dark
Pressing on all sides with vertigo
Running from the quickest in the sickest abyss
My spiritâs lifted by an angel of woe

A dredged up dreadful past
Drags discordant thoughts my way
Unforgiven and driven to despair
I sense the mordant wraith Azazel
Standing there

Now the vision simmers
I spy a distant gleam
Racing ever closer
Through this persistent dream

And by its welcome glimmer
Writhing into sight
The brutish groping nightmares
That hide beside the light

Then a roar
And a voice like a pride of lions
Thunders from the maw
In a blackened mass
The creatures flee
Screaming bloody murder as
A shining gateway opens for me

Death, the great adventure

At the peril of my soul
I welcome death, the great avenger

Spared this awful realm
Where those who stalk the living haunt the murk
Untethered pleasures keep them tied to flawed
Human

I'm floating upwards still, to where the tunnel mouth reveals
Two manticores that ward an ebon door
I must lean resolve as the luminance dissolves
And I am thrust headlong into the venomous jaws
I am in darkness again
But here accursedness is vastly deeper

Unforgiven and given to torment
I am nothing
Grotesque, grotesque, bereft of judgement

This abyss, a void
Where stripped of all but self
One must wish to be destroyed

To pass on somewhere else

Beyond this pit of wicked shouts
Of madness and fallacies
Aeons I failed to rail my doubts
Before fear left love saving me

Then a roar
And a voice like a clash of titans
Thunders from the maw
In a seething mass
The horrors flee
Screaming bloody murder as
A shrouded sky opens immensely

Listen!
What Eden shall arise
Abundant from the cliffs that stunt hellâs
Redundant cries?

A view of breathtaking beauty
Unveils, as the sun dispenses perversities

Death, death, the great adventure

For the glory of my soul
I welcome death, the great avenger

The damaged man revives
With dawning truth, this morning suits
The world I left abruptly
In exaltation, I find myself alive
Nearâdeath to steer a long life led corruptly

The sweet silver chord that keeps me moored
I know that heaven sent her

From the cold to hold her face again
I rose from death, the great adventure
