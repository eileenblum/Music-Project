Â 
Bursting with madness the moon shall derange
The ether caresses my veins
Cursing the feverous reign
I taste the change
Â 
Lips curl, my grip starts to harden
Maelstorms are loosing in the garden
Â 
Angels will whisper bane
Hidden meanings in the teaching of pain
time warps with their kiss bestowed again
Â 
Go go go tidal vertigo
Back is an arrogant front
Truth is a lie, suicidal eyes
Plummet From the summit of this pissed up...
Â 
Nightmare
Â 
Hellucinations, bare mountain night
Walpurgis is thirsting for souls
My coven is stolen
For blood still muds the knolls
Â 
Visions soar phantasmagorical
Collidescopic, whetting the oracle
Â 
Fast awake to make this dreamland obey
Forsaking others for the chasing prey
I take another draught, fates spirit me away
Â 
Go go go wicked vertigo
Intoxication is a fur
Worn about stitched arctic shoulders
It sets this melancholy beast to purr
Â 
Lost in bliss, the mooring slips
Â 
Hyde is high and mighty
In veneration of his role
Â 
Dreams amass
Nightmares are rising
Unsympathising
Dreams a massace
Â 
I have left bereft the flesh
Sanctuary for the grail of woe
Â 
Now suddenly I see
Like innocent breath through a perfumed harem
A gash of lightning tearing ashen skies
Betray the scene
A deathless army, the greatest ever been
Lurks frighteningly silent
Hanging on the fatal call for carnage
Â 
Come the awful sundering
The devilment is thundering
Â 
fellow travellers tread careful
Hell awaits diethyl dreams
These lush pretence dimensions wean
Â 
Come the awful sundering
The devilment is thundering
Â 
Seeking ways back to our world
Eldritch curators scheme
Horrord rush upon us as we flee
Â 
I plunge on a comet, vomit the sea
Lunge upright to flames advancing on me
Dancing like mardi gras dark company
Â 
Dreams amass
Nightmares are rising
Unsympathising
Dreams a massace
Â 
I am riding high tonight
In celebration of my role
Â 
Dreams amass
Nightmares are rising
Unsympathising
Dreams a massace
Â 
I will leave relieved my flesh
Sanctuary for the grail of woe
