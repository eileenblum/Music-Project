Bloated with disease
A psychophantic grease that clings
Like a shroud thrown over me
A coat of golden fleas
And by their gleam
The shadows grow to be

This soul is sick
This soul is sick with wicked exploration
My vulgar habits stitched the rabbit hole
A welcome mat for infestation

Fettered from the get go

Listen to them laugh
For the roads to glory goad you
Thistles on the path
Always cast by the ones who know you
From the dark

We are less than worms and vermin

Black clouds low and roll
Shipwrecked in my psyche
By siren fantasies
Serpents
Curl about my goals
Hissing through the mirror
As they slither over me
Now...

I pray you see the light
Before huge onyx wings behind despair arise
They splay night skies with desolation

And the Devil never lets go

Fate caught me
In flagrante delicto
Shame taught me
Hells self-obsessive fresco
Ruled by horrors

Grue, no butterfly become
Cocooned in utter guilt
The gutters silt has overrun
My rue transcendence
Sheol builds Golem
And this offence to nature
Is hunting independence

The more I wallow in grief
The more fatalist I fall
To this engorging beast
The greatest traitor of them all

Bloated with disease
A psychophantic grease that clings
Like a shroud thrown over me
A coat of golden fleas
And by their gleam
The shadows grow to be

This soul is sick
This soul is sick with wicked exploration
My vulgar habits stitched the rabbit hole
A welcome mat for infestation

Listen to me now
For the road to glory goads you
Thistles on the path
Always cast by the ones who know you
From within the mirror
