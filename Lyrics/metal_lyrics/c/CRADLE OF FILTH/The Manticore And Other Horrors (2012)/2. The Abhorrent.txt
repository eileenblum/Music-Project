I sing desolation
On the breath of centuries
Bringing annihilation
Slaughter courses through my enemies

I was not always so cold
Once upon a crime in times of favour
I had lived a God amongst the bold
Like a true poetic saviour

But my people were dissolved
By the flames of righteous strangers
My name blackened ten thousandfold
Death grew to know me...

As the abhorrent

Stricken from the light
As dividing curses poured
I was hiding in the thickening mire
Biding for my war

I'm climbing up the years to get you
From a dark abyssic scheme
Lovecraftian, part-Martian
To the beast I used to be

My laureates of gold are sold
Horns spear the reddened sea
And by my transformed hand
Be sure
The Heavens hear your final pleas

Tonight this world is burning
To a fulsome serenade
Arch nemesis, I'm the genesis
Of a raging plague about to break

Blue eyes rolled headlong to black
When the darkness drew me to her caresses

I was not always so cold
Once upon a crime in times of old

I had lived a God amongst the folds
Of creeping epic failure

But my people were dissolved
By the flames of righteous strangers
My name blackened and deeds annulled
They grew to know me...

As the abhorrent

I'm a cemetery and a garden
Ripe with near-putrefied life
A phallus beginning to harden
On the philosophy of a prurient knife

I hear the dead begin to cry,
"Hostis Humanis Generis."
My favorite leaden lullaby

On sacred eves I've asked for sacrifice
Mere moments of atonement
For your despise
A stern believer
That the great deceiver
Is your precious God
Whose preachers saw me demonised

Now, the sun it sets
On your nascent best of days

Time to rise
Gorgon, Calibos and Cain
Titans unrepentant
Lord Lucifer insane

"If I am the Devil
I shall honour my spiteful name."

Tonight this world is burning
To a fulsome serenade
Arch nemesis, the rest of this
Destructive wickedness is on its way

I'm climbing up the years to get you
From a dark abyssic scheme
Lovecraftian, part-Martian
To the beast I used to be

My laureates of gold are sold
Horns spear the reddened sea
And by my transformed hand
Be sure the heavens hear your final screams
