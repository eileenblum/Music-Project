On the night all mirrors fell silent
And the clocks struck accord with the rain
A storm swept in with such violence
The dead rose to complain
The stars were ill-crossed as the weather
Lost in its bitumen cloak
The Angels were warring, slick with endeavour
Falling like tears through the thickening smoke

Blood redeems, heaven torn asunder
A flood of souls scream on the rolling thunder

Blood redeems, heaven torn asunder

She stirs from dreams barely three feet under

"Victoria, I come to claim my prize
Stealing from the convent neath the wrath of seething skies
For though you greased the palm of Satan
With those moonlit silver thighs
I knew the beast took second place
When I looked into your eyes

Your deceiving eyes
Filled with lies
And missed good byes
And serpents hissing revelations

Your deceiving eyes
They tell enough
Of how I fell in love
With the goddess creeping deep inside you"

And with the tumult up above him roaring
Isaac sought her shallow grave
As lightning bolted through the grim down-pouring rain
He struck the hallowed earth again

Having torn at the soil like a man insane
ÐÐµ threw his fists at the poisonous cosmos
And from that pit of shame
He bore the coffin from her sorry lot
Neath trees whose eaves were knotted with rot
Through ornate chapel doors, unlocked
To splinter her sarcophagus
And gaze upon her face

Victoria...

"Victoria, I come to claim my prize
Stealing from the convent neath the wrath of seething skies
For though you greased the palm of Satan
With those moonlit silver thighs
Making mockery of rosaries
His needs will never rival mine

I recall a summer's day
The sunlight bathed your penitential scars
As I sat and washed the blood away

Now your body stays
And the coldness of your lips
Eclipse
Like the first true kiss of winter"

Pining for the dead
On the stone floor spread
She was shining through her winding shroud
A moon amid the mad, this son of Adam had
A gift for the pretty young nun
A necklace wrought of twining snakes
Two gold illicit tongues
He laid it at her throat
Where the rope had wrung
He was burning from the furnace
Of his roused desire

He wrested with temptation
To be or unfulfilled
She was undressed for ovation
Her sumptuous form, the storm revealed

And with his driven lust exploding
Her lashes brushed his cheeks
They flickered with life, her limbs enfolding
Purring, licking wicked teeth

"Victoria, I come to claim my prize
Stealing from the convent neath the wrath of seething skies
For though you greased the palm of Satan
With those moonlit silver thighs
You have left him just for me
I see it in deceiving eyes

Those deceiving eyes
Filled with lies
And missed good byes
And serpents hissing revelations

Those deceiving eyes
They tell enough
Of how I fell in love
With the goddess re-arisen in you"
