A storm to break steeples is nigh
I feel it in my deviant pathology
The autumn leaves no longer sigh
But instead hiss a virulent cacophony

Stricken in the dead of night
Fear quickens me to flee or fight
This otherworldly parasite
Who stalks my very dreams

Sickened by this atmosphere
Blood's slickening everything in here
Nightmares are liars to commandeer
And furnish with my screams

She seeks control
So disaster will follow me
Please free my soul
Before her darkness can swallow me

I tasted betrayal
I was a fool
I will never relent
I am agony sent
Vengeance in the still hungry sights of a ghoul
The snow and roses
Of youth have passed away
Yet still she haunts me
In truth I stay her prey

Further down the habit hole
I fall feigning greater escapology
But drugs do nothing but extol
The here and now
And not her venomous ghostology

I was hers but chose
Another for my own
And everybody knows
Suicide is for the solo...

My loved ones swoon to her embrace
For them a tomb will soon encase
Their spilled remains the cursed chase
Begins for me afresh

Adverse Venus of these rites
Hearse of perverse appetites
Her thirst it worsens and invites
A creeping of the flesh
She seeks control
So disaster will follow me
Please free my soul
Before her darkness can swallow me

I tasted betrayal
I was a fool
I will never relent
I am agony sent
Vengeance in the still hungry sights of a ghoul

I tasted betrayal
Misplaced and cruel
I will never relent
I am agony sent
Vengeance in the still hungry sights of a ghoul

In the still hungry sights of a ghoul

First a gelid whisper
Then the candlelight cavorts in sympathy
For where once it was murder to resist her
Paralysis of terror stills the urge to flee

The demon enters
Swathed in a fell bestiality
She this vengeful wraith tormentor
I pray the time has come for hell to set me free
