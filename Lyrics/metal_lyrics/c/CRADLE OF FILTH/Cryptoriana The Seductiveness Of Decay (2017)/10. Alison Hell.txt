[originally by Annihilator]Alice, isn't it frightening?
Alice, aren't you scared?
Alice, isn't it wonderful?
Living life afraid
Don't look around the corner
I might be lurking there
Under the bed at night
You're up 'til dawn again

Alison hell, your mind begins to fold
Alison hell, aren't you growing cold?
Alison hell, you are looking blue
Alice in hell, what else can you do?

Alice

I begin my rule, life hideous in your mind
Crying out, you've lost your doll
It isn't worth a dime

Alison hell, your mind begins to fold
Alison hell, aren't you growing cold?
Alison hell, what are you looking for?
Alice in hell, soon I close the door

Sitting in the corner, you are naked and alone
No one listened to your fears, you've created me

Alice, isn't it frightening?
Alice, aren't you scared?
I was killed at birth
I shoot this final scene
You're in the basement
You're trapped insanity

Alison hell, what were you looking for?
Alison hell, as I close the door
Alison hell, here you shall dwell
Alison hell, Alice dwells in hell

Alice

Alice
Alison
Alice
In hell

Goodbye
