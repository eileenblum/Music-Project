Before the war, this grave darksome pall
Pressed upon the face of England
We were sovereign to nothing less
Than the map of our souls solicitous to reign
Together in a peace these wicked times disdain

Then Empire saw much more to gain

The Crown discounts our loss
Life cannot count the cost
These numbers fount like water
The dead and dying, those on route to slaughter

Valentine sweet spine entwined
I am sorry that I left you here, in time
I will find the path back from the other side
So keep a candle burning
In your heart that is my shrine

No Memento Mori
For he passed away
For faraway glory
So tear the pages
From this castaway story

Spilling tears
Fill her lachrymatory

She seeks to pierce the veil
Melancholia
Speaks the fiercest tale
Weeks are growing lonelier
Even stonier regaled

Love's bond responding
Beyond the pale

The planchette is promissory
Purveyance of the seance
In obeisance to the spirits
Before their dismissory

The Crown discounts our loss
Life cannot count the cost
These numbers fount like water
The dead and dying, those on route to slaughter

Valentine sweet spine entwined
I am sorry that I left you here, in time
I will find the path back from the other side
So please accept my kisses
Through the whispers of the Ouija board

I suffer alone
So far from home
Watching you from a distance
A shadow's persistence to roam

No time to atone
You flower alone
Beautifully graven
You cut a black raven
Whose tower has flown

No Memento Mori
For he passed away
For faraway glory
So tear the pages
From this castaway story

Spilling tears
Fill her lachrymatory

She seeks to pierce the veil
Melancholia speaks the fiercest tale
Weeks are growing lonelier
Even stonier regaled

Love's bond responding
Beyond the pale

The planchette is promissory
Purveyance of the seance
In obeisance to the spirits
Ghosts that haunt amiss, amie

Winter seems far colder
Without you by my shoulder now this year

Faith's blinding glare advanced to frost
Finds her there, entranced to cross
To breach death's porous border
And reach where breath affords no quarter

Helpless, I see her resolve harden

This is where it ends
How the wretchedness portends
The knife in her hand
On the stretch to the promised land

And this is how they found my light
Clutching tight that fateful telegram
