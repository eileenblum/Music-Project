Thee I invoke, a bornless one
All woman, pure predator
Wherein conspiracies and impulse dwell
Like a seething fall from grace

Thee I worship...

Thou art darkest Gabrielle
Lilith rode the steed
Thou art pale Hecate
Rising from Thessaly

Crush their unworthy idols
No church shall bar our path
Seductive Evil, drink your fill
Of the bleeding Christ in your arms

Thou art in my dreams
The darkness in my eyes
The rapture in their screams
Black goddess

We bide our hideous soldiers
Inviting esctacy
But though they send the thunder
Bringing their dekind

Thou art in my dreams
The darkness in my eyes
The rapture in their screams
Black goddess

Nothing will keep us apart
We could kill them all
If desire tore free
Our union is one sweet sinful Eve

And the night draws in beside her
As we embrace the dark with designs
And I pour my soul to those eyes of fire
As I bury my seed deep inside

"Archangel, snare the flesh
Suck dry the ebbing wound
Leave them lifeless and broken
My beloved..."

Oh, how I have craved for you
You so pure and other-worldly with your scent of winter
Am I to bleed myself dry just to see your delight?

And the fear retreats forever
When my secrets are wedded with thine
Under seven stars we came together
To plot the new age's decline

Ishtar my Queen
Come forth to me
And help me seize
My future from the House of Death

That in the release of immortality
I should slay their fucking Nazarene

Ah... the lies... the kiss... I kill for you

Thou art in my dreams
The darkness in my eyes
The rapture in their screams
Black Goddess

Hidden lusts will break the gates and swarm
As love secretes the thrill for war
The virgin raped shall seek to whore
She-wolf bare your snarling jaw

Thee I invoke, a bornless one
All woman, pure predator
Wherein conspiracies and impulse dwell
Like a seething fall from grace

Thou art darkest Gabrielle
Lilith rode the steed
Thou art dark Hecate
Rising from Thessaly
