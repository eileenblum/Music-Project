[Special Edition bonus disc track]

"So I shall conjure thee,
demons of the Netherworld
For your names and seals are known

Evil,
Slimy essence of corruption
Lord of Vice and Pestilence
Deity of Silent
Hear my words"

Where will you be they tense for warfare?
What will you see with your innocence there?
Where will you be they tense for warfare?
What will you see with your innocence there?

Where will you be when God is glorifying?
There we will be between the dead and dying
Where will you be when God is glorifying?
There we will be between the dead and dying

"Hear my words
Horaeus of Lion shape, tailed with a serpent
Commander of the forces of Time and Space
Demon of Astrology
You shall arise

Beelzebub,
Hideous of Aspect
_____ and Barron.
Messengers of mean importance
Heed the power of my dark commands"

Devoted to the votive, holy standard above
'By command of the king of Heaven'
Came the death of Love

Where will you be when they're vilifying?
How will they see when the truth is blinding?
Where will you be my darling?
Where will you be when they're vilifying?
Where will you be when the dark is rising?
How will you keep from it's terrorizing?
Where will you be when the dark is rising?
How will you keep from it's terrorizing?
Burning was the sunset like a portent of doom
On the saintly iron maiden as she fell from her wound

But visions and ambition
Never listened to submission
And she was on a mission from the highest above

The death
The death of Love

The righteous death of love

"For my ardour and my sensual delectation
I took a great number of precious little souls
Whom I killed and caused to be killed
Well, it is to desire to be quit of this world 
In which there is nothing but misery"
