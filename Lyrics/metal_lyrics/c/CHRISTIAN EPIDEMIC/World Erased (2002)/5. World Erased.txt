Above everything, within my
knowledge but against my will
A new God controls me, he who
Sees my blood soul, cold and still

Above everything, an infallible,
True feeling awaits
A world full of hate, a world
That God has put to it's fate

Above everything, my tired
Soul's being picked at by birds
At least i won't have to hear the
Last true human being's lying words

I'm not driven by passion
Not even passion of life or of love
I'm not driven by my anger
With the purpose of my evil words

I see my pretty wife
In a broken mirror
She's washing her dress
From bloodstained to snow white

A naked child within the ruins
Standing here in the fresh, white snow
His tearful eyes just can't conceive
That they have left him all alone

His trembling lips speak unfamiliar words
Questions accuses no one hears his say
He sees no one's left to guide his way
I'm so ashamed my living body rots away
