May your body and soul be silent
Let God's hand slowly lift you out
His touch will be terribly painful
The secret of darkness will leave you in doubt

I'm the lovechild of dawn and its dew
And I proclaim silentium
Three hundred thousand gates of widom
Have opened themselves to me

The flesh of my body has become
Burning fire Metatron
When the keeper of the world of souls has spoken
No ash or bone is left unbroken

You hear the sound of unheard prayers
And sin starts to dominate your heart
You must burn up the earthly realm you have left
And open the gate to a new existence

You will forget how to laugh forever
And you will learn to hate your tears
You feel your unredeemed heart filling
With the ice-cold blood of all your fears

Everyone of you will undergo
The skinning of a human being
You'll chew your tongues through the unbearable pain
And drink one anothers saliva

They'll rip ypur peregnant mother's womb apart
With your broken bones and bloody heart
Then take the innocent body of your onlu child
And get every madmen and animal ready to fertilize
