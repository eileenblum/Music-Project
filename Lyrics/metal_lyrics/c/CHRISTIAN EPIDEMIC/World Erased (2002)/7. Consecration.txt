I don't just see but
Understand this living earth
Not only people
Even the omnipotence

No body, no soul
No disrupted alliance
My body's just meat on bones
That fulfills my suicidal dreams

And when the moment has come, for my life to be
thrown away by my own to hands
My sin will spit in the eye of God
And my bitter heart wins eternal peace

I see the eyes of my executioner
I sanctify my sinful body
the filth of sins are a false reverence
Finds a new path and washes my hands

This posessed world makes an outcast of me
there is no hope without ethics
On an earth where the church protects its belief
From every throught with the blood of man

I put my hand upon my heart
As a memory overpowers me
How many vibrations of my life
Have stoped others in there stuggle to be

Awaiting the moment of peace
For I know I only can be happy
When the inhumanities of life
Are changed to the silence of cemetaries
