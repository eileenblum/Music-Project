She gave me a new body and soul
Touched my shoulder with her soft wings
Stared into my eyes with her own two eyes
and through i saw a world no one comprehends

I see and hear
She's humming a lullaby
A teardrop's running down her cheek
She must be thinking of the war

On the day of my death when I look back
A deep doubt passes through my soul
And my quivering voice speaks with her words
Will there be someone to bury me whole

The wind it wirld the ashes of
The remains of a stake

It takes the blood of all young aznd old
Paints a prayer on the wall

I saw a mountain of skulls in her eyes
A bloody Gholgota in her mind
And I saw the temple of peace burning
Cheated among it's suffering
