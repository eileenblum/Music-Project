I'm slowly being blinded
By the unfastened hand of this planet
The anger of God is the anger of man
And the well of suffering is also man

My dream keeps hounting again and again
I see my childs eyes are full of this pain

A freezing cold breath swirling around his head
Seduces him to follow the dead

Every time I open my eyes, they bury some other
Another child and another mother

So many people cry and run away
But I will not, because because the problem will still stay
Life cannot hurt me anymore
I've seen every dark shadow in this world

Choirs shall always praise the music of the past
Just as the ice-cold wind plays a frosty tune
The bed of our love is an empty grave now
I'm left with empty memories to wound
