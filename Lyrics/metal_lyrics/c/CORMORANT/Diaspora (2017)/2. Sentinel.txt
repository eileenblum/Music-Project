Epoch perennial
Unending burial
Sentry of the land
A lord with no command
On hallowed ground

A chieftain once revered for his knowledge of the land
Provider turned to prey with a twitch of natureâs hand

A peril unforeseen by the writing in the stars
Similaun as a tomb opens ceremonial scars

The day was rife with possibility
The smell of carrion on the wind
A figure breached the soft tranquility
A copper arrow breached the skin

Death-addled yet demands to fight
the rogue Tyrolean from the North
A smooth release, the killing blow
The world of watchers beckons him home

Time becomes a childâs game
Millennia to stake his claim
And still he has command of sight
Keeper of the rocks and rain

Aeons pass before his eyes
As generations turn to mist
A seer rooted to the clay
Prophesied to preexist
Blighted by command of sight
A nameless witness of the earth
The wisdom of a thousand lives
Relegated to the dirt

âGods above! Forgive me!
Let them find their own way
and release me to my dreams.â

Aphonic the refrain
And here he will remain
Doyen of the wind and snow and rain

If forever could be drawn
The eternal pantheon
A palette made of rock and blood and bone

A sentence served in ice
A silent sacrifice
Omniscience lost with every new sunrise

Enshrined in landâs expense
A consecrated trance
Devoid of recompense
