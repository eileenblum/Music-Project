Instinctive pull
Call for expansion
Impulse to seek prosperity
Flee consternation

East over shoulder
The lantern telling lies
Expiring slowly
Kerosene dries
Fear washes over

Mud-caked teeth grind
A smirking, wind-burned face cracks frown lines
Chased by the fury of the dust cloud
Spurs dive, hooves fly

âLex Sempronia Agraria.
We migrate to find it.â

Expansion manifesting
Claiming their destiny
Forge a shining city on the hill
Taming the American west

Thundering cacophony
Bleeding trails off the map
Worn heels of Burden Iron beat roads through granite

With clay under the nail
Outstretched fingers point the way
When the earth drinks the sky
Age of fortune is nigh

Blighted by sun and choking dust
Rope splinters line wearied hands
The miles separate wood from lashing
As blisters are rubbed to scars

The more the wind blows, the harder they push
Crack the whip âtil the blue meets the blue
Strong spines of equine will paint the way
As the call of virtue is answered with a roar

The famished caravan
An opportunist meal
Lost half my family attempting to preserve their future

Over the next crest
Weâll smell salt in the air
Succulent wasteland becomes deciduous

Green and gold
The fertile soil and sunshine
With God as my witness I claim this as mine

Green and gold
The untouched valley beckons
By the backs of forefathers I claim this as mine

Migrant fighting for his life
Revels in the failing light
Migrant fighting for his life
The wild herd is losing sight
Migrant fighting for his life
Wallows in implicit strife
(Rhetorical tone)
Migrant fighting for his life
Seductive unknown

The mission embellished
Charged âfrom aboveâ
The promise of virtue
Contrived imperialist lie

The frontier arrogated
Acquisition the final design
The valor confabulated
Irreproachable pioneers

âLex Sempronia Agraria.
We migrate to find it.â

Bloodshot eyes stare
A thousand miles past sunset
Horns locked with nature, dueling
A conquest of reciprocation

Expansion manifesting
Claiming their destiny
Migration
