Mists once dressed these dunes
Like silk upon her skin,
But the ocean's bare today
And the tide is coming in.
I watch a castle on the beach,
A tower crumbling away,
Mother Nature always wins
The games we children play.

Rocks peek out from the foam;
There seven seagulls stand.
I slip the sandals off my feet
And drop them on the sand.
As I walk dust clings and falls
To my dry and weary soles;
The prints I leave upon the ground
Like words upon a scroll.

Walk into the waves
As the footprints fade away
(Fade away)
Oceans leave no graves
All our legacies decay
(Decay)

The water's cold at dusk,
I thought as I stepped into the tide.
The sea does not want me here.
What could she have to hide?
Our forebears looked to the horizon
And claimed demons lived beyond,
But I called into the distance
And no deities would respond.

Walk into the waves
As the footprints fade away
(Fade away)
Oceans leave no graves
All our legacies decay
(Decay)

Perhaps if I tread further,
Past where my feet engraved
My last mark upon the world,
I'd find a face within the waves.
