Last night, I watched the moon drink the tides
'Til a whale rose from the hole in the sea.
She breathed in the clouds like an opium ride,
Smiled, and devoured me.

My flesh had melted when my mind awoke
To feel her tail tear open the sky.
Fins punctured cities, bled sulfur and smoke;
I wept as the last scream died.

She spat my soul onto a planet of dust.
My thoughts dissolved into the grain.
Whale became woman, the sun gazed with lust;
He took her, and fathered the rain.

From this coupling my shell grew green.
Rainforests sprung from my skin and soil.
Mountains spawned cells, apes &amp; All-In-Between,
And I understood.
I am this mortal coil.
I am this mortal coil.
