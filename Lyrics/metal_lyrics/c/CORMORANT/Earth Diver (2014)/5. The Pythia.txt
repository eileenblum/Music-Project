Under starless night on the slopes of Mount Parnassus
He reveals is fateful story to the priests
When his only son became one with the Aegean
He embarked to find the Pythia of the East

The clerics wring their brittle hands
Three voices meld and speak as one
"Give us the gifts you've brought for Pythia
And all your years of grief shall be undone."

With laurel leaves wrapped around his body, He proceeds on Sacred Way
The Oracle his last remaining chance

Head down, she breaths the ground
Rising mist turns her words to prophecy
Revered in frenzied state
Parnassus-born

Procession ends at eagle's height
Adytum bathed in crimson light
He falls before her sacred feet
Calls for his son to live anew

Her wailing echoes through the sky
Her proclamations shake the earth
Vapors command her to sing
Above the Castalian Spring

Far away, the sound of mourning wakes him from his dream
Her tawdry spell a revelation of her fallacy

He ascend her throne with resolution
And impious absolution
His desperate wish forever lost to time

Head down, she breaths the ground
Rising mist turns her words to prophecy
Revered in frenzied state
Parnassus-born
