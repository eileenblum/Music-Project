In a trance, under fever
He is taken past the stars to the realm of souls
A reunion of his ancestral lineage
A promise of earthly rebirth

"Dance for us and we will return!
Forego the olden forms, know the Circle!"
Astral vision brought to life
He returns to teach the tribe

A ritual Ghost Dance to summon those lost by war and famine
A reverent display to restore all that's been removed
Forming in circles and covered in war paint, invigorated
With the beating of drums to guide their every move

Dance to bring the harvest
Dance to stop the end

As the days and nights elapse,
They all recite ancient prayers under the waning moon
They call to elder souls to spare their doom
He watches proudly as they step as one
Yet as the winter approaches, he ponders when they'll come

Fields unchanged, the tribespeople whisper
Deprived of his power to speak with death
Still the Ghost Dance remains
Chants rising to the wind

In a dream, out of darkness
He is taken past the stars to a realm unknown
Revelation of merciless deception
Souls of the dead: shadow and myth

"Dance for us and we will return!"
Betrayed by the witch owl
Broken Circle
