Under cover of dark they conspired
Release from oppression inspired
The shackles that bound unraveled
Ever daunting, way out untraveled

The trap was in place, bait swallowed
The doctor fell prey, death followed
The fluid inside the skull plate
Pressure driven psychopathy

Hands round the throat
Scalpel to the skin
Blood falls to the cement
Evidence compounds
Conflagration clears the ground
Life was strained from all in the way
"Life is earned for those who escape!"

"Provisions will be improvised.
The forest is where we must hide.
The caves, to regroup and regrow."
Demented civilization will rise

They hunted, they plowed
They took all that nature allowed
This land, overthrown
No choice but improvisation

Wandering fools killed and claimed
Straying damsels captured and tamed
Some say the witches of Milford to blame
Nooses still swing in the forest by the flames

Decades scrape by
Generations born into sin
Mutated they stalk

Those who dare to walk in the forest
Be wary, there is trouble abound
A new breed of humanity
Surviving by hunting you down
