Touch me now from your frozen
Jail down there
Show me how I can wait 
For the end
Two abandoned souls together
Conquering the sky
Can you hear their silent cry
One sweet summer night

Tell me why what I touch
It's always cold
And the nights there's no place 
For me to hide.
And my heart forever search
Those two shining eyes
As the time still remain in this damned
Night

[Chorus:]
When I go forever
Shall I meet you far beyond
The gates of star
You and I together howling for the 
Crime
