Land of the dreams
And my fears are growing
Into my heart like the clouds in the
storm
Take me so far to the lake of Sarnath
Where the flames of war light an
Ancient throne

[Chorus:]
It's so late, to find the gate
I've lost my key, into the dark of the
Grave
Under the moonlight, I saw the sign
My eyes will burn until the end of the
Time

Brother's echoes,
Allies of the night
Bring him, crown him
Master of the lies
Evil spirits, play the march of deads
Till the lord of Heavens, breaks
The chains of slave
