Listen down from the sea,
Thru the whispers of trees
Magic calls of Princess
Warriors from Hell
Come - come to me...
Spirits from a haunted dream.
Give me your power and take my life 
Away

Down from the sea
Far beyond of the Altar
Running free
In the path of darkness
This morning of blood
Screams and madness
From the temple of wrath
I wait oh Princess
Give me and take from me.
Give me your power and take my life 
Away.
