Into the fog
I see the shadow of the King.
Comes with sword
In hand to fight the beast.
Red skies and poison shines
Follow his arms
Knights of secret fable
Rise one by one

[Refrain:]
Kingdom of the Kings
With the seven star Queen
Kingdom of the Kings
Your gates sealed 
By the winds

Now in the stone forest
The battle just began 
Army of burning Rose
Holds the secret and the Keys.
Hearts and Armour
Meet the flag of destiny
Thirsty earth drink the blood
Of mystery.
