Oh! This gloriest night
When our nations rise
From the dust of shinig past
Soldiers of the fable
Keep our flag and faith
In the castles of our heart

[Refrain:]
Show to the liars
Our price for their sin
Give 'em a lesson of blood
Teach them with fire
Until they kneel
We have the power to fight

Troopers on the borders 
Following the orders
From our history and past.
Riding to the glory
We must never worry for our families 
Or lives
