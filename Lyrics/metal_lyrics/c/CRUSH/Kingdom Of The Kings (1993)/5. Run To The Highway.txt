Out in the Streets you can see
She brings the jewel of the gift
And you'll never believe all those things
You'll see when you're screaming
For help, she takes the next.

[Refrain:]
Run to the Highway
Escape from your love. [2x]

Now I cry for you man
Cause you are in her bloody bed
And she'll never exist.
She is just another fable
And no none could see her face.
