Over the mountains and the fields
A star brings us the warning
Riders will come thru the storm
Carrying the flag of Hate.
Angels of fire, Priests of blood
Open the book of secrets
Between the ages and the time
The sleeping one will rise.

[Refrain:]
Oh! Flag of Hate
What price must we pay
We die for a sin day after day.

Slaves of darkness, Kings of the Earth
Pray to the temple of Evil.
Chaos, Destruction, death and pain
Made by the human being.
Angels of mercy, Priests of truth
I've heard you voice of wisdom
All of the secrets must remain away
From human eyes.
