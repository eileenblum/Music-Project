Across the ocean
Up on the waves of Hell
Welcome angel of death
Unborn waiting to conquer
The earth.
Witches and demons
Down by the ruined bridge.
Behind the gates of fire
The Unborn lives

[Bridge:]
Oh, big master, I beg you again
Give me the power to fight for revenge.
By Lucifer's coming
No mercy, no help, crime and violence
And falling heads.
Unborn waiting to conquer the earth.

[Refrain:]
Unborn - Unborn
Oh make me strong
To fight the world
And when I die for you
Show me the truth.
