[music and lyrics by Nick Saloman (The Bevis Frond)]

When I get tense and I can't decide
I got to get out what I got inside
I got to let off steam. I got to do what I do
And it always seems to depend on you
You're in the sky in your God disguise
Well, I don't believe, I just despise
And there ain't no point I wish to make
I just wanna be your undertaker

When I feel hurt and put upon
I don't want to hear that I`ve got it all wrong
I need to be soothed and ministered to
Instead I just get wound up by you
You don't even try to understand
I`m a gentle, sensitive, loving man
And there ain't no point I wish to make
I just wanna be your undertaker
