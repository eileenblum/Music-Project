I see old spirits rise, in brown eyes
a violet smile, a lack of control
we failed to take the chance
long ago, for a day like this, I would have given
all my lifes future bliss
in the past I longed for futile days like this

I see old spirits rise, in your eyes
a violet smile, a lack of control
now we know what we have lost
short ago, for a day like this, I would have given
all my lifes future bliss
I still long for fertile days like this
