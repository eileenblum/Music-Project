[Miriam remix of "Wings But No Body"]

I take you to the playground near the station
we'll burn down the WatchTower house
and get drunk in the pub near the highway
I'd like to drive on now

wings but no body

a yesterday curse has a hold on me
an ever present herd has a hold on me
I will be happy, as happy as can be
wings but no body

wings but no body

a yesterday curse has a grip on me
an ever present herd has a grip on me
I will be happy, as happy as can be
wings but no body
