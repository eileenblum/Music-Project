men as trees, walking

outside angels fall for us
outside giants rule again
outside we'll become like them
outside oh what a fine day

I have my own symbols to dress
I have plenty of hate for this mess

outside
outside

everything will be alright
next time everything wil be alright
wake up my love, wake up
here come the good times

outside Watchers come to us
outside The Elder Ones appear
inside a Black Sun shining
outside they have arrived

I have my own symbols to dress
I have plenty of hate for this mess

outside
outside oh what a war day

everything will be alright
next time everything will be alright
goodnight my love, goodnight
here come the good times
