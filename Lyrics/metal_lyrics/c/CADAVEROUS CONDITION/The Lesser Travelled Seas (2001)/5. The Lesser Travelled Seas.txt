I am the flame I am the dream
I am deep within
I drink beauty with my eyes
yet nothing but dreams in my fist

I am the path I take lead
I never forget I never forgive
I carry the torch and leave you behind
yet nothing but dreams in my fist

wait wait wait
the sad sound of trains

wait wait wait
a fist filled with illusions

wait wait wait
don't smash the silence

wait wait wait
all or nothing at all

the chance of a lifetime
in a lifetime of chance
the wild things in my head
come as close as the end [2x]

beautiful one are you dead or just drunk
while you still sleep I fly through the night
beautiful one are you dying or dead
waiting forever was the life that I've lead

wait wait wait

beautiful one are you dead or just drunk
while you still sleep I fly through the night
sinister one are you dying or already dead
waiting forever was the life that I've lead

wait wait wait

I never forget I never forgive
all or nothing at all

I am the flame I am the dream
I am deep within
all or nothing at all [2x]
