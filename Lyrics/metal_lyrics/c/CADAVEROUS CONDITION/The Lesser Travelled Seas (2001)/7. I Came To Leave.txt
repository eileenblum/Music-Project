a grail for the quest and the spirit of Europe
a love unrequited and a dream to cling to
a flower yet brutal to perfume the filth
so I can breathe again

a grail for the quest and the spirit of Europe
a love unrequited and a dream to cling to
a rain, cloud white, to wash my eye
so I can cry again

a grail for the quest and the spirit of Europe
a love unrequited and a dream to cling to
a rain, cloud white, to purify the sky
so I can see again

- you will still sleep many hours
(here on the beach)
and one clear morning you will find
your boat tied to another shore -

a grail for the loss and the spirit of Nothing
a love untrue and a dream for waking
a flower so brutal to perfume all this human filth
so I can live again

- do not be afraid
you will never see the last drop fall -
