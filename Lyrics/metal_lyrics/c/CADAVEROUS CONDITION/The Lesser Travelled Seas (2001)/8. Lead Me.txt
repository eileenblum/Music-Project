strange things there hanging in the sky
Slovenia in the rain
in search for luck I feel my voice
not different, not the same

someone remember me and what only I did see
Lead Me

old things in alcoholic logic
Garma I hope one day
in search for luck I ruin my choice
I consider to stay

someone remember me and what only I did see
Lead Me

old things in alcoholic logic
Abraxas I call thy name
in search for luck I ruin my choice
I consider to stay

Lead Me
Lead Me you've changed me
Lead Me
Lead Me you've changed me

strange things there hanging in the sky
Utopia in the rain
in search for luck I feel my voice
not different, not the same
