and now our time comes
and now our time comes

there will come a time
we said
but time only goes
the fading of the rainbow
the closing of a rose

we'll make the time
we vowed
but times already made
impatient as the twilight
elusive as the shade

and now our time comes
and now our time comes

we'll take the time
we both agreed
but time is only lived
the clock unwinds
and autumn leaves
run riot in the wind

and time just slips away
they say
like golden grains of sand
and the days and nights
we held so tight
escape from out our hands

and now our time comes
and now our time comes

and now our time comes
and now our time comes
and now it has gone
and now it has gone
