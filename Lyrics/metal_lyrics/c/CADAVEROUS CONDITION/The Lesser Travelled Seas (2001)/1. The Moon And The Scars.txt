don't follow me now

the realms of the past make the future look small
divided we stand together we fall
one question left so I travel back
don't follow me now

don't follow me now

always the same the moon and the scars
forever remain the moon and the scars
again and again the moon and the scars

my flight started in the palm of your hand
a holiday, a summer, a lifetime to spend
out of the black into the night
I just never tried

places once known are hidden to me now
make yourself seen, nightmares know how
hidden like your grave I never seem to find
don't follow me now

asleep but never dead

always the same the moon and the scars
forever remain the moon and the scars
again and again the moon and my scars

and do not follow me now
and I will never change
and I just never tried
and I go back in time (again)

[- excerpt from "May Fragments Not Dissolve" -]

don't follow me now
I just never tried
don't follow me now
