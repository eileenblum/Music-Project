oh my Tesco girl
pretty foreign you are to me
would you like to know yet more
about our fate or the ONT

how is your life ?
(is it) run away with me tonight
the crops may fail but you'd always be true
(I know) a beautiful Tesco girl

are you happy now ?
with all the things that I never gave to you
is it all just a come and go ?
and a lost Tesco girl

farewell (my) Tesco girl
for I will never see you again
another dream brings another face
and I will never know you
