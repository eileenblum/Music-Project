you're close to me, close as the end
I love the past, I must not forget it
I do remember "Dialogue", "Sunrise"
and searching for Liebenfels

bloodyoungblood

you're far from me, (why are you) so far from me
I call up the past and I regret it
outside I stand looking in
and revel in the chill of nihil

bloodyoungblood

not dead in beds of white
not dead a body wired
not dead
he is not dead

he is not dead in beds of white
he is not dead a body wired
he did not die he did not die
he did not die

may the past arise
and change the future
