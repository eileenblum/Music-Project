if it's good to live then it's better to be asleep dreaming

has it all gone or will I fall awake
will I never return to be the same again

droplets of memory are all that remain
strange faces promising new life

does the reward justify the loss
all beauty burned

burned like bridges I once crossed
7 years ago often more

has it all gone or will I fall awake
will I never return to be young again

since it does not matter when
why could I not die then

if it's good to live then it's better to be asleep dreaming
if it's good to live then it's better to be asleep dreaming

I came to leave I start to bleed
a dream within a dream

another wave breaks on a foreign shore
a dream within a dream

all the pain that comes down on me
a dream within a dream

the second side of My Boy
a dream within a dream

nothing nothing nothing nothing
a dream within a dream

a hideaway unseen
a dream within a dream

why could I not die then
why could I not die then
