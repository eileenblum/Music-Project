wait, here we stand
starry-eyed at the crossroads
I do not pretend
here we stand once again

I'm just passing by - come crashing into your life

uncertainty
not enough time
let's hesitate forever
as I stumble I await my fall

I'm just passing by - here crawling into your life

let loose your dolphins to tear me apart
let loose your cats to feast on my heart
let loose your friends to defile my name
let loose a love to engulf me with pain

I'm just passing by and here is your first song
and the light in your eyes, glimmer or pity

let loose your dolphins to tear me apart
let loose your cats to feast on my heart
let loose your friends to defile my name
let loose a love to engulf me with pain

I'm just passing by, sharing your fear of getting old
and now I remember that your hair was golden
