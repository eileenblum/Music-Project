âHere we stand forever.â

We lead the lives we make and make the lives we lead
Going back Iâd change a lot, but not what Iâve now got

One day in time a season of change
This is for life instinct and will

Hear
Listen
They speak to me
All things fall

All things fall yes, Betty Corrigall
This is for life this is for life

Hear
Listen
They speak to me
The taste of winter

It is true
It might never happen to you
You may not see
Whenâs your time
At the crossroads

At the crossroads
At the crossroads

Hear
Listen
They speak to me
The years go quickly
