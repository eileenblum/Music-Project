Repent

Where are you now
I was never here
It is not clear to see
What you gave to me

Your magic works forever
Mine was never seen
Our journey ends in Reykjavik
Where are you now

Repent

The lights go out in a different world
The place where you live today
To get away from all these dreams
Where I have chosen to stay

What I have now is much better
Than everything you could have given

The lights go out in a different world
The place where you live today
To get away from all my nightmares
Where I have chosen to stay

What I have now is much better
Than everything you could have given
