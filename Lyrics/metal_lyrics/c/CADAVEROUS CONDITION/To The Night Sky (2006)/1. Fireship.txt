âPlaces donât change, only people.â

Rod McKuen saves my life each and every day
It took me years to understand and you just turned away
Nothing starts tomorrow, there is no greater time
And yeah maybe you are right, leave it all behind

You go you disappear
But we are still here
Like a fireship

See the people vanish, letters never read
You found your peace, you never looked back
Going with the flow, thatâs your road to ruin
I am still here and you donât know McKuen

You go you disappear
But we are still here
Like a fireship

Here we come with flaming sails

Destroy my day and haunt my night
This life we burn unseen
A sacrifice is not a loss
You stay away, I stay awake

Destroy my day 
And haunt my night
You stay away, I stay awake
And here we come with flaming sails

âPlaces donât change, only people... some peopleâ
