âOnly forgetfulness.â

There is no death and there are no dead
There is no death and there are no dead

There is no death and there are no dead
I canât lose what I never had

A fire in my spine
Salt on my skin
Where did I come from
No one was waiting I just blew in

A flicker on the face
Flashes in the eyes
The sweetest memory
The beautiful lies just like a dream

Black smoke rising
In the waking hour
The journey is over
Throw the flowers into the fire

There is no death and there are no dead
There is no death and there are no dead
I canât lose what I never had
There is no death and there are no dead
