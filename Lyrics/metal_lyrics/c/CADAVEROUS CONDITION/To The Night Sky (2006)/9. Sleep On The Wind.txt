âThe longest journey.â

I go away what they sing they never do
I go away forever going home
I go away back to where I came from
I fade from view just like you

I go away to places you will never know
I go away on ships and trains and aeroplanes
I go away my path remains unclear
I go away towards the lesser travelled seas

In our life we are alone
On our own we sleep on the wind

I go away and leave your lives behind me
I go away and leave you all alone
I go away driving, driving, driving
I fade from view just like you

In our life we are alone
On our own we sleep on the wind
I go away, back to where I came from
I fade from view just like you

In our life we are alone
On our own we sleep on the wind

I go away what they sing they never do
I go away forever going home
I go away back to where I came from
I fade from view just like you

Now, now I see
