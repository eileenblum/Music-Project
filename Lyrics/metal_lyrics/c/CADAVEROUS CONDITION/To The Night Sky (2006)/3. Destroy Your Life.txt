âSomebody who belongs to my world.â

And do you look at the stars
And dream of your past
It was so long ago
Oh did you ever know
Destroy your life 
Iâd like to think that you destroyed your life

I am where I always was, buried inside a tomb of dreams
And here we are on the roof of our life, preparing to fly without wings
All the years have passed in vain and the road gets shorter everyday now
I was waiting for something to happen but then you just flew away

And do you look at the stars
And dream of your past
It was so long ago
Oh did you ever know
Destroy your life destroy your life
Destroy your life

And do you look at the stars
And dream of your past
It was so long ago
Oh did you ever know
Destroy your life destroy your life
Iâd like to think that you destroyed your life

Beneath your old house I saw horses, running free with your mourning
To foreign shores on ships of gold, thatâs where we should be going
But there are things in me that time can never heal
And all the voices in my head: âsummer is just a dreamâ

And do you look at the stars
And dream of your past
Where did you go
And did you ever know
Destroy your life destroy your life
Destroy your life

Do you look at the stars
And dream of your past
Where did you go
And did you ever know
Destroy your life destroy your life
Iâd like to think that you destroyed your life
