âThe birds in my tree are evil.â

Leave the pain behind
And all that goes with it
Cut off all the past
And run for it
It never was that easy
Resign to the fact
Ruin all the bridges
And live a life intact

We go down I go down
Iâm stepping through the door
I quit the day and seek the night
I will never be reborn

Bury my hate The Loneliest Grave
Bury my hate The Loneliest Grave

Left behind with pain
And all that comes with it
Cut off all the past
And die for it
Itâs too late now
There is no going back
Burn all the bridges
And leave a life intact

Bury my hate The Loneliest Grave
Bury my hate The Loneliest Grave

We go down I go down
Iâm stepping through the door
I quit the night and seek the light
I do not want to be reborn

Bury my hate The Loneliest Grave
Bury my love The Loneliest Grave
