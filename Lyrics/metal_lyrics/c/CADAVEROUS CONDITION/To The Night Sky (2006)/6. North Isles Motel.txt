âAnd the promises that we made.â

Take the ferry across the Sound
Pass green fields and narrow ways
On the hill the old Windhouse
We are here to contemplate

I meet you in the North Isles Motel
Here we start life again
I meet you in the North Isles Motel

Take a walk step out of time
An empty beach where animals die
So far away it feels like home
Forever bound to travel on

I meet you in the North Isles Motel
Here we start life again
I meet you in the North Isles Motel

I meet you in the North Isles Motel
I drink up in the North Isles Motel
I touch you in the North Isles Motel
We start again in the North Isles Motel
