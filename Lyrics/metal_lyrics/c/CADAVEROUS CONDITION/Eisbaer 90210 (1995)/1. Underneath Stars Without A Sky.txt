look, the birds are falling down
just like rain they reach the ground
and all the fools keep bleating

oh look, the White Ship, over there
come here, but dog damned days are near
I think someone tears my heart apart

I revisit a place I found with you
with the memory all the pain comes, too
now the stars have no sky
imperfection and you lie

the cosmic chaos of life and of lights
oh I think I loved you at first sight
now all fell down and fell dead
and left me here with nothing
