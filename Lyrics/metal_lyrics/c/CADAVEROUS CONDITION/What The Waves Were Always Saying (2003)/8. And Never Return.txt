a different world waits for me
a hideaway from all that's wrong
across the waves to enchanted isles
far away and there we'll stay

we all live troubled lives
but I'd rather stay here in the dark
you like the west but I go north
there is more than one true love

I'm just passing by and people change
hearing you say "people change"

and then you blackened all the stars
and then you never looked back
and then you sent the gods away
and then they never came back
and then I saw you in my dreams
and then you never came back

I am still the same but people change
hang on, it's gone and people change
