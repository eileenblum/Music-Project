I remember the dreamwind
filling my sails then blowing me off course

I remember the blue sky
the follies of youth and a wish to die

I remember things held close
thrown away and forgotten

I foresee that it will come true
this my wind now blows for you

calling calling
across the blue

I remember the black heart
the knowledge of age and the falling apart

I remember the feelings I lack
and the friendships that were a stab in the back

calling calling
across the blue

I will burn this page today
I will throw my life away
I just do not want to stay
I give it all to the beautiful sea

calling calling
across the blue

calling calling
across the blue

to the distant grey
