coming late but here we are
on our forehead the fallen star
so here I am, here I stand
await the moment time will bend

coming back out of the dark
on my forehead I wear the mark
feel the day when it's all gone
now we make the past undone

now we make the past undone

arriving late yet here we run
in our heart a secret sun
here I am, here I stand
and my world will never end

now we make the past undone

come come
now we make the past undone
go go
to the place where we all must go
away away
listen, "remember the day"
you say
all those years get washed away

now we make the past undone
