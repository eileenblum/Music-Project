"Everything is alright" you said
"It was all just a joke" you smiled
And I felt happy, I felt released
But as I woke this dream did cease

Yet Carcassonne was never so far
Sandra and a swastika

It's all so dog damned real
Your words cut me down
Wake me when it's over

I see you in the mirror lying naked on the bed
You closed your eyes and dreams take you away

"Everything is alright" she said
"It was only a joke" she laughed
I felt so happy, I felt released
But as I woke the dream deceived

I mess up the days of the week
The radio rocks me to poisoned sleep

I see you in the mirror lying naked on the bed
You closed your eyes and dreams take you away
Why do I so often think about what could have been
When it is not
It all just sounds like Nine While Nine
