Hey let's make it real
To immortalize how we feel
The wound "life" to forever heal
And noone's left our love to steal

You, stranger, non greek and the wild
I gave you all my time

I remember a time, as time ran through
My fingers like sand
And sometimes the earth is a disc for sure
But I was only thinking of you

I thought I climbed higher than I've ever been
But now I fall from heights I've never seen
Everything is wrong

You say we don't belong
