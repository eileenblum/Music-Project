Now you don't see me
I have closed my eyes
But now I am lost
You closed your eyes

Despair dancing in my heart
As I ran to escape my tears

I, I am alone, there is no God where I am

Rise, the memories
Now, I'm far away
Feel, it's all so useless
I, I blame life for all this

I'm jealous, coming to grief
Sometimes I'm not afraid
Sometimes I wish you my pain
And sometimes I hate

And if I was a cat
I would stare all the time
With depth in my eyes
Right into your stars

Time flashes in your eyes
Something bigger than life
