Outside we sit at night and watch the stars and satellites
Then we go inside, warm up our hands but not
The chill in my heart

Harmony harmony harmony
Will never be
Harmony tragedy

Outside we stand by day, feel the vastness, feel the wind
That casts away the clouds after rain, but not the sorrow
In my eye

And if harm comes your way, count on me I'll
Wash away the fools
Because my blind love evokes my blind hate
And that's alright for this is.......

And do we talk about all this dread, a nothing life
A nothing future
Then we let the sun shine away your fears
But not the sorrow in my mind
