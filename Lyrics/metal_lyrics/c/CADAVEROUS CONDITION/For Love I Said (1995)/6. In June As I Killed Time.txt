Later as we say goodbye
I realize, all is well for her
It's 3 A.M. and I don't know that
My reason to live is soon to come

Come with me, my horizon widened
Dawn comes fast and the birds sing loud
My eyes are coloured with the red
That's on the sky and the clouds

I see it all through a romantic haze
And wait to be cut again
By the not so fair
The barbed and poisoned dart of Cupid

Tell me what friends are for
I hate all my sadness songs
My dreams are difficult and they
Depend on and collapse with yours

Later as we say goodbye
I realize, all is well for her
It's "I don't know" and I don't care
But a reason to live is yet alive

Come with me to complete my life
Night comes fast and the air is warm
My eyes are filled with the kissing,
Glancing, loving, bleeding, singing...

May your pains be softened
May your throes be driven away
May your pains be softened
There are things that wash me away
