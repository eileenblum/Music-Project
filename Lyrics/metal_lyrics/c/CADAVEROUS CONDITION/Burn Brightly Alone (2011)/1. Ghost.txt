I want to be wanted in my time
I want to think time is on my side
I want to be standing in my shoes
I donât want to be just like you

we are all ghosts here

I will never be just like you
where can we go to but away

we are going to a place that doesnât exist
when sleep comes you do not want to return
keep and conceal and never reveal
there are ships out there tonight
to hide away is a lesson well learned
just keep walking, go walking down this track
going somewhere
some place called back

ghost

we are all ghosts here
I want to be wanted in my time
I want to believe time is on my side
I donât want to be just like you
and you would hate to be like me

ghost
