remember, remember
do you remember
do you, do you remember

do you remember when your life went wrong
you are hope but you are gone
still you appear in dreams, head like a sun, ferocious and mean
but we have all been told lies

lies, lies
but remember
we donât bend
we break

all this means nothing
when in Wicklow the stars begin to fall

no matter what they take away from me
no matter what they take away

remember, lies, remember
do you remember, lies
do you, do you lie

do you remember where your life went astray
you are hope but you have gone away
but please visit in dreams, communicate, hex and shine
until we meet again

remember, remember
I remember you
I remember lies
