like lights in the houses I pass in the night
the lonely things, they have arrived
this is the weekend, this is the end
bereft of dreams, please donât disappear

all the years rush by
and the river flows faster now
the clear wild eyes of youth
and a stone to drown the memory
all the forgotten things
a tranquil place awaits me now
strange songs we sing
and the river flows faster now

and then I can let go

like faces in the window, inside the light
are they ever friendly, or only young
I was going to the house at the top of the world
one day I had it all, the same day I threw it away

all the years float down
and the river flows faster now
the clear wild eyes of youth
and a stone to drown the memory
all the forgotten things
a tranquil place awaits us now
strange songs are heard
and the river flows faster now

and then I must let go

snow falls all around this lonely room
and the river flows faster now
the walls come close, this hotel room
and the river flows faster now
outside it seems so pure, so clean
and nothing can save us now
submit to the lonely things
and my river dies into the sea

all the years rush down
and the river flows faster now
the clear wild eyes of youth
and a stone to drown them all
these are the lonely things
and my river flows faster now

and now I let go
