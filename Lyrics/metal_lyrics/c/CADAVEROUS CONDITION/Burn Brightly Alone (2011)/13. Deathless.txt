counting the stars and the lights in the hills
out on your own thereâs no comfort in moonlight
do we still dream of the sea?
aimlessly, desperately  

at the crossroads, screaming
âwe donât need your desert godsâ
and all the things we never said
and the thing I never said

when all things come to pass
and my world falls apart
there was only you
