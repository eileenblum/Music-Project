wait, for this life to be (over), travelling from the mountains to the sea
weâre more than halfway there, from Vaila Hall to Stanyan Street
there was a time when songs saved your life
fly I shall and flee we must, how I shone when no one was watching

this is the way of the waves
the tide has left me here
the crooked path never ceases to end
this is the way of the waves

and somewhere, not far away, in a foreign town
a strange girl, I never really knew, is shifting the furniture around

I have driven that road so often
I have driven that road so long

this is the way of the waves                   
the tide has left us here                           
the crooked path never ceases to end (it never ends)    
this is the way of the waves 
what the waves were always saying

and you all went home those nights and forgot
while I still search for something that brings me peace

shine unseen, then disappear
shine unseen, then disappear

this is the wish that didnât come true        shine unseen, then disappear
this is the curse, we are all cursed        shine unseen, then disappear
but our ghosts will forever stay        shine unseen, then disappear
and the city glows in the night        shine unseen, then disappear
