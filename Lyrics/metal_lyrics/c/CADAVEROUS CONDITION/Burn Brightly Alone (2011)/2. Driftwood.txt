the sound of the train in Bonners Ferry gets me out of here
black eyed girl from Vik, Iceland who gets you out of there
a walk on the cliff, in the air a âwhat ifâ gets us out of here
another town and another face, another mark on the driftwood

driftwood

a town by the sea and a life to grab, I get you out of here
no one saw the little signs I gave, the hints and all the lies
these are special dreams and a poem in your box of beautiful things
when you canât sleep do you think of me and death on a driftwood beach

the sound of the train in Bonners Ferry gets me out of here (out of here)
black eyed girl from Vik, Iceland who gets you out of there (out of there)
a walk on the cliff, on your face a âwhat ifâ gets us out of here (out of here)
another town and another name, another mark on the driftwood

there comes a time
choose wise your words of magic
or else they disappear
theyâll get you out of here
