when this world fades away
alien angels reign again
when we fall we break like waves
on the shores of wasted time

when this world disappears
do we speak the secret names
eyes that glow like the sun
and you will not forget me

they are seven they are seven
in the valley of the abyss
they are seven

they are seven they are seven
in the numberless stars of heaven

they are seven they are seven
in the depths of the ocean
they are seven

they are seven they are seven
forever and ever
they are seven

I
send the light of the moon
right into the soul of my enemy
