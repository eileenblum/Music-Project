what a beautiful mess you are
blood and starlight shine tonight
thereâs something in the air
and we go there

with golden hair into oblivion
suffocate the memories, enemies
I will never forget what they have done
what they have done

what a beautiful mess you are
blood and starlight, they shine tonight
thereâs something in the air
and I go there

I take the small roads out of town
redemption just around the bend
I don`t know how long this travel takes
a true journey has no end

I take the small roads out of town
a strange house and a beckoning light
a sight that promises so much
but never do I go inside

drive drive drive all my life away
everyone searches for a place to stay
someday you will understand, now come and
take the small roads out of town
