I tried so hard to reach you
when the stars have cursed you
it is a lonely sound
when your life breaks apart

behold and see as you pass by
as you are now so once was I
as I am now so you will be
prepare for death and follow me

I havenât changed but the world around me
I havenât changed but some people near me

one day we will meet again
and let the planets rush through my veins
the borderline lords of solitude and mourning
welcome to the Order of the Forlorn

I havenât changed but the world around me
I havenât changed but I better had

one day we will end it all
this last song, we will never come back
voices from the past donât tell the truth
forever I serve in the Order of the Forlorn

I tried so hard to reach you
when the stars have cursed you
it is a lonely sound
when your heart breaks apart

behold and see as you pass by
as you are now so once was I
as I am now so you must be
prepare for death and follow me

one day we will meet again
and let the stars rush through my veins
the borderline lords of solitude and mourning
your first day in the Order of the Forlorn
forlorn
