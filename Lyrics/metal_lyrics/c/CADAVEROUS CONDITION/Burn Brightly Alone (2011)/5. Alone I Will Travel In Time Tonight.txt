a sacrifice, a crack in time

we walk on glass, I spin in despair
we dance in the halls of the past, gateways no longer there
to nourish a dream and feel it disappear
we harbour the thought of youth, a bloom no longer here

a ritual to shape the fabric

hereâs the place
a familiar scent
a state of mind
going back in time

here I am
waiting for ghosts
and sometimes
they appear

sometimes
they rise

but you are falling, you are falling
you are falling
not flying

but you are drowning, you are drowning
you are drowning
not diving

Alone I Will Travel In Time Tonight

but you are dreaming, you are longing
you are craving
not living

Alone I Will Travel In Time Tonight

here I am waiting for ghosts
here I am waiting
and I wait
