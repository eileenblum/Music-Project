"in power we entrust the love advocated"

I embrace you, I embrace you
let me watch, your feline dance
I embrace you, I embrace you
do you feel, the feline eyes

and I watched you in your sleep
this piece of heaven by my side
I wished it could forever be
spend my life by your side
the ecstasy I feel
when I look into your eyes
you could make life worth living
so I say

you wake up in the morning
and I smile for you
believe me, I would forever do

I embrace you, I embrace you
let me watch, your feline dance
I embrace you, I embrace you
do you feel, the feline eyes

and the world is cold
but I think I'll get trough
I wished it could have been
my weakness, you
the melancholy I feel
when I fall into your eyes
you could make death worth trying
still I'd swear

you wake up in the morning
and I smile for you
believe me, I would forever do

again I'm alone, left in despair
"just drive out of here and then stop anywhere"
please do not let all fall to pieces
just throw your present life away

again I am hurt, again I wait
"we have to go, it's getting late"
tears of joy would be something new
a kiss and a smile, tears for you

just remember that all I said was true and honestly meant
I'd stay with you until the end
