"das was wir lieben mÃ¼ssen wir lassen,
nur das Leid ist lang"

you have my words, you know my thoughts
you have it all, all for you
blackness all around, your hand took mine
you know it, too, the Flower, remember
words are hard to find, to catch the spirit
that charmed my soul, that crippled me
that piece of life you held, you mesmerize it still
it haunts me all the time, you are in my dreams

you remain may it be again
you remain eyes as the rain
you remain time in pain
you remain I wait in vain

I've cried for you, I cry for you
why can't it be alright, why can't it be forever
it is disillusioned, but still I don't know
I can't see through, what do you do

- I am in your dreams
the ones able to be recalled
and those disremembered
and the ones that don't come true

you wish that those fragments may not dissolve
for there are some
there is one
who can make this picture whole

eyes and hearts and thoughts to see
my life, a hand to hold, to be
tears reign in heaven, rain for me
oh lead me back to ecstasy

tears fall on the Flower, fall on you
tears fall on the angel, fall on you

I'd give it all up, now, for you
(please) return the joy when I'm with you
give me a souvenir that reminds me of you
I'm standing here and I think of you

some of us are precious, some of us feel pain
in my mind, you remain
I call your names, all the more I feel (the sorrow)
I reach out for, may I not feel (the stranger and the fear)
