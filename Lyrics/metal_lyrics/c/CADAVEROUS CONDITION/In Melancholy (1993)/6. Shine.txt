"nowhere will be world, but inside"

there could be a future, I see it bright, I don't see
it clear
there is a place, I'm part of it with you
there is joy and all the pleasure
and there is also something I longed for

I'd give it all up, I'd throw it all away
but all that's left is me here in despair
hear the serenade
this serenade of my soul
my tearful words for you to shine

maybe you are present right now
and maybe I point at you right now
and if you are not
I wish it would be
that you would listen to my wail

I want to wave farewell to my lament
forget all my pain, my waking hours
I'll wake you in the morning
in a time when luck is mine
I await a time for me to shine
