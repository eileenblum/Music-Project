"I am alone: there is no God where I am"

pass the fields of white
leave the dead behind
so many impressions that night
everything surrounded by tears

and you in the north/south
this place and eyes, my life
may it never fade
the memory and the photograph

waiting a train
waiting a hill
waiting again
waiting still

and I wait

waiting past
waiting

and I wait

I come back
memories by my hand
angels by my side
to watch over this lights
