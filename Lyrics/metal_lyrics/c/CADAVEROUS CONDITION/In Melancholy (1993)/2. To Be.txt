"tears run from my feline eyes"

did you ever know
you, so far away
waiting for an answer
waiting for another time
some kind of heaven
let your depths shine
the heartland may be flooded
the spire never drowns

just like the place
I always long for
to know I'll never reach
never reach you
thoughts and memories
are remedies to get a glimpse
of this light
I raise my arms toward

once more lights
everywhere anytime with you or you
oh do I dare
in the narrow next time
oh do I get
a next time at all
just take me out
I will try again
