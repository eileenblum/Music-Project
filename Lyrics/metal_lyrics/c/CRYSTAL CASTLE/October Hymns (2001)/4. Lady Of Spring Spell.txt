The night is calm in the forest
The leaves in the trees
Died with the colours of braise
Where no one dares to go
The trees have heard a magic voice

[Chorus:]
The wings of time
stopped their fly
The crystal snow
will pierce the sky
Lady of spring sleeps for a while
The spell of time have
Closed her mind

With autumnal breeze
The magic queen dances
To her cradle
Blinded by dust of hell
The lady of spring
Is under the spell

[chorus]
