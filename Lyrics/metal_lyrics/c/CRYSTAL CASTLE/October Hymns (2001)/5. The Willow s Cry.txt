When I close my eyes
In a sleepless dream
I hear a crow sings
The dark song of terror
Slowly her wings turn
To shade of hellfire
And shows her angel face

Once again in the Vidgal valley
The Willow's crying blood
From this magic tree
The raven watches the scene
Of a furious rebellion
In the land of the legend
Morrigan's people pray
For the end of war today
This furious rebellion
Breaks the land of the legend
Morrigan's people cry
The end of king on battle field

After the bloody battle
Morrigan flies
(through the field of corpses)
And gathers the souls
Of brave warriors
(that she's setting free in
majestic Uparsyn fall)

In a hard torrent of passion
Morrigan flies
Through the skies
And gathers the souls
Of Brave warriors
That she's setting free
