Our legions run to victory
Riding with horses made of steel
Fighting for power and glory
In the name of

[Chorus:]
Heavy metal
We live for
Heavy metal
We scream for
Metal thunder hits your brain
And the Devil flows in veins

To break the silence
And face the fear

Heavy metal will set you free
When the fire meets the steel
In the face of the devil I scream
Long live to metal

[chorus]
