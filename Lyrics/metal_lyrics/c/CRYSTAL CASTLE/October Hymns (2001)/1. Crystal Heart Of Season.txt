Horresco referens
In girum imus nocte et
Consuminur igni
Horresco referens
Subi dura a rudibus
Omnia vincit infernum

Trapped in this world
This land of fear
Where the cold wind of north
Tortures my skin
In this crazy world
Where my frozen hands
Just want to stay alive
I just want to find the key
The key of the Crystal Castle
Where the heart of all the seasons
Will turn to eternal spring
An ocean of tears

[Chorus:]
Flow from the eyes
Of thousands kings
The frozen screams of agony
The dragon's fire
Deep in my eyes
The hero cries
But stays alive
(Flow from the eyes
Of thousand kings
The screams of pain and agony
The rage of gods
Throw rain of tears
Eyes of kings will stop to cry)

It's just the beginning
The beginning of a holy crusade
At the sacred heart of
The Crystal Castle

After the eternal winter
All the people of the ancient valley

Will raise their voices
To the salvation of a new king
Freedom my friends

[chorus]

Horresco referens
In girum imus nocte et
Consuminur igni
Horresco referens
Subi dura a rudibus
Omnia vincit infernum
