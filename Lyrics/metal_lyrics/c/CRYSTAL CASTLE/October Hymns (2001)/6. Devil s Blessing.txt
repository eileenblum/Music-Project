It seemed that out the battle
I escaped Walking down
The stairs of the burning tower

[Chorus:]
By the vision of a thousand pains
I realized the truth
On a throne made of broken wings
The evil sings his dark prophecy

In the mourning, I've drawn
Back the path of hope
And see the sordid destiny
Of a million children

In the crimson venom of their father
A million children baptized
And creeping for eternity in pain

[chorus]
