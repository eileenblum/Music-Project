He is the slave condemn
To eternal night
Sweet lady is the prey of
The October wind
The monster strikes again himself
Hear the screams of pain

Every night I follow
My sweet, prey and with
Passion I release her from
Her poor life
And on a black bed of dead roses
I lay down her innocent remains
I cry of rage at the savage I became
Since too long I've been here
And spread the pain
Sweet October wind I want to fly

[Chorus:]
In their sorrow once more I die
In their deliverance of life
My imprison

And when the sun 's rising
With the moon

Run to darkness far from her
A new life I don't want
To live forever
I am not the man you think I am
I'm not this beast
I cry of rage at the savage I became
Since too long I've been here
And spread the pain
Sweet October wind I want to die

Post mortem nihil est
Ipsaque mors nihil
Interdum lacrimae
Podera vocis habent
Erit haec quoque
Cognita monstris
Malum est mulier
Sed necessarium malum

[chorus]
