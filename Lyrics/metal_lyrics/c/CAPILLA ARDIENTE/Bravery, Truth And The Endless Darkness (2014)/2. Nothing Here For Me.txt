Cyclopean halls and colossal monuments
Reduced to burning ruins
There is no wall, there is no watchtower
These flames can't turn into ash

Thousands of fatal wounds in this night of fire
Thousands of silent dead
Separate limbs, following the steel desire
The cold silver death

Consumed structures and liefless flesh
...A cenotaph no one will ever see
I look to the clouds and think of black waves
I chant an oath no one will ever hear

This sword will protect me into darkness
This torch will light me through darkness

Each one I was bonded to now is just a memory
Stabbed by my hand
Everywhere I belonged now is just an ancient dream
Burnt by my hand

Thousands of fatal wounds in this night of fire
Thousands of silent dead
Separate limbs, following the steel desire
Shining and burning!

This sword will protect me into darkness
This torch will light me through darkness

What was my everything
Now turns into nothingness
Cursed by madness and lies
Purified by steel and flames

Now there's nothing here for me
Just the sound of distant shores
The midnight ocean calls my name
And my oath I will fulfill...

This sword will protect me into darkness
This torch will light me through darkness

This sword will protect me into darkness
This torch will light me through darkness
