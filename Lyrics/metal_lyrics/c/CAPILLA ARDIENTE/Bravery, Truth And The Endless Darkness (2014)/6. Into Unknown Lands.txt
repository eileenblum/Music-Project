I'm passing through confusion and see
The lunar fog approaching
The purifying white cloak arrives
And everything becomes pale

My sword is disappearing and my torch I can not see
The boat is getting blurry now
My body engulfed by the brume Albedo is all I see
Incestuous callings in my mind

The fourth and seventh principles rule here
The monarchs are unchained now
Coniunctio oppositorum arise
The Moon, the steel, the Sun, the flame

My hands now hold a flaming sword, a portent never seen
Two become one and one is all
The whiteness begin to fade and I can see the unknown
The crimson coast will see me come

Into unknown lands
I will find the red wine of wisdom
Into unknown lands
I will drink the red wine of wisdom

My boat strands in the desired shores of the Rubedo
Where ruby sands wait for my feet
Reflecting while I'm wandering in this mysterious landscapes
My quest is not finished yet...

Into unknown lands
I will find the red wine of wisdom
Into unknown lands
I will drink the red wine of wisdom

No turning back
I will set fire to my boat
No turning back
The flaming sword must be gone

Now pure and valiant I travel to the center
To the core of this marvelous mystery
Where the wellspring of wisdom emanates

The blood red wine runs from the heart of the occult stone
I know these lands will share my lonelyness
In the dream of the archetypes, where there is no tomorrow
The first principle enlighens my way
