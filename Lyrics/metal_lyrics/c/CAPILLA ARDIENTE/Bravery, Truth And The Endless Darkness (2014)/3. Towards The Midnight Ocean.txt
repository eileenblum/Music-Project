The flaming remains I'm leaving behind makes me project a shadow
A black titan stands in front of me
Walking the night towards the shores I follow this obscure giant
From the black soil to the black waves

Sword on my right and torch on my left, facing my fears in darkness
My heart is anxious for the unseen
I see the boat waiting for me, but there is no rowings
...That is the call of Nigredo

Darkness everywhere
Little the light
Darkness everywhere
The sea is the sky

The spiral ride drags me to the core, to putrefaction and despair
I fight the wish of turning back
This is my fate, this is what I choose, I will survive to understant!
Bravery and truth I will not betray!

Darkness everywhere
Little the light
Darkness everywhere
The sea is the sky

Leviathan, sea serpent, I know you are coming for me
Leviathan, through the waters, your eyes shine just like mine
Leviathan! Your voice I need to hear!
Is it really you? Or just other version of me?

As it is in this boat above the waves
It's down below the immense black sea
Now I know, now I realize
So many lost controlled by fear

Darkness everywhere
Little the light
Darkness everywhere
The sea is the sky

Darkness everywhere
Little the light
Darkness everywhere
The sea is the sky
