As I cross the oldest night
Distant towers with bright lights
They mean hope, they mean peace
For navigators, don't need no fear...

...But in chaos I know
Only a torch's light can exist
Those damned lighthouses I have seen
Are traps for the weak

Those who were lost and now are cursed
Pain and lamentations
And those who never were are those who'll never be
Seekers turned into shadows

They threw their swords and torches
They sail to blinding white rays
The shine of doom is tempting
The crowns, the treasures and the sacred promise

They crash their boats in the hidden rocks
They lose themselves in the antique shades
Their drowning hands try to sink me
My sword protects me into darkness

Those who were lost and now are cursed
Pain and lamentations
And those who never were are those who'll never be
Seekers turned into shadows

And I see they are everywhere
A floating mass of failure
And far away the weeping of opposites
King Animus and Queen Anima

I will nor mourn, but follow my path
To the cleansing mists of the unknown...

Those who were lost and now are cursed
Pain and lamentations
And those who never were are those who'll never be
Seekers turned into shadows

Those who were lost and now are cursed
Pain and lamentations
And those who never were are those who'll never be
Seekers turned into shadows
