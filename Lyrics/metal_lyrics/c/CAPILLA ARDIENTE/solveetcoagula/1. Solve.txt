[Part 1: Materia Vvlgar]

Crafted existence, molded by dogmatic hands
Profane mixtures, condemned to sacred rust.

Forged without fire, outsider to the warmth
Vulgar metal for chains, not royal steel for swords.

Forbidden carbon, paradigmatic gem
Incomplete and unreal, material semi sphere.

Vanish induced terrors, reach individual occult light

[Part 2: DisolvciÃ³n]

You are the dog that hides a secret desire:
To become a wolf and feast on thousand dog's hearts
But in your thoughts a tight and heavy yoke
Suffocate your dreams and asphyxiate your ambitions.

[Chorus:]
Burn your fears, wash away your gilt
Leave behind what you have learned
Bury your past and blow your doubts
Purifying through will.

The leprosy you have has been inherited
Skin the cancerous flesh or sickness you'll inherit.

[Chorus (x2):]
Burn your fears, wash away your gilt
Leave behind what you have learned
Bury your past and blow your doubts
Purifying through will.

The prince that is blind will never become a watcher king
The knight who killed the dragon, will never know the secrets â¦Of fire.

You are the dog that hides a secret desire:
To become a wolf and feast on thousand dog's hearts

[Final chorus:]
Burn your fears, wash away your gilt
Leave behind what you have learned
Bury your past and blow your doubts
Purifying through will.
Erase yourself to find yourself
Be dissolved in arcane flames
Let the ash be the throne where vapor rules.

Where no chain can rule.
