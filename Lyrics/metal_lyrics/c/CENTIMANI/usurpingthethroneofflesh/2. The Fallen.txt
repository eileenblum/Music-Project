Freedom!
For all time we've taken to darkness,
Knowing the hatred within us
Brought up to believe these these lies,
But nothing happens when we die

This church of false accusations
Leading us into damnation
This doctrine of pain
For which we all shall be slain

Fall into the dark
Life of pain we shall embark
I will not be taken
Into these dreams forsaken
Freedom!

For all time we've taken to darkness,
Knowing the hatred within us
Brought up to believe these these lies,
But nothing happens when we die

This church of false accusations
Leading us into damnation
This doctrine of pain
For which we all shall be slain

This concept of hatred
Brought on by years of temptation
I'm free from this life
No longer born of strife

This glass religion
Shattered by stones of hate
This glass religion
Held fast by shackles of faith

This doctrine of pain
For which we'll be slain
For which we'll be slain
