On we ride,
Through years of torment
We march
Through passages unknown

Through forests colored grey
And winter's of pain
We will march
Never seeing sunlight (We ride forever)

This clash of sword and shield
The spill of blood forever
The loss of brothers might
On we ride!

Leaving bootprints in blood
We forge forever on
Trust in my brethren
Thousand winter march

Leather bound weapons
Drenched and emerged in pain
Protecting our lands
From hordes unknown

This clash of sword and shield
The spill of blood forever
The loss of brothers might
On we ride!

[Talking:]
These lamentations of a forgotten land will die,
and we shall be it's savior

I will not see death alone
I have my army with me
We fight!
We ride away victorious!

These wounds full of dirt
These eyes caked in mud
Have seen the centuries unfold
