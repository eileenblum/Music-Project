The black sun rises
Blood splattered apocalypse
This paradise lost
Beyond this fading eclipse

The road is hard, and long
Lead us to kill the light
This damned empire
That brings with them the night

On this, battlefield
They will wield all of their swords and shield
This army of, flesh
Bring with them death, eternal
On this, battlefield
We will wield all of our swords and shield
This army of, death
Bring with us flesh, eternal

The black sun rises
Blood splattered apocalypse
This paradise lost
Beyond this fading eclipse

The road is hard, and long
This damned empire
That brings with them...night!

Charcoal bodies, infect, the ground
Blood, black as oil, spills before the crown
Dismembered heads, form cobblestone-like paths
Through mangled flesh, and crushed bone...we strive!

On this, battlefield
They will wield all of their swords and shield
This army of, flesh
Bring with them death, eternal
On this, battlefield
