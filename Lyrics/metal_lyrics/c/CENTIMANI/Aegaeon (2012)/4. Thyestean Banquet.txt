Out of the blackness two evil eyes
Serving up the main course
Betrayal of brothers, shrouded revenge
Lets settle the score

Retribution on a plate, satisfy my hunger of hate
Burning slow and young, lets turn it up

Caterers of cauterized flesh
Cannibalistic retribution
Overcoming the horror
I will serve you now

Turn my chariot into a hearse
Now all youâll know will now be cursed
