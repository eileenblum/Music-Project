As boulders collide into the tall city walls
We gather at the gates crumbling in awe
Eternal fire in the hearts of us all
The ever burning plights in the cavernous hall

Sliding into mud and shadow coils of
Blackness surrounded like eyes
World in cryptic malice below
Out of the sky and into our minds

Broken shields splinter across the fields
Castles of corpses, our battles build
So the sun burns into our eyes and lands
Sinking pits of fear burns inside each man

I reside I rain, a serpent form I shall remain
Serpent crawling onto our lands
We are more then broken and slain
