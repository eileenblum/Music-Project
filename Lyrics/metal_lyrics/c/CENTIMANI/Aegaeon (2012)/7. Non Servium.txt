Judgment upon you for all the steps youâve taken
You will know my agony, after what all Iâve done

My look of disgust, now you will hang to dry
Allegiance was broken, you severed my wings
Now I shall burn

Now held in high esteem, you favor the sheep
You know the horrors ofâ¦
As they will know about it all, horrors of the deep

My earthly realm, inheriting corpses inflicting pain
My will my fate, out to just rot

Helpless to the inevitable, in witch youâll fail
Violently force feeding you your own ecstasy of betrayal

My earthly realm, I plan my smite
Inheriting corpses torturing all
Now all shall burn

You have become my enemy, all alone w no company
Longing for judgment, till you will be slain
A demon I shall remain
