The fury of the sun unleashed into our breasts
The iron fasces displayed on high
As solid our century stands
My heart swells with pride
As I stand with brothers
Under the standards we shall die

An endless sea of spears
Begging for flesh and bone
To the north we march
Into the lair of the beast

Aeolus shepherds wind
Relentlessly snaps out at our heels
Night falls and bone chills

We live on, my sacrifice lives in all
I my oath shall reside in all

Our swords meet flesh
We fight the last man
We give our lives
To honor our ancient blood

Scarlet, my blood spews forth
The light dims from my eyes
My heart beats for my homeland
As I now slowly fade away
The great river awaits now

The northern wolf draws us into its jaws
Screams pierce the still night air
Chaos breaks the line and spirit
brittle hands pulls us to Plutoâs domain

my oath fulfilled!
