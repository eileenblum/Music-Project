Come into my fields and horde the torment feel
Eternal madness, tortured soul
Iâll show you your eyes until they start to bleed
My dark and twisted realms

Living with insanity, hoping youâll be moving on
Every demon lookin for you, hoping for the light

Lost in psychotic lands
Draped in the blood of the vanquished
All who resides shall not return

My fields of torment, psychotic lands
Waiting is your fallacy, never will you see the light
Wave out to your land and say goodbye
