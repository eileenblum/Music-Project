Neglecting my ruling ends in blood basking in the glory of the wars I ignite.
Worrierâs eyes burning with our fearless pride
The lands I forge from sheer brutality
My war, new age, my country forged 
You will all flea, I plan my siege 
On you
My hunger of blood, my worries loyalty my rain my name will keep on bleeding 
through time
