When I sitting on my floor behind enemy close the door.
I'm not a manowar, but inside me still is a war.
I'm looking on my face and don't see my eyes,
My life is race and full of fucking lies.
Fear! I have weighty reason, keep so far away,
Life is a fucking prison!
I have been sleeping a many years it seems,
Fallen angels at my feet, I'm too lost!
Some face it haunt's my once dreams,
I'lay dying, I'm ghost!
Fear! I have weighty reason...
Follow like a many mans before,
Follow death and I'm looking for...
Fear! I have weighty reason...
