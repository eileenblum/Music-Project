All my doubts are so deep, if it dones true I'll go mad!
Every night, I fall asleap with the fear in my head.
I don't long for your money, I don't long for all your sex!
Something glitters in your hand it do must be father's axe.
How could I have loved this creature how could I have fucked this freak?
I greed is your only future, no thanks no kiss but strong kick!
I don't want to pay any longer for my sins I have done,
Death is not my destination, kill yourself and use my gun!!!
Die for you is not my happiness,
I don't care for life like this.
In yo' heart's nothing but emptiness...
No more war ' want back my peace!
