[Music: Leach, Sardella, Sweeney; Lyrics: Leach]

I sleep at night - you sleep all day
It's a matter of style
I was the hunter - you were the prey
That's the way we liked it

When your body's in motion
I'm trapped by the heat

Our love has taken me higher
You are my angel in black
Let's start all over again
'Cause opposites attract

You're out to play - with every clichï¿½
You had me locked in
You've caught me - well done touchï¿½
You played it to win

When your body's in motion
I'm trapped by the heat

Our love has taken me higher
You are my angel in black
Let's start all over again
'Cause opposites attract

Lookin back at what we had
You will see
We can't give up the love we shared
It's meant to be
