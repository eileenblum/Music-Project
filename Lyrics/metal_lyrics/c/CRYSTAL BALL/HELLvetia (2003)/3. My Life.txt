[Music: Leach, Sweeney; Lyrics: Sweeney]

My mama said can't carry out your dreams
She never liked the things I had in my head

Too hard to take this away
The price of yesterday
And I'm not willing to pay

I felt the magic, I had the balls to say
Yes I'll get it, I'll do it my own way

This is my life - now and forever
I won't give up anymore
This is my life - now and forever
I swear I will - carry on

I took the hard way
No shelter from the storm
The days were empty and grey

I see - I hear, the laughter of them all
Do I play the game of rise and fall

I felt the magic, I had the balls to say
Yes I'll get it, I'll do it my own way

This is my life - now and forever
I won't give up anymore
This is my life - now and forever
I swear I will - carry on
