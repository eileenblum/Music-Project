[Music: Leach, Sweeney; Lyrics: Sweeney]

There you are in the cold wind
Sometimes you don't know
Where you belong
You can't see where you should go
Sometimes you're tired to be strong

You try to rise to touch the sky
Forget your ordinary life

Like a bird high on a wire
To waste your time - ain't your desire
Like a bird high on a wire
Try to fly back - and stop your lying

You never learn from the past
I know life's a race and you've been last
Get up, go out and change your life
I see the truth in your eyes

You try to rise to touch the sky
Forget your ordinary life

Like a bird high on a wire
To waste your time - ain't your desire
Like a bird high on a wire
Try to fly back - and stop your lying

There's a place - where you can go
Just spread your wings
Just flay away - you are a bird
Your path to anywhere
