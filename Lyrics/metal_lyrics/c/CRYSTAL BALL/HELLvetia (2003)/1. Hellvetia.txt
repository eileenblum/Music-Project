[Music: Graber, Leach, Sweeney; Lyrics: Sweeney]

Mountains are higher than the sky
Slowly murdering our pride
Where's this place we call our country
Where's the place where
We are proud to be

HELL - Helvetia
HELL - Helvetia

Silver and gold is what they cry
Kiss the fortunes they all hide
We are living in a dreamworld
We don't care about you
We will make a stand!

HELL - Helvetia
HELL - Helvetia

HELL - Helvetia
HELL - Helvetia
