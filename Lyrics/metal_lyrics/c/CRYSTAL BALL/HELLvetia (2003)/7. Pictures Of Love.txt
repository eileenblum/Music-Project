[Music: Leach, Sweeney; Lyrics: Sweeney]

There was a time we were together as one
I think of you now
The wind cries your name in the breeze

You're not in my world - you left me behind
You were the one who gave me the love
Since you've been gone
I've had to prepare for a new dawn

Will the sun rise
Will you come back this night into my life
I can't survive without you

Pictures of love
Pictures of dreams come true
I'm calling your name
Remember our pictures of love

So many times I spent the nights all alone
I wish you were here
Right by my side in my arms

Forgive me the sins - forgive me the lies
We''l find a way together we're strong
Whatever may come
There's a light in our hearts

Will the sun rise
Will you come back this night into my life
I can't survive without you

Pictures of love
Pictures of dreams come true
I'm calling your name
Remember our pictures of love
