[Music: Leach, Sweeney; Lyrics: Sweeney]

Devils and monsters speed 'round my head
Visions of creatures make me afraid
Make me afraid

When the pain gets too much
Than I need that human touch - Human touch

My head's place where fantasy grows
The spirits use me - so I know, the voices I hear
They're just here to make me fear

Misery needs company
Don't anna face the pain I see (but)
Misery needs company
That's just the way it's got to be

Shadows in darkness - the faces I see
They tell me who I have to be - I have to be

When the heart is empty and grey
I'm hunting for some other way - Some other way

My head's place where fantasy grows
The spirits use me - so I know, the voices I hear
They're just here to make me fear

Misery needs company
Don't anna face the pain I see (but)
Misery needs company
That's just the way it's got to be

Ridding the evil from my life to see the light
I'll open my eyes and then I'll fight to the end
