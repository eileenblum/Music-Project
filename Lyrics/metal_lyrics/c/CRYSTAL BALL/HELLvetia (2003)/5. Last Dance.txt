[Music: Leach, Sweeney; Lyrics: Sweeney]

Always been your dream
To be on stage so proud
Your heart is beating rock'n'roll

They take you hogher, you're wasting away
No time to take back
What's lost through the pain

Life's just a game, fortune and fame
You're going insane but are you to blame

It's your last dance
Begore you're gonna find
That it's your last chance
To leave in all behind

No time to lose now, time to start again
It's just the only way out

How things went wrong
The answers you seek
So look behind the masquerade
And wake up from your dream

Life's just a game, fortune and fame
You're going insane but are you to blame

It's your last dance
Begore you're gonna find
That it's your last chance
To leave in all behind

It's your last dance before you're gonna die
It's your last chance to change it all tonight

Forget your pride and leave your hell
You're standing on the adge, don't let go
