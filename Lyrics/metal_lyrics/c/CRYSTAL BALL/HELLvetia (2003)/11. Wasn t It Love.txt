[Music: Leach, Sweeney; Lyrics: Leach]

The postcard's in my hand
But I still can't understand
Another lonely day has passed without a sign

And my heart I bleeding
And my soul is frozen
I'm living for the day when you're back

All I have inside is my real love for you baby
I ask myself - why did you go

Wasn't it love - wasn't it meant to be
I'll try to hide my pain tonight
Don't know I it's right
Wisn't it love - wasn't it meant to be
I can survive if you won't try
Trust in me tonight

You're so far from home
And I've heard you're on your own
I wanna know what you intend
I'm missing you

[Repeat bridge &amp; chorus]

I used to be - the man for you
But you left me alone
And I want you back with me
Where you belong

[Repeat chorus]

Wasn't it love - you are the one for me
So hurry now - I'm waiting niw
Your arms are all I need
