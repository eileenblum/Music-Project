[Music: Leach, Sweeney; Lyrics: Leach]

They're always preaching the same old rules
Trying to tell us which channel to choose
Can't seem to notice we won't take the rap
No time for talking - better watch our backs

We've got no money - No master plan
No need for worries - 'cause life's in our hands
We are youth - We are no fools
Don't wanna play by their stupid rules

Leave me alove and just set me free
Don't tell me how - how I have to be

We'll take it one day - at a time
No pay - ain't no crime
We'll take it one day - at a time
No plans - feels just fine

We got the power - We got the might
Ni limits - we do what we like
We're still standing - We shout out loud
No more hiding - break from the croud

Leave me alone and just let me see
Don't tell me how - how I have to be

We'll take it one day - at a time
No pay - ain't no crime
We'll take it one day - at a time
No plans - feels just fine
