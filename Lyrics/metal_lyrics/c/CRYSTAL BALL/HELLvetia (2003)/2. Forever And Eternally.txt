[Music: Graber, Leach, Sweeney; Lyrics: Sweeney]

I climbed up the highst mountain
To see where I stand
And I rode the woldest horses
To feel what it is - missing in my life

Can't you see that all I want
Is to be like you
In my world of blind devotion

Forever and eternally
To be like you - I can do what you want
Forever my fantasy
That my heart and soul
Could be mirrored in your mind

I live fast and for the action
To show I'm a hero
Loaded gun is in my pocket
To blow all my fears away from me

Can't you see that all I want
Is to be like you
In my world of blind devotion

Forever and eternally
To be like you - Ican do what you want
Forever my fantasy
That my heart and soul
Could be mirrored in your mind
