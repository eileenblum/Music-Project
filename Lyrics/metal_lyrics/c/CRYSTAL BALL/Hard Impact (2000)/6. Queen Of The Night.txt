She wakes from a dream
Another sleepless night
The moon throws its beam
A silver ray of light

Her memory is just a scheme
All she feels is fright
The radio plays a theme
From a strange old rite

Love she hoped to find
Bloodshed is what sheâs got

Sheâs a queen of the night
From dusk âtil dawn sheâll ride
Sheâs the queen of the night
Came from the other side

Shadows start to gleam
Like the marks of her bite
She cries a silent scream
Canât resist his might

Love she hoped to find
Bloodshed is what sheâs got

Sheâs the queen of the night
From dusk âtil dawn sheâll ride
Sheâs the queen of the night
Came from the other side

Eternal life
You give and take
Living among the damned
Will it never end?

Sheâs the queen of the night
From dusk âtil dawn sheâll ride
Sheâs the queen of the night
Came from the other side

Sheâs the queen of the night
From dusk âtil dawn sheâll ride
Sheâs the queen of the night
Came from the other side

Sheâs the queen of the night
