Youâre sick of building castles in the sand
Change your way of life and make a stand
Make a move, youâll see it can be done
No matter what theyâll say, youâre second to none

Should anyone dare
To put you off your tracks
Push them aside and
Prove that they were wrong

Donât you ever leave your own way
Donât you loose your dream
Donât you ever trust the words
From the source of pure jealousy

If you thought the streets were paved with gold
That is just the way the storyâs told
As you chase your dreams, they seem to run
A long hard way to go has just begun

Should anyone dare
To put you off your tracks
Push them aside and
Prove that they were wrong

Donât you ever leave your own way
Donât you loose your dream
Donât you ever trust the words
From the source of pure jealousy

Fighting the odds
The tears and pain
Running against the grain
Always on the top
Of your senses
Making it all the way

Donât you ever leave your own way
Donât you loose your dream
Donât you ever trust the words
From the source of pure jealousy

Donât you ever leave your own way
Donât you loose your dream
Donât you ever trust the words
From the source of pure jealousy
