In the beginning 
Couldnât trust the words
It took me by surprise
The cross youâve got to bear
Is a heavy load

Donât stop fighting â today

Shine on â shine on
Like a star in the glistening sky
Shine on â shine on
Donât let the night pass you by

âIâll never leave youâ
Is what you said to me
Just closed my eyes and cried
Itâs harder that words can say
âGotta fight for your lifeâ

Donât stop the fighting â today

Shine on â shine on
Like a star in the glistening sky
Shine on â shine on
Donât let the night pass you by, pass you by

Shine on â shine on
Like a star in the glistening sky
Shine on â shine on
Donât let the night pass you by

Shine on â shine on
Like a star in the glistening sky
Shine on â shine on
Donât let the night pass you by, pass you by
