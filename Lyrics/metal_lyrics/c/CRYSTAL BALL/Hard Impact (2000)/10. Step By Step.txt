Iâm standing at the door
Early in the morning
I just couldnât sleep anymore
Illusions of tomorrow
Visions of today
Drained my passion away

Here I am, tell me why
I should follow your wretched advice

Step by step
Iâve got to know
Which pathâs the right one to go
Step by step
In my life
I learned independence my way

Iâll never go to heaven
Iâll never go to hell
Itâs time to break the spell
Sometimes you take a bruising
Sometimes lifeâs amusing
Itâs hard to keep your sanity

Here I am, tell me why
I should follow your wretched advice

Step by step
Iâve got to know
Which pathâs the right one to go
Step by step
In my life
I learned independence my way

All that I that want is to live my own life
Show me emotions and I see you in me

Step by step
Iâve got to know
Which pathâs the right one to go
Step by step
In my life
I learned independence my way

Step by step
Iâve got to know
Which pathâs the right one to go
Step by step
In my life
I learned independence my way

Step by step
Iâve got to know
Which pathâs the right one to go
Step by step
In my life
I learned independence my way
