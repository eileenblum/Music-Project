When the night is falling
The truth seems unreal
Can you hear the calling?
Much too loud to conceal

Do you trust the warning?
Of the gypsy queen
The cards you're drawing
What do they mean?

No matter what they say
It's all in your hands

Crystal ball
You hold the key
Crystal ball
Sail your ship across the golden sea

Walking in the shadows
Can't believe the sight
That where the wind blows
Is made by a higher might

Standing at the crossroads
Don't know what it right
There's only one way
So head for the light

There's always a choice to make
Time and time again

Crystal ball
You hold the key
Crystal ball
Sail your ship across the golden sea

Crystal ball
You hold the key
Crystal ball
Sail your ship across the golden sea
Crystal  ball
You hold the key
Crystal ball
Sail your ship across the golden sea
