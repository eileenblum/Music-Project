You walked in dressed in black
Giving me a heart-attack
With hair of gold, lips like fire
Iâm caught by my own desire
The music plays, the talk is cheap
A promise that youâll never keep
Black leather on white skin
Pride is your only sin

Canât you see?
You canât control my mind

Never surrender
Donât play tricks on me
Never surrender
I ainât gonna give you my love

You scratch my back, I pull your hair
Touch me everywhere
Dirty talk, wanting more
Crawling on the floor
Youâre going down, on your knees
Only for me to please
One kiss of fire, my heart explodes
A total overload

Canât you see?
You canât control my mind

Never surrender
Donât play tricks on me
Never surrender
I ainât gonna give you my love

All I want
Is to find a love so true
Slowly you start to break through
Tearing down my wall

Never surrender
Never surrender
Never surrender
Donât play tricks on me
Never surrender
I ainât gonna give you my love

Never surrender
Donât play tricks on me
Never surrender
I ainât gonna give you my love

All I want is 
Your surrender
Donât play tricks on me
Never surrender
All I want is 
Never surrender
Slowly you start to break through
Never surrender
