Youâre sitting down
In the corner
Out in the cold rain

You stare in the night
And I see â your eyes filled with pain

I ask you to dance
But you say: âyou ainât gotta chanceâ
Fever is starting to grow
Iâm ready for the show

Youâre the one I adore
I bang at your door

I wonât bite
So donât hide
Just let me inside
I wonât bite
Itâs allright
Your eyes are shining so bright

Please let me know your secret
Yes, I need it
Maybe itâs wrong or itâs right
But you know we should try

You drive me insane, yes itâs me
Youâre afraid of my sanity
Screaming for more and an answer
To make you mine

Youâre the one I adore
I bang at your door

I wonât bite
So donât hide
Just let me inside
I wonât bite
Itâs allright
Your eyes are shining so bright

Itâs nice to be in your arms, that set me free
Itâs plain to see, youâre the best girl for me

I wonât bite
So donât hide
Just let me inside
I wonât bite
Itâs allright
Your eyes are shining so bright
I wonât bite
So donât hide
Just let me inside
I wonât bite
Itâs allright
Your eyes are shining so bright
