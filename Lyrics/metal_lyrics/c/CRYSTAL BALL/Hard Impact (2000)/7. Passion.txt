You're lost in the night
You know you got the wrong way
No hope in your heart
Your dreams are flowing away

You can't erase the past
Traces of pain
Desires and longings will not remain

Behind the door
You'll see the daylight
Of liberation

Feel the passion inside
Spread your wings and fly
Feel so free like an eagle in the sky
With power and spin
You'll get the chance to win
Now it is time to stand upright

Don't hesitate
The future is in your hands
You turn the key and you'll see
Where you stand

Behind the door
You'll see the daylight
Of liberation

Feel the passion inside
Spread your wings and fly
Feel so free like an eagle in the sky
With power and spin
You'll get the chance to win
Now it's time to stand upright

Feel the passion inside
Spread your wings and fly
Feel so free like an eagle in the sky

Feel the passion inside
Spread your wings and fly
Feel so free like an eagle in the sky

Feel the passion inside
Spread your wings and fly
Feel so free like an eagle in the sky
