I wonder where you were tonight
You should be here right by my side
But you were nowhere in sight

Your love is killing me inside
You ask me: âdo you feel alright?â
After all we left behind

Donât be afraid
Youâre still in my head

Youâre my soul mate
Itâs a true state
Donât hesitate
And heaven will wait

You know I donât need no advice
You know I donât need any lies
Shut up, you better think twice

Maybe one day youâll realize
And you will see it in my eyes
I love you real with all your smiles

Donât be afraid
Youâre still in my head

Youâre my soul mate
Itâs a true state
Donât hesitate
And heaven will wait
Youâre my soul mate
Itâs a true state
Donât hesitate
And heaven will wait

Youâre the one who made a stand
I just had to make you mine
Here I am, youâre just my friend
Is this the end?

Youâre my soul mate
Itâs a true state
Donât hesitate
And heaven will wait
Youâre my soul mate
Itâs a true state
Donât hesitate
And heaven will wait
Youâre my soul mate
Itâs a true state
Donât hesitate
And heaven will wait
