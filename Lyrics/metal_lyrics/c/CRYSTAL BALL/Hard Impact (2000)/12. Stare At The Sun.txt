Tomorrow â Iâll forget all about the past
Iâve been an outcast
I tried to stay but time was changing fast

Together â together we stood in the rain
You held my hand agin
A gust of wind blown and then you said to me:

Stare at the sun
Bound to the sky
The world will sink in silence
For a while

The hammer â the hammer of hate was my faith
With no aggression
And many things will turn into good

And higher â and higher than the sky
So let me fly
A flash of light will bring me to my goal

Stare at the sun
Bound to the sky
The world will sink in silence
For a while

Tonight â I will reach for the stars
I will ride on the sparks
A light will rise in my heart

Itâs hard to change â different things
But take the chance to extract the tension

Stare at the sun
Bound to the sky
The world will sink in silence
For a while

Tonight â I will reach for the stars
I will ride on the sparks
A light will rise in my heart

Stare at the sun
Bound to the sky
The world will sink in silence
For a while

Tonight â I will reach for the stars
I will ride on the sparks
A light will rise in my heart

Stare at the sun
Bound to the sky
The world will sink in silence
For a while
