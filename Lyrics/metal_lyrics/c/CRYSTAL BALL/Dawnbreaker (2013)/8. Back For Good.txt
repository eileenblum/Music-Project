Walking down that alley
Deep inside your soul
Feeling like a lonesome rat
Trapped in a dirty hole

So stand up â again
Raise your fist
Get out of the mist

Don't give in to pain
That cuts you like a knife
Leave the past behind
Get back into life
Come back â for good
Come back â for good

The burdens that you had to bear
Were a heavy load
Break the chains and free your mind
Life is an open road

So stand up â again
Raise your fist
Get out of the mist

Don't give in to pain
That cuts you like a knife
Leave the past behind
Get back into life
Come back â for good
Come back â for good
