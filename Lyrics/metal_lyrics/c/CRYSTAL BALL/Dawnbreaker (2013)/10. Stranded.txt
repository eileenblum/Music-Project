Scarlet snow is falling
From the wounded sky
A forsaken love is gonna die

All alone and knowing
It's more than meets the eye
I can't go on living this lie

Words can't describe
The way I feel
Is there a cure
For my heart to heal?

I've been stranded on the edge of time
Don't know why we are here
Silent crying in the pouring rain
Where is it all supposed to end?

The sunless sky
Looks like a sea above
I tried to turn the tide with love

Words can't describe
The way I feel
Is there a way
For my heart to heal?

I've been stranded on the edge of time
Don't know why we are here
Silent crying in the pouring rain
Where is it all supposed to end?

A guiding star
So close but yet so far away
Shining on for me
To light my darkest day
