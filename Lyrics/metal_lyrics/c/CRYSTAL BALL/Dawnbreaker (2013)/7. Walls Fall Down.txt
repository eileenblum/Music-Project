So many years have passed
We've been up and down
Now we're hack at last
Gonna take the crown

All this time we couldn't let it go
Call on me we'll take it slow
Oh my God we can't stop now
Don't even try we're ready to blow

Walls fall down
Rock them to the ground
Walls fall down
Lose control and give in to the sound

So you like heavy
All around the clock
Hard yet steady
We're hungry to rock

You like it rough
We play it hard
Can't get enough
We won't let you down
Were ready to rock

Walls fall down
Rock them to the ground
Walls fall down
Lose control and give in to the sound

We are the sound and the light in the dark
We all just came here to rock
