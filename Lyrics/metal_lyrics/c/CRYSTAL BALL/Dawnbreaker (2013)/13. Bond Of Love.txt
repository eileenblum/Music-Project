[Bonus Track]You lie awake
Toss and turn at night
You're all done
For goodness sake
In love again
But you've got a heart of stone

You'll cross the line
You'll break the chains
You'll do whatever it will take
Still you will always be
The one for me

It's the driving force
You're the power source
All I think of
It's the driving force
So don't change the course
It's the bond of our love

Calling your name
In the pouring rain on my own
Who is to blame
Who can I trust
When pain is all I've ever known

You'll cross the line
You'll break the chains
You'll do whatever it takes
Still you will always be
The one for me

It's the driving force
You're the power source
All I think of
It's the driving force
So don't change the course
It's the bond of our love
