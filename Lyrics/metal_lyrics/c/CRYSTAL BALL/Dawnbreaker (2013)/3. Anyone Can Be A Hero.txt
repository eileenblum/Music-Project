Try to tell me I was nothing
Try to tell me I was none
Try to show them I was something
One day I'll be number one

Still you try to pull me under
Still you try to shoot me down
Like a man I took a to stand
And learn to hold my head up high

And that's the reason why
No one can deny
I can show you

What you see ain't always really what you get
Anyone can be a hero

Try to stop me from believing
Try to take my dreams away
Still my ground I wasn't leaving
I will show them all one day

Still you try to pull me under
Still you try to shoot me down
Like a man I took a stand
And learn to hold my head up high

And that's the reason why
No one can deny
I can show you

[2x]
What you see ain't always really what you get
Anyone can be a hero

[Solo]

[4x]
What you see ain't always really what you get
Anyone can be a hero
