[Bonus Track]We're playing to win
A driving force in us all
No one can deny it
We all want to succeed
And the world spins
Fast forward in highspeed

It s never good enough
We've always got to seek for more

Rising up high
Adventure is calling
Learning to fly
Taking your chances
Rising up high
Where the eagles are soaring
Higher and higher we fly
Touch the sky

A feeling of freedom
We are looking for peace of mind
No one seems to look back
At what we all have achieved
Open your eyes
Everything is preconceived

It's never good enough
We always got to seek for more

Rising up high
Adventure is calling
Learning to fly
Taking your chances
Rising up high
Where the eagles are soaring
Higher and higher we fly
Touch the sky

Over and over again we sow
Seeds of reasons to be
Over and over again we grow
Who is now holding the key?

One step at a time and we will see
