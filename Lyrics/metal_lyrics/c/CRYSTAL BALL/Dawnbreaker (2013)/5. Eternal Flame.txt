Another empty feeling I just can't believe
That I miss your warmth, thought you never leave
You filled my world with passion and it felt so fine
I never forget those moments that you once were mine

Gotta stop this sad and endless pain
Let the sunshine come into my life again
Gotta stop this hard and senseless rain
I'm lighting up ... eternal flame

I'm standing at the edge of nowhere
Don't know where to turn
I know I got all before me
There's so much left to learn

Gotta stop this sad and endless pain
Let the sunshine come into my life again
Gotta stop this hard and senseless rain
I'm lighting up ... eternal flame

Wish you were here to help me through
I need your helping hand
Standing here and losing ground
Like shifting sand

Gotta stop this sad and endless pain
Let the sunshine come into my life again
Gotta stop this hard and senseless rain
I'm lighting up ... eternal flame

Gotta stop this sad and endless pain
Let the sunshine come into my life again
Gotta stop this hard and senseless rain
I'm lighting up ... eternal flame
