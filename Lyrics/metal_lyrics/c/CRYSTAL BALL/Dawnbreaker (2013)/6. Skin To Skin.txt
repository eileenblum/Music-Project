I see these strange illusions
A great dream is coming true
You caught me staring at you
I can't take my eyes off you

No need for talking anymore
I know you want it too
Like a moth to the light
I'm allured by you

Its growing so much stronger
Passion's flying high
Can't wait any longer
To start playing with tire

Another sin â Skin to skin
Skin to skin â Where pleasure meets desire
Take me in â Skin to skin
Skin to skin â Playin' with fire

Electrified by a touch, a paralyzing stare
Wanting you oh so much
There's magic in the air

You look at me and I'm getting hot
I look at you and you play it cool
The place is good and the time is right
To feel your heat tonight

Its growing so much stronger
Passion's flying high
Can't wait any longer to start playing with fire

Another sin â Skin to skin
Skin to skin â Where pleasure meets desire
Take me in â Skin to skin
Skin to skin â Playin' with fire

Is it love that I'm feeling?
You're the one, you're in control
Feels like I am dreaming
Love takes its toll, love takes its toll, love takes its toll
