We all thought they were crazy
No they'd never get that
Strange thing off the ground

Guess our vision was hazy
Cos they showed us all
And in a wink of an eye
They took to the sky

Yeah the world was wrong
The brothers were Wright
And it caused a big sensation
Yeah the world was wrong
The brothers were Wright
Cos they gave us aviation

They were the talk of the nation
And the crowds turned out
To witness for themselves

This new elevation
The folks stood in awe
And by the end of the day
They were all blown away

Yeah the world was wrong
The brothers were Wright
And it caused a big sensation
Yeah the world was wrong
The brothers were Wright
Cos they gave us aviation
