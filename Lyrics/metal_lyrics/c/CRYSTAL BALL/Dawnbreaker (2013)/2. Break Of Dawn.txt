You've chosen your way
You've gone too far
Now, tell me who the fuck
Do you think you are?

Yeah, I did all the work
And you still don't understand
Sitting here alone
With a drink in my hand

I don't want it, I don't need it
Can't believe
If you want to fuck around
Just get up and leave

When the darkness starts to hold me
It is time for me to pray

Another night has gone
Another day will come
Another morning light
Take the chance to fight - break of dawn

You're making me sick
And you're telling me lies
It's taken too long to open my eyes

It's the final curtain
It's come to an end
There's no way you can pretend

When the darkness starts to hold me
It is time for me to pray

Another night has gone
Another day will come
Another morning light
Take the chance to fight â break of dawn
