I'm heavy duty
I'm a power pack
An everlasting fuse
Ready to attack

I'm full of energy
Like a battery
Put the pedal to the metal
Full speed ahead the only way to be

Like a loaded gun I'm ready
Pull the trigger set me free

Power Pack â on a high speed track
Power Pack â like a cannonball
Power Pack â gonna give it all
Power Pack â Power Pack

I'm a global player
And I've been energized
I'm a power cell
And I'm oversized

Supersonic madman
Fast and furious
I'm an accelerator
Now tell me baby are you curious

Like a loaded gun I'm ready
Pull the trigger set me free

Power Pack â on a high speed track
Power Pack â like a cannonball
Power Pack â gonna give it all
Power Pack â Power Pack
