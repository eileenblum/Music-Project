Locked in my darkness
With visions of demons in my mind
A world full of blackness
Making light hard to find

Was so close to madness
Chasing those ghosts around
Just fighting my sadness
Feeling that help can't be found

And then the sun came out
Sun came out â Driving the clouds away
Sun came out â Yeah the sun came out
Then the sun came
Turning my nightmare into day
Then the sun came out

Shrouded in blindness
Forced to believe the chips were down
With no sign of kindness
And silence the only sound

Was so close to madness
Chasing those ghosts around
Just fighting my sadness
Feeling that help can't be found

And then the sun came out
Sun came out â Driving the clouds away
Sun came out â Yeah the sun came out
Then the sun came
Turning my nightmare into day
Then the sun came out

Don't go under
When rain and thunder
Seek to plunder
The sunshine from your life
