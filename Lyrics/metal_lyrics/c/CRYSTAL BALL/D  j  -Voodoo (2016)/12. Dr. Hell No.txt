Pressure - I'm under pressure
Like 24/7 - out on the run
Closer - I'm getting closer
Feels like - hard won

Lover - please don't you tease me
Need some time to get back on my feet
Poser - get out of my way
Ran high - white heat

Why don't you call Dr. Hell No
Call Dr. Hell No
Why don't you call Dr. Hell No
Call Dr. Hell
Call Dr. Hell No

Never - not gonna lose it
I'll never give up my independence
Over - it's over and out
Past life - new chance
