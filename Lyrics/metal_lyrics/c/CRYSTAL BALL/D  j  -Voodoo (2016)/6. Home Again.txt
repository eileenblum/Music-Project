See your eyes before me
Looking dark and sad
Tears are rolling down your cheeks
Showing pain you've never had

A soul cries out for guidance
An unforgiving sound
You ask for it - you beg for it 
But nothing comes around 

I touch your face - feel your grace 
But the mirror leaves a shattered trace

Here I am
Feeling lost and lonely
Washed up in the rain
Here I am
Try to find myself
And get back home again

You always did it your way 
Were you strong enough 
But everyone sees your insecurity 
You are not so tough

I'm grateful for your help
That someone understands
Now I've learned to place myself
Within your open hands
