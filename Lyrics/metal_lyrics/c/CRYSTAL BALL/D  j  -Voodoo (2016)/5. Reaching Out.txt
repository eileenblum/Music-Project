Stand in line can't wait to get in
Waiting for the mighty sound
Lights out - spot on - crowd is screaming
Let's get rocked down to the ground

Never mind the strain
And when the stars will set you free
You're riding to the end of a rainbow
And to a foreign land
And over mountains over seas
And the spirit of freedom lives on

We're living to rock 
And we are rocking to live
Feeding my heart and my soul 
To keep it alive
Is all the best I can give 
Reaching out for rock and roll

Back to normal course of my life 
Still touched by the thrill last night 
Supercharged by overdrive
Hit the stage into the light
