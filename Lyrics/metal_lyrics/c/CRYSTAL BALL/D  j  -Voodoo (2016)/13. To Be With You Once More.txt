Born into a mystery, fragile and forlorn 
Everything's new to me, no worries no scorn

Just a helpless dependant, kept so safe and warm 
By the arms of a parent, protected from harm

How I hated those schooldays and how they could burn 
Your wisdom brought new ways, life's lessons to learn

And if I felt troubled you'd reach out your band 
Even if they were doubled they'd simply be banned

You're the path that I follow 
You're the soul I adore
I would beg steal or borrow 
To be with you once more

Youth brought excitement, so free and so wild
But you knew what that meant 
Through the eyes of this child

So you followed my journey, out into the world
Felt proud that you knew me as my life unfurled

But now in the twilight, it's all come to an end
And I've lost that bright light on which I depend

The one I relied on has now slipped away
And knowing that you're gone still haunts me today
