We have travelled such a long long way
Had a lot of games to play
And live for
For women wine and song

Unforeseen you had a change of course
It hit me hard with brutal force
I'm wondering
When all the rights went wrong

Thunder and lightning
Poor lies were striking

So you've crossed the line the last time
You are suspended
Thinking of the time you were mine
You are suspended now
Oh oh oh - oh oh oh
You are suspended
Oh oh oh- oh oh oh
You are suspended - you are suspended

Masqueraded being someone else 
But I've sees your true face
Pretender
You fell into disgrace
