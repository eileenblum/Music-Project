My eye caught the shore
Shook me to the core
Now it's clear that
Eve seen all of this before

My world is no more turning
Everything's on hold 
There's an inner yearning
This memory feels so bold - like gold

DÃ©jÃ -vu (dÃ©jÃ -vu) DÃ©jÃ -Voodoo
The echoes of time coming breakthrough
DÃ©jÃ -vu (is it true) DÃ©jÃ -Voodoo
Destiny's rendezvous

Wanna know so much more 
Like what is in store 
There are so many signs 
that I can't ignore

Is it any wonder
Or just in my brain
Release the spell that I'm under
All repeats again - insane
