Here I am again - lost in my own naked world
Dull I feel the misty morning light
High wire - way up there's a winding rope
Brave I fight against my fear of height

Keep your balance
Don't give up your state of mind
Face the challenge or you'll crash and burn

Take your luck and dare it
Go on - swear it - come on
Time to risk your bet
Dare it - go on
Walk on - come on
No more strings attached
Step by step above the ground
Dare it - go on
Walk on - come on
Without a net

As I stand tall - set my foot onto the wire
Bold I walk into the great unknown
Hold me - so I won't be slipping off
Would I stumble if you just pretend

Raise the curtains
Get into the ring to win
Climb the platform to stand your ground
Keep your balance
Don't give up your state of mind
Face the challenge or you'll crash and burn
