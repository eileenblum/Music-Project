You stand before me
You look like heaven sent
Your passion will touch me
You make me so content

I know there's danger, I feel that for sure
I don't see a stranger, I feel familiar and secure

We are laughing - we are crying 
It's all about you and me
We are living - we are dying
There's never a guarantee

You light my fire
You knock me of my feet
You take me higher
You turn up the heat

I feel I'm dreaming, I must let it flow
I am believing, I'll never let you go

We are laughing - we are crying 
It's all about you and me 
We are living - we are dying 
There's never a guarantee 
We are laughing - we are crying 
Welcome to reality
We are living - we are dying 
Never never a guarantee
