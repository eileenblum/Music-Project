Driving through an endless night 
My eyes reflect the neon light 
Hollywood - heaven and hell

Where the stars are no longer bright
Still it's on - an inner fight
Analyse my way of life

Write this episode
Mental overload
Break free
Break free

The camera's rolling
Reel to reel
Action's calling
Won't conceal
Acting in slow motion
Shooting in high speed 
Welcome to my scene
Director's cut

End of script not yet in sight
A storyline to rewrite
Add a twist or another sequel

Different set - late insight
One more scene must play it right
On the spot a change of cast
