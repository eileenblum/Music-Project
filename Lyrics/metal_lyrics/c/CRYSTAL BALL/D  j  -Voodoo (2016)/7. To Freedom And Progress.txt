Since creation and on through the years
Men's salvation has seen many tears
Forced to hide and taunted for a thought
Constantly afraid we could be caught
Just for a thought

Praised His banner with our swords held high
For His honour were prepared to die 
Hailed His glory sanctified His name 
Re-wrote the story by shifting the blame

Just let it go forget control
And give some downtime to your soul
Togetherness that spirit cannot die
Just take a rest and you'll be blessed
Hail to freedom and progress
Life holds so much more than meets the eye 

We're not alone

Rivals killed immortalised and gone 
Poor excuses for the deeds they'd done 
Forced submission paved the only way 
Flawed transition a new way to pray
