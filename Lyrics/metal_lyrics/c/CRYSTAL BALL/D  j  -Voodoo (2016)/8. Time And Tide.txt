You got your life
You got your faith
Doing fine - follow a given path

You got your strong ambition
You got your love
No doubt - you never gave a thought

Got the power to let it all loose
Trust and your time will come

Time and Tide
Taking your chances
Far and wide - one day
Time and Tide
Your life enhances
Far and wide - your way

It happened in your world today
Knocked on your door
The unexpected - came along your way

You looked and realized
All things that could be
Said and done - you were mesmerized
