[Music: Leach &amp; Sweeney]
[Lyrics: Sweeney]

Flashing thoughts went through my brain
When I saw them cry
With no future and no past
Tell me why

We are lost in our paradise
Weâre lost in our world
Take me back
To the place we once called Earth

Take a ride on the endless train
And heaven turns to hell
What matters when we cross the line
A new dayâll begin

Blind side
No time to rewind
Blind side
Nothing is all right
Thereâs no place where we can hide

Do we waste our precious time?
Do we waste our life?
Face the truth
We canât hide behind a mask

Take a ride on the endless train
And heaven turns to hell
What matters when we cross the line
A new dayâll begin

Blind side
No time to rewind
Blind side
Nothing is all right
Thereâs no place where we can hide
