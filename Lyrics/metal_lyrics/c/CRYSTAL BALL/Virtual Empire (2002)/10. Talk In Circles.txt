[Music: Leach &amp; Sweeney]
[Lyrics: Sweeney]

I am standing in the front of my screen
I canât believe what I see
Am I dreaming or is it real?
It canât be right! Are we living in hell?

They tell lies, soldiers are marching
They wanna win this war
In the name of Jesus Christ
They gonna fight till they fall

Power and might are the reasons for this game

They talk in circles
With their blood in their hands
The future is lost
They canât count the score
Anymore, for that final mourn

We all know they may win the battle
But not win the war
Darknessâ calling, theyâre out of control
They have to pay the price

Power and might are the reasons for this game

They talk in circles
With their blood in their hands
The future is lost
They canât count the score
Anymore, for that final mourn

Weâre almost proud that the nightmare is gone
Itâs right, the mission is done
We see light forever
Peace and freedom has won
