[Music: Leach &amp; Sweeney]
[Lyrics: Sweeney]

Youâre behind your computers and stuff
Tired eyes reflecting from the screen
You play the game and you are so tough
Tonight you start to catch
The Great Cyber Queen

Sheâs right in the front
Just like in your dreams
You pray for her
Get down on your knees

Youâre out of your mind
You think sheâll be yours
Youâre drifting through this
Virtual World

The colors you see
Adrift in the sea
Cyber refugee

You will live in a world of glamour
Stare onto your tracker ball
Youâll be there, fantasy or nightmare
Magic place which is called
Virtual Empire

After the game when the magic has gone
So many days, and nights, that you spent
Youâll open the doors, no reality comes
Youâre losing grip
Donât know what it means
