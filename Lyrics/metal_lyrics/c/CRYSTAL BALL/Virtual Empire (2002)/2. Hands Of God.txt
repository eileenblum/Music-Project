[Music: Leach &amp; Sweeney]
[Lyrics: Sweeney]

Back to the light
Back to your god

If you ever get lost on lifeâs highway
You donât know where you should stay
You donât know where you will go
Then I will let you know

The partyâs over now
I tell you that itâs not your fault
Get the chance itâs up to you
I guess and I know you want it too

Back to the hands of God
Open up your soul
Leaving all behind and go

Here you stay, you feel all the pain
Every night itâs always the same
You donât know which way to choose
But I will let you know

The partyâs over now
I tell you that itâs not your fault
Get the chance itâs up to you
I guess and I know you want it too

Back to the hands of God
Open up your soul
Leaving all behind and go
