[Music: Leach &amp; Sweeney]
[Lyrics: Sweeney]

You like to watch it
She likes to play it slow
Her body is in motion
Welcomes to the show

In the mood for action
Drifting with the flow
Surrender to the game
Sheâs way down low

The time of your life is what youâll find
Sheâll make you lose your mind

Private visitor
She walked right outta your dreams
Private visitor
Sheâs going to extremes

She wants you so bad
Youâre ready to go
She canât get enough
Twice in a row

She made you an offer
You couldnât say no
Double or nothing
Make love in stereo

The time of your life is what youâll find
Sheâll make you lose your mind

Private visitor
She walked right outta your dreams
Private visitor
Sheâs going to extremes
