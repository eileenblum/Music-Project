[Music: Leach &amp; Sweeney]
[Lyrics: Sweeney]

Here she stands all alone
Sheâs heading for more
Sheâs waiting to kiss my feet
Her passion is deep

I donât know her real name
Canât even see her face
The only thing I know
Sheâs lost in space

Sheâs waiting for my command
She made me understand

When the night is over
When the night s gone
I canât you call my lover
I canât hear your moan anymore

Sheâs looking for the maximum
But she knows sheâll never find
Sheâs here to catch the kick
Itâs so sick

She gets down on her knees again
She pleas to be my slave
I give her all she needs
Itâs her life

Sheâs waiting for my command
She made me understand

When the night is over
When the night s gone
I canât you call my lover
I canât hear your moan anymore
