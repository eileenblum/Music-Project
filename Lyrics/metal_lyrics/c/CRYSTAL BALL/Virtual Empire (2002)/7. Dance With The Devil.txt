[Music: Leach &amp; Sweeney]
[Lyrics: Sweeney]

I see your wounded soul
Hear your silent cry
Youâre down in the corner
And you wanna die

Youâre living in a world
Living in a cage
Searching for some words
But you fly into rage

Losing ground of life and fantasy
That is not the way that it should be

Dance with the devil
Youâre close to lose your soul
Dance with the devil
Youâve gotta roll (tonight)

Youâll never see the sun
When youâre hidden in hell
Only hate and fright
Is what you sell

You feel so understood
Doing things in hate
Searching for an answer
But youâre still afraid

Losing ground of life and fantasy
That is not the way that it should be

Dance with the devil
Youâre close to lose your soul
Dance with the devil
Youâve gotta roll (tonight)

Dance with the devil
Follow my empire
Gamble with your soul
And Iâll take you to your goal
