[Music: Leach &amp; Sweeney]
[Lyrics: Sweeney]

Sometimes when youâre crying
Unwounded you bleed
Thereâs no place for hiding
For the poisonous plague you breed

The dark is your only friend
And pain never ends
I told you to leave this way
Right today

Find your ground
Itâll guide your way back home
Find your ground
Until the sun goes down

Sometimes when youâre riding
The dark wings of death
Youâll never be fighting
Against the last drawn beneath

Thereâs something going wrong
âCause youâre alone
I told you to leave this way
Right today

Find your ground
Itâll guide your way back home
Find your ground
Until the sun goes down

All the things you keep inside
Are pieces of yourself

Trust your heart, find yourself
And you will hold the key to liberty
