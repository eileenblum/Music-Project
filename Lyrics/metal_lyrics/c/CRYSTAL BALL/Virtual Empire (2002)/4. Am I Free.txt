[Music: Leach &amp; Sweeney]
[Lyrics: Sweeney]

Sometimes I need a sign to get the power
The sharp pain inside is killing me

Iâm waiting for my turn
It seems so unreal
I wonât take control
Just tell me Iâm wrong

I donât look back
I lost my way
No fairytale
Escape from burning hell
Yes, I can tell

Am I free?
Yes, Iâm free and I see
The door is open
I just turned the key
Am I free?
Yes, Iâm free and I see
The door is open
I just turned the key

Why canât I find the minds that made me strong?
Why canât I learn to feel whatâs right and wrong?

Too blind to see that Iâm an ignorant child
The hurt inside my heart is so hard to hide

I donât look back
I lost my way
No fairytale
Escape from burning hell
Yes, I can tell

Am I free?
Yes, Iâm free and I see
The door is open
I just turned the key
Am I free?
Yes, Iâm free and I see
The door is open
I just turned the key
