[Lyrics: Sweeney]

You stand there at the door last night
You looked at me, I knew
You kept our secret inside

Every time youâre close to me
It was like in my dreams
I thought our love was a fantasy

âCatch the dreams and donât give up tonightâ
âI touch your soulâ
Deep inside I hear your words

Look in my eyes
Youâll see thereâs no reason
For any doubts nor any lies

The time has come and you are gone
I miss the promises
And love from the shining sun

And first you said just trust in me
And now youâve changed your mind and say
That itâs better to be free

âForget the dreams and walk away from meâ
âAnd donât look backâ
But deep inside I hear your words

Look in my eyes
Youâll see thereâs no reason
For any doubts nor any lies

Look in my eyes
But now itâs too late
I cry another thousand tears

All the nights I spent with you
Canât forget the time we shared
And the pain is hard to bear
