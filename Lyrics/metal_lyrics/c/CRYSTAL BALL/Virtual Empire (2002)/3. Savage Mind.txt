[Music by Leach &amp; Sweeney]
[Lyrics by Leach]

Drifting on the streets again
I stand out in the rain
Stumbling there ainât no hold
My feet are losing ground

I canât believe the things youâve said
Forcing a mental overload
The shock is over, the pain remains
Pictures in my head

I wished that I had been the one
To save your soul
Iâd take your hand and change the world
To make it all undone

Savage mind
No one can stop me
Savage mind
Theyâll all fall down
Savage Mind
A scream of anger
Exploding in my head

Trying to leave it all
Behind a wall of lies
I canât back down calling for revenge
Theyâve got a price to pay

I wished that I had been the one
To save your soul
Iâd take your hand and change the world
To make it all undone

Savage mind
No one can stop me
Savage mind
Theyâll all fall down
Savage Mind
A scream of anger
Exploding in my head

Savage mind
No one can stop me
Savage mind
Theyâll all fall down
Savage Mind
A scream of anger
Exploding in my head

Savage mind
No one can stop me
Savage mind
Theyâll all fall down
Savage Mind
A scream of anger
Exploding in my head

It drives me nuts
My head explodes
