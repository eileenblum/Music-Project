[Music: Sardella, Leach &amp; Sweeney]
[Lyrics: Leach]

Youâre the wind beneath my wings
You are the air that I breathe
Youâre my shelter from the storm
My guarding homeland

Youâre the wave Iâm riding on
You are the water I drink
You save me from drowning in the sea
My saving ark

Weâre two of a kind
The perfect match like a corny rhyme
Is it meant to be for our love
To pass the test of time

Night and day
Night and day
No matter what may come
Iâm still in love (with you)

Youâre the light in the dark
You are the fuel to my fire
Youâre my shield from the heat
My last resort

Weâre two of a kind
The perfect match like a corny rhyme
Is it meant to be for our love
To pass the test of time

Night and day
Night and day
No matter what may come
Iâm still in love (with you)

Should maybe someday
A crunch part our way
After rain comes the sun to stay

Night and day
Night and day
No matter what may come
Iâm still in love (with you)
