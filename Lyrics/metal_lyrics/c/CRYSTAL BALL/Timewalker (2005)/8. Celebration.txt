[Music: Sweeney / Leach, Lyrics: Sweeney]

Goodbye tyranny, it was time to break free
Thereâs no pain â anymore, no more empty smiles
It was just a waste of time
So tell me that itâs done â itâs over

Canât you see the sun, it shines for everyone
Again for you and me â on and on

Celebration all over the nation
The fight for freedom and the right to defend it
Celebration all over the nation
Youâre free from fear and oppression

Nowhere quite like home, you are king on your throne
We keep the faith and independence
The sunbeams light the sky, donât let it pass you by
Youâre living your own â paradise
