[Music: Sweeney / Leach, Lyrics: Sweeney]

Lindbergh flew the plane
Through thunder, storm and rain
âSpirit of St.Louisâ was the name
There was no limit
To do what should be done
The time was right
The feeling was so strong

He took the chance
To spread his wings
To ride the heavens high
The sky was open wide

Power flight
Was the first Atlantic
Psycho ride in history

Paris was the goal tomorrow and today
3.500 miles away
We salute the hero
For now and tomorrow
Hail the victory that was won
