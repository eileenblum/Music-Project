[Music: Sweeney / Bormann, Lyrics: Sweeney, Intro by Graber]

Out of my mind - picture the scene
Sheâs alive â tonight
Need to know â will I fall or succeed, thatâs all
It turns me insane

I wish I had not been charming you up
I call to the dreams in my head
I scream out and cry for falling in love
âCause youâre not the love I can win

Sheâs like a Mozart symphony â Sheâs like a hot sweet harmony
Sheâs lika a Mozart symphony â Sheâs just vision in my memory

Broken inside â heart is on fire
Nowhere left â to hide
For so long... your shadow it haunts me... no
Donât turn me away
