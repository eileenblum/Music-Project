[Music: Sweeney / Leach, Lyrics: Leach]

Future to past, this is the march of time
Hearing the clock tick tock away
How the time screams a warning, wars scar the land
But we canât turn the tide of blood

The walk through time, the years fly by
The walk through time, God only knows why

In the golden age the glory seasons came
But we canât stop the hands of time
At the dawn of an era
Illusions were meant to last
But forever is a long and winding road

Tomorrow is gone, another change of life
Watch as the empires fade
Just like the sand â out of my hand
