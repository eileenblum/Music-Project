[Music: Sweeney / Leach, Lyrics: Sweeney]

Legions of darkness â They have killed
The fallen ones â Burn in hell
End of days â Dreams unfilled
Glory and death â The innocent fell

Again they lost the fight
Free from all lost pride
So many people died
Each day â Each night

War â and all the flames got higher
War â fallen from grace
War â and all the thieves and liars
Touched with blood â on this day

Soldiers are dead
They die on the ground
No mercy inside â To be found
Out in the field
They lost their lives
Armed with a gun
And a killer knife

Now look to the skies
The wind of change
Blowing through
Uhhh, donât be afraid to see
The dark clouds above disappear
