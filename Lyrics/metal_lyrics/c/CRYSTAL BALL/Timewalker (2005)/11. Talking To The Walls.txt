[Music: Sweeney / Leach, Lyrics: Leach]

He led life like the lonely
As he swam against the stream
Science was his best friend
As he fought the whole regime
They tried to break his will
Change his mind
They didnât want to hear the truth
They were all afraid
âCause weâre not
Center of the universe

Talking to the walls â no more
Got to have some balls standing tall
Talking to the walls â no more
Gonna make them see â theyâre all wrong

The church felt frightened
As he fought against the grain
He was torn by torture
As they promised hell and pain
They then made him recant
His iron will
They didnât want to hear it all
They were all so blind
