[Music: Sweeney / Leach / Graber, Lyrics: Sweeney]

Hey you, are you the one to make our wish come true
Stand up and shout it out, the one thing we can do
Rise up â reality show us all what we wanna see
Hear the thunder roaring near, the power of insanity

Donât deny the eye of the hurricane
The crazy ways â blown away
Itâs time for freedom days

Tear down the wall â let us see it fall
Tear down the wall â âcause we want it all

1989 â Weâre running out of time
Spokesman Mr. Schabowski, better throw away the keys
Glory - now itâs done, a hope for everyone
Rise up â reality show us all what we wanna see
