[Music: Sweeny / Leach, Lyrics: Leach]

We raised our sails
With wind in our hair
Leaving all our worries behind
Itâs a state of mind
Addicted to the rush
No longer a slave to the grind

We crossed the point of no return
The stakes are high, enjoy the ride

Sensational â weâre riding the storm
Sensational â the ultimate thrill â to go

The passionâs building up
Itâs coming our way
Adventure is what we will find
Now weâre on the move
Screaming to the sky
Chaos and madness combined

We crossed the point of no return
The stakes are high, enjoy the ride

Sensational â weâre riding the storm
Sensational â the harder we fall
Sensational â weâre riding the storm
Sensational â the ultimate thrill â to go
Sensational â weâre riding the storm
Sensational â we donât stand alone
Sensational â weâre riding the storm
Sensational â the ultimate thrill â to go
