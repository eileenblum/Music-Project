[Music: Sweeny / Leach / Matteo, Lyrics: Leach]

It was a mission
Back in â15
Flight number 19
Would not arrive
The towerâs calling
To guide them home
Instruments gone crazy
They were all alone

From the deep blue sky
They flew right

Into the eye
The eye of the storm
The great unknown
The eye of the storm
The eye of the storm

No navigation
High above the sea
Eyes turned to heaven
Would they survive
With no more power
Into the night
No more transmissions
They were out of sight
