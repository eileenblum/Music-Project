[Music: Sweeney / Leach, Lyrics: Leach]

Born in a stable â among the poor
A star showed them the way
The kings kneeled â before this child
Touching all their souls

The Judas kiss betrayed his life
Crucified for some silver

He came to change the world, he traded pain for love
He came to change the world, he tried to save us all

The not so holy wanted him to die
They tried to send out a warning
The torturers will always be cursed
His sadnes lives on today

He came to change the world

Alive â he arose â from the dead â to live forever
