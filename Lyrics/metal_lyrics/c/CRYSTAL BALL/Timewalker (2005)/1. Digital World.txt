[Music: Sweeney / Leach, Lyrics: Sweeney]

An old manâs dream
A future revelation
Creation of the new machine
Cyber screams, hard megabyting
Your eyes disolve into the screen

All the systems and all sub-routines
All replications, nothingâs what it seems

Digital world â digital dreams
Digital world â cybernetic evolution
Digital world

All we want are virtual constructions
Living in computer wastelands
Red alert and panic reactions
The virus lives inside our dreamworld
