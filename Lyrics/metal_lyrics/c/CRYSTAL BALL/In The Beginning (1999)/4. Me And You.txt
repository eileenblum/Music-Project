Couldn't keep from starein
I saw the love in your eyes
You saved me from falling
You cast the spell on my life

Is it true?
That love is blind
I feel inclined
To say so
If I knew
What's on your mind
Then maybe I'd find
Love for me and you

It was like a dream
Too good to be real
And so the story goes

It was hard to take
I came to realize
We live in different worlds

Is it true?
That love is blind
I feel inclined
To say so
If I knew
What's on your mind
Then maybe I'd find
That there is love for me and...

You can't ignore
That fact of our love

Is it true?
That love is blind
I feel inclined
To say so
If I knew
What's on your mind
Then maybe I'd find
That there is love for me

Which is true
We're two of a kind
Nothing to hide
But pure love
It's up 2 you
A tie to bind
And maybe you'll find
That there is love for me and you
