Waiting for the show tonite
Nothing can hold us down
We're standing in the light
We're ready to strike

Blazing flames of rock'n'roll
Set the world on fire
The power starts to grow
Can you feel the heat?

Fire still burns
Fire still burns
Glowing speakers and flashing lights
All systems go through night

Passion rules the game
Of fortune and fame
So if we don't turn our way
There will be a shade of gray

Blazing flames of rock'n'roll
Set the world on fire
The power starts to grow
Can you feel the heat?

Fire still burns
Fire still burns
Glowing speakers and flashing lights
All systems go through night
