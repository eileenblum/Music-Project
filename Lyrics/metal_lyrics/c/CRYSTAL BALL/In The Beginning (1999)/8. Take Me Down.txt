Can you forgive me
For all I've done
I was so untrue
But now my girl you're gone

I will be there
Wherever you go
Will you stand by my side
Is all I need to know

I was blind
Now I see
You are still my destiny
I was bad I was wrong
Now I can't go on

Take me down
You little wounded angel
Waste no time
Don't fly away in anger

Night after night
I told you tales
So many lies
My heart was cold as ice

And in my dreams
I hear your voice
Calling my name
You made my life complete

I was blind
Now I see
You are still my destiny
I was bad I was wrong
Now I can't go on
Take me down

From now on we'll go separate ways
You little wounded angel
Our lives crossed for a time

Waste no time now I pay the price
Don't fly away in anger that I've deserved
