She'll never see the light of day
She'll never join the easy way
Her life is a lie
Can you tell me why?

I never knew her real name
I never understood her game
She's a loner at night
Her eyes are red and veiled

You need pleasure and pain
There's no one to blame
Oh my baby
You feel no shame
Whilst playing your game
With a burning flame

Twilight zone
She's dying all alone
Twilight zone
She's busted on the ground

You were a prisoner of lies
You never tried to compromise
There's nowhere to hide
No one by your side

Twilight zone
Still looking for a home
Twilight zone
Is all she's never known
