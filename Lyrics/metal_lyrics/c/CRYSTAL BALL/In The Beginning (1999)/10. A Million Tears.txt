Another tyrant in this cruel world
Another torment starts again
Another place where people die
Don't ask me why

I see destruction I see tortures
I see some children crying there
I see some soldiers killing people
You know, everywhere

I won't give up
Fighting for the world, to raise my hands
For a better world with confidence

How many tears
A million tears flow away
How any tears
Praying for the pain to disappear

Forever down forever guilty
Forever captured in their lies
Forever lost â got no future
Bad blood â in their veins

I won't give up
Fighting for the world, to raise my hands
For a better world with confidence

How many tears
A million tears flow away
How any tears
Praying for the pain to disappear

I will fight against the violence
I will fight another day
