All those days
I spent with you
I thought it was love
But now I know
I played the fool
And you broke all the rules

I didn't want to say goodbye
But you left it all behind
You broke my heart, you broke my will
I feel so denied

I was so blind
I couldn't see
How damaging you were to me

Leave me alone
The smile on your face is just a show

Go away
I'm sure this life will be...
A better way

I don't need it anymore
I chucked it on the floor
Your lies were wrong
I don't belong
To you and your currawong
