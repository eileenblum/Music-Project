Far in the distance
A sign in the sky
It shows me the way
I'll be there one day

The place where you are
It seems so far
You holding the crown
The crown of your own

I knew her wretched name
And she drives me insane
Lightning is so frightnening
She's playing ucanny games

You're magic, you're magic
Your spirit is everywhere
You're magic, you're magic
There's something wrong in the air

I still pray for you
There's nothing I can do
I know that you're guilty
I know that you're bad

Another day is gone
The troubles just begun
You've wished you were dead
But you're still in my bedn
I knew her wretched name
And she drives me insane
Lightning is so frightnening
She's playing ucanny games

You're magic, you're magic
Your spirit is everywhere
You're magic, you're magic
There's something wrong in the air
