I'm running away
There's no way out
I can't escape from my reality

I saw my face
I closed my eyes
I found a light and heard the preacher say

You're leaving it
All behind
You know there's a new start
Pack your dreams
You'll find a way

Down in the promised land
You'll get another chance
You time has come today
You'll see the new world
Down â in the promised land

A poisonous rain
Is falling down
I'm waster tonight with a knife in my heart

I made a deal
With the devil tonight
But there's a voice
With the power of good
