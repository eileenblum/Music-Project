Livin' on the edge
Playing the game
All messed up
It's always the same
It seems like there's
No justice at all
Can't stop fate or
The hammer to fall

Do you believe in freedom?
Do you wanna change the world?
Make a point and stand up straight
It's time to break the chains

Lay down the law
Lay down the law
But never turn your head
You walk the streets alone

No time to loose
Or chance to fail
Be the best you can
You've gotta prevail
It's a state of mind
Like a king

Uncrowned
Leaving all behind
Dying for the sound

Do you believe in freedom?
Do you wanna change the world?
Make a point and stand up straight
It's time to break the chains

Lay down the law
Lay down the law
But never turn your back
On someone you don't know
Lay down the law
Lay down the law
But never compromise
You're the one to win
