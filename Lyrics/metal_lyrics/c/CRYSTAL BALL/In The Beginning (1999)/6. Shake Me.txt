Little girl â sweet 16
Your every schoolboys dream
Your lips are red, your legs are long
You make me loose control

Your life is full of rhythm
Let me take you to the party
Let's go and have fun
You're so cool â you drive me wild
My head is whizzing round

You're my dancing queen
Rock your ass and set me free

Shake me baby
Coz you know what I want
And I'm gonna get it
Baby, I'll be your one and only
All night long

You cross my heart, like poison darts
Feels like a cat-of-nine
Amd someday you will
Swallow me whole
Complete with me heart and soul

You're my dancing queen
Rock your ass and set me free

Shake me baby
I can't explain the reason
Coz you know what I want
For turning you away
And I'm gonna get it
May be it's love, maybe it's
Baby, I'll be you one and only
Pain, you drivin' me insane
All night long
