You were in trouble
I know your nasty ways
You sold your soul
On this dying day

The pain's reality
Do you see your destiny?
The end of the storm is coming near

You have your mission
But you'll never grow old
See your final fight
You're desperate in the cold

Your last breath is near
You're paralyzed by fear
You can't hide your pain behind your tears

What have you done?
Beware - you've reached the end

Now the time has come
And your life is over
The sky is painted black
No turning back
Now the fight is done
And the night is over
The gate is open now
Pass it - somehow

You're standing in the light
You always make it right
You take away the pain
You're burning like a flame

Just turn off your mind
And leave it all behind
Remember who you are - and get it right

What have you done?
Beware - you've reached the end

Now the time has come
And your life is over
The sky is painted black
No turning back
Now the fight is done
And the night is over
The gate is open now
Pass it - somehow
