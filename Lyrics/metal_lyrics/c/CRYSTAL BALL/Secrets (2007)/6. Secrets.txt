You're all alone
You struggle on
Looking for hate and revenge

Father's a thief
Mother's a bitch
You're always one step behind

Saw what you did and see what's going on

I know your secrets
I know your life
I know your secrets
I know your lies

Blood on your face
Tears in your eyes
You failed in every case

You raise your hands
Just to defend
That is just your independence

Saw what you did - and see what's going on

I know your secrets
I know your life
I know your secrets
I know your lies

[Spoken:]
A "hero" like you
Is searching the truth
But a beast - is rising in you
Time's running out
