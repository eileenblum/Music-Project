You must reap
What you have sown
You are standing alone

What you have done
Can't be undone
And now it's time to pay

There is no one
Hearing your call
You're lost in the night

Face the truth
You can see there's tons of proof
You're on the edge
Face the truth
You know that you're always on the loose
Your mind is killing you
Face the truth

You walk the line
Of life and death
Whether dead nor alive

You better pray
To the lord above
To forgive all your sins

There is no one
Hearing your call
You're lost in the night

Face the truth
You can see there's tons of proof
You're on the edge
Face the truth
You know that you're always on the loose
Your mind is killing you
Face the truth
