You're watching the shore
Waves pounding in
The seasons change

You're standing alone
The weight of the world
On your shoulders

You can't stop the rain
You can't stop the rain from falling

Sail your ship high across the sky
It's destiny
Spread your wings wide learn how to fly
It was meant to be

You're fighting a war
Just between you
And yourself

You're searching for more
Just to obey
The hands of faith

You can't keep the sun
You can't keep the sun from shining

Sail your ship high across the sky
It's destiny
Spread your wings wide learn how to fly
It was meant to be

Sail your ship high across the sky
It's destiny
Spread your wings wide learn how to fly
It was meant to be

Sail your ship high across the sky
It's destiny
Spread your wings wide learn how to fly
It was meant to be
