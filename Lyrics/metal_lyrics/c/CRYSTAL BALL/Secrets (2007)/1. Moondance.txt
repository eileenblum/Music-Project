Lifting off
Leaving ground
A rocket flying to the sky

Full speed ahead
On through the night
Heading into the unknown

Floating around in weightlessness
Among the lunar sky

We conquered the sea and
Climbed all the mountains
Now we're here for the moondance
We conquered the sea and
Climbed all the mountains
Now we're here for the moondance

Many miles
Above the earth
In the sea of tranquillity

Neil put his foot
Into the lunar dust
One giant leap for mankind

Floating around in weightlessness
Among the lunar sky

We conquered the sea and
Climbed all the mountains
Now we're here for the moondance
We conquered the sea and
Climbed all the mountains
Now we're here for the moondance
