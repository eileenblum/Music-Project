You can't let it be
Don't believe it
Love is not game
Or not even fate
You just have to shout
To let it all out

If you live in the past
This love won't last
No reason at all
To tear down the wall
Make up your mind
Leave it all behind

Why don't you trust?
Why don't you see?

It feel like a dream
Tonight - I'm playing a sad song - a sad melody
Feels like a dream
Tonight - in a minor key
In a minor key

You're comparing me still
Against my will
Your past lover
Is like a no other
This fight is insane
Was it all in vain?

You're telling me
Out of the blue
That I'm a liar
This is not true
I'm here to stay
Hope we'll find a way

Why don't you trust?
Why don't you see?

It feel like a dream
Tonight - I'm playing a sad song - a sad melody
Feels like a dream
Tonight - in a minor key
In a minor key
