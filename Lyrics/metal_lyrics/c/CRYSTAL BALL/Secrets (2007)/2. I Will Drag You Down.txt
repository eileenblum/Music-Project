People ask for power
Some don't need success
Some ask for independence
I'm one of those I must confess
I'll find my own direction
No matter what it takes
I can't take no hesitation

You can keep your inspiration
And your desperation
Cause I am here to win
And I will fight

I will be the thunder
And I will bring the storm
I will be the lightning
I'll be the one that drags you down
I will come to getcha

I'll drag you down

I ain't no pretender
You won't hear me complain
I never sit in silence
I just know when to leave the train
I can't stand no weakness
I'm not cryin' in the rain
I'm not askin' for forgiveness

Cause I don't need your inspiration
Don't know desperation
I am here
Not gonna hide

I will be the thunder
And I will bring the storm
I will be the lightning
I'll be the one that drags you down
I will come to getcha

I'll drag you down
