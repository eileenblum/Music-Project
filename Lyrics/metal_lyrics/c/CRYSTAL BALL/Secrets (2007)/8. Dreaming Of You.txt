Out in the cold
Out in the rain
Life goes on
It's always the same

But I gotta move on
A job's to be done
Just bills to pay
Tell you it ain't no fun

There's nothing I can do without you
Until you're back - I will dream of you, so I'll be

Dreaming of you
When I'm closing my eyes
Dreaming of you
In the still of the night
Dreaming of you
That you're here by my side
Night by night - night by night
Dreaming of you babe

Opened the door
Came into my life
Looking for more
You make me feel alive

I'm counting the hours
When you have been gone
I'll save a prayer
'cause we are one

So tell me what should I do without you
I'm happy to be with you

Dreaming of you
When I'm closing my eyes
Dreaming of you
In the still of the night
Dreaming of you
That you're here by my side
Night by night - night by night
Dreaming of you babe

I need you tonight
Your affection - your love
There's really nothing
I wouldnât do for you
