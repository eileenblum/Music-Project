A long time ago
In a foreign land
Something strange has happened

A whirlwind came
Out of the blue
A coldness with fire enfolding

The prophet saw what he couldnât understand
In his eyes it must have been God's sign
We'll never know
What he really saw on that day

On wings of fire
On wings of steel
It's descending from heaven to earth
On wings of fire
On wings of steel
The prophet couldnât believe his own eyes
On wings of fire

Out of the fire
Into the cold
Four living creatures stepped out

Every one had
Four faces and wings
They returned like flashes of lightning

The prophet saw
What he couldnât understand
What did he really see on that day

On wings of fire
On wings of steel
It's descending from heaven to earth
On wings of fire
On wings of steel
The prophet couldnât believe his own eyes
On wings of fire
