You talk 'bout me
Your word isnât worth a dime
You sneak around at night
Your love is just a crime

You're playing all the games
With so many guys
Truth is a foreign word
Another love that dies

It's not love
Your mind is in the gutter
It's not love
You're walking in the rain

Caught in the web
Of your own lies
Struggling for mercy
Panic in your eyes

You're crying out for guidance
Poor little girl
I know your secrets
You're diving for the pearls

It's not love
Your mind is in the gutter
It's not love
You're walking in the rain
It's not love
Your mind is in the gutter
It's not love
Your life is down the drain

You cheat your way
The same way like I do
I see a trace of blood
We both know that it's true

Our game is false
The smile is a just fake
But we can't have enough
What is wrong with you and me
