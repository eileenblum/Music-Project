[Bonus Track]You may not like the way I dress
Or disapprove my hair I guess
You'll never know
What it's like, what it's like

To do what you want
To be on top of your life

You pretend you're laughing
Is there a heart inside of you?
You pretend you're crying
Is pain all that you ever knew?
What do you know?

You don't settle for anything less
'Cause money rules you must confess
You'll never show
What it's like what it's like

To do what you want
To be on top of your life

You pretend you're laughing
Is there a heart inside of you?
You pretend you're crying
Is pain all that you ever knew?

Is there a heart inside of you?
Is pain all that you ever knew?
