You're walking on the edge
Scrawling in the mud
You waste your time waste your life
No matter what they say

You're staring at the stars
Walking down this road
We both have walked this way before
You just cannot ignore

You know it can't be wrong
To start it all over
So take my hand and come along

And I'll be waiting
When you feel like I do
I'll be waiting
Come back where you belong

And I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting
For you

You asked me for my time
I gave you all I had
I saved you from your evil thoughts
And the voice inside your head

It seems, you realised
Now you care what's in the inside
Inside your heart and in your mind
No secrets left to hide

You know it can't be wrong
To start it all over
So take my hand and come along

And I'll be waiting
When you feel like I do
I'll be waiting
Come back where you belong

And I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting
For you
