Mayday! - Mayday!

It is Monday morning - the same old crap again
The days are grey and empty - I'm going insane 
Like a fly I'm tangled in a web 
Every move I make seems a wrong step

I'm drifting away - Lost in quicksand
I'm going astray - Will it never end

So help me mayday - mayday
Get me out of here
Sending a mayday - mayday
I need to disappear	

I need some inspiration - get out of misery
A change of scene and company
High and lose I'm looking for salvation
Hone can I start my transformation

I'm drifting away - Lost in quicksand
I'm going astray - Will it never end

So help me mayday - mayday
Get me out of here
Sending a mayday - mayday
I need to disappear	

So help me mayday - mayday
Get me out of here
I'm sending a mayday - mayday
I need to disappear	

Mayday! - Mayday!
Get me out of here
Sending a mayday - mayday
I need to disappear	

So help me mayday - mayday
Get me out of here
I'm sending out a mayday - mayday
I need to disappear	

Mayday!
