Looking out the window
On the train of life
Rolling into the future
Waiting to arrive

Crack life open have a look around 
Lots of goodies to be found 
Each new station is a novelty 
Break out from monotony	

What is it worth all this you're hoping for 
Open the door

Liferider - find what you are looking for 
Liferider - it is time to explore
Liferider - there's gotta be something more
Liferider - deep down in your inner core

Living it up like a king uncrowned
Don't you ever lose your ground
No action hero no prodigy
Write your own biography

What is it worth all this you're hoping for 
Open the door

Liferider - find what you are looking for 
Liferider - it is time to explore
Liferider - there's gotta be something more
Liferider - deep down in your inner core

Liferider - yeah - it is time to come alive

Liferider - you're the one who will survive
Liferider - like a cat with nine lives 
Liferider - make it larger than life 
Liferider - it's time to come alive
