Since we were born
We always have been told what to do
They know only one way
But we don't accept their foolish point of view

No conventions running against the grain
We are actors in the theatre of pain

We play the leading role in this trial of life 
Performing self-control
Trust in our faith is what keeps us alive 
That is how we roll
Balls of steel - balls of steel

Breaking the chains
Straight out of conformity
Being free and easy
No one can stop us
On our way to liberty

No conventions
Running against the grain 
We are actors
In the theatre of pain

We play the leading role in this trial of life 
Performing self-control 
Trust in our faith is what keeps us alive 
That is how we roll
Balls of steel - balls of steel

We play the leading role in this trial of life...
