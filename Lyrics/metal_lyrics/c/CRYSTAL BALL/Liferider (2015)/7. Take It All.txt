I can see that you're hungry
With a taste for meat
Could it be that you want me
Another bite to eat	

One more hunter waiting for her prey
Someone's gonna get fed today
One more morsel on the buffet of life
Eaten alive no fork no knife

Come and share what's on my table now
I'll be sure to feed you well

Take it all - take it now - take the best of me
Take it all - take it now - help yourself 
Take it all - take it now - take the rest of me
Take it all - take it now - for yourself 
Take it all - take it all

The taste of pleasure handed on a plate 
Have your refill it's never too late 
I will feed you with my carnal sin 
Quench your thirst - let the feast begin

Come and share what's on my table now
I'll be sure to feed you well

Take it all - take it now - take the best of me
Take it all - take it now - help yourself 
Take it all - take it now - take the rest of me
Take it all - take it now - for yourself 
Take it all - take it all

Take it all...
