I fell into those teasing eyes
It shook me to the core
Got a taste of paradise
That left me wanting more

A yearning from the depth of me
I've never felt before
What was hiding right behind
That dark forbidden door

What is happening here
No more is all this clear to me
I don't understand
'Cause neither one of us is free

Eye to eye
Sweet temptation
I'm torn between
The truth and what I feel
Deep here inside of me
Eye to eye
No redemption
I'm in between
The guilt and where my feelings
Really want to be

I closed my eyes and tried to put
Those thoughts out of my mind
I felt you reach into my heart
Afraid of what you'd find

I tried to turn and walk away
Just kept it all behind
You shone like the brightest light
That somehow left me blind

What is happening here...

Eye to eye...
