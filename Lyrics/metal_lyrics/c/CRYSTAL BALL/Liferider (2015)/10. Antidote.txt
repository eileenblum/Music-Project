Can never give you back what you try to feed
Whatever you do you cannot give me what I need
It's in my blood - it's in my brain
A virus a deafening creed

Bless my blood - to heal my intoxication antidote
Bless my blood - help me to find my salvation

I need you - I want you - you are my antidote 
I ain't looking for a cure any longer

Be seeing you - it won't be so
The both of us are sure to know
With hearty words people lie
Ignore the pride and don't ask why
You're never gonna see - you're not sane
All you're gonna hear is my silent cry

Bless my blood - to heal my intoxication antidote
Bless my blood - help me to find my salvation

I need you - I want you - you are my antidote 
I ain't looking for a cure any longer
I need you - I want you - you are my antidote 
But why is the poison stronger

I need you - I want you - you are my antidote 
But why is the poison stronger

I need you - I want you - you are my antidote 
I ain't looking for a cure any longer
I need you - I want you - you are my antidote 
So will the poison still be stronger
