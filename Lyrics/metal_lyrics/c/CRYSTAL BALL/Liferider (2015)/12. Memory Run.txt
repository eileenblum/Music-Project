Friends, they come and go
Leaving their legacy
Here we pay them a tribute 
With this true and plain elegy

Just like the dawn sun rises 
They have enriched our lives 
And like this song surmises
Their souls survive

United here we stand 
With memories that never end 
We ride into the setting sun 
And honour them with this memory run 

When the end's coming closer 
Friends will always remain 
Now that their time is over 
Rest in peace till we meet again 

Just like the dawn sun rises
They have enriched our lives
And like this song surmises
Their souls survive

United here we stand 
With memories that never end 
We ride into the setting sun 
And honour them with this memory run 

United...
