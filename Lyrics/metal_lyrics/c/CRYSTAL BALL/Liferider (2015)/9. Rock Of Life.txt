I've been sailing the seven seas of life
I have braved the elements
I've managed to survive

I've been travelling all around the world
I've always cast the anchor
Where ever my flag unfurled

Troubled water - afraid to overturn
Seems like I've passed the point of no return
Drowning in my sorrow - in my river of pain
I will surely crack under the strain

When the storm's rolling on - you will be there
And lost at sea - you will be there
When I strayed from the course - always be there
'Cause when the water's rising high up to my neck

You are my rock of life - rock of life
Rock of life - rock of life

There were times when I felt like screaming out
I've sent an S.O.S., before I slowly came about

Sail away my ship of loneliness
Far away from home, drifting to distress

Troubled water - afraid to overturn
Seems like I've passed the point of no return
Drowning in my sorrow - in my river of pain
I will surely crack under the strain

When the storm's rolling on - you will be there
And lost at sea - you will be there
When I strayed from the course - always be there
'Cause when the water's rising high up to my neck

You are my rock of life - rock of life
Rock of life - rock of life - rock of life

When the storm's rolling on...
