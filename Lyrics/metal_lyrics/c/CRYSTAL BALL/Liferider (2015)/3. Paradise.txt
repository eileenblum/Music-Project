Drifting through the darkness
Feeling lost and down
When all else fails
Looking for a hand to hold

Doubts begin to creep
Poisoning the mind, eyes wide open
But heart and soul still blind

There's a silver lining
Way up high

Another way into paradise 
Dark shadows left behind 
Another way into paradise
Let the spirit enlighten the mind

The drive that you need 
Heaven and earth can provide
There are millions of ways 
To reach for the shiny light

There's a silver lining
Way up high
Where the stars are shining
And fill the sky

Another way into paradise, ...

Another way into paradise 
Won't turn around
Another way into paradise
Let the spirit enlighten the mind

Another way into paradise 

Another may into paradise, ...

Another way into paradise 
Won't turn around
Another way into paradise 
Faith, hope, love can be found
