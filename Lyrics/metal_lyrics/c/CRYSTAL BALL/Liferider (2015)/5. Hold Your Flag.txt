Sitting in the base camp
Put on the right shoes
Make up our minds
Which way we're gonna choose

It's a long hard and stony road
The challenge can be such a heavy load

We'll raise the stakes 
We're gonna do just what it takes 
Now the bets are off

Hold your flag high
Fill a deep blue sky
We are aiming to win
Gonna fly high
And the harder we try
We're defeating the weaker self within

We're reaching out for gold
It is worth the price
We'll push aside that fence
We're on our way to win the prize 

Touchdown we make it
We always keep the pace
In a blaze of glory
We'll finally win the race

Well raise the stake...

Hold your flag high...

On your marks
Get set
Go

Hold your flag high...
