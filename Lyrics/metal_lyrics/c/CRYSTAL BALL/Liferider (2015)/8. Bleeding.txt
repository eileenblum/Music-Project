Shadows are crawling
Crawling up my wall
Tears are falling
As I end this call

A lone candle
In my room
Its scent reminds me
Of your sweet perfume

You promised me
Your eternal love
With that ring on your hand

I don't know just what to feel
In this dream surreal
Awake but still asleep
Bleeding
Is this a love ideal
My Achilles' heel
A cut so deep
Unwounded I bleed

Love - our love is fading 
Like a rose on a grave

You swore to me
Your eternal love
With that ring now left behind

I don't know just what to feel...

Silent crying - slowly dying

I don't know just what to feel...
