From here you glisten, because this time I know you're out of reach.
So I'll let this pass.
Every dream comes undone and we are left with bitter endings.
Say nothing, or something that will give me purpose.
This temporary love reminds me of the seasons.
And these fields stretch, even in winter, longing for permanence.
