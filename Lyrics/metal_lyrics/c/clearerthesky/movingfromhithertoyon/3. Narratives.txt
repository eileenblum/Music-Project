Then the winds picked up.
The weak were knocked into the distance.
Forcing the brave into rescue.

A second blast swept the hero to his fate

Together they knew it was too late

Such strength,
Such skill.
Such fury.
And such grace

Together they knew it was too late
Standing in the moon's trajectory.

A hero
A sight to behold.

Such grace
Such fury.
And such grace.
