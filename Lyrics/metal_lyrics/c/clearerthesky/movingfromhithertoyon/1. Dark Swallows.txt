so let's set the scene
you're shot down in flames
I'll never fall for your disguise
I'll never need your sympathy

is this what becomes of what was once unity?

This is not yet concrete
Our souls have yet to part

but by now, I thought we would be:
far from firm, absolute
unable to ever return
as fate wears down this dream of resolve
