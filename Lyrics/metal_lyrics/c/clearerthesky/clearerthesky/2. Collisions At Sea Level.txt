The sun pierced the clouds and my eyes were drenched in reality
Onward through the sea of despair, I am on my knees
With no regard for the destruction in her wake she leaves

Curse the silence that broke us from one

The sun did pierce the clouds
Beneath my eyelids - your face
The sun did pierce the clouds
Your face, it never fades

With no regard for the walls she tears down
(How can I live if your face never fades)
Caught in the despair she left in her wake
Curse the silence - you'll never fade
