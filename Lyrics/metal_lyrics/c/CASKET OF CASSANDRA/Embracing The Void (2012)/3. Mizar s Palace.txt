She said there is no way out, and I replied,
"I'll find a way out of this nightmare, just stay behind."

Follow me until the end.
This is not where we pretend.

Though the others are dead, we will still carry onward.
Fears will rise, fears will rise from inside.

I cannot breathe, oh dear god,
Look what has happened to me,
I don't think that I can feel anything,
Oh dear god, what has become of me?

No! You can't take this soul.

My mind is my guidance.
Their lives are in my hands.
There is only one door out, but I hold the key.

Unlock the door.
I'll see you on the other side.

There is no way out of this cage.
Now you'll decide what order you'll die.
