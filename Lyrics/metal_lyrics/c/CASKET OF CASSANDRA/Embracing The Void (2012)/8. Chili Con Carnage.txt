Fuck you.

This is the last you'll get away with all your bullshit lies.
I'll kill the only thing you've tried so hard to keep alive.
Destroy what you've built inside.
Destroy what you fucking had: What I built for you inside.

I am the destroyed.

I followed your steps and I haven't gone anywhere.
I've never felt so cold; I've never felt so fucking alone.

You had everything and gave it all away.
Now you're falling alone into your own despair.

Show off your fake-ass smile, stuck by me for a while.
Your fucked up motives paved the way into this warm embrace.

These scars, this skin and bones are undertones to what you left behind.
These walls that hold this place; A passing phase is this state of mind.

You're fucking dead to me.

Your presence is mine.
Your actions redefine who you are and what you've become.
We are not the same.
Now we know who has changed as you strayed away.

Does the blood deter you away from the war you chose to fight?
And does love demand that you turn away from what you know is right?

Tried to become my friend, but we all knew in the end that
Stabbing backs and slitting throats was all you could afford to do for me.

Crossing these paths only leads to fear.
This is far from over you fucking whore.

And you will fall to your knees,
Beg mercy, "Please! Don't you kill me!"
