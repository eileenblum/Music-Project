And all she saw was the stars strung above, laid in azure skies.
Her torment satifies his thirst as he raised his arm to hit her once more,.
Screaming and sighing in her anguish, all that she could do was wait for an end.
She is in pain, with his cold and bloody hands,
Down came the rain.

Soon the voices ceased, with her one last dying shriek.
Down came the rain.

It washed her blood away,
But there he left her corpse to rot and decay.

From that night on, all he could feel was her last breath.
And behind every step, he left traces of her death.
He thought the blood that stained his hands had washed away with the rain.
Little did he know that this was the beginning of his pain.

My dearest love, I should have known you'd be taken from me!
The scars he carved upon her face was all that he left there to see.
Her bludgeoned bones, his markings shown! Soon enough he would be caught.
His fate is sealed and we shall close the bloody case of Sarah Scott.

Barred down his front door,
(In they came)
But he was no more,
(Such a shame)
He knew his deed was done and he would soon be found alive.
So in his masochistic pride, he chose to end his life.
Hung by the hands he used to kill his only love!

And this where the story ends.
