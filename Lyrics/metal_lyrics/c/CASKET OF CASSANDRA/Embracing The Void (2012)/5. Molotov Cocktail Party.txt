This is nothing - it's only a scratch, I can endure on my own.
Can I get some room to breathe?
I'm feeling myself coming down one slow step at a time.

Breathe in! breathe out! Breathe into me!
Just tell me you're still breathing!
Just tell me you're not bleeding!
I can see the light at the end.

Only you can make me feel alive.
Only you can take me away from here.
Just take my hand and don't you let go of me.
This is my time to live again.

No! I can't take another moment!
I will close my eyes and I will let the pain take over.
Just take me away.

So here you are.

Close your eyes, hold your hands up high.

How can you be so fucking beautiful and ugly at the same time?
