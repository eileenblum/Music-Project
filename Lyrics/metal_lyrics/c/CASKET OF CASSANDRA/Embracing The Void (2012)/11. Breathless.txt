You came to me with severed ties, discarded hope and the darkest lies.
And no one else around you could see who you really are.
You took away all hope to find the traces of your stolen mind,
And now you're all but lost.

Blaming that which lies before you for all the pain you've endured.
Constantly you've been berating the one simple pleasure of a cure to your life.

Give in to all of your anguish.
Find an escape while you can.
Tie the rope around your neck and take a leap to your end.

I've seen your motives and your closets full of skeletons.
I've seen the truth and I'm so goddamn sick of all of this.
I will not guide you, it will not come to this.

Begin your demise.
A blessing in disguise.

For the truth is just too much for you to bear.
As I watch you fall apart before my eyes,
I push your face into the wall - it's fucking lights out.

Just fucking end yourself.

I can't go on this way.
You've changed everything I've made into this shame.
So here I lie to fade away.

It's not too late for me.
