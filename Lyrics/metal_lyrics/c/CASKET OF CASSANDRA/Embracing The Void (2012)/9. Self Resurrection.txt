Leave me to rot in silence.
Leave me to rot in peace.

I'll fucking watch you burn.

You fell for my deceit.
I have your soul.

You gave away your heart for empty promises.
Cast aside was your conscience and your broken self respect.
You failed to realize the consequences for your actions,
And now you stand before us, waiting just to fall apart.

Now go into the light.
Into the darkness.
And soon you'll believe.

No, you'll never see the forest through these trees.
You'll never live to see the end of this disease,
For your time to die is now.

Everyone who stands will one day fall.
This is my reward for everything I've done.
I have failed myself; I have failed us all,
And I am prepared to die for this day.

This is my last goodnight, you are the sacrifice.

Die for all your lies,
For each you'll suffer.
And soon you'll believe.

You opened my eyes with your lies.
You do this every fucking time.

You opened my eyes with your lies,
And I live now because of you.
And I thank you for everything you put me through.
