It's tearing me apart from the inside out.
They sit and laugh as I die.
I have made a martyr of a long gone love.
Hearing the voices keeps me alive.
All the while, preparing for this to end.
A slow painful murder, (kill me now)
Iâm sinking and I cant reach the surface.
He enjoys my pain.

Laughing as I suffer at his unforgiving hand,
My insides tear from his horrific grin.

Oh, I know what you are,
You are the end of me.

This won't happen again, No not again.
(Last request: say goodbye)

Running away from the fucking pain.
