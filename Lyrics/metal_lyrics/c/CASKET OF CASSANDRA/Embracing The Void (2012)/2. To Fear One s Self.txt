Prepare the end.

It's like a force of nature that destroys my every right to judge what lies before me now.
This can't be, to know this pain is only fiction is like a sharp stab in my side.
This can't be real, no this just cannot be real.

We're sinking under this ocean of your tears.

You're gonna fall under your own weight, darling.
Don't you wait for me when you reach the bottom.
No one will sing your song, now that you are long gone.
No one will sing for you.

No you can't erase this past you've left behind.

No one will sing for you.

I've come to see that this hostility is meaningless.
If you were so righteous, it would be you preaching to them, not your men.
