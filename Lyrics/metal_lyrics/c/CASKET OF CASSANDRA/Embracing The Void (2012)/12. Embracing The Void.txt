I've become the virus destroying the doorway to hearts I've long forgotten.
I've conformed to hating the ones that loved me when I was to die alone here.
And this is so to say I gave away my only solace.
But if you take my hand and pull me out of this dead space,
I can breathe in peace again, never mind the way this all will end.
We end.

Pain redefined.
The decision's mine.

For all the things I've done.
For all the things you've done to me.
If only you could see.
Oh the irony.

Our journey has come to its end, so let's not waste time.
Trying to pretend this world was always mine.
Let's all become the animal, let's all become the criminal in this story.
Let's see how it all ends.

Falling from the ledge of conciousness, here I am.
Falling from the edge of hopelessness, here I am.

Spilling into the background, we fall into the color of our world's eyes.
Significantly and overwhelmingly, it starts to take your breath away.

I could paint the world and no one would care.
But you stayed here for me, and thank god you were there.
This love, it still binds me against my will,
As your darling eyes made the world stand still.

Watching the skies turn blue to gray,
And darkness wraps us in its arms.
I want this all to unfold.

And it's everything that you could ever hope it all to be.
Fade into the noise of everything that they all want to see.

Wishing only that the destination's better than the dream.
Still descending, mending all our hearts to spread these broken wings.

I won't let you slow me down.

Holding your life in the palm of your hand,
Tighten your grasp and breathe in once more.
