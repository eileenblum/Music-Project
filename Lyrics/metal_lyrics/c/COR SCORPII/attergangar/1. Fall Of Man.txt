[Music &amp; Lyrics: Refsnes]

Silence
A heaven scorched,
eradicates all light.
The earth swept in shadows.

The universe evolves
and centuries of knowledge are erased
No souls are left to blame

Remnants
our legacy is lost
and existence
has faded to oblivion

The cycle is completed
The world is laid to rest
A sombre and peaceful, dying place

A dream of eternity, but all I see is death
A dream of prosperity, but all I see fall of man.

A dream of eternity, but all I see is death
A dream of prosperity, but all I see fall of man.

Fragments of wisdom captured
through an endless journey.
The key to life and extinction.
Intrusion from dimensions unknown.

Left is the emptiness
and memories of life
Swept in the cleansing flames
of man's damnation

Brent er det som ein gong var.
Brent er tid og minner.
