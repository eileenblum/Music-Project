Indoctrinate
Masses blindly entranced
United in name
A seed is sown within

Disharmony
Monumental change
A light less bright
Ruptured walls of grace

All alone
Illuminated fears
Freedom obtained
Shackles fade, replaced with hate

Hear my cries
A call to arms
Unmerciful God
Vengeance and scars

I, the damned
By shattered dreams interred
Share my tears
Visions of might
Deception and lies
