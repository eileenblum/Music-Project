how loud is a voice when its words are not heard? you don't fight the system when you don't have the nerve you've run out of hope, submitted to their cause inherited a tolerance of their mindless laws a silent protest can't influence the scum behind the desk direct physical action can only bring about change shouting from the gutter, wasting your breath preaching the converted to the converted imposing false poverty to fit in with the tribe you want to free the land but you haven't got the strength to try a cry of disbelief rotting in the street a voice that goes unheard can never be believed activate
