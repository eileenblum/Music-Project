Drowning in self-hate I've found the quickest way to die The creator of my own fate freedom from a vicious lie prepared to sign it off end it in the quickest way I'm sorry for all that I've done I shall not suffer another day for some a poisoned thought for me a helpless cry I'm sickened in the mind in utopia I die now in death I'm home no need to run this time I'm free from the miserable me with that in mind I'll say goodbye...goodbye
