victimized and tortured by the uncaring man blind to their agony like typical humans vulnerable and weak this half that shares our earth helplessly screaming, breathing their last breath why must they suffer? why kill? sharpen the scalpel as we cut their flesh smearing chemical leaves a screaming bloody mess unable to speak or even blink an eye I watch them die and wish them goodbye I've seen a species scream and I've seen a species bleed I've watched the animals cry I've watched them all die suffer now
