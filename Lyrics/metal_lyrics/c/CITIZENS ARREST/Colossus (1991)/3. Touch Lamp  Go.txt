an expression of love between men and women becomes a silly game between boys and girls now a thoughtless act thats so insensitive as men and women act like children telling stories just to impress their friends I can't understand why we're so obsessed with it will it ever be more than "having" him? will it ever be more than a day at the beach? why destroy something so naturally beautiful? Touch &amp; go without care, without love, without respect for yourself or your companion a lack of understanding running in circles, you'll never be free what does it mean? nothing
