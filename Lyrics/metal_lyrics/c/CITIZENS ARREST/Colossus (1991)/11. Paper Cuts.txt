a story of love or so it seems a story of lust within the pages of a magazine a vision of love with a 36 inch chest a homemade romance in a stapled paper breast the sheets are soaked the romance is over his love is spread across his bed a story of love in pictures not words a story of sin in those sexy naked girls his vision of love is now turning to crust it's now clear to see just how "paper cuts" the book is closed true love can not be read the seduction is left rotting in his bed a dirty book of lies a mans best friend another pervert caught in the lie
