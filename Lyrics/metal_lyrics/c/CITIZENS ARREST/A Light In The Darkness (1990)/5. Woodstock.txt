Who do you think you're fooling You're not fooling anybody else You're not fooling anyone You're only making fools out of yourself You scream about change You think you've got something to say Well that may be true But you're not gonna get it across in that way It's been tried before And it didn't work then What happened to change You're making the same stupid mistakes again You're so self-righteous In solidarity with the oppressed Have you ever really been among them? No you're not special You're just like all the rest So fucking rebellious You don't even know what you're fighting for Bourgeois anarchist We're not gonna put up with your kind anymore
