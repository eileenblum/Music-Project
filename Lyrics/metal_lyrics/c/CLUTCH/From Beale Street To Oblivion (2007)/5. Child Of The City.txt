"Some say Johannes Trithemius was a magician. Others believe he disguised his science and steganography inside a magical guise as an example of its practical application. Whatever the case, it's good material for rock and roll lyrics."

Child of the city, Mother of the Earth
Baptism by firefly, pinch a parson's purse.
Queen of Cups the Joker's blade is old and dull.
Child of the City
Yet it slices us with the nicest miracles.
Babe in the Wilderness, Father of Creation,
Spinning of the wind, the gathering of nations.
Professor on the Toadstool convene your class.
Babe in the wilderness.
In absentia, please show your hands.
And your feet. Are you touched by a beast?
Wash yourself, live your life. Take the Earth as your wife.
False idol raiser, play the town.
Count up your blessings and melt it down.
Immortal Dominator. Governor of the World.
Sic semper tyrannis. The Fisher and the Pearl.
The bearer of this letter is a charlatan.
Immortal Dominator.
In absentia, please show your hands and your feet
And your feet. Are you touched by a beast?
Wash yourself, live your life. Take the Earth as your wife.
False idol raiser, play the town.
Count up your blessings and melt it down.
All your money now, kid. All your money now, kid.
All your money now, kid. All your money.
