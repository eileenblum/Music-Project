"Though it's the opening track, You Can't Stop Progress is one of the last songs we wrote for Beale Street. It is sort of a preface to the next track, Power Player. We happened to perform it one night before Power Player, and it became apparent that the two were joined at the hip. We first heard the Bad Brains 20 years ago and in this tune it's obvious that they're still influencing us."

Yes, I'll be a responsible member
of this great and bless'd society.
I've come to understand the wrongful nature
of gun ownership in the age of monarchy.
But sometimes it's just so hard
to act like the person you weren't born to be.
Felonious behavior. Countless misdemeanors.
Impersonating an officer of the law.
Bonafide man of action! How you like that?
Bonafide man of action! How you like that?
You can't stop, you can't stop progress.
You cant's stop, you can't stop, no, no, no
You can't stop, you can't stop progress.
You cant's stop, you can't stop, no, no, no.
I understand there's no victimless crimes.
That being said I feel rather victimized.
And I will seek substantial compensation.
Whether legally, legal-ish, or otherwise.
But sometimes it's such a hassle
to sit patiently outside the open gates of a loaded castle.
Felonious behavior. Countless misdemeanors.
Impersonating an officer of the law.
Bonafide man of action! How you like that?
Bonafide man of action! How you like that?
You can't stop, you can't stop progress.
You cant's stop, you can't stop, no, no, no
You can't stop, you can't stop progress.
You cant's stop, you can't stop, no, no, no.
