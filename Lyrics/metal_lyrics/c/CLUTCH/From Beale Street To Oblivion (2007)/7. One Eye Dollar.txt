"When we were touring we got in the habit of jamming Electric Worry straight into One Eye Dollar. We tried to write a new tune that would do the same trick, but nothing was as good. So we said screw it, let's just track it again. I was never happy with the lyrics on the original version, so this was a good opportunity to do some editing."

I been working, one eye dollar, by and by, Lord, by and by.
I got the plans to the Oval office, by and by, Lord, by and by.
In the inner chambers of the president
You will find no crosses only pentagrams.
1600, all the way! That's right brother, all the way!
1600, today's our day!
I been working, one eye dollar, by and by, Lord, by and by.
I got the plans in my front pocket, by and by, Lord, by and by.
I been working like a pack mule every day.
And to think that some of it ends up that way.
1600, all the way! That's right brother, all the way!
1600, today's our day!
