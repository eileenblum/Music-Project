Temptation Of Indulgence
Divides And Conquers My Mind
An Elegy For Fading Youth
Welcome To Mankind

If You Provide The Spleen
Then I'll Provide The Ideal
If I Provide A Puppet
Will You Provide The Strings?

Revel In The Glory
Of A Coming Of Age
Decades Of Suppression
Released In A Rage

Have Mercy

How Can I Seize The Day When It Is Dusk?
You Provide The Pull, And I'll Provide The Thrust
Romance Is Nothing But A Sack Of Lies
But It Is Truth Which I Have Come To Despise

Bacchanal

If I Provide The Scene
Will You Provide The Ordeal?
If I Provide A Crown
Will You Provide A Queen?
