Now All Will Be Sanctified
And Now All Will Be Purified
And Now All Will Be Rectified
And Now All Will Be Rectified

And Now You Will Be Purified

So You Writhe In The Deep Fry
Squirm Like The Earthworm
In That Mud Called Love
That You Justified
That Will Be Purified
Whether You Like It Or Not

So You Leap From The Dung Heap
Squirm Like The Earthworm
In That Mud Called Love
That You Justified
That Will Be Purified
Whether You Like It Or Not
