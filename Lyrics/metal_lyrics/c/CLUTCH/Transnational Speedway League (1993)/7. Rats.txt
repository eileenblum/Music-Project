Rats Over The Dishes
Rats Over The Dishes
Please Tell Me What The Ratties Say
Please Tell Me What The Ratties Say
Rats Over The Dishes

And God Was Certainly A Genius
To Expose This Human Weakness

Rats Over The Dishes
Please Tell Me What The Ratties Say

And The Doorway Is A Cutaway Of Flesh And Bone
Lay Me Down Upon A Bed Of Roses

And To Think That This Was Once My Home
But Now Some Sick Bastard's Pleasure Dome
They Say To Build A Better Man Trap
Will Lead The Rats To Beat A Path To Your Door

Build A Better Man Trap
And The Rats Will Beat A Path To Your Door
