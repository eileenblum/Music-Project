Rise Now My Son
You Were Suffering From A Horrible Dream
So Mend Your Ways Before They Tear You By The Seams
You're Not The First And Not The Last
So Take This Relic Of The Beloved Past

Take It Now, It's Yours, Pass It On, Preserve
This Undeniable Heritage Of Yours

So Take This Heirloom
So Take This Heirloom
So Take The Heirloom
So Take The Heirloom

But I Don't Want It
And I Don't Need It
So You Can Keep It
So You Can Keep It

I Don't Want It, I Don't Need It
Take Your Heirloom To Hell
I Will Not Fulfill Your Prophecy
Because This Heirloom, It Burns Like A Scar
The Call Denies The Branding Iron At Last

I Don't Want It
I Don't Want It
I Don't Want It
I Don't Want It
