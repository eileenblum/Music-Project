Behold The Man, A Living Example
In His Likeness Sacred Profane
Behold The Man, What I Have Done?

The Path To Hell Is Paved
With Least Resistance
But Those Less Traveled By
Shall Make A World Of Difference

Beating Myself To A Pulp
Extracting From My Skull
All Those Things I've Learned To Live With
All Those Things I've Loved
All These Things Are Killing Me
A Perpetual Fall From Grace
But The Hand That Feeds
Is The Hand That Beats Me
Fiercely In The Face

So I Will Build Myself An Effigy
No Longer Mope In Mediocre Hell

Behold The Man, A Living Example
Behold The Man, What Have I Done?
Behold The Man In His Likeness
Sacred Profane
Behold The Man, A Living Example
Behold The Man, What Have I Done?
Behold The Man In His Likeness
What Have I Done?

Effigy
Effigy
Effigy
Effigy

Behold The Man
Behold The Man

The Icons, Betrayal, And Guilt
The Icons, Betrayal, And Guilt
The Icons, Betrayal, And Filth
The Icon, What Have I Done?
