What To Do? Oh What To Do?
Africanized Killer Bees, Alabaster Deities,
Milk From Spoons, Sip Milk From Spoons.

Within The Ruins Against The Firth
The Salamander Has Given Birth.

Only Red Horse Rainbows Can Save Us.
Let Them Run Wild And Asunder.
Call The Royal Guard To Let The People In.
Flaming Arrows By Hundreds.

Pull The Bog-Man From The Peat. Stand Him Up On Both His Feet.
He Jigs And Reels, He Jigs And Reels.
Infiltrating Silver Crabs Carry A Most Scented Flag
To Their Front Lines, To Their Front Lines.

Within The Ruins Against The Firth
The Salamander Has Given Birth.

Only Red Horse Rainbows Can Save Us.
Let Them Run Wild And Asunder.
Call The Royal Guard To Let The People In.
Flaming Arrows By Hundreds.

Run To The Tower And Call Up The Magus.
If He Has Caused This We'll Tear Out His Pages,
Throw Him In Shackles And Remove His Hands.
