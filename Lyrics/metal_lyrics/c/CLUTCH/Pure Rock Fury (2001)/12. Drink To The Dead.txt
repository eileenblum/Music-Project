If Knee Deep In Catnip At The Old Ice Box,
I Recommend You Whistle And Give The Box Three Knocks.
Should You Be So Lucky To Hear Whispering,
It Is An Invitation For You To Leap In.

May You Go Marching In Three-Measure Time,
Dressed Up As Asses And Drunk To The Nines.
Swing From The Rafters Shouting Those Songs
Gone Unsung For Far Too Long.

If Boxing Your Shadow At The Wall Full Of Moss
And Antlers Approach You, Then I Am At A Loss.

May You Go Marching In Three-Measure Time
Dressed Up As Asses And Drunk To The Nines.
Swing From The Rafters Shouting Those Songs
Gone Unsung For Far Too Long.

Drink To The Dead All You Still Alive
We Shall Join Them, In Good Time.
Should You Go Crossing That Silvery Brook,
It's Best To Leap Before You Look.
Drink To The Dead All You Still Alive
We Shall Join Them, In Good Time.
Should You Go Crossing That Silvery Brook,
It's Best To Leap Before You Look.

If Surrounded By Toadstools At The Old Green Glen,
I'm Afraid There Is Little That I Can Recommend,
Save All Of Your Courage And Sincere Prayer.
And Where You Go A' Treading Take The Utmost Care.

Drink To The Dead All You Still Alive
We Shall Join Them, In Good Time.
Should You Go Crossing That Silvery Brook,
It's Best To Leap Before You Look.
Drink To The Dead All You Still Alive
We Shall Join Them, In Good Time.
Should You Go Crossing That Silvery Brook,
It's Best To Leap Before You Look.
