I Ain't Joking When I'm Telling You That While In The Yakima Digging Up Them Thunderegg Stones.
Well, We Cracked Them Wide Open, The Mountain Started Smoking And The Sky Turned The Color Of A Crow.

Fires In The Northlands,
Floods To The South.
Put The Pedal To The Metal,
And Let It All Hang Out.
Fires In The Northlands,
Floods To The South.
Put The Pedal To The Metal
And Let It All Hang Out.

The Ash Turned To Confetti, Alleluia!
Outside Them Great Tri-Cities, Alleluia!
Oh, God Showed His Great Mercy, Alleluia!
Turned Ash Into Confetti, Alleluia!

Handkerchiefs On Coughing Mouths, Running To The Full Hotels Left Us With No Other Place But Home.
And In The Distance Tail Lights Came And Went Sometimes As Eyes Of Vulcan Sorcery.

Fires In The Northlands,
Floods To The South.
Put The Pedal To The Metal,
And Let It All Hang Out.
Fires In The Northlands,
Floods To The South.
Put The Pedal To The Metal
And Let It All Hang Out.

The Ash Turned To Confetti, Alleluia!
Outside Them Great Tri-Cities, Alleluia!
Oh, God Showed His Great Mercy, Alleluia!
Turned Ash Into Confetti, Alleluia!

Maybe We'll Make It To That Rise.
Maybe We'll See Another Sun Rise.

The Ash Turned To Confetti, Alleluia!
Outside Them Great Tri-Cities, Alleluia!
Oh, God Showed His Great Mercy, Alleluia!
Turned Ash Into Confetti, Alleluia!
The Ash Turned To Confetti, Alleluia!
Outside Them Great Tri-Cities, Alleluia!
Oh, God Showed His Great Mercy, Alleluia!
Turned Ash Into Confetti, Alleluia!
