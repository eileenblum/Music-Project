Who's The Man Who Stole Fire For The People?
Who Causes Trembling In The Bones Of Evil?
Who Carved A Mountain Into A Cathedral?

I Am Immortal.

Half-Blind And Spitting Straight Into The Wind,
Down, Down, Trying To Drag Me Down.

It's All Right, I Go To Dreaming.
It's All Right, I Go To Dreaming.

In Dog Years,

The Blood Of Lions,
I, Liquefying.
I Ain't Dying.
I Am Immortal.

Who Rides The Solar Cycle With No Hands Ma?
Who Found The Ark Inside Texarkana?
Who Asks The Questions That Have No Answers?

Half-Blind And Spitting Straight Into The Wind.
Down, Down, Trying To Drag Me Down.

In Dog Years,

I Am Immortal.
I Am Immortal.
I Am Immortal.

In Dog Years,

The Blood Of Lions,
I, Liquefying.
I Ain't Dying.
I Am Immortal.
