Won't You Open Up The Border
To Rivers Running Green?
I Have Kilo Loads Of Plastic
To Trade For Pumpkin Seeds.

I Know Folks In Wichita As Well As Santa Fe,
All Veterans Of The Trade.

Open It Up.
Open It Up.
Open It.

Living For The Trade.

The Merry Wives Of Windsor
I Swapped For Cans Of Spam
While Sipping Fine Darjeeling
With An Englishman.

I Know Folks In Liverpool As Well As In Bombay,
All Veterans Of The Trade.

Open It Up.
Open It Up.
Open It.

Living For The Trade.

In A Tent On The Caravan Road You'll Find Those Things You Thought Were Gone.
Bartered For Jasmine And Silk And Furs Of Frozen Mastodons.

I Know Folks In Wichita As Well As Bombay,
All Veterans Of The Trade.
