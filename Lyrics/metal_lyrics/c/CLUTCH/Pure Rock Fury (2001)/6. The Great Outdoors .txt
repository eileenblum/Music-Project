To All You Lasses In Parnassus Swallowing Swords,
Shooting Out Fire At Us Heathen Hordes,
I Was Thinking Something Before I Began,
But Then You Done Cut Off Both Of My Hands.
Now I Do My Drinking From Bamboo Straws,
Constantly Kicking At Tarantulas.
What Was I Thinking, Move To Baltimore?...
Oh Yeah, The Great Outdoors!

Jump Into The Water.
Keel-Hauled On The Constellation.
Don't Sell My Belongings
Because You Know That I'll Be Back.

Remember When I Told You That I Was A Samurai?
Well, The Fact Of The Matter Is That Was A Lie.
There Were Some Other Things That I'D Rather Not Recall.
Y'all Can Blame It All On The Alcohol.
But You Ain't Got No Business Criticizing Me.
This Is My House And I'll Do As I Please.
What Was I Thinking, Move To Baltimore?...
Oh Yeah, The Great Outdoors!

Jump Into The Water.
Keel-Hauled On The Constellation.
Don't Sell My Belongings
Because You Know That I'll Be Back.

Move It On Over And Give Me A Slice.

If You're In The Market For Green Zucchini,
Farmer's Almanac Got The Largest Size.
Winnebago Woman What You Cooking?

Move It On Over And Give Me A Slice.

I'D Be A Richer Man Today If It Weren't For Physics.
If I Could Levitate I Would Sell Lots Of Tickets
And Maybe Do An Interview With Larry King
While Floating.

I'D Be A Richer Man Today If It Weren't For Physics.
If I Could Levitate I Would Sell Lots Of Tickets

Move It On Over And Give Me A Slice.
