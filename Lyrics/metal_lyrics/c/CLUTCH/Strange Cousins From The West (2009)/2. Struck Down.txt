Struck down by a vision of beauty
Said I was struck down by a long legged archer
Oh the city was hot, but my blood ran cold
Oh, the city went dark, keep calm and carry on.
I was a young man, only 19 years old.
I was a young man so very far away from home.

Ah she got me, struck down, right through the heart, struck down.
Ah she shot me, struck down, right through the heart, struck down.

Keep calm and carry on, reefer madness quiets the falling bomb.

I want to be an old man, damn you, von Braun.
I've been laid low by a blinding light.
I've been torn asunder by the banshee's wail.

Ah she got me, struck down, right through the heart, struck down.
Ah she shot me, struck down, right through the heart, struck down.

Keep calm and carry on, reefer madness quiets the falling bomb.

I was a young man, only 19 years old.
I was a very young man so very far away from home.
I was imprisoned by a vision of beauty.
I was struck down by the long legged archer.

Keep calm and carry on, reefer madness quiets the falling bomb.
