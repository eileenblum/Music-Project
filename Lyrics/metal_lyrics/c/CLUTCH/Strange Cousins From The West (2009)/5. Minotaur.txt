In a city of crooked alleys,
Crookeder women and wicked men.
Dim lamps in the rumor mill
Suspicious kith and unkind kin
Haruspectre General
Sleeping soldiers in the field
Below the elders conspire
To turn the merciless and massive wheel

Strange cousins from the west overstay their welcome

Locked in among skeletons
Broken hearted and damned
Sorry to have to break it to you friend
But life seldom goes exactly as we plan
Strange cousins from the west overstay their welcome
Peculiar manner and strange dress
Who will ever dare to tell them?

The city's always thriving
Hungry bellows of the Minotaur
Everyday more are arriving,
And everyday it requires more

Unexpected circumstance
We must not delay
You have all been so very very kind to us
And we will return the favor one day.
Fate is the idiot's excuse!
Freedom is the sucker's dream!
But we hope you find some measure of comfort
In considering us to be your family
Strange cousins from the west overstay their welcome
Peculiar manner and strange dress
Who will ever dare to tell them?
