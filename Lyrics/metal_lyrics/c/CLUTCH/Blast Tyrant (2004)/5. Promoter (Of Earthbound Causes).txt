Warmed Up My Motor, Swindled The Promoter
Took A Lunatic For A Ride
And A Little Voice Said Inside My Head
Rosemary Baby, I Got The Thyme

Suffering Madness And The Pharaoh's Plague
I, Akhenaten Tell You Some Other Day
No Thank You, That's Enough For Me
A Little Bit Of Ritalin Goes A Long Way

Ready To Rock If You Want To Roll
Please Step Away From The Vehicle
Ragnarok And Revolutionize
Gimme Just A Minute While I Clarify

Cooled Down My Temper, Tried To Remember
What It Was I Wasn't To Lose
And I Probably Could Were It Not For
The Beer And The Broads And The Broads And The Booze.

Hooked On Stupid, And The Whole Shebang
I Never Have Ever Felt The Same
No Thank You, That's Enough For Me
That's Prozacly Not What I Need

Ready To Rock If You Want To Roll
Please Step Away From The Vehicle
Ragnarok And Revolutionize
Gimme Just A Minute While I Clarify
