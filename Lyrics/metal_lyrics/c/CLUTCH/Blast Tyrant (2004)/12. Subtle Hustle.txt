Back Again With A Quickness, Pick It Up, Pick It Up.
Master Arithmeticness, Light It Up, Light It Up.
I Got The Heat In Both Feet, Snake Handler's Hands.
Come Back With Slickness And Do It All Again.

My Subtle Hustle, Smooth As Mother's Butter.
I Let It Ride On, I Let It Ride On.

Now I'm The Media's Darling, Pick It Up, Pick It Up.
An International Phenomenon, Light It Up, Light It Up.
I Cause Eclipses With A Wave Of The Hand.
Let Them Hang In Ellipses And Do It All Again.

My Subtle Hustle, Smooth As Mother's Butter.
I Let It Ride On, I Let It Ride On.

I Got Your Number. I Steal Your Thunder.
I Got Your Mother's Maiden Name Tattooed On My Arm.

I Drive Out Daemons. Can I Hear An Amen?
Now Say My Name.
Lay Hands On Screaming Heathens. And Do It All Again.

My Subtle Hustle, Smooth As Mother's Butter.
I Let It Ride On, I Let It Ride On.
