If It Would Disappear
If It Would Disappear

That
Which
Does
Not
Kill
You
Makes
You
Stronger

Take A Big Bite Of My Sweet Addiction
Get A Little Closer To This Sick Affliction
Truth And Consequences Led To This Conviction
Trial By Error, Another Crucifixion.

Eat It Up
Wash It Down
Hit The Deck
Kiss The Ground
The Enemy Is Within,
And She Is Your Only Friend

If It Would Disappear
