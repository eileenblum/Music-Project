I Have Suffered
For Your Sins
But Now Is When
My Fun Begins

If I Hit You,
Turn Your Cheek
You Are Righteous,
But You Are Weak

"Orgy-Porgy, Ford And Fun
Kiss The Girls And Make Them One.
Boys At One With Girls At Peace;
Orgy-Porgy Gives Release."*

American Dream
Turns To Dust
So Give Us A God
That Does Not Rust

Points Of Light
Quickly Fade
You Are Food
But You Are Saved

Juggernaut

This Is It,
We've Reached The Border
This Is It,
The New World Order.

If I Die
Before I Wake,
I Pray The Order
My Soul To Take

"Orgy-Porgy, Ford And Fun
Kiss The Girls And Make Them One.
Boys At One With Girls At Peace;
Orgy-Porgy Gives Release."*

[*Chorus excerpted from Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World"]
