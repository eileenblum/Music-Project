Impetus

Justification, The Means Are The End
Doctrine And Dogma, I Will Not Relent
This World A Garden In Need Of Such Weeding
This World A Minefield In Need Of Such Sweeping

This Ministration Without Full Consent
Fire And Brimstone, I Will Not Relent
Just As All Good Things Must Come To An End
I Will Administer As I See Fit

I Will Not Relent
I Will Not Relent
I Will Not Relent
I Am Driven

Impetus

I Am Driven
