Went To The Five And Dime,
Bought Myself A Copy Of Time,
And On The Cover Was A Woman That I Knew
When I Was Excavating In The Mountains Of Peru.
I Caught A Plane To L.I.A.
I Didn't Know What I Would Say.
Maybe She Would Like Me, I Had Lost A Lot Of Weight
Since She Had Last Seen Me In 1988.

Went To A Local Bar And Ordered A Cerveza,
Asked A Man About The Woman On The Cover,
Dijo, "Claro Que Si, Es El Presidente's Daughter."
Asked Him Where She Might Me,
"You Did Not Hear This From Me.
The Girl Is A Terrorista
En Las Montanas A Chuquibambilla."
Took A Bus Through Mountains.
Oh, My Head Was Pounding.
Got To Stay Strong And Carry On.
Got To Stay Strong, It Won't Be Long.
Arrived In The Villa Surrounded By Guerrillas.
Then My Girl Took Me In Her Arms.

She Said, "How Have You Been?
Oh, But I'll See You Again."
I Woke Up In A Coffin Underneath
An Altar To The East Of Machu Pichu.
Crawled From The Royal Tomb.
The Sun Was Bright, It Burned My Eyes.
I Knew That She Was Gone
So I Went Down To The Riverside
And I Cried.

I Went Down To The Riverside
I Went Down And I Cried.

Muchas Veces, I Don't Know If I'm Coming Or I'm Going.
Muchas Veces, I'm At A Loss As What To Do.
Muchas Veces, I Don't Know If I'm Coming Or I'm Going.
Muches Veces, I'm At A Loss As What To Do.

My Friend Said, "She's Nothing But Pain."
I Said, "I Still Love Her The Same.
All She Needs Is A Little Bit Of Love And
I'm Sure I Can Make Her Change Some."
"What About That Girl In Zaire
That You Met While A Volunteer?
She Got Quite The Education And
Quite The Pair Of Legs On Her."
"Oh, She Married An Englishman,
A Correspondent For CNN.
She Thought He Was Rather Handsome
In A Un Blue Flak Jacket.
Oh, I See Where Your Coming From,
But For Me There Is No Other One.
I Must Be On My Merry Way."

Went To The Five And Dime,
Bought Myself A Copy Of Time,
And On The Cover Was A Woman That I Knew
Claiming She Was A Kahuna Down On Oahu.
Caught A Plane To H.I.A.
The Sun Was Bright, It Burned My Eyes.
I Knew That She Was Near Because I Felt
Shivers On My Spine.
I Felt Fine.
