Won't You Come Over And Stay For A While?
Take A Seat, Have A Drink, We'd Have A Nice Time.
Turn On The TV I Believe It's Prime Time.
I'll Make You Chicken Cacciatore In Five.

There's A Woman Down At 314
Who Can't Keep The Stains On Her Kitchen Floor Clean.
And There's A Man Who's Been Knockin' On His Door
For Three Years, Or Has It Been Four?
I Don't Wanna Spend The Winter In This House All Alone.
Those Neighbors Of Mine Keep Coming On Over And Playing With My Mind.

I Would Like To Love You,
I Sure Would Treat You Right.
We Could Take The Trash Out
Every Thursday Night.

Here In My Neighborhood There Is The Strangest Thing -
Green Buckets Every Friday At Every Driveway.
They're Filled With Glasses, Plastics, And Newspapers, Too.
They Say They Recycle And Bring Them Back To You.

I Would Like To Love You,
I Sure Would Treat You Right.
We Could Take The Trash Out
Every Thursday Night.
We Could Be A Family,
Consume Many Goods.
We Could Be The Pillars
Of The Neighborhood.

Ah Babe, I'm A Real Hard Worker
With The Proper Tools, I'll Make You Anything You Yearn For.
The Barbarians Are At The Gate,
Come In Before It's Too Late.
I Have Food Enough To Last The Two Of Us About A Year.
A Thousand Cans Of Chowder And A Thousand Cans Of Beer.
I Love My Neighbors Like I Love My Own Brothers,
But Every Year They're Getting Odder And Odder.

I Would Like To Love You,
I Sure Would Treat You Right.
We Could Take The Trash Out
Every Thursday Night.
We Could Be A Family,
Consume Many Goods.
We Could Be The Pillars
Of The Neighborhood.
