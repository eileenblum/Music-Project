[Hidden Track]I graduated in 1993
I never demonstrated
Much of my ability
I was a good boy
But I was
Much too smart for my own good
Teacher said I was
Gifted and quite talented

Do have an extra quarter?
Got to get to class tomorrow
All is fair in Asbury
Make my way into Berkeley

when I was seven
I stared into the monitor
I found my best friend
Mr. Commodore 64
Daddy bought me
An International Business Machine
And with it
I compromised
National Security

Do you have an extra quarter?
Got to get to class tomorrow
All is fair in Asbury
Make my way into Berkeley
What the hell you saving for?
I'm gonna start the third world war
Hanging with the punks in the gutter I have found
Most of them are gifted and talented as well

Oh brother, could you spare a dime
If a quarter you do not have?
Been running from the marshall man
Since I broke into Norad
But its working out so well
The beggars life is swell
