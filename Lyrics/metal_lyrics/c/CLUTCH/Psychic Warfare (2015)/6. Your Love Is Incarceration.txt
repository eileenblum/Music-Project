I make my move when the tower guards are changing
Camouflage and evasion
One minute later I'm back in your paddy wagon and receiving
Reeducation!

Throw me in cuffs
No chance of parole
Back in the house
Thirty days in the hole
Segregate me from the local population
Your love is incarceration!

Hey! No justice to be had!

I'd cop a plea to larceny and public nuisance
Conspiracy and sedition
But that thing that happened in Chattanooga
I'm just asking for forgiveness

As to the charges of verbal arson
Before the court, hey, how do you plead?
As to the charges of getting down
Before the court, hey, how do you plead?
To all the charges that are laid below me
I confess I am guilty in the first degree!

I dig my way out with a plastic spoon and thimble
Hide the dirt in the cages
'Cause that thing that happened in Chattanooga
With a garden hose and Yellow Pages!
