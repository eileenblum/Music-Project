Drive us by pitchfork to caves by the sea
Atop the mountain, under cities
We are monsters
We are older than men
Yes, we are Gorgons
And we will have our revenge

Frighten their children by speaking our name
Epoch and eon, it's always the same
We are monsters
But we will no longer run
We are the Cyclops
And our time has come

This world was ours before it had ever known men
Soon it will be ours again
Grant them their tales of their forefather's glory
For soon it will be ours again

Atop the buttress the gargoyle sits
The fragile foundation crumbles to bits
We are monsters and they are but men
Behold the Colossus rises again!
