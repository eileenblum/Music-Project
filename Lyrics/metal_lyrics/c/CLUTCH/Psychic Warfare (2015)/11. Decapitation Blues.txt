The experts agreed the condition was dire
By all indications the subject should have expired
You've been banging your head like a teenaged fool
Here you've been kicked in the neck by a three legged mule

Do you care to confess to traumatic abuse?
You have an advanced case of the decapitation blues

Upon my release I had my suspicions
That they were too liberal and skillful with all the incisions
Cool heads prevailed and now it's all too clear to me
That reanimation is not what it's all cracked up to be

Now a congress of corpses is always in session
Debating the wisdom of my current direction
You've been banging your head like a teenaged fool
Here you've been kicked in the neck by a three legged mule
