First thing that I did, was buy a pack of smokes,
check in to a motel and consult my horoscope.
Sitting on the bed, with a briefcase in my hands,
patiently awaiting any word from my command

Telekinetic, dynamite
Psychic warfare is real
You better believe me brother
X-ray vision
Telekinetic prophetic dynamite
Psychic warfare is real
I know what you're thinking sister
X-ray vision

Next thing that I did, was tap out Morse code,
with a wooden nickel on the receiver on the phone.
Before I could complete it, I was quickly overtaken
by the angry spirits of Ronald and Nancy Reagan

Telekinetic, dynamite
Psychic warfare is real
You better believe me brother
X-ray vision
Telekinetic, prophetic dynamite
Psychic warfare is real
I know what you're thinking sister
X-ray vision

And on the drums, Gemini
On bass guitar, presenting, Pieces
On lead guitar, we have Aries
and on the microphone, Scorpio
Go

Last thing I remember, I was covered by the ruins,
I don't know who's to blame for that, but I know who didn't do it.
With every day that passes, it keeps on getting stranger,
but that really doesn't bother me, cause I get off on the danger.

Telekinetic, dynamite
Psychic warfare is real
You better believe me brother
X-ray vision
Telekinetic, prophetic dynamite
Psychic warfare is real
I know what you're thinking sister
X-ray vision

Telekinetic, dynamite
Psychic warfare is real
You better believe me brother
X-ray vision
t-t-t-telekinetic, prophetic dynamite
Psychic warfare is real
I know what you're thinking...
X-ray vision
