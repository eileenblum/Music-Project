Outside of Needles I nearly lost my mind
I pulled over on the shoulder
Yeah, and I was there some time
A young thing came walking
From out behind the trees
She gave me consolations
And this is what she said to me

"Firebirds! Energy Weapons!
Both of these things are interesting to me
I don't care how you get them
I need them both and I need them urgently"

Yeah, I said I can get with that
Oh, I like those things, too
But I don't own a Firebird
Perhaps this Datsun will do
Outside of the valley
Yeah, we got to overheating
She took off her sunglasses
And said I believe this bears repeating

Outside of Barstow
We got to living on the lam
Sometimes doing odd jobs
And sometimes living off the land
Yeah, things went sour
And the girl, she got to packing
When I asked her why
She said, "There are two things you are lacking."
