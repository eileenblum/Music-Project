It was the morning of All Saint's Day, '98
When that old blind dog started roaming
around the graveyard
Wouldn't have bothered me so much
Were he not walking on his hind legs
and smoking cigars

Recite my lineage and genealogy
You've got to know your history,
Son Of Virginia
Everybody's in the church believing
they're a sinner
And looking for a sign from the
True Son Of Virginia

When the storm blew over we
made our way
To the old hay wain to infiltrate
the sarcophagus
By the dim light and narrow window
we saw
The Gd's honest truth staring
right back at us

Recite my lineage and genealogy
You've got to know your history,
Son Of Virginia
Everybody's in the church believing
they're a sinner
And looking for a sign from the
True Son Of Virginia

Stare into the embers on the
first of November
And remember you were born a
True Son of Virginia

I was thrown to the ground as
my world broke asunder
truly we are living in an Age of Wonder

It was the morning of All Saint's Day, '98
When that old blind dog started
calling me associate
Wouldn't have bothered me so much
were it not for the fact
That was the truth of it

Recite my lineage and genealogy
You've got to know your history,
Son Of Virginia
Stare into the embers on the
first of November
And remember you were born a
True Son of Virginia

I was thrown to the ground as
my world broke asunder
truly we are living in an Age of Wonder
I wept like a child as
the son rose above her
Truly we are living in an Age of Wonder
