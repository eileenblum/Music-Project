Woke Up This Morning, Put On My Sunday Shoes.
Don't Ask Me Why, It's Just The Nature Of My Groove.
I Larged Down The Boulevard, Came Under Attack,
But I Rocked Them Senseless, 'Cause Honey It's Tight Like That.

I Hung A Left Down To Lemans' Avenue,
Stagger Lees Everywhere, Trying To Bring Me Doom, Oh No.
And That Old Scratch, He Tried To Purchase This Soul,
That Don't Confront Me, 'Cause I'm Never In The Need Of A Payroll.
Heck, Yeah.

Amen, Do It All Again.
Rock My Soul In The Bosom Of Abraham.
Spit Shine And A Three Piece Suit,
Good Lord I Got To Thank You 'Cause You Do It Like You Do.
Hallelujah, All The People In The Back.
Hallelujah, It's Tight Like That.
Hallelujah, All The People Up Front.
Tight Like That, Rapture, Rock.

And All You Know-It-Alls With Politic Views.
Ideals Don't Situate Themselves In His Groove.
So If You Want To Know, You Just Got To Ask.
But If You Don't Lose That Skin, You'll Never Be Tight Like That.
Watch Me Work, Yeah.

Amen, Do It All Again.
Rock My Soul In The Bosom Of Abraham.
Spit Shine And A Three Piece Suit,
Good Lord I Got To Thank You 'Cause You Do It Like You Do.
Hallelujah, All The People In The Back.
Hallelujah, It's Tight Like That.
Hallelujah, All The People Up Front.
Tight Like That, Rapture, Rock.

Don't Try To Sell Me Your New Age Guru Troubles.
'Cause I'm Already Reeling Doing That Good Time Gospel Shuffle.
And All Your Thumpings About Some Armageddon,
Ain't No Big Deal, 'Cause I Already Hang With Him.

Amen, Do It All Again.
Rock My Soul In The Bosom Of Abraham.
Spit Shine And A Three Piece Suit,
Good Lord I Got To Thank You 'Cause You Do It Like You Do.
Hallelujah, All The People In The Back.
Hallelujah, It's Tight Like That.
Hallelujah, All The People Up Front.
Tight Like That, Rapture, Rock.

Oh Yeah, Tight Like That.
Honey It's Tight Like That.
Honey It's Tight Like That.
Honey It's Tight Like That.

Can I Get A Witness For The Rock Of Ages?
