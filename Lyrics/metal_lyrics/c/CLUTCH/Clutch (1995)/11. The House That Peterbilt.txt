When I Talk Talk On The C.B. Yeah I Scare Men.
My My Tire Knockers Rock The Parking Lot Quite A Lot Yeah.
Rolled Along 40 And Roared Down 10,
Released My Cargo Around The Big Bend.
I Always Take My Time,
A Maverick Moonminer Sipping Sunshine.
Hauled Ass To Memphis, I Spoke To The Pharaoh.
He Told Me His Dreams, I Counted The Sparrows.
Steve McQueen's Got Nothing On Me,
I Take You Back West Of Pleiads.

If You Want Someone To Talk To,
Well I'm Your Man.
I've Seen It All,
And I Know Where You Live.

High Time Honey, Hell Yeah, Watcha Know, I'm Back Again, Yeah.
Roll Roll Down Highways With A Vengeance, Yeah.
I Never Ever Sweated For The Fortune And Fame Game.
Nevertheless, I'm Flying Down The Left Lane.
I Always Pay My Dues,
So Sit Your Ass Down, And I'll Show You How They Used To.

If You Want Someone To Talk To,
Well I'm Your Man.
I've Seen It All,
And I Know Where You Live.

A Preacher, A Trucker, A Highroller,
A Holy Roller Preacher Rolling Trucker.
A Preacher, A Trucker, A Highroller,
A Holy Roller Preacher Rolling Trucker.
