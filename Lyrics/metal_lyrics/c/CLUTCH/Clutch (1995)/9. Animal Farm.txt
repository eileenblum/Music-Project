Listen Up You Stinking Maggots, It Seems You Just Don't Get It.
Well I've Been Appointed To Inform You, Your Days Are Numbered.
You Would Cry, You Would Scream
If You Knew Half The Things I See.
Please, Please Just Do As I Say,
Repent And Leave Your Evil Ways.

Meanwhile....Planes Drop From The Sky,
People Disappear And Bullets Fly.
Little Grey Men Are Coming Our Way,
(Tastes Just Like Chicken, They Say.)
Actually They're All Around.
Secret Bunkers Underground.
Round 'Em Up, Skin 'Em Alive,
Rolling, Rolling, Rolling, Rawhide.

Carter Is A Clone.
Dozen Brothers 'Round The Globe.
Mj-12 Damned Us To Hell.
Scroll &amp; Key, Skull &amp; Bone.
It's Only Just Begun.
The Best Is Yet To Come.
Area 51,
The Spawn Of Babylon.

Couldn't Give A Damn About "J.F.K.",
Everything's Conspiracy.
Wouldn't Be Surprised If They Have Their Way
(Tastes Just Like Chicken, They Say.)
I Know It's Hard To Swallow.
It Must Sound Too Far Fetched.
But You Can Bet Your Bottom Dollar
I Ain't Going Like The Rest.
