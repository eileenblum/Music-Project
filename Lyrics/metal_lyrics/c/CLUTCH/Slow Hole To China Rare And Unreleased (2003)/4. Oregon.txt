Went Out The Back Of Halifax
All The Way To Virginia, Fairfax
It Wasn't Weird Enough
So I Went West To Oregon

All I, All I Wonder
While I Run
Is What's, Is What's
Next On My Agenda

I Made A Ruckus With A Succubus
Before She Knew I Was Amphibious
She Threw Her Hands Up And Started To Scream
"Man You Look Like Your Straight Outta V."

All I, All I Wonder
While I Run
Is What's, Is What's
Next On My Agenda

[Spoken:]
And So It Was That I, A Wayward Throwback To The Mesozoic, Was Enslaved As A Circus Freak To Entertain You Drunken Monkeys.
But Fate Still Had Her Twisted Sense Of Humor And She Granted Me Safe Passage To Sunny Florida, Where For Over The Past 300 Years Now I Have Been Breeding With An Unheard Of Efficiency.
And Soon My Progeny Will Rise Up And Say "Hail Draco, King Of The Dragon Men!"

I Fashion My Crown From Quetzalcoatl's Quills
Build My Palace In The Jungles Of Brazil
In The Summertime Come My Children
"For I Hail Draco, King Of Dragon Men!"
I Fashion My Crown From Quetzalcoatl's Quills
Build My Palace In The Jungles Of Brazil
In The Summertime Come My Children
"For I Hail Draco, King Of Dragon Men!"
