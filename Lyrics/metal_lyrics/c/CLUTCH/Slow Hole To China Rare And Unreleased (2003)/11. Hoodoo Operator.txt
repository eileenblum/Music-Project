Oh, I Seen Him Walkin'
On Down That Road
He Got A Broken Push Cart
With A Heavy Load
Oh, Lord Have Mercy
Upon My Wicked Soul
Ah, He Looked Right At Me
With His Eyes Of Coal

It's The Hoodoo Operator
Hoodoo Operator
Hoodoo Operator
Hoodoo Operator

Ah, He'll Sell You Liquids
To Cure That Whooping Cough
And Fine Liniments
At A Poor Man's Cost
Ah, But When Your Time Is Up Boy
And You Feel That Chill
He Will Come Softly Knocking
To Collect His Bill

It's The Hoodoo Operator
Hoodoo Operator
Hoodoo Operator
Hoodoo Operator

Oh, I Seen Him Walkin'
On Down That Road
He Got A Broken White Man
With A Heavy Load
Oh, Lord Have Mercy
Upon My Foolish Soul
It Is So Cold And Dark
Behind These Eyes Of Coal

It's The Hoodoo Operator
Hoodoo Operator
Hoodoo Operator
Hoodoo Operator

Operate
Operate
