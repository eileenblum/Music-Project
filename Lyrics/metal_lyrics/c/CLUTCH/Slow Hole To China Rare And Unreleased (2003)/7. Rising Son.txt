You Look So Good While You're Riding
On Your Pterodactyl
Storming Castles With Abandon
And Rainbows By Fistfuls
Now Lets Go Dancing Madly Backwards
While On A Sea Of Air
Everyone I Hear Is Saying
Captain Beyond Will Be There

When We Go Carelessly Careening Quickly
Screaming All The Way
Gravity Is Such A Drag
And We Will Not Obey
Carelessly Careening Quickly
Screaming All The Way
Gravity Is Such A Drag
Now We Will Have Our Way

Was It I? Or Was It Shadow?
A Trick Of Light In Play
Leaving Me To See That I Saw
The Garden From Whence We Came
But I'm Not Saying Anything
That Hasn't Been Said Before
You May Hear It Now If You Wish To
Put An Ear Against The Floor

Then We Go Carelessly Careening Quickly
Screaming All The Way
Gravity Is Such A Drag
And We Will Not Obey
Carelessly Careening Quickly
Screaming All The Way
Gravity Is Such A Drag
Now We Will Have Our Way

Now We Will Have It!

On The Heels Of Charming Dragons
There Is Snow Falling Everywhere
Sorceress, You Bring A New Sun
And We Will Soon Be There

Then We Go Carelessly Careening Quickly
Screaming All The Way
Gravity Is Such A Drag
And We Will Not Obey
Carelessly Careening Quickly
Screaming All The Way
Gravity Is Such A Drag
Now We Will Have Our Way

Now We Will Have It!
