Blackjack Booted Demons
Have Surrounded My Home
Got Dogs And 'Copters
And Keep Ringing My Phone

Well I Don't Know If I'm Coming Or Going
If It's Them Or Me
Oh, But One Things For Certain
Willie Nelson Only Smokes The Killer Weed

Now They're Breaking My Windows
Banging On My Doors
Got Me Down And Hog-Tied
Rifling Through My Drawers
Boss Demon Tells Me
Oh How He Would Like To Kill Me
Wait A Minute Tough Guy
My Disease Does That For Free

Well I Don't Know If I'm Coming Or Going
If It's Them Or Me
Oh, But One Things For Certain
Willie Nelson Only Smokes The Killer Weed
Well I Don't Know If I'm Coming Or Going
If It's Them Or Me
Oh, But One Things For Certain
Willie Nelson Only Smokes The Greenest Green
Well I Don't Know If I'm Coming Or Going
If It's Them Or Me
Oh, But One Things For Certain
Willie Nelson Only Smokes The Killer Weed
