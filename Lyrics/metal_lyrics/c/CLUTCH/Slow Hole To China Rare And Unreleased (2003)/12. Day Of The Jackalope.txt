Well, My Senses Are Sharpened
I'm Half In The Bag
I Got A Cheshire Smile And
A Five Cent Rag.

Day Of The Jackalope

Abandon All Ye Faithful
Abandon All Ye Hope
Abandon All Ye Faithful
It's The Day Of The Jackalope

Well, I Heard About Your Problems
With Your Old Man
Well, He's A Non-Issue
As Fast As I Can

Day Of The Jackalope

Abandon All Ye People
Abandon All Ye Hope
Abandon All Ye People
It's The Day Of The Jackalope

Well, The Leaves Blow In Circles
In My Footsteps
Like The Mouth Of A River
I Have No Regrets

Day Of The Jackalope

Abandon All Ye People
Abandon All Ye Hope
Abandon All Ye People
It's The Day Of The Jackalope
