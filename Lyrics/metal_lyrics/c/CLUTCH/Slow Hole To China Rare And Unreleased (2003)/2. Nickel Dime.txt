They Landed In Manhattan
With Rifles And Hatchets
Stinking Like The Living Dead
Eatin' Local Fauna
Like There Wasn't A Tomorrow
As They Fed How It Bled, How It Bled

Sacajawea Is Gettin' Meager
Nickel Dime, Nickel Dime, Nickel Dime
It's Such A Long Road That We Travel
Nickel Dime, Nickel Dime, Nickel Dime

Causin' More Commotion
With That Steam Locomotion
On The Quiet Country Mile
Blisters By The Fistfuls
'Til The Foreman Blows The Whistle
And Drinkin' Whiskey All The While

Sacajawea Is Gettin' Meager
Nickel Dime, Nickel Dime, Nickel Dime
It's Such A Long Road That We Travel
Nickel Dime, Nickel Dime

Get Up On The Chuck Wagon
If Your Feet Are Draggin'
Get Up On The Chuck Wagon
If Your Feet Are Draggin'
Get Up On The Chuck Wagon
If Your Feet Are Draggin'-Yeah!

Well They Landed On Europa
And It's Colder Than Dakota
But They Took The Bull By The Horns
For The Frozen Ocean
Foreman Has Himself The Notion
"This Ain't Nothing We Ain't Done Before!"

Sacajawea Is Gettin' Meager
Nickel Dime, Nickel Dime, Nickel Dime
It's Such A Long Road That We Travel
Nickel Dime, Nickel Dime, Nickel Dime

Sacajawea Is Gettin' Meager
Nickel Dime, Nickel Dime, Nickel Dime
It's Such A Long Road That We Travel
Nickel Dime, Nickel Dime
