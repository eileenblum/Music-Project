You've Got An Easy Breezy Wind At Your Back
Most Of The Time
If You Do Not Understand Very Few Do
So Don't Feel Bad

Easy Breezy Beautiful Colored World
I'm In Love With You
R-O-Y-G-B-I-V
Your Colors Are A Comedy

Woman Waiting For Dawn
After The Deer Are Gone
Dandelions Holding Dew
As Indigo Brightens To Blue

You've Got An Easy Breezy Wind At Your Back
Most Of The Time
If You Do Not Understand Very Few Do
So Don't Feel Bad

Easy Breezy Beautiful Colored World
I'm In Love With You
