Dig A Slow Hole To China
Blacker Than A Miner
No Turn Un-Stoned I Trample
Hold My Candle's Handle

Mama Always Said
"You Better Come Home"
Stuck In The Mud
Dug A Slow Hole

My Blue Cow
Gotta Get Her Back Here Somehow
My Brown Bag
Never Gonna Guess What I Have

Mama Always Said
"You Better Come Home"
Stuck In The Mud
Dug A Slow Hole

If It's Too Shallow Then Dig It More Deep
If It's Too Narrow Then Dig It More Wide
If You See A Point Of Light
Shake Hands With The Other Side
If It's Too Shallow Then Dig It More Deep
If It's Too Narrow Then Dig It More Wide
If You See The Point Of Light
Shake Hands With The Other Side

A Lighthouse In Kentucky
Oh I Should Be So Lucky
Sell Fill Dirt To The Groundlings
And Water To The Drowning

Mama Always Said
"You Better Come Home"
Stuck In The Mud
Dug A Slow Hole
