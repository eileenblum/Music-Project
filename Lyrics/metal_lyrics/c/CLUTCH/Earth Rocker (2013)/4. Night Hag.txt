[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]Neither maiden, nor mother
No maiden, no mother, no crone
She's working on some other angle
But what that is I don't know
Is it vengeance, damnation,
Madness, folly, or jest?
She's looking like the independent woman
Motivated to give you no rest

The night hag doubles down
Yes she does
Under pressure, under pressure
The night hag's working overtime
Yes she do
Under pressure, under pressure

Neither book, nor bottle
No book, no bottle, no pill
Her gripping won't be broken
And her grinning will break your will
I tell ya, sister Lilith,
The shady lady got to take a break
Relentless soul crusher
Give me mercy for mercy's sake

The night hag doubles down
Yes she does
Under pressure, under pressure
The night hag's working overtime
Yes she do
Under pressure, under pressure

Tinnitus, cold sweat
Crime light, sun rise creep
Maybe tomorrow
There'll be a decent day's worth of sleep
