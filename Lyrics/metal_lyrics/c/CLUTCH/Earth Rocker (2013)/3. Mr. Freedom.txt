Phantoms of the second civil war
You gather them around
And every time you open up your mouth,
A loud of horseshit comes flying right back out
Flying right back out

Mr. Freedom big time talker, oh but thank you very much but no
Mr. Freedom big time talker, oh but thank you very much but no

Serious business on your lapel
Let the people, know how you feel
And every bumper sticker on the back of your car
Makes you feel a little more real,
A little more real

Mr. Freedom big time talker, oh but thank you very much but no
Mr. Freedom big time talker, oh but thank you BUT NO!

I bet you would like nothing better
Than for the shit to hit the fan
And from the safety of your arm chair,
Probably there just glad that no one else but you can possibly understand

Mr. Freedom big time talker, oh but thank you very much but no
Mr. Freedom big time talker, oh but thank you very much but no

Thanks for thinking of you

Mr. Freedom big time talker, oh but thank you very much but no
Mr. Freedom big time talker, oh but thank you very much but no

Thatâs mighty kind of you

Mr. Freedom big time talker, oh but thank you very muchâ¦but no
