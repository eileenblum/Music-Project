Ratted out in Hades
Forced to return
to Rockville with nothing but a rucksack
Hard lesson learned

Foul council of leeches
what silence and bedlam
take refuge and a dagger to the bites
Then suck out the venom

oh Isabella your ship's run aground
kneel at the sword, scream at the clouds
oh Isabella there's smoke on the wind
jaguar and fever have taken your men

running on the tight rope
Woven by spider
while the canyon teeming with shoppers
Grows wider and wider
what demons possessing
the clock and the compass?
surrender run headlong to the void
the reptile's among us!

oh Isabella your ship's run aground
kneel at the sword, scream at the clouds
oh Isabella there's smoke on the wind
jaguar and fever have taken your men

Chained to the ox cart
With a chest full of arrows
the villagers are burdened with cedar
by back and by barrow
Scrub brush from the wasteland
Snake in a tree
remember when they throw the torches in
breathe breathe breathe

oh Isabella your ship's run aground
kneel at the sword, scream at the clouds
oh Isabella there's smoke on the wind
jaguar and fever have taken your men
oh Isabella your ship's run aground
kneel at the sword, scream at the clouds
oh Isabella there's smoke on the wind
jaguar and fever have taken your men
