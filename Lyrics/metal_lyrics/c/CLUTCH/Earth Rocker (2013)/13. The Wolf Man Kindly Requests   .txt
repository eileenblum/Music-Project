All right!

You wanna know my political persuasion?
Well, sugar, I howl at the moon
At the moon - can you dig it?

Would you like some more information?
ThereÂ´s a buzzkiller in the room
In the room - can you dig it?

PartyÂ´s over you all gotta go
The wolfman is coming out
PartyÂ´s over you all gotta go
The sooner the better
The wolfman is coming out

Let me tell you about my strategy
I sense my fire?
Drop me again, drop me again -
I think you know what IÂ´m talking about!

Yeah!

Your ma told you not to come but youÂ´re here to find out
Girl you shoudÂ´ve listened
Your pa bid you not to come but youÂ´re here to find out
Well, now you know!
Well, now you know!

I swear itÂ´s not you - I promise itÂ´s me
When the sun goes down - I tend to lunacy?
I swear itÂ´s not you - I promise itÂ´s me
When the sun goes down - I tend to lunacy?

Yeah!

So many people tell me my mind is a ghetto
Obviously theyÂ´ve been gentrified
Gentrified - and I got no time for that!
