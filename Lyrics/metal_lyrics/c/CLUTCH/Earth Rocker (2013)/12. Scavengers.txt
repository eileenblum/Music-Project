[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]Behind the surgeon's tent
Muzzles at the door
Wait for the scraps
Growl for more
Under the shadow
Talon and threat
The crown of creation
Victim of fleeces
And ichor up to his neck

So say the chorus of predator drones
Cower as savages, fight over bones
Campfires cool under violet skies
One by one the scavengers rise

The trenches are filled
Stones are laid
The ledger runs black
The wagon man is paid
Outside the surgeon's tent
There's a look in their eyes
And the crown of creation
Is more than happy to oblige

So say the chorus of predator drones
Cower as savages, fight over bones
Campfires cool under violet skies
One by one the scavengers rise

Will you accompany me to Manassas and watch the show?
Perch on the picket, stretch out our wings, watch the whole thing unfold?
See how they leave their standards and run with pieces of country and gods?
When they are dust it's just between us, the shovel, the vulture, the dogs.
