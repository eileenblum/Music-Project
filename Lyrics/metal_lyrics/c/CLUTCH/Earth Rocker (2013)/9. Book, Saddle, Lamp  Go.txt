I may not got a lot of money
But I got self-esteem
And in the golden age of travel
Thatâs really all you need
I know Iâm ugly, honey
But look where Iâm coming from
I got a pony down state
And that pony born to run

Book, saddle and go,
Hey, thatâs the name of the game
Book, saddle and go
Canned heat, thatâs the name of the game

They call me the robber,
Highwayman
Donât wanna hurt nobody
Just doing what I can
The galley after hours
Man the captain just wonât listen
âIf you donât turn this boat around,
Iâm gonna kick the damn doors inâ

Book, saddle and go,
Hey, thatâs the name of the game
Book, saddle and go
Canned heat, thatâs the name of the game

Pinkerton man, murdering bastard
Iâm gonna get even, get even with you
Get even with you

Pinkerton man, murdering bastard
Iâm gonna get even, get even with you
Get even with you

You can take that my violin
And play it all you please
For at this time tomorrow
Well itâll be of no use to me
I know theyâre gonna hang me
Tomorrow Iâll be dead
Though I never even harmed a hair
On anybodyâs head.

Book, saddle and go,
Hey, thatâs the name of the game
Book, saddle and go
Canned heat, thatâs the name of the game

Pinkerton man, murdering bastard
Iâm gonna get even, get even with you
Get even with you

Pinkerton man, you murdering bastard
Iâm gonna get even, get even with you
Get even with you

Pinkerton man, murdering bastard
Iâm gonna get even, get even with you
Get even with you
