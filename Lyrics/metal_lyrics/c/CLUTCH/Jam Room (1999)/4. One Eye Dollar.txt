I Been Working, One Eye Dollar,
Bye And Bye, Lord, Bye And Bye.
I Been Working, One Eye Dollar,
Bye And Bye, Lord, Bye And Bye.

I Got The Plans To The Oval Office
Bye And Bye, Lord, Bye And Bye.
I Got The Plans In My Front Pocket,
Bye And Bye, Lord, Bye And Bye.

In The Inner Chambers Of The President
You Will Find No Crosses, Only Pentagrams
Beelzebub And Business Suits On The Hot Line, All Right.

I Been Working, One Eye Dollar,
Bye And Bye, Lord, Bye And Bye.
I Been Working, One Eye Dollar,
Bye And Bye, Lord, Bye And Bye.
I Been Working Like A Pack Mule Every Day

And To Think That Some Of It Ends Up That Way.
