As Through A Glass Darkly You Seek Yourself,
But The Light Grows Weak While Under Yggdrasil.
A Basket Of Eggs May You Count Your Days.
Though Your Gut Lies Filled, Only Shells Remain.

I Can Tell You've Been Drinking By The Scent Of Your Breath.
Another Little Sip, A Bit Deeper In Debt.
You Can Rest Your Head In Your Wrinkled Hands.
But When You Awake, You're In Another Land.

In Fields Of Green Rolling On Endlessly
You Find A Fallen Nest Where There Is No Tree.
Mark The Brown Furred Hound Tied To The Mandrake Root.
Dare You Carve A Face In That Virtue Food?

I Can Tell What You're Thinking. I See It Everyday.
I'll Help You With Your Coat, See You On Your Way.
Sure You Want To Go Walking On A Night Like This?
Look, There Goes Another One Now. One Day I Swear They Will Not Miss.

As Through A Glass Darkly You Seek Yourself,
But The Light Grows Weak While Under Yggdrasil.
A Basket Of Eggs May You Count Your Days.
Though Your Gut Lies Filled, Only Shells Remain.
