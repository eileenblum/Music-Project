Sun Eyed Dandelion,
Seen You Garden Gnomes Gone Pass By?
Small One Wear A Pointy Red Hat.
The Big One He Just That He Real Fat.

If You See Them Please Tell Them Without Delay,
"You Taked My Saffron Now You Got To Pay!"

Sunned Dandelion,
You Say They Got An Airtight Alibi?
Then how'd They Get Themselves Them Diamond Rings?
You Know Well No Gnomes Don't Make. The Good Money.

If You See Them Please Tell Them Without Delay,
"You Taked My Saffron, Now You Got To Pay."

Sun Eyed, What Now Hey Hey Hey Your Hair Is Turning Gray.
Is There Something That You Need To Say?
Suspect, You're Looking Through And Through.
I'D Take To The Wind If I Was You.

Good Bye Saffron, Know That You Did Good By Me.
'Till Wicked Weeded Wild In My Garden.
