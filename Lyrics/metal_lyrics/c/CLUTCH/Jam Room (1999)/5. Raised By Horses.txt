I Was Eating Dinner At The Table With People From The Music Industry.
They Asked Me If I Liked It In "The City." I Said I Liked It Better In The Country.
The Label Representative Asked Me What About It Most Appealed To Me.
"I Love To Listen To The Yellowhammer Singing 'A Little Bit Of Bread And No Cheese'."

Then I Commenced To Do A Tap Dance On Eggplant Parmesan Before Their Eyes.
Guided By Voices, Whole Bag Of Tricks. Raised By Druids And Horses.

(Then I Told Them):

"Never Underestimate The Power Of Love. You Dig My New Horseshoes?
Never Underestimate The Power Of Love."

"Come Here Quickly He's Lost His Mind!"

"Frightened? Well I'm Not Surprised, You've Never Seen The Likes Of Me.
Check It, I Want A Big Fat Advance And My Alfalfa Free!"

"Come Here Quickly He's Lost His Mind!"

The Manager Removed From The Restaurant. A Crowd Got To Gathering Around.
I Said, "You Can Throw A Man Out On His Ear, But You Can't Keep A Good Horse Down!"
Mounted Police Sprung To Action. Never Cut Me Any Bit Of Slack.
But I Wasn't Going Anywhere 'Til They Got Off My Brother's Back.
