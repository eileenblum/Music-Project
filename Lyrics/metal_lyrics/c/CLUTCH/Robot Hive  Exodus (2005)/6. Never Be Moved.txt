I know we came here to get our good times on,
Hold the whole world in our hand and greet the dawn with open arms.
So make a contribution if you have been amused
But before we depart my brothers and sisters I have some heavy news.

Oh how it breaks my heart this photograph.
Several in the ministry practice a fuzzy math.
And some of us wear the robes of the righteous
Are a little more next of kin
To the Sleestak, the wicked one who makes a meal of our sins.

Ain't no telling how much longer but we will, we will never be moved.
Ain't no telling how much longer but we will, we will never be moved.

Woe be the architect of our city, cruel leveler, the hillock strangler.
Bold pusher of the cold bone index
Through the knotted bowels of the old alleyways.
Read the future a false haruspex.
Recall how he coaxed us out of the green plains.
All of us, dumb eyed at the sheer number. So long ago it does not matter.
Woe be architect in his slumber, for the Watcher never sleeps.
And on that day there will be rejoicing and dancing streets.

Ain't no telling how much longer but we will, we will never be moved.
Ain't no telling how much longer but we will, we will never be moved.

Hey hey hey hey
Get your evolution on.
Hey hey hey hey
Get your evolution on.

Good St. Charles Darwin wrote his gospel down
So keep your eyes turned to the sky and your ears down to the ground.

Hey hey hey hey
Get your evolution on.
Hey hey hey hey
Get your evolution on.

Ain't no telling (Ain't no telling)
How much longer (how much longer)
But we will, we will never be moved.
Ain't no telling (Ain't no telling)
How much longer (how much longer)
But we will, we will never be moved.
Ain't no telling (Ain't no telling)
How much longer (how much longer)
But we will, we will never be moved.
Ain't no telling (Ain't no telling)
How much longer (how much longer)
But we will, we will never be moved.
