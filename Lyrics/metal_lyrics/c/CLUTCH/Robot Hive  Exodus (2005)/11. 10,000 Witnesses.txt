(Hey ah-ha-ha-ha) [10x]

After defying the grip of the hangman's noose
And recovering my cognizance,
Spun the compass North by Northwest
And took liberty out for a long slow dance.
Took a good look around, what did I see?
A big red tent and people coming in like the tide of the sea.
I ducked in to catch the shade, Preacher jump up all ablaze.

"They say this year rock is coming back, Jack.
White gnashing teeth like wolves in the pack.
Carnivorous, no mercy hon.
There's plenty here for everyone so come get you some!"

(Hey ah ha ha ha)
(Hey ah ha ha ha)
(Hey ah ha ha ha)
(Hey ah ha ha ha)

10,000 witnesses,
(Hey ah-ha-ha-ha)
Show 'em how it's done, son.
(Hey ah-ha-ha-ha)
Fist full of cottonmouth,
(Hey ah-ha-ha-ha)
Rock that podium.
(Hey ah-ha-ha-ha)
Walk on the ashes,
(Hey ah-ha-ha-ha)
No half stepping, kid.
(Hey ah-ha-ha-ha)
Their fans are flashing
(Hey ah-ha-ha-ha)
In expectation.
(Hey ah-ha-ha-ha)

All right now!
All right now!
All right now!
All right All right All right All right

"They say this year rock is coming back, Jack.
White gnashing teeth like wolves in the pack.
Carnivorous, no mercy son.
There's plenty here for everyone so come get you some!"

Living on the lamb and all cut loose,
Number of the Saints march on in.
Gonna find my executioners
And show them exactly what it means to live.

10,000 witnesses,
