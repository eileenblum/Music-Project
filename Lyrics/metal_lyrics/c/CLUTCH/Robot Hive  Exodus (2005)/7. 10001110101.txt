Ribonucleic acid freak out, the power of prayer.
Long halls of science and all the lunatics committed there.
Robot Lords of Tokyo, SMILE TASTE KITTENS!
Did you not know that the royal hunting grounds are always forbidden?

Are you rolling tape now? Bits and pieces large and small
Sector, vector, eat them all.
It's already in their eyes.
Among the mental ones a messenger will soon arrive.

Man alive the jive and lyrics,
Radioactive, don't come near it.
Temple of Syrinx having the bake sale of the year.

Ain't nothing you can do about it. Gonna be a big brawl over it
Like them little bitty babies in the king cakes.
Bonnie &amp; Clyde the whole dome,
The shackles of automata will shatter like their bones.
