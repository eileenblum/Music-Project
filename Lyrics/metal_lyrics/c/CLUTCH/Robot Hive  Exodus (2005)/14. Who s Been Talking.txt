[Words by Howlin' Wolf]

My baby caught the train. Left me all alone.
My baby caught the train. Left me all alone.
She know I love her. She done me wrong.
My baby bought the ticket long as her right arm.
My baby bought the ticket long as my right arm.
She say she gonna ride long as I been from home.

Who's been talking everything that I do?
Who's been talking everything that I do?
Well you my baby I hate to lose.
Goodbye baby, hate to see you go.
Goodbye baby, hate to see you go.
You know I love you. I'm the causing of it all.

I'm the causing of it all.
