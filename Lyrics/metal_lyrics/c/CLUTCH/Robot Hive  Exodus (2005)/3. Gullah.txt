Ain't no doubt Jesus sees us
Acting foolishly on American Band Stand
Agog with spastic baskets, the latest fashions
Here I am Here I am Here I am
But that chin music sound, oh how it drown
Gotta shake 'em on down

Scaling up the heights of folly. (Na na na, na na na)
Scaling up the heights of folly. (Na na na, na na na)

Kill the lights and bring the music on down. Everybody be quiet.
Sudden movement on the Serengeti, get ready Freddy,
Opportunity only knocks once.
Never mind the fat ones, just go for the slow ones
See how they run see how they run see how they run.

While you busy lighting roman candles on the yellow cake
They shook you on down.
When the rain start falling, boatman calling,
Shake 'em on down.

The flood receding, the mountain appears,
Send out the black bird, send out the dove.

You Babel rabble-rousers
In polyester trousers
Big bright cities.
Ain't no doubt Vishnu missed you, then Kali kissed you,
Better get busy. Better get busy. Better get busy.

Days get shorter, air gets colder,
Tune on in to the N.O.A.A. radio

Scaling up the heights of folly.(yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah)
Scaling up the heights of folly. (na na na, na na na)

While you busy lighting roman candles on the yellow cake
They shook you on down.
When the rain start falling, boatman calling,
Shake 'em on down.
While you busy lighting roman candles on the yellow cake
They shook you on down.
When the rain start falling, boatman calling,
Shake 'em on down.

The flood receding, the mountain appears,
Send out the black bird, send out the dove.
