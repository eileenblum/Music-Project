Have you ever heard this music ?
Dream's music, that you still hear as you are awaking
It makes you so happy that you can't refrain
From going back close to it

I can see doubts in your eyes
But you can have your own way
You don't believe in other skies
I know I'll return down again

When the notes take you away
Your shadow disappears
But you cross the Cold River
You're on your way to meet serenity

I can see doubts in your eyes
But you can have your own way
You don't believe in other skies
I know I'll return down again

It's a great journey that I offer you
I know you don't have any reason to believe me...
Never mind!...
Only my satisfaction...
Never mind!
