Born under a rain of flowers
I can't understand this world
I only know the nature's rhythm:
The sweet bird's song in the morning
The breath of air on my face
Oh no! I won't accept what you present me
Keep your advance!
Keep your concrete!

And even if you run...
Even if you win...
You're not stronger than me!

Maybe it's easier
For you to forget
Sound sensations
You can carry on
To destroy
The most beautiful
