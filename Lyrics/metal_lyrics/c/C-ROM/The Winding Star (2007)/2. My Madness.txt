You say that I'm the only one
You say you are for me
You say that I'm a part of you
I just can heave a sigh

Tell me we are white angels in the grey sky
We want to set every pain on fire... it's like a promise
Tell me you're still the same
I can't believe in your weakness

Accept my madness, I content myself with your lies
Harmless words are the ones that I can hear
Accept my madness, you could be really surprised
Lovely words are the ones that I can hear

I want to hear that yesterday was only a foretaste of tomorrow
Remember, you told about a "perfect life"
So you don't have to looking for something else
I'm here, but you run without me

Come into my madness, I'll forget all your lies
Harmless words are the ones...
Come into my madness, you will be really surprised
Lovely words are the ones that I can hear
