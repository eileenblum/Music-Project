The wind is whistling in my ears
Yet my hood protects me
Warmth's spreading all over my body
Let me share it, let me free you this very night

Oh friends, believe me
Come, come follow me
Once stranded just like you
I am now changed

White snow around us, stained by our steps only
Keep your eyes on me
My purple cloak will show you the way to star light
My promise

Wander no more!
Heed my steps!

Friends, believe me
Come, come follow me
Once stranded just like you
I am now changed
Forget your pain!
I am now changed
Embrace the light!
