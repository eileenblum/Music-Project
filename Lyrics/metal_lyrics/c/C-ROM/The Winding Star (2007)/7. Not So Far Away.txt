Another wasted day, such a mess with my life
Can't stand them, staring at me scornfully
It has to stop, it has to change

Not so far away
What a pleasant vision
He is appearing in a streak of light

I drew with blue ink
A star on her shoulder

At last, my deliverance
Come to make me breath again
Catch me, hold me, never let me drown!

Tender finger tips trace on my shoulder
I belong to him
A winding star is blooming

I drew with blue ink
A star on her shoulder

Never felt this way before
Feel safe, feel free
I touch my shoulder with pride
I touch my shoulder with pride
