My mind's driven me to this fun-fair where I feel bad
I don't understand why the children're laughing. Here, a clown
All dressed in black and white, whith a grey nose. There, torn ribbons
Within faded garlands, static crowd and â up!
Pink balloons

As I'm walking through the garden of darkness, glowing bright
Black tears roll down my cheeks into my hands
Freezing deep in my heart

A gloomy melody from this sad wedding catches my ear
The bride in a dull gown ignores silent guests and
Sunflowers

As I'm walking through the garden of darkness, glowing bright
Black tears roll down my cheeks into my hands
Freezing deep in my heart
What my eyes won't reveal, my mind makes me feel
When my eyes can't see, my mind brings me back to me

All dressed in black and white
Faded garlands
Dull gown, silent guests
Pink! Blue! Yellow slivers!
