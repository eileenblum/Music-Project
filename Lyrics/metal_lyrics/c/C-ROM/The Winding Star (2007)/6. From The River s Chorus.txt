Now is the great day
My long dress is ready
I'm gathering wild flowers
And adorning my hair
Splashing myself with rose water

If I could reach this shining Cold River
Pain would stay away for ever

I close my eyes
As I'm twirling on the grass
Dew's tickling my bare feet
I know they're waiting for me
For choruses have melt into one
Walking, my voice joins my kinsmen's

They're leading me to this shining Cold River
Pain could stay away for ever

Together we're crossing the shining Cold River
Pain could stay away for ever

Now, I've found this shining Cold River
Pain will stay away for ever
