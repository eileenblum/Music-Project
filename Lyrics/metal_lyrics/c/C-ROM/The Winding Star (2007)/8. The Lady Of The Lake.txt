First, I walked a lot
I'd no feelings no fears
But when I saw the light
Something happened to me:

Above us, a heavy sky
Under, a humid grass
Were you in the air
You the Lady of the Lake?

Could I ever climb these slick stones?
Could I ever climb these slick stones?

You have the chance to sleep
In a wonderful world
I think that you just wanted
To share it with me

Only for a moment
Just like a present
But you don't know how much
It's hard to meet reality

Dear Lady of the Lake
Please listen to my prayer
Don't forget this lost soulâ¦
