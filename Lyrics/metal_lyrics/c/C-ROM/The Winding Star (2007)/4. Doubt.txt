What will become of me
If its presence doesn't protect me?
How many sleepless nights?
My eyes staring at emptiness

Why does my body feel so cold?
The star does wind on my shoulder no more
Was it all wrong?
Nothing was real
A pleasant dream? An illusion?
Not so sure...

Now, all my fears are like spiders creeping on my back
He was my guardian angel, my savior
Am I to live without his strength
When the Winding Star disappears

Why does my body feel so cold?
My body is forsaken
Was it all wrong?
Nothing was real
A pleasant dream? An illusion?
Not so sure...

Why does my body feel so cold?
The star does wind on my shoulder no more
Was it all wrong?
Nothing was real
A pleasant dream? An illusion?
An illusion...
