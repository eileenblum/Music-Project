How can you choose my way ?
I just want to discover
All the colours of my life
You think that you can
Travel in my head
And find who I am....
Do not be so sure!

You don't accept to forgive all
But first, you have to ask
The good questions
You don't accept to forgive all
But I've never seen
A journey without a hitch

Sit down
I really need you this time
Don't speak and listen to me
You have to feel...
Sit down
I really need you this time
Don't speak and listen to me
You have to feel and realize
I want more than formalities!

Now wake up!
I've never seen
A journey without a hitch

Can you choose my way?
I just want to discover
All the colours of my life
