Ignorance makes men wicked
If they could lay their weapons down
No tears would ever wet anyone's face anymore
Knowledge dwells inside each of us, even you can find the way
Apathy is not the answer, too easy to complain about...

You crazy, what's in your mind?
Shall we keep ourselves locked inside?
I'm freezing, give me the blanket back!
Can't you feel the attraction...
I just want to sleep..... Peace!
Drawing us outside?... Wake up!

You can choose to cross the bridge
That lies in every window
Know that the other side is worth standing up and striving

The lack of light inside you, steers me into suffocation
What you got is all you deserve

Dance with me...
Move up...
Move your feet...
Dance with me...
Embrace me...

You can stay if you please
Make yourself at ease
The window is open, I am leaving.
