How ironic, isnât it ? Sweetheart
This was not your call
Who asked you to enter The Forge?
You must admit that you did it just for yourself,
For your own satisfaction...
And what if the fire had never left The Forge?

They name you âThe one who thinks before actingâ
Of course Darling, the fire provided good things to Humanity :
It led them to a new world
With your gift, they forged weapons to kill themselves
And they learned how tough life can be!
... and so did you, honey!
... and so did you, honey!

I hope they thanked you for their great living!
Itâs pleasant to play with fire...
... you know that His ire will never leave you!
... so did you, honey!
... and so did you honey!
