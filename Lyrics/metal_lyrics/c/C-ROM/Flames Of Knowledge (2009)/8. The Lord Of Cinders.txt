Life crumbles everywhere I go
Beneath my feet, the ground is burnt to ashes
While my hands reduce everything to dust
I am the Almighty, the Lord of cinders

I master the elements,
The Universe keeps no secrets to me anymore
But I canât contain the huge fire
Devastating my house

The unforgivable mistake
Made me survive
The terrible curse
Made me what I am

My sceptre is a flaming torch
My kingdom is an ashes heap
My existence is absurd
My nature, a heresy
