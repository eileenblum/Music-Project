Open your eyes wretched human !
I wished nothing but the best for you...
You go through your life,
Thinking youâre a victim
Do you really believe in your innocence?

Yes I was here...
Iâm the only one...
All this pain...
I canât refrain from laughing!

I fascinate you, but you are in dread of me
You accuse me, but your destiny is not mine!
