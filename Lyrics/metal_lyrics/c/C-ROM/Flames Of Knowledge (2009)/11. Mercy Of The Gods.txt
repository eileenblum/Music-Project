Nobody asked so much from you
You just need to draw strength from my eyes
Follow your way, and donât look back
Put your arms around me
Do you believe in me?
Do you believe in you?
Our existence is here and now, no matter what we did in the past
You made a choice once, now that youâre free everything is possible

I Wonder why you donât feel happier

You went as

far as you could

You should not fear whatâs behind you

Do you believe in me
Do you believe in you
We are free
We canât escape from our history
We commit mistakes
But we learn
We want to believe that beneath the cinders, life can bloom again
