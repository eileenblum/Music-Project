Once it is all done, can you undo?
Can you use what you tried to forget
To recreate and go on with your life?
Can you really choose its way?

Do you feel this flame deep Inside of you
Does it heat you up, or does it trip you up?

Evil, good, heat, destruction, melt, brightness
It can do many things, evil, good
Which one will you choose?
Will you destroy or will you build?

You canât make without it
You canât be without it anymore

Do you believe it is a gift
Do you refuse to understand
That it makes what you make it do
