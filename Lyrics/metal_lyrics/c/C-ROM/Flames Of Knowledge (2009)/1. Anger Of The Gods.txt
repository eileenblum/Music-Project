He is the Establishment
The unique guardian of the values
Whoever dares defy the Almighty
Shall experience His ire

The nature of things has been broken
Someone defied the Almighty
Disobedience cannot be tolerated
The culprit must undergo punishment immediately

- Guilty! Seize him!
Strike him, hit him!
Chain him up to the rock!
- It was the only thing to doâ¦. I had toâ¦
- You had to obey, they are nothing (for we are gods)

Fire is powerful, it makes humans escape from our control
Fire should be kept in a safe place
Fire is ours
We are the Ones

- Suffer! You traitor!
Be prepared to be endlessly wounded
Welcome the winged torturer as your only companion
- Future will tell what I will becomeâ¦
- It will be as I said!
