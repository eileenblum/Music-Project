Why should I resist when it is teasing me ?
But what lies behind this attraction?
I know I will have what I want in the end!
A pleasant sensation spreading into my veins

There it is, just a step from me:
Just need to let go and welcome Desire
Just a step from me:
The more I wait, the more I enjoy the Fire

A pleasant sensation spreading into my veins
Nothing can refrain me from stealing it

Temptation is driving me through daring

I guess itâs gonna be delicious:
Every glance I take increases my desire
I guess itâs gonna be delicious:
And I know itâs gonna rise higher

A pleasant sensation spreading into my veins
Nothing can refrain me from stealing it

Why should I resist when it is teasing me?
Temptation is driving me through daring...
Am I able to feel remorse? (no Iâm not)
I know I will have what I want in the end!
