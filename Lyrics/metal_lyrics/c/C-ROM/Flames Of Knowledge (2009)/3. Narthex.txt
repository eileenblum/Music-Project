Letâs chop wood
Letâs draw water
Letâs melt metal
Making tools, weapons, bullets

Letâs tame horses
Letâs farm the land
Letâs gather crops
Eating, drinking, using up

Letâs settle around fire
Letâs build dwellings
Letâs found cities
Growing bigger and higher

Fire feeds our knowledge
Progress springs from our work

We go everywhere
We talk to everyone
We know everything
Connecting, linking again, and again

We fix the DNA
We clone our children
We master life
Upgrading Humanity

Fire feeds our knowledge
Progress springs from our work
We are becoming more and more clever
We are becoming stronger and stronger
We need no Gods anymore
We are

Cell regeneration gives endless life, forever young and attractive
Spy people by exploring their brains
Copy-paste human thoughts
Bend time and space, change the past, know the future
Open doors to alternative universes
