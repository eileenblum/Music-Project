Day one - 6:00 a.m
Havenât slept a lot, my eyes burn a bit
I know the sun, the light it diffuses
I know the stars, spots in the dark sky
I know the cold, when it goes through my flesh
I know the wind, howling in my ears
Can I close my eyes and feel nothing anymore?

Day two - 2:05 a.m

Awakeâ¦ sleepless nightâ¦
Againâ¦ long for a restâ¦
My body isnât mine, my mind is forsaking me

Day three â 3:50 p.m

I am unfit for feeling the world around me
Why are these hands moving?
What is this smile on my face?
How many hours?
Letters slide over words trying to express
Ideas I canât bridle

Day four â 9:35 p.m

Countless days, endless hours, how long can I cope?
Can I choose to wake up?
Can I choose my way?
So many hoursâ¦
Can I close my eyes and feel nothing anymore?
