Heâs alone
It hurts him badly and itâs like an endless torture
He would never have thought it could have ended this way

From the sky
It comes and lands on his chest
Digging deep into his body
Eating, tearing, pecking, never ending

Eternal punishment for a mistake
He made but didnât mean

His will was to help, to offer a gift
An inestimable present
He stole, he broke the rules
Though does he truly deserves His anger?

He wished to share life with everyone
He thinks about her, a lot

What else can he do?
Her picture in his mind soothies his wounds for a while

The pain is unbearable but the moon comes
And it goes again
Eternal punishment for a mistake he made but didnât mean
His will was to help, to offer a gift. An inestimable present
