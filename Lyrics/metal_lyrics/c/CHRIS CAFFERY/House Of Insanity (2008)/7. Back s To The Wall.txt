Facing ice in the wind
Brace yourself for the fall
Neon lights, all colours will bleed
Gotta fight for it all

In the circle we dance to be free
Wait relentlessly, please let me be
Music protects me in tonight
Rise to the call

[x2]
Whoa oh whoa
Whoa oh whoa
Whoa oh whoa
Now my back's to the wall

Endless nights, they begin
Side by side, see them fall
Takes your mind on a mystical spin
Full of life curtain calls

In the moonlight we dance to be free
Feel the power unleashed deep in me
Open my heart and my mind
Words to thrall

[x2]
Whoa oh whoa
Whoa oh whoa
Whoa oh whoa
Now my back's to the wall

[Solo]

Did you really think
Like the yolk, you wont fall?
In this bottomless pit
Your back's to the wall
Carry on
Question fate
might
Must survive
Back's to the wall
Heal my soul
Take my hand
Stop my pain

[Solo]

In the circle we dance to be free
Wait relentlessly, please let me be
Music protects me in life
Safe from the fall

[x4]
Whoa oh whoa
Whoa oh whoa
Whoa oh whoa
Now my back's to the wall

[Solos]
