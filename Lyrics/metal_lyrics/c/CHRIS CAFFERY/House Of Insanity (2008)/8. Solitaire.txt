[Solo]

Lie four aces ahead of you
Show the cards
Dealer call them out too
Face of the King to
The right of the Ace
Joker is crying
It's all a disgrace
Ah yeah

Continue the deal
Til your deck is used up
Loaded and losing
Face down on your luck

Hearts on fire
Spades admire
Make life an adventure
For the devil may care
If it's whether you
Win and I lose
Good luck with your millions
I'll play solitaire
I'll play solitaire

[Solo]

Fifty two the pawn
He never rests
King of kings
The devil placed his bets
There's something up his sleeve
Ace of spades, he deals again
Jack of clubs, he bleeds

Hearts on fire
Spades admire
Make life an adventure
For the devil may care
If it's whether you
Win and I lose
Good luck with your millions
I'll play solitaire
I'll play solitaire
I'll play solitaire

[Solo]

Hearts on fire

Good luck with your millions
I'll play solitaire
I'll play solitaire

[Solo]

I'll play solitaire
