It was- winter in Hamburg
The first time I came
My life changed for me
I realized I belonged
In this place
Just a bright eyed kid
A rock n roll dream
My friends and a beer
The world fell that year
The faces, the smiles
Erase the miles
Like home away from home
Winter in Hamburg

I read the books
Millions of lives been here
Many nations at war
Fight to be free
But everything changed
After 9-1-1
It was never the same
The end had begun

I never wanted to go
Always wanted to stay
Right before my eyes
It fade away

It was winter in Hamburg
The next time I came
My life changed for me
I realized I belonged
In this place
Just a bright eyed kid
A rock 'n roll dream
My friends and a beer
My golden years
The faces, the smiles
Erase the miles
Like home away from home
Winter in Hamburg

[x4]
All alone
(All alone)
Guns aligner
(Aligner)
Help me find my home
(Will I ever get home)

[Solo]

All alone
(All alone)
Guns aligner
(Aligner)
Help me find my home

It was winter in Hamburg
The last time I came
My life changed for me
I realized something's wrong
In this place
Still a bright eyed kid
His rock 'n roll dream
My friends were not here
I shed a tear
I can't find the smiles
To erase the miles
It's cold away from home
Winter in Hamburg
