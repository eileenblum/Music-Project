[Solo]

Ooh yesterday's gone
Ooh time to move on

(Save, save, save)
Save me
The men where I stand
(I must feel you)
Help me in time to see
Why give to you
When you can give to me

Afraid of change, rearrange
Unknown
Must escape reality
Unknown

No matter what
No matter when
Do not regret
Your life my friend
When time is up
You can't pretend
No matter what
Your life will end

[Solo]

(Feel, feel, feel)
Feel me
My presence is known
(I must feel you)
Help me
I can not return
Lost in life
I will die alone

Afraid of change, rearrange
Unknown
Must escape reality
Unknown

No matter what
No matter when
Do not regret
Your life my friend
When time is up
You can't pretend
No matter what
Your life will end

No matter what
No matter when
Do not regret
Your life my friend
When time is up
You can't pretend
No matter what
Your life will end
