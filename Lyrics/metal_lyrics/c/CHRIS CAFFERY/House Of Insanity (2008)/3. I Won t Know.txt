I surrender to the theory
That in time
Everything will get better
I see changes in the realm
Most don't seem right
No regret from the master

The pollution sends
The heat arising
Never though the
Seasons could end
Far from winter into
Days we find the sun
Melting dreams of pleasure

We are heading in
A new direction this time
Too late to change
100 years of thoughtless minds

Many say the end is coming
Blame myself, humanity
Don't ask me for the answers
I won't know

Lost horizons
Luminescent in my mind
Remembered day dreams
Words of wisdom they
Escape in space and time
But the heat remains

We are hading in the
Wrong direction this time
Feel the wrath of 100 years
Of thoughtless minds

Whoa oh whoa, whoa oh whoa
Whoa oh whoa, whoa oh whoa
Whoa oh whoa, whoa oh whoa
I won't know

Many say the end is coming
Blame myself, humanity
Don't ask me for the answers
I won't know

Imagine the unthinkable
A humanoid demise
As the years start to give
Mankind starts to take
Genocide
Who will survive?

Whoa oh whoa, whoa oh whoa
Whoa oh whoa, whoa oh whoa
Whoa oh whoa, whoa oh whoa
I won't know
won't know

I surrender to the theory
That in time
Everything will get better
I see changes in the realm
Most just ain't right
Time to meet your maker

[Solos]

Many say the end is coming
Blame myself, humanity
I'd like to think I have the answers
But I wont know
Many say the end is coming
Blame myself, humanity
Don't ask me for the answers
I won't know

I won't know
Oh, I won't know
I won't know
