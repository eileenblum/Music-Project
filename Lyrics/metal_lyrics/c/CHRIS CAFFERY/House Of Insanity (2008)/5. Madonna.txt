As it falls, I see
The lights in the space
Around me
It's bitter and cold
On the banks of the stream
True love, it seems
Takes the course
That never runs smooth
But it's worth it to me
To fight the art
So will be

I believe that destiny
Replaces the wall of sadness
Your love is all I need
It's caught in a web
That surrounds me

Did you ever see Madonna?
My heart is lost without her
Each day apart we breathe
Is taking the life from me

As I try to sleep
(Oh Madonna)
The dark of the night
Surrounds me
What's missing in life
I'll try to find in my dreams
When I wake, I see
(Oh Madonna)
The empty space that
Lies beside me
It's bitter and cold
(Bitter and cold)
Where the warmth used to be

I believe that destiny
Replaces the wall of sadness
Your love is all I need
It's caught in a web
That surrounds me
Oh yeah yeah

Did you ever see Madonna?
My heart is lost without her
Each day apart we breathe
Is taking the life from me
And every day that I'm alone
My bleeding heart
It turns to stone
Deep inside I must believe
In the end you'll be with me

Oh life's too short for pain
How can I start to live again?

[Solo]

I believe that destiny
Replaces the wall of sadness
Your love is all I need
It's caught in the web
That surrounds me

Did you ever see Madonna?
My heart is lost without her
Each day apart we breathe
Is taking the life from me
And every day that I'm alone
My bleeding heart
It turns to stone
Deep inside I must believe
In the end you'll be with me

[Solo]

Yeah
Each day away
I takes my life away
