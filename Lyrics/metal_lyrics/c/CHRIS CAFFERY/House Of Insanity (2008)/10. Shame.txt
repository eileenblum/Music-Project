Ghosts roam the ruins
In the dead
Blackened blindness

Wheels turn in circles
Help me now holy mother
In the backyard of the church
They worship nightly
Crucify the angels
of our salvation

Forever and ever
You may run and hide
The mirror's a strange
Wrapping mouths with
The danger tonight

Oh feel the shame
(Feel the shame)
I'm not ashamed
(Feel the shame)

[Solo]

Mother terror bless
This five legged suckling
Out of the valley rides his
Surprises help me
Deep in the forest
Can you hear the trees fall?
As they the angels
Sever all relations

Forever and ever
You may run and hide
The mirror's a strange
Wrapping mouths with
The danger tonight

Oh feel the shame
(Feel the shame)
I'm not ashamed
(Feel the shame)

Shame on you!

[Solo]

Forever and ever
You may run and hide
The mirror's a strange
Wrapping mouths with
The danger tonight
(Tonight)

Oh feel the shame
(Feel the shame)
I'm not ashamed

[Solo]

I'm not ashamed
Oh
Yeah
Feel the shame
Yeah
Shame on you
(Feel the shame)
