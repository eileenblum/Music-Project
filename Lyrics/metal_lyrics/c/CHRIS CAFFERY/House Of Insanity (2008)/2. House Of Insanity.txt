In the storm of roses
A great fire arises
Illuminates the night in thorns
A fallen love is haunting
Rising from the sand
Eloquent, evil
And demand

We waited nightly
Mid-day dreaming
In my madness
Illusion scheming
Blackened suns
Of ages locked
Inside the laughter madmen flee
From the house of insanity

In the dead of sun walk
A winter storm of thunder
Of cold deceit
Please let me be
Now the night is falling
on his
Alas, the child is a man

We waited nightly
Mid-day dreaming
In my madness
Illusion scheming
Blackened suns
Of ages locked
Inside the laughter
madmen flee
From the house of insanity

[Solos]

We waited nightly
Mid-day dreaming
In my madness
Illusion scheming
Blackened suns
Of ages locked
Inside the laughter
madmen flee
From the house of insanity

House of insanity
