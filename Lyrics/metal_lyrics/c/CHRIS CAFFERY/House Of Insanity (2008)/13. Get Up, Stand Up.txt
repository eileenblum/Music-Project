Get up, stand up
Stand up for your rights!
Get up, stand up
Don't give up the fight!
Get up, stand up
Stand up for your rights!
Get up, stand up
Don't give up the fight!

Preacher man, don't tell me
Heaven is under the earth
I know you don't know
What life is really worth
It's not all that glitters is gold
Half the story has never been told
So now you see the light, oh!
Stand up for your rights
Come on!

Get up, stand up
Stand up for your rights!
Get up, stand up
Don't give up the fight!

Most people think
Great god will come from the sky
Take away everything
And make everybody feel high
But if you know what life is worth
You will look for yours on earth
And now you see the light
You stand up for your rights
(Jah)

Get up, stand up!
(Jah! jah!)
Stand up for your rights!
(Oh whoa)
Get up, stand up!
(Get up, stand up)
Don't give up the fight!
(Life is your right)
Get up, stand up!
Stand up for your rights!
(Lord, Lord)
Get up, stand up!
(We keep on struggling on)
Don't give up the fight!
(Yeah!)

[Solos]

We sick an' tired of-a
Your ism-skism game
Dyin' to go to heaven
In-a Jesus' name, lord
We know when we understand
Almighty god is a living man
You can fool
Some people sometimes
But you can't fool all
The people all the time
So now we see the light
(What you gonna do?)
We gonna stand up for our rights!
(Jah, jah)

So you better
Get up, stand up!
(In the morning get it up)
Stand up for your rights!
(In the night)
Get up, stand up!
Don't give up the fight!
(Don't give it up, don't give it up!)
Get up, stand up!
(Get up, stand up!)
Stand up for your rights!
(Get up, stand up!)
Get up, stand up!
Don't give up the fight!
Get up, stand up!
(Life is your right)
Stand up for your rights!
Get up, stand up!
Don't give up the fight!
(Jah)
