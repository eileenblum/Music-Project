If I died tomorrow
Oh, oh
Ooh, oh
Would you still remember me?
Oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, yeah

Time, he marches
An army in sections of
Seconds mocking me
Repulsive yet
In the eyes of the blind
It's me that they see
Who bleeds them?
Yet they're bleeding my blood
Killing the faith in me, yeah

If I died tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
Would you laugh in silence
Like you did when
You did not believe?
If I died tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
Would you take
The chance like me
To pray, admit mistakes
And say I'm sorry

In the aftermath
We survey our loses
Some gone eternally
We mount our crosses
Broken hearts, they're burning

If I died tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
Would you laugh in silence
Like you did when
You did not believe?
If I died tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
Would you take
The chance like me
To pray, admit mistakes
And say I'm sorry
I'm sorry

[Solo]

Broken hearts, they're burning

If I died tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
Would you laugh in silence
Like you did when
You did not believe?
If I died tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
Would you take
The chance like me
To pray, admit mistakes
And say I'm sorry
Oh!

[Solo]
