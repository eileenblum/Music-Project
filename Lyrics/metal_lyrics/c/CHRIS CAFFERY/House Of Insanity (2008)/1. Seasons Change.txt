One by one, step by step
You never gave me time
All I know, no regrets
I leave them all behind

Can you see the signs?
The changing in my eyes
It's no surprise
As I say goodbye
When I say goodbye

The rubber face
That seals the hate
Has made it's mistakes
It's time to replace
Some things as

All seasons change
Like a whispering wind
Grown to a hurricane's rage
All seasons change
Like a rotating door
The stories will take me away

[Solo]

Trial by fire
You'll get burned
I never seem to learn
Lose the life to a king
The pawn begins to sing

Can you feel the sight
Emotions come alive
It's too late to cry
The oceans do not lie
Don't ask me why

The rubber face
That seals the hate
Has made it's mistakes
It's time to replace
Some things as

All seasons change
Like a whispering wind
Grown to a hurricane's rage
All seasons change
Like a rotating door
The stories will take me away

[Solo]

All seasons change
Like a whispering wind
Grown to a hurricane's rage
All seasons change
For the rest of my life
The stories will take me away

[Solo]

[x8]
I've learned the lesson of life
I've earned the lesson of life
