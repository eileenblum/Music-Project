[Solo]

I know a thing or two
About you
The clothes you wear
The colour hair
The search
Will find you and bind you

He who walks
Amongst the rows
My eyes do not close
You live to be free
But I always see
When you think you're
Safe and all alone
Big brother is watching you

Of the principle pompous
We are the hunter's army
Bind you, we'll find you

He who walks
Amongst the rows
My eyes do not close
You live to be free
But I always see
The start to the end
So do not pretend
My electric eye, he sees
Thirty million currently
When you think you're
Safe and all alone
Big brother is watching you

[Solo]

Bring us in

He who walks
Amongst the rows
My eyes do not close
You live to be free
But I always see
The start to the end
So do not pretend
My electric eye, he sees
Thirty million currently
When you think you're
Safe and all alone
Big brother is watching you

Just when you think
You're safe in your home
Big brother is watching you
