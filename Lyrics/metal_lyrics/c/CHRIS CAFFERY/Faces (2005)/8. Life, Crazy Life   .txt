Lots of crazy gambles, every single day
I fought the fool inside
Just living for the moment, I always find the way
Up and down and through the grind

But it's hard, it's hard to pave the way
Yeah it's hard, it's hard to stay the sane
'Cause my fuel for life is burning the candle at both ends

Life, Crazy Life

Packed up and I'm running, no specific place
I only know it's time
'Cause I'm tired of the waiting
You never win the race
'Til you cross the finish line

Yeah it's hard, it's hard to pave the way
Yeah it's hard, it's hard to stay the sane
But it's such a great sensation, getting better every day
Living the fight and winning the fight
'Cause my fuel for life is burning the candle at both end

Life, Crazy Life
Life, Crazy Life

But it's such a great sensation, getting better every day
Living the fight and winning the fight
As you ride your own creation, chequered flag I'm on my way

Life, Crazy Life
Life, Crazy Life
