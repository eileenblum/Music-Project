Man come set me free

I view time as a fallen angel, once a friend it's not there for me
Livin' large in the valley of strangers, just a son of reality
Pure in heart, clear in mind, Music Man come set me free

I spent time eye to eye with danger, felt the ropes reaching out for me
Feeling small in the army of shameless, just a leaf on the family tree
Purest heart, clearest mind, Music Man gonna set me free

The dream's in her arms
Embraced in her arms
The dream comes alive
Embraces your life

I built walls of a strong foundation, for my friends or they seemed to be
Travel life giving all to strangers, in their smiles it makes me see
Give your heart, open mind, Music Man is the man in me

The dream's in her arms
Embraced in her arms
The dream comes alive
Embraces your life

Well I've testified life in the court of her laws
I've battled the axes, the ashes I saw
And I saw them all once and I saw them again in the end
And again, and again, and again, and again and again in life, in life

I view time as a fallen angel, once a friend it's not there for me
Livin' large in the valley of strangers, just a son of reality
Pure in heart, clearest mind, Music Man is the man in me

The dream's in her arms
Embraced in her arms
The dream comes alive
Embraces your life
