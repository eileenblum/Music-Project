I know you're leaving
But I can't believe it
You gave the reason
But I'm not believing

How do you know when the feeling is gone
Where will you go when it falls and the walls collapse around you
Trusting my faith in the powers above
Fading away is your face from the walls that hang the laughter
I wonder as I look to the sky and she's...

So far away
So far today
There were days and nights when dreams would come alive
Now the faded visions they fight to survive in me

I blame the mystery
But you shame the history

How can you say that the feeling is gone
How can you claim you're the one who never meant to hurt me
Losing my faith in the powers above
Fading away is your face from the walls as you desert me
I wonder why I look to the sky and she's

So far away
So far today
So far away
So far today
There were days and night when dreams would come alive
Now the faded visions they fight to survive in me

So far away
So far today
So far away
So far today
There were days and night when dreams would come alive
Now the faded visions they fight to survive in me
