Innocence the horizon
Temperatures reach the mark of the beast
Appetite for delusion
All alone, they prepare for the feast

Stare into the eyes of the night
Two wrongs won't make it right

Abandoned
Abandoned

Represent the depression
Head of state pay the price for the toll
Ostracized from the session
Pick and choose, under total control

Communicate through the ego's decay
The herd has come to play

Abandoned
Abandoned
