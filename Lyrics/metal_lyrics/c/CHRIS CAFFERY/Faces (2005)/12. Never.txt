Every life needs a stable inside
Atop the roof to yield the drain
But in your mind you may hide from the world, little girl
Can't you see that it's not right, when they fight
Open up our wings, let's fly together

I never see the tears around me
I never knew 'til it's too late
I always felt that you were hurting deep inside
But in time, if you allow, I'll take the fears away

Every book needs a fable inside
To hide the truth and ease the pain
But in your mind you may hide, from your dreams, kept inside
Can't you see that it ain't right, little girl
Open up your wings, let's fly together

I never see the tears around me
I never knew 'til it's too late
I always felt that you were hurting deep inside
But in time, time, time, let's make the wows and take the fears away

You think it's destiny, this emptiness eternally
Come take my hand when you're afraid
You seem to hide the key to happiness eternally
Come with me 'fore it's too late

In your mind you may hide, little girl, in your world
I will be there through the fight, little girl
Open up your wing, let's fly together

I never see the tears around me
I never knew 'til it's too late
I always felt that you were hurting deep inside
But in time, time, time, let's make the wows and take the fears away
