Stare down the barrel of the corrugated steel
Tricked by the bottle, can't remember what it real
Torched by the infidels who blasphemies the rules
Swords of the army, dig deeper in my wounds, yeah

Taught by the mother, keep your faith, you shall receive
Stripped by the father, stole away what you believed
Fucked by the day by day, a virus in your soul
Paint by numbers, you never get control

Eternal nowhere is my home, life feels like a living hell for me
Can't seem to separate what's real, as I feel like dying

I'm abandoned, all alone in this world
But I'm still standing, I'm no stranger to the pain
I'm abandoned, the celebration will end
It's empty and cold, when you're abandoned

Run from the image, caught me glaring into space
Tricked by the pressure, I'm still trying to embrace
Fooled by the promises of the young and the old
Ruled by endangerment, the stories will unfold

Eternal nowhere is my home, life feels like a living hell for me
Can't seem to separate what's real, as I feel like dying

I'm abandoned, all alone in this world
But I'm still standing, I'm no stranger to the pain
I'm abandoned, the celebration will end
It's empty and cold, I'm losing control
Attacking your soul when you're abandoned

What is love, it never knew me
Where is love, it ravels through me

A rolling stone gathers moss at it leaves a mark on your soul
Feel the pain in the back of the front as you're losing control
Think about it, live without it
Think about it, live without it
Lord why have you abandoned me?
Think about it, live without it
Think about it, live without it
Think about it, live without it
Think about it, live without it

Eternal nowhere is my home, life feels like a living hell for me
Can't seem to separate what's real, as I feel like dying

I'm abandoned, I'm alone in this world
But I'm still standing, I'm no stranger to the pain
I'm abandoned, the celebration will end
It's empty and cold, I'm losing control
Attacking your soul when you're abandoned

Lord why have you abandoned me?
Think about it, live without it
Think about it, live without it
Think about it, live without it
