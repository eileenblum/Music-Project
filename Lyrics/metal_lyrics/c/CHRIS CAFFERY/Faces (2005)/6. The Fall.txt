Life for me is changing, court is re-arranging
Heart inside is blaming me
Looking for love in the red light land
Look but don't touch, the art of man
Doing my time in the world of make believe

Mind takes me home
Blind left alone

Hearts were ailing but I always saved the healing
Minds were laughing, but I always walked into the Fall

Lunatics are taunting, virgin mind distorting
Heart inside escaping me
Looking for fun in the city of lights
Innocent game when you're out of sight
Doing my time as I wrestle sanity

Mind takes me home
Blind left alone

Hearts were ailing but I never saved the healing
Minds were laughing, but I always walked into the Fall
Of April as I never made it through the spring to action
Quickly 'fore the Summer is the Fall

Step back and check out the fool, he really looks a lot like me
And he's wrapped around the finger, broken every fucking rule
Lock the door, threw away the key

Mind takes me home
Blind left alone

Hearts were ailing but I never saved the healing
Minds were laughing, but I always walked into the Fall
Of April as I never made it through the spring to action
Quickly 'fore the Summer is the Fall
