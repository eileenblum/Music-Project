You know the faces, you have seen them on the wall
10 different visionaries begging for the call
10 different people, the criminally insane
Countdown to extinction, but still you can't contain

A rotating force, pulling power from below

Evil is as evil does - evil is as evil does
A million years it always was - a million tears it always was
Evil is as evil does - evil is as evil does
A million tears spilled in blood because
Evil is as evil does!!!

You know the faces, you have seen them on TV
Take away the power, would you ever have believed?
10 different evils conjure evil to appear
Ever think the evil is not all you have to fear?

A rotating force, pulling power from below

Evil is as evil does - evil is as evil does
A million years it always was - a million tears it always was
Evil is as evil does - evil is as evil does
A million tears spilled in blood because
Evil is as evil does!!!

Johnny be good, 'til Johnny saw bad
Johnny thought the worst was the best friend that he had
Beat the sapling senseless, what will happen to the tree
It will sprout the warped and twisted, take a bite out of the eve

A rotating force, pulling power from below

Evil is as evil does - evil is as evil does
A million years it always was - a million tears it always was
Evil is as evil does - evil is as evil does
One million tears spilled in blood because

Help me - the vermin is coming
Make me - I'm ready and lost
Show me - my father he never
Take me - I'm yours
