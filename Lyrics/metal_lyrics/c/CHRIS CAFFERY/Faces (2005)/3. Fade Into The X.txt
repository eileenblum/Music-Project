Across a smoke filled room, connect the spirit minds
Fatal attraction made me blind, two hearts, they pound of thunder
Too late, we've reached the other side
Of the bed you've made, losing all your space
Mental distraction the true crime
Two sides to every coin, it's not enough to pay this time

Do you remember, the day before the dream
Now I live this nightmare, ending with a plea

I never thought that you'd be one of them
Atop the list of things that used to be my hope
I see you slowly falling out of my mind, outer side
As you fade into the X

Locked boxes hold the truth, of distant memories
Purest evil of the grind
Heart of burning hunger, drove me out of my mind over matter
Cut of chilling steel

Do you remember, the day before the dream
Now I live this nightmare, ending with a plea

I never thought that you'd be one of them
Atop the list of things that used to be my hope
I see you slowly falling out of my mind, outer side
'Cause you fade into the X

I never thought that you'd be one of them
Atop the list of things that used to be my hope
I see you slowly falling out of my mind, outer side
As you fade into the X
As you fade into the X
As you fade into the X
Fade into the X
