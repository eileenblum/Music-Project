Daytime pisses me off, it starts me off on a wrong foot race
And night time pisses me off, it puts me back to the fucking place
And the face that pisses me off, she leaves a sour after taste
You see, my life pisses me off, I'm fucking sick of the human race

It's killing me, it's killing me
It's killing me, it's killing me

Everything pisses me off, from your cue ball head to the Grateful Dead
And the rap star pisses me off, they bitch and moan, Bang! Bang! You're dead
And the TV pisses me off, reality is a joke to me
'Cause my life pisses me off, a complete disgrace this human race

It's killing me, it's killing me
It's killing me, it's killing me

Oh, it's hard to survive
And nothing's gonna help ya
Please, I can beg to survive
But nothing's gonna help me

The computer pisses me off, it rules my life, this cyber wife
That e-mail pisses me off, your faceless shit cuts like a knife
Starbucks pisses me off, 5 bucks a cup, what the fuck is up?
'Cause my life pisses me off, I'm just a pawn in the human race

It's killing me, it's killing me
It's killing me, it's killing me

The terrorist pisses me off, with his fucking beard, the king of the weird
And the war, it pisses me off, the prices rise, the market fries
But the protests pisses me off, you raise your sign and fucking whine
This life it pisses me off, a compluckin' disgrace this human race

It's killing me, it's killing me
It's killing me, it's killing me

Oh, it's hard to survive
And nothing's gonna help ya
Please, I can beg to survive
But nothing's gonna help me now

Here's the war, raise the sign
Little pussy don't like it
Freedom of speech, not a crime
Many lives were lost to get here
Land of the free, home of the brave
You all will send us to our graves in time....

This life pisses me off!!
This life pisses me off!!
This life pisses me off!!
This life pisses me off!!
This life pisses me off!!
This life pisses me off!!

Because my life pisses me off, it may be time to up and run
But running pisses me off, I'd rather stay and have some fun
Because my life pisses me off, it feeds my anger happily
'Cause happiness pisses me off, wipe your smile off your face fucking human race

It's killing me, it's killing me
It's killing me, it's killing me

Does your life piss you off?
Does your life piss you off?
Does your life piss you off?
My life pisses me off!!!
