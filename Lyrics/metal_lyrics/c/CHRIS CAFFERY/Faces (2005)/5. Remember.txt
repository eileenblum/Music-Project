Stand at my crossroads, a scary place in my life
I'm not too sure which way is right
I think of my future, as my past it comes to me
But some of them left me in the fight

Please, the distance makes me sigh, when I'm further from you
Love, was destined 'til that night, the crazy battle of June
Dreams, they still embrace me

Remember, all these little things are coming back to me
Remember the time, when I got to know you
December, all these little scenes are coming back to me
Remember my eyes, they want to show you love

Fear is never in my heart, it lives and dies with you
Time, I can not make it right, I'd turn it back for you
Screams of bleeding heartache

Remember, all these little things are coming back to me
Remember the time, when I got to know you
December, all these little scenes are coming back to me
Remember my eyes, they want to show you love

I never felt this feeling in my life
It exceeded expectations
Distant stars of wonder, feeding to my hunger
Hidden in the thunder, lifting me towards heaven

Remember, all these little things are coming back to me
Remember the time, when I got to know you
December, all these little scenes are coming back to me
Remember my eyes, they want to show you
Remember, all these little things are coming back to me
Remember the time, when I got to know you
December, all these little scenes are coming back to me
Remember my eyes, they want to show you love
