Monday morning, God set me free
Monday evening, I crave the release
My mind it takes notes to regain control
My body it shakes from a blistering soul

âTil the night when weâre together
Words of love from the dead mouth of thee
Too sad on Earth, letâs take to the sky
Looking forwards, falling back into

Walls made of sugar, walls made of grain
Living inside the rows keep driving me insane
Some walls will bring the war
Some walls will keep the peace
Others mock, convalescent eternally
Into the void in my imagination I fall, in these walls

Tuesday morning has toasted my brain
Tuesday evening has baited my veins

âTil the night when weâre together
Words of love from the dead mouth of thee
Too sad on Earth, letâs take to the sky
Looking forwards, falling back into

Walls made of sugar, walls made of grain
Living inside the rows keeps driving me insane
Some walls will bring the war
Some walls will keep the peace
Others mock, convalescent eternally
Into the void in my imagination I fall, in these walls

Can you take me to the walls of China
Bring me back to see the walls of old Berlin
Show me the gates of Heaven
Many others are dying to get in
The walls of Kentucky, they know what to do
They discussed it all with the walls of Peru

âTil the night when weâre together
Words of love from the dead mouth of thee
Too sad on Earth, letâs take to the sky
Looking forwards, falling back into

Walls made of sugar, walls made of grain
Living inside the rows keeps driving me insane
Some walls will bring the war
Some walls will keep the peace
Others mock, convalescent eternally
Into the void in my imagination I fall, in these walls
