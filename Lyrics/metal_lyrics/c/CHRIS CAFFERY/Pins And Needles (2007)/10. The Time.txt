Up in arms, answer the call
Midnight moving down a cyber hall
Who pays for the bills, who wages the war
Who drives the invisible money whore?
The clock strikes eleven, a something day night
Choking the life from the sacred site
Who snatches the air, who challenges pain
Who leaves you waiting for the rich and vain?

Here it comes they say
Now itâs time, now itâs time
I bet itâs too late to pray
All hail the time
Bow to the time, the time!

Ominous clouds, cloaked in black in our minds
Covenant vow, in a click you will find
Who summoned your clod in the message code red?
Who saves your soul when you dance with the dead?

Here it comes they say
Now itâs time, now itâs time
I bet itâs too late to pray
All hail the time
The time

Itâs time, now itâs time, now itâs time!

Youâll never peel the puppets away
âCuz itâs a little too late

Too late to pray
All hail to the time!

Here it comes they say
Now itâs time, now itâs time
I bet itâs too late to pray
All hail the time
Bow to the time!
Watching the time
