[Bonus Track]Let me introduce myself, have we met before?
Time seemed to paralyze
When you walked into the room
Itâs not too often one can take my breath away
My life, my time, have you time for me

Could you take this hand
Of a strong and honest man
How many times can you look
Into the eyes of make believe

Once upon a time love was younger
In the eyes, hearts were set free
Roll the dice, whoâs your favorite number
Itâs no surprise
You were once in a lifetime for me
Once in a lifetime for me

You surely can seduce yourself
This thing in lifeâs for sure
Hearts seem to paralyze
When you walked out of the room

Would you take my hand
Iâm a strong, honest man
Just one time can you look
Into the eyes and believe

Once upon a time love was younger
In the eyes, hearts were set free
Roll the dice, whoâs your favorite number
Itâs no surprise
You were once in a lifetime for me
Once in a lifetime for me

We surely can seduce ourselves
Just like we did before
Hearts bleed and paralyze
When you walked out of the room

Do you take this hand
Iâm a strong, honest man
âTil the end of time
Look into my eyes and believe

Once upon a time love was younger
In the eyes, hearts were set free
Roll the dice, whoâs your favorite number
Itâs no surprise
You were once in a lifetime for me
Once in a lifetime for me
