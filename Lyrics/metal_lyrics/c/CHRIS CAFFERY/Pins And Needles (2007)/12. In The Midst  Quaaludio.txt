Father, can you hear me, there are questions in my life you see
Simple answers change, now the one and one is three
Things so simple, build the earth and feed the nevermore
The kingdom drifts so far away, to save the temple they must play

Had I known the angels would be struck by death
Had I seen the evil in the blackened white
Had I dreamed the end would come so senselessly
Can we save out sacred mystic temple?
Sacred mystic temple
