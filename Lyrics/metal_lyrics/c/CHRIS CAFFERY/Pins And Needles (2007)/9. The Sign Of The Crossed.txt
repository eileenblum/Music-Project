Father, Son, Holy Ghost
Whoâs the one you fear the most
Mother, Sister, Cyber Host
Raise your hands and make a toast

Is there sunshine in the rain, my fair weather friends?
Am I ever free from thee?
Is there shelter from the blazing arrows constant falseness
Help me now, I am falling, give my soul relief

I always believed, never crossed the line
I always had faith, never got returns

Watch the bastard as he makes me
Watch the minions and the dead beats
Jump up and down, the patternâs disturbed
Put the straight jacket on
Itâs too late to help me out, it can not be
It is the sign of the crossed

In the mirror of your life, what do you see
Warped reflection, purchased light thatâs non-existent to me
Is there payment for the deed
It is time to break, raidâs coming

I always believed you, never crossed the line
I always had faith, never got returns

Watch the bastard as he makes me
Watch the minions and the dead beats
Jump up and down, the patternâs disturbed
Put the straight jacket on
Itâs too late to help me out, it can not be
It is the sign of the crossed
