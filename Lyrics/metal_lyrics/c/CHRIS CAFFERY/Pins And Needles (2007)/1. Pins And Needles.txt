Nightmares, they come in many stages
High chairs, some apply to all the ages
Princess, you only see through you
Queen mother, the wrinkled bitch is you, itâs you too!

Pins and needles, needles and pins
A lack of circulation, the pain begins
Youâre numb to the ages, youâre chilled to the bone
Needles and pins, please leave me, leave me alone!!!

Week-ends, a seven day event
Your friends, a plethora of men
Sisters, they always know the truth
Blisters, the scars of the abuse, the abuse is you

Pins and needles, needles and pins
A lack of circulation, the pain begins
Youâre numb to the ages, youâre chilled to the bone
Needles and pins, please leave me, leave me alone!!!

Weather, have to weather the storm
Never, have I seen as much abnorm
Features, the smiles are pretend
Creatures, they mob you âtil the end, itâs the end my friend

Pins and needles, needles and pins
A lack of circulation, the pain begins
Youâre numb to the ages, youâre chilled to the bone
Needles and pins, please leave me, leave me alone!!!
