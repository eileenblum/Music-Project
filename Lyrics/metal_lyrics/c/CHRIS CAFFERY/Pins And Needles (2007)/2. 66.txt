Feel the deep chill, outer space
Bright lights, the mood, embrace
Precipitate the impulse, adult delinquency
Your dreams of grandeur infect the what will be
The price we pay, the cost of our lives today
Increase the waste, reduce the fuel, itâs insane
In the dark the miser produces his laughter
In the light the miser will bow to his master

One way in, thereâs no way out
They break my bones, these sticks and stones
The names will turn their tricks
Itâs a product of them all, represent the 66
A result of the 66, the six, is sick, itâs sick

See the full moon, outer space
Eclipses the groove, mind erase
Selling your soul, play the fool
Living your life, break the rules

The apple falls, it rolls, rots by the tree
The worm inside, it lives âtil the appleâs diseased
The worm is poised to rule this life ever after
The tree she frowns, axe strikes as she falls to the master

One way in, thereâs no way out
They break my bones, these sticks and stones
The names will turn their tricks
Itâs product of them all, represent the 66
A result of the 66, the six, is sick, itâs sick

The plan, we see, offend your dignity
Your goal, we see, intense insanity
Appalling price to pay, suffocate the brain

Ein, zwei, drei, vier, fÃ¼nf, sick 66

One, two, three, four, five, sick 66

One way in, thereâs no way out
They break my bones, these sticks and stones
The names will turn their tricks
Itâs product of them all, represent the 66
A result of the 66, the six, is sick, itâs sick, weâre sick, weâre sick
