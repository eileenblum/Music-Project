The level reaches red times three
Confusion all around
Youâve finally got the best of me
Iâm the best around
The pressure trips insanity
The danger it will mount
It only brings the best in me âcuz you see

I love your aggravation
It starts another wave of eternal bullshit

Youâve gotta be fucking kidding me
Youâve gotta be fucking kidding me
Gotta be fucking kidding me

Deceit it lives, the Devil breathes
The Reaperâs hunt is now
Still coming is the best from me and youâll see

I love you aggravation
It fuels determination
Now comes another wave of eternal bullshit

Youâve gotta be fucking kidding me
Youâve gotta be fucking kidding me
Gotta be fucking kidding me

Oohâ¦ the game is over
No more Sundays slave to sister sow
Engage the rover
Blackened hearts beat change
Has beckoned my might!!!

Youâve gotta be fucking kidding me
Youâve gotta be fucking kidding me
Iâm the boss, not you
You gotta be fucking kidding me
