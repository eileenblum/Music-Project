Torment again
Torment again
Again and again
Torment again
Torment again
Torment again
Again and again

Souls collide anatomy, ha! Joke to me history cannot repeat
Nah! Never be build, the pain inside of me had gone away
Fault of our technology, now here to stay

Make excuses as you playfully remorse
Release the juices, a most venomous discourse

Head starts to spin the evilâs unwound
The terror sets in, feel the torment!!!

Torment again, torment again, again and again
Torment again, torment again, again and again

Out of sight into your mind, ha! Comes again in a second
Hell rewinds, why annoy me friend? Answer not, the choice is yours
Why hold it back? Ignore the plastic techno spore, cell heart attack

Make excuses as you playfully remorse
Release the juices, a most venomous discourse

Head starts to spin the evilâs unwound
The terror sets in, feel the torment!!!

Head starts to spin the evilâs unwound
The terror sets in, a frightening sound
Head starts to spin the evilâs unwound
The terror sets in, feel the torment!!!

Torment again
Torment again
Torment again
Again and again
