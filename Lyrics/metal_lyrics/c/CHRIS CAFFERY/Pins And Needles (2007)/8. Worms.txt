In the form of human nature
Itâs priceless for us to see
Indisputable amongst the living
It is hard and concrete
Scrupulously random thoughts
Soaked deep in make believe
Most arenât pretty
Itâs the part you donât see
What sends the reflex
Who shoots the worms?
Some are harmless, some are poisoned, some obscene
Trudge the rules of mass existence as hard as it seems
Youâll get the respect, youâll win the war

Strike on, (worms) youâre always coming up right
Drop out, (worms) you got misinformed
Strike on, (worms) the switch is as easy as light
Sign off, (worms) in your struggling false mind

Insiders, extremists play the game, they flame the war
Draped in mass hysteria, they are worse than before
Meddling masses of immoral make it hard to sleep
Eminent acts of terror, cyber space they will creep
They send the mail back, refute the words
Uncontrolling neurons aiming high, theyâre hungry
Portrayed as angels, makes itâs hard to decree
I set the influx, Iâll shoot the worms

Strike on, (worms) youâre always coming up right
Drop out, (worms) you got misinformed
Strike on, (worms) the switch is as easy as light
Sign off, (worms) in your struggling false mind

Strike on, (worms) youâre always coming up right
Drop out, (worms) you got misinformed
Strike on, (worms) the switch is as easy as light
Sign off, (worms) in your struggling false mind

Itâs a Weak Offensive Rattling My Sanity

WORMS!
