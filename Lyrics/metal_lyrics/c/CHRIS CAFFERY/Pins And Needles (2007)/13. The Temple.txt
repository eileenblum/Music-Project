Children start to play, thereâs magic in intention
Will it go away when the father takes his toll
Dreaming of life in distant places
Eternally is seems thereâs love
Love in these embraces

Canât conceive the devastation
I relate to your frustration
Can we save our mystic temple
I relate to your frustration
Canât conceive the devastation
I relate to your frustration
Can we save our mystic temple
I relate to your frustration

Save us, itâs hard to breathe
A manic situation
Humans, only spread the disease
As the father takes control
Legions! The jester bows, heâs free
I canât explain, Iâm sorry my friends
The temple bleeds me mentally

Canât conceive the devastation
I relate to your frustration
Can we save our mystic temple
I relate to your frustration
Canât conceive the devastation
I relate to your frustration
Can we save our mystic temple
Help us save our mystic temple

Close your eyes, see my temple
Chariots of gold take the never ending ride it goes
Across the seas, by the night we all sang along
Many believed it never could demise
Alive, the temple it grows, âtil lives explode
The dream it ends, what has happened to me

You should have seen it coming
Green, amber, red light running
In victory we were blinded
Reality starts rewinding

Warning
Your templeâs not bullet proof
Mourning
Awaken and change the truth
Victims
The legion is fighting doom
Warning
Itâs time to accept that itâs true
