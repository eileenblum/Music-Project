Chained, forever in chains
Chained, forever in chains

Err is human, I am human
And see the wrong and the right
Lifeâs solutions, there so simple
Yet seem theyâre the hardest to find
Lonely phantoms walk the earth
Tortured souls
Itâs the heartache that binds
In the twilight the figures
Shed tears through the years
Itâs a hard line to sight

Glimmering motion entranced in the streams
In the light is the darkest retreat
Desperate souls
Are clutching for years
Never returning again 

Weâre chained
Haunted angel, forever in chains
Chained haunted angel, forever in chains

What they stole from the tears
Itâs not right
Itâs a hard act to fight
Desperation of mortals who triumphed through fear
Itâs the heart of it all
Resolution, it takes years to begin
Itâs all part of the pain
Haunted angels
In the fire they scream
Cries to heaven in vane

Glimmering motion entranced in the streams
In the light is the darkest retreat
Desperate souls
Are clutching for years
Never returning again

Weâre chained
Haunted angel, forever in chains
Chained haunted angel, forever in chains

Forever in chains

Glimmering motion entranced in the streams
In the light is the darkest retreat
Desperate souls
Are clutching for years
Never returning again

Weâre chained
Haunted angel, forever in chains
Chained haunted angel, forever in chains
