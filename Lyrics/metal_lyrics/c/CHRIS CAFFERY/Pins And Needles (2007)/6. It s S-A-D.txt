Midnight, clock strikes on any other day
It would be time to rumble, the time to play
Now we sit and watch the after, math is plain insane
The kingdomâs numb, ailing masses, I feel their pain

Are really smiling, S-A-D
When we celebrate, S-A-D
Itâs getting hard to swallow, S-A-D
The empty words we ate
Itâs sad

Itâs not my fault, it was my life
They closed the door after
Death, Death, Death, Death!!!!!

One oâclock, in settles numbness, onward the machine
Kinda hard to conjure feelings of the seventeen
History was in the making, thousands creamed insane
Now we sit and trade the rumors, âtwas all in vane?

Are really smiling, S-A-D
When we celebrate, S-A-D
Itâs getting hard to swallow, S-A-D
The empty words we ate
Itâs sad

Itâs not my fault, it was my life
They closed the door after Death
I feel your pain, itâs not the same
Itâs all we have after death

Flying, speeding, father bleeds me
Canât hide the truth, the mirror shows truth
Church bells cast spells, living in Hell
Canât run from the truth, must face the truth

Mid day, clock strikes, time to finally wake
History send shivers nightly, the past I crave
No time to sit, enjoy the after, life is plain insane
Letâs start the journey over, please heal my pain

Are really smiling, S-A-D
When we celebrate, S-A-D
Itâs getting hard to swallow, S-A-D
The empty words we ate
Itâs sad

Itâs not my fault, it was my life
They closed the door after Death
I feel your pain, itâs not the same
Itâs all we have after death
