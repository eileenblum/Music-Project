Glitter, the lights shine 
They never see what's lying 
Behind make-up and madness the children start to wonder 
And we do wonder daily if we'll ever will find peace 
As the angel is smiling, the seasons upon us 
Can we all take the time to escape in the mind of the child and find. 
Who brings the joy, not the pain to our lives today 
Winter's alive, with snowflakes all around 
Towards the New Year we climb 
Hope and love our brother's now 
Like a bridge over time 
Princes and Kings and wise men They're not wiser 
Than the children in the spring, without price tags, the plastic smiles 
They still play til the end of the mystery and the day dreams 
Can we learn from the innocent, love thy neighbors, not their screams 
Can we all take the time to escape in the mind of the child and find. 
Who brings the joy, not the pain to our lives today 
Winter's alive, with snowflakes all around 
Towards the New Year we climb 
Hope and love our brother's now 
Then Christmas arrives, enlightens the closed mind 
Like a bridge over time. 
Like a bridge over time
