High noon at another last supper 
Dead man walking in the heat of the sun 
Full house showing on the Eve of deceit 
Shake hands with the devil 
He's a lookin' pretty sweet 

I don't wanna live forever, 
I don't wanna die for pleasure

Oh, It's just a matter of time, 'til we must say goodbye 
It's death by design 

Boardwalk empire time to roll the dice 
Knew they'd pull the trigger but you didn't think twice 
Stranglehold maniac takes the wheel 
One for the money, two for the deal 

Noone's gonna live forever, Finger print the buried treasure 

Oh, It's just a matter of time, 'til we must say goodbye 
It's death by design 

I know about the cost of living 
I've paid for my death, I paid in advance 
No war is worth a souls unforgiving 
No peace while they're all in a trance 

Oh, It's just a matter of time, 'til we must say goodbye 
It's death by design 

Death, death, death 

Your death is by design 
Your death is by design 
We're all doin' time 
Your death is by design.
