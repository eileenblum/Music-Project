Many days turned into nights , I fly through ages of my life 
I beg to differ with myself, battle pages on the shelf 
I bring the passion to my pain, I sing the madness in my brain 
I hear the wind it says goodbye, all I ever did was try 

Try to make the people smile, try myself for just a while 
Try to hide the pain I shared, try to help the hearts I spared 
Fight to make the wrong seem right, fight to make it through the night 
Fight to live among the sane, fight the demons in my brain 

Over and Over again, is it impossible my friend 
When one turned water into wine, oh these actions were divine 
But now it challenges my fate, over and over it's too late 

Many days turned into nights, as all the wrongs they turned to right 
I pledged allegiance to the pain, I lost the anger in my brain 
I kissed the wind I heard it cry, as I casually deny 
I reached for love it said goodbye, all I ever did was try 

Try to make the people smile, try myself for just a while 
Try to hide the pain I shared, try to help the hearts I spared 
Fight to make the wrong seem right, fight to make it through the night 
Fight to live among the sane, fight the demons in my brain 

Over and over again, is it impossible my friend 
When one turned water into wine, oh these actions were divine 
But now it challenges my fate, over and over it's too late 
Over and Over it's too late 
Over and Over it's too late 

Over and Over again, is it impossible my friend 
When one turned water into wine, oh these actions were divine 
But now it challenges my fate, over and over it's too late 

Its a clinical insanity 
Nothings wrong Ive done nothing wrong 
Its the essence of humanity 
Get along we can't get along 
Its the picture of a dying age 
Nothing's wrong, there is nothing wrong 
It' s hysteria from burning rage 
Nothing's wrong where do we belong
