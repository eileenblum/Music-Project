I see you, a loser
Satisfying your arrogant ego
Without knowing what side you are
Suffocated by your own sadness
And by the weakness of the soul

Trying to create the war
Blaming the others faults
Trying to create the war
Sowing the disagreements

Two Faced

I see you, a loser
Satisfying your arrogant ego
Without knowing what side you are
Walking through the easiest ways
Squashing those who value him

His envy doesn't affect me
It's like power that completes me

Shameless betrayal / Disturbed trust
False respect / Rotten character

Lies to satisfying his thirst
Thirst for hypocrisy that blinds

Two Faced
