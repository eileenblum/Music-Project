Ilive, I try, I play this game
I see, I'm stuck, I admit my mistakes
Killing myself can be an option but not a solution
The way of the truth that makes us coward
The hate which relieves the suffering
Death is the only certainty

Action / Reaction / Attack / Defense
Spread the evil and wait...
Judge and you will be judged
Show your protective hate

Protective Hate

You live, you try, you play this game
You see, you are tied up, do you accept your mistakes?
Kill yourself and you will become a weak one
Does the way of the truth make you coward?
The hate which relieves the suffering
Death is the only certainty

Past / Present / Future
Do not look backwards
Interfere in the right movement and
Pick what you've planted
Show your protective hate

Protective Hate
