The social disparities fuck up our country
The government is corrupt and unjust
Money addicted mercenaries

They abandon the poor people
And leave them starving
Dying in dirty crowed hospitals
Humble and unemployed people

This is our reality
This is our reality show

The poor and the disoriented being rejected
Being punched by the incompetent police
Who abuse their power under cocaine effects
Tormented and alterated brains

Revolted people who have nothing to lose
Murders, murders, feelings are unleashed
Innocent people brutally dying
Misery risen into the womb

The future is bleeding
Consequences of a blind and selfish system
That enriches destroying lives
This is our reality
