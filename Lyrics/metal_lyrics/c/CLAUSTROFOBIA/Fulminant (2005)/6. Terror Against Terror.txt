Can you hear screams?
Can you see blood?
My life doesn't matter
Your life doesn't matter to them
Revenge that awake our greatest fears
This is Terror against Terror

The world is in the target of the cowardice
Close the book of destiny
We have known the next chapter
Other times / Same suffering
Evolution with no limits
Step by step to hell

Keep your attention on decadence
Be hypnotized by greed and power
And at the same moment children are crying
At the same moment innocents are paying

I don't wanna be one more hostage
And kneel down before their eyes
