Dark challenges
It's not enough to exceed
You must run over
This way, the next one will be easy

Life is full of liars
It's not enought to exceed them
You must run over
One by one, day after day

Conscious and naturally insane ideas
Hate and humility struggle with the rules
War against our system
True and merciless soul

Dark challenges
Days are counted by them
Let's run over
One by one, day after day

We'll fight until the end
Disregarding the opposition
Because the envy is our fuel
And the truth reigns
