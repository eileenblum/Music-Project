The powerful ones have control
Why am I on the other side?
The human being is stupid
Politicians sons of bitches!

Dirty bitches / Traffickers / Children smoking crack

The police never respects, they whack, they bribe
Globalization of violence
Colletive hate / Colletive stress
Self-destruction / No sense

Cowardice / Diseases / Bacterias / War

Decadent humanity
Conscious minority
Thought decadence
Conscious terrorism / Planned misfortune

Virus / Misery / Paranoia / Pain

Dirty minds, mindless
Dirty confrontrations
Disorder / Decay
It is the end!
