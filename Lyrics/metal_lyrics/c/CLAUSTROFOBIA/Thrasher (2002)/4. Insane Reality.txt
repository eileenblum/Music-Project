Humanity on its knee
Day after day / Life after death
Collision  between powers
The tiredness of fight
The time won't change anybody
Insane reality

Cloistered feelings
Reflection of mind
The pain in the hearts
Incurable wounds

Signs of past
Peace that enslaves
Followers of men
Seeds of evil / Mirrors of hell
Knowledge of some
Agains the farse of lots

Show me the way / Show me the truth
