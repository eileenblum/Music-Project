In this world lost in dreams and conflicts
I feel the weight of revolt on my chest
Why can't I say what I think?
Why ignore what I see?

I bring the rage inside of me
My sorrow inside of me
I bring the cold that gets into my soul
But I've my value and I know my power

Choose your side, open your mind
Don't try close your eyes
We will get to the mature point
From the rotten seeds planted today

I bring my fear inside of me
My doubts inside of me
I bring the cold that gets into my soul
But I've my value and I know my power
