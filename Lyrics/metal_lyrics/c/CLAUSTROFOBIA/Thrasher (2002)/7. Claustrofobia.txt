Another day fight
To overcome the fear which gets me in a panic

My thoughts scare me
All I see is unknown
It seems that I'im in another world
It seems that I'm a mutant
A selfish world

I know why I'm here
Despair and hate go together
I have to control it
I have to free myself but the matter arrests me

Everybody judges you
Everybody is wrong / Am I wrong?
Nobody knows the right
I'm still arrested, no way out

Suicide is the way for lots
But they'll come back more miserable
We are here because we deserve it
We have been tested
Go ahead and free tourself from this blasphemous world
