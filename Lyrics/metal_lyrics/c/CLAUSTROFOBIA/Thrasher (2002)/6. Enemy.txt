Your coldness enriches my attitude
My tranquility preserves you
My irony is the salt in your wounds
Your hate is my fun / Your thought is egoist
You wanna test me, but I want you to fuck off

Easy mind guides me
Your life is to be false
Behind your mask, the falseness is hidden
A wretch, hypnotized

I prize the humility
The war goes on
And when we are eye for an eye
I'll tread in your head!!!
