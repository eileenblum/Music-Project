The system dictates rules
The media manipulates minds
TV is the devil's stage
Shameless brain washing

Misfortune globalization
Dominated humble people
They wanna control us affecting the weaker ones
We are in a minefield, every step can be fatal

I see the rotten future / Corrosive effect
People born revolted /  People die revolted
It is the end of the human kind

The anger in all nations
Nothings belongs to nobody
Fuck the powerful heartless ones
Fuck the corrupt ones

Rot in hell!!!

Corrosive effect / Corrosive world
Creating terrorism / Manipulation
