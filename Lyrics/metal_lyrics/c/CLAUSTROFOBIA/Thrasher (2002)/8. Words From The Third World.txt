I don't care about your selfishness
I don't care about your scorn
I don't need your forgiveness
I don't expect your changes

Words from the third world

Hell is here / There is no exit
But now I rise / Without blame
On the limit of the truth
Separating the wrong of my attitudes

I don't care about your chaotic evolution
I don't care about your secrets
I don't need to wear your masks
Don't want me to follow in your steps

Words from the third world

Fuck the pig's money
Fuck the rat's hypocrisy
Fuck the bureaucrat's ignorance
Fuck the prejudice and distrust
