Money means power
Religion means anger
Past means wars
Tomorrow means faith

Fom the human hands come the human pain
Where are the rights?!
We don't want lies

Follow no leader
Believe no politicians in their masks
Build your own way
Depend of nothing

They wanna cheat us
They wanna blindfold our eyes
Abuse and manipulation
They are created to destroy

There's blood on the streets
Violence creating violence
There will be safety nowhere
Fear will spread everywhere
Born to fight

Trying means danger
Does the death means life?
Runing away means lose
Born to fight
