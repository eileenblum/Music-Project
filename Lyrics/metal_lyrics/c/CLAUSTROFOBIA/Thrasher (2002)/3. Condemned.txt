Your thoughts are positive
Favourable ideas are around you
No one can detain your self-steem
Your power makes you grown

Don't sleep or everything will be finished
Depression will come tomorrow
You will awake fucked
Everything is against you now

Your goals are out reality
You are weak and can't fight
The day begins and you are frightened
Human being makes you angry

Don't look at yourself in the mirror
You are part of them
Feelings out of control
Be false and try to be calm

Deceive yourself
And pray / tomorrow can be worst
Cause real and unreal things
Become dreadful depressions
