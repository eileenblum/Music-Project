Welcome to the unknown future
Where rudeness will aways win
The pain makes us think
That the nightmare has just began

The power brought us misery
It'threats peace
Controls and hurts
Tears are still dropping

Everynight is in our hands
But we are not able
To rouse the consciousness
Which brings us hope
