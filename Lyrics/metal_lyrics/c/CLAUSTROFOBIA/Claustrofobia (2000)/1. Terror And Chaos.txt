Terror and chaos are our reality
What world do we live in
Controlled by a false system for violence and injustice

Police is nothing more than a bankrupt institution
Made of rotten and filthy rats
They abuse the power, they have in hands

Terror / Chaos

We are in a world of wankers
Where we protect ourselves with our hands
I wonder if it will end one day
I wonder if there will be a better world
A perfect world
A real world 
Where everybody has rights

Terror / Chaos
