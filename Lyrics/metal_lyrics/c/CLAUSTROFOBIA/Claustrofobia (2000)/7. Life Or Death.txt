Don't look back
Aways stay ahead
The way is dangerous
People die on rthe way

Don't do like the others
We must protect yourself
Death is the enemy
And you must to fight'to win

The chances of life you can reach
But death is aways trying to catch you
The way is ending
Try to control yourself

Because at the end of this way
There's a life waiting for you
The way is ending
Try to control yourself
