I can't see anything
I can't move myself
I can still breath
They think I'm dead

They cry and pray
I feel they're carring me

I can't scream
The verms are eating me alive
Help me, I'm not dead

I hear noises
I can't do anything
They are burying me alive and now...
I'm dead!!!
