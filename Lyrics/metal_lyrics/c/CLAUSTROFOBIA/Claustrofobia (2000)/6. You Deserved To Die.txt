Your love is a rotteness
Your touch is a cut, with a bloodshot
Your body is dying in hell

And uoyr scream is making me deaf

You deserved to die!!!

I'm free because you are dead
The decency of life
Is happenng again
You are becoming thin
With your brain full of shit

You deserved to die!!!
