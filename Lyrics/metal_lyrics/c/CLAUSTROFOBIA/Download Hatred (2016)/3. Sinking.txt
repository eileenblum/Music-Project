The human race lost their spirit
Not used to preserve life
Every minute a step to failure
Every day a step towards the end

Generalized world infection - mutation of chaos

The human race lost their spirit
Not used to preserve life
Every minute a step to failure
Every day a step towards the end

We live in a decay of moralism
Hypocrisy turns into a pandemic state

Sinking

The good brings storm
The bad suffocates hope
The good brings love

Reflection of the present - mirror of reality
Sensitive like a castle made of sand
Masters of rotten heritage
Nobody can stop natures revenge

Refusal and humiliation
Satisfaction happiness
Indignation and depression
Fire in the sky - blood on your fucking hands
Easy road for blind pigs
Hidden unconscious peace

Sinking
