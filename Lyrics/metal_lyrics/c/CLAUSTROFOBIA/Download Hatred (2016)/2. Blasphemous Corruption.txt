âRebellious war against this shameless clusterâ

Blasphemous corruption
Motherfucking leaders
Dear politicians, your tricks are the fuel for my disgust
Dear pastors, your flock is hungry and your souls are lost
We wanna rip your throat, drink your blood and walk away

Pride and self-esteem disintegrates
Fearless Iâll thrive through decadence
My guard is up and in my mind there is no regret

We wanna wake up not smelling your infamous stench
I wanna piss on your images and shit on your desk
Iâll wipe my ass with your dirty money and wash your soul with unholy water

Freedom of speech an evident weapon
Perspectives are clashing on this troubled society
The lack of options doesn't mean surrender

No place for heroes - the crowd is furious
The factory of dreams is a stillborn disease
The suicidal industry keeps on growing â growing and growing

Pride and self-esteem disintegrates
Fearless Iâll thrive through decadence
My guard is up and in my mind there is no regret

Angels are dismissed while evil insist
The wild west is here
Blasphemous corruption
