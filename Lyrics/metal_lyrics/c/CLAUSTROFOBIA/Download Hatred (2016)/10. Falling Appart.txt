Same old days, same old lies
Disillusion and tiredness are one
Heaven never answers, hell is calling you
Our daily bread is filled with blood

There is no serenity in corrupt causes
Soulless people ignore victory and defeat
Behind the masks, there is no life
Behind the curtains, the truth comes out

Money can buy life and death, spreading greed
Drowning the good in a sea of shit

Falling apart
âvida loka" e caos desde o principio
Falling apart

The earth cries and the last flame is slowly dying
The ground trembles, my heart beats fast
Violent culture, bloody media
My eyes are petrified

Choose your weapon, but choose life
Dream like a fool, live like a madman
