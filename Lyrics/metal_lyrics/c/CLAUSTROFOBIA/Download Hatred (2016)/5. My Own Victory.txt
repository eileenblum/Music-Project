I can feel that hate coming and dominating
It's a protective hate that keeps my faith
Fearless, I face it like warrior covered in blood
Maggots, those liars will never get in my heart

I win
March with the struggle
I must win
Kick off the troubles

This is a trek - that's the fact
Iâll fight and thrive without thinking about the past
To get the right attitude
So come on, join me now, let's win this fucking battle, dude!

I win
March with the struggle
I must win
Kick off the troubles

I don't give a fuck for those who donât believe me
Nobody is perfect and that's why I love life
Iâll respect everyone for their true eagerness
Making my aura even more powerful forever

We will die learning

I win
My own victory
