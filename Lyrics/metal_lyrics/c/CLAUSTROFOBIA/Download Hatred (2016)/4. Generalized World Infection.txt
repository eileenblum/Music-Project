... And it is done to perfection
Be prepared for another day of fighting
Feel the pleasure to stay alive
Feel â breathe â listen
It is not religion - it is not a cancer
New true blood â dirty old minds â armored bones
Bringing sight to the blind

Generalized world infection

You are scared and have nowhere to go
You think you are safe but in your head there's a maze

Power pressure - world infection
No direction to the core
Strange dimension - prompt dementia
Projected to hold no allure
Open your eyes - give it a chance to shine
Or else start digging your own hole and be ready to die

People fear people - animalized xenofobia
We have arrived in this world - generalized claustrophobia

Victimized consuming prick â son of this infected system
Stand up and try to see through this toxic disease
Stagnated - dominated - deleted - infected
Hear the sound of the world connected

But we are here to clarify
Break the shell of your self slavery
Now we are in command
Raise your head- look around you
The antidote is attitude
