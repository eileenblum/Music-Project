Bloodstained victories
Carrying a bomb in the uterus
Apocalyptic life beliefs
Taking away the shine of existence
Opportunistic system
Regressing against evolution

Impalement is what they deserve
Punishment for what they have done
Exterminate, seize their race
Lacerate and burn their members

Closet abusers
Whole life devoted to their shame
Cults are digging their own grave
Inverted faith out of control euphoria
Unresolved savageness
Perversity is their mania

Impalement is what they deserve
Punishment for what they have done
Exterminate, seize their race
Lacerate and burn their members

Cureless disease â show no mercy
