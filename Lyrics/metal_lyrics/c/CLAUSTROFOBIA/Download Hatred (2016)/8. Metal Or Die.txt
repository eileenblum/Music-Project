Metal 'til the bone true to the core
A life devoted to an electric madness
High voltage flowing through my veins
In your face â blood will reign

"Claustruth legions â feelings are spit out from inside
Getting higher on fire
Killer times â metal or die"

Hated fucking posers
Crush them all â fashionable trends of shit
We'll resist it
Burn coward burn
Loyal bloody troopers on the front line
Where the roots of the damned hate arise
A notion that there's no need to describe

Chosen path arise â honor of death
The truth is the only way to crossover
Vital fight against endless lies
Eternal conquerors of pure power

Claustruth legions â feelings are spit out from inside
Getting higher on fire
Killer times â metal or die

"Respect the real followers â they can not be denied
Krisiun â Slayer â Maiden â Sabbath
So many reason to exist â good old times
Hail Napalm Death â the enemy of the music business â yeah
Praise Hanneman â evil riffs â loyal to your legacy
Sepultura in my heart"

Claustruth legions â feelings are spit out from inside
Getting higher on fire
Killer times â metal or die

[Dedicated to Jeff Hanneman]
