Best temptation
Guided brain - possessed by pain
No weapons to fight - i'm not quiet ready to die
Sweet hell on earth - devotion to nothing
Addiction to lust - totaly strange
Nearly insane - covered by dust

The greatest temptation is before me
Another me â unknown dimension

High depression - suffering pleasure
The taste of error - carnal masterpiece
Enjoying the agony in a sea of feelings
Hurricane of bliss
Storm blasts madness
This is all i need

The greatest temptation is before me
Crossed paths - close enough to get it

Stronger than me - from nightmares to sweet dreams
Torments created by its own covet
Slave of torment

Sick reality â in a state of blindness
Starting to pray â not to become the prey
The return is iminent
The demon sleeps sometimes

The devil's lionâ seeking perfection
Fallen angels from a black sky
