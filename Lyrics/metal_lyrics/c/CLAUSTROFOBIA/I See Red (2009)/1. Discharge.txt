Hypocrisy that we call life
Life is the enemy of the soul
I already chose my side
If frustated ones want my space
They must wait for the chance to be born again
I'm alive as always, keeping my feet on the ground

Faith doesn't alleviate itself
In reality I seek something in my favor
Silence is what judges
Conscience is its own witness

If I see, hear and feel
I cannot deny and hide

I'm the spirit of survival
Exposed to defeat, but sure of the victory

Their honor is a castle made of sand
Their tongue is shapened
And I'm gonna cut it with their own sword
I feed off their weakness

Living at the limit, I cultivate my force
My soul bleeds, but doesn't get tired
Memories fade slowly
Scars never disappear

If I swim in a sea of shit
I won't complain and sink
