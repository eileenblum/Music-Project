Decree of the hostile survival

Rulers control the rage and the peace
Your safety at risk
Destinies are treated as business
Disposable live, used and manipulated

Fake leaders watch the slaughter
The destruction plans are summed up
The more blood that's shed, the sooner you'll be dead?
Or else the end can be the beggining

Sick fanaticism / cheap sacrifice
Minds like a minefield

Alienated, the flock continues grazing
Because the rebellion threatens any type of power
Your war is not my war
Your god turns you weak and dominated

He asks for revenge and shows no mercy
It's the faith stepping on the minefield
