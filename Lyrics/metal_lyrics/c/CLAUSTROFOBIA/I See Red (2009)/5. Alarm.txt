Disseminate the present
Open the innocent's eyes
Value your roots
Don't let the future rot

Absolutely explicit promiscuity
Hypnotizing our children
Criminals in the name of god
Heartless greedy ones

Determination to win dishonestly
Feel the scars of your souls
Evil is appealing
Stay away from trends

Deteriorated dreams
Defeats - lack and weakness blend

Envy is born

Envy that sets fire in your body
Spits to put it out and watches your soul vanish
Without a soul, you don't exist

Start to rot
