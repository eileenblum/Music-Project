Into the cage like an animal
You must survive - kill or die
Learning to be a criminal
Prepare to suffer - for life

No one has anything to lose
The sentence has already been declared
Follow the prisioner's rules,
Or live under a death threat

Living among walls and bars,
Spreading rotteness inside the cage
Contagious diseases spread
Accumulating bitterness and hatred

Studying at the evil university
You learn the violent culture
To attack society

Eating trash and drinking rat piss
Feeling the pleasure of indifference
Low self-esteem increases - suicide? No!

The hell's flame doesn't burn anymore

Taking a blood shower
Breathing evil's virus
Polluted soul
You prefer to kill / you must kill
Disease is a privilege

Heads are trophier
Rebellion is a party
And the escape is the virus liberty

Failed system,
Teaching savagery
Twisted scientists,
Creating human atomic bombs
