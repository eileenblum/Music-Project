We slipped through space away from sun
In darkest place there is no dawn
We didn't know where is our home
We saw a glow then you had come
This bright moment left hope in us. Our blindness gone,
We soared to stars. A life should born where we belong

I am your blood! I am your vice!
I am what you sacrifice!
Earth abandoned, earth is bleeding
Planet is taking last breath nevertheless "Jesus" plays poker and chess

Above the surface away from earth place
Collapsed and drowned
Forgotten ocean, beckoning water in our dream
And silence cries
This endless journey â how long it took us? We couldn't tell
This dark horizon is always on our way. It never ends.

Surrounded by a veiled abyss on the bottomless universe covered by the endless night
Alone in the howling darkness where myriad stars are choking in despair
Confine to illuminate, they fly by with hiss. Darkness salutes you!
The firmament is black!

Ages are coming through nothing left but stars in haze
Humanity lost a point of view, their path is lost, they failed as race
