Wandering through forest covered by night
Inhaling this beauty of untouched. No man, nor sin.
Where all creatures are so divine, I met her eyes, filled with sadness.
And she told me why

It was a beautiful place to live, no man inside
A wind caressed us with its warmth, so did tides
There was a cruel god who dreamt to steal my heart
I loved with pure heart the one who was for me
But youth of child heart revealed my secrecy
They killed the one I loved and hatred came to me
They ruined a place (where) we lived, without sympathy

Frozen I stood, mesmerized by wound, it has so much pain
How they could do such thing to this beautiful nature?
She awoke my feelings that required healing of my poisoned heart
And she lifted up my spirit, above stars we inherit all kingdom of God!

All reveals to us, ever man desired. This kingdom, this creation, untouched by man.
A new land for a new life without them. So promised, so divine, no sin inside and peace for all eternityâ¦
