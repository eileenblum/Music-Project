Sleep far away from reality, broken glass, spilled wine
Escape from mortality, searching for potion of blindness

When you see me you are enchanted
When I am touching you, your heart fades
Then I am kissing you with my cold lips
And I am taking you under the ocean's waves

When you call I wake up to see a pain you are through
Hatred burns with a bright flame you enchant like sorcerers do
When I fall you appear and reach your hand to me
Spells of magic, fly over the night to make your kingdom free

Silent waves, lying on a shore, so deep is wound of mine cries no more
Empty stare, am I healed? Beckoning waterâ¦ to drown me in

I put spells on you and show the ocean
It hides the secrets of many drowned
I carry you on my shoulders
Cursed kiss is given to wake you up

You put spells on me and showed the ocean
It hides the secrets of many drowned
Myriads of souls you tookâ¦ timeless devotion
To make your kingdom free, to brace your crown
