Crimson delight of dawn is covered this place with its grace
Before they come to reveal, take off a veil from her face
I won't forget her screams and anger in her eyes
But finally they are replaced by joy at that very night

And finally I see your eyes my child, please don't cry
Please, please don't cry any more
I won't be forgotten memory will stay
No tear I will drop, just laughing all the way

Anger tears my heart it penetrates my veins
Destruction, misery and hunger lead to grave
Another war has paced, left burning stakes behind
No mercy we shall show all man must die

Reach me a hand my black raven
Put me under your wing!
Lead me away from temptation
Carry me away across black sea
Looking through the eyes of blind, I wonder,
If a man can give all his sins on fire through your suffering
Will he understand there is no worst devil but man!

Flame caresses my feet while wind howls, calling a mist
I widely spread my wings
Earth is planted by spoiled seed man's heart is corrupted by lies from within
Deceiver leads the sheep to slaughter house
Let them be the slaves! Ha ha ha
Let them be the slaves of devil!
Let them be the slaves of devil,
Let them be the slaves of devil!
The devil that man! That man is devil himself!
