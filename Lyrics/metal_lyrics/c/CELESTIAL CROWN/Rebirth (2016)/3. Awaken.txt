A day has come to reveal a path
Where no-one walked beneath black stars

Beneath black stars darkness shines with its radiance
In that pitch black holes where light was born
Dark souls swirl around search for substances
Which gives a life to world, to its serenity
And darkness bleeds, gives a birth
To myriad lives, to brand new earth

A day has come to reveal a path
Where no-one walked beneath black stars
