Total collapse and you see nothing but another planet stopped its existence
Can you see these myriads of parts are crossing this universe,
At reckless speed they disappear without a trace
Left alone, breathless. How could it happen to us? No! Doomed!

Squalor, ruins this is all that smoke left behind,
Scorched earth, no soil for any plant
Just ashes and fire take over control
Where night lives there is no place for sunlight
Amidst the darkest holes
We try to find a bright side

There ascends the sun. It makes all stars do shine anew!
This glorious moment comes
You start to feel your life anew!
Burning horizon fades, it brings to us new day to see
New era comes in its place,
The sun's strength reveals to me!

Gazing demise crawls behind us, waiting for a moment
To clasp us in its void to dissolve us in a chaos

Left alone, breathless... How could it happen to us? No!
We are doomed! This planet wasn't ours!

Failed in life, dancing in the flames under acid rains,
Loosing hope inside
Broken dreams never to fulfill,
Only promises are carried by devoured crimson winds
