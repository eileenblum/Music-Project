Night descends to fall, to embrace your soul
Darkness within commands to sin
Nature awakes, it breathes, it inhales, it laughs at men and men are failed
To look inside the heart of the blind to see their tears, to hear their fears
They saw too much in this cruel life, their faith is broken, words unspoken

Wandering alone covered in snow, trying to see a hope in me
So cold inside, my soul demise, a final fight breaks it into pieces

Night descends to fall, to embrace your soul
Darkness within commands to sin
Nature awakes, it breathes, it inhales, it laughs at men and men are failed

Look inside the heart of the blind and see
See their tears their fears, kneeled before thee

Winter wars in your heart, makes your soul to be cold
And it runs in your blood with its devious art
In blurry night no strength to fight
So cold inside, my soul demise

Pale reflection of God laughs at you from above
Even he on his knees begging nature to pity
Life is so unveiled to man who wants to prevail
But it's false visionary â all man die in misery
