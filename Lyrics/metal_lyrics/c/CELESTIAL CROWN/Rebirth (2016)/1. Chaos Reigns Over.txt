In your image and your likeliness
From the chaos we were sired
You gave us heartland of the universe
In your name we kill and die!
Don't you see how they ruin everything around them?
Don't you ever try to stop it all, to put it to its end?
Why do you still care about these soulless vessels?
How can't you see or might be you are dead?
So many planets left no trace
So much suffering brings human race
From above I watch the end of entire civilization
In my eyes reflect a dust of what you called creation
Through myriads of empty stares, in a place where stars always glare
I behold this great empire before it falls
How can you even dare to give all these planets to wasted dead
I watched through ages how my sweet heaven falls

Desert ashes of humanity
Faded shadows of mankind
Swept away into eternity
All hopes and dreams we left behind

Judge their lives, play their faiths they are no one and always will be none
Play your game until this fire burns, watch darkness and tremble, humble wait for my return

So many planets left no trace
So much suffering brought human race
From above I watched how you create a world of sin and I smile when I see
In this game the death could the only who wins

This darkness runs from far to fill with its bliss their bleeding scars
It's time to revive all shattered stars
How can you even dare to give all these planets to wasted dead
I watched through ages how my sweet heaven falls
Chaos reigns over!
