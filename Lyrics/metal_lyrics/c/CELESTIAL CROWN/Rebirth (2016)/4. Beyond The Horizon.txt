The heavens burned, the stars cried out
and under the ashes of infinity, hope, scarred and bleeding,
breathed its last
Come bitter rain and wash from my heart
that saddest of all words: home

Welcome twilight! Welcome blackness!
Welcome inky night! Only in darkness
Can I see my soul?

Between birth and death lies desire. Desire for life, for love,
Screams of a billion murdered
Stars give lie to the night's peace,
While we cling in desperation to the source of this bearing suffering abyss

Soul is more than the sky is deeper than the ocean
In her desperate eyes die all my emotions

When the sun is far away
All the paths lead astray
Take a glance into my soul and see horizon fades
Illusions gone, no hope inside and hollow night awaits

Welcome twilight! Welcome blackness!
Welcome inky night! Only in darkness
Can I see my soul?
