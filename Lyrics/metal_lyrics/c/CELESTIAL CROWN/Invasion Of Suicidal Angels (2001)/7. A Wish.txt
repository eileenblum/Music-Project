I try to imagine that you are here
But it's just delusion you were not here
Too many wounds you afflict upon me
Your love was nothing you will soon see

This is my lovelorn rhapsody is killing me
It is my depression of you and it's too killing me

I often see a flight of a lone dove
With his wings spread he flies in the sky above
As he I want to be free to fly away from you
But I have no wings my dream can't come true

So let me close my eyes for-good
Two dying roses you will see in blood
They will show you my way sky-high
And you will see why I still want to die

Why I still want to die...

I feel the sunset of my life
Too young to die
Still I feel my God
He often sighs
His tears fall on me from his sky
A wish to be with him
I wish to die-I wish to die

So let me close my eyes for-good
Two dying roses you will see in blood
They will show you my way sky-high
And you will see why I still want to die

To die with hope to leave this place
Never to see your laughable face
To die in the night never to see
A crying angel bleeding in me

A crying angel (My crying angel)
This is my suicidal angel killing me
Living in me!!!
