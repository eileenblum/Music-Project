On holy waters I had once been
And tore the flower, succumbed to sin
I didn't know what legend says
Smell of temptation How long did it take?

On Holy Waters A Beast Returns
On Holy Waters As Legend Says

On holy waters a beast will return
When Flower of Sin will be torn
By man who can't be able to resist
The spells of temptation to turn him to beast

On Holy Waters A Beast Returns
On Holy Waters As Legend Says

On holy waters I had once been
And tore the flower, succumbed to sin

On Holy Waters A Beast Returns
On Holy Waters As Legend Says

I didn't know what legend says
Smell of temptation took me on the sin way

On Holy Waters A Beast Returns
On Holy Waters As Legend Says

On holy waters I had once been
And tore the flower, succumbed to sin
I am that man who couldn't resist
The spells of temptation turned me to beast

[August 99]
