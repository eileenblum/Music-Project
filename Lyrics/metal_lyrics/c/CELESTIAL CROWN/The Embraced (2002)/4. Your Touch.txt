When the light is fading away, a darkness comes
A fear of the Night calls the Angels of the Dark
They fly over me, warning me that You arise
Then they're gone in her breath silence keeps
My lonely cries

I'm dying with the deepest wound in my heart
Pain doesn't go away it stays with me forever
Love died left me alone in your embrace
Your cold touch takes me to Your Heaven

Your realm You show me in our flight
Angels bow their heads when You go past
Your beauty rules me I'm all yours
When You talk to me I lust for You more
Behind the gates I was in bliss it's sweet
The Angels back again to tell me what I really
Need

Your Kiss is frozen I fall asleep
Your Face still haunts me in my crypt
Their words they speak with tongue of mine

"HUMAN LOVE IS NOTHING
BESIDE HER KISS"

I am forever searching for the rest
Within Your Bliss

With the first Sun's rays the visions die
You left me even never said goodbye
But I will always be waiting for the day
When You Come
A beauty of darkness in my heart I carved...
A SEAL OF THE DARKNESS REMINDS
ME OF OUR LOVE

Night's gone for a while but I hope to meet
You again
Life closed for me left behind forever
You live in my dreams make me dream again
Of Your Cold Touch Which Takes Me To Your Heaven

[January 97]
