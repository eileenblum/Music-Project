You are on a way, leaving me in a flood of emotions
spluttered me with wild voluptious dance
Illumining the sky with a crimson dawn
And still drunk with dusk and your embrace I lie beyond Lord's Grace
Enshrouded with your black velvet lace

As Light burns my flesh to make me fall on my knees
A final scream of return before it makes my soul to descend to the bowels of 
the abyss

[June 2000]
