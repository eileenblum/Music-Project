With the approaching of the night, with the setting of The Sun
when The Dusk fills up the emptiness of the world with its Grace
I invoke to you for help to be again on Your dark side
It's a dream of every lovelorn man to dance under the moon of naked night

Come to me!Dress me with your dark body!
Take me in the desert of the night!
Dark thoughts of you they don't leave me
I am ready for the dance tonight

Beauty Venus is floating,presenting Her love to me
In this dance I feel whole her Love it grows deep inside of me

In a wild swirl I glide through the night
this dark caress!
Oh this dark dance!

Son of mine! She calls me, yeah I know
I wear a dark dress that I can walk in Her Realm
She has a daughter that will soon be mine
Night in its bloom I dance with queen!
