Snow crunches under the feet,glittering in the moonlight
Thoughts of You blacken me with solitude immortality
Be the one of them, be embraced by you
It's my will

Guided by mysterious forces I go there where they dance
Soulless shadows on a cold wind of winter
Will you take me with your reverance?

Whiteness of snow a vision of beauty in the blue of moonlight
A light blue shadow whispers me words make me feel my fright
Drops of blood after Her kiss a feel of languor lust for more
My fright has gone in a mist and she who makes me feel no sore

Falling snow on my face dissolves with my blood
sparkling on a pale jaded face - Seduction of The Sad

Surrounded their glare a scream on a cold winter wind
Images of Holy are losing their lusters,seeing these dances
Even Death can't be compared
Lusting for the end through Her Kiss I'm standing here enchanted by the blue 
of moonlight
and keeping dancing till my last breath dies

Beauty have I seen you before? Was I charmed as now?

No-one loved me before with such passion as you do
No-one kissed me before that I lose all my strength,falling in bliss
and on next day was waiting for...

And again with an appearance of Moon I hear their screaming moans
And again the light falls down on me The Grace of Dance on the whiteness of snow
"Who are you Mistress? Beauty outside
Tell me your caprice ruled by beast inside"
Why after your caresses I am feeling a pain, which assuages your caprices makes me lust
For You again
With more passion I ever had, your seduction I've tasted sweet poison within
My veins were emptied by you and it led me to my grave

Mysterious forces push me there where they dance
Soulless shadows on a cold wind of winter

Snow crunches under the feet, glittering on the moonlight
Thoughts of You blacken me with solitude immortallity
Be the one of them Be embraced by you
You fulfilled My Will

Whiteness of snow, a vision of beauty in the blue of moonlight
A light blue shadow whispers me words make me feel no fright anymore
Drops of blood after Her kiss, feel no pain just already ready for this
DARKLY EROTIC IS IT YOU REVEALED TO ME TODAY?
