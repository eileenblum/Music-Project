Are you a man or a woman or neither?
Are you alone or connected or neither?
Are you unlovable or loveable or neither?
Are you unworthy or worthy or neither?

Are you defined, undefined or neither?
Are you complete, incomplete or neither?
Are you powerful, or powerless or neither?
Are you unlimited or limited or neither?

What does the word adequate even mean?
What does the word organized even mean?
Do you exist, not exist or neither?
Darkness and emptiness appear to go on forever!
