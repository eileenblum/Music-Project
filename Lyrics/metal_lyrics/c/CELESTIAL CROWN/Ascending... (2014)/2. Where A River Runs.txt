Who knows the secret? Who proclaimed it here? The Gods themselves came later into being.
What covered all? What sheltered? What concealed? Was it the waterâs fathomless abyss?
There a river runs with our tears in its waters.
In its decadence, chaos dances with our shadows.
In our dance we are dancing wild as in a cradle of heaven sleeps celestial child.
Darkness caresses him guarding his peaceful sleep. Lightâs inhaling in him a golden breath to live.

There a river runs with our spirits in its waters.
In its radiance, chaos dances with our shadows
Whether His Will created or was mute? The Most Higher Seer knows it â or may be not!
The last Vibration of the Eternity thrills through Infinitude.
It sweeps along, touching with its swift wing whole Universe and the Child that
dwelleth in Darkness: The Darkness that breathes over the slumbering Waters of Lifeâ¦
There a river runs with our souls in its waters.
In its dark great dance, chaos swells with our shadows
While the only One sleeps seeing azure pure dreams
Whoâd know from whence this great creation comes?
Darkness radiates Light And Light drops one solitary Ray
Into the Depths of the Ocean of Life.

There a river runs with our spirits in its waters.
In its radiance, chaos dances with our shadows
The Root of Life was in every Drop of the Ocean of Immortality
And the Ocean was Radiant Light, which was Fire, and Heat, and Motion.
Darkness vanished and was no more! It disappeared in its own Essence,
The Body of Fire and Water.
There a river runs with our essence in its waters.
The blazing web of light is sewed of our shadows
