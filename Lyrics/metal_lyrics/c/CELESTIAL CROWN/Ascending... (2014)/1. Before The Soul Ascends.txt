Hold your breath â feel what dwells within. Be beholder of your thoughts and dreams.
Donât look back, take a bright voyage. Into mind of yours and fulfill your dreams.
Donât resist to force that awakes in you. Let it grow inside,
to ascend and sweep along.
Donât look back, take a bright voyage. Into mind of yours and fulfill your dreams.
Let the visions flow before your clear sight. Donât afraid of them,
they will lead your flight.
To your own world - understand the truth. Who you are and
Where are you from?
Whatâs your destiny and where is your home?
Who are you? Where are you from? Whatâs your destiny?
Where is your home?
Do you see? Do you see the truth? Does it frighten you?
Is it charming you?
Can you touch the one? Can you reach the one?
Can you feel the one? And the one is you!!!
How could you dare?
Calm down your breath. Look with deep attention in your own heart.
Heed to its silent voice.
Through your heart there comes a light. Illuminate your life,
make it clear for your eyes.
Before the ear will hear, it should lose the sensitivity.
Before your eyes will see, they should be inaccessible to tears.
Before the soul ascends, it should be washed by the blood of heart.
Before the voice can talk, it should lose ability to bring a pain.
How could you dare to possess it?
