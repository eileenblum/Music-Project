Fire turns into air then it flies asunder in the void of air.
Donât digress! Donât rejoice! Itâs a moment, moment of your death!
Keep the clearance of your thoughts! Let your love become passionless!
Avoid dissipation! Be on the point! Look out! Listen! Be careful!
Inconceivable expanse will open wide before you, shoreless
Like an ocean without waves under serene sky
Donât digress! Donât rejoice! Itâs a moment, moment of your death!
Keep the clearance of your thoughts! Let your love become passionless!
Soon you will breathe out with your last breath Until it ends then an eternal open light you see
Inconceivable expanse will open wide before you, shoreless like an ocean without waves
under serene sky
Be careful! Donât rush! Donât fear! You are already dead! Understand it and
donât stick to the past!
Donât irritate feelings! Donât let them happened and swallow you up!
To the dangerous places can bring you the waves of experience. Be on the point!
Take a look around with a kind sight there light will be before you
Like a blazing mirage playing and blinding you inside light you can hear thunders.
You are now in the pre-eternal light. Try to keep this state what you are feeling right now!
Donât digress! Donât rejoice! Itâs a moment of your death!
Keep the clearance of your thoughts! Let your love become passionless!
Itâs the sounds, sounds of last essence
Donât fear! Nothing can harm you! Keep the clearance of your thoughts!
Keep the clearance there are no you!
Soon you will breathe out with your last breath, until it ends then an eternal open light you see
Inconceivable expanse will open wide before you,
shoreless like an ocean without waves under serene sky
