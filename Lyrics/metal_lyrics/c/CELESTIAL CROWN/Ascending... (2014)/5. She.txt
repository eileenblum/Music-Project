Among the worlds and twinkling of stars, one star I repeat the name of
Not because for me she is the only one Instead of her with others
I am languished
And if I take a doubt seriously, only from her I wait for an answer.
Not because she gives a light to me
There is no light need with her.

Another day leaves a scar on me. Calmness is brought by nightfall
Her radiance is all I see. It shines in my eyes when I fall.
So end my day with grief in a prayer. A dream of star for me to appear.
So end my pain I am tired of fear. There is no life when she is not here.

There is no need in light when I am with her
And every time I find the emptiness that eats me.
