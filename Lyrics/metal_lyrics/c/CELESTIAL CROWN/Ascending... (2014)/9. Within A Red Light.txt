It's time of oblivions
Eternal Light shone on you, but you were, as a body under the sun, lying on a clay in the lack of feeling.
You did not know about what happened to you.
Now, waking up, no need to remember - you are changed a lot
Everything has changed, and you became one.
Do not look in the mirror! You'll see those things which are not seen
You'll hear those sounds which are not like terrestrial
This light is so bright, so terrible its flame
Itâs a day of red flame where wisdom and thoughts reign!
This is - you're in your inseparability
And terribly, dreadfully admit that became like this!
Look straight into the sparkling flames! Be not afraid and accept fire in yourself!
This light is so bright, so terrible its flame
Itâs a day of red flame where wisdom and thoughts reign!
