Hell will come for a sinner to swallow him at dinner
with a vast open mouth where dark light flows where it takes a source
The clear, pure white flame shines so bright,
so blinding that eyes hurt when they look at him.
A smoky black light mixed with a bright white light,
this agate color of light is Hell itself and Evil.
Your path will be interrupted for a long time and very sad way.
If you get scared and run - found yourself in a ravine, at the dread
cliff, from where there is no path.
Three abyss will cut you the way, strengthen yourself - nothing and no one can hurt you here
on the fact, but you must believe.
Hell will come for a sinner to swallow him at dinner
with a vast open mouth where dark light flows where it takes a source
The clear, pure white flame shines so bright,
so blinding that eyes hurt when they look at him.
A smoky black light mixed with a bright white light
this agate color of light is Hell itself and Evil.
Unnerved man will rush here and there, seeing in the distance
and the dome of the temple, rush there. Then he will be thrown to the earth,
to ashes, to his grave.
From any strong feelings eclipsed consciousness, then again you wake up
already in a clean place ...
Despair seizes you, so does helplessness. You must do something!
This will torment the idea. This false alarm - there is Nothing to do.
On the contrary, to deepen into inaction, freeze and calm down, if you can.
