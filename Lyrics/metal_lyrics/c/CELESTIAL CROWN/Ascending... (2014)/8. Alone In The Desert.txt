Horror has overtaken me. Fever has crept over me.
Tears have blinded my eyes. Strength has left my decrepit body.
I hear nothing - I understand nothing. Except relentless loud wind blowing.
It sings about death. It cries about dying hopes
This is the end I feel its approach
Hope has died in me, Spirit has tired to war. I see nothing just visions haunt my tired mind
Eyes blind, lying in desert alone
I feel it comes, it paces slowly to me, No face I see, just feel its presence
It sings about death. It cries about dying hopes. This is the end I feel its approach.
Hold tight for things that have no substance. Hold tight for things that out of existence
Heed only to my voice which speaks without any sound. Look only at the things that are invisible for feelings.
Concealed secret is kept for you over the aeons. Occult mystery is stored for you over the centuries!!!
