[Music By A. Shelepenkin, Lyric By D. Volynkin]

So ends a day,
Life flows in its way
Night soon will come
We all be gone!
For all eternity just stay with me
In flames of night so far from light
Inside my dream - my forlorn realm
Without a crown - dead on the thrown
No sympathy for the failed one
Just enemies to strike again!
Demons in a fall ask for sold out souls
Sadness grows again to invoke my pain
Visions of suicide of those thousands lives
So it comes again for the end of the days
Existence loses the point of living
A living leads to suicide
Suicide is a mortal sin in religion
So Crown should be upon The Kingdom Of Light!
I wear A Crown
For The End Of The Days
In My Forlorn Realm,
I Ascend The Thrown
So Let Angels Weep
For The End Of The Days
For all eternity you could stay with me
My fallen Son - My Lucifer
Inside my dream - my forlorn realm
Without a crown - dead on the thrown
No sympathy for the failed one
Just enemies to strike again!
So Let Angels Weep
For The End Of The Days
Father! Why do you make bleeding
My ached suffered heart?
Nightmare? Am I dreaming?
Do I lose My Crown?
Demons in a fall ask for sold out souls
So it comes again for the end of the days
