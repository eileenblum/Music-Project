[Music By A.Shelepenkin, Lyric By D. Volynkin]

Silently I stand by the night waters that have taken your life from you
Silently I wait for the sign of the dark waters may be tonight they let talk to you
And if they wash me up your dead body I clasp it to my breast for kiss
And you will see my bleak story
In love I was failed - For love I did fall
In a kiss you will see how deep was that love that I failed in loving with her
That crimson night was like a night in a gales it tore me, my heart and my passion to Her
I stood alone till wind's howled her name, no tears, just pain was my heart
Christ's forbidden that love and in love I was failed - All Saints did forbid my love
And my screams were resounded As Christ took my love from (me)
All Saints were starring at me
And for selling my soul Devil promised her soul
As Christ's words were told - "In Love You Were Failed - For Love You Do Fall"
Black velvet waters keep silent tonight
I walk alone by the shore surrounded by moonlight
My thoughts of you and I'm calling to you
But silently waters drag me to its bottom from you
And my screams were resounded As Christ took my love from (me)
All Saints were starring at me
And for selling my soul Devil promised her soul
As Christ's words were told - "In Love You Were Failed - For Love You Do Fall"
Tiny candles left burning by the wind which was howling in a place where my love was for Her
With a pulse of a dawn Christ had come to make burning Her Soul and forbid my love
With my screams I was falling from Heaven I called Her I tore up from my neck a cross
And for this I was cursed with damnation for Heaven All I wished All Christendom to flames for Her Loss
All this pain will grow into deep wound and will never. Never! Go away from my heart
I will keep it inside till time comes and Heaven be frighten an appear of night
I release from the chains! The chains that all years chained my heart full of Her
By the night I descend in a fog upon mankind - to find and embrace - Resurrected Her Soul!!!
