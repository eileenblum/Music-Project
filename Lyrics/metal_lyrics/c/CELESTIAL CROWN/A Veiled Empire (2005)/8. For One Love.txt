[Music By D. Volynkin &amp; A. Shelepenkin, Lyric By D. Volynkin]

My Sun don't leave me now
I can't abide this pain
I don't want to stay alone again
How she can't understand
That she hurts me more
Going from me away
I lived for one love I lived for her
I just want to be loved nothing more
But she left me I remember that day
My Sun please help me please ease my pain
My Sun give me your rays
Don't leave me alone
My Sun don't go from me
I know she will return
I couldn't believe she has gone
I stayed alone I want to run
To run nowhere away from here
To you my Sun Take me from here
My Sun you are my lord now
I'm your hopeless angel
Never let me fall down
I'm sitting on the clouds
Looking at down
I've caught the hopes in my hands
But I lose them now
My Sun give me your rays
Don't leave me alone
My Sun don't go from me
I know she will return
Your rays caress me every day
But every night I look at my grave
May be at one day she will return to this bleak place
To look at the blue sky ceiling to see my crying face

[Spring 1997]
