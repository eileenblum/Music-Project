[Music By D. Volynkin &amp; S. Vlassov, Lyric By D. Volynkin]

"What is life? What should I expect from it? Tell me!"
Life is just a moment, a short period of time. You don't have to regret
Sometimes we fail, sometimes we not. But more often we don't recognize how it's passing us by.
Just let a dream cover you
"I understand what you mean. These moments given by life - that's a point of a living."
Yes they are.
Short periods of time to understand the meaning
That every moment is a dream and every dream is a pearl of sea.
In a sea of life we are drowning.
