I held you once 
I held your body in this room within ourselves 
we were compelled to come apart 
so full of adoration just for you 
not just a metaphor, an omen 

We live in shadows 
We are hunted, hunted by the prey now. 

I saw the ones (I saw your folly) 
I saw the ones who came to you a show-and-tell 
the truth you sell has lost its spark 
complete my violation, IÊ¼m cut in two 
not just a metaphor, IÊ¼m broken. 

We live in shadows
We are hunted, hunted by the prey now.

We are hunted, hunted by the prey now.
We are wasted thoughts of yesterday. Fuck the world!
