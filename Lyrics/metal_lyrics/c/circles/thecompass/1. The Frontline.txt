Watch me as my sight is grey
convinced your scars are dissimilar
come alive to be enslaved 
chasing stars as they fall

Slavery 
sing your favourite lullabies
we are casualties 
singing 'til the day we die

Watch as your unique mark fades 
itÊ¼s gone so fast the moment has passed
subjugated to the flames 
still trapped behind the wall

Fading brightly we collide 
feeding knowledge to the wise 
as we mourn the sunshine 
shadow people slowly are revealed

You think you need the sunshine
weÊ¼re the frontline 
in the great below 
It's in your command.
