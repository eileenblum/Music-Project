Grey was the day I saw the truth
games I have played embracing you

Something to love forever, IÊ¼m chasing 
youÊ¼re not like anyone IÊ¼ve ever known 
the wait, it pulls me under, crushing everything our time is relative

Grey was the day I saw the truth
games I have played embracing you

The others count the numbers of days left
erasing what is left of you and me 
the others canÊ¼t remember wasting
everything I wait now everyday

Forgive me, I canÊ¼t help you sometimes, I donÊ¼t get it 
I need you. Not just your words

Some say our days are numbered, IÊ¼m waiting 
it now feels like my lungs are closing in 
this hate it makes me sober, pushing everything IÊ¼m wasting everything
