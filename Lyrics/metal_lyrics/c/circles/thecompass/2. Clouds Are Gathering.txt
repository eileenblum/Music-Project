SheÊ¼s got money and she pays 
SheÊ¼s not willing to get in the way

Business is business and I do not really mind
ItÊ¼s a thrill to kill them with a smile

Mercy is a compromise 
and I wonÊ¼t go back on a deal ...this time

YouÊ¼re walking blind not knowing me your enemy 
One step behind
You canÊ¼t escape your last mistake

HeÊ¼s got, nothing left to say 
heÊ¼s not, going to come back someday

Business is business and I do not really mind
People disappear all the time

ThereÊ¼s no need to sympathise 
I donÊ¼t have a single regret ...this time

Contract for crime forgotten profession. 
ItÊ¼s natural. 

I demonstrate a practical human trait. 
Walking blind.
