Wherever is the time
whenever the spaces are faint
whatever takes a mind 
light and fade 
body and the mind 
archons lie in wait

Following 
follow you 
please can I show you the way home?

IÊ¼ve been waiting here, so long 
this time the pieces fall where they belong

Whatever excuse you find
dignify your name 
a fantasy entwined 
the ways of faith unmade

Borrowing 
hollow truth 
please can I show you the way home?

IÊ¼ve been told 
shouldÊ¼ve known 
I could be someone 
standing tall 
time to grow 
and thereÊ¼s never time to stop 
We are 
a call to end the Imperium.

Handed over to faith 
Hand it over in due faith 
Hand it over to your faith 
Hand it over to your faith
Hand it over...

Handed over to faith
Handed over to your faith
Hand it over to your faith
Hand it over to faith
