Tonight 
IÊ¼m bleeding one last time 
when will we bring the sun light down?

The thought of persistence
keep running through my mind
just say that youÊ¼re sorry
scream it in my ear 
today is not your day

Confined 
wait for the moment
believed in your lies
I close my eyes

Wake up 
youÊ¼re wasting the night away 
when will we bring the sunlight down? I sift through sands 
I look for signs to make it clearer

Untied 
IÊ¼m lost in the moment
IÊ¼m free from your lies
I close my eyes
