Today you closed your eyes,
And I saw the angels fly.
Raised and stun
It's falling down forever
Now you dream the eternal dream
And I know what's sadness means.

I raised my hands of the high and watched the sky.
I see phoenix raising higher above
Touching the sun, the shimmering lights,
The sky explodes,
And when my blinded eyes begin to see.
My world has changed, it's dying now with me.

Wooohoo no no.

With you this world is dying
You stopped the father's steps,
No one can feel the boy, who's leaving.

Your journey starting something
We're on the start when you rest
This for well, the final rest forever

Today you closed your eyes
And I saw the angels fly
The sky covered entirely in darkness
Why have the star fading away?
Modesty and found the key
The world has turn from colony to grave

This world has lost its wonderful shine
This world has lost his glorious time
This world has found his fate
Yeah, this is fate
This world has reached the tempt forever more
This dying world is doomed to occur.

With you this world is dying
You stopped the father's steps,
No one can feel the boy, who's leaving.

Your journey has found its ending
We're on the stars who rest
This for well, the final rest forever

With you....
With you this world is dying
We reached the father's step
No one can feel the boy you're leaving

Your journey has found its ending
We're on the stars who rest
This for well, the final rest forever

Forever....
