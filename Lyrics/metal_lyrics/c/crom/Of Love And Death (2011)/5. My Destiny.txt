Be my star, light the way
For we are oh so far apart
But I'm sure we'll meet one day

The wind calls our names
I never will forget
The day I've found my destiny
The day that we have met!!

The path of destiny
Path of eternal lies?
I entered times before my love had killed my pride

The word called destiny
Is it, or is it not?
The answer you gave to me
Broken is my restless heart

Now I will find my way to die
My eyes will close no more return

The unique moments we shared
Forever lost in time
But the memory will remain
You always will be mine

The truth I cannot see
Sorrow fills my eyes
I realize my thoughts were false
Destiny nought but lies

Now I will find my way to die
My eyes will close no more return

I know - that destiny is hard to see
I know - I'll die
I know - my dreams are full of emptiness
Oh God let me fly
