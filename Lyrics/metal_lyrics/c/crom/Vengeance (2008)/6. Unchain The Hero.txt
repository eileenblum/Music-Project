I don't want to fight again
I want to live in peace
But I must accept this challenge
And one more time I'll feel
The never-ending hunger of my enemy
And inside of me I pray to you for this to be.

The end of my journey
For this is what I'm yearning for!
Yes tonight I want to die and to heaven I shall fly
Let the hero go!

Unchain the hero from his oath
Let him die!
And end a life of questing, of war and misery
Unchain the hero from his oath
Let the story end
And let his name live through all eternity

For so many years I fought to be free
But I never thought that this way of life would mean I was
A slave to the hunger for blood and flesh
And every night I smell the stench of decay and death
The oath to be the victor crushes me every night,
And inside of me I pray to you for this to be..

My final battle
For this is what I'm yearning for!
Yes tonight I want to die and to heaven I shall ascend
Let the hero go!!

Unchain the hero...
