[In memory of Gerhard Steininger]

A star in the darkness shining bride
Tells the story of a tired man
A man who always was in care for his friends
And if he was your friend you never had to be alone

And though he was a well-liked man
Inward he was a lonely guy
Who never got along with his life

It is sad but true
That death always takes our best ones too early
Now to your tribute
I inflame a never-ending...

Fire that burns so high
Fire that touches the sky,
Fire that will remain
Your memory.
I still feel pain.

[Guitar solo]

Looking back at this time,
You never had a chance,
I realised it much too late,

I never will forget
Last words you spoke to me.
Today I understand them,
And fear fills my heart.

The day that you die,
Your day of destiny,
I hope we'll meet one day.

Fire that burns so high.
Fire that touches the sky.
Fire that will remain
Your memory.
I still feel pain.

It is sad but true
That death always takes our best ones too early
Now to your tribute
I inflame a never-ending...

Fire,
Fire,
Fire,
Fire.

[Spoken:]
Now you are in a better place.
And you smile.
Your faith is back.
I hope you've found your freedom.
He stays, I'm ... before its ...
