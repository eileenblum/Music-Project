I was searching for the hammer of the gods
the mightiest symbol of strength wisdom and glory
For thousand years the biggest secret -
Never found and never solved
Many lives have perished but I had to try...

"My time of search will end with pride
Just one more night and I'll hold it high
Then I'll return back to my home
And forgotten is my painfull roam"

I have solved the mystic riddle
And my search has found it's end
But now I'm old and so many years have passed
And I have learned that life is more than to get fame and to own wealth
Cause I've lost my family and my youth
The best time of my life!
