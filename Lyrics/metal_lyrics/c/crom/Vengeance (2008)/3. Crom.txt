The stars above
So near to Crom
The oceans wide
That touch the sky

Let me fly
To heavens pride
Let me dream
Of the Halls of Glory

And when the night closes in
My soul will fly away
And I will sit with my ancestors
Who have waited for eternity
Please free my soul from earthly bonds
And end my time of Vengeance

But the power of Crom
Won't take me away
My time has not yet come
And I still wait to reach

The stars above
So near to Crom
Wide oceans
That touch the sky
