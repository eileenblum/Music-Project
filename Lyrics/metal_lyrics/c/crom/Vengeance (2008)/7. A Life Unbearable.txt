I've never had to walk the path of life - alone
But I must learn now since you're far away

I never had to feel what life really is
But I have to feel it since you're far away

Why did you leave?
You're the one that made my life bearable
Without my star my life is dark and I don't know how to survive

I've never had to feel what fear really is
But I must feel it since you're far away

I never had to feel deep sorrow in my heart
But I must feel it since you're far away

Why did you leave?
You're the one that made my life bearable
Without my star my life is dark and I don't know how to survive
I'll end my life!!!
