You thought I was dead!
But my time of vengeance is not over yet
And now it's time for me to face all liars!
Your blood will freeze
I will bring you terror and wasting disease
Fear the return and kneel before your master

Deep from the ground
I'll hear them as they scream and shout out my name and they'll watch me soar

On wings of fire I'll soar
On wings of fire!
Like a phoenix from the ashes I will rise
On wings of fire

It's just begun!
And mighty wings swallow the sun
Now they'll know how it feels to be
Chained to a life of slavery
But now they will pay
I have lived all my life just for this day
I'll lay waste to your earth and take pleasure in your screams!
