To the north, ride, ride son of wrath to the north
proudly bear your father's sword, proudly bear your crest
proudly hold your head up high and stand up to the test
of skill at arms and courage against despair
of noble spirits bound to rise against the force of tyranny

"For my father, for my grandfather, for all the noble ones you've slain
I swear this oath of vengeance, and vengeance be my name
For all the weak enslaved and shackeld by your cruel reign
I swear this oath of vengeance and vengeance be my name.."

Ride forth with hate in your heart
Ride to tear his kingdom apart
Not for glory and not out of pride
But for your father who so bravely died

And so he rode clad in furs with sword in hand
to the north, into the darkest land
where evil reigned to make his stand
his honour to defend

To the north, ride, ride son of wrath to the north
proudly bear your father's sword, proudly bear your crest
proudly hold your head up high and stand up to the test
of skill at arms and courage against despair
of noble spirits bound to rise against the force of tyranny

"For my father, for my grandfather, for all the noble ones you've slain
I swear this oath of vengeance, and vengeance be my name
For all the weak enslaved and shackeld by your cruel reign
I swear this oath of vengeance and vengeance be my name.."
