Time stands still and the past fades away before my eyes
I see her standing before me, a glossy shine in my dark life
Her tender hand reaching out for me - I can't achieve no more
But now the presence meets me again and so I bury her on a hill
- a hill so high like the stars on the sky -

I inflame the everending fire
a tear breaks the light in my eyes
and I run..

But I can't run forever
time will always meet me again
again and again..

I remember her dying, dying in my arms
but I know I had no chance to prevent
My shout breaks the night and the stars seem no more to shine,
shine like the fire in her eyes.
Her long, black hair blowing in the wind - I never will forget
and her beautyfull eyes - shining like diamonds -
I will dream of eternaly.
I'll never be the same as I did and the rose will fade again..

I inflame the everending fire
a tear breaks the light of my eyes
and I run..

But I can't run forever
time will always meet me again
again and again..
