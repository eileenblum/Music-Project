[Deicide cover]
[Lyrics by Glen Benton]

Join us

Evil night of an evil death
Epitome of illusion
Sacrifice of the unborn child
Enter the kingdom of darkness
Sodomized for the ritual
For there is nowhere to run
Open the gates to the manifestation
And grant me the powers of darkness

[Chorus]
Infernal majesty, take this dead offering
Feeding the demon seed, evil bestowed on me

Exorice the power of dead
Invert my cross of time
The retaim of Satan anarchy
Inside my scared sign

Lucifer bring me the legions of deaths
Abbadon kill until nothing is left
Oblivious to evil

Death of defiled the rituals
Of dreams and disillusion
Unlock the box and gimp in pain
Summon the demons of darkness
Evil Gods that fast with flesh
Prepare me for the dead
Release me from the angels so righteous
For your God is dead

[Chorus]
