[Lyrics &amp; Music - Andrea Cipolla]

Splatter Deluxe
See what you want inside the cylinder
Splatter Deluxe
It's only the name of that show 

If it looks to you like a cake
Certainly it is
If it looks to you like a chair
Certainly it is If it seems you it is 

Splatter Deluxe
Pick what you find
Splatter Deluxe
There's no question
There's no answer 

If it looks to you like an illusion
Certainly it is
