[Lyrics &amp; Music - Andrea Cipolla]

Rabbits are raining in by backyard
but I have a femur collection indoors.
Finding femurs ain't easy 
'cause rabbits rarely rain.

Rabbits and femurs get together
but don't ask me why.
There are no dead bodies here
or shitpiles
or even coagulated blood. 
The demented teaches nothing,
I'll give you no answers,
just femurs and rabbits.
The demented teaches nothing,
I'll give you no answers.
