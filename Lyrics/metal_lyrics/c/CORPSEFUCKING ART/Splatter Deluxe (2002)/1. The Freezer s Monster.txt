[Lyrics &amp; Music - Andrea Cipolla]

The freezer's monster defiles your human fleshes.
They're ready to be kept
in my butchery's freezer. 

I mostly collect decaying heads,
expression of terror in their last look.
No reason for penalty,
you'll be mutilated and you'll be crying.
Torsos melting in your everyday meal,
in my butchery's freezer! 

Don't wonder what you're eating,
soon you'll be part of my collection.
Eat and get weight,
I'm gonna sell you as precious food.
Come in the freezer' monster's butchery!!!!
