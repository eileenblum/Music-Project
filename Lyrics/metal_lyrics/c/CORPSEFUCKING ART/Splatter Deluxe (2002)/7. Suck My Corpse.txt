[Lyrics &amp; Music - Andrea Cipolla]

In the refrigerator number 29
the body's not dead yet.
No identity established
for a body to be butchered.
The coroner will slice anyway
the healthy body won't wake up. 

Trading pieces
among internal doctors.
Dr. Cockrot
shall suck body parts again. 

Suck my corpse
the morgue at next door.
