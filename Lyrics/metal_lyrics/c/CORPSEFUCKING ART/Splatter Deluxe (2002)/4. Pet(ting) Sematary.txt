[Lyrics &amp; Music - Andrea Cipolla]

Human bodies disrupted by undeath,
a purification-gurgling sematary. 

Pet(ting) Sematary
plasma orgies.
Pet(ting) Sematary
rectal enjoyment. 

Rancid love
among pieces of purulent flesh
barf haemorrhage forever. 

Pet(ting) Sematary
a pile of indigestible meat
Pet(ting) Sematary
No more room for your purulent smell.
