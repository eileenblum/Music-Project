[Lyrics &amp; Music - Andrea Cipolla]

Metal alloys and flesh in only one body
forged to bring famine and plague.
Robocorpse,
you're human misery's mistake,
the executioner of a devolved world!
Cannibal technology
fed on the past's infected viscera,
you will take us to your dark psychopathic realm! 

Robocorpse,
you will maim our minds
with images of death.
Apocalypse and dread for yet rotted flesh!
