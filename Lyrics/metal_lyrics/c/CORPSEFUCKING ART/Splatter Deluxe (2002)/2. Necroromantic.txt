[Lyrics &amp; Music - Andrea Cipolla]

In the Necroromantic's dungeon
there's his display of flesh piles,
experimental compositions of body pieces.
There are strong meathooks for his visionary works,
a gallery of insane genetic crossbreeding,
a gallery underestimated by the great art critics. 

Finding corpses is very easy,
when you work in the morgue you always get fresh meat.
Mutilation and defilement of cold stiffs,
A perfect job for the Necroromantic!
