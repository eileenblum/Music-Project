[Lyrics &amp; Music - Andrea Cipolla]

Chainsaw is on the sofa
Beside the right feet box
I have to remove the shreds of skin

Leatherface would have done it better
But Texas is far

Now I am drinking my coffee on the sofa
but my right foot?
I hacked it by mistake!

Leatherface would have done it better
But Texas is far

Come with me
Now I can't hack feet any more
Let's go to Texas to sell them
Tobe Hooper wants some right feet
