Alright, we can deal with some gore now
Somebody might want to hear
a few more gruesome tales.

Keep in mind that Mr. Daisy
stocks up from refrigerator number 29.
Dr. Cockrot always has fresh meat there.

Look at those fingers
They could do for fiches
For a backgammon game

Guts spread all over CD booklets
pictures of dead guys and mean titles
Why not a nice field of flowers for an artwork instead?
or a lady eating cookies?
There would be some content at least.
