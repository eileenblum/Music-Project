That shower is broken down all the time.
Water is running down the drain.
When is that plumber coming?

I can hear my neighbour Homer
He's having his shower right now
just hear him singing loud!

His pipes are filled with fish
So he can have some nachos
under the shower.

We're getting flooded here instead.
I'm gonna wait a bit longer
then I'll go get some nachos too.
