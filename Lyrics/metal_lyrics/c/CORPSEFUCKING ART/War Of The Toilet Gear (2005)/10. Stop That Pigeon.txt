Pigeons are useful for spicing your balcony,
and making nice brown drawings,
and playing the background for an orchestra.

They can spin around,
they can turn their heads,
and wake us up in the morning with that sweet sound.

Our friend uses them as plungers,
and brushes for his paintings,
so he can distract the soap bar.
He supports the toothbrush.

The pigeon theatre is in town,
what a nice sight,
but all must stop now:
The soap bar has been hit!
The pigeon is fleeing.
Stop that pigeon!
How will this war end?
