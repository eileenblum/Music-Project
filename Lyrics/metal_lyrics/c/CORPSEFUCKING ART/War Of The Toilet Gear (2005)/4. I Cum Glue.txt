I cum glue
A collage of papier-machine
I cum glue
to stick colored cardboard sheets together.

Children can play with vowels
Teachers with consonants
Mommy with the apostrophe.

I cum glue
An excuse to misspell a song title
I cum glue
Cannibal Corpse will have fun.

The colored sheets are joined in various shapes.
Fantasy makes glue drip out of the nose.

Pick the letters
and put them together
Endless amusement
colored cardboard sheets.
