Just remove the h
and you get the smelliest teddy-bear
that children ever had.
Your kid's cot will no longer be the same.
How many mums will strive
to have that h back to its place?

The CD is almost over,
and as you saw on the black cover
the toothbrush beats the soap.
But don't be afraid.
Mr. Daisy will be back with more stories to tell.
Promise there will be more corpses next time,
and Winnie the Poo will get its h back.

If you can't speak Italian you won't get a world if the last song.
So go back to the lyrics for song 8 and read the last two lines again.
You can do that fir the it her lyrics as well.
