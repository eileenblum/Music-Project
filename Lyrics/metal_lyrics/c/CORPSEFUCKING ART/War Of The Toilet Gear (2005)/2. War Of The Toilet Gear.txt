The toothbrush aims at controlling the sink.
The soap is on the other side
but it will soon wear out.

A war of fantasy
that makes no casualties when the song is over,
we won't miss our target.

Mr. Daisy is monitoring the battlefield
but he's on the toilet bowl right now.
The newspaper he's reading bets on the one who has already won
Proclamation of supremacy.

There never were any weapons of mass destruction.

I was forgetting some gore
Broken baby arms
Charred corpses
Cheap bowel sale
No more imagination there.

Guess what this one is about!
