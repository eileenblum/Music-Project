his album will tell us more about our hero.
This one is about Scooby Doom
that's not the famous dog,
it's Mr. Daisy's pet.

It's a dachshund that sleeps all the time waiting for grandma
to leave some cake unattended.

Scooby Dooby Doom
That's the chorus
Sing along with us.

It's a good friend to take a walk with,
and a good sleuth-houd for rabbits and femurs.
The collection is almost done.

Scooby Dooby Doom
Never feel blue.
