the tooth brush thinks it has killed the soap bar
but it has too many bristles over it's head
and forgot that one can slip on soap

suddenly many soap bubbles come out of the sink
that wasn't the end of the soap bar

the battle went on for a few more minutes
then they realized that fighting wasn't so important
and each one went back to Finnish their own tasks

the tooth brush went back to brushing teeth
the soap bar continued to get used
and the world keep going as usual
