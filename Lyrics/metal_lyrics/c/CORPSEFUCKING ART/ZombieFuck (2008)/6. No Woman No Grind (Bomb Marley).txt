no woman no grind
i remember when we listened to Carcass
looking at mutilated corpses in the pathologist's room

we still have good hearing
and we can't forget
how beautiful it was 
to paint with that models' blood

sew up the wounds
and don't spill all this blood
otherwise you'll get my carpet dirty 
and it won't be a good thing for you

my feet are the only means to play the drum kick
therefor i have to play grind
hoping that my carpet will stay clean
