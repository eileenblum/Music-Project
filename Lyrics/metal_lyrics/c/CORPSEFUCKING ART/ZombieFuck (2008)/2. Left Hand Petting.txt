in front of the TV
i,m looking for my favorite show
left hand petting 
i never miss an episode

my dog is on the couch with me and chews my neighbor
i can't hear the TV well

there's the show
it always starts at this time
a fixed appointment for a family evening

as you see this album talks about family
about the true values of life :  cannibalism

left hand petting
a show that never existed
a title of this album
