load the spoons and shot when i say so
the powerful sound of the cafeteria's bell is ringing

the kitchen full of a million potatoes
all to be peeled and cooked
with knifes and black pots

the holocaust has just begun
and the march of fat cooks
sweating seven shirts
want to deprive us of our puree

we'll all eat well when the next bell tolls for lunch
forks will be in a cloud of steam with such a huge wooden spoon
