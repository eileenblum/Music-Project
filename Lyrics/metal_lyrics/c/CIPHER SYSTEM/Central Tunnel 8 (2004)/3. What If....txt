What if we wouldn't do those primary choices?
What if we wouldn't do those things we do right now?
Life can take a different way so easily
Every choice we make
Every step we take

A constant fear of doing wrong
But I know two mistakes doesn't make it right
I wanna lay myself down and close my eyes
But I can't escape from what the future holds

What if the scientist doesn't know what his work of art will be used for
What he made was harmless
But used in the name of terror
So many broken promises
So many lives at stake

You could always wonder "what if...?" but there's nothing you can do
So sit down and enjoy there's nothing you can do

A constant fear of doing wrong
But I know two mistakes doesn't make it right
I wanna lay myself down and close my eyes
But I can't escape from what the future holds
