In my dreams I've seen brutal scenes of war
Acts of sickness and plague spreading around
I glorify the ground as I wander
The aura of life surrounds me as the day turns to night
My life will never be the same again

Emotions control my every thought
Emotions make my body change
They talk to me from inside
The talk and I combine
As life surrounds

Strength, don't turn your face from me now
Can't you see how weak I am without you
Walk with me, walk my path, enjoy the ride
As everything goes by I lay my thoughts on you

Like a ticking time machine I'm set to go off
Be my enemy, be my friend, by my side until the end

Emotions control my every thought
Emotions make my body change
They talk to me from inside
The talk and I combine
As life surrounds
