I purify, I cleanse myself through chaos and my soul runs cold
I purify, I cleanse myself through chaos and my body breaks down
I sustain, I cleanse myself and I remain but not the same
Even stronger that it once appeared
Also weaker I realize

Electric meanings screamed, all at once, all at me nourishing on my reactions
Mechanical lies spoken, great great lies told to us, powerless without our trust

Am I sacred, am I holy, the face I fear is my own
The doctors words: state unknown

Incorrect growing, actual birth, speeding up

Me, myself, my framework collapsed inside
Under the withering surface there's nothing left to see
Nothing left to seek, nothing left at all
So you leave me alone

Electric meanings screamed, all at once, all at me nourishing on my reactions
Mechanical lies spoken, great great lies told to us, powerless without our trust

Am I sacred, am I holy, the face I fear is my own
The doctors words: state unknown
