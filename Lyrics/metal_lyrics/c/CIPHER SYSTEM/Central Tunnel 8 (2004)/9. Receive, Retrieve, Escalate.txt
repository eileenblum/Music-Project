My thoughts flow out inhaled by others
As old disappears new arises
You could have a hard time adjusting to it so just
Receive, retrieve, and escalate

They feel themselves being released
Still there is something holding them back
Want to do so much more
I need to breakout from silence

Their acts flow out suffered by others
As old forgets new arises
You could have a hard time adjusting to it so just
Receive, retrieve, and escalate

They feel themselves being released
Still there is something holding them back
Want to do so much more
I need to breakout from silence
