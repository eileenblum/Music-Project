Spirit let this be it I have had enough
You the mother of fear lend me my courage
And let it guide me through the fear of life
I'm begging, I'm pleasing you to complete me
Please complete me

Can you save me from myself?
I'm begging, I'm pleasing, I'm carving myself within

You and I together forever
Complete me

You fill my veins with your energy
I want my life back cause I like being perfect
Let me control you once more
Without me you're nothing so why can't I get rid of you
You're a self-proclaimed king
So what makes you wanna harm so bad

Can you save me from myself?
I'm begging, I'm pleasing, I'm carving myself within

You and I together forever
Complete me
By united efforts we shall overcome
Complete me
