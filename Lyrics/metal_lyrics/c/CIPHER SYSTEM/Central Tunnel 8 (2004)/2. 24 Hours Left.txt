Come on, let's play a little game shall we
Of course you want,
You have no choice
I play death and you can play alive
I make your sins I think your thoughts,
Too bad for you that we from now on play by my rules
Pray to your spirit that the next game won't be with me

So when you're heading out to explore
Don't forget who to adore

24 hours left
Expect an eye for an eye
Retaliation rhyme rebounds

Take your time to prepare

Now when the game has started
And you know what rules we're playing with
Start running
Genesis make it disappear make it fade away
I'm a seeker so make my presence have a purpose
My time is running out

Take your time to prepare

So when you're heading out to explore
Don't forget who to adore

24 hours left
Expect an eye for an eye
Retaliation rhyme rebounds
