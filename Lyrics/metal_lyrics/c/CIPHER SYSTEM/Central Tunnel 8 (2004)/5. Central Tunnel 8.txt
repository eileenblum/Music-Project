Whatever made him do what he did?
Wanted it through oh so bad
Conscious disconnected
The thin line between right and wrong is cracked
Explained by his grim confessions
It aches in me to hear his words

Five became four
Ten became nine
My misery loves company
Two became one
A hand full of nothing
All lost misplaced
Central Tunnel Eight

Strip the pitiful
Embraced the thorns whom take from his flesh
Break them released
Entangled in the torture network of his
The passage is closing in
Detaining my focus

Five became four
Ten became nine
My misery loves company
Two became one
A hand full of nothing
All lost misplaced
Central Tunnel Eight
