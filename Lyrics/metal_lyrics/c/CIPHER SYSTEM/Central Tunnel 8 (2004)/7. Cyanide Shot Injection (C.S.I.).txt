We have done it too many times
You have seen us fall, seen us crawl
Seen us fighting back again and again
But as so many times before been broken down again
Stolen life

Get yourself a gun, do the world that favor.
Just pull the trigger, come back and you are healed.
Move ahead, take the step, taste the guilt.
You deserve it so swallow.

Cyanide shot injection
The crystal clear purl so sweet
Angel voices caress me into sleep

Courage makes me see
Fear questions my courage
Lies make you doubt
I confront the fact face to face

Without any answers to display my cargo is the end of it all
To take a chance isn't always right
Still it isn't totally wrong
Now I'm cloned, a new person now remade
Done from the ground
Still I scream for breakout

Cyanide shot injection
The crystal clear purl so sweet
Angel voices caress me into sleep
