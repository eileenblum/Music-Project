This is the beginning of the end
From this point on and on
Nothing will ever be the same again
My life is going its own way, running its own race

I need structure, I need belief

Now I can't find a single word... speechless
Now I can't find a single emotion... numb
How can I get my life back...dead?

Stranded I am
Trapped I feel
Defeated by time

My mind still stands here
Twisting, turning and changing it all
Reforming me into something I don't recall
I wanna set things straight
I wanna make things clear

This is who I am
This is what I feel
This is how I die

Now I can't find a single word... speechless
Now I can't find a single emotion... numb
How can I get my life back...dead?
