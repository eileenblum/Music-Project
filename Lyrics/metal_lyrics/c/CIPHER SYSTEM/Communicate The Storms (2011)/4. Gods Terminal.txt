This is the closing line for you my friend
Day after day degenerated by the will of my hand
Havoc surrounds my path
It forms the shape for you to follow

Now what's left in you is fear
Feel the slow collapse breaking out inside
The cold comes creeping upon you my dear
I make you obsolete, soon gone, there is no turning back

I'm possessed by the search, in purity I will wander
Driven by the urge, leave my head let me reap once more again

Oh, number forty seven
There is no heaven, but I bring you serenity
Now, countless days you've tried
There is no meaning, I bring you home to the god's Terminal

I'm not alone, I'm not my self
I feel the dark reign, I see the lights go out
I'm not alone, I'm not my self
I don't need to know why, I just need it, to stop

I'm possessed by the search, in purity I will wander
Driven by the urge, leave my head let me reap once more again

Oh, number forty seven
There is no heaven, but I bring you serenity
Now, countless days you've tried
There is no meaning, so don't breath, I bring you peace, I bring you home to the god's Terminal
