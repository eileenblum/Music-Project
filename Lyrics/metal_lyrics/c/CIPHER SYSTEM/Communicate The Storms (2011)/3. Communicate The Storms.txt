Evolution of weakness, an elegy for leaders
A mournful tone colours you, the shade of grey defines you
As a gentle caress I unfold the words of righteousness
Untruths incarnated, you're choking, asphyxiated

Lies, let it guide you
Filth, I will show you the way
Leading, leading and forcing you

Every day, goes by, day after day, same as yesterday
Every night, the same, feeling rises up

Broken, beaten
The truth was supposed to set you free
Reverse or forward, the truth was supposed to set you free

It takes forever to communicate the storms
You fight back not to unleash the hordes
A broken promise, a meaning with no substance
Oh how you regret the trust, regret

Lies, Let it guide you
Filth, I will show you the way
Leading, leading and forcing you

Every day, goes by, day after day, same as yesterday
Every night, the same, feeling rises up
