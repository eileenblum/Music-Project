Breaching the surface so gentle, taking every measure I can
Holding back, taking in, striving against, bringing forth
Now, so many questions unanswered, it is too late once again
I will redeem my self, and so should you
Standing on the edge, letting it go
Turning around, hitting the ground, pushing it in, I leave in sin

Oh how I try to fit in, yet your world, so distant to me
Bring me close, take me in, end my path of uncertainty

Writing down my words of wisdom, I'm carving out my own path
Telling the story I want people to know
Withholding the details let them create the dream lands in their head
I am the truth, I am the ruler, I own, you

More and more, the numbers are hard to calculate
No jury or trial, I am the judge
More and more, I can't, I can't get enough

Oh how I try to fit in, yet your world, so distant to me
Bring me close, take me in, end my path of uncertainty
