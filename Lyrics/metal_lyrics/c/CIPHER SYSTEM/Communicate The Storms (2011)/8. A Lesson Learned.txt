As I proclaim life, everything I for breaks
My inside flooding, it detonates
Me and my frustration, we know each other too well
A solid core creating this bleeding, suffering leads me, now

Faster, harder, I play my suicide serenade
I seal my fate in grief and the dream starts

Here I stand, I will make this work, breaking every barricade
Never again will I let it go, a lesson learned, a progress made

Killing me, that's all it wants to do
Killing you, hear my words, they are meant for you

I resent life, as I was given it
You can't heal something that's meant to be broken
The harder you try, the harder it gets
Clearing the road, walking a stray path alone
Walking a stray path alone

Here I stand, I will make this work, breaking every barricade
Never again will I let it go, a lesson learned, a progress made
