As the life goes on as usual, a three feet wall restrains
7 inches cut, not the first and certainly not the last
A killer full of adrenaline
Tormenting its victim for hours till it has drawn its last breath
For a reason long forgotten

Screaming for an answer, nothing is real I am lost in this world
Searching for truth, screaming but no one will hear my silent scream

I found my self again, after all these years
I go from clarity, clarity
In my sleep I grow, I am finally touching the ground
Found the missing part that makes a man whole

My pain is vital for our survival

The pain from the piercing of skin, makes me much stronger and stronger
Sweet pain, sweet artifacts (sweet artifacts), and as the skin breaks

A death mask, taking shape, small mistakes makes him more visible
A death mask, taking shape, small mistakes makes him more visible

Searching for the answer, but still I'm searching for the truth
My pain is vital for our survival
My pain is vital for our survival

I found my self again, after all these years
I go from clarity, clarity

In my sleep I grow, I am finally touching the ground
Found the missing part that makes a man whole
