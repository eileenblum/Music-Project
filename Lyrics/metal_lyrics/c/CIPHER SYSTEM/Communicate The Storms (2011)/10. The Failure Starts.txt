Imagining how it would be, taking every wish one step further
My mind plays games with me
I see it so clear, how can't you see it

My visions are more visible, for every time I close my eyes

When the clouds of dust disappear, the failure unveils no more
Can I see what the future have for me

Imagining how it would be, taking every with one step further
My mind play games with me
I see it so clear, why can't you see it
My visions are more visible, for every time I close my eyes
When the clouds of dust disappear, the failure starts

The reason, the guilt, the failure, the frustration
I know them all too well
When they come closer to us, I see it, I will be, here to protect

My visions are more visible, for every time I close my eyes

Like a slave, you lay beneath
There is nothing you can do to stop the destruction

When the clouds of dust disappear, the failure unveils
No more can I see what the future have for me
