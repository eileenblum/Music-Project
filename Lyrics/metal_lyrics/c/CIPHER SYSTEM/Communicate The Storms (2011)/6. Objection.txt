Preaching to the masses as a leader of rats
Leading the undefeated to circle the ground
March of the irrelevant, concatenated
Bringing the mass psychosis in production

Meet thy maker through clearance of lies
The bloodstream screams, cut me open
Meet thy maker through clearance of lies
In silence I scream

As hope leaves my body, I lay there shaking
To maintain this way is not an option I have
This conflict I have been fighting
Earth and bone will once again, once again reunite

A worldwide craving, that needs to be stilled
With a mouth of filth, I see how it turns around
Blindness feeds the ever growing void
We take the last breath of freedom
Salvation
Don't let it happen
Objection
This is not what we searched for

Meet thy maker through clearance of lies
The bloodstream screams, cut me open
Meet thy maker through clearance of lies
In silence I scream

As hope leaves my body, I lay there shaking
To maintain this way is not an option I have
This conflict I have been fighting
Earth and bone will once again, once again reunite
