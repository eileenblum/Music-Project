Where ever I go, chaos surrounds me
Idolizing the perpetual bliss
I'm creating my existence as I see it normal
Imagination or reality? This is my way

Am I dreaming, are these voices not my own
Talk to me, lead me
Dreaming or not, guidance is what I seek
Lead me to righteousness

In life I fail, chaos feeds me
Turning the hourglass, increasing my corruption
Everything stops, a divine craft, caresses me
Project life collapse

Operation breakdown has started
Stranded in a no man's land, trying to escape
Believer, when I say I have tried, you shall trust
Start to worship the ground I walk, chaos surrounds me

Am I dreaming, are these voices not my own
Talk to me, lead me
Dreaming or not, guidance is what I seek
Lead me to righteousness

In life I fail, chaos feeds me
Turning the hourglass, increasing my corruption
Everything stops, a divine craft, caresses me
Project life collapse
