I am here trying to make my mark on this world (of purity)
Still I'm longing for a way to see what's obvious (for others)
One step forth, three steps back The anger rises, here comes the attack

Mechanical acts cleansing the life you know and lived until now
A declaration of independence, now leave, now rise no more

Now rise no more
One step forth, three steps back The anger rises, here comes the attack
Fear me, fear me, fear me coming
Hear me, hear me, hear me father

Without a doubt, your hear, you see, you fear me coming you fear me coming
Without a thought, without a trace, I'm bringing you a relentless race

I, I can see, I can feel, I can feel the difference
I , I need to breathe, I need to feed, I need to feed this progress

My steps echoes in the stairway of failure
I start to shovel and the plastic (slowly) disappear

One step forth, three steps back the anger rises, here comes the attack

Fear me, fear me, fear me coming
Hear me, hear me, hear me father

Without a doubt, you hear, you see, you fear me coming you fear me coming
Without a thought, without a trace, I'm bringing you a relentless race
