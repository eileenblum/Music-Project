Lie upon the lie.
Lie upon the lie.
Lie upon the lie.
Lie upon the lie.
Lie upon the lie.
And it all comes down to this
That a pig is a pig is a pig is a pig.
And they want to rule the world, but they can't have me.
Cuz I don't need this body.
I see the line traced back to my ancestors
And I hold on tight to that line
Which is before the fear induced religions that separated the world
And the one world government and the one world banking system
Through the world bank that issued the monetary illusion of ownership
And dealt it to the masses which caused a separation from that knowledge
That knowledge and that connection to each other and to the earth
