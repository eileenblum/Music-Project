Every moment
every moment, is a gift
in this world, ever changing,
breathe it in
Consequence,
something's gotta give here,
something's gotta give
Breathe it in,
consequence,
Every moment,
every moment, is a gift,
Breathe it in,
Words we've said
That left our souls in danger
Lead not our hearts to anger
Oh, but every moment brings
Complicated simple things,
I just want to find, inside of you...
I just want to lie inside of you...
I just want to hide...
Lives we've lived
They left our souls in danger
They led our hearts to anger
Oh, but every moment brings
complicated simple things...
I just want to find, inside of you...
I just want to lie inside of you...
I just want to hide inside of you...
Every moment, every moment, is a gift
In this world, ever changing, breathe it in
Consequence, something's gotta give here,
something's gotta give
Breathe it in, consequence,
Every moment, every moment, is a gift,
Breathe it in...
