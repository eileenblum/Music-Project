At times our ideas of God have served us well.
They have been quoted as the inspiration for acts of incredible benevolence.
Conversely, they have been used as the inspiration for acts of horrible cruelty and terrible violence as man has contemplated his place in the universe.

Holy wars, crusades, jihads, these are some of the darkest, most violent acts of aggression mankind has committed unto himself, and they were all done in the name of his religions.

These are the choices for behaviors, individuals have made.

These are the acts of violence we reject, yesterday, today, and forever.

Where have our concepts of God failed us, it is at the point which one creation is asked to harm another, it is at the time when one concept of God is held above another.
It is at the time when our weakness as mortal beings with a finite view of forever cannot conceive of unending, pure, infinite, unconditional love.

Now is the time to move forward in a positive and peaceful manner, as we embrace the merging of intelligence and spirituality and move together into a space of higher consciousness and a future of seemingly unimaginable possibilities, and abandon our tiny concepts of God before we destroy one another forever...
