Some promise heaven to you
Give you something you can die for
Trust in God and he'll be true
Seems he needs you for his war

There's no virgins in the palace of the Lord,
a child-killing God would not deserve to fuck a whore
They say their jihad is holy
but it makes sense to them only
So we pay for their faith everyday with our lives.

Gay Muslims for Christ,
it's that absurd to me,
it's like a twisted kind of christinsanianity
they kill for Allah, live to die by the sword?
What a fucked up way to praise your Goddamned Lord.

I could move the earth for you
Give you something you can die for
trust Allah and he'll be true
Seems he needs to for his war

There's no virgins in the palace of the Lord,
a child-killing God would not deserve to fuck a whore
They say their jihad is holy
but it makes sense to them only

It's all what you weave, when you achieve your blanket of life.
And it's all what you retrieve with your completeness and your light.
Now it's the same old story,
different glory,
kingdoms come and go you know.
Time for absolution,
old solution,
here's the power watch it grow and grow and grow...

Gay Muslims for Christ,
it's that absurd to me,
it's like a twisted kind of christinsanianity
they kill for Allah, live to die by the sword?
What a fucked up way to praise your Goddamned Lord.
