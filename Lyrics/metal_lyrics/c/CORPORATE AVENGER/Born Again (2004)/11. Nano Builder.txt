Mediocracy,
our hypocrisy,
we won't survive our technology
Our duality,
the balance beam,
is teetering toward our extinction.

Man as animal
earth ritual
A rhythm to our lives
From the morning sun
till the night would come
time was on our side
We got smarter and smarter and larger
and we lost our spiritual side
We learned to kill so good
it's a wonder we've survived our own design.

Mediocracy,
our hypocrisy,
we won't survive our technology
Our duality,
the balance beam,
is teetering toward our extinction.
The meglomanity,
of our humanity
it left an opening with no connection
So we were compromised,
it lead to our demise,
now our inventions sing of our extinction.

Here we are today about to celebrate
our greatest achievements
The grandness of our size it's right before our eyes
now they know they're alive.
They get smaller and smaller and smarter and smarter,
man if they get a plan,
there'll be no one left
to tell the story of how they got rid of man.
Mediocracy,
our hypocrisy,
we won't survive our technology
Our duality,
the balance beam,
is teetering toward our extinction.
Egomaniacs
sailed into the black,
the silver cord was broke we'll never make it back,
by our own device we were compromised,
now we're teetering on our extinction.
Mediocracy,
our hypocrisy,
we won't survive our technology
Our duality,
the balance beam,
is teetering toward our extinction.
The meglomanity,
of our humanity
it left an opening with no connection
So we were compromised,
it lead to our demise,
now our inventions sing of our extinction.
