Blessed are the peacemakers,
for they shall inherit the label of non-patriot,
and be condemned by the profiteers of war...
No, no, no delight,
in seeing fading light
inside the thinking minds
for fear of condemnation
Know what it means to be right
and say all the things you believe in
Know, that the truth that you see
when you speak can be the end of you.
No, no paradise
for those who sacrifice
for a God who's made of lies
and murders non-believers.
Know what it means to be right
and say all the things you believe in
Know, that the truth that you see
when you speak can be the end of you.
The idea that an omnipresent creator
would ordain free will on the created,
sending them into darkness
then reveal the truth about his nature
to a select few supposedly ordained
to distribute throughout the world
an unveiling of the nature
of an insecure, violent, sometimes kind, child killing God,
sounds more like the musings of some kind of heavenly crack addict
than anything we should worship or model ourselves after...
No, no guiding light
for those who kill for Christ
a worthless sacrifice for feeble minds of hatred.
Know what it means to be right
and say all the things you believe in
Know, that the truth that you see
when you speak can be the end of you.

I won't fear that which put me here.
