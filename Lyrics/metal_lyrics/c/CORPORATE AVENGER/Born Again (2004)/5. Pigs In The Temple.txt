Feed the sickness of the victor
Crowd the icons with familiar
Fill the buckets of forgiven
Waste the value of the living.

You try to break me, shape me.
school me, fool me, but you will never rule me.

So do it, move it.
Come on and step up
if it makes you feel brave
Close your eyes and close your mind
if you think you'll be saved.

Speak it, preach it,
man I can dig it,
You don't think you're a slave,
When you close your time will your spirit fly,
are you sure you're not afraid.

So now you carry crosses to your victims
Yet another soul eviction
See the madness overtake them
When the answers all escape them

You try to break me, shape me.
school me, fool me,
but you will never rule me.

So do it, move it.
Come on and step up
if it makes you feel brave
Close your eyes and close your mind
if you think you'll be saved.

Speak it, preach it,
man I can dig it,
Your saviour made you a slave,
When it's time to die will your spirit fly,
are you sure you're not afraid.

So now there's pigs who wallow in the temple
Overcomplicate the simple
Missions killed our earth connection
Now we're left with no direction
So fill the vessels of the hollow
There's only poison left to swallow
Ancient knowledge gone forever
Now what holds us all together?

Medicine men down in the narrow...

You try to break me, shape me,
school me, fool me,
but you will never rule me.
