Behold
the glow
Blue Earth
and the knowledge it bestows
to our ashes, through our robes
into the universe we flow
Like water rising, the flood is coming,
and I don't think that you can hold your breath,
like water rising, it's all consuming
and we never learned to hold our breath

Don't talk about freedom
while you're building prisons all across our land
Your thunder and sky right on time
Don't talk about Jesus
while you kill the Gods that live inside our head

Below
we choke
on the smoke
from our arrogance we've shown
we don't listen
to simple wisdom
and soon enough we'll know
The fire's rising, the fire's breathing
and you never learned to hold your breath,
the fire's breathing, it's all consuming
and I don't think they'll be anything left.

Don't talk about freedom
while you're building prisons all across our land
Your thunder and sky right on time
Don't talk about Jesus
while you kill the Gods that live inside our head
Your thunder and sky

We're disconnected.
Circle mother
holy ground
coming from those here that love you
we want to sing a song
that when you hear shines like the sun above you
wash us in your soothing rain
Cold ice mountain hide your pain
That we have inflicted
with our memory loss of where we came

Teach the children all you can.
