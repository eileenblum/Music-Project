I heard a small man say that God is on our side
I don't think in Heaven
that they're waving the stars and stripes
It seems a simple mind, feeds the foolish man
I don't see any wars in my creators plan.
Leave our God out please, when killing human beings,
who are born to families in lands other than these.
cause,
There's no America in Heaven.
If God's got bombs we better not upset him.

I've heard the freedom cries from high upon the throne
They send our kids to die, but never send their own
If God almighty takes your side in killing man
Then God's your murder king who leads you by the hand.
Your divine beliefs that fuel the war machine,
the feeds us agony but one day you will see that...

There's no America in Heaven.
If God's got bombs we better not upset him.

A need to follow...
Then follow become fallen...
While those that lead
you know they never lead the charge,
and so we keep their secrets,
hang them from our reason,
borrow from our anger
and we pay their debts for war...

I heard a small man say
that God is on our side
