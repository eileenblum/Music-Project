Brave these things that your culture may survive.
A connection to land
they could not understand
so they came to remove them.
And their parents would cry
and be left asking why
but the soldiers ignored them.
Then they took them away
from the place they belonged to
and removed any trace
of their faith and their culture.

Any trace of the place they belonged to...
Memories
from children of those who came before
were stolen away forever
by soldiers that came to take them away
to their boarding school nightmare.

They fell from the sky
To this land where they died
And the spirits moved through them.
Till their language was gone
along with their songs
Seemed God no longer knew them.
Would a native race find a place in the future?
Would a painted face hide the pain of no culture?

Any trace of the place they belonged to...
Memories
from children of those who came before
were stolen away forever
by soldiers that came to take them away
to their boarding school nightmare.

We set the controls of our souls and head out for the sun
The day is long right now but soon winter will come
What's 30 miles from death could be a million miles from home
We can die among the trees, or live here all alone.
Memories

Any trace of the place they belonged to...
Memories
from children of those who came before
were stolen away forever
by soldiers that came to take them away
to their boarding school nightmare.

Brave these things that your culture may survive.
