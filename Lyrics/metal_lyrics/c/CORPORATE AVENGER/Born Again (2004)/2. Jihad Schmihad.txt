Seems evident You pray we die
Seems relevant To ask you why?
People die when devils fly
your religions poisonous
Jihad is a murder cry
disguised as self-defense
How can you wish, death on another
What kind of God says kill your brother
Death wish of a holy man?
Ordained by God himself?
Oxymoron evident
for how can faith be violent

In the name of the father
There is nothing holy about your war
They kill for Allah
There is nothing holy about your war
Death is their master
There is nothing holy about your war
For life ever after

Seems evident You pray we die
You will kill to take your place by my side
Hates your mission
know it well, kill the infidel?
Condemn their tiny unmade souls
and send them all to hell
What kind of love, says kill each other?
What will you do, when you discover?
That what you do has no excuse and is not heaven sent,
for no true God would justify, your disregard for human life.

In the name of the father
There is nothing holy about your war
They kill for Allah
There is nothing holy about your war
Death is their master
There is nothing holy about your war
For life ever after

So let me get this straight
you strap a bomb on your back
and murder thousands of innocent people
and all because they don't believe what you believe
and you're gonna end up in the kingdom of God?
Man you're out of your fucking mind.

Your mind, you're out of your mind,
out of your fucking mind,
to believe you'll be forgiven,
your mind, you're out of your mind,
you've lost your fucking mind,
in the name of your religion.
The gift is life we should not abuse it.
The word is love we cannot confuse it.
When our beliefs become ill conceived
they spread our disease and become our fear and lies
Twisting things these pawns of the crooked kings.
Deceivers of the dull humanity.
They sharpen swords on the words of the books
on the God they behead when
they pollute truth with lies.
These devils in disguise.

In the name of the father
There is nothing holy about your war
They kill for Allah
There is nothing holy about your war
Death is their master
There is nothing holy about your war
For life ever after
