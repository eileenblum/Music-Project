Jesus shit what a crock
Now you say that the church was built on a rock
But that rock is on top of the millions of dead
Who could not get that Jesus shit into their heads
No, no, no that's a lie
These are dishonest people with dishonest lives
Now they say that they know but they can't understand
how that version of Christ is a lie and a scam.
No more pearls to the swine,
why does saving your soul mean abandon your mind?
If there's power in God and the things that you say,
you should trust in his love and get out of its' way.
Why why why try to scare,
one's relation to God is a private affair
If your's taught to love then get on with your plan,
you don't have to destroy what you don't understand.
Tiny version... so incomplete.
Tiny virgin... so incomplete.
Holy rollers please call off your soldiers,
see your marching orders, they destroy our lives.
Pick up pieces from your soul diseases;
try to reconnect them with our ancient minds.
