They say that silence is golden
this comes as no surprise
when we retreat to the strength in the back of our minds,
inquire, decide, remind of a time, in line with the world outside.

Don't shoot, I can see the light in their eyes?
Don't you, I can see the light in their eyes?
They say that silence is golden
this comes as no surprise
when we retreat to the strength in the back of our minds,
inquire, decide, remind of a time, in line with the world outside.

You'll find me in the alone.
I'd fly from the sun to the moon.
Just to feel you, just to heal you, it'll be alright.
The journeys long to the place of healing let go into the light.

Don't shoot, I can see the light in their eyes?
Don't you, I can see the light in their eyes?
They say that laughter is holding the key to longer life,
when our defeat so complete that we don't even try,
we smile, relax feel good and be kind, then give to the world outside...

You'll find me in the alone.
I'd fly from the sun to the moon.
Just to feel you, just to heal you, it'll be alright.
The journeys long to the place of healing let go into the light.
You'll find me in the alone.
I'd fly from the sun to the moon.

My brother, these days won't be this heavy for long.
My sister, don't you choose to carry burdens alone.
Decent lives in tiny quarters, narrow shoulders, bearing their loads.
These days it feels the same, but the same can never return.
You see we try to find our place in life,
it seems like every day we sacrifice,
so many hours gone to pay for life,
don't let your point of life, become that sacrifice.
