In the history of the human race
Of all the inspirations for the separation of man from his true tribal culture
Of all the inspirations for the acts of violence from one man onto another
From one nation onto another, from one oppressor onto the oppressed
There is no more guilty party and inspiration than those books known
As the Holy Bible, the Koran, and the Bagavad Gita to spread separation of mankind

The Bible is bullshit, the Koran is a lie
The Bagavad Gita did not fall from the sky
These are the books that were written by men
They've caused wars, now follow if you can

They took away our love and gave us fear
Tried to make us hate the one who put us here
Then they took our sacred songs and made them wrong
Then they took away our prayers and gave us theirs

The Bible is bullshit, the Koran is a lie
The Bagavad Gita did not fall from the sky
These are the books that are written by men
They've caused wars, now follow if you can

First they created sin so they could win
Then they built the cages they could put us in
Then they took away our tribes and gave us jail
Then they took away the Earth and gave us hell

The Bible is bullshit, the Koran is a lie
The Bagavad Gita did not fall from the sky
These are the books that are written by men
They've caused wars, now follow if you can

It's time for you to love one another
It's time for you to recognize your brother
It's time for us to stop killing our mother
It's time for us to care for each other

The Bible is bullshit
