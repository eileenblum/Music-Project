Voting doesn't work 1-2-3
It's time you know your enemy
I won't pledge allegiance to hypocrisy
Your democracy, is not for me
So, when we try to change this place
Courtroom pulls an about face
Fantasies of the master race
Our elections they erase
See once upon a time we were all free
When we lived in tribal societies
Peace and harmony
And everything for the good of family
Yeah, cancer people can smoke weed
People voted to be free
But the fascist rule decree
Pigs arresting you and me
Voting doesn't work
Why?
When they don't like what we say then they stop it in the courts.
President this, president that
Represent the ruling class
One says this, one says that
Sounds the same what choice is that
See voting doesn't work 1-2-3
Coming from the NATION OF THE CHEROKEE
How can you choose when you don't have a choice?
How can you choose when you don't have a voice?
Yeah, interest games, their interest rates
Secret power fueled by hate
Fear for cash, cash for fear
Greenspan is the ruler here
Yeah, a pig is a pig
And they took it away
And I don't give a fuck about the things they say
It don't mean shit to me
Voting doesn't work, it's easy to see, that
Voting doesn't work
Why?
When they don't like what we say then they stop it in the courts
Voting doesn't work, I have seen
Along with piles of broken treaties
Your reality produces poverty, spiritually
In a nation of greed.
Well who is working, who is not
Think votes count, well I think not
Doesn't matter what we say
Things will always go their way
Power to the people is just a fantasy
And they sell it to us as an American dream
Well, your vote counts 1-2-3
Living in democracy
Everybody here is free
Cuz it's built for you and it's built for me.
Voting doesn't work
Why?
When they don't like what we say then they stop it in the courts
