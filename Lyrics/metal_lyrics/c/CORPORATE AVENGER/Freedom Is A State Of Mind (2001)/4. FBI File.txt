We're basically existing in a fake world, a world which was created by
man, the creator gave us the earth, put us here in the universe, he gave
us our minds, he gave us all these tools to exist and survive,
The war on drugs is a war on people...and peoples rights are being
violated and your incarcerating and caging human beings often times who
have are simply victims of the sickness of addiction, who have become
sucked up in this giant war on drugs, which in fact is a crime against
humanity. The war on drugs is a war on people.
FBI got a file on me
Too many cages in the land of the free
Join us now as we make our plea

Think they don't but they goddamn do
All seeing eye is watching you
Everything you say, and everything you do.

They rule by fear, I'm not afraid
Just give me back my tribal ways

The war on drugs is a war on people...It's a really sad state of
affairs when a human beings freedom is treated as nothingmore than an
asset or liability. Prisons are big business in this country. The war on
drugs is nothing more than a war on people ...it's a bullshit war, it's
a war over money.!!!!
