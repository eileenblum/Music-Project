It's like the powers-that-be have totally outlawed living, 
The natural way, the way that we were meant to live. 
You know, if you wanna hunt, or you wanna fish, you know 
You've gotta be in land. And if you're somewhere in land, 
It's trespassing against somebody these days and they'll put you 
In jail. So, if you wanna hunt, or fish, you've 
Gotta get a liscense, and in order to get a liscense, you gotta 
Work. And when you work, they take a portion of your pay, the sweat 
Off your back, and funnel it towards their military machine of 
Killing and death and sorrows. 

I'm not A Child Of Adam And Eve 
I don't need to believe in the wrongs from rights 
In your schools and in your brain 
You're so insane you claim you're right 

You say- War is good 
And war is right 
Another mother cries tonight, alright 

A killer, you keep working, and working, and working 
And they keep taking, and taking, and taking 
They'll throw you a few little crumbs 
They'll give you a home, a car, a television, a vacation 
Someday you might even have a little bank account that you're scared to lose. 

You stole the sweat right off my back 
Load me up with lies, not facts 
Still you do not answer for 
500 years of lies and sorrows 

War is good 
War is right 
Another mother cries tonight 
War is right 
War is fun 
Steal my money, build your guns 

It's like you never really own anything. You're only holding on to it. Cause when you die, the Government comes and takes half of what you worked for, even though they've already taxed you for a large percentage. They funnel all that money to their coffers, which go mostly towards spending on weapons of destruction. As the metal burns and the powder catches on fire, destroying the sacred lights of human beings who were put on this Earth to grow together in a sacred manner. 
It's all a bunch of bullshit actually. 

Take it to another level. 
Take it to another level. 
Take it to another level. 
Take it to another level. 

War is good 
War is right 
Another child cries tonight 
War is right 
War is good 
'Til it's in your neighborhood 

War is good 
War is right 
Another father dies tonight 
War is right 
War is fun 
Steal my money, build your guns 

Take it to another level. 
Take it to another level. 
Take it to another level. 
Take it to another level. 
Take it to another level. 
Take it to another level.
