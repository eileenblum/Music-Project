Justice System. Is there justice in the system? Or is it just us in the system? 

The love to drag your ass to court. This is the areana for their sick sport. They run for office and make more laws. 100,000 reasons to futher their cause. We get charged, we better watch out. A system of fear, what they make out. Either way it goes - good or bad. The attorneys get paid and they get fat. Is there justice in a world gone crazy? Where it's survival of the fat and lazy? The less you've got they've got you on your knees. You'll cop please, they get fees.... 

It's all such a web of lies. Attorneys are the spiders and we are the flies. 

One to prosecute, one to defend. One to judge you, and in the end, 12 of your peers are forced to sit in. As lawyers lie, so they can win. Either way, they get paid. We are the ictims with the laws they've made. They'll take your freedom, and then your home. They'll take it all, 'til you're all alone. Break up a family for a fee. I can't remember when I was free. Free to worship, free to speak. They never practice what they preach. 

It's all such a web of lies. Attorneys are the spiders and we are the flies. 

A country of laws and lawyers make them. Arm the police and they defend them. Books full of lies, but we don't believe them. Their jobs are secure, the long arms of the law. 

It's all such a web of lies. Attorneys are the spiders and we are the flies.
