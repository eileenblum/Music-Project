The world is like a sun in the darkness,
Absu lives in the deep dark, where Cthulu dreams and waits.
The black abyss of the world that can be reached
By some steps a set of seven gates where the place
Of a terrible and evil forces are found.
It is the genius god, the deceiving devil,
The spectrum, the worm of infinite wickedness.
The dead reign will awake and the incience will be over,
Magic will be get by the chosen one.
The seven zones over the earth detailed by the ancient races
That inhabited in Ur, in the lost temples.
These border lands ruled by the celestial spirits are the eternal underworld.
Purified before every moon, for every step.
