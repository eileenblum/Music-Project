And the world spoken for themselves and the demons
Whispered and the ancient race
Woke up the manuscripts
Exhaled wickedness of destruction,
Power, death and humiliation,
And the divinities found their ancient
And for all centuries of centuries
And by the black holes,
We will walk through the cosmos
Will shine in darkness
And the space will give us a bath of its rage and its laments.
With the great protection of the chosen one
By the part of the preferences
Of the ancients of their dominant and crushing return.
