Dead, the death lives,
The reign awaits and the doors of the Duat open up,
Shining light between the monstrosity
That siege in the death.
The fearful dragons, serpents and demons attack to the immortal future,
But with the word of the magic an mortuary text,
Nothing will stop them.
Great reign, oh great reign,
From my body nothing has been taken away.
Nor my viscera, nor my tongue,
And my head hasn't been devoured,
Oh you Osiris, who waits in the reign of the dead,
And your divinity grows up into me and into everyone.
Oh you Osiris, who dies to live due to your brother Seth,
Hail Osiris, our immortal father,
Proclaim up us your priests.
