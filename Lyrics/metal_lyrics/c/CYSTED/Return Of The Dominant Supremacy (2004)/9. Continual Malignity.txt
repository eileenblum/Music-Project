Ancient and vociferating of the deitities,
That take revenge by destroying with the air of the centuries,
The one that's not solicited,
The one who emits the lugubrious crushing sigh,
The energetic, darkness and silent that wrap up the stars,
It's the devil with serpental fangs of the eternal infinity,
With guttural voices on the skies of the spoken leng.
Powerful, capable of razing the valleys and the small earth
With an invisible destruction for the humanity,
Which annoys faceless,
He is heard, whose name is whispered
When his paths are inclined.
