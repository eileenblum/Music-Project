Lies that lead to hallucinate
Into the mind, creating sudden and depressive harmonies,
But sweet and at the same time cruel.
Taken to the death of thought,
To dream the death it sown expiration to eternity,
Where humans will be like immortals,
So when you are awake it will be so late to return,
It doesn't matter if I repeat it to you when you see it by yourself,
You will only feel the plague.
All the vociferations with rhythms of human destruction,
Total extermination, emanation of the inside force,
A smile of the inside force, a smile of sanguinary
and humiliative leadership on the prince's hidden face.

Manuscript:
When I come into the deep greens, when I put my mind into the valleys of the life
and the forgotten cult from their donation of the eternal principle,
allows me to take me in and when I am diving in the conscious discovery after an
adventure of confusion, I ran and ran for the ineffable world, dragging my own see,
and with a great weight in my own dreams plaged of evil demons that filled my head
and my dark thoughts in the solitude, where the chosen one triumphed over the humans,
because the desire of this was huge, so huge to want to pass the unknown dimensions.
He learned the new and splendid life of super discovery,
Where I was dragged for eternal days and driven to sow the reality.
Walking in the infinite searching of the resurrections of the lost souls through
cursed writings, staying alert from coming dangers of crushing whispers caused by the
wise emanation from the face of the earth to the humiliated humanity without forgetting
the thing who possesses the art of the wisdom, wish is the seed and it's the infinite
universal eternity, and again it's the reality of all our civilization.
