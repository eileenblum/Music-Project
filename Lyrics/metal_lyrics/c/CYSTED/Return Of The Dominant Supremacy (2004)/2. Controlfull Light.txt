A colossal and breathless
Spiritualism in the mental cataclysm of the magic
And power that impregnates from the throne
Everyone is scared that their entry will get soaked in blood,
And their bodies will be consumed by the splendorous devouration
Of the force upon the Earth.
The atmosphere reddens, the doors break down,
The millions vanish in their own nest
The great concavities are hoping to occupy
The reality of cannibalism and the serpent is each time more.
Devoured those who come across,
Slaughtered everyone at his feet,
Destroyed and torn apart
To be deposited in the divine grills of nightfall.
