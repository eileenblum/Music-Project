Invoke the beholder clean and simple,
So that he can be useful,
And with a flaming sword which will surround us.
Our deitities as an offering,
With the burning blaze.
On earth each step is to walk,
Over each step, each portal to enter
with its four poles fired up.
You will hear the messenger spirit of the sphere
That will tell us the name to pronounce before entering,
To the limit of the light stairs.
You will beg to the portal being inside,
And the wisdom;
The power over the spheres will be on you.
The world will be plagued by death, anguish,
The ancient free again,
And they will take their place one more time,
Over all mortal humanity.
