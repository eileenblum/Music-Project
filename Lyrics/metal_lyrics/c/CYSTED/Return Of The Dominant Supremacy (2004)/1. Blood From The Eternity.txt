From an immense and arid,
The offering of eternal life lives.
The gift from heaven, the gift of the great ones
Lays down on Earth.
The valley of the fertile strip
An the red Earth.
United by the great power,
That in day time it reflects the lights
Of the great god and in night
The moon emits its solitude.
Oh you, divine and the greatest one,
Where the prodigious monuments were made in your shores
And if the time destroys and laughs, the wise mocks time.
Oh you, here is the eternity
And the one of all of us
