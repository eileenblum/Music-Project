Puff up your chest
Lay it all to rest
One things clear I'm a victim to my head
How many cerbs have I fallen off of

All the shit you're holding up
I see through you
All the lies you tell yourself
I see through you
All the things
You hide
From yourself

I'm living day by day
All the shit you're holding up
I see through you
All the lies you tell yourself
I see through you
All the things
You hide
From yourself

Would you rather I'm dead
Or your perfect image instead
Leaving the dirt that I tread

I'm fierce with my heart in my mouth
I'm gonna scream it loud
There's only one person that I have to impress
And it's me
I'm gonna do me proud

I see through you
