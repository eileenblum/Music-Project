Be warned
Dadwneud y ddraig
When you here them hiss
They've been sidetracked
From the lines
Push the blind to the side

Be warned
There are some who will fake it
Be warned
There are some who will make it

I'm a creature of love
All is I ask is for some fucking respect
I'm free of torment
Spread the ashes
Oversaturation and incarnation
Call me cynical
I'm not biblical
I don't take literal
I translate into miracles

You have your close ones
Yet everyone's to stop you
With a knife in the back
Always finding reasons to give you slack
Once I show weakness they pack up and leave
Feels like nothing in this world has sympathy

Be warned
Dadwneud y ddraig
You have been warned
You will be burned
