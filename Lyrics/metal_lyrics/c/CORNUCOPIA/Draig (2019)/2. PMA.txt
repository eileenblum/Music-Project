Mental attitude
Thoughts of gratitude
The way to find solitude
Multiplicity in one personality
Different actions in different moments
With one personality
Harmonise differences
Becoming whole
Not clinging to one persona
Forever different
Forever changing
Apart of me is nourished
Multiplicity everywhere

You've been stepped on far too long
YOU CAN'T STOP ME
You've been stepped on far too long

Not under the laws of a dictator
Feeling great
Open my eyes to see

We deserve all that we strive for
There is no point dwelling in the past
Positive outlook, positive mind
It's always worth staying alive

Positive mental attitude
I will not be stepped on anymore
I will not be stepped on any - fucking - more
