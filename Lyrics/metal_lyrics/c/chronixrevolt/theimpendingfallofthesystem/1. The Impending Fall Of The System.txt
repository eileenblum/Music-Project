New times
Disguise falling
Of planners behind the curtain
Your money
Is the power
Buying freedom that was our by right
Lying system
That enslaves and kills
The base is crushed by the top
Promotion of wars
Exploitation of faith
Like gods, they control (everything)
But they fall as times go by
In their rush and despair gaps appear
A beam through the alienation
Their scapegoats will fall, in their wars for power,
proving their own genocide
Their lies wonât divide anybody else

[CHORUS]
Pyramids falling
Equality for all
End of the valve box
And its manipulation
End of their power
Decline of the empire
Eating their own bodies
With a putrid taste

An eye
That sees everything
Watching all the steps you take
Chips on wares
Chips on you
Fucking tracking cattle we are
To pay to live
In their own way
They have broken our free will

New diseases
New medicines
Building troubles, exposing (solutions)
But they fall as times go by
In their rush and despair gaps appear
A beam through the alienation
Their scapegoats will fall, in their wars for power,
proving their own genocide
Their lies wonât divide anybody else

Pyramids falling
Equality for all
End of the valve box
And its manipulation
End of their power
Decline of the empire
Eating their own bodies
With a putrid taste

Poisoned by our own state
That gains with their diseases
A forging culture
That divides and conquers
Stupid entertainment
Modern slaves in this utopia
Distorted in reality
With a supposed value of a green paper
Buying everything and everyone

But they fall as times go by
In their rush and despair gaps appear
The awakening call was sounded
We wonât be products anymore, true freedom will rise
and equality will destroy them
Their lies wonât divide anybody else
