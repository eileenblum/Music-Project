Never I thought my journey to be
The riding of waves upon this cruel sea
Titan awakes, in my mind evolves
From shanty of seadog and stories of old
Black dawn horizon beckons me forth
Into the abyss we ride
Set sail on course over boundaries of men
Where only the strong can survive

Embracing the moment in our time to come
The legend of iron men spirit lives on
Questioning nature and mans fear of god
Under the wasteland where we all belong
Black dawn horizon beckons me forth
Into the abyss arrive
Set sail on course over boundaries of men
Where only the strong can survive

Timbers crack beneath my feet
To expose the mysterious deep
Fingers breaking
I can't hold on
Torn apart by Neptune's song

Only the strong can survive
