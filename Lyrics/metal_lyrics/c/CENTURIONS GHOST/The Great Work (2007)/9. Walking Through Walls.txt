Especially to blame for
The damage that's been done
Intent to wage war upon
Mankind all creation
It just needs to be done

You must stand to fall
Work for one
Brand them all
Worship thee
This will be eternity

This will be the benchmark set forever

I walk through walls you have built inside your minds
I am the crushing fear that waits behind you

Upon the surface bliss
But underneath seathes something deadly
Thoughts so divine
Take time to judge a situation
Once over looked we shall befall you
Ending your line

You must stand to fall
Work for one
Brand them all
Worship thee
This will be eternity

I walk through walls you have built inside your minds
I am the crushing fear that waits behind you

Existence now rotting slowly
