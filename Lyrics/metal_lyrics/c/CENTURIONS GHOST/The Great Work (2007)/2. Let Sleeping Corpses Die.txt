Infinity is nothing
In the garden of the dead
The hand of doom put under
Six feet of earth
And a coffin for bed

Dead bodies walking
We don't know why
Hate, fear and loathing
Is useless
Let sleeping corpses die

Infinity is all
In the meaning of life
Always there, no tear at your skin
There is nothing left
But soul sacrifice

Dead bodies walking
We don't know why
Hate, fear and loathing
Is useless
Let sleeping corpses die

The dead are walking and are coming your way
You better watch out cos they ain't here to play
They want to catch you and to tear you apart
To greet you, to eat you and that's just the start

Death toll rises as the zombies live on
They won't stop until the meat is all gone
Bones and dust is all that will be left then
They've got you, now you too, are now one of them

Dead bodies walking
We don't know why
Hate, fear and loathing
Is useless
Let sleeping corpses die
