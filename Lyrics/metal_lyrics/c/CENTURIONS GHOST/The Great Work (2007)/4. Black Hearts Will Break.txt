Elation, sanctuary instilled in me
The words ring true
Spoken wise they lead me
Write my obituary
Fears grip won't keep me in
It's thrown my life the key
When will the end be
Cruel intentions
Through the darkness they will feed
All your minds inventions
I would love to believe
Sit back a shock implodes straight
Coal black hearts will break
Another fatal mistake
Leads me to the conclusion vile

In the shadows of the lost man
Lives a soul of strength
And with the pain to vanquish
He will rise again
In the valley of the demons
Lies a mist of mind
Yes the home is where the heart is
But I rot like wasted wine

You gave me the chance
Redemption I could believe
I loved you all the way to your grave beneath the trees
But it must be this way the shape it cannot alter
A mission sent from god, a plan that will not falter

In the shadows of the lost man
Lives a soul of strength
And with the pain to vanquish
He will rise again
In the valley of the demons
Lies a mist of mind
Yes the home is where the heart is
But I rot like wasted wine
