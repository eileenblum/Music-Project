Tonight follow the way that the black sky leads
Villains, lustful the thirst of the night
When we become something else
Prowl ground leave not a trace of the prize that's found
Curse this, or display your displeasure
Banished to darkness forever

Aloud, all hell breaks loose when they hear that sound
Hounds cry, the chase is about to ignite
And it's my head that's the prize
Anger displacement
I cannot trust in their patience
For the wrong I have made
The guilt I must feel for the part that I've played

An image has replaced your name
We will suffer this together, forever
For crimes committed you're now shamed

I hear fallen angels speak my name out loud
United by guilt they sing the anthem, sing it proud
We will suffer this together, forever
For crimes committed you're now shamed

And at the supreme moment
The seed springs forth

Carving lines in the wall
How the legends can fall
History repeats again
The age of men know not blood
They just know fear is weakness
Yet they don't speak it
Where is the tongue?

Karma aims a lightning bolt at the few,
Eternal sleep overdue
A blackened mass stand and wait at the door
And at the supreme moment
The seed springs forth
