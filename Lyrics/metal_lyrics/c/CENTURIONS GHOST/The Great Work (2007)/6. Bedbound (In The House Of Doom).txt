In the house
The walls are filled with stark reminders
Stains of glories old
Aspirations die
Blown away like dust
They settled for too long
Through the grief I feel I must be strong

I understand why you run and you hide, because I am the night

Doors slam that I thought were locked
Driven insane by the tick of the clock
I find a man that I must assume
As I'm bed bound in the house of doom

They scream my name
I'm hearing things again
The solitary silence marks a breakdown
I fell in my brain
Objects come alive
Point the finger, ask the question
Am I in control?
Or is this just a self-conscious suggestion

I understand why you run and you hide, because I am the night

Doors slam that I thought were locked
Driven insane by the tick of the clock
I find a man that I must assume
As I'm bed bound in the house of doom
