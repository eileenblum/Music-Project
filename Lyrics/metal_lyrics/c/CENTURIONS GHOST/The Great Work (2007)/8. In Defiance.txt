Adversity embraces me
In a world of cruel device
In my mind I'm so frustrated
I can't get no respite
People smile then cut me down
The moment my back's turned
One day soon they'll realise
It's them that I have burned down

Anger burns as my temper rages
I keep it all inside
In defiance my fist it clenches
I'll leave you all behind

Soaring high into the sky
On a doomsday revelation
There's no way that you can beat
True grit determination
Follow me and you will see
That we'll get there somehow
It's too late to bring me down
You can't stop me now

Anger burns as my temper rages
I keep it all inside
In defiance my fist it clenches
I'll leave you all behind
