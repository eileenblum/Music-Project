How can we search for the meaning of life
when death comes at a price for us all
The fact we exist for the right to be free
but at the end and the start we all crawl
to where we need to be

Time has me entombed
A filth encrusted womb
A dream I must pursue
To be born into a place I dwell upon

Time will be the death of all this bliss
I can't find a way to get through this

Moments passed will all intertwine
when your rise is exchanged for your fall
Natural instinct and the fortune we crave
gave the answer we seek above all, why we exist to be

Time has me entombed
A filth encrusted womb
A dream I must pursue
To be born into a place I dwell upon

Time will be the death of all this bliss
I can't find a way to get through this

Pushing and pulling me to the dark side
I realise how this establishment slides
Stone has been cast to decide
The fact you forgot the place you reside
All of my dreams multiplied
When I am god and you are denied

Time has me entombed
A filth encrusted womb
A dream I must pursue
To be born into a place I dwell upon

Time will be the death of all this bliss
I can't find a way to get through this
