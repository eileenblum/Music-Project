Midnight bright full moon shines the street is cold and quiet
An open window a naked room a creature's lonely cry

All your prayers they're useless now a man will turn to beast
Tonight until the morning comes he's ruled by evil greed

The ruler of the night the devil in disguise
He'll trap you all the way the victim of the change

In his cell the beast is kept but no chains can hold him back
Inside his blood is boiling hot his order is attack

If he hits you no use to run he fetches you to your doom
In lonely streets in dungeon's depth beware or you're a moonchild too
