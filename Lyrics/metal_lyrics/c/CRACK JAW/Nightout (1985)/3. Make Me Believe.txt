The Gods have sent an angel to find it is my task
She's radiant like the sun comes with a blast
And my doubts are still increasing
Whether I haven't found her yet
Cos there's light when you're appearing in my world

Don't tell me open secrets 'bout your descent and creed
Just take me to your homeland lay a claim on me

Make me make me make me believe it's you
Make me make me make me believe it's you

Your eyes are filled with promise to save my haunted soul
And if you don't mind save my body too
Cos I need to feel divinity in a rocking world of doubt
So come along and make my rational lights go out

I pray you to convince me take me to cloud nine
Or wrap me into ecstasy come on girl don't waste time
