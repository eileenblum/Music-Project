Once there'll be a time without any life
And in our space there'll be kinda light
A new day will dawn like the first morn
A planet will rise out of misty disguise

Oceans blue meadows too a lonely plain a settled aim
The prince arrives as human life to labour hard to rule on earth

Praise thy God for the day
Humble be what you pray
You're just flesh thru my will
In seven days I will regain my realm

Birth was given to earth the burden of life
To please and rejoice the eternal heights
But not very long the word was read wrong
For favour they fought just named a new lord

Hatred for love envy for help
War on the world relyin' on his word
Instead of a life of laughter and joy man chose pain
Words spoken'n vain

So the devil he has done his work
Seven day's creation man will burn
Stars and angels just wonder
Why is man keen on destroin'

And then one day and all may fade away:

Crack Jaw is:
