Running away from the spotlights
The vision of dreams becomes real
Shadows chase : I'm in the final race
I've been framed I ain't guilty
But now I'm serious case
Pray for me the world's my enemy

Night hide my figures or I will be damned

A sudden light in the darkness
I'm trapped if I can't fly
Betrayal the wood's on fire
The hunter's ready to strike now
Their guns are pointed at me
I'm running the odds against me

Send me a safeguard Lord take me away

Danger the fire's around me
Danger I'm in for the last race
Danger life's blood evades me
Save my soul on the edge
