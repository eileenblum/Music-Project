Eminent slaughter, etched in your mind
The cry of the victim, so peacefully sublime
You enter the killing fields, skills so refrained
You watch for the fear that they try to hide
Who will be first, your wrath will entwine?
There's a lesson to be learned
Euphoric chills, masochistic bliss surging down your spine
Waltz of the deranged
Threshold for pain soon to be tested
Fellow man is the game
Eg??? collide, to coronate the strong
Once in the killing fields you reach your apex
One by one falling with pleas of penance
Who will be next your wrath will entwine
Philosophy of the pit, you must bleed
Like a grunt in a hole, awaiting command
Adrenalized onslaught the fight is now at hand
Your first lash is met with little opposition
This brutal feet of rage proves no competition
You... I don't dislike you; simply put, you must bleed
You... no qualms against you, simply put, you must bleed
You... simply put, you must bleed
Lost in their curtains of black
These curtains of black, which now befall your eyes
Merciless debauchery, twisted game, the ultimate therapy
Your feats are enshrined
Broken bones, souvenirs of your crimes
Feats are now enshrined, your brutal fit of rage proves no competition
Aroused by the brutality
Obedient to the pleasure of your macabre ecstasy
