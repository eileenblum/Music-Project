Outrage accelerating with your rhetoric
Racial crimes on the rise
You're in the limelight
Judas, traitor to yourself
Hypocrite, greedy shit
Die by your own
Why don't you realize
Hate's grave serenity
Desist all your treacherous lies
Awaken normalcy
Drawn to animosity
Soldiers of the hate trade
Disciples of disparity
Soldiers of the hate trade
Condoning all asperity
Soldiers of the hate trade
Enticing irrationality
Soldiers of the hate trade
The time has coming when you'll finally see
Spewing forth acrimony
Loyal plans they proceed
Spreading the fire of mans end
Now as you stand amidst the ashes
Solely response for the butchery
Pockets overflowing with the blood of your ancestry
Fueling their rage
The death of morality
Time is coming you have to see
Lost is your sanity
Men seek their life's revenge
Arresting the fire of man's end
