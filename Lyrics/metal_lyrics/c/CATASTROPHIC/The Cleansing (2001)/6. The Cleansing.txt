Besieged... as peace is overthrown
Decades of hatred culminate
Stripped... of all rights to coexist
Their presence never welcomed in the first place
The dawn of the cleansing
The harbinger of prejudice and solidarity
The cleansing
Antagonized by the banter of a tyrant
Encouraged to lose restraint
A state sanctioned slaughter... eradication of the weak
The past again shows it's ugly face
The pawns of all disparity
The cause and the remedy of their suffering
Cancers to society
Lesser forms of life
Subordinate to their ethnicity
Dirty hateful pagans... dirty hateful pagan race
Their identities... erased
Nameless pigs... disgraced
Cleanse
Marauding the towns, dragged into the streets
The innocent victims of insanity
The men are round up for mass execution
Women used to satisfy torrid needs...
