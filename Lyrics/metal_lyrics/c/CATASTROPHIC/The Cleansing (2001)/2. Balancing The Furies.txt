Science keeps growing ahead of society
Revolutions and breakthroughs answer some of the mysteries of life
Searching for a better understanding of how the clock ticks
Creates an age ominous salvation
Decode the gene, conduct a recipe for life
Traits to select, prescribed birth
Endeavor of a cruel past accepted as a road to knowledge
Yet history's attempts condemned as sadistic
The present's work awarded as heroic
I see no difference, it is still breeding the perfect seed
It's still trying to play god, tampering with destiny
Defying the path that we call life
Prolonging an existence, time ceases in a frozen cell
Cryogenic slumber, to rise again upon a cure
Man is not deserving immortality
You live and then you die
Stop trying to rewrite the book
Days have arrived for balancing the furies
Be grateful for the span given to grace the earth
Embrace mortality
Reject the thirst for infinity
Fate becomes obsolete
Technology devours sense
Child is born with no preoccupation
Yet another way to feed human greed
There lies a price for every breath taken past the bell's toll
Gifts of the earth raped of purity
Genetic alteration to the kin of a natural seed
Convictions irrationally adamant
A race with no future, awarded with obscurity
Lands afar feel they have the need
To employ natural selection
The matriarch shall only conceive
Another tool to heave the gears
Contribute to productivity
Days have arriving for balancing the furies
Accept the times given to grace this existence
Embrace the fact, life's not meant to be eternally
The mysteries are crystal clear
You live and then you die
Stop trying to rewrite the book
