Upon the threshold thousand years have passed
All hearts are filled with trepidation
The probability of an impending turning point
Have masses all bracing for the final cataclysm
They arrive, sent to save the human race
Choose your messiah, all worries that erased
Eternal solace, accompanies immortality
Surrender you will for bliss and divinity
They feast upon the weak
They promise false security
Their arrival has been preordained
Disciples of your deity
The prophecy it speaks
Ending all humanity
Jesters of the millennium
Charlatans deceive
Jesters of the millennium
Deified in their places
Jesters of the millennium
Treachery reigns supreme
Jesters of the millennium
Yet the destitute believe
Look to the book
All doubts will disappear
Scenario breeds the rise of chaos
The elders foretold
A sky bleeding fire
