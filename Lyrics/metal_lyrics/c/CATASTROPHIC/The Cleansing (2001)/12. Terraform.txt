As the sun scorches the planet
Oceans growing warm
Rain keeps falling beyond capacity
Man fears nature's storm
Is it part, is it all part of some plan?
Is it a systematic terra-formation for the inheritors of this land?
Submerged faults, swallow the seas
As we stand upon the threshold of tragedy
Polar masses melt away
Rising the deep, devouring humanity
Ozone layer dissipates
Greenhouse gasses suffocate
While they wait patiently
Existence is suicide
Catastrophic, destiny
Winter brews vicious storms...terraform
Summer's lasting way too long...terraform
Surep cells twisters are born...terraform
With lifting waves into walls... terraform
The perfect silent assassin
Leaving us with no contingency
Crushed to pieces in the grip of the earth
Climatic execution
A war that cannot be won
As the arid deserts saturate
Frozen poles incinerate
As the tropics reverse
Tidal paths are torn
Pushing earth's majority violently ashore
Civilization drowns
The ones not yet in the path frantically flee from the beast that races on
With no escape knowing you are going to die
Mother has finally killed her children
