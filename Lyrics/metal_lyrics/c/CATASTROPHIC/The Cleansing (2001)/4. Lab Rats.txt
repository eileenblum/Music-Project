Exposure, the prototype planet
Using the fruits from the land which we inhabit
Living, in a race of the amiss
Drink amongst the tainted ones
Mother earth's fatal kiss
Viral catastrophe contagious air we breath
Water filled with tritium or laced with cyanide
Scentifiec operativies experimenting on their own kind
Introduce into our systems
These toxic elements
Control humanities regeneration
Monitor the effects and kill off the masses
Contamination of the staples and all that us needed to survive
Release their endemic agents upon our lives and profit of the search for a cure they already have
Lab rats
Saving the stricken not fiscally plausible
The hordes need to suffer for them to thrive
Utopia is realistically impossible
Morality thrown aside to protect the bottom line
Infested the populace demographically, the fools need balancing throughout their lives
Utopia is realistically impossible
Humanity met with disregard to protext the bottom line
We are not your guinea pigs
We will not sit silent as you steal the lives beneath our feet
Ignorance will crumble
How could you let all we hold sacred perish?
How could you ignore the painfully desperate cries?
The thought that you let them all die to save merit
Boggles the mind
For this we'll take your life in penance
Final seed is sown as anarchy arrives
Chaotic insertion is what's needed to survive
Animosity and rage filling all eyes
Still searching for the answers
Please, tell me why?
Viral catastrophe, contagious air we breath
Water trapped with tritium or laced with cyanide
Scentifiec operativies experimenting on their own kind
Lab rats
