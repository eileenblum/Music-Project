All these walls standing in my way
Confusing me, what the hell to do
I just can't seem to get it right
I just don't comprehend
I guess I never will
Oblivious to this etiquette
No rites of passage or criteria is never met
I really could live without your cynical righteous advice
Just leave me on my way
I am totally content
Lost
A wayward soul
An onlooker
In your world of needs
Don't need your help
Don't need a guide
I am the catalyst of my demise
I don't remember requesting your presence
I don't recall asking for your criticism
I have heard this shit a thousand times before
I am going nowhere fast
Falling out the door
Life's tragedies strengthen
The pain factor
Ordained to suffer before I rise
My endless trinity
The pain factor
Follow my path wherever it leads
I live and learn and die and burn
I make mistakes like everyone
I'll pay the price to right the wrongs
I never told you that you had to like it
Confusing me, what the hell to do
To get respect in turn you have to give it
It's part of the process when you fall flat on your face
I'll never fall victim to conformity
Never will I stand in cadence
At times I don't concur with your philosophies
Just go our separate ways
Left to our anatomy
Lost
A wayward soul
An onlooker
In your world of needs
Don't need any help
Don't need a guide
I am the catalyst of my demise
