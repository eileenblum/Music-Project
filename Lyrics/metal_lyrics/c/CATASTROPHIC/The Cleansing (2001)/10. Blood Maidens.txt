Heathens, with their luscious offerings
Invited into the dreams of the men who call
Blissfully possessed, immersed by the taste of the orgasmic feast
Insatiable the sex, total fulfillment of forbidden dreams
Filled with rage to fell the lust
Skin so sweet, feast of flesh
Hypnotized by the obsession
Satisfy their demented needs
Maids
Deep into the bowels of the forest a presence looms detected by all
The chill of lore and legends for centuries
Too torrid to be fact, witched they are called
Succubus, essence too heavenly to defy
Slowly they process to imprison their mates
Piece by piece disintegration, finally raped of all sanity
Complete entrapment of soul possession
Compensation for the ecstasy
