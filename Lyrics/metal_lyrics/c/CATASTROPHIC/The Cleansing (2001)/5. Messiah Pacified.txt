On the eve of a crucifixion, one man spoke to his peers
His words were proud, his words were true
Models for the evolution of his plight
Adamant his quest, his resolve attested
Immolate his cherished life to desist the trickery
Intended to echo for centuries
Disobedience responsible for his destiny
His words are heard to put an end to the treachery found in the faith
Man must be told he is the exploited
Too much a threat to their necessity
Messiah pacified
Silence the man, silence his words
The future remains ignorant
Stoic to man made sins, fearful of reprisal
Centuries of lies, sleep buried in the sand
Present days curiosity, the sleeping prize
Ascends the ground to mesmerize
The ultimate deception, victims of inveracity
Minds amass, the translation
The aftermath, death of the hierarchy
Confess the guilt, acknowledge years of perjury
Never exalt in their supremacy
Too much to lose, nothing to gain
Messiah pacified
