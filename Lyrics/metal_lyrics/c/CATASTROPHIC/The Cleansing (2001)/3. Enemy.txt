Dreams, no more guaranties
Wake up and considered lucky
?????????? conditions are prevailed everywhere, while you're the object of some inner hate
Somewhere your views, your ideologies, the color of your skin
The way you decide to compose your life does not concur with opinion
Political correctness, it shadows everything
Inflicting each and everyone, nothing unscathed
They will decide what rights will be bestowed
What happen to equality, it's under consideration
Passive and obedient, their Utopian society
Now has lost it's niche, just satisfy the uppers
They decide what rights will be employed
A pseudo totalitarian hierarchy
Individual thought, that's much to dangerous
They will do the thinking: we're just the commons
There's no way, we are able to conceive
Who is a threat to our freedom, it's not the enemy
Wearing the mask, to hold the spotlight what fueling your ego
Feeding the fishes, your image just so fake you truly could not give a damn
Throw us a line, then watch us take the bait-hook, line and sinker
Play with our devotions and aspirations and never complete the deed
The lies, the greed
The empathy, we're just the commons
Enslaved to their supremacy
Ask yourself, who threatens our freedom and see it's not the enemy
The hate, the unrest
It's not the enemy, raping our rights
It's not the enemy, the enemy
