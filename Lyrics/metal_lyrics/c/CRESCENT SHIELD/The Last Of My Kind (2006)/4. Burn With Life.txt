Believe in what your heart will say
Changing from day to day
Blood red star
The fire lost inside
Hot lungs will breathe the pride
Open wide

Breathe fire, light your eyes
Ingest the flames that cold dreams will soon burn bright
One with fire, burn with life
Never again will the eyes of the dark days see

One life, one chance to live again
And never die my friend, unending
From cold depths of the sea
Feeling the energy
Of pure lightning

Touch fire, from the sky
And soon the power will flow and inspire
One with fire, burn with life
The water's name is fear

Don't close your eyes
Don't shun possibilities
Fools never try
Unless it leads to quitting
Never satisfied
All days have an ending

An outsider hides
Left in the world alone
Cuts all the ties
Will not let his life unfold
He will drink the cold, hard, water FEAR!

[Solo]

Warm, and dry out your veins
Kindle the flames
From ashes we grow stronger
Feel the fuel unload
The spark now explodes
We're ready now to all ignite

Breathe fire, burn the night
Long live the flames that eternally blaze bright
One with fire, burn with life
Pass on the torch that bears the power of our cries
Touch fire, light the sky
We'll always BURN FOREVER!
One with fire, burn with life
never again will the eyes of the dark days see
