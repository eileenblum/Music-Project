I'm the last of my kind, the last one left to die
In somber towers I reside, a mass of climbing spires
Upon a cruel and glaring plain, am I cursed again
Another day sinks with the sun, the end is coming soon

I the blood to fill wasted veins of the dead
They rise again
I challenge the laws, my subjects I now shall command
Not quite alive...bring forth life!

Day after day, to pierce through the fabric of time I toil away
Night after night, and there stands a life from the past in my machine
Lives insane!

The empty ways, raging screams from towers tall
The city fears specters who pantomime love.

My wasted dreams, time it grows old, I lay down and die
A dying sea, it's lonely and cold, I lay down and die

[Solo]

I let loose my force and reach to the core of the earth for a place to rest
For millions of years I slept while the world it evolved, now I rise

A blank expanse of dried up (red sun melted) dead seas
Eternal sleep, return to dust of the world

My wasted dreams, time it grows old, I lay down and die
A dying sea, it's lonely and cold, I lay down and die
No words to say, I crumble and fall, a tear I won't cry
My final day, my ears hear the call, I lay down and die

[Chorus]

My final days, time now to lay down and die
No words to say, my time to lay down and die

The last of my kind, I lay down and die
