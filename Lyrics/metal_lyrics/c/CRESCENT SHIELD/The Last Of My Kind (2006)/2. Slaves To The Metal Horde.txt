Comes a day like before
To a day that's never seen
Fix your eyes on it's majesty
In time you'll be sworn
Feel the power inside
And let yourself smile
One is the all, who will be chanting

Sail far away from the slaves of hastened silence
Call out the name of the slaves
Will know will never die
Fight till the end, for we know it never betrays
The metal will never die as long as we are alive!

Mesmerizing, there will be no return
Enterprising, we are slaves to the metal horde
Onward we fight to our destiny's end
We are the reign that shall flow to the sea
Ever strong, ever hail, never fall, never fail
You will listen to the metal hordes!

We shall break all the bones
That the quiet keeps whole
With our hands held up high
Our chains we now receive...

To be slaves, to kill the hastened silence
We are the name to the slaves
Who will all soon be born
Rise and control the truest form of power
Let the metal flow into your blood
From blood you will draw life

Hear our calling
From hell you will return
From the fallen
Your a slave to the metal horde
Conformed and confused is the rest of the world
As a slave you will find yourself free
Never lost, never wrong, is the soul of the song
You will listen to the metal...

[Solo]

We will control the truest form of power
Call out the name, who the slaves
Will know will never die
Rise to the sound
Which will never fall to silence
The metal is always alive in your blood
From blood you will find life!

Hear our calling
There will be no return
Ever marching is the slaves to the metal horde
Onward we fight to our destiny's end
We are the reign that shall flow to the sea
Ever strong, ever hail, never fall, never fail
You will listen to the metal...

Conformed and confused is the rest of the world
(Hear our calling)
As a slave you will find yourself free
Never lost, never wrong, is the soul of the song
(Ever marching)
You will listen to the metal horde!
