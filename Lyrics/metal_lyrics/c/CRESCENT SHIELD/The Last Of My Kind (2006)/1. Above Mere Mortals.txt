Honor the dead that have fallen
Don't let true spirits die
Unearth forgotten elders
Again the warriors rise
Bring forth the swords and armor
Our fists will touch the sky
Over the faceless masses
On black steel wings we fly

[Chorus:]
Rising, flying, above mere mortals
Heed the call of metal warriors - ride high
We rise higher than mere mortals
Hear the cry of metal warriors - they fly

Atop the highest mountains
Across the barren land
A voice that sings like thunder
A song that rides the wind
Lay siege to pawns of order
A war that never ends
Stand fast we claim our victory
We are fueled by the deepest rage

[Chorus]

So much of the world unconquered
Will taste the true blood made of steel
Defending the faith, our mission
We will die before we ever fail
Our true regime, pure metal, one and for all
The spirit unstained, forever will we be!

[Solo]

Our sound unfading, ruling the sky
Our seed we planted, is growing still

Though heard our voices never listened (Our faith unquestioned)
Loyal like blue oceans tide
So rise our mighty flag (Our need never quelled)
And look on...FOREVER!

[Chorus]
