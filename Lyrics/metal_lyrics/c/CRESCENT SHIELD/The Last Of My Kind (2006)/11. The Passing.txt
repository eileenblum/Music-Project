[Intro Chant:]
Come forth the barely learned
My child filled with fear
Your time has come for passing
For fair rules not found here

Blessed the tears of fallen
The rain of sorrows past
Destroyed by kin of papal
Your truth will rise too fast

Fair fallen, have no fear
Hold back thy tears of pure
What you see, what you hear
Understand is nevermore

Lost child, lost kindred
Pay no heed to "Inferi"
Soon will be your crossing
Years ago is when you died

PAIN you feel is not discomfort
To tortured you could have had
My eyes of tearful solace
Dried from the time when time began

Hold you will to the earthly pleasures
And friends of long gone past
Look one more time from the life you came
For it will be your last

One moment, one memory
Turns to dust before your eyes
Take my hand, one with me
For this is the last time you shall be
So alone

Where is it you all come from
Eternally I'll never know
Yet still I grant thee passing
Concede from your life and I'll let you go

Death is your last memory
Transition to a sphere of life
Maybe one day we'll meet
Again if life has made you feel
Too alone

[Solo]

Now let go
Pass and see
Now rest in peace
Forever!

One kindness, Your memory
And a trace of life you left behind
Many more, souls I'll see
I'll remain until the end of time
All alone

[Repeat Intro Chant]

One moment one memory
Forever alone in an unearthly plane
( A child's guide too unseen)
My kindness, your memory
Forever lost inside your eyes...

Still unknown...
