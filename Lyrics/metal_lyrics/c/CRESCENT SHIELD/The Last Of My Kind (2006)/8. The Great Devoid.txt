The masses are following something that they can not see...but believe
Such faith is respected for I also once did believe...but no more

Scream you'll hear no answers
Incantations give no cause
Pray to only nothing
No one will hear your asking thoughts
You futilely share

For ten thousand years there was something
man felt so divine... invented

Slaves will build the temples
The priests will find a rule
Kneel in front of something
Created to fill the great void
That's always been there

What causes my living, dieing
How does my mind feel laughing, crying

I do not know the answers of questions to deep
Why must we find the answers that we'll never see

[Solo]

Look into space and it's pure blackness that you will find...not darkness
Look at the sky and you'll know it's the sun that makes light...not angels

Earth's core is made of fire
The clouds look heavenly
Hell is not below us
No one will find eternity
When our time is here

I must keep learning, feeling
Nothing will stop my yearning, loving

I understand the need to explain the unknown
I can feel the truth inside that brings me to this great divide
I will believe if science will provide the proof
Logic is all I deploy while resting in the great devoid

Holy wars we will fight
Who is watching?
Baptize, repent your penance
To their god untold

[Solo]

I must keep finding, seeking
Nothing will stop my final ending

I only feel the power from my inner mind
I now know the truth I'll hide that keeps you on the other side
Always believe, I'll never try to poison you
Logic is all I deploy while resting in the great devoid

The great devoid...
