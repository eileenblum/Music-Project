Chosen, equal, last two shadows
Challenge, both heed the call
Strength and knowledge, calm and patient
Arena, both watched by all

I've been here waiting for all time
To find my adversary
Will this be the last day that I'll see
Or the first to live forever
We will...

[Chorus:]
FEEL the force and might
Uncertain eyes await the champion
One will rise above...one will fall
HAIL! the victor's right
Gather round to crown the champion
KNEEL! the winners name
Will stand tall

Weapons chosen, clash with steel force
Wounded, both blood does fall
Careful, cunning, skill so well taught
Stalemate, both will not draw

I feel the power of my enemy
At last my adversary
This will be the last day that he sees
So I will live forever
They will...

[Chorus]

Such new found glory
I'll fight to feel alive
The reaper also awaits
Even he does not know who will die

[Solo]

Raise the fallen body from the ground
Remember his name with honor
Not lost but not won in the end
Respect I'll feel forever
Now we...

KNOW the force and might
Certain eyes await the champion
One did rise above...one did fall
HAIL! the victor's mine
Gather round to crown the champion
KNEEL! for my own name
Will stand tall
