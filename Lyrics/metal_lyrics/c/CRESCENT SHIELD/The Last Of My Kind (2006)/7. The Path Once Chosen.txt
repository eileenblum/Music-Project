Sailing the violent seas, churning waves
Drifting aimlessly, like a child on an endless ocean
Still my path is set for me , I'll push away
Downwind south sail into tranquil waters

[1st Chorus:]
Sail on- the course is set for me
Sail on- on ocean's arms
Sail on- by the wake of sorrowed tears
The path is set again for me

The path that is before me isn't burned in the ground
And the footsteps that are left behind
are the victims of the wind and rain

[2nd Chorus:]
Walk on- The trial is still unseen
Walk on- To history
Walk on- Knowing now what is my guide
And the path's enough for me

[1st Chorus]

I'll always know the way
From traveled days
To the unknown

I'll always find my way
From day to day
Here I'll stay

[Solo]
[1st Chorus]
[2nd Chorus]
