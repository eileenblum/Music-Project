A swollen tired sun will soon die
The stars will form above and below me
My moon it closely follows it's light
A razor thin reflection will humor
And crack the

Smile of the red crescent moon
Solace on the crimson horizon
Pride of the red crescent moon
Rule within the sky of forever

The city and high clouds remain blind
My eyes can be the only witness
Glisten to the atmospheres curse
And follow the fate of the light who creates you

Time of the red crescent moon
The night governor has fallen
Night of the red crescent moon
Slips into the sea of the fallen

[Solo]

Smile to me
Sing to me
And fill my soul with the beauty's end of day
You fade away
To reveal your name
And when you rise again,
You'll feel my faithful presence standing there

I will be there
For your moonlit night
You'll see me standing there
Under your borrowed light
Eyes so clear
Understand mysteries you bring forth on to me
Light on to night
Ever wonder you give to the life that you live
All dressed in the sun's delight
Of the tide you control is the rhythm we know
When the night is cast away
To the beauty's end of day...
