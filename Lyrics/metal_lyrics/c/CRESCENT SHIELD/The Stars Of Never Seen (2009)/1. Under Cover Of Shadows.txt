[Part I: Cast of Shadows]

Those who cast a blanket
Of perpetual dusk
Those purveyors of vile, black mystery
Those cults of the arcane
Speakers of murky tropes
And those who wear a mantle of threadbare illumination...
Be gone!

[Part II: The Vengeance of Light, the Cover of Shadow]

Draw your weapons, bare your claws
The conjured beast is nigh
The violent cleaving of the ground
Is not a trick of light
Strike forth, lash out the song of war
Dark spirit hounds can kill
Scuttle and run or hide again
And on they follow still
On and on

Under cover of shadows
To lie still is to wither and rot
Paralyzed eyes (of silent lies)
On fear they do feed
And murder with calm folded hands

Unloose the fire in your lungs
Spit venom, seethe and fume
Scatter the bones of the incubus
Cut like whetted stone
Fight on, fight on with axes drawn

Pound thunder from the drums
Rive the misty flesh of imps
Tear out their prattling tongues...Ride on!

Under cover of shadows
Silence will fester and hollow
Spellbinding fire and smoke in our eyes
On relic charms they must feed us lies

[Judgment solo]

[Part III: Consequence]

The blanket of dusk has fallen
And black mystery still rising
And again recite their creeds

[Part IV: The Witch Chant]

There are no truths that cannot bear falsity
There are no things never known
No secret doctrines
There are no words that are never to be touched

They'll tell you that the sun's disappeared
And night stains eternal
(Don't ever close your eyes, don't ever turn your back)
Gray fades to black (Blackness is light)
The dark sky descends to blot out the shadows
The ones you hold so dear...fallen
Like the very last tear
Remember the night before
Bind the cloak and hide under cover of shadows

[Part V: The Elusive Epilogue]

Under the cover of shadows
To lie still, to wither and rot
Paralyzed eyes
We secretly hide
On relic charms they will feed us lies

Lift the cover of shadows!!!!
