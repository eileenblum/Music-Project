Looking ahead, innocence mine
Before me lies the life I'll find

I will never forget that first midnight I crossed awake
I felt that first powerful song alive and free
It was there so real and close as the stars I did see
And I touched, then listened to new whispers
To this day they are still calling me

I saw the glory
And the treasures I'll take tomorrow
I wrote my own story
10,000 midnights ago

I never knew I'd change voices
Never thought of the angel's disdain
Deep down I know my efforts have dwindled
But the dreams they still stay the same
Here and now I'll take the time that is mine
To reach, my tranquil, domesticity
The home that I left long ago

I found the answers
Leaving me with more questions unknown
And I long for that memory
10,000 midnights ago

The eyes I had as a child still remain in me
Memories are vivid paintings I still see

Rest thy head traveler man
Who has seen many empty miles
Your heart will find home

[Solo]

Far away still is my grave
Unknown are the years I will own
The once forsaken whim, the absurd of age
I'll try to deceive once again

Help me, find me, heal me
I'll try again
Older, wiser, closer
To my home

I have found the answers
To the questions I asked long ago
Once more I'll identify
The dreams of 10,000 morrows

I chose my destiny
10,000 midnights ago
And I sealed my fate to be
10,000 midnights ago

Looking behind, innocence died
Lost are the days of bygone time
