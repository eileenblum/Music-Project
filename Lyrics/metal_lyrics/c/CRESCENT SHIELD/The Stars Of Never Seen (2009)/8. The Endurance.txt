[Part I: A Third Gathering]

Brave men wanted
For hazardous journey
Low pay, bitter cold
Moths of complete darkness
Constant danger
Safe return doubtful
Great recognition in case
Of success

Ernest Shackleton
The south facing madman
Will try for a third time
To walk at then end of the world!

Five thousand responded for
A crew of thirty on a
Brave sailing ship
Along for the journey were sixty-seven
Of Canada's finest four legged ice runners
To speed...the men
And their dreams
Across...and alive!

From the years I have learned
Twice before I returned
Under stocked and overwhelmed
Lost what I sought

More seasoned and well prepared
The continent again I dare
To reach the pole again I drive
Let it be the end
This time alive!

[Part II: To Stab the Sole of the World]

South!
We sail with pride
Our keel will slice the ocean's heart with anger once more
Feel the wind at our backs, and our faces...

Already charred with frozen black!

We meet once again
My old foe South Atlantic
Spawn of jigsaw ice all around
The cracks closing in
Till there's no more

Imprisoned in this icy hell!

Here so close
To the land of last and barely found
For the winter we will batten down
Never given...
Honor to stab the sole of the world!

(Listing)
Free the ship with ax and pick
(Breaking)
Loot the ship with quick and wit
(Sinking)
Abandon ship...abandon ship!

What the ice shall take
The ice shall keep!

"She is gone...none more to say"

Ice gleaming sunshine
Five feet to the deepest blue

[Part III: Run On Water]

North!
We run to save our lives
The albatross and emperors
Have sung our due dirge
Warmth will keep our souls alive
We move with haste through
Jaws of cracked bergs
We haul small boats that carry life
We only have necessities as
Bare as our skin
Vile, the hide of ocean's dead
Flesh of the dogs
A pleasure filled sweet meal!

No dreams in brief sleep
In the midnight light
So terrified!
Hungry ice swallows me

Cold sheets argue louder now
They find we're so terrified
Follow no horizons seen

We row to where we do not know
Deception Isle, too many miles
On cracked numb black fists
Cold, a word no longer known
Far beyond the freezing snow drifts
Eat, we see in only dream
A cannibal's insanity
I see in thine eyes
Drink in the salt and misty rain
Still pushing north
To the Elephant's domain

There on the crashing walls
Of black jagged teeth
So unbelieved
Last land
We could ever see!
We will try to endure
(South Georgia our final try)
Will we ever meet again?
Where will we meet again?

[Solo]

[Part IV: The Endurance Within]

Two years of death yet all survived
Endurance had to be the key

On painted waters we awake to find
A day of wonders so divine
The Yelco awaits on the silent sea
Is thee, the angel of death that we see
This isle of life, now left behind
We leave nothing but our own demise

My loyal comrades never left my side
(Honest bravery)
In the black icy sea, the secrets and memories
She will always keep
(On land, on ice or on the stormy sea)

The endurance we have left behind
Endurance we will always find
