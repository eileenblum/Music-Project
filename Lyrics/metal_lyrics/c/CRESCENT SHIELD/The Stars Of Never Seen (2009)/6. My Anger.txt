Once again I'm here within
The source of my emotions
Sadness dies as envy tries
To build my inner fire
Spawn of father evil and then
Bred by mother revenge
Can feel the lion of my rage
Breaking free of his cage

In this state
It's not wise to be near me
Or you will be the first
To see

My anger
True and sure so raw and pure
The anger
Enjoy the flood of boiled blood
Until I'm cold again

How I'd love to place you back
To your pathetic weakness
Give me reason to find justice
For my fallen anguish
So many times, so many ways
Have I constructed vengeance
It's strength from pain, the source of war
And Metal's muse unequaled

Time is right
Body is quaking
You won't be the last
To feel

My anger
True and sure so raw and pure
The anger
Feel the flood of boiled blood
My anger
Will volumize my own darkness
The anger
Forever feeds my violent needs
Till the end of time

Tasting sweet aggression
Intense eyes won't leave you
Now behold it's power
I command

[Solos]

Time is mine
I am anger
Now you'll be no more

My anger
True and sure so raw and pure
The anger
Feel the flood of boiled blood
My anger
Will volumize my own darkness
The anger
Forever feeds my violent needs
Till the end of time!
