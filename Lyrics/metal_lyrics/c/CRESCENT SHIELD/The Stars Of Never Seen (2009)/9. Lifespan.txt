For some it lasts for seconds
For some a thousand years
Time's a given, and time we take
There lies a line of all our fears

For some it's just a minute
For others the same's a hundred days
Some old survive, or young will die
And all who live can not decide...

How many days are given
As a predetermined guarantee
We think we'll live forever
By the reward of our better deeds

Man writes of his denial
And many praise of what could be
The animals are given
The answer of true fate that we choose not so see

End to an end is our own lifespan
Our only one since time began
Imprint of our mold thus soon destroyed
Then is the fall of the hourglass sand

Hold true to your thoughts and your memories burned
In your mind remain till the call of your last day
Truth is the song, the finite dance
End to an end is our own lifespan

I don't believe in heaven
Or hell or afterlife
From book to truth, is dust to dust
And I will not reincarnate

I'm terrified of dying
I now know why the prey do run
For once it takes for all to end

The first time in my life I see...

How few the days are given
And knowing of just how they'll be
Nothing lives forever
The only thing that time will see

I've lost my taught denial
And live the days given to me
My life is slowly ending
The fact of fate in time I've now chosen to see

End to an end is our own lifespan
Our only one since time began
Shattering glass and the pattern it holds
No other life can repeat my soul

Dead is the dead of the living mind
Now random waves that escape all lifekind
Truth is the song, the finite dance
End to an end is our own lifespan

See...all that life can be
Let it be...all that you can see
Come and see...all that is not seen
Let it be...all that you have seen

For when your own life dies
In a flash memories in vain erase
And wash away

Beware the afterlife lie
Never hear, never feel the cries and pain of those
Still alive

Who still mourn

[Solo]

What once I thought was evil
Is now a means just to survive
The drive that makes me human
Is the love of life I live another day alive

End to an end is our own lifespan
Our only one since time began
Fear the day when our blood runs cold
The only last truth we all behold

True paradise is the air we breathe
The knowledge we teach, the pleasure we feed
Truth is the song, the finite dance
End to an end is our own lifespan

Born into living life alive
Dying to stay alive in life

See...all that life can be
Let it be...all that you can see
Come and see...all that is not seen
Let it be...all that you have seen
End to an end is our only lifespan
