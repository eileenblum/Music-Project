The sickness spreads from lungs to lungs 
From open mouths of fear and greed 
Under icons of utter betrayal 
They speak the words and plant the seed

Feed the blinded with blood and war 
Slaves 
Feed them all with holy mammon 
Slaves

Come forth plague 
Infest those lungs 
Their skin and flesh 
Their reptile tongues

Their last cry 
In tears of despair 
Eaten by plague 
They scream out in pain

Eat them from within their soul 
Teeth sink into the womb of the virgin 
Come darkness claim the curse of light 
Black death will spread and slay the vermin 
Come forth plague 
Come forth black death

Come forth plague 
Infest those lungs 
Their skin and flesh 
Their reptile tongues

Preachers with words for poison 
Blinded disciples on the weak they prey 
Come forth plague and let them suffer 
Those venomous snakes rot in dismay 
They will rot in dismay
