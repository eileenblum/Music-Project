Your last breath fills your lungs
Forever rest in the chamber of the dead
Where is your god in this final hour ?
As the world collapses in dread

Crippled by sermons humanity bleeds
The scars from where the red flows
Tormented souls, possessed
Their prayers, repressed

Ancient prophecies of apocalypse
The era of the sheep has come to its end
Slowly dying and soon forgotten
The stench of death, foul and rotten

Crippled by sermons humanity bleeds
The scars from where the red flows
Disciples of the righteous, enslaved
Visions of salvation, depraved

Vermin voices preaching
Oceans of opium

The tide is turning, what will remain?
Realms of your god in pain
Crosses burned and icons turned
New regimes shall rise from ashes

Crippled by sermons humanity bleeds
The scars from where the red flows
Blinded by emblems the flock still feeds
The scars of red
