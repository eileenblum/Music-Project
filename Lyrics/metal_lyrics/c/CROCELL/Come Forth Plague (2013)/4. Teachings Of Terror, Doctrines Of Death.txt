Teachings of terror, doctrines of death
Aeons of blood thirst, brought down at length
This eternal tragedy
Is forever retold

Ancient shrines, fallen into oblivion
But new ones are raised in their stead
Greater, more imposing repulsive
We build our own tombs

Ancient immortals vanquished by their sons
Worldly kinsmen without the blaze of old
Gone is the sacrifice, gone is the feast
A faint reflection of divinity

Teachings of terror, doctrines of death
Aeons of blood thirst, brought down at length
This eternal tragedy
Is forever retold

Always invoking a guide, however vile
Always in need of light, however dead

Teachings of terror, doctrines of death
Aeons of blood thirst, brought down at length
This eternal tragedy
Is forever retold

Teachings of terror
Doctrines of death
