In the mirror my bones stand bleached
Reflections of death what else to see
I am no slave nor shacked to Christ
In this world of darkness I am reborn

Still I walk this world of black
To the end of days in denial
Those treacherous vultures
Feast on souls of weak
Perfidious ceremony

Fleshless bodies
In the dirt they crawl
Soulless creatures
Twisting in the soil

Mirror, mirror
What are those scythelike shadows above?
All I hear
The echoing voices in depths of decay
Mass of dread
Pipes of the organ play

Faceless mannequins puppets in strings
Creeping through their lives
There is no messiah just vermin
Cleansed by the morning star
Perfidious ceremony
