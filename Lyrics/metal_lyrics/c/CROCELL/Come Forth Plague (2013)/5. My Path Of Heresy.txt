Born into a world of gospels 
Of the lord almighty 
Fed with tales of our creation 
And the virgin's son of Nazareth

Eardrums pounded and slowly infested 
Reflections repressed 
What I was taught, I deny 
Only in sin I rejoice

I follow my path of heresy 
What you call blasphemy 
Has set me free

The foul taste upon my lips 
Of the creed that smothered my will 
Indoctrination of ignorance 
Violation of innocence 

I follow my path of heresy 
What you call blasphemy 
Has set me free

Once I stared in their glossy black eyes 
Drenched with betrayal 
I know now that they are wolves in disguise 
Beware of false prophets

My mind was once corrupted 
My knowledge repressed 
In my new world I thrive on darkness 
Renewed and unbound
