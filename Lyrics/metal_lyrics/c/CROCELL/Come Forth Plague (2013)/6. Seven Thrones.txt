Black massive mountains stand strong in the horizon
Beneath them lies the wasteland scorched
Silhouettes of burning cities soon reduced to ash
As the devouring flame incinerates humanity

Only death to all can cleanse this world from god
Unchaining them all from religious damnation
Smoke from the funeral pyres, a curtain of clouds
Smother all light before the new creation's dawn

O demons, demons rise from the abyss
Seven angels ascend, spread their wings on the wind
O princes, princes rise and sharpen your spears
Seven princes will claim their thrones

Worms of the old world will never return
Those who speak heavenly tongues shall burn
Fiends from the netherworld with voices of fire
Fiery flames cremate the divine desire

Demons rise from the abyss
Seven angels ascend, spread their wings on the wind
O princes, princes rise and fit your crowns
Seven princes will claim their thrones

Rise from the ashes as a phoenix of fire and flame
Reborn and untamed to inhale the world

Demons rise from the ashes
Princes rise to claim their thrones
