Life-consuming maggots 
In my flesh they live 
Slowly they eat and drink 
What I believe and what I think

Weak from the sacred tongue amongst us 
I enter my grave 
Endless noise of the preachers voice 
Promises of what you crave

Death forever prevail 
The dark I will inhale 
Buried alive, buried alive 
My life I shall exhale

Casket walls around me 
My last breath so near 
The horse-riding shadow appears

Whispering voices 
From the burial ground 
I answer in fear 
And in pain they resound 
From the burial ground

Claustrophobic 
Asphyxiation

Enter my realm of death 
And forever unshackle my chains 
My decomposing body 
My skeletal remains

Weak from the sacred tongue amongst us 
I enter my grave 
Endless noise of your preachers voice 
Promises of what you crave

Death forever prevail 
The dark I will inhale 
Buried alive, buried alive 
My life I shall exhale
