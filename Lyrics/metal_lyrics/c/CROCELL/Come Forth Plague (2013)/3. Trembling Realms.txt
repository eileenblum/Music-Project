I travel through the unceasing night
I walk through halls of the dead
What terror lurks under these black skies?
What horror comes and what wil larise?

I am here in the realms of endless hunger
I face the feast
I face the feast

As solitude shines the path
Where I shall walk
Through deserts of endless greed
Their gold ad silver becomes chains

I see a monster never seen before
Rise
From the shadows it ascends
Rise

Come fly horned demon
Stretch your wings and cloak the light
Come fly almighty demon

Empires fall
Drowned in greed
Empires burn
Trembling realms

I travel through the unceasing night
I walk through halls of the dead
