All this time weâve waited for you to show your faces 
We see you now for what you really are 
Betrayers and scum, you sold us down the river 
The cravenâs work is done and you bask in your pride

Miscreants, you will fool us no more 
Now look what they did to us 
Look what they stole from us 
We live like beasts in a city of ash

When rebellion becomes a duty all you knew is gone 
Through hazes we take in a new dawn 
For years we have strived, now we gather the pieces 
The time has come, the resolve increases

The water is tainted, we drink and we forget 
Like Lazarus we rise, and though we must die a second time 
The will to go on sends us forth once more

When rebellion becomes a duty all you knew is gone 
Through hazes we take in a new dawn 
For years we have strived, now we gather the pieces 
The time has come, the resolve increases

Look what they did to us 
Look what they stole from us 
Never, never, never again

Flesh knows the pain, it doesnât forget 
Like Lazarus we rise, and though we must die a second time 
The will to go on sends us forth in search of the sublime

Miscreants, you will fool us no more 
Never, never, never again
