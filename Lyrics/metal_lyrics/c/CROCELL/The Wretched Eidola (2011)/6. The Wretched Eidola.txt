And all our hope fades away 
We give in to dismay 
And we approach our dying day

The brightness from our hearth is gone 
Weâre at the crossroads, shadows long 
Weâve burned our bridges, and weâve forgotten who we were

All our beauty turned to vanity 
Cowards in depthless disguise 
Theyâve taken me away from my home

Our unity torn to shreds 
Our nation shipwrecked 
We waver in the storm 
Archaic ideals are lost to view 
Known to a hidden few 
Buried in unmarked graves

Weâre headed for disaster 
Weâre headed for undoing

The enemy lurks within 
Similar only in skin 
Vicious beasts our next of kin 
The wretched eidola 
Icons that we portrayed 
Beacons shattered and grey

All our beauty turned to vanity 
Cowards in depthless disguise 
Theyâve taken me away from my home

The wretched eidola
