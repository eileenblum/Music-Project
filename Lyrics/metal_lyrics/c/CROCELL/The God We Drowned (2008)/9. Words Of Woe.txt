Father, hear my call
Take possession of my mind and soul

Don't run, he'll cut you down where you stand
Your future is in his hands
Kneel down, bow before the lord
Our saviour arises forevermore

Hear my call and help me understand what I must do
My soul I give to you to bring back the dead

Let's go!
Now feel him coming, just out of sight
The deceiver arising

Desperate
Desperate to end the cycle of life and death

My soul I give to you to bring back the dead

Don't run, he'll cut you down where you stand
Your future is in his hands
Kneel down, bow before the lord
Our saviour arises forevermore
