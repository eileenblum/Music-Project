The blank stare of dead eyes
The dying march on

Grrrrrr

Ten thousand men charged into the storm
Expendable flesh into the dragon's outh

Poundy by ordnance into the ground
Shattered by shrapnel, can't hear the sound

The blank stare of dead eyes
The dying march on

The sky is lit by cannon fire
The ground is burning high into the sky

Yeaararargh
Vessels of blood and bone
Dead things of steel and stone

Hear the death knell
Hear the death knell
Yargh

No epitaph is written the dead lie alone
Forgotten by millions, no deeds carved in stone

No end to the storm
'Til death they are sworn

The blank stare of dead eyes
The dying march on

Hardryrk
