Purge the weak, their end is at hand
That festering filth, the scum of the land

Come with me: I swear I'll show the way
Teach you a new sacrament
Don't worry 'bout the price you pay
You lost souls, the fallen
The bloodshed has just begun

Stay with me until the end
Kill with me, my loyal friends
Swear with me the final rites
Bring me your sacrifice

Now you see clear, you know the ending
Infinity lies there before you go and claim it
Beyond murder, beyond treason
The serpent is coiling

Udryrghargh

Death walks a thousand ways
And lies come in a thousand shapes
You were picked out in the culling
Now you realize that you have

Fallen... your fragile limbs atrophy
Fallen... there's no more for you to see

My livestock, I keep you close to feast when I so choose
Gorged with human flesh, the culling is when you lose
You lost souls, the fallen
The bloodshed has just begun
