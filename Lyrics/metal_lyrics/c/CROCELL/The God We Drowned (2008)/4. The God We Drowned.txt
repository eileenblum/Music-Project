We tore him from his throne and bound him in chains
Dragged him through the wastes and scarred his face
The tyrant and despoiler mocked and caged
Held down and bound in a prison of mirrors

I saw his face, contorted
By the flagellation
I saw the faithful mourning
Sordid consegration

But no death was granted him as he languished away
With taunting forms around him, he waited and declined
Bided his time awaiting his escape

I saw his face, contorted
By the flagellation
I saw the faithful mourning
Sordid consegration

And slowly driven mad by the remembrance of what he was

Looking upon his wrecked visage in the mirrors
He clawed out his eyes, refusing to see
To feel the anguish of his mutilated form

The god we drowned lives on
He waits beneath the sea
The god we drowned lives on
Soon he will be free

A final act of vengeance, of torment taken shape
Reflections of the pain that was his fate
Disciples of hatred killed whom they found
To mimic the ruin of the god we drowned

I saw his face, contorted
By the flagellation
I saw the faithful mourning
Sordid consegration

The god we drowned lives on
The tide is rising
The god we drowned lives on
Now come the whirlwinds
The god we drowned lives on
The maelstrom grows bigger
The god we drowned lives on
The god we drowned
