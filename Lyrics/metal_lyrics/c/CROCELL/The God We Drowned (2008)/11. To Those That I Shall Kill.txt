As I walk through the blood-filled pits
Thehowling victims suffocate decompose and die
Annihilated, laid to waste
The screaming from down below subsides

Through the empty immensity of gods
They speak through me, you know their voice

To those that I shall kill
Beneath the grinding wheels
To all those that I shall kill
Death shall come to he who kneels

Born to continue a successive reign
To bring about the future of the slain
Beasts of burden are what you are
A pest upon the land, a witless scar

Possessed by thoughts that must be a god's
The brilliance and insight is not of this worl
And so you do not understand what must be done
His will be done

To those that I shall kill
Beneath the grinding wheels
To all those that I shall kill
Death shall come to he who kneels

Now you know what is to come
But you will never comprehend
The infinite dimensions that I have seen
Eternal darkness where I have been
You will never truly know
