All light has gone away
Hail ! Hail the chosen!
Faithful servants of god
All hail the chosen!
A covenant of blood

The earth cloaked in darkness, the sun is gone
The lord demands more lives
Bring them forward, brave servants
Soon to know of his eternal thirst

Drink deep and claim your prize
Bestow us light: we avert our eyes

Head are severed, raised on stakes
Bodies form a burial mound
To serve in death instead of life
To please the lord of light

Sacred martyrs, sanctified
Hear the roaring of the crowd

Hail ! Hail the chosen!
Faithful servants of god
All hail the chosen!
A covenant of blood

Raurrr

Offerings ti the god up high and the mob down below
Hearts are torn out, head are falling down

Pierce their flesh with blessed knives
Flay them from head to toe
The sun will come, rise anew
Bring with it the rain of life

Tear out their palpitating hearts

The light must return
Hail ! Hail the chosen!
Faithful servants of god
All hail the chosen!
A covenant of blood
