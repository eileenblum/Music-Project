When the darkness fades
When the path before you lies open wide
Don't think I don't remember
The strength that lies in your presence
Don't never care for your signs
But remember that winter is coming
Winter is coming
When the hour comes
They surround you sinister
Don't think that I don't know you
The strength that I once followed
Don't ever think you'll escape me
Just remember that winter is coming
They fly on your despair
When there's nothing left
Nothing left to live for
You turned into an empty withered shell
When the darkness intensifies
