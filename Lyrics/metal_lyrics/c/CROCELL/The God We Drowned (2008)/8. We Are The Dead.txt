Urgh

Damned beyond all space and time
Wretched deform
Shadows cast by dying men
Beyond the realms of light
Their black hearts know only hate
Scorn disgust
With cold hands they come for you
To bring you into these

Demonic dreams, abnormal screams
Phantasmal pain that haunts you so
They know you they hate you
They choke you, sink claws into flesh

I heard them calling out my name
And I now see through dead eyes
Now all I seek is to feed
To feel the warmth of skin
I saw them rise in visions of the darkness that will come

Rargh

Now you die, your life is lost
So we take your soul with us
Dripping, seeing, through the soil
To our realm below the earth

Raheeeeeeeer

Tell me of the dreams of the dead
Tell me of the dreams of the dead
Tell me of vengeance, nightmares horrendous
Tell me of the dreams of the dead

Demonic dreams, abnormal screams
Phantasmal pain that haunts you so
We know you, we hate you
We choke you, sink claws into flesh

Now you die, your life is lost
So we take your soul with us
Dripping, seeing, through the soil
To our realm below the earth

Yargh
