Urgh

What lies behind the veil? You know nothing
And nothingness will engulf you
What secrets hide from you? And dare you know?
What will happen if you find what you're looking for?

If those lost comes creeping back
Lifeless
When the dead comes creeping bak
You will know regret

Raaheeer
The dead march against you
Cannibal fiends come to swallow your skin
The dead fall upon you

Is it what you long for? Is it what you fear?
Is there a reason why that knowledge is lost?
Resurrecting lost memories
The painful truth of what you really are

Behind the veil

In the arts of death and life
Necromancy, you dabble foolishy

Raaheeer
The dead march against you
Cannibal fiends come to swallow your skin
The dead fall upon you

Raaaaaargh
