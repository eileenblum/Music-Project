Bring  me oil and flames set my icon alight
And I will rise beyond the constraints of the mortal world

Glorified in dread
A burning godhead
This flesh is but a shell
The earth a living hell

All the living will bow their heads, kneel in reverence
Witness my apotheosis
Away from the worms and filth my soul remains
My carcass left to rot in your dying world

Deified forever upon death
The eagle takes my soul to the gods
Defiers and liars struck down
Their flesh ripped from their bones

They will fear me
When I ascend on pillars of flame

Dominion eternal waits beyond the end
To rule among the gods as I did among men

Glorified in dread
A burning godhead
This flesh is but a shell
The earth a living hell

Deified forever upon death
The eagle takes my soul to the gods
Defiers and liars struck down
Their flesh ripped from their bones

Ydrk
