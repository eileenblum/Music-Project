Raaaaahydr

In the city of the damned all time stands still
The distant bleak horizon bodes ill
The wind is roaring ominously
The peoples pray sacrilegiously

Tron from the power of the sovereign
The nooses tighten around their necks
And everything fades away with time
All is grey

The storm approaches, the rain begins to fall
They know that it's the doom of them all

The war is coming
Beliefs are falling

I feel my urge to join the slaughter
Be one with the euphoria

Torn from the power of the sovereign
The nooses tighten around their necks
And everything fades away with time
All is grey

In the city of the damned all time stands still
The distant bleak horizon bodes ill
