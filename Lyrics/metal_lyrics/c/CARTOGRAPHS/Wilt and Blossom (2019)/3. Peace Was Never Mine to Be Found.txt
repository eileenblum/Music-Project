When we carry we go
It's the same reflection
That I view from the water down below
You we're stronger, I should know
A burden for warm hands to hold

Once it was clear
The sky fills with drab light, our mothers' echoes draw near.

As we disappear
Again

In a dream, we could stay
In a dream, we would never return just to leave

Soaring and fleeing
Like we were told
The ways are repeated
Like days of old

Cut from the same being
You held on
Cut from the same being
Let famine come

You flee the sun
A cycle undone

Nothing is ending
As we flew
Nothing is ending
But the fear in you

And amidst the sound
Of wings
Sweeping past the ground
Peace was never mine to be found
You were stronger
Stronger
I should know
