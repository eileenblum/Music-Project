Waves that eat, soil and stones
Winds that reap, empty homes
Save a piece, of a cliff overlooking
The deepest sea, like a blade

On the precipice, it still stands
Rotting and worn to bits, coloured by hands
Of families, that once thrived among
Plots of irises, so many years have gone

Fairest town, but it grew
Until vanity was all it knew
Made the ocean a foe
A sentence of permanent woe

Incited the storms
A tempest of strife
Only brought at ease
By a yield of life

False aim
Tread into the dive
Bound by the shame
Ignorance be their last goodbye

The leap from which families break
Less echoes surrounding them
For a while
They find solace, with the waves
Through the red garden gate

In the wake of
Abandonment, a boy walked the streets
Ever reticent, eyes cloudy and white
Every day he spend, hearing of terrors that
Would impend, never the same

With the greyest gone, to rest in the depths
Without sight or tongue, no savior to be
Called upon, away by the people
He was torn, as sacrifice

Dragged by the hands,
Through the remnants of the lands
That had flourished before
Conceit had brought them war

Brought before the precipice
An offer with no voice to miss

Into the world lost
Out from this world clean
Into the world lost
Out from this world clean
Into the world lost
Out from this world clean
Into the world lost
Out from this world clean

She rose from where waters they meet the sky
Winds turned to knives and tides ran high
Form of haze, hair like waves
Herald of their kindreds' graves
Placed in his hands, two shells from the shore
"With these you shall cover in darkness no more"
"Take them as eyes, go where they don't know"
"A child like you have nothing to owe"

Gifted
From what only ever takes
But he didn't want to view
A world build upon mistakes

Pointed a finger to his mouth
So he was given a voice
Plead for the people to change their ways
Innocence had made its choice

Selfless resolve
Selfless resolve

Words so softly spoken
For ears that wouldn't hear
Soon the waves retreated
And the skies went clear
And the skies went clear
And the skies went clear
