If you could envision
The striking eyes of people
Reflecting pure ambition
In their face
I saw her

A smile hid cautiously
She could see through walls,
She would see through me

It was the same love
Graces fed the air
It was the same love
Carved a place for you here
All that was left to spare
It was the same
It was the same

I told you I'd fear no death

So convinced that we were destined and that no chance, could have brought us here.

Disregarding the written words I read.
Blind by praise, I saw no accept.
Accept.

You hoped not to find,
More string than pearls

It was the same love
Graces fed the air
It was the same love
Carved a place for you here
All that was left to spare
It was the same
It was the same

Called my name to have me felled

Tried so carefully to spare me, as you felt the ache, of a fools last dance.

It was the same love
Graces fed the air
It was the same love
Carved a place for you
Laid bare all of my achievements for no world to see.
It was the same
It was the same to me
