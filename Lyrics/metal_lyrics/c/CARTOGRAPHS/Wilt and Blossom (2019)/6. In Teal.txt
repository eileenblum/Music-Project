She whispered
"Climb up the hill"
"I lay too ill"
Answered her call
It was autumn
The start of fall

Reluctant steps she tread
Through mountainside
For water she'd been sent
From the greater height

Instilled by a vow that lead
Far off from the riverbed
By will of her guardian
A task so quotidian

Slaved her way up against the incline
Guided by hymns of surrounding pine
Rust-coloured leaves dancing by her side
She found the well in a view so bright

In teal

Held there in awe
And so she saw
Some mountains were never meant to be moved at all
It was autumn
The start of fall
The start of her fall
