If I praise the struggle of every day
That I spent wishing November to turn into May
With every second I contemplate
If the rush is making up for my mind's decay

This one is for all the souls I carried along with me
Relive the past
To feel what certainly will come to be
Old hearts beat half speed
Oh how it made me

Repeat what has been done
And hope that I will learn

A sea of risks to take, and make, regret a parable
Foundations chipped away, replaced, with gold of glory days

My time is moving way too fast
Try to run and make the feeling last
The twelve hours that I lost back then
Are haunting me again

They haunt me again
They haunt me again

This is forever
As far as I can see
Nostalgia is not
Not what it used to be

Is it too late?
Never too late
Never

Though distinctions are far and few
This essence keep pulling through
Pick up your bones, rebuild anew
Since nineteen ninety two
