Restless covers
Gathered in row
Pages are yellowed
Words hanging low

Purpose of staying
We said that we'd know
As ashes embrace us
And we fail, at all
To grow

Yearn for affection
Undeserving trust
Showers of teeth
Gilded with rust

Dim gazes
Passionless love
Pick me up
Pick me up

Sweet unforgiveness
Lather my tongue
Colour the rivers
Doubt will be gone

Cures that killed off
So many memories
Many more
Than I bargained for

Let's forget why we left

Don't glance at the door
You won't find what you're looking for
Don't glance at the door
You won't find what you're looking for
You won't find what you're looking for
You won't find what you're looking for
Looking for

So pick me up
Pick me up

Sweet unforgiveness
Lather my tongue
Peel apart everything
Peel apart everything

These cures that killed off
Too many memories
Many more
Than I bargained for
Bargained for
Bargained for
Bargained for
Bargained for
Bargained for

Don't pick me up
Not to be found
Don't pick me up
Not to be found
Now I'm the outlasting victor
Thinnest blood
And for once, I return
With a goal
With a goal
