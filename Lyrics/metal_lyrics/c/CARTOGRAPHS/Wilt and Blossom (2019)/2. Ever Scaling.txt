I've covered so much ground
Eyes wide and red
I've covered so much ground
Too much to focus on these precious little things

And I curse the building tops
For not giving me view enough

Clawing paths for the sky
Without final ground

And this view is not enough
I curse the building tops

For long, this has been my release
To soar, in search of a higher reach

Climbing higher, details will
Soon expire, but I can't help but hunger for more.

So I curse the building tops

They're not keeping me atop
Not giving me view enough

With the broadest stare
Seeking peace by fear
You'll know
You'll know
I'll be remaining here
Remaining here
