Through the damned souls
Black magic is revealed
Shrieks of terror
Pulsate into your brain

A warlock dwells
Beneath a rotten chamber
His damaged mind
Breeds the undead insane

Beyond the void
Of hovering ghosts
From bones to dust
Your life is lost

Storms of grave
Dirt burn your eyes
Your blood runs cold
And turns to frost

Bloodsucking sorcery
Bloodsucking sorcery

Inhale souls
For his bride to be
Rejuvenate her corpse
From beyond

The ritual casts out the pure
Her ghastly visage she is fond

Bloodsucking sorcery
Bloodsucking sorcery
