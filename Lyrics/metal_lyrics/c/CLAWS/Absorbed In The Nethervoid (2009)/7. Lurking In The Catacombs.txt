They summon you from below
Beneath the crypts they dwell
An unhallowed path before you
To your fate that will be hell

Hear the sounds of creeping
In this living nightmare
Shadows crawl and grow
As the horrid ones prepare

Madness stalks your inner psych
Your pulse races with fear

Supernatural dreams invade
The catacomb lurkers appear

Skulls crack and crumble
Tombs are smashed and burned
The horrid ones have risen,
Their horrors have returned

Hear the sounds of creeping
In this living nightmare
Shadows crawl and grow
As the horrid ones prepare

They summon you from below
Beneath the crypts they dwell
An unhallowed path before you
To your fate that will be hell

Madness stalks your inner psych
Your pulse races with fear
