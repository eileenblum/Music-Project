Echoes of spirits long dead
Whirl winds of fog cloud the sky
A private ceremony in hell
The day you know you will die

Curse of the wretched chaos
Within you fear is spread
This morbid asylum awaits
Offerings of the vermin undead

Shrouded in mystery and the macabre
Worshippers of the eerie chill
Banished from brooding domains
Cloak of the sacrificial

Possession portals form
Capturing your essence

Cloak of the sacrificial

Tombs rotting in the remains
The scent of doom forever free

Cloak of the sacrificial
Cloak of the sacrificial
