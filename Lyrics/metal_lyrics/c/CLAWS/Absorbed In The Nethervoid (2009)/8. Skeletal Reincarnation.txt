Desolate cemetery under black skies
An ancient grave where evil lies
A slumbering corpse lays rotten in the hole
Diabolical resurrection awaits a tormented soul

Morbid incantations scrawled on a tomb
Festering crypts hold the dead like a womb

Crawling maggots devour putrid remains
A pit of decay where all life drains

Lightening strikes a fetid tombstone
Flesh starts to form on dry withered bone

Skeletal cadaver awakens from hell
Reincarnated from a dreadful spell

Compelled to rise by a dark twisted curse
A hideous creature, none could be worse

Doomed to roam the miserable earth
Skeletal reincarnation, a hellish rebirth
Morbid incantations scrawled on a tomb
Festering crypts hold the dead like a womb
