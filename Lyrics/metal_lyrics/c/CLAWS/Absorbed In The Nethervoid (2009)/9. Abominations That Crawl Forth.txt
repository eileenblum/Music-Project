Into the swirling mass
Of discombobulated flesh
Out comes beings unknown
And their terrors untold

Consuming foul specimens
From unearthly ground
Dissecting the diseases
Transmutations of the skin

Out of oceans of blood
Fiendish floods from the north
Abominations that crawl forth

Claws of death cutting you deep
From the nethervoid they creep

Into the swirling mass
Of discombobulated flesh

Out of oceans of blood
Fiendish floods from the north
Abominations that crawl forth
