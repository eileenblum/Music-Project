There's things in this world
You were never meant to know
A place of supernatural doom
Where ungodly creatures lurk below

[Chorus:]
Eerily winged abominations
Shred and pick at your skin
Shrill sounds with demon skull
Fear the cacophonous carrion!

Swarming undead vultures
Feasting on your guts

Unearthly maniacal laughter
Left rotting with the maggots

Unearthly maniacal laughter
Left rotting with the maggots

The unholy words brought them to life
Fucking with evil was your biggest mistake
Run from the caves of these demonic beasts
Before they hear your presence and awake!

[Chorus:]
Eerily winged abominations
Shred and pick at your skin
Shrill sounds with demon skull
Fear the cacophonous carrion!
