Into the tombs of hell
I see visions bleak
Locked inside forever
Until I'm rotting meat

When you enter the vaultshriek
You're helpless and lost!
When you die int he vaultshriek
Your soul it will cost!

My mortality is fading
And things are about to get worse

Hideous minions attack
Your bones are piled high
The vault door slams shut
And your flesh is left to fry!

When you enter the vaultshriek
You're helpless and lost!
When you die in the vaultshriek
Your soul it will cost!

My mortality is fading
And things are about to get worse
