A river enshrouded in fog
Fetid decks with human remains
This death barge you travel
Feel the terror in your veins

The horror-mood begins
Immense horrid wretchedness
A river of blood you float
Feel its dreary caress

The funeral barge
Feel death all around you
From the stench of the dead
All alone with an undead crew

The funeral barge
Feel death all around you
From the stench of the dead
All alone with an undead crew

To the carnivorous castle
A breathing beast of fright
The dead rise as zombies
They have you in their sight...
