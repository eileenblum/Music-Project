Into the Light of Lucifer I gaze.
The Morning star which shines amongst black sky,
leads me towards astral gates...
gates to the paths of the Draconis.

Black wings carry me to flight, through elemental planes of time.
Storming through Dark skies, I see through the all seeing eye.
I transcend the prison of flesh, rising to my astral senses.
I embrace the cold serpentine stare, the Eye of the Draconis.
Ghastly visions of the netherplanes materialize before me
within the cold abysmal dominion.
I awaken thine inmost self.
I see through the eyes of the Dragon,
from the cold planes of solitude,
amongst the shadow lands.

I evoke thee Sabnack, through Martian ceremonial summonings.
Ignited are the 5 flames of Geburah.
I invoke thee Asmodeus, arch-demon of the 5th infernal habitation.
Come unto thy scarlet chamber, channel your infernal majesty, unto thee!
By sword and fire, I call unto thee to manifest,
descend from the sphere of destruction, the red sphere of Mars.
From the dark horse of battle, cloaked within the essence of Darkness,
I chant the incantations of the 5th infernal demon,
and unleash the curse of the evil eye.
Asmodeus, manifest before thee, for I gaze from the serpent eye.
The voice once faceless reveals it's essence unto me.
The face of Asmodeus I behold before me.
The face seen only through the Eyes of the Draconis
