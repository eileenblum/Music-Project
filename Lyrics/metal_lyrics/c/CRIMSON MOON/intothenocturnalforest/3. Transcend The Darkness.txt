Transcend the Darkness Dust to Dust, 1000 Moons old, rebirthed in opposites.
Confined to this World of Shadows, a journey amongst the dead.
Free from the harm of time, feast on the crimson wine.

Uncontrollable feeding, I must go on.
Dormant by Day, arising at dark

Fly with me, into the moonlight, entranced by it's opaque twilight
It's calling to me, with radiant control.
I levitate for the Moon my soul.
