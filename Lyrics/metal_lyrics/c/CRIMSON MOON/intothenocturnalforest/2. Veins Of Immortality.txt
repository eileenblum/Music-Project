Feasting on the Blood, Penetrate the flesh
Jugular open wide, spurring immortal life
Surging with the power, your blood makes me strong
Drinking from the Veins of Immortality

You will bleed for me, as I start to feed
Gushing from your soul, the blood that I let go
Join us in ritual to drink from these veins, for it is everlasting life.
We must feed amongst the living, and walk amongst the dead
