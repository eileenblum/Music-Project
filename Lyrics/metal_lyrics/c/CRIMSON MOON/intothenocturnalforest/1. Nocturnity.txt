As the darkness calls out I awaken to the pack
Wandering the world of shadows I indulge in what he (God) forbid
Drinking the Blood of Mortals as a Full Moon reigns the night
Raise thy Chalice feed with lust, immortality is achieved

Power surges in me, guiding me with hate
I am the night that lasts forever
The cold winds of Nocturnity that haunt the feeble and weak

My senses are enhanced are enhanced as I thrive in the moonlight
The Sun shall rise no more, forever the immortals walk
Inherit the Earth to destroy, no mortal shall be spared
As their God is impaled on the inverted cross

Drink the Blood of Christ, not his impotent wine
His Angels are Forsaken, as we desecrate his bread(flesh)
The Horns of the Goat are nailed in his Skull

I am the ominous, the plague of the Christian fate
I am Darkness, forever Nocturnity.
