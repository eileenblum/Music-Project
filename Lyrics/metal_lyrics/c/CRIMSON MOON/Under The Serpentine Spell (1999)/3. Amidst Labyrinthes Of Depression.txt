As I journey to my darkest depths of my mind
and my soul to escape my Earthly woe, I descend to my depths.
To live on is to bask in pain. Misery is thy mortality.
I find myself amidst Labyrinthes of Depression.

I wander the endless hallways, bewildered by my thought.
In the darkness of the labyrinthe, I am one with my inner self.
With memories of pain and misanthropy, I long for these walls to be my grave.
I embrace my shadowside in the darkness of this realm... with a razor to my wrist.

But there is a light, Mighty Lucifer, The light that is within Darkness.

Guided by thee I embrace my eternity of pain to live through my life in depression,
I find the deepest of thy self. I wander the halls of this labyrinthe
of pain searching no longer for light. The only way out is to die!

I walk the Shadowed Path Clouded by storms of Anguish,
the Earth is my damnation and rains upon thy fields of sorrow.
But birthed in the root of Darkness, thy wisdom shall sprout
the tree of true knowledge.
