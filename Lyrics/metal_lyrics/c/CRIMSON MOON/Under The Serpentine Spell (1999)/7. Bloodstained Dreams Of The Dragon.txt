Upon the wings of the Dragon
I travel the serpentine path
Into the Nocturnal Forest
I enter the shadows of my dreams
Over my shoulder watching
A bloodstained freezing stare
Eyes of crimson watchful
Eyes forever in my Dreams.

Into the Night, my astral demon ascends
Through her visions,
in bloodstained dreams
I watch the Lunar Glow
Eclipse to a crimson sphere

Somniumeus Nos Draconis
Somniumeus Nos Sanguinolentus Draco - Inluminare!
(dreams of the dragon spawn -
dreams of the bloodstained Dragon -
enlightened me!)

I rise unto the dreams of the Bloodstained Dragon

Awakened to a fathomless state,
deep within my mind yet high as Mountains reach.
Upon a universe of a dimension endlessly;
A shadowed kingdom that casts on the light of the day;
A kingdom from which I heir in the Nocturne embrace;
A kingdom that the Dragon roams.

In bloodstained Dreams of the Dragon
Red as the blood in Lucifer's veins
I enter the gate of the Master
For the path I have trodden many fold
Webbed throughout the cosmos
like cobwebs of cemetery.
like shadows in the nocturnal forest
I find my soul wandering
Behind me she is watching
Her red eyes pierce the dark
In my bloodstained dreams
Where shadows spawn.
