Entranced by the Magick that constricts thy soul.
Empowered by the Force of Draconis.
Under the dark sky whence Ursa Major drowns,
into the depths of the horizon.

I call forth the Serpent
Under her Mighty Spell!

SARRATUM TIAMAT, Hail to thee!

For it is written, She will arise,
From Seas of Fire, Dreaming of vengeance,
Leviathan arise!

Entranced under the Serpentine spell
I am guided by her flame
Entranced by the serpentine stare
I see visions arcane.

Descending from red skies
Ugalla demons, minions of KINGU
Exalt the Sign of Chaos

"And TIAMAT (Leviathan) ascends from the depths below the seas,
for blood she rises. As it is written, 7 Angels with 7 seals flew across
the sky, and the first who broketh the first seal upon those who wear
the mark of TIAMAT, failed in impotence. For th e angel's magick
of God, could not break the Serpentine Spell."

Flames the Dragon spit forth, smoldering feathers of angels wings.
7 Angels of revelations falling, charred from Dragon fire
...and drowning in her seas
The elders are not watchful! Attack!!

Those of the awakened rise up, onwards to Armageddon.
Claim the Throne of our fate and lead the venom legions... to a bloody victory

Entranced by the Magick that constricts thy soul.
Empowered by the Force of Draconis.
Under the dark sky whence Ursa Major drowns,
into the depths of the horizon.

I call forth the Serpent
Under her Mighty Spell!

Into a stormlit night, facing the West altar,
I chant the conjuration of the path of the Everlasting,
the shadowed path of the Vampyre,
Under the Serpentine Spell.
