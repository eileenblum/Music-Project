The cry has arisen across the land
We're choked by the grip of the iron hand
The sting of the whip the toll of the bell
We ravage the world with one foot in hell

Up from the darkness the cauldrons of hate
The vengeance of old the sealing of fate
The screams of the damned the souls that fell
With one foot in heaven the other in hell

The savior we worship won't lead us astray
The unholy masses have seen the last day
The howl of the jackal the beast's evil stare
With one foot in hell do you think that we care?
