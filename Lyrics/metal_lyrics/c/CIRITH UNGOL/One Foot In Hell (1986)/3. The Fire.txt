Forging the fire last chance to fight
Demons of evil at one with the night
Kingdoms of greed from the blood of man
Vampires all, bring them down if we can

[Chorus:]

Forging the fire not alone in the fight we're at one with the night

Stealing from beggars their stock in trade
Nowhere to run the judgement's been made
Fleeing from vengeance like dogs on the run
Search and destroy bring them down one by one

[Chorus]

Driving the demons the iron hand
Standing together the throne of man
Forging the fire not alone in the fight
Hard stand the victors at one with the night
