Call it heavy metal comes on hard and fast
We're the men who play it we're here to kick your ass

[Chorus:]

Coming like a hurricane a hundred miles an hour
We don't stop for nothing cause we've got the power

Our nerves are made of steel and there's ice in our veins
We're frost and we're fire we're pleasure and we're pain

[Chorus]

Call it heavy metal comes on hard and fast
We're the men who play it we're here to kick your ass
