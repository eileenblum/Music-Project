Don t need a crystal ball to show me where I m going,
cause I m making it right, making it right, right this time.
Ever since you left me all I want is you, 
But I m making it fine, making it fine, draw the line. 

I was born with a six string in my hand, 
1'll follow the dream to the end. 
And I'll go it alone.

Seems without me you re just searching you keep hoping.
You are standing in line, standing in line, burning time. 
never believed that Id be back on the streets,
So I'll follow the dream, follow the dream, yeah tonight.

I was born with a six string in my hand, 
I'll follow the dream to the end.
And I'll go it alone. 

Don t need a crystal ball to show me where I'm going, 
cause I'm making it right, making it right, right this time. 
With or without you, I've got to live this dream, 
Cause its once in a life, once in a life, my lifetime. 

I was born with a six string in my hand, 
I'll follow the dream to the end. 
And I'll go it alone.
