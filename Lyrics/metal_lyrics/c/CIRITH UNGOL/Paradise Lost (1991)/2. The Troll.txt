Hides under a bridge, 
Where he can t be seen.
Huddled under a bankside,
Staring into a stream.
Wanna cross this bridge,
Well better be aware. 
There is a brown hairy troll,
Gonna give you a scare. 

Yea, I'm the troll,
This is my bridge, 
Go turn around, 
Back through the ridge.
Yea, I 'm the troll, 
Don t you even dare, 
Yea, I'm the troll, 
Gonna get you there, 

Monster from beneath. 
Bastard of grief,
Such a sad sigh,
Does he wanna die?
In a mind of fear,
The troll lives in my mind.
I must forget this fear of regret. 

The Troll 
The Troll
The Troll

The Troll will charge a toll,
That is, your life,
So this is it,
You better think Twice, 
Don't cross the bridge,
Where he lives.
But, its too late 
Cause here he is,
