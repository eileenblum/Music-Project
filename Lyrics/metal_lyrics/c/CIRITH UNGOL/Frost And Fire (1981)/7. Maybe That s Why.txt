I don't know how you really feel,
I just know you 've been hurt.
Wish I could say what I really feel,
But I know you need more than words.
To say everything I wanted to say,
I 'd have to have a book.
But you can say so much more
With just a single look

[Chorus:]
Maybe That's Why, Maybe That's Why
I love you...

Close my eyes and I see your face,
My heart starts beating your name.
Look in your eyes and I melt away,
I know I 'll never be the same.

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Now here's the moral of the story,
I know it's easier said than done.
Believe in your dreams, believe in yourself,
No matter, nomatter what comes.
You 've got the power, you 've got the strength,
I know you 're gonna pull through
And just in case it matters,
remember that I believe in you.

[Chorus]
