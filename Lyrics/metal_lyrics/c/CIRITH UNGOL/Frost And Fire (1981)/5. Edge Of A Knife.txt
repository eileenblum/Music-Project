It feels like I'm frustrated
When I should be satisfied
But as long as I'm frustrated
I know I'm still alive
I've got 20/20 hindsight
But I won't live in the past
I like to look up at the sky
When I'm flat on my ass

Edge of a knife, edge of a knife
Maybe that's what they mean by real life
Edge of a knife, edge of a knife
Maybe that's what they mean by real life

I've got my rock 'n roll haircut
I've got my rock 'n roll jeans
Just to make me feel like
Someone I'd rather not be
I don't care if you laugh at me
It's better than beeing ignored
Anyway, I'm used to it
That's what fools are for

Edge of a knife, edge of a knife
Maybe that's what they mean by real life
Edge of a knife, edge of a knife
Maybe that's what they mean by real life
Edge of a knife, edge of a knife
Maybe that's what they mean by real life
Edge of a knife, edge of a knife
Maybe that's what they mean by real life

Maybe I gotta get hurt
Maybe that's what I need
'Cause I got music in my bloodstream
Sometimes I just can't seem to bleed
I don't care if you laugh at me
It't better than beeing ignored
Anyway, I'm used to it
That's what fools are for

Edge of a knife, edge of a knife
Maybe that's what they mean by real life
Edge of a knife, edge of a knife
Maybe that's what they mean by real life
Edge of a knife, edge of a knife
Maybe that's what they mean by real life
Edge of a knife, edge of a knife
Maybe that's what they mean by real life

Edge of a knife, edge of a knife
Maybe that's what they mean by real life
Edge of a knife, edge of a knife
Maybe that's what they mean by real life
