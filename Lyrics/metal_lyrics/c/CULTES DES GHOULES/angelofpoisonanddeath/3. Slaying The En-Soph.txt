Through the seven guardians of divine luminescence. Below the triad of Kether. Chokmakh. Binah. The mouth of astral Lilith - calling. To the entrance.. of dungeons.. of darkness.. of Daath. The new beginning. The uncreation. Across the shells into god-hood. The number of 11 is the path of the dark divinity. In the black chaos of Destruction. Creation, devotion.. transformation. We create to destroy! While they unify with god. We slay the en-soph, and dive beyond this universe.. To transform into malignant Eden serpent. The lost spark from eyes of Adam Kadnion. Falling from christian god's grace. Creating new entities - possessed. The temptation of christ.
