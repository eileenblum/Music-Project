From the fictitious greed of Judas. Streams venom of purification's Serpent. Poisoned nucleus of salvation. The hangman's semen is the Devil's laugh. Show me this flesh. The unbeliever's order. Hidden nazarenous grave. Shame us. Salvation. Nameless mystery of Death. The (cause of) martyr Death. Isn't it Lucifer's glance watching crucifixion through Iscariot? Aren't these nails vengeance? And this spear - destiny? Nature of man is to flagellate messiah. Nature of humanity is to obey Satan's will. Let blood from his side stream into the skull of Adam. Let corpse rot in the grave. And won't hide behind the pearly gates. Cause our will became extermination. Of broken trinity of god with sound of burning angel's wings.
