The moon shines in its prime
It's the night of infernal wonder
I shall go to the forbidden shrine
Evected in the haunted wood out yonder

Leper monks savour menstrual blood
Succubus seduce a young, healthy lad
Naked bodies sway in the lustful stream
Cold, evil eyes in the dark fiercely gleam

Bleached bones in shallow graves
cry out for blood

My baby's heart feels the evil though cannot see
The dark, horned silhouette beckons to me
In the fumes of herbs phantoms appear at will
The wood enchanted is eerily silent and still
My baby's heartbeat suddenly quickens
With joy and terror the midnight air thickens

Lambs bared their fangs
Shrieks turned to sweetes sigh
A drugged virgin on the altar bangs
The clatter of hooves is nigh

Leper monks savour menstrual blood
Succubus seduce a young, healthy lad
Naked bodies sway in the lustful stream
Cold, evil eyes in the dark fiercely gleam
