The church dungeons is full of weeping
Of the unfortunates in unquiet sleeping
I dream warmly of that April night
When I've sworn to the Righteous Might
Chained to dirt and delivered to torment
Fearless and scornful I await my final moment

Though they broke my bones
And crushed my hands with stones
Mocked my painful moans
Yet my spirit rebelliously roams

How dare they disturb our Art?
Born with Eve's wilful deed
But I embrace my end with unshaken heart
I shall never perish, the Devil's seed

There's a stronger fibe burning within
Making harmless the one eating my skin
It's the five of my baneful will
That shall bring my foes low and ill
In my love for Him I've never been in misery
Of death I made my victory
