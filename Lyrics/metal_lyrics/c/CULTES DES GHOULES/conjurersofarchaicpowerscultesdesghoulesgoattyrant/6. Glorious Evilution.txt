[performed by Cultes des Ghoules]Did you sweep us far from your grace, holy lord?
Yes, we dared to explore hell
We shaped into a stone this dark belief
We suffered your sordid laws
For too many years now

May the day we left you sanguinary sect of worship
Will be the damnedest day
We don't despair
Just take this disease from us
That smothers the passion

Go tell your tales of deceit
The folk loves them so much
We found our truth in horror
We torment our flesh in search of enlightenment
Gnosis of negativity, creative evil
Ugliness is what inspires fiery minds

May the day we left you sanguinary sect of worship
Will be the damnedest day
We don't despair
Just take this disease from us
That strangles the spirit

Your son died for us
We heard so
A faithful dog
I wish we saw the show

The little child cried only once
Dark oath of blood
The deal is done
There's no return

Unflinching, no sign of regret
Contemplating the blissful self-affliction
The Dark Lord has come
To flagellate our souls
