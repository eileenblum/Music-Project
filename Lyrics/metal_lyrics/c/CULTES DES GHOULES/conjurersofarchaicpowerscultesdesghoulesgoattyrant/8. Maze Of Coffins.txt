[performed by Cultes des Ghoules]Intoxicated with evil and hatred
I penetrate the cold crypts
In search for ties with the Sinister One
My eyes burn with necrolust

Shining apparitions with no eyes
Lords of these old graves
Grace me with their putrid breath

Intoxicated with visions of death
I penetrate the maze of coffins
Putrid gems that hold
The most terrifying mysteries

Obsessed by the lust for obscurity
I penetrate the depths of open graves
To be at one with the Dark
And rape what's most precious in humanity

Black sacrificial tomb
I crawl towards it
In necrotic trance
The black hole of the open grave
Inspires the demon within
I breathe in the toxic death

Shining apparitions with no eyes
Drifting by my side
Their presence inflame the night
