[performed by Cultes des Ghoules]An endless struggle
Of men's dual nature
I am the one
Who rejoices in the dark

I admire...
...this beauty...
The view of an open grave

I crawl into the black hole
Where death radiates
Smells like the world

This beautiful wound of the earth
Is the triumph of God's curse

I admire...
...in silence...
I seek comfort in decay
