The night of oblivion...
The swamp of redemption...
Abyss absorbs everything

Be cursed, oh the day
When they burnt me this mark
Memories have been erased
Now, flesh and spirit will cleanse themselves

Voices...
How many times yet,
They lead me into temptation
Everything comes from Him,
Everything's got two meanings
Murder...

Carnal lust of wealth
Has driven me into alchemy
Now, I desire to touch
This golden goat
Cause the sign of divinity
I don't feel
My blood is getting old
But the spirit still desires the blasphemy

And this blade of Braquemard
The tool of His glory
Everything is burnt from within
Torture and humiliation
This divine depravity dwells within
And those voices...
Coming straight from Him

Waiting for Sabbath
I wallow in little children's bowels
Their blood in vigor and communion
So I eat this innocent corpus
My soul suffers no longer
And visions of insanity become real
The Witch baptised me
In the dark rites of necromancy

Conjuration begins
The Head speaks, black candles
Blood of a child and its bones
Necklace and black robes
Sacrifice for the Devil
Corruption and Depravity
This soul is soldâ¦
He has wonâ¦

Giant Green Serpent

The ultimate blasphemy
Crowning my greed and sanity
Devil's witches
Whisper the cruel truth
(I) can't tell when I was
Touched by HIM and died...
