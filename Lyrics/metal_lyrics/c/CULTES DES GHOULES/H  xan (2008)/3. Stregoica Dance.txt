The sun wept upon the motionless crowns of trees
Unearthly mists steal in the savage woods
The coven gathers in adoration of the Evil One
Darkness thickens and smothers the light

Sombre procession proceeds
Fullmoon invites to a banquet
Howling of the ghoules
Bats and wolves hail Stregoica
As they naked fleat

Cursed forgotten glade
Bursts with the heat of sin
Pleasuring hell's whores
Stregoica dance!
Sunset evokes infernal fire
Eyes radiant with morbid desire
Stregoica dance!
Weave the dreadful spells
Dance in erotic revelry
In fragant depravity
Stregoica dance!

They rise from tombs called life
Harlets of the Devilish One
They curse the living flesh
Chanting hymns of passion

Cold putrid hearts
Burst with love
for the Master in the Shadows
Ordog! Ordog!

Torches are lit
The mob of unclean spirits
and ghostly creatures of the night appreach
Infanticide with no pity
Kisses of plight for Him
Impious cestasy
Insatiable cruelty

The coven salutes the Powers of Hades
and taste the fruits of the sinful night
