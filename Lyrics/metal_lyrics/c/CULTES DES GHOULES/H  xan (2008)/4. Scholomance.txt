Once in a while
The Chosen ones are called to a secret place
in the heart of mist-covered mountain
by a small lake immeasurably deep
Beneath which the dragon sleeps

Only ten are allowed to enter
Only nine are released to return

The ten dared to enter
the spectral domain
Following the path in fullmoon
and the howling of the wolves

Come the knowledge of the Earth
Secrets of nature
The language of animals
All imaginable magic spells

This is the place
only born to darkness
can find and see
When the Devil in Flesh
claims new schlars
