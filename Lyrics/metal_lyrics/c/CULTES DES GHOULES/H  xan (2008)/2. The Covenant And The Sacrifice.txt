They call me with secret tongues
Louder and louder...
Sharper and sharper...
The signs are as clear as never before
Even the blade is more urgent now

Poisoned, envenomed
I tread the path of final transfiguration
Dark, decayed dungeon
And scream...
yelling so horrible

The life code is abandoned

The flames of Hell are blazing on a mountain
The Devil is watching through me
And They're coming from the deepest woods
Chain ties this holy flesh
Blood of sodomy and mass rape
Streaming into the holy grail

Bell rings the witching hour
The blood was shed
The child was slain
Through those deeds He rises...
Under the thunderous sky they're flying
Witches with red eyes
They can see through my mind

Anger becomes rapture, Hatred becomes orgy
Another soul is sold, mother becomes His Witch
Satan sitting on his throne of skulls

My soul is dead, but flesh still lives
Covenant has been signed, hallucinations depart...
The Witch wants a sacrifice, hallucinations depart...
Dark, decayed dungeon...
