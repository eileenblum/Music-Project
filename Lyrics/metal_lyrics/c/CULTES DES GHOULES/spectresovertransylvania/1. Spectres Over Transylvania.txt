Night... Forest... stormwind and growling skies
Night, her depth and pervasive ominousness
Lightning rumble at heights
The forests dreaming of bloodfilled unquiescence

From the depths of Snagov crawls the dread
Bloodred moon entered the chamber of deceased kings
Broke the spell and shadows spread
Mountains engulfed in the silhouette of Dark Wings

The blue freezing fog that rubs its tail upon the woods
Stroke its crawl into every corner of the dusk
Born of Dragons prowler silently broods
Ona s strayed wanderer he feeds, found aghast

The sky is darkened, beautiful changed by night
And strom and darkness so wondrously strong
Chorus of wolves with infernal might
Joined in howl, close to a village they throng

Phantom Lord eternal in dread
The dreadful grace
The dakr-seekers strive to embrace
What haunts the feeble human race
Terrorizing is thy fame
Lord of the rats, the Black Ace
Savage beasts sing sets nights aflame
Dark and unfathomed are thy ways

The blue freezing fog that rubs its tail upon the woods
Stroke its crawl into every corner of the dusk
Born of Dragons prowler silently broods
Ona s strayed wanderer he feeds, found aghast

The dark kiss of damnation reaches beyond the spectral palace

Like a nightside priest
Graces his loyal tribes
Call for the feast
It's the night of creeping death
Creatures of undying lust
Bite and suck and attack
Feel the cold grave's breath
Like a night's beloved priest
Spreads infliction on the earth
Bears the cruellest beauty
The Devil's anointed, the nocturnal beast

In the spectral palace of Moroi
Only seen by the doomed
Cries and shrikes of gloomed
Cold dark waves approach
From the crypts that hold
The arcane of immortality

Poor ye wanderer who got lost within
The grim land like a deep treat of hell
Beware! It's the dark night closing in
To swallow your soul and keep you to dwell
For eternities as a crying fiend
Knowing onlu the hues of the grave dark
And whispers of the cold undying wind
Nevermore to see the dawn's fiery spark

If you tread the path of demons
Tread it in the most cruel
Most hideous manner
If you build a mountain of corpses
Build it to the sky
If you shed blood
Let it run like a river

O mighty Devil, wrapped in mists,
untouched by mortal's fist
O potent Evil, whose blood filled pasts
all in awe admire we must
Curse and death were stamped upon thy land
where many infidels met their end
O decay inwrought, robed in grave's breath,
never dying, mocking death
Peasants bless their door with (superstitious) affection
and formulas of protection
Thy (most) feared countnance takes a shape in pestilent air
their fate with blood you smear
Gethered by the candle light, in the darkest astir
"May His cursed form never appear"
Sorrowed song broke the night, wolves do their duty
with voices of bewitching beauty

Night... enshrouds the woods, a sorrowful sight
Dark night comes down prematurely, inexorably
Suffocating fright spreads again like beneful blight
The fog reveals the castle, the splendour of devilry

From depths of Snagov crawls the dread
Across the great vast forest terror sweeps like fiend
The beasts of hell cry out for the return of the undead
Sky and hills mingled in the bitter whirl of wind

The sky is darkened, beautifully changed by night
And storm and darkness so wondrously strong
Chorus of wolves with infernal might
Joined the howl, close to a village they throng

O night shapes, heralds of bane
What child or maiden, what blood young?
Will feed the forest's pulsating vein
And satiate the parching tongue?
To whom the requiem will resound?
The anthem og the mournful tone
Whose soul'll be devoured by this unhallowed ground?
Spectres hover above this land forlorn...
