I curse my name
Erasing from the book of life
Kneeling before the new Lord
He reveals to me through Daath
Now He's lurking in this flesh
Lord of Depravation and Crimes
Keeper of Divine Sins and the Great Devilry
So if He demands
So must be done
For the roots of murder
Dwell in me and He is
His Gospels are heard through me
In this moment of blackout
I cannot look at His grace
In mirror gateway
Fear and humiliation
Supreme Possession conquers this flesh
Black Illumination blows my senses
And even earthly memories are inside
Black Flame fills the heart
