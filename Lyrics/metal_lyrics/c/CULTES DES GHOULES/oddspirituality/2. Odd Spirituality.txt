Bother me not with your smile
I'm allergic to your kindness
Please, spare me your holy rites
The perversion of the soul
My fetish is too fearful to behold
The cult as sinister as old
I find beauty in the exhumed graves
When the moon shines with cadaverous light
I'm off to revel in profanation
Master Leonard - I am your comrade in damnation
I'd never pack with flock
Satans rebuking sin
I flushed thee like a vermin
With the stream of my single spit
Doomed to wander the deserts of oblivion
Watching the moral doctrines going to rack and ruin
Gods of your weaknesses are my defeated foes
My Lord has horns!
