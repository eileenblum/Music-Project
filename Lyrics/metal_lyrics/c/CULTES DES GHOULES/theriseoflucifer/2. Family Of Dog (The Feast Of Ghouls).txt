[originally by Necromantia]My reign beneath the graveyard
my kingdom's underground disease of necrophagia
child of Ancient Gods.
My shape's a living fear
my eyes reflecting horror
my growl will make you creep.

[Chorus:]
Let's all gather under the moonlight
prepare our feast this unholy night
come my brothers
follow my signs
this is the feast of ghouls.

I growl into your coffin
licking my lips for flesh
the highest of repulsions
the sacrilege of death.

I'm the cremator
from ashes I've been born
you're destined for my supper
your corpse is my rebirth.

I love to crunch your bones one by one ripping you to shreds
suck the eyeballs of your socket feeling the taste.
Your tender tongue is a special piece rotten in your mouth
your entrails smell delightfully soon will be mine.
