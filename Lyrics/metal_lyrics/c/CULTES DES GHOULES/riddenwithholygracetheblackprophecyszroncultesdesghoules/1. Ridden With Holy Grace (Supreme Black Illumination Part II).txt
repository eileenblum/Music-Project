[performed by Cultes des Ghoules]Malform me, torment me
mute my joy, twist my sight,
make my days as dark as night
come demons, come devils
feast on me, feast on me
make me a symbol, tear me apart
to abominations I offer my heart

Primitive existence, superstitious
secret fancies for the morbid prevail
life put to no avail
mind eaten by sickening myths
ridden with holy grace
and tales of tormentors
corrupted lusts ablaze
to the joy of false mentors

Come, possess me, the demon's power
hate for the cross begins to flower
the purity of heart you will deflower
god, oh, please, see me from your (distant) tower

I will walk the path of thorn
hail me you who dared to scorn
and doubted, and lived forlorn
to the torment of failth may you be born

Obscured reality
unholy bestiality
pain divine
reason denied

Before the redeemer will return
lord, for thy glory I burn
