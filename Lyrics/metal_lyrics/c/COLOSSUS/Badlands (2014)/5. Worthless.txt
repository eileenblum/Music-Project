I know it's hard to see the diamonds hiding in your soul.
Tomorrow has enough sorrow of its own. I know this road is tough, but you are never alone.

Truth is hard to swallow, when your heart is hollow.

How do you hold your ground when everyone around wants to bury you beneath it.
Hope can still be found. Turn it all around, even if you don't believe it.

I have felt what you feel. I have been where you are.
What doesn't kill us only makes us stronger.

Truth is hard to swallow when your heart is hollow.

My heavy heart keeps dragging me down.
Understand this, you're not worthless.
You're not worthless.

I know your pain, I felt it everyday.
What doesn't kill us only makes us stronger.
Hope can still be found. Turn it all around, even if you don't believe it.
