Slave to the grave death is the debt we all must pay.
I'm sick of living in shades of gray.

I don't expect you to forgive me. I don't deserve it, and I'm not worth it.
Save me from this hell that I brought upon myself.

Everything's the same, and I'm the one to blame; ashamed of myself every single day.
I can't do this on my own.

Slave to the grave death is the debt we all must pay.
Iâm sick of living in shades of gray.

Where do I start to look for forgiveness? Can you really save me, if I really mean this?
Save me from this hell, that I brought upon myself.

Everything's the same, and I'm the one to blame; ashamed of myself every single day.
I can't do this on my own.

Slave to the grave death is the debt we all must pay.
Save me from this hell that I brought upon myself.
