You were always looking down on me.
How could you turn your back on family?
How could you do this to me?

I can't believe the words coming out of your mouth.
I though that I could trust. You filled my heart with doubt.

Well it's all over now.

After all these years that I looked up to you, but you were only looking down on me.
You were looking down on me.

You turned your back on me. Eyes wide open but you still can't see.
You turned your back on me. You're the epitome of hypocrisy.

How could you do this to me?

This is where it begins. Forgot our blessings and counted our sins.
I believed all your lies. Your downcast eyes make me wanna die.

You turned your back on me. Eyes wide open but you still can't see.
You turned your back on me. You're the epitome of hypocrisy.

How could you do this to me?
You meant so much to me. My flesh and blood turned his back on me.
You're recklessness is driving me crazy. You're the epitome of hypocrisy.

You turned your back on me. Eyes wide open but you still can't see.
You turned your back on me. You're the epitome of hypocrisy.
How could you do this to me?

You turned your back on me. Eyes wide open but you still can't see.
You turned your back on me. So you say that I'm going to hell - I guess I'll see you there.

After all these years that I looked up to you,
no matter what you put me through,
I will always forgive you.
