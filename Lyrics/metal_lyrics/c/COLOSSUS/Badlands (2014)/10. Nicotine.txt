You told me, it's better to burn out than fade away. You struck a match and I watched you burn.
Why can't you see what you do to me? Why can't you stay?

As I watched you burn I learn that life's not fair and that no one cares, or maybe that's just what it seems like when every night I feel the pain that I'll have to say goodbye.

You told me, it's better to burn out than fade away. You struck a match and I watched you burn.
Why can't you see what you do to me? Why can't you stay with me?

Terrified of what's to come. I'm just another fatherless son. Father, what have you done?
I know I could have been a better son.

You left but you're not done with me. It's better to burn out than fade away.
Light it up, burn it down from the inside out.
You won't feel a thing when you hit the ground.
Burn it, burn it down. Watch me drown.
I can't fake this, take this so burn it down.

You told me, it's better to burn out than fade away. You struck a match and I watched you burn.
Why can't you see what you do to me? Why can't you stay with me?

Well some say that there's an abandoned church in Hell that never burns down.
Rest in peace said the preacher as he fed my father to the ground.
Thinking of all my past regrets.
Sometimes I burn a cigarette and close my eyes, and pretend that you're still hear.

Where do I go from here, when you disappear. You're gone, gone, gone.
All of the things I should have done, I could have been a better son.
Forgive me father for what I've done.
