Slow burn

How much am I worth because I'm spent.
We take and take until there's nothing left.

We follow blindly and we follow it well, down a foolâs path straight to hell.
The road to hell is paved with good intentions.

Slow burn, to your demise. The fire still burns as you spread your lies.
Force fed, and starved to death. As we choke on our lies the innocent die.

Slow burn

I swear that this world is cold, obey what they say and do what you're told.
I swear that this world is cold, believe what they say and do what you're told.

Life with no meaning and death with no cause, integrity is gone and virtue is lost.

They offer you their hand and rob you blind, if you can't keep up you'll be left behind.

I swear this world is cold, obey what they say and do what you're told.

Slow burn, to your demise. The fire still burns as you spread your lies.
Force fed, and starved to death. As we choke on our lies the innocent die.

Slow burn

How much am I worth because I'm spent, we take and take until there's nothing left.

I swear that this world is cold, obey what they say and do what you're told.
