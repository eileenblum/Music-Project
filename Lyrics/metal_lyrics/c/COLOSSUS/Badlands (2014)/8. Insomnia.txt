I want to know where you hide, when our hearts and hurt collide.
It keeps me up at night, fast asleep watching the world just pass me by.

I don't understand why - for the past 12 weeks I've been talking in my sleep saying âGod please save meâ.

Am I asleep or am I dead? Praying to you at the foot of my bed.
Trying to figure out what your plans were, so many questions that will never be answered.

Why did my best friend lose his faith? Maybe he never had it in the first place?
Why do the children have to suffer, while I sit here in comfort?
Why do I have to watch my father die? Too many thoughts running through my mind.
Why do we do this to ourselves? We search for heaven while creating hell.

I want to know where you hide, when our hearts and hurt collide.
It keeps me up at night, fast asleep watching the world just pass me by.

I don't mean to question your place. but another kid killed himself today.
Were you there? Are you there? Did you feel his pain?

Wide awake and wondering why - why don't you hear their prayers instead of mine?
Complacent hearts tear us apart, was this your plan from the very start?
I know this all happens for a reason. He dwells in a place where there are no seasons.
When we return, we learn that grace isn't fleeting
It just seems silent when nobody's listening.

I want to know where you hide, when our hearts and hurt collide.
It keeps me up at night, fast asleep watching the world just pass me by.
