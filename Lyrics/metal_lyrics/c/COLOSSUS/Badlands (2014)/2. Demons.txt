I can feel them deep within, crawling underneath my skin. Trapped inside my mind, running out of time.
Losing my mind? Stuck behind this peace I cannot find, Iâm losing my mind.
They hold my hands over the fire and I burn everything I touch.
How can you hide from whatâs inside?
I can feel them running up and down my spine.

Demons in my head, I got demons in my bed. I can feel them breathing down my neck.
All these demons inside me, everything I do and see. Jesus save me, save me.

All my demons give me reasons to kill myself, the devilâs riding shotgun straight to hell. Just one last hit and Iâm lit dragging my soul down to the pit. No matter how deep Iâm in, you save me from my sin.
They hold my hands over the fire and I burn everything I touch.
I feel like Iâve been chasing the wind. How can you forgive me after what I did?

Demons in my head, I got demons in my bed. I can feel them breathing down my neck.
All these demons inside me, everything I do and see. Jesus save me, save me.

Tap, tap, tap, on my window pane the devil visited me the other day
I know myself all too well same old hell, just a different devil.
I can feel this hate building up in me, my thieving hands are so greedy. Dead inside this rotten mind, too many sins to hide. I know myself all too well, same old hell just a different devil.
Demons in my head, I got demons in my bed. I can feel them breathing down my neck.

All these demons inside me, everything I do and see. Jesus save me, save me.
