Just as you got it all figured out, what goes around comes back around.
Spit words like bullets into the back of their mind, swung full circle and left behind.

We all must reap what we have sown, we all must know, but we act like we don't.
Actions and consequence, how we treat each other doesn't make any sense.

Making others feel our pain, expect to feel the same. As we all die in vain.
I will get what I deserve, get back the pain that I served. Held down by the weight of the world.

Just as you got it all figured out youâre dead wrong, my pain is your favorite song.
If you cheat you're gonna get cheated. Treat others as you want to be treated.
Take back the things you say, step back from yesterday.
Treat a man like a dog and he'll act like one, kick a man like a dog and he'll bite back like one.

If words have power to kill, they must have the power to heal.
