Sick and tired, I'm at the end of my rope. Every word we say is held under a microscope.
If freedom and equality is what you believe, practice what you preach.

Why are we the outcast?

Pick apart our lives and what we believe, I guess I'm just "bigot" with my heart on my sleeve.
Iâm expected to accept your american dream.

Perpetuate all this hate, you say that I'm wrong and I don't belong, made an outcast because of my faith.
You expect respect with your hands around my neck. Everyday this noose gets tighter and tighter.

Dragging these chains until they break, no one's free unless we change.
We drag the same chains we feel the same pain.
Made an outcast because of my faith, I'm sick of living in a world of hate.
We drag the same chains we feel the same pain.

If were all equal why is God the problem, not the people?
Maybe weâre both to blame, we all suffer the same.

And we're sinking deeper and deeper.

Dragging these chains until they break, no one's free unless we change.
We drag the same chains we feel the same pain.
Made an outcast because of my faith, I'm sick of living in a world of hate.
We drag the same chains we feel the same pain.

Just grow up, we don't share the same beliefs but we deserve the same love.
I'm sick and tired of all this pain we drag these chains until they break.
So let's dig a grave and put hate back into its place.
Dragging these chains until they break, I'm sick and tired of all this hate.

If freedom and equality is what you believe practice what you preach.

Why are we the outcast?

I won't be an outcast.
