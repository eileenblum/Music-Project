You know what morality is?
I 'll tell you what it is, morality is made for those who own it. The rich.
And you know who's always right ? The rich and the poor pay the
price.
You wanna see my morality ? Sure you won't regret it?
I don't know, I think it's gonna scare you. Take a look.
That's morality for you. You know why I carry this around ?
The guy in blue who shows off his morality dig? He's got the upper
hand, he and his fuking justice, but me ? Here's my justice, whether
you're right or wrong, same difference friend !
To each his own life, to each his own morality. My life? There's
nothing to it. It's the life of a sorry chump, they should write that
someday.
The story of a man like so many others, as common as can be.
Inner turmoil is part of him. Meanwhile an educator nabs his
innocence in the name of Jesus.
At the age of 14, driven by survival, he learns to be a butcher.
After a rough couple of years, his horsemeat trade gains momentum.
At last he can start living, he dates a young worker and bursts her
hymen.
But even precipitates, 9 months later he fathers a baby girl.
Rejected by the mother, he's forced to raise his daughter on his own.
Years go by, the meat market struggles on.
Like every man is being of pure survival, Like every man is being of
pure survival.
