We pay the happiness to live by the fear of dying.
A forever farewell, condemned, no curse.
Nothing controls me anymore,
Exploring further memories as far as my eyes could see, free to search
every vestige of my existence, what slumbers in me.
I have already died, several times, already felt the ashes of my ghosts,
all the symptoms of pressure.
Each time following the phoenix doctrine,
Just carry the burden alone, watch me burn, feel me burn.
Easier said than done, trudge through the rough place kingdom of
anguish,
I wish I could find an endless reassurance, no descent (into hell), no
resurrection, no regrets, regret is a second mistake.
I won't do the same mistake again, fill the oceans with apathy is not
for me anymore.
I have gathered my strenghts.
I'm not missing you.
I won't do the same mistake again, fill the oceans with apathy is not
for me (anymore).
I have gathered my strenghts so be prepared for it.
