We never held in the present time. We anticipate the future as too slow
to come, as to hasten its course, or we remind the past to stop it as too
short.
So careless that we wander through times which are not ours, and
don't think of the only one who belongs to us, to us.
TIME, MOTHERFUCKER !!
And so vains that we think of those who are nothing, always let escape
without reflection the only one who remains.
The fact is that present time hurts us, present time hurts us.
We hide it from our sight because it saddens us, and if it seems
pleasant we regret seeing it escape.
We try to sustain it by the future and dream about having all the things
which are not in our power. For a time we are never supposed to
reach.
People must have a closer look on their thoughts, all are obsessed by
the past and the future.
Here are the germs of sadness...
We never held in the present time. We anticipate the future.
