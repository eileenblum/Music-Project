Blinding flashing red, 
A thousand angry thoughts scream 
inside your head 

Tendons strain and nerves ache 
Statues break in this 
Frozen, raw communion 
Minds awake 

Sharpen your mind on that whetstone 
Gritting teeth, 
Unloading wailing ghosts here 
spirits flee 

Sit with this suffering 
A Path through pain to purify 
Grieve and cleanse your sins 
A Path through pain to purify 

Sit with this suffering 
A Path through pain to purify 
Breathe and look within 
A Path through pain to purify 

Broken but Clean, 
The open wound in your mind 
Cleansed of pus and dirt 
Healed, pure, cool and sound 

Fluttering butterfly wings 
Lifts the dust and clears the view 
The flowing tears washes away 
mud and caked blood 
The hardened soil loosenes 
the barren landscape fertile once more 
Dig through the layers to within 

Cool, untouched water 
The still pool offers wisdom 
Drink and recieve 
the knowledge that was always yours 

Stand aware
