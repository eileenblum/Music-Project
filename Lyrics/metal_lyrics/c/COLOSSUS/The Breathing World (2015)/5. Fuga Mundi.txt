Close the books 
Pull every page out the frame 
Withdraw your roots out of the earth 
Leave any signs of hunger 
Torn asunder 

Find your way 
Within the foreign shores inside 
To see with clarity 
Determinetely close your eyes 
Live aside 

leave, far far away 
retreat into nourishing shades 
Fade out - exit the stage 
retreat into nourishing shades 

I walk into the murky waters 
No fear to cloud the cold descend 
Feeding the hungry ghosts around me 
They'll be my guides throughout the end 

Stay focused on the breath within breath 
The tide and ebb of thoughts subside 
Illusatory veils surround me 
Pierce the lies to the other side 

Im falling within 
To the birth of man and eternal sin 
The pulsing tone of life surrounds me in my cell 
I'm drinking from an everflowing well 

Planets spin but time stands still 
The world revolve around my will 
I'm one with the one and all that ever was 
All signs of personality is lost 

I weave full tapestries of new worlds 
I rewrite the language of life 
I concieve of ancient lives past by 
I am all and nought an always will 

In this realm 
Invaluable treasures hide 
Find your way to these shores 
Determinately close your eyes
