I found a way, to dissuade, 
and slip into that place again 
I sown the seeds, Through gifts received, 
but I'd give it all to see your face again 

White feathered whispers caress 
The cooling shelter of your wing 
The heavens linger on your breath 
To quench my thirst in your sweet spring 

A shining soul to breathe 
holes through this wet compact darkness 
An honest passion to illuminate 
A wise companion to guide my corrupted spirit 
through these troubled waters 
A sturdy rudder to steer me straight 

Have pity on this feeble flesh 
Keep shining til we meet again 
Embrace me in your tender breath 
Keep shining til we meet again 

Each single breath a silent prayer 
for your safe journey 
Each blink of eye a retrospect 
My haunting ghost, My fleeting angel 
I'll keep you with me always 
Each heartbeat sing for your embrace 

Take your rest in my hard labour 
Find your comfort as I transform 
Mother/child/mind of light 
Through this tension I`ll be reborn
