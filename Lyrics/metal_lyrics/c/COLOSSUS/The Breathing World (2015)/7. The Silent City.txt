Crumbling stone brick breathe 
Shimmering in the dim setting sun 
tree roots roaming the streets 
Heading for the one gone beyond 

Sleepy dust trails crawl 
Gaping building are howling 
Wandring Unbeings callw 
Surrounding forrest stand bowing 

Deep within the city core 
Winding trails from time before 
Unobstructed passagways to daylight 

In the sighing midnight winds 
Echoeing sounds of wisdom sings 
Whispering words that guide insight 

We`ll ligh the torche 
We`ll spread the flame along 

Amidst the silent stars 
Face the final fears 
Appearances are emptiness 
World of man disappears 
Nothing left to affect this day 
Renunciate 

Cut through all the stale vexations 
The dream destroyed 
Reality is void 

Silent inner mass 
Collective strength change pace 
Atoms spinning fast 
Temple life leads the way 

We`ll ligh the torche 
We`ll spread the flame along
