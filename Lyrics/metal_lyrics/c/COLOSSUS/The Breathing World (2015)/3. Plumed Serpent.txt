Carnal communion 
dropping character and shedding skin 
Sacrifice on silken altar 
Two instruments interlocked within 

Polar shifts planets realign 
Slip into and out of mind 
Entering your second nature 
The spiral dance along the spine 

Liberation 
Feathered wings caress my reptile skin 

Hearts in union 
Pumping centering the act 
Steady grip on slippy surface 
Balancing two heavy halves 

Harmonic noise vibrates the air 
Stare mortality straight in the eye 
Vital energies released 
Reach through flesh and light 

Liberation 
Feathered wings caress my reptile skin
