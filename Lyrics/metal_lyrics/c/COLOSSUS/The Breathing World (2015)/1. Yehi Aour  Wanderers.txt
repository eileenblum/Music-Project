Like withering leaves locked to the patterns of the whirling movements of a violent hurricane 
Like pouring blood traces the shape of open wounds 
Guided by the constant pounding rhythm in our veins 

Huddling in formless bodies, skinless and raw. Left lying lonely in the pouring rain 
Living on the doorsill of the apocalypse, a lifetime wasted waiting to exhale 

sinking below the waterline 
swallowed up and washed away 

You burned our homes 
You poisoned our living grounds 
Left naked and exposed 
Loveless, destitute and lone 

Weâve nested by signposts 
Built shelters out of bad advice 
Anxiously watching the skies 
Day by day, hour by hour 

Forever lost here, orphaned and forgotten by an ever absent architect 
Exiled to wander lost in our miseries blind to the crumbeling traces showing us the way 

sinking below the waterline 
swallowed up and washed away
