Iâm not feeling right 
Iâve been gnawing my tounge all night 
Iâm not feeling well 
Iâve had visits from the deepest realms of hell 

Dark is seeping in 
While the Shadows dance within 
Gates are opened wide 
And my Inner worlds projecting through day light 

To claw my way through all this mental weight 
All letters point to the collapse 
The walls contracts the chest cave heave and shakes 
Reliving memories of past 

The day is rotten black - from this day so am I 

await the burning morning aftermath 
The roaring wildness will subside 
Within the crumbling shell a seed take root 
The treasures brought in by the tide 

The day is rotten black - from this day so am I 
The long nights waking thirst - slaked with sacramental wine 

Have you ever felt the morning light blaze up inside 
As sun and moon hangs dark while stars fall from the sky 
have you heard the lifting fury of the trumpet call 
as you loose all sense of self and identify with all 

Iâm not feeling right 
Iâve been gnawing my tounge all night 
Iâm not feeling well 
Iâve had visits from the deepest realms of hell
