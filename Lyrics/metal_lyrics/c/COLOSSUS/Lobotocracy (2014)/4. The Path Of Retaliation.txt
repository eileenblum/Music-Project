Run, run
You're chased
The time that you've just lost made your caught
Run if you want to keep putrid existence
The hunt has started
No way to escape
The hunt has begun
No way to escape

You caused it
Now it's happening to you
Run fast if you want survive
No one escape to the past
You're the first concerned

You killed, raped, tortured
You enjoyed it for too long
You deceided and end to that
It's too late because it's not like
It's not going to happen

Now the beast is awaken
Fury took the control about
You've done them
Now it's your turn

Run, run as a meaningless prey
Hurry up to hide

[2x]
We won't have mercy
We won't let to go

Before having your balls cutted and stucked in your mouth

You will become your former victims
Skinned, attached by your own tired muscles

But it would be too easy to leave you like this
'Cause you don't deserve it
'Cause you don't deserve it
But it would be too easy to leave you like this
'Cause you don't deserve it
'Cause you don't deserve it worth

We'll let free 
Keep you safe
But scared forever
The hunting game will soon start
Run, run little prey
