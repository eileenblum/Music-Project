If all you do is run from death and seek to satisfy the flesh your merits will mean nothing, you will never be anything.

For you are dust and to dust you shall return. if all you do is run from death and seek to satisfy the flesh your merits will never mean a thing, you will never be anything at all. Hold fast to the one who's arms are hope. In the distance I hear the call, like an anchor for the weary, "he will provide". For those who give there life now is the only time to live for Christ.

You search for what you will not find, the truth is found only in light and darkness controls your heart. So turn and face all that you've done and trust that he's the only one who's death can bring you life.

You will not last or will anything you have to find what you seek means giving up everything that you have remove from flesh, the flesh is so weak without light you'll never find what you seek

You search for what you will not find, the truth is found only in light and darkness controls your heart. So turn and face all that you've done and trust that he's the only one who's death can bring you life.

So turn from your ways before you fall to your face say your goodbyes to your life full of lies, and believe in the blood that was shed in despise, by a world full of sin. I confess that I'm a mess and worthless I promise without him I am nothing at all, without him I can only fall, darkness controls your heart.
