Open your eyes.
Chose very wisely for this could be, the last choice you ever make.
Turn from what you have done.
With every door you close you open a new, open your eyes as you open these doors, to see what's out there waiting for you, waiting out there for you.

You never really understood, turn your back to all thats good, when each choice, you make could be your biggest mistake, but its not too late. By the grace of God you are saved not my works but faith you are saved.

By the grace of god you're saved not by works but faith, so lets stop to think of our actions of today.

You are saved.

Come to your senses start searching for the truth, redemptions still out there waiting for you. You blinded yourself behind these lies, redemptions out there waiting for you. Heed the warning of our convictions, with every single choice you make, each choice it could shake or brake, the fortune of the future, what happened the meaning of faith, we'll figure it out some day, you never told that it wasn't easy.

God please clean these hands of greed for they will always grab for more. For the path you walk will you find what you're looking for?

In the end what will you find?

Your time is on the line like the blind leading the blind will you find what you're looking for in the end what will you find?
