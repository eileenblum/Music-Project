Your talk is cheap. You lie, you steal, you cheat, and you kill, you wont stand still until you rape everything I love. You live a lie and spread this disease, I'm not naive enough to believe a single word you say, ruin and misery mark your way. Your throat is an open grave. No fear of God, no fear of God in your eyes. No fear of God, no fear of God in your eyes

You line your pockets with the blood of the innocent, pave the way to your final judgment. How much will you pay to see another day? You've got one foot in the bank and the other one in the grave.

You say that its too late but this ends, this ends, ends today. No longer will I let this go on, you fabricated this lie for far too long. Soon everyone will see right through your deceit, never say that it's too late. As long as I'm still alive there will always be a way!

So lets make history, I know I won't be the end of you but you haven't seen the last of me. You must be made of glass because I can see right through you, I will never trust a thing you do. Every time you talk murder spews from your lips, trust me in not falling for your tricks, now. You're running out, running out of lies to tell, you just bought a one way ticket straight to hell.

All of the money in the world won't save you now, sadly enough you only praise the sound of your voice and the work of your hands I pray that some day you will understand that you soon will feel the pain, every dollar you horde is fuel to your flame. But dont ask for help because you wanted this all for yourself

You make me sick.

Unlike your agenda your talk is cheap, you sell a lie and prey on the weak, live a lie and spread this disease I'm not naive enough to believe a single word your say your throat is an open grave, you're digging your own grave, buried alive by your lies. No fear of God, no fear of God in your eyes, do you fear our God? You better fear your God! Do you fear my God?
