I'm done chasing the sunset, the sun sets on my back tonight. I'm never looking back, I'm never giving up without a fight.

Don't look back to the past I won't let this hold me down, get up and stand your ground. A new life awaits behind these doors, well picture this I'm not running anymore. Shake the dust from your sleeve tell me what you're fighting for, well picture this I'm not running anymore.

It's time for me, to become the man I'm supposed to be. It's time for me to get back, to get back, on my feet. Sick of this life I lead. Sick of pretending I'm someone I'm not, I dont regret a thing I don't believe in luck so let's stop to say enoughs enough.

Set your eyes to the horizon never look back, never falter. So take action, "failure is not an option".

The heart holds secrets of great sin with each scar of the past holds a story from within.

Sovereign you stand who I've been made who I am, the future only holds who I am today.

My revelation has brought me to the realization if we continue to live for this world we will never change the future only holds who I am today.
