Before I knew you I was scum of earth, empty and broken from the moment of birth. Without you I am no one. â¨All we are is filthy dust if I were him I wouldn't claim us. We are all dirty thieves, doing what we want when we please. Who will save me from this body of death, a miracle from every breath. Empty and broken body of death. 
I gaze into this void of problems and I see myself begging for help. â¨Once you choose your path there is no turning back. It's everything or nothing - it's now or never staring face to face with forever. â¨Don't choke, swallow your pride - everyone deserves to die. â¨As far as I can tell we should all be burning in hell. Only your grace can save, just and supreme forever sovereign He reigns.
I gaze into this void of problems and I see myself begging for help. â¨How can we live our lives as if they were our own how could we call this place our home. We are the heirs to the throne.
