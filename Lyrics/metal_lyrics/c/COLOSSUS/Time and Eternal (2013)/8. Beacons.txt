What happened to that heart of fire
that burned so bright so everyone can see?
A light of truth like a becaon that brings us back to You.
I lose myself with every sin like a fire dying in the wind.
I may stumble on Your path but You always get me back on my feet.
On my feet.
All I am is a broken promsie, don't let me disappoint You again.
Every sin is another nail in the cross
Why do I do this to You?
Why do I do this to myself?
I don't know if I can follow this path without turning my back.
I can't set myself free but maybe that isn't how it was meant to be.
I can't save myself.
Condemn me to hell if for a moment I believe I can save myself.
Intentions of righteousness are not my own. Not my own.
But from Christ alone.
Every sin is another nail in the cross
Why do I do this to You?
Why do I do this to myself?
I am trying to be a better man - striving to live my life guided by your hand
