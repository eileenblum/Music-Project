All of this means nothing, tell me what are we living for, as we worship a superficial savior. â¨
This world that we live in condones all of my sin. It paints a portrait of acceptance, of a world that puts more worth in possessions then our very own loved ones. 
â¨It seems to be all you see is someone on the street trying to sell you on who you should be. â¨You can never buy beauty and you will never define me. 

â¨Tonight, tonight you're the only reason that my heart still beats, I wish everyone could see. It doesn't matter. It never mattered. Supersede everything I see that isn't you. It doesn't matter it never mattered. You are the one that can save me from myself no one else can save me from this hell. â¨

Turn my back to the ones that made me, brainwashed by society. You can have everything in the world but it all means, nothing. â¨

We are so near sided we are blinded from the truth. We waste our lives always wanting more. We're always searching for a Superficial Savior. 

â¨Tonight, tonight you're the only reason that my heart still beats, I wish everyone could see. It doesn't matter. It never mattered. Supersede everything I see that isn't you. â¨It doesn't matter it never mattered. You are the one that can save me from myself no one else can save me from this hell.
