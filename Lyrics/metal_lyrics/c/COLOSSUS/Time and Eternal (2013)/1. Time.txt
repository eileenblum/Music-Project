When I die where do I go
Do I ascend up above or do I rot in this whole?
I amma sinner just like the rest.
Do I ascend up above?
Does the fire feast on my flesh?
When I die where do I go
Do I ascend up above or do I rot in this whole?
Death is the path to eternity from time -
Look in my eyes and watch me, watch me die.
Watch me die.
The shadows of my past are cast too dark -
too dark for me to shine.
Buried alive by the sands of time,
the hourglass flips as I begin to die.
Death is a transformation to eternity from time.
Lost at sea I float into the darkness of my mind.
So what's the point of being alive,
cause ever since I can remember I've been living a lie.
Living a lie.
I am ashamed of what I've done
I hate what I have become,
one last breath before the plunge.
I let the ocean fill my lungs.
We live and die by the hands of time.
The taste in my mouth reminds e of a place -
a place that I once knew.
I lay adrift in this occean of time,
waiting for the tide to bring me back to you.
I thought I heard you say my name
I'm digging my own grave.
Watch me die.
Watch me die.
