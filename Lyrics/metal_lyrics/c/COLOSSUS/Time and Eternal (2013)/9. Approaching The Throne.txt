Approaching the throne - you delivered me from death,
my eyes from the tears, you gave my heart every breath.
You took away my regrets, nothing in my hands I bring.
Simply to the cross I cling.
You paid my debt and now I'm free.
You washed my hands clean and now I'm free.
He put His son in my place, not in vain.
It's the heart of grace.
All of the things I don't deserve I have received,
Creator of heaven and earth, your death is what animates me.
My name is written on His hands, my name is written on His heart,
He forged all of my plans from the very start
from His love I will never depart.
I will approach the throne in faith.
Approaching the throne - you delivered me from death,
my eyes from the tears, you gave my heart every breath.
You took away my regrets, nothing in my hands I bring.
Simply to the cross I cling.
You paid my debt and now I'm free. And now I'm free.
He put His son in my place, not in vain.
It's the heart of grace.
All of the things I don't deserve I have received,
Creator of heaven and earth, your death is what animates me.
i will sing a song of praise, I will glorify your name,
You put Your son in my place,
You paid my debt, and now all I know is grace.
You have given me everything,
I long to hear You say, "You are forgiven."
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Salvation has been won!
I am a beggar adopted as a son,
I long to hear You say, "You are forgiven."
