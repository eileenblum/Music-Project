How can you forgive me if I can't forgive myself?
I took you for granted and now you're gone.
How could you take him from me?
Father dig my grave...
No matter what I go through I could never - never forget you.
Memories run through my mind,
only memories frozen in time,
I have so much pain things aren't just the same.
He lived a life of happiness,
a life filled with love,
I need you just to keep breathing.
Who knows what tomorrow will bring.
Because tomorrow's a broken promise.
Live my life in regret
It was so hard to see you go
but in the end there is hope.
I will never let go.
Live my life in regret
It was so hard to see you go
but in the end there is hope.
I will never forget you.
You took his life like a thief in the night
For all I know you could take mine -
with the blink of an eye when you could die
I watched the light leave your eyes.
I will see you again, until then
I will cherish these memories
You will always have a place in my heart.
Live my life in regret
It was so hard to see you go
but in the end there is hope.
I will never let go.
Live my life in regret
It was so hard to see you go
but in the end there is hope.
I will never forget you.
I put you in the ground, but I see you in the sky.
If you could see me now you would be so proud.
