One nation under God,
where is God in this nation?
No one is safe, our worst fears are yet to come.
I will embrace the end.
This nation is decaying from the inside out.
I realize we live lives of lies.
Stab out my eyes and rid me of my sight.
This culture teaches us how to die.
So we must stand and fight for what is right.
We are the threat.
Try and cut me down but you won't.
You think you're so smart like you know something I don't.
Well know this I'm sick of the lies.
Never will I bow to you
Never will I die
One nation under God,
where is God in this nation?
This nation is decaying from the inside out.
I realize we live lives of lies.
Stab out my eyes and rid me of my sight.
This culture teaches us how to die.
But we must stand and fight for what is right.
You are not safe, your worst fears are yet to come.
When death rears its ugly head you will rue the day,
I will embrace the end.
We are the threat.
We are the threat.
