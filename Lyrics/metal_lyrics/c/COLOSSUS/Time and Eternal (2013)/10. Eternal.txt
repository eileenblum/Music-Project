Finally I know the truth, finally I've been renewed.
I stand on solid ground,
I know there has to be more to life than what we see.
I know there's more life than just me.
I stand on solid grund.
You save me from my own demise.
Every scar is a constant remimnder of the former self,
that empty shell of a man that I once was.
I am forgiven for what I've done.
All of my sins are washed away by Your holy son.
I am not a slave to death.
I will not become like the rest.
I am not a slave to death.
I will not become like the rest.
I will not sit idly and watch you burn.
I will not become another burden on this earth.
Finally I know the truth, finally I've been renewed.
I stand on solid ground,
I know there has to be more to life than what we see.
I know there's more life than just me.
I stand on solid grund.
Finally I'm set free.
I am forgiven, I am a new man,
I will eagerly wait for the end.
I'll leave this past life behind me,
now finally I'm free!
