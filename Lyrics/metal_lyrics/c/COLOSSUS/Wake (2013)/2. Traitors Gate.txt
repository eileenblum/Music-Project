Dark clouds, covers the naked sun
Hide sky from above you,
Suck the warmth from out the ground
As cold wind chill the marrow in your bone
Just think upon,
What you have done
You've gone and fucked them all,
And they'll soon be dead and gone

Red sun shatters the clouded sky
Casting a bloody glow about
Mirroring a gruesome sight
As fresh blood seeps into sludge and mire
You stop and sigh
And question why
You allowed your life to go so awry

And as the sun slowly slips into it's slumbering dip
And allow night to fall
Marching feet in the night with a purposeful stride
Catch you at a crawl

Cold hands grips
Shackles bite tight and locks your mind

Blue skies displaying a beaming sun
Bringing life back to this world
Waking up the sleeping ones
As you slowly drift to your fate
A thousand dead eyes observing with hate
While you pass... Pass through the gate
