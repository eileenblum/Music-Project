Bright rays wakes to life
Movements of mind
Patterns unwind
Mount the backs of birds of prey

Process of decay
Lead the way
Ice cold stare
Feathery touch, shades of grey

White taste of time
Smoke clears the line
Flesh left behind
Painted path clear as day

Process of decay
Move don't stay
Lifted spirits, path of way

Climbing higher
Take to flight
Wings in motion
Move towards the light

Closing in as
Shapes take form
Rip the clouds
Break through the storm

Open space invade the mind
Seeping through to nest inside
