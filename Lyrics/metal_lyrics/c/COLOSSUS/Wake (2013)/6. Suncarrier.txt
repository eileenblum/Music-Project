Bear that sphere
Like your first born
You'll guard it with your life

Raised to face
The shining
The honour it till you die

A searing pain flashes through his veins
As his flesh touches the orb
A wave of fear, to stand before the object
Shakes him to the core

His grip is trembling around the burning ball
His shadow's withering away
A lifetime spent in awe of the eternal
A purpose lost in the decay

His skin now blistered and black
His muscles aching and sore
A million lives, spared through his efforts
A creature shunned forevermore
