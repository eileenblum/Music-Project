Silence chimes
Salt seas brime
Hibernate in slow vibration
Dream the larval
Great massed mind
Breathe the sludge of time
Bring the storm to cleanse us all

Solemn Stone
Bathe in mystery
Stand alone
Past all end to see
Pillars of perennity

Dark skies fall
End it all
Writhing tense in slow descension
See us falter
War cries call
Doom upon us all
This is where your worlds divide

See, the tides bring back the blinded profecies, wash ashore the myths of blood
Time dilutes the stage of infancy,
Drink your milk mixed with the mud
Salts of fire from stone
The secrets in the kiss
Accept the silent teachings
Of the eternal Megalith
