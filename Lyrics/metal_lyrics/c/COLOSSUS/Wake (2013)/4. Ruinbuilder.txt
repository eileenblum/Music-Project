A life spent brewing the obsession
To raise monuments off loss
Purposeless measure for grand aspirations
The work is worth less than the cost
And the result is better off
Waste not want not

A heavy burden for any sane man
Shallow movements to abide
Empty gestures to disperse them
The dark will swallow the derived
And keep disciples in the blind
Waste not want not

A trail of cracked and crumbling sillouettes
A garden of corroded hopes
His legacy will sing over dirt and dust
As the sun will set once more
Dark passions and a cowards hands
Heart of war, mouth of decay
The craft was weaker than the will to build
As the ambtions swept away
A firm mask of confidence
A foundation of earth
The strong and the unbreakable
Are built broken from birth

Build your ruins
Make your early grave
All your structures
Are created to fade

As the sun breaks through the dark
And the night turns into day
There is nothing left to say
