I drag my raw feet through the dirt
I cast no shadow where I stagger
I grab a handful of the dry black soil
A barren earth for nought to grow

Caverns and valleys as smooth as skin
An endless journey in this lifeless land
Where all things turns to dust

The landscape slips and heaves as timeworn limbs and tissues comes alive

With bone dry skin and broken teeth
With parched throat and sand filled lungs
I raise my gaze to cloudless skies
No signs to bring any release

Caverns and valleys as smooth as skin
The landscape slips and heaves as timeworn limbs and tissues comes alive

Each footprint rests upon a graveyard
Each grain of sand seen kingdoms grow and falter
And rise again so...
Rise!
