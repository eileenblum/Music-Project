As evening light dimming down its golden glow
Shadows growing longer on the desert floor
The canopy is wide and open staring down with burning eyes
Mysterious forces creeping under my hide

Funny figures flit
dancing on your retina
Flickering in the flooding light

Dark contours contort
Shapeless shadows vanishing
Patterns praying in your mind

White foam froths
Ripples on the silver chord
Echoing in the cutting cold

Black steam blow
Fumes are flowing endlessly
Golden challice crumbeling

Loosing sense of space and time

I feel the voices showing
Dormant senses in my body lets me see
Sights of the worlds beyond me opens
Memories of times before awoken
