As the spring rain hits my face
I quietly realize this could end no other way
And as the ground slowly turns black and wet
I solemnly walk astray

Down in a hollow of this rock
Sorry pieces that faintly resembles
I'll carry this along somehow
My burden alone to bear
I draw a silent breath
A pungent smell of wet soil fills the air
The sky gave finally way
And the pieces yet remains

 From below a gleaming sky
A slow movement of confusion and regret
A way out is running thin
And the journey is to beguin

Slow your breath
Lower your gaze
Stow your intentions
Forget your ways
This is the turning point
An open passage way
As the realities of common life
And your old self fades away
