Deep in the earth, where the sleeper gives birth to great wonders
In the belly of the soil where all living recoils and daylight gets torn asunder
Among false deeds and swollen leafs they slumber
As rites of passage clears the ashes exposes the worn and plundered

Where no thought dwell...
They feed the broken shell
Where the unconscious still lingers
The flicking of delicate fingers

Of the dirt out of wasted attempts
A sting of hope moving in the debris
Of the ashes out of fear and contempt
A single breath of life flows in the breeze

In days of yore, the seeker explored lost faces
When the ears of the broken hears the unspoken and connects the fading traces
Old tragedies becomes new remedies to bring action
Where all is destroyed, out of the void breeds a new distraction

With no air to dream
There is no life to be seen
Where the ghosts still roam
Is where they call their home

Dark, cavelike halls
Tear down the walls
Let out the night
Damp, suffocating rooms
Air out the womb
Let in the light

Oh, great winds, give me the wings to soar once again
Oh, take me with you, carry me up high and rejoyce as I ascend
