You can't see what I see
You can't hear what I hear
You can't feel what I feel
You can't find me, man!

I think, I knew...
Why should I remember, who I am?
How could it happened with me?
My only question is: WHY?

Monday again, I got to wake up
And didn't want more than a fuckin' cigarette
But I'd got a feeling, there's something wrong
I realized, all my memories are lost...

I thought I've swallowed something
Or beat my head somewhere
I've drove a nail in with my brows
Or that's a dream, and I can't break away?

The picture didn't come clarity,
And I couldn't wait for this
I've just lied on the floor,
And didn't see anything

Monday again, I got to wake up
But I'd got nothing to understand
The only thing, I know surely
It's not a dream, and I can't break away!
