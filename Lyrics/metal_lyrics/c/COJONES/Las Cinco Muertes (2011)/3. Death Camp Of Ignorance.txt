Fuck That!
Which kind of words are rude enough
To tell this shit a thousand times?
I know a place to be our shelter,
To be my home,
To be your grave!

Goddamn,
I've tried to explain contradictions
Tried to cease time to ruminate
No one will revive before 
History repeats itself

No need forgiveness
Just brook relentlessness
Keepin' alive

I feel like a fish, out of water
Cannot deicide, it's freedom, or death?
Everything's different in 3D
Dead men remains unnamed

Escape seems impossible
Freedom as far as conceivable
Everything smells like the burning tire
Lamb of God just waits for the slaughter
