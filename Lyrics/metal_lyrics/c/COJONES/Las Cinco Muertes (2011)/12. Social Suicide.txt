Oh God, or something that You are
How can I live without You?
Look at me, my world's still burning
How can I escape from You?

Such a lonely, wasted, sick and tired guy
Divorced parents were fucked up his life
Hasn't got a chance, to got a little change
Just promises, and some pain in the ass
Suffering was his only crime,
Find he guility, he won't give a fuck
He need a new skin, so tear it apart
Now, he's dying, day by day

Hear some echo of gunshots
Wait for another way to die
Secrets are just dirty thoughts
And no one ever listens to me

Such a lonely, wasted, sick and tired guy
Allways got a jackass, who fucked up his life
Hasn't got a chance to got a little change
Just fake smiles, and some pain in the ass
Dady was a drunk, beat him everyday
He heard everynight, Mommy cries in vain
Here comes the drugs, a gun under the pad
Gangs on the streets and dancing on the edge

Such a motherfuckin' feeling, to see that
Stand in silence, let him kill himself
Didn't tell ever, but he were in love
Take it to the grave, just like me!
