Who's ready to mourn this Era?
Bitterness destroys forgetting
Rain penetrates under our skin
At this night, no one remains innocent

Do not preserve all the old letters
Wicked thoughts makes You nerveous again

Accepted exceptions
To be able to step forward
To reclaim purposes
To forget our common misery

Pull the strings and never look back
Just in case
When every plan's falling
Every ship's sinking
The world's collapsing and say goodbye!

Just give me your best shot
When every plan's falling
Every ship's sinking
The world's collapsing and ask you (WHY?)

Left behind obsessions
To be the last one
To revive this world
Sworn, to be the Keeper of Truth

No one stay, no one pray
No one wants to find damnation
Everyone wants to become on might
Everyone prefers win without fight
I just wants go out there
Do my job, live free, or die hard
The Truth lets You be the last
Let You reing, without compromise

BUT EVERYTHING'S PASSED
