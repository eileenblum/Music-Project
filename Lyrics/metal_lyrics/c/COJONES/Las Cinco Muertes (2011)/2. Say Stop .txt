Bloodshed!
Adrenaline!!
Disaster!!!
Falling!
Forever!!
Decadence!!!

Look into my eyes, come understand!
Don't take more silliness!
Erase the crap, fuck up matters! 
I've lost my tolarence...

This time, you fail, don't try to deny!
Don't wait for forgiveness!
You're allways high, but you never mind...
All the things are insane!

No, it should never be real!
Never be the same before I know...
Before I know, who the fuck are you??

Listen to me, when I say STOP! 
Now!!
(FUCK)

There's not enough time to break out
Let's go, and say good bye!
I've regret when I let your mind out
It fade away by drugs...

Listen to me, when I say STOP! Now!!
Don't test me, 'cause I will fuck you up!
You should know, I don't care where do you go!
Search a place for yourself, and stay there alone!!
