Now, I'm sittin' in the dark,
Hear something welter far away...
Dim sound of devout's mental wars
I feel like a heretic!
No one hear me when I cry,
It's like the coldest prison ever
I can't rise up to burning stars
I feel like an outsider!

There is no life to fight for!
There is no love or hate to feel...

That time, I took a look around
Told those motherfuckers around here!
Leave out all the doublespeak now!
Let's get ready, to go!!

Our way is the same, deep in the dark, now it's our fuckin' home!
Not alone and not together, bein' adrift on the endless highway

Feel like fallin', since 1988
Search ourselves, create utopias,
Chase rainbows, break all the rules,
Always think about the Forever
It's hard to speak without confidence!
I've never seen it's consequence...
Locked in a cage with requirements,
20 miles down, on the seabed

Now, I'm sittin' in the dark,
Hear something welter far away...
Dim sound of devout's mental wars
I feel like a heretic!
No one hear my when I cry
Inside my coldest prison ever
I can't rise up to burning stars
Rescue me, let me disappear!!
