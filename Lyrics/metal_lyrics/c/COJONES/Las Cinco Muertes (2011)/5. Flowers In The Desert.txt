Where is the end of this ocean, that absorbed us?
How far is the other shore?
One moment I'm drowning
But at the next, I breath the cold air
Everything's frozen
Everything is dead

How long to keep walking?
How to see clear the way?
Who bring me peace?
I know, there's no one to blaim!

Stray lights shines down to the sand
This silence worse than it ever was
Heart shaped clouds watchin' over us
Sear bones creaking below our feet

Dreamland's full of dangers
But I think it's something more
That's how hard to never look back
That's how hard to find ourselves

Dead men helps to step forward
Survivors prolongs our misery
Perheps, we will stay here forever
Till we find salvation!
