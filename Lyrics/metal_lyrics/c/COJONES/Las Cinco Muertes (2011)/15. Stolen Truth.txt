Delusion climbs on people's minds
Tumbling masses creates fake lifes

Actually, no one seems to care
This city's wheel keeps rolling on
They all search for an "american dream"
Feel, they have no place to belong

No one wants to be something more
That's what this whole life depends on

Actually, no one seems to care
They all search for an "american dream"

They would rather turn away from us
Face to the ground, everybody's blind
Stolen truth will leave them behind
Compromise makes emptiness inside

Ascendancy gapes it's hungry mouth
No matter who, no matter how
We're all just screws in their machine
They use our fear as their leash
