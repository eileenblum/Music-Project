Look at the sky!
Look at the stars, try to see their eyes!
Look at the sea!
Look at the leaves, flying with the wind!
Don't ask me, why?
Don't ask me, why don't I come home!
Don't set me free!
I don't need to know why can't You be mine...

The conclusion is allways the same
The world won't stop to see you and me
The only thing I try to beilive
It's not the end, and nothing's too late!

I'm too dead to love forever you
You're too scared to love forever me
I'm too damned to know what can I do
And the rain still fallin'...
I'm too dead to love forever you
You're too scared to love forever me
I'm too damned to know what can I do
But your light's still shine in me...

In this times, everything is gray
At these nights, the only voice is the rain...

At those nights I just return to You
Can You remember, why did I that, many times?
Where were You, when I needed your arms?
What did you think, why had it falled apart?
