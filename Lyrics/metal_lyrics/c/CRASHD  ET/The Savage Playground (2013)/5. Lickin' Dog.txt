You fuckin' dickhead
You fuckin' shithead
Standing knocking on my door again
You drunken fuck up
Should keep your mouth shut
I won't ever fill your cup again
Lock up the freak
And throw away the key

You're just a licking dog
Standing in my way
Now get your wet hands off
You ain't got nothing for me
Don't you waist that smile on me

You cynic muppet
Shitplaying puppet
Lickin' balls of other bands again
You dirty suck up
Put on some make up
I don't wanna see that face again
Lock up the freak
And throw away the key

You're just a licking dog
Standing in my way
Now get your wet hands off
You ain't got nothing for me
Don't you waist that smile on me

You're just a licking dog
Standing in my way
Now get your fat ass out
Don't you go bring shit on me
I'm a cool cat you're a licking dog
