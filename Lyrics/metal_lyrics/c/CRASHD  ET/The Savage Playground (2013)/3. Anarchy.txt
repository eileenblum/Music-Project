Reborn again
Sick of the illusion
Time has come for misbehavior
Restore again
That sense of mass confusion
Don't go crying for a savior

Angels dying, demons conspiring
Your kingdom starts to fall
Born in fire
Inner desire
The leader of it all

Anarchy
Step up the temperature
A million degrees
No hypocrisy
We fucking need it.....!!!

Destroy the men
Preachers of delusion
No more time for human failure
Be strong again
You victims of illusion
Release the force from inner nature
