We were tasting the gutter
I think I've seen your face before
I walked around like a strutter
And you were dressed up like a whore
You tell the tale of a young girl
Who lost it to the night
We were a part of this new world
I never left you outta sight

If you need me deep inside
Let me take you to the sky
We can dream of you and I

We never tried it don't fight it tonight
If you're excited don't hide it tonight

In the rain without a cover
You put your body next to mine
You had a tail like no other
I drank whiskey
You had wine
