Undead but many are run down
Mislead they're staning in line
All set getting close to the showdown

Unsaid the words unspoken
Misread and led by the blind
Wasted many lives are broken
It's time to leave it all behind

I feel ok I feel alright
Dont need this lie

One day the memory's worn out
One night I'll have it all torn out
Tonight thus haunted playground
Aint your circus
One day the remedy's brought down
This time my hands wont be bound
In time this savage playground
Aint your circus

Defect but I'm still standing
Eject the poison in me
Respect in times of new reckoning
Let in the dark so I can see
