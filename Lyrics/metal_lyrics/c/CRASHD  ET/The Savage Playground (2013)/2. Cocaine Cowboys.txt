Smoke, choke,
One billion dollar coke
For decades the obsession has inspired and provoked
Gun fight
Colombian white
The aftermath corruption of the suits and the ties

Cash, stash, give your money or your blood
You know about the lies that gets you buried in the mud
Excess
You couldn't care less
Until you got the news of your best friends death

Ain't it sick but kinda fascinating
You give it up then you raise the white flag

Save me from the cocaine cowboys
Soldiers of the damned and their godmother
Save me from the cocaine cowboys
Save me from your grace please unholy mother

Taken all these lives it's a bad game
Still the world is crazy about the cocaine

Dust, must, I think I split in two
I know it's evil circle but I'm feeling kind of blue
Dead trash, a junkie outta cash
I wanna beat the coffin so I'm hiding in the ash

Save me from the cocaine cowboys
Soldiers of the damned and their godmother
Save me from the cocaine cowboys
Save me from your grace please unholy mother

Taken all these lives it's a bad game
Still the world is crazy about the cocaine

Save me
Save me

Ain't it sick but kinda fascinating
You give it up then you raise the white flag

Save me from the cocaine cowboys
Soldiers of the damned and their godmother
Save me from the cocaine cowboys
Save me from your grace please unholy mother

Save me from the cocaine cowboys
Soldiers of the damned and their godmother
Save me from the cocaine cowboys
Save me from your grace please unholy mother

Taken all these lives it's a bad game
Still the world is crazy about the cocaine

Taken all these lives it's a bad game
Still the world is crazy about the cocaine
