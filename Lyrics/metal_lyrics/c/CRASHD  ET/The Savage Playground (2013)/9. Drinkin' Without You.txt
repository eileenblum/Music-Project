Summertime won't you come
Just like the girls you come undone
Wintertime fucking drag
You held me down
I've been dying too long

White shoreline
Young and wild
In the sun playing like a child
Skin on skin
In the sand
My favorite game
With a drink in my hand

And you wish the day could last forever
Never have to see the sun go down

Thinking about you
Drinking without you here
Staring at the wall
Dreamin' about you
I stop believing without you
I can't take this blizzard storm
In a winter without you
You're the sun that keeps me warm

Summer wind
You're the breeze
I'm fucking cold just about to freeze
Come here babe
Stay the night
Say bye to Bolan and turn off the light

And you wish the night could last forever
Never have to see the sun arise
