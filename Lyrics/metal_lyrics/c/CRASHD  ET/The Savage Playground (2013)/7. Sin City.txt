You live your life like you ain't got future
Just tanke the day as it comes
You had a vision but then you just lost it
Now you're just regular scum

You spendin' your time just foolin' around
Make a fucking mess
Of the kids in the town
You have a fate that you can escape
But you just hide in your hate

You go down to Sin City
Drown in Sin City
Drink yourself pretty
While you're singing a song
Hide in Sin City
You'll die in Sin City
You're just the carpet
But think you own the town

You have a wife but you swapped her face
And bought her tits to embrace
You spend your money on things to abuse
And sometimes buy her new shoes

You think that you live
The American dream
But you're walkin' over corpses
You smile as they scream
You breed fear with superior wine
You are the ass of all human kind

You go down to Sin City
Drown in Sin City
Drink yourself pretty
While you're singing a song
Hide in Sin City
You'll die in Sin City
You're just the carpet
But think you own the town

You go down down down
Take a look around you
This ain't fucking saturday
Down down down
You eat shit around you
Then you bite the big cake
