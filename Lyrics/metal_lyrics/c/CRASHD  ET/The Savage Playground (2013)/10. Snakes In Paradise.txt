Here I am
Alive but dead inside
With this lie
They tear me down
Then lift me up

I'm here
God damn
Watching time turn with the sand
Silent god
By your wounds they make me stand

Wake me up drag me out
Brake the chains that hold me bound
This sad illusion is the cause of this cry
In this wasted paradise

There's a snake in paradise
There are snakes in paradise
Don't go waisting all your life
There are snakes in paradise

Hear me wind
Adrift I stand in sin
Lion's den
When I fell you took me in

There's a snake in paradise
There are snakes in paradise
Don't go waisting all your life
There are snakes in paradise

Wake them up drag them out
Break the chains that hold them bound
The sad illusion is the cause of their cry
In this wasted paradise
