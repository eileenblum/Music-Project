Sleepless night in purgatory
Feel the serpent next to thee
Sink into the deep unknown
Far away but I am home
Luring demons in my bed
Stay with me till I am fed
Wake up from reality
Bind my soul in extacy

Hell is open mine to pay
But I will wait another day
I live I breath
In the garden of Babylon
This is my reality
The only place I want to be
I live I breath
In the garden of Babylon

I feel undead but hear thee talking
Through the shadows I am walking
A veil of sin covers your face
Within your womb I find my space
Affirmation comes from thrust
Deep emotion burning lust
This is where I want to be
Hide me from reality

You took my silence and made it roar
Inside that violence I taste the core

This is my temple of doom
The snakepit of its mother's womb
Testing the skin against their naked teeth
Digesting venom but never to defeat

Hell is open time to play
I won't waist another day
I live I breath
In the garden of Babylon
This is my reality
The only place I want to be
I live I breath
In the garden of Babylon
