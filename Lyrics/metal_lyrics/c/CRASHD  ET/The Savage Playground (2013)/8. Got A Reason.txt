I got a reason to get high
You got no reason to not
It's a circle you can escape
But you don't know why
Got no real big picture
You do just what you got
Don't need no fucking lecture
Don't need no alibi

Tonight's the night
We gonna lit it up take it down
We gonna make it alright
Tonight's the night
We gonna line it up pass it round
It's gonna be just fine

Set your body deep in trance
Set your soul on fire
A never ending dark romance
Can we get much higher
This site is turning vicious
Eyes are open wide
If life is so damn precious
Why am I not afraid to die
