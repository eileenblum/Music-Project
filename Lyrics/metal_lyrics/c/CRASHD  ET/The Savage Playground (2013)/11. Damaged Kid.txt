Daddy's running up the stair
Fear is screaming in her ears
She runs aside
And hides away her tears
Time will make her hard as hell
She hides behind her violent shell
Is she good or bad I really couldn't tell

Don't wait up
She ain't coming home

She's a little damaged kid
Who thinks she's not worth shit
Now she's fighting to survive
Raging through the night
Standing in the light
She's feeling sick but gets her kicks
In exchange for man's desire

Daddy was afraid of her
Though she was a little girl
Didn't know how to reach
Inside her world
Left alone she looked for toys
And ended up with all these boys
She feels as though
She got no other choice

Don't wait up
She ain't coming home

She's a little damaged kid
She thinks she's not worth shit
She's fighting to survive
Raging through the night
Standing in the light
She's feeling sick but gets her kicks
In exchange for man's desire
