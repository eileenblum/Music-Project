Awake at dawn I lay in my bed
All these memories
Cut through my head
The nights dissolving blanket
Hides the beast of day
Why does it always end up like this
Empty bottles broken fists
Like my hunger rapes me
Leaves me in a mess

It's like a violent notion
Can you feel the commotion

Another night in California
I see her dance but I think about you
One night in California

At day the beast is raging inside
It rips me open
Clouds my sight
Like a zombie hunting
I seek out the flesh

It's like a violent ocean
Can you feel the commotion

Another night in California
I see her dance but I think about you
One night in California

You had me all along girl
You marked me deep inside
I wasted all we had girl
Now I rage into the night

It's surreal
You should know
So unreal
That you are gone
