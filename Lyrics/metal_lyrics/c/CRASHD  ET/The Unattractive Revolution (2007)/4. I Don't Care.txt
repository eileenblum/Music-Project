Play with lives tonite
Shallow men waiting in the line
They could break my neck
To bury that sweet ass of mine

I'm telling the truth
So listen to me
Messin with me is to piss in the wind
I don't give a shit
Cause you ain't got a clue
I've been sitting on a bomb, but it isnt for you

Some people like me
Some love to hate me
That's built inside me
Too hot's enough

You can try to put me down
And I won't care
Anyplace, anyhow
Cause I don't care
You can try to force me down
And I won't care
You can't beat me anyway

Don't waaaaaaaste your hate on me
I won't point it right back on you
Saaaaave it for someone
Whose got an iq like you

I'm telling the truth
So listen to me
Messin with me is to piss in the wind
I don't give a shit
Cause you ain't got a clue
I've loaded my guns and I use it one you

Some people like me
Some love to hate me
Don't really take much
Too hot's enough

You can try to put me down
And I won't care
Anyplace, anyhow
Cause I don't care
You can try to force me down
And I won't care
You can't beat me anyway

Anyway

You can try to put me down
And I won't care
Anyplace, anyhow
Cause I don't care
You can try to force me down
And I won't care
You can't beat me anyway
