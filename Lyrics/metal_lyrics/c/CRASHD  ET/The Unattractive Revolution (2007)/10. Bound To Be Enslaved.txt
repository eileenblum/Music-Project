What a messA phsyco nest in my brainNuthin' like it Get my kixFlushin life down the drainNever fake it Write it down, mark my words, when I sayI am resurrected by a shotgunPermantly in chainz I wake up and take a new shot of fuelYet a day has been savedTo live is to die for the golden ruleI'm bound to be enslaved I wake up and take a new shot of fuelYet a day has been savedTo live is to die for the golden ruleI'm bound to be enslaved
