She's an angel working the back streetsWith the addict and the deadbeatsJust another hopeless teenage tradgey Sell it all to a perfect strangerAll the tricks have begun to change herDaddy's girl has become someone else's fantasy Ooh you see it in her eyesOoh the way she tells her lies Taste of falling rainTears of shame, falling rainTaste of falling rainRefuse to see the endTaste of falling rainLeaves a stain, falling rain She's a midnight company providerAll the johns wait in line to try herAt the end of the rainbow there's no gold Cause they're all just drunk with powerThey can rent her by the hourIt's her only shelter from the cold Ooh you see it in her eyesOoh the way she tells her lies Taste of falling rainTears of shame, falling rainTaste of falling rainRefuse to see the endTaste of falling rainYears she can't replace She's so far away Taste of falling rainTaste of falling rainShe's so far awayTaste of falling rainFalling rainTaste of falling rain
