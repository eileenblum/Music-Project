The same old chase in between the seasonsTo live yer life like there is no reasonSome say it never makes senseBut you'll find the truth my friend It doesn't matter if you are religiousIt don't matter if yer superstitiousSome day it all will make senseWhen you drown in destiny's lake Some people can't take the truthNo wonder they ain't feeling satisfied OvernightYour life could turn aroundYou ain't the same anymoreSay goodbyeTo the life that you have knownYou ain't the same anymore It doesn't matter if you're bound to make itIt don't matter if you try to fake itSome say it never will endThen you finally come across fate Some people like to bury it allAnd the pain remains inside OvernightYour life could turn aroundYou ain't the same anymoreSay goodbyeTo the life that you have knownYou ain't the same anymore OvernightYour life could turn aroundYou ain't the same anymoreSay goodbyeTo the life that you have knownYou ain't the same anymore You might wake up one dayAnd nuthin' seems to be the sameIf you're lost yer own wayThen it's nice to blame it one fat OvernightYour life could turn aroundYou ain't the same anymoreSay goodbyeTo the life that you have knownYou ain't the same anymore
