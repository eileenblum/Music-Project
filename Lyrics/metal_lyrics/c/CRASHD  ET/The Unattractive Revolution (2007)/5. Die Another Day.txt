Here we comeDrop the bombAnother shot from the riot gung Crashing downWith the soundDemolition of the final round Die another day, heyBetter aliveHere's a vision that's stronger then thou Die another day, heyLiving the nightWe're not here, to turn back time I bet you're gonna fall apartOnce you've seen my work of artDon't let the moment pass you by Die another dayGet you blown awayDie another dayGet you blown away Aiming highFrom belowStill we got a long way to go Comes aliveVicious smileRaising hell with a reckless child Die another day, heySaluting the slainHere we stay and to stick with the nameDay another day, heyFeeding the wildIt ain't over til' the last one dies I bet you're gonna fall apartOnce you've seen my work of artDon't let the moment pass you by Die another dayGet you blown awayDie another dayGet you blown awayHey, It's a brand new day Die another dayGet you blown awayDie another dayGet you blown away Die another dayGet you blown awayHey, it's a brand new dayDie another dayDie another day
