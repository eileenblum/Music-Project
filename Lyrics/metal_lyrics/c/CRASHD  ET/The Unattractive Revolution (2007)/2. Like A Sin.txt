Sweet talkin' jiveStill lookin' fineShe's got the reputation catcher of your eye Secrets alignBehind her smileEvening arivesReveals her crimes Watch yer toungeMakes you wanna cryAlone she is not that shy Like a sin she comes aliveShe begins to draw the lineFrom within the takes you downLike a storm wind sweeping by She is one of fewA bit too rudeThe fatal tragedy calling out on you Sense of my voiceHer toxic toyzThat's all she wearsHer lust for nightmares Watch yer toungeMakes you wanna cryAlone she is not that shy Like a sin she comes aliveShe begins to draw the lineFrom within the takes you downLike a storm wind sweeping by Sinner she's gone wildSinner she makes you smile Like a sin she comes aliveShe begins to draw the lineFrom within the takes you downLike a storm wind sweeping by
