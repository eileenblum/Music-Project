Like a black cat whining in the alley Like a pet locked up in a cage I see you strip right down to your toe nail Feel the rush flowin' rabid in my veins  Feel the customs doing you a srip search Like a vet i'm giving you the cure Feel the power coming from my hip lurch Is she the same fuck that i did before  SEX SHOCK  In the raw tonite With your face down to the floor You're my nakedness sensation from your waist but i want more Then i shake you to the core When you're caught in the raw  Get your hand cuffs ready for a good time Beat your whip my tan is turning blue Fascination twister of the fine line I become you notorious taboo  Take it off and get down My god it's like my head's burnin' up My mind's so dirty Get it on,on and on Ooh, your're my sin ful side  SEX SHOCK  In the raw tonite With your face down to the floor You're my nakedness sensation from your waist but i want more Then i shake you to the core When you're caught in the raw
