Cheating death burning down the hillAdd a twist stepping on the steelFeel the noize leaving my brainI'm in the eye of a hurricane Cheating death in a red machineI leave a fat trace of gasolineMy motorbitch building up the speedGot no cops chasing after me Thrill meDon't kill meGot a life and it's going downhillThrill meDon't kill meNeed a crash if you wanna catch me Cheating death spinning of a curveHad dream that I'll crash n' burnIt could be my better turn (in the)Final test if I got the nerve Thrill meDon't kill meGot a life and it's going downhillThrill meDon't kill meNeed a crash if you wanna catch me You can't get a better vibeThan a roller coaster ride Thrill meDon't kill meGot a life and it's going downhillThrill meDon't kill meNeed a crash if you wanna catch me
