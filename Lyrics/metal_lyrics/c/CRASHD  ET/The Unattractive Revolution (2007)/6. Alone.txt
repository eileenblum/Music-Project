Pickin' up the phoneAin't an option nowI wanna use the gun tonite Lyin' on the bedBeggin for the blowFeelin' kinda deadAching to the bone Breathing down yer spineIn a darkened roomI wanna take my timeBut it's heading out of line Craving for your touchThat's gonna bring me downLike a kiss of deathI just can't turn away I can be the one aloneI can be the one aloneI can be your own alone Don't you kill the lightLet's keep the dark awayI wanna see those eyesTonite I can take my lifeAnd give it all to youI'd even do it twiceAll alone for you I can be the one aloneI can be the one aloneI can be the one alone I can be the one aloneI can be the one aloneI can be your own alone
