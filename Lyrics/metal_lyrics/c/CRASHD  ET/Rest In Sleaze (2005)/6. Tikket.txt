I can't stand be in the spotlight
Don't like it I never have
The mirror reflecting the street light
In the gutter that's where I am
Trippin' up and down with chemical enlightenment
Heading high gettin' off some load
To be found in a primal state of brightment, wander 'round
Crashin' off the blow

Oh oh gotta high speed tikket
Oh oh on this carousel
Oh oh this is so damn wikked
Oh oh live in heaven n' hell

Is this the chart of my illusion
Or is this just the way to be
Is this the heart of my confusion
Or is this just the tikket to me

The vigour of another, won't give me the energy
To feel the lust I don't feel, a straight line of evil synergy
Good morning to ya snakebit and to all ya powder kegs of snow
I'm a transparent fish in a barrel, I feel the shakes, but it doesn't show

I rather don't know anymore
I might be gettin' low

Is this the chart of my illusion
Or is this just the way to be
Is this the heart of my confusion
Or is this just the tikket to me

Is this the way I am supposed to
Fell the things that you sellin' me
Is this delight part of confusion
Or is this just the tikket to me
