My weak resistance, of your flower
Got me infected, cause I was to blind to see
Everyone told me, but did I listen
No I was sick'n tired of the same reply from thee

You lead the game, I followed...
You were the bait, I swallowed...

It's a miracle you walk the earth, alone
It's a miracle I stand beside you
You're like a plague in a wide'n open show
You pass it on like I need it the most

I smelled your rose'n caressed your pelats
Never bothered by the thorns that made me bleed
Cause I longed to feel you so deep inside me
But now I'm stukk with you forever without remedy

You lead the game, I followed...
You were the bait, I swallowed...

It's a miracle you walk the earth, alone
It's a miracle I stand beside you
You're like a plague in a wide'n open show
You pass it on like I need it the most

You knew my pain...
You lead the game...
And I followed yeah I followed
Your lies, your play, you're all the same to me...

It's a miracle you walk the earth, alone
It's a miracle I stand beside you
You're like a plague in a wide'n open show
You pass it on like I need it the most

It's a miracle you walk the earth, alone
It's a miracle I stand beside you
You're like a plague in a wide'n open show
You cut me of like I need it the most

(miracle) (miracle)
It's a miracle you walk the earth, alone
It's a miracle I stand beside you
(miracle) (miracle)
You're like a plague in a wide'n open show
You cut me of like I need it the most
