The trick of turnin' bricks to gold
The lick you churn to not grow old
Let it all out n' scream it n' shout
I let you in on everythin'
You're heart desire burning on the dark side
Of your wild side

Ya got an alley cat style
You're a crazy child
You got what it takes
Gimme your smile

All is rite cause we're
Breakin' the chains, breakin' the chains
All is rite cause we're
Breakin' the chains, breakin' the chains

Livin' on the edge of night
Sukkin' love from every bite
All that we need we're in for the feed
We get from every kiss of death
Your heart expire burnin' on the dark side
You're a rotchild
