You say you don't love me
Well I don't really care about you
Cause I'm a gun turret bad boy baby
Runnin'high on the fumes

It's like a ship of destruction
Makes me cry out for more
All the friends that I know of and the boys in the crew
Oh oh oh ooh we're all the same in the core

Can you feel it, inside
We deliver, to ya mind

We're a needle in your eye
It's our way of life
Stikk a needle in your eye

I feel something growing
It's on the tip of my tongue
And I feel how it's coming now
I have to scream out my lungs

The poison runnin'within us
A never ending disease
N'the fusion that binds us got a hold of me oh oh oh ooh
From this I can't break free
