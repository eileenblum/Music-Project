The heat is rising, the time is here
The real edification
We're a million dreams, and all it's fears
That's the core of this creation

We're coming straight out of hell
We're coming straight out of hell

The bursting of the universe
The noise when worlds collide
We're the eristic prophets in this modern curse
Of time we don't confide

In the midnight hour, we rise and come alive
This is the journey of our odyssey
1,2,3,4

We're coming straight out of hell
We're coming straight out of hell
We're coming straight out of hell
We're coming straight out of hell
