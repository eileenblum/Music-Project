[Japanese version track]

don't wanna change my ways, to fit in to your pattern
Becoming a man I don't wanna be...

So I could see it coming the nite you made the turn
You tore a part my illusion...
The reckless shattering, you made my heart burn
Your strength made it to conclusion...

There is no tomorrow
In the world that I live

Everything that you said to me, I bought it...
Everything that you told me, you made me feel complete
Everything that you said to me, I got it
Everything that you told me, you made me feel complete...

There's always hard times but I can make it through
Another fiction comes to mind now...
A new sun is shining I wonder will it do
And give me all the things I want to have...

Maybe there's a tomorrow
In the world that I live

You feed upon my affection and the space of my heart
Now I'm never on the burning, somehow I made it through the learning
Let there be another day

There is a tomorrow
In the world that I live
