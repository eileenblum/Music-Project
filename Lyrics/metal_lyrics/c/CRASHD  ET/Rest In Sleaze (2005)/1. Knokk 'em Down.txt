When they put you to the test
That's meant for you to fail
You've been stukk oh god for ages...
Eventually you see the light
They made you struggle for and
Oh oh oh, yeah yeah yeah
They break you down with...

There ain't no playing
Just working all day
So believe me when I say this...

They line you up, they knock you down
You're forced to feed 'em day n' night
Now is that how you want it... NO!!!
What ya gonna do about it...

Well line 'em up and knock 'em down
Cause you got balls and that's no crime
If you really don't like it
Just show 'em you strike it back

The boss is screamin' shapen
Up and do your fukkin' job
You're such a mess oh god you're wasted...
Until you straight the flush
You'll be standing next in line
Oh oh oh, no no no,
You can't take that...
