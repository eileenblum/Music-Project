I'm just a boy with a gun in my hand*
I tried to talk to people but the don't understand

I've read the papers I've seen the news
And I just don't know which road to choose

I can't stop life bringing me down
So i get up on the table and shout it out

I am a rebel, I am a rebel without a cause
Rebel without law, a rebel

I've been to school yeah, I've learned the blues
But that's about all that I could use

I can't stop to mess around
Cause I just don't fit with what's around

We can't help life is bringing us down
So get up on that table and shout it out

I am a rebel, I am a rebel without a cause
Rebel without law, I am a rebel, rebel
Get your paws out I'm ready to score
A devil is at your door, rebel

Is this shit life all you can get
Locked up in a cage like some fucking pet
Get up on the roof tops break down the doors
Scream I'm tired of living like a fucking whore

Rebel
