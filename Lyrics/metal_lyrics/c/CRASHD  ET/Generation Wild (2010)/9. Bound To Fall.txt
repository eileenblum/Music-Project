Livin' out in the streets,
Somebody in town,
Two hearts had to meet while I'm goin' down,
A little girl hiding from the city lights,
He's just a boy on struggle out tonight,
Trying hard to survive in a damaged world,
Living lonley for screwing up without her
Getting high, messing up another dream,
I wonder why
It's never ever as it seems,
She wanna love but it let her down,
And nobody's gonna turn it around,
Rise up,
Only love will let you fall down,
You gotta take it on,
Rise up, the world is spinnin' faster,
You're falling for love but you bound to fall,
Now the dues are done,
And who owe is you,
But he still in the dark, a lonely hoar,
This little girl, cryin' on the frozen night,
And he's back on the streets out to fight,
She wanna love but it let her down,
And nobody's gonna turn it around,
Rise up,
Only love will let you fall down,
You gotta take it on,
Rise up, the world is spinnin' faster,
You're falling for love but you bound to fall,
You know love is like poison,
Still you take it on, you're heading for disaster,
You're falling for love but you bound to fall
Rise up,
Only love will let you fall down,
You gotta take it on,
Rise up, the world is spinnin' faster,
You're falling for love but you bound to fall,
Rise up,
Fall down,
You gonna take it on,
Rise up... the world is spinnin' faster,
Bound to fall.
