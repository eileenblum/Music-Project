I was born under atraction skies,
I silenced tattoo my eyes,
I was held down in water n' blood be came higher inside,
I was told under murder as lies,
They could bury on the flame in my eyes,
With the fist full of hard, pounding the war,
I stood all their face with the fire,
You can't deny now, i've gonna too far,
You can't deny now, to one revelation now the hell
will comes out,
This is my armageddon, armageddon,
This is my armageddon, armageddon,
The sun will come shine on you,
My blood will be harmed really soon,
The lives that go by, as one can't lie,
We waste all destruction inside,
You can't deny now, deny now,
I've gonna too far, too far,
You can't deny now, to one revelation now the hell
will comes out,
This is my armageddon, armageddon,
This is my armageddon, armageddon,
N' i don't know just what to do about it,
I guess i've change but i still bleeds the same,
This is my armageddon, armageddon,
This is my armageddon, armageddon,
Yeah!
This is my armageddon, armageddon,
This is my armageddon, armageddon,
This is my armageddon, armageddon,
Yeeeaaahhh-aaahhh!
