Ohhh-ahhh!
Ohhh-ahhh!
At the midnight, out for blood,
Let's make a big toast, for world domination,
No rest, out to be barred in to the ditch now, with my newly convicted,
I'm on my way, never awake in the light of day,
I'm on my way, in the dark let's pray,
I'm alive, when the night falls on, all the city lights, so
So alive, i'm out of control, that it's feels alright,
So alive...
Tick, tock,
I watch the clock for my injection of abomination,
Wake up, comin' with your little sweet light, well a
jealousy state your liar,
I'm on my way, never awake in the light of day,
I'm on my way, in the dark let's pray,
I'm alive, when the night falls on, all the city lights, so
So alive, i'm out of control that it's feels alright,
Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh,
Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh,
Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh,
Ahhh-ahhh,
Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh-ahhh,
I'm alive, when the night falls on, all the city lights, so
So alive, i'm out of control that it's feels alright,
Ahhh,
So alive,
Ahhh-ahhh,
Night city, night city lights,
So alive,
I'm out of control that it's feels alright,
So alive,
So alive,
So alive,
So alive,
So alive,
So alive,
So alive...
