Blood and tears, flowing from her darkest fears.
She cries for help but no one hears, takes a pill to make it disappear.

I canât save her, because thereâs nobody home.
I canât change her, cuz sheâs too far gone
And my heart breaks cuz I couldnât reach her.
No one can save her now, save her now.
No one can save her now

Sheâs lying on the bathroom floor. Doors locked and no one knows.
Cuts bleed from her life before. Time heals but the scars still show.

I canât save her, because thereâs nobody home.
I canât change her, cuz sheâs too far gone
And my heart breaks cuz I couldnât reach her.
No one can save her now, save her now.
No one can save her now

No one can save her now, no one can save her
No one can save her now

All that come with fear, screaming in her ears, voices are so near. (No one can save her)
Torn from inside, demons posses her mind, blood and tears collide. (No one can save her now)

She comes undone, dead end, nowhere to run.
Sweet lip around a loaded gun pulls the trigger and the bullet won.

(Save her, Change her)
And my heart breaks cuz I couldnât reach her.
Save her now, save her now.
Ooooh
No one can save her
No one can save her now
