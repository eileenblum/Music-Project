When I was a little boy
I didn't know what's right or wrong
I had to change my way of life
But I just couldn't win the fight
I'd let myself float off in time and hide
Another day another night
I lived off dreams I thought was right
But I couldn't stand being treated like
I was the only without rights
Stood there screamin at your vice and cried
The way you loved me
Is not always what we call love
Waiting now
Beautiful pain [4x]
Beautiful
In the dirt and in my soil
They said they planted seeds of joy
I was unholy, born in sin
So they fed me words of lead within
Then I looked down on myself in shame
Left with the blame
The way you loved me
Is not always what we call love
Waiting now
Beautiful pain [5x]
Mother, father listen up
I know these times were kind of rough
We waited for the leaders hand
To guide our lives, it's kind of sad
And you just did what you thought was right
'n I cried
Beautiful pain
