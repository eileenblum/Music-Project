Let me tell you about a story,
Guess you've heard it all before,
Set in every beatin' heart,
N' on twisted minds decor,
From the screamin' in my ears,
Down to the shivers through my spine,
Feel the burnin' of illusions,
With no other place to hide,
I need you, i fear you, n' bound me tonight,
Don't leave me, deceive me, just tell me it's right,
Down with the dust,
Ohhh, down with the, dust,
Another round of paranoia,
All i've got is this bleeding shame,
Try to talk under fobia, but who cares, it's all the same,
But know i'm hiddin' emotions, staring wild through the haze,
If you see me down the alley, listen up n' hear me say,
I need you, i fear you, n' bound me tonight,
Don't leave me, deceive me, just tell me it's right,
Down with the dust,
Ohhh, down with the, dust,
Dust, dust,
Ahhh, down with the, dust,
You goin' down, down with the, dust,
You down, down with the, dust,
Dooowwwnnn...
