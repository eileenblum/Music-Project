Lights out waiting for the midnight call
Times loud, shadow's dancing on the wall
No round, rising from the underground (underground)
It's all alive, the father comes back for more (for more)

[Chorus (x2):]
Children of the night
Soldiers of of time
Screaming out loud

One generation

Riot in the streets
Fighting in debris
Raise your fist high

The generation wild

One night, of shadow dances broken bowns
Not cure, to medicate his restless soul
We're all around, revolutions at your door

(So break out) Break out, and celebrate (once more)

[Chorus (x2)]

[Solo]

Night comes, we're back against the wall
Time run, we haven't changed at all
But we survive, feets awaiting in the dawn

We're breaking down our fear and our shadows screamin' on the wall
Nothings gonna hold us down waiting for the midnight call

[Chorus (x2):]
Children of the night
Soldiers out of time
Screamin out loud

One generation

Riot in the streets
[?]
Born to die free, one generation

The generation wild
