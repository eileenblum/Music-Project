Awww... heeeyyyehhhahhh...
Sittin' on the bed,
Around not but numb,
I'm out for trouble, just to hold in the spoon,
Fuck it for reckless, i'm the same for a year,
This walls will count calls, cuz' i'm outta here,
Trippin' on the slave about to locked up the door,
I think i sludge down the yesterday off,
Back out loud to your mother's backstreet,
My head is fuckin' tired need to get some heat,
Rollin' downtown, n' meetin' up the crowd,
The wheel spinnin' out,
Screamin' it out loud,
My head stay still is up down to care,
I know is goin' down again, i know is goin' down again,
What is gonna do with you,
To mad about a bad behavior,
What is gonna do with you,
From crawlin' like a alligator,
Native nature!
Heals upon my head, i've forgot my shoes,
I'm gettin' older n' it's not on the news,
Talkin' on the phone gotta hook up the mob,
Weakening like a motherfucker agonizing,
What is gonna do, i will get it out of you,
Gonna for the party, everygot on the blues,
Trippin' down high, crawlin' down low,
Wheels will keep spinnin' till' i'm outta control,
Rollin' downtown, n' meetin' up the crowd,
The wheel spinnin' out,
Screamin' it out loud,
My head stay still is up down to care,
I know is goin' down again, we know is goin' down again,
What is gonna do with you,
To mad about a bad behavior,
What is gonna do with you,
From crawlin' like a alligator,
Native nature!
Rollin' downtown, n' meetin' up the crowd,
The wheel spinnin' out,
Screamin' it out loud,
My head stay still is up down to care,
I know is goin' down again...
I'm down on my face,
Why did you call the disgrace,
Just a human race, is my, my native nature!
What is gonna do with you,
To mad about a bad behavior,
What is gonna with you,
From crawlin' like a alligator,
Native nature!
What is gonna do with you,
Native nature!
To mad about a bad behavior,
Native nature!
What is to be in you,
To know is just a native nature, native nature!
