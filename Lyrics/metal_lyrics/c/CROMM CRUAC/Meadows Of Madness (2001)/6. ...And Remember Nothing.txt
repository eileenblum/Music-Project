As we sit by this fire
And reminisce good old times
I cannot stop laughing
As Oisin and his rhymes

We were feared by those who crossed our path

Felt like gods, brought death and devoured lives

Unprepaired and slaughtered in ways beyond disbelief

Didn't care, just one to achieve, just survive!!

As we sit by this fire
And reminisce good old times
I cannot stop thinking
Of the men we left behind

We were buried in the earth
Up to our waist, with just with a shield
Chased by men we then all feared
Just fought for what we were worth

The Twelve Books of Poetry
A way of life, became to me
We were anxious to become
A servant of the High King's Throne

As we sit by this fire
And reminisce good old times
I cannot stop feeling
All the pain I have inside

Oh yeas, I'm trying to believe
That there's a better way to be
Without the slaughtering of men
Without grief of what we ever lost

But everything, it seems so right
To ride with comrades and to fight
Past years have brought so much for me
Both victory and misery

There's not a single night I sleep
Without awakening from my dreams
Trying to ensure myself
And fall back into reality

No more memories I have
Of life as I knew it once before
Not shedding blood nor wasting men
No memories, no more

I can't wake up
From this dream, so it seems to me
I want to awake
And leave this terror all behind of me

All numb and blind
Barely able to retrieve myself
Not even now
I can't remember when I ever did

As we sit by this fire
And reminisce good old times
I cannot stop thinking
Of the men we left behind
