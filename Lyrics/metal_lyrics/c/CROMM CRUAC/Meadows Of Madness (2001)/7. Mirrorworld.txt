Visions, dreams of drifting, soulless
In a dimension, without the loss of time
Just one step, and I'll be ready
To find out what I'm looking for

I have fear
Of what's
Behind

Immortal, obsessed with nature's anger
To overcome it, the goal of my intent
Nothing can stop me from achieving
There's no way back now, this is the end

I have fear
Of what's
Behind
The door

Fear takes over faith
Now it's too late!
Unknown destination
Twisted imagination

Looking, just to se reflections
Of a scared man, not sure of what to do
Just one way of ending my redemptions
Just one step, and I'll see if it's the truth
Shaking, hesitate to go now
Not knowing what's on the other side
Taking one last deep breath
Close my eyes, prepare to glide

The portal to this new dimension
Is right before me, just one big step away
To go through means leaving right behind me
The confident world as I have known

Not knowing what I might encounter
On my way through, but I will take that chance
Believing that making this decision
Will complete the quest for my true self

Fear takes over faith
