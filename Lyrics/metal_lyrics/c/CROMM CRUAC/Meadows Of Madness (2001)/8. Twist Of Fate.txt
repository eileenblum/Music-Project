World of misery
Chaos all around
Men killing men
No solutions can be found

Bound to become
An unliveable place
No flora, fauna, nature
Or even our own human race

This tendency I think
Can't possibly be stopped
One way or another
This world is left to rot

The only safe place
On this planet to be
With harmony and peace
Is beneath the level of the sea

All kinds of fish, peacefully swimming by
Not in a way abusing nature's gift
No religion's going to divide them into groups
No hatred exists over colour of their skin

Just one way for mankind to survive this kell to be

An now my mind is set
I am going under
Or else I'm going insane

Constructing for over ten years
And now my plan's realised
A new world under the sea
No hatred, just peace, harmony

Instead of watching, doing nothing
Let this world decay
I will twist the fate

Follow me to the new paradise follow me

Last security measure
Are 12 atomic bombs
To stop them from destroying
My re-creation of paradise
