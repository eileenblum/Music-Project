As she was combing her long hair
The pale gray sky turned gold
She captured every ray of light that fell on my eyes
I felt like never before

So now I know
That sometimes dreams
Do come true
Just belive
There is a way
Of getting what you want
Dreams come true
Just believe

That one night
I took her skin
She was mine
Could not escape
Years went by
Nothing changed
The way I saw it
She belonged to me

The only way for her to return
To once again dwell in her domain
Our offspring needs to find her skin
So she can roam the sea once again

I know that one day I'll wake up
And find her not next to me
That day will come
But it doesn't matter much to me

The shifting of their shape, so powerful
To trick us fulfilling their dreams
Powerless unless they once transform
One weakness I than used, she was forlorn

The only way for her to roam her world
Is safely by me, her skin
Skin
