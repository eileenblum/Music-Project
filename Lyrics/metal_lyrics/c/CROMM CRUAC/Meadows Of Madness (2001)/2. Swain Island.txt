Take a look around you
I see it every day
People running and screaming
To have it their own way

It's time to stop this madness
Take one step back
Life is just a preparation
Of death to come

Just take one step back
And open your eyes
To see what really is going on

Don't make you lose yourself in this world
Try to see the importance
Of the unseeen

Status, money, and cars won't do you
Any good as you might
Learn at the end of this trip

Don't waste your energy on resolving
The things that really
Don't matter at all

Away
We're drifting
From our means to
Be alive

We are
Loosing sight of
The big picture
Who we are

I cannot
Understand why
You don't see it
As I do

Realise this game you're plaing
Can't be played but once

Realise this life you're living
Is your only chance
