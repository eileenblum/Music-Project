My sight now is gone
It turned black
The stone so blue came
And it gave me one back

Some call it a gift
Of the second sight
I feel like I'm cursed
With this second sight

The visions so clear
In my head
The day I became a Seer
That, I'd like to forget! Fast

The future, for no-one, never to see
I question myself "is it worth to believe?"
My heart is still aching, of pain an relief
Now that they know I can never be free!

Dreaming of life as it treated me well
I feel like I'm cursed, cursed with this gift
Able to see the misfortune of men
But death just awaits me if I told of them

Fighting inside my head as I try
To decide who to tell or not to tell at all

And now I'm waiting to be freed
Of all dilemmas, as they breed
I know I never will be
The constant knowing burns my mind

Ablazing
To abnegate me as I try
Serving people who then want me
Persecuted and then to die
