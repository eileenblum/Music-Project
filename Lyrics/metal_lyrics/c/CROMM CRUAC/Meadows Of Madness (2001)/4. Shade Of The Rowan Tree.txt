As he sat there in the shade
He felt that nothing more could harm him
The branches like a mother's arm did
Protect him from this pain
Now creating his own private world and
Sinking deep away
A smile then appearing on him
Thinking, he was save

The he felt this sudden breeze
Which pulled him back into his reality
Heart stopped, he couldn't breathe
Eyes staring, nothing there
Running, just as fast as he could go
Not looking back
Wind crying, creaming out his name
And attacking all again

The Shade of the Rowan Tree was his way back
The branches of the old and sacred did protect him
The only door that made him live again

Looking back onto the trail
Seeing this was not a dream, experience
Silent screams
His tower of hope collapsed
Knowing this is the only way

He wants to be
A part of this world
Never go back
Just play this game again

He realises this is the last
Train that can bring him back
But then his urge to stay right here
Conquers fear, he closes his eyes
