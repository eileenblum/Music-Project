[Music by Vlad Invictus &amp; Goran GarÄeviÄ; lyrics by Vlad Invictus]

Hear the call of desperate heart
How I long for your breath
Itâs the tale of the dying soul, of love
Love stronger than death

All of my life I waited for
A part was missing in my being
The sign of mistery appeared
On the sails of agony

Then I saw myself in your eyes
From the past I know your pain
The gift of blood Iâm offering to you
Take my innocence away

Sin of my life
My endless dream
We are as one
Eternally

Now I fear the hour has come
When truth will break my wings
The parting words of love are all I hear
May the heaven bring you peace

Sin of my life
My endless dream
We are as one
Eternally
