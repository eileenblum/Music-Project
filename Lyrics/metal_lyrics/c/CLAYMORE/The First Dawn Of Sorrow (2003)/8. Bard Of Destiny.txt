[Part I: The First Dawn of Sorrow]

Take my hand and follow me
Iâll show you a better place
Let me build a wall around your mind
Let me fill your heart with blocks of ice

Inhale the earth from my grave and you will know the truth
Let me close your eyes, not to see the lies
Promised land awaits you on the other side

[Part II: The Dawn of Ice]

In these halls of snow
there is no comfort from the pain
I know the one youâre seeking
is still so far from here

Is this your world of illusion?
To run from the reality
you must know now
that it is time for you to sleep

Fallen child dreams of peace
afraid of light, blinded by dark

Holy child dreams no more
Deceived by light, embrace the dark

[Part III: The Return to the Dawn of Light]

Surrender yourself to me and conquer the world within
Fill your soul with hope, crush the fear inside

Faith in me will save you from the evil in this world
Now you watch with my eyes and you feel no shame
Day will come for you, when you will realize
Sorrow remains in the past, forever with your dreams
