[Music &amp; lyrics by Vlad Invictus]

In the depths of silence my consciousness is lying
As the fear opens its door and watching at its prey

In the place where all things are
not what they seem to be
The horror lies between these walls
In darkness itâs conceived

I search for myself
I scream out in sleep
Shadows hide their secrets
buried somewhere deep

The sands of time are running fast I feel
The hourâs near to face the unknown
Beyond the wall of sleep

I hear the song in dream, as it calls them to the feast
The expectations were to low, forsaken souls begin their hunt

A single sigh of madness
fulfils my destiny
Darkness now covers my sight
All I hear is my own scream

I search for myself
I scream out in sleep
Shadows hide their secrets
buried somewhere deep

The sands of time are running fast I feel
The hourâs near to face the unknown
Beyond the wall of sleep
