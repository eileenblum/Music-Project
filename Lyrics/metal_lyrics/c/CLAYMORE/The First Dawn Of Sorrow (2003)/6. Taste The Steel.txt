[Music by Vlad Invictus &amp; Goran GarÄeviÄ; lyrics by Vlad Invictus]

From the sky I see the light
Messenger of mystic signs
Down below druids of stone
gathered in circle
Time has come to open your eyes
And see the things I canât describe
The day of wrath, the end of all days
when darkness prevails

Born from the lake of emerald fire
Elven sword forged in the light

By the sword and by the oath
of blood of our master
I am the one who wields it so brave
the keeper of this holy ground
Swear to keep and protect these realms
from the evil entities
I take the sword and sink it in lake
to unbound its power

Oh, fireâs burning the edges of steel
quench the blade with this holy blood

Taste the steel
Born in fire
Power unleashed
from magical sword
Taste the steel
burn in fire
Die in your hell
from which you were born

By the light of the moon
By the power of night
I will ride with my steel
Into glorious fight
I will answer my call
Iâll be damned if I fall
Iâll give freedom again
To this beautiful land

So come mighty warrior
and fulfill your fate
Deliver the people
from anguish and hate
Iâll grant thee thy wings
The destinyâs eyes
the shield of creation
and this ring of light

Taste the steel
Born in fire
Power unleashed
from magical sword
Taste the steel
burn in fire
Die in your hell
from which you were born
