[Music by Vlad Invictus &amp; Goran GarÄeviÄ; lyrics by Vlad Invictus]

Sons of darkness, crawl on your knees
Feed my sword with blood upon this field
Iâm the master Iâm the son of steel
Ignite my flames and power you shall feel

I destroy all in my way
Stand against me you will pay

High in the sky where the sun never goes
My tower will rise high above

Lord of the sky, I embrace thee
Lord of the wind, free my soul
Armies of dark, hear my last words
In the end death comes for us all

Pledge your shield of honor, bow to me
Kiss of cold steel ends this prophecy
Now in fire watch your homeland burns
Release your hatred from your heart that yearns

Blood my eyes and let me die
Vengeance will be my last cry

Your courage is great but no mercy Iâll give
Iâll be fool to let you live

Lord of the sky, I embrace thee
Lord of the wind, free my soul
Armies of dark, hear my last words
In the end death comes for us all

I now face my death but I shall stand proud
Gods of fate, where are you now?

Lord of the sky, I embrace thee
Lord of the wind, free my soul
Armies of dark, hear my last words
In the end death comes for us all
