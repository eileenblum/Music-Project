[Music by Vlad Invictus &amp; Goran GarÄeviÄ; lyrics by Vlad Invictus]

My eyes have seen the birth of the thousand suns
A world of pain and fear, a world of lies
In my heart Iâve found the strength to carry on
In my mind Iâve seen the end, it has begun

Touched by the light of the angels
Iâm flying on wings of a dream

Never will I see the dawn of man
Never will I breathe the wind again
In silence cast in stone Iâll always be
Forever in eternity

The sound of doomsday bell is ringing to me
A melody of madness that I know too well
In my soul I bare the neverending pain
In my mind I pray not to see this anymore

Iâm chosen to witness this day
When none shall be the same again

Never will I see the dawn of man
Never will I breathe the wind again
In silence cast in stone Iâll always be
Forever in eternity
