[Music &amp; lyrics by Vlad Invictus]

I canât feel your hand on my skin anymore
This night is cold and so lonely
Itâs neverending pain

Iâm looking through the mirror
Iâm searching for your face
My mind is getting clearer
I know youâre gone forever

Crying in the darkness, sorrowâs overwhealming me
There is no voice to guide me, I feel that I am lost

We live in distant worlds
We live in distant worlds

If love could speak in words
it would whisper your name
Iâm not 21 anymore, this world has locked for me its doors

I know that I have hurt you
Itâs the only way to hurt myself
Iâm sorry for my existence
I wish I had never been born at all

Wherever you may go, my heart will always be there
I realized too late what you mean to me

We live in distant worlds
We live in distant worlds

Youâll never hear about me, you wonât remember my name
but Iâll be waiting for you until the end of my days

We live in distant worlds
We live in distant worlds
