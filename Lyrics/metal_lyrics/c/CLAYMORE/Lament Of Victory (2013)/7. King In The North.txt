[Music &amp; lyrics by Vlad Invictus]

Hear the sound of the warriorsâ steel
Clash of swords screaming over the hills
Hear the call of the forsaken gods
Raging fury unleashed from the dark

in this battle where no one will win
Wrathful vengeance and hatred within
in the hearts of the men who would die
on this field where the earth meets the sky

To those who have fallen
I raise my sword
The oath has been spoken
King in the North

I have witnessed this tragical day
I have seen it in eyes of the slain
I have carried my pain much too far
I have listened the words in my mind

Time enough for the earth in the grave
World is small in the hearts of the brave
Chains of violence are spreading the sound
Blood will flow on this burial ground

To those who have fallen
I raise my sword
The oath has been spoken
King in the North
