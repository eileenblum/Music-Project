[Music by Vlad Invictus &amp; Goran GarÄeviÄ; lyrics by Vlad Invictus]

I raise my sword now and call the God of the sunlight
to ease my soul from the dark I hold deep within me
My armorâs blazing, my faith will give me the answer
am I mistaken, will your light shine once again on me?

I dreamed of freedom and days of glory forgotten
My heart was weeping for revenge that cannot die

Oh, lord almighty, grant me with strength to forgive them
to ease my soul from this pain and endless suffering

Onward to battlefield
Ten thousand sons of steel
No fear within their hearts
All pawns must play their parts

Dies irae, dies illa*
Here will be our final stand
Solvet saeclum in favilla*
Blood will soak this holy land

Lament of victory
Glory is calling me
For honor of my king
with blood I slake my steel

I see the sun reborn
New light upon the throne
To rule and to defend
This game will never end

Rex tremendae maiestatis*
Woe to those who led astray
Salva me, fons pietatis*
They will meet their judgement day

Lament of victory
Glory is calling me
For honor of my king
with blood I slake my steel

[* from Dies Irae, XIII century Latin hymn]
