[Music &amp; lyrics by Vlad Invictus]

Wind whispered silently, calling my name
Forest stood peacefully, always the same
Gods have abandoned me, time fades away
Night gathers, suddenly, stars light my way

In my dreams I saw the key to my fate
Hope will never be my friend
For life may be one, I know itâs too late
Iâll be strong until the end

There was a time when Iâd bow down and cry
Everythingâs changing beneath the night sky
Moonless, enchanting, no shadows to cast
Iâm of the night now, forsaking the past

In my dreams I saw the source of my fears
Now in darkness we are one
For my sins I tried to reach for the sun
but it all now disappears

Night sky, cover me
Take me on your wings
Iâm forever free to guide my destiny
