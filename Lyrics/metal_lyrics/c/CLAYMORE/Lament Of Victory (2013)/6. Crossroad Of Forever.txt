[Music &amp; lyrics by Vlad Invictus]

Dream of winter, broken promise
Though itâs been so long, I cannot pretend anymore
Time brings changes, memoryâs fading
on a love that was worth fighting for

Iâm still searching for those lost days
After all these years, fear has returned to my soul
Child of silence, dreaming one day
you will stay with me to guide me over the wall

If the look in your eyes can tell me
after the rain that was in our hearts
will the rainbow start to rise?
With the look in your eyes around me
I will never be lost you could find me
before this life turns to dust

Iâm still trying, Iâm still counting
on a love that has no understanding for me
Iâll keep trying, Iâll keep fighting
for your love thatâs not worth fighting for

If the look in your eyes can tell me
after the storm that raged in our hearts
will the sun begin to shine?
Is forever a long time to wait
on a crossroad thatâs beside me
will we meet somewhere again?
