[Music by Vlad Invictus &amp; Goran GarÄeviÄ; lyrics by Vlad Invictus]

Riding to the crimson sunset in the land of no return
Faith in my heart gives me strength to carry on and on
In this wasteland of the shadow, fear keeps knocking on my door
Filled with power, now I must be strong

From the ashes I am rising
Reaching for eternity

Feel the vengeance on my steel
and power of the destiny
Sealed my fate I know the future
I will be forever free

Opening the book of secrets, magic words are calling me
I will fight until the day I die
Ancient wisdom of the elders promising the gift of life
Spread my wings of freedom to the sky

From the shadows I am rising
Reaching for divinity

Feel the vengeance on my steel
and power of the destiny
Sealed my fate I know the future
I will be forever free

From the ashes I am rising
Flying to eternity

Feel the vengeance on my steel
and power of the destiny
Sealed my fate I know the future
I will be forever free
