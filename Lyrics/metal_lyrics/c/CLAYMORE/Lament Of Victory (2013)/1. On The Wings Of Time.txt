[Music &amp; lyrics by Vlad Invictus]

Come with me, I'll show you places
that you've never seen before
Magic kingdoms of the ages
Monuments of time

On this journey to horizons
you will find your sanctuary
You'll feel safe and you will know
all your fears are gone

To eternity
To your destiny

Fly on the wings of time
Far to horizons far beyond your mind

Time will carry you from madness
Time will tell you many tales
Fly above this gray existence
Pain will go away

Share the wisdom and the power
Time is running endlessly
You're the one who holds the key
to new reality

To eternity
To your destiny

Fly on the wings of time
Far to horizons far beyond your mind
