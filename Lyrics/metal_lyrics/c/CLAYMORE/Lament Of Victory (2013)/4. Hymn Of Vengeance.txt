[Music &amp; lyrics by Vlad Invictus]

Slain in battle, you sleep now in heavens
My father, your death must be avenged
You died for our freedom, your blood is my oath
that I shall not rest until I feed my sword
I now draw this circle of vengeance and hate
to glorify memory, I call upon gods
Oh, hear me, almighty, if that is my fate
then I will not fall, for I will be strong as steel

I will have revenge
Like the wind I will break these chains

With the hammer of gods I'll grind you to dust
and time will stop for all of your kind
Your head will stand high on the top of my spear
Your people will run, for I'll bring them fear
Hear my curse, hear my cry, a thundering storm
I will bring you death, for that I was born
Oh, hear me and grant me my vengeance this night
Then I'll end my oath and I'll raise the sword of steel

I'll release you from life
Now kneel and weep as you die

Take this sacrifice
it's the oath of blood
Vengeance from my heart
no man can defy

Now die!
Your blood is my oath!

Take this sacrifice
it's the oath of blood
Vengeance from my heart
no man can defy
