[Music by Vlad Invictus &amp; Goran GarÄeviÄ; lyrics by Vlad Invictus]

I'm the blade of your doom
I will end your book of life
I am piercing through your flesh
I'm your judge and I'm your jury

Touch me, I'll tear your soul
I'm the sweet death you are looking for

Sorrow's tear, I will be here
to blood your eyes and to hear your cries
Sorrow's tear, I will be here
to blood your eyes and to hear your cries
Hear your cries

I'm the venom in your blood
sea of poison in your cup
I'm the stealer of life's breath
fate that's worser than your death

Hold me, I'll be your end
I'm the omega, of darkness descent

Sorrow's tear, I will be here
to tell you lies and to bring demise
Sorrow's tear, I will be here
to tell you lies and to bring demise
Bring demise

Sorrow's tear, I will be here
to blood your eyes and to hear your cries
Sorrow's tear, I will be here
to tell you lies and to bring demise
Bring demise
