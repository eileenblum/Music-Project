It's another day in my home town
In the center of all Hell
But tomorrow I'll be long gone
I bid the pain farewell

I'm leaving the Warzone
I leave it behind
My father is gone
Not a trace to be found

My neighbours children are dying
The Devil stroke again
On the streets women are crying
The curse of evil men

I'm leaving the Warzone
I'm leaving today
I'm leaving the Warzone
It is the only way

I see Your faces in sorrow
As I telling you goodbye
But here there's no tomorrow
No matter how I try

So listen to my story
Listen to what I tell
Some people think it's glory
But you know it's living Hell

I'm leaving the Warzone
I leave it behind
My father is gone
Not a trace to be found

FAREWELL
