Where in Hell did You get so wrong
You're out to ban Rock 'n Roll songs
You want the people to follow You
Rule the masses, that's Rock 'n Roll too

A Christian You say You are
I sayin' that You're misusing His name
You're liar You've gone too far
When He comes You'll be the one to blame

The greatest crime of all time
Another fool in time
You say that You will follow the Lord
But when He comes You won't be heard
No no way

Talk about the blind leading the blind
You're not nice, You're evil &amp; unkind
Your moral views has caused the pain
That's way
No one loves each other &amp; You're to blame
You bastards
