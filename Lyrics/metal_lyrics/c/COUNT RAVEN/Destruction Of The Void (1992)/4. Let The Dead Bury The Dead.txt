You are an asshole, You're the worst kind of worm
That have crawled out of the ground
Your existence I'm sorry to say is everywhere
On the new job &amp; on the beach, I find you there
The Antichrist is born of a Jackal they say
It seems that you've been born the same way

I can tell that You didn't plan to go far
I just want to know, who the hell You are

You suck the bosses dicks, a sad shape
You put the poor ones down, a human fake
Your whole life is a masquerade
All You are looking for: A better grade

The whole creation knows, You're Satan's slave
Who doesn't realise his sorrow &amp; pain
A child of the grave

I tell You there ain't no use in denying
Life's short &amp; one day You are dying
Then You stand trial to the maker
What will You say to the giver &amp; taker
You believe the lies that fills your head
All I say is let the dead bury the dead

I'll tell what will be, Your biggest fear
No one will remember Your name
You weren't here
