Now the time has come for me to go
To the place that we all know
I'll travel with my silver machine
That was meant for every human being

The stars are in the sky
Here I go, I am going to die
A journey through the universe, to the sweet home of mine

No use to scream, this is no dream at all
The final journey, the final call
The greatest mystery &amp; reality
And all You people are gonna join it with me

Soon
I'll be walking the streets of gold
The milky way is heaven I was told
100,000 stars with life today
You age 27 years to go that way

The stars are in the sky
Here I go, I am going to die
A journey through the universe, to the sweet home of mine

Farewell, my sweet friend
I am saying farewell to You
