Oh You wonderful people
I need you all today
I reveal myself to you
If that is okay

In my minds eye I see people they are not free
In my world I'm living in I feel no harmony...

Started out &amp; raised a little family
I was happy for a while
Sadness struck I realised eventually
You're the family that makes me smile

I need You &amp; You need us.
Together we break free
There's no other way to go
To feel the federaly

Listen people I had a vision
Help me before I go paranoid
Search your souls &amp; help me in this descision
A total Destruction of the Void

My heart is an unfinished galaxy of dreams
Before I go I want to know just what this life means
