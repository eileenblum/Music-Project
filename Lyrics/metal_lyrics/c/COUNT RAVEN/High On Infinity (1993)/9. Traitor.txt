The rats start to scream, you are threatening their dream
They want peace and quiet, on their way to eternal night
You can't be your own, it will make the others moan
They plot and they scheme, they must kill every dream

All around looking for another reason
They must destroy someone, commited to a treason
Traitor

Goodnight to you, a bedtime story I tell it's true
Under the sun nothing's new, nothing's won
A philosophy, that holds no solutional key
Go to work and get payed, don't ask for more they say

A wageslave that's all you ever be
They steal your life and leave you in misery
Traitor

The world seems chaos and confusion
Someone gains on this illusion
Just one life, in love's name you had it
Still you dare refusing to live it

Strange reality, you work your life away
Killing yourself, just to pass another day
That's not how the world was meant to be
It's easy to see, still we don't, it's a pity

All around looking for another reason
All around you hear the nonsense reason

No wonder you feel sick inside
It hurts so much you have no place to hide
Come with me I got the key to your heart
Travel through time and space in my time warp

A storm blows up outside, it's coming, it's coming
The rats they hide inside, they're running, they're running
But we are not afraid, we know why, we know why
Our time has finally come, I say yeahhh
