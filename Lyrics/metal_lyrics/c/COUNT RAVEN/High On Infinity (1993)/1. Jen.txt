Jen you're stuck into my world now
And you're one of god's most precious pearls now
And your blue eyes show a new dimension
That this world has got a new extension

You came to me in days of sadness
There is no young there is no old
You took me into your world of madness
Now twice I don't have to be told

Jen honestly I say I love you
Hair, that has the colour of chestnut, that
presence I admire you
Happy is your world wide religion
You can't hurt nobody, at least with no intention

We are just smiling at each other
Honey you must be from above
And those in sadness we will bother
We sold our souls for love
To everybody

And when you meet her
Then say hello for me
The sweetest child of mine
