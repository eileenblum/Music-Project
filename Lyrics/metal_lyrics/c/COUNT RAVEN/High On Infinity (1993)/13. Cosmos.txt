Everywhere you see my trace
Of my creation journey through the space
The secret of the big bang's mine
The science master of all time

If you really want to leave this hell
Then listen to what I tell
Drop out of society
Leave it all and follow me

Don't worry 'bout the clothes to wear
I'll find you food and shelter here
Live your life to the full
Cosmos is beautiful
Cosmos is eternal
