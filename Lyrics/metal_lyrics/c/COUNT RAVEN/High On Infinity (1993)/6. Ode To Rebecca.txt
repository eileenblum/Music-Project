I have found you, the chosen one
I have found you, the infinite one

For you I gladly walk into the valley of life &amp; death
Hand in hand with horror &amp; love &amp; life everlasting
You were born in silence, still I hear your voice
You were born to silence, meaningless words spoken with rottening tongues
Zombie dead creatures walking this earth

Still you won't hear the gathering sounds of the final fight of Armageddon
You refuse to hear the lies spoken since dawn of time
You never look the Evil one in the eye
And you never feel the pain

I have found you, the chosen one
I have found you, the perfect one, the infinite one
