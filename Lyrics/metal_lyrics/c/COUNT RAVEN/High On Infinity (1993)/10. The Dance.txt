The road is so long
And I am so alone
The wind blows outside
It feels like suicide, so come on

This is the same old song
I cannot go but wrong
I'm just a simple man
Who tries to understand, come on

The first moth of summer's here
Again you disappear
And later the same noon
I'm howling at the moon, come on

Still I hear you say
That life is quite okay
Still I'm the only one
Still I'm the lonely one, so come on
