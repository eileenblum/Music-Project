[written by Dan Fondelius]

Mother nature has crossed the lane
Finally caught in sands of time

Daddy, must we burn my sundry any day?
Feeling so faint, I start to pray.

I scream
Tell me it is not so I dream
Let this nightmare go

In this the vary last of days
I'd to go first

Is it that we woke up much too late?
Feeling to be ceased and living hate.

I scream
This is the price you have to pay
I scream
You bastards better break, yeah.

I'm ready as they cease to feed us
In tedious times I think of you to listen
For a loose sometime

We are now living in the seventh seals
God was right all along
In this fight around me

As I woke up from pain of life and death
People of world they seem of foul and dispute
I shackle the shadow

Repay your chain
This was the last time that the enemies
This was far to see its faults some years ago
The prophet's wonders

I know, I know

Might is of falling god's life it never was
Tomb stone is calling and forever

I scream
Tomorrow blinks of fast
I scream
Don't know how long I last
