[written by Dan Fondelius]

Greetings humanity here comes the war
Now it has reached your own door
I don't understand why you look so pale
You had your chance, now you must pay

I am the one who started the fire
Cos you lack any desire
And I guard the fire until it burned
Away everything you've ever learned

Everyone started to do the dance
Around the golden calf in trance
They have to hurry and hurry fast
Cos they all know they will never last

The poor have suffered for too long
Meanwhile all governments sing their songs
Their day of slaughter is at hand
Their heads on plates I will demand
