[written by Fredrik Jansson]

The time has come to say goodbye
The years of pain. It's over now
No more fears, no more lies
Rest your head and close your eyes

Embrace the end, never ending sleep
Forever lost in eternal dreams
Darkness comes and tucks you in
A peaceful feeling spreads deep within

Seven days passed by my door
As I watched you fade away
I stood speechless by your side
When you drifted towards the end

Our time is gone. We said goodbye
The years of pain, it's starting now
Shattered souls fills with grief
I know the scars will never heal
