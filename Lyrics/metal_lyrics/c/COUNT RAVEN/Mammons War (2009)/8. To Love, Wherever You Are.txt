[written by Dan Fondelius]

Tonight I'm drowning in your eyes
No will to fight and to deny
Tonight I'm drowning in your skin
Was it here that all things did begin?

Tonight I will love you for sue
Tomorrow I'll break down all the doors
I'll tell them you are in my life
And I want you to be my wife

This song is for someone out there
I haven't met you yet my dear
But when I do please believe
I will be true and never leave
Never leave
Never leave
