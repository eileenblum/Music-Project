The silent one speaks to me about things that has to comeA natural progression, 'cos things they cannot be left undoneI need to talk to you, and you have to listen too!Just a small piece of prediction, that we must simply go throughGreat is the cry over Bosnia, when Ravenna's monster sees the lightAcross the Adriatic sea they come in millions and turns the day into nightA massive invasion from the east, the least that you expected toNot enough power to hold back, when U.N.s crushed and NATO's through Living in a dream, oh Europe so unawareOf the ongoing scheme, soon under heavy warfare Driving the enemy, across the sea, into ItalyNot one city will be spared, on the coastline, from Monaco to SicilyThe Vatican will be destroyed, and Pope John Paul will be no moreHe tries to run away but he'll be captured, and killed outside Lyon on St.Lucy's dayThe battle rages on into France, sweet Paris will be no moreFar into the future when it's over, the main town will be AvignonEntire France is soon invaded, by anger and unholy hateAnd it's gonna have to swear itself to be a Muslim stateThe world stand and stare, they don't understand what's going onLike the Bosnia affair, too late they saw what was wrong Mass graves, slaughter, women raped every dayChemical warfare, smell of bodies that decayThe world has never seen such cruelty beforeStill something worse waits to open up the door The Allies they attack from Belgium, Germany and HungaryA massive strike of the British, in the Mediterranean seaThey drive them all the way back into those countries where they came fromFinally they have to pay for all the evil that they have doneMany years will have to pass before the ending of the tyrannyThe destruction is simply so devastating, a continent will cease to beFinally the Christian flag is risen in the city of IstanbulThe beast of the east will taste he's own medicineAnd they themselves will be ruled
