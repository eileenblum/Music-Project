I see the children, relieved and they sigh
Friday is here, they are going into town
But you're not really going anywhere tonight
It's just another chapter in the lie of life

A stimulated businessman travels the world
Meeting new cultures and hearing their words
Having a good time but missing the light
It's just another chapter in the lie of life

It seems there is no choosing
It must be a bad dream
Everyone is losing
A massive global scream

I see women raising kids in the suburbs
Doing the best they can in the smallest of worlds
Trapped under the same yoke, that life is just a strife
It's just another chapter in the lie of life

I see the past, inventing in the lie of life
I see the present, nursing the lie of life
I see the future, becoming my lie of life
