Welcome the future, give us the cancerA good solution, in fact the answerRadiation's good for mankindThere is no danger, says Mr. NarrowmindThis is a good decisionSays an over weighted, fat politicianThey say that they making amendsFunny religion, dollars and sense What the hell's the matter with you peopleWhen will you ever learnThis war on the world you cannot seeDay of doom is what you'll learn The madman of today, destroys the worldAnd your voice will never be heardWe refuse to see and lie, or commit suicideNo one will ever know how much you've criedAll they care of, is their financial successBut the health of their own children, they couldn't care less What the...The real retards Nature's got us by the throatWe can no longer hideTime has come to voteIf we shall live or dieGod made this dying world I can tellStill you send it into hell I sing you this nice lullaby, before you go to bedTo give you some bad conscience, the guilty out of their head'cos no one's free 'til everyone's free, this I will make you seeNature's crying for deliverance, start to make it breathe
