I still don't believe itIt happens every dayThe darkest longest storyHow long must we prayI see his eye of madnessI see his eye of stoneTheir minds and tongues are rottenTheir counted to be goneI will shine The mad ones that are killingAnd hiding bodies stillWe think that they escapingBut they never willI see his eye of sadnessI see his eye of stoneHis heart and brain's decidedThey are counted to be goneI will shine They say that I am crazyAnd I can't cope with lifeBut I have a visionAnd towards that I strideOne day I can tell youThe pain will come to youThen you realizeThat all I said was trueI will shine!
