Since creation of human kind
Fallen angels been around
Litter oceans and the skies
Defying life just to die

One world in Humongous need
All denied by demon greed
From the cradle to the grave
You have to work and be their slave

So this is the life?
Joy and sorrow - day and night
The lies goes on and on
To overshadow what Jesus won

Satan fell from the sky
His wingless children multiply
You can change this earthly hell
Yes, you are bound to break the spell
There's no one else to turn to
There's never been no one else
In this world of total loneliness
My sweet Jesus
