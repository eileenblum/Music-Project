This night the stars are closer to the winters moonI can't understand that the earthlings are still in gloomI have to ask you a question people!Do you care about anything at all? What is running through your mindWhen did you leave yourself behindThe beast he will gladly feastOn your soul that you never missed I can't understand this paradox we're living inOut here all is clear, while civilization are built in sinForce them into cages and they tell sweet lies to themThat this is the only world you are living in Once day you are gonna dieAnd the beast will be around no moreYour body is cast into the fireYou don't exist any more You have to realizeYou don't even have a life!The sun comes up every morningStill it is eternal night So in the end you have nothing to loseThe signs always been there and as well to chooseAnd after all has been said and doneWill you remain forever the loneliest one?
