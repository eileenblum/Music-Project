I see through you, and there's more than one side of a humanI see through you, and there is nothing you can doDoesn't matter what you do, there is no point in schemingIf you think that you can, you are only dreamingI know everyone's mindFrom my best friend to the maddest politicianI wish to leave it behind, but you know it ain't my decisionEveryone has a task, in life, and I know that this is mineTo tell the truth, and expose the thoughts of those who's lying It is P.S.I. power, your mind has nowhere to hideI read your mind like an open book, you can never lie One thing is pride, that's the thing that hold a human togetherThey change like the tide, every day a new maskThis goes on foreverHow can you go on? Even when you know we are fragileEveryone, will be broken after a whileFacing the sun, and my Father I'm so sick of this lyingUnited as one, it can never be and I start crying It is... How can we believe, with our everyday lyingThat we still can achieveSomething when other things we are denyingThis theater of pain, which is our everyday occurrenceYou should be ashamed, when you know your life expectancyI see through you, it's P.S.I. power and I know your locationIt's alien to you, but you are the alien to the whole creation It is...
