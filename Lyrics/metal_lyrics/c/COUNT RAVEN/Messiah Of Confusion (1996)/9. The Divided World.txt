Time will come when all stupidity is goneTime will come when all the misery is doneTime will tell all the scars that you got, all the why's, and so forth!Time will tell if it was you and what it was worth, then!Sooner than you think now baby Time will come when wars will be no moreTime will come when god knocks on your doorTime will tell if the life that you choose is the life that you wanted?Time will tell in the questions you asked where they to be granted you!Sooner than you think now baby I can see your sorrowReading no tomorrowThe golden way is narrow that leads you homeThe world has been dividedIt has been decidedTo separate the right from the eternal wrong's Don't you know your losingAnd yourself abusingThere is a choice in this time that's wrongIt's always been thatUntil we've seen thatThis is not the place that you belong
