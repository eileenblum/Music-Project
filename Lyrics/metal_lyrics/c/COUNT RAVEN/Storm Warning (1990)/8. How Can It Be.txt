Where dya think You're going,
in Your worldly greed and pride?
Say, where dya think you're going now,
it's time to turn the tides.
How can it be that You forgot how to love?

What dya think You're doing?
You worship demi-gods
twisting things that's sacred
to use for Your own cause
You're wicked

No wonder You fill ill in a sick society,
why don't You change Your ways and live in harmony?

Get rid of all Your agony and let Your feelings show,
kindness gains humanity
let peace and happiness flow, yeah!
God, won't You show them how to love.
