Can't believe there is a future
for the children of today
Corrupted politicians are standing in their way
don't let the system fool You,
all that they want is to rule You

They're blinding their eyes for glory,
a brief moment of success
Is all their fame and fortune a substitute for happiness?

For once in their lives, why can't they realize?
The answer is love, Yeah love!

Oh Father, whom art in heaven
behold this world in need
of peace and understanding
instead of hate and greed
Choose the way that's in Your heart.
