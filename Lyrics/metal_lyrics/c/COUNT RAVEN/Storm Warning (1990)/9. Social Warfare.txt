I can see our sunshine turn to rain
and I can see happiness turn to pain
Atomic bombs arise in nuclear skies
Oblivion sure won't come as no surprise

I can see our pride turn into shame
as we're drawn into play their deadly game
a politicians promises and lies
he's financing our funeral with a smile
bow Your head, share my sorrow
for You and me there's no tomorrow
the right to live is now on sale
the price - Your life
Social warfare

Now You might think You're not the one to bleed
better safe than sorry from our deed
Churches give salvation by the pound
Might come in handy when death comes creeping 'round
