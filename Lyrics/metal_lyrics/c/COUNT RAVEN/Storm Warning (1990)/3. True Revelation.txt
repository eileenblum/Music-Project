A new time has come, a new time is here
the one from the pit has risen and soon he'll make us fear
This is the time yeah this is the time now listen to this song
I'm gonna tell You a little story foretold by the prophet John

It started after the war when Israel got their land
It was the new beginning for today's modern man
Foretold two thousand years ago, now we know it's real
They've ruturned to their land on Silverbirds with wings of steel

The year is 1989 the news shocked us today
the Berlin Wall has fallen as many Germans prayed
Revolution in the Eastern block we can't believe our eyes
It's not the usual situation of the average media lies

True Revelation that comes to every nation
True Revelation that comes to every nation

The future that is coming up holds new hope for our World
All will say "PEACE NOW" and weeping won't be heard
Then a young man comes out of Egypt, he'll unite the
Middle-East a fair politician our new holy priest
The World will be amazed "What an incredible man!" he'll
confirm the alliance, all religions will shake hands
There will be one economy and we will all be free
No more creditcards that he can guarantee

The system that is coming up will really end this hell
A mark on hand or forehead or You can't buy or sell

True Revelation that comes to every nation
A new Manifestation the chosen aggrivation

This is the future that You look into and there is nothing that You can do
His next seven years will really be something else, Y'know
People will be stunned and say: "Way to Go!"
Now all is good and everything is fine, at last we will have some
peace of mind Relax and take it easy in your seats and count
in the number of the Beast

True Revelation that comes to every nation
It'll shake the foundation, in fact the whole Creation

Hear me now, all people, this is what I say: If Your heart
loves the Lord than You will be O.K.
In this time of knowledge and love for our world, for Mother Earth
we all fight, our voices can be heard
The World will be a better place, East and West shaking hands
In front of a Worldwide Government we all have to stand
Yeah, soon we'll have a fair world and things look better for You
Then along comes the One - You know who

True Revelation the Final Tribulation
True Revelation Gods Manifestation
