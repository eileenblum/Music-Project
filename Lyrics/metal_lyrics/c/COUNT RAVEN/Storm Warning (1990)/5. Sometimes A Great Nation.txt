The Pentagram is the Pentagon sign
CIA organize bloodshed all over the world
Kill the commies before the end of time
all over the world the weeping is heard

You bastards You don't know what You've done
There's nothing that's gonna save You now

Got sex-scandals while people live on the streets
Christians talk of Heaven and live out Hell
moral majority who's majority has no moral
People starving while markets do well

Headline news show people who die
and in the same breath the reporter smiles GOD

How can You sleep at night
Your own enemy and biggest fright
views that holds no truth
happy I'm not in your shoes

You're even radical the american way
that's why you can't see the light of the day
You don't know the World
You're locked out and You won't be heard
You bastards You don't know what You've done
There ain't nothing that's gonna save You now
