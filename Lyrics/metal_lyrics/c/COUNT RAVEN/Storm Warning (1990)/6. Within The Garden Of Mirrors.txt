Won't You take a ride with me today
into another world we leave to stay
in secret rendez-vous within Your mind
tomorrow is denied and left behind

"Come with me and I will show You
something that You never seen before..."

Look into the mirrors and You'll see
things that are and why they're meant to be
sugar blossoms under silver trees
won't You take my hand and follow me?

Rivers made of honey floating by
underneath a shiny golden sky
life can be so easy, can't You see?
If You just take my hand and follow me
