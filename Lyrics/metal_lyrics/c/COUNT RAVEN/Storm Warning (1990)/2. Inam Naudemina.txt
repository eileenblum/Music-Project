You have let me down one time too much
and inside I feel my patience burst
just because You're insecure and weak
doesn't mean I'll turn the other cheek
Through other's eyes it's yourself You have to see
what You tell me isn't my reality

Never again I'll let you know
no, I will never my feelings show
time and time again You're asking me to try
on broken promises I won't rely

You ask that I'm a loser, but
what is there to win ?
The highest price is heaven, not
spending life in sin
You're scared of Your own feelings,
afraid of Your own lust
Your life You take for granted,
in lies You put Your trust
