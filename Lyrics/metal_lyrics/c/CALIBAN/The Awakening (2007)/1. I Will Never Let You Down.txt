Wake up,
Stand up for everything you want
Let's go, let's live,
What are your dreams,
What do you wish?
It's up to you,
So open up your eyes
And see,
What could be
The world is there for us!
For us!

Forever
We Will Be Together
To love
For life,
Let all go,
Let me lead,
To be free!

Let me be
Your eyes forever mine
Let me be
Your guide through this life

What is real,
What is fake,
You'll never know for sure

All the pain,
All the lies,
I'll take them away from you,
It's up to you,
So open up your eyes
And see,
What could be
The world is there for us!
There for us!

Let me be
Your eyes forever mine
Let me be
Your guide through this life

I will never let you down!

Forever
We will be together
To love
For life,
Let all go,
Let me lead,
To be free!
