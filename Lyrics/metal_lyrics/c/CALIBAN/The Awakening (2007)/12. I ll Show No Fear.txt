I'm far away from home,
I see the deep blue sky being in a different time,

Nothing matters, no one cares
We have so many ways to go,
But I will always go my way

There will be fear and cries of pain
I'll show no tear and won't complain
Why can't you stay away from me,
I found a key to live my dream

Don't tell me who I am,
I live my life how I want to

You tell me to be someone else
To be what I don't want to be
Respect me, or leave me alone, I am what I am

Nothing matters, no on cares
And to be honest
I don't care

There will be fear and cries of pain
I'll show no tear and won't complain
Why can't you stay away from me,
I found a key to live my dream

Don't tell me who I am,
I live my life how I want to
