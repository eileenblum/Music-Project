I believe in my dreams for that as long as I will breathe.
I will never sacrifice myself for you again....

I won't be chained to you, my heart needs something new.

I will give you....I believed in what I saw, in what I had done.
I'll keep my eyes wide open to satisfy myself more than once again.
I will give you nothing more!
Can't you see how I feel?

I won't be chained to you, my heart needs something new.
