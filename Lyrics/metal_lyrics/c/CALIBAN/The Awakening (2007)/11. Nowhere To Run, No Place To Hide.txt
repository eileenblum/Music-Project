No regrets!

You caused me so much pain,
I can still feel the wounds
You left on my tortured skin...
I won't forget your chainsaw
And the games you played.
Come on, little angel,
Will you play my game
I'm full of hate
And this hate is eternal,
Are you sure you want this fight?

I'll fight with all my heart,
There is no time to pray,
No time to cry.
I'll fight with all my hate,
There's nowhere to run,
No place to hide.

You kept me in this dark hole,
It was like living hell,
With my open wounds that never healed,
You gave me my own blood,
You took it from my heart.
But now I'm free again
And I'll come for you.
And now is the time to strike back...
It will be hard and painful,
No mercy anymore.

There is no more forgiveness!

I'll fight with all my hate,
There's nowhere to run,
No place to hide.
