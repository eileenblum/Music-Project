When I remember the past sad grey days, when I surrender - I will never smile again.
Look in my eyes - a killing lance.
Love can hurt and that is no secret, but how much pain can I forget?

Everything you let go - brings liberation.
Everything we let go - leads to salvation.
The time we split I felt this anger, you were my blaze but pulled my anchor.
Every cloud has a silver lining and that's blessing in disguise.

Everything you let go - brings liberation. Everything we let go - leads to salvation.

When I remember the past sad grey days, the cold September when you said goodbye, look in my eyes - a killing glance.

Every end is a new beginning, I'm looking forward to rise from the dust!

Everything you let go - brings liberation.
Everything we let go - leads to salvation.
