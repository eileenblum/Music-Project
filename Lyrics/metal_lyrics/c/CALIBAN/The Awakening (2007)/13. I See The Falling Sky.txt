[Japanese bonus track][feat. Anders FridÃ©n of "In Flames"]I would like to see
What becomes of me
A reason, a failure, displaced it be

I would like to know
When he will drown
Connected, convicted, technology

Green turns into grey*
But way too slow
Progression, depression, we suffocate
The lyin' and all the cryin'
Decision, depression, communicate

[Chorus:]
The rest is not real, but that is a lie
Beneath me I see the falling sky

I shut my eyes to see better times
All for, trust more, but in vain
I saw the madness, our weakness
Destruction, corruption, no wonder I'm insane

[Chorus 2x]

When I look around
When I try to remember
When I look around to a better time

When I look around
When I try to remember
When I look around, I start to dream

Tell me what you think
Tell me, am I sick?
Desperation, termination, rebuilt
(Oh, the end is near)
Goodbye my dear
Defeated, deleted, it was a guilt

[Chorus 2x]
