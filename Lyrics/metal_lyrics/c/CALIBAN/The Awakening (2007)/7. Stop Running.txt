Don't be afraid of me, I'll be there for you - night and day.
I'll show you things which make you laugh.
I'll show you things which make you smile.

Let me be your friend.
Give me the chance to conclude.

Let me erase this time, 'cause when I look around, I see just pain.
This awful time that makes you sick.
This awful time that makes you cry.

Let me be your friend.
Give me the chance to conclude what drives you insane.

Don't run away from your inner fears,
I'll be there for you - forever - whatever you'll say.
I'll be there for you - forever - in every way.

So what's your answer now, are we friends or should I leave you alone
I'll show you things which make you laugh.
I'll show you things which make you smile.

Let me be your friend.
Give me the chance to conclude what drives you insane.
