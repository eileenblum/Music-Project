I fought my way through the darkest days
Out into the light I was scared and I cried
But I believed in something more
You are guilty for

This darkness you gave my everyday
Everytime you pushed me away
The coldness you had shown me everyday
You'll never hurt me again

No mercy for the merciless
No forgiveness

I was not willing to believe that's all
All the pain
All the tears
All the lies
There was a great spark in the dark
A shining mark

This darkness you gave my everyday
Everytime you pushed me away
The coldness you had shown me everyday
You'll never hurt me again

Your time is gone
My time has come
Your life is done

This darkness you gave my everyday
Everytime you pushed me away
The coldness you had shown me everyday
You'll never hurt me again

No mercy for the merciless
No forgiveness
