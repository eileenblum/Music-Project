Let me remind you of the cold mountain skies, the time we felt this red - hot fire inside.
I'd like to picture it again.
Your pretty face and blazing eyes.
In front of these burning skies.....

So give me a reason - I just need a sign.
I think I really love you.
I think I'm supposed to fight.
Please let us repeat this time, let's save what we had.
I'm afraid to lose my mind with you on my side.
I don't know why I'm still here.

So give me a reason - I just need a sign.
I think I really love you.
I think I'm supposed to fight.

I need your promise or a kiss.
Show me the way out of the abyss.

Give me a reason.
I think I really love you.
I think I'm supposed to fight.
