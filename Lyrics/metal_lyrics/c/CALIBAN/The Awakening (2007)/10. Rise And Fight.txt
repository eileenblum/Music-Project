What do you expect from life if you just watch and wait.
What do you expect from life?
You sit there in your rocking chair, complaining and cursing about everything.....
It  is up to you, it is up to us to bring the change, to start the fight

For you, for us, I will rise before we die.
For you, for us, I will fight to be satisfied.

I WILL RISE, I WILL FIGHT!!!!

We are the world.
We are the force.
Together we can win the fight.
We all see the news, we all feel the fear.
But we do nothing against it, wake up and rise for what you want, for what you wish, together we can break free.
It is up to you, it is up to us to bring the change, to start the fight.

For you, for us, I will rise before we die.
For you, for us, I will fight to be satisfied.
