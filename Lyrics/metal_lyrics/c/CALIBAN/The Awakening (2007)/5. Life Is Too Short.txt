Dead end and no way back
Walls came crashing down on me
Whatever I try
Whatever I do
My mind will go insane
Change is the headline and I am reborn
All the crying
All the mourning is gone

I woke up with a new view of life
I don't know what has happened to the past

Life is too short to think all through
Life is too short to waste it all

So listen to your heart
And help your dreams
To come true
Life is too short

Too many dreams kept in the dark
Too many wishes are blown away for nothing
A new time
A new chance
I am a rising star
I am back
I will fight
I will love again

I woke up with a new view of life
I don't know what has happened to the past

Life is too short to think all through
Life is too short to waste it all

Life is too short
