With open arms, I am waiting.
With open arms, I see the end.
With open arms, I am dying - dying a mournful death.......
.....the landscape wipes out my tears, it's greyness stings my eyes, where the hell is the gloom?
What the fuck, I am so doomed!

Starlight from the sky - lead my heart and tell me why, starlight from the sky - tell me why!!!

With open arms, I am crying.
With open arms, I'm going down.
Wind blows my joy away, help me out of these mournful days....

Starlight from the sky - lead my heart and tell me why, starlight from the sky - tell me why!!!

Too many days I had no faith.
I wish I had someone to blame.
Someone to blame.

Starlight from the sky - lead my heart and tell me why, starlight from the sky - tell me why!!! WHY!!!!
