There is a dark place inside of me
Follow my pleasure, pain, darkness, light
This is your sacrifice!
You are what you are, full of scars
Look at the dark instead of the stars
Are you fucked up enough to become one of us?
Will you become one of us!?

Inferno
You'll burn eternal
Inferno

It's always been inside us, how long can we keep it in?
The darkness crawling from the corners of your mind
The darkness when right is wrong, this is my sacrifice

Welcome to my nightmare
No hope for those who enter here
This dreadful mud-hole is my soul
Demons are howling from below
May your restless spirit dwell roaming from heaven to hell
You can't kill death
Will you become one of us!?

Inferno
You'll burn eternal
Inferno

Can you feel the pain
This is your darkness
Can you feel the pain?
So fucking loveless!
Now I stand alone, on the edge of the world and all I see is mercy
I lost count of all the things that I miss, but in darkness I can see where the light is

It's always been inside us, how long can we keep it in?
The darkness crawling from the corners of your mind
The darkness when right is wrong, this is my sacrifice
