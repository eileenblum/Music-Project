We keep going down the road
That we call home between the dark and dawn
We'll be reborn

What have we become!?
Walking through fire
Oh, we have changed
Living our lives so close to the flame
Now we want it
Now we get it as we take it
We will break it
Can't you feel it get addicted, intoxicated

You and me against the world it's gonna be alright!
Waking dreams of broken souls
No dream without a sacrifice!

We keep going down the road
That we call home between the dark and dawn
We'll be reborn

Walking through fire we're not looking back
There's a new horizon remember to forget
Now we want it
Now we get it as we take it
We will break it
Can't you feel it?

Will you follow me?
Love me or kill me now!

You and me against the world it's gonna be alright!
Waking dreams of broken souls
No dream without a sacrifice!

Will you follow me?
Love me or kill me now!
