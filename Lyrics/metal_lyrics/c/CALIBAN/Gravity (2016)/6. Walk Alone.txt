Can't you hear them craving -crawling- face down in the dirt!?
Can't you hear their voice -fading- dying to be heard!?
This is their last resort, but they won't be heard
This is heaven's end (a) barb wired promised land

Open the gates - break down the walls
We walk alone on burning ground
Don't drown just now
Walk on with hope in your heart
Don't drown just now
We walk alone...

Can't you see them drowning -choking- no more breath inside!?
Can't you see their pain with their desperate eyes!?
We build the highest walls we dig the deepest graves
(but) it's all in our hands
Wake up and be the change - right now!

Open the gates - break down the walls
We walk alone on burning ground
Don't drown just now
Walk on with hope in your heart
Don't drown just now
We walk alone...

This is the curse of our world, heaven and hell
Tear it down!

We walk alone on burning ground
Don't drown just now
Walk on with hope in your heart
Don't drown just now
We walk alone...

This is the curse of our world!
