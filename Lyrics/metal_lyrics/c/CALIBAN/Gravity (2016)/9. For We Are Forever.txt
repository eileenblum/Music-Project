We are the past, we are the now, 
we are everything that's down the road
Hate-filled hearts march through the streets 
and spread disease of their make believe

The world is fucked - wake up!

Hey hey, let's reach out to the sky
Hey hey, no rest until we die
Hey hey, put your hands together
Hey hey, for we are forever

Rise up!
Stand up!
We'll never stop

It's on us, it's in our hands
For better times will come again
An open heart, an open mind
We stand tall from end to end

The world is fucked - wake up!

Hey hey, let's reach out to the sky
Hey hey, no rest until we die
Hey hey, put your hands together
Hey hey, for we are forever

Let's reach out to the sky - no rest until we die
We'll never fall apart - we are forever

Hey hey, let's reach out to the sky
Hey hey, no rest until we die
Hey hey, put your hands together
Hey hey, for we are forever

The world is fucked - wake up - the world is fucked!
