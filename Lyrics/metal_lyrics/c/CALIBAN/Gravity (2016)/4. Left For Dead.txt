You fucking coward, get out of my way
You fucking liar led me astray

You must be a fool if you think everything is alright
We walked in the dark and we walked in the light
The smile on your face is a knife in my back
You sucked out my blood - left for dead

I fucking hate you - farewell my friend
This is for you - my last revenge
I burn the bridges - no turning back
There's nothing left - but my revenge

You fucking coward, get out of my way
You fucking liar led me astray

You preyed on me, you let me down
You left me on my own
You got my life, you got my time - my everything
You were like a mirror - now broken to pieces
Reflecting who I am - trust was my weakness

I fucking hate you - farewell my friend
This is for you - my last revenge
I burn the bridges - no turning back
There's nothing left - but my revenge

You left me for dead with a knife in my back

I fucking hate you - farewell my friend
This is for you - my last revenge
I burn the bridges - no turning back
There's nothing left - but my revenge
This is my revenge

Fuck You!
