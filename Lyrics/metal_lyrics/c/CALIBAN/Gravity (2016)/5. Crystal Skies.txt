When I'm lost and down again
Then I just want to get away
So depressed with all the pain
I'll come back another day
A trip to nowhere (nowhere, nowhere)
Echoes in my head
Now I'm here â now I'm there
Looking at the world from down here (down here)
Lost in a haze â let me disappear

Lost in acid dreams â can't feel anything
You save my soul â put my halo down
You sent my pain below
I know you'll break me â make me drown again
But I can't let you go

Crystal skies are falling down
It feels like (I'm) flying
Although I drown
My eyes are shut, but now I see
That I'm broken, perfectly

Lost in acid dreams â can't feel anything
You save my soul â put my halo down
You sent my pain below
I know you'll break me â make me drown again
But I can't let you go

I take my fucking life back!
You left nothing for me
Hoping I wouldn't see
But I was quick to react
You'll fucking burn
With the weight of the world
Now upon your head
'Cause it's the least you deserve, yeah!
Your selfish apathy
Would be an end to me
But not anymore
I will face tonight with my head held high
I step back out in the rain and raise my fist to the sky!

(You save my soul â put my halo down)
(You sent my pain below)
(I know you'll break me â make me drown again)
(But I can't let you go)
You save my soul â put my halo down
You sent my pain below
I know you'll break me â make me drown again
But I can't let you go
I am!
Lost in acid dreams!
Can't feel anything!
