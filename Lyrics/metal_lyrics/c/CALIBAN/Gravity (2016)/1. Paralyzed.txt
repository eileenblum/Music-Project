I'm just a shadow
just another brick
I'm just an echo
It makes me sick

They shove it, down my throat
all this bullshit
makes me overdose

I'm the ghost
you're the night
I'm the shadow
you're the light

I'm the ghost
you're the night
I'm the shadow
you're the light

I am paralyzed
oh I'm paralyzed

I am tired of your ties
A reflection of your lies
I am paralyzed

You fucking prick
drop dead
you make me sick
blegh

You fucking prick
drop dead
you make me sick
Get out of my head

I'm still a shadow
it ain't ever gonna stop
I'm still an echo
Oh, sleeper, wake up
and they still shove it down my throat
they're never gonna stop until I overdose

I'm the ghost
you're the night
I'm the shadow
you're the light

I'm the ghost
you're the night
I'm the shadow
you're the light

I am paralyzed
oh I'm paralyzed

I am tired of your ties
my reflection of your lies
I am paralyzed

You fucking prick
drop dead
you make me sick
blegh

You fucking prick
drop dead
you make me sick
Get out of my head

I'm a ghost
I'm a shadow
breakout

I am lost
I am an echo
breakout

I'm a ghost
I'm a shadow
breakout

I am lost
I am hollow
breakout

I'm the ghost
you're the night
I'm the shadow
you're the light

I am paralyzed
oh I'm paralyzed

I am tired of your ties
my reflection of your lies
I am paralyzed

You fucking prick
drop dead
you make me sick
blegh

You fucking prick
drop dead
you make me sick!
Get out of my head!
