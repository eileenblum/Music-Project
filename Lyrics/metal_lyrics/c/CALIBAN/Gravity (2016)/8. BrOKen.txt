"No beautiful surface without a terrible depth"
You ripped my heart out, I wish I was dead
I cannot tame my demons forevermore
You are the reason I should have known before

Because of you I've lost it all
Seems like all we had is over now
Because of you I rise to fall
But in the end it's over now...

Are you still my anchor?
Cause you're dragging me down!
I'm lost in the ocean, call the sirens before I drown
I will leave with my head down
I've lost it all, it's all the same now...
It's all the same

Because of you I've lost it all
Seems like all we had is over now
Because of you I rise to fall
But in the end it's over now...

I'm cold, I'm lost, I'm wrong, I'm numb, 
I'm flawed, I'm sick, I'm tired, I'm done, 
I'm useless, broken, scared, can't run away

Because of you I've lost it all
Seems like all we had is over now
Because of you I rise to fall
But in the end it's over now...

I'm cold, I'm lost, I'm wrong, I'm numb, 
I'm flawed, I'm sick, I'm tired, I'm done, 
I'm useless, broken, scared, can't run away
