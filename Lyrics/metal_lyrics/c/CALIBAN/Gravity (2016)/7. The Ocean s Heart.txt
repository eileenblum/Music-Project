...And heaven shall burn upon those who set sail to kill...
Between the tides where the worlds collide,
a siren call from the other side.
A storm and a raging sea
the waves keep crashing over, it's Ahab's legacy.
This fight won't last forever.
Pulled by an iron chainâthe majestic giant can't hide
again and again and again.
The ocean's burning bright.
Forever again.

Can't you feel the pain
of the ocean's heart?
It's time to take the blame
before it breaks apart.

Can't you feel the pain
of the ocean's heart?
It's time to take the blame
before it breaks apart,
it breaks apart the ocean's heart!

... And heaven shall burn upon those who set sail to kill...
A kiss of steel, a fountain of blood, the weeping shores won't ever forget.
There's torment, tears and sinâAhab's legacy a thousand scars on his skin
a distorted elegy can't you hear, can't you hearâthis deadly symphony.
The end is nearâa last twitch calms the sea.

Can't you feel the pain
of the ocean's heart?
It's time to take the blame
before it breaks apart.

Can't you feel the pain
of the ocean's heart?
It's time to take the blame
before it breaks apart,
it breaks apart the ocean's heart!

The waves are burning, the tide it turning,
the ocean's bleedingâdrowning in blood.

Can't you feel the pain
of the ocean's heart?
It's time to take the blame
before it breaks apart.

Can't you feel the pain
of the ocean's heart?
It's time to take the blame
before it breaks apart,
it breaks apart the ocean's heart!
