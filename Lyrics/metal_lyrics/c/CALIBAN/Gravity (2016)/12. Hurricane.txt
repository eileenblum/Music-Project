We're not blind, we're not deaf
Relentless like an avalanche
We're not dead, we are the change
We strike back like an avalanche

Tempting lies, what should we believe?
We're blindfolded fools the truth we can't see!
Their words are like poison, can we resist?
I'm Paralyzed - dead inside

We're like an avalanche turning you inside out
We're like a hurricane turning you upside down
Like a hurricane
We will find a way before the daylight dies
Like a thunderstorm we're unstoppable
There's no place to hide
Like a hurricane
We will find a way before the days are done
Like a thunderstorm we're unstoppable
We swallow the sun

We're not blind, we're not deaf
Relentless like an avalanche
We're not dead, we are the change
We strike back like an avalanche

Burning lives. Why are we so weak?
Spineless in silence we follow their lead
(if you) gaze long enough into the deep
The abyss will gaze back into you!

We're like an avalanche turning you inside out
We're like a hurricane turning you upside down
Like a hurricane
We will find a way before the daylight dies
Like a thunderstorm we're unstoppable
There's no place to hide
Like a hurricane
We will find a way before the days are done
Like a thunderstorm we're unstoppable
We swallow the sun

Look at the world the clouds keep you blind
Don't be afraid of what you could find
Look at the world through different eyes
Wake up before the curtain falls
Find your light!
Wake up, wake up, wake up...

We're like an avalanche turning you inside out
We're like a hurricane turning you upside down

We will resist, we break through the clouds
We are the storm rise, rise!
