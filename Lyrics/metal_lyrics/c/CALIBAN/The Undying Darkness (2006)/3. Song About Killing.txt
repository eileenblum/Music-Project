I'm here to kill, I'm here to die
I feel this pain, I have this hate,
You teach me to love
You teach me fear,
But now you're getting it all back (and my reasons are just trivial)
Try to run away, but believe me, to die this is your fate
This is a song about killing, a love letter just for you,
Let's make it right, let's make it clear, no one wants you here!
All I want is to kill, I want you dead, the price is too high
My life's too short (I'm sick of hunting you)
You are my shadow, you are my demon
You have to burn for my joy, I'll watch you burn
So you better run, before I'll watch you burn
Try to run away, but believe me, to die is your fate
This is a song about killing, a love letter just for you,
Let's make it right, let's make it clear, no one wants you here!
