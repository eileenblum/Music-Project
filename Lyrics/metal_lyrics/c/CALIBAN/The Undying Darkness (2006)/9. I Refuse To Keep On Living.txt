Red, blood red, no matter where I look at, I'm waiting in a sea of blood
Where has time gone, what has happened in the dark?
Memories of fear, cries, noise, silence.
A new day, old routine, I refuse to keep on living such a sad life
Help me out, I try to run away, help me out, I know you can save me today, save me this time.
A new day, old routine, I refuse to keep on living such a sad life
Red, blood red, no matter where I look at, I'm waiting in a sea of blood
I'll go out into the street, staring eyes, laughing mouths, what have I done, what have I missed?
(I run to escape from this storm of ignorance, but no matter where I end, ignorance)
Help me out, I try to run away, help me out, I know you can save me today, save me this time.
(The dark.
I enjoy the silence, no one there.
I see my self, circling wild, time lapse.)
Am I at home, am I save? I look into the mirror, screaming, laughter, worse than before
Help me out, I try to run away, help me out, I know you can save me today, save me this time.
