In our world fire burns brightly, take care or you get hurt
Flames kiss you goodnight, in our world you cry.
Ashes is what's left behind, you're dead in my head, in our world you cry
We've gone too far now, we fell to deep, it's our burden to bleed!
We kill you all, kill you
We've gone too far, we fell to deep, didn't you see?
It's our burden to bleed.
Our life was just a lie, our way just pain what happened, what's left behind?
We've gone too far now, we fell to deep, it's our burden to bleed!
We kill you all, die.
What's left behind?
Just the shadows of our guilty mind, come on sweet death, we expect your lovely kiss!!
