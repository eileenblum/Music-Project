Coldness surrounds me, I'm filled with fear, in this room of nowhere.
Tell me where's my soul, I move in the dark, tell me where's my soul, we'll fed from hatred.
Scream surrounds me, kill or die.
(Your soul is our desire)
In this room of nowhere
Tell me where's my soul, I move in the dark, tell me where's my soul, we'll fed from hatred.
Masters of fire, teach me your art in this room of nowhere.
Tell me where's my soul, I move in the dark, tell me where's my soul, we'll fed from hatred.
