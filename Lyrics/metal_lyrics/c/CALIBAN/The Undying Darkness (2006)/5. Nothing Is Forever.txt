Certainty of emptiness, trustful, new pain and thoughts of the path
There is just one constant: Nothing is forever!
Time of calm and peace, time to look inside, relic pictures of past,
Black and white deceives, uncovers the glance for my grief, nothing is forever!
(From above the dark sky of the night watches instructive my inner fight)
I gave my heart, my blood, nothing is forever (but eternity).
Time of calm and peace, time to look inside, relic pictures of past,
Black an d white deceives, uncovers the glance for my grief, nothing is forever!
And in the end only haze remains, nothing is forever.
I gave my heart, my blood, nothing is forever (but eternity).
Certainty of fate, fatal emptiness, an empty hope for future, how shapeless fate shows,
I fight for something eternal, time of calm and peace, time to look inside,
Relic pictures of past, black and white deceives uncovers the glance for my grief.
Nothing is forever!!
