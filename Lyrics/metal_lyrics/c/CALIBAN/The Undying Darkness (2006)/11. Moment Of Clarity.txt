I am willing to suffer, to bleed, to die for things I care about,
But it's like kissing the lips of my dead love, like touching her dead, cold, white skin.
I choose to look back, to see myself, I never wanted to hurt you again,
I choose to look back, to see myself, I never wanted to loose you again.
I have never been here before, ground zero, the past is a gaping hole.
My only chance is to turn around and face it.
I choose to look back, to see myself, for her love, for her heart, for her trust, for her love I'm reborn.
I choose to look back, to see myself, I never wanted to hurt you again,
I choose to look back, to see myself, I never wanted to loose you again.
