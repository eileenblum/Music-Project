Your life is life, mine is just a lie.
Time passes by, everything flows in the same stream and we are driving down the river,
I pause and let you go, my tears whip the river, there I stand stiff forever,
Singing this song of mourning, my cradle is full of hope, I don't give up,
I break the wall (and fight forever for my joy)
YOu're going your own way, floating in another dream, you feel no fear, no doubt,
Your power keeps real
There will be new paths, no doubt and well fed fears, we will go our ways alone,
Together alone, let's go
Your life is life, mine is just a lie.
