I have no energy to be, where is my will and drive to be happy?
You're giving me hope, but everything seems to be illusion and smoke
For love, for life, for surrender!
Just one word and I'll be yours, just one touch an I'll burn again.
Just one word for a new time, cause in your eyes I see myself, I'm sick of running away.
But in your eyes what do I mean?
A name, one among of thousand others?
Nasty and sweet are my thought, but my desire can't be satisfied.
For love, for life, for surrender!!
The worst shall be over now, your mental beautyness was stunning,
My feelings for myself is overgrown of dried plants and I'm sick of running away!
Just one word for a new time, cause in your eyes I see myself, I'm sick of running away.
Just one word and I'll be yours, just one touch and I'll burn again.
