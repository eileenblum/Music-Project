a new day, a new struggle, blank walls scream
narrowness
but I'm my own prison, go, run rush into the woods
the vast unknown spurs on my will to fight
the energy, the magic of silence and I am immortal
my eyes become heavy, the mind porous
fire in the convergence
an inner force calls out my name and
says, everything is gone, everything is done, the
voice sounds
familiar, but my body is captured in fear and the
light leaves my way, fear is hiding in the
shadows, but I am the force and I light my
fire, the demon shall burn, the fire is my witness
a final scream, a final tear and I am free.
