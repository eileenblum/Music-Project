every day, I see your face
every day, I die
every day, I feel your breath
every day, I'm born again
you give me joy, but my thanks, are just pain, are just pain
and out of fear I pull myself loose again

I die for you
I die for you
I die for you
I die for you
I DIEEEEEE 

You are everything, I need what I desire
every day, I see your face
every day, I die
every day, I feel your breath
every day, I'm born again

you give me joy, but my thanks, are just pain, are just pain

you are everything I need, what I desire,
but will I ever understand?
come on!
I die for you
I die for you
I die !
please forgive my faults,
maybe one day I will realize what you mean (to me),
I hope it won't be too late

every time I cry,
I feel your lies
every time I die,
I see your eyes. 

every time I cry,
I feel your lies
every time I die,
I see your eyes.
