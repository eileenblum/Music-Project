walls collapse onto me, I ride the storm of rage
a mistake became a chain - reaction and the
reflection falls upon me
it's time for change, understanding and
faith are what friends are about, but on every corner
disappointment (is waiting, every wall would have
understood me better), I am cold.
I stand alone and all that remains is the hope
for help, the anger is strong and threatens to
destroy me, because what was will never be again,
too much has happened and the mind becomes dull,
it is the tragedy of time, a sea of tears for grief,
but from the shadows of my tears, of my past, you
come and give me your hand, tame my anger
my tears fade and together we fight as friend
together we fight as friend for (the) time.
