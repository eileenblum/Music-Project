come on, tell me who you really are
Stop with your lies, I've looked behind the mask and
now your time is over
day by day deceived, you blind my senses
you have never been a friend,
without scruples you've driven me to the point I am
standing at now
I jump "somersault backwards" and push you into the
depth that you've created yourself
now bear your own consequences,
feel the sorrow that you have imposed upon me,
feel the pain and scream from the abyss of your
malice,
nobody will help you,
who sows hate shall harvest pain.
