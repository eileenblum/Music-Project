deeply hidden in the deepest wood
black is the night
the owls are singing between the worlds
the circle closes, the cycle of fire opens it's doors
the guard between the shadows searches for fear-
(to broken souls he reaches out his hand and leads the
way into the night)
fire walk with me...
pain shouts you down
you've split and I spit on you
(call my name and I'll catch you
carry my ring and) I will kill you.
