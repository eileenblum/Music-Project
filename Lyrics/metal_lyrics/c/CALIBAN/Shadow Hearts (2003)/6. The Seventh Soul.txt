I travelled across the edges of my soul, add it
doesn't seem any better when I cross the border
The world falls to piece but every Sunset is
the rebirth of a new experience.
I often felt this sorrow, I often stand alone,
dipping and diving to see the bottom but where are the
lines that divine...
Confidential sins have already taken my so called
freedom and every choice I made framed my so called future.
I'm no longer care about the way I gone, burning
like a fire to smother in the end, wasting time
while I'm expecting death.
