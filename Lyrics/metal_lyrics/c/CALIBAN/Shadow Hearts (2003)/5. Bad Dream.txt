oh dark night, in silence broken ban,
shackles of fear, I lie there, flat and merely
the valley lies deep, staggering in the past, shadows
hide danger and feed me in the coldness,
I don't see myself,
don't look at me,
you would burn
as my house lies empty and
I float against the time,
come here, come in,
burn for my soul.
