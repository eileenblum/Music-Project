look into the wide, wild liberty
look well, it's reality
close your eyes and turn loose,
all burden is impulse
drop the anger, the hate you cherish
turn loose, cry on me, let go, let all go
I hold your hand and lead you
we're melt together, becoming one
and we get the power to cry,
scoop for your life, cry, detect your liberty
fight for your freedom,
freedom is life, burn down your walls.
