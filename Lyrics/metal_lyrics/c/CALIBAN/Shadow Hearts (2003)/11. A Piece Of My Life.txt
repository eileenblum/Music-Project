I feel breathe, live alone with my love,
I gave it to you, I should have known,
reality will never be a dream!
in my dreams I walk around,
in the darkness of my ashes,
always following your light,
I feel no fear, cause your fire gives me safety
my fire burns deep and ardent,
but I radiate just coldness and hopeless
helplessness, awkward,
naive like a child
everyday I fell reality, the reflection of the wide void
I don't want to live, just want dream!
(my fire burns deep and ardent)
come on and play with me.
