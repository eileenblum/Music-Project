Cries and whispers - Peace and twisters

I still remember the time of hope and fear
The time we had before all turned into tears
(I'm) embraced by darkness - I can't see the light,
I know &gt;&gt;she's&lt;&lt; dead - swallowed by the deepest night

I can't feel my aching heart 
Everything has fallen apart
Your voice still sounds in my head
Speak the words you've never said

Cries and whispers - Peace and twisters

All dead and gone, but who is to blame?
Right from the start we choke the flame
We set the course straight to hell,
From a lightning storm into a heavy swell

I can't feel my aching heart 
Everything has fallen apart
Your voice still sounds in my head
Speak the words you've never said

Mend my broken heart when evrything has fallen apart

Beyond the horizon - after all is said and done
I walk alone towards the midnight sun
The path ascends - no end in sight
Where do we go from here - I still search for light

I can't feel my aching heart 
Everything has fallen apart
Your voice still sounds in my head
Speak the words you've never said
