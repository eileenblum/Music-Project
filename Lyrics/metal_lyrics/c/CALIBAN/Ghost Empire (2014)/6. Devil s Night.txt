Once upon a time at the devil's night
I lost my heart - my heart and light
I am dead - dead but alive
A forgotten soul with savage eyes

I'm the demon you created - this nightmare is real
I'm the shadow behind - I'm everything you fear

Through blood and tears we broke this spell
You'll be by my side
Sleep well my darling - goodbye farewell
You'll be by my side

Black scars and a harlequin's face
Death in disguise - fallen from grace
Vengeance is mine
Crow - shaped blood stain (in) darkness divine

I'm the demon you created - this nightmare is real
I'm the shadow behind - I'm everything you fear

Through blood and tears we broke this spell
You'll be by my side
Sleep well my darling - goodbye farewell
You'll be by my side

We fly away - on broken wings
This is the end of everything - salvation!!!

Through blood and tears we broke this spell
You'll be by my side
Sleep well my darling - goodbye farewell
You'll be by my side
