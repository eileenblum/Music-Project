Welcome to my - fragile paradise
Where everything - is built to fall
That's my demise

In my world I'm one the &gt;&gt;endless&lt;&lt;
Everything turns upside down
Tossing - turning - flying - falling
Oh my god I'm loosing ground

I'm so far away - I'm losing ground
My Vertigo
I won't look back, with no regrets
Just let me go - My Vertigo

Welcome to my - fragile paradise
Where everything - is built to fall
That's my demise

Shattering echoes - silent cries
Delusive hope and hollow eyes
These walls come tumbling down
I'm gone - six feet underground

I'm so far away - I'm losing ground
My Vertigo
I won't look back, with no regrets
Just let me go - My Vertigo
