Remember the time I burned all bridges to you, it still breaks my heart in two.
How can I gain your trust again? How can I make you believe again?
My heart beats just for you â Iâll never let you go
Take this oath â i love you
My heart beats just for you â Iâll never let you go
Take this oath â Everything is just for you!
Which words are strong enough to make us rise from ashes. Forgiven is not forgotten. I want to be with you for now and forever, But forever is not even quiet enough.
Be my haven, be my anchor. Be my guiding light and lead us home â my heart is close to burst. My horizon is on fire. And the sky turns (from) blue to grey â take my heart and save my soul.
My heart beats just for you â Iâll never let you go
Take this oath â i love you
My heart beats just for you â Iâll never let you go
Take this oath â Everything is just for you!
