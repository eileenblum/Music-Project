The bogeyman is waiting in the shadows of your dreams. Youâre afraid to fall asleep. Youâre awake âtil youâre too weak.
Come sweetie come itâs bogey time, let me in and youâll be mine.
This pain I bottled up inside. This pain youâll never know. This pain thatâs accusing you. My scars donât even begin to show.
Your soul is broken and can never be mend.
You are trapped in a silent cage.
Come Sweetie, Come!
Come sweetie come itâs bogey time, let me in and youâll be mine.
Run sweetie run, cry and fade, this will be your last serenade.
Run, Cry, Fight, Dieâ¦
This pain I bottled up inside. This pain youâll never know. This pain thatâs accusing you. My scars donât even begin to show.
Here comes the bogeyman â penetrates your dreams.
Here comes the bogeyman -
taking white -
giving red.
