Black gold, black gold â our souls been sold it drips down our throats â fills up our lungs.
We can barely breath â canât spread our wings.
golden horizonâ¦burst in flames. burning despairâ¦again and again.
golden horizonâ¦so bright, but itâs fadingâ¦burst in flames eternal returnâ¦weâre waiting and waiting again and again and again.
We know â but weâll never change. Itâs true â thatâs what we became.
(Weâre) standing at the edge! Weâll never change!
Edge of black
Like a king with a rusty crown â like a saint on itâs way down. To the deepest ocean floor â forever more.
Black gold, black gold â our souls been sold. We all know the truth â but weâll never change. A shadow of a saint â Thatâs what we became.
Golden horizonâ¦so bright, but itâs fading â burst in flames. Eternal returnâ¦weâre waiting and waiting. Again and again and again.
We know â but weâll never change. Itâs true â thatâs what we became.
(Weâre) standing at the edge!!! Weâll never changeâ¦
Edge Of Black
The destroying angel shall arise. To give salvation to a world of lies. We will drown in an ocean of black. And we all deserve it â¦no way back!
Give âem Hell We know â but weâll never change. Itâs true â thatâs what we became.
Weâre standing at the edge!
Weâll never changeâ¦
Edge of black
