Welcome to war!
Everybody knows you and everybody told you that nobody needs you and nobody cares. Everybody is at war with their fingers on the board. Whatâs real (and) whatâs in your head. You release your poison to the world.
This is the modern plague.
Welcome to war! You canât escape!
If this is real, IÂ´d rather go blind then have this world pulled over my eyes! Cause in the end, itâs all in my mind and youâre the one whoâs left behind!
Everybody knows you and everybody told you that nobody needs you and nobody cares. Everybody is caught in a world of make believe.
Get a life â this is not real. We allow our-selfâs to be deceived. A virus, no one could heal.
