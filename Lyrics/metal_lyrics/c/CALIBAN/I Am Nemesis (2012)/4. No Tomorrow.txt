(To) write down a story Iâd rather forget wonât mend the heart thatâs shattered and shred.
Lord knows we tried, lord knows we failed (when) mistrustful feelings slowly prevailed.
We fade and fade from kiss to kiss with everything that lovely is. Weâve both grown cold from fight to fight. â¦until our love has died!
All my dreams are far away â you took my life and gave me hell. Give me back my yesterday â or should i finally bid farewell.
Never give all the heart for love. No effortâs ever good enough. Highs result in lowest lows, we disavow till it clearly shows.
A bad hand dealt, too blind with trust gave you my all, till all was lost..There ainât no rose without a thorn our love could grow and be reborn.
â¦and when you walk a wayâ¦then walk away my dear but when you turn around i wont be standing hereâ¦
No tomorrow!
All my dreams are far away â you took my life and gave me hell. Give me back my yesterday â or should i finally bid farewell.
No tomorrow!
