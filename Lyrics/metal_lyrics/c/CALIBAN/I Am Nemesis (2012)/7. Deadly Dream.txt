Blood for blood â Heart for heart
Woke up in this dream an ugly world unseen. Unleash the beast in me â takinâ a walk on elm street. I sing you a lullaby â in which your fears come to life.
A good place to die â no chance to survive.
Eye for an eye â A feast of sacrifice. Iâm the shadow â i am the light. No place to run, no place to hide.
Blood pours from the sky â Weâre dancing in the rain. A pandemonium â a symphony in pain.
I am your demise Youâre my sacrifice
I am the shadow â I am the light â youâre my sacrifice.
I am the shadow â I am the light â IÂ´m your demise.
Who i am? I am you!
Those who enter here will forever disappear. In the darkest night â I whispered in your ear.
You will be mine â cause itâs high time. Carnage â chaos â endless pain â will drive you insane.
I am nemesis â i give you death
Now you belong to me â (you will) die in agony. Greetings from hell â these are my dying words.
Every time I kill â I hope to end this curse.
I am the shadow â i am the light â youâre my sacrifice.
I am the shadow â i am the light â iÂ´m your demise.
Killing you is killing me.
Am I awake or still asleep?
Donât wake me up, donât make this real!
