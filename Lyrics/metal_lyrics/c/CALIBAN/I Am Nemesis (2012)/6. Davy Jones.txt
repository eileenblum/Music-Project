Iâm not going down that road again. You will drown by your self again.
In your ocean of made up lies. Rising water slowly shuts your eyes.
The waves are coming in. They washing you away. They leaving you astray.
I can be your anchor no more
Iâm not going down that road again. You will drown in the crimson rain.
A flooded soul, a cold embrace. Davy JonesÂ´s locker till the end of days.
The waves are coming in. They washing you away. They leaving you astray.
Iâm so sorry cause iÂ´m not sorryâ¦
The waves are coming in. They washing you away. They leaving you astray.
get lost,
get the fuck away!
