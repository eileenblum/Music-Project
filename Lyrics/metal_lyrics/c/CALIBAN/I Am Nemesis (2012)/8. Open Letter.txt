Corporate cunts and pencil pushers.
Prostitute your mind for cash. This way of live, it made me suffer.
Trade your given time for trash.
You all work jobs you badly hate to keep the bills at pay.
For shit you bought, but you donât need. What self-deceptive way.
Right From the cradle straight to the grave they want to tell us how to behave.Right from the cradle straight
to the end they want to force us to pretend.
An Open letter to you all. Your greed will take itâs toll. Weâre with our backs against the wall, but itâs only built to fall.
You tell me dreams are made to fail, like there is no escape. Prepared to walk the longest trail. Away from mental rape. Intimidate me with your lies.
Iâm paying any price. And when I come to say goodbye, canât look me in the eye.
Right From the cradle straight to the grave they want to tell us how to behave.Right from the cradle straight
to the end they want to force us to pretend.
An Open letter to you all. Your greed will take itâs toll. Weâre with our backs against the wall, but itâs only built to fall.
But I chose not to live like that Iâm fighting my way back!
