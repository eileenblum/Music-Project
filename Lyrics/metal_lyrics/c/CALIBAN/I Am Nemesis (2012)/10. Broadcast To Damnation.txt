Changing channels â watching the drama. Sit and fade while loosing your karma.
Day by day â they feed your brain. Lay your thoughts in hidden dreams. Those who watch, or those who serve!
I guess we (all) get what we deserve!
spineless &amp; faceless â go fuck yourself â donât ask why. heartless &amp; breathless â go fuck yourself â you know why.
pointless &amp; senseless â go fuck yourself â donât ask why. aimless &amp; faithless â go fuck yourself â you know why.
Itâs killing me â this war in my head â Itâs killing me.
We canât break free
Consume the light, consume the lie. Forget the world, forget your life. I cast a spell on you &amp; everybody else. Who doesnât give a shit for someone else. The world around you is an ugly place. Youâre not gonna die with a smile on your face.
Illness &amp; sickness â go fuck yourself . Dullness &amp; darkness â go fuck yourself .
The virus is out and there is no escape. A silent killer is on his way. The virus is out to choke your brain. A silent killer is after you â itâs all in vain!
Itâs killing me â this war in my head â Itâs killing me.
We canât break free
I donât wanna know about your madness.
I donât wanna know about your low life existence.
Broadcast to damnationâ¦
