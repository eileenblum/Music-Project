Youâve gotta be fucking kidding me!?
We are one voice â One heart!
You sound like a broken record, different words for the same old lies, You know weâll be the ones who suffer, you gain power while we pay the price.
Every time you open your mouth, you spread a disease! You try to make us voiceless, you try to make us believe, (butâ¦)
We are the many, like drops of water, Alone we are nothing, together weâre crushing.
We are the many, like a plague of locusts, Alone we are nothing, together weâre crushing.
We are the many! Alone we are nothing, together weâre crushing!
We are one voice â One heart!
Any disaster is very welcome â in the darkest days you promise the sun. Like the savior of a world in debris? Yeah right, youâve gotta be fucking kidding me!?
We are the many, like drops of water, Alone we are nothing, together weâre crushing.
We are the many, like a plague of locusts, Alone we are nothing, together weâre crushing.
We are one voice â One heart!
