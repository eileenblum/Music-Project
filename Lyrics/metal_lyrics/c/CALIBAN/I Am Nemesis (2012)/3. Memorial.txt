This is a memorial â to honor the long gone
This is a burial â my heaven has gone wrong

Those times we had â so long ago. Like yesterday â I miss âem so much â I canât let go!!!
My heart is full of hate â its bleeding love
Father â I have to say goodbye to keep my self alive
I can still see you â youâre fading away â butâ¦ I can still feel you â though youâre drifting away from me.
This is a memorial â to honor the long gone
This is a burial â my heaven has gone wrong
Are you still here â still in this place? Whatâs left behind, where is godâs grace?
You broke my faith
My heart is full of hate â itâs bleeding love Father â I have to say goodbye to keep my self alive
I can still see you â youâre fading away â but
I can still feel you â though youâre drifting away from me.
My heart is aching â thatâs all I know
Hope is fading â Iâll let you goâ¦
This is a memorial â This is a burial
