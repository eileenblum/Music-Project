Bark skin. I'm lying here. Still.
Throughts hush eyes closing repeating this moment.
Waiting for. Your abscence veils my sleep.
My dreams. I'm moving in time.
No when And yet you don't now. But my heart does.
'Cause from the first moment I was caught and
delivered a long the vanished warmth regained life in me.
Thank...you!
