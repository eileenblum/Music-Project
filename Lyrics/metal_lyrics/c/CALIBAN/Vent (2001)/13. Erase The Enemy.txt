This is a war.
Everything normal smashed.
Cruelty comes down the land and there only losers.
Fight up until the end.
Death becomes daily and the humanity boggy.
Blood flow through the streets.
Mandkind means sickness!
By the order of the devil they march and destroy [x2]
and the mind remains on the route.
Torture.
Destroy, kill, erase the enemy!!! [x4]
Give up your mind and be mechanism.
Who disobeys is hostile and enemies have got to die.
Human being or mechanism.
You've got the choice...human being.
