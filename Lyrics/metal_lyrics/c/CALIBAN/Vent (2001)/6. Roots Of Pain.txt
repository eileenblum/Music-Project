In the darkness of the night.
Being moved by the shine of the moon.
Considering and full of hope.
I'm only way to the roots of pain.
Condamned to love.
Yearning all my demanding embodied in you.
I'm imprisoned of your control to live myself.
Your eyes look so empty. I'm scared to dip in.
In fear to find the end of a love.
The time hurts with every hit and the question of your love.
I just want to love what charms me!
A small spark is a big hope!!!
