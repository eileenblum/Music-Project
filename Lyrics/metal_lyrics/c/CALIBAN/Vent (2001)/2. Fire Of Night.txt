Demons out of the darkness.
Fire of night. Allying existence of the evil.
My life? Just a game?
Dependance and mania.
Desire shows you the way.
The gates to the coldness are open.
The way back is full of stones. Just like my heart.
My existence. Identity is breaking.
The coldness keeps pulling me into it's ban.
An unbelievable size of power.
Luck ans pain are close together.
Luck or pain. The pain is ripping my life into pieces.
I'm in prison of my destiny. Too low is my energy!!!
