Deep eyes. Subdued light. Hand in hand.
In the eye of the storm [x2]
everything is flowing and discharging into us.
My mouth open. Lava flow.
Eyes close in the eye of the storm
the silence is breath taking in the eye of the storm.
Substances join. Togther immortal.
We become one in the eye of the storm.
On the way agains the truth.
A trip through light and time all problems become smashed.
All pain becomes happiness eyes open.
Scream come out. Wishes turn into pictures.
My heart stop beating.
The ban breaks Just to remember smile at me one more time.
The last time! In the eye of the storm.
