Now i'm sitting here writting about the lonelyness.
It's a bad day and the reasons for that are trivial!!!
Love taken away.
Throughts at the mercy of the past.
Destroying myself.
My inside is crying for help.
Who cares? [x3]
I forgot to live for the moment.
I don't want to be wath I'm am!
Wath will be in the future?
I don't know what to expect.
