I wake up in flames,
like everyday with my heart in my hands,
I wake up in flames,
say my name and I will rise again,

I will rise again - I will kill again, I will...
say my name and I will kill again

I wake up in flames,
like everyday with my heart in my hands,
I wake up in flames,
say my name and I will rise again,

Here is my little secret,
stay back or I will kill... kill kill

I promised you my blood,
I gave you my life,
but you threw it all away

Go, run flee
Go, run, flee - faster...

I wake up in flames
like everyday with my heart in my hands
I wake up in flames,
Say my name... again

Here is my little secret,
stay back or I will kill... kill kill
