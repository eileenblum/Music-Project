I'm there of what you dream.
I see you, but what are you?

You make me sick, eat me up.
STAND UP!
I was there where you will never be,

bits come off your shell,
but I recognize still nothing.
you change with the flow of the masses,
a thick empty shell with no content,
I keep my eyes shut, but I scream at you.
just open your eyes.

Take me up, tear me down,
but when I'm gone,
you're the one who's left
take me up, tear me down,
you're the one who's left

I can't recognize you
a bug full of standups!
