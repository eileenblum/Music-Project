Goodbye,
a word that makes me cry.
all the joy and all the fun
are suddenly gone - goodbye...

I can feel the cold steel on my shaking skin

I stand alone with my thoughts
on a crossway to neverwhere,
every end shows your tender face,

A long kiss goodbye,
in my head the distance rises,
this sheer endless time of despair-
goodbye

I can feel the cold steel on my shaking skin,
along kiss goodbye

I stand alone with my thoughts
 on a crossway to neverwhere,
every end shows your tender face,
a long kiss goodbye-
my tears flow over,
the time just fans the fire,
why can't you stay forever?
Whay can't you just pull the trigger
I wish this nightmare would end,
goodbye
