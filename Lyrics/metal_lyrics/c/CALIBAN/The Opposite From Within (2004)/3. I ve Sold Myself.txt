Don't look at me like that,
I am your creation,
my actions will teach you,
none of your tears can change me again,
It's too late for this!
what do you see and feel when you abuse me?

Don't pretend like you feel any pain
forget about it, I have no conscience,
you took that from me
and now you complain about me being cruel,

But this is exactly what you want,
you want no heart,
but this is exactly what you want,
you want no contract,

You want to play and that is what you want me for,
that's why I'm your toy, my words mean nothing,
it's on the shadow of me that I'm giving to you

But this is exactly what you want,
you want no heart,
but this is exactly what you want,
you want no contract,

I've sold myself and given me away...
let me be myself again
I've sold myself and given me away...
I want to give up this game
