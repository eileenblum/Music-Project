a long distance run without any tension
raptured soul - raptured life
a long distance run without any tension
grow in the half of a night - bloom!
live this life in straight lines
step aside, step below
watch yourself falling
flight lines, light lines become clear

slightly I remember the way -
to the origin of despair

reality is what come first

attempt to see through my eyes
careless and senseless devotion
nothingness is a part of me
on the behalf of you imagination.

The blackend curtain seems to fall,
beside the stage we lose out soul,
a different place, a distant time,
say goodbye.. SALVATION

blacken the earth and darken the sky

a long distance run without any tension
raptured soul - raptured life
a long distance run without any tension
grow in the half of a night - bloom!
live this live in straight lines
step aside, step below
watch yourself falling

WATCH YOURSELF FALLING...
