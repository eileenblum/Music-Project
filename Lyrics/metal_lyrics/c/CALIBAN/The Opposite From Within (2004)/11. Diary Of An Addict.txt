no one hears you
no one fears you
you are invisible - nothing - trace of belief

you're going blind - dazzeled by
the beauty of the day
your footsteps slowly dissappear... realease your soul

This is a diart - the diart of an addict
it's just a diary - only written words...
help me, get me out of here

your own mind leads you to this
just remembering where you are
beneath the cold and senseless... no trace of belief
help me, get me out of here

your throat swells your eyes glow
deep inside you swallow the blood
hit the darkness - feel the cold... release your soul
hel me, get me out of here

this is a diary - the diary of an addict
it's just a diary - only written words.
