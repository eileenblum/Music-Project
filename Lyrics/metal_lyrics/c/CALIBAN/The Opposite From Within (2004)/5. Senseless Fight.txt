I've got the space I need
I've got the air to breath
I've got the mood to bleed
I need to breath to bleed

this senseless fight will never end,
you teach me to forget
I can not win

I feel weak and helpless,
this prision make me sick
you teach me to forget
but forget means disrespect

this senseless fight will never end,
(will never end)
you teach me to forget
I can not win

just let me go and don't look back
while my flesh begins to burn,
just come back to bury my forsaken soul
and tell my heart goodbye!
