wake up and see the truth
it's over for sure
like the sinking of the moon

all hope seems to be gone
all lust is fading away
for the dust of forgetting

every breath aches as it was the last
every moment distored through tears

The walls have fallen down,
pure cold reality surrounds me,
is hugging me

this big, black hold inside me
screams for fulfilment and nearness
so tell me who i am - tell me lies
so tell me who I am - Give me hope
so tell me who I am - Lead me to my heart

all hope seems to be gone
all lust is fading away
for the dust of forgetting

every breath aches as it was the last
every moment distored through tears

The walls have fallen down,
pure cold reality surrounds me,
is hugging me

The awareness of emptiness
pushes me down to earth...
