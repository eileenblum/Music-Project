[Japanese Bonus Track]What i have i done,
i have broken the contract and i burn to ashes...
i ve sworn to be true to myself but i broke with me,
a pure no and everything would be allright...
but i was weak and fell deep,
the sun sets, a day goes by, beauty rises up, the day has gone...

here is my life, trapped in time
this is my life, is this my fault, trapped in time

noise tunes in, silence...
time has past, past is part of life,
( I stand still )

here is my life, trapped in time
this is my life, is this my fault, trapped in time

people pass by, pacing firm paths,
i stand still in time and burn to ashes...

thoughts of tomorrow,
knifes cut flesh,
thoughts of tomorrow,
what have i done!?
