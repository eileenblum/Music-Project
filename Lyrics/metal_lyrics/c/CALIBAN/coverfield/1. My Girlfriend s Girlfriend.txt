[Type O Negative Cover]

It's no secret we're close 
As sweaty velcro 
Like latex, fur and feathers 
Stuck together, now 

In their '62 Vette 
Sharing one cigarette 
In a black light trance then 
Go go dance, then 

They keep me warm on cold nights 
We must be quite a sight 
In our meat triangle 
All tangled, wow 

My girlfriend's girlfriend 
She looks like you 
My girlfriend's girlfriend 
She's my girl, too 

Her and me and her and she and me 
An uncrowded couple are we three 
And we don't care what people say 
When walking hand in hand down King's Highway 
Two for one today 

My girlfriend's girlfriend 
She looks like you 
My girlfriend's girlfriend 
She's my girl
