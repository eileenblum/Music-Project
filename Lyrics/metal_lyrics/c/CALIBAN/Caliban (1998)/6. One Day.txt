Cold blooded you've slaughtered the innocent
Your merciless sport is so bloody
But not for much longer

The day will come you will burn in a fire of requital
You will bleed for your dreadful actions
In the end you will whine, but there's no mercy
And there will be bloodshed
But it won't be that of the innocent

Cold bloodshed!
