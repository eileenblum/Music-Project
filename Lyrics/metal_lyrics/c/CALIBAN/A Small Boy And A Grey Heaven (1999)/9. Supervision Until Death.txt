tortured by the agony of self laceration - full of pain
and fear - my sense of self-preservation keeps me
alive - the whole way of life paved by affliction
and danger - more &amp; more I recognize the cruelty
of reality - reality the greatest plot of life
one walks - talks - sees - breathes - but doesnât
live - no - rather serve the growing edifice
that controls our so - called life - death gives
way to the living - straight into freedom
way out of this edifice
everyone a brick in this stonework
and day by day more people live in it
hour by hour their power rises
and inevitably steals our breath
