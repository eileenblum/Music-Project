blizzards reign the fires by
the pod - their cold heat set ablaze my
burning soul - embodiment at least
a fear rises - the storm clams the choires
forever - maybe even death
the birds move forward and try to escape
always following life
my fire - an ice desert - I burn
laughter experiences death
the death experiences life
