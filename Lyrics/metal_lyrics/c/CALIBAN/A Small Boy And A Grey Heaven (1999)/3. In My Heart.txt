the heaviness of my heart seems a
burden to me - whatever they preach
I have to look for people like me
ans so I have to join the wrong
unmindful of virtue I am eggier for
the pleasure of love more than for
salvation - I am seized by desire but I
have to keep the darkness night hidden
in the depth of my heart - it's the most
bitter fate - fate is against me
in love and virtue
I am heartened by my promise
I am downcast by my refusal
there is nothing I need from anyone
expect love and respect and anyone
who can't give me those two things
has no place in my life be sure before
I'll finish - I intend to celebrate this hell
I am involved in
