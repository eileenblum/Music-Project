moonlight - a glance of the moon into my
blurred eyes - the darkness gives way
to the beauty of the evening light and
in a faint moment in this sheer
endless time of despair and thought
everything seems right - but it ain't
and my soul drowns in self-pity
it's so damn hard to keep one's face
to do the right thing
moonlight - beautiful moonlight
give back my heart to me
