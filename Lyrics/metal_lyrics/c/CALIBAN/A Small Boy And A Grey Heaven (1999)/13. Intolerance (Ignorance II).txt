my hope - our world - bursting due
to the closed - minded thinking
of the shortsighters
grinning faces - watching me
scared by my individuality
but these ridiculous attempt will
only leave me stronger
I'm living for myself and not for
anyone else
my fire will burn eternally
I won't accept your intolerance
