No one is safe
No one can hide
It can happen to anyone at any time
When you cross a street
Or when you go to school
Destiny Is all around

Today could be the last day of your life
Take a break, enjoy the day
Don't throw it away

Today could be the best day of your life
Planets collide
Watch it with a smile
And do what brings you joy

Enjoy your life before it's too late
Every second something bad can happen
In the end you don't wanna look back into nothing

Accidents are everywhere and happen all the time
Don't you dare to think you're safe
Just because you watch your steps

Today could be the last day of your life
Take a break, enjoy the day
Don't throw it away

Today could be the best day of your life
Planets collide
Watch it with a smile
And do what brings you joy

Enjoy your life before it's too late

Today could be the last day of your life
Take a break, enjoy the day
Don't throw it away

Today could be the best day of your life
Planets collide
Watch it with a smile
And do what brings you joy

Enjoy your life before it's too late
Enjoy your life before it's too late
