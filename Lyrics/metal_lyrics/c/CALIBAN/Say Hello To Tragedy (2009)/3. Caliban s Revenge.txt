Today I'll take revenge for my solitary life,
For the desolation and the devastating void.
You pretend love that pushed me
Into this darkness.

I was afraid of you,
But I loved you
Until it burnt me from the inside.
I adored you, I hated you.
Sometimes my love was like a gaping hole
That tried to swallow me.

With words came lies,
You took my world apart.
Back then I learned to hate
And you taught me well.

You will hear the sound of my broken heart
Before I'll destroy you
And before you vanish into the cold void.
You'll know what you've done to me.

I was afraid of you,
But I loved you
Until it burnt me from the inside.
I adored you, I hated you.
Sometimes my love was like a gaping hole
That tried to swallow me.

With words came lies,
You took my world apart.
Back then I learned to hate
And you taught me well.
20 dark years of suffering!
