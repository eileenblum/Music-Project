How long to hold on? Through darkness I've been
So many things that I have never seen
This feeling will not live forever
I walk like the dead
Lost what I've never had

You gave me a reason to smile (smile)
To stay alive for a little while
I had these thoughts to say goodbye
Your eyes told me why

Whatever you say
Whatever you do
You keep me going on and on and on

Whatever you say
Whatever you do
You keep me going on and on and on and on

How long to hold on? Trough darkness I've been
So many things that I have never seen
This feeling will not live forever
I walk like the dead
Lost what I've never had

I would tear this world apart
Just to forget
What you meant to me

Waiting for your time to end (end)
Whats left behind
A black tangled heart

Sever your ties
I'll know your lies
So don't even start
Waiting for your time
To end when sky burns red
SKY BURNS RED!!

So many things that I have never seen
So many things that I have never seen

How long to hold on? Through darkness I've been
So many things that I have never seen
This feeling will not live forever
I walk like the dead
Lost what I've never had

I won't save you
I won't save you from your suicide
