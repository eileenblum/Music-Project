Rain of death falls down
Polluted by this so called technology
Murdering to succeed, not seeing the price that has been paid

In the name, in the name of progression

Industrial insanity forces us to follow
We die they prosper
Only in death can we stop supporting them
Only in death can they not have their way with us

In the name, in the name of progression

(If it was real progression greed world not dictate our souls
If it was real progression we'd give back everything we'd taken
If it was real progression we'd burn these lies all down)

In the name, in the name of progression
