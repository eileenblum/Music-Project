I will not forgive you for what you've done to me.
For all the lies you spread,
for all the pain you caused.
You smiled straight to my face with no shame or regret
and just told me almost perfect lies.

You used me like your toy and pretended you were a friend.
But now I know you are a liar.

You liar, go fuck yourself.
You'll never make us believe.
You liar, betray yourself.
I won't swallow your lies.

You are weak and selfish,
that's why you must hurt.
But let me tell you, you will just get burnt.

You feed on illusions and lies
and pretended you were a friend.
But now I know you are a liar.

You liar, go fuck yourself.
You'll never make us believe.
You liar, betray yourself.
I won't swallow your lies.

No lie will last forever.
You will die alone like you lived your life.

You liar, go fuck yourself.
You'll never make us believe.
You liar, betray yourself.
I won't swallow your lies.
