I'm giving up the fight,
'cause in the end they're always right.
But when you think like this,
it's almost too late
to escape their greps that controls you.

Free yourself - you will be heard.
Don't be scared - you are alive.
Broken thread - make your choice.
Stillborn thoughts - unleash your voice.

You will never be slave,
you will never be a puppet on a string.
Don't give up the fight, 'cause no one's ever right.

Believe in what you are
and you will keep your self control.
Don't believe in what they say,
you are no toy,
you are alive.

Free yourself - you will be heard.
Don't be scared - you are alive.
Broken thread - make your choice.
Stillborn thoughts - unleash your voice.

Fuck.
I will never be a slave.
