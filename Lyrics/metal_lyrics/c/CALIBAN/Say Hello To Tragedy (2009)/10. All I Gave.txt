Save your breath
I don't wanna hear
This time it's forever
Nothing you could say will ever change that
Change that!

Save your breath
I don't wanna hear
This time it's forever
Nothing you could say will ever change that
Change that!

I gave you all I have
But you betrayed all we had
Today is gonna change
Today I'm taking it all back!

Save your breath
I don't wanna hear
This time it's forever
Nothing you could say will ever change that
Change that!

Save your breath
I don't wanna hear
This time it's forever
Nothing you could say will ever change that
Change that!

I gave you all I have
But you betrayed all we had
Today is gonna change
Today I'm taking it all back!

You laid it down to rest
But it would never be the same

You laid it down to rest
But it would never be the same

It took apart myself to tell you that
I don't care
If you still do
Don't ever let me know!

It took apart myself to tell you that
I don't care

Save your breath
I don't wanna hear
This time it's forever!!
Nothing you could say will ever change that (change that!)

Save your breath
I don't wanna hear
This time it's forever!!
Nothing you could say will ever change that (change that!)
