I was born into a hell
A living nightmare
My world is not real
My world is just fraud
I never saw the sky
Neither moon nor stars
A morbid world created of misery

I will never be free from fear
I'll never be free from tears
You took my chance to live a normal life
All these years, my life
Just lies

The denegation of humanity
A declaration of horror
No salvation for my soul
Desperation till the end of time
DESPERATION!!

You created an endless hell
A place where there's no hope left
I will never be free from fear
I'll never be free from tears
You took my chance to live a normal life
All these years, my life
Just lies

I wish all darkness would fade away
I wish the sun would shine all day
The denegation of humanity
A declaration of horror
No salvation for my soul
Desperation till the end of time

DESPERATION!!
DESPERATION!!
