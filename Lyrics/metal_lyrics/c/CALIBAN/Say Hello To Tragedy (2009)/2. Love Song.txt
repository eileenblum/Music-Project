You are my world, my cage
My love, my hate
My everything!!!
When I'm blind you'll take my Hand
And lead me safe and sound

You are the one who makes me smile
You are the one who makes me cry
Next to you I feel strong
Next to you nothing feels wrong

I am here today (right now) to say I want you
I am here today (right now) to say I love you
More than you'll ever know

You give me hope for more
You show me how to fall
Today I will forget the pain
Because I know you're here

You are the one who took my fears
You give me wounds that will never disappear
Nothing you do could hurt me
But one wrong word could cause my end

I am here today (right now) to say I want you
I am here today (right now) to say I love you
More than you'll ever know

You are my world, my cage, my hate
You are my everything
You'll take my Hand and lead me, I'm blind
Lead me safe and sound

I am here today (right now) to say I want you
I am here today (right now) to say I love you
More than you'll ever know

I LOVE YOU!!!
