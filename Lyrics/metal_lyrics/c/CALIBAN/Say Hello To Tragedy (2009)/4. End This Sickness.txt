I can't take it anymore
I hate to see that people get chased away
Just because of their sense of style
I can't take it anymore
Everyone is unique in their own way

I can't take it anymore
We all have the right to choose
I can't take it anymore
Everyone has the right to be, who they want

We don't need no more bloodshed
End all sickness tonight
We don't need no hate or anger
Burn your hate inside
And I demand more respect for everyone

We need to have more tolerance
So leave your anger home and accept the facts

I don't care about your style
I can't take it anymore
I don't care how you wear your hair
I can't take it anymore
I don't care if you're straight or gay
I can't take it anymore
But I care about music
And the freedom of choice

We don't need no more bloodshed
End all sickness tonight
We don't need no hate or anger
Burn your hate inside

Free your mind
Don't be blind
Can't you see
What we need
We need to...
We need to...
End all the Sickness
...LIBERATE!

We don't need no more bloodshed
End all sickness tonight
We don't need no hate or anger
Burn your hate inside
