Can't you hear my screams?
Can't you see my desperation?
I am lying here, almost dead but still alive
I see the time passes by
I see you everyday come and go

Hoping for salvation
With tears in my eyes
End this coma!!

Hoping for a sudden death
With blood on your hands
End this coma!!

I see you everyday (everyday!)
Suffer a terrible fate
I see you everyday (everyday!)
Praying for my welfare

Help me out!
Help me out!
Help me out!
End this coma!

I can't move at all
And I can't feel any pain
This bed is my prison
And there is no act of grace
I just want to die or to wake up

Please, let me die
I don't want to live like that
End this coma!

Please, let me die
I don't want to live like that
End this coma!

I see you everyday (everyday!)
Suffer a terrible fate
I see you everyday (everyday!)
Praying for my welfare
