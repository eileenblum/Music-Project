Tell me!
How will I ever forget this
24 years of isolation?
24 years of black.
I will never forget this
24 years of separation
24 years of pain?

I will never forget this
24 years of ignorance
24 years of hate.
How will I ever forget?
Raped and used with my own blood
You stole my life and dreams.

You are my darkest fear.
I will never be the same
I will never smile again
You brought the darkness into my life
You taught me how to cry.

Why?
Why?

My inner struggle will just end when I
Take my last breath
And I will see you suffer
Until you close your eyes.
I'm just an empty shell.

I will never forget this
24 years of trepidation
24 years of lies
How will I ever forget?
You stole my innocence
And gave me living death.

Just an empty shell
I'm just an empty shell.
SHELL!

My inner struggle will just end when I
Take my last breath
And I will see you suffer
Until you close your eyes.

I will never be the same
I will never smile again
You brought the darkness into my life
You taught me how to cry.

Why?
Why?
