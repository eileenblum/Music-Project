The image of the world I live in
Born into to fall into oblivion
Is one huge arena of illusion and deceit
Nothing's real, nothing!

Curtain call and the show starts
Commonness and self-laceration
Against the unceasing hope of redemption - clowns
The masters of disguise

Are man's prototype my fear of the future increases?...

This arena is crowded with clowns
Curtain call and the show starts
Just one tear releases a violent river
