Take your god out of my life
Your words mean nothing to me
Your messages are just lies
One word, one lie

One word, one lie, one pocket full of money
How can someone die when he never existed?
A cycle of illusions crosses the land
Burn it down

Your illusions kill your mind
Pay in the name of god or pay for nothing

Lie
