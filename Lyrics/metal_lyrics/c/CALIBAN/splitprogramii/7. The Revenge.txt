You thought the worst was over
You thought my demon was dead
But the revenge has just begun...
My life for your blood

I am the avenger of the time
My sword is my witness and judge
There is no way out
There is no place to hide

Here I stand and fight for my desire
My life for your blood and fire...

Death for the rapist of my soul
One cut for each second of pain
A red sun will arise and liberate my soul
(But I will never forget the pain)...

Here I stand and fight for my desire
My life for your blood and fire...

You thought the worst was over
You thought my demon was dead
But the revenge has just begun...
My life for your blood
