The finest breeze of wind, born is the beautiful
Lonely in a wide open space
There is nothing to see of the world, only dream
Lonely in a wide open space

Nobody there to help, dead!!!...

The sun is low, the moon is high
The middle is my consciousness

The middle of day and night, a life in harmony
No fear, no pain, immortal for one moment
I'm screaming up to the sky right into infinity

Silence!
Blood overruns my body
I'm tumbling down, imminent to drown in my own blood

Nobody there to help, dead!!!
