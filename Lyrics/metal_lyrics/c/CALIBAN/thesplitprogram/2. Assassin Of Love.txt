The imagination of an unrestrained dedication, without considering the consequences and the betrayal of own ideals, just to kill my thirst, fills me with hate, the temptation to dedicate myself unrestrained to cold love, is just as big as the hate for the lust of the flesh.
The lust of flesh is an assassin of love!
Why is it so hard?
(it's so damn hard)
Emotions just ain't mechanic, the question of greed, love, past, future, anger and anxiety, I don't want to live my present in the past anymore, your past determines my reality.
