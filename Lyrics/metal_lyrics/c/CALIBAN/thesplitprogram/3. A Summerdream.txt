The finest breeze of wind, born is the beautiful, lonely in a wide open space.
There's nothing to see of the world.
Only dream.
Lonely in a wide open space, lonely.
Just to be me, only dream.
The sun is low, the moon is high and in the middle my consciousness.
The middle of day and night, no fear, no pain, immortal for one moment.
I'm screaming up to the sky right into infinity.
Silence!
Blood overruns my body, I'm tumbling down, imminent to drown in my own blood.
Nobody there to help, dead!
