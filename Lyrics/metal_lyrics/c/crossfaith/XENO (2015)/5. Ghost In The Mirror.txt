[feat. Caleb from Beartooth]I am here, so try to control me
Can you dig deep inside of me
I have been running for so long (running for so long)
How can I find myself when I keep digging through my veins
Cut up in the nightmare (in the nightmare)
Demolish myself I gotta build it up again
I'm facing you, you're facing me
Defiantly
I am the maze now I finally see (finally see)
I never knew I'm the ghost in the mirror
Your lies and soul in flames till the end
I'm staring back at the ghost in the mirror
Running in circles still
So many days I fight against you tried to ruin me
You'll never take control
Reject reject
This conscious that will bind me
Reject reject
I will never be the same
Reject reject
This conscious that will bind me
Reject reject myself
I am the maze now I finally see (finally see)
I never knew I'm the ghost in the mirror
Your lies and soul in flames till the end
I'm staring back at the ghost in the mirror
I am here, so try to control me
Can you dig deep inside of me
Open your eyes, open your eyes, open your eyes
I am not your slave
I'm facing you, you're facing me
I am the maze now I finally see
I never knew I'm the ghost in the mirror
I am the maze now I finally see (finally see)
I never knew I'm the ghost in the mirror
Your lies and soul in flames till the end
I'm staring back at the ghost in the mirror
I am not your slave
I'm the ghost in the mirror
I am not your slave
I'm the ghost in the mirror
Reject reject
This conscious that will bind me
Reject reject reject myself
