Is there an answer for all of the questions before me
Feel the sand slipping through my hands
I tried to see myself
Let go of all that I'm holding
Was it worth being left alone?
How much have I lost along the way?
Just leave me where the ashes lay
My heart still beat
Watching everything around me crushing down is it the ending
I need to feel am I living the beginning or am I just here all alone
I walk the path so long
Stare at the stars and I'm hoping for the power to calm the storm
But all the memories I see that constant repeating
Playing over inside my mind
Leave me with the sorrow from today
The bleeding never goes away
My heart still beat
Watching everything around me crushing down is it the ending
I need to feel am I living the beginning or am I just here all alone
The pain in my chest as it starts to race
A crushing blow as it lays to waste
The flash isn't all I thought it would be
There's nothing that's left here for me
My heart still beat
Watching everything around me crushing down is it the ending
I need to feel am I living the beginning or am I just here all alone
(is there an answer for all of the questions before me)
Am I just here all alone
(I walk the path so long stare at the stars and
I'm hoping)
Am I just here all alone
Stare at the stars and I'm hoping for the power to calm the storm
For the power to calm the storm
