This is the devil's party
Now I can see my body fade to gray
I can't even tell you if it's night or day
When I feel my senses take over they crawl through my body
A heavenly hell I'll stay
And I'm going down down down
But never hit the ground ground ground
Tell me everything is fine
Tell me everything is wrong
Can you hear me out (here me out)
Can you hear me out
I'm drowning alone
Wake me from the dream that I had today
Yeah just like sleeping in reality
I can see that you tried to fix me but I keep refusing
A shadow standing over me
And I'm going down down down
But never hit the ground ground ground
Tell me everything is fine
Tell me everything is wrong
Can you hear me out (here me out)
Can you hear me out
I'm drowning alone
Yeah I am drowning alone
Underwater can't keep running away from the pressure
Suffocate everything
Pull me out from the despair now
Tell me everything is fine
Tell me everything is wrong
Tell me everything is fine
Tell me everything is wrong
Can you hear me out (here me out)
Can you hear me out
I'm drowning alone
(and I'm going down down down)
Can you hear me out (here me out)
Can you hear me out
This is the devil's party
