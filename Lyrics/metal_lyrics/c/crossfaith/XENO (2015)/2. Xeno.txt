Lead me to reason

Buried the sun
All the hope, the rain
And my joy will be volatilized
It reminds us of the birthplace

Broken faith in the lost conscious
Blissfulness in a fake love
Wounded hearts as the sacrifice
Cast a light to another sun

Give me pain
Lead me to truth
Give me pain
Lead me to reason

I'm pulling out my soul to prove I'm alive
Lead me to the dawn of the new born
I'm putting up a fight and try to survive
Lead me to the dawn of the new born

Can you feel this pain?
Can you feel it pulsing?
Can you feel the end?
Can you feel the start?

Broken faith in the lost conscious
Blissfulness in a fake love
Wounded hearts as the sacrifice
Cast a light to another sun

I'm pulling out my soul to prove I'm alive
Lead me to the dawn of the new born
I'm putting up a fight and try to survive
Lead me to the dawn of the new born

I feel my soul start to fall apart
I'll be the dawn of the new born

Bring me back inside of the mother
She can cancel all of our karma
Just I hear the sound of new color
Breathing in the womb

Bring me back inside of the mother
She can cancel all of our karma
Just I hear the sound of new color
Breathing in the womb

If the past was made
To reveal what lies behind the door
All my memories fade
My rebirth

Let me live again!
Let me live again!

Let it come to an end
All the pain will be gone
Close my eyes and the sun shines on me
Bring the sin to an end
All the fear will be gone
Close my eyes and the sun shines on me

Let me live again!
Let me live again!
Let me live again!
