Everybody gets up
Turn it up, turn it up
Let me show you how we're making noise to change the world
Do it up do it up
Here is a chance to place your bet
Craving the beats, lights are dancing, raise the ceiling
Like a misfit
Where do we find what they're looking for
Yeah it's called dystopia
Dystopia, dystopia
Never back to the shiny past
Dystopia, disturbing you
It's calling out your fucking name
Dystopia, dystopia
Life on the line for entertainment
Dystopia despising you
It's never gone no stopping it now
Let it out? Let it out
Nobody cares what you do in a living hell
Burn it down, burn it down
Count 321 are you ready for this
Ready to roll I'm in trouble so learn from the lines cause d is so dope
You wanna know about me
Don't need a plan live for today
Fuck the world we beat the world
Time to act it's do or die
Take this bottle down I wanna see you jump
Knock the world yeah shake the world
Everybody wanna get yourself high
Dystopia, dystopia
Never back to the shiny past
Dystopia, disturbing you
It's calling out your fucking name
Dystopia, dystopia
Life on the line for entertainment
Dystopia despising you
It's never gone no stopping it now
Everybody wanna get yourself high
Fuck the world, we beat the world
Everybody needs it now, it's like gold like a legacy
Knock the world shake the world
Cause if it's in your hands look around there's enemies
Fuck the world, we shake the world
Time to act it's do or die
Knock the world shake the world
Everybody wanna get yourself high
Dystopia, dystopia
Never back to the shiny past
Dystopia, disturbing you
It's calling out your fucking name
Dystopia, dystopia
Life on the line for entertainment
Dystopia despising you
It's never gone no stopping it now
