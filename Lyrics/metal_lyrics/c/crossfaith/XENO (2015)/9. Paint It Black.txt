It's time for us to change
Time to be brave
Time to be strong
Time to come back from the nightmare created to keep you in a cage
It's time to break out
We can't go back from here on out our lives are changed
We won't back down attack and paint it black on your fucking faces
We will be back to end the fight that you begin
This is not a test and we are ready for this war
Come out of hiding after being pushed to the edge
This is the chance to change will never be the same
Tonight tonight we start a fight
To bring us back from the nightmare
Tonight tonight tonight we're coming
Tonight tonight tonight
You can't go back and close my eyes you can't be saved
You're going down attack and paint it black on their fucking faces
You turn your back this time there is no saving grace
This is not a game and we are ready for this war
Come out of hiding after being pushed to the edge
This is the chance to change will never be the same
Tonight tonight we start a fight
To bring us back from the nightmare
Tonight tonight tonight we're coming
Tonight tonight tonight
Tonight tonight we start a fight
We're standing here on the front line
Tonight tonight tonight are you ready
Tonight tonight tonight
Can you hear the voice of struggle
Nothing left to do
You're forced into a corner
Now is our time to break out
Break out!
Come out of hiding after being pushed to the edge
This is the chance to change will never be the same
Tonight tonight we start a fight
To bring us back from the nightmare
Tonight tonight tonight weâre coming
Tonight tonight tonight
Tonight tonight we start a fight
We're standing here on the front line
Tonight tonight tonight are you ready
Tonight tonight tonight
