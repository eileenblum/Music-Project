Meet one last time at our old place
How did we let this fade away
Tie up loose ends with simple smiles
I lost the key, you lost it too
You're walking right past me, pretend to be happy
Cause I'm still trying to find, when we were doing fine
I watch the rain wash away all my senses.
Tears fall where once I held your hand
Hear the echo of a melody
Will I find a way to be without you
In the mirror watch you drive away
It's hard to swallow still the same
Carry regrets about what I said
You hold my key but I lost you
You're moving on past me, pretend to be happy
Cause I'm still trying to find, when we were doing fine
I watch the rain wash away all my senses.
Tears fall where once I held your hand
Hear the echo of a melody
Will I find a way to be without you
Tears fall
All alone is where I stand
You cry the final melody
Can I find a way
Can I find it somewhere else
I can't find it, can't find it somewhere else
Tears fall where once I held your hand
Can you cry for me again
Tears fall where once I held your hand
Hear the echo of a melody
Will I find a way to be without you
Tears fall
(you're walking right past me, pretend to be happy)
Tears fall
(cause I'm still try to find)
All alone is where I stand
You cry the final melody
Can I find a way
Can I find it somewhere else
I can't find it, can't find it somewhere else
