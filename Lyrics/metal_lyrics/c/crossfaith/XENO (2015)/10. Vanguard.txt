Blindfolded empty hearts
They are marching on the line
You feed them a imitated love and decorated lies
âGo follow the light then all the fear will be goneâ
âDon't follow the liesâ
Stand on your own
We are not the marching dead
Come one, come all get out of my head
Wake up tonight!
We were born to lead not follow
Lost in the fight
Find myself inside hollow looking glass
I see the power and the fame are falling
We never follow your system is failing
We are not the marching dead
Come one, come all get out of my head
Wake up tonight
We were born to lead not follow
Lost in the fight
Take me far beyond the hollow cause
I've given all I have to break the cycle of living in the past
Beyond the looking glass
Wake up and change the pace
Before your life has gone and passed away
Singing woah woah oh oh
Stand up and leave this place.
There's nothing left, it always stays the same
Sing it woah oh oh oh
Wake up and change the pace
Before your life has gone and passed away
Singing woah woah oh oh
Wake up! We were born to lead! Wake up!
