Introducing to you the ultimate collaboration
Crossfaith and skindred (wildfire)
Together we deliver (wildfire)
Wake up ride on the lion
Won't stop you can't deny it
Step up while your mind is blowing
Turn it up and jump around
You're stuck on the words they say
Talk shit while you paid to play
I don't give a fuck who is to blame
Hit the lights and set the fire
We got you're wildfire
We got you're burn
When it's my turn I'm gonna roar like a predator
I wanna raise the temperature
Leave all the fear
Dance on the beat
Inhale the smoke cause you're feeling free
Ready to learn
Come on let the fire burn
Boom boom we set the fire
Boom boom with your desire
Boom boom jumping higher
Let's go
Scream out loud we are the wildfire
We burn and we burn
Join our ride we are the wildfire
We dance in the flame
Out of control we will burn this place
Wipe that smile right off your fucking face
Can't out this fire no
This fuse is set to blow
These no controlling this
You started this now watch us go
Are you feeling okay
You feeling the flame
We got the groove from the Newport, UK
Let me see what you got
Show you what's hot
Now represent we are the lads from Osaka
Boom boom we set the fire
Boom boom with your desire
Boom boom jumping higher
Let's go
Scream out loud we are the wildfire
We burn and we burn
Join our ride we are the wildfire
We dance in the flame
Scream out loud
Cause we mash you with drum and the bass and the sound of the place in it
Join our ride
Scream out loud
Now we kill you with drum and the bass and the sound of the place in it
Join our ride

Are you ready for the burn before the buzz
Set it all on fire gonna tell them once again
Are you ready for the
The fucking wildfire
Scream out loud we are the wildfire
We burn and we burn
Join our ride we are the wildfire
We dance in the flame
