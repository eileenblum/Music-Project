Is this what you get ?
Is this happening to you and me ?
Where's your destination ?
When does it start ?
Is this what you get ?
Is this happening to you and me ?
Where's your destination ?
How does it feel ?
Let me know

And I'm feeling it's all right
Searching for your light
Want your echo one more time
But this world should keep away from you
Right now
You choose right or wrong

You find these words
See them and you will be able to sympathize
Where does this my feeling go ?
Everything everything I believe
Someday I get to you

Eyes, tell me a story
Saying goodbye made us apart
Now I spell words for you
We're torn up by a way of us
I can't reject yourself
Now this memory my everything faded day by day
Is this what you get ?
Still I reject it
Is this happening to you and me
My feet have gone to numb

I'm back to memory, melody
And anything of you and me

Do we walk on such a destiny ?
No ! This world can't save me now
Though I knew such a thing I'll wait for you

So here I am
Where's your heart ?
Can you hear my finger taps ?
Now time to erase the shape of the past
You're not back to me again

And I'm feeling it's all right
Searching for your light
Want your echo one more time
But this world should keep away from you

I'm back to memory
Melody and anything of you and me

No !
This word can't save me now
Leave for you
