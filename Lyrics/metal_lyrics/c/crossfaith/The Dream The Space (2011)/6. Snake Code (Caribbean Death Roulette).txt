On the card game table
We crash crash and cut cut, win tonight
Don't lose you're flavour
Yeah don't forget to stay cool, sir
Not that I'm wrong
Don't be afraid
In your scary voice don't call my name
Every night, every fight, every fucking kiss
Can't help to grow old, we can start again
Did you buy a fake empty clap ?
Did you run from enemy ?
Can't help to grow old, we can start again
Don't waste your fucking time
Yeah, now I've nothing left to lose

Are you here tonight ? Won't die
Then I crawl into some blood
Getting closer, dig in deeper
Does it make you feel like dead ?
Come on (we know)
Can't go back (time to go)
Show me what you got
This is the secret all we know
We living on our snake code

So we are out of control
And crash each other
So we are out of control

Are you here tonight ? Won't die
Then I crawl into some blood
Getting closer, dig in deeper
Does it make you feel like dead ?
Come on (we know)
Can't go back (time to go)
Show me what you got
This is the secret all we know
We living on our snake code

We are born for this time
So we rise and dance together
Dance like a dead
We love others on and on
You don't turn back now

Are you here tonight ? Won't die
Then I crawl into some blood
Getting closer, dig in deeper
Does it make you feel like dead ?
Come on (we know)
Can't go back (time to go)
Show me what you got
This is the secret all we know

You came home tonight
So we are living n the edge
One more time to die
You have taken our snake code right
