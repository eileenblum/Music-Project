It's an omen

Oh now

It's an omen
It's an omen

Now the writing's on the wall
It won't go away
It's an omen
You just run an automation

Now the writing's on the wall
It won't go away
It's an omen

It's an omen
It's an omen

Now the writing's on the wall
It won't go away
It's an omen
You just run an automation

It's an omen
Now

It won't go away

Writings on the wall
Writings on the wall
Writings on the wall

Now the writing's on the wall
It won't go away
It's an omen
You just run an automation

Now the writings on the wall
It won't go away
It's an omen

It's an omen
It's an omen

Now the writing's on the wall
It won't go away
It's an omen
You just run an automation

Now it's an omen
Now it's an omen
Now it's an omen
Now it's an omen
