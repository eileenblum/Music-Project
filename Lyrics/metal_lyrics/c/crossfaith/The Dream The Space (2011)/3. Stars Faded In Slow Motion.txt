Why?
You never notice
You lied every time

Why did you crush me down?
Why me?
Tell me how to wake up
I've waited for you to come
Ticking clock made me frozen out
Recall it, you said to me
"I'm waiting and watching stars"
Your star was broken
Your star was broken
You said that I'm simple
Must get back to my life
Can't be part of your life

This is for you
This is for your
Love is beating fast but you never noticed it
Tears me wants you to kill me
Before I fail in you
My curse and it's over
You never noticed it
Tears me
Want you to save me
And the love like faded stars

Memory is beautiful I see
Tragedy has come to to tell me
Tell me
Tell me of your lies

Why did you crush me down?
Why me?
Tell me how to wake up
I've waited for you to come
Ticking clock made me frozen out
Come to me, follow this
Forgiveness
I get it off on your chest now
Beacuse you touch my glass of emptiness
I want to share my love

It's painted false
You never know the same
Tells me, what's killing me
So I tell you
My curse and it's over
You'll never know the same
Steals me
What's telling me that tomorrow
I bring these stars

We came back to my life
We both didn't know it's everything about us
We can't never stop stars fading
I'm screaming
Daylight is dreaming
Your screaming is sad and beautiful for me

Your star will come back homeÂ 
The star will never shine before
I'll be always searching for forever
No reply
