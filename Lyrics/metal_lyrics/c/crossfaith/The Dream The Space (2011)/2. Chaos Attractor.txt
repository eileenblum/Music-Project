Playing like a God
Dedicating our soul insane
I am your disaster
Time to wake up
Let me know that you're true
Give off your answer
Can't reward, and can't reset
your time to wake up

You're wearing my mistakes
You can't reject it
It's not time to talk of waste
You cannot lie now
about where we come to fall behind
It's not time to talk of waste
You cannot die

I have just slept away me without you
At night, I can't see the moon
Stop! Wake me up until the end

This is the chaos attractor
We're just points and lines
We've never comes across the line
Time to wake up
I'm not your prisoner
I will break it down
I will cut it down tonight

Brace yourself
Back to start now
Though we lost sound
there's something of your lies
I can't forget that
Brace yourself
Here I am and start to stand
Break the silence now
I gotta go

This is the chaos attractor
we're just points and lines
We've never come across the line
I'm not your prisoner
I will break it down
Is this the end?

Is this the start?
