I'm crawling down to the middle of where you writhe beautiful
I devour what you give me, is that your sin?
I'm going down to the middle of where you writhe
This flavor is never, never going away

Bring the madness, bring the madness
Bring the madness, everybody rage on
Bring the madness, bring the madness
Bring the madness, everybody rage on

Bring the madness, tell me why you rage on
Bring the madness, tell me why you rage on

Come on, come on, come on
Sake me up
Come on, come on, come on
Scream out loud

I think I'm gonna let you break me down
This is a warning, I know it's a warning
I hear the siren screaming with your sound
This is a warning, I know it's a warning

Bring the madness, everybody rage on
Bring the madness, tell me why you rage on
Bring the madness, everybody rage on

Come on, come on, come on
Sake me up
Come on, come on, come on
Scream out loud

I think I'm gonna let you break me down
This is a warning, I know it's a warning
I hear the siren screaming with your sound
This is a warning, I know it's a warning

You are always pulling me under
As I sink into the sea
My lungs are poisoned
Starved hard to breathe
It never goes away
It never fades away
It never dissappears
You're drowning my heart

I'm crawling down to the middle of where you writhe beautiful
I devour what you give me, is that your sin?
I'm going down to the middle of where you writhe
This flavor is never, never going away

I think I'm gonna let you break me down
This is a warning, I know it's a warning
I hear the siren screaming with your sound
This is a warning, I know it's a warning

This is a warning!
