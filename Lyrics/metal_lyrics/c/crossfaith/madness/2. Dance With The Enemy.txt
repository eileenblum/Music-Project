Listen up I feel alright, but I'm sick, sick, sick of the lies
Turn it up so you can hear the truth
Now we're taking over the stereo

We're stuck in the darkest place
Our world is buried in sand
I need to breath in and breath out the air
We're all ready to wake up (wake up)

Oh step outside feeling alive
Tonight I will dance with the enemy
Yeah we're ready to go, breaking the law
Tonight I will dance with the enemy
With the enemy

How the fuck are you feeling tonight?
Just give me something to get me higher
If you feel it, come and join our side
So let's end their selfishness

We're stuck in tha darkest place
The world is buried in sand
I need to breath in and breath out the air
We're all ready to wake up (wake up)

Oh step outside feeling alive
Tonight I will dance with the enemy
Yeah we're ready to go, breaking the law
Tonight I will dance with the enemy

Go!
Want to live?
Want to dance?
Want to break everything that you hate?
Want to love?
Want to hate?
Want to get everything that you want?

We are the chosen to be opressed
We are so willing to be possesed
We are the chosen to be opressed
And we will feel alive

Oh step outside feeling alive
Tonight I will dance with the enemy
Yeah we're ready to go, breaking the law
Tonight I will dance with the enemy
Tonight I will dance with the enemy
Tonight I will dance with the enemy
With the enemy
