I just wanna see the light and I know everything is lost, everything is gone
I just wanna see the light and I know everything is lost, everything is gone

I am surviving, living in darkness
I am surrounded, someone rescue me

Take my hand, a storm is coming
Come with me, it's crashing down

I will keep on screaming "save our souls" ("save our souls")
I will never let you fall (I'm screaming "save our souls")
("Save our souls")

So isolated in a dead silence
You're barely breathing "is anybody listening"

Take my hand, a storm is coming
Come with me, it's crashing down

I will keep on screaming "save our souls" ("save our souls")
I will never let you fall (I'm screaming "save our souls")
I will keep on breathing til it's gone (til it's gone)
I could never let you go (I'm screaming "save our souls")

Save our souls!

Now it's time to wake up, the world is crashing down
It takes all my senses, I can not waste my chances
If everything is lost and everything is gone
I will keep beleiving, I'll never let you be alone

I just wanna see the light and I know everything is lost, everything is gone
I just wanna see the light and I know everything is lost, everything is gone

I will keep on screaming "save our souls" ("save our souls")
I will never let you fall (I'm screaming "save our souls")
I will keep on breathing til it's gone (til it's gone)
I could never let you go (I'm screaming "save our souls")

Save our souls!
Save! Save our souls!
