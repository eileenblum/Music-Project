Save me from this light
You lost your sense of feelings
And you say goodbye
I'll go back when you're falling down

Will you leave far from me
Is a prisoner
We can't refuse to stay
Remind yourself
I show you what you have given me
Will you tell me this?
Save me from the truth again
Time is passing by
I know the world brings you down

Show me the way you're calling me
But we can't refuse to stay in your womb
Why you try to say goodbye
Fall to the same mistakes
She does not make a sound
Against the sorrow

Why do you choose the way?
The darkness of your heart inside
This is inevitable
So why don't you trust yourself?

We are, we are existence
The day that you wasted
Will never make you smile again
When you fall I just stand aside
You can't resolve
Though make one step forward
The burden brings you back
It brings you down

Why you fall down and feel the fear
It won't save your soul
You better set it in motion
Why you fall down and feel the fear
It won't save your soul
You better set it in motion
Why you fall down and feel the fear
It won't save your soul
You better set to be back
Yeah to be back
Yeah!

Shake your brain turn upside down
Why you fall down and feel the fear
It won't save your soul
You better set it in motion
This is not time to listen
When you're falling down
We are back

Shake your brain turn upside down
Will we go back to start again?

We are, we are existence
The day that you wasted
Will never make you smile again
When you fall I just stand aside
You can't resolve though make one step forward
The burden brings you back
It brings you down
It brings you down
The burden brings you back
It brings you down
Yeah!
