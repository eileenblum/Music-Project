[Words: Kenta Koie, music: Crossfaith]

WE ARE THE WAVE AND YOU'RE THE LOST SHEEP.
SOULS FLOATING WITH DEATH AT THE SEA.
YOU (GOTTA) SAIL FOR YOUR LIFE WITH THE HANDS IN THE NIGHT.

NOW WE CAN'T ERASE SHADE OF US HIDE AWAY.
THINGS WE CAM HAVE ARE TWO, THEY'RE SWORD AND SHIELD.
THEY TEAR "TEAR ME" THEY TEAR US APART.
WE FOLLOW THE SIGN AND RUNAWAY FROM THE WAVE.

ON AND ON AND ON, WE PAY TO THE PUNISHMENT.
WE GONNA SCREAM FOR THE BROKEN HEARTED.
ON AND ON AND ON, IT TAKES WHAT YOU NEED.
WE MUST SURVIVE FOR EVERYTHING AND IT WILL GRIND US DOWN.

STORMS (ARE) COMING IN FRONT OF US.
WE FOLLOW THE SIGN.
BENEATH THE PRESSURE, WE SINK DOWN.

NOW WE CAN'T ERASE SHADE OF US HIDE AWAY.
THINGS WE CAM HAVE ARE TWO, THEY'RE SWORD AND SHIELD.
THEY TEAR "TEAR ME" SINK INTO THE OCEAN.
RAIN HIT THE FACE OF THE SEA, FROM HERE I CAN SEE IT.

WITH LOST SOULS ALOUND ME.
THE WAVES SWALLOW US ALL.
I WILL NEVER STEP IN THIS FUCKING GRAVE.

WE FOLLOWED THE SIGN.
MANY THINGS ARE LEFT BEHIND.
AND I KNOW THIS PLACE IS NOT THE END FOR ME.

WE FOLLOWED THE SIGN.
WE'LL BE BACK AND SAIL AGAIN.
WE'LL LIGHT UP THE SKY.
SO LET'S SING FOR THEM.

CRIED AND TEARS ARE FALLING DOWN, IT WAS BURNED INTO MY EYES.
NOW WE CARRY ON WEE SEE, WE SEE A LIGHT AHEAD.
WE SEE A LIGHT AHEAD.
