[Words: Kenta Koie, music: Crossfaith]

DON'T STOP RUNNING AND DON'T STOP BREATHING.
SOMEONE HOLDS YOU BACK LIKE A NIGHTMARE.
EVERY TIME I USED TO BE STUCK IN VAIN.
A THOUSAND NEEDLES LIKE POURING RAIN.
DON'T STOP THINKING, DON'T STOP FEELING, DON'T CLOSE YOUR EYES.
THIS IS THE BIGINNING, NOW IT'S WAKING UP!

EYES TELL ME WHAT I SEE, I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH A GREAT DIVIDE.
IT'S COMING CLOSE AND I'M HAUNTED.

DON'T STOP THINKING, DON'T STOP FEELING.
DON'T CLOSE YOU EYES.
I KNOW THIS GATE IS OPEN.
TELL ME WHAT IT IS, SOMEONE SHOWS ME.

I SHOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN, WHAT YOU CALL THIS, A NIGHTMARE.
I'VE FELT BEFORE.
BITE ME THEN IT'S COMING CLOSER.
I CAN'T REFUSE IT.

"NOW IT'S WAKING UP, SO YOU SHOULD STAY".
I'VE WAITED FOR THIS CONCEPTION.

IF I CAN'T TURN BACK, I TIED YOU TO A CHAIR.
DON'T SHUT YOUR EYES.
I WAIT FOR MYSELF TO BE AWAKE.

I FEEL YOU FOR THE FIRST TIME.
DON'T SET ME FREE.
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANTED TO GIVE ME.
I'LL BE DROWNING.

I SHOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN, WHAT YOU CALL THIS, A NIGHTMARE.
BITE ME THEN IT'S COMING CLOSER.

I SHOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN, WHAT YOU CALL THIS, A NIGHTMARE.
I'VE FELT BEFORE.
BITE ME THEN IT'S COMING CLOSER.
I CAN'T REFUSE IT.

THIS IS WHO I AM, AND I SEE.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN.
