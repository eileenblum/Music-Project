I lost my place in lives
Even in the morning
I see the sun goes down
Whatever you say âI leave the dream here right nowâ

You know (I'm gone)
Won't stop (stay here)
Tell me what do you want what you want me to be
My skin (you touch)
This way (I seek)
I'm hiding away
Hiding away from you

Now break away
Your weapons of hate will crush all the hearts that you've won
Right away
There was nothing to change
Nothing can change what you've done
I break away with the past
Why won't you say it ?
Now I won't let you down
Destroy the weapons of hate

I heard your voice through my body and soul
We may have been running the fucking circle
I break it all
You point a gun at my head
We stand against the door
Break away
Injecting the void
It's running my head
Brace yourself
I'm hiding away
Hiding away from you
We cut code
Come together

Now break away
Your weapons of hate will crush all the hearts of the people you've won
Right away
There was nothing to change
Nothing can change what you've done
I break away with the past
Why won't you say it ?
Now I won't let you down
Destroy these weapons of hate

Now the bullet has entered your gun
I want you to point a gun on my head
You have to pull the trigger
Just shoot and don't slip away

Now break away
Your weapons of hate will crush all the hearts you've won
Right away there was nothing to change
Nothing can change what you've done
I break away
