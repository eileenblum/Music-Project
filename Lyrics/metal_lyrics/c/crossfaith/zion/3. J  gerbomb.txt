I woke up by a phone call
Neon lights
Lose your mind and drive down the street
Weâre hanginâ at the parking lots
But things that you said itâs running in my head

Drink all day!
Stay away!
So let's burn this out the frustrated

I bleed out while Iâm singing
Throw out the things what youâve given me
Tonight Iâll drink all of you with jÃ¤gerbomb!

All the things that you said are surrounding me
This time I throw them away
All the things that you said are surrounding me
Forget yourself
Dance with me

Listen up!
All of my friends and enemies
No one can put back the clock so make my day
I wanna see you fucking move

We wanna trip into night without single care.
We're gonna party for the rest of our lives.

I'm counting the empty glasses.
More shots! more sound!
How about another one?
We're hanging out on the floor.
I drink up again and it's running in my head.

Drink all day! stay away!
So let's burn this out the frustrated.

I bleed out while I'm singing.
Throw out the things what you've given me.
Tonight I'll drink all of you with jÃ¤ger fucking bomb!

All the things that you said are surrounding me.
This time I throw them away.
All the things that you said are surrounding me.
Forget yourself, dance with me.

We having fucking good time.
This is the song of jÃ¤gerbomb.
"Why don't you take a drink and chug it!"

I bleed out while I'm singing.
Throw out the things what you've given me.
Tonight I'll drink all of you with jÃ¤ger fucking bomb!
