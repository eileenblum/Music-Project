We are the hounds
We will surround you
We need your soul and fucking bones
You can't defeat me
Stop praying!
Because praying won't save your life
It's just like suicide
Praying won't save your life
It's just like suicide

Try to feed me something tasty
Spit it in your face
We refuse all your gestures
Done with all that shit

Take it all
Take it all
Take it all
From my enemies

We, we are the ones still alive
You, you will not survive

Blaze it up
Blaze it up
Blaze it up
It's the sign from us

We, we are the ones still alive
You, you will not survive

Feel this pain and it proves we're alive
In this world of compromise
Yes, we'll always refuse it
We will break all counterfeit

Fight for pride and destination
In the middle of complications
Even if no one understands
Watch us go and leave us be

Try to feed me something tasty
Spit it in your face
We refuse all your gestures
Done with all that shit

Take it all
Take it all
Take it all
From my enemies

We, we are the ones still alive
You, you will not survive

Blaze it up
Blaze it up
Blaze it up
It's the sign from us

We, we are the ones still alive
You, you will not survive

[3x]
We are the hounds 
You are the sheep

[2x]
We're gonna eat you alive

Snapping and tracking
And we are attacking
And gonna devour your sweet underbelly

This is your last breath
Welcome to death
You better give in, give in, give in, give it up

We are the hounds
