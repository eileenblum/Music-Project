I Can Not Stand Your Lies I'll Bring You To Fucking Hell
You Caused Me Total Disaster I'm Over Your Fucking Around
I Just Wanna Pay You Back For Putting Me Through This Shit
So I Draw The Line Around Your Neck To Cut Your Fucking Throat

How Did You Feel Making A Fool Of?
Now That I Hear The Sound Of Your Regret

Your Evil Lies Set The Fire It Will Burn Everything
How Can I Know? How Can I Trust? How Can I Set The Fire?
Lies Lies Lies We're Gonna Burn These Down
Burn Burn Burn With All Our Hate
Lies Lies Lies

Set The Timebomb It Your Month

Do We Need More Conversation? Your Always Waste My Time
Reach Out Prepare All Those Around You It's Time To Say Goodbyes
Flame Of The Anger In My Hand But I'll Give You Enough Time To Regret Until I Set The Fire 4.3.2.1

Your Evil Lies Set The Fire It Will Burn Everything
How Can I Know? How Can I Trust? How Can I Set The Fire?
Lies Lies Lies We're Gonna Burn These Down

I Think You Don't Quite Understand
I Have Told You A Thousand Times
How Can I Make Myself Clear
I'll Give You One Last Chance

No! What I Mean Is You're Better Off Dead!!
