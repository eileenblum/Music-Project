As The Shadows Fall Down We Go Underground To The Place We Rock And Roll
I'm Gonna Need Your Help This Ain't Gonna Rock Be Itself.
Inside The Crowd, Let It All Out, Until The Sunrise Comes
We Can Rock The Party Out
Till The Morning!

Howl And Shout You Need To Burn This Mother Down
Scream And Shout You Need To Bounce Or Get Right Out!

Oh, Man I Want To Break All The Rules Tonight
You Have No Excuse Blow Up The Dance Floor
We're Gonna Say What Fuck The System
Drop! Drop! Drop! Drop! Drop The Beat Down On Jungle Beat

Take A Look Around People Step In Here To Forget Thier Fear
Can't You Here Thier Howling And Screaming? To Let It All Out For This Night You're Gone

Oh, Won't You Tell Me What I Want To Hear That We Will Last Forever
In The Night I Here The Echo Just Wanna Keep This Going Never Ending
You Make Me High, High, High Like The Stars
So Stay All Night, Night, Night Till The Sunrise
Touch The Sky Sky Sky With Diamonds
This Night Will Never End
