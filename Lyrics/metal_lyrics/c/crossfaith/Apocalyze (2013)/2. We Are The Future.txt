I Can't Look Back
I Know I'm Gonna Stray Today
Struggiing With The Dark
I Must Cut These Chains Arround Me
I Found Everything I Now Stand For
Engraved In My Soul(In My Soul)
I Don't Wanna Live As The Dead
So I'm Gonna Cross This Line

Your Lies Are Polluting This Life We Are Living It's Haunting Me
I'm Feeling I'm Drowning In Guilt That I Fight Each And Everyday

So It Ends Right Here And Here It Starts
I Can't Go Back To Memories(To Memories)
Even Though I Don't Know Where My Hope Has Gone,
It Ain't Gonna Stop Me
It Ends Right Here The End Of Misery Here It Starts I Never Look Back
The Battle For All I Believe In
So Now This Is Time To Go

This Is The War
We Are The Future
I Gotta Run Run Run To My Future
