I Repent Of My Sins, I'm Gonna Tell You A Story Now
I Killed you Because Of All My Love

I Used to Call It Love But She Tumbled Off The End
Because Of All My Love I Know I Did Can't Be Forgiven
My Guilty And Insanely Sick Crawl Beneath The Surface
Filled My Heart With Your Blood That's Pouring

Now Your Curse Is Branded On My Back!

Kill Me(Kill Me)Kill My Heart With your Broken Soul
Hate Me!(Hate Me)Hate This Love This Love Is Burning Me To Death...

This Man Has Gone Brind By Love And He Tumbled Off The End
"What A Fool..." He Told Me A Fable With A Face Like The Devil
One Thing I Won't Believe
This Was Not A Story Of Thire Love

"Oh How Should I Repent?"
There's No Way To Heaven You'll Go Right To Hell

I Repent Of My Sins Our Love Fell To Pieces
This Sorrow Keep Burning My Heart
Hate This Love(Hate Him)
Kill My Soul(Kill Him)
Yes! Is This Not The Truth?
Give Me Love, Pain, Hate, Despair, Her Sorrow, Shame And Blood Is Falling To The Ground

I Repent Of My Sins I'm Gonna Tell You A Story Now
I Killed you Because Of All My Love

I Smothered Our Fire With What I've Believe In
This Curse Is Branded On My Back
I'll Walk Alone I'll Roam I'm Seeking
With My Hands I Killed Your Love
