Wake Me Up!
This Virtual Is Morphing It's More Than A Vision
Please Sing To Me
This Dream Is Pulsing But I Can't Hold You Now

I'm Falling Down I'm Feeling Your Hollow Emotions
I'm Becoming Your Veins You Swim In My Head
âI Sink More Into Youâ
Do You Remember? The Days Are Fading Without you (Without You)
My Anxious Heart Baby Can you Fell It?
I Sink More Into You

I Won't Forget All Your Crying
Your Voice Lights Up All My Memories
You Start To fade Did I Love You?
I'm So Far Away From You
You're So Far Away From where I Need You To Be
Take Me With you
I Need You Here With Me

Wake You Up, Wake You Up
I'll Wake You Up I'm Gonna Save You Now
I'll Wake You Up I'm Gonna Save You...
