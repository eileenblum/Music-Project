We'll Live Forever
Let's Shout Together
You're The Only One

You Can Stand Here Where You Want As A Wayfarer
No One Knows Where You Belong
You're Up Against The Wall Then You Strike It Over And Over Again
On The Way To Your Destination, Everything Could Really Happen.
Be Harder, Be Stronger, To Make It Own Our Way

We'll Live Forever Even Though The Storm Came Down
My Soul Is Still Burning On And We'll Stand Again We'll Stand Again For As
Let's Shout Together As If We're Burning White
They Can Never Change Your Ways
Becuse The Only One You're The Only One

Save All The Victims From Disaster Killing Fear Through Out The Day
They Come With Heartlessness We'll Push Them To The Edge
Save All The Victims From Disaster Killing Fear Through Out The Day
Keeping A Sharp Focus On Them Never Look Away

When I Find Myself Passing Time
Sometimes It's Just So Dark Inside This Lonliness
So We Share One Soul Together
Until The Day We Die We Just Sing Forever
