[Music: Crossfaith, Lyric: Crossfaith]

Please explain
I am still looking for answer. I just want to know
You can never be my memory/you can never be my time
You told me goodbye your lies were so beautiful
Distrust.My mistake are and thorn destroyed the love

I cut my fuckin throat within my jealousy
My breathe is leaking from my wound
You cut my fuckin throat.It's like your vengeance
Stop bleeding.And I go back to the starting point

Stop bleeding!Before I be empty/I can't pick up the pieces
My hands pluck your arm

The meaning of your last words/I know you made a fiction
So I was afraid of you/so I was broken for you
Fiction in my hope/I know that you can't see my eyes and lies
For me/Fiction in hope
I know that you can't see my eyes and your own lies

We fall down/We fall down into dark
For our broken love died tonight
Love falling down tonight
Why Why me
You put me under pressure but
Not enough
Your hands around my throat
I tried to hold on my hope
I send you fucking pieces of love

The meaning of your last words/I know you made a fiction
So I was afraid of you/so I was broken for you
Fiction in my hope/I know that you can't see my eyes and lies
For me/Fiction in hope
I know that you can't see my eyes and your own lies
