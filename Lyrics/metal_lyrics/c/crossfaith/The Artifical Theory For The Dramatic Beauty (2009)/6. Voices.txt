[Music: Crossfaith, Lyric: Crossfaith]

Wake up those lost words
You kill someone voices/can you hear my scream
You find my shades
Why think you why
Why you hides the lost these words
Sun find it out/find it out now

You stop at the sorrow
I hope scratch inside my head
And can't step behind in the like stong my heartache
I hope you cry and scream like me

How do you runaway
How do you break
How do you disappear
I tell it all
Pay back the pain to you right now
Your blood poring to your scars
This game is already over

We sing it/we fight it
It is for me
You regret/through my words/you no way out
I try say can you help me but you betrayed of my words
Voice,scream,inside of me
