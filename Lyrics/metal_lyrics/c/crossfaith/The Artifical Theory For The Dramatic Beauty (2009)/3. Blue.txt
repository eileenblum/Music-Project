[Music: Crossfaith, Lyric: Crossfaith]

Your like your lifestyle/your wearing cheap pride
Fake talking kill me/I'm sick of your humanity
I know your fake coward/but you oppose it
You will keep crying shut me/I break your make strongest wall

You pay to me

I was killed by lies/you forget it
I was killed by a contract/break it
Burning birds flying in the sky/you never watch me
Let's show it on you/this world that you reject

Spinning it around it

Taste the blood like cold pain blue
And it's time/it's time too late
Running forever like cold pain blue
And it's time/it's time too late

Your like your lifestyle/your wearing cheap pride
Fake talking kill me/I'm sick of your humanity
Your word is tone deaf/I think your everything is meaningless
Just fake empire/ I trust myself and stand up

Lies killing me/lies burning all of made it
Can you listen to/these words
Pride of me
Worst enemy/too late
We set fire
Can you listen to/these words
Pride of me

Goddamn

Taste the blood like cold pain blue
And it's time
