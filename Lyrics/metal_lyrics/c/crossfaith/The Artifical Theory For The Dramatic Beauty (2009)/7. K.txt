[Music: Crossfaith,  Lyric: Crossfaith]

Today is new beginning / we never stop days coming
Are you ready for starting today
Always never come back yesterday / we're always bleeding
Time never kill my life

we never stop days coming / cry, anger, pain is proof of life
same days same people fuckin' days same things again and again!Â­

we break it, we made it, we must die for we try to live, but this is so hard
you give up, you run out, you kill your dream and our dreams
come on!Â­

why you cry this time and so you say "Do you believe myself?"
are you ready for start today
why are you scared? Why do you cry?
Are you feel let you down / are you ready for start today?

we never stop days coming / cry, anger, pain is proof of life
same days same people fuckin' days same things again and again!Â­

we break it, we made it, we must die for we try to live, but this is so hard
you give up, you run out, you kill your dream and our dreams
come on!Â­

why you cry this time and so you say "Do you believe myself?"
are you ready for start today
why are you scared? Why do you cry?
Are you feel let you down / are you ready for start today?

We try so hard and you try yo live
Kill me oh I'm going to kill me why you kill me

why are you scared? Why do you cry?
Are you feel let you down

Break it!Â­
