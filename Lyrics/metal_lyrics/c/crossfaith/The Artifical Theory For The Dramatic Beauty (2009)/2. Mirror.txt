Heard your hoice / this time I fault
Rewrite / to sight on / your sorrow, kill I am
This game I gave youround of shame
Tell me. what do you see? again

Blind told me "You can reach my hand"
Come on
I break the relation / desire cover all
Your choice myself / your choice by myself

Your fuckin'face
Tear me down

I know inside of fear
I can take that's not enough

Blind told me "You can reach my hand"
Come on
I break the relation / desire cover all
Your choice myself / your choice by myself
Faith!curse!proud is away from you
Faith!curse!proud and life are broken

Against the mirror. You can reach my hand
Against the mirror don't be looking back

You crying out / I think you come to end story
Your fail choice because nightmare reflect yourself

Nightmare / you stand here alone
Falling to leave alone
