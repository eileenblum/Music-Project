So where did I lose my conviction
Fight the nightmare that brings me down
Yeah I feel like we all are living fiction

Now I feel that we have been born again
Caught you staring at the sun as we face the end
Break across the line and take my hand

[Chorus:]
I want to hear you sing with me (whoa, oh, oh)
This is the sound of revolution
Now will you come and join with me (whoa, oh, oh)
Take back today
And live the revolution

No longer avoiding the friction
Free from nightmares won't lay back down
Let me welcome you to my new addiction

I am not alone
Standing here again
Just a little bit closer till we reach the end
Break across the line and take my hand

[Chorus:]
I want to hear you sing with me (whoa, oh, oh)
This is the sound of revolution
Now will you come and join with me (whoa, oh, oh)
Take back today
And live the revolution

Revolution!
Revolution, yeah!

And I feel like we're living fiction
Welcome to my new addiction
We live the revolution

I want to hear you sing it (whoa, oh, oh)
Now will you come and join with me (whoa, oh, oh)

Now I feel that we have been born again
Caught you staring at the sun as we face the end
Break across the line and take my hand

[Chorus:]
I want to hear you sing with me (whoa, oh, oh)
This is the sound of revolution
Now will you come and join with me (whoa, oh, oh)
Take back today
And live the revolution
I want to hear you sing with me (whoa, oh, oh)
Now will you come and join with me
Take back today
And live the revolution
