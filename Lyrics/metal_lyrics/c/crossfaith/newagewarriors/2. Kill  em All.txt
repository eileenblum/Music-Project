Now we're coming in hot
Nobody can stop us tonight (can stop us tonight)
Don't need another imitation
Get out of my way
I'll never let you pass me
You're a fake and I'm in the fast lane
Left you all out of time for thinking
Get out of my head

Break, break and break it tonight
Break, break and break it tonight
Break, break and break it tonight
Break and break it tonight

[Chorus:]
Break, break and break it tonight
Never gonna see them again
Attack, attack and attacking tonight
I see you hiding
Break, break and break it tonight
I'll show you what we got when worlds collide
We stand up and scream
Kill them all

Yeah we're coming in fast
Nobody can stop us tonight (can stop us tonight)
Keep up or find yourself in the dust
Get out of my way
Consume the liquid fire
Close your eyes and feel the raw energy
You can't stand here in front of me
Get out of my head

Break, break and break it tonight
Break, break and break it tonight
Break, break and break it tonight
Break and break it tonight

[Chorus:]
Break, break and break it tonight
Never gonna see them again
Attack, attack and attacking tonight
I see you hiding
Break, break and break it tonight
I'll show you what we got when worlds collide
We stand up and scream
Kill them all

Kill them all!
Kill them all!
Kill themâ¦

Break, break and break it tonight
Break, break and break it tonight
Break, break and break it tonight
Break and break it tonight

[Chorus:]
Break, break and break it tonight
Never gonna see them again
Attack, attack and attacking tonight
I see you hiding
Break, break and break it tonight
I'll show you what we got
The worlds collide in front of me
Attack, attack and attacking tonight
When the worlds collide
We stand up and scream
Kill them all

Yeah!
Kill them all!
