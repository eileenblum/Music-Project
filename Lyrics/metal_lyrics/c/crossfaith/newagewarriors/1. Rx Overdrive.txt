Blood in my veins is running faster
Will it take me high again?
My eyes are tracking harder
Will my sanity remain?

Pull me out from myself
No other way
Primal fears in my head
No turning back today

[Pre-chorus]
I can see what you can't see
I can be what you can't be
This is injection overdrive

[Chorus:]
It's striking back (back)
Blood in my veins (veins)
I feel it taking me, taking me
Through the haze
It's striking back (back)
Blood in my veins (veins)
And this will carry me, carry me
Through the pain
It's striking back

I cannot stop the shaking till I black out
I taste adrenaline and ride it out

Pull me out from myself
What do I see?
The prisoner in my head
Is staring back at me

[Pre-chorus:]
I can see what you can't see
I can be what you can't be
This is injection overdrive

[Chorus:]
It's striking back (back)
Blood in my veins (veins)
I feel it taking me, taking me
Through the haze
It's striking back (back)
Blood in my veins (veins)
And this will carry me, carry me
Through the pain
It's striking back

No longer empty, feel it striking back
Gave me a lifetime fix I won't go back

I feel it taking me through the haze (haze)
And this will carry me through the pain (pain)
Pain

[Pre-chorus:]
I can see what you can't see
I can be what you can't be
This is injection overdrive
