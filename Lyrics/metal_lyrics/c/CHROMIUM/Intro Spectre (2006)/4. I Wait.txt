I'm swinging out of control, I feel I'm losing my soul
And I will never begin to realize... I'm dead in your eyes
I feel nothing but pain, you left me feeling ashamed
And suddenly I finally believe...  You never knew me

You push me and I wait
I feel you and I break
It's to far, to far gone now

I see right through your eyes, straight through your lies
No longer will I compromise.  You'll never own me.
I'm taking back who I am, breaking free from your plan
No longer hidden can't you see, you'll never have me
