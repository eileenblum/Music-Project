I've given you everything that I could ever give
You gave me nothing but all this pain
Suffocate my life away, I can't control
Hold me down to live it your way, you're to blame

I wish my life away, all because of you
I'm not your property!

Lost taken from me all that you thought you could owe
You give me nothing back, I'm alone
Take me back to where it began, when I was blind
I've let you go from this hold, on my mind.

I cannot find a way to run away from you
It always runs a stray and cuts me through
I'm taking back my life, taking back my pain, all that I feel
I'll make an example of you, this life is real

This is for me...
...and so for you
