Wondering when I'm gonna wake up
Something said, still echoes in my head
Forget the pain, forever will remain
Hold it inside of me

Am I dead, alive to satisfy?
What's in my head?  A path that burns me
Why do I yield to everything?
That you said, still echoes in my head

Admit it...

Bring me down in this world forget my soul
Bring me down this is all for you
But you see
Tear me down from inside, erase my mind
Tear me down cause I'm nothing to you
And never will be...

See myself, from a distance
Breath again, far away from here
To be myself, the greatest challenge
Free my mind from this
