Do you know what I go through to live what I want make a new
I'm fighting, I'm fighting
Do you understand what I need to stay alive and survive
I'm dying here, I'm dying...

Open my mind to you all, waiting for your wanted call
But nothing, I hear nothing
Can I choose to change my mind, or is it fallen on my kind
I'm dying here, I'm dying...

Look what you've done to me
Look what's become
Forget what was meant to be
Now I'm undone

And now I'm alone...
