I see you every day, you drain my life away
You give me no respect, got nothing good to say
I'm losing you, losing me
losing everything that ever made me be.

And I find my way and it's over now
No more restrain and it's over now

I'm breaking free from you, it's all that I can do
You will never know what I've been through
'm losing you, saving me
Saving me everything that I used to be

And there's nothing more that I would rather do
Is find my way back to you...
And there's nothing more that I would rather see
Just look in these eyes and forgive me now
