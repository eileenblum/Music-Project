There is a feeling, in us all
This won't control us forever more
Break from this purpose, rise inside
Trust what you see in these eyes

I can't control this by myself
There's no erasing lies

There is a one that slowly
Bare to believe, that's all I have of me

Fight for your freedom, always strive
Push for salvation in your life
