I cannot be what you want me to
Why do you make me feel this way that I do
Release me from this life I feel, I can no longer see
What is real

You're not a part of me
You pulled yourself away
You've been to blind to see
That I was here to stay

You tried to take this life away from me
You tried to take away everything that I had
Why do you always have to run me down
I know I'm worth so much more then you would know

Place my soul into existence
Let me feel that I'm alive

I am stronger then before
(I am stronger, I am stronger!)
I will arise again once more
This is all that I can do
Live my life to please you

Must I repeat what I say
How many times must I repeat myself
Over and over again I try
