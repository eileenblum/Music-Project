Listen to me, I need you here
I plead for your aid, to find my fear
Open my mind to all I've left behind
Never knowing It's all inside my mind

And through my new born eyes I
see the world a new (Life with out you)
I need this, I feel this, this is all I am, to me...

Closing my mind to all you choose to hide
Never showing it's all inside your mind

Listen to me, I don't need you here
You bleed for my aid, no longer here
