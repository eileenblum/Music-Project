Deny me of this pleasure yet again, just another slit throat in the end.
This thing called loved is way overrated.
I forgot just how perfect you were with your glassy eyed stare and pale blue skin, all tucked away in my closet.
Do you remember the time we danced the night away?
You held me so tightly didn't think that I would let go.
You always said you wanted to fly, now is your chance to show the world.
Just a question for the pretty lady.
What do you know about romance baby?
It's time that someone called your bluff.
I love how your new accessory accentuates your neck and long dark hair.
You seem to be having some trouble, let me help you down off that chair.
