Time, it rolls on and on
Time, the end for which I long
Life, it endlessly tortures me

Another life and end to my misery
In death I will find an everlasting peace
an end to all the pain and agony
Another life awaits me then I am free

Man, lives helplessly in the dark
A pawn, Chosen to play the part
Life, it endlessly tortures me

The doors, of death are opening
The depths, of hell are beckoning
Another life, burnt offerings

Another life fulfill your destiny
In death you'll feel the pain that Satan brings
Another life begins so suffer endlessly
You'll burn in hell for eternity
