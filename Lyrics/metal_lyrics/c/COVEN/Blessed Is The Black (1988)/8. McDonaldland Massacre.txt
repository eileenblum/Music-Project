McDeath.
He's fed up with fast food,
Out of his mind, one mad dude.
Grabbed his guns, went downtown.
Mr. McDeath is coming to track Ronald down.
(Bridge)
Now the golden arches are bloodstained red.
Ronald is dead... took a bullet in the head.
(Chorus)
May I take your order please?
NOOOO!!!!!
Can I help you sir?
NOOOO!!!!!

McDonaldland Massacre.
He came inside, took a seat
They didn't know he didn't come to eat
Asked for his order, got a bullet instead.
Ronald can't help... Ronald is dead.
(Repeat Bridge)
May I take your order please?
NOOOO!!!!!
Oh my god he's got a gun!
McDonaldland Massacre
(Assorted Mayhem, gunshots (semi-automatic), screams)
Ronald is lying on the floor,
The Grimace took a bullet trying to run out the door.
Hamburglar's brains all over Mayor McCheese, and
he won't let you go, even if you say please.
Quarter Pounder, Big Mac, Fillet 'O Fish and fries..........
it doesn't matter what you order, everybody dies.
