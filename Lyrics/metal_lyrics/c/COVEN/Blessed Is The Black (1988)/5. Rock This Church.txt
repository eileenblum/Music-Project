We rock this church
Rock it inside out
Against the world they teach us
on judgement day we shout
The preacher gives us sermon
The preacher gives us prayer
The preacher gives us heaven
Can't he see that we don't care

Rock this church

They cry for better manners
They tell us be polite
They tell us get our hair cut
Don't they know they are asking for a fight
They tell us it's immoral
They tell us it's a sin
We get all our pleasures
From the trouble that we get in

Rock this curch
