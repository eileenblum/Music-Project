Taught from birth you'll burn in hell
for all eternity
if you don't pledge your soul to Christ
and serve him faithfully
Searching deep within yourself
the evil answer lies
You know your heart is black as hell
and death is in your eyes

Preachers of the holy gospel
evangelist of lies
Blessed are the men in black
who see through the disguise

Blessed are the wicked cursed are the weak
Athian rising tormenting the meek
Our numbers on a constant rise we turn to the attack
We prey upon the old and weak Blessed is the black

They hide behind their book of lies
deceiving without shame
An athian rising fast
to lay waste their claim

Preachers of the holy gospel
evangelist of lies
Blessed are the men in black
who see through the disguise

Searching deep within yourself
the evil answer lies
You know your heart is black as hell
and death is in your eyes
