He stands alone, outside the gates of hell
Set free, to torment and kill

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
He'll search till the end, be glad when you've died

a dealer of death he may make a trade
your life will serve him well
A fury unleashed to destroy all it seeks
Death monger sent straight from hell

He breaks through the door, hell's own monger returns
Your soul is damned, as your world starts to burn

He stands alone, outside the gates of hell
Set free, to torment and kill
