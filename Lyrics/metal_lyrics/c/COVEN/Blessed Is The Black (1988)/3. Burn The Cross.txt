Tormented Christian sons of God
lie cold within their grave
Tortured and then sacrificed
for a God they sought to save
Curse their souls to burn in hell
Satan's wrath unfolds
to conquer and then terminate
damnation takes it's hold

Son of God repent your sins
and pledge your soul to hell
Pray that Satan will forgive
once your God has fell
Expect the death of those who pray
to a God so long since passed
Your God is dead and now you die
Satan rules at last

Burn The Cross
