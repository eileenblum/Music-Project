[Christcycle]

Have you ever had the feeling you were losing your mind?
Totally lost, spiritually blind
If you're looking for a savior
Then I've got the trick
Christcycle - salvation on a stick

Salvation, as near as your grocer's freezer
For only thirty-five cents - redeemed!
Ejaculating on the floor of a confessional
Eat it quick, before it melts away!

Have you ever had the feeling you were losing your mind?
Totally lost, spiritually blind
If you're looking for a savior
Then I've got the trick
Christcycle - salvation on a stick

[Reaming The Pope]

Jesus, Mother Mary
I just found out
The Pope is a fairy
There's Vaseline in the Vatican
The bishops are at it again!

Bend over now, your lordship
Your father's coming home
They ream The Pope in Rome!
