Kindergarten playground, kids having fun
Going to the pawn shop to buy me a big ass gun!

Armed and poised at the schoolyard fence
To complete the recipe I'll just add violence!

Your child is in my sights
As I pull back the hammer
My aim is just right as I squeeze the trigger
I'm a cold-blooded psychopathic maniac
My favorite method of attack
Is shooting children in the back!

I'm a citizen of the ultimate nation
Where they'll sell me a gun
And provide an invitation
To come and release my pent-up frustrations
On unsuspecting crowds at convenient locations
For a person like myself there is no defense
Just show me a gun and I'll do the rest
Don't even ask why cause it makes perfect sense
To complete the recipe I'll just add the violence!
