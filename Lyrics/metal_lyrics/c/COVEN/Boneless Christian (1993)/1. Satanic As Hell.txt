Are you deaf? Can't you hear that bell?
It's the sound of Satan
And he's ringing the death bell
You're hanging on to your dying careers
But it's over now, it's been over for years

We're coming back like a malignant tumor
We had to come back, we've got a bad sense of humor
We've got scores to settle, and tales to tell
But most of all - we're satanic as hell

We're satanic as hell
We're satanic as hell
We're satanic as hell

Well I was sitting in my pentagram watching TV
Picked up the rocket, and what did I see?
Dinosaurs, dinosaurs, flogging a dead horse
We had to come back, we had no other recourse

Step aside, we're gonna lay it to rest
We've seen the others - we're not impressed
Thrash isn't cool and it don't even sell
The only reason we do it - cause we're satanic!

Oh lord satanas
With reverence we chant your name
For you we plunder, rape and kill
We only ask you do the same
Dig up mother Mary's bones
Grind them into dust
We snort  them up just like cocaine
In Satan we trust!

Cause we're satanic as hell!
We're satanic as hell!
We're satanic as hell!
