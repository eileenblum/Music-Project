My god is of this earth
Your god remains unseen
Of yours you await rebirth
My god is here right now
My god is green!

As you drift throughout your dying days
I merely set my god ablaze

You can sell your belief
I can buy my relief
Your god is overpriced
With mine there's no sacrifice

My god is green!
