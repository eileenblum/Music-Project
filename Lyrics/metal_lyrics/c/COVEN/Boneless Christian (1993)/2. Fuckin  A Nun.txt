I've got this nasty habit
I picked up when I was young
When I want something I grab it
And right now I want that nun
She was collecting for some orphans
"Could you spare some change, my son?"
Untarnished little trinket
And she looked like she'd be fun

Fuckin' a nun!
I'm fuckin' a nun!
And I'm gonna kill her when I'm done!

With hatred and resistance
She looked up at me above
With power and persistence
I gave her long forgotten love
I put the demon in her mouth
Where God's word was once supreme
Unprecedented cum bath
To a symphony of angels' screams

Fuckin' a nun!
I'm fuckin' a nun!
And I'm gonna kill her when I'm done!

I wrapped her up in plastic
Threw her body in the trunk
Quite a major hassle for a 30 second fuck
Just then, the plastic parted
And her stiff blue thigh began to show
I had to do her one more time
Cause a dead girl can't say no

I've got this nasty habit
I picked up when I was young
When I want something I grab it
And right now I want that nun
She was collecting for some orphans
"Could you spare some change, my son?"
Untarnished little trinket
And she looked like she'd be fun

I'll kill her when I'm done!
