Million fools are taken, by the madness that you teach
Blinded by the mindlessness that you preach
Pearly gates of solitude, so cold &amp; far away
You tell them if you're gonna reach them
You'll have to pray, that means you'll have to pay

They line up by the thousands to buy their way out of hell
You're selling things you have no right to sell
But they'll all be there &amp; they're waiting
To watch your body burn
Just like everyone of us
You'll get your fishing turn
Burn

[Bridge:]
As God above is watching the world he planned to save
He contemplates the price that he has paid
As that he lifts the body of his son from earth below
And to your own destruction he finally lets you go
