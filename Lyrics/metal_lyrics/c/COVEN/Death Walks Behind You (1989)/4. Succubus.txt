Superstition, seductress of death
Murderous bitch from the grave
Convicted, a disciple of Satan
Raped &amp; then burned at the stake
Virgin, bitch of the faith
Tormented the earth once before
Resurrect the slut from the grave
My beloved satanic whore

[Chorus:]
She's back from the grave
To fish &amp; enslave
You cannot be saved
Succubus
She'll drain you of breath
Suck you to death
Bury what's left
Succubus

{Bridge:]
