Bring out the magic, so long since passed
The world will be trapped within my grasp
Study each page, practiced just right
Hell's own power will be my might

No one will know the power I hold
It's in all of us, the days of old
Spellbinder

Confidence fills me, the time is now right
To bring out the chaos from deep in the night
Circle of magic constructed, articles heeded in place
Avenging spirits arise, staring into my face

Asteroth, Grand Duke of Hell
I conjure thee to complete this spell
All is gained, nothing lost
My soul is yours, if that's the cost

[Repeat twice]
