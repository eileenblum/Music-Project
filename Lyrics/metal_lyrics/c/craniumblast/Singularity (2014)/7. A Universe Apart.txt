Right after distance and mass had sprouted
And life took its form
This cosmic presence grew tired and weary
Of watching the space too long

Eyes like suns, toes in stardust
Compelling form of gravitational lensing
I am supreme thus I create
This counterpart to bring closeness in vastness

I have no control, it is eating too much
I can not struggle to keep the ideal alive
Antagonism - your fury and my might
The children are born 
and they feed from this blight

Duality
Duality

Inexplicable need to be complete
Indefinable ways to connect the dots in entropy
A trillion colours emerge from the black heart
These two are one but still a universe apart

A universe apart

Long after distance and mass had sprouted
New life took its form
This cosmic presence grew barren and cold
Like its projections

Eyes like suns, toes in stardust
Compelling form of gravitational lensing
I am supreme thus I create
This counterpart to bring closeness in vastness

Inexplicable need to be complete
Indefinable ways to connect the dots in entropy
A trillion colours emerge from the black heart
These two are one but still a universe apart

A universe apart

A trillion colours emerge from the black heart
These two are one but still a universe apart

A universe apart
