A darker world
After each sunrise
Detached from it all
An indifferent existence
Devoted only for woe

A new forever
In a world without an end
A new forever
A world without an end

Without an end

At the end of the rope
A deliverance long sought
A new forever
In a world without an end

Only in death
May our echo resound through infinity

A path with no trails
Cold breath stirring the haze
A ghost walking

Dead leaves crumbling under 
The torn asunder
Soon departing
Towards the everlasting dark

A new forever
In a world without an end
A new forever
A world without an end

Without an end

At the end of the rope
A deliverance long sought
A new forever
In a world without an end

Only in death
May our echo resound through infinity

A path with no trails
Cold breath stirring the haze
Echoes walking

Under the roots
One with the trees
Interwoven with nature

A last imprint
Enshrined within a coil
Slowly transforming into an art

Dead leaves crumbling under 
The torn asunder
Soon departing
Towards the everlasting dark

A darker world
After each sunrise
Detached from it all
An indifferent existence
Devoted only for woe

A new forever
In a world without an end
A new forever
A world without an end
