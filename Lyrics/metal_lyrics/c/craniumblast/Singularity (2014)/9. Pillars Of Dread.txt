Souls of recurring cycle
Shall pass through fire and demise 
In this all-embracing illusion
They are to reborn out of suffering

None is himself
Everyone is the other
And the stench of centuries 
will ascend from early graves 

A scornful hegemony
lays down on the pillars of dread
A malevolent abstraction
lashes us with a chain of belief

Should you revolt and rise
from the void of creation
Prepare to wage a war 
to cast aside the chain with disbelief 

Against oppression of sin

Souls of recurring cycle
Shall pass through fire and demise 
In this all-embracing illusion
They are to reborn out of suffering

None is himself
Everyone is the other
And the stench of centuries 
will ascend from early graves

A scornful hegemony
lays down on the pillars of dread
A malevolent abstraction
lashes us with a chain of belief
