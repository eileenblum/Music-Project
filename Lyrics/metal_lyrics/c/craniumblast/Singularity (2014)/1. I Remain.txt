A flame flickers in the breeze of time
Crushed by the essence of being
Soulless, but a flash of light
Unaffecting, ultimately sleeping

I've watched life bloom a countless times
Yet in a blink of an eye
Even dimensions may die

Undivine, a desolate stargazer
The creator and the devourer of worlds
Sentient to a point of delirium
Unaffected, ultimately dreaming

A consciousness beyond the void
The source of all, or a mere spectator

I remain

I've watched life bloom a countless times
Yet in a blink of an eye
Even dimensions may die

Even dimensions may die

Rise, and look at the glaze
What can be built, can be burnt
I reform the particles
I turn back the time
