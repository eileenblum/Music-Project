A faceless terror 
Awaits for those 
in search of the truth 
The unborn - still in bliss 

A crave for suffering 
As unmatched as our greed 
Conceived in leper flesh 

Like a godless preacher
Reaching for the void
With a fabric of lies
Wrapped around his eyes

The serpents of Eden 
Praying for the bringer of end 
Soulless, yet never free 
Nullus deus in nobis

A path of darkness 
The feast of sin
Damned to live
Devoid of reverence for our kin

As all was born of fire 
So shall it be undone

We shall never be
Blessed with emptiness
Soulless, yet never free 
Nullus deus in nobis

The unborn
In dreamless slumber
Still in bliss 

A crave for suffering 
As unmatched as our greed 
Conceived in leper flesh 

Like a godless preacher
Reaching for the void
With a fabric of lies
Wrapped around his eyes

A path of darkness 
The feast of sin
Damned to live
Devoid of reverence for our kin

As all was born of fire 
So shall it be undone
We shall never be
Blessed with emptiness
