Hands of god in function
Arbitrary lumbar punctions
Your malice and your vices
Call for rancid bodily fluid expulsions
Clicking in my synapses, I rip yours off

The needle as wide as my grin
Breaking through thoracic cavities

I look at the portrait
and fucking smash it in
The sirens growl to bring me more
It's total neural control

I'll be in your dreams
Come next to your cradle
Two more seconds to take pleasure 
in cerebro-spinal tremors

I waste no time with crushing vertebrae
and leave a trail of twitching cadavers

Sterile equipment of some intention
Becomes the tool of salvation...

...and it's yours
So turn me your back 
And take the force 
In your epidural openings

Call for your savior
I felt disgusted 
By their human face

I'll fucking ram it in

I'll be in your dreams
Come inside your hearse
One more second to take pleasure 
in cerebro-spinal tremors

Violent gushes from the drain

Sacrifice is ready

Hands of god in function
Arbitrary lumbar punctions
Your malice and your vices 
Call for rancid bodily fluid expulsions

I look at the portrait
and fucking smash it in
The sirens growl to bring me more
It's total neural control

I'll be in your dreams
Come next to your cradle
Two more seconds to take pleasure 
in cerebro-spinal tremors

I'll be in your dreams
Come inside your hearse
One more second to take pleasure 
in cerebro-spinal tremors
