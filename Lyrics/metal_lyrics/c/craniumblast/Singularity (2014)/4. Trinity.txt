Gone are the rays of sun
Skies long buried in smoke
A wasteland for the dead
Equilibrium achieved in one short blast

Evil unbound within the soul of man
Creation reversed - All hail the end!

A wasteland for the dead
Skies long buried in smoke
A rain of ruin now befalls

Science twisting into an iron fist
Trinity, stillborn in the name of war

This is the end of it all
A rain of ruin now befalls
Equilibrium achieved in one short blast

Fear no more
All shall fall
Come heed the siren's call

Nothing shall be the same again

Fear no more
All shall fall
Come feed the siren's call

Evil unbound within the soul of man
Creation reversed - All hail the end!

A wasteland for the dead
Skies long buried in smoke
A rain of ruin now befalls

Science twisting into an iron fist
Trinity, stillborn in the name of war

Science twisting 
Into an iron fist
Trinity, stillborn 
In the name of war

In the name or war
