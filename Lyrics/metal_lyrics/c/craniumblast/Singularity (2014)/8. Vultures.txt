Mankind is on its knees
Facing extinction
Yet depending on greed - greed!
This shall be the way of all life
Vultures within us
Chaos outside

We are the children of science
We - the descendants of war

The ashes of elders
Buried beneath us
Remnants of the world 
Long lost and gone

Succumb to a greater dark
Last hope extinct at last
Where the empty souls forever burn
We shall remain

The ashes of elders
Feeding our hate
Feeding the vultures within
The vultures within

We are the children of science
We - the descendants of war

Succumb to a greater dark
Last hope extinct at last
Where the empty souls forever burn
We shall remain

Succumb to a greater dark
Last hope extinct at last
Where the empty souls forever burn
We shall remain

The ashes of elders
Feeding our hate
Feeding the vultures
Vultures within
