Worlds apart
Quasars deforming
Bane of the lights order 
will be devoured
into a chasm of infinite silence

Existence molded
In death and birth
Into fabric of illusions
Of the worlds to be reborn

Within the soul of a dead god
Lies the eternal frontiers of blackness
Threshold for passing souls
Reduced to an atonement, to a creed
For singularity within, a dead god in me

"God is dead. 
God remains dead. 
And we have killed him. 
Yet his shadow still looms."

Threshold for passing souls
Reduced to an atonement, to a creed
For singularity within, a dead god in me

And I am alive
