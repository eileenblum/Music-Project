Meditation by medication
Life injected to my cells
Metallic eyes see everywhere
From the cortex of this nation

This soil is not like planet home
Laymen are the weapons in this carnage
Don't regret, don't look back
There's nowhere to hide

The future is wiped clean
If it ever truly existed
Within a push of a button
to an emerging blue screen
Sway the cradle of apocalypse

We're mesmerized by machines
to keep our eyes on the TV
And the price for being able to live
is the reality

This soil is not like planet home
Laymen are the weapons in this carnage
Don't regret, don't look back
There's nowhere to hide

The future is wiped clean
If it ever truly existed
Within a push of a button
to an emerging blue screen
Sway the cradle of apocalypse

We're mesmerized by machines
to keep our eyes on the TV
And the price for being able to live
is the reality

The lights go out
The voices come
Swarming machines 
Initiate the broadcast 
Close your eyes and stay put
Because there's nowhere to hide

Say what you want to say 
but only to yourself
In a world where actions speak no louder than words
Scrape your head to a brick
And break the microchip
