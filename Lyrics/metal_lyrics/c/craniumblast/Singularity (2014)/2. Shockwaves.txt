Could we unwind what the legends say
The forests never told a story
We could be remnants of an alien race 
Or those to bring it to a start

This is an empire like a jewel box
It's rattling in the hands of ancient keepers
Their hungry mouths and claws reach for the contents

I hold the vial of immunity
Just try and take it from my hands
There's opposition always reaching in
We've heard the great ones 
never lived through the day

So rip my lungs out from me
But hear my warning
There's million more of creatures like me

You've played the game of power just like me
Although my field is a hundred times wider
Parrying the shockwaves of the industry

Transcend my soul into you
I haunt you from the grave
This furnace will see a light no more

Could we unwind what the legends say
The forests never told a story
We could be remnants of an alien race 
Or those to bring it to a start

So rip my lungs out from me
But hear my warning
There's a million more of creatures like me

This is an empire like a jewel box
It's rattling in the hands of ancient keepers
Their hungry mouths and claws reach for the contents
I pick my favourite colours
I throw the foul ones out
I shake the puny ones down to the bottom

There's opposition always reaching in
We've heard the great ones 
never lived through the day

So rip my lungs out from me
But hear my warning
There's million more of creatures like me

You've played the game of power just like me
Although my field is a hundred times wider
Parrying the shockwaves of the industry

You've played the game of power just like me
Although my field is a hundred times wider
Parrying the shockwaves of the industry
I feel the shockwaves of euphoric desires
