Under our feets our bodies rot in harmony.
I equal dirt. Money rules and is and is - 
harmony is unreachable. 

Way of slavery - controlled by the greed.

Endless emptiness inside krkaal humana
Endless shell is the body of everything
number eight is our mind - which equals ZERO

Search and you will live in death.
There is nothing to search, the answer is right in front of your face - 
there is no answer.
Two fucking feets to stand, 
I should use them.
Why to use brains for making knots?
Answer is false.

Lives in death and knows it not.
Why the need of grabbing? 
Cages and knows it not.Cages.
Why the need of games of expectation? (remember)
They are ridicilous but sees it not.(the moment)
Who's really in control? Is it you? Think again.
Don't grab the knots - get rid of the rope to be
FREE.
