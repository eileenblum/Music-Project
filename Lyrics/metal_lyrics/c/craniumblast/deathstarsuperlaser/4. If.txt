All are evil in my mind.

All are evil in my mind.
Confused and is a quality.
All is MINDLESS and mind is and is not
Oh please don't stab with that knife! 
I'd like to feel kindness of human kind. (WHAT FUCKING KNIFE?!)
This mind keeps telling me - 
you all want death and misery. 
(WHAT THE FUCK IS MISERY - self made and and not real)

Every day is a day to die for eyes that see lies!
Every day is the day. Again something is wrong.
Splashing in misery,
which is fake and made of reality.

Starting to think all has the same..
..Brains.. we share. Are they dying too?
After all we are all the same. .. ingredient!
Some call it god - some call it life. Some are wrong and some are right.
Mind means everything but nothing at all - constructor of reality.

In what kind of place you want to live?
Fact or fiction - it is reality. Too much fiction is bad direction.
Emptiness. Construction.. artificial. When realities meet mirrors are twisted.

Is this a secret death wish?
Too many mirrors twisting.

Every day is a day to die for eyes that see lies!
Every day is the day. Again something is wrong.
Splashing in misery,
which is fake and made of reality.
