Psike opai vles sjuor

Traaksuka vutura lkhr krkal
Sjuojr kra shmrii psike

Once again I'm too small - cranium ain't enough for this daze.
Information transforms into uncontrollable physical form..
and throws me into ground screaming I.. - need some fucking piece of peace.

This world is changing - does it come from me?
These selfish demons|Am I fearing minds resources?

Once again, lkhr krkal.
I need a hole in my skull.
Once again, lkhr krkal.
Psike opai vles anti. I need a hole in my skull.

Minds in peace - destroy selfish needs
There is no peace in pieces|respect
freedom|respect life. 
Respect I.
Love. And when you drop: Fuck this shit.
Once again I'm too small - cranium ain't enough for this daze.
Information transforms into uncontrollable physical form..
and throws me into ground screaming I.. - need some fucking piece of peace.

From every view I look I see all is hypocrite.
Vles opai psike. Respect life.

Once again, lkhr krkal.
I need a hole in my skull.
What the fuck? We are all equal.
Vles opai psike, respect life.
