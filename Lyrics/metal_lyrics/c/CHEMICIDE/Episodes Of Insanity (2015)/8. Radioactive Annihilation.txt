Break of dawn, mutants arise from the place they last stood,
Eating themselves to survive, killing to live their final command,
Deluge of toxiness across the world,
Pollute the rivers, infects the crops,
No shelter for us to live,
Nightmare now is complete

Extermination across the sea,
Spreading fear and disease,
We cry! Now we live our lives in fear.
Government has taken control of our minds and our homes,
We die; mutants now rise!

Radioactive annihilation!
Venom running free,
Radioactive annihilation!
Annihilation has begun.

Napalm bombs burn the sky poisoning the land,
Nuclear dust is what we breathe, infecting our lungs,
Premonitions of the past written in stone,
Now we cry over our demise

Radioactive annihilation!
Venom running free,
Radioactive annihilation!
Body bags piling up.

People ask the question why?!
Why must we die?!

Radioactive annihilation!
Venom running free,
Radioactive annihilation!
Annihilation has begun.
