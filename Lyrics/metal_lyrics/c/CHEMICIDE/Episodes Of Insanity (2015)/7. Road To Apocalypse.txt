Human raze will run in chaos 
Pestilent writes our sentence of death 
Cities in ruins, no salvation 
Famine and plagues among ourselves 

The sky cries blood as rain 
We wonder what we've done, 
The thirst for power condemned our fate 
Embrace your destiny, you're all alone 

No absolution for our sins 
Beneath the stars hopeless we lie 
The chapter is closed, our ending is near 

Road to apocalypse 

Mass hysteria 
Mental collapse 
Total paranoia 
You were born to die 

No absolution for our sins 
Beneath the stars hopeless we lie 
The chapter is closed, our ending is near 

Road to apocalypse
