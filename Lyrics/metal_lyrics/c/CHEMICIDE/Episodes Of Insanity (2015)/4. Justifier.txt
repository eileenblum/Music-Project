Born in misery, wrapped in anger,
Mentally intoxicated, seduced by violence,
The memories are back, It's time to payback,
Insanity has made me a machine without heart.

Hatred and grief will explain my work,
Horror and torture for everyone,
I'm a hero without a parade,
The expert of a game, the no one likes to play.

Justifier
Born to Kill.

Justifier
Justifier
Justifier
Killing Spree.

I'll peel the flesh off your bones,
Rip your arms with an axe,
Carve a knife into your eyes,
Leave your body dry for the worms.

Severed corpses piled in rooms,
Wrapped in anger I'll show the truth,
Friends for eternity in violence and pain,
I'll bring the darkest of hell.

Justifier
Justifier
Justifier
Born to Kill.

Justifier
Justifier
Justifier
Killing Spree.

Time to suffocate,
Time to take your life!

Justifier
Justifier
Justifier
Born to Kill.
