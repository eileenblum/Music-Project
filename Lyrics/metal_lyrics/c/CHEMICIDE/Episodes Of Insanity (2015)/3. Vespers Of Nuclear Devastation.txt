The sky spits fire,
Day becomes as obscure as night,
Liquid death floods the rivers,
Nuclear dust covers the land.

Contamination in the air,
We're lead to man decay,
People hide from radiation,
Stench of guilt covers nations.

Human race,
Lead to extinction,
Ignorance,
Blinded our sight,
No tomorrow,
From this nightmare,
We're victims of experiments and there's is nothing to be alive!

Vespers Of Nuclear Devastation,
The sky burns, the earth cries,
Vespers Of Nuclear Devastation,
Are you prepared for the moment to die?

Ancient ones have foreseen the time mankind will end,
Hydrogen bombs, unmeasurable destruction that tyrants have sent,
I suggest you start to live at maximum your life,
Because maybe tonight could be your last.

Vespers Of Nuclear Devastation,
The sky burns, the earth cries,
Vespers Of Nuclear Devastation,
Are you prepared for the moment to die?

Human race,
Lead to extinction,
Ignorance,
Blinded our sight,
No tomorrow,
From this nightmare,
We're victims of experiments and there's is nothing to be alive!

Vespers Of Nuclear Devastation,
The sky burns, the earth cries,
Vespers Of Nuclear Devastation,
Are you prepared for the moment to die?
