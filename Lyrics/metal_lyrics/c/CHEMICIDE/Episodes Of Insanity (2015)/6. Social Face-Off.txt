Civil rights violated by our own hands,
there's no present no tomorrow,
no turning back,
we have chosen our way to live,
we put the power in the hands of pigs,
no future to look ahead our, our faith is condemned, the people are afraid of their government.

Enslave the rich,
Empower the weak,
The time is now,
Social Face-Off

Bourgeois and bureaucracy attacking the poor and the sick,
middle and high class hypocrisy,
there's no equality,
we have to feel ashamed, there's nothing to regret, everything is done, there's nothing to say.

Enslave the rich,
Empower the weak,
The time is now,
Social Face-Off

People in the streets getting smashed in the face by the hand of police,
it's a one way street we don't give but we receive physical abuse and we should be pleased?
Brains splattered on the walls and the streets,
the least that we fight the more that they kill,
With hatred in our hearts the time has come for us to attack!

Enslave the rich,
Social Face-Off
Empower the weak,
Social Face-Off
The time is now,
Social Face-Off
