Welcome to this institution,
an asylum of perdition,
you're brought into this place,
of sorrow and despair,
you're welcome to see reality, as we see each others,
no more of this! NO MORE!

Cryogenics!
People chopped in pieces,
Creator of disease,
Mortality Increases.

Eyeballs and Skulls,
Fog in the halls,
Abnormality! Comatose!

Scared for your life! You wonder what you've done
Your mind digress, What is this that you have become?
A science project of a school called government judging you for what you've done!

Await!
your visions turned to nightmare Time will tell
Dreadful!
visions of damnation
Fear the Science of death!

Running away from you fate,
realized this is an endless maze,
everywhere that you go leads you to the same place
filled with body parts ready to be replaced.

You get to your final destination,
a surgery bed covered with your own blood,
like a monkey for experimentation,
your brain now lies on the floor

Cryogenics!
People chopped in pieces,
Creator of disease,
Mortality Increases.

Eyeballs and Skulls,
Fog in the halls,
Abnormality! Comatose!

Scared for your life! You wonder what you've done
Your mind digress, What is this that you have become?
Beware! I'm out of control

Await!
your visions turned to nightmare Time will tell
Dreadful!
visions of damnation
Fear the Science of death!
