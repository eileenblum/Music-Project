Piled in the corners 
Covered all in blood 
Bodies of the people 
Who fight against the law 
Terrible awakening for those still alive 
Our mission's to destroy all who oppose to us 

You can't escape this nightmare 
Of torture and disease 
You'll suffer because our anger 
Filled with desire to kill 
Hatred is our fuel to fight this endless war 
No destiny for you, no one will survive 

Eternal punishment 
Paying for your sins 
Disgrace and suffering 
Thrash will conquer 

Running through the streets 
Blinded by rage 
Uncontrollable, unstoppable mentally insane 
We've swored alliance to the earth and the sky 
We're thrash metal warriors that kill on command 

With aggression and with evil we take control 
Merciless slaughter all across this world 
No end, no redemption, that saves your from your fate 
Is already been condemned to be slayed by our hands 

You can't escape this nightmare 
Of torture and disease 
You'll suffer because our anger 
Filled with desire to kill 
Hatred is our fuel to fight this endless war 
Against humanity itself, your destiny will thrash 

Eternal punishment 
Paying for your sins 
Disgrace and suffering 
Thrash will conquer
