Living in a society built in hatred
We close our eyes and hide in fear
Oppressing our people, years in distress
When freedom of speech is just a dream

The law has become the jewel in the crown of state repression
We let these acts criminalize an entire generation
Activists and dissidents looking for peace
Rebranded as terrorists that murder at will

Harassment
Persecution
Revenge
Retaliation

The right to raise your voice
The time to fight for your rights
It has been renamed
Now it's called sabotage

Granting themselves powers unilaterally
They'll control this global society
So, when the streets run red and the kids have no one else to play with
Everyone will realize that the government has to pay
