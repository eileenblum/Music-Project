Ran by people higher up in the chain
They send their loyal dogs to serve and protect
Pledge allegiance to a uniform and a badge
Something they forget when they see the cash

These people that "we trust" are here to keep us safe
They kill at will and hide their face
Harassing our civilians, they move in groups
This society protects the boys in blue

Assassination
Discrimination
Hatred is the key
Taken by force

Bodies are carried in trucks to the morgue
Children grow up holding a grudge
The system has failed we're part of a game
Civilians are turned into pieces made of clay

Assassination
Discrimination
Hatred is the key
Taken by force

Racism
Blood is shed
Kill the minorities
Taken by the force
