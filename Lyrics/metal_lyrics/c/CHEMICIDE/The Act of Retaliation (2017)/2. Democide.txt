Welcome to this new reality,
Where you are a threat, a liability,
Our government shuts down the borders,
Creating indifference.

A world in darkness,
Blinded by ignorance,
Killing ourselves,
Attacking the innocents.

Missiles flying across the sky,
We write our own demise,
Merciless slaughter,
Human decay.

Our lives are compromised
Greed fuels their thirst for blood
Ruled by dictators that soon will fall,
Democide

Prisoners of our own nations
Assassinated because of our believes
Mental slavery
Adding bodies to the pits

Our lives are compromised
Greed fuels their thirst for blood
Ruled by dictators
Democide
