Strapped to a chair
Injected with drugs
Forced to watch films of violence
My brain corrodes

Deception
Regression
What have you done to me?
Brainwashed
Lobotomized
I've been codified to kill

My time has come
To end your life
A victim of mind control
Shaped through time

No one can hide from society
A dystopian future is our reality
Our lives suffocate
Stolen innocence

Regression
Deception
What have you done to me?
Brainwashed
Lobotomized
I've been codified to kill

Dead bodies behind
Thrill for the kill
Etched into my mind
Blood is spilled

Savage display
Horror everywhere
Corpses decay
My way to immortality
