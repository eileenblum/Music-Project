The powerful weapon of mass destruction
Created centuries ago
Written on paper by our own people has the world to its knees

All those prayers, all those words
Have vanished in time, they're long gone
Religion taking lives at will
Preaching with hatred we cease to exist

Knowledge is relation
These fragments are "creation"
Hide behind empty smiles
Believing in the Book of Lies

Reading to the - Book of Lies

Masses come to praise an idol
Read the books of false disciples
With their hands together on their knees they pray
By the name of god we're here to slay

Churches and synagogues corrupt our cities
Polluting their minds with vengeful thinking
Sending our people to kill in their name
We're peons on this endless worldwide game

Knowledge is relation
These fragments are "creation"
Hide behind empty smiles
Believing in the Book of Lies

Reading to the - Book of Lies
