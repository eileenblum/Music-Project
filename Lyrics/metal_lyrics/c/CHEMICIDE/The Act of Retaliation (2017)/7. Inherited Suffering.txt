For thousands of years we have been at war
Imaginary lines that divide our people
Conflict of interests that take away our freedom
Building up the hatred, secluded within these walls

Millions of people slaughtered
Victims of invasion
Imperialistic genocide
Passed down to younger generations

What are you going to do?
When they come for...
Your freedom

Under siege
Under command
Life's at stake
Inherited suffering

Force-fed into our brains
Lobotomized
Doctrines and dogmas
Regimes and religion

What are you going to do?
When they come for...
Your freedom

Under siege
Under command
Life's at stake
Inherited suffering
