Rising from the ashes
The dead come alive
Machines that we created
Have taken our lives

Exo-mechanical skeletons with human brains
Existence is obliterated, no chance to get away

What have we created?
What have we done?
The demise of our existence
Has begun

The sky turns red
Nature takes its course
The moonlight reveals
Doomsday has come

Devastation of our species
Science taking place
All that we ever dreamt of
Has been swept away
The blind lead the blind
Fear spreads its wings
A blackened sun
Humans killed by machines

What have we created?
What have we done?
Age of Extinction
Has begun
