[performed by Chemicide]Archaic creation 
Antagonistic feeling to die 
Insanity 
Pleasure divine 

Almighty power 
I've fall from grace 
I saw the earth, being born into the grave 
From the dawn of times, 'til the darkest end 

Look into my eyes, you'll see the face of death 
Eternal torment, eternal hatred 
Years of terror by my hand 
Burning in my body, running in my blood 
Eternity itself of flesh and bone 

Immortal â rites of death 
Immortal â legend to preserve 
Immortal â rites of death 
Immortal â cults to eternity 

I've come to this world 
Before the sun 
Even before the legend of gods 
Now I know there's no end for me 
Come to dethrone the emperor 

Immortal
