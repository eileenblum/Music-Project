[performed by Chemicide]Madness in their eyes 
Crippled and restless 
Torrents of pesticides 
In their hands future fading 

Visions of destruction 
Flashbacks of death 
People frightened in chaos 
Wondering when this will end 

Venom and disease 
Pollutes their blood 
A silent night of misfortune 
Knocks on every door 
Hunts your life 
Immortal devastation 
Nuclear attack 

Run 
Scream 
Biochemical disaster 

Now that the nightmare has begun 
You know that there's no return 
Your family and friends getting killed 
A twisted society thirsty for the blood spilled 

Acid rains that fall from the sky 
Blinds your vision, your worst fears arise 
Toxic plague possess your lungs 
Bio-bombs awaiting to explode 

Armies of mayhem prepared for the slaughter 
Malevolent creation, planet in flames 
Warfields of terror, boiling turmoil 
Mankind that suffers from this infestation of pain 

Run 
Scream 
Biochemical disaster
