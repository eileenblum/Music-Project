Ask why you hate the memories and yourself
Your eyes in flames words are sentenced to silence
The cries are flood flowing on in my head
Dissapointment brought the tears

Only fright and the unjust night's darkness
A cold emptiness
And my broken hearts confusion

Explain to me why I'm in pain
Eyes in flames just leave me be

Dreams of non-existing suffer and passion
Of the death run
As if I'm cursed;
Fateless unloved looks

Words are useless knives are confused
Revenge is what you crave
Corrosion of our pride
Disinformation led to this tragic end

From dreams to nightmares from illusions
To the canter of reality
There comes the tragic end
The knives will say the last word
