Breathless deep darkness
No one hears my screams
Sleepless time is hopeless
My stillborn fate is suffocating me

Close your eyes can you see your sufer now
Every second you kid yourself
You're dying day by day
Tears for your love

There's no more hope
Revenge is reluctant now
Truth of life
I got wall collapsing down in my head
Truth of life
My attemps are all failing I can't get rid of it
I suffocate
I'm so breathless
Truth of life

Mankind destroying with no respect
All the hapinessand memories they don't discriminate
Once upon a time there was a blue paradise
But now the cemetery of the black tears

After dark you feel the emptiness so cold
You're alone you've lost the game
Mankind noble and proud
But slave of all their own created
Killing themselves and everyone is suffering

Death and fears life and hopes
Didn't you get bored to see the crying of the victims
Why? They don't know?
How did they become a piece of an ordinary war?
