This self centered world is sickening me
Time is going by rapidly
They all slaughtered my beloved ones
Make me wanna purify myself out this
Demise of sincerety

You the ones who poison this world for your wealth
For your own favors you lack the doors of humanity
Do we really need to pay back
With your self centered rules
Demise of sincerety

This immense darkness urges me
I cannot control myself
Now is the time to kill the sinister fate

A light in the hopeless earth is what we're seeking
Demise of sincerety is what you taught me

Try to comprehend, why are all the aspects chaotic
Why are they all ending up in killing desires

My tears dropped on your lies
Still time goes by
I cannot forgive you
Lay down my dead heart
