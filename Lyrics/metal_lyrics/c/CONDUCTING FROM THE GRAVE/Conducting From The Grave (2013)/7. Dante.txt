Souls divided among the rulers, they take their fill and send them to the gates. 
Across the rivers of mindless cadavers, the ferryman reaches out his hand to escort the dead, 
to make way to oblivion. Across the rivers of mindless cadavers, where those that swim are damned. 
Nightmarish sights, that keep me haunted in mind, will be my bane in this hellish place. 
Who has condemned me and sent me here, to rot inside? Was I not redeemed, intended to rise again, 
forgiven of my sin? My child of the fey, there is no light or redeeming your end. You're mine to command. 
Your god has abandoned you and left you to burn away. You're mine to command. Faith has deceived me, misguided 
us all, designed to keep in line while evil sends plagues of greed, lust, and wrath to devour the world 
and steal the souls of the pure and righteous. To devour the world. Down to the hell, to the hell that awaits you. 
Down to the hell, to the hell that awaits you now.
