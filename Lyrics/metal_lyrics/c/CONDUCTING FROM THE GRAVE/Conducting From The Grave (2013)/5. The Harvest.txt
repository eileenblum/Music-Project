All will be seen undone, and then they came from above, riding on the wings of flames,on the thrones
of incomprehensible beasts shining like the dying starlight. Plagues to make the lands void. 
Time will be set to a crawl, the air will feel too thin to breathe. Their poisons dispensed 
at their commands will leach the lights from your eyes as the process begins to unfold. 
Liquify the minds sight. Devour knowledge unfit to retain. All will be left in ruin, 
no trace will be left of our existence. The corpses will feed, give sustenance to, our destroyer. 
The oceans will be filled by our blood and then the cycle will repeat again. Slowly, the earth
begins to rebuild and renew the process. The seeds are sown, the air moves unstagnent. 
The fetal sickness is left to evolve. All the faces look the same, unique to false illusions, 
bred like animals, contained, to feed the worm. Left to see what we become, a product grown to consume, 
forever silenced and damned to remain. We're damned to remain. And they come to to devour, 
feasting on our flesh and bone, to nourish and build their own kinds, to assimilate into our worlds. 
All we have seen undone. time will become unknown, the air won't be for us to breathe, 
and the skies will be terraformed, and turn into a lucid dream. All will be left in horror our 
world will see its end, and our blood will fill the oceans as our flesh is consumed.
