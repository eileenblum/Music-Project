March on my brothers in arms, to the fields of which we forfeit our lives. 
Let the stench of blood fuel your lungs and bloodlust. 
Due west be our enemies. Can you see the oceans of spears?
Can you taste the fear in the air as we bring war? Form ranks and sound the 
charge! We press on to meet our fates and prize! To glorious ends and our 
path to ascension! They surround us, no telling if we will live or die but
by our blades they will lay! The trials among us are only obstacles played
by our minds and our heavy hearts. Honor guide me! Bless the blade that 
kisses flesh, that hastens death. Bring rise to the flames! Let these worms
see their demise! Nothing but darkness leads me now. The silence of the 
fallen fields. Though honor claimed, the soul is lost. Until we are here 
again. March on my brothers in arms, to the fields of which we forfeit our 
lives. Let the stench of blood fuel your lungs and bloodlust. Due east be 
our enemies. Can you see the oceans of spears? Can you taste the fear in 
the air as we bring war? The sounding charge,such music to my ears. The 
shrilling screams bring me home, and as the day drags on well stack the 
bodies high to let our rivals know of our resolve and our unending thirst 
to see the lights leave their eyes. Oh noble dead, who now lay among these 
battlefields, be forgotten not. The crowds will sing upon our return of darkened
days lightened by our edges swung, and the vanquished slayed in valor, 
and the courage forged in night. When no end of this doom is in 
sight. I see the vultures circle. I see the murders of crows. The valley 
painted in red. This blood on our hands must be washed by another's life, 
by another's life. Those who live by the sword perish, and those who die by 
the blade dream no more.
