As day fades to night I am horrified to see what Ive become. Once a man, 
now a shell of my former self and the beast within stirs with sleepless will, 
and I am hopeless to stop his unholy wrath. I hide in shadows to not be seen, 
a specter throughout the thickening mist cast out from a life that I once knew and loved.
The beast within stirs with sleepless will, and I am hopeless to stop this unholy wrath. 
What powers in me were left by the gods unchecked? Gone, as creeping night it dies 
it leaves me petrified and numb, and howling at the moon. What curses lurk inside 
this tainted blood that reeks of murder in the dark? The mirror on the wall reveals 
behind my burning eyes, and whats tearing under flesh. The time to accept what I am 
is becoming to hard to bear. This monster that I veil. Gone, as creeping night it dies 
it leaves me petrified and numb, and howling at the moon. What curses lurk inside this 
tainted blood that reeks of murder in the dark? My dreams, they turn to most horrible 
thoughts, where content, is this void filled by hunger.. The need to feed on the 
children of man! The time has come to stare upon the sky. To catch a glimpse of 
the curse that fills my veins. This monster that is bred from me is beginning 
to take control. The feral one comes, and he brings doom. I will feast upon 
your wretched hearts.
