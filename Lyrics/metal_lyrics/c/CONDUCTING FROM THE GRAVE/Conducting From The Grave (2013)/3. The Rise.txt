We drew the lines in time. We built and renewed. We defined our existence to reign supreme, 
untested, to reconstruct our lies. The fires of hell reach long for the souls that remain. 
The lives left scattered on the surface. Break the seals for judgement, to sever ties, 
to burn inside. Servants, oh people of the light, your time has come to fall. Replacing 
you with our wicked minds, we've come to take control and feed your souls with a 
steadfast hate to corrupt and drain, the blood that flows in all, and to silence 
the righteous voice. Cancerous clouds from the skies will shield the sun. 
The earth will quake and tremble. Death from above, will sheet all the lands and 
loam like rain. This world will serve us in chains.In chains. We are the ones that 
own you, you are all fucking slaves! Bow to your conquerors! No use in you resisting, 
you are all fucking slaves! Time to erase and feed! The fires shall empower the rise 
of oppressors, and the men who live to see the world burn. Burn! Cancerous clouds from
the skies will shield the sun, the earth will quake and tremble. death from above, 
will sheet all the lands and loam like rain. This world will serve us in chains as 
long as we, rule all the people, superior powers, our vile regime reigns immortal! 
We drew the lines in time. We built and renewed. We redefined our existence to 
reign supreme, untested, to reconstruct our lies.
