Born to be a symbol of forsaken paths of life, I strive to let it end or be the bringer of its doom. An empty 
vessel and a soulless mind I move, containing weaker men to act upon my baneful wills. I pray to nothing and 
no one, birthed unto this world to devour all, so get the fuck in line and do what you're told! Your days 
are numbered and I live to savor the means of my dominion of you. The last of your lines will live to see 
all its children bound in unyielding chains. The seas are endless, the waves in forming mass. One race with 
one purpose. And all will be complete. My moment to rise. Our moment to take control. Born to be a symbol 
of forsaken paths of life, I strive to let it end or be the bringer of its doom. An empty vessel and a soulless 
mind I move, containing weaker men to act upon my baneful wills. I am the end that you fear. Tyranny to bind and slave, 
tyranny to bind you fucking slaves. Now we control your lives we define your whole existence to ensure our gains. 
Now we control your lives, we define your whole existence to ensure our gains.. 
And all will be complete. My moment to rise. My moment to take control.
