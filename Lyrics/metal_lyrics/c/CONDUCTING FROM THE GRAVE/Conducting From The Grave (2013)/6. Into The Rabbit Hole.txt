The bell doth toll, the ringing stings in the vacant mind. A feeling all too real of my impending end, 
but I digress. Abhorrent one, who are you to claim reign of me, to judicate my sins to condemn my life? 
But oh this chamber speaks to me. The walls, they breathe and sing their twisted psalms, blood 
hymns, consumes where darkness creeps. In the voids will I wake, reborn, enlightened? Was I left to 
remain, chained to this lifeless cage? Will I rise from the depths, prevail unbroken, or will this 
abyss bring me to meet my early grave? Do I not see the rain turned glass? The shards that stab, 
unrelenting pain. Like winters cold, the swarming chills, there will be no warmth to comfort me.

meet my early grave? These stars that I see, the lights that now fade, they're calling my name. Though their 
voices seem to be the least welcoming. The pulse is starting to slow, the rhythm deranged. The means to an end 
that I never planned on becoming. Gone. In my tomb I will dwell, down the rabbit hole deeper still. I am the 
sleeper who dreams, the lidless eye that's stirring. An empty vessel to fill by my demons, and my haunting past. 
The ignorance bred from a confused mind and the will to peer. I am the reason you hunt for light. I am the reason 
you hide in fear when the dusk shrouds this lifeless earth.
