They say we're the last to see these days, to fill these chains, to share these bonds. 
We fear the coming of the dawn, and change that follows the tides that man has made. 
The void we create inside ourselves can never be filled without knowing why.
Our lives, are we not all the same, or is it easier to brand what we dread? 
Our world, this place engulfed in our bloodshed,
is our arrogant attempt at controlling what we are.
So now we take our shots in the dark to justify the reasons,
but this is who we are, endlessly crawling.
Now we leave ourselves in divide in spite of all this suffering,
but this is who we are, breathlessly calling, while leaving others to the flood.
here are all the signs? Will it ever change or turn around
or could it be we've already fallen? Are we left here to stand all alone?
Do we stand our ground? We're losing sight and we're out of mind as we begin 
to see it spiraling down. Converging will to spark the inner flame that is never ending, 
amassing prowess to decimate our fear
We look onward for the sunrise to come but we're never moving on.
Our lives, are we not all the same, or is it easier to brand what we dread? 
Our world, this place engulfed in our bloodshed, is our arrogant attempt at controlling what we are. 
It all repeats as if there's no insight to all we've murdered to retain our designs. 
We wait for the signs. 
Deliver us
We're are all the same, but will we change before its too late?
Devoured, enslaved to malice. Unchain us! Deliver us from our damnation! Unleash us from our fate!
