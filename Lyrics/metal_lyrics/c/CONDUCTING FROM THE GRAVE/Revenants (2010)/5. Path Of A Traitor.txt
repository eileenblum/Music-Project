slit throat sirens fill the air
with soundless shrieking songs
of when you will be long forgotten
can you see the grins of departed
that you had once betrayed
with your lie-filled eyes

monolithic visions of every still moment that youâve kept inside
the hallows of your shadow will haunt you until it completely devours you whole

unworthy of this life that youâve tainted in holding
the greatest sins in the highest
shall go unforgiven
these failures once cast out
have taken the form of a monster that wills
a foul release of hate

abominations that you have created shall purge you of your innocence and
faith as you are engulfed by the hands and strangled by the legions of damned

forsaken skies begin to burn
and the path of the damned shall be opened
now cling to the chains that youâve built

forsaken skies begin to burn
and the path of the damned shall be opened
revealing truth in your lies
holding you down by the weights of your falseness,
for all to see as they
rip the bowels out from your mouth
silencing your deception
tear the flesh off of your bones
to drain your strength and
feast on everything you are

the bringers of your end are here
and they are calling and they are waiting for you
for vengeance of your treachery
they live to burn you alive burn you alive

traitor
you fucking traitor
there shall be justice when you burn alive

forsaken skies begin to burn
and the path of the damned shall be opened
now cling to the chains that youâve built
forsaken skies begin to burn
and the path of the damned shall be opened up
