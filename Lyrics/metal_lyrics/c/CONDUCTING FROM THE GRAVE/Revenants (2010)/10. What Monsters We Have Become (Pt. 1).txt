In all my endeavors, observing weakness within this world
i have seen  amassed decaying ideals crumbling before the storm
where, destined to be ripped apart by its greed and emptiness
this age has seen its days only to be consumed by the souls of man
lives lead to brave the lines of impurities and wickedness
and those who have been lost shall remain astray
cast out and branded
left to drown in an ocean of liars in endless tides
a chance no one will take to change the fate of which their bound
on time we will surely seethe end
where all will face apart
into the sea
i witnessed so many failures built by the architects of misshapen dreamers and beggars
bluntly nailed to crosses of their own design
lost between the translations
praying to be of the less deserving of the fate the were given
bestowed by our judgments
in time we will surely see the end
where all will fall apart into the sea
severed into nations
then built on empires we have lost
to be renewed to define self righteous in our ignorance
and we feed on plagues
as we fall unto our doom
and the age shall come to pass
when we're no longer given breath
and then nothing shall see
what monsters we have become
