Crawling up from the surface that entombs
Feculent flesh entwined and maggots churning inside the stomachs
Such a beautiful sight for the morbidly deranged
Grotesque hemic form of the accursed
Stalking malicious monstrosities
Abide where the restless dead reside
Waiting for the light to abandon their prey
Oh mindless Revenants I summon thee to gorge upon the helpless, the docile and frail
Tear their worthless eyes from their heads and swill from their slitted necks
My cannibalistic dreams come alive
As I gaze upon this blood orgy from my ungodly throne
Imbued by the tongues of the darkest one
To lay forth on this earth my tainted will
Infallible are my words, my ways, my decrepit mind shows this path before me
I'll fill my bowels with the mangled sects of human flesh to quench my sullen purpose
Tempting, filling hatred
Torment, suffer, bane of my existence
I now command you as your master to kill the ones who dare oppose
Take the lives of who I deem unworthy
Hang them all by their fucking throats
Go forth my putrid army of undead
Bring forth upon this night a veil of dread
Feast upon the thews of mortal lives
Ripping like knives
