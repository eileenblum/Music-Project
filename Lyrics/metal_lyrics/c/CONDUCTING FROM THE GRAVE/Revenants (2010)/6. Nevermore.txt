Lowly do I sit, the night lay dormant as I muse the thoughts
Of lives passed, and reason with forgotten lore
Remembering within these halls, the curves around your face
Beauty lost; apparition haunting me, dancing in the pale moonlight
Such silence profound in the night
Until a ravens cry shatters repose
In the cold of winter nights, my hands are splintered from the beating
Of my fists upon the bloodied floors
A sanctuary lost within these hallowed halls, such emptiness abound
Such silence deafening to ears, but what's this pounding on my chamber door?
As if striking a hammer to bones
Is this the tone of my taker
As I count the days and nights
Watching shadows pass before my eyes
Years begin to crawl
And I shall hear your voice cry forevermore
And as this silence evolves with each heartbeat that echoes its fears
And in halls I shall hear your voice scream forevermore
And as the shadows grow long
Within the light that now fades in the mist
And in halls I shall remain in darkness forevermore
Confined in abysmal time
Showing no signs of release
Detained in horrific eyes
Piercing with a gaze of remorse
But there he rides on the winds of this gloom
And there he howls with an unearthly wail that shakes me
I sit and try to gasp for air, my chest is tight from apprehension
From this beast that dares to perch and mock my woes
Repeating shrieks of nevermore this wretched hound abounds and vexes me
Peering into my soul with hate, like hell fires spawned behind his gates
Is he the one that will take me away
To lay among the worms
As I sit and stare the pounding palpitates the pulse of blood that's frozen
Through my veins like lifeless corpse in rest
This ravens daunting prophecies have sparked a revelation in my mind
That all of this, my purgatory, shall repeat until I'm under stone
And still this creature insists that he crows
His demoniacal sight
As I count the days and nights, watching shadows pass before my eyes
Years begin to crawl
And I shall hear your voice cry forevermore
And as this silence evolves with each heartbeat that echoes its fears
And in these halls
I shall hear your voice scream forevermore
Confined in abysmal time
Showing no signs of release
Detained in horrific eyes
Piercing with a gaze of remorse
But there he rides on the winds of this gloom
And there he howls
