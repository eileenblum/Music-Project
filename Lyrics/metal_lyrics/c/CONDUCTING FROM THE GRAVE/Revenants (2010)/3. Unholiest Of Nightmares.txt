In the darkness of night
Walls crawl with the lurid shades of the deepest pits of hell
Devoid of time the pendulum swing arrests to an end
Gone is the illusion of solace and sanctuary
Replaced by abominations and visions of heinous shadows
And nothing can stop them
Lurking at the end where one dares enter slumber
Caressing the silken sheets with the coldness of the dead
Unholiest of nightmares dwell inside
Where visits of the damned will have you begging for your life
And there is no escaping what yearns for flesh suspended consciousness reviled
Such bitterness at rest will have you clasping for cherished light that has been smothered
By the hands of fiends
Lungs collapse from the weight of being that one cannot see
Demonic grasp bound the limbs and torso forcing down slowly crawling upon its victim laying in fear
Pounding upon the chest with ungodly strength that shreds the very soul of a man
Taunting are the howls that sill this foul scene
Driving one to madness with its zeal to plague
Unholiest of nightmares dwell inside
Where visits of the damned will have you begging for your life
Shadows creep into our minds
Sustenance is our sacred essence
Keepers of unholy sleep drown our thoughts with horrors of our hell
With horrors of our hell
And here I lay for eternity
She rides upon the chests paralyzing all but eyes
Drowns out the loudest screams, takes pleasure in silent cries
Haunting lifeless corpses to fill her needs
Malicious obscene monster with our dreams
Feasting on vile essence that broods in me
Dark demoness held captive in my sleep
