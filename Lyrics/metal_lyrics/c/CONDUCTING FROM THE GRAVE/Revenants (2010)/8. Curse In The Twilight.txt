A blackened night has cast its shadow upon the skies
not a sound to be heard from where the buried bodies hide
ceased from flowing are the rivers that seem to be touched
by icy hands of death himself
in the graveyard by the crypts where the dead rest
scribed into markers show the names of long forgotten
but all that's seen among the graves are the countless stones that lay
weathered
and all that's heard among the ruin is the sound of endless calm
beneath the mounds of unturned earth lay the restless gaze of the ones kept
entombed
confined to the crimes of our spent lives
we long to curse the stars
awake
bring back to life what was taken
and tell the tales of our lost souls
endure this pain no longer
break free from our prisons made
no tears we've shed
no longer go wasted
return to us what you've taken away
repay the crimson veins that you have slit
repair the broken souls you've soiled
horrendous sights
spine chilling realizations
bloodcurdling sense
unnerving all who's seen
destruction bound
the ones that silenced us
confined into the abyss
ride through the eventide
just to see the dawn of day
for a chance to feel alive
and when we see the stars and scream into the evening sky
we will curse the day that we were born
curse the day that we were born
awake all those who dream
all seeking solitude
your time has come to change your fate
and bring the courage of a million hearts of men
to desolate all who stand in our way
no longer will we forfeit the years we spent working for our gain
all of the tears we've shed are no longer wasted
awake
bring back to life what was taken
and tell the tales of our lost souls
endure this pain no longer
break free from our prisons made
no longer will we forfeit the years we spent working for our gain
all of the tears we've shed no longer go wasted
