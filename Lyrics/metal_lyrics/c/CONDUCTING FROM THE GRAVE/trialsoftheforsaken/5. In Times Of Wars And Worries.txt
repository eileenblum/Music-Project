I write in times of wars and worries for I set out to do battle with the likes of your past.
I engage in this onslaught with only my bare hands.
Clawing out my own eyes for yesterdays shadows.
Paint vivid pictures of lustful punctures.
I write in times of wars and worries for I set out to do battle with likes of your past.
In regards to my worries they have fallen prey in my manner, to my fortress and my enemy.
Pray for she in this time of war, she now is my salvation, my end till the end of this raging war
