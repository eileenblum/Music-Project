Maelstrom of wings and fear collide as
The usurpers wade through ranks of the
Fallen
Hallowed ground fades away under the
March of the dogmatic hordes
Swords drawn against impending odds,
Hell-bent on reclaiming what was once
Lost,
What was taken away, forbidden, for
Daring to forge a different vision
Gates shattered under the press of
Thousands, faces locked in an endless
Gaze of astonishment
Ill gotten trenchant thoughts dissolve
A stagnant alkaline kingdom
Seraphic legions repulse wave after
Wave of frenzied acolytes
Driven by thoughts of victory and
Conquest,
Ideals fouled and perverted by the
Twisted lust of the betrayer
Courage found through the strength of
Others
Frailty hidden through strength by
Numbers
Heaven's charges struggle push forth,
Or be fallen forever, and forgotten.
