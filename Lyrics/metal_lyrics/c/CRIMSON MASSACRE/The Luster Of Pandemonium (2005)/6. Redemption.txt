Escape from the Kingdom of maggots
And the tranquil comfort of Terra's
Embrace
Dionysian will, manifested in this
Malignant
Avatar of Torment
As a herald of the mourning star
Behold and tremble, the medium through
Which anguish flows
"Fall on your swords, you who are
Found wanting"
As the horned and holy are judged
Alike
One of nine, this Feral cyclone of
Retribution
Scything through this bountiful crop
Of Simian apathy
Within their arrogance they took our
Flame
And sought to bend it to their will.
Their ignorance shall be repaid ten
Fold.
Drink deep from the cup of wrath.
