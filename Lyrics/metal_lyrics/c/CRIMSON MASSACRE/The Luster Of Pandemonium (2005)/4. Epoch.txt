Memory echoes down the halls of
Antiquity
Tethered and broken wings scattered
Upon a bed of ashes
Spears thrust in Triumphant salute
Gaia's Divine Kingdom, a skeletal
Shadow
What remains when the lust of conquest
Fades
"Who will remember of hymns of war?"
Battle's clarion falls upon deaf ears
Never forget Immortality is gained
Through acts
As a smoldering brand pressed upon the
Skin of time
