A city shackled in the armor of sleep
Begotten through stone and steel
Spires stretch
Throne
Eyes set
Ever vigilant
Wardens and guardians of forgotten
Aeons
Beckoned by what once was, the
Betrayer,
Haunted by what was steps forth
Seized and entranced by thoughts
Like thorns
Whispers like embers fanned by noxious
Winds
To rebuild and make what once was
Resurrect the nefarious cabal,
Infect the children of clay and fire,
To leave their kingdom in flames
Surpass the weak,
Hellions suffering from illusions of
Grandeur
Reclaim what should have been.
Submit, and march, with trumpets
Blaring, silence the bleating of the
Lamb,
Submit, and raise your banner in
Triumphant salute
Submit, and your dreams will become
Clear, with a fanatical like
Intensity
Submit, and stretch wings across
A horror filled sky
