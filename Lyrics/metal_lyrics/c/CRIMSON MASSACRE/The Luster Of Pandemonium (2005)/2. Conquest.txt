Arise! A monarch, infernal tyrant,
Thundering down the left hand path.
A carrion wind, to devour the rot of
Diocese.
Stoic triumph of Iron and blood,
As legions of storm born extinguish
Hope's flame
Carving his Sigil into the flesh of
History,
Teaching a new language of wailing,
And
Gnashing of teeth
His throne a funeral pyre, paying
Court
To lifeless eyes, eternal reign over
Starless purity
As the moon is impaled by the rays of
The sun,
Bearing witness to an epoch of
Prometheus' will
Casting light of mercy's decapitation
A bestial roar of supremacy echoes
Unchallenged, and Undisputed as the
Infernos of Earth embrace the Heavens
