Seductive glimpses of empires foretold
Under the guise
Of promises whispered by unseen mouths
And barbed tongues
Of cancerous monoliths rising to defy
The heavens
A withered deceiver
With illuminus and shining ideals
To raise of scourge the backs of the
Pious
And enshackle the enslavers of past
Generations
Of those who dared to resist the only
Dreamers
And the followers who begged to share
In the ecstasy of defiance
But when dreamers dream, when
Perfection is jaded by the want of
More
When the utopia forged in rebellion,
War and youth,
Is locked between the winged and the
Horned
Awake Arise, or Be Forever Fallen
A hatred smoldering like the rays of
The Son.
Arise, and dare to lay claim to a
Vacant throne.
