Feast upon the entrails of eternity
Drenched with the molten blood of
Stars
The eyes of suns hang lifeless
Upon what once was Solaris' throne
A beauty in solitude, tranquil
Nothingness
A thousand frozen possibilities
Shatter
Against the will of the one who
Remains
To create from what is not, the anvil
Of the void, the hammer of I
And bring forth the thoughts of
Utopia, made
Real from the corpse of time.
An empire vomited from the elite mind
Purity tarnished by the want of
Worship.
A sacrifice made to dispel loneliness
Surreal acknowledgment of shallow
Wants
To pay homage to an ego drenched lord.
