The passage is open, they've unlocked the cage
The circle is broken, beware
Along came the thunder, the wind and the rage
A vortex of pleasure and pain

[BRIDGE]
The spectre within us is trying to come across
Pray, pray
A passage door, wide open
So step inside, don't be afraid
Voices calling
We're falling throught time and space

[CHORUS]
See what you want to see, be free
Never fear, the end is near
When your eyes are shut you'll see
The fields of yesterday

Inside the circle, something's not right
Dead silence is filling the air
Shivering, shaking, hands holding tight
I think it's the end of the line

[BRIDGE]
The spectre within us our contact link across
Stay, stay
So why won't you speak to us now
Why are you here, tell us why
Shadows falling
We're trapped in the circle of lies

[CHORUS]
See what you want to see, be free
Never fear, the end is near
When your eyes are shut you'll see
The fields of yesterday

Now the circle must be closed
Leave me here, leave me alone

[CHORUS]
See what you want to see, be free
Never fear, the end is near
When your eyes are shut you'll see
The fields of yesterday
