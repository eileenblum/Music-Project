The night is calling, vicious creatures all around
Moonlight shadows moving fast, beware don't make a sound
I am falling, into a void and I don't know
What awaits me beyond the point where no one dares to go

[BRIDGE]
What do I see when I gaze into the fire
This burning pain, please make it go away

[CHORUS]
Do you hear me
In my dreams I am possessed
Can you tell me
If God is merciless?

Hear the thunder, burn like fire in the rain
The witching hour, calling me screaming out my name

[BRIDGE]
Nothing to lose, I am drowning in the river
All my fears are staring back at me

[CHORUS]
Do you hear me
In my dreams I am possessed
Can you tell me
If God is merciless?

[CHORUS]
Do you hear me
In my dreams I am possessed
Can you tell me
If God is merciless?
