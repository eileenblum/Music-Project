When the night comes down
And I'm feeling cold
Shadows are moving around

I've been here before
Where the roads lead to nowhere
Please don't make a sound

[BRIDGE]
Up from the gutter thay will rise
With fiery eyes
And when the dungeon's calling
You'll hear my silent cries

[CHORUS]
They've been chasing my dreams
Running down the boulevard
I never thought I'd see the day
When the night is coming down, I pray

I am lost in a maze
Of stolen dreams
Lossing track of the time

Nothing here but screams
And the walls coming closer
Crawling down my spine

[BRIDGE]
Temptations lead me far beyond
The other side
I fear the end is coming
There's no place to hide

[CHORUS]
They've been chasing my dreams
Running down the boulevard
I never thought I'd see the day

[CHORUS]
What's left of my dreams?
In this dusk embracing scene
I never thought I'd live to see
When the day is turning, it's back on me
