Rising from the ashes
Stroming through the gates
The riders of the apocalypse fate

Sounding like the thunder
At the speed of light
The troops of the danmed will arise

[BRIDGE]
They're coming from above, descending down below
In shackles the dreams keep haunting
But don't you turn away, from the light of day
Then everything fades to black

[CHORUS]
Go back to Hell

The dawning of a new world
Eternal life in pain
Ashes to ashes, regain

Shadows coming closer
You begin to scream
Sound asleep, controlling your dreams

[BRIDGE]
We had to watch them die, nothing we could do
Our hands were in chains, we're bleeding
Now open up your eyes, before they say goodbye
And everything fades to black

[CHORUS]
Go back to Hell
