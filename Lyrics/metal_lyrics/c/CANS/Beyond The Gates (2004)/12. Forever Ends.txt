I see you comin', lookin' shiny and new
Just like a bullet in a brand new gun
You are the pony on a merry-go-round
All painted up and you're so ready to run

I feel the lightning hanging over the hill
And then I watch you on your rainbow ride
I hear you comin' from the top of the world
And you are beggin' me to be by your side again

[BRIDGE]
No, not me this time I'm gonna be strong
No, not we this time you're all on your own

[CHORUS]
It's a leap of faith that I just can't make
Something' that I won't believe in again
And it's killin' me but it's got to be
This is where our forever ends

You say forever like you know what it is
And then you show me that you don't have a clue
There's still some love in me that let's me forgive
But I will guarantee that I am so over you, you know

[BRIDGE]
No, not me this time I'm gonna be strong
No, not we this time you're all on your own

[CHORUS]
It's a leap of faith that I just can't make
Something' that I won't believe in again
And it's killin' me but it's got to be
This is where our forever ends

Watching as dreams turn into smoke
In your hands they slip away
Beating that love just like a drum
You are the child with all the games you play

[BRIDGE]
No, not me this time I'm gonna be strong
No, not we this time you're all on your own

[CHORUS]
It's a leap of faith that I just can't make
Something' that I won't believe in again
And it's killin' me but it's got to be
This is where our forever ends
