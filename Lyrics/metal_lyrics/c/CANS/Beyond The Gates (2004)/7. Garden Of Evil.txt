Descend from heaven
An angel in black
The outcast of evil
Sent to reign, enslave the human race

His will is done, they stole the sun
Left us to die
How could it be we couldn't see?
The warning signs
No time lose, we have to choose
To live or to die
A total eclipse of our minds

[BRIDGE]
The end is near, we must be going
Time will tell, descending down to Hell

[CHORUS]
In the garden of evil the sun will arise
When the last one survivor has killed the unborn child
In the garden of evil the innocent dies
Let us summon the spirits, the call of the wild

They came out of nowhere
In darkness and pain
They came with a reason
To kill the light and seize the soothing rain

Behold the light, behold the skies
It fades away
How can it be, when we are free
We cannot stay
Don't turn around, don't make a sound
The time has come
The rivers turning red, pray for the sun

[BRIDGE]
The end is near, we must be going
Time will tell, descending down to Hell

[CHORUS]
In the garden of evil the sun will arise
When the last one survivor has killed the unborn child
In the garden of evil the innocent dies
Let us summon the spirits, the call of the wild
