I move across the earth
Dark shadows call my name
I am the chosen one, I am insane

I am your darkest fear
Your sinner and your saint
Through all eternity I set my sail

You cannot sleep at night
Still haunted, feel the fright
Your final revelation

Cold sweat, burning fear
You know the end is near
The ruler of the wastelands

[CHORUS]
Wielding the axe
Behold the bloodstains on the floor
Wielding the axe
I am the soul collector

Inside a raging storm
My spirit was reborn
Thy sins, the spark to feed my flames

You feel the cold winds below
I'm breathing down your neck
Countdown, I'm ready to attack

Reflections from the blade
Your screams begin to fade
I'll bring you salvation

Red hot, burning steel
The powers that I feel
The cure for my damnation

[CHORUS]
Wielding the axe
Behold the bloodstains on the floor
Wielding the axe
I am the soul collector
