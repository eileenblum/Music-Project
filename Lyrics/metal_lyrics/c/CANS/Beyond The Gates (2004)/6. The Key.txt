In a world of eternal darkness
At a place of long lost innocence
They obey someone else's master
They're just puppets on a broken string

In a time of undying fury
This creation is bound to fall
Down in hell, there's no gold, no glory
Hear the children as they start to pray

[CHORUS]
Here the voices of anger screaming
Please unlock these chains
We beg you, have mercy
We will cede you
The key to the undying world

Sombre days, yet a cryptic kingdom
Nothing lives, nothing breathes no more
All their lives they have reached for heaven
In silent prayers, they have lost their fear

They will arise from severe oppression
Out of the ashes they will rise once more
And then the light will prevail the darkness
Raise the flag and let us close this door

[CHORUS]
Here the voices of anger screaming
Please unlock these chains
We beg you, have mercy
We will cede you
The key to the undying world
