Bloodstains on the floor
Distant screams across the hall
Behind every door waits death and sorrow

[BRIDGE]
In this evil nest
Life is put up to a test
That we must take or there is no tomorrow

[CHORUS]
Signs, written on the sky
Telling all but lies
For me it's do or die...die
Signs, in the dead of night
Turning darkness to light
Making wrong seem right

Creatures of the night
Waiting for the unborn child
To arrive and lead them through the darkness

[BRIDGE]
Rivers turning red
Feeding powers to the dead
Immortality, their final cares

[CHORUS]
Signs, written on the sky
Telling all but lies
For me it's do or die...die
Signs, in the dead of night
Turning darkness to light
Making wrong seem right

[BRIDGE]
Standing on my own
Waiting for the newborn day
My eyes are open wide
I'm resurrected

[CHORUS]
Signs, written on the sky
Telling all but lies
For me it's do or die...die
Signs, in the dead of night
Turning darkness to light
Making wrong seem right
