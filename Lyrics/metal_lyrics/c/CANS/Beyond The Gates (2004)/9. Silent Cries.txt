How can I take on this mission?
That I've been told to do
My hands are tied, I am crucified
I'm a stranger in a strange land

So now I'm feeling the pressure
It's boiling up inside
Where hatred only grows stronger
Comes a man, a beast, a killing machine

[BRIDGE]
And visions that are haunting me
Through my blind eyes I still can see
The mission has to be done

[CHORUS]
Silent cries, the spirit dies
By the hands of the innocent
Before blue skies will fade to black

On a darkened horizon
The clouds are closing in
When skies are fading to black again
Hold your breath, I'm ready to attack

So now I'm caught in the action
There's nothing left to do
I fear the end coming nearer
Pull the trigger, now the curtain's closed

[BRIDGE]
And all is coming back to me
Through open eyes I cannot see
The mission had to be done

[CHORUS]
Silent cries, the spirit dies
By the hands of the innocent
Before blue skies will fade to black

[CHORUS]
Silent cries, the spirit dies
Wash my hands of the innocent
I close my eyes and say goodbye
