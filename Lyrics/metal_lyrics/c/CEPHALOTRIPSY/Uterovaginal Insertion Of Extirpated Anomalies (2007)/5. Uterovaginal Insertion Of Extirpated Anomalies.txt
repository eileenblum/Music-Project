Enmeshed, slipping into succulence
Voraciously scraping for imbued
Remnants soaking in the encumbrance
Of the despicable enmity
Harvesting the extirpated
Rotting divinity collecting a brood
Of sickly sliced cuts covered
And dripping of the entity's cleavings
Unceasingly amassed, piled into heaps
To cater the women, awaiting.
Endlessly languishing, grieving
And bleeding disfigured and dismembered
Of lascivious beatings her figure lies
Shrouded entirely, of infamy
Taxidermal stuffings upon her
Abhorred cavity reinsertion of extirpated anomalies
Collecting a brood of sickly sliced cuts
Covered and dripping of the entities cleavings
unceasingly amassed and piled into heaps.
Spreading her stumps and ripping at skin
of her womb, stretched wide open,
Grasping fists full of scraps
From waste bins beneath, then
Pounding in pulp uterovaginally,
Continuously. Bloating and stretching,
Ripping and Splitting
Her uterus so full,
She begins excreting
Her uterus so full
Abdominally oozing
Vaginally digested
Recaptivated chunks of aborted anomalies.
