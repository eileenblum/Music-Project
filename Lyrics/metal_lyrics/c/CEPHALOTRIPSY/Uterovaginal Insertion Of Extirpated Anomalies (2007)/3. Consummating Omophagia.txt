Depths of defamation,
Disseminating deception
Imperative formation for an
Impending discern
Bound on an embedding of her
Own severed limbs
A defiled, naked, limbless torso.
Bearing no human resemblance
Through stale eyes she stares
Mesmerized by sight of a crippling onset.
Infectious veiled sacs begin to spill
Revealing the foreseen abscess of life
Her esophagous, scabbed, and now
Beginning to fill
The lacerations from my blood-soaked knife
Gorging on the remains of her own bitter end
So livid, so vile, internally infectious
As deep as any burial infesting within.
Scrutiniously scraping at repulsive wet meat
Strips of flayed flesh dress my taste
For redemption
A scourging recital devised amidst
The shoulders
Of this immense impulsion, stuffing
Her slit-throat
With her repugnant last feast
Regurgitated consumption of
Inherent iniquity
Digesting, consentually divesting
Perpetually rendering, force-fed, her
Own intestines
Clumps of undigestable, intestinal pieces
Immersed in pools of laryngeal lesions
Absorbing befouled sanguine fluid
This fluent so foul, forcing ingestment.
