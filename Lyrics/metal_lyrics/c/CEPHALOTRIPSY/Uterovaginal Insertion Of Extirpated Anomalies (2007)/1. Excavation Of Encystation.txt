Encroaching upon bloated encrustation
Encrusted, the encystation of impurity
An excavation of excruciating torment
Excavating every morsel of malignant pieces.
Splitting, cracking, leaking and seeping
The inflated slabs of meat begin secreting
Heaps of rotting defiled corpses amound
Excreting and dripping, I begin ripping
Heads from torsos
Limbs from sockets
And extracting the innards
From abdomens.
Hallowed and rotten
All cleansed of impurity
Hollowed of carniverous dwellings
Of disemboweling and dismembering.
Consecrated in carneous collections
Carved and dissected,
Baptised in blood and dysentery sludge
Of only veins and conceptacle chunks
Withhold the seed of the forsaken spawn,
The forsaken spawn.
Splitting, cracking, leaking and seeping
Heaps of rotting defiled corpses amound
Excreting and dripping
Cleansed in purity
Through divine butchery
Scabbing of the mutilated
Brings impurity to it's entirety.
