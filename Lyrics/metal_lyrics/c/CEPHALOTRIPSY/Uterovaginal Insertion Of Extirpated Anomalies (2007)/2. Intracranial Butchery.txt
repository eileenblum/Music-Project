An experiment in cannibalistic surgery
Culminated with much alaricity
Voracious dermal exfoliation
Skin is peeled away
Cranial ostectomy, fragments of bone removed
Perforating the brain of my victim
Removal of the cerebrum
Dissecting the lobes as they ooze foul liquid
Colation of desired cranial segments
For the sole purpose of consumption
Lobotomy turned cephalic feast
I ingest the thalami and corpus callosum
Gorging on gray matter
Mouth so full
Of these bloody chunks I cannot swallow
I begin to vomit brain matter
Uncontrollable hypremesis
I begin to vomit brain matter
Uncontrollable hypremesis
My meal now lay splattered before me
I won't let this mess go to waste
Slurping up bile soaked pieces from the floor
Choking down each viscid lump
Slurping up bile soaked pieces from the floor
Choking down each viscid lump
Discharging momentarily I continue to purge
Not ceasing until all has been devoured
The only remnants to be found in my feces.
