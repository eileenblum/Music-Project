Headless, headless bodies hang
Upside down from sharpened meat hooks
Pendulously swinging,
Cleaving through extravagately
Ripping, ripping innards
From the torsos of the impaled whores.
Disseminated skin flayed from ten human heads
Occluded and distended, upholstered dead flesh
Emasculate, discarnate, debauchery with the dead
Molesting the mutilated decaying women.
Dissimulated, of vulvas and breasts, noses and lips,
Skin and bones, faces and heads
Articulation, of vulvas and breasts, noses and lips,
Skin and bones, faces and heads.
Hacked, split, cut and tendered
parts are taken from bodies dismembered
Next to the skinned faces of ten women
Roasting begins, of the eviscerated.
Disguised behind the skin of others
Devouring meat of the recently butchered
Egregious mounds of flesh ingested
Before rotting defiled corpses, beheaded.
Dissimulated, of vulvas and breasts, noses and lips,
Skin and bones, faces and heads
Articulation, of vulvas and breasts, noses and lips,
Skin and bones, faces and heads.
Trussed up and dressed out
Controlling thoughts consume thee
Exsanguination of blood emits intertwined intestines
Disseminated skin flayed from ten human heads
Occluded and distended, upholstered dead flesh
Emasculate, discarnate, debauchery with the dead
Molesting the mutilated decaying women.
Dissimulated, of vulvas and breasts, noses and lips,
Skin and bones, and the faces of death
Articulation, of vulvas and breasts, noses and lips,
Skin and bones, and the faces of death
Pleasure is found in butchering humans.
