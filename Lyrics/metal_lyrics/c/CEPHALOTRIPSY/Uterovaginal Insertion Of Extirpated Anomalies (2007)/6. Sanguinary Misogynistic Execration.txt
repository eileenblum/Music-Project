An assortment of instruments
Designed for torture
Shrouded in remnants of the
Recently butchered
Celiatic incisions will prepare the needs,
Of cleaving this being of inferior deeds.
Dysphotically dissecting,
Her figure disarrayed and
Shackled to the slab
Subphernically punctured
This ventrotomy will serve ease
Of an anal celioctomy, an
Abdominal cecostomy.
Now occluded and entering empathetically
Celiatic intercourse excites me
Distending and ripping melanosis
Celiocenthetic sludge moistens this fistula
Saturated in tepid abdominal excretion
Asphyxiating the steaming septic secretion
Orifices erupt melena, induced
And juiced intestinal fluid
Ingesting excrescence, splattered bowels pour
bile immerses my throat.
Emulsifying crusting corpulence
Extracting ruptured vessels
Induced copremesis, vomiting excrement
Flesh floats abroad lympathic phlegm
Coagulation weakness, clotting collapses
Sewage flows soaking, pulsating pustules
Intestinal excrement embraces chunks
This excrement convulsed
