My will is invulnerable like air with the sound of my voice
the universe shrinks in a wrinkle of pain.
Listen to me. I will nourish your flesh with blood dew
Explore the labyrinth of memory and free yourself
from the hypertrophy of remembrance.
I want to awake from paralysis the icons buried
in the absence and disharmony so that they can
enjoy again an instant of contemplation
and penetrate the realms of senses.
This is the final call, the time of rebirth and catharsis
the quietness after the storm
Univocal language of phrases ancient like music
Relish the essence of this immaterial fluid
Principle of aggregation and disgregation,
everywhere and nowhere
Forsake the anguish and waver in the absolute freedom
Let stasis convert into motion
and let your essence strip of all lies.
Throw your dice and enjoy the chance
The moon could not appear again.
