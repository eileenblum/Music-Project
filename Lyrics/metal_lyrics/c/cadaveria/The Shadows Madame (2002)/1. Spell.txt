Beautiful witch give light to this black muddy sky
Snatch darkness from these hours
devoid of evening and morning
devoid of stars and funereal lightnings.
There is a path with no light and no moon
I ran through it to rescue my flesh
from the poisoned darts.
Modify your mind follow the shapes
from the red seven to the blue one
Mark the sacred space
In the name of wind and sound
Say your solemn prayer to the burning fire
Invoke the grace of water sources and raging oceans
Invite earth's creatures to your dance.
May Rafe lead my soul to victory
He's the master of my turbid game
May his energy bless my hand when I move the pieces
His power protects my secret plan
May his genius hasten the times
His presence secures my triumph.
Enemies' minds are frozen in a cloud of impotence
Their projects are sentenced to fail
No acts in the present, no acts in the future.
Now destiny is engraved on eternal memories.
Cosmic energies will spread it in the Universe.
No forces in their bodies No life in their souls.
