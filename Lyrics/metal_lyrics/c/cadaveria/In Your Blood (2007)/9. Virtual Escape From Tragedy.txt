Feel the frequency
Perceive your pulse
Trust the ideology
To capture the ancient secret of life.
I'm looking for the antidote to myself
I'm working for my heart's freedom
To rid myself of the other side of me.
To rid myself of this virtual escape from tragedy
Hypochondriac creature
Disturbed by his memory
One single disease to cure
But you think of the rest.
It's not as tragic as you believe
Just free your mind of fears, life is pulsing.
Just feel its frequency.
Life is pulsing, just feel it.
Just feel the frequency of this virtual escape from tragedy.
