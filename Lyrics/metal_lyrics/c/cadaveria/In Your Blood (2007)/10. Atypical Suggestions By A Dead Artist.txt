I love people who make things
I love conversations.
I saw people inside a wrapping
Like a protective veil for their soul.
Atypical suggestions by a dead artist
I recorded my image on a film still
To seal my existing condition.
I praised appearance and style
while I was visiting exhibitions to fight boredom and depression,
to satisfy my thirst of visual celebrations and of intellectual
stimulations.
Atypical suggestions by a dead artist
I experienced the hallucination of panic
Through sweat, breathing and suffocation.
And I found again my direction
When I spoke to a man who told me what I wanted to hear.
I need to be loved once in a day.
I need two days to re-enter from my mental disease.
I need to be loved once in a day.
