May this poetry remain in your heart
May these notes inebriate your senses
This could be the last chance to light your fire
Before time turn your mind to black
Take a decision about your future
Dare use your invention
Gather up your experiences
Before your energy weaken to black
Shout your ideas
Before your voice vanish into black
Let your love be released
Before the last shine fade to black
Shout your, your ideas
Before oblivion suffocate your breath
Let your love be released
Before the last shine fade to black
May this poetry remain in your heart
May these notes inebriate your senses
This is a gift for you all
Do not forget to accept it before
laying in black
laying...
