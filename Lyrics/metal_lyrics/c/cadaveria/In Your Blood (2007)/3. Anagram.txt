Thirst for life is delightful
Thirst for fame reawakens
Don't tell me to stop thinking,
Don't force me to stop acting,
Don't make me stop speaking...
You can't change me
I would never explain it again.
You don't know me
You can't understand my words
You perceive a parallel idea of me
Like a coral generated by gemmation.
You don't see my heart is transparent.
You don't perceive I'm totally open
You don't feel my willingness
You don't trust my clearness
You misunderstand my essence.
Anagrammatize my psychotic dreams
And you will find out myself.
