... If you drive your glance too much in the abyss,
The abyss penetrates yourself with its glance.
Remember every fear hides a desire
And that desire means tension...
Faith is the enemy of knowledge,
Religion produces placebo effects...
The contact with the divine is always beneficial,
Even if it is only in your head...
Tension is vitality
While perfection is death...
Desire means tension
Religion produces placebo effects...
Faith is the enemy of knowledge,
Religion produces placebo effects,
The contact with the divine is always beneficial,
Even if it is only in your head...
