There is a fracture in contemporary thought
between tension and fragility
between voracity and fear of an imminent explosion.
Syndrome of over-nourishment
Perception of a latent loss
Bipolarity
Innovation in permanent contrast with the past.
Modern artists, like perverted creatures drowned in plastic,
explore encoded forms of expression
inverting the logical sequence of musical score.
