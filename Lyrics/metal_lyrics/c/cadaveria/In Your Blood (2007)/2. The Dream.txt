After foggy and funereal days
In a mixture of sadness and devotion,
memory and mental escape
I take back my life
A bit confused, but more conscious of my way.
I wish warm affections
True emotions
Absence of artifice.
I want to rock myself on my arts
Enjoying the new time
But I don't forget where I come from
and people who loved me.
