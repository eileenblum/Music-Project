A veiled fog alights on the dark skin of the night
I crossed it pensive, with the heart full of hope.
Today I spoke again with the man, who taught me to dare
His face is grievously embalmed in baked clay.

But his spirit continues to pulse inside me.
He said: âsometimes you need to risk, to do something else,
ought to forgo guarantees, âcause they are also compulsionsâ.

His words are my oracle, also after a long time.
I told my story to him
And his eyes turned into a loving smile.

There is silence now
The beasts have arrived
and their fangs have caught them all,
but me.

The oracle of the fog prophesied a favourable destiny
The spirit of the right conscience will pulse
inside me forever and ever and ever.
A veiled fog alights on the dark skin of the night

A veiled fog alights on the dark skin of the night
I crossed it pensive, with the heart full of hope.
