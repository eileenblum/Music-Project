Every night the man rises his imaginary stage
in his theatre he becomes actor, spectator of himself
Every night the man rises his imaginary stage
The man is dreaming.

I dream to float on my lifeâs surface
I am the stranger who looks inside.

I am not the material body,
constructed by the seven elements.
I am not the five senses, the hearing, the taste, the olfaction, the touch, the sight.

And I am not the sound, the savour, the smell, the matter, the seeing.
And I am not the five knowledge elements, the speaking, the movement, the feeling.

I am not the five vital breaths
nether I am the thinking mind
And I am not the memory,
concerning the residual impressions of objects.

I am a dreamer, who hates illusions
and this produces the vicious rage Iâm not able to refuse.
I lost myself in darkness.

In the obscurity I find myself again
I annihilated myself and now I get
conscience of my power
I burn out and I reborn
I desire and my unconscious satisfies me.

I dream to float on my lifeâs surface
I am the stranger who looks insideâ¦
I am a dreamer, who hates illusions.
