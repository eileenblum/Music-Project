Much madness is divinest sense,
demur and be dangerous.
I had been hungry of news, creativity and freedom,
Now I can eat of them and Iâm not sated yet.

And now I roam the sovereign woods
And every time I speak the mountains straight reply.

I have the power to kill without the power to die,
but I have no enemies and I donât need revenge.
I donât know death nor defeat
Even if I marched in the sewer of hell.

Much madness is divinest sense,
demur and be dangerous.
I had been thirsty of knowledge, action and bravery
Now I can rule my flesh and I wonât save a place for your death.

Now I can keep agony away.
And I refuse men escaping from the mind of man.
Witchcraft was hung, but I find the magic I need inside me every day.
I donât believe in sins nor in temptation
Even if I crept into the womb of the beast.
Now I can keep agony away.
