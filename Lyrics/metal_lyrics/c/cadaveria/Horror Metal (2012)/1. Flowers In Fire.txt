I woke up from a driven coma.
Around me bewildered glances, stunned by fear,
Ghosts with bruised bodies.
Faces obscure and sting.

Who donât know anything about themselves.
The night annihilated what they built during the day.
Daylight promotes the weary comedy of courtesy,
With the favour of darkness the heroin of denial comes.

Flowers in fire.
Torturing visions.
Withdrawal of anguishes.
Blood-soaked wadding

Flowers in fire.
Torturing visions.
Around me bewildered glances,
stunned by fear.

I was guided by your scent, toward enchanting climes
A speedy fire ran my veins and knocked at my heart.
My brain is bleeding, pierced by surgical tool
Raped and slaughtered to make me feel good.

Flowers in fire.
Torturing visions.
Withdrawal of anguishes.
Blood-soaked wadding.

Flowers in fire.
Torturing visions.
Around me bewildered glances,
stunned by fear.

I refused to modify my genealogical inheritance
âCause I was afraid the mirror would have ceased to shine
stiff and pitifully unsatisfied by existence
awfully crucified to life.

I woke up from a driven coma, it was necessary.
Around me bewildered glances, stunned by fear,
Ghosts with bruised bodies.
Faces obscure and sting.
