Bewitched by the eternal rhythm of divine breath,
Perverse he smiled to the prickly knock of rain drops,
His body was cruel like beauty,
His eyes incandescent like silk.

Transfixed by an absolute lightning of freedom,
He freed himself in an uncensored dance.
Possessed by a pressing desire of being,
Fibrillation of misleading welfare.

Star,
Unreachable demiurge,
Ice, frost and silence.

A light dyed with ghost-white his heart,
Gusts of jade struck his memory.

A light dyed with ghost-white his heart,
Gusts of jade struck his memory.

A light dyed with ghost-white his heart,
Gusts of jade struck his memory.

Icon of collective dreams
Pulverized by magic fears
Ancient gold of a waste land.
Pulverized by magic fears

He turned his thoughts,
Thoughts into words
Words and his words
Into actions, into actions, into actions, into actions

Words and his words
Into actions, into actions, into actions, into actions

Transfixed by an absolute lightning of freedom,
He freed himself in an uncensored dance.
Possessed by a pressing desire of being,
Fibrillation of misleading welfare.

And his moan was like a sweet chant without words.
And his moan was like a sweet chant without words.
