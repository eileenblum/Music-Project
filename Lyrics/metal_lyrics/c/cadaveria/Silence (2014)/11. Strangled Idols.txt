I contemplate only shreds of truth, that nocturnal gusts make whirlpool
Strangled idols, seduced souls, opaque state of joy
Time after time all idols have been strangled.
resignation to uncertainty, resignation to the essential asymmetry of the world.
Day after day the idols have been strangled.
In this mute instant of silence all reality seems to have its own reason to exist.
Iâm two voices, duality, Iâm a witch that must not count to ten
Time after time all idols have been strangled.
resignation to uncertainty, resignation to the essential asymmetry of the world.
Day after day all idols have been strangled.
In this mute instant of silence all reality seems to have its own reason to exist.
Life! Death! Time! Pain! Joy! Silence!
An instance of silence between two noises of life
Cut throat of not lived time
shredded leaves of my wretched life
Death glance, bringer of life
shelled by the system, blinded by faith
guided by instinct, armoured by pain
Time after time all idols have been strangled.
resignation to uncertainty, resignation to this shutter world.
Time after time all idols have been strangled.
Resignation to uncertainty, resignation to this shutter world.
Day after day all the idols have been strangled
In this pure instant of silence, infected by seduced souls.
