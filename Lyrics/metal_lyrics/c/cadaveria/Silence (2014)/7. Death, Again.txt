Overheated by passion, wired by the wind and nature
Surfing on the other side of the world
Ho sentito il mio corpo permearsi di paura
To lose all what I gained before
âcause when you think to defeat it
or at least to pander it, to accept it,
understand it, synthesize it, exorcise it, elaborate it,
here she comes again, the death, when you were not expecting her.
She wears young clothes, she has weaved
but she opens old wounds again.
Queen, triumphant queen,
inconceivable and sovereign mystery.
Time, time, we never get enough of you.
I dreamt to be bitten by a dog I dreamt to give birth
I dreamt to die and to see myself blowing out
I dreamt to be swallowed by the fog I dreamt to be a toy
I dreamt to be pierced by thousands needles
I didnât feel any pain, I felt nothing!
Here she comes again, the death, when you were not expecting her.
She wears young clothes, she has weaved
but she opens old wounds again.
Queen, queen, triumphant queen, inconceivable and sovereign mystery.
