In a fireflies world already gone when we begin to look at it
Interested in anything disinterested in production
In this fireflies world
Arriving on the threshold of a half-life
Iâm troubled by the thought of living only half
I get worked up about the heat of parading,
debilitated by the anxiety of inspecting me inside.
I love men of the great contempt, they are also the men of the great veneration
In life, rather than in chess, the game goes on even after the checkmate.
In a fireflies world already gone when we begin to look at it
Interested in anything disinterested in production
In this fireflies world
Arriving on the threshold of a half-life
I count the forever things I have done
My soul, my skin, the only responsibility
My soul, my skin, testimonies of existence
I love men of the great contempt, they are also the men of the great veneration
In life, rather than in chess, the game goes on even after the checkmate.
