There is a feeling, probably a sensation, that arises in me today.
Itâs like a strange form of irrepressible inclination to weeping and rest.
I canât decipher the weeping reason.
There is an implied joy, but these tears are not flowing for joy.
It could be this sick music Iâm listening to and the consciousness to be alone,
although Iâm going to meet the world.
All my fears come true
All my nightmares come true
It wonât be the dark that will send my soul to sleep.
It wonât be the sun to awake my soul, Iâm alive!
Iâm free and satisfied.
Iâm alive, at least until you survive.
The soul that doesnât sleep
My, my soul will never sleep
There is a feeling, probably a sensation, that arises in me today.
Itâs like a strange form of irrepressible inclination to weeping and rest.
I am alive, at least until you survive.
