Here is me again. Hereâs who I am
I live day by day with long term projects
Here is where I arrived
Every day a new tile.
I continue to feel a gap
Something that I call loneliness
I must find a solitude moment to write,
and then music will be born by itself.
This is my path, this is my knowledge
Eating the fruits of a hard long work
You need a great wish to be
Here is where I arrived
Every day a new tile.
I continue to feel a gap
Something that I call loneliness
Lives and souls that seems to touch each other
But thatâll never reach the infinity.
