This is a nameless night, but itâs so meaningful
Almost perfect it is the scenery
The snow, a party elsewhereâ¦
Somebody in a bed of sex and pleasure.
Letâs soil of blood this pure white falling snow
Allâs rising and falling in lies
Allâs rising and falling in lies
Lack of answers, absence of truth
Thoughts and actions are overloaded by structures
Find the force to convert this state of absolute absence
in a cradle of art and knowledge
Letâs soil of blood this pure white falling snow
Allâs rising and falling in lies
A feeble light to look at for a while
I want to fly, release my free spirit
Letâs soil of blood this pure white falling snow
Allâs rising and falling in lies
Inconsistent body, catatonic state of mind
no hurry in this night
no hurry in this night.
Inconsistent body, catatonic state of mind
Delicious and sublime
Delicious and sublime.
