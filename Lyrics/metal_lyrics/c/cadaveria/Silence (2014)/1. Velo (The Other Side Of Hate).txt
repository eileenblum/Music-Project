I know it will not be forever, but this is happiness and itâs enough
Now I can see the colors
Now I can feel the voice of silence and satisfy my soul
No way to think to anything else
Deep and new vibrations are engaging my mind
Now I can see the colors
Now I can feel the voice of silence and satisfy my soul
I hate orders. Iâm extreme.
Openness and sincerity
Donât look for anything more,
no property, no egoism, no plans
just give me a reason to come back and stay
No lies, no shells
Do what you feel and prefer
Truth is so liberating â There is greatness in you
Truth is so liberating â Donât betray yourself
I hate orders. Iâm extreme.
No lies, no shells, no egoism, no plans
There is greatness in you. Do not betray yourself.
Deep and new vibrations are now engaging my mind
I wish to soothe myself and extinguish
Donât run!
Velo
No property, no egoism, no plans
The other side of hate.
