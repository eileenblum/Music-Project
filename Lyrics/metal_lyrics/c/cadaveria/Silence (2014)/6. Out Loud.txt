Silence!
Permeated by a warm and heavy embrace
I still donât know what it was
Fear of being disappointed again and again
Faithful to my sixth sense.
Torment and dissolution
Pain, I must recover in music
I thought you were so immense
While they were just sensations.
Permeated by my light I touch the stars
Rising from my abyss
Dominated by my wish Iâve no regrets
Hiding myself in darkness I ask for silence
Torment and dissolution. Pain, I must recover in music
I thought you were so immense
While they were just sensations.
Iâve already expiated enough
I leave you to your damnations.
Seedy forces have exploited my heart. Only music can now save my soul!
I ask for silence! Torment and dissolution
Pain, I must recover in music
I thought you were so immense
While they were just illusions.
Iâm asking for silence, out loud.
