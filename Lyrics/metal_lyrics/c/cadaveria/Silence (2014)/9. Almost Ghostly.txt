Understood Iâm plain when I express myself, suffering when
I must censor myself for unknown reasons.
Anything wrong in this?
Whatâs the boundary between be real and faithful to your soul and let things happen how they
have to go? Between free will and destiny?
Feeling time flowing, perceiving life elapsing
Almost ghostly, blindness follows
Light comes from above
They sit on the branches waiting for the wind
Endangered
I will want passion, I want love
We are the centre, we came first
Murmur words of fire as we came first,
before everybody, before all.
Almost ghostly, almost blur
Forever faithful to our souls
Almost ghostly, almost blur
The light is coming from above
