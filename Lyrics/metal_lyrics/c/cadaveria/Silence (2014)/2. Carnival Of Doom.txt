Colors, transfigurations, the absurd, the freak.
Come, come ladies and gentlemen
Merry-go-round and sweets
Welcome to this crazy show
Insane asylum for the voices of madness
Poetry and folly as antidotes to life
Vortex of vampires and of blood-soaked nurses
This is the carnival of doom.
This journey begins after darkness.
The beasts will soon dance in the fire
This is the carnival of doom
Colors, transfigurations, the absurd, the freak.
Come, come ladies and gentlemen
Merry-go-round and sweets
Fire-eaters, teddy bears, prizes and guns
Tumblers of the shadows
Contortionists of the spirit
Acrobats of destiny
Youâll experiment the fascination of this Nirvana of noise
Jugglers of life playing with tarots of hope
A Nirvana of noise.
This is the carnival of doom.
