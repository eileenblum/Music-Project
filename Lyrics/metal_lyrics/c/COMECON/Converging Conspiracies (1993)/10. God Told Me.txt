[Originally performed by Dr. Know]

Thursday morning at 7 A. M.
A young boy found dead in a garbage can
When apprehended the police asked why
"God told me to"was my reply

Voluntary manslaughter
Killing in the heat of passion
By another's command
Killing for God

In my room a dog lies dead
A crucifix pounded through his head
I hung him high to drain his blood
God told me that I should

Voluntary manslaughter
Killing in the heat of passion
By another's command
Killing for God
