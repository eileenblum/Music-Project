Mawkish vulture undigniflies
Call him uncle and he will rise
from the newsstand mediate crapitation

Face me down 
Death your crown
Bring your waffle and raffle
fair fair

Glaring darkness fraught with strife
and we jokingly call it life
Brutalized like demigods dissalvation

Face me down
Death your crown
Bring your waffle and raffle
fair fair
