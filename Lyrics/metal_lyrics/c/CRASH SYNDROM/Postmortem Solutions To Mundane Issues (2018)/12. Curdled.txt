Operated, took to pieces
Cultivate fungus, mold and sores
Pour the purulent blister
By the formalin and hartshorn
Curdled, your entrails fermenting
Foam and alcoholizated
Bacterial fermentation
Stink damp gurgle in eye-liquid
Mash
Under-parietal curdling
Under-parietal curdling
Viscous, juices tinctured
Fungal rump, decomposed, suffer
The damage, as anatomized
Hothouse with microlouses
Huddles endoparasites and slime
Sick activity in your greenish hide
Adipose tissue foul
Your organics - depot of food
Under-parietal curdling
Under-parietal curdling
