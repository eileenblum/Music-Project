Locked in sombre labyrinth
Of mental surrealistic mind
Surrounding sense haze of filth
Frontal lobes treated with morphine
Psychopathological imbecility
Brain epileptic waltz
Unbalanced tic, debility
My opera by nervous ganglion
...reduce to exhaustion...
Saliva drip from lips
Buried in my mental cist
Forgotten and outcast
Idiots comes to my experiments
Mind cramp
Psychoconvulsion
Nervous system spasm
Current brain destruction
