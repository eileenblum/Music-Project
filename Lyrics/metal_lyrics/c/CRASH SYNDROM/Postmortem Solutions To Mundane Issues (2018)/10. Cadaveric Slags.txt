Foul brain paste bubbles in oven
My fridge crowded
Cadaveric stumps and organs
In washing machine revolves the entrails
With purulent fumes kitchen inflate
Through the grate I grind kidneys
Liver, groin, stomach is for mincing
Slags at pan
This stuffing I'll cram into
The rectum and salt in urine
Garnish is the multiplied
And cooked worms
Relish is the cut out
And dried spots
Galantine from corpse
Blood to drink and pus for sauce
Grill crunch by toasted
On human fat lymphatic glands
I cook the putrid corpse
Stew and smoke, with onion and vomit
Pie with slags, human pates
Baked ovum, dead is the dwell of vermins
Mazut daub, cold and crooked
Tinned human nap, wait for my hook
