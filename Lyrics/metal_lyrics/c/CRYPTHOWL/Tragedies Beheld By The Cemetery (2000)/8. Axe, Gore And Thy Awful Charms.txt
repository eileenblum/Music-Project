Stains of gore
Ominous dark-red
Traceries
Coated the sullen walls
Eerie painting so sinister
Who's she to inspire me
Could they ever comprehend?

To please thy pride
To feed thy smile
Their souls will dash around the castle
In wedding dress
Immersed in pangs
She greets her death

Horror-struck
Watching her blood to splash
Shuddering
As the axe reflects the candlelight
Now it's time
To let her know the truth
Tear the bed-sheet off the bed
To reveal thy awful charms

To please thy pride
To feed thy smile
Her ghost will haunt our howling castle
In wedding dress
Immersed in pangs
She greets her death

Funeria, she won't be mine
Dost thou behold this blood to flow?

Beneath this all-absorbing Moon
The piercing shrieks of horror
Follow all the murders in my room

Funeria, I'm only thine
Thou art the only one for me

Below the cerement of night
Another maiden's slain. She's dead
For thou art sovereign of my heart

I'm sure thou shouldst be pleased at last
So greet my bloody tribute now
My axe will plunge and spill her blood
The sweetest ichor to delight thy eye
