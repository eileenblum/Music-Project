Despiteful, malignant
The light of moon is stealing
Into my cold gloomy ward
I feel her cold breath
She's near
She's coming back again...

Eyes of her concealed
An awfull mystery
Blinded by her sorcery
I have paid
No heed to their morbid gleam

Dazzling charms of her
So indescribable
Lit up the crepuscular
Scenery
The dew of her beauty
Threw the captive flame on me

Awake! Break the torpor!
Is what I really needed
To be done

I sacrificed my heart
For she that has been dead

Hand by hand we walked
The path in gloomy grove
I enjoyed the sight of rustling crowns
Of the trees
Their whisperings of warning
Were unheard by me

Longing for a kiss
Her hublean ruby lips
Touched mine and I felt the bliss
Deadly claws
Of her dreadful witchcraft
Dug into me

And our silhouettes combined
We faded into midnight mist

Tell me! Tell me now!
Goddess, delightful
Please tell me what art thou
Where didst thou comest from
To steal my heart and soul

Not a single word
Was uttered to feed my lust
Not a single word
Just a graceful splendour
To blind my eyes!

That night I dreamt of her
But visions were so dreadful
Instead of rest I throed
It came to me at last
The mouldy slabs I lay on
Were not the bed I fell asleep before

Wanton old woman
Lascivious to the core
Totally naked
Appeared in a doorway

Was it just a dream?
The old witch was drawing near
Was it just a dream?
The gleam in her gaunt hand
The carving knife!

I turned around my head
I thought it was my chamber
But only vaults I saw
I snatched the knife out of
Her hand when she approached
And cut her throat
As deeper as I could...

Eyes full of hatred
And consternation
Stared at me before the dying away
And then I saw an awful vision
The young beauty in blood

They caught hold of me
Justice is never to escape
But they'll never know that she
Is the first to overtake me

Murder of a bride
Imprisonment for life
Haunting me is nightmare of that night
She is still alive
Damp walls will never hide
Me from her lust
The evil predator
Is thirsting for my life
