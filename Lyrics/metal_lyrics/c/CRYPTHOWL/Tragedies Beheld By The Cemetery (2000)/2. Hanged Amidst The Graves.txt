As the fate decreed
I came across the edifice
So lonely and deserted
The mansion stood among the trees
A hundred years elapsed
The breath of life has left this place
But gloomy walls retained
The traces of joy and pain

Lurked in the dusk
Behind this house
Forsaken graves
All overgrown with weeds

As the first light of dawn
Pierced through sombre wood
And engilt the apices of toombstones
Marvellous portrayal
Of a girl arrested me
Goddess stared at me from marble slab

Never I have seen
Such a surpassing beauty
Her image was so vivid
It seemed to me she had revived
Days and nights I spent
In private with her lovely shape
Since I have seen her face
Depicted on a stone
Full of bewitching grace

I shall never learn the cause
Of what has cut her life so short
Right in the bloom of youth
The fresh flower was engored
Sprinkled with blood
Her beauty withered
To find its death and rest
And all the delights of life
Has been shrouded
In darkness right away
In darkness...

Life is worth to go on
No longer anymore
That is what I realized at once
Sublime old tree rose next to her grave
Here comes the cord
Soon I'll stay forever by her side

Left face to face
Amidst the graves
Forevermore
In unity as one in dusk we rest
