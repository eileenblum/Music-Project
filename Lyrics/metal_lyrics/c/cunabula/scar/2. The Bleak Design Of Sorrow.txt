Deadly roots are moving

Follow me down where the coffin floats
To the tower of brides
Red sun has set two years ago
Eternal funeral, the bed of cobwebs

Why does it always rain after dark
Deep in the woods he sleeps
Forgotten Messiah, the Trial of the Grasses
Disturb the bleak design of sorrow

Deadly roots are moving

Black water of life
You can leave me unconscious
The silent army of sleepwalkers
In the endless search for the arcane deception

Eyes are useless tonight
The last sacred meeting
All secrets are empty now
Light is just a dream

Can't stop, won't stop
No need to know
No reason for us
Abandoned
