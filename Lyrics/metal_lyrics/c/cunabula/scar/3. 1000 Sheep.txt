Through the storm we arrived
Hidden from night wolves and forsaken windows
Why have we waited for so long
In search for answer where every way is wrong

Rush is over now
Yellow moon between us
Silent birds won't say goodbye

Listen to the flies
A thousand sheep are dreaming
(I) see you by the well tonight

I left the ticket at the gate
The rain erases secrets of the river
Have a drink on me Mr. Mirrorface
The door will open only to deceiver
