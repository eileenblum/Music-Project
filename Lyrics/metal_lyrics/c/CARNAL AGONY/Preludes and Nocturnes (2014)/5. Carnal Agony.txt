[Music: Mathias Wallin/Carnal Agony, lyrics: Mathias Wallin]

You lie awake plagued by memories of pain
Pray to your god that we wonât find you again
Your fragile minds on the edge of despair
For what is coming you cannot prepare

We are the ghosts that you fear
We are the bringers of death

Nocturnal shadows in the darkness appear
The dawn of justice, your ending is near
You cry our name as you beg for your lives
Vengeance delivered by the blade of our knives

We are the ghosts that you fear
We are the bringers of death

[Solo: Mathias]

We are the ghosts that you fear
We are the bringers of death
