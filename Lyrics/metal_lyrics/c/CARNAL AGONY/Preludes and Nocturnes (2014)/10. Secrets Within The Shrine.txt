[Music: Mathias Wallin/Carnal Agony, lyrics: Mathias Wallin]

In ancient writings a tale was told
About the secrets within the shrine
It told of treasures and endless might
Behind the portal it still resides

Dead but dreaming the serpent waits
Hear its calling

[Solo: PO]

Eloquent whispers with wicked tongues
From stranger aeons where death may die
Spread through dominions of mortal souls
Their prideful natures enticed by lies

Dead but dreaming the serpent waits
Hear its calling

Rise up from the deep

[Solo: Mathias]

From north men travelled to seek the truth
About the secrets within the shrine
All hope abandoned they entered hell
Beneath the surface they all shall die

From its slumber the serpent wakes
Hear its crawling
