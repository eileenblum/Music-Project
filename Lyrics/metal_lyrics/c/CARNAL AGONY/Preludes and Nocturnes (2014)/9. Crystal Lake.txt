[Music: Robert Hedlund/Mathias Wallin/Carnal Agony, lyrics: Mathias Wallin]

Something moves within the night
That is not good and is not right
Unbridled rage and an urge to kill
A lethal force with your name on his bill

Damnation waits
At Crystal Lake
Heâll seal your fate
At Crystal Lake

For your lust youâll pay his fee
The time has come for you to be
Eviscerated, slashed and charred
A twisted sculpture in his abattoir

Damnation waits
At Crystal Lake
Heâll seal your fate
At Crystal Lake

[Solo: PO/Mathias]

Damnation waits
At Crystal Lake
Heâll seal your fate
At Crystal Lake
