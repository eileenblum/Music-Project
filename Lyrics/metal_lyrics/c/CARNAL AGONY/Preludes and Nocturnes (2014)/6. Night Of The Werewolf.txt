[Music: Mathias Wallin/Carnal Agony, lyrics: Mathias Wallin]

When darkness falls, can you hear the howling
The wolfs bane blooms, the autumn moon is calling my name

My DNA
Leading me astray
Tonight youâll be my prey

Full moon, bewitched by the light
Werewolves are hunting tonight
Try to remember these words as you die
Things will get better âcause dead girls donât cry

This lunar spell awakes unholy hunger
The scent of flesh enhanced by the blood in your veins

Such a sweet bouquet
A human filet
On my midnight buffet

Full moon, bewitched by the light
Werewolves are hunting tonight
Try to remember these words as you die
Things will get better âcause dead girls donât cry

A nocturnal feast
For this savage beast

[Solo: PO]

You scream out loud the second time this evening
In my own hell breeding is just foreplay to feed

Itâs a morbid fate
You came for a date
Now you are on my plate

Full moon, bewitched by the light
Werewolves are hunting tonight
Try to remember these words as you die
Things will get better âcause dead girls donât cry

Full moon, bewitched by the light
(Bless the day I first was bitten)
Werewolves are hunting tonight
(Now Iâll pass the gift to you)
Try to remember these words as you die
(Turn your madness into rapture)
Things will get better âcause dead girls donât cry
