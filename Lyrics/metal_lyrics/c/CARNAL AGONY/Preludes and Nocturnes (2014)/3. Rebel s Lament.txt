[Music: Mathias Wallin/Carnal Agony, lyrics: Mathias Wallin]

Once I was brighter than the sun amidst the stars
The envy of angels, the proudest of them all
Banished from your kingdom I have fallen from grace
In Tartarus fettered with adamantine chains

Shrouded in dark flames I plot for revenge
Embracing all evil, immortal is my hate
Sheltered from your vision my counsel convenes
Our fierce spirits fiercer with perpetual despair

I will walk through fire and regain my place
Overthrow your towers armed with fury from Hell
Open warâs my sentence; I shall end your days
I am roaring as I tear you apart

No reconcilement where wounds of hateâs pierced deep
Beleaguer the heavens, set fire to the light
Innocence once lost cannot ever be regained
Let the firmament crimson with warm celestial blood

I will walk through fire and regain my place
Overthrow your towers armed with fury from Hell
Open warâs my sentence; I shall end your days
I am roaring as I tear you apart

[Solo: Mathias]

I will walk through fire and regain my place
Overthrow your towers armed with fury from Hell
Open warâs my sentence; I shall end your days
I am roaring as I tear you apart
