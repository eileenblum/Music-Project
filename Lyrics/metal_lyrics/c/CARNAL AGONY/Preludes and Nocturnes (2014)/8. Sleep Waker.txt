[Music: Mathias Wallin/Carnal Agony, lyrics: Mathias Wallin]

His withering body lies dying before me
A deep sigh escapes as the ending draws near
No time to waste, I must start mesmerizing
Death, my dear friend, will be cheated once more

The stroke of my hand is the key
The fate of this man lies with me
The power of Gods you will see
His soul I will never set free

Eyes turning inward and limbs turning rigid
The ritual is working, the signs are all there
No turning back now I know Iâm forsaken
His breath ethereal as the sleep-waker speaks

âAsleep, yet awake, let me dieâ
The voice comes from somewhere inside
My stairway to heaven denied
Creation of God is defiled

âPut me to sleep
Or quick waken meâ
What have I done
Iâm in way to deep

[Solo: Mathias/Both]

âPut me to sleep
Or quick waken meâ
What have I done
Iâm in way to deep
Screaming in vain
His flesh melts away
All hope is lost
Like tears in the rain
