[Music: Mathias Wallin/Carnal Agony, lyrics: Mathias Wallin]

Thunder thy clarion and lightning thy sword
Guide our noble sons in their work
In hour of peril give them true aim
Bear them in your hand through the fight

Bless our arms; grant us victory, O Lord
And God, Father,
Protect our land and our flag

Total genocide
Through you justified

This is a prayer never told
(Kill âem all)
Let us cleanse this world by fire
Can you hear our call to arms?
(Heed the call)
Water their way with their tears

Cover their fields with their patriot dead
Torn to bloody shreds with our shells
Let foes be smitten, drive them insane
Make their widows cry out in grief

Orphan their children, lay waste to their homes
Make them roam their desolate land
Broken in spirit, worn in travail
Deny them refuge of the grave

Bless our arms; grant us victory, O Lord
And God, Father,
Protect our land and our flag

Total genocide
Through you justified

This is a prayer never told
(Kill âem all)
Let us cleanse this world by fire
Can you hear our call to arms?
(Heed the call)
Stain the white snow with their blood

Shrieks of the wounded writhing in pain
Blissful is the sound of their pleads
In honor and glory we maim and we rape
Our soldiers are the pride of our hearts

[Solo: Mathias/PO]

Bless our arms; grant us victory, O Lord
And God, Father,
Protect our land and our flag

Total genocide
Through you justified

This is a prayer never told
(Kill âem all)
Let us cleanse this world by fire
Can you hear our call to arms?
(Heed the call)
In the name of our God
