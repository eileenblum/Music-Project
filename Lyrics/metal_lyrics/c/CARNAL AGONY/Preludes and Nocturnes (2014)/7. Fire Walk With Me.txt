[Music: Mathias Wallin/Robert Hedlund/Carnal Agony, lyrics: Mathias Wallin]

Faster and faster sheâs tumbling through space
Numbed and oblivious but shortly sheâs ablaze
Trapped in a nightmare, a predatorâs prey
No angels to help her, theyâve all gone away

âThrough the darkness of future past
The magician longs to see
One chance out between two worlds
Fire walk with meâ

Once vibrant and playful she lies there undressed
Her body a vessel for a father whoâs possessed
The tears fuels his fire, since twelve she has cried
Oh how he wonders what she looks like inside

âThrough the darkness of future past
The magician longs to see
One chance out between two worlds
Fire walk with meâ

[Solo: Mathias/PO/Both/Mathias]

He entered her body but never her soul
Released by her death as his knife carves a hole
Wrapped into plastic thereâs no one to tell
That her window has served as a portal to hell

âThrough the darkness of future past
The magician longs to see
One chance out between two worlds
Fire walk with meâ

You may think Iâve gone insane
I promise I will kill again
Caught within my bag of death
Fire walk with me
