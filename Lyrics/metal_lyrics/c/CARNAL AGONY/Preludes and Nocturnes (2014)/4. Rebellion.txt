[Music: Mathias Wallin/Carnal Agony, lyrics: Mathias Wallin]

On this dusky winters night
We are gathered here to fight
End deceit and end all lies
As God's creation finally dies

Born as equals, dying free
Never bending supple knee
Liberty must be deserved
Though most through sloth had rather serve

Serving no Tyrant
Means âDo What Thou Wiltâ
Defenders of Freedom
Must kill without guilt

Brothers of the Damned
United here we stand
Raise your swords up high
Together we will die
In our rebellion

Sworn allegiance to no one
Now that you've enthroned your son
In black hearts deep malice grows
All hell breaks loose this final show

Shoulder to shoulder
There's no turning back
Soldiers of Satan
Prepare for attack

Brothers of the Damned
United here we stand
Raise your swords up high
Together we will die
In our rebellion

[Solo: Mathias]

Brothers of the Damned
United here we stand
Raise your swords up high
Together we will die
In our rebellion

Embrace your fate as death draws near
Without hope there is no fear
[Break your chains and follow me]
The price of freedom isn't free
