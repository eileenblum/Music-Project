[Music: Mathias Wallin/Carnal Agony, lyrics: Mathias Wallin]

Paladin of the silver hand
Proud defender of this hallowed land
Alliance force under my command
Iâm the Crown Prince of our kingdom

Troubling news comes from distant shores
Burning legion is alive once more
Set the sails and prepare for war
For the glory of our nation

A strange plague is spreading across the domain
The scourge of the undead is rising again

I will be king of honor, hope and glory
Bringer of justice to these sacred plains
I would gladly bear any curse to save my homeland
End reign of chaos with an aura of light

Steel meets steel on the battlefield
Hell-forged swords hammer at my shield
Iâd rather die than submit or yield
To the forces of destruction

Suddenly from beyond the graves
Dead awakes as infernal slaves
All infected must stand ablaze
In the flames of holy fire

Father, forgive me for what I must do
Would you do the same if you knew what I knew?

I will be king of honor, hope and glory
Bringer of justice to these sacred plains
I would gladly bear any curse to save my homeland
End reign of chaos with an aura of light

But now I see what I have done
To those I had to shelter
I feel their pain inside my mind
I need to flee the fire that burns
Within so unforgiving
I have to choose the evil side

I see virtue in madness
I am heir to the throne
I need to live forever
Father, die by my hand

[Solo: PO/Mathias]

Into fiery hell I ride

[Solo: PO]

Frostmourne finally by my side

[Solo: Mathias]

I am the king of fury, scorn and vengeance
Bringer of torture to these barren lands
A new order is rising from the empires ashes
Bow to the dark lord or face death where you stand
I am the king of fury, scorn and vengeance
Bringer of torture to these barren lands
It is better to reign in hell than serve in heaven
Now I have finally found my home on the frozen throne
