[Music &amp; Lyrics: M. Olsfelt]

Thrown yourself agains it all in total self-destruction
You look so weak against his might - So small in the light
But you are stronger!
Your darkness standing proud and
True - devotion, dedication, concentration of the soul
Through cleasning... Light beyond knowledge

The end flows through your veins
High on blind destruction
The flowers of red are growing wild
And the mirror of my blood on the floor reflects
Your face - Not mine

Possess me! - Beautiful evil soul
I burn in your flame - Your beauty is my pain
Caress me! - Beautiful evil love
With your sweet kiss ofdeath
You crucify my world

Take me! - Burn my soul
For you - I give all my life
Destroy me!

Dark
Final
Lovely
Touch

And I can see her now
She is rising
Smilign
Death is beautiful

[Lead: M. Sunesson]
Shining

She is beautiful
Spreading her black wings
She is suicide
And the mirror of my blood on the floor reflects
Her eyes - My death

Obsess me! - Beautiful evil soul
I burn in your flame - Your beauty is my pain
Undress me! - Beautiful evil love
With your sweet kiss of death
You crucify my world
You crucify my love - Beautiful evil world
Like a dream of perfect bliss - Too beautiful to last
