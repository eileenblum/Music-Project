[Music: M. Tervonen. Lyrics: M. Olsfelt/M. Tervonen]

See my light it has gone away - My fire is dead but here I stay
Time is passing by though nothing heals its breath does tear my life
Endless pain throught my loveless heart
I feel my soul grow deadly cold
Still I breathe and and  still I stay - Still I "live" day after day

Sorrow surounds me day and night
So tired of life but scared to die
Visions passing through my head - Words you once in silence said
Beyond the point of no return - I can't go back the bridge is burned
Still I breathe and still I stay - Still I "live" day after day

The shadows are breathing - Can't you hear?
The darkness feeding off your fear
Endless pain through my loveless heart
But still I breathe...
The shadows are bleeding - Can't you see?
My darkiness feeding off these years
Still I breathe and still I stay
Still I die day after day

Lights of darkness lead the way
Towards the breathing, awaiting end
Always there to erase it all - Always there to take us home

We are all just born to die - But never living we just survive
All will die no eternal life - But still you try...
To hide the truth in comfort lies
The christian dream has made you blind
My eyes can see - I don't believe
But still you pray day after day

My youth has passed away
Time is passing by though nothing heals its breath does tear my life

Will it ever pass away?
Life is passing by and there's nothing left for me but
Eternal Death

[Lead: M. Tervonen]

Why do I still go on? - Living this lie
I die because I do not - Die!
Broken beyond repair - Alone across the years

[Repeat chorus]

Will it ever pass away?
Life is passing by and there's nothing left for me but
Eternal Death!
