[Music: M. Sunesson. Lyrics: J. Lindstrand/M. Sunesson/M. Olsfelt]

The spiritual rape
Jehova's mind pollution
But nocturnal possession it breathes in me
It's true love
It feels like I'm alive
I search for joy
There shall never be another dawn
I have become the beast - The freedom of your soul
This God of "light" - I will crush in the night

Devastation
My charm strikes upon you
Fulfill your fate - Go against your God
The night is here
It's breathing deep in you
Feel the rush!
You're in demon hands
Cleansed from the filth
A slave to the power of blood and death
Fight for pleasure and victory will come

Yeah - The "light" has raped your soul
Retribution through my world within
The militia of death
It starts to rise - Ready to explode
Kill "yourself" and come with me
I've got the cure
The power to eras your God
- Erase your God!

I have sterilized the cross
The violation of "his" dream
And I have darkified the souls of purity
This mercyful death - The neverending harmony
Your eyes glow so red
And slowly you accept what you have become
The hunger of evil - The instinct of our glory
this society of Christ brings out the Devil in us

[Lead: M. Sunesson]

Now you've ripped the angels above
Created your own world within
Spark of death
It starts to rise - Ready to explode
You killed "yourself" - You came with me
together we shall burn what's left of...
nothingness
NOTHINGNESS.
