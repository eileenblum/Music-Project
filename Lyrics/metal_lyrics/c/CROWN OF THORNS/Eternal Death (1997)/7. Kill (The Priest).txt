[Music: M. Olsfelt/R. ï¿½sterberg. Lyrics: M. Olsfelt]

Ohh - It's Metal in the air
It flows through our hearts
And gives us strength
It's time to show christianity
That DEATH is reality!

That everything must die!

Ohh - Kill the priest
Kill the priest - Yeah!

[Lead: M. Sunesson]

Metal strikes - All mercy dies
Kill the priest and burn the church
The total destruction of your god
Crucify and rip him down!

Rip him from the cross!

Ohh - Kill the priest
Kill the priest - Yeah!

[1991]
