[Music: M. Tervonen. Lyrics: M. Olsfelt]

[Lead: M. Sunesson]

Oh I remember - Cold white heaven
Sacred holy silence
- "Fear God and His commandments"

We walked the silver grass - Alone among thousands
We walked through eachother 
- "Don't cry when I walk in you"

Never! - I shall not kneel before your throne
You leper lord you
Liar - You cannot feel this pain I am
This will to break on
Through you - The rebel soul
It shall not rest until your chains are
Broken - Begone from me!
Your love was never nothing but a lie

Fallen from the sky - Alone cast into shadows

Father - You burned my wings
But I'm born again now baptised in
Fire - To take revenge
Released from your hands I am growing
Stronger - You watched me fall
Now watch me rise with pride and
Desire - To kill my god
Your love was never nothing but a lie

And the angels cry - Tears fall like rain
Knowing they must die - No god to hear their pain

As the heavens open above me - I feel its cold
My arms are spread wide open - Like wings in flight
I speak into the night - Words of poison and spell
My hate is driven across the sky - A blackened lightning that strikes up high

[Lead: M. Tervonen]

Father - You burned my wings
But I'm born again now baptised in
Fire - To take revenge
Released from your hands I am growing
Stronger - You watched me fall
Now watch me rise with pride and
Desire - To kill my god
Your love was never nothing but a lie
Angels die!
