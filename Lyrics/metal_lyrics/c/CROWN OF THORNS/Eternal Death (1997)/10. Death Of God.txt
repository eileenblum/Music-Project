[Music &amp; Lyrics: M. Olsfelt]

And down comes the rain...

God is dead - The sky cries tears of blood
Whipping down hard - The proof of his demise

This is the end - This is the Death of God
The Death divine - The destruction of your light
Forever...

Our eyes are open to the dark
And all the beauty therein
Deliver us from Jesus
- Drowning you in guilt and sin

Crush the cross
Forget those empty prayers
Find your own truth - Behind the blinding lights
And beyond...

Cursed be thy name - Your kingdom of slaves
Blessed be those who rise up - Against God
The fallen angels - The burning souls
The spirits of fire and revolution
Rising up from below
With the pain that we are

Make all gods die - Death of God
Songs of Death shall kill the lies forever
Glorify - Death of God
Creation of destruction - Death of God
Day of tomorrow no lord shall survive
Breaking through the chains - Death of God
Be done!
Celebrate the fall - Death of God
Look deep inside - You will find - Death of God
Is now, is here, in you - Death of God
Come forth
Celebrate your soul - The Death of God

We are the children of wrath - Born from pain
Living in the shadows - Thrown by your light
We are the end - The bright short burning flames
The end of eternity - The destruction of false hope
Forever... - We are the Death of God
The thorns of truth that crown your forsaken son
To the sound of our young hearts
Beating so brave and proud
So we live in the end
Screaming out our souls against
The sky

WAR!

War - Rise
Bring - Death
Come - Revolution

[Lead: M. Sunesson]

Rising - My soul from below
Under a flag of blood and night
Crashing - Against the pearly gates
Screaming as I burn

I am the end - I am the Death of God
The Death divine - The destruction of your lies
Forever...

Passion to destroy - These bloodwritten lies
Your heaven is my hell - Don't want your mind-raped rest

The celebration of God's Death
The Glorification of our soul
Roaming free and unbound
Never to serve or kneel

Make all gods die - Death of God
Songs of Death shall kill the lies forever
Glorify - Death of God
Creation of destruction - Death of God
Day of tomorrow no lord shall survive
Breaking through the chains - Death of God
Be done!
Celebrate the fall - Death of God
Look deep inside - You will find - Death of God
Is now, is here, in you - Death of God
Come forth
Celebrate your soul - The Death of God

You are turning your face away
Look at me and face my hatred!
Can You see it now?
I am your enemy!

The cursed fruit of "Thy" womb
The vengeance of "your" creation
And You will never hurt me again
You will never fucking hurt me again!
You are empty
Dead.
