[Music: M. Tervonen. Lyrics: M. Olsfelt/M. Tervonen]

A starving restless soul - As fueled by years of wasted time
Dying to live like a burning flame - So come beloved
Hunger!

So desperate and filled with pain
In chaos nights I tried to die - Feeding my disease
A deadly need
When this hunger is pleased then I shall die
Living like this is the end - I want to feel it all

Shatter my world of glass - And cut open its prison walls
All logic now left behind - So come and take me away

Starvated soul - A hidden pain consumes my heart
As fueled by years of wasted time
Hiding my soul away
So touch me with your careful lips - And open the doors to insanity
A yearning growing wild and strong - The need to lose all control

Shatter my world of glass - And cut open its prison walls
All logic now left behind - So come and take me away

Now - The time has come to slay my fears
Of what I hold behind those tears
Don't know - Don't care what I will find
Behind these eyes the future lies / Nothing ever seems to satisfy

The feeling of loss is so great that the very life in me has drained
and starved to Death
I long for something else and I am prepared to take the steps
that will cost me more than you
To leave everything behind, burn down my past and rise above
everybody that I once have been
To join the hunger inside - Please be my guide on this
long and strange journey through my life

Shatter my world of glass - And cut open its prison walls
All logic now left behind - So come and take me away

Now - The time has come to slay my fears
Of what I hold behind those tears
Don't know - Don't care what I will find
Behind these eyes the future lies / Nothing ever seems to satisfy

[Lead: M. Sunesson]

[Repeat chorus]

I drift on... - Consumite Furore!
