[Music and Lyrics by: M.Tervonen]

My destiny
have been schosen by an
Absurd religion
They call themselves
a sect of light
With their own reality
they think they are above
humanity
With fear they turn their back on us

With re-creation
they try to fill our heads with lies
Claiming that the son of god will rise
With their dream of glory skies
I say their dream will forever die

No Guf is empty
No more souls
The first-born child
will die alone
The seven signs
you will see
only if you truly believe
First the Sea will show you Death
and then the Blood-red moon
will show that your journey is coming soon

With re-creation
they try to fill our heads with lies
Claiming that the son of god will rise
With their dream of glory skies
I say their dream will forever die

It's just a lie!

Let them know
that their glory sky
will forever die

Their dream will forever die!
