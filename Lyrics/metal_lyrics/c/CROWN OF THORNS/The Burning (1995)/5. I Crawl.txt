[Music &amp; Lyrics by M.Tervonen]

To feel the emptiness
I see only punishment
You caused me dark dreams
You brought me evil dreams
My anger for your promises is just growing
I feel your rage...

Anger I feel is growing in my mind
Deception, insanity
It should just die
Darkness has touched me
I feel your holy presence
My dark half loves you
I die - but I enjoy

I crawl into your arms
I crawl into your world
I crawl, I crawl
I crawl into your destiny
I crawl into your arms
I crawl into your world
I crawl, I crawl
I crawl into your destiny

Feel me - my blood is freezing
Touch me - I rule your feelings
Love me - I'll give you fantasy
Hate me - I am inside your dreams

I crawl into your arms
I crawl into your world
I crawl, I crawl
I crawl into your destiny

I crawl into your arms
I crawl into your world
I crawl, I crawl
I crawl into your destiny

Eternity we will now conquest
Deceiver!
We have become one
