[Music and Lyrics by: M.Tervonen]

Through the landscape of the forbidden
my astral body flies
I see the real sun falling apart
due to my fall from the skies
Misscreation, devestation
rules the land where I am God
As I am the wind and you are the sand
you'll do anything that I command

Midian- Soon we walk the earth without fear
Follow me out when the sun has died
and enjoy the gifts that were to us denied

Through the landscape of the forbidden
my astral body flies
The sun has died no need to hide
from the deadly light that weakened our might
Now we walk the earth that once belonged to us
with pride

Midian- Soon we walk the earth without fear
Follow me out when the sun has died
and enjoy the gifts that were to us denied

No-one can stop us from inherit the earth
It is ours, it used to be and will belong to us again
You had no right to take it
We will rule the world with our new master-race

Midian- Soon we walk the earth without fear
Midian- Now we walk the earth without fear
Follow me out when the sun has died
and enjoy the gifts that were to us denied
