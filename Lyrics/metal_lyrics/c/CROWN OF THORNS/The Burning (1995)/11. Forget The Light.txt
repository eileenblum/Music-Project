Forget the light
everything has to die
All life is pain
and all life must end

There is no turning back
You cannot stop me now
Death by my own hands
I'm not afraid anymore

My life- my sweetest sacrifice
tyrned loose- by the flaming cold knife
My eyes- my black hole inside
Unleashed- in a shining suicide

No light, No hope, No fear
No meaning, No answer
No life, No love, No tears
No feelings- No fire
No god, No soul, No heaven
No father- No holy son
No light no need for fear
No future- No regret

I spit upon my life- your holy gift to me
I spit upon your throne- your heaven dead to be

Suicidal glory!
Blapshemy- I deny his life in me
Desecration- destroying god's creation

Cutting up this body of mine
Created in the image of god
Burn His face by burning mine
I'm the destruction of all holy lies
I shred your precious angels
Rip the feathers of wings of white
I drink their heavenly blood
and suffer all their pain!

I am here draped in blood
all angels dead and white
All alone I can't stop the flood
Lost- dressed in night
Of darkness if my spine
let the colours wither
Let it all die!

I am through!

Darker than Death
this suicide is filled with hate
Colder than life
I can feel the knife deep inside

There is no turning back
You cannot stop me now
Death by my own hands
I'm not afraid anymore

Everything is so cold
Emptiness!
Embrace me as I fall

No light, No hope, No fear
No meaning, No answer
No life, No love, No tears
No feelings- No fire
No god, No soul, No heaven
No father- No holy son
No light no need for fear
No future- No regret
No regret
No return!
