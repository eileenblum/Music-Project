[Music &amp; Lyrics by: M.Tervonen]

Join me
through a path of life
when a dream becomes reality
Your dark dreams / Your agony
are far beyond your sanity
The cold wind / dries my blood
The blood that I gave for an eternal life
Defeated by the memories
that haunted my sadistic mind

Follow me into my darkest desires
and follow me into my grave
Follow me to my holiest phantasm
that shows that I'm insane

I depict you / my idol
for a place in your kingdom
Your holy words I adorate
when you destroy what I create
Darkness will fall on you
at the day, the day you die
Now you leave this mortal life
to your stupid desired lie

Follow me into my darkest desires
and follow me into my grave
Follow me to my holiest phantasm
that shows that I'm insane

They showed me all the lusts that I so desired
if their god was the only god I admired

I am godless...

At the holy altar
my life fades away
Now I realize
I'm just one
without god

Without god...
