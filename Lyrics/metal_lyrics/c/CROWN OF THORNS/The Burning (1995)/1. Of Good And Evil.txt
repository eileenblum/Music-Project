[Music &amp; Lyrics by: M.Tervonen]

Not this dream again!
Would it never end?
It always ends with
me laughing at your misery
Can't you see that I
want to reach my hand
to bring you back to me
so we can change your destiny

You are falling down
I cry in vain
I see your sad eyes disappear
and that fills me with pain
"I" laugh while I see you fall
Now "I" have completed my call

I'm standing here alone to face my "crimes"
In my dreams I leave these cold walls
so you can't see
while a piece of me slowley dies

With you I share my electric crown
so I never have to see you
when you're falling down
Your dead eyes are shining so bright
Can you feel the peace
"I" promised you in the light?

I'm standing here alone to face my "crimes"
In my dreams I leave these cold walls
so you can't see
while a piece of me slowley dies

I see you falling down once again
and "I'm" laughing

I'm standing here alone to face my "crimes"
In my dreams I leave these cold walls
so you can't see
while a piece of me slowley dies

While a piece of me slowley dies.
