[Music &amp; Lyrics by:M.Olsfelt]

No way back
I've gone to far
He is on his way
Give up my hope
No resist
His whispers are so close

Shut my eyes and forget the light inside
Dark desires and wishes of demon-might

Unite with my shadow, the reflections in the mirror

Swept away by waves of darkness
Roaring hate - Deep and black

Dancing steel on fat blue veins
Flow! my firetears, Flow! my crimson blood
I am open now
Enter me!

For I shall kill the Shepherd and scatter all his sheep
Your gods have none to pray to, when evil is unleashed
I am the heart of darkness, the end of everything
To me was given life to end all life
Demon-might - Walk the earth!

The priest
spatter my face with holy water
Hurts me, and mocks me with his words
Fear me!
Fear my name, my burning rage
So filled with sin
Reap my harvest in blood
Caressed by Death
Prayers of doom and burning souls

The burning
The scorching of your words
to ashes
your love must be burnt!

No more knocking on Death's door
I will open it myself
Cleansed by blood of Lamb
Sweeping through
As it opens wide

Shut my eyes and forget the light inside
Dark desires and wishes of demon-might

I thought the pain would stop!

For I have killed the Shepherd
and scattered all his sheep
Your gods have none to pray to,
for evil is unleashed
I'm the heart of darkness,
the end of everything
And I am hurting till the end of time -
Soulicide Demon-might
