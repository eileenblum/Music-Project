Ready for the casket ride? Death-bound joyride
One way freedom-run, sorry-go-round!

Soulless man - dead and gone
Lying in his grave trip of death, endless night
Rotting under ground to cross the river of death
Spare a dime for the ferryman
Prepare thouself... For the casket ride!

Ok, this is your captain speaking..
Fasten your seatbelts..
And get ready for the
Ride of your life!!!
Casket ride!
Casket ride!
Casket ride!
