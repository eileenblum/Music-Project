I've been watching you inside your house
When you're asleep, when you're awake
I've been stalking y ou for two weeks now
And soon I'm gonna make my move

Knife keeps plunging
Right thru your fuckin' ribs
Twist the blade up
Grab you by the hips
Throw you to the floor
Cut you up real sweet
Leave you lying there
Dying for your sins
Eye for an eye
Butchered in full daylight
Die by the knife
Mora-lized from head to toe
Your body is turning cold,
As blood runs to the ground
Killer's frenzy, captured in your eyes

It could be you motherfucker tonight
Knife keeps plunging
Right thru your fuckin' ribs
Killer's frenzy, captured in your eyes
