All around me faces of death
As I put the noose around my neck
No-one here gets out alive
So bow down your head and pray to die!
Pray to die!
Can you stare the deceased in the eyes?
Or kiss the lips of a dying bride?
Would you hold a dead man's hand?
As he leads you through the shadowed land!

Brain Storm! Death Blow! Blood Flood!
Faces of Death! Faces of Death!
Faces of Death!
