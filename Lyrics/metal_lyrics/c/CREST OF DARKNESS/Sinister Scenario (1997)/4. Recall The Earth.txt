Recall the earth
Let yourself be free
Recall
Recall the earth
Let your dreams become reality

Entering places where no limits exists
Human mind control - you can't resist
you've got power - it's all there
Your own will can bring you everywhere

(It's) Your life!
Your choice!
Your life!
Your choice!

Let your dreams become reality

Natural instincts hidden deep inside
Self-preservation - live or let die!
Great inventions - killer machines!
The cause of death is living inour dreams

You're strong!
You're (your own) god!
You're strong!
You're god!
