You don't know what you're facing.
You don't know what to belive.

From deep inside.
From out of nowhere.
It occupies your mind.
It's like a possession.
Youre trying to say stop.
You know you can't give up.
you're trying to find
another direction.

I'm the voice in your head.
I'm the voice and you're my slave.

I'm the voice in your head.
I'm the voice and you're my slave.

You thought you'd lost your sense of reality.
You thought you was the only one.

You know it's too late.
You know you can't escape.
You're out of control.
You can't avoid the future.
You're trying to wake up
but this is not a dream.
Your cry of distress
is absoluyely helpless.

I'm the voice in your head.
I'm the voice and you're my slave.
and you're my slave.
