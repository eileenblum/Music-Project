Deep in the woods. 
In a dark and mystrious world. 
There I saw her. 
and I felt her attraction. 

No one could stop me 
from meeting her there. 
No one could tell me 
what else I should have done. 
Bewitched by the moonlight 
and her beauty. 
I was entering the twilight zone. 

Far away. 
like in a delirious dream. 
By the small black lake. 
there I saw her. 
and I felt her attraction. 

I was getting 
closer to her. 
I tried to touch her 
and kiss her lips. 
My strong desire 
was the only thing I could feel. 

At first I was crying 
when I saw her rotting corpse. 
I couldn't take 
my eyes away from her. 
Then she smlied 
and I could still see her beauty. 

I gave her what she needed. 
She was drinking my blood. 
I gave her everything. 
I lost my former life. 
Together we're gonna live forever! 

I'm living in the twilight zone! 

Bewitched by the moonlight 
and her beauty. 
I'm living inthe twilight zone!
