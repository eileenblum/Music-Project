Slaughtering one another
Getting their deserverd death
Driven by their blind belief
Killing in the name of God

Watch their fall!

In desperate they are dying.
Searching for ethernal life
Self-destructive mertyrs
Satisfyng their"holy God"

Watch their fall!

Countless ages passign by
Thay're still preaching stupid lies
Telling us that we're all sinners
while they're killing in the name of God!

Show no mercey!
They're gonna die!
Show ne mercey!
No one's ever gonna save their souls

Slaughtering one another
Getting their deserved death
Driven by their blind belief
Killing in the name of God
