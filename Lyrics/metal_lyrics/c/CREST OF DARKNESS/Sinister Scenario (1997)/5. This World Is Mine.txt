Asking questions.
Would like to understand.
Nowhereland.
The land of dreams?
Strong visions.
Like cinematic pictures.
Like a wind.
They're blowing away.

This world is mine!
Controlled by my mind!

Going deeper.
Clear in my mind.
Concentration.
Find the direction.
All with passion.
releasing energy.
My request!
The law is my will!

This world is mine!
Controlled by my mind!

Like a muscle waiting for the brains command!
Like a virus programmed to kill!
Like a soldier executing orders!
Like a loaded gun in the hands of a cold-blooded killer!
