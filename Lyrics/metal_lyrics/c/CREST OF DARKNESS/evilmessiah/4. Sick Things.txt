[originally by Alice Cooper]Sick things in cars rotate
'round my stars
Sick things
My things
My pets
My things

I love you things
I see as much as you
Love me
You things are heavenly
When you come worship me
You things are chilled with fright
For I am out tonight
You feel me with delight
You whet my appetite

I eat my things
What love it brings
Come here
My things
Don't fear
My little things

I love you things
I see as much as you
Love me
You things are heavenly
When you come worship me
You things are thrilled with fright
For I am out tonight
You things are paradise
You whet my appetite

Sick things in cartridge tapes
My stars
Sick things
Pretty things
Play things
My things

I love you things
I see as much as you
Love me
You things are heavenly
When you come worship me
You things are chilled with fright
For I am out tonight
You things are paradise
You whet my appetite
