Neither dead nor alive
Dreadful sounds all around
Breathing like a wild beast
Crawling like a worm

The dream of my life
is slowly fading away

Of the blackest kind
- A nightmare?
Of the blackest kind
- It's more than a dream

You are trying to speak
but you have forgotten the words

I can hear my
own voice calling...me
I don't understand the meaning...of my language

Of the blackes kind
- A life in pain?
Of the blackest kind
- I'm dying for you

I've learned to expect the unexpected

Memories from the past
Forever burning the flames
Terrible ecstasy
Sweet and evil beyond words

It's the end of the waiting
I've got no humanity left

You are a part of me
and together we are
sharing the same destiny
Together
Forever

Of the blackest kind
Together
Of the blackest kind
Forever

Sweet scent of death
A new beginning

From the outside
I can see...me
I am entering
the gate

Neither dead nor alive
Dreadful sounds all around
Breathing like a wild beast
Crawling like a worm

The dream of my life
It's so far away
The dream of my life
I don't know what's waiting for me
