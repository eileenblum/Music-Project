Existence
detached from your world
Desirous wishes
of love and pain

Inhuman

Darkness
Vague dreams
Sweet sorrow
Unspeakable aliveness

In your blood
In your veins
Mighty alien race

Without eyes
watching the emptiness
It's getting closer
to you

Invulnerable

You've heard
the fluttering wings
Revelations in black
Your gift of grace

In your blood
In your veins
Mighty alien race
In your blood
In your veins
Mighty alien race

As predicted
The forever indomitable
Infamous being

Revelations in black
You gift of grace
