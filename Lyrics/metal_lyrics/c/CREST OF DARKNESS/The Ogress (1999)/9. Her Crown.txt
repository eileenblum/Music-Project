She can't
wake up from her
deep unconscious sleep
Embraced
by her own dreams
Her will
turned her into
her own creation

Deep in your heart
Deep in your soul

Call upon her name
Her name
Like a growing flame
Her name

Arise

Call upon her name
Her name
Like a growing flame
Her name

Her grave
- A throne from where
she's touching the stars
So far
away from what
she's left behind
So close
to her own heart
In solitude she's wandering
In pain
she's found the source,
and her might is growing stronger

Deep in your heart
Deep in your soul

Call upon her name
Her name
Like a growing flame
Her name

Arise

Call upon her name
Her name
Like a growing flame
Her name

Her crown
- It's her conquest
of something deeper than love
Her crown
- It's an omen
once given life
The night
- It's her domain
beyond earthly ecstasy
Her night
- A world without end

She can't
wake up from her
deep unconscious sleep
Embraced
by her own dreams
Her will
turned her into
her own creation

Call upon her name
Her name
Like a growing flame
Her name
