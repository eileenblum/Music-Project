Rebuild
my soul again
Rebuild
the sense of pain
Rebuild
my fantasy
Rebuild
the beats in me

Wake me from the longest sleep
Scream before I fall too deep
Demons of the dealers hand
Light ,y way to neverland

Wisdom is a given gift
Life is like a night-time shift
Learn to love and learn to hate
This is just a different state

Gods
Words
Screens
amd scenes
I've seen it all before

Rebuild
my soul again
Rebuild
the sense of pain
Rebuild
my fantasy
Rebuild
the beats in me

Fill my soul, then let me die
No-one knows that I am I
Shattered dreams incorporate
Death is yet another state

Gods
Waords
Screens
and scenes
I've seen it all before

I am all and I am one
Universe and unicorn
Born to breed and born to sin
Gods beyond and gods above
Feed my hate and grow my love
Timeless in a flawless flood
Learning I am also God
