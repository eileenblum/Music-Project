Watching your life
All through the eyes
of the unconscionable
Watching your life
Getting the knowledge
The inheritance

Ancient rites
Still alive
Bring forth my will!

You've got the seed
You know the Unborn
The magic is yours
You've got the seed
You know who you are
The future is yours

Ancient wisdom
Never forgotten
Bring forth my will!

From the deepest night
Hordes from hell
Among sheeps always wondering
Entering a new era
Crushing the old lies

Ancient Gods
Rulers of the earth
Bring forth my will!

Watching myself
All through the eyes
of the unconscionable
Watching myself
Getting the knowledge
The inheritance
