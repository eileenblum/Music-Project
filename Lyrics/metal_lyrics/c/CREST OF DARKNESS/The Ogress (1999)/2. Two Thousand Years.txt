Two thousand years
Living on a lie
Two thousand years
In agony they're gonna die!

The preachers of freedom
The children of god
Living like slaves
Hiding their weakness
Behind their savior
The preachers of love
Bloodstained they are
Killing their enemies
in the name of god

Die! Die!

Believing they know
the only truth
they're spreading
the same old lies

Two thousand years
Living on a lie
Two thousand years
In agony they're gonna die!

Jesus Christ
You are a failure!
Torture and pain
have followed in your name
Jesus Christ
You are not needed
any more!

Die! Die!

Two thousand years
Living on a lie
Two thousand years
In agony they're gonna die!
