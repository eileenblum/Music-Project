This is the cup of my blood
This is the cup of eternal life
Rise your hate against God,
and follow the way!
Blessed are the sinners to me
Kingdoms are falling, but we do suceed!
Open your eyes and see
- The world of darkness is meant to be!

Drink the blood!
The blood is life!
Drin the blood and listen to
the jaws of the wolf!

Drink the blood!

I'll make your life complete
I'm placing my lips against your neck
You're feeling the touch og cold meat
Cold meat!
I'll take your fear away
I'll always be your devoted friend
You know it's the end of the day
You know you've seen your last sunrise

Drink the blood!
The blood is life!
Drin the blood and listen to
the jaws of the wolf!

Drink the blood!

What do you ahave inside?
Open your heart and feel the lust
There's no reason to hide
You are invincible!
Where have you always been?
I know the answer
- We both know the truth
Life is just as a dream
on the way to the Kingdom of Death!

Drink the blood!
The blood is life!
Drin the blood and listen to
the jaws of the wolf!

Drink the blood!
