I'm so lonely
Beautifull Medusa
I'm so sad
A whisper from the night
Come to me
Listen to the sirens song
Love me
Sweet words from a killer

She's an angel!

She's an angel
Don't you wanna fly away with her
She's an angel of death

Bring me happines
Mammon is al she needs
Bring me prosperity
She never gets enough
I'm waiting for you

She's an angel!

She's an angel
Don't you wanna fly away with her
She's an angel of death

Indiana Rose
Invincible you are
Belle
Your name will be remembered

I need someone
I need a man
Share your life with me
She'll cut him in pieces
Come to me
Listen to the sirens song
Love me
She's a deadly lover

I'm so lonely
Come to me
She's an angel of death
