Endless journey in the night.
Floating on a sea of Darkness.

Graveyard smell.
Visions of death.
Voices unspeakable talks to me.

Silence, darkness fill my mind.
All my fear is left behind.
Tanke my hand and I will folow.
Peacefullness. I can't fell sorrow.

Watching the stars.
Leaving the ground.
Great adventures waiting for me.

Endless journey in the night.
Floating on a sea of darkness.

Silence, darkness fill my mind.
All my fear is left behind.
Tanke my hand and I will folow.
Peacefullness. I can't fell sorrow.
