You're like a white shape, slowly moving
So cold
You're dead, I know, I haven't lost my mind
So cold

I'm still in love with you, I can feel you
Trembling
I will never forget, I know you are here
Trembling

Listen to my song, my anthem to you
Crying
You will understand, it's not too late
Crying

I love your pallid skin

Soon we'll stay together, as twins
Forever
Nothing can separate us, nothing
Forever

I love your pallid skin

It was always meant to be like this
Listen to the swansong
I'm ready, I'm fulfilling our destiny
Listen to the swansong

I love your pallid skin
You're like a white shape, slowly moving
So cold
You're dead, I know, i haven't lost my mind
So cold

I haven't lost my mind
