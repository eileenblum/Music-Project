Slaughter
Damnation
Forces beyond control
Bloody and merciless
An endless fight

Crying
Praying
"Where is God?" they ask
A people without pity
In a world full of fear

We have crossed the gates of Hell
We are the Gods of the new aeon
We have opened the nine locks of the abyss
The abyss is opened beneath us

Panic
Desperation
Unspeakable acts
Bloody and merciless
An endless battle
