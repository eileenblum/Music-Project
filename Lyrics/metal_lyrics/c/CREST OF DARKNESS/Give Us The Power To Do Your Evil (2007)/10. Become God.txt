Harmony, so hard to find
The fight just goes on
Morality, forget what you've learned
The preachers they are wrong

So many rules, made by whom?
The Holy God?
So many dreams seducing your senses
They make you weak

Wake up, look around
Satan's here, it's all his ground
Jesus Christ, we spit on you
And we're turning your cross upside down

Freedom, it's such a gift
Freedom, the only way
Feel the magic

You are a god, the world is yours
