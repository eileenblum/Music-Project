Bring me life
Rest in the blackness of my mind

She came to me in the night
She came to me in what
I first thought was a dream
She came to me, a rotting corpse

She's like a living dead
Licking my lips

My body is covered with worms
My mouth is full of insects
I can't breathe
She - Druj Nasu - my demon lover

She's like a living dead
Spreading her legs

Bring me life
Rest in the blackness of my mind

In my ears, the sound of a thousand flies
Hurt me, use me, make love with me
Orgasm, so close, orgasm, so close
I've found the temple of pleasure and pain
I have found
A new understanding, a new world
A new creation, antichrist

Let me become a part
Let me become a part of your
Dark universe
Lead me to the luciferian light

She's like a living dead
Drinking my blood

Bring me life
Rest in the blackness of my mind

Bring me life
Rest in the blackness of my mind

Bring me life
Rest in the blackness of my mind
