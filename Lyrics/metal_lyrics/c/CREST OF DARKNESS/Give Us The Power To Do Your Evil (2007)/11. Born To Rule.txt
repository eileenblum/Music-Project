Deep inside, like a seed
Deep inside, slowly growing

it has always been there
This great desire

Deep inside, a fire burning strong
Deep inside, true wisdom

It has always been there
The will to survive

We have crossed the gates of Hell
We are the Gods of the new aeon
We have opened the nine locks of the abyss
The abyss is opened within us

You are given
The power to command
The world is yours

Hail Satan
