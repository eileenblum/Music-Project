Tell me who you are, and I will let you live
Tell me who you are, if this is your last will

Deep inside of you, controlling all your life
Pictures from the past, pain, a bloody knife

Six feet under, victims they are all
Slowly rotting, you can hear their call

In despair, evil of fear

You are going down with your demons
You are going down with me

Tell me who you are, and I will let you live
Tell me who you are, if this is your last will

They have failed, they must be punished
They have failed, they are nothing worth at all

You have seen them, weak and disgusting
You have seen them, sinners they are all

In the name of the God almighty
in the name of all what's true
You have to give them what they deserve

Supreme pleasure, now they are dead
Take these human lives, the voice, that's what it said

The power of your will, fighting against theirs
A never ending nightmare, you have no more tears

In despair, scared to death

You are going down with your demons
You are going down with me
