We are the undead, we are the damned
Sick and infected we walk the Earth
Human beings, flesh and blood
Sweet touch, a kiss, razor blade teeth

You, my obsession, I need you

Death and pleasure beyond the grave
Death and pleasure, I love you my slave
Death and pleasure in eternity
Death and pleasure, it's only you and me

We're walking in the shadows, we are the alien race
Sick and infected we're hated by all
We borrow our bodies from the Earth
Like parasites we are feeding on you

You, my obsession, give your soul to me

Death and pleasure beyond the grave
Death and pleasure, I love you my slave
Death and pleasure in eternity
Death and pleasure, it's only you and me
