I feel your life flowing through me
By my will alone I am taking the first stem

I am taking the first step

Let me become a living demon
Feasting in the pleasures of the flesh
Let me become a living demon
Following my own desires

I have touched the great flames of existence
I have reached the point of no return

I have reached the point of no return

The future is mine
I am nothing, I am everything
Eternal darkness, it is all I can see

I have seen the child
And it is growing stronger

I have the power, I have the will
In my heart lies the key
I am ready to enter a new dimension

I am ready to enter a new dimension

I have the power, I have the will
No-one can stop me now
I am ready to enter a new dimension

I feel your life flowing through me
By my will alone I am taking the first step
