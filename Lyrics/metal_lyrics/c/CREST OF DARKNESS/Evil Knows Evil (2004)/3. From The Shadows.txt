They know that you are wondering,
but they canât give you any answers.
Blinded by the words of their âholy godâ
they believe that you are insane.

You are feeling lonely, but you are not alone.
You are feeling weak, but you donât know.

So much sorrow. So much hate. For what reason?

You are feeling scared, but you will soon understand.
You are someone special, but you donât know.

A diabolical possession?
The hypocritical priests
are filling your head with lies.
Afraid of the truth;
afraid of loosing control
they are hiding their weakness behind
empty words.

From the shadows. From the deep of your soul
you are finding a reason to live.

Itâs not supposed to be easy, but you have no choice
if you want to realise your dreams.

By following your path you are becoming a scapegoat
in a world on its way to damnation.

They do call you a traitor.
They do call you their enemy.
In their eyes you are nothing
but a threat to their society.

Tell no lies! Thatâs what youâve always heard.
In God we trust! Itâs just a parody!

Nameless fear. Anxiety. What lies behind?

Tell no lies! Words in a world of liars.
Open your eyes and you will see!
Heard about the âblind leading the blindâ?

So much sorrow. So much hate.
For what reason?

Nameless fear. Anxiety. What lies behind?
