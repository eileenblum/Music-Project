This is a never ending story
written by the human race.
Endless wars, violence and death,
a journey trough unspeakable acts.

This is a never ending story
describing the decay of the earth.
Self-destructive, out of control,
the children of God is going under.

Play the game! Spill the blood!
Enter Cosmic Terror!

We have heard it all before:
Kill them all!
We have heard it all before:
Search and destroy!

Life after death, more than an illusion?
Life after death, a dream?
Holy wars, nuclear bombs,
a part of a bigger plan?

We have heard it all before [repeat]

I am The Master,
and you are my soldiers.

I am The Master,
and you are my slaves.

I command you to
play my game,
and feel the lust!

We have heard it all before [repeat]

Play the game!
Spill the blood!
Enter Cosmic Terror!

We have heard it all before [repeat]
