It is growing;
- a tremendous lust.
It is growing;
- instincts stronger than
life itself.

Give me strenght! I needâ¦
Flesh and Blood!

I am dying,
but I will be born again.
I am dying,
but I am blessed
with the darkest gift.

Like a flash in my brain..
Iâm feeding on your blood!

All I need
is to be given life
from the source where
it all started.

Like a flash in my brainâ¦
I can only seeâ¦

Flesh and Blood!
Give meâ¦
Eternal life!

Whatever I eat
becomes a part of me.
Whatever I eat
becomes a reality in
my world of dreams

Give me strenght! I needâ¦

Flesh and Blood!
Give me...
Eternal life!

It is growing;
- a tremendous lust.
It is growing;
- instincts stronger than
life itself.
