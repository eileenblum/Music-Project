You have opened my eyes.
Now I am free!
Through your existence
I have found myself.
In a dream;
- as a part of your universe...

I am invincible!
I am a god!
I am immortal!
I am a god!

In a dream;
- as a part of your universeâ¦

I am almighty!
I am a god!
I am a creator!
I am a god!

I have heard your voice.
I know the law!
Driven by what I thought
was just an instinct
I do now understand
so much more!

Black horizon in front of me;
-majestically rising.
Filled with veneration
I am watching
the world of eternal darkness.

In a dream;
- as a part of your universeâ¦

I am free!
