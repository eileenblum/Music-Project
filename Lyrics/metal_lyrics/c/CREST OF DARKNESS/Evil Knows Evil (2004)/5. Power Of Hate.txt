I can hear your long-drawn screams.
I can feel your pain.
Mutilated and disgraced
you are going insane.

In my dreams I have seen you die.
Grotescue pictures painted on my retinae.
In my dreams I have heard you cry.
Finally you are meeting your destiny.

Driven by the power of hate
I am judging you!
Driven by the power of hate
I am cursing you!

This is a manifestation of my growing hate.
An answer to my prayers.
This is my revenge.
Let death put an end to your miseries.

I have waited for this miracle.
I have waited for so long.
What a pleasure watching your fall.
Satan knows it makes me strong.

You have haunted me for many years.
Covered with blood
you are now standing at deathâs door.
Captured in the grip of the demons,
tell me now: âWhere is your saviour?â

Driven by the power of hate
I am judging you!
Driven by the power of hate
I am cursing you!
