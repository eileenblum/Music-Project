Nameless, Unthinkableâ¦ Living only by the night.

Smothering horror. Silence and death.
Mystical dreams in a sunless dimension.

Unholy creatures of uncertain age.
Like cocoons sleeping in the night.

Gothic wonderland - Hell on earth?
A whole universe of magic and passion.

Moving shadows. Dreadful delight.
Inexplicable bloodthirstiness.

Nameless, Unthinkable... Living only by the night.

Dribble of blood.
Fluttering wings.
A dream?

The presence of a great power.
More than a weak memory?

It is all over. It is completed.
It is all over. One more life.

Wide open. Steering, dead eyes.
Hideous satisfaction. More than a weak memory?

Nameless, Unthinkable... Living only by the night.

A call or a warning? The jaws of death?
Such a great power! Such a strength!

A voice from the undead? A voice from the damned?
Such a great wisdom! Such an intelligence!

Under the influence. Under the spell.
Through centuries endless wandering.

Moving shadows. Dreadful delight.
Inexplicable bloodthirstiness.

Nameless, Unthinkable... Living only by the night.
