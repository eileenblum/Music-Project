Weâre like a warhead!
A deadly warhead!
Remember warhead!
Warhead! Warhead! [2x]

Memories from another time,
- apocalyptical rites.
In our dreams theyâre still alive,
- all these unholy nights.

Warhead 666! [2x]

The answers lie in our hearts,
- we know that we are
going to conquer the whole world
under the Black Star!!

We donât need the believers
of God!
Cut out their living hearts,
and drink their blood!

Warhead 666! [2x]

The eternal flame of power
is shining brighter!

We are the Chosen Ones,
- the Angels of Death!
Christians; - You will soon take
your last breath!

Weâre like a warhead!
A deadly warhead!
Remember warhead!
Warhead! Warhead! [2x]

Hail Satan!

Weâre like a warhead!
A deadly warhead!
Remember warhead!
Warhead! Warhead! [2x]
