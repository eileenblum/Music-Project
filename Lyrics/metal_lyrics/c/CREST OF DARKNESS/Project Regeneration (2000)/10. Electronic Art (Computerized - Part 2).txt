the cycle 
never ends
say my name
and I shall live

nerves
electricity
massive energy
spread my message
through the electronic art

hardware/brain
dark dreams/the law
it's a sign/you know the claw
from the past
a prophesy
it's my number/666

indistinguishable
new forms of life
all controlled
by me

children
of the night
spread my message
through the electronic art

hardware/brain
dark dreams/the law
it's a sign/you know the claw
from the past
a prophesy
it's my number/666
