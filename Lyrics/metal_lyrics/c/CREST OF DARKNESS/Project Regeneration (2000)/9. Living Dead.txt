emptiness
your soul will forever cry
emptiness
slowly you will fade away

your God is dead
your world is gone

your  conscience/a prison
you've got no free will
you're a living dead/a marionette

I am your deepest fear
I am the truth

I know who you are
I know your real name

wake me up from my sleep

a ghost from the past
a voice from the grave
you know I will find you
it's written in your eyes

emptiness....
wake me up from my sleep
sometimes you love me
wake me up from my dreams
sometimes you hate me

wake me up from my sleep
you have got the key
wake me up from my dreams
and you will learn to see

emptiness....

you have got the key
I will lead you to the gate
you will learn to see
through the eyes of the Beast
