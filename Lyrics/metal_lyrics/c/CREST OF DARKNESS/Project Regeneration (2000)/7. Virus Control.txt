you're a traitor
always on the run

you're the enemy
sentenced to die

they're watching you
and they'll soon attack

we are The Virus Control
created to kill
we are The Virus Control 
fulfilling The Lord's will
we don't believe
in good and evil

we don't believe
in hypocritical liers

to all of you
watch out for our
new invention

The Virus Controll 

we are The Virus Controll
created to kill
we are The Virus Controll
fulfilling The Lord's will
blessed are the strong
cursed are the weak

we are The Virus Controll
created to kill
we are The Virus Controll
fullfilling The Lord's will

open wide the gates of Hell
