eyes without life
hypnotizing black stars 
brains without bodies
artificial intelligence

a world cold as ice
my world
a world cold as ice
a world COMPUTERIZED

we are a part of 
the seductive evilness
senseless creatures
given birth by hate

a world cold as ice
my world
a world cold as ice
a world COMPUTERIZED

hail the executioners of the new empire
hail the bringers of the law

a world cold as ice
my world
a world cold as ice
a world COMPUTERIZED

animal instincts
the motive power
transformed into
the ultimate warmachine
join or die
your destiny lies in our hands
from the first beginning
we have been the true rulers of the earth
