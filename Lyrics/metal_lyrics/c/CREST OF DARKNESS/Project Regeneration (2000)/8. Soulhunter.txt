in a dream a beauty lives
lots have tried to kiss her lips
and touch her naked body

in a dream a beauty lives
she'll fill your mind complete
unforgettable she is

you've sold your soul

this could have been your swan song
your god won't listen to your prayers
depraved you are

this could have been your swan song
you've entered a labyrinth
there's only one way out

you've sold your soul

a demon from the underworld
totally irresistible
beautiful and frightening

a demon from the underworld
she'll lead you to the one and only
Infernal Majesty

you've sold your soul

slowly you'll understand
you've sold your soul
you're one with the Beast
forget what's left behind
forget your former life
your soul's made free
the world's waiting for YOU
enjoy the pleasures of the flesh

in a dream a beauty lives
lots have tried to kiss her lips
and touch her naked body

in a dream a beauty lives
she'll fill your mind complete
unforgettable she is

you've sold your soul
