they're watching your face
a face shining with excitement
they're feeling your strenght
you're so full of life

a dream
living forever
in the twilight zone

they're everywhere
you don't know them/they know you
they're always searching
for a victim made of flesh and blood

they're the Gods of Darkness
embodiments of the night
they're the bringers of magic
strong and powerful

a dream
living forever 
in the twilight zone

HOMINIS NOCTURNA

a dream
living forever
in the twilight zone

they're watching your face
a face shining with excitement
they're feeling your strenght
you're so full of life

a dream/your dream
your dream/their dream

HOMINIS NOCTURNA

a place with no memories
simple moments of beauty
can't last forever
love isn't the only truth
we can't stay together

nobody knows what I feel
who could ever understand
I'm not a believer
I won't see the promised land

FOLLOW ME
DIE
FOLLOW ME
COMMIT SUICIDE

I'm so sad and lonely
but I don't wanna change my life
I've found my own solution
in my hand/cold steel/a knife

I've always heard
this clear and mighty Voice
a call from the eternity
it gives me no choise

FOLLOW ME
DIE
FOLLOW ME
COMMIT SUICIDE
