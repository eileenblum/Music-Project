False sense and false morals guiding your beliefs
Hunt sheep to violate and bring them to their knees
Accuse the truth as a heretic and hide him from the mass
Take your plague of ignorance and stick it up your ass

For the end of days has come when your fortresses shall crumble
For the dawn of Aquarius is when your empire shall become rubble
Your army of hypocrites shall fall into their fabrications
The damned shall awaken and resent your deprivations

Lies!

Too long have you posed as the way for all the pure to follow
Follow the light until you have left their minds hollow
Antagonize anyone with a mind for their own
Who chooses a life outside your false reality and blindfold

As the sky begins to bleed
You choke on your own words and die from your greed
So many lives lost for your blood corporation
So much death resulting from your desperation

A see-through cross
For the symbol that you worship most is the one you so often betray
Paradise is lost
From your avaricious campaign to seek the open minded to brutally slay
Bury the truth
Dissolve history and hide the facts then provide your own veracity
Poisoning youth
Poor blood into the chalice tainting their minds with a false reality

[Chorus]
Stare through your glass crucifix and see me on the other side
Alone in the darkness I can see right through your lies
Worship anyone they command you to like a mindless pawn
Apocalypse rise; a new age in the light of our crimson dawn

False conceptions, fake reflections
Foggy truths, poisoned fruit
Damn me while I resent you
Fear me while I reveal you
Defraud all the nonbelievers
Try to silence the keepers â I see through you

The end is here
Time for change to shake the oppression of this cult
Time for fear
As the tyrants fall from grace for their faults

Stare through your glass crucifix and see me on the other side
Alone in the darkness I can see right through your lies
Worship anyone they command you to like a mindless pawn
Apocalypse rise; a new age in the light of our crimson dawn

Through the flickering spokes of time reality unfolds
The virus is cast away and the entire story told
Finally the pages can be read and remain firm
History is ours now as all shall soon learn

Be gone all the sickness that has infected their weak minds
And perhaps my day will come when I can look behind
To see the shadows dissolving unveiling what they knew
This wealth is the truth and I welcome it for spite of you

Stare through your glass crucifix and see me on the other side
Alone in the darkness I can see right through your lies
Worship anyone they command you to like a mindless pawn
Apocalypse now; a new age in the shadow of our crimson dawn
