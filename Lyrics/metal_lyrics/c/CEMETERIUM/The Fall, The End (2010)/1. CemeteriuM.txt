The density of pure death consumes you
Suffocate. Death becomes of you

Forget me not
In memory sustain
Though useless it is
For all is the same
Drowning in nothingness
Fade into emptiness
A moment to pass
As inevitable as the last

Breathe in my sorrow
Suffocate in my wrath
Drown in my bitterness
Die for me
