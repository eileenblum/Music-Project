Feel the life slip away from you
As infinity draws near
The end is forever
The end is right here

Pain
Suffering
A life of despise
Soul
Rotting
Before my eyes

The highlight of my life
Was the day that I died
The moment I shut my eyes
Was the last time I cried

Feeling is limited
As it soon disappears
As fateâs imminence
Never fails to appear

Lying in a pool of blood
No one to receive me above
Nothing but vile blackness
My eternal rest

Take my life
A piece of nothing
