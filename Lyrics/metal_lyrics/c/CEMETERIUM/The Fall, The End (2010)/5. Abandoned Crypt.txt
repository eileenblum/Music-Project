Dormant in frost, solitude; loss
Entombed despise under fire singed skies
Dormant in pain, death's cold flame
Forgotten despair in the frozen air.

Hollow, lost, stagnant
Damned, dead, abandoned

Solemn grave of death's slaves
Eternal misery, cries of mercy
No coming back from life's pact
You were all tricked into the abandoned crypt.

Decomposing spirits crying,
Nothing left; everyone dying.
Fear and hate; violence retaliates
Eternity lost with more they take
Soliloquy of desperation
All gloom; no hint of elation
Barren silence in the solemn entrance
Tormented souls pay their rent.

Look inside, to the silent emptiness
Run and hide from fate's caress.

When you're pulled to the bowels of hell
Powerless, you cannot break my spell
My heart is yours; in you I will confide
Until it's broken; when you and I shall die.

Bloodied tears, two thousand years
Taken away, nothing to say...

Your rotting body I lie in my crypt
Now our love will never shift
Another corpse for my collection
To please my desire for dissection

Locked inside, unheard cries
Trapped and lost, true love's cost...

Forever damned

They will never be free
They feed the hunger in me
I robbed their bodies and sold their souls
Nothing left but lost memories and skulls

Dormant in frost, solitude; loss
Entombed despise under fire singed skies
Dormant in pain, death's cold flame
Forgotten despair in the frozen air.

Hollow, lost, stagnant
Damned, dead, abandoned

Solemn grave of death's slaves
Eternal misery, cries of mercy
No coming back from life's pact
You have all tripped into my abandoned crypt.
