Where do you run;
When the earth falls apart beneath your feet
When nothing is left
Will you wait for salvation as you weep?
How long until you realize
That your time is forever expired
Where is your god now?
As you drown in fire

Beneath this feeble dimension lies the immense valley of scorn
Cracks expanding along our reality bring us closer to its core

Where do you run;
When your time is forever expired
Nothing is left
Your stupidity and ignorance has backfired
Where do you run;
Now that nothing is left.

As your feeble cushions of hope are all devoured
Pathetic on your knees with nobody to grant you forgiveness
Your future is the same as everyoneâs; under an unmarked grave
Infinite ashes in a sea of decay

Here I cry; lonely and in vain
Nobody will save me. I have no one to blame
For the first time I reach for hope
For once in this life I wish I could believe
Lonely and terrified, I offer you my knee
For this is the last breath I shall ever contain.

Itâs all a chimera
A conscience dream
My mind was made
To deceive me

How could everyone fall for such an empty drabble?
How can infinity be easier to conceive than something final?

Where do you run;
When the earth falls apart beneath your feet
When nothing is left
Will you wait for salvation as you weep?
How long until you realize
That your time is forever expired
Where is your god now?
As you close your eyes forever.
