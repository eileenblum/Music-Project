I considered myself the unlucky one
Here I still am while she is forever gone
Perhaps my death is worse and my prize is misery
A chance to linger as an outcast left in a dying world

Walk ever further but no hope is ever found
My body agonizes as my mind crumbles
Will this end? Or is it still my task to do so?

Is it any different from before?
People struggling to survive, finding a means to exist. The futility of it all
Seems comical now, if even a sliver Can exist in this
The greatest of all tragedies

It changes you as soon as you realize it. Breathing the poisoned air of this world
Withering away from the inside, gradually, sinking further into oblivion

My charade continues on.
Forget logic, forget the truth. Cower from it, and hide behind your lies.
It makes no difference now, of all times.
Death is not just, it didn't choose her.

This barren horizon around me tells me so;
As my inexistent soul, My hollow body moves on.
Down the road, around the next corner, further into oblivion, As always
Nothing changed. I just opened my eyes for the first time
