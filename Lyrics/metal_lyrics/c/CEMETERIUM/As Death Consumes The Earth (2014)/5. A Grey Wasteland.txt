Among the desolate remains I walk forsaken through pools of acid rain.
Torment awaits me in my final hour. Sulphuric clouds gaze down on my dismay.
I cannot go on any longer.
Surrender is not an option when my enemy is the very land I walk on.

Dry blood drenched with tears of despair,
Echoes of my own screams return to me through the frozen air
Every time I close my eyes I wish I could never open them again
I wish I could die and bring this misery to an end.

Too weak to think, too spent to act
As I await my deathâ¦

The final breath is one of infinite depth.
The grey wasteland around me mocks my solemn corpse,
Writhing in pain and consternation forever with no way out.

As I await the rot, to perish.
I cannot go on any longer.

Dry blood drenched with tears of despair,
Echoes of my own screams return to me through the frozen air
Every time I close my eyes I wish I could never open them again
I wish I could die and bring this misery to an end.
