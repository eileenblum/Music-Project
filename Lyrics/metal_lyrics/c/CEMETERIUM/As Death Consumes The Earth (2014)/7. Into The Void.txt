Try one step further into a vast horizon
With nothing to be seen but ashen shadows in decay

I hear the whispers of my soul dwindling
They implore me to renounce my path
To become as a stone among the scorched monument
As the tide brings nothing but empty failure
Broken and hopeless, I can feel the warmth leaving me

I cry not for all that's lost but for all that remains
I can't see anything else beyond the void in front of me
It drains me every minute of every hour
Transparent and useless I can't even fathom
Anything at all beyond the veil
It's all forgotten. There's nothing left to remember

With the great death upon my throat pressing ever increasingly
Suffocating on my own misery.
Push harder until you hear the crackle fade and stifle it all forever

This time it will end. No more awakening. No more grey skies above. No more stench of rot.
Here I will stay to become the earth, the very death around me that poisoned me so
Fading into nothingness I will not remember
