Alter all traces of her life have disappeared forever
Nobody left alive, no one to remember

This forgotten barren wasteland
Forgotten plague upon it

Failed, forever doomed into emptiness never to return again

Hope is a false illusion
Nothing can save us from our fate

Damned, consumed by misery eternally never to awake again

If this life is so useless,
Soon to be abolished
Why, do I still exist?
A mistake, a plague, an accident
Death is the only constant
It was our only escape, yet the sameâ¦
