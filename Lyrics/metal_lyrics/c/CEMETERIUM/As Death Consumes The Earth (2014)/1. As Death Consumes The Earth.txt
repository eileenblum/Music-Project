Cold, Bitter Suffering
Agony in my eyes
Yet my feeling is gone

Peel off this rotting corpse around me
Reveal the emptiness inside of it

When time is up
When you cease to exist

She says 'Cry for mercy like youâve always done before'
There is no forgiveness, there is nothing more

Consume this lie around me turn everything back to stone
Remove the sickness, purify them in death

Death!

Cold, Bitter Suffering
Agony in my eyes
Yet my feeling is gone

As death consumes this earth
