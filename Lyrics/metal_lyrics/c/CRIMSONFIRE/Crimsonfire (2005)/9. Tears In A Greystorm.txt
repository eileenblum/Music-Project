[Chapter IX ï¿½ "Loneliness"]

I awake with rising tides
Just a spectre of this grey storm
I await for the silent touch
It comes to clothe me from my fears

[Pre-chorus]
But still, O the night
I seem to trust
Despite all the strangers
In this ghostly paradise

[Chorus]
Take me to an unknown past
Save me from my fear
Someone stop the hourglass
And drown me, O drown me
In this world
There is a place I'd always dream
Yet so close but yet was so far
There are times when I am afraid
Still it seems its whispers haunting

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus x2]

In a thought I wonder deeply
Of the light that now surrounds me
Is an end for all my searching
The final chapters of my memories

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus x2]

I await with rising tides...
