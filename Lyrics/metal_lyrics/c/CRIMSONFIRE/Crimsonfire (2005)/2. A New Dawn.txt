[Chapter II ï¿½ "Rebirth"]

You know they say, when the winter falls
The night will come and stay
Now two thousand years have passed us by
And the sun sets to rise again
On Volterra, the ice it breaks away
Let me tell you a tale, of power and majesty
Through the veil of white light
That turn to dark but broken by love
Driven to the edge of the world
Let me tell you a tale
How the night came across the sea
The innocence of sanity was taken that day
Hope and pray for the night to go away
Tears from the heavens, now they fall

[Chorus]
And the dreams of yesterday
Wait for tomorrow
At the end of time
The dreams of yesterday
Wait for tomorrow
At the gates of Volterra
Let me tell you tale, of power and majesty
Eternal resurrection granted by the hand of God
Paradise lost but now is found
Up from the ashes we now rise
