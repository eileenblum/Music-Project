[Chapter III ï¿½ "Destruction"]

In the hour of darkness
Thou be afraid
As the crimson fires
Unfold their rage

[Chorus]
Conjuring the blackened reign
Conjuring into thy name
Here I come with vengeance
To seal your fate
But don't you try and stop me
I feed on hate

[Chorus]

Just a dream
You have now betrayed
Everything will fade away
My sands of time disappear
But your ending has just begun
I will bring you sorrow
Your dying day
There is no tomorrow
Or time to pray
Come here on wings of doom
Come here to guide you through

[Chorus]
