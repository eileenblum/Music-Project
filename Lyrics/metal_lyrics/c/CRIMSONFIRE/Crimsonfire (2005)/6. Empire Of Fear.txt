[Chapter VI ï¿½ "Deception"]

Silent the terror that reigned
Into the ashes I fall
Sacred the sun as it rose
Awaiting the death of us all
Destroy all that is and will be
Peace that will fade in the wind
Kneel and you will drink from my cup
Behold now the beast and its wrath

[Chorus]
Suffocate your dreams
Suffocate your dreams
Caught in a web of defeat
Speak only what you believe in
I am the one you will fear
Betrayed and the end is now here
I have come to drag you down
I am the hell that now surrounds
I shine the demons light
I don't leave without a fight
Suffocate your dreams
Suffocate your dreams
