[Chapter X ï¿½ "Destiny"]

Of the secrets we all shared
Empty rooms and distant memories
In the far end of the halls
Of our minds
There is a prophecy that stares
Carved into this kingdom
Of these desert sands
Of a world called Arakis
In my dreams
Deep inside of me
There is something more to be
The Promised Land I am to rule
Let the storm reveal the universal word
Bring thy judgement I've foreseen

[Chorus]
Lord of the Rising Sands
As a newborn of this land
It was written what is to be done
In the temple of the infinite sun
Of the darkness left behind
Now comes a light
A Messiah will be sworn
There is an empire to fall
A change of wind to follow soon
On this realm called planet Dune

[Chorus]

It was written what is to be done
In the temple of the sun
From the darkness far behind
There will come a light
I have given all my faith
My silent prayers I have thrown away
There is a war that rages on
O will the rain come?
