[Chapter I ï¿½ "Hope"]

Welcome to your abstracted life
Brooding nightmares, creations of your mind
These hellish walls close in, bring them down with all your will
I awake, all the sinners all the saints
An enchanted storm it comes my way

[Chorus]
Bring the thunder, bring the rain
Through the skies of Eternal Days
Can you believe that there is no sense?
Of peace nor love or the countenance
In this void outside existence
And now the shadows cast upon
The virgin nights forever gone
Destiny charms he who walks alone

[Chorus]

From the east into the west
Future walls in ancient lands
Sweet taste of peace
And the bitter taste of war
