[Chapter IV ï¿½ "Change"]

Enter the cosmic void
Where space and time meet as one
With the sun
Emptiness fills the circle now
In search of truth, there is guilt
From thyself
My words bring wisdom here
O shall we rise through the clouds in the skies
Carry me to the ancient rule
I sacrifice all to you that is true
Flowing through the stream of dreams
I call to you to release me
Living, silver, breathing let the elements combine
Constellations in align
Transformation has begun
Seven are the seas that now pound upon the shores
The eyes of earth are watching you
From the ocean of the storms
Destiny a haunting plea a way to reach your soul
In the flask the golden one
Filters out the blackened son
The power cometh from within
From the ocean of the storms
In the house of the rising sun
Visions of peace and love eternally
The echoes of a thousand nights
Through the gates of ancient times
This is the Morning of the Magicians
