Free fall, free falling me
Never thought to find the source
Of gravity...

A parallel of fear
Reservations justified
Have I torn the eyes,
Of my, my inner child?

Running out, running out of ways
Of seeing faults in everyone
Everyone but me

Oh no! I'm looking forward seeing obstacles
I keep drawing new lines to cross
I'm always looking for the ghosts in the dark
And oh my! I am the only cause of my decline
I keep on reading in between the lines
I need to kill the pessimist inside

Numb from the anesthetic
How long... Was I Out?!

Oh no! I'm looking forward seeing obstacles
I keep drawing new lines to cross
I'm always looking for the ghosts in the dark
And oh my! I am the only cause of my decline
I keep on reading in between the lines
I need to kill the pessimist inside
