Hey! You're looking left, the misdirection's right
You're missing out on a cut of the spoils
Or at least you think so, the human struggle
Is the only war that they try to collect on

Lingering, behind a golden blanket
Paperwork and bandits,
Are running circles round our heads
In hidden hallways, are the pigs of greed
And if you're looking close
You can hear a stampede

Our systemic binary
Is flawed from head to toe
Their mental tectonics share ionic bonds

Don't go counting on what the precedence of public heads
Try to feed to you, 'cause they're fed too
They're as honest as wolves in pigs clothing
And they will feed you, cuz they're fed too

How far how we come,
From civilizations that fell before?
This is injustice bears a truth,
All around you!

We ignore the signs of warning
Follow the piper like rats
The river approaches, but no one
No one looks back

Hey! You're looking left, the misdirection's right
You're missing out on a cut of the spoils
Or at least you think so, the human struggle
Is the only war that they try to collect on

Don't go counting on what the precedence of public heads
Try to feed to you, 'cause they're fed too
They're as honest as wolves in pigs clothing
And they will feed you, cuz they're fed too

Go!
