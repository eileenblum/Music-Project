Welcome home, or so at least I thought
The memories and identity
I once had now are lost
Follow me, follow me
This is all youâre ever going to be

Long ago, I, once resembled you
With the same old skin
But a different view
But I saw an abyss forming before my eyes
And I fell for the oh so, attractive light
But I was mistaken
Oh so mistaken.... And now I've lost it all

I spat my faith to swallow the sin
But I won't let you make
The same mistakes I made
Just breathe....
Just breathe....
Just breathe....
