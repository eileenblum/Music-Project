Acres of space I populate
The invisible is made tangible
When synchronized these sticks and strings
Make everything seem possible

It is more than just a melody
It's about creating alternate realities

...And I'd know!

If you could, would you not go,
Somewhere no one could follow?

We're chasing worlds!
Oh! I've been places I never thought
Existed between notes and chords
When you go there you won't ever come back
It's just music
I've been further than the eye can see
Dimensions only revealed to me
When you go there you won't ever come back
It's just music...

And we're not done yet!

If you could, would you not go,
Somewhere no one could follow?

We're chasing worlds!
Oh! I've been places I never thought
Existed between notes and chords
When you go there you won't ever come back
It's just music
I've been further than the eye can see
Dimensions only revealed to me
When you go there you won't ever come back
It's just music...

And this flame inside,
Burns everything in sight

Acres of space I populate
Invisible is made tangible...
