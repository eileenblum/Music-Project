Between the sun and satellites
We let our thoughts wonder wild and culminate
Our dreams had truly intertwined
We lay above the grass and let the silence resonate

Trying hard to concentrate
Remember all the details
I'm saving pixels of information to keep

Sitting here I know from now
I will recall this moment
Of a life where words could never speak
What you meant to me
If despair overwhelms me
I will recall this memory
Of a life where words could never speak
What you meant to me

The smell of cigarettes at night
The sound of children playing in the summer time
Brings back the days we
Sat down and smiled, but said nothing

Trying hard to concentrate
Remember all the details
I'm saving pixels of information to keep

I'm trying to recall!

Somewhere down the line
This will be a glimpse
Exemplifying times
That I will reminisce!

That I will reminisce!

Sitting here I know from now
I will recall this moment
Of a life where words could never speak
What you meant to me
If despair overwhelms me
I will recall this memory
Of a life where words could never speak
What you meant to me
