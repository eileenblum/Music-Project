What have we become?
A population cultured on the impulse?
With running free, there comes a cost;
The Composure to remain the Evolved

I won't enslave myself
I won't enslave

I am a form that you detest
The red herring of a habitat
Don't dare admit and don't dare address!
That we have lost intellect!

Show! Show me just a glimpse of
Any hope that we'll improve
We'll fall into oblivion if we don't
Don't salvage hope

We are a generation decayed
I am the virus sent to protect the plague!

To protect the plague!

I won't enslave myself, I won't enslave myself
Show! Show me just a glimpse of
Any hope that we'll improve
We'll fall into oblivion If we don't,
Don't salvage hope
