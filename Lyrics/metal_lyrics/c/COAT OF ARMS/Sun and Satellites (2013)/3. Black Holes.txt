Born with the world at my feet
Content with anything 'cause
Every part of me then held some identity
Punished myself for inconsistencies
Beyond, beyond my doing

Well I gave into pity's pull
And got lost in the heart of spite
So I built the blackest hole
To take me back in time

What I won were rare materials
That until now, Seemed to offer any value at all
If I knew then what I know now
I wouldn't have let myself
Myself drown out

Well I gave into pity's pull
And got lost in the heart of spite
So I built the blackest hole
To take me back in time

I only had myself to blame
I only had myself
You only have yourselves to blame
We only have ourselves

So take me back in time...

Well I gave into pity's pull
And got lost in the heart of spite
So I built the blackest hole
To take me back in time

Oh no! Take me back in time!!
