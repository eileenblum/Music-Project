So many years invested into a love
So firm and so resilient
Standing in it's way
Are all the foundations
That put this all in place

If the dream ever seems
A remote possibility
Am I prepared to give in
To all its needs

The skies are clearing way
Exposing horizons that I've always craved to see....

There's only one, There's only one-way
There's only one, There's only way out...
Alive!

To sustain the balance is the key

I've built this throne
Like a king besieged
But the palaces that I have made
Is the price that is being asked of me

I feel the moment overflow
A looming darkness clouds the thrill
Accomplishment and tragedy eclipse
And it sounds like this...

To sustain the balance is the key

If the dream ever seems
A remote possibility
Am I prepared to give in
To all its needs
I'll do what it takes!
