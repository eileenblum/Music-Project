Running from silhouettes,
Roll down the curtains
Donât let the light in
Iâve seen enough of my life go out the window
Leave me here to be, ethereal

Terrified, terrified
Cuz Iâve been here before
But it takes even for me to overcome
Tonight, thereâs no return

Grit between my teeth, oh please
I donât need your sympathy
Iâm a pragmatic deadbeat
Undeserved potential in me
Wasted on learning how to fulfill
A craze for a comfort
Instead I just further derail

I can hear the silence deafening
I got me involved
I can hear the silence echoing
And it tears me up

Running from silhouettes,
Roll down the curtains
Donât let the light in
Iâve seen enough of my life go out the window
Leave me here to be, ethereal

Terrified, terrified
Cuz Iâve been here before
But it takes even for me to overcome
Tonight, thereâs no return

Iâve barely even scratched the surface
Tonight, Iâll take a knee, Iâll leave it all exposed
Leave me to be,
Leave me the fuck alone.

Peeling paint infects my walls
There ainât a thing that you could do
My mind is numb, heed unwelcome
Thereâs no return

Tonight thereâs no return
