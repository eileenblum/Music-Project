Oh! We advanced but went in the wrong way,
The art form of communication now binary,
When did we cross the line, of being inept?

We got killed building in the mainframe,
Invisible wires, stretching for miles,
Always plugged in and live
Where do we go from here?

We all need that mother fucking update

Silence the sensor in you
Enslaved, you serve
It rings, you come running
Silence the sensor in you
Breathe in, log off
Look up, and breathe outâ¦

Itâs so pitiful
We only rely on the digital
Just to trend our lives away
I feel sick, I donât even get it
How we willingly participate

Paint the town in a shade of red
Spill the blood that runs through all this technology
Broken down to a simple code
Bow your head, expose your neck to pull the plug

Itâs so pitiful, we only rely on the digital
We all need that mother fucking update

Silence the sensor in you
Enslaved, you serve
It rings, you come running
Silence the sensor in you
Breathe in, log off
Look up, and breathe outâ¦
Silence!
