Iâve been here before,
But there are things I cant bear to tell you
Iâm having dreams, Iâm having dreams of it
Iâm having dreams of it
And I know the only way to save you from the fire
Is to watch you burn
Iâm having dreams, Iâm having dreams of it
Iâm having dreams of it

The sun was setting a normal night,
An earth dressed in crimson light
Before the mayhem was underway
The reasons were flawed the intentions were pure
Our understanding had outweighed the good
So much for wanting to change the world

Everything you want is death
Or at least you donât know it yet
But the stars are better from afar
Cuz every step that you take forward
You donât see yourself moving two back

I see circle come full, a deluge of sin
The worst of all within

Iâve been here before,
But there are things I cant bear to tell you
Iâm having dreams, Iâm having dreams of it
Iâm having dreams of it
And I know the only way to save you from the fire
Is to watch you burn
Iâm having dreams, Iâm having dreams of it
Iâm having dreams of it

My eyes donât see the world
They only protect what my mind forgot
My eyes donât see the world
Only conceal these memories
These fucking memories

Iâve been here before,
But there are things I cant bear to tell you
Iâm having dreams, Iâm having dreams of it
Iâm having dreams of it
And I know the only way to save you from the fire
Is to watch you burn
Iâm having dreams, Iâm having dreams of it
Iâm having dreams
