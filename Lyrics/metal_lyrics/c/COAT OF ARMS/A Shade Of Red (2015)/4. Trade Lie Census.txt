Theyâre counting your self worth
In numbers and currencies
What are you bringing to the table?
Fork out your health, your time, and freedom
âTil the money machine is fed stable
You think you rule my world
But Iâm the bastard of all your sons
I see all of your hidden teeth
And through all your fucking smiles

How are we meant to progress
And work for men, while holding their pockets
For respect?
How do you want me to pay?
When money talks, but talk is so cheap
You never win

Their grasp forever exceeds their reach
And youâre the prosthetic they need
Youâre either so far under the thumb
Or just a mean time contingency
Wipe your mouth, come clean
When youâre selling these chains to me
I speak your tongue; I trade your lies,
I am the corporate devil in disguise

How are we meant to progress
And work for men, while holding their pockets
For respect?
How do you want me to pay?
When money talks, but talk is so cheap
You never win

Iâll get whatâs mine
Iâll get whatâs mine

Change the power,
We donât belong to them, donât belong to them
Be the reminder,
Donât belong to them, donât belong to them
They make you believe its copper bottomed
Until you sign under the dotted line

Who am I to question the ways
Of the hands that fed me
Son of a family to never taste
The ail of making ends meet
But I seen the faces, the circumstances
Of those who deserve much more
And I fear for my own and what we become
Oh god it feels so wrong
It feels so wrong

Oh god it feels so wrong

It ainât a lie, if you lie too
Ain't that the truth?
Everybody just makes their own
Aint that the policy man?
Whoâs ahead can fucking break the contract...
