Your world, and your life
Are nothing but a game to me
Iâm terraforming the places you love
To fucking hunt you down
Try all you want to use your surroundings to hide
But youâre better off running
Iâm terraforming the places you love
To fucking hunt you down

So many lies I let pass, everybody thinks that I donât have
What it takes to cut you down to size
Rabid with bones that are post-mortem cold
And the look of murder in my eyes
Use the dark, take the night
But the shadows all belong to me
I am the apex, the calculated
Regret is a feat I donât fucking have

Your world, and your life
Are nothing but a game to me
Iâm terraforming the places you love
To fucking hunt you down
Try all you want to use your surroundings to hide
But youâre better off running
Iâm terraforming the places you love
To fucking hunt you down

Iâll fucking hunt,
I will hunt you down

I hear you cry, I can hear you pleading form here
That donât do nothing, that donât do nothing to me
I got my mind set,
Killer instinct kicking in me
I know youâre scared
I see every move you make with the fear

Your world, and your life
Are nothing but a game to me
Iâm terraforming the places you love
To fucking hunt you down
Try all you want to use your surroundings to hide
But youâre better off running
Iâm terraforming the places you love
To fucking hunt you down

Iâm already behind you
