I donât belong to this terrain
Limits and boundaries are set by the rule
And the contour of all that we create
But I refuse to resign
That Iâm bound to a society
Cold and maligned

I know a body that holds
Somewhere that I can call home
It was there for our beginning and knows
That we will all be erased

Pull me down beneath the waves
Show me havens where secrets remain
Cuz Iâm not concerned about now
I only care about where I start again
And the ocean is our sacred origin

Shelter me for ages, and hide me from the day
I want to live down in the darkness
And remain a mystery
Cuz the world donât understand me
And maybe Iâm to blame
But I got my head under the surface
Spread my heart across the seas

Pull me underneath
Pull me underneath
Pull me underneath
Spread my heart across the seas

I donât belong to this terrain
Limits and boundaries are set by the rule
And the contour of all that we create
But I refuse to resign
That Iâm bound to a society
Cold and maligned

Pull me down beneath the waves
Show me havens where secrets remain
Cuz Iâm not concerned about now
I only care about where I start again
And the ocean is our sacred origin

Shelter me for ages, and hide me from the day
I want to live down in the darkness
And remain a mystery
