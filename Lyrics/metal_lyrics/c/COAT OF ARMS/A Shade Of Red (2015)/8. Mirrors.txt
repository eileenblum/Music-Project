Damned if I do (move on)
Damned if I donât (let go)
Guilty of having soft hands, but youâre are stained with blood
Always ambivalent, as youâre working your lies out

Iâm wiser to the words
Iâm wiser to the ways
I see right through
The smoke and mirrors you exude to me

Set me on fire
Burn away the truth
Cuz maybe Iâm a liar
But something tells me so are you

Everything that I loved
A solid foundation, a sense of integration
A connection adorned
Everything youâve become
An imitation, a filth forever jaded
You are a fucking fraud

Father you were rightâ¦.

Got back the life, got back the life
That you stole from me

Set me on fire
Burn away the truth
Cuz maybe Iâm a liar
But something tells me so are you

Father you were rightâ¦

You are a fucking fraud
