Relapse! Back to the beginning again
Empathizing voices within mean to conspire
I need to find my totem
Cuz Iâm in a dream deferred, and itâs growing dire
Maybe I deserve disgust, deserve disdain
Cuz I found a solace and a poise
With those who feel the same
Who feel the sameâ¦

Me and all my dreads, coalesced
Fed into me so far
I barely know who represents
What were once episodes,
Takes me again and again
And I feel Iâve lost control
Looked for hope and found more pain
Does it make me sick,
That I know feel even more in place?
What were once episodes
Takes me again and again
And I feel Iâve lost control

Release me

Calling out cuz there ainât a thing I can do
I was wrong cuz my conscience has never been clear
Iâm finding a way Iâm finding a way to
Make it out all right
I was wrong cuz my conscience has never been clear

Conscience has never been
Conscience have never been,
Clearâ¦
