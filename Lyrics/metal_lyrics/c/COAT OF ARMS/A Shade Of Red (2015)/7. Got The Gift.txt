I got the gift; the means to explain
But the more I know the more Iâm forlorn
I hold the crown but see all its mistakes
Take back from me my intellect
Cuz I canât use it

I observe, and just waste my time
Deflect from the hidden agenda
There are things here that donât belong

Theories I canât deny, reasons that opened my eyes
Lessons that freed my mind are taking shape
Leave me whatâs left behind

I got the gift, I got the gift
Ignorance is bliss
I got theâ¦. I got the gift

I got the gift; the means to explain
But the more I know the more Iâm forlorn
I hold the crown but see all its mistakes
Take back from me my intellect
Cuz I canât use it

Reduced as a laud to me, and I know,
Their truth is a lie, these pages and lines
Unfold vile design
I see the signs

I can see theâ¦
I can see the signs

Once you see you canât undo
What your mind is so well taught to
I thought I had the tools to put it all to use
So I could change it all

To change it all

Reduced as a laud to me, and I know,
Their truth is a lie, the pages and lines
Unfold vile design
I see the signs, and I know
Their truth is a lie, the pages and lines
Unfold vile design

Cuz I canât use itâ¦
