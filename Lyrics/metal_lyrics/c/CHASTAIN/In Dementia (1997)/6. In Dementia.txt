Around the corner
There's a vicious appetite
And you won't be
The first to die

Denial, admittance
Over and again
The like of
Screaming sacrifice

In dementia
In dementia

Voiceless apparitions
Condescend the mind
Istilling sanity's demise
Indignant, submissive
With a false pretense
Buried deep
Behind disguise

In dementia
In dementia

Hell hath a fury
Breeding insanity
Victim of circumstance
Lost delusion reckoning

Hell hath an anger
Breeding insanity
Selection or by chance
Mask confusion
Within rage

Psychotic hunger
With no sentiment for life
Does the world
Elude you now
Ignorance, distorted
Seething with desire
What meaning
Do you signify

In dementia
In dementia
In dementia
In dementia
