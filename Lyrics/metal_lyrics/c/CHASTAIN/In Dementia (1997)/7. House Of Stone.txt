It's been a cold day in hell
And I've been frozen in these tracks again
Your words don't ever gel
Becoming senseless, still I raise my hands again
And I'm still lost in your restraint
Still pretending every day
And the nails get deeper
But I never said I'd die for you

Now you innocence is gone
And inside there's no one home
And I'm better off alone
Than living in your house of stone

There's been a thousand lies
And a thousand  things I never said
I lived a sacrifice, lost track of time, living in the past

Now there's no more compromise
For the wasted years I've tried
And I'm better off alone
Than living in your house of stone

Don't look back
Now your time has come and gone
Much too fast and it still flies on and on
On and on and it cuts you to the bone
Once it's gone, it's gone, it's gone

Crucified, back from the dead again
Realized, resurrection from the sin

It's not a question of my strength
But then you always were the perfect one
It's going to be too late
Next time you think that
You'll be coming back for more

Well, you better think again
Living in your false pretense
Cause I'll be better off alone
Than living in you house of stone

Back from the dead again
