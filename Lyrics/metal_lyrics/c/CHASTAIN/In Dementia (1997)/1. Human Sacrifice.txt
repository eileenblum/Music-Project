So I stand before you now
And you look me up and down like I was nothing
Preaching all your lame advice
But I will never live the lie
Losing sight of all in life I don't believe in
Human Sacrifice

There's no justified belief
Your righteous in this spoken word
Why don't you shut your mouth
I don't believe you
Not a word you said, no
And your frustration aggravate this animosity

So I stand before you now
And you look me up and down like I was nothing
Envious behind your lies

Your faith doesn't save you from tomorrow's insecurities
The meaning comes so blear
It's not the right thing
But you're feeling better and words become more twisted in this ideology

So I stand before you now
And you look me up and down like I was nothing
Preaching all your lame advice
But I will never live the lie
Losing sight of all in life I don't believe in
Human Sacrifice

How long 'till you recognize that this is just a waste of time
Your screwing with mind
I don't believe you
Not a word you've said, no
And your frustrations agrravate this animosity

So I stand before you now
And you look me up and down like I was nothing
Preaching all your lame advice
But I will never live you lie
Losing sight of all in life I don't believe in
Human Sacrifice

Human Sacrifice
