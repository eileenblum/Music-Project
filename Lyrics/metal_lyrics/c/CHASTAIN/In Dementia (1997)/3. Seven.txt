A seal is broken in prophecy
And you are chosen to live
All this been  forseen
It's said we're living in the final days
Not much longer now
It's time to kill the hate
Or is it all to late

Seven to go till the sunrise
And the sky turns red like blood
Seven to go, we'll be waiting
Till the final hour

We will find the pain and we will carry on
We know the way, we've been there before
In your deepest thoughts you can't rationalize
What lies ahead or can you read the signs
There right before your eyes

Seven to go till the sunrise
And the sky turns red like blood
Seven to go, we'll be waiting
Till the final hour

Have you throught about
The things you're seeing
Can you say you know
What's going on now
Do you see the way this world is changing
Can you understand
The time is getting short

And in that moment, you will believe
The things forgotten and
All you could not conceive
The chance is given
You're the only one
Not much longer now
Seven till the son

Seven to go till the sunrise
And the sky turns red like blood
Seven to go, we'll be waiting
Till the final hour

Seven to go
Seven to go
Seven to go
Seven to go
Seven till the sunrise
Seven till blood red skies
