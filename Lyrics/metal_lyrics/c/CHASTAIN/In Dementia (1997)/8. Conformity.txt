If I wasn't evil
Would I sit upon your throne
And if I was desire
Would you still be throwing stones
I won't be the one to be a slave to you
I won't be silent to serve your point of view
You didn't think I would, did you

You are the hate that never dies
You are the lust behind the lie
Conformity
You are the greed withing the self
You are the rage within the hell
Conformity

If I was deceitful
I would be the only one
And if I ever noticed
You would still be holding on
I won't be taken, I won't compromise
You left me lifeless but I'm still alive
And I never said I'd live your lie

You are the hate that never dies
You are the lust behind the lie
Conformity
You are the greed withing the self
You are the rage within the hell
Conformity

And then you turn the screw
I'll never understand
So superficial and not worth a single thing
Tangled in your schemes, wanting to unwind
And I won't conform to

Who you wanted me to be
You make me feel so insecure
Why don't you let me go

You still play the victim
But there's nothing left to mourn
And if you ever listened
You would know that you were wrong
I'm not waiting for the axe to fall, no
Once I was blind but now I see it all
And you couldn't be any more hypocritical

You are the hate that never dies
You are the lust behind the lie
Conformity
You are the greed withing the self
You are the rage within the hell
Conformity You are the hate that never dies
You are the lust behind the lie
Conformity
You are the greed withing the self
You are the rage within the hell
Conformity

You are the hate that never dies
You are the lust behind the lie
You are the greed withing the self
You are the rage within hell
