What more do you want now?

You're not a good liar
Not as good as me
And I know you better
Better rhan you think
And I can't get you out of my head
Doesn't matter what you've said
You're the drug I couldn't quit
I've got to have some more

Violate me, degradate me, regulate me
And I don't care cause I'm a sick puppy

And I'll you a little story about it

Now I'm a junkie
And I can't come clean
Got a bad addiction, and it's killing me
Too far gone, I should have been dead
Once you got into my head
Can't remember to forget
Don't wanna anyway

Violate me, degradate me, regulate me
And I don't care cause I'm a sick puppy

I can't explain it, what you do to me
And I'm gonna burn for the things I think
And I can't get you out of my head
It doesn't matter what you said
You're the drug I couldn't quit
Give me something more

Violate me, degradate me, regulate me
And I don't care cause I'm a sick puppy

Just take this soul to bleed
I'll give you anything
I'd say I know you like it too
Don't want to let me catch up to you
It's such a welcome torturing
Hurts so good, feels so good to me

What more do you want now
Cause I'm a sick puppy
