Fly out of my soul
Deities are misconstruing
Lost sanity, dirt under nail scratching onward
Pigs I wallow with, swimming in excrement
Will this rectify some meaning

Save me from myself
I think I'm falling
Into something else
All is Blackening

Dig out of this whole
Nothing is as what it's seeming
Now seeding to sew
Seperating from the leading
I will surely die, swallowing the lie
Emptiness inside is seething
Pigs I wallow with, swimming in excrement
Will this rectify some meaning

Save me from myself
I think I'm falling
Into something else
Slowly Blackening

Somebody tell me
Where to find any peace of mind
Falling into everything I thought I'd never be
Back like it was before, I can't take no more
Nothing in this world is ever what it seems

Pigs I wallow with, swimming in excrement
Will this rectify some meaning
Empty inside, swallow the lies
Will this recify some meaning

Save me from myself
I think I'm falling
Into something else
Life is Blackening

And I say
Bow down to the ones that carry you all the way
Bow down to the ones that bury you in your grave
Bow down to the ones that carry you all the way, all the way down
Bow down to the ones that that bury you in your grave
Down
