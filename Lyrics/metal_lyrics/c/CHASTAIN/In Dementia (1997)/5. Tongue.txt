It's not for me to say what you should do
Can I make a suggestion, well I suggest that you
Save your pride for the inside, yeah

You should be in submission
You should be on your kneees
Don't want your conversation
If you want to speak to me
Speak in tongues

Do you know the things you should be doing now
Can you read beyond the innocence
Can you read through me the things that we could do
On the way down
You got to let me go, when I come around

You should be in submission
You should be on your kneees
Don't want your conversation
If you want to speak to me
Speak in tongues

And it isn't about us
And it isn't about anything more
Don't pretend it's something, no
Cause I've heard it before
And it doesn't mean anything now
If you can't be my saint then be my whore

And it isn't about love
That isn't about what I came here for
I won't ask for any thing
Don't say a word, just let me in cause
Baby, all I want from you is more

You know what I'm saying
So save you pride for the inside

You should be in submission
You should be on your kneees
Don't want your conversation
If you want to speak to me

You know what you got  to do
Speak in, speak in, speak in tongues

So you understand the things that I'm saying now
I can feel the way you burn inside
Can you see through me the things I want you to
Don't deny this

You should be in submission
You should be on your kneees
Don't want your conversation
If you want to speak to me
Speak in, speak in, speak in
Tongues
