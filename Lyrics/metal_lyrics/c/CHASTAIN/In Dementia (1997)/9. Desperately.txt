Why do we do this to ourselves, why do we pretend
It's not the same, it's all the same
So now we live a lie without reason
Can you justify this loneliness

Tell me what I have to do to make you understand the truth
Look, I know you love me still, I see through your words

You can't keep pretending that it doesn't mean a thing
And I tried to tell you everything you ougth to know
And I tried to let it end but I just can't let you go
Don't think I wanted it to be this way, baby
Don't you realize you were everything and I still want you
So desperately, desperately
No, it's not dead yet and this time won't forget
All the thing that I regret
Desperately

After all babe, don't you remember
The way it felt together and how we used to be
Don't think I wanted it to be this way
Don't you realize you were everything and I still want you
So desperately, desperately
No, it's not dead yet and this time won't forget
All the thing that I regret
Desperately

Why do we do this to ourselves, tell me baby
Don't you let it end, don't let go
You see I'm lost without your love
I need you so desperately, desperately
No, it's not dead yet and I can't forget

I won't forget
I miss your love
Desperately
