I walk the stereets late at night
Searching for relief
I know today could be my last
For that's my belief

I treat each day as the final stand
Each day I gain all that I can
LIVE HARD! There's no warranty
LIVE HARD! Before it's too late
LIVE HARD!

Visualize all that you have
And all that you see
Experience all that you can
And face life passionately

You treat each day as the final stand
Each day you gain all that you can
LIVE HARD! There's no warranty
LIVE HARD! Before it's too late
LIVE HARD! Reach out

Each dawn as I close my eyes for sleep
Another day has passed
I know tomorrow is no guarantee
So I'll go hard and fast

I walk the stereets late at night
Searching for relief
I know today could be my last
For that's my belief

I treat each day as the final stand
Each day I gain all that I can
LIVE HARD! There's no warranty
LIVE HARD! Before it's too late
LIVE HARD! Do all that you can
LIVE HARD! Reach out
LIVE HARD! There's no escape
LIVE HARD! There's no warranty
LIVE HARD! Experience
LIVE HARD! Reach out
LIVE HARD! There's no escape
