Far past the shadows, deep in my sight
I see the secrets of the chosen few

The colors cascade
From the river of thought
My visions within
Shall always prove true

I am the leader of a gallant faith
I've walked the waters as we all shall do

The colors cascade
From the river of thought
My visions within
Shall always prove true

I am the child of evermore
And I know all that will be
I am the child of evermore
And I can forever see

Listen to whispers that are so faint
They'll tell you all if you only knew

The colors cascade
From the river of thought
My visions within
Shall always prove true

I am the child of evermore
I know all that will be
I am the child of evermore
And I can forever see
