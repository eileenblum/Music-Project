Close your eyes and surrender
The peace is there within yourself
Realize, you are not alone
So close and yet so far
One day we shall be there again
Be there again

Take me home

Look into the haze
Feel the things you cannot see
They hold the meanings
Of all that you will ever be
Stand back
Surrond yourself with light
Fight on
Ignore all the screams within the night
Never, never stop

Take me home

Intuition shall be your guide
For time does not exist
It's all so easily
In the end you will insist

Stand back
Surrond yourself with light
Fight on
Ignore all the screams within the night
Never, never stop

Take me home

We will be free after
We simply see after
We reach thru to the other side
Take me home

Look into your mind
There's a place you can not see
It has the answers
To all that will ever be

Stand back
Surrond yourself with light
Fight on
Ignore all the screams within the night
Never, never stop

Take me home
So close and yet so far
Take me home

Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
