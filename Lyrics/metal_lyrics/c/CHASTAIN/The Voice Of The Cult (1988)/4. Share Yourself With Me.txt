Drag me down, take me out
Make me see the light
Take it your way, throw me out
I feel you in the night
Trap me in, suck me dry
Your eyes become the light
Look at me, tell me how
To feel you in the light

Share yourself with me

Handle me, show your face
Feed of my fading light
Take it your way, throw me out
Make me be your night
Show me how, all your way
Do it in the night
Tear me down, scare me straight
Just a piece of night

Share yourself with me
Share yourself with me

It's all in my mind, this fantasy I breed
Thoughts of you, turn to sweat
When you make me need
Threaten me with your light
And try to look at me
Hold me down and slap my pride
You won't forget this night

Drag me down, take me out
Make me see the light
Take it your way, throw me out
I feel you in the night
Trap me in, suck me dry
Your eyes become the light
Look at me, tell me how
To feel you in the light

Share yourself with me
Share yourself with me

Drag me down, take me out
Make me see the light
Share yourself with me
Take it your way
Make me be your night
Share yourself with me
Show me how
Do it in the night
Share yourself with me
