Face to face with adversity
We'll never back down
Our numbers grow before the dawn
Itt all comes around
Raise you hand and follow the call
Sacrifice for the flock
The music grows louder the closer we are
We'll never be stopped

We are the voice of the cult
And we will do all to survive
We are crusaders tonight
Yes, we are the voice of the cult

Feel the surge from within our crowd
The power is real
We will live forever ir seems
We bask in the zeal
We can't back down, we need your action
Forget the rules, forget what's fashion

We are the voice of the cult
And we will do all to survive
We are crusaders tonight
Yes, we are the voice of the cult

Raise your hand and follow the call
Sacrifice for the flock
The music grows better the closer we are
We'll never be stopped

We are the voice of the cult
And we will do all to survive
We are crusaders tonight
Yes, we are the voice of the cult

We are the voice
We are the voice

We are the voice
