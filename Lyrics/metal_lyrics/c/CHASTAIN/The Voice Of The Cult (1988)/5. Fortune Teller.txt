The tarot speaks the truth, so shall the runes
The oracle is truth, I shall face it soon

Tell me when does it end
Show me where to begin
Fortune teller

My time is in your hands
You can read it in your cards
My final resolve
Or who we rally are

Tell me when does it end
Show me where to begin
Fortune teller

Look in your crystal ball
Is it love or agony
What's the future hold
And where shall it lead

Tell me when does it end
Show me where to begin
Fortune teller
Fortune teller

Fortune teller
What's the future hold
Fortune teller
