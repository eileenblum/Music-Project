I hear your heartbeat within my dreams
I feel your passion and all your needs
I am not your slave, you can not believe
Pain and desire for infinity

Chains of love

I sense your hunger, born in lust
I fear your anger, hate and distrust
Call of the wild echoes around
I beg for mercy, none can be found

Cains of love
Hold me to you
Chains of love
No matter what you do

And our life it seems is like a battlefield
Two soldiers at war

I hear your heartbeat within my dreams
I feel your passion and all your needs
I am not your slave, you can not believe
Pain and desire for infinity

Cains of love
Hold me to you
Chains of love
No matter what you do
Chains of love

Cains of love
Hold me to you
Chains of love
No matter what you do

Chains of love
Chains of love
Pleasure and pain
For infinity
