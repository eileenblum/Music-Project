I fly across the desert sands
As my duty demands
The sun beats down with no remorse
I know the end's at hand

Evil for evil
There is no return
Evil for evil
Allah, I come to you

I'm proud to give my life for right
I shall forever be paid
My orders are precise and clear
Take all that are here

Evil for evil
There is no return
Evil for evil
Allah, I come to you

For I was chose to carry out the strike
This honor will be my final delight

I see the target straight ahead
It's what I shall destroy
I see the horror in their eyes
For we shall all die

Evil for evil
There is no return
Evil for evil
Allah, I come to you

For I was chose to carry out the strike
This honor will be my final delight

Evil for evil
There is no return
Evil for evil
Allah, I come to you
