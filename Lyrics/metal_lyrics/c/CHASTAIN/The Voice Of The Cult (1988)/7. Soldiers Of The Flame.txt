They blacken the night
They strengthen the fight
They're demons and gods to us all
Some call it an omen
Or a prayer that was stolen
From under the master's sight

They are soldiers of the flame
Beware, or you shall be the same

They hold their heads high
Make no time to cry
They're always aware of us all
They're looking to help you
While smiling to trick you
Offering you care when you fall

They are soldiers of the flame
Beware, or you shall be the same

They are soldiers of the flame
Beware, or you shall be the same

It's green in the summer
Yet brown in the winter
Like seasons they always revolve
Look out for the laughter
Behind every master
They seem to take part of us all

They are soldiers of the flame
Beware, or you shall be the same

Soldiers of the flame
Soldiers of the flame
They blacken the night
They strengthen the fight
Soldiers of the flame
