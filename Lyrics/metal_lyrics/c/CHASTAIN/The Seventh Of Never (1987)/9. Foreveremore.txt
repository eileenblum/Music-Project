We are the wind and the rain from above
We cast no shadows as we face the sun
In the morning I'll be there with you
We have conquered, the world is at our feet

We have the answers for all that we have ever dreamed
We will be forevermore

We watch the stars and touch the warmth that thay bring
We see the waters reflect all that it sees
We've seen the tears come from all around
They just dont know what it is we've found

We have the answers for all that we have ever dreamed
We will be forevermore

We will be as one for that's what we've become
And we will stand alone as far as time is known
Silence all around, peace is what we've found
We will be forevermore

We are the wind and the rain from above
We cast no shadows as we face the sun
In the morning I'll be there with you
We have conquered, the world is at our feet

We have the answers for all that we have ever dreamed
We will be forevermore
