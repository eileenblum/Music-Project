We'll be defiant
We'll do as we feel
We must carry on
No one can stop us
We're far, far too strong
We must carry on
We can't hear their empty words
We got the need and the nerves

Once in a lifetime
Passions run high
We must carry on
We've touched the heavens
Can't take second best
We must carry on
We don't care what they say
We don't need their senseless ways
We'll carry on
We got the world in our hand
Something they can't understand

We've seen the future
Our enemies shall fall
We must carry on
We have the strenght
The will and the drive
We must carry on
We got the world in our hand
Something they'll never, never understand
We must carry on
