There is a curse growing thru the land
It'll rule your body and your mind, that's the plan
Living a lie, it'll catch up to you
You better hold your ground before you're thru

Every day you lose a little more
You're slowly losing a deadly war
You better wake up, it's getting late

Paradise is not what it seems
Paradise, is just a bad dream

You've heard the reasons so many times
What are you searching for, what can you find
Can't you see you've fallen to the scourge
The numbers grow, what's it all for

Every day you lose a little more
Slowly losing a deadly war
You better wake up, it's getting late

Paradise is not what it seems
Paradise, is just a bad dream

No matter what, it's all in your hands
It's all you decision, you know that you can
There is a curse growing through the land
It'll rule your body and your mind, that's the plan

Every day you lose a little more
You're slowly losing a deadly war
You better wake up, it's getting late

Paradise is not what it seems
Paradise, is just a bad dream

It's just a bad dream
Paradise
Paradise
