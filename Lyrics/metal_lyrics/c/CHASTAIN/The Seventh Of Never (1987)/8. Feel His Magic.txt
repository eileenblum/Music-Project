He lives away alone, in a space no one has been
His wisdom is great, a gift, born from within
He knows all and sees everything
Feel his magic

He reads what you think and he knows just what you'll do
He's lived thru the years, he's changed all whom he knew
Wise men seek out his words
Feel his magic
Feel his magic

The stories he knows and the marvels that he has made
Miracles can be but there must always be a trade
The desperate call out his name
Feel his magic
Feel his magic

Miracles can be but there must be a trade
Feel his magic
