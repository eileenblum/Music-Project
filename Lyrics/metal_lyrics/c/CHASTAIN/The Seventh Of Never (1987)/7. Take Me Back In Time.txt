I've seen today but the reason's there no more
Tomorrow brings the same, something I can't ignore
All will return from all that we have learned
All that will be we shall never see
Take me back in time

I feel the anger I've seen the madness
I've felt the rain, we've all been the sadness
All will return from all that we've learned
All that will be we shall never see
Take me back in time

Look into the far light
For that's where all will be

I've seen today but the reason's there no more
Tomorrow brings the same, what I want is there before
All must return from all that we have learned
All that will be we will never see
Take me back in time

Take me back in time
Take me back in time

Back in time

Take me back in time
