I've told you all the things that nobody knows
This part of me is where you'll grow
No rest for you, a trial to see
They have come here with me

The wicked are restless, they're calling out for you
The wicked are restless, they have to have you

They've conquered my boundaries of firm disbelief
Stuck me to the wall, life's so brief
They smiled in waiting, offering a hand
They seem to know just where you stand

The wicked are watching, they're waiting just for you
The wicked are watching, they're planning for you

So stand tall
Don't take the fall
If you're against fate
The wicked wants one and all

You think you're ready to stand your own ground
They stalked you, your secrets they've found
Their power is endless, controlled by the sea
Now you will become me

The wicked are restless, thet're calling out for you
The wicked are restless, they want you, they rule
In the deep of the night they wil send for you
The wicked are restless, they have to have you
