We're resiliant, we'll defy
The evil cast upon us
We organize the strategy
For the force that we face
By the light we defend the right
We see the odds against us
The rise and grace of vicious thought
Must die within this place
We can't turn back, we'll hold our ground
Our mission is supreme
We'll find a way
For we shall purge the evil from the world

By the dawn, we feel the sun
Will guide us thru the combat
The battlefield is filled with troops
Of men of long ago
The sword is raised high, the cry is long
From a voice within the distance
Armaggedon, here at last
It is the final show
We'll never turn back, we'll hold our ground
Our mission is supreme
We'll find a way for we shall end
The world of their curse

The 7th of never, the 7th of never
We carry the torch for the future of the right
The 7th of never

The war to end all the wars
Must be brought before us
And what's at stake is far to great
To lose in disgrace
We will fade, if the need
Or the cause demends it
The rise and grace of vicious throught
Must die within this place
For the good shall reign from this day on
Our mission is supreme
We'll find a way
And we shall purge purge the evil from this world
