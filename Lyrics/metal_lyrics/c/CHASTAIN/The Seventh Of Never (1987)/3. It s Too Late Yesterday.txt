Damn the fates, sweet destiny is lost
There's no escape, we know the final cost
We've forever lost the light
To the stage of the past and it's ways

You can cry out and scream aloud but
It's too late for yesterday

And I'm filled with rage, the fire no longer burns
Helpless shame, there is no return
The long and dangerous road
Seems to take it's toll on us all

You can cry and scream aloud but
It's too late for yesterday

Damn the fates, sweet destiny is lost
There's no escape, we know the final cost
We've forever lost the light
To the stage of the past and it's ways

You can cry out and scream aloud but
It's too late for yesterday
