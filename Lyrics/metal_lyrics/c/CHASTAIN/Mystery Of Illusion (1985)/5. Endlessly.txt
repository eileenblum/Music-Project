Look through the haze
So far away
Another time, another place
But not today

Can't hide your feelings
I know your heart cries

Endlessly
Endlessly

Time to go
Tired of the games everyone plays
Look around
You're not the same

Can't hide your feelings
I know your heart cries

Endlessly
Endlessly

Stare in the mirror
Still hypnotized
Looking for the answer
So deep inside

Can't hide your feelings
I know your heart cries

Endlessly
Endlessly

Endlessly [3x]
