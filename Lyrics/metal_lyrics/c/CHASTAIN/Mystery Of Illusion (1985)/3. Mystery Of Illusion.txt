Save me, from all the lies
Take me. Please free my mind
Beside me. Please guide me
Inside me, lost my mind!
Sweet mystery of illusion
Light blinds us one and all
Enslaved in passions freedom
A door becomes a wall

[Chorus:]
Mystery of illusion
Illusions of your mind

The end is just beginning
When night transforms to day
From alpha to omega,
It's really all the same

[Chorus]

Seems like yesterday is just tomorrow
Sometimes it seems tomorrow is just today

A vicious circle closes
Machine becomes a mind
Desolation's paradise,
The truth is just a lie

[Chorus]
