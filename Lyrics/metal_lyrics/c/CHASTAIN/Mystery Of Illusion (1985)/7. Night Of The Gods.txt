See the light in the sky
All is over
Good and evil face to face
Its forever
A chance for peace a chance for life
It's now or never
Face the fact there
Is no escape it's Armageddon

[Chorus:]
The night of the gods
The night of the gods
The warnings call out the message is clear
You better take it to heart
The night of gods

Look away into the void
The way is clear
Sense the danger on the way
The fear is peal
Count the hours just count the days
The time is near
Forget your dreams and forget yesterday
It's Armageddon

[Chorus]
[Verse 1]
[Chorus]
