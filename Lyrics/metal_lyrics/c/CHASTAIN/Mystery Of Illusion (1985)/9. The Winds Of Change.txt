There's a smell in the air
Of fire and rain
And the devil's
Coming for you again
The moon has turned red
It's over your head
The stars have fallen before
For now there is a way
And there is a time
Now there is a place, for you

There's a woman alone
In a castle of stone
She's a siren calling for you
She lives on the mountain
It's a cold black mountain
The place that was hell for you
But now you have direction
Now you have a sign
Now there is a reason, for you

It's time to ride the winds of change
A path that you must follow
Ride the winds of change
Now it's time to ride to nevermore
Now it's time to fly to nevermore

[Verse 1]

Now is the time to ride
The winds of change
