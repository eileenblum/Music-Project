The garden of Eden has faded away
A paradise turned hell
The moon is bright
Yes, it's a holy sight
We sense the darkness spell
We shall overcome

In the east well before the light
We all feel the chill
In the west and before the night
All the earth stood still

[Bridge:]
Close your eyes to the nightmare
Turn your thoughts up to the sky
Keep your faith in tomorrow

[Chorus:]
We shall overcome
We shall over come

Don't fear the fight
It's time to face the thunders power
You know we're right
We gotta take the journey onward

[Verse 1]
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
