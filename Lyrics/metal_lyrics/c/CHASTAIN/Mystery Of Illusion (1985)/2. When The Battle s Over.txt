Looking for gold
In the face of the night
We're all driven by passion

Darkness surrounds
What a horrible light
Can't face distraction

Over and over and over again
I hear the reason
Guilty as charged without a trial
Paramount to treason

When the battle's over
I'll have my peace of mind
When the battle's over
It'll be forever

The agony of difference and hate
Let's all jump to fragment [?]
The only heaven and the only hell
We arise with nothing

Rapture of laughter
And sense the pain
We've touched eternity
Prisoner of time within his sphere
They sail the endless seas

When the battle's over
I'll have my peace of mind
When the battle's over
It'll be forever [x2]

Looking for gold
In the face of the night
We're all driven by passion

Darkness surrounds
What a horrible light
Can't face distraction

Over and over and over again
I hear the reason
Guilty as charged without a trial
Paramount to treason

When the battle's over
I'll have my peace of mind
When the battle's over
It'll be forever [x2] Â 

When the battle's over [x2]

Face of the night, I'll hold the light
It'll be forever
