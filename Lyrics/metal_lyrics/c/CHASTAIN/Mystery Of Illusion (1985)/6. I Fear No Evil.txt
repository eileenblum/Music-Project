I hear your thoughts
I hear your taunts
I'm laughing in your face
You're talking tough
You're talking strong
You will be disgraced
'Cause I'm the power and I'm the force
You I will erase
And I'm the omen of your fall
And all of your race
I fear no evil, I fear no evil

I'm illusive and out of sight
I'm five miles high
I feel no pain or no remorse
I'm safe up in the sky
I'm in command, I call the shots
The misery will fly
Yes I am invincible and I will never die
I fear no evil, I fear no evil

The time for talk has come and gone
I'm calling out your bluff
You have no nerve I think
You know you've seemed to have enough
'Cause I'm the power and I'm the force
You I will erase
And I'm the omen of your fall
And all your race
I fear no evil, I fear no evil
