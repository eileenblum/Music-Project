I've seen fate and more again
I know who loses and I know who wins
I see the places
And things that aren't even there
I know the future of all
I've seen tomorrow

I see the wars that are set in time
The quatrans of doom within my mind
I know the day that will spell out our end
I know the future of all
I've seen tomorrow

I've seen the tyrants
That have ruled the world
On the horizons
The worse shall come

His reign of terror will last far too long
I know the future of all
I've seen tomorrow
