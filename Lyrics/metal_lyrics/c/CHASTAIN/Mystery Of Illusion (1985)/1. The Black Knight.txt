The queen lives for the head of the king
She plans his fall within her dreams
The sorcerer sees to the power she needs
The soldier of fortune arrives for the deed

[Chorus:]
The black knight, rides for the queen
The black knight

He seizes the anger,
He breeds forth the light
Blind ambition is all in his sight
The price is high, forever or more
It's now or never, to equal the score

[Chorus]

Tears of joy, tears of relief
The battles over, there's no time for grief
He will return for his spoils
The queen is his, she will be loyal

[Chorus]
[Verse 1]
[Chorus]
