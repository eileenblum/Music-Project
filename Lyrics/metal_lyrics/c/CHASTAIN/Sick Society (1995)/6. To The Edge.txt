Take me from this earth
To where you roam
I never wanted
To be left alone
But then you took your life
Away from me
I never wanted
But that's what to be
Oh, tell me why

I've searched the rainbows
I've looked inside
I've travelled many miles
Since your suicide
I remember all the things
That we planned for
I never once dreamed
You'd be no more

Was it so bad
The life we had
Tell me why
You took me to the edge
You took me to the edge

Was it so bad
The life we had
Tell me why
You took me to the edge

Take me from this earth
To where you roam
I never wanted
To be left alone
But then you took your life
Away from me
I never wanted
This way to be

Was it so bad
The life we had
Tell me why
You took me to the edge
I never said goodbye
Oh, tell me why
Why did you take your life

Goodbye
