I know the darkness
I know the darkness

I feel so cold, it has begun
I really know, who is the one
No one cares, no one believes
What can be fair, take what you need

I know the darkness
I know it well
I know the darkness
It's a private hell

I sense the love, I call the name
I try to learn, I fight the blame
Take my thoughts, take my regret
Who is the king, collect your debt

I can see, I can see

I know the darkness
I know it well
I know the darkness
It's a private hell

I hide the plan, I play the fool
I count the time, until the rule
Take my fears, take my home
Just don't leave me here, I can't be alone

I know the darkness
I know it well
I know the darkness
It's a private hell

I count the time

I know the darkness
I know it well
I know the darkness
It's a private hell

Private hell
