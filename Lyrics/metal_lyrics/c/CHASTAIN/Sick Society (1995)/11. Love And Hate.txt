I feel so alive
You've got me feeling satisfied
You're saying something
You'd like to see me
On my knees for you
(wouldn't you?)
Love and hate
Love and hate

You manifest the pain
I welcome it in vein
You're up to something
But I can't believe
That your intentions
Could never be true
(but I don't care)
Love and hate
Love and hate

I hate to love you still
I'd burn for you in hell
You give me fever
In the third degree
You've got the only
Cure for my disease
(I want you)
Love and hate
Love and hate

You've got me feeling satisfied
Love and hate
Love and hate
