She feels a presence in her soul
Drawing ever nearer
A voiceless calling
Through the night
Is becoming clearer
A touch of madness fills the air
And she hears the message
A sense of danger with a fear
And a spell controls her now

She wants to taste, burning desire
She's giving blood for the vampire

A shadow fell into the rom
Silence came upon her
Seduction burned in chemistry
And a passion drew her
Closer to forever dreams
In the eyes of danger
Temptation went to the extremes
Of an unrelenting night

She wants to taste, burning desire
She's giving blood for the vampire

Starving for another fix
Thoughts of blood evolve her
A victim of eternal greed
Living for the slaughter
Their love will burn forevermore
With the darkest of passion
Until she sees the rising sun
In the coldness of his soul

She wants to taste, burning desire
She's giving blood for the vampire

You can hear her through the night
How she cries
