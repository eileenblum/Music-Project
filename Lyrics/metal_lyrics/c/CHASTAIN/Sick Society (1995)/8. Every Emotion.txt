In a crowded room I sit alone
And think about you, why I don't know
What has come over me, why do I feel this way
The distance brings me closer, when you're away
I can't forget your face

What's your condition for letting go
I want to look inside the window to your soul
Come in fror the cold, your secret's safe and warm
No need to hide from emotions anymore
It's in your eyes
You can't disguise your every emotion

I know we share the same desire
Let's walk through life
Whath no regrets of what it might have benn
Cause time can never change how much I care
When it's so strong

You went away and left me here alone
There's so much pain, I'm learning to let go
Still in the dark I never knew
The reasons why I still think of you

Every emotion leads me back to you
Every emotion, no matter what I do
Listen to me, am I getting through
Every emotion, every emotion, leads me back to you
Oh every, every emotion

Heard through frinds you're asking how I've been
I never let it show, I've been doing time
Trying to find you everywhere we used to go

What can I say, what can I do
I haven't gotten over you
You're still inside my soul
I don't know why
I can't erase you from my mind
Oh why can't I just let goï¿½

In a crowded room I sit alone
Think about you, why I don't know
"Hello, how have you been?"
You turn and walk away
I guess there's nothing more to say
