Little miss divine, she's on th eroad to ruin
Searching for a love to clear her clouded mind
Through the smoke she dreamed there was no disillusion
On the beaten path she found an uphill climb

So she spread her wings for a lover to hold
But she came up empty handed and cold
Hell's a heaven that never calls
Dancing with danger angel falls

Kneeling  at the altar praying for salvation
Longing for the answer but there was no sign
In the eyes of lust she sacrificed redemption
Secular emotions bled her dry

So she sold her soul for a lover
She the highway to a burning city
Hell's a heaven that never calls
Dancing with danger angel falls
Angel falls

No tragedy is too unjust
Deceit is blind in spoken trust
The liar waits to pull you in
And so you go through hell again..and again

So say your prayers for life to keep
There's not much time before you sleep
It's getting deeper in the game
And flesh won't help to ease you pain...when it's too late

Sympathy is nothingness inside a sentence
Given without warning, it's time to die
Mercy's not familiar with the plague of ages
Lost within a vengeance, she took to flight

And she spread her wings for a lover to hold
But they came up empty handed and cold
Hell's a heaven that never calls
Dancing with danger angel falls
Angel falls
When you play with fire, be prepared to burn
You know you'll never, ever learn

Angel falls
