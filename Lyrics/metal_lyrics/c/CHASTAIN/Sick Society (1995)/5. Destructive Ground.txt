Who died and made you god to tell me what I should do
How I choose to live my life is not up to you
What you need is a dosage of reality
Get the axe, I need to gain my sanity

Only one solution, it's coming down
Gonna dig your own grave on destructive ground

When were you resurrected, you know it all
Selling fear to shock the weak is not control
Of somethng you know nothng of
So don't pretend, you can justify the means, until the end

Only one solution, it's coming down
Gonna dig your own grave on destructive ground

Fear of death tears at your soul
In this life, you'll never know

You can have your empty words
High upon your throne
Praying on the agony of the unknown
When you wallow in misery, it's such a shame
Wasted thought will never solve the mystery

Only one solution, it's coming down
Gonna dig your grave on destructive ground

Dig yourself an early grave
Worry your whole life away
Listen, destructive ground
