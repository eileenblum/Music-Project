Well, I'm standing at the station
Got my suitcase in my hand
It's too bad, couldn't think of a solution
For the problems that we had
It's so sad
Still life goes on, but the good times remain
And I'll never forget
Those were the daze
Those were the daze

No, I won't forget the laughter in the middle of the night
It felt so right, how we lived for every moment
Till we saw the morning light and I held you tight
Why does love slip away when you want it to stay
Well, the all you can say is
Those were the daze
Those were the daze

So sad to say, sometimes things work out that way

No, I can't find the reasons that my heart is holding on
But I can't break the memory that you left in my soul

I know I've got to move on, I'm moving on
Gonna hitch a ride to new roads, find a life out on my own
All by myself now, life will go on and I'll find someone new
To forget about you
Those were the daze
Those were the daze
Those were the daze

Those were the daze
