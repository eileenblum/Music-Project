Take me home, once again
Don't know where that I've been
I've seen blood and I've seen hate
I've seen death, face to face

The price of war
The price of war

I can see when I sleep
Things no one should ever keep
I've seen life, stole away
I've seen pain, most every day

The price of war
The price of war

How many more must die?
The price of war

I recall genocide
I have seen children die
I've seen blood and I've seen hate
I've seen death, face to face

The price of war
The price of war

How many more must die?

What is it all for?
