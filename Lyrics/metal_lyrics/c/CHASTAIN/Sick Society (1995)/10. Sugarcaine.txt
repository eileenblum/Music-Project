Seven after midnight, smoked her last cigarette
She is waiting on a stranger, paying off a debt

She's giving blood for a little life of her own
You know to ease that pain

She gets high on Sugarcaine
She confides in Sugarcaine

Now she's got a little problem leaving well enough alone
Blinded by a feeling when she falls for mr. Jones,

Dealing with addiction
Giving herself away for some more
And it's on in the same

She gets high on Sugarcaine
She confides in Sugarcaine

Now don't even try to tell her 'cause she's heard it all before
Gonna come to the conclusion when her body hits the floor

She knows she's only got herself to blame
So it's O.K., it's O.K.

She gets high on Sugarcaine
She confides in Sugarcaine
She gets high on Sugarcaine
Shes gonna die on Sugarcaine
Sugarcaine
