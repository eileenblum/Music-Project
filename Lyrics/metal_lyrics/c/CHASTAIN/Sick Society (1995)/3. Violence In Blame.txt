Hey mother, why don't you tell the truth
Your sugar coated cande is turning black and blue
The silver linings faded, why don't you feel the rain
When it's coming down all around you turn and walk away
The sun don't shine when it's time for violence and blame

Hey father, why don't you sayt a word
The silence isn't fair when I'm trying to be heard
You listened to me screaming and said I'd have to pay
The price if I should tell a soul what you did to me
The sun don't shine when it's time for violence in blame
Your violence in blame

Time changes and I'm on my own
I've learned to hide the feelings I face when I'm alone
Still fighting for the reasons, I keep them locked away
But every time I look inside, these skeletons escape
The sun don't shine when it's time for violence in blame
Your violence in blame

Where were you, too late for you now
The ties have all but faded, the flowers wilt away
And all is said forgiven for your violence in blame
