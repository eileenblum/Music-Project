You van't walk the streets at night
You better lock your doors
You better look in the shadows
It's not safe no more
You see it on the tv news
How many killed today
The numbers grow, it's out of hand
It's time they got to pay

Sick society
Sick society

You can't trust a smiling face
They'll kill you with their greed
The dollar rules the criminal mind
No matter what your needs
You see them drop one by one
You wonder if you're next
All we're taught throughout our life
Better violence than sex

Sick society
Sick society

For any life that they take
Commits a war of rage
That we all got to pay

A vigilante is not a bad idea
It's time to settle the scores
The prison walls have overflowed
It's time we won this war
There's no question what will change the game
You can't leave a doubt
No parole for violent crimes
It's one strike, you're out

Sick society
Sick society
It's a sick society
There ain't nowhere, where you're ever safe
Sick society
