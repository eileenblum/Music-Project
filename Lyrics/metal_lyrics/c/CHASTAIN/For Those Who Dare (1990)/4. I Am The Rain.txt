[Music: David T. Chastain, Lyrics: Leather Leone] Â 

They write the books, they set the rule
They say do this to get somewhere
I'm still here
We choose this life, let's face their pack
We've got a strength that they can't see
We all believe

[Chorus:]
I feel your pain
I am the rain

You look at me, I look at you
We are the same
Just a different name
Your circle may not ever be unbroken, but who cares
Just be aware

I feel your pain
I am the rain

We have the time, I know the way
Push ahead and follow me, let it be
The place is now, the wind is yours
To get what you deserve, find the nerve

I feel your pain
I am the rain

I'm the rain, rain, rain...
I feel your pain...
I am the rain!
