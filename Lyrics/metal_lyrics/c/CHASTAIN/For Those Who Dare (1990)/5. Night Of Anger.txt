[Music &amp; Lyrics: David T. Chastain]

We wait for the dawn, it can't be too long
Our freedom awaits at the battle
We might not return, but we must serve our turn
For our cause must change this injustice
It's the night, it's the night, the night of anger

As I look into the distance, I see another world
A world I cannot be, unless I kill the foe
We try to change their ways, but they turn their backs on us
They've put us down by tyranny, they've put us down by death
But now the time has come, we are silent for no more
It's now or never step aside, I want my dignity

Night of anger, set us free
Night of anger, give us all we need

For I deserve to be equal, in the eyes of the law
And I deserve a life, like the ones that I saw
A right to vote, a right to speak, as decency declares
Listen to my voice, our plight is too much to bear

We are the pain of the masses
We are the cries of chance
We are the wave of the future
The night of anger

We are the pain of the masses
We are the cries of chance
We are the wave of the future
The night of anger

We know the time will come, as the war has begun
But the cost of it all will be forgiven

It's the night, it's the night, the night of anger

Night of anger, set us free
Night of anger, give us all we need

The night of anger
It's the price of your freedom
We'll live, we'll be and we'll see
We shall all believe in
The night of anger
