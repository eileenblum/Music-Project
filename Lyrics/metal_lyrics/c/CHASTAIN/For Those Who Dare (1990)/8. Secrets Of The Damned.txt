[Music &amp; Lyrics: David T. Chastain]

Born in blood, thru the ages, the mystery lives on
The power thrives, or so it seems
In the minds of the weak

Secrets of the damned

Don't let them in, it's mind control
You needn't answer their call
Just walk away, they have no redemption
There's nothing there at all

Secrets of the damned
Secrets of the damned

They speak of love, but act with hate
In the name of their gods
Societies are penalized, from ideas lost in time

Secrets of the damned

Fairy tales and devil stories litter the heart of man
Well intentions are thrown away, reality they can't understand

Secrets of the damned
Secrets of the damned

Holy wars throughout the years, tell me when will they end
Reason is out of the question, they're all blind within

Secrets of the damned

Speak your thoughts, at high risk, fanatics lie in wait
Hopefully, they'll realize, life is what they make

Secrets of the damned
Secrets of the damned
