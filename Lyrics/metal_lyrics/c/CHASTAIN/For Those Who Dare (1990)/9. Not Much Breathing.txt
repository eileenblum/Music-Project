[Music: David T. Chastain, Lyrics: Leather Leone]

You are a liar
But I'm still inspired
Not much happening here
Not much breathing
Can you tell me why we're far away

Your line is repeating
You kept us there by here
Not much happening here
Not much breathing
Can you tell me why we're far away

I was screaming
While you kept me dreaming
Not much happening here
Not much breathing
Can you tell me why we're far away
Why we're far away

I'm still inspired!!!
