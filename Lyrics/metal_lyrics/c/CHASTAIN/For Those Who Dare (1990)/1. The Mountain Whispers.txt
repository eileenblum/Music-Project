[Music: David T. Chastain, Lyrics: Leather Leone]

No one told me it was easy
But the wall I built was too high
Another nature falls around us ...helpless
I've been living just for myself, not aware
There was another
Please stop and look around

The Mountain Whispers
Said I don't know
The Mountain Whispers
But I don't listen
I don't listen

Everyday our path continues, where it leads is always changing
Any can't we help her get it right
No one told me is was easy, but we all can
Stop this madness
Aghhhh!!!

The Mountain Whispers
Said I don't know
The Mountain Whispers
But I don't listen

It's all around us
Coming right at you
It's finally found us
What to do

It's all around us
Coming right at you
It's finally found us
What to do

Seems like we want the wrong things
Asking for what may not matter
We must see before we lose
Yeah, life asks us many questions, will we ever want the answer
It's not go forward aimlessly

The Mountain Whispers
Said I don't know
The Mountain Whispers
But I don't listen

I don't listen...
Why don't we
The Mountain Whispers
But I say that I don't know
The Mountain Whispers
But I don't listen
No!!!
