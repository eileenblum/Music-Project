[Music &amp; Lyrics: David T. Chastain]

I feel their eyes staring hopelessly
Saying goodbye to tomorrow
You hear them cry and you hear them scream
Please set us free

Outer space for the master race
Tell me what good does that do you or
I high ideals but what is real
Can't you hear, hear the children cry

[Chorus:]
Save me, hold me, take me to your life
Free me, seize me, do the thing that's right
So you think your world goes down, down thru the ages
Face me, help me, please set us free

Another gun, is it that much fun
When are you gonna get that chip off your shoulder
Worldwide so we tried
Hunger kills, and that's been told her (she says)

Save me, hold me, take me to your life
Free me, seize me, do the thing that's right
So you think your world goes down, down thru the ages
Face me, help me, please set us free

Genocide, suicide, hate is growing deep inside
We see your money going down the drain
Can you feel, death is real, you seem to think is no big deal
You act like it's not your blame

Please set us free
Please set us free

Please set us free
Please set us free

Reach into your heart, you can help save the day
Maybe soon good things will come your way
Just remember, it's up to you and I
Speak your mind and change things what you may

Save me, hold me, take me to your life
Free me, seize me, do the thing that's right
So you think your world goes down, down thru the ages
Face me, help me, please set us free

Please set us free
Please set us free
