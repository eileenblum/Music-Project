[Music &amp; Lyrics: David T. Chastain]

The morning cries a lonely song, for something that's real
A look around, a trail of tears, the emptiness she feels
I close my eyes, I move away, and I hear the silence of my thoughts
You're the light in the dark
You're the light in the dark

As the world comes, down upon me, I look for relief
I don't know just what to turn to, to escape this grief
Hear the voices scream too loud, and the wicked pace
You run for cover, run for safety, I gotta have my space

You're the light in the dark
That's what you mean to me
You're the light in the dark
When it's time for me to be

Thunder, is all around, you got to stand clear
Turbulence is all about you, you gotta face that fear
You call for help, warning of madness, a day in the life
Hypocrisy so angrily, it's all part of the strife

You're the light in the dark
That's what you mean to me
You're the light in the dark
When it's time for me to be

Night then day, day and night, yes it all is the same
Cautiously, a parody, it's part of the blame
After all, you needn't fight, try just a little peace
So is life, and all of its glory, you can't tame that beast!

You're the light in the dark
That's what you mean to me
You're the light in the dark
When it's time for me to be

You're the light in the dark
That's what you mean to me
You're the light in the dark
When it's time for me to be
