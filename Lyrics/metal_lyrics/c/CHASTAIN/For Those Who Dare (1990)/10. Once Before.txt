[Music: David T. Chastain, Lyrics: Leather Leone]

Sometimes we're tested, my time came now
Out of nowhere, recalling all my doubt
In your presence I question my voice
Knowing inside of us there's more than one voice

Take me, tell me, we've gone
Through this play
It's because of your being I feel this way
We've been here once before

I don't like to falter, or feel close to fail
In facing you we can tell there's no tale
In my mind your destined to stay
A vision that's inside of me now yours to betray

Take me, tell me, we've gone
Through this play
It's because of your being I feel this way
We've been here once before

Does this connection make way to you
And if it does what path shall we choose

Take me, tell me, we've gone
Through this play
It's because of your being I feel this way
We've been here once before

I've been a part of you before
I know you, I feel you
Once before

Once before... I knew you
Once before... I felt you

Once before!!!
