[Music &amp; Lyrics: David T. Chastain] Â 

Strike out! Move forward
It's all there for you and I
Don't listen to your own doubt
Just think of what's you own prize

[Chorus:]
Carry on to your heaven
Carry on thru the end
It's all for those who dare

Fight that fight with true meaning
You gotta take a chance now and then
You have to seek just what you're after
Before it will happen

Carry on to your heaven
Carry on thru the end
It's all for those who dare
For those who dare

Do you dare?

There may be no tomorrows
There may be no todays
So don't you wait till much longer.. no!
The world is here not far away

Carry on to your heaven
Carry on thru the end
It's all for those who dare
For those who dare

You gotta take a chance now
Take your chance then
Yeah, you gotta dare
It's all for those who dare
