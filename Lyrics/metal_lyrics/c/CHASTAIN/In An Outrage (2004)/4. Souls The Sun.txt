I knew a man who was a visionary man I'd say
A true philosopher who lived his life a different way
Ha asked me if I understood what makes everyone of us alive
And if I ever thought about what happens after life

In pieces everything returns, and lives again
What if we knew, our souls the Sun
All energies were once as one, yeah, yeah

And everything he said made sense
Now listen...
If we thought of it collectively
Would we judge at sight unseen
With the knowledge all we feared
Was cut from the same cloth

If no division separates where we comes from
What if we knew, our souls the Sun
All energies were once as one, yeah, yeah

Holy war and destruction, there's so much corruption
And everyone's fighting for something to say
Torture and hatred and all for the sake of you
Don't see it my way? Well, then you're going to bleed
I'll make you see everything like you've never before
They hate with a passion ingrained and regret when alone
So alone

What if we knew, our souls the Sun
All energies were once as one
