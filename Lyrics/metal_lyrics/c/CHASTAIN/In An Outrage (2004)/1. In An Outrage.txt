I wanna thank you
For your inspiration
You've made me stronger
Through intimidation
Survivor till the end
And we never give up

In an outrage, in an outrage

I can't believe it, so hypocritical
Their insignificance
Sufficing this control
Don't tell us how to live
Or what we should do
Gonna live our lives our way
And you'll live yours for you

It's a crime
They know not what they do

In an outrage, in an outrage
What the hell is going on
In an outrage, in an outrage

We the people
United we stand
Divided we fall

In an outrage, in an outrage
What the hell is going on
In an outrage, in an outrage

We the people
United we stand
Divided we fall

In an outrage, in an outrage
