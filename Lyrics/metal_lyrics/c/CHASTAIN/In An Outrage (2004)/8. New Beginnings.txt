So much weighing on my mind
Bitter love was so unkind
Left it all without a dime
But still I'm richer now

Lived a life within a lie
Everyday I thought I'd die
So much stress within my mind, I was pretending
Still I learned a lesson though
When you lose you come to know
To release and feel the flow, always remember

New beginnings that's the way, the way life is
Every ending always comes to new beginnings

There's nothing you can't overcome
What you think is tragic is null
It's for one, and one is you, and you can take it
No one's got an easy ride
Endings are a way of life
So just keep your dreams alive
Yeah, you can make it

When it all goes wrong, you've got to know
It's a lesson learned along the way

New beginnings that's the way, the way life is
Every ending always comes to new beginnings

One day you'll find you're out of time
So live life with no regrets
It's all inside, defend what's right
Make the most of your trip

Don't be afraid of change
No!! No!! No!!
No!! No!! No!!

New beginnings that's the way, the way life is
Every ending must conclude to new beginnings
New beginnings that's the way, the way life is
Every ending always comes to new beginnings
