Still caught up in the mystery you are
Don't want to go there, but my mind just takes me
Back to all those things you said
The time still frozen in my head

Save me from the cold, I don't want to know
Why you got to be that way

You shut me out, and you never said a word
We had a good thing, but you never fought for
Any cause you spoke of then
You shot me looks of such regret

Make it go away
I'm still wondering

Me and my tortured love
Don't want to think about it but I do
Me and my tortured love
Don't want to hold on but I can't let go

Still feeling this pain, like love has never died
It's unresolved, the question in my mind

Me and my tortured love
Don't want to hold on but I can't let go
Why you got to be that way

Another player in your game
I don't know, are we all the same
Just one of many you betrayed
Are you so heartless, I can't see

Where your story ends
Where do I begin

Me and my tortured love
Don't want to think about it but I do

Me and my tortured love
Don't want to hold on but I can't let go

I want to hear you say
You never cared baby, tell me

Me and my tortured love
