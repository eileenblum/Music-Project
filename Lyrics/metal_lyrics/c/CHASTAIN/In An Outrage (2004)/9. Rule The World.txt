It's all there, can't you see
You can be all that you want to be
You can have it all, you can rule the world
Just believe, in you, you can rule the world

When I look in your eyes
I can see that you're there but your light has faded
It's like you've drifted into the distance
Still I know who you are, and you've never lost a fight
So why are you waiting, don't let life pass you by

Say you don't know, what you're doing
With your money and your time spent
If you don't know what you're doing
Then you're doing something wrong, babe
Live it! You rule the world

You can have it all, you can rule the world
Just believe in you, you can rule the world
You can have it all, you can rule the world
Just believe in you, you can rule the world
You rule the world, you rule the world

Take a look to your mind, can you feel the pressure build
Just like a weapon, ready to explode
One moment in time, you can change your fate while you've got the chance
Life is for living, the music's playing, dance

Say you don't know, what you're doing
With your money and your time spent
If you don't know what you're doing
Then you're doing something wrong, babe

You can have it all, you can rule the world
Just believe in you, you can rule the world
You can have it all, you can rule the world
Just believe in you, you can rule the world

On and on it goes, time is passing by so
Why not grab it by the balls
Don't procrastinate, life is what you create
Fill your glass before the big empty
You'll find, you try, you may or may not know
Don't wait, too late, right now is the time to go
Now is your time to go, come on, let's go!

You can have it all, you can rule the world
Just believe in you, you can rule the world
You can have it all, you can rule the world
Just believe in you, you can rule the world
