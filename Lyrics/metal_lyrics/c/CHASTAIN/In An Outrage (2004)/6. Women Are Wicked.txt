You think you know me
Well you don't know me at all
Let me tell you

Why do you treat me like I'm dumb
When I'm the one who makes you come
Over and over, fill me up
I'm so empty, it's what you want it seems
You can laugh at me
But I'll have the final word, you see

Cause we're all the same, forced to play that game
Going to have our way, whatever it takes

Women are women are women are wicked
Women are women are women are wicked
Women are women are women are wicked
Women are women are women are wicked
A little evil goes a long way

I'll let you think that I'm your fool
But you don't know I'm fooling you
You made me this way
What more can you say, it's true

The nature of the beast, wise to say the least
That's the price you pay, man, you better pray

Women are women are women are wicked
Women are women are women are wicked
Women are women are women are wicked
Women are women are women are wicked

Women are women are women are wicked
Women are women are women are wicked
Women are women are women are wicked
Women are women are women are wicked

Come on, you know you want it
