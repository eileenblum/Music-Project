You better get out of my way!

Got to feel the power
Nothing else can come between
That adrenaline rush
Getting higher when I speed

In gear, all clear, here I come
Like a bullet from a gun

Like a locomotive
At terminal velocity
Never lose direction
And my engines running clean

No tears, no fears, not a one
Like a bullet from a gun

Here I come like a bullet from a gun
Here I come, get outta my way

Stop for no one, till I'm done
Like a bullet from a gun
Like a bullet from a gun
Like a bullet from a gun

You better get out of my way!
