Forbidden love, relentless hope
Karma connects between the souls
Broken in pieces, time unfolds
Torture for love is beautiful
Lost to the slaves, that we've become
Two souls divided by the sun
Still one deception shines alone
While this city burns beneath us

Hamunaptra
Hamunaptra

Imprisoned hell, it separates
Suspicions won't annihilate
This well's emotion flowing full
When nothing matters anymore
And in these dreams we are complete
The way a fantasy should be
But all realities go wrong
Life kills the loves conception

And nothing can bring it back again
No, forever searching for an end

Hamunaptra
Hamunaptra

Hamunaptra
Hamunaptra
Hamunaptra
Hamunaptra

In Hamunaptra yeah
The city of the dead

Resurrect the love you gave me
It's the only way we can
Where a moments lives forever
In the city of the dead

In Hamunaptra yeah
In Hamunaptra yeah
In Hamunaptra
