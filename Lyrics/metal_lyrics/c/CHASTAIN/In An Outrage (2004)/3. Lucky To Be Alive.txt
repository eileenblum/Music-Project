Suicidal tendencies seems a passion for pity's the disease
Wake the dead, inform them, cause they haven't got a clue
Get a life, stand up man and fight that fight
Without hesitation the time that you're wasting
Will have its way with you

If you can taste it, you touch it, you want it, you get it
You're lucky, lucky to be alive
Consider yourself lucky, lucky to be alive
You are

What are you thinking
You've got so much, the things that people are killing for
Take it for granted when it's all in front of you
You got to think it higher, take a look around you now

Hear it, your breathing, you're feeling fortunate
You're lucky, lucky to be alive
Consider yourself lucky, lucky to be alive

There is a purpose for this
Learn from what you missed
Don't wish it away
Just be thankful for one more day

Hey, you can just sit there
Or you can do something about it right now, come on
Cause it's all a state of mind, so get off your ass and fight
You're in control, you know your fate is up to you
Just one chance, and it may never come again
Make no hesitations, the time that you're wasting
Will have its was with you

And you can face it, embrace it, cause life's what you make it

You are lucky, lucky to be alive
Consider yourself lucky, lucky to be alive
You are
Consider yourself lucky, lucky to be alive

Lucky
