Lying, cheating these fair weathered friends
Trusted killers of the faithful, I opened up to you
And I believed your every word, you seemed to care
You seemed to care so sickly
I know you know what you did to me
Thoughtless actions covering your tracks at every turn
You played your games, I count the cost
Now pigs, get back in your trough

BACK OFF - you better beware
BACK OFF - I'm warning you
BACK OFF - cause now I don't care
BACK OFF - malicious pigs

Watching, waiting you know who you are
Guilty saviors always right and justified when wrong
I can't believe the things you do, how do you live
How do you live with yourself
After all this do you wonder why
Life's do faceless, time won't heal the wounds that you forget
Out of my face with your abuse
You've burnt me down to the fuse

BACK OFF - you better beware
BACK OFF - I'm warning you
BACK OFF - cause now I don't care
BACK OFF - malicious pigs

And now I know, it wasn't me
Malicious pigs, they never see,
You better beware, I'm warning you,
Cause now I don't care
Malicious pigs

BACK OFF - you better beware
BACK OFF - I'm warning you
BACK OFF - cause now I don't care
BACK OFF - malicious pigs
BACK OFF - you better beware
BACK OFF - I'm warning you
BACK OFF - cause now I don't care
BACK OFF - malicious pigs

Malicious pigs
Malicious pigs
They never see, there's no remorse for you or me
Malicious pigs
When they're around they only wanna bring you down
Malicious pigs
Malicious

Malicious pigs
