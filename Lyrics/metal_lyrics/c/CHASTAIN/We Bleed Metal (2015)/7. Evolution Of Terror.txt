My eyes have seen the glory of nations and their downfall
My eyes have seen lost messiahs and their angels call
I know the mourning... I know the end
Evolution of Terror, It rules the fools
Evolution of Terror, Bid your farewells
I know the reasons for disaster and despair
I know the reasons for a place that no one cares
I know the mourning... I know the end
Evolution of Terror, It rules the fools
Evolution of Terror, Bid your farewells 
I..... know the mourning... I..... know the end
I..... know the mourning... I..... know the end
I have screamed a warning for anyone who'll hear
I have screamed a warning true evil has appeared
Evolution of Terror, It rules the fools
Evolution of Terror, Bid your farewells 
I know the mourning... I know the end
Evolution of Terror, It rules the fools
Evolution of Terror, Bid your farewells
Evolution of Terror
It rules the world
Evolution....Evolution of Terror
I know the mourning... I know the end
