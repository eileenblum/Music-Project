I heard the early warnings, I heard the prophets call
I heard the final broadcast, Of our fall
I heard the silent screaming, I heard the anger sing
I heard the last beginning, Of what it brings
We Are The Last Ones Alive
We Are The Last Ones Alive
I saw the night sky lighten
The daylight long
I saw the last horizon
Before the dawn
We Are The Last Ones Alive
We Are The Last Ones Alive
I saw the bodies glisten
The blood run free
I saw the daybreak crying
One last plea
We Are The Last Ones Alive
We Are The Last Ones Alive
We Are The Last Ones Alive
We Are The Last Ones Alive
I look into the heavens
Behind the veil
I look beyond the angels
Straight into hell
We Are The Last Ones Alive
We Are The Last Ones Alive
Raise Your Hands High, For The resistance
Raise Your Hands High, Our Final Chance
We Are, You are, We Are, The Last Ones Alive Behind the veil, Straight into hell
We Are The Last Ones Alive
