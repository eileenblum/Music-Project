I was raised, by the fist, I've never loved before
I saw the truth, born in blood, violence and more
I live in no-man's land, my home I can't lose
I rule the badlands, you dare not refuse
I am a Warrior
I'll fight till the end
Run away, you better hide, I'm coming after you
Take a chance, to stand and fight, and maybe you'll be thru
I am a Warrior
I'll fight till the end
I am a Warrior
I'll fight till the end
I'm still alive, I've never lost
I have thrived, despite the cost
I live in no-man's land, my home I can't lose
I rule the badlands, they dare not refuse
I am a Warrior
I'll fight till the end
On my own, by age of ten, forced to the streets
A lot of grief, a lot of hell, but I can't be beat
I live in no-man's land, my home I can't lose
I rule the badlands, you dare not refuse
I am a Warrior 
I'll fight till the end
I am a Warrior
