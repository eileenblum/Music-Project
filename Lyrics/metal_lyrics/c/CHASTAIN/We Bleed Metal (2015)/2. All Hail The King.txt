Say what you will about faiths and beliefs
Say what you will about our salvation
Say what you will about our noble cause
Say what you will about our lost nation
We know the reasons, We know the crime
We know the long odds, We know the signs
All Hail The King, lead us forth to victory
All Hail The King, we will prevail once again
Say what you will about honor and shame
Say what you will about our chosen path
Say what you will about covenant of arms
Say what you will about our bloody wrath
We know the reasons, We know the crime
We know the long odds, We know the signs
All Hail The King, lead us forth to victory
All Hail The King, we will prevail once again
Say what you will about methods of war
Say what you will about the troops that we send
Say what you will about our lack of mercy
Say what you will about our chances to win
All Hail The King, lead us forth to victory
All Hail The King, we will prevail once again
All Hail All Hail
All Hail The King All Hail The King
All Hail All Hail 
All Hail The King All Hail The King
