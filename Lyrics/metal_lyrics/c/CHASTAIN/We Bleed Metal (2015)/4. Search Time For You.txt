I have seen past tomorrow
I have seen within my sorrows
I know all of your secrets
I know all that's forgotten
My Kingdom, My Palace, My Worldly Love
My Treasure, My Armies, Search Time For You
I feel so useless
But I shall be so ruthless
There is nothing for me without you
Abandon heart cries eternally
My Kingdom, My Palace, My Worldly Love
My Treasure, My Armies, Search Time For You
My Kingdom, My Palace, My Worldly Love
My Treasure, My Armies, Search Time For You
I have fought for my throne
And I fight against the unknown
I still long for your touch
Yet I still fight the Gods' curse
My Kingdom, My Palace, My Worldly Love
My Treasure, My Armies, Search Time For You
Search Time for You.... I will always Search Time For You
Abandon heart, cries eternally
I will forever Search Time For You 
I have seen past tomorrow
My Kingdom, My Palace, My Worldly Love
My Treasure, My Armies, Search Time For You Search Time for You.... 
I will forever Search Time For You
