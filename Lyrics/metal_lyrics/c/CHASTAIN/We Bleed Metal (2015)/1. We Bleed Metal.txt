We know that we got the disease and
We will do as we damn well please
We will never accept silence
Nor fear the threats of pain &amp; violence
Feel my blood boil, Feel my heart race
We will sacrifice and we will pay the price cause
We Bleed Metal
We know the source and I am its force
We Bleed Metal
We know that we can't be wrong for
This is where is we do belong
No need for depression
Or no need for any of your concessions
My faith is so strong, Ever, ever and ever so long
We will sacrifice and we will pay the price cause
We Bleed Metal
We know the source and I am its force
We Bleed Metal, Yes I Bleed Metal
I love it fast and loud and
I love the feel of all of you in the crowd
Every single night, It's my holy rite
We will sacrifice and we will pay the price cause
We Bleed Metal
We know the source and I am its force
We Bleed Metal, We will sacrifice
We Bleed Metal, We know the source 
We Bleed Metal
Yes We Bleed Metal
