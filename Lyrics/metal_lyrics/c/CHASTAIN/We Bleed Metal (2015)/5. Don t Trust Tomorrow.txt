You think you know the answers
You think you know it all
Well you must believe in magic
Cause everything you know is a lie
I live for today
I don't trust tomorrow
It's all just a ponzi scheme
Your money is an illusion
Betting on numbers and letters
Slight of hand creates confusion
It's all a lie
I live for today
I don't trust tomorrow
I live for today
Cause I might die tomorrow
Fortunes are lost in a moment
Lifetimes go down the drain
Computers rules our world
The house of cards will burn in flames
I live for today
I don't trust tomorrow
I live for today
I live for today
I live for today
I don't trust tomorrow
I live for today
I don't trust tomorrow
I live for today
I don't trust tomorrow
I live for today
I live for today
