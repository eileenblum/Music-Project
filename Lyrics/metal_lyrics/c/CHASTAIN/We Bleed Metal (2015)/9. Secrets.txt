Working in darkness thriving in greed
Manifestation of what we really need
Secrets creeping through your soul 
Passions always asking more
We're enlightened from within
Magic is the truth and then
Illuminati swirls around your head
Life is distracting, be unseen instead
Secrets creeping through your soul 
Passions always asking more
We're enlightened from within
Magic is the truth and then
Secrets....Secrets creeping
Help us, We're believing 
On and on the shadow flows
Straight through your heart
Secrets are created by the one who owns the dark
Prophecy goes on and on
Straight through your heart
Secrets are determined by the one, Who owns the dark
Enter the realm of possibility 
You can't destroy what it is that I have seen
Secrets creeping through your soul 
Passions always asking more
We're enlightened from within
Magic is the truth and then
Secrets....secrets creeping
Help us, We're believing 
Secrets....Secrets creeping
Help us, We're believing
