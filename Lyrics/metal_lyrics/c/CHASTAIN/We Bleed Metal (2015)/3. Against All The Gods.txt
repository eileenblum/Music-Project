Brilliant minds, hard to find, it's a world of fools
Knowledge lost, long ago, ignorance a tool
Genius dead, this we know, Holy men surmise
Their iron will, strong and still, rules to survive
Look deep within, to the home of your sins
Realize the truth, let your quest now begin
We are fighting against all the odds
We are fighting against all the gods
So unwise, to despise, those of other faiths
It's insane, to fight change, you're always too late
The Dark Age, was your rage, you think the world flat
Witches burn, you never learn, you kill the black cat 
Look deep within, to the home of your sins
Realize the truth, let your quest now begin
We are fighting against all the odds
We are fighting against all the gods
Open your eyes, to history and today
Kill all the Gods, there'd be no wars
NO MORE WARS
Like a trance, with no chance, we stand in solitude
With no thought, to be bought, they rush to intrude
It's a sign, you can't escape, blind reverence
Before the grave, you must be saved, there is no evidence
Look deep within, to the home of your sins
Realize the truth, let your quest now begin
We are fighting against all the odds
We are fighting against all the gods
We are fighting
We are fighting against all the gods
Open your eyes, to history and today
Kill all the Gods, there'd be no wars
NO MORE WARS, NO MORE WARS
