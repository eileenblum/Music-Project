They are around me but you have found me
Never letting me wander the forest lawns alone
You are near, I feel you everywhere
But the tears that fall down from my naked face
I will never let them touch your sacred ground
Your mountain is steep for me
But I will find the way for thee
Breathe through me    Please
Inherently
I often wonder why you stay around to hear what I have to say
You must have realized that you wanted it that way
I hunt for the next turn to take
Having to learn again
But youâre a constant reminder of my last mistake
Come with me
Bleed through me
But youâre a constant reminder of my last mistake
The memory of what he said
Runs through my veins
But Iâm alive and strong to tell the tale
Through the journey I found the cave all by myself
Now breathing deeper I pulled from with in I felt him
When the warm wind blows
I know he comes to guide my way
The deeper I go
Now know what you all share with me
Because you and I donât live far from hell
But youâre a constant. of my last mistake
Come with Me
Bleed through me
