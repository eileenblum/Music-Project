The road to heaven is different for us all
The road to heaven is lined with barbwire
My path to heaven is a detour in the road
But itâs your heaven, only stories that Iâm told
I AM SIN OPEN UP YOUR ARMS
I AM SIN I MEAN NO HARM
Here I am in the middle
Here I am donât say its the end
Here I am I feel so damn little
Here I am again
I AM SIN OPEN UP YOUR ARMS
I AM SIN I MEAN NO HARM
I AM SIN OPEN UP YOUR ARMS TO ME
I AM SIN I MEAN NO HARM
You donât scare me I've laid with you before
You donât scare me, he guards outside my palace door
I AM SIN OPEN UP YOUR ARMS
I AM SIN I MEAN NO HARM
I AM SIN
I AM YOURS
