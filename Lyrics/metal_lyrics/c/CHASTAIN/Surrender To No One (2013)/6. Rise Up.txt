Rise up to face the battle
Rise up to take on all our lives
Rise up the tide is turning
Rise up to beat the strife
Stand strong against the anger
Stand strong to take on hate
Stand strong the morning after
Stand strong embrace your fate
We will win, the last war
We are the soldiers of change, so stand aside
We are the victors of this life, that we defy
Fight on despite the odds
Fight on from dusk till dawn
Fight on within the shadows
Fight on hard and long
We will win, the last war
We are the soldiers of change, so stand aside
We are the victors of this life, that we defy
Call out your battleâs cry
Itâs for our fallen comrades
Iâm standing in the corner
A little past late
Waiting for all the answers
To lifeâs old debate
For in the dark night
An Angel calls my name
Holds out her hand
Tells me âIâm not to blame.â
âIâm not to blame!â
We are the soldiers of change, so stand aside
We are the victors of this life, that we defy
Rise up the end is near
Rise up
Rise up the warâs not over
Rise Up!
Rise Up!
Rise Up!
Defeat their hell!!
