Over in time I see our malignant foe
Their distance beckons forever it grows
Laying down edicts against the will of man
Destruction calls us this we understand
Rise to the challenge remember who we are
Stand up and fight knowing truths not that far
Majestic armies lay before our fields
This we will battle we shall never yield
Centuries may pass, centuries may cry
Passions of war that will never die
That shall never die
Rise to the challenge remember who we are
Stand up and fight knowing truths not that far
We are the last of our own kind
If we shall lose we will be lost in time
We must prevail for flesh and blood
Our enemies must be left far behind
Rise to the challenge remember who we are
Stand up and fight knowing truths is never far
Stand and Fight
Stand and Fight
In the morning, at true midnight
Thatâs when we'll strike with our full force
Never to weaken, never off course
Finally!!!!!!!!!!!!
Rise to the challenge remember who we are
Stand up and fight knowing truths is never far
Take us to the fight, we'll stand up for the night
We may not live, but we'll win the war
Change is on the way, for they've had their day
Stand up and fight as before!!!!!
Stand and fight
Stand and fight
