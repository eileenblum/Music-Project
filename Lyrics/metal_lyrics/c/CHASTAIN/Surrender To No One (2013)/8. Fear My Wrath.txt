I have the justice to make you fade away
I have the knowledge to know you will betray
I have the feeling to sense you through the day
I have the power unto which you shall pray
I have the strength and passion
I have the will inside of me
I have eternal wisdom
I know that I cannot die
Fear my Wrath
Fear my wrath
In the darkness you will feel my hand
In your nightmares it is where I stand
In your horrors, is my sweet homeland
In your true thoughts I will leave my brand
I have the strength and passion
I have the will inside of me
I have eternal wisdom
I know that I cannot die
Fear my Wrath as you dare to cross my path
Fear my Wrath
Fear my Wrath
Fear my Wrath
You have but one life, for which you can live
You have so little from which to trade or give
I have the justice to make you fade away
I have the power unto which you shall pray
I have the strength and passion
I have the will inside of me
I have eternal wisdom
I know I cannot die
Fear my wrath as you dare to cross my path
Fear my wrath
I have the passion inside of me
Eternal wisdom will always be
I can make you fade away
I am your justice
You gave me the power
Fear my Wrath
Fear my wrath I dare to cross my path
Fear my wrath
