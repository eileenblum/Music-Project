Screamed from a voice, only they hear
Preaching of anger, murder and fear
Power in words, power in thoughts
Unlocking actions of wars before fought
Urging the pawns, to act out commands
Blindly and deadly, they follow the plan
Inbred instincts carry out the kill
Inherent violence forever until
Driven by the powers, out of their control
Forced without a reason, I know, Itâs the Call of the Wild
Recalled lost dreams, to times long before
Acting the moment as if tales of lore
The demon inside wins for the day
Holding out hostage, wisdom will obey
Praying to Gods to help with their cause
Cursing out evil who fights their holy laws
Driven by the powers, out of their control
Forced without a reason, I know, Itâs the Call of the Wild
The Call of the Wild
The Call of the Wild
The Call, will be our downfall
The Call, is the end to us all
Changing the path, of destiny
Mankind must rise up, from its own dark needs
Programmed for war, deep in their genes
Thru ages of conflict, boisterous and mean
Innocence wanes, till the end of time
Humanity lost, The Call of The Wild
Driven by the powers, out of their control
Forced without a reason, I know, Itâs the Call of the Wild
The Call of the Wild
Itâs The Call
The Call of the Wild
Itâs The Call
The Call of the Wild
