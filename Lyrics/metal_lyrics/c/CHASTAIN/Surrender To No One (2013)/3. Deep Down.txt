I was born south of Eden, a little north of hell
Cast away before my time, to this earth I dwell
Never told of my crime, as I fought this spell
Never told of my fate, none would speak my tale
Deep down in the darkness
Is where I belong
Deep down in the darkness
Is where I call home!!!
I have watched time regress, longing for the end
I have watched seasons change, to where they begin
I have wandered to and fro, where dark and light rescind
I have played a vengeful force, earthly souls I tend
Deep down in the darkness
Is where I belong
Deep down in the darkness
Is where I call home!!!
No one cares of day and night
No one sees dark or light
No one asks which is right
No one knows of their plight
Close your eyes, open your mind
See whatâs there, whatâs left behind
Screams of anguish, screams of joy
Scream within that do not lie
Screams of passion, screams of pain
Screams within that do not hide
The screams ...
They do not lie to me
Come take my hand now
Iâll lead the way
FEAR NOT THE DARK
Its time we stay   look at me
Its time we stay
Deep down in the darkness
Is where I belong
Deep down in the darkness
Is where I call home!!!
Take me
Now my home is south of Eden, a little north of hell
Buried deep before my time, within this earth I dwell
Never told of my crime as I faced this spell
Never told of my life, none would speak my tale
Deep down in the darkness
Is where I belong
Deep down in the darkness
Is where I call home!!!
Is where I call home
Is where I call home
Take me home
Deep down
Deep down
Deep down in the darkness!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
