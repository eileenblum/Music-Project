Brave is brave, right is right
The tide is ours and turning
Dark is dark, wrong is wrong
They will soon be burning
Year by year, word by word
We have set to planning
Blood by blood, hate by hate
We have moral standing
Surrender To No One Ever Again
Surrender To No One Ever Again
Screams of pain, eyes of red
When did it begin?
Home is now a battlefield
We can no longer yield
Surrender To No One Ever Again
Surrender To No One Everâ¦ Again
Brave is brave, right is right
The tide is ours and turning
Dark is dark, wrong is wrong
They will soon be burning
Year by year, word by word
We have set to planning
Blood by blood, hate by hate
We have moral standing
Surrender To No One Ever Again
Surrender To No One Ever Again
Step by step, week by week
Stand proud and tall
Home is now a battlefield
We can no longer yield
Surrender To No One Ever
Surrender To No One Ever Again
Surrender To No One Ever Again
Surrender To No One Everâ¦ Again
Surrender To No One!!
