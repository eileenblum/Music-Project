The dawn awakens my spiritâs soul
First ray of light that makes me whole
A fresh day harkens I dream anew
Yesterdayâs losses are far removed
Freedom within calls to us all
Go back in time when we stood proud and tall
Walk of redemption it calls my name
Destiny is calling, Iâm not to blame
No one knows me in this sacred place
Escape beckons me, face to face
A moment of peace, within the war
Life takes no prisoners, Iâve seen nevermore
Freedom within calls to us all
Go back in time when we stood proud and tall
Iâm still alive and well with out defeat
A moment of peace is all that I seek
Is all that I seek
Iâm still alive and well with just one defeat
A moment of peace is all that I seek
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom within calls to us all
Go back in time when we stood proud and tall
Freedom within calls to us all
Come on and follow me because I am always free
Freedom
Freedom Within
