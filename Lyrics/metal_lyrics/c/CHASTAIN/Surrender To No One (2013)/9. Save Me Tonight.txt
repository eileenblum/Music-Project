Iâve been far and wide
Iâve been deep inside
But I will never, go dark side
And I will never, preach suicide
Oh not again
Take me, you know that I will always be here
Save Me Tonight
Save Me Tonight
Over, and again
So close, to the end
I see reflections, I see the signs
I feel dejections, across all time
Call me, you know that I will always be here
Tell me, you know that goods things now will appear
Save Me Tonight
Save Me Tonight
Face off, with right and wrong
Trade off, with short and long
But I will never, go dark side
And I will never, preach suicide
Show me, you know that I will always be here
Save Me Tonight
Save Me Tonight
