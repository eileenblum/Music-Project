Deep in your mind
Lives a force you canât ever find
Breeding through all time
It waits until it sees your sign
It has its hand on all that you think
It seizes power in an eyes blink
Evil awaits us, The Evil, it awaits us!!!!!!!!!!!
Something calls you
What it is deep inside you know
The call feels so true
You cannot stop it, it will show
It has its hands on all that you do
It seizes power from me and you
Evil awaits us, The Evil, it awaits us!!!!!!!!!!!
Into the dark, I found the light
Into the dark, I lost the fight
Into the dark, his voice was clear
Into the dark, the time is near
Evil awaits us, The Evil, it awaits us!!!!!!!!!!!
Fight the good fight
But they never let you win
Face all of your fears
The long night has only just begun
It has its hands on all that you think
It seizes power in an eyes blink
Evil awaits us, The Evil, it awaits us!!!!!!!!!!!
Evil awaits us
The evil, it awaits us
The evil, the evil that you do
Lookout, it awaits you
