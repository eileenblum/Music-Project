Two years ago it seemed too late
Where am I now
Where will I be

Living in a dreamworld
Reality's no more
I guess I'd better get going
Living in a dreamworld

War is at the fence
You know right
You're just another bird

Living in a dreamworld
Reality's no more
I guess I'd better get going
Living in a dreamworld

Laughing it up
We'll soon have no life
It's all imagined

Living in a dreamworld
Reality's no more
I guess I'd better get going
Living in a dreamworld
