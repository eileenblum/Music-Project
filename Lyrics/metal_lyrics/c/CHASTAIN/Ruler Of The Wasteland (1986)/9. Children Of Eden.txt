They live in a world of their own
They laugh and they're never seen to change
They have no place in the cell for us
There ain't a peace they'll always be the same

Children of Eden [2x]

Their smiles of joys are written on their face
And Eden's fall they know not what they missed
But somewhere along the big... rests
Their teacher comes see through and says

Children of Eden [2x]

Hear the words spoke in the dark
Their world will never be the same
They learn the ways of life
And talk about another choice
They can grab only what they see
They only learn from some one voice

Children of Eden [2x]
