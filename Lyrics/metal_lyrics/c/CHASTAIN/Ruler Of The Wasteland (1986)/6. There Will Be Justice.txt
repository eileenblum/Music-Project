You see our... is green
The terminal is also green
I think it's time to change
No more sympathy

The truth's a game

It's gonna take a miracle
It's driving me insane

There will be justice
We are the law
There will be justice
It's time to make a free state for all

It's a life for a life
Protect it or
They'll find all of us
Someone's got to die

Look into the shadows
Look into the fear
We know where it's true tonight
All the ghosts appear

There will be justice
We are the law
There will be justice
It's time to make a free state for all

You see our... is green
The terminal is also green
I think it's time to change
No more sympathy

There will be justice
