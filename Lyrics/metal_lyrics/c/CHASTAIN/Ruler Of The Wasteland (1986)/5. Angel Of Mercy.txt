Thereâs never been any reason
or escape for the treason
You just think of a time far away
I feel your flame and your anguish
I know your plans and your last wish
You just can't face another day

Angel of Mercy, take her to your homeland
Angel of Mercy, you can feel the signs,
itâs the End, itâs the End

You've stood along the life line
You've played the fool for the last time
You just want the joy and the peace
You've heard all the laughter
Youâve seen what youâre after
You just want the rest and the sleep

Angel of Mercy, take her to your homeland
Angel of Mercy, you can feel the signs,
itâs the End, itâs the End

Angel Of Mercy, Angel Of Mercy

You can hear the clockâs tick
as you scheme for your last fix,
from a place you never will awake
I hear your cry into the night
I hear you die within my fright
But now youâve saved your mistake
