If you ever felt like crying
In the head of the storm
If you ever felt like dying
The ghost of theory won

There's a light in the dark
If you take the chance
To open your heart
There's strength in the moon
If you take the chance
That tears your fears apart

And the four winds blow...
Screams your name
And search for the dawn to the nearest sight
Turning...

The battle for Nevermore [2x]

Have you ever been to heaven
To find that it was hell
Did you ever touch the seven
To find the witches spell

There's light in the dark
If you take the chance
To open up your mind
There's strength in the heart
If you take the chance
Of fashions true designs
You can see the fear as it burn inside
It's love and for you
You can hear the words
When you think it's through

The battle of Nevermore [2x]
Since you lost your realities
The battle of Nevermore
You'll win the game and bear to face the world
You'll say goodbye to all the shame

The battle of Nevermore [2x]

The battle of Nevermore [2x]
Since you lost your realities
The battle of Nevermore
You'll win the game and bear to face the world
You'll say goodbye to all the shame
