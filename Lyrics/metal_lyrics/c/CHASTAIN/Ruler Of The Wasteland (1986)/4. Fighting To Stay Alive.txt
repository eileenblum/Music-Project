Face to face with destiny
Around it at all price
Oh the years they come and go
You wonder where they hide

I will never surrender to the saddest world
Why they took my love away I will never know
Fighting to stay alive
Don't need no... bird
Fighting to stay alive
... For life for life

Temperature's so good and bad
Sacrifice a life
Yesterday seems so far away
Today the moment's right

Visions of eternity
Through the hopes and dreams
What you mention you can not see
Deep within your eyes

Face to face with destiny
Around it at all price
Oh the years they come and go
You wonder where they hide
