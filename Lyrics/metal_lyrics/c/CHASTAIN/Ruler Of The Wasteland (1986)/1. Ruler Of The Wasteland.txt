I am fire I am fate
I'm the one that feeds your hate
I am nightmare I'm your slave
Want you power take it all

I command the storm
I am your worst nightmare
I am the first hear me say
I rule to wasteland

I am anger I am...
I am power in your shame
From the living to the dead
Lock your passions with your head

I command the storm
I am your worst nightmare
I am the first hear me say
I rule to wasteland

I'm the savior of the damned
Within the shadows is where I stand
I've been places where no one dreamt
I feel nothing on your head

I command the storm
I am your worst nightmare
I am the first hear me say
I rule to wasteland

I rule the wasteland
'Cause I am the rule
