The hours of the saints

He seems to have no fear

The king has the power
The king has the power

Somewhere in time he found
He could not die
The king has the power

The power to doom
The power to hate
With a wave from his hand
He thumbs his fate

He seems to have no fear

The king has the power
The king has the power

He praises you to hear himself...
A thousand years ago a different fate

The king has the power
The king has the power
Somewhere in time
He learned he could not die
The king has the power
