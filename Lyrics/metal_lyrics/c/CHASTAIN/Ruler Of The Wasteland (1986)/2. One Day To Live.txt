Into death a human tide
You see a double X
There is a freak...
You made your last protest

The dawn is higher
Within the sounds you know your...
Baby you need love so long

You have one day to live
And love comes around today
One day to live
Before you're just a grave

The power of love against all odds
You make the promises
You keep it above erase the...
You won't be free tonight

Only today within is yours
You don't stand a chance...
Take a stance

You have one day to live
And love comes around today
One day to live
Before you're just a grave

Father of black
And father of light
Sit in the judges chair
With the future ahead

The skies are red the rain ahead
And the... opens the gate
In the mist stands the boss
Waiting for his take

You have one day to live
And love comes around today
One day to live
Before you're just a grave
