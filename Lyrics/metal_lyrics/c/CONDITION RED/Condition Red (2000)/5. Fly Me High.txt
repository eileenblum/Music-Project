Where am I now? Alone in the dark,
Riding the wind, where ever it blows
Destiny's child, son of the storm
Alone in a crowd, my hunger won't go

All I want is everything and more
All I need is feel the flame once more
Let me choose my way, fight for who I am,
feel the rush of life, right now

Fly Me High, or burn me to the ground
Make me feel, or drown me in the flood

Walking away, a loser once more
I just couldn't stay, buried alive
The fire must burn, keeping me warm
Burning my skin, feeding my soul

Can I live in every breath I take
Can I feel thru every step I take
Never be a slave, running from myself,
far away from life, in fear

Fly Me High, or burn me to the ground
Make me feel, or drown me in the flood
Fly Me High, or burn me to the ground
Make me feel, or drown me in the flood

The life of a zombie, ain't no option for me,
To fit in your world, and surrender my dreams

Fly Me High, or burn me to the ground
Make me feel, or drown me in the flood
Fly Me High, or burn me to the ground
Make me feel, or drown me in the flood
Fly Me High, or burn me to the ground
Make me feel, or drown me in the flood
Fly Me High, or burn me to the ground
Make me feel, or drown me in the flood
