Waiting for your life to begin
Soon as you're ready for your task
Don't you know your time's running out
Right now you're wasting precious time

Dream yourself away, to a distant time
While your time quickly pass you by
As your sacrifice is done

Now's the time to begin
Let your soul come alive
Free that spirit inside
Life is now, Life is now

Fighting for a cause you don't know
Meanwhile your dreams fade away
Somewhere down the road you give up
Nothing but a shadow will remain

Flush yourself away, in a dirty stream
Fade away slowly day by day
And soon nothing will remain

Now's the time to begin
Let your soul come alive
Free that spirit inside
Life is now, Life is now

Drifting, Sliding, Losing my way

Open up your tired eyes - time has come to rise again
Pick up all those pieces - make it all fit together - aaah...

Don't deny, what you want
Kiss that shadow from your past goodbye
Let your dream, take control
Make that sorrow in your heart let go - Ride on the wings of your dreams

Save yourself, turn the page
Fight that demon, you can win this time
Time has come, rise your sword
Take that devil by the horn and win - Ride on the wings of your dreams
