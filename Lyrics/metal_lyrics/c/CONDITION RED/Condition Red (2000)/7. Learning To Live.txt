I've been caught in the haze
I've been chained like a slave, prisoned too long
I've been wasting my time
Way down deep in the mud, crawling around
I will rise from the darkness of hell,
Soon I'll be breaking my spell I'm learning to live

There were times in my life
Could have sworn I was dead, buried alive
All this pain and this guilt
Kept me down below earth, losing my mind
I will rise from the darkness of hell,
Soon I'll be breaking my spell, I'm learning to live

Let me see thru the haze
Help me out of my cage, help me get out
No more fooling around
No time left to waste, precious time
I will rise from the darkness of hell,
Soon I'll be breaking my spell, I'm learning to live
Soon I'll be breaking my spell, Soon I'll be breaking my spell, I'm learning to live
