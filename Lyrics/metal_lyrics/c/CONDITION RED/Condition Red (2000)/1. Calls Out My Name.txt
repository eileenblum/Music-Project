Highway - the place I belong,
Freedom - it's calling my name
Riding with the wind, home is where it's blowin,
Prisoner of fate, can I change a thing

And I wish I could explain
Why everything's the same
All the battles I have fought, all in vain

Drifting, just go with the flow
Passion, my hunger won't go
Lead me to my fate, throw me to the lions
Ashes will remain, when I've paid my dues

Walking on a thigh rope,
Angels see me through
Dancing while the devil - Calls out my name

And I wish there was a way
To get me out of here
As darkness closes in, bring me down

Walking on a thigh rope,
Angels see me through
Dancing while the devil - Calls out my name

The Gypsy in me, got a hold of my heart
Possesses my will, carry my torch
Stars shining bright, lead the way I must go
Into the unknown, nothing to fear

Walking on a thigh rope,
Angels see me through
Dancing while the devil - Calls out my name
