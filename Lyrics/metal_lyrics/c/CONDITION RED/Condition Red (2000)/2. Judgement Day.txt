Got to pay the price, nothing is for free
Trouble's on the rise, time for you to see
Heading for your fall, open up your eyes
Destiny will call, can't you hear the cries

Tell me how you plead, are you innocent or are you guilty
Tell me who's to blame, are you sorry or feeling no remorse

The sky's turning read, a storm's on the rise
Close to the edge, It's Judgment day
There's thunder ahead, no shelter to find
Down on your knees, it's Judgement day

Guess you know this game, can't deny your part
Hunger was your name, tearing you apart
Driving you insane, getting in control
Riding thru your brain, took away your soul

Take away those blinds, you're way beyond the point of no return
The crossroad's far behind, did you miss it on the road to kingdom come

The sky's turning read, a storm's on the rise
Close to the edge, It's Judgment day
There's thunder ahead, no shelter to find
Down on your knees, it's Judgement day

There's no place you can hide, there's nothing more to say
Down on your knees, begging too late, have mercy please, have mercy...

The sky's turning read, a storm's on the rise
Close to the edge, it's Judgment day
here's thunder ahead, no shelter to find
Down on your knees, it's Judgement day
