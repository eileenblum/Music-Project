Across the river Styx, into the shadow lands
My path has taken me, so here I stand. 
The ground is soiled with blood, the wind wails
Together with the damned descended from their graves.
I stare into the dark, I see the burning eyes 
of all the demons who tormented me in life, 
but that's al over now. I see much clearer now,
for I no longer serve.

[Chorus]
For I have come to rule where your God can't see.
I shall be legion so, so hell-walk with me.

Demons, gather round me. Hear me Azazel. Guide my steps as I walk through hell.
Ascending steps of bone I see a giant throne with screaming, tortured souls embedded
in the stone. My minions follow me, their overlord to be. My wish is their command

[Chorus]

God since long dead, Satan's dethrones. The power over you is mine alone.
There shan't be no second coming now. You see the only thing that remains is your demise.
