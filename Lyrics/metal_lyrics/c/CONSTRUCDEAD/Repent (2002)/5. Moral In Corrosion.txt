Hear the bigot preach, you don't want to miss his speech about
just how simple life is. "Just follow the yellow brick road, to
paradise to which it leads". Well, I've got a thorn
stuck in my eyes, and I can't fucking see.

[Chorus]
Row upon row, raised to not believe
Marching on to mental vasectomy.
Speak no evil lest thou shall be condemned 
but do no good-just mend for yourself. 

Survival of the fittest. Darwinism expressed in righteous egoism 
"Help yourself and fuck the rest."
Rob all, rape all, kill all. Be victor or victim.

[Chorus]

I'm on top, so what I've got blood on my hands? It's just the price you've got to pay

[Chorus]
