[Chorus]
Watch the hourglass drain itself, watch the smiles grow forced.
In retrospect, nothing turned out the way I thought; all is lost.

I guess I'm overly philosophical, but that's just my cross.
'cause every time I stop to watch the present I see the corpse, decayed, of what once was.
Time's our guide on the path of life, and it's leading us astray as the blood turns cold.

[Chorus:] all love lost

We all feed on expectation and dreams; damn whoever gets in the way.
The loved one today might be the scapegoat to be;
Fuck or get fucked-it's always been that way. 

[Chorus:] all is lost

Sweet promises whispered by lovers at night, given with passion before.
Say them again, look into my eyes and tell me- who's the whore? 

The deceiver will think himself deceived 
Forming a truth of his own, as they always do.
It's only a matter of what you want to believe,
But in the end we've got nothing-Everything's lost.
Time's our guide on the path of life, and it's leading us astray
as the blood turns cold. Everything's lost...
