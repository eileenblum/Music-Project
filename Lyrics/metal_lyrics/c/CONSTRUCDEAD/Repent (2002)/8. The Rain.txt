Another grey day in the sewer; staring blank eyes, closed up, blank minds.
Fools on parade. The end is near. None shall be saved, no conscious is clear.
Rejoice now! Old humankind has used up all it's precious time. The
Complaining masses shall be silenced for all time.
I've seen it coming, I've seen all the signs. I know there's no tomorrow,
nowhere to hide, all shall drown, all shall die. Soon comes the rain.
I darkness, in silence I wait. Anticipation's growing as the hour's
growing late.  Frustration increasing, I'm getting tense;
The world needs to get cleansed. I've waited for days, no sky fall
has shown. I might as well do some fucking killing of my own.
Here comes the rain. Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. I'll hunt you down,
you shall die-Here comes the rain. Here comes the rain, I am the rain.
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. I come with pain, I come with fire, so let it rain.
Come, follow me into the rain. Come, fall with me; I am the way.
Come, follow me-just let it rain.
The day of the rain has come to pass. The day of the rain is here at last
To even out the final score, Please God, just let it pour. 
Come follow me into the rain. Come fall with me, I am the way
Come follow me-just let it rain.
The day of the rain has come to pass. The day of the rain is here at last
to even out the final score. Please God just let it pour.
