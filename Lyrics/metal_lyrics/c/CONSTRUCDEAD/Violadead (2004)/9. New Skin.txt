[Music: Ericson/Tuthill, Lyrics: Tuthill]

You can't ignore the facts that they're all
around your face
A dripping mud like human form of
hate has crossed your way
Your decomposing rotten flesh has
found its way into the soil
The sun above your face is bright,
and your skin begins to boil
When your skin begins to boil

Wake up!
Nailed to the past
Wake up!

Who are you?
In present times you're no one new
Who are you?
When you don't know we've
passed on through

Scarred!
Beyond repair you lick your wounds
They've found you inside
your hollow tomb
Your try to scream for help,
but you're no longer heard
You're way passed the boundries
and you're out of words

Wake up!
Nailed to the past
Wake up!

Who are you?
In present times you're no one new
Who are you?
When you don't know we've
passed on through
Who are you?
Who are you? You're no one new!
Who are you?
Who are you? You're no one new!

[Solo: Dahlberg]

Who are you?
In present times you're no one new
Who are you?
Who are you? You're no one new!
