[Music: Ericson/Thyselius/Regefelt, Lyrics: Tuthill]

A war of independence, 
but have you done your share
By human hand we're 
driven into a dark despair
A call for truth, a yell for help
But are you going places, 
or burnt beyond repair?

They get closer, are you set?
They crawl nearer, are you set?

You've fallen for their cancer
No cure for your decease
Fallen for their cancer
No cure for your decease

Your feed yourself with maggots
just to get strength to stand
Well, have you got the guts to
stand up to their demands
Or are you just too weak
for taking on the fight
A little imbecile who
don't dare staying ground

They get closer, are you set?

You've fallen for their cancer
No cure for your decease
Fallen for their cancer
No cure for your decease

[Solo: Dahlberg]

Come taste the life beneath
Down here it's you we eat
Come closer you're the meat
Don't try to speak
Why suffer when you can be a part of us?

Fallen for their cancer
No cure for your decease
Fallen for their cancer
No cure for your decease

Fallen for their cancer
No cure for your decease
