[Music: Ericson/Dahlberg, Lyrics: Tuthill]

What's it all about today,
when everything has gone this way

I try to see the logic here,
but all I see is fear

I dig for answers deep beneath, 
hold my hands out to sense the heat

The way this all goes down, 
I can't find release

How much more of this will be
Won't you simply set them free?

I can't take it
I can't take it,
re-arrange it!
Your soul control
I just hate it,
re-arrange it!

Full charge, straight mind
The won't make it,
re-arrange it now!

The suffering is way beyond all
sense that one can take

Keep this up, and don't retreat,
I'm sure that they will break

I can't take it
I can't take it,
re-arrange it!
Your soul control
I just hate it,
re-arrange it!

Full charge, straight mind
They won't make it!

Ahh...go!
