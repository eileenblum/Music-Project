[Music: Ericson/Dahlberg, Lyrics: Tuthill]

The drive their selves into insanity
for a life they think will hold
For me to be accepted i gotta fit
into their mold

Liars, beggars go to hell,
so do I fit the norm?
Or am I just not right for
them a useless little worm?

Bow down, or I'll be the victim
Slow down, in pace with their beliefs
So bound, once you're hooked
you're gone for life
So bow down, or stand
alone and freeze

I know where I stand
I'm one of their damned
No beliefs, pure decease

Do I dare to not take part, or
am I just too weak?
Am I falling for their fucked up
rules, or can I use my feet?

Liars, beggars go to hell,
so do I fit the norm?
Or am I just not right for
them a useless little worm?

Bow down, or I'll be the victim
Slow down, or stand alone and freeze

I know where I stand
I'm one of their damned
No beliefs, pure decease

This time they'll never get me,
this time I'm marked for life
This time they'll never get me,
this time I'm marked for life

I know where I stand
I'm one of their damned
No beliefs, pure decease
I know where I stand
I'm one of their damned
No beliefs, so bound
