[Music: Ericson/Tuthill, Lyrics: Tuthill]

You know I can't be beaten
There's way too much inside
A constant drill of hatred
A need for homicide

My rage has broken out
It's hell without a doubt
My rage has broken out
It's hell without a doubt

My hate
Will bring you down
Your pain
Will leave you with me

My plan has been perfected
I won't be changing lanes
All thoughts have been dissected
No, this won't be in vain
I will not be misleaded
I'm sure this is my fate
I don't care that you pleaded
I'm filled right up with hate

My rage has broken out
It's hell without a doubt
My rage has broken out
It's hell without a doubt

My hate
Will bring you down
Your pain
Will leave you with me

No, I won't, I will not,
I won't be lead
No, I cannot rest,
until you're dead

No, I won't, I will not,
I won't be lead
No, I won't, I can't, I know...

My hate
Will bring you down
Your pain
Will leave you with me

My hate
Will bring you down
Your pain
Will leave you with me

My hate
Will bring you down
Your pain
Will leave you with me

Your pain!
My hate!

My hate...
