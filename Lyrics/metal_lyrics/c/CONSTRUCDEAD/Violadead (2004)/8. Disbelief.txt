[Music: Ericson, Lyrics: Tuthill]

As unbelievable that it is
You can't believe that you exist

Step outside
Take a breath
Breathe the air
Let it out

Do you believe in something?
Do you believe?

You hear the knock, but don't reply
You're closed inside your inner hive

Step outside
Take a breath
Breathe the air
Let it out

Do you believe in something?
Do you believe?
Do you believe in something?
Do you believe?

You can destroy your inner voice
You can destroy your inner voice
You can destroy your inner voice
You can destroy your inner voice

See it now, and realize
You won't get far now with your Christ
Let it go, and let it rest
Cease your thoughts, and let them go

Do you believe in something?
Do you believe?
Do you believe in something?
Do you believe?
