[Music: Ericson/Tuthill, Lyrics: Tuthill/Harju/Wichers/Larsson]

This is the end
A screaming silence in my head
Like I was dead
I walk the streets unseeing

Crawling inside
The beast within me tears me apart
The words that you spoke
As a knife right through my heart

Let it all out, I'm wounded
Shutting you out
Stepping away from our past
Let it all out, I'm wounded
Shutting you out
Stepping away from our past

You ripped out my heart and
threw it on the wall of pain
There's no ending, no start
A pounding feeling that want's out

The screaming inside
Echoes from a past so far away
The tears that I cried
Pouring down into my wound

Let it all out, I'm wounded
Shutting you out
Stepping away from our past
Let it all out, I'm wounded
Shutting you out
Stepping away from our past

Your turned our love into pain
You lied, denied, so now, goodbye
I will never trust you again
You lied, denied, why?

Let it all out, I'm wounded
Let it all out, I'm wounded
Shutting you out
Stepping away from our past
Let it all out, I'm wounded
Shutting you out
Stepping away from our past
