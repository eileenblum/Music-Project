[Music: Tuthill, Lyrics: Tuthill/Harju/Strid]

Strapped in anger about to break
I try to keep it in me, but it's too late
Unleash the fury, release the gain
I pull the trigger to ease the pain

I was fragile
Now I am free at last

Now it seems like all is wasted
Remember who you are
I've got time to spend
Release me from this

Can't stop this feeling, I love to hate
The violence in me will overtake
You can't control me, you never will
My darkened soul is set to kill
Unleash the fury, release the gain
I pull the trigger to ease the pain

I was fragile
Now I am free at last

Now it seems like all is wasted
Remember who you are
I've got time to spend
Release me from this bitter end, my friend
And it hurts though I am shameless
Remember who you are
Dividing pain and guilt, it isn't worth it
I'm heading towards the end
