[Music: Ericson/Tuthill/Thyselius, Lyrics: Jelenovich]

Eyes distorted by this hate
This is the way, this is the way
No way to turn
Open up this cage and let it out

Bless the morning sun, arise,
hell awaits this livid sky
Put back the pieces right
in line this time

Tormenting, failing, undertake
Nasty cuts, this bleed won't heal
Elements are driven to its stake

Deliver humongous, deliver decay
Deliver humongous, deliver decay

Raped, stabbed, burned
Raped, stabbed, burned
Raped, stabbed, burned
Raped, stabbed, burned

See the sights, re-entered hook,
flogging bodies hung undone

Deliver humongous, deliver decay
Deliver humongous, deliver decay

Raped, stabbed, burned
Raped, stabbed, burned
Raped, stabbed, burned
Raped, stabbed, burned

Look into this hollow soul
take me for the saviour which I am
[X 7]

Deliver humongous, deliver decay
Deliver humongous, deliver decay

Raped, stabbed, burned
Raped, stabbed, burned
Raped, stabbed, burned
Raped, stabbed, burned

Raped, stabbed, burned
[X 9]
