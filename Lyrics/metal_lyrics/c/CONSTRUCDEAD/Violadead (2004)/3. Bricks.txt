[Music: Ericson/Thyselius, Lyrics: Tuthill]

I've felt this way before,
closed inside, behind the door
Where no one hears my cries,
I'm locked inside with nothing but lies

I leap
I'm falling down, without a sound
It's deep
When falling bricks don't hit the ground

Another grasp for air, another useless thought
I cannot seem to halt this, I'll never find the key
I'm stiff, I'm cold, I've lost my hold
What happened to control?

I leap
I'm falling down, without a sound
It's deep
When falling bricks don't hit the ground

I cannot take this
I cannot take this
I cannot take this
I cannot take this
I cannot take this
I cannot take this
I cannot take this
I cannot take this

The more I suffer now, 
the deep down I go
I feel the ground is near, 
I've reached my all time low
I'm still stiff and cold,
no longer in control
The only way is down

I leap
I'm falling down, without a sound
It's deep
When falling bricks don't hit the ground
