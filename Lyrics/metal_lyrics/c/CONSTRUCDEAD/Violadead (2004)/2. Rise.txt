[Music: Ericsson, Lyrics: Tuthill]

(No I won't take part)

The perfect breed, humanity
We change ourselves just to fit the norms
I've come to see, that finally, I have
to rise up and claim my place

Stand on your feet
Take defeat
Stand on your feet
See that you're weak

No I won't, I won't take part
No I won't, I'll stick to me
No I won't, I won't take part
No I won't, I'll stick to me

I will not stand for your ideals
I will demand some quality
I won't take part, I will not join
I'm not the same as you, I've got degree

Stand on your feet
Take defeat
Stand on your feet
And see that you're weak

No I won't, I won't take part
No I won't, I'll stick to me
No I won't, I will not go
No I won't, I'll still be me

[Solo: Ericson]

Stand on your feet
Take defeat
Stand on your feet
And see that you're weak

No I won't, I won't take part
No I won't, I'll stick to me
No I won't, I will not go
No I won't, I'll stick to me
No I won't, I won't be you
