When the night comes into my life, I cannot guarantee
A dark shade controls my moves, I cannot calm down
If I want to keep safe, I got to be first in this game... I will!

When the sunset starting to fade, and the moon is on the sky
I'll start to feel my own change, I cannot recognize
What becomes after this night, is true in day to day life
Let this sunset be your last.

Now it's the time to break the ice, learn my path and see
I'm the violent nighttime rambler, riding in the dark
Time when the moonlight comes, I wanna fly higher and higher again
In the morning I am here no more.

As the sun stays down in the nighttime, I wanna stay awake
Can't close my eyes in the nighttime, there's more to see indeed...
Like a child I'm rambling around
Therefore I cannot give ground
Let this sunset be your last.

Now it's the time to break the ice, learn my path and see
I'm the violent nighttime rambler, riding in the dark
Time when the moonlight comes, I wanna fly higher and higher again
In the morning I am here no more.
