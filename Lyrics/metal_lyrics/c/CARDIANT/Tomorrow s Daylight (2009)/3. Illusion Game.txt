It's time to take off concrete shoes and change the way of wind
Time to turn the page, if you lord it over me
Lost and found again, when the resurrection ends
Time to change the rules, he said: "play the game with me"
"Play the game, play the game, 'till the waters freeze"
You've been left on your own with your hunch
Start to fear, it's the time, to play
An illusion game

Time to draw the line, before it comes too real
Now it's time to use my rulebook and let see who will laugh
Time to loose the chains, and feel the strenght in veins
Time to take your pride, he said: "play the game with me"
"Play the game, play the game, 'till the waters freeze"
I've been left on my own with my luck
Start to fear, it's the time, to play - the illusion game
...The last link in chain... the last game with me.

I had a chance, I won that round but I got away
Even if I was breaking the rule!

"Play the game, play the game, 'till the waters freeze"
He was left on his own by his rules
Start to fear, 'cause it's the time to play - the illusion game!
...The last game with me...
Illusion game... that we play...
