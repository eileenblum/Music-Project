When the day turns to night
And everything seems to be gone
Darkness falls upon my eyes
And I'm all, alone.
Oh can you please hold me now
And guide me through the night?

It's not me, who turns the page
It's not me, who leads in haze
Only you can follow my heart
Oh, finally, I realize...
If you just hold me now
And say: "there'll be a tomorrow"
Oh babe, you got my heart in your hands.

Stay for a while, as long as the skies, are on our side
We can leave, the world behind, and the shine of our love remains.

Oh can you please hold me now, and say: "there'll be a tomorrow"
Stay for a while, as long as the skies, are on our side
We can leave the world behind, and the shine of our love remains.
Oh, stay, a while... ooh
We can leave the world behind
And the shine of our love remains.
