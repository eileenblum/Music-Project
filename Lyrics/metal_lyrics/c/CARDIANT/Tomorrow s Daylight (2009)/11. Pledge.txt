The longer I wait, the stronger the pain in their hearts
The brighter the light, the darker it gets in my mind
Oh these feelings have taken over me.
All that remains, are delusions in my head
I'm not sober enough for today
Sign of the saviour has lost, its place in their hearts, once again.
I cannot feel a thing I just hate to be myself
I'm too tired to play my role.
Whisper your wish but it won't make a difference
Your child will grow up in fear.

Take your pledge of the life without fear
And vanish again in the shade, or can you hear
The faint prayer of our child...
- Pledge of nothing!

The memories of past, are buried in hate and despair
Is it too late to make it up to you?
All that remains are delusions in my head
I'm not sober enough for today.
I cannot feel a thing I just hate to be myself
I'm too tired to keep my vows.

Take your pledge of the life without fear
And vanish again in the shade, or can you hear
The faint prayer of our child...
Will you take your pledge of the life without fear
And vanish again in the shade
Or can you hear, the faint prayer of our child...
- Pledge of nothing!
