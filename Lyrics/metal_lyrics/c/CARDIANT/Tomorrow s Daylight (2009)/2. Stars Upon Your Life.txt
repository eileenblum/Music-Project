I never wrapped my arms around you
Never dared, to reach the sky it was too high
Just like the stars upon your life.

Followed you into darkness, didn't know, it's raining or cold
You led, and I felt so blind.
Never said what you wanted, or told what I could become
How can a star, shine without the light of the sun.

Used to be a glowing...
I never wrapped my arms around you
Never dared, to reach the sky it was too high
Just like the stars upon your life.

Sometimes words have no meaning
But a word, can turn down a spark
Went through, and I'm still halfway.

I never wrapped my arms around you
Never dared, to reach the sky it was too high
Just like the stars upon your life
Never placed a single word against you
Therefore, believe I never changed the course
Of bright stars upon your life... oh...

Everytime I felt aware I was in a dream
It's something I won't give away!

I never wrapped my arms around you
Never dared to reach the sky it was too high
Just like the stars upon your life
Never placed a single word against you
Therefore believe I never changed the course of your stars
I'll never change the course of bright stars upon your life.
