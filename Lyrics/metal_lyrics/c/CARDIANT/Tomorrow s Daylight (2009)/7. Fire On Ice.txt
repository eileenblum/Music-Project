Out of reach but too close to see, I've always wondered why
The scars closed my heart and if this is the sign, to move on
Heading for lights and I taste no fear, the winds are always with me
Because of these reasons I gave up my past, all the way
They're singing ''whoah'' in the light of the stars
They're singing ''whoah'' and the world's here tonight

Fire on ice - and time's running out
And I am waiting for signs
Fire on ice - and we're making sounds
Breaking the silence tonight!

Hear my voice and the lightning strikes, now the sound is faster than light
Because of these reasons we came here to rock, all night
They're singing ''whoah'' in the light of the stars, once again
They're singing ''whoah'' and the world's here tonight!

My heart is beating and I feel the rush, the rhythm gets stronger in me
A part of my soul is craving for more, always...
They're singing ''whoah'' in the light of the stars
They're singing ''whoah'' and the world's here tonight...

Fire on ice - and time's running out
And I am waiting for signs
Fire on ice - and we're making sounds
Breaking the silence tonight!
Fire on ice - the time's run out
Now the sound is faster than light
Because of these reasons we came here to rock, all the night!
