A single word you change your life
Turn your world upside down
And tear your dreams apart
The word, can tear down all the walls you've built
Strike down your defense, send you back to the start!

Yeah, she should have thought it again
When she said she's done, I can help her no more!
She may think that she has sung the love song never heard before
She has lost the game but just keeps pushing on
Does she think that she can walk away after all the words she lied
Does she think that she can make the tears uncried?

I've got to find a way to help her learn to be alone
Got to find, yeah tonight, got to find!
Doing what, her heart tells her I cannot feel the hate
As long, as she tells me the truth.

Well, what is life without changes, and no matter how I try, I can help her no more!
She may think that she has sung the love song never heard before
She has lost the game but wants to carry on
But to think that she can walk away after all the words she lied
Does she think that she can make the tears uncried?
In this world, life lays on a broken line
Still she thinks that she can make the tears uncried...
...The tears uncried...
...The words, she lied...
