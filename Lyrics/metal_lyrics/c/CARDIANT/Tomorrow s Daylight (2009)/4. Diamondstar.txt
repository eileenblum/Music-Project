I always tried to get good things to last, and then they turned to pain
Guess I was trying to feed the flames in the rain..
Never thought you would be the light of the dawn, I couldn't see through
I guess I was too stuck in the dark or too proud to say I'm wrong...
I was led by the light of the diamond star, and carried away from it all
I think I felt love under the diamond star...

In the darkest night you were the morning for me, recreated a spark
You made me lean on something I couldn't believe..
Never thought I could find the light of a dawn, I saw it in your eyes
I was fooled by signs of a thunder, but you made me see...
I was led by the light of the diamond star, and carried away from it all
I think I felt love under the diamond star, and never let it go...
Ever since the world began I knew, it was true
Ever since I dreamt of my diamond star
I was destined to follow its bright guiding light.

I was led by the light of the diamond star, and carried away from it all
I think I felt love under the diamond star, and never let it...
I was led by the light of the diamond star
I was carried away from it all
I believe I felt love under the diamond star...
