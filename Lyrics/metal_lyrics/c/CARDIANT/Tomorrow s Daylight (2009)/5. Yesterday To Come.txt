I'm hanging on to yesterday it ain't easy to live for today
Lots of decisions I can't go through...
Once so young and brave I was, I wanted all, and nothing less
Now the flame has scorched my core!

I had a vision there was a man with a cure
Cure will heal you, take you back to this life
Life should be cool, after the treatment
Meant just for you, so take my hand!!

It was a choice without knowledge
That choice led to ravage
Sometimes what you want, ain't what you need!

Again, easy way was the said dead end
It feels like all in the past gone too fast
For now I cannot try, I think I, need to pretend
Don't know how long this will last?!

It was a choice without knowledge
That choice led to ravage
Sometimes I just wait for, yesterday to come again.

I, I gave my heart for time
Is it tomorrow, today or yesterday!

I had a heart, I sold it for too low price
Price you'll pay, has no value in life
Life in my hands was torn apart
Part of my soul, died in that moment!!!

It was a choice without knowledge
That choice led to ravage
Sometimes what you want, ain't what you need!
It was a choice without knowledge
That choice led to ravage
Sometimes I just wait for, yesterday to come again.
