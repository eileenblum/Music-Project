Why I thought I had it all
and why I wanted more
Could it be just there for while,
the while I need for myself

Never dared to seal my door
Never dared to look behind
Once again I was
As fool as I can be

Anger takes my mind at will
The will I never could lead
Feel this anxious rise
Got no chance to be myself

Maybe somewhere IÂ´ll find
the place where I can just be
Let me allow this dawn
Before weÂ´ll follow that star

IÂ´m making my command
on this hazy unknown ground

(The) Pain and the anger is gone 
I know my life is worth of this run
I wonÂ´t again put myself to burn my 
Candle at both ends
Once we will break our time
And that shine in your eyes will be my guide
Looking into the stars
made me blindly believe
in the truth of the lighting star

It may be hard to tell in advance
For now we assume and wait the forgotten chance
