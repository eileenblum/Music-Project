I found myself again striving beetween night and day
May be IÂ´ll let myself drift with the wind
I donÂ´t know where she came, In her name IÂ´ll find it out
She holds the hagard bloom in her hair

He thought he saw the sun shine
but what he saw was the moon light
DidnÂ´t know the order in line
Light was too bright

He thought he saw the sun shine
but what he saw was the moon light
Too much brighter,
thereÂ´s no dimmer for the light

You pray for the light,
you pray for the moon and
you donÂ´t even see that dispute
YouÂ´re holding the key
youÂ´re holding your mind
but you canÂ´t say 
if you donÂ´t dare to try

I saw  it in your eyes, there was something in your mind
May be IÂ´ll give it up, may be
