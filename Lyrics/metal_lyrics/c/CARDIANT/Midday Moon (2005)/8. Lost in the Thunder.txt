A voice calls 'cry havoc,
and let slip the dogs of war'
Stay your hand no more

No reason, hope or glory
Beneath the chain of command
Dreams fade in the wind like sand

No one cares
Who you really are
Nameless, faceless, shouting out
In vain the battle cry
Lost in the thunder of the war machines roar

Not a holy nor a heathen symbol
Can save you poor soul now
Face the curtain with a bow

What do you think your worth is
When the wheel of battle rolls
Today for you it tolls

No one cares
Who you really are
Nameless, faceless, shouting out
In vain the battle cry
Lost in the thunder of the war machines roar

The promises you gave
It's time to take them back
You're lucky to even get you name
On your epitaph
