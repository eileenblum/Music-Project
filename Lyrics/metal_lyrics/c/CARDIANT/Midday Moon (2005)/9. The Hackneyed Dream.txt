Wait over night, and close your eyes
Seems to me, a path with no end ...
Lock up your door, go into thoughts
Find yourself wailing for the broken dream....

Sometimes I just wish I could turn time
I would make my choices in a different way
Today itÂ´s too late my friend

Yesterday the water froze
Nothing is colder than ice 
Most of my dreams
Never came.... true
That day I found out 
I was dreaming of something that I lost
Still I believe in tomorrow

Other manÂ´s nightmare
could be another manÂ´s daily dream
Wish I could live in that realm
