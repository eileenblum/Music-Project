For the wind under wings
For the wings of my plane
For the plane that will carry me far away

For the night of this day
For the day of this week
For the week that will end this pain

But the light is too fast for me
And my voice is too slow to reach her lies

I think she knows
sheÂ´s wrapping herself in the wickedness but canÂ´t let go
It so charming though itÂ´s a sickness I already know

For the queen of the guile
For the guile in our minds
For the mind that will hide our emotional side

For the instinct of your selfpreservation
that will keep your way straight

IÂ´m calling for northern winds
IÂ´m calling for the rising sun
IÂ´m calling for moons
IÂ´m calling for stars
IÂ´m calling for you
