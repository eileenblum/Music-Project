Today I saw it was more I could take
Made my mind out of line
How can I breath if this worldÂ´s full of pain
leaving me no other choice

Like a wind, like a rain, like a storm
I will gain
Answers that held my mind
Gimme day, Gimme week
And I tell what I need
More days to live

Too many times we think we sense the danger
though we canÂ´t even see ourselves

WeÂ´re talking Â´bout the future
WeÂ´re worrying Â´bout the future in our lives
WeÂ´re waiting for tomorrow to come
WeÂ´re talking Â´bout the future

And the sound in my head keeps telling me
what is the truth and what is not
How can I know for sure
If we think we are clever enough
To find our mindless reign
I canÂ´t stand no more

Time after you feel that you donÂ´t believe why it is here
To be just for you
Yeah, I knew before
