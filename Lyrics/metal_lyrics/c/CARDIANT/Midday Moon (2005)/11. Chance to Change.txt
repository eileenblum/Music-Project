I have seen fighting to the bitter end on this field
Like they cared what the life would be without foolish pride
Sure I am looking for something to stand on
IÂ´m making my very last run though,
and I know the price

But could we see the life that was once behind us through these eyes
In the end may be these concepts turn up again
We all want to bear away the golden prize
the pride is our oath,
Now and before, for now.

The hate and the will gives cause to compete day by day
no more is honesty in our minds
Unfair means rule this circus of misery
ItÂ´s changing my life, changing your time

If there was a chance for me to change
I would let go all that pain and regret
These are the words with flaming rhymes
Spiced with the pride, yeah

If there was a chance for me to chance
We might not think of the price of our race
These were the words that chimed once
yeah

How about? youÂ´re loosing that all after this mindless war
We can see the evening star though life has just begun
FROM my heart constancy has almost gone
Nothing to say or hear, this wound is to last.

If there was a chance for me to chance I would make a move for the chance to my change
I want to make a change, I want to feel a change
Hopefully I am ready to arrange, hopefully I am ready for my change
