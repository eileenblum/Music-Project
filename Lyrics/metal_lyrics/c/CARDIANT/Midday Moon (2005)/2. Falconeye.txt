There is no tailwind on this flight to nowhere
Ten thousand miles behind and yet to soar 
With my falconeye,
You made it worth of carrying on

Somewhere that road became a cul-de-sac
At that time I realized my dreams werenÂ´t there
With my falconeye,
To the last I tried to turn alright

Take the sight to the night,
I will never dream again
Whisper changes my lifetime

With my falconeye,With your falconeye
With my falconeye I have seen my rope
end to the wrong aim

If I just could accept my loss at this game
For now IÂ´m foreign with no will to live
With my falconeye,
You made it worth of carry on

Take the sight to the night,
I will never dream again
WhisperÂ´s truly in my heart
Make this thought to come true
We are burning the bridge behind
CanÂ´t go on or reappear

With my falconeye, With your falconeye
With your falcon eye,
you made it worth of carry on
