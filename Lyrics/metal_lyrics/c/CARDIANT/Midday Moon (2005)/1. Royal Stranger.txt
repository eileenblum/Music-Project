I'm astray, so far away
In crowds I'm still alone
And I will be gone
Before the day grows long

Where ever I've spent my time
Where I have been I always know
I will never belong

I wear masks in my life
One to laugh and one to cry
'cause people would never understand the real me anyway

I'm the royal stranger
Who no one ever knows

Again I must walk away
I cannot let them see
There's no need to have them worry over me

I look back, I'm always outside
As for change I don't see why
'cause people would never understand the real me anyway

I'm the royal stranger
Who no one ever knows
Always walk alone

What my mask has to hide
Is the story of my life
It?s you who are free
The stranger here is me
