The deed can be done if you listen to me, yeah.
Feel the power of the errant soul
I have seen many years passing by
and I cannot find.

WeÂ´re searching for light and dust in the smoke, yeah.
Soon this standing will turn around
Could it be something else
what the guideline tells?
I donÂ´t know the law.
We will carry on till the death do us part
and light in the smoke.

Dust, light and the smoke
Shadows are strong tonight on our side
Dust, light and the smoke
Melting no more, the scene closes
(as the show) / (on and on)
