Watching the scene on your brand new plasma screen
Evil man, evil deeds, evil plan
Stirring up rage in your sheltered modern mind
So you find where his journey began

Wanting to know he is suffering his fate

Eye for an eye and a whole head for a tooth
Make them pay, make them bleed, make the crawl
Justice is served when the guilty ones are burned
And by mounting their heads on the wall

A righteous end surely justifies the means, yeah
You can't be wrong

You say you can tell the judgement deserved
You say you are wise and you should be heard
Justice turns into vengeance

Oh, just tell me - what have you learned?

You say you can tell the judgement deserved
You say you are wise and you should be heard
You say you can choose who lives and who dies
You say you see things with untainted eyes

You say you can tell the judgement deserved
You say you are wise and you should be heard

Justice turns into vengeance

Oh, how many crimes your violence deterred?
