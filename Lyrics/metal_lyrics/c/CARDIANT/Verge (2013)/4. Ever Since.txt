Every time the morning comes
The wall is always higher
Desire stands still
Every time you try to be awake
The see-through smile reminds you
That your place is in the darkened room
With a girl who'd never speak to you

Oh, how you miss her
And you know she feels the same

Can you name your fear?
Can you look her in the eye?
Can you feel she's near?
Or is she just a plague in your mind?

Ever since you've dreamed of love
The spite has gotten stronger
This game is too wicked for you
The burden in your heart
Won't hide the bruises on her skin
Dancing in the crimson room
With the girl who never rejected you

Oh, how you love her
And she has to feel the same

Can you name your fear?
Can you look her in the eye?
Can you feel she's near?
Or is she just a plague in your mind?

Good riddance to your beauty
Your life's been good to you
I'm trying to change
But it's getting more painful every day

Good riddance to your beauty
You life's been good to you
I'm trying to change
But it's getting more painful every day

While you're alive! Alive!

They need more security
They need more protection
They need to be in charge
They need more placebo

It is so unitive when you have the one to claim
But it's not constant - it's just a part of change
It feels so hollow if there is no-one to blame
And the way I see it's you or me
So it's you who has to die

Good riddance to your beauty
Your life's been good to you
I'm trying to change
But it's getting more painful every day
While you're alive

Good riddance to your beauty
Your life's been good to you
I'm trying to change
But it's getting more painful

Good riddance to your beauty
Your life's been good to you
But it's getting more painful every day
While you're alive!
