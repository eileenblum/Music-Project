I see a blood red sky upon us
On the verge of despair
An evil breath takes over my spine
A dark figure on the alley has her eyes on my heart
It's the face of death
Wearing a sardonic smile

Would you ever have gotten to know me by dreaming
Just can't believe this nightmare is real
Endangered by a hunter second to none, I am
My escape is over, these things can't be undone

Every inch is too much, every second too long for me
When the burden is carried all the way

Far into the night I will
I will play this game all the way
No-one wins and I ask myself
Who am I when the story ends
I took off the mask and I opened my heart
But still I can't rewind my life

I just can't rewind my life back in time

In dream sit seems I'm alive again
Have a heart, have a beat, I feel love

I just can't rewind my life back in time
Every time I try it throws me

Far into the night I will
I will play this game all the way
No-one wins and I ask myself
Who am I when the story ends

I took off the mask and I opened my heart
But still I can't rewind my life

I believe I can't say how sorry I am
In dreams it seems alive
