Every time when he left us
Suspicion grew in me
Even this primrose path could hide the pain
The scars would still remain

I saw a stranger in my dreams
I saw his eyes through the glass
He looked at me like we knew each other
But this time would be the last

A fading hope of love and compassion
No part of your life

How could I learn to live alone
If my heart is stone before I walk
How could I know what I'm doing wrong
If you never give me a sign

They broke into his shelter
The innocence was revealed
Had to create himself the world of prestige
Where he's not the one beneath

A fading hope of love and compassion
Even they try, I'm just a stranger despised

How could I learn to live alone
If my heart was buried before I walked
How could I know what I'm doing wrong
Let the inception guide your way

How could I learn to live alone
If my heart is stone before I walk
How could I know what I'm doing wrong
