[Japanese Bonus Track]He was out of this world
Far away from the world he knows
Decisions made by himself were unshown

In vain he pushed another day (he was too weak to walk alone)
Despite of the distant goal
He thought an obstacle course
Remains no more, when the line is crossed

This time the wheel is turning round and round
My world is upside down and I can't reach the ground
I'd like to know how things were shown
In his eyes after the promise despised

Every word wore a note
Every sentence drew a line of rhyme
But to his ears a harmony tended to be a broken chord

This time the wheel is turning round and round
My world is upside down and I can't reach the ground
I'd like to know how things were shown
In his eyes after the promise despised
And led my life tumbling down

This time the wheel is turning round and round
My world is upside down and I can't reach the ground
I'd like to know how things were shown
In his eyes after the promise despised
And led my life tumbling down

I must be far away, beyond all the light

This time the wheel is turning round and round
My world is upside down and I can't reach the ground
I'd like to know how things were shown
In his eyes after the promise despised
The final first time couldn't reach the ground
