Deep in your eyes I see pain
Though you still remain
Watching me, silently
How could I understand

And what can I say
To you on this day
This silent goodbye
Gives me a sign
I belong here no more

Talk to me
Don't shut me out, please!
You have to know
You don't have to face this alone
I am here, just let go of your fear
While the ice is cold let the memories unfold

Oh, I have tried
To stay by your side
But I know you must
Deal it in your own way

Talk to me
Don't shut me out, please!
You have to know
You don't have to face this alone
I am here, just let go of your fear
While the ice is cold let the memories unfold

Talk to me before it's too late
While the ice is cold you don't have to face this alone
