This day and this feeling, weÂ´re back to the start
I havenÂ´t seen stop sings, have we gone too far?
Feels like a rain without a cloud
When she screams out of the sound
These things aren+t meant to be explained, no

I act like a stranger in disguise
Lead her to a nightmare she donÂ´t wanna wake 
IÂ´ve been out of line in a star-crossed path
WonÂ´t get any closer to her heart
We will cross the line

I am chasing the shadow while IÂ´m dancing away
I see a stranger in me
Rain feels clolder again
Tell me why should i ever even try anymore
To lay my pride on the line
HeavenÂ´t Cried ever since I ainÂ´t been myself

So much rejection makes me numb
CanÂ´t shed any tears, IÂ´ve got to scape
Hypnotic dreams are about to come real
Misty delusions only to see
WeÂ´ve crossed the line for good

I am chasing the shadow while IÂ´m dancing away
I see a stranger in me
Rain feels colder again
Tell me why should I ever even try anymore
To lay my pride on the line
HeavenÂ´t cried ever since i ainÂ´t been myseld

Why should I take the pain again? Oh!

Im chasing the shadow while IÂ´m dancing away
I see a stranfer in me
Rain feels colder again
Tell me why should I ever even try anymore
To lay my pride on the line
HeavenÂ´t cried ever since I ainÂ´t been myself
