Like I wouldn't have time to admit to myself
I've been too long on this road on my own
The wound inside, but no sign of a scar
I've missed my last exit and again
Love's not on my way

The home I left behind milestones ago
Is somewhere still near me I know
The dubiety if I'll ever be safe and sound
I have to realize this travel, this travel's gone too long
Gone too long

Love's not on my way
Though I barely move on

I keep on dreaming every night
Not pull the breaks on my chance for love
Another man would've cried
But I won't, I don't, I won't grieve

Beneath my longing heartbeat
The rhyme is dressed to be in disguise
It's above board to say
Love's not on my way

Far away beneath my heartbeat
The rhyme is dressed to be in disguise
It's always the same
Love's not on my way

Love's not on my way
Though I barely move on
I keep on dreaming every night
Not pull the breaks on my chance for love
Anther man would cry
But love's not, love's not, love's not here

Oh, I keep on dreaming
Another day or night
But love's not, love's not, love's not on my way

Far away I know I've gone too long
