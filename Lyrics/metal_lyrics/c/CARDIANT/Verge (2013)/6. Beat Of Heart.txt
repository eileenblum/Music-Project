Caught in crosswinds of northern typhoon
A sullen strike straight through the heart
Running out ways for saying farewell
Dreading the order to part

IÂ´ve burned a wall of roses
All my diamonds have turned to glass Not a crusade for my lifetime
Time for peace at last

Oh and so the line has been drawn
I will leave my yesterdays
Tomorrow IÂ´ll be gone

One Last beat of heart
Sun will set
Beloved death coming for us all

I may scream but no one listens
Once again the battle was lost
In low water I canÂ´t hold on
Clear the skies for the frost

Oh the end is here, time to move on
I will leave my yesterdays
Tomorrow IÂ´ll be gone
One last beat of heart

Close my eyes
Leave the lies and fall

Hear the one last beat of heart
Sun will set
Beloved death coming for us all

Oh somehow IÂ´ll find myself again back in the herd
And oh, itÂ´s never black or white
So curse your loving heart
You would not let me part

Once las beat of heart
Close my eyes
Leave the lies and fall
Hear the one last beat of a hear
Sun will set
Beloved death coming for us all
