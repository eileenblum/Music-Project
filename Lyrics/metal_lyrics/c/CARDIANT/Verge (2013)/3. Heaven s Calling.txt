I can play whit the fire 
And Keep the flame in the rain
But your heart and your soul Im not able to win

I am dealing whit Devil
By giving an eye for an eye
IÂ´m afraid by tonight itÂ´ll be over

When youÂ´are alone at night
Please turn on the lights for me
And IÂ´ll be there for thee
ItÂ´s an easy way out
ItÂ´s an easy way out from here

I lift my gaze into the sky
HeavenÂ´s calling!
Thought I hava one more life to go
ItÂ´s a collect call!
I thought my time has yet to come

I was born under blank stars
Drew my star chart by myself
Roaring thunder came out of the blue!
WonÂ´t leave behind no broken path
Cause things I want to retain 
Are with me now and forever

When youÂ´re Â´lone at night

Please turn on the lights for me 
And IÂ´ll be there for thee
ItÂ´s an easy way out
ItÂ´s an easy way out from here

I lift my gaze into the sky
HeavenÂ´s calling
Thought I have one more life to go
ItÂ´s a collect call!
IÂ´d rather fight against the time
HeavenÂ´s calling!
I veil my soul in all of my glory
Cause tonight heavenÂ´s calling me

When you Â´re Â´lone at night
Please turn the lights for me
And IÂ´ll be there for thee
ItÂ´s an easy way out
ItÂ´s an easy way out from here

Tonight I am all alone my friend
This night is final for the moments IÂ´ve roamed

I lay my gaze into the sky
HeavenÂ´s calling!
Thought I have one more life to go
ItÂ´s a collect call!!
No use to fight against the time
HeavenÂ´s calling!
I thought I had more life to go
ItÂ´s a collect call!
No use to fight against the time
HeavenÂ´s calling!
I veil my soul in all of my glory
Cause tonight heavenÂ´s calling me

ItÂ´s calling me!
