Stranger's eyes
Stranger's thoughts, not mine
Feels so cruel
I can't wield my moves

How does it feel
To allow the trespasser to restrain your will
And to let him under your skin
Break your mind
Or they will break your lifetime
Cannot make the difference
I just know what I've seen

Can you feel
Can you foresee the change in me
Don't despise
Please don't just leave me be

How does it feel
Breaking the silence without innocence
You have lost your chance in our time

Break your mind
Or they will break your lifetime
Cannot make the difference
I just know what I've seen

Unchain your heart
Or they'll unchain your mind
I cannot make the difference
Between past and today

Unchain your heart
Unchain your mind
