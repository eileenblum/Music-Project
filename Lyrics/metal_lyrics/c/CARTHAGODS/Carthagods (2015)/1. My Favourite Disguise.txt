My question...what would you feel
When someone comes to blow your mind away
With a frozen brain would you conceal?
The silent war beside your growing pain

Between all the burning fires
The ice froze your deepest desires
And now you are nothing but an empty soul
Crying down the walls

Fear chained your free mind and still
Tainting your eyes with lost memories
Brought you in a tornado of lies
'Til you take off your favourite disguise

Follow...is all what you do
The stream is guiding you strait into hell
Like all mankind, you need to show
You're not the one they think but the one they'll know

Behind all your smily faces
You're burying all human races
And still you are nothing but an empty soul
Crying down the walls

Fear chained your free mind and still
Tainting your eyes with lost memories
Brought you in a tornado of lies
'Til you take off your favourite disguise
