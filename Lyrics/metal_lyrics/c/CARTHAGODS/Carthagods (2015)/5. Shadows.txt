Close to you but you can't see
Shadows coming from the past
It's something that you can just feel
Don't even think that you can touch

Death expending all the earth
Lost souls will take your soul away
Bewailing the day of your birth
All your life you'll keep wandering

God help me I'm in fear, have pity on my soul
My eyes are bleeding from tears, I'm going in a deep fall

Hell is here, upon your mind
Though you feel the flames inside
Searing you all your corp
You won't know but you'll get lost
Gone insane, gone insane

The shadows drawn me, down in a hole
And sold my spirit to a gloomy haze
Among my anger and my believe
Than I heard the voices from the burning hell

Saying, run, runaway before they get you, before you die
Run away, before you fade and silence will lock our faith in Obliviland

God help me I'm in fear, have pity on my soul
My eyes are bleeding from tears, I'm going in a deep fall
