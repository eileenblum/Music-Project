A falling drop of tear,
Overfilled the cup of pain,
I heard you were alone,
And the walls became too close,
An abandoned scream came out,
But none's there to heal,no
The growing harm you held, within your dying heart.

You see the world differently, this might be your sin.
In this world of slavery, none wanted to come in.
No matter what your choice is, your path is already done
But it was hard for you to see, that you've been a mere puppet.

The time is passing by, in this life we're living in
We fight to reach the shore, the shore of a dreamland.

Scanning all the streets,
With faceless people in...
You feel the cold again
How lonely you'll remain.
A silent tear cascades
But none's there to see,
This empty space in you, the burden you're carrying.

The time is passing by, in this life we're living in
We fight to reach the shore, the shore of a dreamland.

The roads we're going in, are blowing us apart.
Like little smithereens
Throughout this shadowland we are drifting one by one...
