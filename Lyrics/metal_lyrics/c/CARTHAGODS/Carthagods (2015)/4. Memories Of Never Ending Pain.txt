Melodious voices, passing through my ears
Blowing me there, to my unforgotten tears
Lonely body, traced by old scars
Appeared so clearly, on my frozen corps.

Different faces, I don't know who I am
Broken visions paralyzed my sight
Brought me so far beyond a somber space
Ripping my soul into smithereens

The memories of never ending pains
The memories of never ending pains
The memories of never ending pains

You guided me blind, into nothingness
Lost in silence, flowing crimson tears
I tramped so long to found my way back home
And finally I know, my home is deep in you

The memories of never ending pains
The memories of never ending pains
The memories of never ending pains
