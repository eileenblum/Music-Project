Look at me standing, here in the dark
Walking against your, cold frozen winds
Dancing your soul to nothingness
Welcome to dying, here's my revenge

I've never been the one you're looking for
I'll never be your slave
I'm the one who'll kill you once more
And bring down your grave

Once I believed your, sweet masquerade
Surrendered my fragile heart to your golden chains
Never expected I could fall so high
I fed you dreams and you fed me lies.

I've never been the one you're looking for
I'll never be your slave
I'm the one who'll kill you once more
And bring down your grave

I've never been the one you're looking for
I'll never be your slave
I'm the one who'll kill you once more
And bring down your grave

I'll dig your grave with my burry hands
And I'll seal you down in the depths of hell...

I'll dig your grave with my burry hands
And I'll seal you down in the depths of hell...
