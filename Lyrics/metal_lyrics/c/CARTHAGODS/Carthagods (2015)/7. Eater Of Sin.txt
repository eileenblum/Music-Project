Era after Era, we get weaker deep inside, inside
Era after Era, I thought one day we'll be alright

But the time is going fast
None knows how it goes down
And tomorrow will never come
And the sun will never rise

Should spend our live in the dark
Should we walk the path they chose

Blinded powerless and slavedâ¦

No, our minds are free, you can control everything but mentality
We came here to make our own destiny, none will nor can change our trend

Hide before we arrive there's danger
We rose up from the hell of eternal anger
Bringing up the end of destruction wars
Then we'll make a new starting line

Warriors since our birth, addicted to protect the earth
Humans lost truly the brains, our focus is to end the game

Fall in a the deepest hell of pain
All you worth is to burn below heavy rain
And you'll suffer infinitely eater of sin
'Til you'll beg bitterly for your death

Killers of all human being, creatures of hate and disease
Throttled the feelings and mind, breath deep the heat 'til you burn

We are approaching the ko, and none knows the road
No need for a candle to lead, all we need is a prophet to guide us
'Til the endâ¦
