Traumatic strife
Who knows who lies
And where is this light
That will never go out!

My sense of duty
Lets me go
Free myself

The further I go
From what I expect
The brighter it gets
All cleaned from insects

I've learnt to sail through
The sea that's created before me
I've lost my tolerance
Will and desire

So now,
I'm the light
Of my own path
