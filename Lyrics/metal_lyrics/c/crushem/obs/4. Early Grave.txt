One man borns, first he cries.
With consciousness
He learns to smile
Of all the places
He breathes on Earth
Dwelling with fear
Far from birth

Fields to be seen
And to be reached
Neighborhood is wide
He won't die here

To save desperate lives
He'll sacrifice
A beam of light
And fluid sounds

This quest has come to the end
It is time to disappear
Spheres are weak, stars are faint
He will bleed if he stays!
