Feeding myself with cold
There's no hand for me to hold
I'm in the middle of the storm
I wont conform, I'm out of norm!

After all these years
The smoke around me clears
It seems you're highly obsessed
With absolute obedience

I've been forced into
A life that is not mine
Empty words you threw 
They've all become my spine

Even if I'm free
Within, I feel the agony
The cure is unsupplied
I should get out of here without the key

The seed you planted is corrupt
Never to be healed
The region you selected; erupted!
You'll find out what you need to learn

Your dream is not my dream
Being controlled is being confined
Questioning how I feel
Treating myself for real
Aligning my mistakes
Anxiety awakes
Wish I was not tamed!
