It won't get off my mind
It's pulling me inside

I can't escape this pain

It's too late to be saved
You can't be fucking saved

Something I can't ignore
The feeling I adore
It's pulling me inside
It won't get off my mind

Can you feel the height?
Embrace it, you taste it, face it
It makes me feel alive
It's building, and burning, inside
Open up your eyes
Forsaken, you're taken, you're blind
Now don't you feel alive?
Scream it, you mean it, you're mine

It won't leave my head
Oh god....
Why won't it leave my fucking head?

Can you feel the height?
Embrace it, you taste it, face it
It makes me feel alive
It's building, and burning, inside
Open up your eyes
Forsaken, you're taken, you're blind
Now don't you feel alive?
Scream it, you mean it, you're mine

This curse
Making my heart soon burst
The thirst
I've never felt it hurt worse
We tried
God we fucking tried
But inside
We're dying just to feel that high
I'm dying just to fuck my mind
Cause God, it makes me feel so right

Can you feel the height?
Embrace it, you taste it, face it
It makes me feel alive
It's building, and burning, inside
Open up your eyes
Forsaken, you're taken, you're blind
Now don't you feel alive?
Scream it, you mean it, you're mine
