[iTunes Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]Did you ever think that you'd be where you are today?
Did you ever dream that you'd be something really great?
But then it fades, and you except reality
And you can't keep a straight face
Swallow another pill, say it's OK
Everything will be OK

What have I done?
I just want to run
I feel like an empty shell
Created my own hell
Lost inside myself
Knowing that I failed
This is how it feels

Living the American dream
What do you think?
Is it everything you thought it would be?

Swallow another pill, say it's OK
Everything will be OK

What have I done?
I just want to run
I feel like an empty shell
Created my own hell
Lost inside myself
Knowing that I failed
This is how it feels

And I know I fucking failed myself
I can't feel a thing anymore

What have I done?
I just want to run
I feel like an empty shell
Created my own hell
Lost inside myself
Knowing that I failed
This is how it feels

Living the American dream
Is it everything you thought it would be?
