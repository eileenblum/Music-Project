All roads have lead us here
Through hardship, through these years
We've spilt our own blood
Hellbent on getting up

You all have doubted us
You've disrespected us
But we are here to stay
And you will know our name

The words I speak, sincere
So let me make this clear
We never needed you
You know it's fucking true
You've got a lot of nerve
I can't wait to watch you burn

You're gonna scream our name
Come on scream our name
Our fame will be your pain
Everything's about to change

Fuck the media
Fuck your magazine
Fuck your whole team
That's right
You all don't mean shit to me

You don't mean a god damn thing to us
We have nothing to lose
We never needed you

And we don't give a fuck

Talk your shit
You have no spine
Eye to eye you would be mine
You will be mine

You're gonna scream our name
Come on scream our name
Our fame will be your pain
Everything's about to change

Fuck the media
Fuck your magazine
Fuck your whole team
That's right
You all don't mean shit to me

So there's my two cents
I'm glad I got it out
Here's another fucking song that you can talk about

I did your fucking work for you
Go ahead and publish every word I said to you
Emphasize the fact that you're a fucking bitch
And while you're at it you can publish this dick
