Welcome back
Looking at ourselves
We look like someone else
We're drowning in our sorrow
With every fault we swallow

Feeling dead inside
It's something I can't hide
We are living for today
We don't care about tomorrow
We don't care about tomorrow no
We're just living for today

Welcome back
We've done this all before
I haven't found the cure
And I've never been so sure

Hit the ground
Rock bottom's where I'm bound
It's something I accept
Like the promises we never kept
We don't care anymore
We could give a fuck less about
We're just living for today

Welcome back
We've done this all before
I haven't found the cure
And I've never been so sure

Hit the ground
Rock bottom's where I'm bound
It's something I accept
Like the promises we never kept
I just don't care anymore
I could give a fuck less about being cured

Slowly kill ourselves
We tried to change but failed
We're drowning our sorrow
With every fault we swallow
It can't be denied
Our mind has long since died
We're just living for today
We don't care about tomorrow

We don't care anymore
We can give a fuck less about being cured
