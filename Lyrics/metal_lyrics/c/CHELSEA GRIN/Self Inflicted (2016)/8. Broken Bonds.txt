I lay in shame
Tried to forget all of this pain
But I don't care anymore
No I don't give a fuck anymore

You broke my heart
You broke my soul
You broke me down and now I'm in this hole
Orchestrated all my pain
Devastated I lay in shame

There's not a person I can trust in this world
And I don't really give a fuck anymore
Fuck my trust fuck my hope
I'll feel better after letting go

There's not a person I can trust in this world
And I don't really give a fuck anymore
I've seen friends come and go
And I'm not falling for it anymore

Everything you said
Everything you've done
Did it mean anything?
Did it fucking mean anything at all?!

Everything you said
Everything you've done

I lay in shame
Tried to forget all of this pain
But I don't care anymore
No I don't give a fuck anymore

Get the fuck out of my life
I don't wanna see your face anymore
Stay the fuck out of my mind
A waste of breath on a wasted whore

There's not a person I can trust in this world
And I don't really give a fuck anymore
Fuck my trust fuck my hope
I'll feel better after letting go

There's not a person I can trust in this world
And I don't really give a fuck anymore
I've seen friends come and go
And I'm not falling for it anymore
Anymore

And I'm not fucking that bitch anymore
And I'm not fucking that bitch anymore
