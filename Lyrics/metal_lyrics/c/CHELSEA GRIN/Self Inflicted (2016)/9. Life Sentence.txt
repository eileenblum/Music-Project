I am my worst enemy
I am not who you choose to see
I am your worst enemy
You have been fooled, you have been deceived

I can't hide it anymore
Yes I can, I've done it all before
I can't hide it anymore
Yes I can, I've done it all before

Take another drink
Let it all just sink
Sink, sink
Let it sink in
Pretend to be a better man
But you're just a fake, fake
Your whole life is fake

Who am I
Who are you
Who are they
What am I suppose to be
I've lost it all
I don't know what's wrong with me
I've lost it all
Who am I suppose to be?!

I am my worst enemy
I am not who you choose to see
I am your worst enemy
You have been fooled, you've been deceived

I can't hide it anymore
Yes I can, I've done it all before
I can't hide it anymore
Yes I can, I've done it all before

Take another drink
Let it all just sink
Sink, sink
Sink, sink, sink
Pretend to be a better man
But you're just a fake

Just a fucking fake

Who am I
Who are you
Who are they
What am I suppose to be

I've lost it all
I don't know what's wrong with me
I've lost it all
Who am I suppose to be?!

Take another drink
Let it all just sink
Sink sink
Sink sink sink
Pretend to be a better man
But you're just a fake
You are just a fake
Fake
Fake. Make believe

Fuck my life
And fuck my thoughts
Inside of my head I'll forever be lost
Fuck you all
Fuck what's been said
Behind a closed door my body lays dead
