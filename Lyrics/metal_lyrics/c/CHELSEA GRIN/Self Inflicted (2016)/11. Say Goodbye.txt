I hear the screams
It's time to say goodbye
Despite our cries
We're left behind to die

This was the hardest thing for me to accept
I thought I did my time, I thought I paid my debts
But then I realized there was nothing I could do to be pure to you
I'm not good enough for you

I can't believe I ever listened to your shit
I must have read you wrong, I must have never fit
And I've suffered for too long for you
We lost our lives we fucking died for you

I hear the screams
Cut through the trees
Outside
Kiss your love, and say goodbye

Despite our cries
We're left behind
To die
Watch your family burn alive

I hear the screams
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
Despite our cries
We're left behind to die
You left us all behind

We broke our backs
We gave our souls to you
What the fuck did we get from you
What's left to prove
All that we want is truth
So tell the fucking truth

I hear the screams
Cut through the trees
Outside
Kiss your love, and say goodbye

Despite our cries
We're left behind to die
Watch your family burn alive
I hear the screams
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye

Despite our cries
We're left behind to die
You left us all behind
And I suffered for too long for you
We lost our lives, we fucking died for you
