We are the ones who ride
We're cold we're dead inside
In darkness we arise
Bringing this world's demise

We are the heartless ones
We don't fear anyone
In darkness we arise
Bringing this world's demise

And behold a pale horse
His name was death
And hell followed with him
We bring this world's demise
Demise
Demise
From shadows we arise
Arise, arise
Welcome the anti-Christ

Watch as the ashes hit the ground
You can't scream, can't make a sound
Praying desperately, that it's all just a dream
But you can't be saved, it's just you and me

Head keeps spinning round, and round
Inside of our thoughts you too shall drown
We've waiting for this day, it's the feeling we so crave
Crying with distaste, as you're falling from your grace

Rivers flow with virgin blood
Sacrifice your first son
Burn the pages you so love
Hell fire reigns from above

We are the ones who ride
We're cold we're dead inside
In darkness we arise
Bringing this world's demise

We are the heartless ones
We don't fear anyone
In darkness we arise
Bringing this world's demise

We bring this world's demise
Demise
Demise
From shadows we arise
Welcome the anti-Christ
