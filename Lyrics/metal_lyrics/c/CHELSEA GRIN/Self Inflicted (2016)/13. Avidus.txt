[iTunes Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]You're my favorite game
You fuck away my pain
Purity ceases to be
Just fuck me 'til I'm sane

An angel without name
Embracing demon bane
Turning on the ones you love
To get a taste of hell

Breathing down your neck
Your scent is taunting me
Filling me with everlasting lust
Your skin, your touch, the thrill, I must!

Blood drips off your teeth
Your wings are soaked in red
I've waited years to have you all alone
Desire deep in skin and bone

Nothing left to lose
Crawl to me my muse
We play this day
In endless rain

Laughing at the thought
As Eden turns to rot
The love, the hate
The agony!

[2x]
You're my favorite game
You fuck away my pain
Purity ceases to be
Just fuck me 'til I'm sane
An angel without name
Embracing demon bane
Turning on the ones you love
To get a taste of hell

[4x]
A crime I now confess
Lay us down to rest
Send us to an unmarked grave
Our souls be damned and never saved
