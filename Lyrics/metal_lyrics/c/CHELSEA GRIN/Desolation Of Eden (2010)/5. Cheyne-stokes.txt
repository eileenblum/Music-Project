This will be your bleak dissolution I will rid the world of your filth
And I will scourge you with no remorse and I'll abolish all the pain you caused by your pillage of the innocent
And your fate will not be very quick grisly horrors will fall burn
I'll make your insides on the fucking outside
I'll rip through your skin and watch you rot so where's your pleasure now?
It's not so pleasing when you are the one at the end of this misery
Oh but it is for me to sit and watch you bleed so say your final prayer but I will promise you
God can't show you where to hide.
