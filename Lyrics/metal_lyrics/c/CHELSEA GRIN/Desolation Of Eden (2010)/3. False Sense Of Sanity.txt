Looking in the mirror you begin to contemplate your sanity last nights horrors were far to much for you to fucking take
You cry out in terror, corpses all around but you can't remember a thing
Who caused this crime?
Just then you look down and see the blood stained on your hands and clothes
Panicking you begin to run this can't be it must be a dream
But you're not just going to let this happen so you turn your back you won't accept this
So you put the bodies in the walls and under the floor boards no one will ever know what went on this horrible night
Sitting in the corner you don't know what's real are all these things just in your head?
No way to tell you try to forget it and get it out of your head you try to convince yourself nothing was true
It's just a dream nothing is real you awake and sit there in fear Never to speak of this again because it's all just in your head.
