Why are we here?
A question that no one will ever answer so think for your fucking self
Don't believe something just because someone told you to and don't be scared into living someone else's way
Don't just say the things you're suppose to say speak for yourself and never give that right away
I'm so sick of hearing people say how I should live my life and if I don't follow their rules I will suffer the consequence
I will live the way I want to and there's nothing you can say or do that will change me or the way I think
So save it for someone else
Never be afraid to open up your mind and look at the world through someone else's eyes
This is something you should never forget
If so then it's not really your life anymore
Don't just say the things you're suppose to say speak for yourself and never give that right away
Don't just say the things you're suppose to say speak for yourself and never give that right away
Speak for yourself
