Your dress is lined with blood,
You look so much better in red.
And with your throat open,
Your body twitches and squirms,
As you suffocate on your own blood.
With your last thoughts I hope you think of everything I've ever done for you,
And how you left me to lie in my buried agony.
I will never let myself sink that low again.
But I'll let my knife sink deeper for reparations you bitch.
Your eyes are getting heavy,
But I won't let this end so quickly no,
I want to watch your suffer.
I see your lifeless corpse,
And I can't help but laugh.
You brought this upon yourself,
Another wretched soul being slowly dragged to hell.
This is the last life you fuck,
You're dead you fucking slut.
