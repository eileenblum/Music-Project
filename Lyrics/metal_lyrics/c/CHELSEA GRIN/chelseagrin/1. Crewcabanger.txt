Useless waste of human flesh,
Fucking everything you see.
Body like an hourglass,
But a soul just like a succubus.
No, I will not fall victim to your disease,
Or your hideous vagina trap.
Like fucking a malady filled gangrenous wound,
I want nothing to do with you.
Love is dead instead,
You'd rather give head.
You stupid trick,
I will end this.
You're life is meaningless.
Love is dead instead,
You'd rather give head.
Useless waste of human flesh.
I will end this
