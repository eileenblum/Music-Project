Now it's time we do or die
Rise [2x]
We wont change a fucking thing
Fight [2x]
Break your chains and we will rise
Rise [2x]
I'm just as sick as you believe
And I will burn your world

For you to see, I am your enemy
We don't need society's approval
Just a face, we are unstoppable

We will live and we will die
Rise [2x]
You can never take our pride
Fight [2x]
Cut us deep and watch us bleed
Rise [2x]
I'm just as sick as you believe
And I will burn your world

For you to see, I am your enemy
We don't need society's approval
Just a face, we are unstoppable

I, I don't care if you approve of the life I lead
I, I don't care
I don't care to hold my tongue anymore

This is my fucking life and this is my fucking dream
And I'm not your society's little fucking whore
I, I don't care if I have a life left to live
I will join the dead and we will rise up

Now it's time we do or die
Rise [2x]
We wont change a fucking thing
Fight [2x]
Break our chains and we will rise
Rise [2x]
I'm just as sick as you believe

And I will burn your world, for you to see
I am your enemy
We don't need society's approval
Just a face, we are unstoppable
