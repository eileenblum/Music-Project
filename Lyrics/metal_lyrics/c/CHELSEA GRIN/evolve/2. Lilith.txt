Your body is my temptress
Your being is a must
I cannot live another day without you

I'd give it up for just one touch
To see your face
To feel your lust calling me
She won't stop calling
I feel her crawling inside
She won't stop calling

Come and watch my lips turn blue
I wrote this song just for you
It's what you've made me create
I'm drowning in the well
Of my sins and my selfishness

I can't forget when I felt you
It was clear to me that I need you

Fuck this world
And fuck this place

I never asked for this
I never wanted this
I never asked for you
I never wanted you
[x2]

But the longing keeps on drawing me back

In your hands again [x3]

I can't forget when I felt you
It was clear to me that I need you

I can't forget the things that you put me through
I can't forget [x2]
I don't regret the poison that set me free
I don't regret [x2]

Your body is my temptress
Your being is a must
I can't live, live another day without you

I CAN'T!!!
