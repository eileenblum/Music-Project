Now I must confess, I'm not the person you believe me to be.
It's no surprise that I couldn't be what you wished I could have been.
No one knows me. I am toxic. Sick, sick

And while I'm here, I might as well come clean listen closely to what I really mean.
These hands were never, meant to save.
The deepest darkest hole could never handle my past.
Fuck.

I'm not strong enough, to hold them back anymore.
I'm not strong enough, to hold them back anymore.
Trust in me and I will break you, Trust in me, and I'll only hurt you.
You can't handle what I am, I wish you didn't see, but my mask must be put down.
Here's to my hopes and dreams.

And while I'm here, I might as well come clean listen closely to what I really mean.
These hands were never, meant to save.
The deepest darkest hole could never handle my past.

Now I must confess, no one knows me. I am toxic.
I am sick, sick, sick. I am toxic, I'm sick (sick, sick, sick).
