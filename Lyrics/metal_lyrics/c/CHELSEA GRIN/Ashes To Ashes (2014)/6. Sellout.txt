This is the conversation
This is the time to talk
You have been lying all along
Youâre not an inspiration
Itâs time to walk the walk
Iâll force the truth out with this song

So fuck your role models
And fuck the scene too
I hate your morals,
I hate everything about you
Fuck your money
And fuck your music too
I hate your message
And pretending that I like you

Stop your bullshit
Shut your mouth
Youâre overrated and foul
Fuck you, fuck you

So fuck your role models
And fuck the scene too
I hate your morals
I hate everything about you
Fuck your money
And fuck your music too
I hate your message
And pretending that I like you

When it comes time to fall
Where will your heroes be
And when youâre found
Crawling on your knees for thieves
Where will your heroes be

Ride your high horse straight to hell

This is my declaration
This is the final straw
Iâm standing up for whom youâve wronged
Iâm here to send a message
You better watch your back
You know exactly who you are

So fuck your role models
And fuck the scene too
I hate your morals
I hate everything about you
Iâll fight your dad
And fuck your mother too
I hate your message
And pretending that I like you

When it comes time to fall
Where will your heroes be
And when youâre found
Crawling on your knees for thieves
Where will your heroes be
