The time becomes frozen
As your bones are broken
I am your master, I am your bane
Iâm breathing the smoke in
From the depths of this prison
But you were the key and now Iâm set free

Look in my eyes, stare at my face
I am the one who haunts you at night
Your angel of death, and soon you'll be mine

Look in my eyes, stare at my face
I am your sin, I am your faith
I've brought the carriage to take you away

Look in my eyes, stare at my face
I am your life, I am your breath
I am the reaper the angel of death

The feeling of despair
Sinks deep in this nightmare
You are my darling, you are my slave
Your skin begins to tear
For the love that we now share
My touch is your key
And now youâre set free

Fear me, for I am the angel of death

Look in my eyes, stare at my face
I am the one who haunts you at night
Your angel of death, and soon you'll be mine

Look in my eyes, stare at my face
I am your sin, I am your faith
I've brought the carriage to take you away

Look in my eyes, stare at my face
I am your life, I am your breath
I am the reaper the angel of death
