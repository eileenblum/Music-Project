I hear them say
They say that you were never real
You look at me
And whisper bliss into my ear
So they say
They say that time will always heal
But look at me
And ask me how I really feel

I can't stop time!
I can't relive my past!
Iâm left with a vacant memory of
How my life is moving way too fast

Turn back, it's just like clockwork
Watch me kiss my youth goodbye
All I wanted was to turn back time

The time lays waste to ashes
My soul lays waste the broken mind
The time lays waste to ashes
My soul lays waste the broken mind

Turn back, it's just like clockwork
Watch me kiss my youth goodbye
All I wanted was to turn back time

I'm begging on my knees!
Turn back! Turn back
Oh won't you spare me please!
Iâm pleading! Iâm grieving!

I can't fulfill my eternity
Eternity please, let me be
Just let me live again

Turn back, it's just like clockwork
Watch me kiss my youth goodbye
All I wanted was to turn back time

We'll say our good byes
Than slowly lay down to die
Our lives like clockwork
Another second simply flies on by

Goodbye!

And now they'll say!
They'll say that I was never real
Forgotten life!
A song that no one sang again
And I will be
A memory that will never heal
I turn to god
She whispers bliss into my ear

It's just like clockwork
Just let me go, let me go

The time lays waste to ashes
My soul lays waste the broken mind
