Open up my mind
Clear it of intention
I believed the lies
And fell for a deception of hope

Take me, only you can bring hope
Change deliverance from my pain
Deliverance from my pain

Save me, show me what you see
For hope, for change
Itâs time we took the stage

Itâs time I fight, fight
And stand up on my own two feet
Make them bleed, and I refuse
To let this be the end of me

Show me the light, light
Iâm calling out to see your face
Show me your face, no more abuse
Our path in life is ours to choose

Free me from this life

I donât want to be afraid
I just want to be something
Something new

Itâs time I fight, fight
And stand up on my own two feet
Make them bleed, and I refuse
To let this be the end of me

Show me the light, light
Iâm calling out to see your face
Show me your face, no more abuse
Our path in life is ours to choose

Itâs time I fight
And stand up on my own two feet
And I refuse to let this be the end of me

I cannot resist
The urge to be like this

I just want to be redeemed
Iâll wipe away my tears
And overcome my fears

The time has come for me
To stand on my own two feet

And I donât need to be
The freak that no one sees

Itâs time I fight, fight
And stand up on my own two feet
Make them bleed, and I refuse
To let this be the end of me

Show me the light, light
Iâm calling out to see your face
Show me your face, no more abuse
Our path in life is ours to choose

Itâs time I fight
And stand up on my own two feet
And I refuse to let this be the end of me
