Angels shall sin, demons shall pray
They came for our voice, and took it away

Our silent screams, our silent goodbye
They took our hope, they took our freedom
Wrapped us in chains
They took our hope, they took our freedom
We're not the same, we'll never be the same

I don't want be you
I don't want to see you
You say you're close to god?
I'd really like to meet him
I don't want to be you
I don't want to see you
I'm tired of all the shame
This time our voices will be heard!

They took our hope, they took our freedom
Wrapped us in chains
They took our hope, they took our freedom
We're not the same, we'll never be the same

I don't want be you
I don't want to see you
You say you're close to god?
I'd really like to meet him
I don't want to be you
I don't want to see you
I'm tired of all the shame
This time our voices will be heard

Scream my name, feel my pain
Iâll bleed you dry of faith

Call us by our name!
We are not the same
Call us by our name!
We're over playing games bitch
