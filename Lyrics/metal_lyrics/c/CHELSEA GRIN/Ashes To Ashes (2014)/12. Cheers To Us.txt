Weâll all be dead some day
So sing this song with me
Live up tonight, right;
Donât make me say it twice

So climb up out of that hole
Your shame has taken its toll
Pick up your glass
And drink it down, down, down

Cheers to us

Brothers and sisters
I wrote this one for you
You donât have to be alone
Youâre not alone

So climb up out of that hole
Your shame has taken its toll
Pick up your glass
And drink it down, down, down

This life just ainât for us
Get up, and shake off that dust
This oneâs for you
Now drink it down, down, down

This oneâs for you

Get up and scream with me
Hey, hey, hey
I wanna hear you sing
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

Brothers and sisters
I will always be there for you
Weâre in this thing together
So sing it with me

So climb up out of that hole
Your shame has taken its toll
Pick up your glass
And drink it down, down, down

This life just ainât for us
Get up, and shake off that dust
This oneâs for you
Now drink it down, down, down

Cheers to us

Nowâs your time
Make your choice
Let me hear your voice
Yeah

Hereâs to another day
Hey, hey, hey
Sing one more time with me
Hey, hey, hey, hey
