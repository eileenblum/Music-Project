Come to me with bloodlust
Let me quench your thirst
Black roses fall around us
Let me be your first

Fill your needs, as the rest of us bleed
Donât be scared, my love
Donât you speak, just for now you must feed
Take it in my love

Arise and take flight
Itâs love at first sight
Crucified in sadness
Unholy wings we fly

You need it, you breathe it
You feed it, my love
You see it, embrace it
My bride undead

You shall be the shepherd
Lead them all to hell
Black roses fall around us
Your beauty has prevailed

Fill your needs, as the rest of us bleed
Donât be scared, my love
Donât you speak, just for now you must feed
Take it in my love

Cry to me undying
Cry to me undying love

Arise and take flight
Itâs love at first sight
Crucified in sadness
Unholy wings we fly

You need it, you breathe it
You feed it, my love
You see it, embrace it
My bride undead

You need it, you breathe it
You feed it, my love
You see it, embrace it
My undead bride

Arise and take flight
Itâs love at first sight
Crucified in sadness
Unholy wings we fly

You need it, you breathe it
You feed it, my love
You see it, embrace it
My bride undead

You need it, you breathe it
You feed it, my love
You see it, embrace it
My bride undead

Arise and take flight
Itâs love at first sight
Crucified in sadness
Unholy wings we fly

You need it, you breathe it
You feed it, my love
You see it, embrace it
My bride undead
