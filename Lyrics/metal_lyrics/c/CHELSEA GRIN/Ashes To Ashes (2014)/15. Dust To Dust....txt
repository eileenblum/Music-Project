I wonât be beaten or broken
Iâll reclaim what was stolen
This is who Iâve become
What once was weak is now strong

I stare from my window looking outside
Sometimes I wanna just die
I feel like Iâm rotting on the inside
Too much has passed me on by

I canât keep living life like this
Thereâs too many things that I have missed
With these words Iâll make one last wish
Take my regret and grant me lifeâs kiss

This is who I am

I wonât be beaten or broken
Iâll reclaim what was stolen
This is who Iâve become
What once was weak is now strong

As I look at myself in the mirror
I have never seen my life so clear
This is the face of what I have become
I accept fate and refuse to run

This is who I am

I wonât be beaten or broken
Iâll reclaim what was stolen
This is who Iâve become
What once was weak is now strong

I canât erase my mistakes
But I wonât bend, I wonât break
This is who Iâve become

This is what I am
This is my life
This is who Iâve become

I wonât be beaten or broken
Iâll reclaim what was stolen
This is who Iâve become
What once was weak is now strong

I canât erase my mistakes
But I wonât bend, I wonât break
This is who Iâve become
