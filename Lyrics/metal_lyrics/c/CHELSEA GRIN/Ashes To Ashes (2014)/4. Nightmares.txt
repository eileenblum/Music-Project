Iâm haunted by my wildest dreams
Iâm haunted by whatâs living inside me
Iâm haunted by my wildest dreams
Iâm haunted by whatâs living inside me

Iâve witnessed the thing living in my dream
Itâs fighting and clawing itâs way out of me
Iâve witnessed the thing living in my dream
Itâs fighting and clawing itâs way out of me

My dreams paint very vivid pictures of
Something stalking me, am I insane?
Or did I just hear someone try to talk to me

Screaming my name
Whatâs this nightmare in my head
Whatâs this nightmare name unsaid
Are you real, are you real

Iâm haunted by my wildest dreams
Iâm haunted by whatâs living inside me
Iâm haunted by my wildest dreams
Iâm haunted by whatâs living inside me

Iâve witnessed the thing living in my dream
Itâs fighting and clawing itâs way out of me
Iâve witnessed the thing living in my dream
Itâs fighting and clawing itâs way out of me

I canât tell if itâs alive or dead
But in my dreams heâll be there
Heâll always fucking be there with me

Iâve met the thing living in my dream
I have felt the fear growing inside of me

What do you want from me

Screaming my name
Whatâs this nightmare in my head
Whatâs this nightmare name unsaid
Are you real, are you real

Iâm haunted by my wildest dreams

My dreams paint very vivid pictures of
Something stalking me, am I insane?
Or did I just hear someone try to talk to me

Whatâs in my head, whatâs in your head
Whatâs in my head, whatâs in your head
Whatâs in my head, Iâm in your head
Whatâs in my head! Whatâs in my head!

Iâve witnessed the thing living in my dream
Itâs fighting and clawing itâs way out of me
Iâve witnessed the thing living in my dream
Itâs fighting and clawing itâs way out of me
