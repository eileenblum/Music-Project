Come on baby drink it down
I'm always questioning how you let me drown

You are the warmth that I adore
So sit back, relax, kick back
While we drink away our pain

Whyâd you let me drown?!

The only smile I seek comes from
The bottom of the bottle I drink

Waste away
We did it for the fun
We did it for the pain
Waste away
Let's drink until the sunlight
Casts us all away

Waste away
We did it for the fun
We did it for the pain
Waste away
Letâs drink until the sunlight
Casts us all away

I don't care what they say
Let's drink until the sunlight
Casts us all away

Waste away
We did it for the fun
We did it for the pain
Waste away
Let's drink until the sunlight
Casts us all away

Waste away
We did it for the fun
We did it for the pain
Waste away
Let's drink until the sunlight
Casts us all away

Help me, dear god won't someone help me
To stop the bleeding
Please someone take my hand
My thoughts misleading
The only demon I believe in is myself

Waste away
We did it for the fun
We did it for the pain
Waste away
Let's drink until the sunlight
Casts us all away

Waste away
We did it for the fun
WE did it for the pain
Waste away
Let's drink until the sunlight
Casts us all away
