We will lite ourselves a flame
Lite ourselves a flame as we kiss the sky

We set the fires to take us higher
We set the fires to watch them burn
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Letâs burn this bastard to the ground

Youâre my deep obsession
I'm the sweet depression
I'm your muse

Make it burn

We are the voices that ignite the masses
Scream for me, we are free
Strength in numbers, we encumber your dominion
Rightfully, I wanna hear you scream

Mercy please

I wonât stop, dead, or not
We are the voices that ignite the fucking truth

We set the fires to take us higher
We set the fires to watch them burn
Burn! Burn! Burn, burn, burn
Letâs burn this bastard to the ground

We set the fires to take us even higher
We set the fires to watch them fucking burn
Burn! Burn! Burn, burn, burn
Letâs burn this bastard to the ground

Burn it to the ground

Cleansing all the hate of the wicked
Liberate our life from oppression

Come on, make it burn

We set the fires to take us higher
we set the fires to watch them burn
Burn! Burn! Burn, burn, burn
Burn this bastard to the ground

We set the fires to take us even higher
we set the fires to watch them fucking burn
Burn! Burn! Burn, burn, burn
Letâs burn this bastard to the ground

We will lite ourselves a flame
Lite ourselves a flame, as we kiss the sky
