Break the skin with your teeth slowly
Embrace the taste of my decaying flesh
Like I embraced the taste of you
It rests inside your mouth
Decaying flesh rests inside your mouth
The sensation of my blood dripping off your tongue
I've never seen you smile so bright
Seducing me into my last breath
A portrait of perfection stained seep red by the essence of my being
Seducing me into my last breath
My last breath ends with you
Sealed by a poisoned kiss
Embrace the taste of my decaying flesh
The sensation of my blood dripping off your tongue
I've never seen you smile so bright
Seducing me into my last breath
My last breath
