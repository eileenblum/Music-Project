May the fallen rise
Burn it down
This is for the cursed ones
Rise from ash
We're the fucking cursed ones
This is fate
Welcome to the damned
We are fear
We're the fucking cursed ones
I'm the whisper inside your ear 
Apocalyptic nightmares are real
You're becoming one with the curse
I will make sure you hurt the worst
Why can't you see?
My divine destiny
The Whole world will bow down at my feet
May the fallen rise and take back what's mine
Why can't you see ? 
My divine destiny
Everyone dies
May the fallen rise
Burn it down
We're the fucking cursed ones
This is fate
Welcome to the damned
We are fear
We're the fucking cursed ones
