[feat. Philip Bozeman of Whitechapel][Feat. Phil Bozeman of Whitechapel]

[Alex]
My Declaration to Gaia.
Listen close to what I have to say.
For this isn't your biblical propaganda.

[Phil]
These are the darkest days of humanity;

[Both]
Drawing even the smartest minds to insanity.

[Phil]
My eyes have seen the glory of the fallen king.

[Both]
All hail the fallen king [x2]

Until the ashes line the sky all hail the fallen king fuck.

[Alex]
When dwelling in your worse darkness and crawling in your own filth.
We will bring upon the glory of the fallen king.
The horsemen set to make their ride.
The planet too will slowly die.
Now kneel before your sire.

[Both]
All hail the fallen king.
