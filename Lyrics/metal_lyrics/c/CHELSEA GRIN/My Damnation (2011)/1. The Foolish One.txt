I fear no god or any man who stands in my way. My way.
I fear no devils I'm not afraid of fantasy or consequence
I want it all, everything, everyone
The words i preach they will obey
I want it all they can't stop me
Let me hear them all scream
This is the setting
Here i come alone, here i come the victor
Bringing the new order
I know one thing that won't change
We have no faith in what we are
Too sick and tired of the shame
By my hand I break these god damned walls
They will not forget my god damned name
By my hand they betray
By my hand they will collapse
By my hand the weak will be enslaved
This is a tale of the foolish one
He broke the bonds of a righteous man
Now he must stay in eternal flames
Let this be a warning no one will be spared
When the time comes they will make your choice.
