[feat. Nate Johnson of Fit For An Autopsy]I am the answer to the calling deity
My master ordered thee
I am but a shadow of the man i use to be
I use to be alive
The touch of my skin is cold like the winter wind
My gaze is black as dark as sin
I am but a shadow of mankind
I am wicked
I am a creature; taunt me and you will see what hell made me 
What
What have i become?
This
This is what i am 
So dark and cold a hollow soul
So dark and cold i am alone
Alone
I am so cold
Why am i so cold?
The blood flows through
My pain consumes
I am the answer to the calling in silence
Calling in silence
No 
This can't be me
No 
What's become of me?
No
Salvation is my only key
What
What's become of me?
