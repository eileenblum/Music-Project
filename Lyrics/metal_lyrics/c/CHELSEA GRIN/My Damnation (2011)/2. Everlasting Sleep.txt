I will bleed out under moonlight
Red to pay for what I did
I lay to rest under the stars
Below me waits the loathing nemesis
Slowly building fear inside
I seek everlasting sleep
Everlasting sleep
I'm bleeding out
Call to me beauty
Make me misery
When blood seeps through every pour
I am yours forevermore
Forevermore
To be human no more.
I want you to see the scars
You can't give me peace
I seek everlasting sleep
I want you to see the scars
You can't give me peace
I seek everlasting sleep
SLEEP
When blood seeps through every pour
When blood seeps through every pour
I am yours forevermore
