I rest alone in a place I never thought I would be
I have given everything I am
Why must I feel empty
Will I ever feel again?
I have given everything I am
All must live with vivid nightmares of life after death
Plagued with images of a figure
How can I bare this?
Why must we bare this need to fulfill our nothingness they call serenity?
I want to break out of this place
To embrace this hate I shatter every mirror but yet you reappear
With a crooked smile and weathered face
The doors have been sealed shut
To keep the secrets that lie within
Through death's dark hollow I must fall to live in grave
Only when my heart stops I will truly live again
Shatter every mirror but yet you reappear
With a crooked smile and weathered face
