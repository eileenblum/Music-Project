My cry to the sky yields reply from hell
Why the fuck am I here?
I can't see, hear, or speak
I can't cry out for help
Only one is watching me
I can't seek help from angels who hide their fangs behind a veil of lies
I can't seek help from angels who hide their fangs behind a veil of lies
I can't call out to heaven because no one will fucking hear my cry
We're all blind, deaf, and dumb
I can't seek help from angels who hide their fangs behind a veil of lies
Blind, deaf, and dumb
Why the fuck am I here
I can't see, hear, or speak
I can't cry our for help
Only one is watching me
Why?
Give me the heart
Give me the light
Give me the fire
That burns deeps inside
