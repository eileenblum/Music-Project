It was too easy
It was so unkind
Held so much meaning
That I fell behind

Just a prisoner of the past
Don't know how to make it last
You can see your time will come
There is no where left to run

Trying for too long
Try to make it last
Watch it all come undone
Nothing will amass

Just a prisoner of the past
Don't know how to make it last
You can see your time will come
There is no where left to run

Just a prisoner of the past
Don't know how to make it last
You can see your time will come
There is no where left to run

Falling deeper into
What I shouldn't have
Never figure out
How to make it back

Just a prisoner of the past
Don't know how to make it last
You can see your time will come
There is no where left to run

Just a prisoner of the past
Don't know how to make it last
You can see your time will come
There is no where left to run
