It wasn't right
Before the storm
Nothing was calm
There was no form
Scattered and strewn
Among the wild
Knowing no better
Like a child

Reckless you waste
Another day
Coasting backwards
All the way

Whatever words
You tried to say
Will never matter
It's too late

Drift away together
Gone astray forever
One last struggle
As we drown
Slowly sink together
No return forever
Resting peaceful
As we drown

You must have fallen
Such a shame
Was it intention or mistake
We'll never know
Now that you're gone
It seems that everything's
Gone wrong

Floating you drift
Upon the shore
Bloated and pale
You look so worn
Now that your
Conscience is no more
It's almost like you
Were never born

I can see you after me
What's your reason
Why'd you leave
After all that
We've been through
Still nobody knows the truth
Now so many wonder why
Why'd you go and
Where's your cry
As I lean towards the ground
I can feel you pulling down

Hard to conclude
But some will try
When you obscure
The reason why
Unanswered questions
Always there
But is it really
Worth the fare
