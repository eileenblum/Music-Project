Ending of the road
Can't escape the cold
Oust and never told
Shown just what you
Always knew

Feeling of betrayal
Hollow and so frail
Certainty has failed you
More than once
You must let go

From a different place
Shadows hide your face
Cast away and left with all
The hurt that cost you dear

Shoved into the mould
Feeling you're too old
Under all the weight you bear
You know it's now too late

It's getting harder every day
I want to save the truth
No need to wonder
What they say
I hope you save the truth
If they find out, who's gonna pay
I want to save the truth
You know there is no other way
I hope you save the truth
