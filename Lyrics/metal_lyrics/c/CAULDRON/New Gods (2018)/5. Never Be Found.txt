Try to rewind
Torture is just too kind
Falling, chasing
Swallow what is failing

How do you require
Everything was acquired
Set your sail low
Unsecure we must go

Searching and wasting
While contemplating
Now I've forsaken
The undertaking

Caught up behind
Trailing, it's hard to find
Crawling, stalling
Before you miss your calling

Freely confined
Easier to decline
As the years slow
Falling on you, let go

Try to be safe
Stay in your place
Leading a life
That is such a disgrace
Thrown around
Hammer you down
Feeling so lost
Will you ever be found

You'll never be found
