Tell me a truth
'Cos I believe you
No need to prove
No need to confuse
As in the past
The way it was used
All along,
Everything they knew

Searching long for your awakening
Destined for some resonating
Come with me know, no hesitating
Or face the World and be mistaken!

See where you are!
On the inside
To be with you now
So follow the sign
A long way to go
Around the outside
I'm letting go
To be by your side

Do you believe
What you're betraying?
Are you buying
Just what you're saying?
There's nothing left
There is no faking
The rest are gone
Alone, you're facing

Slowly deterred
But still awaiting
There;s nothing there
So what is it you're chasing?
Deserted plans
Begat the taking
Gone to last
And ever saying

See where you are!
On the inside
To be with you now
So follow the sign
A long way to go
Around the outside
I'm letting go
To be by your side

Time!
To be by your side

Somewhere you're lost
And can't be found
Completely turn you
Upside down
By the seams
That you are bound
You can try
But can't put down!

Tell me a truth
'Cos I believe you
No need to prove
No need to confuse
As in the past
The way it was used
All along,
Everything that they do!

See where you are!
On the inside
To be with you now
So follow the sign
A long way to go
Around the outside
I'm letting go
To be by your side

See where you are!
On the inside
To be with you now
So follow the sign
A long way to go
Around the outside
I'm letting go
To be by your side

Time!
To be by your side! [x5]
