Misery is well
Even though it's hard to tell
When you don't have to wait
It's hard to make it
Through the gate

Certainty is frail
To continue is to fail
Some can hide it well
And surprise you full of hell

That's not the way
It's always been
It's nothing that's gonna be seen
You'll never hear another cry

Everything you're
Chasing after
Always turns into disaster
Your last request denied

Darkness closes in
You were about to start again
When will this ever end
Will it end without amend

It's hard to lose control
Forgetting what you've
Always known
It's time to fall away
Once you smile and
Reach that day

I know you must have tried
But what was justified
We'll never know
Before you die

Everything you're
Chasing after
Always turns into disaster
One last request denied
Not a thing you'll ever master
You're forever falling faster
Your last request denied
