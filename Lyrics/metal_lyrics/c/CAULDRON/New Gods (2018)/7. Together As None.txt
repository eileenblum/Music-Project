Whatever happened
Where did we go
Lost together
Now lost alone
Distance grows
Between us flows
Outgoing charm
Now really shows

Hesitation in the air
Creeping in, complete despair
See no danger in the dark
Getting lost without the spark

Reach to pull you close
But find that you're not there
Couldn't show you
I've been spared

No more can I be saying
Don't go, your mind's
Not changing
This time I don't believe it's over
No more, memories crated
You know they'll start fading
Please know that
It's not really over

It's not easy to pretend
There's a way to live again
Following blindly, feeling free
Fill the air so gracefully

Further away
Grown to believe
What was wrong
Was meant to be
Completely stung
By your surprise
How can there
Be no reprise

Lost it all alone
Enduring to the end
Will it ever come again
