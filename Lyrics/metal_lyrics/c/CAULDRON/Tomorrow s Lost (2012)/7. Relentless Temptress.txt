You've come along way to your knees
Just as you've been condemned to seethe
A little closer's all you need
Once you've got nothing to redeem

(relentless) burn bright the lantern in the breeze
(temptress) take to the tower through the trees
(relentless) you're never known to reveal
(temptress) trapped in distress share your appeal

She wants you back, she's all you need
And now she's stalking in your dreams
You take a liking to her charm
Forever out to do you harm

(relentless) burn bright the lantern in the breeze
(temptress) take to the tower through the trees
(relentless) you're never known to reveal
(temptress) trapped in distress share your appeal

Take the only charm
Twisted into harm
Lost behind the veil
Vanish in betrayal

(relentless) burn bright the lantern in the breeze
(temptress) take to the tower through the trees
(relentless) you're never known to reveal
(temptress) trapped in distress share your appeal
