Deep in the valley underneath
The basement dwellers birth a dream
A host of weapons craft their seed
Echoing cinders start to bleed

Born inside the falling tide, confined within
The struggle thrives to undermine existence

An arsenal brewing from beneath
Ready and bursting from the seams
The storm of passion never sleeps
Bound by eternal verity

Born inside the falling tide, confined within
The struggle thrives to undermine existence

Across the river see the peace and calm coaxing you over
But over here the fight you fear cannot stop taking over

You can't go back and forth, dismay has come to bring you sober
No looking back this time has come to strike you down forever

Born inside the falling tide, confined within
The struggle thrives to undermine existence (grim)
