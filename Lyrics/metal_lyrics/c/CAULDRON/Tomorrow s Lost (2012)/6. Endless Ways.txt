It wasn't spoken as it was foreseen
It's too late to change for what should have been
Time's brought light to fate bestowed in dreams
Now submerged in consequence it seems

Suppressed under command
Continue out of hand
So overused, complete refuse
Brought to life and sworn to lose in these
Endless ways

Never know where you're going
It gets too hard not knowing anyway
Endless ways

Always too tired for trying
Too hard to stop denying everything

Last rite taken and it's much too real
Forced to deal with hell, no time to heal
Carry on the same, remain in bliss
From the cradle washed into the mist

Discarded with unrest
Stripped and raped of the best
Forever lone, no other way
It's always going down the same in these

Endless ways
Never know where you're going
It gets too hard not knowing anyway
Endless ways

Always too tired for trying
Too hard to stop denying everything

Suppressed under command
Continue out of hand
Forever lone, no other way
It's always going down the same in these

... ways

Never know where you're going
It gets too hard not knowing anyway
Endless ways

Always too tired for trying
Too hard to stop denying everything
