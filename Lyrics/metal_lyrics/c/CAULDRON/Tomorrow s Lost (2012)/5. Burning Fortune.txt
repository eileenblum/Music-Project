Ripping through the sheets your body starts to rise
There's not far to go, from here we'll reach the skies
Counting many ways, survival of the times
Its a long way up to meet your own demise

Make all the noise you want, no one will hear your cries
Imagine all you want, it should come as no surprise
It won't take long now, no longer can disguise

Take your time babe, you won't make it out alive
You're gonna lose no matter how hard you try
Its your burning fortune
Welcome reality as 
Never known before
Its your burning fortune
