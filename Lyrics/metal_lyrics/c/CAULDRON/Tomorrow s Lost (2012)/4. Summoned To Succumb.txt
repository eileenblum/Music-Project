Invade internally
To seek depravity
For everything is never as it seems
Dream anomaly
Stalling desperately
Lost content and smothered in between

Drawn in as one
In trance i'm summoned to succumb
Taken feeling
And now there's nothing as it seems
From you to me
Take over, transfer pleasantly
Awake and numb
Within i'm summoned to succumb

Invasive quandary
Taken from belief
The startled phase beginning temperate schemes
Shaken to the knees
Terminal entities
The shackles of existence show no ease

Drawn in as one
In trance i'm summoned to succumb
Taken feeling
And now there's nothing as it seems
From you to me
Take over, transfer pleasantly
Awake and numb
Within i'm summoned to succumb

No more tries, no more lies
No goodbyes, no survives
Out of time, all the time
No one wins, endless sin

Invade internally
Terminal entities
For everything is was never as it seemed

Drawn in as one
In trance i'm summoned to succumb
Taken feeling

And now there's nothing as it seems
From you to me
Take over, transfer pleasantly
Awake and numb
Within i'm summoned to succumb
