Lost and free, you wish to find the key
But it was locked inside
Search and see as it was meant to be
You'll never have to hide

We are never going to see
It takes nothing to be free
Take a look and you will find
Nothing to believe

Running for the end of time
Whatever happened to our kind
Running for the end of time
And there's no tomorrow

On your knees like it was bound to be
Your captor waits inside
Choose to be and always coasting free
You've kept him from the light

No one's ever going to see
It takes nothing to believe
Take a look and you will find
You don't have to hide

Running for the end of time
Whatever happened to our kind
Running for the end of time
And there's no tomorrow
