The time always at hand
But never out of hand
You better run while you still can
Prowling through the trees
Knowing of what you see
And always waiting to deceive

The sun in shadows everywhere but never in sight
You only wish that you could see

Fight for day, lead the way
For the light won't last and you're the prey
Fight for day, leave today
For the well known soul will steal your fate away

You've been here far too long
And you've always been wrong
It wasn't rite where you belong

Leave and forget your plan
Too late to break this trance
The night was never meant to last

Haunting the shadows everywhere but never in sight
It's always closing in on you

Fight for day, lead the way
For the light won't last and you're the prey
Fight for day, leave today
For the well known soul will steal your fate away
