Getting sick living out of the box
Breaking out ain't looking to stop
Say no more just take it straight to the end
Looking back seeing never again
Stay on track and never pretend
Take the knife, it's too dark to believe its the end

Chasing fears, chasing lies
Surrounded all the time
Breaking mirrors, taken cries
Keep drowning deep inside
Make suffer, faith deprived
Dispose of every line
Insincere face in time
Nitebreaker cross the line

Burning light always looking to see
Weakened hold i can never retrieve
What to choose when your life is never what it should be
Lead the way find your only need
And within plant your only seed
Waiting near, never be the only way to receive

Chasing fears, chasing lies
Surrounded all the time
Breaking mirrors, taken cries
Keep drowning deep inside
Make suffer, faith deprived
Dispose of every line
Insincere face in time
Nitebreaker cross the line
