Fall beneath the traveled path
Now let loose and losing track
Lost forever in the black
Flash of light on your back
Stricken fever losing pace
Tears now hold upon your face
Lose the way once more alone
Was it real, hope is gone

Now it's happened
Can't get past for long

Sun will fall upon your hair
Things at once all seem so fair
Find what's real and count what's lost
Heart made of earth and frost
There's a light inside my head
Burning clouds my eyes instead
Flying free no longer care
Feel so calm no longer there

Now it's happened
Can't get past for long

The sun has gone and left you cold
Gives you things that cant be sold
You do well with what you're told
Stolen rite from under eyes
All i know is what i hide
There is truth inside the lies

Take a pass from your disguise
Shown to your own demise
You were never meant to rise
The more you learn the less you try
Giving in, it's only right
Leave without your last goodbye
