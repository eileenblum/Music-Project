I hold the chains on life, you'll never leaveConcoction, under lock and key, no needI trust in lust to keep you stranded by my sideAnd when you're gone, I'm only left with lies Run tonight, burn the candle, fantasizeLook insideQueen of fire in your eyes The midnight chime presents a force unknownA will to be so still it's quite aloneLet out, but not cast outIt's everywhere insideAnd left alone it grows to strain your mind Run tonight, burn the candle, fantasizeLook insideQueen of fire in your eyes Oh no, don't go, I want you back againWatch out, locked outYou're straying from the endIt's time to cry, you're going to dieRun tonight, burn the candle, fantasizeLook insideQueen of fire in your eyes
