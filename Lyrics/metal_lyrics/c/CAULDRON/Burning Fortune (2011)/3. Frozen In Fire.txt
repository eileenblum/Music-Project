Facing the fire to find the wishIn which you lackTrapped in desire for moreMove in for the attackPush on to distant shores 'cause there's no turning backCan't turn around and nowYou're running from the track The way that you go will seal your fateIt's getting too late Flirt with desire, you face the fireIt's been too long for youNever retire, you walk the wire Losing the dream you're bound to screamBut there's no soundNow that you're lostYou wonder if you will be foundIf there's a way then it's too hard to see todayYou've lost the fire, but you can never turn away Now that you're gone, never move onWhatever went wrong Flirt with desire, you face the fireIt's been too long for youNever retire, you walk the wireYou touch the flame, you play the gameIt won't be long at allUntil you're frozen in the fire Must regain some groundMust be free somehowThere's no return foundNo escape, you're bound It's been a long time comingNo one's holding backYou see it coming but you can't escape the tracks Wherever you are, you can't escapeNow it's too late bitch! Flirt with desire, you face the fireIt's been too long for youNever retire, you walk the wireYou touch the flame, you play the gameIt won't be long at allUntil you're frozen in the fire
