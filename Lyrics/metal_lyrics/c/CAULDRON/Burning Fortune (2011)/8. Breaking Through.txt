Breaking through the dead of nightThere's a place, we've got to find itNothing will stop us on our way Watch your back at every momentThey will take you down and controlLurking through the fog to find a way Descend on early morningNow burning brightA sudden turn to nightmaresSqueezing the empty momentNow out of sightWith innocence we take flight They do their best to tease youThey'll never try to please youBe careful of what you do now Search and find, deprived of your willNot confined the matters fulfillMake a strike and be the first to kill Descend on early morningNow burning brightA sudden turn to nightmaresSqueezing the empty momentNow out of sightWith innocence we take flight Rock the waves and shake their brainsLet's burn it to the groundTake the place and re-disgraceAnd show 'em what we foundTurn the crowd and take their prideThis is our own home nowTake the reins and touch the chainsForever they are bound Take the stage and steal the rageWhen hell is all aroundBreak the rage rite in the facesNever turn aroundSoon there'll be nowhere to hideWe occupy insideBreak the waves and ride the plainsForver we are nowOne more way... On her wings she tried to fleeBut they don't want to flyShe's trapped in time On her knees she can't believeWhat's going on insideShe's lost her mind Never thought I'd go this wayBut always did the crimeWe crossed the line Never saw the hidden scripture written in the liesNo last goodbye
