Lost in an empty roomThe scent of her perfumeHas guided me so far awayHard to face another day Time does not help to mendContinue to pretendThat you can cure as you redeemEverything's not what it seems You've been gone for so longThings have changed, not the sameSeems to be that you have lost the way Those tears have come, start fallingTears have come, come crawlingTears have come Inept forsaken starA plan to take us farA stolen dream is not the sameDying scream that can't remain Return to our descentFollow it to the endYou can not hide so please don't try It's hard to stop when you're alive When you're gone for so longSomething's changed, very wrongYou don't see but things are not the same Those tears have come, start fallingTears have come, come crawlingTears have come I tried my best to do your partAnd in return you crushed my heartNo one will ever see you starUp and down, all aroundClose the blind, you'll be fineTouch my heart, steal my soulNow there's nothing to consoleThings have changed, very strangeNow you're gone, seems derangedTogether we were always to remain... Gone! Those tears have come, start fallingTears have come, come crawlingTears have come
