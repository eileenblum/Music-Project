Turn me in or turn me looseCrank it up inside the nooseLose it all for something moreBut life won't be a bore Just say that it's overPlease tell me tonightGive me all or nothingShow me the rite Won't play the same ol' gameThat path is for the tameDon't care for what remains As long as there's no more Just say that it's overPlease tell me tonightGive me all or nothingShow me the rite If there's a way then let's find it todayIf it's over then show me the graveIf there's a way then I would like to stayBut I'll never hide Just say that it's overPlease tell me tonightGive me all or nothingShow me the rite
