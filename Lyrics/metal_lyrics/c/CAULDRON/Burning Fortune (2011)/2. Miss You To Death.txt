I couldn't stay away so longIt took me by surpriseI couldn't stay away no longerLooking in your eyes You've taken me inIt's time to beginSedation is not far awayYou have a gameAnd it's not the sameI'm dying to know when you're coming home Miss you to deathLonging for a long timeAnd dying for a lifelineNo longer will you be mineMiss you to death I always paint a perfect pictureOf your thin disguiseTrust was taken in your handBut never realised I followed you back and fell in your trapI got nothing left in returnIt's always too much whenn you're out of touchYou know I can never be left alone Miss you to deathLonging for a long timeAnd dying for a lifelineNo longer will you be mineMiss you to death Striding through all the notionsReeling in all the painFeeling of lost emotionNothing without youGrieving with every momentRiding through all the wavesWe are no longer potentNothing without you I knew you so longWhatever went wrongHow did it turn out this wayI know you're not farWherever you areIt kills me to think you're not coming home Miss you to deathLonging for a long timeAnd dying for a lifetimeNo longer will you be mineNo longer see the sun shineStop longing for a long timeStart dying for a lifelineForever we will be fineMissed you to death
