Stare into the river today
What could ever have made it this way
Deep inside your eye is a gleam
Showing more than you thought it would be

Make a turn to go find a way
In the dark do not be afraid
It will burn just fine can't you see
A chosen path they deceive

Awaken to another day
How did things ever turn out this way
What you have envisioned it seems
It was not something more than a dream

Make a turn to go find a way
In the dark do not be afraid
You will make it just fine if you leave
Now is the time to conceive

Taunting the breeze
Trapped in this haunting disease
What you don't know is already gone
What ever wanted to please
Taken desire at ease
What you don't know is already home

There's things you'd like to see
That you're not gonna find
Continued search for no surprise
There's thinks you want to be
And someone's gonna mind
When there's nothing inside

Play the game but result is the same
Lose the way after all it's a shame
You were right but I wanted to do
Things my own way, dream the dreams i choose

Lost it all and been stripped to the bone
No one else ever left all alone
Taken every chance that was there
And now there is nothing to bare

Taunting the breeze
Trapped in this haunting disease
What you don't know is already gone
What ever wanted to please
Taken desire at ease
What you don't know is already home
