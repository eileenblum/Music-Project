Leave on the very first flight of your life
So much is left behind you
Pouring your soul into all that you know
Gambling your life for a fortune

You can't escape who you are
Trapped as yourself you go far
Life is too short in Rapid City

Playing the game, but you're starting to fade
This endless cycle surrounds you
Somehow I thought that I could find a way
Seems that I'm lost here without you

There's no escaping this life
It's at your back with a knife
You must move on through Rapid City

Twisting and turning
Your life keeps on burning
And still there is nothing to show
This time you've been given
Is taken forbidden
Leave what you meet and move on

There's no escaping this life you are chasing
Time keeps on passing you by
There's no escaping this life you are chasing
You must move on through the night
Life is too short in Rapid City
