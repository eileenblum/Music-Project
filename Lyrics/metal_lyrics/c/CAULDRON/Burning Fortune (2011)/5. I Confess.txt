[Halloween Cover]

It always seems so easy to tell another lie
Convince myself that you would always give me one more try
You're always there but not this time
I don't know what to do
So many times I wanted to say these words to you

I confess 
I've been wrong a million times
If there's any way to make things right
A million times I'd lie
But now that it's over, I confess!

I would have told you long ago
But you always turn away
You swore you'd never say goodbye
But I knew you wouldn't stay
I've asked for second chances
and you were always there
Now you're gone, I stand alone
Drowning in despair

I confess 
I've been wrong a million times
Now there is no way to make things right
A million times I've tried
Now it's over

I confess
I've been wrong a million times
If there's anyway to make things right
Believe me I will lie

I confess
Now it's my turn to tell the lies
There's a million ways to pay you back
Believe me I will try
I confess
