Apathetic with the weight
Much too heavy to let it sink
Hardened feelings that linger on
How can you bear to hold on for so long
The deed it happened and broke apart
Sanctions hampered right from the start
Never mending the broken trust
Moving on as you prefer to left

Pulling tightly, reveal the strain
You're much too weak, you can't refrain
Hold it close and feel the sting
It's only weakness mistaken for strength
Ammunition of yesterday

To use against the one to blame
Endless sorrow, no other way
Forever locked within your sight

Hold your fire
Stand accused as we expire
Another trial, till the end of time
It's come undone
And can never be turned around
Show me how, hold your fire
