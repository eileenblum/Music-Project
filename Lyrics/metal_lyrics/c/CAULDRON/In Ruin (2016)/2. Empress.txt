Beneath the crust she thrives
A long cold wrath survives
Suppressed by ancient dream
Comfort her deceit

Cold winds, the darkest night
Grace and warmth out of sight
Alone under the trees
The numbing of embrace relieves

Empress make a call
Your plains will never fall
Endure eternal pleas
Endless conception at ease

Deep in the vale they cry
Await what she decides
Accepting dismal change

Embracing all constraints

Swarmed by the misty night
So thick, you cannot fight
Engulf the land and the moon
As victims lay at her commune

She's gonna spread the wrath and push until she's in
You're gonna sink until submerged too deep within
Why contemplate as if to change, all was consumed
Into the shadows to recluse always too soon

Vast in bloom
Calm and strewn
Endlessly spread your unease
