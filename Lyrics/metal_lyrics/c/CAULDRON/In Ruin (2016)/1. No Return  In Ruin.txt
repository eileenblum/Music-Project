Take no prisoners, feel no pain
Overseeing Endless reign
Unknown body staking claim
Changing seasons all the same

Standing in the moonlight
Numbing grip pulling tight
Sinking in to take flight
Ending to eternal strife

Shackled in disgrace
Lost without a trace
Certainty in ruin with no return
Suffocated mound
Empty and confound

Eternity in ruin with no return

Calming lesions forming trade
Falling legions excavate
Losing reason, roots are frayed
Forbidden fruits all taste the same

Growing presence ignite
Suffocating delight
Full exposure, can't hide
Forever gone and out of sight
