Lost in the battlefield
A soul that can not yield
Head first into the frey
With no plan for steps to take
Taken under the spell
Continue to compel
Too many moves to make
Never stop or you will break

Don't know the road that leads
Accelerate with speed
Knowing no guarantee
Pleasure of the greatest tease
Fear of not keeping pace
Someone will take your place
Burn fast, fall behind
Never one with fleeting time

Burning both ends
Constant redeeming
No time to mend
Losing all feeling
Burning both ends
No longer dreaming
The future descends

Losing all meaning

Under the hill we go
Too fast, no time to slow
The signs of long ago
Ignore the pattern far below
Final appeal is lost
Reveal the final cost
Knowing no expertise
Never stop or you will cease

Your time was spent, there's no repent
Ignoring the signs in the end

Lost in the battlefield
This soul that can not yield
Still down and out of place
Never know your own disgrace
Steady under the spell
Continue to compel
Too late to turn away
Forever lost and led astray
