Can't seem to shake the notion
Entranced under devotion
Enrolling from the past
Today will be the very last

Into a never ending light
You'll find the dawn of sunrise

No fear of growing older
Uncounted and much colder
Withdrawn from distant wrath
Now gone beyond and snuffed out fast

Without the worry of delight
Content there will be no surprise

Outrance, the final fare
The last extremity to spare
Outrance, the end is here
The fear you feel, now no one's there
Into the light you go
But what you see is just for show
Finish yourself and see
Rid of your care and know you're free

She'll rise and fall
I can't recall just what was left behind
I couldn't stall or here her call
And now I'll pay the price
