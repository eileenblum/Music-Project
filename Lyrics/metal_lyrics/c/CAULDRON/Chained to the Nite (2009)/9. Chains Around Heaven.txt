[Black 'N' Blue cover]

You got your problems, and I got my share
Put 'em together, we're goin' nowhere
I'm goin' to pieces, can't even get close
You're lookin' through me just like I was a ghost

Now if you know what I mean
Her heart doesn't open for anyone
If I could just find the key
To unlock the chains that surround her love

And I said chains
Chains around heaven
Lock you away
They keep me from you forever

I'm just a loser, but never a fool
And I'll never listen to your stupid rules
I can't find the answers
Ah, to what we should do
Your heart is in chains I don't have a clue

Now if you know what I mean
Her heart doesn't open for anyone
If I could just find the key
To unlock the chains that surround her love

And I said chains
Chains around heaven
Lock you away
They keep me from you forever
And I said chains
Chains around heaven
Lock you away
They keep me from you forever...forever

(Chains)
Chains around heaven
Lock you away
They keep me from you forever

And I said chains
Chains around heaven
Lock you away
They keep me from you forever...forever
