I have seen a life before
In a dream, left wanting more
Better than the life today
There has got to be a way

Then I stumbled to her door
Where inside she showed me more
Luring passion, altering ways
Using magic to create

Conjure the mass - Up from the past
They know in time we'll never last
Conjure the mass - The spell is cast
Don't think we'll ever make it back

In her lair I searched for more
Found what I was looking for
Shown the way to restore fate
Sounding dreams reincarnate

It was in the kiln I saw
Beyond a doubt without a flaw
I no longer have to prey
New beginnings start to raise

Conjure the mass - Up from the past
They know in time we'll never last
Conjure the mass - The spell is cast
Don't think we'll ever make it back

I have learned so I should flee
But she stands in front of me
Icy stare won't let me leave

In her dress and in her awe
Obvious she had no flaw
Something's coming over me
Will she ever set me free?

Conjure the mass - Up from the past
They know in time we'll never last
Conjure the mass - The spell is cast
Don't think we'll ever make it back
