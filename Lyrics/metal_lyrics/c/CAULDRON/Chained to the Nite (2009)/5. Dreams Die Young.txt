If I go down - No regrets
I take a sip with my last breath
Another thing to not confess
Everything I'll forget

Another life, another day
Must continue on my way
Bring tomorrow to me today
Show the plague that has kept me in dismay

No last chance means there's no chance

Standing still but time won't wait
Getting harder to find a way
Losing ground, drifting astray
Seems the end has been said, there is nothing left

No last chance means there's no chance

Why try to be what can not be
A make believe reality that thrives
As your love starts to die

And if any hope can survive
Hear the last of my cries
Losing reason to try
Every last dream has died
