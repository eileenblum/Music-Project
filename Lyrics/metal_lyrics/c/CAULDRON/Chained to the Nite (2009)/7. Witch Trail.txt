It's been a long way here
I'm still nowhere near
Nothing's coming clear
So why remain sincere?

Life wasting away
Lose another day
Before I drift astray
Find a way to make it out of here

Not sure where I am
Was this part of the plan
It's hard to understand
Sinking in the sand

Time keeps passing by
Light dims in the sky
The lower I descend
The closer that it brings me to the end

It's getting harder to pretend
Clouded fog veils my descent
I need to find a way to make it meant

Can we make it to the other side
No matter how hard that we try
Will we ever reach the other side

Continue and we're losing stride
Speeding closer to the end of time
It won't be long before we die
From here it looks like there is no reprise

Life is stalling on the witch's trail
Hear her calling but it's getting frail
Keep on crawling down the witch's trail
Something will be done

Long down the trail, hard to believe
All the things that could have been
Never known, never to be

What has passed us by so lucently
Now content I've learned to see
Everything was not for me

Life has stopped here on the witch's trail
The last call was getting much too frail
Stop on crawling down the witches trail
All is said and done

Ahhh
Where to run?
Lost the sun
Don't you dare
All is fair
