A horse storms backwards into town
Glowing bright without a sound
Takes whatever can be found

As it storms through the streets
To prey on children's dreams
Lose your daughter, hear her scream

An unfortunate display
What's gone wrong, why's it this way?
Hard to comprehend this fate

Should have known it was too late
Now they've taken everything
Nothing left, not even faith

Midnite hour is drawing near
Time has come for all to fear
Never thought it could be real
Terror salient all around
Burning promise to the ground
To forever haunt the town

An unfortunate display
What's gone wrong, why's it this way?
Hard to comprehend this fate

Should have known it was too late
Now they've taken everything
Nothing left, not even faith

As the sun sets to the ground
Shrouded mist moves through the town
Something's coming, hear the sound

Lightning crashing through the trees
Try to hide but you can't leave
No way out you join the screams

An unfortunate display
What's gone wrong, why's it this way?
Hard to comprehend this fate

Should have known it was too late
Now they've taken everything
Nothing left, not even faith
