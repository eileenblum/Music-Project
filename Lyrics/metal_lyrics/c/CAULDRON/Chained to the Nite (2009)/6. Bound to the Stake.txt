She was a little girl inside
But not seen from the outside
No love that she could ever find
Deprived of those to be by her side

Not a chance to be
For her fortune was made believe
Always forced to see
Something she didn't want to see

Why can't she carry on this way?
Made to do as the others say
Don't seem so natural to her
No more in the eyes of the villagers

No one's little prize
In her presence they always cried
Something's wrong inside
We must reveal the witch tonight

Bound to the stake
There's no escape
She led life her way
And left them afraid

Bound to the stake
Now it's too late
They chose her fate
Death is on the way

A must that she'll be confessing
The witchfinder is pressuring
Innocence is not what he seeks
Torture easily breaks the weak

There's no time to waste
All she needs is some time to prove
It's all a mistake
Not a witch like has been accused

Bound to the stake
There's no escape
She led life her way
And left them afraid

Bound to the stake
Now it's too late
They chose her fate
Death is on the way
