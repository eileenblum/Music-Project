A youthful struggle has come to beThe time is now for all to seeSo make your fortune come trueAnd go fulfill your need You've had this dream all of your lifeThe time is now to end your strifeHead down the path you chooseThe time has come We are calling outWe're shouting outWill we be heardWe are young and hungry An ultimatum has come to beWhat was envisioned now perceivedNothing was laid out for youSo carry on your way Someone suggests the way to youYou got your own, you'll see it throughAnd as you rise from belowResilience starts to cure Out on your own there is no time to lose- Make your moveOut in the night your hunger grows profuse We are calling outWe're shouting outWill we be heardWe are young and hungry I had a dream all of my lifeIt ended now I lost the fightNothing will ever come trueWe're out of time We are calling outWe're shouting outWill we be heardWe are young We are calling outWe're shouting outWill we be heardWe are young and hungry
