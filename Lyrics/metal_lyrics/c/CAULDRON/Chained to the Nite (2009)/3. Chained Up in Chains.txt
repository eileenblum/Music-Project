I've seen you for so long
Attraction growing strong
I dream of you but you don't see me through

You make my perverse stare
And my temptations flare
No one has ever stung me like you do

You think you're going home
No chance you'll be alone
A secret lover stalks you like prey

I have held on long
It almost seems you're gone
You really should come back here to stay

How can you do this to me?

Chained up in chains under the moonlight
I'm trying hard to make it alright
She'll never make it out here all night
No other, blinded by her sight

You crossed me in the dark
It really left a mark
Still without the nerve to try you

It always hurts to see
You cause a cut so deep
I'm going mad, I need you to see

And now it won't be long
You'll figure out what's wrong
It's so much easier without you

But longing is my way
I'll wait another day
I only hope you come back to stay
Why does she do this to me?

Chained up in chains under the moonlight
I'm trying hard to make it alright
She'll never make it out here all night
No other, blinded by her sight

I want to let you know
There lessons won't be learned
It doesn't matter how
Many times you're burned

This has gone on too long
You're stuck down on your knees
You'll never make it back
You're trapped in this disease

Chained up in chains under the moonlight
I'm trying hard to make it alright
She'll never make it out here all night
No other, blinded by her sight

I wish you'd stay here in the moonlite
You'd make me feel like it is alrite
Forever with me here in the nite
To always have you here in my site
