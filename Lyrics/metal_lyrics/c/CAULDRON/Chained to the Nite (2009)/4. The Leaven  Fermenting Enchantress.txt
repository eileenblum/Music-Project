I haven't seen these gleaming eyes before
Enchanting stare leaves me wanting more
How did she plant the seed so deep within
Ongoing charm, to ferment we begin

As we ferment it gets harder to see
Everything that's caused us misery
We'll conjure up infectious brews beneath
To dwell I'm sent, so peaceful and content

To disguise the ill abscess
On a quest not certain to be blessed
As we try to retain our last breath
Feel the squeeze, fermenting enchantress

As we ferment it gets harder to see
Everything that's caused us misery
Deep root within - Too long to revend
All is content, fermenting till the end

To disguise the ill abscess
On a quest not certain to be blessed
As we try to retain our last breath
Feel the squeeze, fermenting enchantress

Now it's going to start to sink you down
Pouring in on you from all around
No way to help you once you go down

Enchantress
Answer the calling every time
Catch me I'm falling from the sky
On a trip not certain to come home
