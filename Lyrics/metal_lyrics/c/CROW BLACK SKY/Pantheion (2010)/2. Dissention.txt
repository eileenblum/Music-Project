[Composer: Lamprecht / Malcolmson]

Riding on the clouds, we will stoke the flames!
Breaking from the past, put them all to shame!
Bleeding for the cause, we won't yield to them!
Children of the sun, we will scorn their names!

Try to no avail... We won't step aside!
Seek and you shall find... No triumph or might!
Fail endlessly... Foolish in our sight!
We are the embodiment of all that you despise!

Spread your wings, upward, rise!
Hatred seethes, within your eyes!
Far ahead of the rest!
They will not withstand the test!
Disavow, curse their names!
Cast them down into the flames!
Break their will, don't hold back!
The time is right for attack!

Surface from the ground, we will deviate!
Crawling from our holes, we will dominate!
Emerging from the shades, to our rightful place!
Descending from the air, we will rise from grace!

Try to no avail... We won't be dethroned!
Seek and ye shall find... There's no place to run!
Fail endlessly... You can cast your stones!
All that you resent and fear is what we will become!

Spread your wings, upward, rise!
Hatred seethes, within your eyes!
Far ahead of the rest!
They will not withstand the test!
Disavow, curse their names!
Cast them down into the flames!
Break their will, don't hold back!
The time is right for attack!
