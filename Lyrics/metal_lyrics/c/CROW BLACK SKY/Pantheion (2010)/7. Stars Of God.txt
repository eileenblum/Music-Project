[Composer: Lamprecht]

Release me from my cage...
Show me forbidden things!
Unveil to me the truth...
That I may ascend within!

Guide me over mountainsides where weak have stumbled down!
Show me ways of arrogance that I may be enthroned!
None could fathom the magnitude of what I will become!
Glorify the god in me... I worship me alone!

Hereby I denounce all faith, and substitute my mind!
Hereby I oppose and abrogate religious lies!
Hereby I reject the ancient prophecies foretold!
Hereby I exalt my throne above the stars of God!
