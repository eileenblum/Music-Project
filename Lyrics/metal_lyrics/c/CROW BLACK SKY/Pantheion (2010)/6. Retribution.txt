[Composer: Lamprecht]

A refusal of tribute angers our king...
The emissary's head to us returned!
This hostile gesture will not be ignored...
With the blessing of Odin, war was affirmed!

For days we journeyed into south,
Across the perilous scapes!
Over the hills, hidden in shroud...
To where our enemies await!

The splendorous sun watches over us all,
Our steel and armor bright as gold!
As we prepare ourselves for...

War!
The blood of our enemies will drip from our swords!
Troubled we'll be...
Nevermore!
We will vanquish their men and butcher their young!
Retribution and war!

On the horizon, their city now in view...
Unsuspecting are they!
The king and his heroes formulate our plans...
We abide till the end of the day!

The sound of horns calls them out to fight,
And signifies the shedding of their blood!
Howling with pride! Weapons up high!
Lightning striking the ground!

Hundreds of them! Hundreds of us!
Charging, fearless of death!
There is no turning back!
In the name of Odin...

Attack!
The blood of our enemies will drip from our swords!
Troubled we'll be...
Nevermore!
We will vanquish their men and butcher their young!
Retribution!

Triumphantly, we make our way home,
Singing songs of victory!
None can oppose!
We thirst for...

War!
The blood of our enemies will drip from our swords!
Troubled we'll be...
Nevermore!
We will vanquish their men and butcher their young!
Retribution and war!
