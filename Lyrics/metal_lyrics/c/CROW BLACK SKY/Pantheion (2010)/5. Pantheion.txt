[Composer: Lamprecht / Spinas]

The light starts to dim, as Ra withholds day,
Memphis is in disarray!
A mortal despair, a petrified cold,
Blankets the nomes as foretold!

The eyes of the gods, beholding their fear,
Illume with expressions austere!
Convicted are all, and worthy are none!
Their heresy must be undone!

Khepri invokes the deceased by his will...
Heeding his call, they obey!
Scarabs come forth from their brittle remains...
Untold in number are they!

Every horizon is tainted in full,
The landscapes violently quake!
Pestilence... Swarms!
Death descends on its wings!
Forthwith onlookers wither away,
Nothing remains in their wake!

The cries pierce the air, as judgment is served,
The wailing and prayers go unheard!
In moments of death, the firstborn are slain,
Survivors are cursed and plagued!

The eyes of the gods, beholding their fear,
Illume with expressions austere!
Convicted are all, and worthy are none!
Their heresy shall be undone!

Sekhmet ascends from the horrible depths...
Her children emerge from the ground!
Hissing and endless as the sea...
To Sekhmet's will they are bound!

Terrible creatures ravage the land,
Thirsting for human flesh!
With vengeance and disgust for the living there...

The gods look down upon the death and demise of wicked man!

As the final day drew near,
And mankind paid for its sins...
Osiris motioned for the end,
And time knelled down to him!

Finally mankind became extinct,
The Nile ran thick with blood!
Bodies decayed, and scattered throughout,
Majestic dawn ensued...
The Pantheion looked down upon their work,
And saw that it was good!
