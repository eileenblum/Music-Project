The earth is crying out for mercy
Seems no oneâs gonna hear her scream
We all walk straight in wrong directions
Are we much too blind to understand?

This is the only ground for living
No other planet we can go to
(or is there anyone you know?)
Realize nobody can eat money
Why did it take so long to understand?

Wake up! You fool!
Look all the things weâre gonna fade out to be free
Oh! Wasted chances
These visions I see scare me more than you will ever know

If there are no more eagles gonna ride the open sky
And no more whales that cross the seven seas
Realize somehow weâve reached the end of the line
We are caught in a world that slowly dies, that slowly dies

Extinction gets a new dimension
Why doesnât anyone believe?
Subdue the earth and all thatâs living
Something we must have misunderstood

We call ourselves âpride of creationâ
Pride always comes before the fall
(you want the most and lose it all)
I got a truth that might surprise you
No one cares when we all disappear
