Life struck me, pulled the trigger
Thereâs nothing left to lose
Let me know if thereâs something worth living for
Back from where I was started
Iâve been here far too long
How many ears I walked this path alone
You came along and saved me
You caught me when I fell
You broke my shell and all these chains that held me

Release my tortured heart
The loneliness is tearing me apart
Give me the reasons for a fairytale gone bad
Thought that I knew it all
But then the world became my master
There is no way out when you are falling down

Oh! Come on and kiss away my pain
Erase my memories
Look at the fragments of my life
Illusions never change
Change into something that is real
I beg for you to come
âCause you will always be my savior
Youâll always be my last resort

Back on my feet Iâm standing
But I can hardly walk
Oh! Let your hands embrace my broken heart
Youâve turned the night into day
Changed darkness into light
Give me the strength to fight these daily races
