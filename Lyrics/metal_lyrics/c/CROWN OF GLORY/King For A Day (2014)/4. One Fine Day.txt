Some days will fade to gray
Good times seem far away
Who knows what future holds
âCause life knows all the dirty tricks
Each time you find yourself
Lying flat on your face
Thatâs life, you canât deny
Pick yourself up get back into race

From the cradle to the grave
This is the only life Iâll live
I just canât complain
The joy of life is worth the pain

Fate gives the stick on me
Life left some scars youâll see!
I wonât get off the track
I havenât come this far to quit right now
Been loosing many fights
But I wonât lose my faith
Will give it one more try
I grab my chance, I still believe

I go all the way to my dreams
Destiny guides me along dusty roads
âCause I choose to be free to be me
This is my time and my life and I do it my way

Iâve learnt from my mistakes
Iâm standing up again
Pick up my broken dreams
The paths we chose decide our fate
Believe in what I am
Ready to ride for a fall
I step up to the plate
What doesnât kill you makes you stronger
