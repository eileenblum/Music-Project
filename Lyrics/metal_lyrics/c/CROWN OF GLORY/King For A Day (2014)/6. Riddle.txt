As light as a feather
Thoughts are drifting away
To places no one dares to dream
In the darkness of my mind
I am lost without a trace

Caught by the moment
I can hardly breathe
Feels like forever and a day
Iâve been walking on this path
I have done this all before

All that seemed so important
Itâs mere mirror and smoke
Iâm filled with voice but never speak
Iâm all at once Iâm strong Iâm weak
And stay forever with the stars

Way up high on clouds of gray
Where the time creates the day
I was born before the sun
Where it all began
Iâm the bliss in everything
Iâm the feather and the wing
Riddle out my dream

Draw the veil of oblivion
Where Iâm hiding myself
Will you get the chance to see?
To see what no one else can see
Figure out whatâs really me
