So what are you waiting for?
Just play your whole hand until itâs through
Lifeâs waiting in front of you
Just open up the door and let it in
Youâve prayed for better days
Common get your head out of your ass
Itâs like you against the world
Defy the storm and you will make the day

Itâs time to break the spell
The world lies at your feet
Itâs time to leave the cage
The world is yours

All that you had prayed for
Forget all about blood, sweat and tears
Just keep your head held high
Youâll become king for one day
Thereâs nothing to be afraid of
Donât care about the things theyâve said and done
Just keep your head held high
Youâll become king for a day

Lifeâs too short to compromise
Straight forward, the time is here and now
Donât care what might have been
Stop thinking about the things you cannot change
Live your dream donât dream your life
Go on get your chance donât hesitate
Forge your own destiny
Every moment counts 'cause thereâs no second chance
