Gray the clouds are rolling by
As I look up to the sky
No one knows my secret
I think that no one ever will

Fate is calling for me
Iâve been waiting for so long
Close my eyes and breathe in
Then I count to ten

Beware, âcause Iâm hunting for you
Lights out, I can smell your fear
Tear up, you will find no fortress
Time is on my side

The night is my companion
I carry both bowstring and steel
The only thing that matters
Take the glory steal the prize

You look a little anxious
Donât get me wrong
Soon youâre gonna find out
Whoâs the hunted one
