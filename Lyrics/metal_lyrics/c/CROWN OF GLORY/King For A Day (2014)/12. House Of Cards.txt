Why do you run from me?
You know you cannot escape from me
Iâm sorry, but there is no way out

Searching, always searching for a way
Out of an endless maze
With traps and tricks to catch the innocent
Realize you brought this down on yourself
So you see what you wanted
Your sick and twisted lie turned back on you

You played your cards so well
But we both know you cheat
The construct of lies will fall
Like a house of cards one blow from caving in

So tell me was it worth the price?
Can you still look me in the eyes?
Tell me, I guess I donât understand
Are you surprised to see me here?
The scales fell from my eyes
Itâs such a shame what youâve become

Oh! I never did believe
A single word you say
You always try to bend the truth I know
Such a hypocrite to me
Now you got what you deserve
You should pull a card
And you pulled out the bottom one

You played all your cards
I won fair in square
Next roundâs on you
I didnât care
Try as you might
But whatâs the use of trying?
I control the cards
Iâll deal them as I wish

Your house of cards
Built up with lies
Collapsed on you
Itâs far too late
You knocked it down
You canât blame me
The blameâs on you
Why canât you see?
