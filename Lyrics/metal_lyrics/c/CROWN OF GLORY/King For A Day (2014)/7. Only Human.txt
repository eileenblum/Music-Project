How do you do this morning?
How does it feel to face the news?
Cheating, lies and corruption
Look there is real blood on the screen

Raise your voice you will be heard
Their time is up our time will come
Wise men said good things take time
Rome wasnât built within a day

So raise your voice

Letâs stand up for the things we believe in
Donât just raise a white flag and give up
Never said that I had all the answers,
But if we change ourselves, we could change...

... Everything

I donât think there is any leader
Itâs more like the blind leading the blind
We donât need your confessions
Or any other lame excuse
Always grub first than ethics
All your regrets arenât worth a dime
False promises from their lips
Just empty words for desperate ears
