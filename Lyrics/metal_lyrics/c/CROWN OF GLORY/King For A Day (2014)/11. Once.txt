Life changes so sudden
Weâll never quit working on our dream
Weâll grab fate by throat
Because it shall never drag us down

Time works for those who believe
One day weâll pay our dues
No!
There is nothing on earth that keeps us away
From trying

Come hell or high water
Next time we just try a little more
No oneâs born a master
A single stroke wonât fell an oak

Once is not enough
Make it or break it
Soon weâre gonna find out
Get up and stand your ground
I swear weâll never give up
Without fight

Donât waste your chances
Till the task is done, the quest complete
Hard work will pay off
And lifeâs always worth another try

Advices
Your choices
You try to build your dreams
Just three things
That help you
Your mind
Your heart
Your hands
