Define yourself by telling lies
You sell your soul for every short attention
You steal your way into my trust
Dressed as seduction you are curious and cruel

Like acid words bleed from your mouth
I can see your true face now
I have left blindness behind me
It reveals who you really are

Youâve sown wind for so long...
Now you reap storm
You reap storm now
Now you reap storm
You reap storm now

Hiding the truth behind your words
But your snake-tongue leads me easily astray
One mouth speaks the truth, the other lies
To trust in you has always been a bad advice
