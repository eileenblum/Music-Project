I still can remember
Drifting among the spheres of time
Everything is fading
And I am alone
Iâm torn inside
Blinded by the moment
Standing before the lord of dreams
He knows me and my fears
Iâll lay down my head
I close my weary eyes

In Morpheus dream
I can heal my wounds
In Morpheus dream
I can heal my soul

Watching, waiting, hoping
Hear you call out my name
Taunt me, haunt me, catch me
Iâm not afraid to sleep
Chaos, anger, sadness
Iâm afraid to wake up
Disguising, deception, illusion,
Itâs the price that I pay

A moment of meaning
I saw the truth before my eyes
I knew all the answers
Donât know what the questions are
It suffused my mind
Iâve heard a song of my life
That whispered in my head
A new dawn a new day
Embraces the world
And time stood still
