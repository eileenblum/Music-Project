Mirror, mirror on the wall
You're the one that shows it all
Can you tell me what's the meaning

Food for oil became oil for blood
A little different as they're told
Look at the ruins down my feet
No-one warned us when we went
To bring the peace to foreign lands
All hope now is buried in the sand

Eden's never been so far away
Seems out of reach
We have never been so many
But we never felt so alone

We cry for love
We cry for mercy
When do we start to practice what we are preaching

They talked of honour, they talked of pride
Never thought so many died
We've learned the hard way that they all lie
Fear at night, I shed a tear
The cries still linger in my ears
The dreadful sights won't disappear

Can't close my eyes, can't fall asleep
The fallen ones wont let me go
Their screams are echoes here forever
Eye for an eye, till all been blind
No peace of mind, no hope to find
So welcome back on Devils playground
