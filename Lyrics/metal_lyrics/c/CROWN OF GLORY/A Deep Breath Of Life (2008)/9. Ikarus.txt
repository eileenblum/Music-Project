Once upon in ancient Greece, beyond the mist of history
A mighty king, a fortress build
To save his life and gold

By Daedalus plans the labyrinth was done
So he comes and with him his son
A trap great of stone to hold everyone
Minos laughs: "I've got to say this!"

No, I cant let you go
There's so much you know
Arrested you'll be
No daylight to see

Deep down in the dark no ray of light
They made plans to hide
To build them wings like birds
To fly away from tyrants hands

Don't fly too high up to the sky
Sun burns your wings and you will die
Don't fly too high up to the sky
Sun burns your wings and you will die

No, I cant let you go
There's so much you know
Arrested you'll be
No daylight to see
