Now, now it's the time to say farewell my son
I'm here all alone, my heart filled with pain
I know its the end of all our dreams
You left me to stay, gods what a day
Oh I wish you back right here in my arms
Light brings back the pain
I cant escape... It's too late...

All that's left is just the pain inside of me

In my dreams I can see you fly again, son
I hear the lament of the wind
In my dreams I see you fly again, son
You were my light but now you're gone
Now you're gone

Feel the oceans breeze, the wind in my hair
The agony hurts deep inside
If I could turn back time, this time I would
You did had no chance to be what you could
Oh, life is unfair, no justice at all
The one who's full of life, the gods bring to fall... All...

Tell me god, is this the price I have to pay?
