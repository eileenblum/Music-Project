Let's draw up the curtains
Spotlight hits the stage
You'll be welcome to the show
Watch the tales of madness
Listen tales of hate
It's all been shown to you tonight

Give me your advice
I'm living in a world of lies
A place of disgrace
Once we have to pay the price

Don't close your eyes
Watching the raven's flight
Release your mind
There must be more to find

Don't watching for a guiding light
Start now changing minds

Join a world of constant fear
Live, form species, disappear
Where is your final destination?
Headline news hear what they say
Desperation makes the day
Look at the evolutions crown

Don't waiting for a guiding light
Start now changing minds
The vision of a better world
Starts with me and you

Now you know the time has come
More things to be done
Fight your fear and turn the key
Create your destiny
