There's a place we call Earth
A paradise lost
Almost Eden before we all exist
Loot the planet and what all live on it
Its subjection brutality

No more trust, Hope is lost
Society is sick
Realise it's the price we have to pay
See the road now has come to an end
No solutions, no time to spend

Time to see what we have done
Time to realise what has begun
Mother Earth exploited and raped
Stop destroying of paradise

Kill, Steal, Lie - Till' all beauty has died
Cheat, Fool, Heap - We are living in golden chains

See the cradle of filth
We're parasite like
Sucking off all the energies of life
Greed and envy are real Human scourges
Slaves of our own reality

Stop the madness
Find back to the things
We have lost on that long and winding road
It's not easy but possible
Let's work together and we will win
