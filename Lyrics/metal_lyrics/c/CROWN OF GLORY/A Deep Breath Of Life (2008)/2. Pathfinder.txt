Gazing starlight, the full moon is rising
The book of fate, dreams and forgotten
Tales is re-open once more
Long for mercy while I've walked
Through the ages, leave centuries behind me
See that freedom has a meaning for me
Come on howling with me

Close your eyes
Glance at paradise
I saw Atlantis rising
Take your chance
Life is a fairytale
Be not just one of a kind

Free your mind
Reaching for ever life
Don't you follow the blind
Take your choice
Dive into the mystery
Take a deep breath of life

Path forlorn, long and winding before me
Find me walking on the wind
The horizon is telling me I'm near
So many reasons to leave all behind me without hesitation
Eternity is just a heartbeat away
Won't you take a trip with me

There's a million ways behind me
Still a million ways to go
Where it starts I can't remember
Where it ends I'll never know
There's a little piece of heaven that is hidden in your life
Find that moment, try to capture (it)
And this is how it's meant to be
