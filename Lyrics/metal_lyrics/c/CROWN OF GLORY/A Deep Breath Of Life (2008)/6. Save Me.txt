Find myself lost in misery
Days gonna fade into grey
Daydreams imprison me, there's no way out
Your scent is still everywhere
I try to hide from the past
God must be hating me
Life chews me up and spits me out

I wonder if the sun will ever shine on me
It's so hard to face the truth, I can't deny
Embracing emptiness, I've lost my strength at all
Only the pain inside me proves me I'm alive

Come on save me
Come on save me
Before I'm falling
Come on save me
Come on save me
Before it's too late

Echoes are whispering voices from the past
Never thought eternal love could hurt so bad
Corroded by emptiness, these walls are closing in
My heart is bleeding
I'm afraid my wounds they will not heal
