Beyond my visions lies the fright
It's turning all my senses
Inside my wishes ocean wide
There is a place to hide to

And on the edge of time
I saw the future sign
I looked at all the answers
Twilight misery
And on the edge of time
I saw the secret sign
I heard it through the misty curtains of eternity

I have heard the anthem calling
Lead by history
I fell into a vision of the end
I promise my friend we'll change it

I am still here to face the fear
To find my piece of heaven
Remind the past we would recall
A promise for the future
