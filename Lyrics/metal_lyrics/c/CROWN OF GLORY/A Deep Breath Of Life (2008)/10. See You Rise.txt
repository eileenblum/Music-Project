I see you rise
I see you rise

I see you rise
You fly, you can touch the sky
I see you rise

I am riding the wind across the oceans
Hiding over the seas, no-one can hold me now
Father, look at me why can't you see
We could almost be gods
Come and follow me

I see you rise
You thought you can touch the sky
I see you rise
Over and over again
I see you rise
You thought you can touch the sky
I see you rise

Son why don't you listen return to my side
Quick before it's too late, your wings shall not burn
Father please help me, I was a fool
Look what's happening to me
I don't want to die

Rise so high try to touch the sky
Ever thought that you could fall
Rise so high try to touch the sky
Never thought that you could fall
