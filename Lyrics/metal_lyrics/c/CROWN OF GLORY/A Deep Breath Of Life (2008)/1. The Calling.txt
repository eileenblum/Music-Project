You can't bear down this feeling
I keep deep inside of me
You can swim with the masses, that's OK
But don't count on me

So long I've tried
To capture the light, to break the spell inside of me
Out of control, we're only a bit too loud
But that will hurt no-one

Let's start the show
If you're not in it
You'll never understand it
The calling

That tempts me so much
Tonight we're going to change the hands of time
Is it hard to see?
What this means to me
This is my gate to hide and to be free

Take a look from the distance
See dreams burned to ashes
Searching for something to be proud of
At the end of the day

Tonight is the night
Reviving the gods inside you
They are all asleep
I can hear you scream, let's breaking the silence
Like so many times before
