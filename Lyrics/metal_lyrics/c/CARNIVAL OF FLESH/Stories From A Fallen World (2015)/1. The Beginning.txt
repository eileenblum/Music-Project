Out of the silence, a voice begins to preach 
Saying heâs the man that will change everything 
His vision of future, in which he will not bow 
But rule the others - as he tries doing now 
Setting foundation for this new economy 
Was none other than killing his enemies 

Now he faces their mighty ghosts as they haunt him on through the night, making him want to die 

"We know you plead for the destruction and war 
We know you grieve, grieve for your soul 
We feel deeply, that you're afraid of tomorrow 
We'll hear your screams unless you end this terror" 

"Go away you silhouettes, you are but the fairy queens! 
I ruined your existence, I'll ruin your resting peace!" 

"You better think of what you're saying, you old man! 
How dare you confront the spirits of the dead? 
Now weâll enslave both you and your men 
You all shall face the eternal judgement!" 

"Seize them! Take them away!" 

"Now youâll face the judge - our eternal queen 
You better beg for mercy or be doomed for eternity!" 

"I will beg no one! Not you, nor the "queen"! 
You all better beg me to kill you instantly!" 

"Oh no, how can this be? His power is overwhelming me... 
Run my allies... Run..." 

"Destroy all, men! Destroy everything! 
No one can stop us, We've got eternity! 
Thank you, dear fairies for immortalising me! 
Now I can doom mankind for all eternity!"
