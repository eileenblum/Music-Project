The night devoured the morning, the fires burnt the ground 
A worthy foe on the battlefield was nowhere to be found 
Armies fell and rose again, to serve them on their side 
They march on with audacity that cannot be denied 
Onto the last victory, theyâre ready for the game 
The closing play in this theatre of pain 
The curtain shall come down when the last kingdomâs controlled
By eternal darkness, as the prophecy foretold 

The last battalion of the fair 
Quavering in despair 
Their champion arose 
âWe must take no remorse 
â¦in our own deathâ 

Theyâre flying high, observing puppets on the stage 
Every scene filling them with bitterness and rage 
Putting all resources into the final fight 
Vast armies stretch beyond the line of sight 
The air is getting thick from the grizzling sounds 
Of weapons slicing flesh and bodies hitting ground 
Past the point of no return, the oath has been sworn 
A new sea of blood is bound here to be formed 

Have no fear, pain is here 

Fire! Fire! 
Liberating, everlasting, mesmerising flame 
Fire! The flames grow higher 
The soul-consuming. dominating messenger of pain 

Fire! Fire! 
Consumes the flesh, reduces to ash, all thatâs in its way 
Fire! Sings like a choir 
Thereâs no escape from melodies of abysmal dismay 

On the other side, in the haunting dark the Eternal Queen was ready to strike 
Casting spells of unspeakable woe, each one more deadly as her power grows 

A courageous guild started a coup 

They ambushed the Queen with a magical cloud 
Blinded by rage she let her guard down 
With all their strength they vigorously fought 
For hours on end, until she was caught 
They dragged her far away from here, never to be found 
She was put on a torture wheel, head facing the ground 
For every fallen ally they threw a sack of stones 
The ambiance was filled with the sound of her cracking bones 
They hacked her into pieces, cut every vein 
She couldnât die but she felt excruciating pain 
As the final step they set her body alight 
Her immortal soul was crushed with this gruesome sight 

Comatose 
From pain receptorsâ overdose 
She couldnât move or breathe 
Her soul collapsed 
She couldnât stand it any more 
And once again 
She was dead 

Her soul began the journey towards the sky 
Leaving her torturers petrified 
Impervious darkness covers the plains 
No light will there ever shine again 
The Flaming Crown felt a part of him die 
Absurdly still hoping that sheâs alive 
Riding swiftly towards the cursed site 
This fate he will not recognise 

Approached 
The place where once she stood 
But all that was left 
Was burnt flesh 
Devoured by emotions, his madness reached new heights 
Cathartically killing everything in sight 
The gateway from the afterlife was permanently closed 
No undead soldiers evermore arose 
Enemies and allies were all wiped alike 
Abidingly put down by his fatal strike 
Over his own actions he lost all control 
For where was his soul is now a massive hole 

He wonât stop until theyâre all dead 
If he could, he would cut his own head 
All the world united to try to take him down 
But they failed to even touch his crown 

How can you kill that which will not die 
To whom the comfort of death is denied? 
How do you crush that which has no soul 
That lost its purpose and ultimate goal? 

Waves of soldiers met their gruesome end 
Some even by their own hand 
They embrace their deaths as a welcome release 
From this living hell stripped off any sort of peace 

Now theyâre all dead 
The sea is full of lead 

Sitting on the edge of a bloody shore 
Of his sanity he slowly regains control 
All around him are fields of corpses 
In his mind he still hears their voices 
Outcome of this battle, the final score 
He lost all he was working for 
After a deep thought, to him it occurred 
He is now the ruler of (an) empty world
