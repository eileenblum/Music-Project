The stars are falling, the sky is burning, the end seems to be nigh 
Every living creature is trembling, praying soon to die 
The fire is spreading through the lands as a symbol of his reign 
Thereâs nothing left but tantalising pain, will it ever end? 

âAs a servant in my kingdom you will need no soul, 
So let it bleed and embrace the darkness while I take control. 
Let mercury into your veins and may sulphur be your breath 
For when itâs done you wonât be afraid of death, ever againâ 

âCause when theyâre dead 
They rise again 
The torture never ends 
Theyâre screaming 

For generations his rotten hordes executed terrors untold 
Blasphemous prophecies were true: heâs never getting old! 
Blessed with immortality and a mind set on sin 
With sardonic wrath his hate is burning deeply from within 

Appropriation of seven kingdoms is the only dream he ever had 
His merciless fleet manned by lead-filled corpses is ready to cross the sea of blood 

Non-conforming! 

Dominantly marching forth, heâs reaching his goal 
The unquestioned rule of the macrocosm as whole 
Scorching the grounds and blazing is his campaign 
His constitution only recognises pain 

Never-ending pain
