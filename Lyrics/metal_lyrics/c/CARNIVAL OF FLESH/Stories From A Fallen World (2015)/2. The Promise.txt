Cold was the night when I was told of all miseries known to men 
Secrets worth more than gold, I lost my soul then. 
This grotesque tome of wretchedness held malevolent runes that showed me pain 
All the pain and suffering that you shall obtain! 

Misery to the world, I've come to spread 
I'm your worst fear, from now till the last day 
I am your pain and I'll be your death 
I'll make you scream, now and always! 
You'll remember grief that comes with my face 
Your flesh I will tear, It's time for my reign! 

All these ancient scrolls have shown me a new way, a way of grotesque endangering 
Iâm a deathless apparition which brings your end with solemnity and brutality 

For what you have hoped that will be your end 
That will bring you peace and rest in this reign 
Will just make worse and pain will just blend 
Blood in your tears will show (that) there's no way 
To get off this carnival of the damned 
No good will you gain under my command 

You're of no worth if you're dead - not to me, 'cause I enjoy your pain and suffering 
I'm the supreme core of evil in all being 
I adore my monstrosity
