It was less than a century ago when you came 
Claiming your innocence 
With words that our destinies are the same 
Slowly they fade away... 
Just the image of your burning flesh 
...burning, burning... 
Now itâs the only thing on my mind 
...wish I left it all behind... 
They slaughtered you for a wrong cause 
Oh, how have I been blind... 
I wish I was dead myself 
So we could rule eternity, all again 

Soon I'll be with you, my precious love 

I will torture myself to death 
To repay all I owe to you 
I will come to you as pure as a God...
