[Instrumental]Environmental scientists and engineers now describe the current era as planet Earth's sixth mass extinction.

Its cause: humans.

Approximately half of all now-living plants and animal species in the world's densely bio-diverse regions are risking extinction due to global warming and climate change.

The rate the world's sea level is rising suggests that it may lead to a rapid change, which would create momentous problems for citizens that live in coastal regions.

This had led scientists to describe these days as the Anthropocene: a new geological era constructed by humans.

The recent unparalleled temperatures in the Arctic as well as the data showing abnormal rises in upper-atmosphere methane levels converge to give the impression that the near future of the entire human race is at stake.
