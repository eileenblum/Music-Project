[Instrumental]Present-time data and temperature acceleration at the poles as well as current weather patterns aroundâtheâglobe confirm theânotion that we are already atâthe center of dramatic changes that will have a massive and devastating impact on agriculture over the next two decades.

These escalating impacts will be disastrous to the livelihoods of the societies in which we live. Everyday behavior that we call 'our civilization' will deteriorate. It is worrying that humanity has found itself in a situation of its own doing, where we debate the validity of the scientific analysis of our own near-term extinction.

Annihilation is necessary.
