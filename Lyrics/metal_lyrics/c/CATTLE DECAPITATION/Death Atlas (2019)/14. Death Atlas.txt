Alas, the deed is done
Mankind has come and gone
Carbon based life forms reset to day one
Fire now rages on

We thought we had enough time to redesign through human minds
To do our time for this life of crime, seems this is the end of the line
We casketed hope in bureaucracy, sunk to the bottom of the sea
Out of sight out of mind out of love for money

We deserve everything that's coming
We'll take this world to our graves

There's no fear for tomorrow when there's no trust for today
There's no ever after... debts have to be paid

We deserve everything that's coming
We took this world to our graves... we made its creatures our slaves
Shattered the hourglass... an unerasable past...
Humans: Demons, deranged and depraved

We deserve everything that's coming!
We took this world to our graves!
We deserve everything that's coming!
We took this world to our graves!

Alas, the deed is done
Mankind now dead and gone
Post-anthropocene - Earth reset to day one
Fire now rages on

There's no fear for tomorrow when there's no trust for today
There's no ever after... debts have to be paid

We deserve everything that's coming
We took this world to our graves... we made its creatures our slaves
Shattered the hourglass... an unerasable past...
Humans: Demons, deranged and depraved

And I count the days 'til we expire our ways
And I count the days 'til we expire for always

To be alive is to survive everything....
To make do with anything... until we die

To be alive is to squander everything....
To stumble towards anything... to feel alive
