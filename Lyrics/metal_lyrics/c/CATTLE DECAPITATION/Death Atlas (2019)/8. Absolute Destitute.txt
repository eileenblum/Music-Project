Life... the spark that trajects us into this
Heavenly body that makes us
These carbon-based systems
Predators and victims of a life on this earth
We are birthed with the worst intentions intent
To condemn everything with inventions
We're born to destroy and obsessed with the thought of destruction

Upon nascency - we become casualties
We walk the edge of the scythe taunting eternity
An abnormality since our maternity
A certain carnality for our morality

Ever the victim of eyes inside our mind
That sees this life as an affliction
So dead inside, the plot thickens with sickness showing symptoms
Extinguished synapses smoldering with persistence
Of a mind hellbent on suicide

A life in love with despair
In a world beyond repair
A global consensus that the powers that be are against us
Helplessness beyond compare

We're flying too close to the sun
We play with fire - we tempt our fate -
Life alights the flame to burn our hate

We fall like heavenly bodies burning
We fall in the cracks of her earthquake - might be too late

We're flying too close to the sun
We play with fire - we tempt our fate -
Life alights the flame to burn our hate

Life... the pulse that leaves us alone on an earth with the worst
Ideas ever known by the flesh with emotions of stone
Poisoning land and the oceans

A life in love with despair
In a world beyond repair
A global consensus that the powers that be are against us
Helplessness beyond compare

A carbon-based disease
That brings all life to its knees
