[Decibel Flexi &amp; European Bonus Track]As populations explode
sustainability and all hope will erode - its time we reset the clock before the hourglass implodes on itself and on us,
its on us to adjust ourselves

Its timeâ¦. to dineâ¦ on mankind

An invasive species corrupting entirely
âHumanityâ, âa civilized societyâ, oh the irony
Self-righteous organisms salivating at the thought of slavery
Permeating, enslaving with audacious depravity

To recondition our eco-systems
To reposition - man is now the victim

Cannibalistic invasivorism
An indigenous reclamation

Through violence
Through hate
Through inhumanity
Au naturale

Its timeâ¦ we dieâ¦ for the love of life

An unnatural practice, to restore balance, to combat the malice
introduced by man
Thinning the herders, culinary murder
Eco-crusaders, eating the invaders

To recondition our eco-systems
To reposition - man is now the victim

Through violence
Through hate
Through inhumanity
Au naturale
