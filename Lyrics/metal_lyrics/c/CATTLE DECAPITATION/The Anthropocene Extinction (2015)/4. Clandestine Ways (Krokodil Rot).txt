The human animal
so similar in so many ways
to our mammalian counterparts
experimented on in torturous ways
We've freed the "specimens"
We've taken over the facility
We've captured these torturers
Time to teach them some humility

AH... syringes filled with dihydrodesoxymorphine
I've combed the streets in search of hypodermic
needles and dirty sharp hoarding
All aboard this ship of fools, this train of pain is finally boarding
Tendinous disintegration, irreparable musculature goring

Ah these shameless ways we get our fix...
we get our kicks off human suffering
through puncturing the skin accidentally restructuring
Epimysium covering

No need for anesthetics, your research for cosmetics landed
you here on my gurney, hurting, gurgling diuretics
Tube in your anus leads to open sores creating sepsis
Septic shock sets in - No asepsis in my cold aesthetics
Apathetic, yet frenetic, simply unsympathetic,
shredded limbs needing prosthetics, best to just call off the medics

How does it feel?
Multi-Dermal peel - that shall never heal
These clandestine ways - of distributing pain
Diseased train of thought - krokodil rot

Oh this desire... to see your limbs on fire...
This sick exhilaration... of total excruciation...

Ah these shameless ways we get our fix...
we get our kicks off human suffering
through puncturing the skin accidentally restructuring
Epimysium covering

Now I believe I've seen everything
of what this subspecies is capable of producing
Why do we do these things?
Is this the meaning of "human being"?
Bleeding is believing
