Detruncated
Legs forced down into pavement
By hole in flatbed truck
Blatantly painful roadrash device
Shredding limbs when appendages need a trim
Two solid bloody lines for miles
Grinded bone, muscle-flesh fragments
Grated up to the waist
Screaming stump for the vultures to taste
Left by the roadside-ded
Amputation through roadrash
Left by the roadside
Dead
