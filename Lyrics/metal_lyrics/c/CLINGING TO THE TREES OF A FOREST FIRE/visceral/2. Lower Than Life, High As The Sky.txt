In front of my eyes
A slow motion world on fire
Crushed and buried 
My arms are cut with glass
And rage
My life-fucked
What amount of drugs
Will clean the hole in my heart?
Fill the hole in my heart?
Traveling through a sea of rot
Swimming with me
High as the sky and lower than life
God? God?
Not in this life
FUCK.
