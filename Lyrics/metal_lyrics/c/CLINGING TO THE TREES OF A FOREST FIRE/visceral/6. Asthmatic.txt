An ever flowing river of blood
Drains from the hole in my stomach
Socially disemboweled
When the panic sets
I am suffocated by the modern world
When the shades are drawn
I aim my gun at the modern world
Fucking the mouth of my pathetic self abuse
Ruined by life as a ritual
Crawling inside of my mind
Out of the hands of life
Kill as a savage
Eat the enemy while they sleep
Burn the cloth
Don't believe in anything
Don't believe in anything
