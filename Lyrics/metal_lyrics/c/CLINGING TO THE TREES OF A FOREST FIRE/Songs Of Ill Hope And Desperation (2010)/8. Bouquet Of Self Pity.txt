A bouquet of flowers made from self pity the colors of the halo.
I choke on gasoline.
On the soles of my feet every color of the earth on fire.
A world on fire.
I inhale the smoke of the earth.
Humanity washed in flames.
A cancer in my fucking lungs.
The feet of angels all over my fucking shit covered face.
My name caught in your throat cut me out.
Wash away all of my sins in a river of human waste.
Blessed by dead mothers eyes.
The cleanest I've felt inside.
