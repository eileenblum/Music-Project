The smeared shit on their skin so they could blend in at night I can hear them howling.
I can feel their footsteps all over my soft spots.
Years of degeneration.
The hell of a cold world surrounded by starving wolves.
She sleeps soundly in our cave while I try to dig my way out of it.
Trapped on the inside of my soft spots.
