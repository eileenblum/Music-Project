Slave to my job the wage the paycheck.A noose of dollar bills on every newborn, from the nursery to the grave.Sick of being nailed to a social security number.Living under the trough all I wanted was a horse a plow and three hundred acres of shit I want a horse a plow and three hundred acres of shit.This is rightfully mine.I am but an enslaved god among pig faced men.
