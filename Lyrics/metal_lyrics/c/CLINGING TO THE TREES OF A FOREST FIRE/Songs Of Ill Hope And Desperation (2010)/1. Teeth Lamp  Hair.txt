A crimson pool dries in thePalms of my hands 1,000Sleepless nights, 26Worrisome years i'veBared my teethAnd sunk them into theFlesh of my enemyFaith in myself runs redHuman memory decaysUnder a blanket of smokeFreedom in isolationRemove the eyes and withdrawIsolate remove the human fleshAnd disappear
