[performed by Cannabis Corpse]It was the moment that I first heard the sirens
And saw the panicked news reporters on my t.v screen 
I got the feeling that this was more than terrorist
But theirs no way I could have known how fucked up things would be

Inhalation Plague!

I heard reports of a green toxic vapor 
Spreading from a growhouse burning down in east L.A
A lethal mix of T.H.C and bathsalts
Once inhaled would drive its victims to hurt others than themselves

Inhalation Plague!

I had no time to panic
The cloud of death
It would soon be here

Blowing reefer beyond my darkest fears!

I felt lightheaded then a little woozy
A burning in my nostrils like I'd never felt before
I knew the symptom was the first sign of exposure
My coughing would not stop as I rubbed bloodshot eyes

My hair began falling out 
It fell in clumps lightly to the floor
I was so high I stopped even trying to think

The mental doorway in my mind gave away
Bloodcurdling visions of pain and death
An overwhelming urge taking over my thoughts
We must shed blood to please the reefer gods

No longer in control
I limped strangely out of my front door
I went outside
Tonight someone I know will die!

I paid no heed to the chaos all around me
Explosions rumbled in the distance but I did not care
A brick that was lying in some rubble
smashed a neighbor's window so I could get inside

I knew the family was hiding in the basement
They would be a sacrifice
To my new master now
So with a steak knife I stole out of their kitchen

I sliced their fucking throats!
