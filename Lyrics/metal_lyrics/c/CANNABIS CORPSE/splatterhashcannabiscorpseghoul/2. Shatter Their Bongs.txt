[performed by Cannabis Corpse]Writhing in his own filth
Mumbling strange phrases
Spoken with foul words
Used by the ancient ones
His mind is a blank void
Brain cells have been destroyed
He's confined to a cell and completely insane

On the wall of his cell
Drawings smeared in his own shit
His mindless rambling
Keeps repeating the same thing

Theirs no time!

We must shatter their bongs!
We must shatter their bongs!
We must shatter their bongs!

Or I'm going to die!

Patient 9833463
Has spent his whole life in cell block 420
A pale shell of a former stoner
Doomed to die!

Experiments have twisted his brain
In this hospital for the mentally deranged
He's addicted to potent high grade weed eternally

The one night it happened
No one could explain
How so many people were never seen again
They searched the whole building
But could find no trace of anyone who had been in that place

Psychic detectives used their gifts to try to find some clues
When they relived their deaths
They screamed as they gouged out their eyes

Theirs no time!

We must shatter their bongs!
We must shatter their bongs!
We must shatter their bongs!

Or I'm going to die!
