Behind the shadows
Foul beings searching for your stash
They are creatures known as weedless ones

Watching and waiting
Pinching your bag until it is gone
Taken by the weedless ones

Putrid rat-like goblins to abhorrent to ever see sunlight
Repellent human-like faces and bodies
But more animal than they are man

Their search for drugs left them deformed
They are deranged,
Pumping through their veins crushing levels of THC
Diminutive blasphemies

Cursed with crippling addiction
They're slaves to narcotics
The weedless ones

Have come for you tonight
While you're passed out in your mom's basement
Silent they smoke your last hit
Leaving none left when you awaken
You look at the coffee table
to see that your last bong hit has now been stolen

You search the floor and between the couch cushions
But you'll never see that Weed again
In the distance you can hear them laughing at you
There's nothing you can do
But to accept the hand that you've been dealt and think about killing yourself

Cursed with crippling addiction
They're slaves to narcotics

The weedless ones
They've come for you
while you're baked watching television
distracted you let your guard down
Now your Bag of Pot can't be found!

[Solo: Hallhammer]

Behind the shadows
Foul beings searching for your stash
They are creatures known as weedless ones
Watching and waiting
Pinching your bag until it is gone
Taken by the weedless ones

Tonight they've come for you
while you are eating that old pizza
You thought you could have a midnight snack
Now you'll never get your Weed back!
