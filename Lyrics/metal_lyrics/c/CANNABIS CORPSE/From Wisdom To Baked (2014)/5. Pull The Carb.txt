Fire, billows from the rib-cage
My victims torso filling with smoke
I am gripping the cadavers scalp

A violent jerk removes the head
My lungs inhale the smoke from its neck
My stoned expression, my face is covered
in gore

I killed you inside your home
Then I filled your corpse with Smoke
I will decapitate you

To pull the carb
Inhale the bong load of 
Weed through the neck stump
My grotesque fantasy will be a reality
Nothing can stop me 'til I get my fix
I lust to pull the carb
Everyday I need to find a new victim
I'll never be satisfied
until the smoke is inside
The moment you die
Nothing will ever get you any more high

My apartment is full of rotting cadavers
Marijuana masks the disgusting stench
My life is a horrific nightmare

Resin forms in the chest cavity
Inside the lifeless body of the deceased
The vital organs have been removed inside

It will never end
Taking bong loads from your open neck hole

I killed you inside your home
Then I filled your corpse with Smoke
I will decapitate you

To pull the carb
Inhale the bong load of 
Weed through the neck stump
My grotesque fantasy will be a reality
Nothing can stop me 'til I get my fix
I lust to pull the carb
Everyday I am out searching for victims
I'll never be satisfied
until the smoke is inside
The moment you die
Nothing will ever get you any more high
