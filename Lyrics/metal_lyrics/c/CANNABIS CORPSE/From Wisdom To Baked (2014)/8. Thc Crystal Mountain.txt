[Solo: Brent Purgason]

Sweat drenched, exhale the holy smoke.
Feel its power take over your soul
Enter the realm of pain and death
You are now under its control

Bow to its hellish majesty
Its will shall be done

The THC Crystal Mountain

Many others have come to kneel before it, they are just slaves
Forever lost inside its bast and terrible maze
These stoners are cursed forever to be
Endlessly Jones-ing without any Weed
Lost for eternity

You are not going to share their fate
It has something else for you in store
You have been chosen to command
Its armies in the Marijuana wars

Bow to its hellish majesty
Its will shall be done

The THC crystal mountain

You are not going to share their fate
It has something else for you in store
You have been chosen to command
Its armies in the Marijuana wars

Bow to its hellish majesty
Its will shall be done

The THC crystal mountain

The ground below begins to mutate
Forming into a giant gate
A wormhole to get back to earth
The Marijuana army now awaits
Screaming souls begin to billow
Like smoke rising out of a bong
From the top of the horrible mountain
Swirling in a terrifying maelstrom

Bow to its hellish majesty
Its will shall be done

The THC crystal mountain
