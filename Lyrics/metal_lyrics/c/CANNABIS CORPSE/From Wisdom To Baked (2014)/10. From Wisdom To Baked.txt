[Part 1]

Beyond the reach
Of our modern day carefree living
In complete isolation
Lived a family of sick backwoods cretins
Drug induced retardation
They had no money for fertilizer
To use to feed their precious plants
That's when this story gets absurd....

A strange urban legend started to spread
In the nearby town, the rumors said
There was a hidden field of
Pot in the woods
But bad things happen if you are caught

From wisdom to baked
From wisdom to baked

Three more teenagers decided to try
They couldn't have known how gruesomely they'd die

From wisdom to baked
From wisdom to baked

Their plan was simple
It was going to be fun
It would be a big mistake
A nightmare that has only just begun

They started to loose track of time
The car had been left behind
Directions were getting crisscrossed
It sunk in that they were starting to get lost

Getting tired and frustrated, they'd had enough
Setting up a campsite to spend the night
Alone, the batteries were dead in their cellphones
Everyone was worried, they just wanted to go home

From wisdom to baked

The night was dark and they were terrified
They had the feeling that something wasn't right

From wisdom to baked
From wisdom to baked

No one inside the tent would ever see
That they were being surrounded by hillbillies
