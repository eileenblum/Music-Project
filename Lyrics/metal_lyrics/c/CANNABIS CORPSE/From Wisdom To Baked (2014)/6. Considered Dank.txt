Snow clad mountains loom behind jagged glaciers

Its rate of growth was highly alarming
Spreading quickly over every surface of our ship
Our team of scientists evacuated
On several escape rafts to a nearby icy shore
Attempts to contact help proved useless
We had to find shelter from the frigid temperatures
Two of us went out to scout the surroundings
To find a way to survive in this cold

We spotted something in the distance
At the foot of a massive mountain
An opening to a small cavern
There could be safe haven within
When we returned to report

There bodies were torn limb from limb
The snow was red with pools of blood
Spreading from bite marks in their skin

How could this have happened?
Terror began to set in

I turned in time to see
My former colleague
Wielding a bloody knife
Coming for me!!
