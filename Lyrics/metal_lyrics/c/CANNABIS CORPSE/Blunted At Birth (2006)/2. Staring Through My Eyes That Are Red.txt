Follow down into my lair
Rotten smell, they smoke their weed there
Her heady weed hits the air
I awake, from my coffin I stare
Shaking hands, their bowl has fallen
To me this night, the pot has callen
I awake from death to toke it
Hand from the ground, now I claim and smoke it
Smoke it
Give to me, I wait and lie
Graveyard slaughter, must get high
Must get you dead
Skull I split and scalp I peel
Blazed as shit, can this be real
Stoned as shit now
Flesh I crave
For my munchies its your brain I save
My coffin waits, I throw you in
Decomposing, still my session will begin
You scream at me, I rip your throat
Sprinkle PCP and smoke on that boat
Soon it hits my brain, deep within
For rigor mortis stiffness, it does the trick
It does the trick
Loosened up now, I tear you to shreds
Staring at you madly through these eyes that are red
Red
Loosened up now, I tear you to shreds
Staring at you madly through these eyes that are red
Stoned as shit now
Flesh I crave
For my munchies its your brain I save
Blazed as shit, can this be real
Skull I split and scalp I peel
Staring through my eyes that are red
