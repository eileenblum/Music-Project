Smashing the doritos bag
Munching religiously
Dealings from the ones who plant the seeds of weed
Wasting inherent smoke
Confronting an inner cough
Praising subconsciously the ones who harvest the seeds of weed

How can humans play God when they are all stoned?
Their lack of weed will lead them to an early grave
Condemned to live a life of unrelenting sobriety
Their rotted corpse refrains when weed replaces life

Tearing the vocal chords of prophets that smoke of weed uncultivated
They are the ones growing the seeds of weed

How can humans play God when all they are are stoned?
Their lack of weed will lead them to an early grave
Condemned to live a life of unrelenting sobriety
Their rotted corpse refrains when weed replaces life

Fearing their reality they chose a random dealer
When all laws would cease and THC would uelease
Smoking the weak pot they did seek
Foretelling demise speaking only stoned lies

Smoking the senseless souls of mindless
Inhabitants not knowing they are the ones
Consuming the seeds of weed
Smoking the source of stimulation unnurtured
Realization of fools who will always against their
Will just end their lives

How can humans play God when all they are are stoned?
Their lack of weed will lead them to an early grave
Condemned to live a life of unrelenting sobriety
Their rotted corpse refrains when weed replaces life
