Massive monuments of black stone
Servants of the ancient green gods
To be wiser, mind expansion
Raising the plant of the gods inception
Into their tomb, you'll rot away
Rot to feed the wicked weed of decay
Massive vines of weed
Sadistic reefer worship
Tribute is paid into its name
Grown alone by blood this herb is made
No one must know or to utter aloud
Hooded masses and demonic crowds
Reefer stashed place
Heretical rites with a sickle knife
Madly butchered human sacrifice
Reefer stashed place
Total temple hot-box
Evil fucking your thoughts
Bodies grinded
Mixed with shit
Shovel the parts into the pit
Indoor is grown to make the demons proud
The essence of weed we've crowned
No one must know or utter aloud
Hooded masses and demonic crowds
Reefer stashed place
Heretical rites with a sickle knife
Madly butchered human sacrifice
Reefer stashed place
