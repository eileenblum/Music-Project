Nightmares torment me
Evil visions of death
Why must these terrors
Relentlessly infect my mind
A nightmare from which I can never escape
Am I now doomed to never awake?
To never awakeâ¦

In the haze of my restless slumber
A ghastly sight appears before me
A thousand maggot infested burnt out stoners
Foul rotting dead exhumed from the soil
All of them nailed to unholy crosses
A grotesque homage to the dark lord

Paralyzed in fear I must now watch
This evil effigy to the forgetful raised to the sky
Their stomachs bloat with worms
I vomit at the sight and smell
When corpses begin to spill out all their innards
Showering guts
A fountain of blood
A lake of pus
Only the sound of my own screaming
Can be heard during this brutal display

Effigy of the forgetful

Overtaken with shock I begin twitching
My mind cannot comprehend this vile beauty
I am reduced to nothing
My fragile grip on sanity slips away

I fall to my knees pleading for mercy
I know the gods of this realm are only laughing
Hooded figures surround me
An empty cross awaits
My destinyâ¦

Nightmares torment me
Evil visions of death
Why must these terrors
Relentlessly infect my mind

Never escape...
I will never awakeâ¦
Never awakeâ¦
Never awakeâ¦
