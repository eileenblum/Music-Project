Death is all around meâ¦
The battle rages on in the year 4020
Taken prisoner by weed overlords
I fear for my life and have lost
All hope of being saved

They feast on our flesh
Taking their revenge
The screams of pain and anguish is all I can hear
Surely it will drive me insane

Kill meâ¦
Locked in a cage
So confused and cold
What horrors are awaiting?
How has this become my fate?
Dragged from the cage by a rusty hook through my ribcage to be hung over a flame to cook

I feel my body burning
Intense anguish takes hold as my organs begin melting
Screaming in pain as I die
The fetid odor of charred flesh fills the sky

All to feed
The chronic breedâ¦

My smoldering corpse
Devoid of all life is thrown crassly into a giant grinder

My remains made into the perfect fertilizer to feed the Sativa Queen
Ancient cruel leader that gave birth to these foul pot creatures
This offering pleases their master
Humans are on the menu now!

Sickening bright green ooze
Seeps out the eggs sacks
Harvested by the slaves
High grade this mucus
Coveted, treated as a delicacy
A holy gift to the queen's addicted army

Day by day the eggs hatch with no end in sight
The world is barren wasted
Populated with her vile spawn
All life faces its extinction
All to feed the chronic breed!

The chronic breedâ¦

Kill meâ¦
Locked in a cage
So confused and cold
What horrors are awaiting?
How has this become my fate?
Dragged from the cage by a rusty hook through my ribcage to be hung over a flame to cook
