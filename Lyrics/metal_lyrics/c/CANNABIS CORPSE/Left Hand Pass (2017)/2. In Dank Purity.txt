Watching, waitingâ¦
The wretched art that soon I'll be creating
is placating my abhorrent evil lust
my illness in the stillness
is worsened by voices so relentless
I can't resist their hideous and unyielding commandment

My victim's home alone, its late at nightâ¦
I have been studying her every movement
Smoking weed she did not notice me
sneaking into her dark apartment

So close I can smell her lovely skin
Bloodcurdling murder will soon begin
The gleam of the knife raised above my head
fills me with remorse it will be stained by bloodshed

I FEEL!
A wave of sick pleasure as I begin stabbing her
MURDER!
Gore showers on me I am filled with ecstasy
I FEEL!
A wave of sick pleasure as I begin stabbing her

ALL IN DANK PURITY

Gagging on blood, a quick struggle
her whimpering only makes me chuckle
I try to savor each and every moment
euphoric my face locked in an evil grin
I shall unlock the beauty deep within
her lungs still contain the smoke of her final toke

Insane, Psychotic
each slash and stab i find very erotic
A monster reveling in depravity
I can not control these urges
or when the demon inside reemerges
This violence is the only thing thats real within myself

I FEEL!
A wave of sick pleasure as I begin stabbing her
MURDER!
Gore showers on me I am filled with ecstasy
I FEEL!
A wave of sick pleasure as I begin stabbing her

ALL IN DANK PURITY

Not done yet, so frantic i've become obsessed
breaking the ribs to open up her chest
Take time to admire the heavenly organs
cannot wait to poke a small hole in her lung
inhale the smoke inside this pretty one
my repugnant vision is now done..
