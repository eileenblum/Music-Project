Sativa master, mighty lord of weed
(Mighty lord of weed)
Please grant your knowledge unto me

The foul bringer of bud shall be
Reborn in the smoke (reborn in the smoke)
Invoke holy spirit of the one most dank

Long have we
Traveled seeking
Weed most divine
We must get high

You stand upon necks of authority
At each side the bongs of chaos
Thousands of dead shall lay before me
Roasting the bones of our enemyâ¦ the enemyâ¦

"Read from the papyrus containing the spell to protect its possessor against attacks from he who is in the bong water"

Protection from the loathsome
Non-smokers we seek
Oh great one of exalted herb please bestow us
With your dank gifts
Bowls that burn the souls of the slain
Praise to the altars of glass
Bless us with your exhalation
Open your holy lungs
Savage and unmerciful
Laying waste to everything
Primordial anger
Now unleashed!

You stand upon necks of authority
At each side the bongs of chaos
Thousands of dead shall lay before me
Roasting the bones of our enemyâ¦ the enemyâ¦

"Read from the papyrus containing the spell to protect its possessor against attacks from he who is in the bong water"
