Feel the blood flow out your veins
As you start to die
See the deep wounds in your wrists
A gruesome suicideâ¦

Life is slipping away but it isn't over yet
There's one last moment before
You breathe the final breath
Exhale the smoke inside
Then gaze within the cloud
Behold the vision so hideous and foul

The vapor takes shape into a grotesque face
Eerie glowing green eyes
Now are loathsomely gazing upon you

Terror that shakes you to your very soul
So close now to the brink of death
As your body begins to grow cold
A ghastly voice speaks

"Eternal damnation awaits
Upon the final exhalation"
"Eternal damnation awaits
Upon the final exhalation"

Slowly your heart stops beating,
Eyes close now forever
The light does not come, this demon of reefer
Devours your soul, cursing it to the void
Another stoner claimed for its hellish master

Feel the blood flow out your veins
As you start to die
See the deep wounds in your wrists
A gruesome suicideâ¦

Life is slipping away but it isn't over yet
There's one last moment before
You breathe the final breath
Exhale the smoke inside
Then gaze within the cloud
Behold the vision so hideous and foul
