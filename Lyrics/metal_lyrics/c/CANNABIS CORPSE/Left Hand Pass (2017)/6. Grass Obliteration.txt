My out of control obsession
With cheefing tons of weed
Has made me antisocial,
I have been cast from society
Soon I will have my revenge
On those that kept me down
I will not rest until the whole world's burning

Building a machine perfect for killing
Certain death is coming
For all those who oppose me
I am hostile! I am armed!
With a powered exoskeleton
Bringing bulletproof pain

Converted engine
Burning the methane from Cannabis
The pistons pump so perfectly on T.H.C.

Turrets fully loaded
Targets have been locked
My finger's on the trigger
Bring forth my havoc!

People screaming the police can do nothing
Carnage, destruction
My day of retribution's begun

Slaughtering my tormentors
Laughing at the blood and gore
This anguish that I feel inside
I feel no longer when I watch them die!

Grass obliteration!
Grass obliteration!
