The skies grew black in Richmond
The clouds came suddenly, in thunderous wakes the herald of slaughter
An oblong hole a mile long
A portal to nowhere? Or perhaps a portal to putrescent party-foul

Water spills forth, billions of tons, out from the sky, people running for their lives
Drowning in fear, sickening stench, unable to breathe bong water, beer, and piss
Water spills forth, billions of tons, out from the sky, dead bodies floating open-eyed
Drowning in fear, sickening stench, unable to breathe bong water, beer, and piss

Bongwaterlogged corpses floating
Twisted dead faces are bloating
Gross
Senselessly submerged
Sick
Mummies reemerge

Contaminated mass of murdered funky-smelling zombies murmur
Objections to their new form
And other bodies bob above the lurid sea of gruesome gore
Victims of resin storms
Shuddersome, the mutants come in droves they swim through weed-like scum
Fluids used to transform
Flesh turned green like some bad dream, aquatic beasts and fearsome fiends

Water spills forth, billions of tons, out from the sky, people running for their lives
Drowning in fear, sickening stench, unable to breathe bong water, beer, and piss
Water spills forth, gajillions of tons, out from the sky, dead bodies floating open-eyed
As mutants some survive, even then not alive
Human life to deprive, liquids are pushed inside
Mummified in bong water
