Beneath the summer skies I gaze upon the passing of the sun, the daylight dies
Remote this wilderness, I pack myself a monster of a bowl behind the veil of mist

Vacation here in Canada, I came to see the northern lights and I came here for the buds
To pass this time in solitude, and to clear my head
A clear and eerie sky, there's an opening in the clouds, the stars are shining brightly
From beside a lake I watch, for the dancing

Northern lights, I spark the pipe, to get feeling right
But the THC tears into me
Not so fine, but the bud is kind, and the lights I find
Now I know I'm high because lights fall from the sky
No one can hear my cry

The burn in my eyes, clouded vision, psychedelic surprise
All around me the lights make their advance

Like a great green ghost
Stellar stalker, unfamiliar cosmic host

Fucked with northern lights, madness, paranoia, fright
Fucked with northern lights, this fancy bud ain't so tight
I fail to scream but my body's being entered by this thing
Glowing green orbs flight, I'm really getting fucked tonight

Paralyzed with fear the northern lights appear
If I'd known it'd be like this I'd have settled for a beer

Northern lights, I spark the pipe, to get feeling right
But the THC tears into me
Not so fine, but the bud is kind, and the lights I find
Now I know I'm high, I have now lost my mind
