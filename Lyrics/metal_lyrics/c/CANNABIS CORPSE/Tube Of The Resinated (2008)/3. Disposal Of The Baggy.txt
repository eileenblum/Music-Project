A fake bag of grasses what you've gone and sold "Legal Herbs" mixed with under-couch discovered mold
Mail-order crap, we could tell it right away
But the mold has made us murderous and now you'll have to...
Pay for it, bet on that
Scream for it, eat my shit
Our cash as well as your stash
After the beating we rip you limb from limb
Limb from limb, seed and stem, shitty friend weed
I'm sure you've made worse mistakes in your life
Try and tell that to this rusty axe and butcher's knife
Come to your house and strap you into bed
Hideous torture, you'll be begging for your death
Squirm in disgust, scream if you must
Hope for you is lost, and all at what cost?
Cut out the tongue, spiked bat is swung
Groin has been smashed, mouth and cheeks have been slashed
Rip the jaws, pack fake pot into the mouth, then light it up
Hold him down, smoke it now, getting stoned? I think so
Smoke the weed out of the living head
Brain resin shall leave you undead
Torturous justice served and coughing heard by disposal of the baggy
Destroyed ironically, another shitty dealer gone and off the streets
Torturous justice served, revenge is earned by disposal of the baggy
Violent maimed, now dead, he took a 1/4 pound of that fake shit to the head
Justice served and coughing heard by disposal of the baggy
Destroyed ironically, another shitty dealer gone and off the streets
Torturous justice served, revenge is earned by disposal of the baggy
Violently mained, now dead, he took a 1/4 pound of that fake shit to the head
