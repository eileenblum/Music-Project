There is something nasty pounding in my chest
Somethings wrong, Heart is racing, feeling awfully tense
Surprisingly my teeth are ripping through my tongue
Fast and sharp, a flame ingnited in my lungs
Am I just high? It's not just imagination
I'm burning alive!

Blaze of Torment

Excruciating terror, unable to stand
Smoke from all orifices, scream but I can't
Boils surface, excruciating damage
Boiling guts, now I am toast

Help! Do anything you can
Enduring a spontaneous combustion, man
Smoldering suicidde

Blaze Of Torment

Helpless I fry

Help! Do anything you can
Enduring a spontaneous combustion, man
Smoldering suicide

Blaze of Torment
