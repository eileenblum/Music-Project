Spiritual guidance, knowldege you seek
A request to receive fulfillment of all your needs
This vast emptiness, devoid of souls
The ceremony shall unfold

The longing, the needing, the feeding
Satiate you hunger, the cosmic answers you are breathing
The haunting, the frightening, obsessing
Through these pipes you will absorb

Deeply the fog released by swinging censers
The chapel of bowls
Evenly immolate herbs you must inhalate ritually
In the Chapel of bowls

Behind dark curtains
Moss-filled sacristy
Precious altar of emerald and echoing screams

The longing, the needing, the feeding
Satiate you hunger, the cosmic answers you are breathing
The haunting, the frightening, obsessing
Through these pipes you can hear

Echoing cantors chant vaporous vespers
The chapel of bowls
Odorous thuribles hearkening knowledge bestowed
In the chapel of bowls

Within dank monstrance
Pot ostensory
Precious altar of emerald and aquamarine
Wosrship the evil of majesties green

Spiritual guidance pipes help achieve
A consuming possession, engorgement upon this weed
Scrying embers cold, secret truths are shown
Master or slave?
In the chapel of bowls

Sit, stand, kneel, pray
