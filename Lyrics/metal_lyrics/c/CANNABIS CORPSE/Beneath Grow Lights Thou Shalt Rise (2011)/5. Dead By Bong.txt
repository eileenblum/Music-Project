I arrive at the scene
12 mangled bodies
D.O.A.
Looks like a wild party

This is less a house than a raw meat grinder
We'd better call for back up
The pure amount of gore I've never seen before
Excuse me while i vomit
And the pieces of the victims faces
Normally would not phase me
But this is gut-busted mondo mutilation
These dead chunks sure are weighty

I bury my emotions and return myself to work
Studying more closely, things aren't as they appear
Ruined faces all alike, skulls are gently smoking
Search among the bits of body any shred of evidence
Devastated livingroom, used rubbers and some beer
Ruined faces all alike, skulls are gently smoking

On closer inspection
What clue could fit?
Facial lacerations
Removed lips

Amidst the carnal carnage of this fatal swingers slaughter
A nauseating haze of thick narcotic mist
Astonishingly evident the bong had just been roasting
Overseeing everthing from within it's darkened corner
A lone and smoking bong seems to be our only witness

If I smoke will I learn?
Might as well try
Case closed with one quick burn?
Profiling
Drugs enjoyed before death
Their finall thrill
My lungs solve within breath
Bud beguiled
Inebriated, I unravel this mystery

Dead by bong
Literally dead by bong
Choke my last as I die too

My poisoned body breaks
Head explodes
I was wrong, I fucked up
I'm dead by bong too
