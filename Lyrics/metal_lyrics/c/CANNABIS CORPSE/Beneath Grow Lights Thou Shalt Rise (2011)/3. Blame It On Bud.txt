Green oppression, our choices at their discretion 
Control obsession, I think it's time we teach these politicians a lesson 

No more excuses, we've had enough, we're out for blood 
To save your lives you'll legalize 
but still you... 

Blame it on, blame it on, blame it on bud 
Problems seen aren't from weed 
Still they will blame it on bud 

Crime is intertwined by the scoring of drugs, made to be thugs 
They blame it on bud 
Lies, a sign of our times, into their minds, decriminalize 
or spill their blood 

Dropouts, gangs, and teenage births 
Depressed losers with no self-worth's 
All the things that parents fear 
All stem from drugs, TV and beer? 
Well I ain't buying that, it gets me pissed 
Nay-saying crooks- you're on our list 
Until it's taxed, it is quite clear 
Loss of profit is all they fear 

Its time to gather in line leaving behind protesting signs 
Getting our enemies high 
Spreading of lies, arise, militarize, attack from all sides 
Its coming to an end 

Drop guillotines in crimson spurts 
Stoners emerge on red alert 
Dragged through the streets by toking bangers 
Swing from the gallows by hemp-made hangers 
Arm yourselves for coup d'etat 
Marijuana militia martial law 
We won't stop till all of them are dead
