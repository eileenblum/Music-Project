Sincere devotion, I consecrate my loyalty
Replete devotion, I understand my purpose now

Permitting smoke to enter in
Intense sensation, crawling skin
Strength conferred as my reward
A surge of strength as I'm reborn

Sworn to the Bag
Container of my conscientiousness
Sworn to the Bag
A splendid sack my source of ruthlessness
Sworn to the Bag
My opposition finds unscrupulous
Sworn to the Bag
Your christian god I think is ludicrous
Sworn to the Bag
I am sworn to the Bag

Imbibe the fumes, unlock the chronic's might
The high resumes, for the Bag I burn, to the death I'll fight

The chains are broken, unrestricted, finally free
This strain evoken, operate omniscient weed

Permitting smoke to ender in
Intense sensation, crawling skin
Ambrosial piety, a test
Endochronic in excess

Sworn to the Bag
I'm not a wimp, I am a banger
Sworn to the Bag
It's not a crutch, it's my hammer
Sworn to the Bag
All other gots are meaningless
Sworn to the Bag
Yours on the cross I find ridiculous
Sworn to the Bag
The only golden calf that's worth it
Fuck it
