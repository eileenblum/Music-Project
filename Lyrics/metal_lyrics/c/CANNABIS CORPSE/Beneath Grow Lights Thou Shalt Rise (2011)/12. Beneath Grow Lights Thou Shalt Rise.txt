Beneath the ground
Lie the labs of men who
Who do play god
Hidden leaders
Chosen for their loyalty
Horrors grown from weed

Beneath the grow lights thou shall rise

Marijuana users abducted more frequently now
Habitual and recreative alike
Ignored like losers, no shred of evidence found
Media black-out, none to put up a fight

Beneath the grow lights thou shall rise
Rise

The men that I see, coldly looking at me

Above, gamma beams glowing with their toxic radiation
Below, foulness of experimental stem-cells and shit
Panic, your veins pumping with a green and sticky fluid
Terror, transforming, arise a budding creature
Who or What have you become?

Horrific sight beneath their eyes

Beneath grow lights though shall rise
