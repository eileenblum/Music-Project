Schizophrenic psycho
I have lost my mind
I did this to myself
Smoked until retarded, the world I blame
Swelling brain reprogrammed
No choice but to kill
Horrid transformation
Never be the same
Violence, blood spilled

I cannot stop smoking pot
Blazing jibs, toking lids
I cannot stop twisting doobs  
Vaping out, busting scuds

Kill the light
I require death to feel alright
Lungs breathe hate
These crimes will mentally masturbate

More gore, more grass
I can't seem to get enough
A horrifying menace to the ones I love
I come to a staggering realization
I've become a lunatic of pot's creation

Hands do things
The bats are stirring in my belfry
Who's the boss?
The monster in the mirror is proof enough I'm crazy

More gore, more grass
I can't seem to get enough
A horrifying menace to the ones I love
I come to a staggering realization
I've become a lunatic of pot's creation

So high, I sharpen my knives
Can you see the look in my eye?
Driven mad by the bong hits I've had
Scapegoat? Just born bad.

Schizophrenic psycho
I have lost my mind
I did this to myself
Smoked until retarded, the world I blame
Swelling brain reprogrammed
No choice but to kill
Horrid transformation
Never be the same
Slaying, murder, slaughter
