Poured out from the tube of resinated comes
A blackness, a vision, annihilation
Utilize augury in these last uncertain days
Apperceiving intoxicant, inhaling is the only way

Deep gaping hole in my mind has expanded
Mind is blank, no more thoughts, stupefacient
Spellworthy vestige terrifying shapeless void
Dope encircled passageway

Gateways to Inhalation

Fierce psychic trauma wringing out cerebral sponge
The neurotransmitters are getting stronger
Penetrative power-premonition sees through me
Sees through me

All-consuming swelling pains threaten what exists
Total mental meltdown mount to resist

Titillated, brain activated
Somehow knowing, drugs are flowing

Reawakened enlightenment, reason I have found
Panoplanar vegetable, boundless voids surrounds

Extrasensory expansion hits
Barely grasping
At the end of your wits

Evil visions taunting you, they beckon, "come inside"
Portal summoned forth now from a bloodshot third eye

Stoned again, lost within, what a ride
Lost somewhere in time

Gateways to Inhalation
