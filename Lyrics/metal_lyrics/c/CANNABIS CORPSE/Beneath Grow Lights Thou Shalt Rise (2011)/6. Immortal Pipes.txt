Thought not to exist
Put them to your lips
And I can share my gift
Here, Immortal pipes
Hit them if you like
But I name my own price

Immortal Pipes
Getting stoned tonight
Immortal Pipes
Promise you eternal life

Please now just a taste
And if you will make haste
Others I must tempt
These ensorcelled pipes
Smouke up if you like
Your fortune and my share

Immortal Pipes
Symbol of narcotic might
Immortal Pipes
Promise you eternal life

Wicked temptation towards inhalation
Thirst for immortality, spiritually impiety
The bowl has been passed, you cannot turn back
Chained to me beneath my feet, now on the soul I shall feed

Possessed frame of man I am now
Emptiness is all I hold now

Deadened reddened eyes
All-time highest high
My bitch to command
Ancient sordid pipes
Visit you some night
If you try you will fry

Immortal Pipes
Symbol of narcotic might
Immortal Pipes
IMMORTAL PIPES
