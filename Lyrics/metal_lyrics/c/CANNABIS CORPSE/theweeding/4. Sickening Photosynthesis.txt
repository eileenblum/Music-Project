Death at the hands of the cursed marijuana plants,
This rotten Earth on which we toil,
Doomed pot rips forth out from our soil

The green worms were the first to come,
Raised up from deep forbidden dung
The heralds of the Bud, to decompose the dead
Lights out - the clouds arrive, shadows overwhelming all in sight
Endtimes, final weeding starts
Release of spores to pump through hearts of the human damned.
Marijuana has a planet to kill in its sights for sinister overgrowth.
Sickening photosynthesis,

Sickening photosynthesis
Beweeden Earth,
Death at the hands of the vile marijuana plants,
The coming of bud and the ending of life
At the hands of the evil weeds grown in the night.

Botanics, so satanic and merciless
Covering the Earth in jungles of carnivorous growth.
A floral killing spree of mass strangulations,
Even in your death, brutal buds tormenting you.
Governmental panic and religious hysteria,
Overwhelming weed assault.
Sickening photosynthesis

Beweeden Mother Nature, overdose,
Hash to ashes, dust to keep, eradication soon complete,
Dark weeds wage their war feeding off the gore
Survivors hiding in the light,
Fuelled by the moon, it owns the night
Conquerors beyond belief, billions fail beneath the leaf
Victims left to rot then possessed by the pot
World is mutilated
Behold those barren budlands...
