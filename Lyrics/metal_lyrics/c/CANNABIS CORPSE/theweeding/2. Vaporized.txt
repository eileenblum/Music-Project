"SSSSmoke the human race!"
Born to burn, pathetic humans live to die,
Buds strike back, these invaders are not so kind.
Sign of the Bud, reduce the humans into blood.
Greens obscene, they arrive to vaporize.
Toked by smoke, defenseless you are vaporized.

Earth attacked, smoking your flesh, to them it's like crack.
Born to burn, pathetic humans live to die,
Buds strike back, these invaders are not so kind.
Drugs of terror, ushering in this tumultuous era,
Greens obscene, they arrive to vaporize,
Toked by smoke, defenseless you are vaporized.
No hope is left, billions smoked dead.

The stoney legion marches on, usurping earthly crowns,
Peace shall not be found again.
Frantic chaos in the streets, battalions of armoured buds,
Disgusting leafy slugs hunting.
For a tasty earthling buzz, cooked by massive bongs,
Captured people led in throngs to burn.
Your new masters' chronic pain, inhaling mankind's lives,
The human race is vaporized.

The human race is vaporized!

Budmonsters build a world of slobbery,
Drunk with power and stoned with hate,
Off humanity these weeds get baked.

Born to burn, pathetic humans live to die,
Buds strike back, tasty bodies built to grind,
Sign of the Bud, reduced into smears of blood,
Greens obscene, they arrive to vaporize.
Toked by smoke, defenseless you are vaporized.
Earth attacked, smoking your flesh, to them it's like crack.
Born to burn, pathetic humans live to die.
Buds strike back, these invaders are not so kind
Drugs of terror, ushering in this tumultuous era,
VAPORIZED!
