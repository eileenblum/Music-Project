Torrents of blood cover the eyes of the lost in a discordian blanket
To bury the illusions of those not silenced from slit throats

Strip nude for your killer
The best place to hide is in plain sight
No guilt for the consumed

The power of mercy is now extinct
Black-gloved hands knives to throats
These are the new messiahs

Strip nude for your killer
The best place to hide is in plain sight
No guilt for the consumed

Putrid breath of life how I hate you
You burn all you touch with gifts dual
Of misery and awakening

A rotting sentence that walks and kneels
All that prays kneels and dies

Arms outstretched on bended knee
All that walks kneels prays and dies

Tongues of ice tongues of fire
All shall burn in the funeral pyre

Arms outstretched pray and die

We exhalt

Annihilation we are your guides let us be your eyes
Let us hold hands united in the great uncoming
Of that which is perfect
We bow great bringer of night
