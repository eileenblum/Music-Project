Path ingrained fall face first into nothingness
All roads lead me to self-destruct
Veins are maps paving way to the abyss
Up is down and from this there is no escape

Drown down and out

Gates without keys eyes without holes
Life without answers a corpse with no soul

Born under the worst sign Revelations of an innocence lost
From the cubicle to the casket life is a mere lottery of loss
This code of damnation ineffable to in it's beauty 
My race to the grave is my birth given duty
My race to the grave is my birthright

My inborn malignance manifests failure complete
I know I'll never leave this shitball alive

My insurrection versus resurrection let's me know
This name dies with me
This depravity this futility
It's synonymous with family
Fuck you forever and fuck me

I deny both idols and hope
I reject this holy hoax
At the end of my noose
Fuck the son long live the beast

There's an itch in my throat only a gun can scratch
