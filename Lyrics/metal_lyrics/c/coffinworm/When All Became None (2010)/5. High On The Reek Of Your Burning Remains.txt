Baptised in scars crowned in agony
Conceived with the futile notion of the self
could ever ascend

A swine existence for this plague of mortals most foul
Rip the skies asunder to draw them down
End this curse of flesh and blood
Shower mortals with the remains of their kin

There is nothing left worth saving
And even less worth dying for
The ultimate blessing is silent sleep
Forever as it was once foretold

Rip the skies asunder and draw them down
End this curse of flesh and blood

Dog eats dog eats man eats self
The packing order of the leprous
Fundaments of failure embodied in man
Begotten signs of faith drop lifeless
Under the velvet of no promised tomorrow

A swine existence for his plague of mortals most foul
Rip the skies asunder draw them down
End this curse of flesh and blood

O great lord shower us with shit and piss
O great lord give meaning to this outrage
O great lord bear the vestige of the atom
O great lord in glory Annihilus

O great lord let me consume your suffering
O great lord let me waft the fumes of your corpse
O great lord I inhale your pestilence
O great lord shower us with your death
O great lord
