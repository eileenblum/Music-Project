We are all but blood on Satan's claws

Rain down plague to wash down famine
Bathe us in the waters of death
Shower us with fire eternal
The cleansing when all became none

Congregate flagellate
We the downtroden beg you
Correct this most grave of mistakes creation

We who exhalt in the end worship it
We beg for baptism in blood in sinew
Snuff us out

Burden us not with the disease of tomorrow
Wrap us instead with black wings of sorrow
No prayers sent up to an empty sky
Sink for fangs deeper into our necks

We who exhalt in the end worship it
Baptise us all with blood
Baptise us with humanity's eulogy
The end when all became none

If the streets are sewers the churches are abbatoirs

In case of rapture the car might be unmanned
But the gun tower won't be

Send us back to the vapor of the ether

Rain down plague
When all became none
