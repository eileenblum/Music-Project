Choronzon's dawn we embrace you
Offer forth the benevolent
Tentacle of futility

Whispers of obliteration echoing nigh

Bring down the summer of finality
We huff your rot now come forth
And carry us home

Bear benevolent gifts of decimation
Our congregation of the end
Welcomes you
Forever and never of ways
And impossible

Great breaker of worlds
To thee great king
Let us be your vessels
For the great uncoming
Always and impossible

Great destroyer of life
We huff your rot
The tragedy of the excommunicated
Forever and ever always impossible
Soliloquies written in blood
As we were all born so shall
we die alone
