Enraptured by the glow of armageddon of which you already know
The black void twists and turns and calls me home
A vendetta for revenge and bloodlust to die
To watch it all come to an end preaching sermons of sleaze

My advice? Start saving for your funeral
It's the only true bet
The only handout ever is the reaper's hand
Outstretched in death

Who would call this shitball home?
Who wouldn't be best served
By feasting at the funeral knell?
Who hungers not for decay?

My advice? Start saving for your funeral
It's the only true bet
The only handout ever is the reaper's hand
Outstretched in death

The preaching of psalms denied
Extinguish the light it shines no more
Of servitude and supplication

Bring on nuclear winter

Feast

Drown in silence and servitude
Requiems for the lifeless
Damnation and downfall
The two gifts of life

Feast

Extinguish the light it shines no more
Who hungers not for decay?  Bring on nuclear winter
Bring an end to this curse
