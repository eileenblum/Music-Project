The seeds of malice indeed bear bitter fruit
We are all too familiar with the taste
Lying lifeless, dying nameless, disintegrated

The genesis of irrefutable magick

The dawn of imminent defeat
And the gnosis of their disparity

I witnessed that graceful tumble:
The only thing harder than watching
Was looking away, united only in the end
End and good times synonymous
In the mind of the unwound

The kiss of nothingness cries itself to sleep at night
While we live out this emptiness
Beholden to the concept of potential bliss
This disease plagues us all, as we embrace... downfall

[-Jacob's verse, his words-]

Empty words, faint echoes of nothingness
Patience drained into darkness I possess
Life of despair, leaving nothing for you
Death in the air, stench of reality breathing
Through smashed face, eternally crushed
Beneath the flood, I wait and rot for all to see
Taste of blood within a noose that's conquering
Chained throat, ripping my skin with broken glass
Black as pitch
