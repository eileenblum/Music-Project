The euphoria of vomit coats my teeth
And again I dream of chewing
Away the umbilicus
To a universe I've never felt an attachment to

Thoughts drift to a world
Steeped in carcass char and napalm tar

Miasmal reek of a world worth living in

Time immemorial my only ally
In a world draped in deceit

When that time arrives
It will commemorate this world
Being facefucked

And left to rot in the ashes
Of the fetus hope left on the table
The afterbirth left behind from this postmenstrual abortion

"I am not lost. I know exactly where I am, I am in some shitty fucking Hell which is exactly what I deserve. But YOU, YOU are lost. All my life I thought I needed you, that I couldn't survive without you... fuck, FUCK. It was the other fucking way around. It was the other way around."

It's what makes me lose sleep at night
Not the morally incongruent concepts

Of wrong and right
For they both lie at odds
And that disparity is a chasm

As it came together it shall also fall apart

Burned temples of diseased fleshly dominion
Irradiated with the flames of desire

Shooting syringes made of filed-down bones
Injecting the filth left from our subconscious minds
Stemming from our previous lives

All that encompasses you is all that distresses me
