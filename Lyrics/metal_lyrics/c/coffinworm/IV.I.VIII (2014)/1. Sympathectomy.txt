The cosmic paradox that binds us all
Converging only in beginning and end
The noose's shadow steady hangs over our heads

Watching life unfold in reverse
It's like dying in the womb: an unexpected gift
As the four walls of a glass casket grant
Our collective existence a tomb with a view

Dragon-slaying is its own reward
In this bingo parlor for the dying
the tree of life sways to the opposite
And circle reunites with circle

Working hard at being unacceptable
So throw the bodies on top of the pyre
But please be mindful and recycle their beliefs
Because 3 out of 4 horsemen aren't jobless

Envision your worst nightmare...
We call it a day in the life
You despise what you once held so tight
So near, unclear, unfeared...
Please turn up buried or missing

Plague
Pestilence
Death
Exhaled in every breath

Lumber forth

Plague
Pestilence
Death
Downfall manifest
Lumber forth night
Lumber forth... eternal night

Your deception fetish is not only appalling,
It reeks like a limbless prostitute's breath
As list of disorders as follows in this exact order:
Enlightenment, salavation, forever, hope, faith, death

Mourn
Scorn
Worship

Abort
Deny
Refuse
Negate

Genuflect

As we pay our final disrespects
Gathered in the church of the atom
Let us exalt in finality
At oblivion's altar

Mushroom clouds

Snort these putrid fumes
