Jaws of Satan open wide

The maw of chaos swallows us alive
Forced to breathe yet we beg to die
Derelicts and deviance no surprise
Mary's slit with no immaculate incision

Peel away the flesh of this rotten carcass on display
Of scofflawery and decay

Fly away, run away
Broken wings and broken haloes
Broken lives and broken dreams

Turn away, run from the light
Because neither of us know how this tale ends

The endtimes that you forecast
Are now being aired live

A three plate discourse on disaster,
Now serving six

Let's see what tomorrow reaps

Operator dead, post abandoned
Left alone stranded,
Left for dead

I'd kill you, if I could eat you, but since not
Fuck you

I can't manage nor contain myself, and I no longer try
Spewing rancid ejaculate on humanity's face
And aiming for its eyes

I'll live my life to ensure I'm front row
At the funeral of everything that matters

Run away, look away, flee the scene
Perhaps we should dig another grave?

What you cherish I destroy
