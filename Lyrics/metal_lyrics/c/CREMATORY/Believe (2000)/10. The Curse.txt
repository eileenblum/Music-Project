The curse beyond expression
Disgrace over your head
Fear of meeting your downfall
Peace alone from human hand

The Magic - Flee from life
The Shadows - Time to say goodbye
The Sorrow - Revelation of the youth
The Curse - Look into the face of truth

Blood of your ancestors
Satisfaction for justice
In the face of anger - In the eyes of fury
The fight for eternal existence

The Magic - Flee from life
The Shadows - Time to say goodbye
The Sorrow - Revelation of the youth
The Curse - Look into the face of truth

Revenge of the preacher
Victory the goal of choice
Life blown out like a candle
The day will get you, say farewell

The Magic - Flee from life
The Shadows - Time to say goodbye
The Sorrow - Revelation of the youth
The Curse - Look into the face of truth

The Magic - Flee from life
The Shadows - Time to say goodbye
The Sorrow - Revelation of the youth
The Curse - Look into the face of truth
