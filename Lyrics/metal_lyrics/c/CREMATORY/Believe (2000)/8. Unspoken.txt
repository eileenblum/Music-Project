Unspoken names never reach my heart again
Unspoken feelings no one miss your life

- You see - you hear - you run -

And you awaken and don`t know if you`re sleeping
Overrun and compromised by the dreams of the instant future

Unspoken names never reach my heart again
Unspoken feelings no one miss your life

- You feel - you think - you cry -

Disillusioned and deceived by the goals once pondered
Betrayed and banned by the ones once trusted

Unspoken names never reach my heart again
Unspoken feelings no one miss your life

Unspoken names never reach my heart again
Unspoken feelings no one miss your life

Pursued and struck down by the lies that feast upon you
Lost your virginity at the hands of space and time

Unspoken names never reach my heart again
Unspoken feelings no one miss your life

Unspoken names never reach my heart again
Unspoken feelings no one miss your life
