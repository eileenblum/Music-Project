Newborn from fire and ashes
Dwelled with the storm and the wind
He fought with courage and vigor
Determined to step up to - up to love

Fall away-Fall behind-Fall into-Fall back-Fall down
Fall away-Fall behind-Fall into-Fall back-Fall down

Caught in a building of cages
Life turned away from reality
He feels no inside nor outside
Soulless waiting for the end

Fall away-Fall behind-Fall into-Fall back-Fall down
Fall away-Fall behind-Fall into-Fall back-Fall down

Life thrown away and unredeemed
Covered by the fear of truth
Marred and disenchanted by many tales
Shred from juicy meat
Glorified as king and master
Tied and gagged as thief and murderer

Fall away-Fall behind-Fall into-Fall back-Fall down
Fall away-Fall behind-Fall into-Fall back-Fall down
