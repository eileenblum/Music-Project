Waited so long for this day
Eternity putting innocence to the test
No one knows the real reason - No one can stop him
His power - His power growing every day

The game is lost, eternal hate united with the eternal day
The game is lost, eternal love united with the eternal hope

Deeply within converted to lone lines
Known as an outsider, recognized as a lone wolf
Lost by the test of humanity
He wanders - He wanders across the promise land

The game is lost, eternal hate united with the eternal day
The game is lost, eternal love united with the eternal hope

The last breath - The last moment
The last game - The last move
The game is lost -The game is lost - is lost
The time is lost - The time is lost - is lost

The power of conviction created from ones self
Surrounded by silence, encircled by darkness

Armed for the right to survive
Who always - Who always wins can`t bear to lose

The game is lost, eternal hate united with the eternal day
The game is lost, eternal love united with the eternal hope
The game is lost, eternal hate united with the eternal day
The game is lost, eternal love united with the eternal hope
