The wind whispers my name
Rain drenches my skin
The chill suffocates my gasp
Darkness conceals my scars

Endless Love - Endless Fall - Endless Hate

Endless Call
Endless Love - Endless Fall - Endless Hate

Endless Call

Fear prevents lowly acts
Worriment diminishes secrets problems
In danger of falling into a trap
The game to slake yourself

Endless Love - Endless Fall - Endless Hate

Endless Call
Let me be your everything - when I'm looking to you
Let me see you when I'm king - when you are my something

Thoughts circle and fade away
The heavens soaked in bloodred
The stars so far and distant
The power to relinquish

Endless Love - Endless Fall - Endless Hate

Endless Call
Let me be your everything - when I'm looking to you
Let me see you when I'm king- when you are my something

Endless Love - Endless Fall - Endless Hate

Endless Call
Endless Love - Endless Fall - Endless Hate

Endless Call

Skin ripened by many days
Lies give away hidden feats
The torso abused by many melees
The birth of a new game

Let me be your everything - when I'm looking to you
Let me see you when I'm king - when you are my something
Endless Love - Endless Fall - Endless Hate

Endless Call
