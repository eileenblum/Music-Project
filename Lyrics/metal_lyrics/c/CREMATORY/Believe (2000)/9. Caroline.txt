Days vanish like hours - Hours creep like days
Pleasant pictures in my head
Every breath like the whiff of your love
Your every glimpse thousand needles under my skin

Day and Night - Eye to Eye - Caroline
Day and Night - Eye to Eye - Heart and
Mind -
Time to Time
Dark and Bright - Life to Life - Caroline

My heart lay at your feet
Broken, Hurt- Died so often- Hoped so much
If you were a dream I would sleep forever
Like the child in man first learning to play

Day and Night - Eye to Eye - Caroline
Day and Night - Eye to Eye - Heart and
Mind -
Time to Time
Dark and Bright - Life to Life - Caroline

So many died for this instant
So many live only for the moment
Your scent bewilders my sins
Your eyes slay my mind

My thoughts always near you
The fire of passion burns like the loneliness without you

Day and Night - Eye to Eye - Caroline
Day and Night - Eye to Eye - Heart and
Mind -
Time to Time
Dark and Bright - Life to Life - Caroline

Day and Night - Eye to Eye - Heart and
Mind -
Time to Time
Dark and Bright - Life to Life - Caroline
Day and Night - Eye to Eye - Caroline
