Time for Tears - Caught in fire
Time for Dreams - Freed from the flames

Betray your roots
Create virginal life for the future
The gate of illumination is closed
Recklessness a loss
Create the angels of your imagination

Like the ashes in the wind

Like the ashes in the wind - Like the ashes in the wind

Time For Tears - Caught In Fire
Time For Tears - Just For Salvation
Time For Tears - Caught In Fire
Time For Tears - Just For Salvation

Like the ashes in the wind - Like the ashes in the wind

Time For Tears - Caught In Fire
Time For Tears - Just For Salvation
Time For Tears - Caught In Fire
Time For Tears - Just For Salvation

The silence of the night piercing reality
Humanity never hoped for you
Enemies mistrust you
Your ashes burned on holy soil
Much time invested into the past
Like the ashes in the wind

Time For Tears - Caught In Fire
Time For Tears - Just For Salvation
Time For Tears - Caught In Fire
Time For Tears - Just For Salvation
Time For Tears - Time For Tears
