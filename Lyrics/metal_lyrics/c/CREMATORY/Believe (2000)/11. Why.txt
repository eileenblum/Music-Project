Abandoned, without a word
Trust, broken without hope
Accused, seen as a loser
Punished, the heart broken

I recall your smile - I recall your smile
Endearing, the way you caressed me -
Blazing, an endless sea of light

Demolish, every thing once built
Shattered, the escape from the unknown
Wounded, affected till eternity
Lost, what you once possessed

I recall your smile - I recall your smile
Endearing, the way you caressed me -
Blazing, an endless sea of light

Without reason -Tell me why? Without words-
Tell me why?
Without desire - Tell me why? Without sorrow-
Tell me why?

Raped, by your own time
Pensive, loneliness remains
Expecting the inner sense
Fading, your voice dies away
I recall your smile - I recall your smile
Endearing, the way you caressed me -
Blazing, an endless sea of light

Without reason-Tell me why? Without words-
Tell me why?
Without desire- Tell me why? Without sorrow-
Tell me why?

Tell me Why? Tell me Why?

Endearing, the way you caressed me -
Blazing, an endless sea of light

Without reason-Tell me why? Without words-
Tell me why?
Without desire- Tell me why? Without sorrow-
Tell me why?
