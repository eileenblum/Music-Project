Concealed in the deep of the night
Moved when the horror awakes
Frightened by the howl of the world
Saved by the powers that be
Hounded by dark shadows
Pursued by many masks
Flogged by whiplashes
Branded like stock before the war

I never die before - I hear your voice
I never die before - you have no choice
I never die - I never die

Awaken in seas of sweat
Reflections Full of bad memories
Scared to Fall asleep
Subconscious goes mad
A never ending dream
A journey that never find an aim
The end that conquers the swan song
Realization of a lost game

I never die before - I hear your voice
I never die before - you have no choice
I never die - I never die

He's the last one that I saw
He's the last of his kind
He's the last one I want to hear
He's the last one I would kill
You are the blood Flowing through my veins
You are the water which I drink
