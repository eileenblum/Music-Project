Hands folded to pray,
Holy utterance by a split tongue
The halo of blood and ashes
2000 years of praise
2000 years of lies
Exploited mans gullibility
Manifestations from one mouth
Testimony in many ears
Mankind tormented, the brains enslaved

Hear no evil - he's the holy one
See no evil - he's the holy one
Speak no evil - he's the holy one
Feel no evil - he's the holy one

He approached from the future
To show us the past
Beserted to the past to convey us the future
Born holy, died as a beggar on the cross
But you have to stride
The holy path for yourself
Hands folded to pray,
Holy utterance by a split tongue
The halo of blood and ashes
2000 years of praise 2000 years of lies

Exploited mans gullibility
Manifestations from one mouth
Testimony in many ears

Mankind tormented, the brains enslaved
Hear no evil - he's the holy one
See no evil - he's the holy one
Speak no evil - he's the holy one
Feel no evil - he's the holy one
The holy one - the evil one
