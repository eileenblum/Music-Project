Your life defined by many lies
You dwell in your own words
Distant from all that's real
Gaze into the mirror
And behold the Face of a player

A game of life - the game of life
A game with your life - the game
A game of life - the game of life
A game with your life - the game of life

In some situations once so common
And then disappointed stabbed those
That once aided you in the back
Seeking truth in a glass

A game of life - the game of life
A game with your life - the game
A game of life - the game of life
A game with your life - the game of life

Aggressive and disappointed
You roam through life
Tossing away
Your whole future for a
Small illusion in your head

A game of life - the game of life
A game with your life - the game
A game of life - the game of life
A game with your life - the game of life
