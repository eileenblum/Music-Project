You are so fixed with yourself
That you can't behold your life passing you by
Wake up brisk before your vanity breaks you
Open your eyes while you still can

When you need me
Just before the memory
Hear my voice coming through your mind
When you need me
Just before the memory
Hear my voice coming through your mind

Your friends suffocated by your ego
Your siblings haven't known you for a long time
Even death refuses to tread on your doorstep
Ensued the false passage all your life

When you need me
Just before the memory
Hear my voice coming through your mind
When you need me
Just before the memory
Hear my voice coming through your mind

No one here that misses you again
No one here to show you how to fly
Have no respect for life
Have no reverence for death
Mercy a word used by losers
Pain and sorrow gifts from heaven
Never will you love
Never will you live

When you need me
Just before the memory
Hear my voice coming through your mind
When you need me
Just before the memory
Hear my voice coming through your mind
