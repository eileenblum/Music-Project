Every bright possessor of a body floats
Dreaming away, awaiting redemption
Several often where all bright folks were honest and true
Day in, day out, day in, day out, day in, day out

Men and women in rugs, criminals and shady characters
Their faces ain't matter, didn't see them
Their eyes shine in fear of the things to come
Their spirit gone forever
Waiting for a new tale
Their destiny...

Many comes from stretch of saffron, from their mishaps 
Never (???)
Superior being
Man and animal must defy the laws of nature

Carved in stone
Carved in time
The time zone

Carved in stone
Carved in time
The time zone...
