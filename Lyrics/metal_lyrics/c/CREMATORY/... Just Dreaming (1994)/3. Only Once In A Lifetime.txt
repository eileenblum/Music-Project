Total darkness - Utter silence - no sentiment
The sound of falling sand
A gleam of light - A gust of wind - A silent shadow
A sense of flapping winds

Bloodless - Meatless - Without a body
The soul leaves the old remains
Helping hands - Sweet voices - Enticing offers
A long journey into subconscious
Familiar faces - Familiar voices - Old thoughts
Is this the life or final death ?
Old life - Old sins - Lasting temptation
A new journey through my other self

Total darkness - Silent voices - Beating heart
A new body of flesh and blood
Total darkness - Silent voices - Beating heart
A new body of flesh and blood

Childish feelings - Familiar feelings - Old memories
Becoming weak - A new life awakens
New beginning - New mistakes - New sins
Till death settles for a new life

Only once a lifetime
Only once a lifetime
Only once a lifetime
Only once a lifetime

Total darkness - Utter silence - no sentiment
The sound of falling sand
A gleam of light - A gust of wind - A silent shadow
A sense of flapping winds
