The first angel in the atmosphere
Second is a part of you
Third's the wings of death
The fourth angel takes your soul
Fifth shows you the paradise
Sixth angel brings you new life
The seventh sends you dreams
Eighth shows you the right way
The ninth angel judges over you
The last angel sends pain and agony

The power
The power
The power
The power
The power
The powers of darkness in battle with the humane
Your soul forever caught in hell
But I saw the angels fly
The good will triumph
The angel of death sent to do evil
Army of hell
The danger of the darkside
Angel of wisdom and faith protects your soul
Protects your soul

Like a marionette in the wind , a toy of the mighty
Like a marionette in the wind , a toy of the mighty

I saw the angels fly
I saw the angels fly
I saw the angels fly
I saw the angels fly

The first angel in the atmosphere
Second is a part of you
Third's the wings of death
The fourth angel takes your soul
Fifth shows you the paradise
Sixth angel brings you new life
