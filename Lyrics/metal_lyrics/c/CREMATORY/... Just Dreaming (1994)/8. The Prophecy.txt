Blood - fallen from heaven
Obscurity - spreading the day
Pestilence - To let the humans die
Death - is a customary illustration
Fire - charges burning down
Putrefaction - All over the world
Burning flesh - The smell lies in the air
Fear - Horror in the night

The animals die - The oceans are red
Snowing in summer - The fallen angel
A lifeless child was born
A lifeless child was born
The prophecy - The prophecy

Earthquake - The ground became the lacerated wound
Thunder and lightning - total destruction
Fire - The world is burning
The earth explosion
Earthquake - The ground became the lacerated wound
Thunder and lightning - total destruction
Fire - The world is burning
Fire - The world explosion
