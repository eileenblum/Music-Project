For centuries , life history has been an inexhaustible
Source of inspiration for the spiritual and cultural existence

The nectar of devotion is the fountain of all joy
It pushes the door of transcendance open with all its spiritual
Emotion and contemplation
In the course of history many god-inspired teachers
And incarnation of gods appeared on the earth

The hymns of god are the essence of wisdom that manifest
The true nature of man
His designation in the universe and his relationship to god

Life decives from life - The instruction
Life decives from life - The instruction

In the eyes of death
Beyond space and time
The beauty of one's self
The eternal indispensable law that rules
Over reincarnation and death

For centuries , life history has been an inexhaustible
Source of inspiration for the spiritual and cultural existence
