In my hands - Holding the dust of time
In my hands - Giving the night shadows
In my hands - Seeing days gone by
In my hands - You'll sleep 1000 years

My life is your life - The angwish fading
My thought are your thoughts - Sign of evil
My soul in your soul - Judgement day
My hands in your hands - I bring you life
My pain is your pain - The forgotten
The last breath is taken
The last breath is taken

In my hands - In my hands - In my hands
In my hands - In my hands - In my hands

In my hands - I see the torment and the corpses
Follow the stream of the burning fire deep in your soul
Deep in your soul

Your death is my demise - The astral body weakens
Your brain in my brain - Waiting for new life
Don't you call me Jesus Christ ?
Christ
Don't you call me Jesus Christ .

In my hands - In my hands - In my hands
In my hands - In my hands - In my hands
