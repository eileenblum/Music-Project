Dreams close the reality of truth
An endless sleep - an immortal life
Reality banned to the past
Fixation of another world
Floating on glass clouds
I can fly I feel free
Feelings of life are distant
A dream captured in the next dream
The dead-end of subconsciousness extends - extends

Into the infinity of truth
The dreams of manking
Hope - Wishes - Love or uncertainty
Fear - Hate - Like
Like a self-developed film - Like a self-developed film

But who will show you the way
Your mind playing on tricks on you
Everything over when you awaken
Or is it an awakening in another dream
Dreams of confusion - Dreams of confusion

Dreams close the reality of truth
An endless sleep - an immortal life
Reality banned to the past
Fixation of another world
Floating on glass clouds
I can fly I feel free
Feelings of life are distant
A dream captured in the next dream
The dead-end of subconsciousness extends

Into the infinity of truth
The dreams of manking
Hope - Wishes - Love or uncertainty
Fear - Hate - Like
Like a self-developed film - Like a self-developed film

But who will show you the way
Your mind playing on tricks on you
Everything over when you awaken
Or is it an awakening in another dream
Dreams of confusion - Dreams of confusion
