Cut out my tongue and cut throat
And sacrifice the blackest goat
Bring the heartache and the pain
Sing of sorrow in a sweet refrain

To curse me â so come onâ¦ â and hurt me

[Chorus:]
I pain't your name with fire on my hurting skin
My love within â I feel my love within
I feel your emptiness â in my heart and soul
My love within â I feel my love within
Inside my love â inside my life â my love

We can never shake the pain its seems
And all that left in hollow dreams
Make happiness in memories
Make light a thing I'll never see

Forget me â so come onâ¦ â and leave me

[Chorus]

I beg you to stay â on my knees I pray
I am everything â you want me to be
I won't speak â I won't cry
And if you ask me toâ¦ I will die

[Chorus]
