As I walked along the verge of a mourning lake
The fog over darkened water began to clear

Then I looked in the eyes of the ravens
I raised myself to the sky
The blaze increased to a light in the air
Running through my veins

[Chorus:]
Ravens are callingâ¦ calling my name
Blood rain is falling my hope is in vain
Tears don't mean the same
Stop playing this game
When the ravens call my name
When the ravens call my name â I'm prepared to die
When the ravens call my name

So I walked among the dying trees of a barren land
As the sun goes down on the silver mountains

Then I looked in the eyes of the ravens
I raised myself to the sky
The blaze increased to a light in the air
Running through my veins

[Chorus]

When the ravens call my name, it's like coming home
When the ravens call my name â I'm prepared to die

[Chorus]
