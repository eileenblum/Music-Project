I was looking for a reason,
And a world worth fighting for
I got hurt by love and then I came
Right back for more
Nothing but the tears I bleed
And the anger that breed

[Chorus:]
There's nothing in the world to see
Endless pain and misery
There is nothing in my heart to find
Nothing sacred, nothing kind
There's nothing in the world to see
Endless pain and misery
There is nothing in my heart to find
Nothing sacred, nothing kind

I can't find a reason,
Here is no world worth fighting for
I get hurt my life and I don't
Even care no more
Nothing that seems true and real
Nothing that I long to feel â I long to feel

[Chorus]

Nothing â nothing â nothing sacred â nothing kind

[Chorus]
