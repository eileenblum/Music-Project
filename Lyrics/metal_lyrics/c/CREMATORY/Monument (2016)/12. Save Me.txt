I don't believe it's something new
A thousand times that we've been through
In different ways, we have seen this face
Dump, cold and bare, this game is so unfair

I don't see that it's true
When the lights ain't shining through
It's so cold, so bare â it's so, so unfair

[Chorus:]
Save me from fallin' â save me from the pain
Save me from tomorrow â when you turn away
There's nothing more to say â there's nothing more to live
To live and die for

The whole world was not enough
For the visions we've painted with love
It's getting dark â I've got to go
The stars are fallin' â since you've been gone

I don't see that it's true
When the lights ain't shining through
It's so cold, so bare â it's so, so unfair

[Chorus]

Till my world has ceased to turn
I'll be eager â¦I just wanna burn
You gave me the sweet blow of death
Now I'm waiting for his last caress

[Chorus]
