Take my hand and show me
A world so full of life and love
Where storm clouds are a mystery
And only blue skies are above
Suffering and questions why
No pain in a short goodbye

[Chorus:]
The sweet smile on my lips â misunderstood
And the light in my eyes â misunderstood
All the comfort of a kiss â misunderstood
The sweet words in my mind â misunderstood â misunderstood

Take my heart and listen
A life so full of good and harmony
Where space and time â dominate
And only life is useless
No more colour in my face
Every life and love â abominate

[Chorus]

I stay behind and hope â that your life will hold
I stay behind and hope â that your life will unfold

Take your time and leave me alone
Days are gone â and your heart won't break
In this long goodbye â please don't cry
All that you will remember
When the darkness kills the shadows â kills all life

[Chorus]
