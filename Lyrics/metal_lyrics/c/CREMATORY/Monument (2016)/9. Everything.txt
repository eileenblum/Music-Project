Sometimes I cry for things
That I have lost forever
Sometimes I'm feeling all alone â all alone
Someday I lost my heaven
A wanderer without a home
Someday I'm walking by myself â all alone

And then I dry for things
That I will never get

[Chorus:]
Everything I lost â and everything I touch
And everything I love â falls apart and dies in pain
Everything I lost â and everything I touch
And everything I love â falls apart and dies in pain
Everything I lost

I need a heart to break
That I have lost forever
I need a soul to keep â to keep forever
Someday I will never return
A traveller without a view
A little piece of mine â no peace of mind

And then I cry for things
That I will never get

[Chorus]
