I see you staring in my face
Looking for some lunatic embrace
To still your hunger for the night
Whose terrors fill your heart without fright
As well as a violent yearning, waiting for another life

[Chorus:]
Before I die
I see you staring in my eyes
Searching for some fading lies
To still your thirst tonight â before I die
I see your pride fading away
A victim of your craving, waiting for another life
Before I die

[Chorus]

I am a monster from your dreams
Looking at my face it seems
I am the one who stole your sleep
To drag you to the endless deep â the endless deep

I see you staring in my face
To still your hunger for the night
I see you staring in my eyes - waiting for another life

[Chorus]
