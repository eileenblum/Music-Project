It's a neverending fight - no colors - no hope - no light
The unwinable game - no winners - no go - no life
Seduced by the pain of devastation - and the seizure of senses
Confused by shame of desecration - and the feaze of bleeding fences

This is a homage to my heroes
This is a tribute to my gods
To my gods

At the end of all days I will see you again
Infinity darkness forever
At the end of all time your heart will kiss the flames
Will kiss the flames

With the beginning of dawn arises infinity
Infinity darkness forever
At the end of all days the end of all time
Forever

It's a neverending dream - no fear - no sun
It's a neverending trip - no return - no rebirth
Imagination is just an act of desperation - to escape the fate
And trust died in the love of declaration - to fall into the waste

This is a homage to my heroes
This is a tribute to my gods
To my gods

At the end of all days I will see you again
Infinity darkness forever
At the end of all time your heart will kiss the flames
Will kiss the flames

With the beginning of dawn arises infinity
Infinity darkness forever
At the end of all days the end of all time
Forever

Don't leave the darkness by entering the light
Don't leave peace behind by beginning to fight
To fight for my gods

At the end of all days I will see you again
Infinity darkness forever
At the end of all time your heart will kiss the flames
Will kiss the flames

With the beginning of dawn arises infinity
Infinity darkness forever
At the end of time the end of all days
Forever
