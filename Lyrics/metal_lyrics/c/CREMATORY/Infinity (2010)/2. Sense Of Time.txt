For the sense of time...the time of your life

Silence is a breed of loss - shown in your words
There's no guarantee if once violence has hurt
There's no way back to silence through your silent night
Though your silent night skies and lifetime

Will the dreaming ever end, will this wishes never bend
Under the skies all heaven's black
Undisguised the pretty one's attack

The force of obligation the sense of duty for the sense of time
The sense of honor and pride, the face of beauty
The hand of devastation, the sense of duty for the sense of time
The sense of adventure, the face of beauty
For the sense of time...the time of your life

You just can see, where you long to be
No drowning, no howling at the moon
Too soon you flee the dark night skies
Freedom is getting late at night and lost by standing on the crime
For the sense of time

Will the dreaming ever end, will this wishes never bend
Under the skies all heaven's black
Undisguised the pretty one's attack

The force of obligation, the sense of duty for the sense of time
The sense of honor and pride, the face of beauty
The hand of devastation, the sense of duty for the sense of time
The sense of adventure, the face of beauty
For the sense of time...the time of your life

Will the dreaming ever end, will this wishes never bend
Under the skies all heaven's black
Undisguised the pretty one's attack

The force of obligation, the sense of duty for the sense of time
The sense of honor and pride, the face of beauty
The hand of devastation, the sense of duty for the sense of time
The sense of adventure, the face of beauty
For the sense of time... the time of your life
