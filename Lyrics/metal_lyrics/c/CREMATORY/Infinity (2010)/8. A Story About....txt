There are always two ways to go
One you might know
The other one will show
If it better were unwalked
Sunlight changes with shades
Every sunrise in a haze
I've been flying through skies
But still hiding

Screaming for vengeance
Seek for revenge
Crying for justice
Breaking the law

Is this story about your life
Or is this a story about space and time

There is always one thing you know
This one you know
If you don't move too slow
You were better off untaught
Hope is the last to know
A companion in sadness
Scars only melt with a lie
No air for breathing

Screaming for vengeance
Seek for revenge
Crying for justice
Breaking the law

Is this story about your life
Or is this a story about space and time

Screaming for vengeance
We seek for revenge
Crying for justice
We are breaking the law
This is a story about your life
This a story about - about space and time

Is this story about your life
Or is this a story about space and time
