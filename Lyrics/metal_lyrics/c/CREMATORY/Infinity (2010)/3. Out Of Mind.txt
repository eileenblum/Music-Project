Which one of them, the fallen and the frozen
Unmasks the difference, waving through the skies
Shining like the sun - or falling like the frozen one
Or in the end just waving goodbye

Out of mind

Out of mind
Out of control
The monster in my head
Fool in the back
Out of mind
Out of control
No more lies
No more tears
No more fight
No more pain

Which one of them, the frozen and the fallen
A black hole like the abyss of madness
Shining on the fallen ones, waving through the night
If time is the crime of long dead centuries

Out of mind

Out of mind
Out of control
The monster in my head
Fool in the back
Out of mind
Out of control
No more lies
No more tears
No more fight
No more pain

No more tears
No more fight
No more pain
No more fear

Out of mind

Out of mind
Out of control
The monster in my head
Fool in the back
Out of mind
Out of control
No more lies
No more tears
No more fight
No more pain
