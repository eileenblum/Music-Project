Both ends burning...inside circles turning...burnt hands are yearning
For more learning...so don't they move...away from the fire...
So you turn back from the place of desire

Smash it - to break the rules
Do it - to seize your day
Stop it - stop the mess
Kill - the insane

No one knows the pain you feel
No one knows the screams you steal
To try to stop the curse of history
No one knows the dreams you dream
No one knows the sleep you sleep
To try to stop the march of tragedy

Yes, time passes by...as life is a lifetime dare
As life is confusing...you can tell me the truth

Smash it - to break the rules
Do it - to seize your day
Stop it - stop the mess
Kill - the insane

No one knows the pain you feel
No one knows the screams you steal
To try to stop the curse of history
No one knows the dreams you dream
No one knows the sleep you sleep
To try to stop the march of tragedy

Both ends burning...inside circles turning...burnt hands are yearning
For more learning...so don't they move...away from the fire...
So you turn back from the place of desire

Yes, time passes by...as life is a lifetime dare

To break the rules
Do it - to seize your day
Stop it - stop the mess
Kill - the insane
Smash it - to break the rules
Do it - to seize your day
Stop it - stop the mess
Kill - the insane

No one knows the pain you feel
No one knows the screams you steal
To try to stop the curse of history
No one knows the dreams you dream
No one knows the sleep you sleep
To try to stop the march of tragedy
