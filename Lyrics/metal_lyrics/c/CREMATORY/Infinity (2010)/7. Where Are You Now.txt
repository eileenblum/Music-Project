If death were just a dream
In the end you sing your final scream
So sleep can't be - anything but reality
And so you sing and see
For it sounds so violently

Where are you now
When the face is falling to the ground
This is the first, the beginning
This is my love, which I am singing

You are inside of me
Any fool could see
If darkness fakes the light
It would have come true
If you had not changed the truth
So you burn in fire

Where are you now...

Where are you now - When you stole a heart to break
Where are you now - When you feel someone's watching you
Where are you now - When you are all alone
Where are you now - When the sun comes down...Comes down

Afraid of the light
The dark shines way too bright
A shiver of cold light
The sand turns red
The eyes turn blind
The lights fade out of time
Pounding heart, moving blood

Where are you now...

Where are you now - When you stole a heart to break
Where are you now - When you feel someone's watching you
Where are you now - When you are all alone
Where are you now - When the sun comes down...Comes down

The death of silence
Deriving from you
Loud sounding sirens
Getting me down, getting me down, altering the truth

Where are you now - When you stole a heart to break
Where are you now - When you feel someone's watching you
Where are you now - When you are all alone
Where are you now - When the sun comes down...Comes down

Where are you now
