For years for this felling of intimacy
This pleasant well-known shower
Of endearment
My love for you burns like a fire
In my deepest self

Your life is the absolute
Perfection on earth
People would kill for these
Feelings and emotions
My thoughts circle around your life,
Around our life till eternity

You are the enrichment of my life
You are the vitality of my life
My heart enflames at the sight of you

I would die if i couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
I hear you smile
Your voice in my dreams
When i wake day and night

I would die if i couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
I hear you smile
Your voice in my dreams
When i wake day and night

But i would never like to miss
The feeling
Once i gave you my heart
And you treat it like your own
Flesh and blood
Emotions say more then
Thousand words

With you to the end of the world
To the end of our life
Neither death nor satan are
Capable of seperating us

You are the enrichment of my life
You are the vitality of my life
My heart enflames at the sight of you

I would die if i couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
I hear you smile
Your voice in my dreams
When i wake day and night

I would die if i couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
I hear you smile
Your voice in my dreams
When i wake day and night

For love
For love

You are the enrichment of my life
You are the vitality of my life
My heart enflames at the sight of you

I would die if i couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
I hear you smile
Your voice in my dreams
When i wake day and night

I would die if i couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
I hear you smile
Your voice in my dreams
When i wake day and night

Your eyes are like a drug
For love
For love
