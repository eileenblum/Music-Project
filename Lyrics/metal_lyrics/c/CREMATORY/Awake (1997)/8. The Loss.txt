Day for day, year for year
I'm waiting to sence you once again
Where were you
When i longed for you
Where were you
When my inner being died
Where were you
where

I see smoke, patches of fog
Darkness clothes me well
Where were you all the years
Where were your signs
The search for you is the loss of
you

Where were you
When i longed for you
Where were you
When my inner being died
Where were you
When i longed for you
Where were you
When my inner being died

I am smoke and patch of fog
Darkness does not see me
I was your own sign
That i was searching for all the
years
That i was searching for all the
years

Where were you
When i longed for you
Where were you
When my inner being died
Where were you
When i longed for you
Where were you
When my inner being died

The search for you is the loss of
you
The search for you is the loss of
you
The search for you is the loss of
you
The search for you is the loss of
you
