Don't tell me how strong you are
When emotions for you,
Is a feeling,
You can describe in two words
Don't look at me with closed eyes
As closed like a black hole
The black hole in you
Is the black hole in me
Don't tell me how strong you are
When emotions for you,
Is a feeling,
You can describe in two words
Don't look at me with closed eyes
As closed like a black hole
The black hole in you
Is the black hole in me

Look in the mirror,
And feel what you see
Don't close your eyes
And you wanna be free
Inside yourself
There's a way we can hide
In an inhibited society
You always collide

Don't tell me how strong you are
As strong like a child,
A child with no dreams
Don't dream a dream
When you hope to wake up in time
In time you will learn
Don't tell me how strong you are
As strong like a child,
A child with no dreams
Don't dream a dream
When you hope to wake up in time
In time you will learn

Look in the mirror,
And feel what you see
Don't close your eyes
And you wanna be free
Inside yourself
There's a way we can hide
In an inhibited society
You always collide
Look in the mirror,
And feel what you see
Don't close your eyes
And you wanna be free
Inside yourself
There's a way we can hide
In an inhibited society
You always collide
