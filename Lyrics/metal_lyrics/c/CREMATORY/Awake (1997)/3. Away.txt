Voices out of the darkness
Shadowy bodies from eternity
A soft breeze betrays the presence
Milleniums imprisoned
A life of suffering
United in a dead soul
United in a dead soul

Voices out of the darkness
Shadowy bodies from eternity
A soft breeze betrays the presence
Milleniums imprisoned
A life of suffering
United in a dead soul

Away
The darkness breaks the silence
Away
The silence breaks the light
The tyranny of new age has begun
The time of the earth

Away
The darkness breaks the silence
Away
The silence breaks the light
The tyranny of new age has begun
The time of the earth

Away
The darkness breaks the silence
Away
The silence breaks the light
The tyranny of new age has begun
The time of the earth

Away
The darkness breaks the silence
Away
The silence breaks the light
The tyranny of new age has begun
The time of the earth

Voices out of the darkness
Eternity seeps away
Like a sense of time
The time of the earth
Relieves emotion
The tyranny of modern times
has arrived
trying to inform us
trying to inform us

Voices out of the darkness
Eternity seeps away
Like a sense of time
The time of the earth
Relieves emotion
The tyranny of modern times
has arrived
trying to inform us

Away
The darkness breaks the silence
Away
The silence breaks the light
The tyranny of new age has begun
The time of the earth

Away
The darkness breaks the silence
Away
The silence breaks the light
The tyranny of new age has begun
The time of the earth

Away
The darkness breaks the silence
Away
The silence breaks the light
The tyranny of new age has begun
The time of the earth
