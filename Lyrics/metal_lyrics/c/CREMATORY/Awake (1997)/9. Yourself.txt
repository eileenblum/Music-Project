Softly touched by lascivious breath
The strange feeling like in a dream
The face gleaming in full glory
Touches of provoking beauty

Step back
Deprive yourself of the spell
Seduction is death
Is death
Step back
Deprive yourself of the spell
Hallucinations mean death
Mean death

Unleash yourself,
Destroy the evil spell
The face desintegrates to dust
Beaty turns gloomy
Like tarnished pewter
Gone the red lips
And the greed for blood

Step back
Deprive yourself of the spell
Seduction is death
Is death
Step back
Deprive yourself of the spell
Hallucinations mean death
Mean death

Flawless beaty flatters you
Obscene words and red lips
Feminine curves scent human flesh
The greed for blood
A batlle of life and death
Flawless beaty flatters you
Obscene words and red lips
Feminine curves scent human flesh
The greed for blood
A batlle of life and death

Step back
Deprive yourself of the spell
Seduction is death
Is death
Step back
Deprive yourself of the spell
Hallucinations mean death
Mean death
