Use the lies you tell
To destroy others
You feel like a king
In his deceptive kingdom
Pull the people who don't
Suit you through the mud
Slander them with nasty words

Your lines are your weapons
Terse with evil words
Because with your lies
You are only betraying yourself

Lord of lies
Don't care about the truth
Lord of lies
Just want your way
Lord of lies
Don't care who you harm
Lord of lies
It's just about your way

Determine in your brain
What is truth and what is a lie
Put your thoughts on paper
To impose them on to others
You decide what other think
Steer their every move

Quit deciding for others
Stop thinking for them
Because with your lies
You are only betraying yourself

Lord of lies
Don't care about the truth
Lord of lies
Just want your way
Lord of lies
Don't care who you harm
Lord of lies
It's just about your way

Don't care about the truth
Just want your way
Don't care who you harm
It's just about your way

Lord of lies
Don't care about the truth
Lord of lies
Just want your way
Lord of lies
Don't care who you harm
Lord of lies
It's just about your way
