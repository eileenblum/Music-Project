Do you hear my voice - it is my way
Do you feal my coldness - it is my way
If you call my name - it is my way

Follow me on my way
Into our eternity
Of emotions and thoughts

Close your eyes - for my way
Open your soul - for my way
Give me your thoughts - for my way

Trust lies - mistrust truth - hear silence -
See the night

Follow me tracks of history
Into the light of space and time
Obey my way and be silent

Listen to my voice - it is my way
Feel my coldness - it is my way
Call my name - it is my way

Hearing, feeling and seeing - that is my way -
I am your way
