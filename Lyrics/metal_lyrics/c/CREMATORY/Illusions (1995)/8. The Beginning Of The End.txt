Emotions - reflecting the dreams of reality
Deep wounds - deep scars - tribute to days gone past
The heart within, damned to beat
The eyes, windows for the souls
Fate of the flesh - vulnerable and weak
Deaths' consent the end of the beginning

Dreams reflecting the emotions of lies - the beginning of the
end
Bloodless thoughts of lifeless memories - the beginning of the
end
Shadowy silhouettes of fear - the beginning of the end
Twine the feelings of newborn time - the beginning of the end

Bizarre lights weaving through
Grimassing screams, shattering the peace of death
Fates - destinys
The modern queen feasting upon the dreams of paradise

Dreams reflecting the emotions of lies - the beginning of the
end
Bloodless thoughts of lifeless memories - the beginning of the
end
Shadowy silhouettes of fear - the beginning of the end
Twine the feelings of newborn time - the beginning of the end

The snake as expression of power
Poison spread to hate
The beginning of the end
Lies, reflecting the emotions of reality in dreams

Dreams reflecting the emotions of lies - the beginning of the
end
Bloodless thoughts of lifeless memories - the beginning of the
end
Shadowy silhouettes of fear - the beginning of the end
Twine the feelings of newborn time - the beginning of the end
