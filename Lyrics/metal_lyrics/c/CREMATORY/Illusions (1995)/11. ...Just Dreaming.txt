I hear your voice from beyond
It cuts deep through my skin

My life without aim - my life without sense
My life without aim - my life without sense

The thoughts - the memories flow away with time
Last moments - last visions distort the true meaning
You live in fear - live on illusions
The question of guilt lies in your hands

Last chances taken
The wheels of time turn back
Great times - good things join with the fate of your fortune

Where are you now - where are you?
Where are you now - where are you?

I can feel you, but I can't see you
Your voice screams like the rain from the sky
My skin burns hotter than fire
I call your name - heaven fell silent
My heart is leaden with your thoughts

The thoughts - the memories flow away with time
Last moments - last visions distort the true meaning
You live in fear - live on illusions
The question of guilt lies in your hands

You live on under my sign
You live on in the thoughts of my time
Rest in peace - redemption is far away
You live on under my sign
You live on in the thoughts of my time
Rest in peace - redemption is far away
