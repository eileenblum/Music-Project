I see you in my dreams -
You are so far from me
I know you from my dreams -
you are so strange to me
Our hearts touched thousand times -
You always stay in your world
Could I only follow you like the light -
Deepness of my heart

Yet my time hasn't come

Shadowy voices that I hear -
Irritate me in moments of loneliness
The sweet smell of breath -
Penetrates my thoughts
I hear your call - in my dreams -
Once again and forever

Your figure disappears -
Your cries die away -
You are caught in my dreams -
Dreams of dancing - dreams of dancing

I see you in my dreams -
You are so far from me
I know you from my dreams -
you are so strange to me
Our hearts touched thousand times -
You always stay in your world
Could I only follow you like the light -
Deepness of my heart

Yet my time hasn't come

Shadowy voices that I hear -
Irritate me in moments of loneliness
The sweet smell of breath -
Penetrates my thoughts
I hear your call - in my dreams -
Once again and forever

Your figure disappears -
Your cries die away -
You are caught in my dreams -
Dreams of dancing - dreams of dancing
