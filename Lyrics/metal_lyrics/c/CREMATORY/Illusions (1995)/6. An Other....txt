Mistakes, done over and over again
Voices, heard over and over again
Escape from one's self
Escape into salvation

One word - one gesture and everything is over
Long silence - empty thoughts
Escape into another phase
Escape from reality

An other life - an other death - an other destination - an
other self
An other life - an other death - an other destination - an
other self
An other life - an other death - an other destination - an
other self
An other life - an other death - an other destination - an
other self

The leprous sign branded onto the forehead
Like stricken by disease
Guilt sought by one's self
The guilt of salvation

The night passes - silence remains
Unsolved questions remain as a wall
The guilt of the other phase
The guilt out of fear of reality

An other life - an other death - an other destination - an
other self
An other life - an other death - an other destination - an
other self
An other life - an other death - an other destination - an
other self
An other life - an other death - an other destination - an
other self
