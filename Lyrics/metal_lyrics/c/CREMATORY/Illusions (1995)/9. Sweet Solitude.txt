Silence - darkness - a cold gust of wind
Damp fog - flowers and grass wither

Apathy - indifference
Depressions sacrificed by deeper pain

Sick of soliguy
Solitude before death promises - yes
Seems only to be a small step

The fear of sleep
The fear of awakening
before the next morning

Crazed thoughts left themselves
Is life an illusion?
The power of life drawn
From all the hope and dreams
Of the solitary

The story of life forever pressed on paper

The story of life forever pressed on paper
The thoughts of death forever repressed
The flames of my soul rideted with many questions?

Crazed thoughts left themselves
Is life an illusion?
The power of life drawn
From all the hope and dreams
Of the solitary

Silence - darkness - a cold gust of wind
Damp fog - flowers and grass wither

Apathy - indifference
Depressions sacrificed by deeper pain
