The morning face to face
Deceiced by beautyful pictures
Killed by crazed thoughts
In gods eye the crime on humanity
Sheer hate before love
The disappointment of gods countenance
The self-mutilation
The destruction of myself
Fear disappears into sweat desire
The dreams of remembrance
The fear of reality
Confused creatures created by bizarre pictures

Faces of immortality
Faces of the unknown
Faces of death
