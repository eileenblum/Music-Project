A thousand times you peer into their hearts
a thousand times you abduct their hope
a thousand times you perceive the dark voices
a thousand times you annihilate life

Angel of fate wings of demise
protector of the night
keeper of the wind
angel of fate wings of demise
protector of the night
keeper of the wind

A thousand times you scorch the heaven
a thousand times you banish countless souls
a thousand times you trust in the evil
a thousand times you abuse eternity

A thousand times you fly with the flames
a thousand times you die to win
a thousand times you glide through the night
a thousand times you deceive mankind

Angel of fate wings of demise
protector of the night
keeper of the wind
Angel of fate wings of demise
protector of the night
keeper of the wind
