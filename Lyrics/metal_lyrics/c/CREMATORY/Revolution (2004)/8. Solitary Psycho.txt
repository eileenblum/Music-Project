I lived in a nightmare just good and said no
gone with a feeling the made us so cold
while getting the madness it's crawling in us
solitary psycho a sickening badness

Solitary psycho
no way out fearing yourself
forever your're banned
Solitary psycho
counting the days healing myself
forever your're damned

Loose one's mind and wreck one's brain
lifethoughts are foreign to our nature
slow inner decay no reason left
solitary psycho a sickening badness

Has it been the right way and even allowed
knowing it keeps on progressing
all those reflections thinking about
dogma never miscarries
