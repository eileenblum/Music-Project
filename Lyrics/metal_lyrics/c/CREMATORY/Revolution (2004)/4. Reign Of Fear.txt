Ladies and gentleman here is a story about time about fear

A long time ago the world was not ready
he only arrived at night the horror was inside it
full of creed full obsessed he prayed upon the sleeping
out of sight out of mind the nightmare awakens

This the reign of fear
caught somewhere in a lost world
this is the reign of fear
raped somehow in a dying world
this is the reign of fear
prayed for nothing but my paradise pain
but now you have resigned

Many years ago the time was not steady
an introduction of might the fear was infected
full of hate full of pain a mass without remorse
out of time out of life the nightmare continues
