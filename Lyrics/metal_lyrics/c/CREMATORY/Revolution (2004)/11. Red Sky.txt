Awakend by death no escape
marked by pain no compassion
born from the ashes turned into dust
executed by the evil
forever despoiled eaten by fire - no mercy

Red sky - red blood - red eyes
the longing hand of faith
red sky - dead land - black rain
without your gods blessing
Red sky - red blood - red eyes
the longing hand of faith
red sky - dead land - black rain

Shattered by life no change
haunted by bad luck no escape
ripped out of the soul in the name of god
tormented by heaven extracted from blood
eaten by fire - no refuse

Shattered by life awakened by death 
no change, no escape haunted by bad luck
marked by pain - no escape - no compassion
