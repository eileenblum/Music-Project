With love and hate so many lies and so much pain
a lonesome cry death has won the game
I want to see your eyes watching me
I want to feel your hands touching me
let me be your slave the last second of your life

Open your soul - open your heart
open your mind - open your eyes

Forget what you have seen and swallow my judgement
the greatest believers some painfull deceivers
gossip had crossed my way now swallow the answers
nothing to damn my cunning forget what you have seen

With pain and fear so many times so many crimes
a lonesome way life has lost the game
I want to hold your heart hurting me
I want to know your thoughts speak to me
let me be your tool last moments of your time
