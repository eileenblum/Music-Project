Life wiped out love shattered
a human delusion that never rests
lost all faith fall into hate
mankind was in blind rage

Human blood - human blood
unlearn to forgive them - undo me here
disclaim all I gave you - disdain me now

Unleash the vigor of belief
the eminent power of human being
carnage and burn in their destiny
determined handling in fatal distress

Unlearned to forgive you
disclaimed all I gave you
human blood trust in mankind
human blood trust in mankind
