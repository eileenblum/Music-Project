They'll never stop our will to live
free from pain and fear
they cannot bring us down
all your gird
go out and justify the revolution

The beginning of the age - to start revolution
now break and leave their cage - time for revolution
take those traitors away from us - and start revolution
giving back belief and trust - so live the revolution

This reign of fear built of not ending empty promises
strange liars old betrayers because they've failed the aim
there is just one world we live in - justify the revolution

Teaching mankind to fight each other (never again)
but would you like to kill your brother?
never - never again

The beginning of the age - to start revolution
now break and leave their cage - time for revolution
take those traitors away from us - and start revolution
giving back belief and trust - so live the revolution

It's time for - so start a - and live the - revolution
it's time for - so start a - and live the - revolution
