I remember the beauty, I remember the youth
I remember illusions, I remember the truth

I remember the mirror, deep inside I feel the pain
I remember the reason, suffering unto the change
I remember the mirror, deep inside I feel the pain

I remember the beast, I remember the wild
I remember visions and hating the lie

I remember the mirror, deep inside I feel the pain
I remember the reason, suffering unto the change
I remember the mirror, deep inside I feel the pain

spring follows winter, the blooming will start
spring follows winter, the blooming will start

I remember the beast, I remember the wild
I remember visions and hating the lie

I remember the reason, suffering unto the change
I remember the mirror, deep inside I feel the pain
