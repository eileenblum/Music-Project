Seek evil, you will find, speak evil, itâs on your mind
Build a bridge to anywhere to have a home to turn
To a brook flows from anywhere and you will find the evil
That you suffer unto having on your mind

Walk this way and you will find
Those burning bridges inside your mind
So you look back into nowhere
To see all these bridges are meant to stay

Aggression in large amounts, thatâs everything that counts
No hand waiting that must be paid, leave your encores all unplayed
Knocked down and out, you cry it out loud
Locked inside your self-made prison

Walk this way and you will find
Those burning bridges inside your mind
So you look back into nowhere
To see all these bridges are meant to stay

then one fine youâre led astray, a witch flew on her broom
in sparkling skies she flew away and took with her your doom
then one fine youâre led astray, a witch flew on her broom
in sparkling skies she flew away and took with her your doom

Seek evil, you will find, speak evil, itâs on your mind
Build a bridge to anywhere to have a home to turn
To a brook flows from anywhere and you will find the evil
That you suffer unto having on your mind

Walk this way and you will find
Those burning bridges inside your mind
So you look back into nowhere
