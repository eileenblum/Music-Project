Seven days, the sacral lie, the last dayâs been sacrificed
On judgement day heaven comes done to reveal the lie
The curse is not a lie, this knowledge is truth
The one we adore will never return, what we are, born to lose

When darkness falls, forever we all will know
There will be no sanity, no healing, no eternity
Dragons fly to the burning sky
When darkness falls, the end will call

Mankind weeps and laments on its descent to hell
When the last crack tears us to pieces
Cowards try to cast a sheltering spell
But the deafened raceâs words remain unspoken

When darkness falls, forever we all will know
There will be no sanity, no healing, no eternity
Dragons fly to the burning sky
When darkness falls, the end will call

Born to hear the angels sing, born to bear and stand the sin
Born to live in vain, born to die in pain, born to die in pain

Seven is the number of wishes, burning in the embers
Seven days to hide, the last, it didnât fade
On judgement day heaven comes down to reveal the lie
Run to the hills, run and hide, you will reveal the lie

When darkness falls, forever we all will know
There will be no sanity, no healing, no eternity
Dragons fly to the burning sky
When darkness falls, the end will call
When darkness falls, the end will call
When darkness falls
