Sinking through layers of unknown prayers
Inside of me I need to know
If there, where I sink, in the undertow of unspoken words
Is more than Iâve ever seen

The real world, more than Iâve ever seen,
The sighs in me, I rise with the winds of sleep

Life sometimes seems like a fight â sleeping solution
A battle in between the left and right, the dark and bright - sleeping solution
Ainât nothing without light - sleeping solution
As life is not always light, I donât need to fight - sleeping solution

In my dream, there is no undertow, let me drown all alone

Life sometimes seems like a fight â sleeping solution
A battle in between the left and right, the dark and bright - sleeping solution
Ainât nothing without light - sleeping solution
As life is not always light, I donât need to fight - sleeping solution

Life sometimes seems like a fight â sleeping solution
A battle in between the left and right, the dark and bright - sleeping solution
Ainât nothing without light - sleeping solution
As life is not always light, I donât need to fight - sleeping solution

Life sometimes seems like a fight â sleeping solution
A battle in between the left and right, the dark and bright - sleeping solution
Ainât nothing without light - sleeping solution
As life is not always light, I donât need to fight - sleeping solution

Sleeping solution
