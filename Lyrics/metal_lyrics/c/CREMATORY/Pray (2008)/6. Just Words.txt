If words have meanings, then why are we bemused
If reasons wonât be ceasing, then why are we confusedâ¦just words

Silence ainât made to clear the shades
Silence ainât made, just like the blade of a maze
Made to disguise, all the grudge and all the fears
Just words

Words mean much more than you expect them to
And may cut deeper than youâre able to bearâ¦just words

Silence ainât made to clear the shades
Silence ainât made, just like the blade of a maze
Made to disguise, all the grudge and all the fears
Just words

Speak to me and if you want to, then you scream
Donât wait, just speak and I will be released

Silence ainât made to clear the shades
Silence ainât made, just like the blade if a maze
Made to disguise, all the grudge and all the fears
All the grudge and all the fears
By the unspoken wordsâ¦silence ainât made
