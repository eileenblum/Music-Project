A last trace of faith and the last grain of pain
Howls in past desires, a last prayer at parting
When I lie in my final bed, no more lies in my head
I will sleep beyond all fate, too numb to hate, a last trace of faithâ¦

Say goodbye, expectations six feet under
Say goodbye, slain by the god of thunder
Say goodbye, wonât ask you to tell, heaven or hell
Say goodbye, soon to fade away, with the memories in grey

The past wonât be awakened, though your soul might start breaking
Some pictures will remain to fade in the shades of a new love
We are lost in the past time and gone much to fast
Though someone says, the dieâs been castâ¦
But I see us fading in the shadows of a new life

Say goodbye, expectations six feet under
Say goodbye, slain by the god of thunder
Say goodbye, wonât ask you to tell, heaven or hell
Say goodbye, soon to fade away, with the memories in grey

My grief, my greed, transcend with the leaves
No more tears to shed, once simply red
Leave me alone, dreams wonât come undone
Bathed in fears, I beg you to swear, your honour, my death

Say goodbye, expectations six feet under
Say goodbye, slain by the god of thunder
Say goodbye, wonât ask you to tell, heaven or hell
Say goodbye, soon to fade away, with the memories in grey
