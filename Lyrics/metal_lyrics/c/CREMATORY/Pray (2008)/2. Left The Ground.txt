The sky is near, Iâm burning in the heart of the sun
Where I am, my feet donât move, they donât run
But I ainât yearning to be gone
Whenever this day will dawn, I will have

Left the ground
Touch the skies, just like butterflies
Leave the thoughts behind, let the sun go blind
I will see the next one from a higher ground
However it will make things turn, I will have
Left the ground
Touch the skies, just like butterflies
Leave the thoughts behind, let the sun go blind

And when all seems clear, Iâm freezing in the ray of lights
Where I go my thoughts will shine again
But I ainât yearning to be gone
Whenever this day will dawn, I will have

Left the ground
Touch the skies, just like butterflies
Leave the thoughts behind, let the sun go blind
I will see the next one from a higher ground
However it will make things turn, I will have
Left the ground
Touch the skies, just like butterflies
Leave the thoughts behind, let the sun go blind

Where I am, my feet donât move
Where I go my thoughts will shine again
I will see the next one from a higher ground
However it will make things turn, I will have

Left the ground
Touch the skies, just like butterflies
Leave the thoughts behind, let the sun go blind
I will see the next one from a higher ground
However it will make things turn, I will have left the ground
