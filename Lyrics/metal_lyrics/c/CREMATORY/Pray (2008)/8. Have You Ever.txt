They are getting small, these shadows on the wall
Shadows that dwell, for your own private hell
I know you will not try to understand, I know you will not strive for change

Have you ever thought about why, have you ever given it a try
Have you faced the flames inside
Have you ever understood mankind

Both ends burning, inside the circles turning
Staring into the glass, making a mess
No one knows whatâs meant to break, no one knows whatâs meant to take

Have you ever thought about why, have you ever given it a try
Have you faced the flames inside
Have you ever understood mankind

Smash it, break this glass -do it, stop this mess - stop it,
Bleed it out, reach for the sane

Have you ever thought about why, have you ever given it a try
Have you faced the flames inside
Have you ever understood mankind

Have you ever thought about why, have you ever given it a try
Have you faced the flames inside
Have you ever understood mankind
