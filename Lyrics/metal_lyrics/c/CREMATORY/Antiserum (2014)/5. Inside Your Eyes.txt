When storm dominate the chaos
Chaos is not enough to control
To control the flames
The flames of your passion
The passion fragmented in revenge
Revenge for all the grief
The grief and the scum of the earth
The earth devours all those present
The present when I can left the past
Big storms dominate the chaos
Chaos is not enough

I can see the face of the mirror
It makes me blind
I can stare behind the shimmer
Nothing to see inside your eyes

When storm dominate the chaos
Chaos is not enough to control
To control the flames
When dreams escape their destination
Destination survives all the humans
The human race in the abyss of despair
Despair - death and devastation
The devastation the tear of new world
A new world create from ashes
Big storms dominate the chaos
Chaos is not enough

I can see the face of the mirror
It makes me blind
I can stare behind the shimmer
Nothing to see inside your eyes

The dead man and the walker
The mirror and the slaughter
The beauty and the stalker
The mirror and the murder

Big storms dominate the chaos
The chaos is not enough to control
To control the flames

I can see the face of the mirror
It makes me blind
I can stare behind the shimmer
Nothing to see inside your eyes
