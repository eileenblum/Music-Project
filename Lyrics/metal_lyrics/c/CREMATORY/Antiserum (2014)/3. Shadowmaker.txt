When death kills the silence - unleashed in fire
Blood is thicker than water - faith is blind
In the name of the father - fear of the dark
Under the skin - through flesh and blood

Shadowmaker
The victim of life - the master of slaves
Shadowmaker - new steps - new life
Shadowmaker
Awaken the demons - dance of the dead
Shadowmaker - sick of myself - myself

The temple of the damned - king of the world
In the name of the lord - face in the dark
Faith no more - under the blood red sky
The evil one - slaughter of the soul

Shadowmaker
The victim of life - the master of slaves
Shadowmaker - new steps - new life
Shadowmaker
Awaken the demons - dance of the dead
Shadowmaker - sick of myself - myself

Written in blood - written in death
The victim of life - the master of slaves
Written in fire - written in pain
Awaken the demons - dance of the dead

Shadowmaker
The victim of life - the master of slaves
Shadowmaker - new steps - new life
Shadowmaker
Awaken the demons - dance of the dead
Shadowmaker - sick of myself - myself
