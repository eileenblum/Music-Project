Shadows awaken the loneliness
Forever found what seems lost
Never to believe, to know what to believe

Breath to breath - moment to moment - left behind
Day by day - and night by night - waiting for a sign
Breath to breath - moment to moment - lef behind
Day by day - hour by hour - waiting for a sign
Joy for joy - pain for pain - infinity of emptiness
Day by day - and night by night - the irony of fate

Horizons opened in all directions
They're here and now to pay
No time for self-knowledge
The wind whispers her name

Breath to breath - moment to moment - left behind
Joy for joy - pain for pain - waiting for a sign
Breath to breath - moment to moment - lef behind
Day by day - hour by hour - waiting for a sign
Joy for joy - pain for pain - infinity of emptiness
Day by day - and night by night - the irony of fate

Dream of fact - escape from reality
Truth or lie - found honesty
Black or white - the colour of life
Power and might - losing the game

Breath to breath - moment to moment - lef behind
Day by day - hour by hour - waiting for a sign
Joy for joy - pain for pain - infinity of emptiness
Day by day - and night by night - the irony of fate
