Day in day out the same control of me
The same control of my life
Wrong time - wrong place - the evil in your mind
The demon of the night
Break in break out - the colour of the free
The favourite colour of my life
Never too late - never too old
To stand the fight in your life

Until the end of a marvelous pain,
Until the end of your life
We stand strong to obey the rules
We are the enemy mine
From the pathetic cradle of innocence,
Until the end of your life
We stand strong to obey the rules
Take my breath until the rest of your life

New day - new chance - the meaning of life
The game of thousand lies
New breath - new kind - the enemy inside
Depraved in afterlife
Running from the unknown - fear of the truth
Facing the evil - wasted youth
Never to angry - never to shy
Waiting for a second survive

Until the end of a marvelous pain,
Until the end of your life
We stand strong to obey the rules
We are the enemy mine
From the pathetic cradle of innocence,
Until the end of your life
We stand strong to obey the rules
Take my breath until the rest of your life

Take my blood and take my eyes
Take my breath and take my lies
Take my voice and take my void
Take my life don't waste my time

Until the end of a marvelous pain,
Until the end of your life
We stand strong to obey the rules
We are the enemy mine
From the pathetic cradle of innocence,
Until the end of your life
We stand strong to obey the rules
Take my breath until the rest of your life
