Captured in everlasting ice - far and wide no life
Centuries, milleniums concealed beneath the ice
The truth exposed to daylight
Unknown cells assaulting fresh blood
Lost in icy fire - no change to survive

And now it's time to unleash our power again
We're the virus, the worm, the parasite
No tomorrow to release the antiserum
And now it's time to unfold our forces again
We're the virus, the worm, the parasite
Anti - antiserum

Disappeared under fire - running from the unknown
Centuries, milleniums hidden under thousand scars
A never ending nightmare between good and evil
No human contact - decomposed and rotten
Alone and vulnerable

And now it's time to unleash our power again
We're the virus, the worm, the parasite
No tomorrow to release the antiserum
And now it's time to unfold our forces again
We're the virus, the worm, the parasite
Anti - antiserum

We are the instinct of madness, we are the need to destroy
We are the rage of nature, please join us - please join us
We are the answer to all questions, all questions are asked
We are the lane to the dark side - there is no antiserum

And now it's time to unleash our power again
We're the virus, the worm, the parasite
No tomorrow to release the antiserum
And now it's time to unfold our forces again
We're the virus, the worm, the parasite
Anti - antiserum

We are the rage of nature, we are the need to destroy - antiserum
We're the virus, the worm, the parasite - no tomorrow to release the antiserum
We are the answer to all questions, all questions are asked - antiserum
We're the virus, the worm, the parasite - there is no antiserum
