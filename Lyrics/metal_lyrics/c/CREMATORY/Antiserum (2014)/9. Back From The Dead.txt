Back from the dead
Back from the dead - back from the grave
Back from the dead - back from the dead

The voices getting louder - the shadows growing longer
Eyes say more than words - pictures in the head
The dance of the demons - dreams have come awake
The devil has many faces - your fate in your own hands

Back from the dead
Back from the dead - back from the grave
Back from the dead - back from the dead
Forgiven and forgotten - protected and defended
Killed and raped - back from the dead
Erased and destroyed - wounded and infected
Back from the grave - Back from the dead

Anger, hate and fear - a trip in the underworld
Convicted and punished - speak to me - speak to the devil
Voices from the darkside - shadows in the light
Tales from the tom - a gift from God - from God

Back from the dead
Back from the dead - back from the grave
Back from the dead - back from the dead
Forgiven and forgotten - protected and defended
Killed and raped - back from the dead
Erased and destroyed - wounded and infected
Back from the grave - Back from the dead

Look in the eyes of horror
Turn the evil in you, into something new
Open the gates and spread out your arms
Return to the bossom of fools
Back from the grave - back from the dead

Back from the dead
Back from the dead - back from the grave
Back from the dead - back from the dead
Forgiven and forgotten - protected and defended
Killed and raped - back from the dead
Erased and destroyed - wounded and infected
Back from the grave - Back from the dead
