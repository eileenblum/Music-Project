The death corpse composed behind
In the dust of their self
To Terminate another life
A further obligation to make

Wounds of memory for ever to stay
The hall of souls are the hall of pain

Reward through a successful life
Punish through a painful life
A waiting soul for each new life
The deliverance to penetrate into nirvana
How much life need for all to know
Or is to be a punishment about our mistakes
To life with it

To understand what is it

Is the source the life - Is the source the death

The hall of torment to know more but they feasting
Is the waiting room for souls

Torment - Unknown - Pain for fear
Torture - Yearning - Waiting for deliverance

The question of existents
Reality or dream

I can see your pain in my dreams
I can smell your screams in my dreams
I feel your fear - Your fear for my dreams
