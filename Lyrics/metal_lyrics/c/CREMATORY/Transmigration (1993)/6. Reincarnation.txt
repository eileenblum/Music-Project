He is coming back...
Another body another face but same soul
His former life is filling up with hate and pain
Many people dying through his hands
Uponing to tortured

Uponing to tortured
And agonized with blood
The calling was to the dead ones always ahead

After the death given a new life
The punishment you taken for mistakes
His old corpse is rotting away
And smelling decomposed

Reincarnation - A new life
Reincarnation - The same way

His old corpse is rotting and decomposed
The punishment for mistakes is painful
Imprisoned in a deformity body
The deliverance out of this life
Is-the-death-imprisoned-deliverance-the punishment

His old corpse is rotting and decomposed
The punishment for mistakes is painful
Imprisoned in a deformity body
The deliverance out of this life
Is-the-death-imprisoned-deliverance-the punishment

After the death given new life
The punishment you taken for mistakes
His old corpse is rotting away
And smelling decomposed

Reincarnation - A new life
Reincarnation - The same way

Closing your eyes for off you prophesy
And ignored your mistakes
Agonized and murdered - Let your propelling the push

Look-forward-of your-new-birth
