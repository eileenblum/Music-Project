Caught in lifeless flesh
Screams of my fear that no one hear
Pain of my thought that no one knows

The yearning to death that I feel
Alone with myself
Despase and reject - Retired from normal life

Hear my cry - Hear my agony - See my blood
See my dreams - Feel my hate - Feel my vomit in your face

Look that makes me kill
Voices that laughs about me
Conceptions that ignores me
And feets that kicks me away

Caught in a body - A body of punishment
The angel of incorporeal souls have punished me
But the end of this torture are so far

Hear my cry - Hear my agony - See my blood
See my dreams - Feel my hate - Feel my vomit in your face

Caught in lifeless flesh
Screams of my fear that no one hear
Pain of my thought that no one knows
The yearning to death that I feel
