Glassy eyes - Empty remains
Dead voices - Broken dreams
Irresolute souls - Self destruction

Narrow coffin - Beautiful Grave
Black flowers - Bloody tears
Hopeless minds - Senseless words
Rest peaceful - Deep sorrow

Silent hearts - Impenetrable fog
Long shadows - Rest peaceful

Lonesome greeting - Violation melody
Glassy eyes - Empty remains
Irresolute souls - Broken dreams
Self destruction - Senless words
Silent hearts - Impenetrable fog

Lying six feet under feeling fine
Lying six feet under feeling fine

It's a never forgotten place -
Where I'm lying
It's a never forgotten place -
Where I'm lying
It's a never forgotten place -
Where I'm lying

At the never forgotten place
