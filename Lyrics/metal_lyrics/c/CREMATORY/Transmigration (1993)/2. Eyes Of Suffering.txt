Conception full of illusions - But eyes filled with pain
What yesterday was still today - Is tomorrow against away
The suffering from other life - in the new built within
From mistakes will be learn - But reached stolen mind

As is to be death in life - And lifed for the death
Or is to be insanity from sorrow - Or from trouble insane
The life is a child play - But no game for children

The eyes of suffering-The eyes of suffering
The eyes of suffering-The eyes of suffering
In the eyes of suffering - You lifed for you death
In the eyes of suffering - To know more as words and mind

Many times ago - Your rotting flesh feeled away
Your corpse full of holes - Lying in a small coffin
Your soul leaved away - Your bones to fall to pieces
A dinner for maggots - remaining dust to stay

From mistakes will be learn but reached stolen mind
As is to be death in life and lifed for the death
Or is to be insanity from sorrow or from trouble insane
The suffering from other life in the built within
