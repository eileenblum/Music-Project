my heart beats in slow songs pumping moments through my veins waking up in empty beds walk through months of band mistakes give me back the life i had i really had nothing nothings better that a city full of lies that push through me in a burning building you're a loveless friend now i watch the clock now i walk on knives i got problems i'm a fucked up kid i find problems i'm alone again
