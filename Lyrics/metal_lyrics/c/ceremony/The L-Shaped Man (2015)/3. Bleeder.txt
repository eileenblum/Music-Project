Are you calling old friends again?
Have you forgotten how to live?
You stood screaming in your room
There was no one there
No one heard

You desire to be seen
Youâre backing down the hallway again
You slept through entire days
âTil human voices wake you and you drown

Youâve become careless about time
Your soul seems to be in a knot
Have you been watching the sun rise?
Donât fall into the fire
