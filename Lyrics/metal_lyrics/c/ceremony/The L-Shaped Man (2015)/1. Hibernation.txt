You took pictures of your life
But stopped after awhile
Closed your eyes to faith
Shame and denial
You think now
Nothing went right
But you're wrong
You're so wrong
Are you having those dreams again?
Bodies of water
You have to get through this
Get through it all
Get through it all
Get through it all
