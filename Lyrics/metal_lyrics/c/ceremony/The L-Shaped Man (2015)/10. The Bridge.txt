Inside the bridge
You suddenly felt calm
Simply passing through the world
And remembered The Man with the Wooden Arm
How hard it must have been?

You saw yourself walking with no one else
And it scared you
The thought
But your heart was just asleep that night
No dreams at all

Itâs nothing like you ever thought

Why do you break sometimes when youâre alone?
Is it the feeling of heavy loss?
You donât think about her anymore
But you still lie

Going out and
Finding other things
It didnât hurt
It didnât feel like anything
