The color in the trees started changing
It got colder inside that house
You drove through a golden field
Fell asleep at the wheel of time

And it felt like youâd never come down
From that place inside your chest
That feeling may never stop

While your dreams warned you of the bad
All your problems would never fix
Nothing was ever right with you

When you try to fall asleep tonight
Remember whoâs here with you
Everyone you ever knew
Everyone you ever touched

Baby â

Say that itâs over
