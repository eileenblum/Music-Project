Underneath you can't escape the sound
Within this room
Boom boom
You pump the blood in and out

The root of the world is in the red heart

Poisoning the body distracts the mind
From what it needs
You couldn't sleep
You couldn't eat
Couldn't think
Chewing your fingers to the quick
With the intimacy of her cigarette
Lips lungs teeth
