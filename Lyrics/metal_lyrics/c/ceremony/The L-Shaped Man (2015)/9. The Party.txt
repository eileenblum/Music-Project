You canât remember
The face of a person you used to know
Did you even know them?
Did you ever really know?
Sitting at the party
On the stairs
They came back to you
They always come back to you

Some of those people
You used to love
Somehow it hurts to know
Theyâre gone from you
You should have known all along

After youâre feeling low
Small pains start to come
Try to forget the smell
You have to go
Someoneâs behind you
