You told your friends you were fine
You thought you were fine too
You told your family twice
How you had climbed up

But nothing in this world is fine
Nothing ever feels right
You have to tell yourself you tried
You tried
You tried
You tried
You tried

The pain will leave in the night
Memories return in the light
The pain will leave in the night

No one would find out
No one would find out

It started as a way to get by
You thought you'd survive through
You were lonely and wanted to die
That's just a weight you confide

But nothing in this world survives
Nothing ever feels right
You have to tell yourself you tried
You tried
You tried
You tried
You tried

The pain will leave in the night
Memories return in the light
The pain will leave in the night
Memories return in the light
The pain will leave in the night

No one would find out
No one would find out
No one
Would find out
