You remember sitting inside the cafÃ©
Selfishly aware of things You couldnât change
Edith was buried down the same street
âGive your heart &amp; soul to meâ

You remember the first time You called
Life arranged by feelings You felt
Standing in the snow
Always gone
The door in the floor
Always closed

You sat down on the patio
watched the cars go by
Heard the splash from Icarus
Falling from the sky
There was something You couldnât move
You couldnât be
Love turned into reasoning
Became so harrowing

People You loved
Places You saw
Portions are gone
