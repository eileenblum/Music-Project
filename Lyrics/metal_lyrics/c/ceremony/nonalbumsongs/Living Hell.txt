A never ending battle I have with myself that I call fucking hell. I live to die the American dream. Lying through our teeth and everything between. Do you turn your back, pretend you don't see, or open your eyes to the misery. Fuck... So here's to fucked up youth. Here's to burning lies. Here's to each fucking day that just passed me by. Fuck.
