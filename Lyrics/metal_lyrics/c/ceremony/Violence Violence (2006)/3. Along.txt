Tell me I don't need a blade that's razor sharp just to keep my thoughts under a lock and key. Making bad decisions press along while nails dig into me, scream for help but no one cares It doesn't matter anyway. Light won't carry through the room. The doors are locked. It's darkening. Every step I take gets worse. Solutions seem to fail me.
