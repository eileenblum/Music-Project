I've given up too many nights In hopes to hide away with sleep, Running from my enemy, but still she drags me by the feet. There's days when I can't find the time or even care to open my eyes. I drill the clock into the wall pass hours until I'm wrinkled thin. Nightmares seem to follow me, It's getting hard to remember my dreams. If I stay awake tonight I'll gain much more than growing old, Now each eyelid shut - I'm giving in but never giving up. Wake up.
