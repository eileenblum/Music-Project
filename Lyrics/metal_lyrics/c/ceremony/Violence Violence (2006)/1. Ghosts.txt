You find things about yourself that you will soon forget. Counting old friends left behind a jaded mind to go with it, hated flowing through your veins but jealousy is all you feel. Mistaken from the start always wrong it never ends. You can never be in love until you learn to be alone, you will never miss those heavy eyes until you're left with none. You can never achieve true happiness until you hang your head.
