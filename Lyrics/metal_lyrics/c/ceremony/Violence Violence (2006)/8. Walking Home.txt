I'm here to wrap my hands around society's neck. Slowly slip away against a lifeless grip. A long painful death is what you deserve, open your mouth, bite the fucking curb. Born into a vicious circle you learn to cut a the throat. Watching people lining up in tight single file rows. I still revolve around a world I choose to cut off. One nation under god over a burning cross.
