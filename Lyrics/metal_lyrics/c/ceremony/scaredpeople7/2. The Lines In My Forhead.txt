Among the wolves live tired sheep A match to fire in a thousand trees Try to survive without sacrifice Carry your emotions in the shape of a knife I have never felt so ashamed Behind closed doors is where i stay All the Pain i feel inside Willing to set myself on fire Shake the earth head through floor
