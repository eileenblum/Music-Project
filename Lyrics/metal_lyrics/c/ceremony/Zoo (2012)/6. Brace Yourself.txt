Living from the chest
Living through the day
Under blankets closeted
Behind the shop closing doors
On the rooftops in panel floors
The man remembers easier days
Before death went searching for his pain
Before day troubles before the stint
Hands cracked and calloused from surroundings
Son replaces father when father dies
He eats dead things to stay alive
His wife became widow it didn't take long
In the stomach was a stone that dropped from her heart
It stayed in her a year until a crack
The weight of her loss put her on her back
Resistance is a place where nothing lasts
The Pacific is a place where nothing lasts
A Pacific made of ash
Brace yourself
Try to stay alive
