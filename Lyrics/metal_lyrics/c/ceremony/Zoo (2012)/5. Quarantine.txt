Tell the doctor you have a bad life
You carry a knife carry a gun
Parents are white gaudy and slow
Fear is a house without windows

Call the police
Turn me in

When you go out you sit alone
Inside your head cemetery songs
I'm dying I'm dead
As love in the backseat
As heaven sent

Contagious in need of quarantine
