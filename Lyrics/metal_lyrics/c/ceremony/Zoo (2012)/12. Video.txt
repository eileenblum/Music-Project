Pacing the room dragging my feet
Watching the fog fill the street
Melody Drive empty at ten
Houses look bolted and low set
The network shows the movies
About persons through the blinds
Watching waiting and everyone cries

I felt the woman come closer
Fifty years moved from picture to picture
Inside it was pouring rain
I could hear the drops hit the screen
And nothing's the same as it was before
Outside the video
I would have loved to be there
To see it

Video
Real
