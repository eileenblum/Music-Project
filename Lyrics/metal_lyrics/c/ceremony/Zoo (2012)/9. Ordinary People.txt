Ordinary people we do ordinary things
Work is our water and we drink
Our eyes are a condition always moving our minds
Living inside a house of cards
Sublunary people we do sublunary things
Strangers of this world actors playing a disease
Burning through night its love that we crave
Every year every month every single day
