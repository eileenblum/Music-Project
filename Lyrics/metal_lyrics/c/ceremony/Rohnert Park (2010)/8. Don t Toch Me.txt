Wretched feeling and feeling split gone into and around the back I don't have any feelings, only some of servitude cringing, crying, awake don't look at me or anything Volatile, simple minded, only sinking and deprived You know you're a mistake all of you feeling nothing but to take braking fingers, needing splints all of you, i don't like you, i don't need don't touch me you're sickening
