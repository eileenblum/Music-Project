Can you help me out of phantom bay? This place is a vacancy stuck in figure 8 'where nothing ever happens' no one's ever late Why? Tell me why? The dullness is filling me I have to get away get this complacency out of me I'm my own figurehead in my own state Why? Tell me why the doldrums are killing me Hold my breath watch my mind sift away as useless as a compass in a hedge maze without a direction without a base Why? Tell me why dullness is filling me Living in the doldrums walking in the doldrums floating in the doldrums wandering the doldrums all day
