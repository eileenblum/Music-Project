Late at night living with myself i'm burning up all the time around the first of the month i'm breaking down all the time walking with my eyes to sky i'm outside in all the time at the end of each day i'm digging dirt all the time I was going on about town walked into a puddle and was put out I don't burn like i did when i was twenty two
