Jesus saves
Silence, maggots!

Once upon a time
There was a God who was fucked in the head
He came to me in my sleep and then said,
"Wake up, asshole, get on your knees
I want some head from a creation of me"
And I said, "I don't think so, God
I don't think that I could swing that way"
He slapped me in my face
And said, "Motherfucker, now you must pay"

I never read this in the Bible

Bendable Jesus, bendable Christ
Comes packaged with a cross and a shitload of knives
I am God and I'll give you pain
If you question my power or defile my name

He has more power than a G.I. Joe
Although resembles a Barbie doll, dressed like a ho

I am God and I have control
I'll kill you right now and devour your soul
I'm just a maggot, just a piece of clay
Nothing I say can change your way but
Everytime you lie, baby Jesus cries
Everytime you lie, baby Jesus dies
Everybody lie
Help me stop the production
Fully posable
Homosexual
Anal animal
Jesus Christ

Don't want to see your light
You haven't made anything all right
But if I should die tonight
Don't want to look at you
Don't even know what to say

You're not leaving heaven dressed like that
You're making Mother Mary very sad
Bendable Jesus, are you OK?
You're very violent for someone who's gay
