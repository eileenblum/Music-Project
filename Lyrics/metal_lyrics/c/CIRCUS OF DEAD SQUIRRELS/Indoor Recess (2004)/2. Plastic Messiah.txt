Sheep clones
Silicone titties
Phone sex
Test tube babies
Abortion
Birth control
Eat it up 
Never full
Overdose on cold medicine
When you are feeling sick

Opposites attract bullshit, itâs all the same
Everyone judges me before they know my name
Supermodel snobs and the anorexic bitches
Only spread their legs for the ones with the riches

I donât give a shit what you fucking think of me
None of you mean a goddamn thing to me
This is the product of an absent god
Too many people just stringing along
Time to separate myself from the idiots
And you can send me straight to hell

Go fuck yourself, worthless asshole

Corporate fucks, youâre living a lie
Other peopleâs money trapped in your eyes
Take a step off the edge
That fucking tie around your neck
Is like a leash that keeps you weak
As youâre dragged upon your knees

Everyone wants to be perfect
Everyoneâs a fucking whore for money
Force the bullshit you believe
Stuff your plastic messiah under a murdered tree

I donât need a reason to be pissed off anymore
I built myself up just to fall on the floor
I fucked up everything
But I donât fucking care anymore

Fuck it all
Fuck you all
This plastic society
This backwards morality
Everyoneâs an enemy
Everyoneâs my enemy
