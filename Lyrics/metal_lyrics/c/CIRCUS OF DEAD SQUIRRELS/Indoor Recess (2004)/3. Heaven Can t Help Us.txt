Confirmation is confirming
You're a mindless piece of shit 
Confession is tattletaling
On the blessings that you give 
Baptism is the drowning
Of all the truth your planted with 
Communion is the digestion
Of the holy hypocrite 

I must be dreaming
Tell me about God 
I was still dreaming
Teach me of this God 
Dreams murdered my soul 

Left to bleed on the side of the road 
My cross is broke, but my throne is gold 
One last splash of the fucking holy water 
Prepare for everlasting slaughter 

What can our dreams possibly mean?
When I awake, I get the feeling we're all alone 
Faith creates atrocities
When spoonfed into your soul

Heaven sounds so pretty (God can't help us)
To all the stupid little kids 
Every story in the Bible 
Are fairy tales reality conflicts 

Take control
Kill your soul 
Believe in what you see 
Starvation, rape, children suffering
