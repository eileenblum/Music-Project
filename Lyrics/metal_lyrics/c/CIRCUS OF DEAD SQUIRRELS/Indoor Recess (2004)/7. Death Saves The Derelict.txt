If I could disappear, would you love me?
Or do I have to pump heroin through my veins?
Or possibly sleep in the mighty jungle?
Where sex is written into the clouds

Dont blame the internet porn
Blame it on Walt Disney

I'm just the enhanced version of you
With bigger balls
Don't really care about anything
Keep flushing my toilet mouth down the drain
Death saves the derelict
Keep order by labeling me insane

Puberty is the process of perversion
The deep, dark secrets
From our childhood revealed

I spent every morning with Cap'n Crunch
I was cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs
I was a Flintstone kid
A fucking Flintstone kid
Now I'm a piece of shit
Smoking cigarettes and losing my fucking hair

Don't blame the internet porn
Blame it on Walt Disney
Take the blame under the sea
To that throbbing boner

Humongous balls
Don't give a fuck about anything

Put me in a children's movie
Make it all OK
