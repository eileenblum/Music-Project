Take me
End this dream now

I still remember the day I met you there in the dark, all alone
This obvious outcast creature, the greatest friend I've ever known
I still remember the first time I held you, our bodies trembled a little bit
And now you're buried with all the memories below the place where we would sit

Yesterday I'd be happy if the church burned down
If every trace of God was never found
Until confronted with this
Under the sun where your body would lay
I've never seen it shine that way
Into the greatest mystery you go

I can't forget that withered white face, the tired eyes, and the weakening bones
I knew that this was all ending too very soon
And I don't know if I'd be here if it wasn't for you
'Cause even when everyone gave up on me, you stuck it through

I never meant to forget you
I never thought this could be the last time

Even though you could not speak, you've said so very much to me
Give me one good reason why she doesn't deserve one last goodbye
If I could only turn back time
I would make this moment mine
Just want to hold you one more time, just want to kiss you forever goodnight
Tell me, God, will I ever get the chance? Tell me, God, will we ever meet again?

Stuck in my dreams and frozen thoughts
You're still alive in my broken heart
Stuck in my dreams and frozen thoughts
You bring heaven to this empty heart
And I'm sorry I wasn't there
Like you were always there for me
I wish to God that I could be there
I close my eyes and hope to be
I never thought to appreciate
My happiness from the love you gave
It seems life ended both ways
The day that you were taken away

You bring us love, then you take it away
You bring us love, then you tear it away
Pray for my death
Take me to death
Show me your death
Bring me death
Bring me death, God
