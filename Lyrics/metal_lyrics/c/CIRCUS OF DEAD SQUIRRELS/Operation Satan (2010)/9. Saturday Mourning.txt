My Little Pony, killed secretly 
Berenstain Bears, lost gall bladders
Mr' Fox poached, rich bitch fur coat
Curious George, brain filled with surge

Saturday morning is a blur

If cartoons are too violent, what about reality
Fuck you and your morals, the deceptions that you reap

We love animals

Ladies and gentlemen, Ringling Bros' and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus 
Proudly presents the greatest animal trainer of all time' SATAN!

The circus is in town, turn that frown upside down
Elephants and tigers slapped around
Off to the zoo where wild beasts are enslaved
Sit around and get stared at all day
We'll go to the farm where there's a petting zoo
Kids can touch and feed what's brewing in their stew
Not stuffed fucking toys, these ones bleed a bit
Real faces, sounds that will fill your pants with shit

Saturday morning is a lie
This is not fucking Nickelodeon
Not a fucking Pixar movie
This is a place where all your furry friends are tranquilized and beat

Sounds of nature
Scream in terror
Mankind is here

We love animals
The talking dogs and singing frogs
Sock puppet lambs, mascots for fans
Fat lazy cats, chimps in weird hats
Behind closed doors
Burn them, beat them, kill them
Fuck them, they mean nothing
Chicken nuggets in fun dino shapes
Trapped in the dark, crowded together in their own shit, they wait
Ultra processed, Disney Princess spaghettios with franks
Five months of hell, can't turn around, stuck in a small metal crate

We love the greeting cards, the fruit snack sharks, and Noah's Ark
But love cannot compete with ugliness and vanity
We're always so fucking hungry

And after all the ways we think we've grown, we're still a nation of hypocrit's
And after all the things we claim to know, we're still so primitive and ignorant
