Midway through life, I realized I went astray
From things that matter most, a pain that won't cease
Lost in the Dark Wood of Error every day

Need to witness hell before I know true peace
Must embrace darkness to reach enlightenment
Need to know the things that no one cares to see

The first ring of hell, I hear cries of torment
Millions scream in anguish, silenced by the heat
Never cared for what animals underwent

The second circle brings a storm of skinned meat
What's left of people who wore leather and mink
Women with make-up dragged to labs by their feet

Ring number three a swamp of garbage I sink
Fat slobs live below, they ate nothing but shit
A three headed hog eats lard and blood he drinks

In the fourth circle, those who wasted their wit
Disrupting creatures, tomfoolery to sell 
Now demons taunt them, starve them for stupid tricks

An eye for an eye 
Stripped down of your rights
You make think you're innocent
But ignorance makes you a suspect
Greed and gluttony 
Fraud and treachery
You may think you're better than this
Arrogance, a guilty verdict

I descend on a marsh, the fifth ring of hell
Where violent morons wage war with each other
They inflicted rage on those who could not tell

And in the sixth ring those who lived to smother
Animals for speculation, playing God 
Cut open, tested on a burning alter

In the seventh circle, a river of blood
Flows to the burning sands where bulldozers run 
Over the ones who tore down forests with grudge

Getting close now, circle eight, Bolgias I shun

Where government agencies are sealed inside
Ignored animals while corrupt deed s were done 

Who lies within the ninth ring after they die?
Forever frozen in the lake Cocytus
Where Satan himself the Lord of Sin resides

Menacing heads above the ice twitch and fuss
Slayers of innocence by religious rit's
No virgins wait here, just gashed throats, blood and pus

Men struggle to breathe, such a horrendous sight
I recognize Tony Hayward from BP
Smash his face down into the oil and ice

Approaching the center and what do I see?
The ones who made billions in life butchering
Can't cry about it now or their eyes will freeze

I see Ronald, Wendy, and the Burger King
Dangling from the mouths of Satan like cigars
Below contorted CEOs suffering

Arise from hell, once again beneath the stars
Mount Purgatory, dawn of a brand new day
Surrounded now by other penitent souls
Begin the journey that will pave the light's way

Through seven sins of nature I pay my tolls 
I am starved and beaten, branded on my chest
I cleanse myself, now ready to reach the goal

Travel the universe, meet the very best
A flash of light reveals the meaning of life
The vision comforts me, finally I rest

I see farm animals roam fields without strife
Horses without reigns wander wide open land
Primates live in jungles, not under the knife 

I see nature sleep in peace, untouched by man
Ocean creatures swim liberated and clean
Melodic skies of birds, silent desert sands

I see people shut down their deadly machines
Religions join hands, end this conceited war
A life worth living in a world so serene

I fall back to earth, see who we really are 
I lie down on the dirt and stare at the stars
