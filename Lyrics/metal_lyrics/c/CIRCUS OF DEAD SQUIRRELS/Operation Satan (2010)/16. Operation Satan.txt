Call it science, call it hate 
Call it means to separate
A baby monkey from its mom
To measure what, how bored we are?
Call it research, call it waste
Call it ways to manipulate
The moral codes we're supposed to know
Dissecting frogs, making puppies glow
Call it animal testing, call it vivisection
Call it the advancement of man from the sun
Call it Operation Satan

Godlike men, Operation Satan
Weak specimens, Operation Satan
The results are in, Operation Satan
It's barbaric sin with little correlation

Though never became a movie star
This chimp instead strapped by his arms
With a cocaine habit and HIV
Still lives just like a celebrity
It's Kate Plus Eight, Octomom time
Thanks to the work of March of Dimes
The lambs soon too will get a show
Each week Mom's killed then her brain's exposed

Here kitty, kitty, kitty'
We won't hurt your skull
Just want to drill some holes
Teach us how hard it is
To live life retarded

'Free to good home' read the newspaper ad
The Beagle's picked up and sold, now he lives in a lab
Used to run and play, perform tricks for rewards
Can't even bark anymore, cut out his vocal chords
They will shock his dick to make an old man hard
Pump his lungs with smoke, nicotine, and tar
Inject cancerous tumors underneath his skin
Looking for the cure?
Don't consume additives

Human curiosity killed the cat's getting stale
Disease is on the rise in two shakes of a lamb's tail
Our species is in the doghouse, we crossed forbidden lines
And I'll be a monkey's uncle if Earth lets us survive

So what if all the abduction stories came true?
Is this what you would want them to do to you?

Have you heard enough?
Have you had enough?
New ways exist that would cause no harm
Don't be too stubborn to admit we're wrong

Want money to save humans?
Cut the government wage
Mutilated cancer research
Multiplied fourth stage
So donate your money
To those they blatantly ignore
You know, the ones who keep us alive
Yet die in disregard
Look close at what you eat
Look close at what you wear
Chemicals designed to clean
Stain with blood and tears
Selfishly divided
Together we fall
We can make a difference
You can change it all
