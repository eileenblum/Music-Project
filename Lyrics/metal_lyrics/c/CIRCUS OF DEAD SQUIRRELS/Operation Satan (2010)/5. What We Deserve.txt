Man and Nature
Man and Animal
I know God can be so absurd
But sometimes we get what we deserve

Mankind will never know peace with itself
Until it first finds peace with everything else
The negative energy makes the earth react
There's nothing natural about it, just a way to fight back
And sometimes even animals choose to attack
And I love it when they do
It makes me feel so relaxed
I meditate, I ask the lord to grant them the strength
To kill and rectify the ones who steal my faith

And I pray, that the bullfighter dies tonight 
Oh yeah, throw him around and get a few in the crowd
And at the end of the parade the bull will pay the price
But at least now he can take a bow with some pride

Destiny (Fate)
Love and Peace (War)
Innocence (Guilt)
Happy Thanksgiving, what are you thankful for?
The killing of the tribes, are turkey's metaphors?
We eat then watch the horses race on TV
May the best horse win, the one zapped with batteries
Then together we can go hunting for deer
We pop 'em and stuff 'em, hang taxidermy chandeliers
We sleep with duck feather pillows, wool blankets peacefully
Until a prowler in the house murders entire family

Performers mauled by cats on stage
Fear fights back with unforgiving rage
In the crowd there's a lesson to be learned
That'sometimes we get what we deserve
A Harley Davidson man, a leather vest
The pain it cost to make, he could care less
And on the highway one day he crashed and burned
Well sometimes we get what we deserve

Lions and tigers and bears oh my!
Little boys and girls, a show of justice for your eyes
Grab some popcorn, grab a beer
You won't get in trouble; your parents soon won't be here

I want to watch you die
I want to watch you fucking die

Train dogs for killing, chain a coyote up
The coyote breaks free and chews the hunter's guts
Guns, drugs, and scum at the cockfighting pit
The roosters freak out and stab their handlers to death
A bear on a bicycle with burned paws
The bear rips the trainer's face off with its claws
A snake charmer tries to sew a snake's mouth shut
The snake bit's, injects venoms into his blood
An elephant screams as a bullhook is sunk
Into the elephant's side, breaks the man with its trunk
A rodeo clown likes to bullshit around
The bull sends him spinning like a merry go round

A poacher sneaks into the zoo at night
The rhino puts up a fight for its life
The horn pierces, it twists and turns
Cuz sometimes we get what we deserve
Timothy Treadwell should not have been killed
When people wrestle bears for comedy films
Make a joke of what'should be preserved
And sometimes we get what we deserve
Scold and criticize savage fools
But their broke machines can't work without tools
Can't just ignore all that you've heard
Cuz sometimes we get what we deserve

Depriving animals of their basic needs
To play our shallow, petty games
Is it too much to ask of you stupid assholes
(Let's have some fucking water for these animals)

Tsunamis and earthquakes (Come on Christ-man)
Volcanoes and tidal waves (Hurt us!)
I know God can be so absurd
But sometimes we get what we deserve
Floods and Blizzards (Come on Allah)
Tornadoes and hurricanes (Hurt us!)
(I want, if there's a god, to kick some ass down here)
