Where I see God, you just see green
What you call product I call a
Cheap shot violation
Brute abomination
Domination in vain, blessed with the brains to find better ways
Stand up to it, chickenshit
Don't lose yourself to corporate gain
Let them fall and crumble

Don't sleep through the alarm
The sweet dreams are over, wake up

Fun lovin' silly ones at Tyson bless their heart
With a goofy, toothless smile and a stench like a fart
Rich, white, fat fucks sit
Push insane objectives
Fifteen minute break; squeeze the chickens 'til they spew
Get to act like a caveman, yabba dabba doo
No time to use the bathroom
Piss on what they consume
I work hard on the line all motherfuckin' day
Bust a cap in yo feathered ass if you hurt my brain
East coast chicken choker, so insane
Don't hate the playa, hate the game BITCH!
Cash stackin' killa, pimpin' hens and hoes
I got blood and guts all over my clothes
No fuckin' chicken gonna peck my crew
Full of backwoods hicks and illegal foos SHIT!

Down in Hell, Chef Hitler rolls your balls in batter
Sam Walton sells your frozen thighs at a low price
Loose skin Jared from Subway devours your congealed flesh, eat fresh 
Bobby Flay grills and marinades your breast and legs

What kind of man slams an animal into the wall?
Were you molested?
What kind of people buy their food from Neanderthals?
The whole goddamn place does; united land of morons
What kind of country lets this happen without even a fee to pay?
The good ole USA
What kind of God do you believe in, is it like you, fat cheap and lazy?
Crucified for fast food

Slave master Sanders and his famous fried chicken
Antibiotics and arsenic a-make it finger lickin'
Buckets full of corpses
Piss shit'sauce and biscuits
Cute little slogans are the selling points
Not ethics and morals, doing chickens right
Things that'should disturb
Erased by spice and herbs
Travel long distance, got a craving for a blood clot
Look for a shithole, highway pit stop
Fat to the finish
Cuz I eat Popeye's chicks
Visit Chick fil-A witness the bizarre Mormons
Where the Word of God says 'Save the cows, kill more chickens'
Holy Sabbath Sunday
Rest for sin on Monday

Down in Hell, Genghis Khan packs your ass with breadcrumbs
Dave Thomas wants your fat ass as a midnight snack
Some asshole from McDonalds makes chunks of you a dollar menu
George Foreman, your blood dripping, his lean mean machine
