Be all you can be 
In the U.S. Army 
I want to kill 
Hut two three four 
An ounce of oil for twenty bodies more 
Direct orders from an alcoholic crackhead piece of shit 
Who's never fucking fought a day in a war 
Bag 10,000 fragile corpses more 
No mercy given to the women and children 
If the government tells you to kill it's not a sin 
President Pinocchio apocalypse at the tip of his nose 
Listen to me fucking listen to me 
Open up your eyes to the prophesies 
This Howdy Doody dumbfuck dictator has come 
To spill his ignorance upon the Earth 
The great apocalypse has begun 
No way to escape his puppet show of death 
The hills are alive 
Lit up by nuclear skies 
Yet still the truth is denied 
No more fucking lies 
President Pinocchio apocalypse at the tip of his nose 
Hip hip hooray for President Pinocchio 
When the world's engulfed in flames 
We must find a way to escape 
The hills are alive 
Lit up by nuclear skies 
Yet still the murdering swine 
Has taken control of your mind.
