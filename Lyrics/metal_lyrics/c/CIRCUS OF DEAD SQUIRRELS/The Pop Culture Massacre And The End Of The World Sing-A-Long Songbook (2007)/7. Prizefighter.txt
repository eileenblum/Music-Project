People can be so deceiving sometimes 
Feeding you lies that just eat you up inside 
We're rotting like the mystery meat at the Chinese buffet line 
But now I'm crawling back to life 
I'm dragging my bloody knees 
So take these chopsticks out of my ass 
I'm begging for the ice cream pretty pretty please 
Somewhere deep inside my broken mind 
I'm convinced that you could still be mine 
I know I'm bruised and bleeding 
But don't you ever count me out 
Come on take your best shot motherfucker 
I will always knock you down 
I'm feeling my second wind now 
I am alive and well 
I can steal you a piece of Heaven 
I can take them all to Hell 
Try to take what I adore 
I'm gonna smash your face right through the floor 
Motherfucker come on 
Bring the pigs and the filthy whores 
I'm gonna sonic boom until you breathe no more 
Up your ass motherfucker come on 
You really think you're something 
With your flying combos in the air 
But now I'm pushing every button at the same time 
It's cheesy but you can't defeat me 
X Y A B it doesn't mean shit you see 
This is the Sega version bitch prepare to bleed 
And they can try to beat the shit out of me 
I will break their goddamn heads 
Just give me some kind of reason to believe 
Pretty pretty please with cherries on top.
