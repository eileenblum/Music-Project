The fry kids and the chicken nugget buddies
Arteries clogged with shit that looks like Silly Putty
And then there.s Grimace morbidly obese
Dead overdose quarter pounders with cheese
The Hamburglar serving twenty-five to life
For stealing all the burgers for killing Mac Tonight
Captain Crook no one knows him anyway
On a desert island with his fish filets what a shame
Ronald McDonald where is your magic
A public sex offender now
Never ever trust a clown
Two all beef patties special sauce lettuce cheese pickles onions on a sesame
Seed bun recipe for suicide
Over a billion mealworms served
Crawling through your intestines headed towards your golden arch
The Happy Meal makes us giggle and laugh
Until the real prize comes storming out of your ass
Big Mac and Mayor McCheese
Sharing a life where mayo flows frequently
Then there.s Birdie works for Weight Watchers now
Became a Hindu now she.s worshipping cows
The Happy Meal makes us giggle and laugh
Until the mealworm comes poking out of your ass
You are what you eat you.re gonna die
What ever happened to the movie cups
The pizza the hot dogs the Arch Deluxe
Drinking a milkshake makes my head implode
The Egg McMuffin makes my bowels explode
We.re gonna break into your corporate mansion
Built on blood and greasy fries
Slit your throat crush your skull
Make all the others watch you die
Fuck McDonald.s fuck Burger King
Fuck Wendy.s fuck Taco Bell
Fuck your over processed grade F mutated meat
You.re gonna burn in hell
You are what you eat
Tortured and denied.
