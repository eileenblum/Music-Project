Bathing in flames 
The stink of burning flesh 
I shit my trousers what did you expect 
AHershey's stream of pain peanuts and corn galore 
Mr. Peanut Orville Redenbacher have declared a war 
Ernie Keebler sucks the E.L. Fudge from my asshole 
Dips Dunkaroos into the sludge 
Pillsbury Doughboy sits between my cinnabuns 
He pokes and prods and waits for Nestle Quick to come 
Snap crackle pop inside my pants 
I feel my Grapenuts start to do a little dance 
Then I hear the words of my fate 
Tony the Tiger screaming "They're great" 
Silly rabbit Trix are for kids 
Now I'm being punished for being so selfish 
If I could start again 
I would eat my Wheaties like Michael Jordan 
There's a fantasy inside my ass 
Familiar characters from my childhood past 
This is not a bad acid trip this is Hell's kitchen 
La puta de Chiquita Banana corta su cabeza 
The Chiquita banana bitch chops off your head 
It's crazy it's bad it's not good 
The Twinkie cowboy steals the cream filling from my cock 
The Jolly Green Giant smashes my balls like two peas in a pod 
Oscar Mayer makes a bologna sandwich from the shriveled remains 
And feeds it to the Devil Dogs 
Charlie the Tuna with his Starkist tuna lid 
Goes to cut my ass cheek gets the taint of my balls instead 
The Hamburger Helper glove tugs and rips off my cock 
Puts it in a box of Fruity Pebbles now a prize in Bedrock 
Aunt Jemima pone siropa caliente encima de su bolso de bolas 
Aunt Jemima puts hot syrup on your ball bag 
I'm shitting a rainbow of color 
La cocina del Diablo 
Necesito un Pudding Pop en el culo 
Viva por Telemundo 
Necesito un Slush Puppy en los testiculos.
