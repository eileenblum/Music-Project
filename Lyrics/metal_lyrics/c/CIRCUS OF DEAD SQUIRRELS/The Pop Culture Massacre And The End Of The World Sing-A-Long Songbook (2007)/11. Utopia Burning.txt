Welcome to the land of misery 
Welcome to the land of Sam's Club Botox and Vaseline 
Welcome to the land of the onion bloom and Vidal Sassoon 
It's ok if you wanna do drugs 
As long as your someone that Hollywood loves 
The government thrives on sex and lies 
Every speech of peace is hatred disguised 
Chuck E. Cheese and Ronald McDonald 
Nutrition starved and our children's role models 
The athletes are spoiled rotten steroid freaks 
Making millions playing games while others starve in the streets 
The church is corrupt and I hope that God's pissed 
They turned the Ten Commandments into a movie script 
Are video games the new bread of life 
Was Sonic the Hedgehog more powerful than Christ 
"Hey boys now you can destroy third world countries 
And jerk off to porno like G.I. Joe" 
In every child's toy box 
In every magazine 
Life is full of expectations I can never meet 
Life is just one long commercial that can't sell to me 
I can't be bought 
I can't be sold 
I don't care about cars and clothes 
About diamonds and gold 
Or which way the wind blows 
Racist Abe tried to save the slaves and Washington wore a wig on his head 
Home of the brave freedom rings equally but right now all the phones are dead 
"Hey girls put down that book and join Skipper at the tanning salon 
Now you can get skin cancer just like Barbie" 
In every child's toy box 
On every TV screen 
Pop Secret Tiny Toons Mr. Wizard Fruit of the Loom 
Cover Girl Playboy Maxi pads Altoids 
Toilet Duck Kool-Aid Mr. Clean Gatorade 
Tae Bo Bowflex Flowbee Blistex 
Michael Jackson Barbra Streisand Paris Hilton Richard Nixon 
Bring the lawsuits motherfuckers 
You can all suck my big fat American dick.
