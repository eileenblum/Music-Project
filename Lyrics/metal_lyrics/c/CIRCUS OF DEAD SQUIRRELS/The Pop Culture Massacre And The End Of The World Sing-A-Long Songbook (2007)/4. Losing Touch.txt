There's no medication that can help me now 
There's no medication that can save me now 
There's no medication that can stop me now 
Everyone get the fuck away from me before I fucking snap 
I'm the clown shooting people in the face for a laugh 
I want my mommy to make you all disappear 
Like she said she fucking would 
Filthy looks follow me because I'm tattooed and unshaven 
But all you heathens look so pretty to me 
I've lost touch with all you fucks 
And everything in my life including myself 
Chew your mouth until it swallows you 
Fuck yourself until you reproduce 
Smile swallow 
Put on a happy face 
Smile twitch put on a happy face motherfucker 
In an alternate reality the world is full of harmony 
Until the veins pop out of my head 
The doctor keeps a safe distance in the room 
Prescribing me something brand new 
Yet never heard a fucking word that I said 
Hear the screams of the lullaby 
In the darkest chambers of the tortured mind 
Where the saints and sinners show no divide 
Where the human race lines up to die 
Inside my mind everything dies 
Say those words to me over and over again 
Things get better but first more shit begins 
I don't have the patience to play this fucking game anymore 
I think I'd rather slit my throat 
It always looks like a rose then starts to stink like a corpse 
Then the feeling from a broken heart burning like a blowtorch 
I've lost touch with my love 
And everything in my life including myself 
There's no medication that can stop me now 
Maybe I should just kill myself 
Spill my brain all over the floor.
