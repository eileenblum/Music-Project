No Teletubby with a dildo on his head 
No Pee Wee Herman jerking off when Jambi says 
No purple dinosaur dancing with the Prozac kids 
No Eureeka's Castle who gives a shit 
No more Zoe or that blue fucking Spanish freak 
No more Baby Bear I can't stand the way that he speaks 
No more Elmo talking in third person 
Laughing like an asshole 
Talking in third person 
You ruined a legacy 
Everything was just fine without you 
You are the enemy 
Of the 80's and the early 90's youth 
The puppeteers tripped on LSD 
Cookie Monster never gave a fuck about obesity 
The Count gave into his OCD 
Big Bird Bert and Ernie questioned their own sexuality 
Aworld corrupted by "tickle me" 
Makes my ears bleed 
Elmo must die 
C is for cookie that's good enough for me 
O is for Oscar we like our Muppets mean 
D is for deathbed where Elmo sleeps eternally 
S is for the seams that we tear apart so violently 
You ruined a legacy 
Everything was just fine without you 
Who died and made you king 
Jim Henson must be turning in his grave 
Car fifty-four we're gonna need a stretcher and a sewing kit 
Brought immediately to 1-2-3 Sesame Street 
The cause of death suffocation by Snuffleupagas 
Yip yip yip yip yip yip uh huh uh huh 
Yip yip yip yip yip yip uh huh uh huh uh huh 
Who's laughing now Elmo's last laugh.
