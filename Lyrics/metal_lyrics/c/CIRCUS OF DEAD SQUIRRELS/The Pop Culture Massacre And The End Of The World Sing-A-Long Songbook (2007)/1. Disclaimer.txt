The following program contains strong language and concepts that may be construed as provocative, or perhaps controversial and is intended for mature audiences. Circus Of Dead Squirrels and their affiliates bare no responsibility for the misuse, or misunderstanding of the program material, and bare no patience for paranoids who would censor art. Censorship is not a substitute for good parenting or social intolerant behavior. Additionally, anyone not familiar with the concepts of fair use, parody, farce, or satire, might want to go look them up. So please thoroughly fuck off, or enjoy the show.
