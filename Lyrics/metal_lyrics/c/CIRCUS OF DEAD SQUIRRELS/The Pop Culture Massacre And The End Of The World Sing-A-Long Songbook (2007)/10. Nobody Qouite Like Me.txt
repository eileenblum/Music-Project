Twenty-five years somehow still alive 
I got the will but not the strength to die 
This gentle breeze makes me feel alright 
If I could just hold on to the way that I feel tonight 
Twenty-five years just to end like this 
Searching for a cure that will never exist 
Grown so tired of being stuck in this place 
With these heartless hypocrites known as the human race 
I spent my life sitting on the wall where I lost myself right before the fall 
All the king's horses all the king's men 
Could never ever put me back together again 
Everything I told myself a wonderful lie 
Everything I promised disappeared in time 
Walking in circles got me nowhere quick 
I traded my soul for a fortune worth shit 
Must be nice to be so unified 
To have your little clicks and a place to hide 
To pass your judgment on a creative mind 
To work your nine to five retire and die 
No tie around my neck 
No thorns upon my head 
No needle in my vein 
Nobody quite like me 
Light the candle say an amen 
It could never ever put me back together again 
Drank the wine I've heard the sermons 
It could never ever put me back together again.
