Pry your eyes open
A better world awaits you
This I want to belive
Maybe I'm too simplistic

Scaring me is your first defence
When your arguments don't make any sense
Blame me as I see through you
And close your eyes for the truth

Fear all you know
Sedation
The easy way out
Absence of life
Of human sensations you are deprived

Sleeping spirit
Time to wake up

The god damn past is haunting you
Now I see it consumes me too
Together we walk through misery
But you make me feel like your enemy
Never felt this alone
Far away without control
Thought we could forever last
Now a stable foundation is a thing of the past

Fear all you know
Sedation
The easy way out
Absence of life
Of human sensations you are deprived

Can we overcome
Things that divides
If we only could
Cast all differences aside

Break this monotony
Before it becomes our prophecy
Close to loose my blind faith
Needing approval before it's too late

Fear all you know
Sedation
The easy way out
Absence of life
Of human sensations you are deprived

Future unknown
Will I ever reach you again
Sweet afterglow
Memories of how you used to be
