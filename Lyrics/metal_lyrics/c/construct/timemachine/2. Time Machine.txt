Time always seem to move too fast or slow
Can't come to grips with this dimension
It's out of our control
But still one of our life's grand obsessions

Why can we only move in one direction
Where death is the only guarantee
Do I set the path for my own fate
Or is there already a masterplan for me

Lost in space
Where to find
Our path clarified

All that we need
Is find a purpose to be free
Would this be true
If timelessness reigned
We could in theory
Make our lives obsolete
With one supreme
Time machine

We are nearing our death day by day
The final limit that creates our motivation
Some climb the borders of sanity
Into a neverending downward spiral

Lost in space
Where to find
Our path clarified

All that we need
Is find a purpose to be free
Would this be true
If timelessness reigned
We could in theory
Make our lives obsolete
With one supreme
Time machine

All that we need
Is find a purpose to be free
Would this be true
If timelessness reigned
We could in theory
Make our lives obsolete
If we
Concede
To the supreme
Time machine
