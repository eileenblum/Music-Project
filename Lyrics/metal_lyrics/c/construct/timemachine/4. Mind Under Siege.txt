No matter how much
I do twist and turn
All I can see
Is an end to this world

Constantly trying to prove
That we are worthy of you

Nothing more to give
Utopia fading to grey
Mind full of wounds wide open
Infamy
My soul forever broken

All this wait led
To a monumental loss
Nothing but cries
As bliss turned to dust
To dust
To dust

Pleading
Yielding
Apathy I claim
Wanting
Needing
Something to blame

Burdens I now must elude
Feels like a lousy excuse
Excuse

Nothing more to give
Utopia fading to grey
Mind full of wounds wide open
Infamy
My soul forever broken

Mind under siege
Occupied by a disease
Peace of mind I can't attain
Nothingness please take me away

Nothing more to give
Utopia fading to grey
Mind full of wounds wide open
Infamy
My soul forever broken
