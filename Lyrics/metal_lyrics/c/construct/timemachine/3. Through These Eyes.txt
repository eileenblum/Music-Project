The seed was planted in me
So long ago
Now it's grown into a deamon
That I can't control

Battling a war
Feeling defeated
And torn

This time can't be undone
What has my life become

Battling a war
Feeling defeated
And torn

Nightmare comes alive
History
Your alibi
Hurt yourself to purify
Your mind from all the blame

On my toes standig by
Staring 'til I'm blind
From your slow suicide
I can't look away

Cataclysm all that I know
A life guided by fear
In a distant future
Will scars still be in control

Battling a war
Feeling defeated
And torn

Nightmare comes alive
History
Your alibi
Hurt yourself to purify
Your mind from all the blame

On my toes standig by
Staring 'til I'm blind
From your slow suicide
I can't look away

Feeling forced to cross the line
To avoid your last goodbye
I'm codependent by design
So please save yourself

Wanting to heal
But don't have the strength
To let go of the past
And victimization of yourself
Do you dare to look into your own eyes

Honesty hurts
You might be suprised
See for yourself
The mirrors don't lie
This is the only path to a better dawn

Nightmare comes alive
History
Your alibi
Hurt yourself to purify
Your mind from all the blame

On my toes standig by
Staring 'til I'm blind
From your slow suicide
I can't look away

Feeling forced to cross the line
To avoid your last goodbye
I'm codependent by design
So please save yourself

All this makes me paralyzed
Rejected and declined
Do I need to justify
The helplessness I feel

On my toes standig by
Staring 'til I'm blind
From your slow suicide
I can't look away

Attached to your own kind
Is a flaw of the mind
That always makes you deny
Reflections of yourself
