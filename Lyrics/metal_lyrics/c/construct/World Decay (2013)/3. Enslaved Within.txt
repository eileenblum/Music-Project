Once again
the frail connections die
Words unsaid echoes in all minds

Significance shines through me
But no one knows
how to read the silence

All hopes are thin
Wall of thoughts growing still
(Unable to speak)
All hopes are thin
Wall of thoughts growing still
Enslaved within

A thought of tomorrow
Will the golden silence breach?
Eradicated will to shine 
I am incommunicado

Evoke your lack of empathy
Destroy all that's left inside of me
