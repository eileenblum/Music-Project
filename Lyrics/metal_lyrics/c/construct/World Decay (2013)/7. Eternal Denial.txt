The world delivers a new dawn
Nothing but a rerun
Setting the state of mind
to soul regression

Despiteful past haunts today
Makes the mind astray
The damage is already done
Persevere eternal denial

A constant flow of reprisals
fills each new day
Numbing the anguish inside
makes no sense anymore
