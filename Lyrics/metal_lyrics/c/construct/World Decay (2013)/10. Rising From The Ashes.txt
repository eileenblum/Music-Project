Deep limbic system fails
All becomes indifferent
Most emotions lost to fate
Nothing feeds my heart to hate

Dark clouds fills the sky
Cold rain rapes old foundations
Never to feel
one with the world again

Don't break this fall
(It's in my mind)
No need for sympathy
(Ready for rebirth)

See me rise
Blindness of yesterday
Fuels the flames
See me rise
The distance inbetween
Makes me feel reborn

Fate lies in unknown hands
The guide of all is lost 
I find my instinct through
this chaos
