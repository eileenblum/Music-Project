Open the gates to infinity
Incur all new grounds
New levels in space and time
The less i search the more i find

Path of least resistance entangles
Torn by the gauntlet of trust
Walk the isle that brings you treason
Human soul burning into dust

Now I depart
Yesterdays vision of tomorrow
dies within my heart

Face tomorrow in selfsame disgust
Journey is bound to end
Life as we know it repeating itself
Embrace the plagued mind

Every thought and action
drowns in self-infliction
In vain
