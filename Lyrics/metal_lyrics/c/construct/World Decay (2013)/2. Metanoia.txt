Sedated, stripped and lost
all self-respect a mere illusion
The deeds youÂ´ve done
brought this to you

Eyes open still no sight
Malicious mind intrusion                                   
Seek true salvation
X marks the spot

Your neck twists towards the cold below
The tools that leads to freedom
lies at your feet

Let the pain of others 
rip through bone and flesh 
Dig into a black heart 
and lay dark soul to rest 

In quest for true forgiveness
sacrifice is the solution
A limb or two
for the greater good

A madmanÂ´s twisted Dreams
Trade pain for carnal absolution
Leave your past
desolate with your fear
