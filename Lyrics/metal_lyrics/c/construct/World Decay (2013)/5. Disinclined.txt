As eternity collapses
Neverchanging understuctures
comes to life
Instant aggress on the soul within us

On the verge of insanity
I need the shadows to hide me
My vision of hell
seems ethereal in this destruction

Detach from me
Leave me alone
You still won't stay
The scars remain
Won't escape my apathy
It finds me anyway

Hope dies here
In this instant
Leave me now
Make me distant
