Â 
Restless mind digs it's grave
in decreasing empathy
Riant thoughts evacuate

You preach, i asphyxiate
Always the same
The thrill becomes dull

Forcefed and numb
Salvation, will you ever come?

Pulled down below
the vanishing surface
Enslave us all
Elysian fall

No appreciation
for the human soul
Eternal torment awaits

One day it all will fall apart
The progress we made
fadeing into the unknown
Â
