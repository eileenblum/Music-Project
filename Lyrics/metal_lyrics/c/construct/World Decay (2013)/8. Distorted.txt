Last source of self resistance
Last chance to fade away
Without no premonition
all colors become gray

Dig up all that was hidden 
All commitments delayed
Anger turns you inside out
All deficiencies displayed

Burning rage makes you whole 
while it tears apart your soul
Imaginary road without an end 
It comes alive if you pretend

Distorted picture of whatÂ´s false
Start to pretend to break the fall
Bipolar dreams of apathy
Calm in false anxiety

The most intriguing question 
is not what is right or wrong
As long as nothing changes 
youÂ´ll have to play along
