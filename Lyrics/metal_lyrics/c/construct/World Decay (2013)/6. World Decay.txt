Perennial impairment reigns 
aching and wounded, 
tearing souls into shreds 

Empty black eyes gazing at the screen 
one's own volition 
drowns below in dry tears 

Infest, detest, domesticate free will
Subdue the minds resistance to our ascendancy

Swallow the silent terror
Live your senseless lives in gray
Swallow the silent terror
emotions make the world decay 

The vast trenches of misfortune
demolished wisdom burns 
in the flames of in-tolerance 

Oppression it shall fulfill
hide in the shadows or swallow the pill

Dead eyes
