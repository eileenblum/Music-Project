From the start
'Til we depart
A never-ending fight
To choose what's right

Immediate fix you crave
Transforms you into a slave

All delight we must repent
Will you ever comprehend?
Drawn to death by default
Primal weakness in us all

The magic poison
Becomes your sin
Temptation won't
Never let you win

To self-destruction we are damned
This impulse we should withstand
Drawn to death by default
Primal weakness in us all
