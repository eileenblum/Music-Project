Onwards to an infinite emptiness
Chaos in our design
Altering fate, we shall fall
The loss of humanity in us all

Rushing through without a slightest thought
Compulsive destruction by default
A trail of failures in our wake
The nature we cannot fake

Progress into depravity
Creating our downfall with true intents
A scorched reality
Progress into depravity

Subconscious, mission to end mankind
A final act of vanity
Losing the battle against ourselves
The darkness in which we dwell

Born of disaster
Slave to damnation
Road to the end, last exit behind

Madness gone too far
Nothing left to scar

Progress into depravity
Creating our downfall with true intents
A scorched reality
Embracing insanity

Progress into depravity
Forced down this path all without consent
Now revere profanity
As we progress into depravity
