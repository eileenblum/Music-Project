Beyond our abilities
We should live every day
Limits set by evolution
Live in this new conformity
Trends followed perfectly
Only brilliance shown externally

Live for the momentary rush
Deny that in the end
Every hit makes you weaker
Construct a new identity
Flaws hidden forcefully
Forget your true entity

Confrontation
Of our fixation
On the virtual lies

Deprecation
Renunciation
Hoax arise

Lost in the screen,
Far from your soul
Where narcissism is in full control
Penetrating your eyes
A flawless dream
Soon this viral disease
Reigns supreme

Feel the addiction grow
Distanced from reality
Human contact close to zero
Too much to take it all in
Suffering in agony
Let seclusion set you free
