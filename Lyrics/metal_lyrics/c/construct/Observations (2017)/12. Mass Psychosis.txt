As I lay my head down to sleep
I feel the scars of this life
Rushing back through my mind
This is not how I pictured my paradise
Only way I could stay alive
Is to turn deaf and blind

A never-ending thirst for power
Bringing out the worst in us all

Born into slavery
Corrupt code in our stagnant veins
Mass psychosis engaged
Selling our souls each and every day

We choose this path ourselves
To be led into submission
'Til the bitter end
This is not how I pictured my paradise
Only way I could stay alive
Is to turn deaf and blind
