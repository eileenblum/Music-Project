All rationality has died and decayed
From this existence I immediately want to escape
Disconnect me from this great absurdity
Stunning headlines guides your lives relentlessly

Shock and sensation going gold
Just be first and uncontrolled

Made to believe
Allured by the first thing you see
Gullible minds
Still Neanderthal inside

Your attention these flashes caught
Now spread the news around the world without a single thought
Make this lie your millionth excuse
Freedom of speech time and time again being abused
