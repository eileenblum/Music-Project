So used to carry the pain
All my thoughts I to you dedicate
Cold, black grief all that I see
Should I leave or welcome this insanity?

Constant hunt for a cure
Restless soul so insecure
Damaged hope weakened day by day
Life-long, everlasting pain

I become lost without your fears
All my pride fades to memories

Your darkness I now demand
Habitual need
In sorrow I went on to find
My purpose and peace of mind

All the prayers I keep within
Building up to a painful fall
Scars so deep it is sickening
Stuck in here, in need for an awakening

Trying to run from the fear
Escaping without any sense
Or find a way to be sincere to yourself
'Cause you can't erase inheritance
