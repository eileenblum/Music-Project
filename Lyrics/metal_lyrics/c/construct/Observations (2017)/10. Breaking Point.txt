As we search for the light,
We blindly believe deception
Can we get through this darkest hour
Before all hope dies?

Compassion subdued day by day
Now on the brink of eradication
We followed the wrong path for too long
Now our future seems so futile

In pitch black void
Without control
I strain to be
Unbreakable

But all the weight of this
Dystopic world
Grinds me down to
A final breaking point
