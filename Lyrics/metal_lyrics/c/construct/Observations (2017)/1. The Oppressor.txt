Say a word and I'll disagree
Eternal hate
You're my enemy
Growing rage fueled every day
Can not wait for your last breath

The oppressor feeds on our fear
Poisonous infection by the words you say

Free speech for you I can't defend
So tired to pretend
Can't stand a word anymore
Seen through your lies before

Disguised intension I reject
Your illusions, fear they reflect
Soon you're gone,
All too late
We rejoice as you suffer in your fate

Enjoy this short lived glory
As you die, we're saved from purgatory
Your ego grows like cancer
A fact you can't disguise
As you drown in your own lies
