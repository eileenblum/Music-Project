Far away and beyond
Our reasonable minds
Lies a key that unlocks
Infinite bliss

Too much respect
Corrupts ourselves
No determination left inside
Trying 'til motivation dies

Contagious circle of these repeating thoughts
Contamination is imminent now

All these choices got ourselves delayed
Indecisive minds fully displayed

Seeking with caution
For an option
Finding contradiction
Can you see the irony?
We're trapped in freedom

All these choices got ourselves delayed
Now our minds are stuck for nights and days
Way too distant from our path we stray
Indecisive minds fully displayed

All too often we seem to over-think
How to kill the voice of reason
We linger on about this wasteful day
As if consequences will last a lifetime
