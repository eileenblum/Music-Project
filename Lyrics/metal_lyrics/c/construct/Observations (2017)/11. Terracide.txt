We take this scenic world for granted
Neglecting her demands
We have only ourselves to blame
And our own blood on our hands

'Cause we murder the dreams
Of a better tomorrow

Living on the highest ground
Standing proud and tall
Too convinced of our supremacy
Egoism will be our fall

Slaughtering the innocent
The ones that can not speak
For our arrogance
Their misery fills our needs

Polluting the clear blue skies
Building up to our own demise
Too addicted to understand
Our vanity has gotten out of hand

Death - crawls out of it's cave
Life - soon nothing left to save
Attain - the loss common sense
Now - let our apocalypse commence
