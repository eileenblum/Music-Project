Merciless misery
Is flowing through my veins
It will not stop
Until I step into my grave

I compromise every thought
In my consciousness
Instinctive sentiments
Hardly gets expressed

Questions dwell within my head
Silence wins once again

Whispers turn into war
Tragedy we can't ignore
Patience might soon fade away
Seeing through the flaws
Probably for a lost cause

Wondering how much
I should give of myself
Will I feel used
Until I bid this world farewell?
