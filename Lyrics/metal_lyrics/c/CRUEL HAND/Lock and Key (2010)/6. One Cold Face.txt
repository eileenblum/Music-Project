So constructive in your misfortune The mastermind of your own destruction Feeling so small They start to crawl to the shelter of shadows Cast by those bound to fall What they donât know keeps them chained to ground Never willing to leave or even look out The look in their eye says ready to die Caught in a race for the casket to lie I see their faces everyday One thousand words in one cold face This is a vice for those who are viceless A way out from the world for those without ways out Distraction for some without ways to numb Everything that comes when under the sun This is my vice amongst other vices A means to ignore the whole world that surrounds us This is my vice amongst other vices A means to ignore the whole world I see their faces everyday One thousand words in one cold face One cold face One Cold Face
