Bound by chains Obey every word that they say to me Not only do they hold me down they manipulate the way I think Sometimes they let me free but still they hang from me Not for the world to see Trapped by the steal that holds me back Caught in the chains forever locked Iâm bound theyâll say is how that I was found Free me from the pain of lock and key Iâm bound by chains so strong So strong I canât move on Keep me out in the pouring rain No shelter in your shade So cold and they made me too Not by choice but they choose you Theyâll be here when I am gone Trapped by the steal that holds me back Caught in the chains forever locked Iâm bound theyâll say is how that I was found Free me from the pain of lock and key If I wait for the sun to burn off this rain, then Iâll be here for eternity Canât look to you to break my chains These chains are mine, for me to break Canât wait for the sun to burn off this rain Donât look to others to end your pain These chains are mine, for me to break
