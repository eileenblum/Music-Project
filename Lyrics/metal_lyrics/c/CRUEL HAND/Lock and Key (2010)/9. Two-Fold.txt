No comparisons in our lives Youâve never lived a day in your life Where Iâve been and what Iâve seen You could say the same about me but I can live with that, can you? We all have the choice to choose what we do with our lives Iâve never lived a day in your eyes No you donât You might agree but no you donât relate No you donât You might agree but no you donât relate Sometimes I wish that I was in your shoes doing all the things that you do thatâs how you know that I am human inside Iâm not afraid to question my life And I can live with that, can you? We all have the choice to choose what we do with our lives Iâve never lived a day in your eyes No you donât You might agree but no you donât relate No you donât You might agree but no you donât relate No you donât No you donât relate No you donât No you donât relate I wish you could but you canât Is that sad? No you donât relate
