One soul cold enough to crush mine Like glass I break Donât try to pick up the pieces You are too late Let them fall and never touch anotherâs hands They will cut and then will drop again This time just let them lay and walk away The one I gave my all was the one who let them fall And never touch anotherâs hands They will cut and then will drop again They will cut your hands, then drop again Donât touch my past Shards of broken glass Shards of broken glass
