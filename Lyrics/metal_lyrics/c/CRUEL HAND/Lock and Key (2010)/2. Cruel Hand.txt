Came into this world a vulture fighting for the scraps Like a dog beat one too many times, you start to bite back Sink your teeth in the hands of the weak, vengeance you seek on those who canât understand your pain The world will pay Can you blame him for the way he acts when he knows his future is as bleak as his past He would change it if he had the chance but at his first breath there was no chance left Not scared in the streets you roam Fear comes from the home Wondering where you fit in this world and lashing out at your own I canât blame you for the way you think I canât blame you Can you blame him for the way he acts when he knows his future is as bleak as his past He would change it if he had the chance but at his first breath there was no chance left Can you blame him for the way he thinks Your life was a pained experience Sometimes I wish that I could find your rage hidden in the roots of this family tree Youâve been dealt a cruel hand
