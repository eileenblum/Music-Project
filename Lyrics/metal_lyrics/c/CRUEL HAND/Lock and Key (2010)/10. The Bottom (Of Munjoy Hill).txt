When your soul is trampled Life dismantled What was once in your hands, now too much to handle You begin to rethink everything that you are Inside yourself is a constant war You donât see the face that you saw before Inside yourself is a constant war Too low to live Is this my time? Been back and forth from the other side Pushing me deeper into my black hole Twisting my world, spinning out of control Iâll pull you from the bottom If you pull me from the bottom We live amongst leeches We adapt to survive âIâm not one of these creatureâ I say time after time If I slip away slowly and I notice the fall Will your fierce hand of reality bring me back to it all?
