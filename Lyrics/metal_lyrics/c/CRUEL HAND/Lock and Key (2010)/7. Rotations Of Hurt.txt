I canât balance the world Iâm going to drop it on you And like me, youâll run from it too I never believed the world could turn on me But thatâs just how the world turns Rotations of hurt Steady rotations of hurt Once in the palm of my hand Now just on my back Crushing me to the ground until thereâs nothing left I never believed the world could turn on me But thatâs just how the world turns Rotations of hurt Steady rotations of hurt Once in the palm of my hand Now just on my back Crushing me to the ground until thereâs nothing left I canât balance the world
