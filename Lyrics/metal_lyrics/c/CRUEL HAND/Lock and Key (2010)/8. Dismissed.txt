You set your standards at forever No one lives at that level A start so strong, you gave so much In no time you were out of touch Do what you want, I could care less Burn that bridge you hope to forget You knew youâd leave too but thatâs just life I canât worry about you Faces come and faces go I used to judge but now I donât Faces come and faces go I used to judge but now I donât I looked up to those destined to leave I respect change but I still believe Faces come and faces go I used to judge but now I donât The ones whoâve settled are the ones whoâve lost on second thought Well maybe not Who am I to judge when you decide to go? What do I know? Nothing Nothing Nothing Nothing
