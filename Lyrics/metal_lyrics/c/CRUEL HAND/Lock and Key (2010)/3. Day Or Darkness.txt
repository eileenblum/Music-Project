All he ever wanted was a family Now itâs just one of many broken dreams Nightmare to live Day or darkness So much to give, no one giving to him Now he is broken Never to be fixed Heâs over throwing rocks Now heâs throwing bricks Nightmare to live Day or darkness So much to give, no one giving to him Now heâs lost it Look him in the face, tell him that heâs okay The look in his eye sayâs his burning alive Burning alive So much to give, no one giving to him Now heâs lost it
