They went their way and I went mine
Never followed the pipers path
Losing sand in my hour glass
Pissing in the wind spitting at the rain
Pissing in the wind spitting at the rain
It's what I'm gonna do I know
It's what I'm gonna do I know, I know
It's what I'm gonna do I know
It's what I'm gonna do I know, I know, I know
No care for futures
No care for pasts
The reaper blade comes quickly
His dull blade falls oh so fast
Pissing in the wind spitting at the rain
Pissing in the wind spitting at the rain
It's what I'm gonna do I know
It's what I'm gonna do I know, I know
It's what I'm gonna do I know
It's what I'm gonna do I know, I know, I know
Pissing. Spitting. Pissing, spitting it's what I gotta do I know, I know, I know
