Five lives were all we had to give
So we're living in the negatives
Breathe in and force myself to live
Give life to lifeless limbs
We live, we live in the negatives
Some days I think that I might thaw
Then I freeze and take away it all
Breathe in force myself to crawl
These limbs have frozen off
In the negatives
We live, we live in the negatives
I'm cold, so cold below zero
I'm cold so cold below
