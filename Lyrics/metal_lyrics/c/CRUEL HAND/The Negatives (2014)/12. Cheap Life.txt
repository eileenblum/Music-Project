Now you're living this curse birth after birth. Cheap Life. Born ruthless, no worth and useless. Expensive taste, life is cheap do unto them before it's done to me. Cheap Life. Now you're living this curse birth after birth. Cheap Life. Life is cheap. Do onto because they've done unto me. Wrong or right I lost that site. It all depends on how cheap is your life. Good or bad I once knew that. When life wasn't cheap but that was all in my past.
