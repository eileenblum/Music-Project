Why would I need to sell my soul?
Devil in me and so much more
Why would I need to sell my soul?
Devil in me and so much more
Why would I need to sell my soul?
Devil in me and so much more
But I have many names or I go by one
Slander you and the ones you love
Ones you love
Why would I need to sell my soul?
Devil in me and so much more
Why would I need to sell my soul?
Devil in me and so much more
Clipped his wings for only sin
Without you he is nothing
He took me hand when no one would
He understood when no one could
He gives me praise when no one should
Devil in me
Why would I need to sell my soul?
