You can't confuse me with your helter skelter
Try to soften the blow with things I already know
You can't diffuse this with your helter skelter
Smile, nothing's wrong
Shed this weight it weighs a ton
Don't need your charity
I have my clarity
Things that I couldn't see they are now so clear to me
I'm not faking. How could I fake this?
The point you missed is one worth making
You can't confuse me with you helter skelter
Try to soften the blow with things I already know
You can't diffuse this with your helter skelter
Smile, nothing's wrong. Shed this weight it weighs a ton
When you see me instead of speaking
Let's nod our heads and call it even
Look straight ahead and see through me
You're a vision not worth seeing
Helter skelter
