Lit a match
Burnt my bridge
I built a wall
Try to come in
I bit my tongue
Now I'm bleeding
Words you never could agree with
No one said the world had ended
Another day another confession
I spoke my mind
For no reason
No one cares
No one to listen
Does it matter
What I believe in
It's a temporary place and we'll all be leaving
No one said the world had ended
Another day another confession
If I smell like gasoline then I had to burn the ones who burned me
No one said the world had ended
Another day another confession
