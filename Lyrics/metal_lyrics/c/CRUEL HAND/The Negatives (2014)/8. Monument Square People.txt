Hell bent on 'time and temp'
Shadow cast on lives darker than death
Was on the 'west', I'm out on the 'east'
'The End' are the rocks on the beach
Failure-Can't hold my head high
On a search for something less
I found myself with emptiness
Was on the east. I'm out on the west
Home is a friend that couldn't give me his best
(Portland is the friend that couldn't give you his best)
Failure-can't hold my head high
Protest till I make things right
Redemption inside
Failure-can't hold my head high
Protest till I make things right
No thrills just pills. Just pills and a face to fill
And only one of these can ease this beast
Was on the west now I'm out on the east
Revenge is nothing but the rock at your feet
Failure. Protest. Redemption inside
