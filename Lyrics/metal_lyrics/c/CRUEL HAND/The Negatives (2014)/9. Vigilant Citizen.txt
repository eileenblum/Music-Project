I am just a vigilant citizen
In a house that no one is living in
Take away this ball and chain
Left to roam this desolate plane
Acceptance is a medicine
Vigilant. I fell asleep at the wheel
Citizen. Nothing left to feel
Vigilant. Gently put to sleep
Citizen
I am just a vigilant citizen
In a bed that everyone's pissing in
Take away this box and gain
Identity outside the frame
Accept and be accepted
Vigilant. I fell asleep at the wheel
Citizen. Nothing left to feel
Vigilant. Gently put to sleep
Citizen. Euthanize driver seat
Vigilant citizen
