I watch you choke on holy smoke
You're at the end and you hold that rope (unhinged)
And when you bleed it's all for greed
The sickness that's inside of you is inside of me
I am a beast, a human being. I'm everything I said I'd be
I want to watch you unravel
Watch you dismantle yourself with emptiness
Limb from limb unhinged
Open your mind with self decline
Slow and sweet, that's the kind, that's what I mean
I am a beast, a human being
I'm everything I said I'd be
I'm everything I said I'd be
I want to watch you unravel
Watch you dismantle yourself with emptiness
Limb from limb unhinged
