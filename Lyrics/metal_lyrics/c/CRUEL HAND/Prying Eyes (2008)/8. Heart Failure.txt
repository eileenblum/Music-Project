I've been dragging your name in the dirt. I'm sorry if it hurt, but this year was the worst. It wouldn't be like this if it were up to me, but it's out of my hands. I've been swinging my moods over your head. They floated like a feather just to drop like lead. Inside of me I had nothing left, but you reached in my chest and you pulled out the rest. What's on my mind can't outweigh what's on my chest, and I confess it's been three years since my last breath.
