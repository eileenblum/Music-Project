Don't look me in the eyes because what's on my face is not what's inside. It's a picture you could never paint. You don't understand, you could never relate. It's heavy thoughts increasing weight, everything you were born to hate. Feeling lost and out of place. Insecurities consume my days. Who's against you? Why would they care? I don't have the answers, I just know they are there. Eyes that are constantly staring me down. Hands that are pulling me into the ground. Smiles are taunting me and I can't figure out why I'm running from someone not worth writing about.
