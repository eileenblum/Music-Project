Life on display. Get out of my face. You want to know my every step and where I've been but it's not your place. Where I rest my head, who's my foe, who's my friend. If you see me keeping distance it's because you don't mind your business. I can't escape the prying eyes of the bored who I hate. You can't relate, don't bother asking, and just be on your way.
