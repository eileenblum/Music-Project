Dragged down into the depths of your mind. Hung from the gallows of time. Your thoughts tighten with weight. The hangman is you and now you have sealed your fate. Thoughts that dwell, no one to tell. Is this the end? No known graves. You drown in a sea of questioning. Flood gates released by your reckoning. Pulled by a hand so familiar. Reflections in water are as clear as a mirror.
