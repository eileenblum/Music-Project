Time flies by and you're the only thing that stays on my mind. I can't lie. Forget your face, every day I try. Life in shambles can we agree this is too much to handle? Life in shambles over fighting this losing battle. You can try to analyze... I won't lie to myself, It's been so long since I felt strong. Anger's not strength, it's a different defense, insanity is where I'm walking the fence. You can try to magnify the broken pieces of my life... to come up short is no surprise.
