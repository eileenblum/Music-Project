It doesn't matter how you read them, we'll always be on different pages. A big mistake so just erase them, tear them out and burn them. "Please forget because I've forgotten." Say these words and I'll leave. I promise. We'll always be on different pages. Go ahead and turn them. We used to share our smiling faces but honestly those were only phases. I've been grinding my teeth because I had something to say. I said, "nevermind." You said, "typical." Well that's so typical so I'll be seeing you.
