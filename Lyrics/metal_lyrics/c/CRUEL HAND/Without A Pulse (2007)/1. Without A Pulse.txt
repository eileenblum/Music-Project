you take the truth i know i speak. and make me think i lied. you take the life i lead and make me think i died. it seems we're living just too well. find a way to hurt ourselves. you find my faults and exploit them all. see sickness in my health. infect the way i see the world. infect the way i see myself. we've won the right to lose. take our chance. steal the proof. take your time steal that too. i live without a pulse to you.
