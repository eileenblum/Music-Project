when you drop it hurts. it will leave you burned. fast and now you've crashed. and you still haven't learned. if you want to tempt the ice, you better think twice. when you fall through, your life is too. you can't stand up, you can't get up. living your life under the ice. you're slipping. momentum keeps you moving. you have no grip, you start to slip. you eventually fall.
