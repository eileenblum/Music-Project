you wear masks because there's nothing left. an empty shell to crumble and fall. first you play some parts and fill some roles. you'll know how it feels to crawl. you think you know just what it takes. everyday a different face. to take the world on day by day. to make you think that you're ok. losing everything you thought you knew and what you wanted. saw a future in a magazine and bought it. to take the world on day by day. to make you think that you're ok. i don't want to find the real. is it too hard to just show yourself and what you didn't steal?
