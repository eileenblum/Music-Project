in a falling house of cards. the of what we called ours. i never needed a clue, we had two. it was me and you. house of cards. what it drop. tried hard for another tier. what's the point in another year? we always knew the cards would drop. why put off what can't be stopped? can't say that i had enough. ash to ash and dust to dust. watching as our world collapsed. would we ever want it back? you want to know exactly just where i'm at? foundation dropped. the walls fall in. do i burn the past or rebuild again? on the floor picking up the pieces of what i never could have.
