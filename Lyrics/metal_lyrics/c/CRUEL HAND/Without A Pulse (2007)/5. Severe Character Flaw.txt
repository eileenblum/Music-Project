i'd trade the earth for what it's worth. a corrupted bag of dirt. i'd rather live a life of hurt than fix a world that'll never work. guilt's something we'll never feel. maybe it's not real. losing sleep is for the weak. we see the signs but we don't read. ignorance is our bliss. no apologies for this mess. so now we rot. momentum is locked. the end can't be stopped. so give all you've got.
