you've been caught this time, uncovered your disguise. the mask you wear, i see it clear. not worth my time. your motives were so simple but you'll get yours in the end. everyday i hate myself for thinking you're my friend. can't let you manipulate anyone this time. kindness is weakness, sometimes the biggest flaw. i wish that i had noticed before i took the hardest fall. set me up to knock me down. a puppet on a string. sever ties and realize pain you'll never bring. i'll destroy what we've built, cut you out of my life. no one said this would last. so easily pushed to the past. nothing between us. memories erased. i self inflict this amnesia. can't you do the same?
