Alive - stay as long as I say
Save your breath until I'll set you free
Fight the raging war in your veins
Feed my pride, bear your destiny

[Refrain:]
I'm the one who gave life to the world
An artificial hope - depraved salvation
I'm the one who forced death to his knees
A feigned promise - hollow creation

Obey - satisfy my ego
Listen to your masters voice
Chained - put your soul in irons
Left at my mercy, there is no choice

[Refrain:]
I'm the one who gave life to the world
An artificial hope - depraved salvation
I'm the one who forced death to his knees
A feigned promise - hollow creation

It is accomplished!
My quest has come to an end
Mechanical healing
Hold your fate in my hands
While the machine starts beating - the rhythm of life

[Solo]

Open your eyes, give me a smile
Say "hello" to your father
The final chapter in the book of humanity
'cause I'm one step closer to become God

[Solo]

[Refrain:]
I'm the one ...
An artificial hope - depraved salvation
I'm the one who forced death to his knees
A feigned promise - hollow creation
I'm the one who gave life to the world
An artificial hope - depraved salvation
I'm the one who forced death to his knees
A feigned promise - hollow creation
