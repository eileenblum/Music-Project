Let's Go!
Let me infect your mind with fear
No job, no home
A constant threat of poverty
Doomed to ruin, dying alone

The unknown is your enemy
No peace, no freedom
The lack of security
Beware of the invasion

[Refrain:]
Do not believe in what they pray
False prophets cause anxiety and darkness
Do not believe their lies
Their propaganda's in vain, you fool
The system has failed

Let me fill your head with lies
poisoned food, poisoned air
The future of your children dies
Condemned to despair

Blind â follow your leader
Betrayed by the system of tears
Bleed for the the reign of terror
Enslaved by the system of fear

[Refrain:]
Do not believe in what they pray
False prophets cause anxiety and darkness
Do not believe their lies
Their propaganda's in vain, you fool
The system has failed â The system has failed

Trust in my words, the end of your misery
Trust in my way, I know the solution
I rule over you, control the thoughts in your head
The weaker you are, the stronger I get

[Solo: Gerd Lucking / Oliver Lohmann]

You're blind ... you bleed

[Refrain:]
Do not believe in what they pray
False prophets cause anxiety and darkness
Do not believe their lies
Their propaganda's in vain, you fool
