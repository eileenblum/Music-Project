I've been captured in a world of grey
Petrified beyond life
A heartbeat breaks the silence, rise up through the dark
Don't be afraid, darling, you are safe

[Refrain:]
For my unborn child - a human sacrifice
The dead fight for life

I've been floating in an empty space
Banished from reality
God has made his sentence, turn off the machines
My fight is over, it's time to let you go

[Refrain:]
For my unborn child - a human sacrifice
The dead fight for life
For my unborn child - a human sacrifice
The dead fight for life

I trade my life - a human sacrifice
Sell my soul for you - inanimate subject
I trade my life - a human sacrifice
Sell my soul for you - inanimate subject

[Solo]

Walking on the flat line, there's no turning back
Your first scream will be my last breath

[Refrain:]
For my unborn child - a human sacrifice
The dead fight for life
For my unborn child - a human sacrifice
The dead fight for life
