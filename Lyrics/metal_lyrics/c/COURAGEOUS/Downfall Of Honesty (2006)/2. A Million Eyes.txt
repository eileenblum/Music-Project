There are some tiny hairy monsters
Crawling over me, rustles in the corner â oh, no
There are some slimy sleepy creatures
Wriggling up my legs, coiled up under my bed
It's so disgusting

[Bridge:]
In the middle of the night, straight from the hidden places
They're coming out to eat me up alive

[Refrain:]
Go away â watched by a million eyes
You make me sick, go away â scared by a million ...

Some nasty freaks ...
Whirring around my head, greedy for my blood
There are some dirty ugly insects
Creeping up my pillow, scratching in the shadow
Simply disgusting

[Bridge:]
In the middle of the night, straight from the hidden places
They're coming out to eat me up alive

[Refrain:]
Go away â watched by a million eyes
You make me sick, go away â scared by a million eyes
Go away â watched by a million eyes
You make me sick, go away â scared by a million ...

Creeping, crawling on the floor
Slipping, sliding on the walls
Rumbling, scratching on the door
Coming closer, they got me by the balls

[Solo]

There are some grumbling smutty goblins
Rumbling in the dark, banging in the closet
There are some weirdly whispering demons
Slippering in my room, sneaking in a nightmare
It's so disgusting

[Bridge:]
In the middle of the night, straight from the hidden places
They're coming out to eat me up alive

[Refrain:]
Go away â watched by a million eyes
You make me sick, go away â scared by a million eyes
Go away â watched by a million eyes
You make me sick, go away â scared by a million ...

A million eyes
