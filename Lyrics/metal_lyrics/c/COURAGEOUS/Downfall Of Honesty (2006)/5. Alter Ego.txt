Is this where I belong?
Why don't I feel at ease in my mind?
Am I dreaming now? Or am I just a dream?
Am I captured in the depths of your head?

[Refrain:]
Infinite ways to choose â your ALTER EGO
Views of myself, so hard to number
Forge your own truth â dream within your ALTER EGO
There's more than you ...

Can I trust in what I see?
Everything seems unreal around me
Will I find myself somewhere?
Under a different sky?
There are more worlds than you can see

[Refrain:]
Infinite ways to choose â your ALTER EGO
Views of myself, so hard to number
Forge your own truth â dream within your ALTER EGO
There's more than you believe

[Solo]

[Refrain:]
Infinite ways to choose â your ALTER EGO
Views of myself, so hard to number
Forge your own truth â dream within your ALTER EGO
There's more than you believe
Infinite ways to choose â your ALTER EGO
Views of myself, so hard to number
Forge your own truth â dream within your ALTER EGO
There's more than you believe
There's more than you ...
