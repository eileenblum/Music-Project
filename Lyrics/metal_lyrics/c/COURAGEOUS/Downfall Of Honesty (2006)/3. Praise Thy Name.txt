Under the burning sky on Jericho Hill
Time is empty, the world stopped moving
The hordes, they're coming nearer
Those who remain, the last of their kind
Remember the face of their fathers

And when Eld's horn is blown for the last time
Hail to the guns, let the bullets fly
Brothers in arms fight the final stand
Come together, "no prisoners"
One after the other, dying in the sand

I raise my gun, let go all my fears,
this thundering sound, the last thing you will ever hear

[Refrain:]
Forlorn â in the face of dawn I stand and I meet all the fellows,
perished on my path
And I shall praise their names

Surrounded by death, last man standing
The blood of the fallen on my hands
Their ghosts, they're haunting my memories
The weight of guilt lays on my shoulders
Forever a part of my story

Blaming faces, hidden in the dust, washed away with every step in trust

[2nd Refrain:]
Forlorn â in the face of dawn I stand and I meet all the fellows,
perished on my path
Forlorn â in the face of death I stand and I see all the fellows, dying on my path
And I shall praise the name of those, who were sacrificed for my aim

[Solo]

Time is empty, the world stopped moving
The hordes, they're coming nearer
Those who remain, the last of their kind
Remember the face of their fathers

Leave all behind, I wander alone, It is done, the world has moved on

[2nd Refrain:]
Forlorn â in the face of dawn I stand and I meet all the fellows,
perished on my path
Forlorn â in the face of death I stand and I see all the fellows, dying on my path
And I shall praise the name of those, who were sacrificed for my aim
And I shall praise the name of those, who were sacrificed for my aim
