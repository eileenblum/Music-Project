Quoniam venit dies magnus irae ipsorum
Et quis poterit stare

I return on a white horse, my bowl is filled with anger
I return on a red horse, I am your sin

Et vidi de ore draconis
Et de ore bestiae
Et de ore pseudoprophetae
Spiritus tres inmundos in modum ranarum

[Refrain:]
Grey earth, red sea, dead air
And the sparrow sings no more
Black moon, cold sun, dark stars
And the sky is silent

Et septimus effudit fialam suam in aerem
Et exivit vox magna de templo a throno dicens
Factum est

I return on a black horse, my bowl is filled with death
I return on a pale horse, now I am His wrath

[Refrain:]
Grey earth, red sea, dead air
And the sparrow sings no more
Black moon, cold sun, dark stars
And the sky is silent
Grey earth, red sea, dead air
And the sparrow sings no more
Black moon, cold sun, dark stars
And the Guf is empty

"And there shall come a day when the sparrow sings no more
The first infant born without a soul, born dead as a soulless child must be,
Heralds the death of the world and so is called the final sign"
