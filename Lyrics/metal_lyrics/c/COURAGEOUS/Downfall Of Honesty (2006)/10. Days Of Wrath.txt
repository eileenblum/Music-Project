Arise - the earth is trembling
How many times has your mother been raped?

A storm comes up, howling for revenge
How many times did you ignore the agony of her son?
And when the earth awakes ...

[Refrain:]
... the days of wrath have begun
With a scream all life turn pale, suffering her last breath
The wild seed vanishes in the dark - silence ...

In rage - a wall of crushing water
How many times did you abuse her daughter?

The elements heal their mother in distress
Erasing her disease: mankind
And when the earth awakes ...

[Refrain:]
... the days of wrath have begun
With a scream all life turn pale, suffering her last breath
The wild seed vanishes in the dark

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
The last day of all life has just begun
Too late for mercy, it's too late to regret
The day of reckoning has come, it's your fault

[Solo]

[Refrain:]
... the days of wrath have begun
With a scream all life turn pale, suffering her last breath
The wild seed vanishes in the dark
Silence covers the sky
