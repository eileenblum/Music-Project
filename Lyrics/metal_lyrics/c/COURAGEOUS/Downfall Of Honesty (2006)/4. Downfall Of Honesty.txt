Stick your fingers in my eyes and make me blind
Spread your slanders, destroy my creation
Iâm the hostage of your vanity
The unknown attraction of your freakshow

[1st Bridge:]
You lock me up, you drag me down in your world of triviality

[Refrain:]
Never worship the master of lies and your kingdom of fools
Never drop my way, no compromise - The downfall of honesty
A raging greed for submission in your theater of fakes
cynical world of deception - The downfall of honesty

Burn my bridges, tear them down and steal my past
Chain my visions, take the colors off my dreams
I hate your world of manipulation â you sucker
I treat you with my scorn

[2nd Bridge:]
You lock me up, you drag me down in your world of triviality
I wonât deny myself, I will never fail

[Refrain:]
Never worship the master of lies and your kingdom of fools
Never drop my way, no compromise - The downfall of honesty
A raging greed for submission in your theater of fakes
cynical world of deception - The downfall of honesty

Your world is full of dirt and dust, dying in stagnation
Your demons of the past, they rape your mind
And help me breaking through, now I'm free

[Solo]

Deal with the devil, a victim of your arrogance
Stop, stop talking! words without content
Refuse â refuse to live in conformity
And you won't shatter my dignity

[2nd Bridge:]
You lock me up, you drag me down in your world of triviality
I wonât deny myself, I will never fail

[Refrain (x2):]
Never worship the master of lies and your kingdom of fools
Never drop my way, no compromise - The downfall of honesty
A raging greed for submission in your theater of fakes
cynical world of deception - The downfall of honesty
Never worship the master of lies and your kingdom of fools
Never drop my way, no compromise - The downfall of honesty
A raging greed for submission in your theater of fakes
cynical world of deception - The downfall of honesty
