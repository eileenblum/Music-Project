[Staubach]

You cannot be without dreams and fantasy
You throw away a place of shelter every day
Still believe

[Refrain:]
Shadows â take a look behind this broken walls
Disbelief â you're the guilty one as heaven falls
Dreams are gone and turned into a nightmare

You brought back misery into paradise
You always turn around when an angel dies
Still believe

[Refrain:]
Shadows â take a look behind this broken walls
Disbelief â you're the guilty one as heaven falls
Dreams are gone and turned into a nightmare

Shadows of disbelief
Never trust the holy whore, there's no salvation
Shadows of disbelief
Heaven or hell, it's your own creation
My phoenix rises up from the ashes again

[Solo: Gerd Lucking]

Keep yourself a little piece of harmony
The power of illusion remains eternally
Still believe

[Refrain:]
Shadows â take a look behind this broken walls
Disbelief â you're the guilty one as heaven falls
Dreams are gone and turned into a nightmare
World of love turned into nowhere
