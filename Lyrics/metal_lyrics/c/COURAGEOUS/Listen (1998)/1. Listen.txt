[Lohmann, Mischon, Staubach]

Should I be like you, sucker?
You better listen!

Oh, I'm infected by your virus
I walk my way, live my own day
Take down myself in my house of pain
No more orders, no more regrets
Wake up myself, dancin' naked through the rain

[Refrain:]
Do you know what I love?
Listen to me!
Do you know what I hate?
Listen to me!

Oh, I'm infected by your virus
I'm an eagle, the fallen angel
Dirty love, turned me inside out
I change my fate, hide behind a mask
Break the chains, I conquer the world

[Refrain:]
Do you know what I love?
Listen to me!
Do you know what I hate?
Listen to me!

[Solo: Gerd Lucking]

[Refrain:]
Do you know what I love?
Listen to me!
Do you know what I hate?
Listen to me!
