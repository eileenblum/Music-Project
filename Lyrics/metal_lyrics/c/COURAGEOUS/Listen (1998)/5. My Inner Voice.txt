[Staubach]

I am your master, you're under control
I am your priest, I will take your soul
I am your voice, I say what's to do
I am your pain, cause I kill you

I am your devil when your cock starts speakin'
I am your heart when it's bleedin'
I am your friend, I will tell you some lies
I am your God, I say when it's time to die

[Refrain:]
All the things you ever see, you see them through me
You have to obey the words I say, with your life you have to pay
My inner voice speaks to me â listen!

I'm your desire in a world of terror
I am your saviour in a time of danger
I am the keeper of your unknown passion
I'm the destroyer of your lovely illusions

I am the ruler of all your temptations
I am your anger, your full of aggressions
I am your life â listen to me
I am your death, I say when it's time to flee

[Refrain:]
All the things you ever see, you see them through me
You have to obey the words I say, with your life you have to pay
My inner voice speaks to me â listen!

See what I see, do what I do
Feel what I feel, cause I am you!

I am your master, you're under control

I am your devil when your cock starts speakin'
I am your heart when it's bleedin'
I am your friend, I will tell you some lies
I am your God, I say when it's time to die
I am your master, your

[Refrain:]
All the things you ever see, you see them through me
You have to obey the words I say, with your life you have to pay
My inner voice speaks to me â listen!
