[Lohmann, Staubach]

Lost in a world of nothing, soldiers of war
Burn in gasoline, rainbows no more
Your saviour he comes

The prize of all your sins, you're the guilty one
Blood on your hands, your work is done
Your saviour he comes
A new rose is born
He takes your hands, he sets you free

[Refrain:]
Come on, little girl, tell me what is pain?
I am the master of thunder and rain
Come on, little girl, listen and take my hand
I am one with, one with the ...

Hate and anger deep inside, the sky falls down
Die by my hand, somewhere far beyond
Your saviour he comes
A&gt; new rose is born
He takes your hands, he sets you free

[Refrain:]
Come on, little girl, tell me what is pain?
I am the master of thunder and rain
Stop to moan, my dear
I am one with, one with the pain again and again

Down on your knees
Down on your knees and pray to the beast
Pray to the beast
I am the lord of eternity
Come on, trust me

Take my hand
Take my hand and follow me
Follow me
I am the lord of eternity
I am the lord of eternity

[Solo: Oliver Lohmann]

[Refrain:]
Come on, little girl, tell me what is pain?
I am the master of thunder and rain
Stop to moan, my dear
I am one with, one with the pain
