[Staubach]

One step away, I am paralyzed
I don't know the reason for the darkness inside
Death creeps through my veins
I crossed the border line
The power awakes inside, I'm back in time

[Refrain:]
There's a fire in my eyes â fire's burning bright
To be alive that's the price â fire!

See my life in slow-motion, pain turned to hate
I have the might to change my unwritten fate
One step beside, I am alive
God, you can't take away my will to survive

[Refrain:]
There's a fire in my eyes â fire's burning bright
To be alive that's the price â fire!

[Solo: Gerd Lucking / Oliver Lohmann]

[Refrain:]
There's a fire in my eyes â fire's burning bright
To be alive that's the price
There's a fire in my eyes â fire's burning bright
To be alive that's the price â fire!
