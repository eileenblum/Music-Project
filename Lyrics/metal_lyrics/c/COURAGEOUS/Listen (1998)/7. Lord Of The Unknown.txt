[Lohmann, Mischon]

I feel the rain of pain is comin' over me
I know the day to pay is near
I take the flight tonight into the unknown
Oh lord, save me, take me, I'm alone

[Bridge:]
Words won't be spoken, eyes can't see
(No more) tears won't be cried, my heart will beat no more

[Refrain:]
I am falling down, I'm burning out

I see nothing, bleeding, my heart is dead yet
I hear the bell of hell in my head
I pay the price of life, my heaven â a dark sky
Can you hear me, feel me, while I die

[Bridge:]
Words won't be spoken, eyes can't see
(No more) tears won't be cried, my heart will beat no more

[Refrain:]
I am falling down, I'm burning out
Lord of the unknown, lord of the unknown

Lord of the unknown
Oh my lord, I'm coming home
Lord of the unknown
Oh my lord, I'm coming home
I'm coming home

[Solo: Oliver Lohmann]

I feel the rain of pain is comin' over me
I know the day to pay is near
I take the flight tonight into the unknown
Oh lord, save me, take me, I'm alone

[Bridge:]
Words won't be spoken, eyes can't see
(No more) tears won't be cried, my heart will beat no more

[Refrain:]
I am falling down, I'm burning out
Lord of the unknown, lord of the unknown
