[Lohmann]

There's a world between the lines
Unknown eyes can't see
My entree-card is signed by blood
But Midian will set me free

All what I've done it's all the same
'Cause Midian will heal my pain
I'm no man, I'm no beast
A place of deliverance is all what I need

[Refrain:]
Six feet under, down by the graves
Midian

The face inside the burning blood
His prophecy is death
I'm an innocent victim, nailed to the cross
Hell's wrath

I'm a living dead, I'm an outlaw
The sun of life I will see no more
When the sun goes down, we leave our graves
Midian awakes

[Refrain:]
Six feet under, down by the graves

[Solo: Oliver Lohmann]

[Refrain:]
Six feet under, down by the graves
Midian
