[Mischon, Lohmann]

My panic's rising
Awakening from a blackened sleep
Distinguish the voices
But something's wrong, I can't speak

Frozen agony
Knowledge of the terrible truth
Immortality
God-like, oh I can't move

[Refrain:]
Die â not me
Die â immortal
Oh my lord, I don't know the reason
Live â with my fear
Live â with my pain
Lord, what's the reason for?

Supersonic freak
No return on my fast lane
King of the road
Oh, what a shame

[Refrain:]
Die â not me
Die â immortal
Oh my lord, I don't know the reason
Live â with my fear
Live â with my pain
Lord, what's the reason for?

[Solo: Gerd Lucking]

[Refrain:]
Die - not me
Die â immortal
Oh my lord, I don't know the reason
Live â with my fear
Live â with my pain
Lord, what's the reason for?
