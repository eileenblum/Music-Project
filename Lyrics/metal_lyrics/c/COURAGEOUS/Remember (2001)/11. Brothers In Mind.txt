[Lohmann / Lucking / Staubach]

(I say) Goodbye, hello
Here I am again ï¿½ I am rising from the dark
Nobodyï¿½s dying anymore
A transition to a renewal of my old exhausted body
Eternal youth

No more children will be born, I go to death as a volunteer
I reawake in you !

[Refrain:]
I look at you, I see myself
Got memories, Iï¿½ve never had ï¿½ brothers ...
Forever young, eternal life, I start where you stopped

Playing God, weï¿½re God ï¿½ the last mystery is solved
Time of death has been settled since birth
Creation of a new civilization, no life outside stateï¿½s control
A human mass-breeding, puppets on a string

[Refrain:]
I look at you, I see myself
Got memories, Iï¿½ve never had ï¿½ brothers ...
Forever young, eternal life
I start where you stopped ï¿½ brothers in mind

Wherever you go, whatever you see, whoever you meet
- second hand life, You and I, weï¿½re brothers ...
Wherever youï¿½ve been, whatever you know, whoever you love
- second hand life, You and I weï¿½re brothers, brothers in mind

[Solo: Lohmann]

[Refrain:]
I look at you, I see myself
Got memories, Iï¿½ve never had ï¿½ brothers ...
Forever young, eternal life, I start where you stopped

Brothers ... brothers in mind, Brothers ... brothers in mind
