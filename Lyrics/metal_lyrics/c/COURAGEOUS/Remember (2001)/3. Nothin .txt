[Lucking / Lohmann / Staubach]

Explosion, I wanna scream
Unbelievable wrath, a crash, no discipline
Youï¿½re a time-bomb out on the road, a killing machine, overload
Like a fly on the wall you burn, up to the limits, no return

A face without a name, ascend to heaven
And you donï¿½t care about it, ï¿½cos you played God

Blow you away, I ram you down
Feel my gun on your neck, listen, like it sounds

[Refrain:]
Who gives you the right to threaten my life ?
Nothinï¿½ worth killing for
Whatï¿½s your prize when somebody dies
Nothinï¿½ worth dyinï¿½ for
Nothinï¿½ ï¿½ Nothinï¿½ ï¿½ Nothinï¿½ ï¿½ Nothinï¿½
Speed freak

Hate, yes, I feel hate
Sense my anger, no reaction, itï¿½s too late
Youï¿½re trapped in the thrill of speed, struggle for getting higher
For being better than the rest, faster than the speed of light

Your face without a name, ascend to heaven
Somebody doesnï¿½t care about, another bastard played God

[Refrain:]
You didnï¿½t see this little girl, an accident, self- pity and self- reproach after
She will never smile again, hold her head up high while she dies

[Solo: Lucking / Lohmann]

[Refrain]

Nothinï¿½ ï¿½ Nothinï¿½ ï¿½ Nothinï¿½ ï¿½ Nothinï¿½ ï¿½ killing for
Nothinï¿½ ï¿½ Nothinï¿½ ï¿½ Nothinï¿½ ï¿½ Nothinï¿½ ï¿½ dying for
