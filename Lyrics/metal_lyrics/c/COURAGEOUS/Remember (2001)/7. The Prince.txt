[Lohmann / Staubach]

At dead of night, a shadow floats in
Iï¿½m gripped in pleasure ï¿½ Iï¿½m gripped in fright
Howling once again for innocent blood
An all-time loser, but youï¿½re my God, Mr.Lee

Down on my knees with the face in the dirt, I obey the master
Live on the scraps you scorn, treat me like a grinded worm

[Refrain:]
Oh, prince arise ï¿½ from the ashes again
My prince arise ï¿½ come and hear my plea, come and hear my plea
Oh, prince arise ï¿½ from the ashes again
My prince arise ï¿½ come and hear my plea, come and hear my plea

Heï¿½s an English gentleman
His bloodshot eyes ï¿½ they hypnotize
He just stands there and watches me
Frozen blood in my veins, but I like it

Down on my knees with the face in the dirt, I obey the master
Live on the scraps you scorn, treat me like a grinded worm

[Refrain:]
Oh, prince ariseï¿½ from the ashes again
My prince arise ï¿½ come and hear my plea, come and hear my plea
Oh, prince arise ï¿½ from the ashes again
My prince arise ï¿½ come and hear my plea, come and hear my plea

Your slave, Iï¿½m your slave ï¿½ punish me - A servant of the dark
Your slave, Iï¿½m your slave ï¿½ punish me ï¿½
An unholy creature ï¿½ a child of the night
Let me be, let me be your renfield ï¿½ Iï¿½ll do everything you want
Let me be, let me be your renfield ï¿½ Iï¿½ll give you everything you need

[Solo: Lohmann]

[Refrain (2x)]
