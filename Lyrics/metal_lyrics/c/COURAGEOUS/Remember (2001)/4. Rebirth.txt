[Lucking / Lohmann / Staubach]

Seconds before I didnï¿½t know where I was
Now I donï¿½t know where I am
Open my eyes, I canï¿½t remember whatï¿½s beyond the dark
Iï¿½ll take your sight, Iï¿½ll take your speech - Iï¿½m an angel with a black soul
Gouge out your eyes, tear out your tongue - I am the bogeyman

Feel like Iï¿½m trapped in a warm liquid dawn
Now my time has come
Restless, under pressure, claustrophobia
Iï¿½ll take your love, Iï¿½ll take your hope ï¿½ Iï¿½m your hovering nightmare
Assault your innocence, Iï¿½ll rape your mind

[Refrain:]
Return of the chosen one - I invite you
Return of the chosen one - Born again - welcome ...

Creeping, crawling to reach the other side
To the light at the end of my way
Instincts awaken, I can smell it, the taste of pleasure and pain
Iï¿½ll slave your soul, Iï¿½ll taste your blood ï¿½ Iï¿½m your forbidden fruit
Extinguish your fire, Iï¿½ll increase your fear

[Refrain:]
Return of the chosen one ï¿½ I invite you
Return of the chosen one ï¿½ born again ï¿½ welcome to my rebirth !

I know, the prophecy comes true
As a lamb I was born, I came back as a lion, now Iï¿½m the wrath of God
I donï¿½t know which part I have to play
Should I have to protect or should I have to kill ?
For whom I will shed my blood ?

[Solo: Lohmann]

[Refrain:]
Return of the chosen one ï¿½ I invite you
Return of the chosen one ï¿½ born again
Return of the chosen one ï¿½ I donï¿½t know who I am ?
Return of the chosen one ï¿½ I donï¿½t know what I am ?
WELCOME
