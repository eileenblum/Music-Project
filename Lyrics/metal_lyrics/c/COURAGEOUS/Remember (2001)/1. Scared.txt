[Lucking / Lohmann / Staubach]

You donï¿½t want to know whatï¿½s up with me
Donï¿½t want to know whatï¿½s goinï¿½ on in my head
You better never feel my breath on your skin (your skin)
My breath on your neck

Somethingï¿½s deep inside, I canï¿½t control it
Obscuring my mind

[Refrain:]
Iï¿½m scared - Iï¿½m drowning in a bed of blood
Iï¿½m scared - Donï¿½t let it be true, make it stop

I locked up the door, protect me from the world
Protect the world from me
One room ï¿½ no window, thereï¿½s no way out
Thereï¿½s no chance to flee

Somethingï¿½s deep inside, I canï¿½t control it
Obscuring my mind

[Refrain:]
Iï¿½m scared - Iï¿½m drowning in a bed of blood
Iï¿½m scared - Donï¿½t let it be true, make it stop

[Solo: Lohmann / Lucking]

Somethingï¿½s deep inside, I canï¿½t control it
Obscuring my mind

[Refrain:]
Iï¿½m scared ï¿½ Iï¿½m drowning in a bed of blood
Iï¿½m scared ï¿½ donï¿½t let it be true, make it stop
Scared ï¿½ Iï¿½m drowning in a bed of blood
Iï¿½m scared ï¿½ donï¿½t let it be true, make it stop
