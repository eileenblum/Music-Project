[Lucking / Lohmann / Staubach]

A trip of confidence, a trip of confidence

Iï¿½ve got the key for an eternal sleep
Where I can heal all your wounds
Follow me on a journey to a mysterious land
A new beginning

[Refrain:]
Repent ï¿½ repent of your sins, cleanse your souls, confession
Pray ï¿½ pray for deliverance
A trip of confidence
Suffer ï¿½ suffer your pain, in deal with despair, no solution
Scream ï¿½ scream out your agony
A trip of confidence

Iï¿½m your lover, your worst enemy
The reflection of your soul
Donï¿½t be afraid when you close your eyes
Awakening ï¿½ your death lies in my hand

Be careful of what youï¿½re wishing
It might come true

[Solo: Lucking / Lohmann]

[Refrain:]
Repent ï¿½ repent of your sins, cleanse your souls, confession
Pray ï¿½ pray for deliverance
A trip of confidence
Suffer ï¿½ suffer your pain, in deal with despair, no solution
Scream ï¿½ scream out your agony
A trip of confidence, a trip of confidence

I know your secrets, your obsessions
I wanna make your dreams come true
Donï¿½t believe in something youï¿½ve never seen before
Open-minded, forever free
