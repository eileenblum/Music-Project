[Lohmann / Staubach]

Deafening silence, an infernal din
Colours turned to grey
My world stops movinï¿½, collapse like a house of cards
Shadows of the past, haunting me each single day

[Refrain:]
Sudden death - one soul has to leave the world behind

Million angels in heaven, why did you take her away ?
(say) What kind of God you are ?
Fall down on my knees, let me touch her one more time
Submission, forever yours ï¿½ take my hand and heal my heart

[Refrain:]
Sudden death ï¿½ one soul has to leave the world behind
Sudden death ï¿½ forever ï¿½ a part of me has died
Every single death is just a sudden death

[Solo: Gerd Lucking]

No more explanations, no more apologies
Never end what weï¿½ve begun
Unspoken words, they will be spoken no more
Unexpected loss, said is said and done is done

[2nd Refrain:]
Sudden death ï¿½ one soul has to leave the world behind
Sudden death ï¿½ forever ï¿½ a part of me has died

[Solo: Olli Lohmann]

Within seconds, skyï¿½s crumbling down
Lost far beyond nowhere
Everlasting doubt, could Iï¿½ve prevented this tragedy ?
Neverending anguish, in the depths of despair

[2nd Refrain:]
Sudden death ï¿½ one soul has to leave the world behind
Sudden death ï¿½ forever ï¿½ a part of me has died
