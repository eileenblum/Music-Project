[Lohmann / Staubach]

Down from your self-made throne and leave your sheep alone
Breaking the silence
I know the woman whoï¿½s tortured to death, I know the child who dies in your name
Self-confessed servants of God, take off your crown ï¿½ stained in blood
Washing their hands in innocence
I know the root of all evil, I know the serpent you hide inside

[Refrain:]
Pain inflamed through human hand ï¿½ do ya remember ?
Suffer agony eyes wide shut ï¿½ do ya remember ?

Stir up hatred and jealousy, come on, ride on insanity
Overwhelming collective murder

[Refrain:]
Pain inflamed through human hand ï¿½ do ya remember ?
Suffer agony eyes wide shut ï¿½ do ya remember ?

So many Gods, so much pain, there is so much harm you will never know
Promises, so many lies, I will remember and Iï¿½ll never forget
Are you scared to die ? thereï¿½s a place of refuge that takes away your fears
And believe - donï¿½t follow the blind, prophets of hypocrisy
Open your mind and you shall see where to go ï¿½ remember !

[Solo: Olli Lohmann]

Down from your self-made throne and leave your sheep alone
See people at the end of their dreams

I know the woman whoï¿½s tortured to death, I know the child who dies in your name
I know the root of all evil, the serpents you hide inside
The blood on your fingers, the tongue which lies to me
But I donï¿½t know the one who condones all this ...

[Refrain:]
Pain inflamed through human hand ï¿½ do ya remember ?
Suffer agony eyes wide shut ï¿½ do ya remember ?
Golgotha, what has a man died for ? ï¿½ do ya remember ?
Golgotha, what has a man died for ? ï¿½ do ya remember ?
Yes I do !!
