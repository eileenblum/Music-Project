[Staubach / Lohmann / Mischon]

Incognito, Iï¿½m incognito travelling through the time
A hollow man ï¿½ far far away from home
No one can see, only few can feel me, a shiverï¿½s running down their spine
Tragedy ï¿½ misery ï¿½ I see what people ever want to know

Silent witness, Iï¿½m a silent witness, I try to learn and to understand
Whatï¿½s the reason for the dead world I came from ?
Reached out for a place of salvation, I faced the source of doom

[Refrain:]
The fourth dimension - Suffering the very beginning
The fourth dimension - Back in time to see myself dying

Invisible, Iï¿½m invisible at definite places at certain times
An uninvited guest to the battlefields of the past
Everything is fixed, nothing can be changed now
Since the first breath of mankind
Destiny ï¿½ agony ï¿½ it was too late ï¿½ the dice is cast
Reached out for a place of salvation, I faced the source of doom

[Refrain:]
The fourth dimension ï¿½ suffering the very beginning
The fourth dimension ï¿½ back in time to see myself dying
The fourth dimension ï¿½ suffering the very beginning
The fourth dimension ï¿½ back in time to see myself dying

Empires grow through centuries, fell into dust within seconds
Clowns live like kings and kings rule the world like clowns
Warriors kill their brothers, to be murdered by their own flesh and blood
Each child, who raped the mother, is another dead child in a dying world

[Solo: Lohmann]

[Refrain:]
The fourth dimension ï¿½ suffering the very beginning
The fourth dimension ï¿½ back in time to see myself dying
The fourth dimension ï¿½ suffering the very beginning
The fourth dimension ï¿½ back in time to see myself dying

No one can see, only few can feel me, The shivers running down their spine
Tragedy- misery ï¿½ I see what people ever want to know

The wheel of time is always spinning forwards, sometimes it might turn back
To see the future in one manï¿½s past ï¿½ remember tomorrow
