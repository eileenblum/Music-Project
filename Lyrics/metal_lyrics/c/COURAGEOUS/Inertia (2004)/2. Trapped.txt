[Lohmann / LÃ¼cking / Staubach]

Helpless
Eyes are burning in frozen fire
My ears are locked in squealing pain
Losing control, I'm screaming in vain

[Refrain:]
I don't fear death - I'm afraid to die
Lost in myself with blinded eyes
Trapped!

Breathless
Everything is hazy around me
My mouth is retching moaning darkness
Reducing me to a trembling mass

[Refrain:]
I don't fear death - I'm afraid to die
Lost in myself with blinded eyes
I don't fear death - I'm afraid to die
Lost in myself with blinded eyes

Trapped under the sword of destiny
Hundreds of graveyards, a funeral in my head
When it's time - it's time

Who will stop the world and give me shelter ?
Chase the demon and set me free ...
Claustrophobia

[Solo: Oliver Lohmann]

[Refrain:]
I don't fear death - I'm afraid to die
Lost in myself with blinded eyes
I don't fear death - I'm afraid to die
Lost in myself with blinded eyes
Trapped
