[Lohmann / Staubach]

[Solo: Gerd LÃ¼cking]

All over the world they knew my name
Adored like Gods, sons of fortune
Remember my walk of fame
Cherished by the audience
Whatever I did, I won the game

[Bridge:]
Riding the wave of celebrity, dive into oblivion
Drowning in the shadow of a black box, emerge to the limelight

Reflections of my shattered life
How could it have come to this ?
Memories make my heart bleed
I lost track of things
The spell is broken, welcome to reality

[Refrain:]
When you've fallen for seven times - I've been tortured
Got to get up eight times - I've been tortured by memories

[Solo: Oliver Lohmann]

After all the ups and downs, I'll be back again
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger
Break through the darkness - lock up the past
I am - I'm real - I am the one who's

[Bridge:]
Riding the wave of celebrity, dive into oblivion
Drowning in the shadow of a black box, emerge to the limelight

[Refrain:]
When you've fallen for seven times - I've been tortured
Got to get up eight times - I've been tortured by memories

Memories of your faces, your screams, the thrill each time I met you
I want it back
The more time passes, the more I miss what I had
I want it back again

[Solo: Oliver Lohmann]

[Bridge:]
Riding the wave of celebrity, dive into oblivion
Drowning in the shadow of a black box, emerge to the limelight

[Refrain:]
When you've fallen for seven times - I've been tortured
Got to get up eight times - I've been tortured by memories
I have been tortured ... I have been tortured by memories
