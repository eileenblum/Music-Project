[LÃ¼cking / Lohmann / Staubach]

Go!

Now here I stand amongst my unfulfilled dreams
Black ghosts of my past surround me
I'm awakening out of nothing
Without a destination, without a memory

[Solo: Oliver Lohmann]

Here I stand lonely with my life
Nothing lasts for eternity
I'm betraying myself, I'm deceiving myself
How much longer can I lie to me ?

[Refrain:]
All these years have passed - for all the undone things I grieve
All these years have passed me by - who am I ? what did I achieve ?

Now here I stand amongst my wasted opportunities
All my sacrifice was in vain
If I look at this face in the mirror now
I don't know this man - I feel ashamed

[Refrain:]
All these years have passed ' for all the undone things I grieve
All these years have passed me by ' who am I ? what did I achieve ?
Who am I ? what did I achieve ?

Oh, what if I could turn back the time

[Solo: Oliver Lohmann]

[Refrain:]
All these years have passed - for all the undone things I grieve
All these years have passed me by - who am I ? what did I achieve ?
All these years have passed - for all the undone things I grieve
All these years have passed me by - who am I ? what did I achieve ?
Who am I ? what did I achieve ? who am I ? what did I achieve ?
