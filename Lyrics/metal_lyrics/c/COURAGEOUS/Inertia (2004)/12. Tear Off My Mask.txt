[Lohmann / Staubach]

Take a look beyond imagination
Enter my world, you're welcome
Take the time, analyze me
The game has just begun - start diggin'

Take your breath, pouring from my soul
Yeah, turn my inside out
Take a piece of my depraved heart
Keep my love and pain spellbound - take delight in

[Bridge:]
Come on, face the truth, follow me if you dare

[Refrain:]
Tear off my mask - will there be a devil playing God?
Tear off my mask - will there be a God ... ?

Take a ride for my soul-strip
Crush through me, skin me alive
Take me now, stop kiddin' around
Gates are open, will you survive? - give you hell

[Bridge:]
Come on, face the truth, follow me if you dare

[Refrain:]
Tear off my mask - will there be a devil playing God?
Tear off my mask - will there be a God ... ?
Tear off my mask - will there be a devil playing God?
Tear off my mask - will there be a God ... ?

Watch out
What you've begun you shall to complete
No more time to turn aside, you've awaken the beast !

Demonic
Are you prepared for the truth?
I'll kiss your tears away while I infect you
Receive the gift
My virus - running through your veins
You will get what you deserve - release in pain !
