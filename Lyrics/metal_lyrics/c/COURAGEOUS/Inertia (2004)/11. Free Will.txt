[Lohmann / Staubach]

Day of birth
Did you choose your part in the arena of life?
Born into rules - is there any choice at all ?

Reglementation - education
The plague of humanity
Take my decisions - revolution
The lie of reality

[Refrain:]
Free will - the trigger of society's threat
Refuse their control - free will - the only thing you never had

Hours of death
Darkness fills your eyes with grievous regret
You recognize: your freedom was an illusion

Decency - morality
Restraining all you meant to be
Dehumanize - no more compromise
Feed your instincts to set your mind ...

[Refrain:]
Free will - the trigger of society's threat
Free will - the only thing you never had

[Solo: Oliver Lohmann / Gerd LÃ¼cking]

Reglementation - education
The plague of humanity
Take my decisions - revolution
The lie of reality

[Refrain:]
Free will - the trigger of society's threat
Refuse their control - free will - the only thing you never had
Free will - the trigger of society's threat
Refuse their control - free will - the only thing you never had
