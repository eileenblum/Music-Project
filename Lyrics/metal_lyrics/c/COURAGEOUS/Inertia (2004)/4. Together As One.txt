[Mischon / Staubach]

If one of us should die to keep us alive
I'm not afraid to leave
My spirit remains, we share this sacrifice
You're a part of my fate

[Refrain:]
Together as one, different minds
A merger by separation

Always dreamt to set us free
For one of us this dream comes true
Can I deal with death which makes me survive ?
Forever still in you

[Refrain:]
Together as one, different minds
A merger by separation
Together as one, different souls
A merger by separation

We have been torn apart
Together as one
When I close my eyes, I see myself in you
Always remember we shall meet at the end of the circle

[Solo: Gerd LÃ¼cking / Oliver Lohmann]

[Refrain:]
Together as one, different minds
A merger by separation
Together as one, different souls
A merger by separation
