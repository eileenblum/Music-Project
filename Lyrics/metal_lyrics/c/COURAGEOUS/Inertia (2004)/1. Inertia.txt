[LÃ¼cking / Lohmann / Staubach]

Hollow pain
Cutting straight in my flesh
Something's diggin' it's way through me

Silent scream
Waiting to be torn apart
A nightmare becomes reality

Defenceless at the mercy of the Gods in white
Trusting blind, 'cause I fear the black demon inside

[Refrain:]
Inertia - who's gonna let me fall asleep?
Inertia - who's gonna bring me back to life?

I cannot move
Congealed in liquid fear
To be damned in suffering

Inertia
Embraced by solitude
And betrayed by the living

Helpless - awake in darkness - does really nobody care ?
I feel so insecure, this is more than I can bear

[Refrain:]
Inertia - who's gonna let me fall asleep?
Inertia - who's gonna bring me back to life?
Inertia - who's gonna let me fall asleep?
Inertia - who's gonna bring me back to life?

Please, let me fall asleep
And bring me back to life
Drifting awake - will I be purified ?
Drifting away on a dark velvet stream
Will you hold me tight ?

[Solo: Gerd LÃ¼cking]

[Refrain:]
Inertia - who's gonna let me fall asleep?
Inertia - who's gonna bring me back to life?
Inertia - who's gonna let me fall asleep?
Inertia - who's gonna bring me back to life?

I'm dying inside out
