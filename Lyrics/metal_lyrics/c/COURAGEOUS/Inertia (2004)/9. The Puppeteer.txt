[Lohmann / Staubach]

Hey you, superstar - welcome to the world of lies
Deprived of human rights until you die

I'm the one who let you breathe, who let you suffocate
Now I'm your only friend, the master of your fate
When you think nobody cares, I will be there
Big Brother's watching you everytime and everywhere

[Refrain:]
The puppeteer designs your world, brings life to you
The puppeteer ever creates the truth

Are you ready for a rodeo through human tragedies?
A daily race for the ultimate headline
No remorse at humanity
Enjoy your life on sunny side, I'll bring back the rain
I can wait, my time will come, your downfall is my fame

[Refrain:]
The puppeteer designs your world, brings life to you
The puppeteer ever creates the truth
The puppeteer designs your world, brings life to you
The puppeteer ever creates the truth

Why are you here ? what do you want ?
Who has admitted you into my world ?
Don't come any closer, you're not invited
Get out of my life - just leave me alone
I'm beyond your power!

[Solo: Gerd LÃ¼cking / Oliver Lohmann / Gerd LÃ¼cking / Oliver Lohmann]

I'm the one who makes you rise and who makes you fall
You're my puppet, nothing but daddy's little dancer
Hey you, superstar - you always belong to me, I am your maker!

[Refrain:]
The puppeteer designs your world, brings life to you
The puppeteer ever creates the truth
The puppeteer designs your world, brings life to you
The puppeteer ever creates the truth

The puppeteer - the puppeteer ever creates your truth
The puppeteer designs your world, brings life to you
