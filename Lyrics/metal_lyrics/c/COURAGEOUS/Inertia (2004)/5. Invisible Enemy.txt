[Lohmann / Staubach]

The scent of death is haunting me
Swallowed up from the inside
Invisible enemy - parasite

Blinded by paranoia, nutriment for the disease
Nobody's save, there are no guarantees !

[Bridge:]
Why can't I hear myself screaming in silence ?
I listen to me, try to understand myself but I can't hear the answer

[Refrain:]
Oh, I fear the unknown, fear what I can't see
Oh, I fear the invisible enemy

Sinister ghosts are whispering, dying in great pain
Black death of the 20th century, I'm drivin' insane

[Bridge:]
Why can't I hear myself screaming in silence ?
I listen to me, try to understand myself but I can't hear the answer

[Refrain:]
Oh, I fear the unknown, fear what I can't see
Oh, I fear the invisible enemy
Oh, I fear the unknown, fear what I can't see
Oh, I fear the invisible enemy

Oh - why can't I be silent to hear what I've to tell me ?

[Solo: Oliver Lohmann]

[Refrain:]
Oh, I fear the unknown, fear what I can't see
Oh, I fear the invisible enemy
Oh, I fear the unknown, fear what I can't see
Oh, I fear the invisible enemy

Invisible enemy
Invisible - invincible
