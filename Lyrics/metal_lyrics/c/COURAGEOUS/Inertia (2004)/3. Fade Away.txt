[Lohmann / Mischon / Staubach]

How much more pain do I have to suffer ?
How many more prayers do I have to speak ?
How much more pain do I have to suffer, before you'll release me ?

[Bridge:]
Feel the shades - shades of my hope slippering through my hands, it slowly dies
Feel the shades - shades of my dreams in my arms and I couldn't avert
It vanished like an hour-glass

[Refrain:]
These are the days that I die - and I just fade away
All of my dreams swept aside - and I just fade away - again

How many more times do I have to die ?
How many more times must I drown myself ?
How many more times do I have to die, before I can live again ??

[Bridge:]
Feel the shades - shades of my hope slippering through my hands, it slowly dies
Feel the shades - shades of my dreams in my arms and I couldn't avert
It vanished like an hour-glass

[Refrain:]
These are the days that I die - and I just fade away
All of my dreams swept aside - and I just fade away

[Solo: Oliver Lohmann]

Shades of my dreams - It slowly dies - It vanished like an hour-glass
Feel the shades

[Refrain:]
These are the days that I die - and I just fade away
All of my dreams swept aside - and I just fade away
These are the days that I die - and I just fade away
All of my dreams swept aside - and I just fade away again
