[Lohmann / LÃ¼cking / Staubach / Mischon]

Do not press me, don't judge about the way I've gone
Do not decide about my life - ha ha
It's me - possessed by the demon, welcome to schizophrenia
Black cat on my shoulder, I'm gripped in paranoia

Do not push me, don't moan about the things I've done
Do not damage my strength
Walking on a thin line, one step closer to insanity
No remorse and no regret, who ever cared about me ?

[Bridge:]
Hell - I'm gonna see ya in - hell - I'm gonna see ya
I've never been a part of your world

[Refrain:]
I want nothing but my freedom - the ghosts I've summoned are haunting me
Want nothing but my freedom - the ghosts I've summoned are chaining me

Do not moralize, don't slave my independence
Do not try to control me
The serpent took my innocence, banished me under it's spell
Flying higher - stronger than ever, breaking limits, trespass to

[Bridge:]
Hell - I'm gonna see ya in - hell - I'm gonna see ya
I've never been a part of your world

[Refrain:]
I want nothing but my freedom - the ghosts I've summoned are haunting me
Want nothing but my freedom - the ghosts I've summoned are tempting me
Captured in the spiral to oblivion

Once I rode the demon, now the demon rides me
And I see his face in mine

[Solo: Gerd LÃ¼cking]

[Refrain:]
Want nothing but my freedom - the ghosts I've summoned are haunting me
Want nothing but my freedom - the ghosts I've summoned are chaining me
I want nothing but my freedom - the ghosts I've summoned are haunting me
I want nothing but my freedom - the ghosts I've summoned are tempting me
They are killing me ...
