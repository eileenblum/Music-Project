the lions are dancing
and the crowd continues clapping
on your seat
just enjoy the show
lean back and watch these puppets dance

open these mouths
because you're fucking caught
open these mouths
because we're fucking sick
I'm not a slave
to your fucking will

open these mouths
because you're fucking caught

watch them as they rule our lives
see, see the signs
I can't sleep I'm way too scared
watch them just watch them

save our flesh from their fangs

we are their tools
we are their fools
we are their hands
we are the fools

I'm not a slave to your fucking will

watch them as they rule our lives
see, see the signs

reunite and let their kingdom fall
get up wake up
and make yourself a voice
