reconceive your fucking self
how long will we be able 
to retain the earth we live on
will we ever overcome our selfish manners
as if neglecting mother earth was the worst of it
but we are baiting for approval
for our self esteem to subsist on it

we are going down
like a stone in the sea
sinking deeper to a confining dark

reconceive yourself
since we're sinking in the same ship

earth, 
did you plan us to be like this?
how could you plan us to be like this?

we are going down 
like a stone in the sea
sinking deeper to a confining dark

take time and seat
ladies and gentlemen
this is the twenty first century plague
we were a part of it

and I can't except myself
earth, did you plan us to be like this?
how could you plan us to be like this?
