then it felt alright
and we never caught a solid stand
we sheathed our words with gold
for the tears to wash them off
for the sheets to wipe them off

and while you're lying on your back
no truth would ever hurt you
so lock the doors

I believe we are running in circles
I believe we are chasing the same tails
so I'll step forward and make you suck this
so I'll step forward and bring you on your knees

thats not how you met me
but how you should miss me

I believe we are running in circles
I believe we are chasing the same tails
so I'll step forward and make you suck this
so I'll step forward and bring you on your knees

home is where the tart dies
