Solitude is wisdom infinite immortality pride can't be a factor I don't believe in destiny we always choose our leaders a true democracy but money is their idol I can't believe this blasphemy damnation of the nation fall from God elimination damnation of a nation far from God elimination your life's a tragedy your soul a fallacy and when this life is through there's no reward for you in your conversations God is left out seems we never worry what life is about what about in God we trust has that nation gone to waste we lowered the standard and turned our back making a mockery of this place we need to stand together and fight in spiritual warfare and bring God back to the united states
