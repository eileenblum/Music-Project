Stone cold in the grave six feet under in your little cave death you thought was the only answer then life forgot and hell begun lost alone in the place grasping for something trying to keep face your head is above the water only to give your suffocating dying to live wanted to die but always denied never believe in being set free you decided which way you would go now death begins finally you're there and life is gone the tour was short and now it's done you had the chance to turn it around now your wasted away under ground remorse and regret of wasted times spent when out of control a puppet to the master of your soul to blind to see in hell you dwell dying to live
