I can not understand why this is happening to me I can't understand all going through pains I can't understand I just want to be free my soul is confused by these troubles of life dear God why is this happening to me I question my life and the way that I live am I no good enough for you why must I go through these things are your holy words not true for your thoughts are not my thoughts neither are your ways my ways I am the truth and the life cast your cares on me if I watch over the birds and care when they fall how much more will I relieve your strife just like Job in the days of old great troubles have come my way but just like him you will deliver me and make the path way straight so if I lean on you in times of doubt and know that you are there walking with me when I need you the most you ease my despair
