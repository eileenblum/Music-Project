look into the sullen need, and see the castle. Forboding as time and the night which draws it. The shadowy reek of sorcerers and witches, screaming at why they're just a reek.
Hearken to the window they beckon, come with us.
Like a cowardic caress, the day fumbles for the rain and the night triumphant, recites forth like wolfsbane. Pretentious look at what's far between, and the dog which should not be.
The stormy caress of doom hanging from the sky, bleeds over branches clawing to the secret....and the goddess full glares through. In the ecstasy of fire and blood, they ride, a red crown of horns their only dress. Whispers and wanting, higher and laughter raging through
the lunar breathe. And they all know....
The darkness and the portal clouds speaking of lands far away and not long ago. This sigh, this witches night, this iron fence creaking in delight, a reminder so longing. Run in archaic incantations, and let this dark kiss of the horned one, flow like a river into Hades.
Flowing in orgasmic fire...
The velvet cape and the hooded gaze, a tender invitation to the priestess ride. And they cackle in this warmth, cackle in this fire and you...
and you crying at the new-found beauty of the night.
Pretentious look at what's far between, and the dog which should not be.
The stormy caress of doom hanging from the sky, bleeds over branches clawing to the secret....
