perpetual dancer
lost in the streams
of innocent violation
and the time denotes only a chaos
of certainty.
perpetual dancer
let me wreathe this braided flesh
upon your head
and love you in the mirror
for time says that this can go on
forever...
perpetual dancer
exclude me from your last dance
for time knows nothing
the illusion of certainty.
perpetual dancer
beautiful as the dark winds
frustrating as sporn
divine as the night
...love me you might.
