A breath of darkness
an existence painted in thriving red
a crown of ivy
and she danced...
the branches trying to catch her
with desirous, clawing dead love
and she tranced...
morbid tales fill her sarcophagus
...midnight...

a timeless crown on the neverworld duchess
dancing she comes to the storm
slithering from the dark of her soul
to the night of the day
bleeding in games
for tomorrow they come to drown her
too long has she had this reign
and the dukes all present their gallant hands
for this, the last drain
a white bedroom lost in thought
of the serpents entwined in yesterdays labyrinth
a semen spell in the cauldron red
starts to bleed a new game
for tomorrow they come to bound her
but this they have always done
and she laughs at their gallant mucus hands
for their night never comes
a white bedroom lost in thought
of the serpents entwined in yesterdays labyrinth
a semen spell in cauldron red
starts to bleed a new game
starts to bleed...
