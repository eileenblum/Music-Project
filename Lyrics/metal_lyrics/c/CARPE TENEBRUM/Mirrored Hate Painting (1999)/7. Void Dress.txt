And we reap on frathered ground 
the fallen where we walk 
knowledge secrets, smirking mirrors 
as they lurk where 
we've always thought 

Drying ice in the land of gliding 
ziggurats erected from writing 
not written 
time brgotten where time was seen 
and they all use their canes 

I dress in night 
ans see the difference 
I call the blue to spark with me 
Absu porning over my shadows 
lies await in ecstasy.
