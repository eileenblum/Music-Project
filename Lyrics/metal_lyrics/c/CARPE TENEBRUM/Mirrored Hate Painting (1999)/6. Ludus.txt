Dreaming chaos screaming weeping 
love this enemy, call my name 
run this nightmare, freezing horizon 
watchers and dancers playing the game 

Here lies the heresy 
and pillars we know 
fantasy drying the ones down below 
wiping the dust of the crystal delay 
and the reapers keep sighing, scrying in their will 

Tying the serpent, while the ivy crowns 
dissonance, resonance 
the witchers so proud 
coming for endless as the dimension 
shimmers 
dancing and seeing 
the blinds failing whiter 

Constant and strong 
the desert so coure 
the cats masturbating 
with the goddess wrought 
love me, love me 
draw me a picture 
dancing for ever like poison 
elixir.
