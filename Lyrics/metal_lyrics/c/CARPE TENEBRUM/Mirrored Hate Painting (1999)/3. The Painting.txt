And the dream, the dream shatters 
you can't run from me anymore 
I've loved you with forever 
as I saw you at the door. 

And she screams as he tells her who she is 
reaps at the void she never touched 
knowing the creature writhes away 
while the lust for the strains. 

And he screams at you hurting his pain 
remember the void touch his knife (they tell her) 
touch his pain this hurt to familiar... 

The drain realms suffocate 
the power generates the look sees beyond 
and you want to touch his painting his painting... 
but the liquid is poison the poison 
poisonous as the mirror you saw before 
and confusion and the self rising 

-the confusion- 
like a dark, winged reaper 
that you knew it all before 
that you love in the dark 
that you 
-and- 
the look sees beyond 
-and-
