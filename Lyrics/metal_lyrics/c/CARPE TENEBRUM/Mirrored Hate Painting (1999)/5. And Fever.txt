And she leaves you, sees you, weeping as you 
thought you saw the storm, callous colours of drawings 
without seeing in, the negativity a lie and the all 
deluded moonlight prescribed screaming abyss that 
mocks you until you don't know, while catagons 
breed serpents and the sigils weep into snakes and 
the tyrant lost of the suns gaze seems to kneel 
in a sand that they took away, only seeing what you 
are not too afraid to because it's all a nothing, a 
dreamscape void with wings and flight and he's following, 
they're mocking, he's following, run and screaming through 
as the temperament of linear dredging spirits itself to the 
flat our face of actually haunting a dimension, and we 
won't die, pain she said, and we won't die, cruel she said 
and we won't die 

and forever.
