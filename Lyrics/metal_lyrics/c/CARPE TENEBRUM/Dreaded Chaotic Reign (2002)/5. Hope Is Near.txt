Burning across the plains
Always before, riding for the sea
Abzu we call
Satan there's a way a way for us all
We fight today, natures call - revive

Revive the sea for not we are born
We shall be free, our service moulds
We betrayed our ways
The ways for us all
Seeing across the seas - we shall have all
Waiting for the day - the day they fall
We will be free - Satan have all

The sun in our skies
Pegazuz rise
The dark of our mind

We - we ride our name in fear
For we have our own domain
We lead our lives astray
Until we have been obeyed
