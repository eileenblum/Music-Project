We will, we will not be found
Sacred, sacred is our holy ground
Rebirth, we fight for the right
The right for our fate is bringing war
The order of strength we light the fire
The fire in our brains
Our order is sweet and so we have the thrown
Building our means forever

In our self we have to fight
The fight for our face
Our face in the sky
Prophets are born and people shall die
Gripping with fear at the face in the sky

Truth now behold, behold for a war
Of a war in our fear, our fear to conform
