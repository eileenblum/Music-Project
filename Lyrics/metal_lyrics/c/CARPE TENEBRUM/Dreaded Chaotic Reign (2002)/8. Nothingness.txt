We see the light we see
We see the light that's taken away
Darkness we feel - we feel the dark
That paves our way
Nothingness we feel
Nothing that you feel
Will be for you
Reverence away
Away for ourselves to be in pain

The serpent on brains is the other side
What we hope to be, the others only lie
Stalking our own brains to see what we find
Is there any room behind our minds?

Believe in what we see, can only come in time
Waiting for the ones to see if we can hide
Sorting through the truths around our eyes
We can only see our minds
