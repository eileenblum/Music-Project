OH

ARGH
RESURRECTION

Crimson falls,
Never been away, here to stay.
We've been crawling through the gutters, the band, me.

But we told you before, guess again motherfucker
We are never giving in, so let's do this shit.

I hung my head, I hung my head for far too long.
I've been away, I've been away too long.
I had to pick myself up again.

Brick by brick, get myself back together.
Slowly, one step at a time, to become myself again.
So don't you fuckin' judge me none of you.

You don't know where I've been, what I've been through.
Too many tears I've cried for you to condemn me &amp; spit on my name.

I won't take it and I will never back down
.....
I won't back down
I, we stand our ground,
we stay true.

Crimson's back this is what we fuckin' do.

I won't back down
I, we stand our ground
we stay true.

Crimson's back this what we fuckin' do.

ARGH

I love my family, they were there when I was out.
They stood by me, my team stood strong when I was down.
They remembered, remembered what I'm all about.
They kept believing, thank you for saving my life.

[whispering:]
I'll strike back, I'll give it all I've got.
To get back, what you all took from me.
Pride, well-being &amp; self-respect.
What the fuck did you expect?
That I would just step out like that?
t,t,t,t,t,t

I STOOD THE TEST OF ME.
I AM STILL ALIVE

Never again will you use me you fucks,
nor profile into everything you're not.

I won't back down,
I, we, stand our ground.
we stay true.

Crimson's back, this is what we fuckin' do.

[Breakdown]

Blergh

[pig squeel]

The final word is on me.

FUCK. SHIT. UP.

Blergh

[whispering:]
I told you I'll never back down.
I told you I'll stand my ground.
