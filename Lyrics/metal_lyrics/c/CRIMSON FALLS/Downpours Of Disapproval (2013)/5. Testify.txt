today, I testify on what you do to me
today, I testify to get you out of me
testify on what you do to me
testify to get you out of me
today, I testify on what you do to me
today, I testify to get you out of me
I wake up every day
with the fear it won't go away
go to school &amp; be locked out
the mockery spit through you mouth
why is it so hard to see
what your laughter does to me
why
why can't you just let me go
just because I don't like music but history
antagonize &amp; provoke me
intimidating prophecies
you beat me up, steal my stuff
to feel better and oh so tough
Phone calls calling names
my mailbox full of hate
ridicule me on my wall
why is it you want to make me fall
I can't endure all this rage
you spread on my facebook-page
I'm sick of it, I've had enough
I can't take it, it has to stop
today, I testify on what you do to me
today, I testify to get you out of me
I wake up every day
with the fear it won't go away
go to school &amp; be locked out
the mockery spit through you mouth
why is it so hard to see
what your laughter does to me
why
why can't you just let me go
just because I don't like music but history
