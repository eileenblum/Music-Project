I've got some scores to settle
I've got some bills to pay
this is my vengeance
on those untrue &amp; fake
it's time I got even
it's time I spoke my mind
this is my anthem
for peace inside I need to find
I'll squeeze you out like the pus from an ulcer
whipe you away as if you've never existed
you should have known that I'd come back for you son
when you claim the crown my sweat and tears have won
when it's all eyes on me, I look you straight in the face
a swelled head up in the clouds, to me it's such a disgrace
when you bit the hand that feeds you, one day it will strike back
now the dogs are unleashed and you're under attack
I've got some scores to settle
I've got some bills to pay
this is my vengeance
on those untrue &amp; fake
it's time I got even
it's time I spoke my mind
this is my anthem
for peace inside I need to find
this is my vengeance
on those untrue &amp; false
this is my anthem
this is my vengeance
how did it ever come tis far?
times used to be different
it's all a matter of honesty and respect
too many times we went out without that
take advantage instead of responsibility
left me to clean up your mess
now that's what I did
so to the parasites, the ungrateful
the respectless, the arrogant
let's bring it on
this is my revenge
fuck you all
vengeance is mine
this mine
all mine
when it's all eyes on me, I look you straight in the face
a swelled head up in the clouds, to me it's such a disgrace
when you bit the hand that feeds you, one day it will strike back
now the dogs are unleashed and you're under attack
this is my revenge
fuck you all
vengeance is mine
