fallen from my pedestal
I'm no hero
hopeless, senseless, stillborn, in vain
only care about yourself
no respect for others
worthless, respectless, stillborn, in vain
why... all for nothing
every sign of life i saw was wrong
this body was dead right from the fucking start
all ou did was use me, you used me and abused me
and after you squeezed everything you could use out of me
you deprived me of all meaning
it was - it was infected
it was - it was false
everyone - everyone could see except for me
how could I be so wrong
everyone - everyone could see except for me
how could I be so wrong
why... tell me fuckin' why
you never cared
this body was dead right from the fucking start
all ou did was use me, you used me and abused me
and after you squeezed everything you could use out of me
you deprived me of all meaning
who or what gave you the right
to mess with my mind, to fuck with my life
for what? for nothing
you should have left me alone
you should have left me dead
the way it fuckin' was
no you can bury me twice
you'll see me rise trice
who or what gave you the right
to mess with my mind, to fuck with my life
for what? for nothing
stillborn - this body buried alive
stillborn - the burial took months of my life
stillborn - I was so fucking blind
stillborn - I couldn't get it out of my mind
stillborn
