every man for himself
trapped in this living hell
33 miners trapped 600 metres deep
embedded in darkness, under 35 degrees
abundant copper &amp; gold
but no air to breathe
abundant copper &amp; gold
but no air to breathe
no light to see
no space to move
no water to drink
oppressive head &amp; rich humidity
and just a few spoons of food a day
to survive between the rubble
trapped in the womb of the earth
fearing "we're going to die"
losing courage and the last spark of hope
death sentence to the miners
losing courage and the last spark of hope
14 days later
a piece of paper as a first sign of life
coming from the womb of the earth
screaming "we're still alive"
bringing joy to the soil of the earth
we dig until we get by
machines drilling the ground for weeks
to create a navel-string
the impossible
above ground. alive
was made impossible
the impossible
above ground. alive
how escape from insanity or the fear of starving to death
claustrophobic frustrations &amp; conflicts in the earth's depth
losing courage and the last spark of hope
every man for himself
trapped in this living hell
no space to escape from the human stench you smell
every man for himself
trapped in this living hell
