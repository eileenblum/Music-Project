A voicemail saying more than a Thousand words
I listened to it a Thousand times
it means nothing to this world
but it means the world to me
life does not go on
head in my heand, my knees on the floor
their last words echo in my head
I close my eyes while they keep  pounding
so hard I want to rip out my heart to make it go away
but there's already a hole in my chest
I've died with you, that same day
that morning showed the future
the evening only the past
that morning showed the future
the evening only the past
how much does life weigh
if it can be gone in a split second
is this all it's worth
21 grams is all we can reckon
how much does life weigh
if it can be gone in a split second
is this all it's worth
21 grams is all we can reckon
How much does life weigh
life does not just go on
a split second was all it took
everything's just gone
nothing's left
I've got nothing
so sudden
why, how, but
I can't understand
I'm just standing here
life does not go on
