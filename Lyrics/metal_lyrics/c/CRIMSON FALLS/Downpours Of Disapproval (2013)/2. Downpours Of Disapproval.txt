so many emotions to sever
when now hurts more, now more than ever
each song coming down on you
like a downpour
downpours of disapproval
pointing out the excesses of the human race
we already told you on the true face
aware of certain fragments whithin your mind
that can bring us to the ruins of mankind
all these emotions to sever
when now hurts more, more than ever
each song coming down on you
like a downpour
downpours of disapproval
every song speaks for itself
anger coming from different shelves
donwpours on what we hate
all this shit we won't take
what has hurt us in our past
excesses we don't want to last
me disapprove dishonesty
disagree on disparity
revolt against indignity
pointing out the excesses of the human race
we already told you on the true face
aware of certain fragments whithin your mind
that can bring us to the ruins of mankind
fragments, donwpours
so many emotions to sever
when now hurts more, now more than ever
each song coming down on you
like a downpour
downpours of disapproval
