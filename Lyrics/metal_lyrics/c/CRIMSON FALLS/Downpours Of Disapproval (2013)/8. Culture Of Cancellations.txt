damn sure... fuck yeah... check
I've seen all sides of the show
on stage, organising it &amp; siked in the pit
but what's the point of no one cares
if no one gives a shit
let me put it this way
10 shows booked, 7 got cancelled
that fuckin' pisses me off
I organise a show &amp; every confirmed band drops out
that fuckin' pisses me off
bands rippint the stage, crowds that stay out
that fucking pisses me off
a lack of respect &amp; no dedication
that fuckin' pisses me off
damn sure... fuck yeah...
respect &amp; dedication's what I'm talking  about
not just hollow words for  you to scream and shout
to prove your street cred &amp; show you're for real
do you know what these words mean. well here's the fucking deal
doing a show takes more than booking 20 bands
how about a venue, PA, promo, enough helping hands
deal with that first before you announce your names
so you don't have to cancel when you aint got what it takes
accepting the show means you'll fuckin' show up
except when your drummer's dead, then shit is fucked up
don't ask me for shows when you cancelled the one first
because conditions you ageed on didn't satisfy your thirst
support every band, not just the locals you know
every band in the scene wants you on front row
at least represent and show some respect
to hard-working bands with tight shit in their set
let me put it this way....
you're fuckin' ready?
bring it on
check... move up..
10 shows booked, 7 got cancelled
that fuckin' pisses me off
I organise a show &amp; every confirmed band drops out
that fuckin' pisses me off
bands rippin the stage, crowds that stay out
that fucking pisses me off
a lack of respect &amp; no dedication
that fuckin' pisses me off
damn sure... fuck yeah...
