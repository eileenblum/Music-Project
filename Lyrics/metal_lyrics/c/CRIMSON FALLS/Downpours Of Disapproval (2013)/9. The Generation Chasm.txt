so you're not leaving a penny
spend it all before you die
waste every single dime
while we struggle to pay your pension at SS
didn't you get enough
extraordinary economical times, job security all your lives
but cheap plots, bouild private homes, most of it of your incomes
payments by instalments, affordable through wage rises
retirements, successions, a sea of time, don't let this be Pearls for the swine
acquirements you take for granted, you gat everything you demanded
there's no hope for the better
to climb the social ladder
no room for improvement
for a safe financial future
with public debt as a millstone around our necks
the ground shoves away behind our backs
the gates are closed. the times have changed
opportunities disarranged
while you enjoy the fruit of your labour
nothing is certain for the doomed generation
you want it all, we just want the same
we want the same future
you want it all, we just want the same
se want the same fuckin' changes
you want it all, we just want the same
we want the same fuckin' future
to live our lives free and independent
so here's what we'll do
we'll make our own future
find our way, in our own times
so there's something left
we'll make our own future
it's all that matters from now
new times came
nothing is certain for this generation
we'll break these chains
the crumbles that are left leave a bad taste in my mouth
dismissals and a rise of prices 
all for real in an economical crisis
real estate too expensive
obsolence throws a grey shade on a dommed generation's fate
convicted to pay for the public debt, ecnomizing in full effect
24/7 for a minimum wage, all for real for the modern slave
while you enjoy the fruit of your labour nothing is certain for the doomed generation
