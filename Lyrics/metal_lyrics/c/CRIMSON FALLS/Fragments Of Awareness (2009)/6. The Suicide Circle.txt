(7 kids - 1 city - 7 ropes - 1 circle
âLogging in again
Usernameâ¦ passwordâ¦)
Meet my online friends who understand how I feel
That I donât want to go on, that I see no future
I want to join the circle, they say I should just do it
Theyâre the only ones that listen to me
Who understand meâ
Why lock yourself up, feeling this way
In a chat box where suicideâs praised as the highest goal
No one proposing alternatives or different options to escape
from the darkness in your mind
Because no one listens to you?
No one understands? No ones there? No one cares?
Still I tell you there are other solutions
Than committing suicide
You can escape, thereâs always a way out
Suicideâs never the solution, live your life
Suicideâs never the solution, live your life
Because no one listens to you?
No one understands?
Life can and will change for the better
Talking about your problems is right
Break through the suicide circle
Death is no solution, even online vowed
Turn around the suicide circle
Life holds too much to be stepping out
I believe it when you tell me that I donât know what itâs like
that I canât feel your pain or imagine what youâve been through
I believe it when you tell me that itâs lonely and dark
where your thoughts roam, your mind doesnât find sleep tonight
Why lock yourself up, feeling this way
In a chat box where suicideâs praised as the highest goal
No one proposing alternatives or different options to escape
from the darkness in your mind
Break through the suicide circle
Death is no solution, even online vowed
Turn around the suicide circle
Life holds too much to be stepping out
Break through the suicide circle
Life holds too much to be stepping out
You can escape, thereâs always a way out
Suicideâs never the solution, live your life
Live your life

Seven teenagers committed suicide in the same city in Wales in one year. All of
them were members of a chat group in which they shared their darkest thoughts,
their urge for death and their respect and admiration for those who actually
took the final step. Internet contains more of these online suicide pacts.
These websites arenât the direct cause, but they can be enough to convince
vulnerable youngsters, losing themselves in a one-way street of deceptions. But
you can escape, there are other options to turn your life around, there are
other solutions than suicide, no matter how big your problems are.
Organizations are ready to listen to you, to help you. Talking about your
problems is ok; itâs cool and it certainly is brave. Grab this hand reaching
out to you.
