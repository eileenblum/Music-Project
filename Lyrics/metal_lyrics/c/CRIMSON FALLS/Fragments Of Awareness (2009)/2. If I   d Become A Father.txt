If Iâd become a father my biggest fear would be
How to keep my son from coke and from XTC
How can I protect my daughter from a devil set at slaughter
coming home at night; a rapist assault with might
Itâs unjustified to throw them into this world
Where an Ipodâs price is a knife rolling your dice
Is this the kind of world I want to bring life to
Where respect for life is lost and weâd do anything for money
If Iâd become a father my biggest fear would be
How to keep my son from coke and from XTC
How can I protect my daughter from a devil set at slaughter
coming home at night; a rapist assault with might
If Iâd become a father my biggest fear would be
To loose my flesh and blood to earthâs lunacy
From birth âtill death in constant agony? - Lose your own blood in lunacy
Incarcerated in debauchery? - Lose your own blood in lunacy
Praying for days to your deity? - Lose your blood in lunacy
A miscreation in depravity? - Lose your own blood in lunacy
Will it be enough to raise them with love
Teach responsibility and form their own opinion
Will it be enough to raise them with love
Teach responsibility and form their own opinion

This song more or less speaks for itself. There are a lot of dangers
threatening children &amp; teenagers in these times. Drugs are available
everywhere, senseless violence is all around, rapists and child molesters keep
stealing innocence and money seems to be the codeword in this greedy society.
How can you protect your family from all of these abhorrent excesses? A
beautiful world to raise our childrenâ¦
