Dehumanized - forsaken - forlorn - gone forever
It seems like you died yesterday but you donât remember
Your body forsaken by its gifted mind
The person you were - forever gone
Dehumanized - forsaken - dehumanized
This tempest in your head
Took everything you ever were
And all whatâs left, is scattered far away
In a labyrinth of hide and seek
Leaving you behind, dehumanized
Your body forsaken by its gifted mind
The person you were - forever gone
Your body forsaken by its gifted mind
The person you were - forever gone
Dehumanized - Forsaken
Dehumanized - Forsaken
This tyrant severed your soul, it drained your mind
Your whole being grinded, your life faded to a twilight
This tyrant so vicious, this tyrant so vigorous
Leaving you behind, dehumanized
Your body forsaken by its gifted mind
The person you were - forever gone
Dehumanized - forsaken - forlorn - gone forever
This tempest, this tyrant, is taking you away
This is no way to say goodbye
I wish it was you I was looking at
Instead of your hollow, forsaken eyes
Iâm so confused - donât understand what youâre saying
Iâm so confused - still Iâm glad youâre here
Iâm so confused - donât understand what youâre saying
Iâm so confused - still Iâm glad youâre here
Dehumanized - forsaken - dehumanized

Alzheimerâs disease is the most common form of dementia among older people. It
affects the parts of the brain that control thought, memory and language. In
this way it gradually hinders the ability to carry out daily activities. Seeing
a parent or grandparent fade away is very confronting and hard to cope with.
Once a strong, intelligent human being, gifted with a lot of talents; caring,
loving, workingâ¦ Now just a body, a confused mind, forsaken eyesâ¦ This is no
way to say goodbyeâ¦ This song is dedicated to my grandmother; I miss you, rest
in piece, âForsakenâ is for you. More info: www.alzheimers.org and www.alz.org
