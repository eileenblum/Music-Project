Did you really think I would give up? That Iâd fuckinâ break?
Let all this shit get to me?
You fuckinâ treat me like shit, with complete disrespect
Nod and obey when Iâm on my knees?
Guess again motherfucker, Iâve got the knife between my teeth
Fight back, work harder and never accept defeat
Dedication, devotion, a stout resistance
Freedom, self-confidence
A promise to myself, a fury inside
Passion âtill it ends
A promise to myself, a fury inside
Passion âtill it ends
sworn persistence
Guess again motherfucker
You think you can lay guilt upon me? - Iâll kick back, ainât having that
You think Iâm fuckinâ arrogant? - Well fuck you too, think first, then act
You wanna play hide and seek? - Tough behind your screen, but in reality?
You think this is the end of me? - I ainât gonna stop, Iâm just getting started
Guess again motherfucker, Iâve got the knife between my teeth
Wonât stop, make it work and redeem your deceit
A promise to myself, a fury inside
Passion âtill it ends
A promise to myself, a fury inside
Passion âtill it ends
sworn persistence
Did you really think I would give up? That Iâd fuckinâ break?
Let all this shit get to me when our name is at stake?
You fuckinâ treat me like shit, with complete disrespect
Nod and obey when Iâm on my knees?

Musically and lyrically this song and âWith All Due Respectâ can be considered
as twin brothers; like we had âAbort Every Weakness/Erase All Fearâ &amp; âIn
Flanders Fields/We Are The Deadâ on the previous album. As said in the previous
song, when going for your goals &amp; following your dreams not everything always
goes according to plan. But you just canât let set-backs and shit-talkers get
you down. Talking shit and spreading lies isnât only easy; itâs worthless as
well. Stand up and do something yourself! Anyway, itâs a clichÃ© but âwhat
doesnât kill you, makes you strongerâ, so with the knife between our teeth
weâll keep this show on the road for as long as we want to.
