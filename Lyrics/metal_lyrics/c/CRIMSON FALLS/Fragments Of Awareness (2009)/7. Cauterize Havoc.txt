Stab harder - twist the blade as you stab in my flesh
Hit harder - break my skull, kick my brains out
Heâs been mocked for far too long
At school hassled day in, day out
Today is the day to end this fuckinâ shit
A festering plan seeded in his mind
Firing his weapon, heâs seen how itâs done
The laughter silenced by the barrel of a gun
Sign of the times, senseless violence
Boundless aggression, pure fuckinâ hatred
Out of racism or mental derangement
Repulsive bloodshed, consumed by lunacy
No one asked for this
These atrocities, solutions at deadlock
No one asked for this
Where to start to cauterize havoc
Sign of the times, senseless violence
Boundless aggression, pure fuckinâ hatred
Out of racism or mental derangement
Repulsive bloodshed, consumed by lunacy
Stab harder - twist the blade as you stab in my flesh
Hit harder - break my skull, kick my brains out
No one asked for this
These atrocities, solutions at deadlock
No one asked for this
Where to start to cauterize havoc
Once a happy family
A beautiful wife, two kids, a garden with a tree
Now the wife blood-soaked, left dying in her seat
Suffocating the kids, theyâre fallen prey to eternal sleep
He couldnât fuckinâ take it, there was no way to accept
You leave me behind? Itâs like leaving me deadâ¦

Senseless violence is all around nowadays. In Belgium we had the case of
teenager killing two persons in the streets of Antwerp. One morning he left
school early, cut his hair, wore a long black coat and bought a rifle. Like a
character out of a computer game he started marching through the center of
Antwerp, killing a baby and its nanny who were just walking by through the
streets. A third victim survived his attack. Luckily an alert policeman
prevented him from taking more lives in his rage by shooting him in the leg.
There are a lot of other examples of senseless violence. Each year newspapers
have to report on family tragedies for instance. Or just think about the attack
on a kindergarten in Dendermonde in January 2009 in which two babies and a
nurse were murdered. Telling you about these sad events isnât that hard, coming
up with the causes for these things to happen and, even more important, with
solutions to stop all of this is unfortunately a lot harderâ¦
