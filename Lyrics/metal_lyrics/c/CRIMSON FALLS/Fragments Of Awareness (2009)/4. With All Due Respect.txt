With all due respect - go fuck yourself
With all due respect - time to step back
With all due respect - go fuck yourself
With all due respect - time to step back

If you want to know the lyrics to this one, youâll have to listen up closely. I
donât find it necessary to print them all here. Letâs just say that during the
years we are around with Crimson Falls we had the misfortune to meet some
backstabbers, hypocrites, incapable people, liars and people who tell a lot of
nice stories but never back them up. Luckily this is a minority that canât
spoil the fun we have on shows and the nice contacts we have there with a lot
of cool people. But still; I needed to get this of my chest; fuck you, haha!
