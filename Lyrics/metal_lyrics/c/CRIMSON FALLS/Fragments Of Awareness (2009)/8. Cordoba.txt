The peace Utopia
A clash of cultures in the city of peace
Perfect harmony for three centuries
The peace Utopia - Welcome to Cordoba
The peace Utopia - Enjoy your stay in Cordoba
See them all coming to town
Jews, Muslims &amp; Christians
Great minds and artists
Scientists, historians and philosophers
A gathering of knowledge
In the oasis of tolerance
Alliance of the enlightened
In the shade of the Mezquita
A clash of cultures in the city of peace
Perfect harmony for three centuries
The peace Utopia - Welcome to Cordoba
The peace Utopia - Enjoy your stay in Cordoba
Different convictions
But living in peace
The ultimate incarnation
of a multicultural society
Coexistence of different nations
Cultures in balance, religions at ease
Naive, impossible and unrealistic?
Too many contemporary social obstructions?
Yeah, ok, letâs wrap up the plans and load our guns
Iâll kill your mother; you kill my son
The way it has been since the birth of man
Mutual hatred eradicates peace
The peace Utopia
A clash of cultures in the city of peace
Perfect harmony for three centuries
The peace Utopia - Welcome to Cordoba
The peace Utopia - Enjoy your stay in Cordoba
But still, utter utopian?
Welcome to Cordobaâ¦

The city of Cordoba in Southern Spain proved centuries ago that it is possible
for different beliefs to live in peace. That a clash of cultures doesnât
necessarily have to mean war. That different nations can live together in a
spirit of tolerance. Cordoba is the city of tolerance, the melting pot of
cultures. Muslims, Jews &amp; Christians lived here together in harmony for a long
period. The remnants are visible in the city where the old Jewish quarter (the
juderia) surrounds the big mosque, the Mezquita, which was first a Roman temple
and later also a basilica. It canât be forgotten though that severe laws
attended this tolerance. Inhabitants had to pay taxes for instance to be
allowed to practice their religion. The city flourished in the 10^th century,
its fall was caused by quarrels between different emirs who ruled the city.
