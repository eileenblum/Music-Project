All of this, all there is, this is my regenesis
All of this, all there is, this is my regenesis
Iâm not gonna sit here waiting with my feet lying up in the air
âcause shit will ever happen, sitting brain-dead on my ass
Iâm gonna do it myself, take my life in my hands
Push as far as I can and fight for every chance
All of this, all there is, this is my regenesis
I didnât get nothing for nothing, worked off my ass for all Iâve got
Gave blood, sweat and tears, with full support of my true peers
So donât you come to me saying I didnât deserve it
When you just donât know shit about how I fuckinâ earned it
Where the fuck were you when I spent every single second
Giving all I have and trying to make it happen
All of this, all there is, this is my regenesis
Out of anger, revenge for redemption
Out of anger, revenge for redemption
All of this, all there is, this is my regenesis
So donât you come to me saying I didnât deserve it
When you just donât know shit about how I fuckinâ earned it
With pride I stand
Gratitudeâ¦Prideâ¦Respectâ¦
With pride I stand
All of this, all there is, this is my regenesis
All of this, all there is, this is my regenesis

We told you before and weâll tell you again: you have the power to make
something out of your life and do what you want to do and what makes you happy.
Even when youâre down and out you can find your regenesis. We want to dedicate
this song to everyone supporting Crimson Falls from the beginning and over the
past years; our fans, friends and all the cool people in other bands we met
along the road. Without you Crimson Falls wouldnât be shit, so thank you for
the support, for buying our cdâs &amp; merch and most of all for coming out at
shows and making it a party together with us. Respect and see you all soon!
