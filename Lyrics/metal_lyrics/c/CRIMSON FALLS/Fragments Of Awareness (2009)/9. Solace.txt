Still so many plans
So many expectations
So much things to share
Spring was already in the air
And the green grass to play on
Together

Solace

Death is so hard to take
All our dreams, gone with the wind
A broken life, a bruised future
Only sorrow and questions remain
Words donât matter anymore
Just the silence
And the memories of beautiful days
Bring it all back to life

Solace

Pray for the strength to carry the pain
Open your hands looking for peace
Carry our love
And us who remain

Solace

Deathâ¦ choose for deathâ¦ a dark and cold thoughtâ¦ Our life as a family must
have stood stillâ¦ you were goneâ¦ you choose to take another path, a path we
couldnât follow. A path that feels dark and chill, the path of death. Death was
your choiceâ¦
A choice that keeps us questioningâ¦ Why? Youâll never be able to answer usâ¦ For
a long period I struggled with these questions, I changed, saw myself as an
incomplete personâ¦ But growing older helps me to reconcile with the deed you
did. Deep inside I know that you, in your eyes, back then, choose âthe best
solutionâ for yourself and our familyâ¦ Thatâs why there are moments I can let
you and the past goâ¦
Thinking about how it could have been from time to timeâ¦ but also being happy
with my life now and letting you go a littleâ¦ Like you chose yourself to goâ¦
