Tornadoes and typhoons raging across the land
Hurricanes devastating homes and futures
Ice caps melt down, glaciers retreat
In advancing deserts, too much mouths to feed
This is a period of consequences
By a natural cycle or at manâs expenses?
Shortage of water suffocates the south
While melting ice reaches northern mouths
Tropical diseases rise up faster than cures
Giant swarms of insects, more than agriculture endures
Ecological imbalance through global warming
Through excess in discharge of COÂ²?
Did we make the wrong assumptions and welter in disinterest?
After the era of indifference, now a period of consequences?
Another period of consequences
Have we been digging our own grave, rotting corpses warming the earth
Time for a change has past, too late to turn back time
Have we been digging our own grave, rotting corpses warming the earth
Time for a change has past, too late to turn back time
This is a period of consequences
By a natural cycle or at manâs expenses?
Ecological imbalance through global warming
Through excess in discharge of COÂ²?
Did we make the wrong assumptions and welter in disinterest?
After the era of indifference, now a period of consequences?

Numerous scientific data leave no doubt. Though there are still insecurities,
itâs an irrefutable fact that our climate is heating faster than we could
expect based on a natural evolution. So is Al Gore right after all? Letâs not
forget the Gore family hasnât always been right &amp; missed the (headbangerâs)
ball more than once in the past. Wasnât it Misses Tipper Gore who claimed metal
music was the root of all evil in the world? That metal-bands set up youngsters
to sell their soul to the devil by hidden messages in their music? Luckily we
all know by now that METAL IS THE LAW!
Now go dance with the devil!
