A spirit awoken, A truth has been found
Feasting in trust, leaving the blinded behind
A defined path, A secured goal
Yearning to thrive, I leave no stone unturned
Abort every weakness, erase all fear
All I want, I will achieve
There's no more option, now choose to bow
No is my answer, no numbing soul
Abort every weakness, erase all fear
All I want, I will achieve
My work of art I will complete
An unconquerable will seethes in my veins
I'm the strength upon my faith
My work of art I will complete
An unconquerable will seethes in my veins
I'm the strengt upon my faith
Abort every weakness, erase all fear
All I want, I will achieve
