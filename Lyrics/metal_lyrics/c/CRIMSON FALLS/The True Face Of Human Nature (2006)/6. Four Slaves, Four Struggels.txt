Burst the capture ...
Awakening slave - enlightened
Sunrise cracked the stones
Foreshadowing the inner burning
Emerge from the marble
Young slave - burdened
Every step feels like a mile
Your conquest's worth the pain
Emerge from the marble 
Four slaves, four struggles
From marble to gold
Four statues left unfinished,
Their passion unfolds
Four slaves, four struggles from marble to gold
Four steps to take with a conviction untold
Atlas - Doubting - Each thought's a massive weight 
Kill the questions that pound in your head
Foreshadowing the inner burning
Emerge from the marble
Bearded slave - liberated
Strongest of them all
Though pain and doubt leave scars
You emerged from the marble
Four slaves, four struggles
From marble to gold
Four statues left unfinished, their passion unfolds
Four slaves, four struggles from marble to gold
Four steps to take with a conviction untold
