A salute to the fallen
100.000 men with no known grave
50.000 names honoured
By remembrance crosses
At the menin gate
The gateway to hell, marching
Off to never return
Suffering ... sacrifice ...
Carried by courage and devotion
A few days ago we lived
Now we are ...
The Dead
For freedom ... for their independence
At the going down of the sun,
We will remember them
Deprived of their youth,
They saw their lives perish
A sacrifice made, the outcome we cherish
In flanders field, poppies growing
Among the graves
A symbol of rememberance for those
Who died to restore peace
A few days ago we lived
Now we are ...
The Dead
Deprived of their youth,
They saw their lives perish
A sacrifice made,
The outcome we cherish
