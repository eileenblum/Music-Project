The horror displayed our computer screens
The sickness that scatters on the 7 pm news
Is this our true face, is this all we can be?
No way to deny it's proper to man
A sick grin that smiles back at you
Are you...
Aiming for structure in the complex behavior
The ambiguity, the true face of human nature
Or is this our true face; is there more we can be?
No way to deny it's proper to man
A sweet smile that glances back at you
Aiming for structure in the complex behavior
The ambiguity, the true face of human nature
The horror displayed our computer screens
The sickness that scatters on the 7 pm news
Lunatic minds, out of touch with reality
Slaves to the rhythm of a sick society
If you kill a man, I'll be the charity fundraiser
And if it's me who snaps,
We'll change our role pattern baby
But still there is more, there's the lust for life
A positive attitude instead of our daily strife
Going for more, not going for broke
Choosing to live instead of waiting to choke
So is that our true face, the 'all' we can be?
No way to deny it's proper to man
The sick, the sweet, the smile, the grin
Are you...
Aiming for structure in the complex behavior
The ambiguity, the true face of human nature
Swinging from black to white,
Obstructing their own savior
The 'heaven vs. hell' apparent in mankind's ways
Shows the ambiguity, the true face of human nature
