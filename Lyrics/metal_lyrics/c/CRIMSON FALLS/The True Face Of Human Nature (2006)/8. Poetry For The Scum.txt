Infuriated, inflamed,
Rage grows with every word
I'll tell you one thing,
This is not the last you've heard
Retribution, retaliation,
These words do sound so fine
But revenge is the sweetest
In this dictionary of mine
Infertile bitch, viper's tongue spreading lies
Cut by the scissors that you call truth
You're a parasite, feeding on others
Sucking the blood to fulfil your pathetic needs
Fuck all your lies
I'll remember every word
They'll linger in my mind
When my time comes around
Worthless piece of shit,
Even to stupid to breath
Lowest of the low,
Just another cockroach to squeeze
You hypocrite shitbag, manipulative scum
Blaming on others all the shit you have done
Fuck all your lies
I'll remember every word
It will bring your demise
As I spit them back at you
Spitting forth lies with a stench that is sick
I will bury the burden you laid upon me dick
You two-faced clown, spineless servant
Inferior breed, to exterminate is to succeed
