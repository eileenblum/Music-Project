Here's what you said to me 10 years ago:
"You're the one to blame, it's all your fault
You're the cause that people stay away,
You're not welcome here"
Afterwards, deterioration,
You refuse all I say
All these feelings bring me to my knees;
So many questions blur my sanity
I blame myself... I'm filled with hatred...
There's no way out...
2nd of March, daily opposition
14th of April, you still ignore me
As I keep seeing the last years
Of my life pass before my eyes
You have taken what was mine
You destroyed what I lived for
Violated the person I am deep inside of me
You finished of my passion, my calling
When will the pain go away?
When will the pain go away?
7th of June, you allege insanity
Ensuing days, abandoned by the brave
As I keep seeing the last years
Of my life pass before my eyes
As I keep seeing the last years
Of my life pass before my eyes
I blame myself... I'm filled with anger...
I can only scream...
You have taken what was mine
You destroyed what I lived for
Violated the person I am deep inside of me
You finished of my passion, my calling
Words can't describe this...
All these feelings bring me to my knees;
So many questions blur my sanity
Just another day in my book of memories
Will you ever realize what you fucking did to me?
Just another day in my book of memories
Will you ever realize what you fucking did to me?
