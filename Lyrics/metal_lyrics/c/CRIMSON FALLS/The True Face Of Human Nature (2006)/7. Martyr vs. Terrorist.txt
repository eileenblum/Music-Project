Athra couldn't dry her eyes
Her father 
Caught by the madness
That wasn't meant for him
The carnaga is raised, a car set ablaze
Like very other day, the suburbs in flames
Terrorist - you say you give your life
that you're a martyr, for your conviction you die
Martyr - I say you're not even close
That you're a killer, taking innocent lives
Three days later
Still more than 60 degrees
At least 25 bodies
In between king's cross &amp; russel square
Wheer a marketplace masacre
Or two caved-in towers
Mothers dressed in black and cover
Graves with flowers
The carnage is raised
The underground set ablaze
On a madmen's day
The subway in flames
Terrorist - you say you give your life
that you're a martyr, 
for your conviction you die
Martyr - I say you're not even close
That you're a killer, 
taking innocent lives
Sowing death and destruction ...
Harvesting hate and grief
