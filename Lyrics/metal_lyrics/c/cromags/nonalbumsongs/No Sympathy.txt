There's no solution in those self-destructive ways
First you gotta free your mind to ever break away
I know sometimes it's hard to see what life is worth
But you got so much inside, and this is just a test

When I look back at yesterday
I don't think I could've changed my ways
But if there's one thing that can be undone
You know there might not be so many innocent victims
I ain't goin' out like that
No I ain't goin' out like that
You perpetrators better watch your back
Because you know I ain't goin' out like that

What ever happened to your dreams?
It's so much closer than it seems
What ever happened to your dreams?
You know the pride within your [?]

And I know you feel you live your life in hell
And I know the feeling 'cause I did as well
But the harder the battle is you know the sweeter is the victory
And in the end only you can set you free

When I feel like there's no solution
That's when you gotta look within
but beware of the battles that are comin' your way
[?] so stay outta my way

No sympathy!
No sympathy!
No sympathy!
No you ain't gonna get none from me!

What ever happened to your dreams?
It's so much closer than it seems
What ever happened to your dreams?
You know, the pride within your [?]

[guitar solo]

No sympathy!
No sympathy!
No sympathy!
No you ain't gonna get none from me!
