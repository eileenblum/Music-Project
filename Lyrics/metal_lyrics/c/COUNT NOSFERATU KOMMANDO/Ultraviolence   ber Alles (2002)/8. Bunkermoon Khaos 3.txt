[The silent happy war you love to hate, or hate to love]

Oh God I felt into War
I felt into the tears of the human race
A restless red river flowing through this world
Masters of War - Masters of Hate
Your names are tatooed upon my chest
Life has no value - Life is Death
Destroy it now and pay the rent
To rape and to kill is the only fucking law

Mass murder religion
Mass media corporation
Blood shall be spilled
There is no turning back
The end of your procession
Error in the program
All files will be erased

Give praise to your Guru
Follow him in Death and shut the fuck up

Poor lambs of God
Living meanly and voting obediently
Believing the lie
I want you dead

Total War - Death to all
World War Three
Dobermann Pinscher power
I'm the executioner
Domination then Destruction
Only solution

Glory to the blinds - World War Three
Total Genocide - World War Three
Collective Suicide - World War Three
You deserve to die - World War Three

Ultraviolence Ãber Alles
