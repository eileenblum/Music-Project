[Here comes our song especially designed for your in the woods parties]

This is the last crusade
One by one they will fall in blood
May all they die, don't give a fuck
Hate and sacrifice

Drugs and war
Terror crew domination
You are slaves
We don't care about the scene
We don't care about your teenage shit

You are slaves
Underground fashion-victims
Worship your Satan-TV-thing
And piss off
You underage porn-addicts

We don't care about the scene
We don't care about your teenage shit
Kommando Sechsundneunzig

A smile enlights my sexy lips
Each time I humiliate you
Now the attack must begin
Bunch of weaks, prepare for fight
Pray your Satan, need some help
The Count shall make you face the pain

Kommando Sechsundneunzig
Forever stinker and ugly bitch
Kommando Sechsundneunzig
Against your world, against your trends
Kommando Sechsundneunzig

This is the last crusade
One by one they will fall in blood
May all they die, I don't give a fuck
Hate and sacrifice

Drugs and war
Terror crew domination
You are slaves
We don't care about the scene
We don't care about your teenage shit

Kommando Sechsundneunzig

This is the last crusade
One by one they will fall in blood
May all they die, I don't give a fuck
Hate and sacrifice

Drugs and war
Terror crew domination
You are slaves
We don't care about the scene
We don't care about your shit
