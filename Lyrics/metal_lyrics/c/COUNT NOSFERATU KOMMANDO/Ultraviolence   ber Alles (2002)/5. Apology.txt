[A grand declaration of war ? ? ? Hush hush...]

Apology - World War Three
Humanity must perish
Nuclear fire is falling
Upon thee - human pig
Army of Khaos
Destroyers of your dreams
Human pigs
Revelation of the mighty
Last crusade
You are dead

Stormtroopers are awaiting
For our fist in the red sky
The only sign to attack
To terminate the planet
Desecration, violation
Suicide, annihilation

Feel the pulse - lords of war
Anti-human last crusade
Filled with hate for the masses
Your peace fist-fucked with anger
Tonite we will shout
The Apology of the Third
Tonite we'll give praise
To the final war to come

Feel the power
It's the dusk of human race
Feel this anger
It's the dusk of your holy world

War - Apology of the Third
Tears - Apology of the Third
Blood - Apology of the Third
Hatred - Apology of the Third

Apology of the third World War
Apology of the third sacred blood
Apology of the third Hatred
Apology of the third Khaos and final crusade

Stormtroopers are awaiting
For our fist in the red sky
The only sign to attack
To terminate the planet
The false prophet in first line
Is watching you from above
Starring at the horizon
The first movement has begun

Nacht aus Sieg
Final Wargasm
