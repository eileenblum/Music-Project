[Terminator Lestat is marching on]

Don't fear the hunter, reaper of the night
Bastard of God, delivered in blood
Grew up in hatred, was fed with human feces

Bloodsucker - Hunter - Reaper
Bloodsucker - Scapegoat - Terrorist
Well, call me as you wish

No one will come to save you
You raised your biblical hell
Western negative seed
You know the way to stop me
But you don't have the discipline
Who's laughing now ?

No hesitation
You're a long way from perfection
Suicide mission
I'll do my best to be what you always feared to see
Bloodsucker, the hunter, the reaper
Bloodsucker, Vlad Drakul of the newest century

Nos Feratos Kanda - Nosferat - Necurat
Nos Feratos Kanda - Who's laughing now ?

Don't fear the beast, the vampire
It's what you wanted to see
What you wanted me to be
No need to cry
Shut up and take the blame

Lord Kaiser Nosferat
Lord Kaiser Nosferat

Bio-mechanic vampire warrior
Killing machine, fucking no feelings
Don't fear me, come to me
There is nothing left to loose
And you know who's to blame
Who's laughing now ?
Who's laughing now, fucker ?

Sexy Sadie, drink of my so sacred blood
It's gonna be a perfect day
My glory : murder in the first degree

Nos Feratos Kanda - Nosferat - Necurat
Nos Feratos Kanda - Who's laughing now ?
Night comes down - My clan's nation
Nos feratos Kanda

Lord Kaiser Nosferat
Lord Kaiser Nosferat

Nos Feratos Kanda - Nosferat - Necurat
Nos Feratos Kanda - Fuck you, who's laughing now ?
Night comes down - My clan's nation
Nos feratos Kanda

I'll do my best to be what you always feared to see
No one will come to save you
You know the way to stop me
But you don't have the balls needed
Who's laughing now, fucker ?
