I will bear the name of Christ and come after him.
My heart is yearning for more than this.

I will bear the cross and come after him.
My heart is yearning for more than this.
I've committed to a truth that cannot be shaken.

Surround us with your presence and mend the weary hearts of a shattered generation.
What are you afraid of now?

Follow the example and you will become whole again.
His love will stretch across the land and the sea for those who choose to believe.

I will bear the name of Christ to a shattered generation.
