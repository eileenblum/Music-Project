This is the burden on my shoulders which I carry today.
My soul troubled and my heart is overturned within me.

I am a failure and I am weak.

This is the burden on my shoulders which I carry today.
My soul troubled and my heart is overturned within me.

I will embrace your truth, and I will embrace your glory.

Send down your messenger so he can prepare the world for you.
I will follow him until the end and watch his name be reverenced by all nations.

Truth will pour out of his mouth.

Deny yourself, pick up up your cross and follow me.
This he will say and I will listen.
