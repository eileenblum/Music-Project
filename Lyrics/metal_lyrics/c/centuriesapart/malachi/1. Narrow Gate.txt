This path unbeaten leads me to doubt the success that it promises.
Seeming alone, I will fight the battle which I will lose to myself.

I blame clarity, ignorance and my own pride;
The only driving force.
Regret I won't, though the spite builds a bitter unfamiliar climax.

These walls are thin and my morale is thinning.

How can I be so sure in a time where only wrong distracts me?
I am torn to desperation beyond my own doubts.
The path only narrows itself ahead and options diminish from the sealed fate.

I hope and fear that I am fearless.

I'll fight the battle, I'll lose to myself.
