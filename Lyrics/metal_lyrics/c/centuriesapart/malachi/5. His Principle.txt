Despite all we see,
We still have hope in humanity.
We were meant to win this fight and we will stand for what is right.
If we don't unite, we will shame him and his principle.

We will shame him and his principal.
(We will shame him.)

There is no better time then now to destroy vanity.
Do not fear the truth, for it is only love.

You will weep and you will mourn,
But the world will rejoice in his glory.
Your pain will turn into joy.

He will remember your voice,
If you remember his love.

Rejection is not an option.
Open you eyes.
Let him speak through you and don't doubt yourself.

Confide in him for in the end nothing else will matter.
Confide in him for in the end nothing else will count.

Keep your faith, he is coming soon.
(Keep your faith.)
Keep your faith, he is coming soon.
(Just keep your faith.)
