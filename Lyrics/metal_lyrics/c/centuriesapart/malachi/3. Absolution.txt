Look at me now, come and see what I see.
Look at your life ravaged by ideals.

Who are you to tell that I am wrong?
I really doubt that you are so wise.

This time I will bow down to whoever I chose.
Your plague will yield no salvation for you.
I dream that you will find our paths converging.

His love is the absolute way.
(How vain we have become)
Through the blood of Jesus Christ.

There is blood on our hands.
What have we become?
This is not who we are.
Stained with guilt and blame.

Now we are praying for a restoration.
