We gather all, for our passage through the storm
Young and old, voyage to the north
The sun sets, over snow capped hills
We converge, for shelter is near

Prevailing winds vanquish the fire's light
Cold and withered - through the endless night

Fight the pain
Push through the swarm
Hold on
As we brave the storm

We have to find a way to live
Cast the demons out and fight until the end
All the weak will die
Only the strong survive

Day breaks and offers comfort from the night
Our breathless weak willed are frozen in time
We drag the dead along; advance our journey on
Never dismiss them from our minds

Fight the pain
Push through the swarm
Hold on
As we brave the storm
