Three nations storm the fight 
We lead the masses, for high ground tonight
The enemy, forty thousand strong
Defending their lines
Soon to meet their fate

The escarpment of the battleground 
Scattered soldiers, lost on their homeland

Disarrayed by the northern storm
Our flank from the south
Will take them down

Fight on, our brothers in arms
Lightning strikes across the darkened skies
Fight on
We will never die in vain 
Spirits lost will carry on

Our weapons gain the edge
Blasting through the boundaries
Like a terrorizing plot to reach the end

Brothers down, we advance our fight
There is no way out
They die tonight

Conquered foes kneel at our feet
Triumphant we stand
We rule this land
