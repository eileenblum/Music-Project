Captured by the forces
Dragged onto their land
Tortured endlessly
We count the days to when we make our stand

Using rituals and tools from their descent
We take the pain
Knowing life in here cannot reach the end

We must break the chains that bind us
Freedom waits upon the dawn

Many men depend on faith to survive
Raising their hands to the sky
Rust in myself and we will carry on
For glory we will ride tonight

The date is set
To take command
No more starving souls
No giving in the selfless reprimand

We must break the chains that bind us
Freedom waits upon the dawn

To my kingdom who pray for my return
For vengeance, I will reclaim my throne
