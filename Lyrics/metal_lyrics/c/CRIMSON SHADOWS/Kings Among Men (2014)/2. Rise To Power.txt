As the daylight begins to fade away
And the ravens take to the wing
Silently I relieve my memories
By torchlight within my halls

These hands wrought countless wrongs
In my plight to take the throne

The righteous men of old forced upon me
Tasks untold, innocent lives I've slayed

Long ago I took up my blade 
Ashes of my woe fell upon me
On and on and into the fray
My withered armour falls away

The crown placed upon my brow
And rule of the realm draped upon me
Robed in kingly garb
The masses set before me
The fears and hopes are now my charge

Long ago I took up my blade 
Ashes of my woe fell upon me
On and on and into the fray
My withered armour falls away

Overcome by blood and fire
My father's legacy I now hold

Long ago I took up my blade 
Ashes of my woe fell upon me
On and on and into the fray
My withered armour falls away

Now I stand at the end of my days
vanquished my foes and remember the way
