March into The Trollmors
Waging war up the mounds of bones
Slashing through the thick hide of the swamp-kin
READY THE FIRE!!!

Pride inside, it's why we fight
Power coursing through our thick veins
We dig deep our boots into the soil of fate

Enchanted blades
Cut through the limbs of the opposing force
A smile creeps up on my face
As I ready my scroll of flame
BROTHERS UNITE!!!! THE TIME IS NOW!!!

Mountains crumble under our march

We're on the front-lines
Our spirit is strong 
Never backing down 
We will always battle hard 

Through our power inside
Burning deep within
I will always battle hard

The sight and sound of an epic storm
The rain seeps through our torn chain mail
We look to our brothers in arms 
WE'LL Fight TILL SUNRISE!!!

The blessings of the cleric
Allow us to destroy our foe
Swords with dripping black smoke
Kill the trolls before they hit the ground
Champions of the land return to the hillside
Where they lay down their arms for now
They know that the time will come again to
DEFEND THEIR HOMELAND!!!

See our fury build up
As we march towards
What could be our certain death
Across the river
We are the proud few
We are the chosen ones
We're one with the gods
We will always battle hard
Our spirits burns bright
Through the darkness of the night
We've fought long and hard
Now its time to let down our guard
Battle hard for your friends
Battle hard for your love
Battle hard for your dreams
Battle hard for your life
