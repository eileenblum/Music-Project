So raise your glass 
It may be your last 
We ride in the battle at dawn

So raise your glass, and toast to your lads 
who have long departed for the kingdom of ale 
Pound back the sacred brew, let it overpower your soul

Pull back the reins, the time has come 
Souls will pass before this war is done 
Rip, crunch, break through the lines 
This was how we fought for a good kings mind

So ride on strong, the battle's not done 
We'll push on hard, this war will be won

Kingdom of Ale, we cherish and honor thee 
Kingdom of Ale, we drink to your power 
For the king, for the land, 
Men have fought and men have died 
So drink to your kingdom of ale

Attack our foes with muscle and brawn 
We'll never tire till the break of dawn 
Stationed here by our kings command 
we were bread from birth to protect our land

Tales across the land, we've really redefined 
We need to bear in mind, that our fates are intertwined 
Charge on ahead, feel the heat of the sun 
I don't know about you but this is what i call fun

Death on the battlefield is the greatest glory of all

I'll send you into the 
Kingdom of Ale, we cherish and honor thee 
Kingdom of Ale, we drink to your power 
For the king, for the land, 
Men have fought and men have died 
So drink to your kingdom of ale

So raise your glass and toast to your lads in the kingdom of ale 
We'll never run, we'll never back down and we cannot ever die

Kingdom of Ale, we cherish and honor thee 
Kingdom of Ale, we drink to your power 
For the king, for the land, 
Men have fought and men have died 
So drink to your kingdom of ale

Kingdom of Ale, we cherish and honor thee 
Kingdom of Ale, we drink to your power 
With the blood on our hands 
We will soon meet again 
So drink to our kingdom of ale
