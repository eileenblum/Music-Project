Fight! The spirit in the night, crawls towards the light 
Which protects us from her wrath but she knows the path 
Our land is our lives, we guard it with honour 
starlit skies up high, the air is crisp and cold

I feel it deep inside, billowing with pride 
defend it to death, an oath in blood to god 
Pledged to be the one, the war has begun

Her forces, have overrun our flanks, arrows flying high 
We gather in our line, no fear is in our eyes 
we clinch our steel so tight, the homes they did ignite 
I can still hear their cries, why'd the innocent have to die?

Cries I hear them deep inside, so many have died 
a morbid sight to see, It picks the core of me 
Ran away from home, she's come to steal the tome

Runaway, retreat to the hills for you lives 
Ride on high, remember this day for your life 
Beyond the mountain wasteland is where we reside 
with our courage for forevermore

I have heard of a tale, which speaks of a vale 
Inside this lies the key, laid next to an old tree 
immense power lies within, our remission of sin 
we'll fight again another day, the enemies will pay

My love is dead and gone, memories not foregone 
I pledge to be the one, who will get this done 
Bring the war to her own land, I'll need more men to stand

Runaway, retreat to the hills for you lives 
Ride on high, remember this day for your life 
Beyond the mountain wasteland is where we reside 
with our courage for forevermore

I feel it deep inside, billowing with pride 
defend it to death, an oath in blood to god 
Pledged to be the one, the war has begun

Runaway, retreat to the hills for you lives 
Ride on high, remember this day for your life 
Beyond the mountain wasteland is where we reside 
with our courage for forevermore
