I am obsolete
Bury every piece of morality
Abuse my entropy
Spare me no pity

I took myself for granted
Never saw how much of a wreck I could become
Now I must pay the price
Of times undone

I am but a flame
Chasing its own trail
Abound with negligence
Battered to terminal retribution

All this time I saw
My flawless reflection
All it bestowed upon me
Was a glance into my eradication

Times undone
Apathy caught up
My skin is a fraud
Rightfully torn apart
Times undone
No frame to hide out
Had enough of this lust
Wrench me to the point of naught

Burn the wound
No needle will do
I had it coming
Erase my view

Now I must pay the price
Of times undone
