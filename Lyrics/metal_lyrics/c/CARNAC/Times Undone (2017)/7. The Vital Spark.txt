Let us sail far
Far from this mayhem
All we lived through
Will be washed away 

Let us sail far
Far from this mayhem
Nothing will join us
No one else

Unfurl
Unfurl
Conflated with the sea
Unfurl
Unfurl
Save me my infancy

From the famine of morality
To a wealth of tranquillity
Shades of imminent grace
Will aid our totality

Let these waves be
Our sole concern
Let these gulls be
Our sole companions

No liturgy
No penance
Our only guides
Are the oceans

No cries
No clamor
My father 
Is my only savior

Desolation is a virtue
On these waters of none
Save us our regrets
Drench us in the light of the sun
