Weeping of stones  
Gnashing of teeth

You live your yearning
I'll live the obscene

Bring me prudence
Bring me deceit

Bring me the path
Of envisioned derelicts
Slowly stomping on me
Relics of ache, gashed with rain 

Weeping of stones and the gnashing of teeth
Bring me prudence, bring me deceit
Weeping of Stones and the gnashing of teeth
You live your yearning, I'll live the obscene

My riveting fire has now come to an end
Forgotten mountains turned into sand
But under the weight of black
Even the serpents ascend

If stars fell down from the sky
No one would bat an eye
It would take a rain of dead birds
To wake the pandemonium
