Out of nowhere
This bliss came along  
Touched the prosperous
And flattered their pride
Whether a notion
Or intentional fallacy
It brought to all
A treacherous destiny

In this ground of withering it lies
Uttered by malice and fiery eyes    
This is where your yearning comes to life
With vacant fates, yet endless heights 

Believe your withered eyes
Unbend your will
Someone or something
Caused this encounter
Between earthly
And abstract luxury
No ounce of ruth
And plenty of vanity 

Favor the power
Cherish this gift
Shape the existence
Draw the first breath
All the endeavors
Hang on your wishes
Meet your desire
Draw the first breath

No man would bleed
Without a conscious
No thoughts would be   
Perceived as torches

Most sudden of throes
Yield your vision
One more decision
Until eventual loss
