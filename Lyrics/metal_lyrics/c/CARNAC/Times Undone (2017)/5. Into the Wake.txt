This sight of innocence
Summons the infancy
Vertebrated ashes
Leave trails of dust and dreams

By negation
You will reach the summit
Of aplenty distress

Build yourself a communion
Of approaching deaths
Torment each thought passing through your exposed mind

Pave the way for the lunacy of the ages
Feel its wind on your shrouded neck
Pave the way for the lunacy of the ages
No sleep will cure, no substance will savour

This sight of innocence
Summons the infancy
Vertebrated ashes
Leave trails of dust and dreams

As your worries drain, it climbs
Nourishes your self-told lies
Seeks you even when you stand still
Hears your sweat slip away

In silent, dying waters
My faint flesh, warmly shivers 
At this hour of devour 
No flesh of mine will be torn

This urge for withering
Drowned, in cold shores of deliverance
Now this wake fills my dormant eyes
I will always be shackled by light
