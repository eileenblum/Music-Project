Usurpers of life
Walk past these gardens
They look for sins
To mold into pleasures 

Usurpers of life
Take our hands by storm
They lead us into their
Shrines of fornication

Innocence, decadence
They beckon from afar  
Neurotic, ecstatic
They come to seize our dreams

These worried skies have become a pattern
This ground lies disrupted and rotten

I will be your prophet
Spread your eyes open and 
Feast on your burden
Until we are bounded
I will cleanse you from inside
It's a blessing in disguise

Whatever you may hold onto
wherever you may want to dwell
We will tarnish them along with your nights

No matter what branch you reach 
No matter which soil you stand on
Your tender spirit is now our domain

They beckon from afar
They come to seize our dreams
