Faith is fire
Spread over desire
These promises 
All loose, all dire
Bear witness no longer
To a life worded in coal

You can see the yearnings
Hiding in your body
You can hear the notions of purity
What you came to see
What you lived to be
Is scratching your chest
With veiled honesty

Your eyes will curse mine
Look into coffins of time
The past will be blind
And daughters of dawn will shine

I am a mere kindling in a land of coals
Cannot be saved by even the biggest of shores
I will not hide in this hollow pit 
Hands of purgation, rid me of this deceit

The time has come
The warmth must be eager
Now only I remain 
I will let me be 

I will burn
Within my comfort 
Plant the seeds
For my rest

I will burn
