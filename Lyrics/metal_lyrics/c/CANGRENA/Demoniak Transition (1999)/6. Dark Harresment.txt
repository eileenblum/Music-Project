I image a run a run after you
To leave you will to the evil spirits
Go you can burn in hell In the night of evil
Me, your troughts wrongs
I will incenerate your heart
Just like father Satan would have clone
When I'll get you in my clows
Dead, all bloody I'll trow your organs to the dogs
Just like a father Satan would have done
Life is in sick darkness
Your soul will be for Satan
I image a run after you
To leave you will to the evil spirits
So you can burn in hell,in the night of evil
You cries will be hard In the deep of the sadness and go
I'll be able to joy to enjoy
I image a run after you
To leave you will of the evil spirits
So you can burn in hell,in the night of evil
Your trhoughts wrong
I will incerenate you heart
In an act of a dark precessence
Just like a father Satan would have done
When i get you in my claws
Dead and bloody Just like father Satan would have done
Life is sin,darkness Your soul will be for Satan.
