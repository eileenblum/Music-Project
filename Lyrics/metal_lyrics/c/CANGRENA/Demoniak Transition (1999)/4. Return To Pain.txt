I walk alone
Guided through the black
Path of my life In my mind
They're no control
Something strange
Takes over me Takes over me
I see a woman come
Something is going in my soul
I see a woman come this isn't me

Attacking evil
Attacking evil

I neck her
I rape her A

gain and again and again

Return to pain

Horrible expressions
Cries of agony
Whit blood in my cook
The demons applaud my organs

Return to pain Once done...

I seek for refuge
She is maltrated, terrible pain scenes
Then expulsion of non desire

Return to pain

She will always remember the pain
She will never go out alone

Return to pain

The pain with the night the night.
