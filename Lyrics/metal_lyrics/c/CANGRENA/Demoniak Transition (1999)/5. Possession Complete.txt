At the mountain He pray
He watches for histribe
There is no peace any more
Strangers come for their Land gold And women
Bayauije
He told them Fight or die I'd rather died
Than be slave a savage struggle
I can't go wrong Demons ...
come to me be my guide Demons ...come to me be my guide
Demons come to me be my guide
He can't any more Call up the evil forces of the mountain
His heart with wrath
His lost eyes Demons respond upon such call

Possessed garabito go to faight In complete possession
In complete possession Demons...
come to me be my guide Demons...
come to me be my guide
He smash the corpse

Whit maggots in the flesh
A strange flesh A rotted flesh Demons...
come to me be my guide Demons...
come to me be my guide
Demons come to me be my guide

Covered with blood haleness
Demons will come upon chief's call
The warrior gets set For the next possession

Next possession
