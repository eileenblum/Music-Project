Morbid sin
When the putrefaction Arrives to us

Sick and bleed
Pain rapture in my black life
Internal bleeding
Arrive with my rotted body

Obscured my soul
Birth of maggots Exposed guts Pestilence and filth
Decayed by bothersome blood Incubator of maggots

Obscured soul in my grief
What is your fucking dream?

My dreams screaming Life away
The graveyard expose the bones

Life in vein
The graveyard espouse the rotted corpses

What is your fucking dream?
My dreams screaming Sick of dream Pain raptures my black soul.
