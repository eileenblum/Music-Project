[Lyrics: I. Campbell]

Forced to murder
A sympathetic bloodbath, blighted within these dead lands
Hellbent
Frozen
Speak it and live it
Maybe you shouldn't
Speak it and live it
Maybe we shouldn't live at all
Bodies piling
No room to bury you
No more trying
No more hell on earth.
Panic
Purgatory
Hellbent, watching you bleed
Carving on the walls, can I call this home?
Carving on the walls, I couldn't stop
Innocence taken from my dreams
I can't let this ruin me
Innocence stolen from my sleep
This cannot be how it seems
Hellbent
