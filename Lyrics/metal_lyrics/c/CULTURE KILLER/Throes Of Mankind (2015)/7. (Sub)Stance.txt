[Lyrics: H. Young, I. Campbell, D. Blow]

Drown our bodies in poison to make this world bearable
The ounce of hope that we had has been smoked long ago
We live with what we're given, is life even worth living?
Let's just keep lying to ourselves, until we're all imprisoned
Useless vessels
Hollow minds
Take back the throes of mankind
We're all bleach drinking swine
Full circle
It's what we do to cope when trapped
It's easy to run, 'til you're out of breath
When one regrets to serve, another will do
Wallowing in our own pollution
An illness handed down to us, passed down
Genetics twined with loathing of the self

The more consumed the more it kills numbing stupor

These gears of coping, the mechanism turns once more, wired for destruction
Years spent submerged in tar
Revitalized, incarcerated
A double edged sword drenched in my own blood
When one regrets to serve, another will do
Wallowing in our own pollution
An illness handed down to us, passed down
Genetics twined with loathing of the self
The cruel vice excised in me, selfish
Self help when sorrow reaches the stalemate

The recluse retracts to the hearth
A place in which reason prospers

Burn
