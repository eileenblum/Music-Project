[Lyrics: I. Campbell, H. Young, D. Blow]

Exterminate filth

Blackout, erase, delete, pour the ink, it's obsolete
It's a matter of opinion in a sadist nation
Your blind vision isn't needed here
Hide behind closed eyes
You are a menace to your own kind
Stuck in the way of life
Stagnant progression, an infestation
There's no need for your bigotry anymore
Your hatred is senseless
My hate is real
Exterminate filth
