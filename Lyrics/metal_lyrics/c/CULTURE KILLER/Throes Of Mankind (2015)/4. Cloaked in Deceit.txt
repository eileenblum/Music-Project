[Lyrics: D. Blow, I. Campbell]

Among the life you live is a community
Refining a practice of unthinkable deceit

Donning the cloak of mistaken identity
Rooted in plain view, and some are just to blind to see it
Teachers, neighbors, family, strangers
All building trust
Seeking out the vulnerable to feed into lust
Lurking in the shadows are maniacal impostors
With the main objective of satisfying their own desire
Harboring the images of our youth
There is only management
There is no cure
Never questioning the desecration of adolescence
Without penance for their hideous actions
There is no right, when all is wrong
Immolation of a predator only to save our own
