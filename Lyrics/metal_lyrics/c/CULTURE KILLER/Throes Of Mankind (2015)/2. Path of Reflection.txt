[Lyrics: Dylan Blow, Ian Campbell]

Every second, manipulated
This body is no longer a temple holding guilt
No more living this falsification
As forked tongues guide me along this path of reflection
Holding torches, leading the way
Conversing with the serpent, as Eve once did
I know now, free will is the devils gift
(Hail)
The venom's cold, cold as stone
The venom is deep within my soul
I refuse to continue living under your rule, implemented by fear
Bones protrude through my skin, as do my sins
The pain suffices for now, but only in this moment
Every second, manipulated
This body is no longer a temple holding guilt
