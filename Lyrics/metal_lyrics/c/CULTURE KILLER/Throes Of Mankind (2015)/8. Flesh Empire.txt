[Lyrics: I. Campbell, D. Blow]

People, equivalent to you and I
Abducted from their homes, brought to foreign soil
Poached and hunted like animals
Sold to an industry of degradation
Daughters fall victim to monarchs of torment
Sons, powerless to addicts of perversion
A sick and twisted stimulation of the senses
Corruption, in all it's fleeting glory
Protected by badges and stances of authority
Lining their pockets from the sale of human beings
Vending sex to rabid dogs in heat, acting out hideous fantasies
It's a sick and twisted stimulation of the senses
Money exchanged for appetite
Ravenous and real, true to the public eye

An empire veiled in the shadows

Money exchanged for appetite
Ravenous and real, true to the public eye
An empire of indulgence
