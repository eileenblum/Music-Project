[Lyrics: D. Blow / I. Campbell]

Wasted idols
Words with no purpose
You hold the ability to mold minds
Exploit of power, a position that you don't deserve
Sculpting a bleak future of misguided children
Another generation of breeders obsessed with digital vanity

Wraiths with beating hearts, strung out on legal substance
An end to suffering for profit, no pity
Force fed by fallacy, swallowing every bite
It is you and I, how we see this life, and what we choose to do
It's culture, manifestations of human intellectual achievement

Murder, you've wiped it all away and brought to shame what was supposed to be important
The things that matter most, decency amongst humanity
Exploit of power, a position you don't deserve
Sculpting a bleak future of misguided children
Victim to distraction
