[Lyrics: Dylan Blow]

She awoke again from another fit of his rage
Took a look in the mirror and wiped the blood from her face
You swore that it would never happen again
Those words meant nothing
Never again became everyday, with his rage evolving
You were supposed to love me
You were supposed to protect me
The man she once found confidence with is now the one face invoking terror within
His hands, she will never forget his hands
Her screams, he ignored everyone of them
Tears of anguish
Domestic silence
Intimidation, tolerated abuse
Restricted self worth, all because of you
Suppressed emotions, internalized aggression
Justice through retaliation
Reclaiming life by taking another
Avenging my misery
This thirst for blood is a primal satisfaction
A promise of living one more day
We locked eyes between convulsions, in unspoken resentment
Your shell shed pigment like the leaves draining their color
And in that moment of watching life escape your wounds, as you fermented in your material broth
Exuviating this burden of human existence
