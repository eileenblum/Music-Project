[Lyrics: D. Blow, I. Campbell]

Involuntarily constrained to actuality
Enslaved to an environment of discontent
In pursuit of transcendence, where death is the only common thread
Longing to view life from a supernatural perspective
Spirits danced before us, as they broke the surface
Presented with formal grace and haunting purpose
Ascending from molten earth, with a hand of guidance, and soothing touch of hands held in a circle
Heads bowed, chanting in whispers
Our voices perished, leaving our throats filled with ashes
Oh, how our lungs blackened, as each word was spoken
We entered a realm of pure observation
Witnessing, first hand, our horrid creation
The error of man's ways was forcing nature to become inhumane
The error of our ways was forcing nature to become inhumane
This guilt rests on a septic stake for the world to see.
Charred and blistered, cold and at home
A revival of essence
Bodiless, watching this planet die
Restoration is on the other side
At peace with being no more
This cathartic escape has relieved us from fate
Finding comfort in a lifeless form
Eternally reborn
