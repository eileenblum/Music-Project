First I heard it, like the muffled whispers
of a thousand insect wings caressing your insides
Then it grew, gaining moment
umtil it howled with a seismic roar

My mind gleamed, my body shivered
as the echoes of my experience settled down
I was drenched in light, engulfed by darkness
My outlook shook as the walls came tumbling down

The light came back, the smoke cleared
As I found myself breathing again
My body weak, my mind clear
Iâve climbed back and I live once again

The eternal recurrence
The eternal return
