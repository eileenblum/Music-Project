Iâm a tenant in my own body
Iâm a parasite in this hollow shell

Harvest my body
Pick my bones clean
Tap my vital juices
Extract my energy

Iâve given up â control of my own life
Iâve sold away â the right to self decide
The perfect machine â should have no thought
A fitting cog â should not be conscious
Iâve given you all
But now I want it back

You broke my body
You dried my bones up
You diluted my juices
You perverted my energy
