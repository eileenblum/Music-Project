Out here in the wastelands of the outer rims the air is thick
A heavy stench of rotting metals and industrial waste is wavering
Licking at your skin, infecting your sight, clouding your mind
This is where youâll die
This is the dead world of the gnawing

The Gnawing

Stay out of the shadows avoid the dimming light and hold your breath
Keep your head down and avoid the fumes or youâll be spotted
A lumbering presence slowly gaining pace, biding its time
This is where youâll find
You are in the clutches of the gnawing

The Gnawing

Engrossed by fog, standing face to face
With an untamed force of nature
His features reflected in mine
And in those traits I see â I see myself

Where he goes â I must follow
Iâll follow you
What he knows â I must know
I know you
