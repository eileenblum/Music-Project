The beast in the shadows
Is waiting for a sing
Grunting...
Howling...
He is dreaming with his blood
Falling from his heart,
Squeezed between her hands.
Sweet lover.

There is no place to go.
There is no hell or heven.
Not a paradise.
It is just the death!

Her soul flies beyond the stars.
When darkness is all around...
Everything is black.
Sweet lover from my dreams
Don't let my hands.
Don't wanna get lost into this reality

Lost in the shadows
I'm waiting for a sign
Grunting...
Howling...
I'm dreaming with my blood
Falling from my heart,
Squeezed between her hands.
Sweet lover.

There's no place to go.
There's no hell or heven.
Not a paradise.
May be just the death!.

Sweet lover
Don't wanna get lost into this reality.
Take me far away from here,
Beyond the stars,
Beyond the lights.
For the last time
Please come to me
Come to me!
