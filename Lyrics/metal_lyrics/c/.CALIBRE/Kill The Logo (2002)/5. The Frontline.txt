with every context of crisis that you bend - with every arsenal and all the weaponry you invent
with every poverty-line, that you assign - you shape the frontline - you bury landmines

the frontline - the frontline
the frontline - the frontline

silent, hidden armies, handling our disappeared - the narco-cide and the gods that guide it
they're always oh so fucking clear - cryptomnesia lashes out as the cover falls behind
you shape the frontline - - you bury landmines

[chorus:]
the frontline - the frontline - it suits me fine
the frontline - the frontline - you bury landmines

bullet riddled bodies for the hedonist fuck - you got me dying to resist
because the undermined outweigh the satisfied - corrode, reload - economist
come on, and run anomalies - our people would be better of as enemies
in these dire-need democracies - we're all refugees - refugees

[chorus]

charity - luxury - positioned so comfortably
equity - battery - shake hand with hypocrisy
charity - luxury - positioned so comfortably
equity - battery - hypocrisy
the context of crisis is bent
the practice is losing intent

[chorus]
