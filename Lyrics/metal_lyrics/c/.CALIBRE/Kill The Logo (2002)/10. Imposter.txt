imposter

[chorus:]
imposter - i am the torch at the gate
imposter - i am the switch in the grenade
imposter - i am the rush within the raid
imposter - aren't we all set to detonate.

the bulwarks have all shanties erased and we're all choking on the aftertaste
the cartels where destitution leads - enjoy the occidental stampede
these fraudulent defenders are all coming of age
extraneous endeavors to finalize their wage

[chorus]

ah worshipper of assets - the affiliate herd
and covered by the menace - we all inhale the dirt

ah the sum of all parts - makes us communards/ communards
ah the sum of all parts - makes us communards/ communards

1 i strip - my sleeve - and show my horrid scar
- rebellion is the blood that drips from this guitar
2 i lift - my shoes - and show my broken feet
- rebellion is the blood that pours down from this beat
3 i pull - my tongue - and show my bitter taste
- rebellion is the blood that trickles from this bass
4 i cut - my skin - and show my brittle bones
- rebellion is the blood that gushes from this microphone
5 ah - rebellion has to be / it has to be contagious
- because they try to do away with every last one of us
6 ah - rebellion has to be / it has to be contagious
- because they try to do away with all of us - all of us

(backings) the killer's holding office - yeah
he pulled our tongues - he broke our bones- na na na na

[chorus]
