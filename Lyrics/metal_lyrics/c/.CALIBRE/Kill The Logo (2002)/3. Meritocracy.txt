he meritocracy

freedom - the contrast of freedom - the contrast

the network's avaricious, the fabric takes the darkest quote
no salvaging the designated when the hostage is the ransom note
the subtle hijacking of freedom leaves the common injury
it makes you feel like you're entitled to just a portion of your dignity
the harvest is their favorite mammon, reaping the spark in me
this is a point-blank, covert colony - i see the meritocracy

[chorus:]
the meritocracy the meritocracy
just when did liberty become the industry

freedom - the contrast of freedom - the contrast

before i subside, exhausted by aversion
i will lay, lay, lay waste their ruling circle

the dead-line, connecting all the secrecy
i will lay, lay, lay waste that monopoly

[chorus]

the favorites are travelling the byways - on their dead-soul-drives they feed
i see them bring about a shock-wave - (of ferocity)

the capitals are racing up the ladder - the circle's narrowing, indeed
you get to buy your very matter - (the meritocracy)

[chorus]
