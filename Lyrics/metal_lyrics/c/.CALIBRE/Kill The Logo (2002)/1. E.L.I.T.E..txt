[chorus:]

the breath of a hurricane - [all shall fall]?
the breath of a hurricane - [all shall fall]?
the breath of a hurricane

it's the conspiracy on the emerald hills - the death rattle of a shadow company
the silencer, the sleeper and a charnel house - for every luxury
they've forgotten more names than i would like to recall 
erect your wonder wall i will remain appalled
the 'mouths to feed' are dry with novocaine
the pure gasp eats the rain - it won't stand the breath
of a hurricane 

[chorus]

(not luxuries for some... but necessities for all)

this is how i got a taste, i got a place in this unremitting call
not luxuries for some of us but necessities for all
they level out, the playing field - it's raw diplomacy 
the sonic ride, the thunderbolt - tempest of equity
and line up all, with attrition now - and stroll capitol lane
the dual thrust of ambition won't... - won't stand the breath...
of a hurricane

[chorus]

i've tasted - i've tasted - i've wasted - how i've embraced it

audacious brilliance - running that welfare mile
leaving that noble drop - and a stalwart missile
it's all about vision - who shoots the biggest gun
who beats the loudest drum - who runs the longest run
silent variety - debilitated brain
compelling liberty - the breath of a hurricane

[chorus]
