we're suffering the calibre

i drag me in and out, i'm my own contraband 
i'm catering the interests, of a market i strongly resent 
how crazy is that - can you feel that

i mess around, i fuck it up, somehow - i see us all getting administered
i mess around, i fuck it up, somehow - i see we're suffering, we're suffering the calibre

[chorus:]
if these shackles are routine, then prison is surrender - 
we're suffering the calibre

i drag me in and out, i'm my own contraband
i'm wired to these relays, that even i can't circumvent
how crazy is that - can you feel that

i mess around, i fuck it up, somehow - i see us all getting administered
i mess around, i fuck it up, somehow - i see we're suffering, we're suffering the calibre

[chorus]

the calibre is well incorporated
the government is fully generated
initiate the sequencer
calibre

we all get out tonight - we're almost ready
i see we're suffering - we're all getting administered

we all get out tonight - we're almost ready
i see we're suffering - we're suffering the calibre

[chorus]
