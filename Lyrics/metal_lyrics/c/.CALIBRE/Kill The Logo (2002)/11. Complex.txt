the assembly plant is smothering me
i'm a predefined commodity

the marauder mill needs an unpolluted grist
i can feel the strain around my wrist

we're in human farms and the scythe is cutting carefully
reaping the radical 
we're in human farms and the blight is striking randomly
it's reforming me

[chorus:]
when the sedition's growing - when you force me to the front
when you say we are the product, i'm the vanguard of the hunt
when the sedition's growing - when you force me to the front
when you say we are the product, i'm the vanguard of the hunt

the automation-swell has ever-tarnished the crop
the ravenous reform will never stop

the fattening proceeds of trade activity
and we live life like a dead foundry

we're in human farms and the scythe is cutting carefully
reaping the radical 
we're in human farms and the blight is striking randomly
it's reforming me

an' shock it...
i got the diligence to motivate - i got the mind-span to reallocate
the most ferocious freedom known to me - is better than the safest slavery

[chorus]

ah rake the land - the diagram is hyperbole
ah cut the stand - the reaper sure is on a role

an' shock it...
i got the diligence to motivate - i got the mind-span to reallocate
the most ferocious freedom known to me - is better than the safest slavery
