sometimes i care to wonder about the blindfold on my soul
about the razor wire fence that isolates me in the mold
the precipice is closing in on rancid magnanimity
you starve me to the brink of ail then formulate your drugs to me
you serve it up as love but it's a grotesque felony
you got it coming now because this time you're fucking with me

[chorus:]
if you're my rapist - i'm your assassinator
did you really ever think you'd get the best of me

your everlasting status quo - you've sanitized the sore before
your movers and your shifters caper until there really is 'no more'
we live like near fatalities inside the network of dissent
don't seem to spare any expense to manufacture our consent
you serve it up as lust but it's a sick insanity
you got it coming now because this time you're fucking with me

[chorus]
(never)

yeah - i'm your assassinator
did you really ever think you'd get the best of me

all erodes from here on end - you're never getting my consent

yes i know all the victims - of your supremacy
yes i know all the victims - your fields run endlessly
yes i know all the victims - of your supremacy
there will be no more victims - this time you're fucking with me... 

[chorus]
