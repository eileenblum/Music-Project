the country that i am, is lost tonight
the visions, the strucutres, the unions are sold
delusion is a dense cold forest of intrests
where freedom now just cannot unfold

there's salt in my eyes but i stil feel the same [x2]

every step out of line becomes a marathon
through solid walls of salt - karma walks on

[chorus]
yeah - karma walks on

we're suffering losses - they coat bullets hot with teflon
we're suffering losses - they run star wars, they run echelon
we're suffering losses - they got traces run on everyone

got viral blasts, shot from tv - wartactics pressed to dvd
subsonic rounds and firewalls - espionage industrial

[chorus]

the blast missed none - erratic recon
the blast missed none - i see you butcher the pawns
the blast missed none - touching horizon
the blast missed none - and karma walks on

the ambush is a commonplace where you embrace the barrel smiling
and malice bares a caring face

there's salt in my eyes but i stil feel the same
and every step is a marathon
there's salt in my eyes but i stil feel the

we're suffering losses - the temperance of hydro bombs
we're suffering losses - they pop canisters of sedition
we're suffering losses - and the pointmen carry cold passion

got blasting caps that ricochet and killing zones that lead astray
a full-blast, wipe out stategy for a militant economy

[chorus]
