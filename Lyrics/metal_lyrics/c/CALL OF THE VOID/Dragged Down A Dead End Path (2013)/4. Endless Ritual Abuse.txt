In defense of fragile minds and helpless souls
Too young got react
Force fed lies that feed
Into your filthy plans of indoctrination

Feast on the fears of youth
Prey on the weakness of mind
Hide your claws in plain sight
Indoctrinate

Pray for life while preaching death
To innocence in its purest form
Validation through submission to
The rules you don't even follow

Feed the sheep to the wolves
No morals
No remorse
Feed the sheep to the wolves
No remorse, there's no way out
There is no way out

No way out
No way out
No way out
No way out
