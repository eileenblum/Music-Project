No love
Can save you
No hate
Can kill you

Tell me something meaningful

Drag another life into sunlight
Pray another day would turn out right

Looking for answers for a life lived in denial
Finding solitude in razors breaking skin
Another victim of the walls crashing down
Need that sweet kiss of death to get rest

Feel your life escape in every cold step,
Crushed under the weight of your last breath

This cold void embraces all life

Fireâs burningâ¦ Give up the ghost

Eternal solitude (put on the noose)
Weightless uncertainty (give up the ghost)
Unheard apology (put on the noose)
Crumbling effigy
