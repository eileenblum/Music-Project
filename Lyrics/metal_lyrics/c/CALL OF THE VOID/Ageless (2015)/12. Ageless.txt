Ghosts of existence
Cultures abandoned
Secrets of folklore
Weakness on display

Bleed out the truth, the blood lust of time,
Cure for the chosen, death for the swine

In sculpted repose, their face screams of fear,
Of bones turned to glass, throats cut to the ear

Their curse was their name
Their death note, their faith
The blackened abyss now sealed their fate

They knew that one day blood would be shed

Descending into the fire

Base instinct-Survival

History repeated
Culture of bloodshed
Lust for the fire
Spineless subservient

In sculpted repose, their face screams of fear,
Of bones turned to glass, throats cut to the ear

Their curse was their name
Their death note, their faith
The blackened abyss now sealed their fate

Preservation of Ignorance

Blackened bodies, eyes of fear,
endless struggle through the years
Bathed in blood, free from sin,
while evil hearts beats from within

Ageles
