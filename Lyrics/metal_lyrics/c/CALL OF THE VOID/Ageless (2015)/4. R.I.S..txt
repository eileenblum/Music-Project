I watched as the ground gave way beneath you
Your rotten promise of eternity

Lies we tell ourselves
Just to hold on to
Love that only leaves
Entrapment

Iâve got god on a fucking leash, and Iâll walk her like a dog
Iâve been dragging this corpse through hell for too goddamn long
Did you live out your fears?
Find happiness in abandoning yourself?

Lies

I am no way out, just relief

Iâve got god on a fucking leash, and Iâll walk her like a dog
Iâve been dragging this corpse through hell for too goddamn long

I will watch as the sky comes crashing down on you.
