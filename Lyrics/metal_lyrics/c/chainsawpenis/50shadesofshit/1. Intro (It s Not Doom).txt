Once upon a time aeons ago
Eighteen months in a chalet in the darkest pit of Dante's Inferno
Wales dark forces convened clouds gathered people moaned in horror
The weather was slightly overcast much in the manner of normal weather
It lied for as the nine planets aligned and Pluto is still a planet
A virgin was sacrificed though she did not sleep with any of us
