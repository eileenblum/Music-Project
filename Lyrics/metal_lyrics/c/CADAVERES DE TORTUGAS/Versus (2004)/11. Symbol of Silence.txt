My voice echoes. It fills the town
Searching for you, who can't be found
I close my eyes and sleep. I feel you again
I'm burning inside, my fever's rising high
Till the dawn does us apart

I want to find that place
Tell me which road leads me to you?
I only need a little sign
And I'll wander to find you
Until the end of time

Sun dries the tears I wept
Embrace my wheezin' breast
I don't want to lose my faith in you
I want to get out of here. The prison of oblivion
Say goodbye, 'cause night is calling
And I'm ready to pass away

In the cradle of night
My cleansed soul sleeps
Its smile is true again
Its quiet moan is relieved
There's patience all around
Confusion's left behind
If you need a sign I'm fine:
Just look up to the sky

I painted it there
I hid it there
I draw it there

The symbol of silence
