You've got to choose that what side you on, boy
To win or to lose, to build or to destroy
Move on with this muthafuckin' breakdown
Bring down the whole town
if you hear this sound

I'm here again, stronger than ever
Face of an angel, soul of a devil
Learn like a newborn, wise like an old man
Your worse self who just can't be beaten

You can't see me
You can't hear me
You just feel me

Invisible enemy, a shadow that bites
You're so weak with blood in your eyes
This mental pain - an inner shout
A part of your mind but I will get out

My cage is the first I blast away
The devil inside you will come out anyway
Don't try to run, it has no sense
You've got to take a part in this devil's dance
