It's a different day, your time has come
The lying interests betray you
Don't think about revenge, forget it
There's nothing you could do

Your way has been written
Have patience in silence
Believe in the power of faith
Wear your crown of violence

Rusty nails through your flesh
Endless gate in the plane
Into the immortality
Will we rise again?

Don't you feel fear? They expel you
in the protection of innocents
Suffer for our sins, your body cries blood
The torture never ends

Your followers pray can't help you too
In spile of your goodwill, you are lost
You cleared us of crime and vice
But your mission end on the cross
