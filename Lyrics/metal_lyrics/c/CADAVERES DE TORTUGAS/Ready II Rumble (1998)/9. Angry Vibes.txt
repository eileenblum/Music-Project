Rambling faces
Between foggy rails
Together alone
It's a gathering place

Hide behind yourself
I can't understand
Walk on your own way
Maybe you will find a man

Angry vibrations

Sit and see
Pictures of past
Live your life
It's only the rest

Your mind needs
Just a little sign
I can't accept no more
This fucking state of mine, no
