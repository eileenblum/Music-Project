Forged in hate, destruction and disease
Worshiping false prophets, with mouths sewn shut we scream
Disciples to chaos, enemies to order
Rectify my wretched life, quell this heresy

Dead souls, cry from their graves
The innocent are futile, to the end that tyrants crave

No faith in the grace of man
I despise this world I see
Thrust the nails through your hands
As I watch you bleed

Crucify your God, Crucify Mankind
Crucify your God

Out of the ashes, the tainted shore
Refine the holy war for black gold
Why does this stand? What will we do?
When leaders ask for blood, violence will ensue

Lost in our faith, the heretics must die

Pick up the pieces, the pieces of our shattered faith

Dead souls cry from their graves
The innocent are futile to the end that tyrants crave

No faith in the grace of man
I despise this world I see 
Thrust the nails through your hands
As I watch you
Bleed faith in the grace of man
I despise this world I see
Thrust the nails through your hands

Crucify your God
