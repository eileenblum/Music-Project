Take back all we ever owned, and all we are
We never deserved this; we thought we came so far
The lies that run through us, define us, glorified
Iâll break free from these chains that bind

Never there when I wanted you
Never there when I needed you
I wonât fall for you, I wonât fall for you
I embrace my doom

Fallen Saviour, meet your maker
Fallen Saviour, meet your maker

I once believed in a world ruled divinely
They say that beautyâs truth, well yourâs is fucking ugly
Written in blood and sand, by hands of your inspired
Iâll set them free from these chains, Iâll set them free

Never there when I wanted you
Never there when I needed you
I wonât fall for you, I wonât fall for you
I embrace my doom

Fallen Saviour, meet your maker
Fallen Saviour, meet your maker

Break me free, from your divine being

Never there when I wanted you
Never there when I needed you
I wonât fall for you, I wonât fall for you
I embrace my doom

Fallen Saviour, meet your maker
Fallen Saviour, meet your maker

Break me free
