Straight down and six feet under
Victims to the sins of the father 
The infection has run its course
Shed not a tear, show no remorse

Taking this plague from you
Iâll show you what is true
Darkness shrouds out the light
Iâll survive this blight

Bound to this world
Longing for calm
Twisting the course of my restless soul
In war I was born
Tearing me whole
Defiling the Soul

Buried deep down inside
We will rise to purge your mind
We the forgotten, the lost, the betrayed
Cast into a world of disarray
We will not be remembered in the wake of time
Speakers of dead forming the last line

Bound to this world
Longing for calm
Twisting the course of my restless soul
In war I was born
Tearing me whole
Defiling the Soul

Defile my fractured psyche
Betray the voice of the free

Bound to this world
Longing for calm
Twisting the course of my restless soul
In war I was born
Tearing me whole
Defiling the Soul
