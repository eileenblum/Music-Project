The break of dawn
Awake from slumber
Just another wordless day
No care, no reason
Only tranquillity
Come one day, wonât you set me free?

Hold out your hands, Iâll speak to you
With open palms an unspoken truth
Reach out to me, come guide my soul
Lead me down this lonesome road
Iâve never felt so whole

Stay with me
And donât you slip away

Familiar faces, stare back at me
Dreams and fate are all a blur
No one to care, Day becomes night
The agony behind my sight

Hold out your hands, Iâll speak to you
With open palms an unspoken truth
Reach out to me, come guide my soul
Lead me down this lonesome road

Stay with me
And donât you slip away

Behind those silent eyes
Lies silent misery

Behind those silent eyes, lies misery
Hold out your hands, Iâll take you away

Please stay with me, donât you slip away
Behind those silent eyes, lies silent misery
