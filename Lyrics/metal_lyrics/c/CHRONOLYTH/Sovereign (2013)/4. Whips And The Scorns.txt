Falling out and embracing the fire
Giving in to what you desire

Tortured by the lie that you are
Life bound to a cancerous heart
Piercing eyes and a silver tongue
If thereâs no pain then itâs no fun

I am a thrall to all the Whips and the Scorns
Iâll take it all to fulfil what Iâve sworn

Fall out, embrace the fire
Give in to what you desire

Behind those distant grey eyes
Is where I put my faith in you, my faith in me
And now itâs sealed my fate

I am a thrall to all the Whips and the Scorns
Iâll take it all to fulfil what Iâve sworn

Iâll take it, take it all for you
You own me, I am yours to rule

I am a thrall to all the Whips and the Scorns
Iâll take it all to fulfil what Iâve sworn

I am a thrall to all the Whips and the Scorns
Iâll take it all to fulfil what Iâve sworn
