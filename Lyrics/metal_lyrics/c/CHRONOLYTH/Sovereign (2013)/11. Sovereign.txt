Break the Dawn

Your hopes and dreams are lying beyond,
Your own deluded perception.
Fighting the currents of the raging river
Going where the river never flows

Some believe their life is in their hands
But we donât know where the future stands
Follow ambition straight to its heart
Tearing the future apart

Shattering the Dawn
Crushed by the weight of the world
Shattering the Dawn
Crushed by the weight of the fucking world

Spending your life searching for meaning
All your endeavours amounting to nothing
Blinding yourself to reality
Binding yourself to your sovereignty

Some believe their life is in their hands
But we donât know where the future stands
Follow ambition straight to its heart
Tearing the future apart

Shattering the Dawn
Crushed by the weight of the world
Shattering the Dawn
Crushed by the weight of the fucking world

Delusion, the future is flawed
Finding hope in the light of the dawn
Crushing your false hopes
Crushing your deluded heart
Crush your hopes
Crushing your deluded heart

Shattering the Dawn

LYRICAL OVERVIEW
Whilst the album is not a concept album, a majority of the lyrics basically explore the theme of 'power', the ways in which it affects us as individuals and others in society. From the way I see the world, there is power present in politics and religion (The Heresy, Fallen Saviour, Behold the Tyrants Fall, Defiling the Soul), the media (Age of Fear), and the sometimes uncontrollability of out most extreme human emotions such as anger, fear and hate (Bitter Reflection, I Am Wrath, Condemned in the Throes of Remorse). In some cases, we see what it's like to have a complete lack of power (Silent Eyes, Whips and Scorns) and to sometimes feel so empowered that we focus so much on our dreams and goals forget the realities we and others face each and every day (Sovereign).Â 

I don't pretend to be a great lyricist, but I try to make my lyrics relatable and sort of ambiguous.
