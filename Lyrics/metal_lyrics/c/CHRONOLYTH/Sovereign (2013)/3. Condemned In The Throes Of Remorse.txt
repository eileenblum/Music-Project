Out on the edge of reality
My life branded with nothing in sight
Hostility quickly unveils
A vexation beyond the pale

Fingers encircle the dagger
Nothing more is left to say
Take one last look in my eyes
Before I murder you with no respite

I canât feel my own skin
Reserve the last judgement
I have become traitorous
Thrown to a circle of fire
Condemned in the Throes of Remorse

One stab one verdict of guilty
Two stabs too late to turn back
Blood thirty and homicidal
Condemn myself to my own end

I canât feel my own skin
Reserve the last judgement
I have become traitorous
Thrown to a circle of fire
Condemned in the Throes of Remorse

Condemned!

Come on!

I canât feel my own skin
Reserve the last judgement
I have become traitorous
Thrown to a circle of fire
Condemned in the Throes of Remorse
