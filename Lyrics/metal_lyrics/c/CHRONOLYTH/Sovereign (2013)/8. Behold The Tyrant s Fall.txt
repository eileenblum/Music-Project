Destroy my soul

This is how it begins:
Welcome to a world gone psychotic
Fire in the sky and on the streets
The leader of the newborn state
His one goal to obliterate

Contagion deployed, engulfing the race
He controls what we feel, what we hear, 
what we see, when we fear, when we die, when we bleed

Father, save us
Reclaim your power
No hope amidst the societal decay

Fanning the flames of destruction
Ignite the embers of passion
Sowing the seeds of rebellion
Whisper prayers of our salvation

Father, we pray for forgiveness
Cursing his name
We all bear witness

Control, destroy my soul
Hope lies âneath ground so cold
Behold the Tyrants Fall
As one we curse your name

We curse, curse your name

In silence, does echo
So sweetly, essence of truth
Control me, destroy me
Statue to fall
To fall

Control, destroy my soul
Hope lies âneath ground so cold
Behold the Tyrants Fall
As one we curse your name

We curse, curse your name
