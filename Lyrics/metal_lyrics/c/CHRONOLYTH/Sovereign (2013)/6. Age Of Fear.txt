Watching the world, through a hole in the wall
Forever forged into a product of the system
The people lie infatuated
Witness the devastation eating away at the inside
Watching the body count rise

Twisting perception of reality
The media loves the next atrocity

Enslave the world in your horror sphere
Enslave the world, All Hail the Age of Fear

Watching the world through a hole in the wall
Disconnected from the tragedy
We welcome stories of pain and suffering
Addicts craving the agony
My mindâs had enough, canât take this anymore
The death we all adore

Twisting perception of reality
The media loves the next atrocity

Enslave the world in your horror sphere
Enslave the world, All Hail the Age of Fear

Fear, its just another way to control

Set it off

Pray on my fear!

Watching the world forever forged

This is the age of all your fears
All hail the age of fear
