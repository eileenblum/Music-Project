Iâm looking on over at your despicable figure
Glowing with power
You think you may know me, but how could you know me
You donât fucking know yourself

Authority, itâs a bitter niche
It ainât what its cracked up to be
A different point of view, its all I can do
Whenever I think of you

Look at your own reflection
Your words lay hollow
See this Bitter Reflection
Can you feel it coming?

The weak idolize the strong (The weak idolize the strong)
But we will prove them wrong (Prove them wrong)
You have seen your Bitter Reflection
Retribution is now!

Iâll tear you apart, fucking bit by bit
You hypocrite, blinded by your ego and self-righteous notions
Nothing to say to the likes of you
You piece of shit, youâll never rule

You donât know me, youâll never know me
Youâll never know yourself
Liquidate, Detonate, Isolate, Mutilate

The weak idolize the strong (The weak idolize the strong)
But we will prove them wrong (prove them wrong)
You have seen your Bitter Reflection
Retribution is now!
