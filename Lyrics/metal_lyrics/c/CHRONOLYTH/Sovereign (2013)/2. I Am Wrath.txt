I walk alone but not apart
From the being that I once was
Have I gone insane?
To become more than words
A spiteful conduit of fear and hate
They will fear my rage

Discard mortal shell
Vengeance straight from hell
Abolish virtue
Know that this is the end
Darkness my old friend
I am all you are!

I survive when all is lost
I have walked the darkened path
Nothingâs more, nothingâs left
I Am Wrath

I was born to take this hurt
Nurtured in pain and suffering
Splinter the armour with my dishonour
Fuck your judgement, fuck your claims
Fuck all guilt, fuck it all!
I wonât be your slave!

Know that this is the end
Darkness my old friend
I am all you are!

I survive when all is lost
I have walked the darkened path
Nothingâs more, nothingâs left
I Am Wrath

Wrath, rage, hate. 
Facing the conflict, the burdens and anguish
The blood is on my hands

I survive when all is lost
I have walked the darkened path
Nothingâs more, nothingâs left
I Am Wrath

I am Wrath (Your punishment)
I am Rage (The slow descent)
I am Hate (That dwells within)
I am a monument to all your sins.  

I survive when all is lost
I have walked the darkened path
Nothingâs more, nothingâs left
I Am Wrath
