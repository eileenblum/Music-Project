The bloods left on my hands
And its up to me to wash away
Its up to me to make it right
Forget the past
What's done is done
I always said so easily
Now its time that I live my words

Living in those days that hold me back
They hold me back
They hold me down
I knew this wouldn't get me far
Just away from you full of myself
And I know
That there's something inside of me
That I can give
That I can give to you

So many times I looked away
Passing someone off but I'm just the same
Never gave you a chance
Now that's a chance
I'll never take

It won't hold me down
Again
It won't take me down
Again

I'll live my words
