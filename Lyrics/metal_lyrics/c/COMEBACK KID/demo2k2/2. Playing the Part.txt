Take a hit
Push me down
And leave me on the ground
So long
I should have seen this
Coming my way

NO- I didn't say the
World would end
I know good things come and go
And things aren't the same

Things aren't the same
With out you

Time to face all my mistakes
The curtains opened up
I'm on stage for all to see
For all to see through me
