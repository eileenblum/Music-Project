Maybe I want to take a step.
The gold's lost its shine but I know
through cracks and the holes there's a shimmer below.
Hazy glimpses force me to stay.
It all becomes real the moment I say
that I'm finally willing.
The moment I say I'm open.
I've opened up.

When I give a little, it sure takes a lot
and it's taking everything I've got.

The last straw, final effort made
to manifest what I can't explain.
I didn't want to believe.
Now it's all that I can see.

The last straw, final effort made
to manifest what I can't explain.
I didn't want to believe.
Now it's all that I can see.

Now open up a piece of me.
I've exposed myself to everything, everything
and rising up infecting me.
I'm gonna get it right.
I'm gonna let it all right in.

Someone open the gates and let me in.
The persistent grinding, now an accommodating fit.
Someone open the gate and let me in.
I've been looking for something, and maybe this is it.
Cause we just want to find a place in it all.
Cause we just want to find a place in it all.
Well I just want to find some space in it all.
I want to find some space in it
I want to find some space in it all.

The last straw, final effort made
to manifest what I can't explain.
I didn't want to believe.
Now it's all that I can see.

The last straw, final effort made
to manifest what I can't explain.
I didn't want to believe.
Now it's all that I can see.

Now it's all that I can see.
