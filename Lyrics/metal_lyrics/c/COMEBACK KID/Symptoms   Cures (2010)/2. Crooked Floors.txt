If I had the ability
I'd filter my vision. I'd rather not to see.
Take me out of the picture.
Take me out of the picture.
I don't know how to do this right.
We've hammered the point home. Now it's just a drag.
Take me out of the picture.
Take me out of the picture
or you could feed me, âcause I don't want closure.
feed me, âcause I don't want closure.

How long do I envision myself turning up on these crooked floors?
Wrestling stability. Grasping on to anchor in without a plan.

I, I guess I've gotta spin it right.
We're, we're rather mixed up in the prime.

I've gotta spin it right.
Who am I kidding? I don't have the time.
(I'm turning up late for it. You're never gonna sit and just wait for me.)

I see it backed up, set in a row.
When I have a moment I'll let you know.

Don't know if I fit the model anyway.
I'm waiting for the next...

I'm waiting for the next...

I've gotta spin it right.
We're rather mixed up in the prime.
(I'm turning up late for it. You're never gonna sit and just wait for me.)
