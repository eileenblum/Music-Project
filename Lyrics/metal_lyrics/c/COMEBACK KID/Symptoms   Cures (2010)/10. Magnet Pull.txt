It's funny I was just thinking about
how much we used to get caught up in the clouds,
questioning each other.
And then you called and you asked me where I was today.
Just like every other.
Well, I just I know that sometimes we're more distant than others.

It doesn't stop
but I don't let that hinder me.
My plan's got longevity.
It doesn't stop. Give it a shot.
Let me make the pitch, you choose.
We'll dial it in just right for you.

When you see me again don't abstain.
There's a mighty demand.
When you see me again will you recognize?
Will we both understand there's some kind of love allocated for us?

Let me know
Because the things you say
come together in a charming way.
Because words you choose
to say to me definitely elude to something.
I don't want to make believe.
Steer the boat or live the fantasy.
All the better, let the magnet pull
scratch my wounds I think you're healing me, healing me.
Because the things you say
come together in a charming way.
I don't want to make believe.
Steer the boat or live the fantasy.
All the better, let the magnet pull
scratch my wounds I think you're healing me, healing me.

The weight is falling down on us.
The weight is falling down on us.
When you see me again, don't abstain.
There's a mighty demand.
When you see me again will you recognize?
Will we both understand there's some kind of love allocated for us.
