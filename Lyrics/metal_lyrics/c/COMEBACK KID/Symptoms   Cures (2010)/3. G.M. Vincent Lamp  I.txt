When the winding starts there's an absent sun.
Better not to focus on the consequence.
See the side of the road where we lost control.
For the way, the way it went down,
now we should be gone, and stored away.
Now look at us all, passing again.
G.M. Vincent &amp; I.

Night won't let up and I need to move.
This stretch rings, it rings a familiar tune.
Back and forth unavoidable path.
We wait.
Waited for someone to save us.
When you were stuck at the crash site.
Man I didn't want to leave.
I couldn't let you go. Now we're back here to see.

When the winding starts there's an absent sun.
Better not to focus on the consequence.
See the side of the road where we lost control.
For the way, the way it went down,
now we should be gone, and stored away.
Now look at us all, passing again.
G.M. Vincent &amp; I.
Gone, and stored away.
Now look at us all,
We're passing again.
We're passing again.

Wait for someone to save us.
Wait for someone to save us.
Wait for someone to save us.
Wait for someone to save...

Do you want to come down take a look tonight?
Legs tangled under the vicious weight.
It's harder to see. Ribs under the knees.
The pain in the vision.
I wait for someone to save you.
Wait for someone to save you.
Wait for someone to save you.
Wait for someone to save...

When the winding starts there's an absent sun.
Better not to focus on the consequence.
See the side of the road where we lost control.
For the way, the way it went down,
now we should be gone, and stored away.
Now look at us all, passing again.
G.M. Vincent &amp; I.
Gone (I might as well take a look tonight)
And stored away (where you were stuck under vicious weight.)
Now look at us all (Somehow we keep coming back. We're passing again.)
