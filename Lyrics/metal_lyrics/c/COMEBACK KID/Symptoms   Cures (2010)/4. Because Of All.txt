Face and embrace.
When decisions lead up to consequence.
I force down the drain
any remnants left I let slip away.

Because of all the things I couldn't say to you.
Because of all the things I couldn't say to you.
Because of all.

Give it some time. Mulling it over.
Pulling down the shades âtil the nerves recover.
You wanna know what's really bothering me?
I'm not passive aggressive, but I had to leave.

Because of all the things I couldn't say to you.
Because of all the things I couldn't say to you.
Because of all the things I couldn't say to you.
Because of all the things I should have said.
Because of all.

Give it some time.
Mulling it over.
Pulling down shades
âtil I can settle the score.
Closer, a little more.
Closer, a little more...

Face and embrace.
When decisions lead up to consequence.
I force down the drain
any remnants left I let slip away.

Because of all the things I couldn't say to you.
Because of all the things I couldn't say to you.
Because of all the things I couldn't say to you.
Give it time, just a little closer.
Because of all the things I couldn't say to you.
Build it up just a little more.
Because of all the things I should have said to you.
Give it time, just a little closer.
Because of all the things I should have said to you.
Because of all.
Because of all the things I couldn't say to you.
