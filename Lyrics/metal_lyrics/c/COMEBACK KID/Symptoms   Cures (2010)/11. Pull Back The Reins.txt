I can't win. I'm writing it off.
My back's pinned to the wall.
Pull back, pull back, pull back the reins.
There's no doubt that all the fuss has just made a mess out of me.
Pull back. Pull back. Let the cycle run its course.

Remind me again, so I can re-learn,
give me a crash course on how this works.
I know I've given ample advice,
but as it seems the constant struggle
has made an example of me.
Has made an example out of me.

I can't win. I'm writing if off.
My back's pinned to the wall.
Let it run, let the cycle run, let the cycle
Let it all run out its course.
I'm doing more harm every time I use force.
Let the cycle run out because
when it's done there'll be something else.

I didn't ask for this, but I keep embracing it.
I'm gonna stay. I'm gonna stay.
This has chosen me.
I'm gonna stay. I'm gonna stay.
This has chosen me.
I'm gonna stay. I'm gonna stay.
I'm gonna stay. I'm gonna stay.
This has chosen me.
I'm gonna stay. I'm gonna stay.
I'm gonna stay. I'm gonna stay.
This has chosen me.
I'm gonna stay. I'm gonna stay.
