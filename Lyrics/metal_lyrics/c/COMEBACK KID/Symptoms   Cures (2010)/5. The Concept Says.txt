Follow them, bowing out. Throw me the flag, I'll take the opportunity.
Stuck in the moment, I'd pay the price if there's a possibility.
I've been caught in the standard. I dragged it through the gutter
and what I left there doesn't mean a thing.
Follow them, bowing out. I'll pay the price if there's a possibility.

I won't stay here.
I won't stay here.
I won't stay here.
I've got to make the most of mine.

Now we hold the key and no doubt we always have.
Don't you remember telling me
that's there a lifetime to make these mistakes,
and when it's almost over we'll wish we would've made more.
And when the storm is over, we wish we would've made more.

I won't stay here, I won't stay I'll take the opportunity.
Flat out I'll stick it out, senses awake, accept responsibility.
Taking it farther, I'll weed right through the clutter.
What's left behind there doesn't mean a thing.
Follow them, bowing out. I'll pay the price if there's a possibility.

Never easy to mend when all the pieces stand so far away.

Well I've been spending a long time looking in.
Feel the pulse and it's aggravating.
Push and pull while the concept stays.
And I can't get a peace of mind, and my head keeps racing.
And I can't get a peace of mind, and my head keeps racing.
I fear my options are running out.
Why isn't it getting easier to cope (to cope) without (without)?
To cope (to cope) without (without)?
And I can't get a peace of mind, and my head keeps racing.

Inventory, I throw it away.
I'd rather mistakes. I'd rather not stay.
I won't stay here. I won't stay if there's a possibility.
I won't stay here. I won't stay if there's a possibility.

I won't stay here. I won't stay I'll take the opportunity.
I won't stay here. I won't stay I'll take the op, the opportunity.
