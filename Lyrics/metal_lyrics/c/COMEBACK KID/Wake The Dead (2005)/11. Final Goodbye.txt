THIS IS MY FINAL GOODBYE
now I can say it's real
and I can feel the pain
all I do is reason
I wanna change things but I don't have a say

SCREAMING EXPECTATIONS
they've got me by the throat
I'd rather die than bleed
let's forget those things we said

can we erase from our minds
the agony of uncertainty IN OUR LIVES
well I've seen it come and go
and I've had the time
I've had the time of my life
ALL THIS
WITH YOU

trying to be strong
and I've seen the time
I've seen the time go so fast
ALL THIS
WITH YOU

THIS IS MY FINAL GOODBYE
my final goodbye

I'd rather die than bleed
let's forget the things we said
I'd rather die than bleed
let's forget the things we said
I'd rather let this die than bleed
the sun has set but still
here I am, I can't forget (CAN'T FORGET)
I'd rather let this die than bleed
the sun has set but still
here I am, you know I can't forget
