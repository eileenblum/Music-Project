I want to see you here with me
and I want to tell you what you mean to me
but I'll save this, I'll save my breath this time
I think it's almost useless
we both know, we both saw the signs
still I am ASKING WHY
ASKING WHY

I think I'm falling
I think I'm falling inside
so is this story over or has it just begun
you can only wonder and we can only wonder
these days have been too much
I hate being stuck in the inbetween

means to an end
me taking your hand and moving us ahead
I wish that it could last
cuz I still feel our past
OUR PAST
will we ever feel this way again
means to and end

close my eyes and I'll be dreaming away
if things were different I'd be able to say
I'm still here
but I'm still here
RE-THINKING MY DECISIONS
OUR DISTANCE, SEPARATION
and I'm still here
