from the start of the day
to the end of the race
we thought we had this all figured out
without a moment to waste
but we choke, we choke on our words
we waste all of our days
throw off another year
living our lives is our greatest fear

from being useless to being used
we lie awake wondering why another year is wasted
another chance to live PASSED BY US
this on the tip of our tongues
the silence of our lives
but this flame keeps burning
we'll never lay down and die

this isn't hopeless
this isn't hopeless
we'll keep on fighting until the bitter end
this isn't hopeless
this isn't hopeless
we'll carry on

forget about the boundaries
we'll leave the past behind
with every step we take
we'll finally redefine
WE'LL CARRY ON

we are the bright lights
let's not stop shining
this life will always be worth living

from the start of the day
to the end of the race
we thought we had this all figured out
without a moment to waste
WE'LL HAVE OUR WAY
WE'LL HAVE OUR WAY
WE'LL HAVE OUR WAY
we'll have our way!
