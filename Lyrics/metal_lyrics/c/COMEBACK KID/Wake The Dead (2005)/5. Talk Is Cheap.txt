your debt's escalating
whisper no regrets
run your mouth in circles
chewing, chewing the flesh

(your talk is cheap) and it's going nowhere
think you're out changing the world
choking on each word (you spit)

those basement dwelling days are so far from me
moving mountains in your head
buying into all that's said

(dive, sink, drown)
caught up in this lie
(dive, sink, drown)
caught up in this life outside your own

(your talk is cheap) and it's going nowhere
think you're out changing the world
choking on each word (you spit)

convinced of your false visions
(you're the sucker)
KEEP TALKING
keep talking away
KEEP TALKING

cashing in all your petty words
keep talking away
it's so far from me
living like you're dead
