I was looking forward to this day for so long
I had it all planned out
I was hoping it'd all work out
I was losing patience
you know it's never been my best trait
counting minutes, hours, counting days

then it dawned on me
unpredictabilty
I told myself everything's just fine
you worry too much, it's gonna eat you alive

I was looking forward to this day for so long
I had it all planned out
I was hoping that it would all work out
would all work out

now I feel exposed
like a black light on the wall
in a darkened room
all the dirt appears
you can see my fears
I don't want to let my guard down

you know I never had the feeling
that you would prey on my insecurities
because I never had the feeling
that you would prey on these insecurities I have

why is this wait taking so long
why is this wait taking so long
counting minutes, hours, counting days
I'm losing patience

don't think this means I'm walking away
don't think this means I'm walking
I won't let fear get the best of me
now it's up to me, I wouldn't change a thing
I won't let fear get the best of me
DON'T THINK THIS MEANS I'M WALKING AWAY
now it's up to me, I wouldn't change a thing
DON'T THINK THIS MEANS I'M WALKING AWAY
