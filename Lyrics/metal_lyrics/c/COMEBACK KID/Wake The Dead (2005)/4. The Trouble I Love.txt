So here I go again
We had our chance
half smile, you look my way
run now and some might say

We all die alone.
We all die alone.
We all die alone.

And I'll never forget what killed us
she screams to be alone
Going over it in my head
What's left, what's left to say

We all die alone.
We all die alone.
We all die alone.

Can we ever take back the nights
the nights we wasted on another fight
Does this really all end tonight
Does this really all end tonight
This is the rest
This is the rest of our lives (alone)
Can we ever take back the nights (alone)
Does this really all end tonight? (alone)

TAKE BACK OUR NIGHTS
TAKE BACK OUR NIGHTS
TAKE BACK OUR NIGHTS
Take back our nights!
