well that's what I thought
you always finish before we start
don't have to say a word
living for these moments

who's been let down
who's been dragged down
been through this so many times before
eats me inside
out of this world you know
trapped inside so many nights alone

I have to know
WHAT'S INSIDE YOUR HEART
WHAT'S INSIDE YOUR HEART
promises have been made
I've been let down
what's inside your heart

we search and we search for
the answers worth fighting for
GO!
I have to get out, break out
I can't be you

who's been let down
who's been dragged down
been through this so many times before
eats me inside
out of this world you know
trapped inside so many nights alone

seems now I'm in too deep
and it's never going to be the same
this is me, take it or leave
cuz it's never going to feel the same
I can't be you
