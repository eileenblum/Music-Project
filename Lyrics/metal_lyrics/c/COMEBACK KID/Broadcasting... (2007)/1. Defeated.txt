Here I've been going over reasons
And you keep looking over my shoulder
Hold me now to these promises I haven't made
Time will tell just how much you'll act on what
Youâve said

Either way, my mind's been made up for me
Either way, it's wearing me thin because
Even when, resisting instinctively
Even then, I find myself broken and I'm kneeling
Defeated

I've been exhausted for too long
Wide open, so listen
When you keep charging
This blood has a beat that's running, it's running out
My blood has a beat that's running, it's running out
Our blood has a beat that's running out

Either way, we're treating this carelessly
Either way, it's wearing me thin because
Even when, resisting instinctively
Even then, I find myself broken and I'm kneeling
Defeated

I'm too exhausted for the long haul
And I'm kneeling defeated
