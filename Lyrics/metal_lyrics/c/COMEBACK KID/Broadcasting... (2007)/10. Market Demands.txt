The masses said
By popular demand
Cheer me on now closer to the edge
I didn't think I could follow through
But I did out of convenience

Well I'm looking at the bigger picture
And I figure this one's insignificant enough right?
Compromised. Getting used to it
Compromises. We're used to it
Compromises we're so good at making
Lets do it again

The sharks came out to play
Told us how much to pay
It may not be so grand
But we can't have it all

The masses said
By popular demand
Cheer me on now closer to the edge
Unmotivated. Not willing enough to resist
We'd rather keep it simple, fast, convenient

Compromised. Getting used to it
Compromises. We're used to it
Compromises we're so good at making
Lets do it again
But we canât have it all
