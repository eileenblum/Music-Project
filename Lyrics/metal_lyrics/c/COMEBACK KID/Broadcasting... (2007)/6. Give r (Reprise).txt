Fully unaware, already on route
All the way there
Follow or lose your way, hurry!

What I don't know leaves me wanting it more
I'm ready now more than ever
Felling the shot going through my chest
Hurry! Follow or lose your way

What I don't know leaves me wanting more

This suspense will ruin me
Urgency, it's getting the best of me
