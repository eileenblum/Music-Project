I wonder why
Lately I've been thinking of a time
Product of our surroundings and we held up the sign
I loved, I learned, we sang all the words
Wednesday mornings we would always sit in the
Biggest room

One of those days still in my mind
And it's always stayed with me
Watching from a distance and someone said
She screamed relentlessly from visions she had

Just as real to me as it was to you
A decade down the line who knew
Impressionable minds were told
I wish I could go back just to know
'cause it was undeniable
All my peers they seemed so credible

One of those days still in my mind
And it's always stayed with me
Sunset, sky turning red
Fascinated by what he said
This boy's in agony from visions he had

Speculate intentions and bring the attention to the source
Years ago I said a prayer and asked that I would
Never have to see
I'm hardly ever reminded
Surely itâs because I decide
I'm inviting as often, but every so oftenâ¦
