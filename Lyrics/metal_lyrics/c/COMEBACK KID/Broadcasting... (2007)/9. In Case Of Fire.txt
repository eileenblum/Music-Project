They had finally some to grips
And the pieces somehow fit
Could it be?
Yet something's lingering
âWhat is it?â

At first she had her eyes down staring at the floor
Uncertain, she lifted them to find the words
Shouting from the wall
Like a devil on her shoulder readingâ¦

In case of fire, leave the area immediately
Avoid it, yourself from any more grief
In case of fire leave the area immediately
Avoid it, disappear but please don't jeopardize

âWhat is it? It's wearing me out asking this!â he said
âI refuse to be left in the dark
I've been ringing out every last drop
Ringing out everything I am
It's out for you
Everything I am
There's no disguise
Would you just trust me this time?â

He always swore it wasâ¦
Swearing unconditional
And she's ready to call it off

âWhat is it? I'm getting so scared asking this.â
