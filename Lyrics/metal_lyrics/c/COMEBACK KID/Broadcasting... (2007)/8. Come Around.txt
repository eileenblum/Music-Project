I saw you on the fence
Whistle of the current's getting louder now
Disconnecting
Now is the time
Just barely hanging by your fingertips
Disconnecting

Surrounded by your protected shell
You better get out, cause' I can't do this for you
This strategy's weakening the design
Stalling and dragging your feet way behind

Given the circumstances, I won't let it go
Because I remember when
You were so convincing
Now just procrastinating

One more day, one more night
Keep it up kid you'll never decide
What to say, where to turn, where to go

That is something I can't say for you
