I was wrong, but I just can't
I won't acknowledge it
I couldn't help but to admire
Step in a place where nothing else matters at all
Suspicion leaked when they called
Hail on my head if I tell

But maybe I can fix this quick
I'll cover up while it's getting closer to me
But I can't gauge how much to hide
Panicking!

Underestimate the risk
Overconfidence
This time I hit and missed
Overconfidence

It all depends on the delivery
It's coming my way and I'm just hoping to survive
I'll have them know
I'll give them something
Something to hold on to
They'll never make me scrape
Scrape from the bottom of this deep hole
My hand are trembling
My body is shivering

I've been exposed
Filtered through a maze of rumored facts
All I've withheld coming to the surface
Hailing on me
