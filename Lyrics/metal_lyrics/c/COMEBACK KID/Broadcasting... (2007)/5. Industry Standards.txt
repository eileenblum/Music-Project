So the sun has been going down earlier
But my days just keep getting longer
Through the noise, hanging for inspiration
My eyes getting wider but still

None of my questions have answers yet
But I'm not deterred from asking them
I'll celebrate unaccompanied
Discouraged or not

It's comforting to hear
But then there's other agendas coming into play
Distractions, keeping us away

From the untainted face of expression
Disturbing the music's directions
Through the noise, hanging for inspiration
My eyes getting wider but still

None of my questions have answers yet
But I'm not deterred from asking them
I'll celebrate unaccompanied
Discouraged or not

Would you turn it up so I can hear?
'cause it's reassuring when I can hear it
Distractions can't keep us away

Hanging for inspiration
Distractions can't keep us away
