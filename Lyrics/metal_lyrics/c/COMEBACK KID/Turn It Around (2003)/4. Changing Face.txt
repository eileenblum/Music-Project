What have you become?
Now you fight a losing war.
I look at this and it's all a mess.
Seems like anything that's real, I just can't see.
I can't see the truth in you.
I can't see the real in you.
Show your face and take the world.
But instead, you have to fit the mould.
With this front you're losing respect.
I know you're better than that.
Your time is running out.
Your front is wearing thin.
So how long can you live like this.
I know this isn't who you really are.
Do you want to break free,
from all the lies you put in front?
Now take them back.
Do you want to break free?
I don't need a crew, to validate myself.
You're all the same.
Your indentity, fading fast.
