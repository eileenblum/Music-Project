How far would you go to satisfy?
Everything that you long for
And you wanted so bad
It seemed to take over you world
Nothing in this life is ever free
You've heard a billion times
Still there's a gap haunting you
Questioning the air you breath
Questioning the truth

To find substance
To find a truth
Something absolute in a stone cold world
I guess it's easier said than done
But there's a life that goes beyond
Now all I can do is share
What I have with you

Everytime you walk away
Everytime I'll be the same
That's a choice to respect
That's a choice I accept

But I'll still be here
I'll always be here
I'll always...
