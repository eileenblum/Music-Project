Last night I thought I heard, heard the sound of hope.
I never knew what to expect, but still I had a goal.
And last night something fazed me.
Today things seems so clear.
The wait. The weight. The listening.
And everything's so clear.
I guess it's something less than what I hoped for.
It turned out something less,
but you seemed so content with what you have.
You're so content and all I want is more.
Now I think I'll never have,
and I'll never see, and I'll never know.
Make a way to break the fall.
I'm taking it from the start.
Don't set me back.
