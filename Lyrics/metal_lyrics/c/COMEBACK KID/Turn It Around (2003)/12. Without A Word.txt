In an effort to win
I lost it all
At a standstill
How easily it's said

Now eat your words
Everything that I wanted to say
It seemed to die
It all seemed to die on my lips

Another broken heart
Another hit and miss
And when nothing else is easy
How easily it's said

Words so easy to be said
Harder I try harder I fall
Words so easy to be said
Competition it seems so usless
Words so easy to be said
With an ending all to predictable
Words so easy to be said

And once again I've lost it all
