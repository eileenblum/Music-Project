Every time you point the blame,
I'm left to clean the mess.
With every single word that's said,
I'm left to clean the mess you're leaving.
You can have your power trip.
And you can call it truth.
No one cares and no one hears you.
Bite your tongue.
You've said enough.
You're living for yourself.
Can't see the difference between.
This game we'll never win.
