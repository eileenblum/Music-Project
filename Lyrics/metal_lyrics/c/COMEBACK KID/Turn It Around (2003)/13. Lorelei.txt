You told me I better walk away.
Just like to me to never hear what you say.
Tempting fate.
The story unfolds.
Should have seen it.
You told me I better walk away.
And just like me to never hear what you say.
Twisted fate.
The story is told.
Never say never, cause you don't know what lies ahead.
Better to follow your heart.
Mistakes comes from choices made.
Does it mean no damage done?
Not a chance in the world.
Cause there was never a day that went by without regret.
Turn it around.
The past still haunting me.
I gotta give it away.
I made a choice for me.
Just one mistake and it's haunting.
I saw someone never wanted to be.
The story's told and it's haunting.
