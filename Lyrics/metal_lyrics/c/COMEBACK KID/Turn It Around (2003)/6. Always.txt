Never thought it would be this way.
But this gap between us grew, we grew two separete ways.
I never set out to tear this down, cause in my heart it's worth,
it's worth so much more, than I could ever show.
It's worth more than I can show, with words that I can't say.
The pain is wearing thin, how did this fall apart.
I'm reminded of a time, I thought you'd never slip away.
Was I to quick to run away?
You never know what you have, until it's gone away.
All I have, all I would give,
if there were some way to save this.
Always knew your name.
Some things never change.
