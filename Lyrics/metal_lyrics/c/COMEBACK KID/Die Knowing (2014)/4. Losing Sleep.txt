[feat. Pauly Correia]You told me once, back at it again always the same with it, I canât stop you
Well maybe itâs true for you, but Iâm not seeing it. You wanna live with it, but Iâve got no room

Well maybe itâs true for you, and I wonât stop you
Give me some space to breathe, âcause Iâve got no room
Well maybe itâs true for you, and I canât stop you
Give me some space to breathe, âcause I canât rest here with you

Iâve gotta be reasonable but itâs all become too predictable
Iâm letting it ride, but Iâm not losing sleep. This future is not up to you.

Rise up for the innocent. Tried it on but it didnât fit.
Guard down, thereâs a subtle flame .Subtle moment to have your say
Lining up opposite of me. What a moment of clarity, a shining moment to sayâ¦For what?
I know, so what!
Iâm not about it, you can have it

Iâve gotta be reasonable but itâs all become too predictable
Iâm letting it ride, but Iâm not losing sleep. This future is not up to you.

Iâm not losing sleep

Rise up for the innocent. Tried it on but it didnât fit.
Guard down, thereâs a subtle flame. Subtle moment to have your say.
