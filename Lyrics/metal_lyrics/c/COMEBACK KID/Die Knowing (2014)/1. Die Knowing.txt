I was searching the streets where we lost our stride, making our way through the earth
My heart was marching to a different beat while my choices were making it harder to find
You took the straight and narrow, prying eyes watching from overhead
I took the other, down, but recovered and I would do it all over and over again

Disappointment, dedication
Elevated catastrophe

Die knowing that you lived to find
Die knowing where your friendships lie
Die knowing you gave nothing less
Die knowing it was imminent
Die knowing what your failures find
Die knowing where your friendships lie
Die knowing you gave nothing less
Die knowing it was imminent
