I felt the pressure building up pushing from every side
You didnât even mind
It took the rest of me to stop and say no more
You didnât even mind

Am I just reading it all wrong? Too many voices overtaking and Iâm misplacing
Wasting this precious time, avoiding signs
Iâm in too deep to quit and thereâs just too many good reasons that keep me sucked in
Though barely scraping by, you didnât flinch at all
I spent the rest of my earnings on just feeling numb
I never meant to keep putting this on you
Itâs all wrong, Itâs alright

When itâs all gone bad and Iâve probably lost it
The world could die, but youâd survive

How many faced with, how many torn
I see how much I wasted while you never turned
