[feat. Scott Wade]Built to land hard: thatâs exactly where we left it
Slippery down-slide, and you could never fake it
I apologize, so excuse me
Slow we pacify, come in full swing

Silence - Maybe itâll seem like itâs gone
Vacant - Knowing what you want when you canât
Balance - I could never stress it enough: Of all the right choices, I start with the wrong ones

Still falling, reckless and on again
Rumor mills got me locked in, killing time, just hope it doesnât kill me

What is free? What is free when you wonât stop watching me?
Everything I do is adding up â¢ Now Iâm taking the warning
Everywhere I goâ¦I canât avoid it, but I can control it
Everything I doâ¦I canât avoid it
Everywhere I goâ¦ I canât avoid it, but I can control it
