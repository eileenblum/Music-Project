Stormy summer day is in the way of all the couldâve been's and shouldâve been's
How do you anticipate this distorted tragedy
Things like this donât just go away, things like this tear your family
And I admit I canât relate, believe me I wonât walk away

âCause when the circumstance holds you back...Lower the line

Harness, focus Your broken vessel
When you paint that picture; When youâre all shook up

Harness, focus; âCause you know it wonât die in your sleep

You finally said it out loud,
Stormy summer day is in the way of all the couldâve been's and shouldâve been's
How do you anticipate this distorted tragedy
Maybe youâre not dead though this could be the end of your world
But this door isnât sealed the black hole might tear if you fight
And Iâma be around until you see the light of day

I can see your pain
I donât see you shaded in a different light
