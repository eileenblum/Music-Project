Beyond our love is the truth and it comes between us (YEAH!)
Beyond our love is the proof and it passes through us (YEAH!)
Until the wool has been pulled from our eyes, I canât acknowledge if I keep denying
Until the moment when we realize, process all this, going in blind.
All day long forcing me to come to terms with reality.
All along forcing me to find my peace with insanity.

(Whoh-Oh-Oh...Whoh-Oh-Oh)

Lifeâs got a funny way of showing the hardest part is knowing when to give up, when to go.
Lifeâs got a funny way of showing, now you have to choose between your heart and what you know.
Uncertain, unsettled, I was too involved, I was too close
