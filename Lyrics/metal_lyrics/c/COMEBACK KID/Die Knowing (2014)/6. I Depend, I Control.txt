We repeat it.

Repeat. Our habits form
I donât know if you can see, Iâll shed a bit of honesty
This feeling, never had before. Repeating and the habits form
Such...an ominous mystery, Crave...that certain serenity
We repeat it

Sober even, patterns form. Giving less, expecting more.
Something you canât recreate. Something I cannot debate.
Such...an ominous mystery. Crave...that certain serenity

I depend, I depend, I control!
