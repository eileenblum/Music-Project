Adamant, adamant. Tunnel vision view. Wasnât gonna pull the plug, had to see it through
What a bright idea that wouldnât quit. Somewhat empty but I took a healthy sip
Then I tripped when it got harder to see in over my head and now itâs hanging over me

Iâve only made things worse today
And everyone, everythingâs in my way
Adding insult to injury. Are you happy, are you happy now?
Can I tip the scale? Well maybe Iâm just bound to fail
Adding insult to injury. Are you happy, are you happy now?

Adamant, adamant. Tunnel vision view
Backed up in a corner; Now Iâm stuck because I should know better
Take the wrap, suck it up because I should know better

Sad to say, couldnât make the connection
A lot of build up, but it only took a second to bring this whole thing down.
Backed up in a corner now Iâm stuck

Adamant, adamant. Tunnel vision view
Backed up in a corner, now Iâm stuck because I should know better
Take the wrap, suck it up because I should know better
