Havenât been here before, seeing is believing Youâre up, not the type to settle grieving.
And while weâre bracing for it, youâre the same, handling, and your life is showing.
Are you afraid anymore? How are you preparing forâ¦?
Check back in a month, over-think it too much. Weâre waiting, youâre facing, and bracing for what?
Are you afraid anymore? The light that surrounds you, your faith reinforced

Expect more, and brace forâ¦

Unconditional source of sole sincerity and you withstand that force with your own clarity
Iâve missed out before, weâll miss out again But the sentiment stays Your family remains
No time is enough, reality strikes and itâs never enough
Are you afraid anymore? The light that surrounds you, your faith reinforced

Expect more, and brace forâ¦

There is always that sentiment, the unconditional weâre fighting for
There is always that sentiment, the unconditional weâre living for
When time is what we need it seems we never get enough
And this time itâs what you need, it seems like things are looking up
