I wrote it off before the story began and it came down to this, I canât pretend
Youâve been reckless, and lately I can tell by your front
Youâve misled me before, now I know what you want

Iâve seen versions of you, theyâre becoming impossible to follow (well, youâre something else)
Wasted arrows
Two worlds drawn apart; Was it desperation that pushed you over? (I can see youâre not lucking out, man)
Wasted arrows

Prey on the weakness

You put out the bait youâd try anything
I resented you âcause you left me out to dry
