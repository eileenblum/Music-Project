Shout out in the morning, calling out in repeat
Medicineâs motivation, couldnât keep me asleep
Got a good imagination, always twisting the gears
Battle miscommunication, answer-less, it appears I've

And Iâve got nowhere else, and I drift away
Left just in time to get peace of mind, now I divide
Reasons heavy in rotation, stories starting to bleed
I can see your dedication, and it matters to me
But I feel like Iâve gotta retain, but thereâs a little bit of something in the way

I donât wanna sink in
Iâve been led astray, I retaliate
I donât wanna sink in
Iâve been led astray, I retaliate

Steady one foot in, held the other back
With the other back I couldnât hit that stride, now I divide
Thereâs a point, I saw it breaking That I needed to hear
A formidable reaction, âcause it matters to me
Now I feel like Iâve gotta retain, but thereâs a little bit of something in the way

I donât wanna sink in
Iâve been led astray, I retaliate
I donât wanna sink in
Iâve been led astray, I retaliate
Because I donât wanna sink in
So I donât let it sink in

Got nowhere elseâIâve been led astray
Iâve got nothing elseâI retaliate

Iâm letting it in, Iâm ready if you are
