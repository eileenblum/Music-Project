The rain, inspired by your tears, is crying
By all their youth and dancing around,
the crowd's with you at last sleeping

Let your sorrow flow through my eyes
and never dry out
Then separate yourself into seven colours,
so that you may rise up to the sky
and let your core see your rebirth
Let the moons fall in love with you
And with every single moon

let a brand new day begin

Time the stealer of beauty
has stuck you with an arrow
You're bleeding
All your self-confidence and jealousy
concealed in the debris within
Flow! Flow through my eyes
and never stop crying woman!
