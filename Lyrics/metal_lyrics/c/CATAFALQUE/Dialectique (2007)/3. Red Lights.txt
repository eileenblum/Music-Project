You! The woman wandering
under the red lights
The sidewalks of these streets
are used to your high heels
Are you truly in myself
or am I your other half

You! The woman crying
and hiding in darkness
Though there is a lot loving you,
why this weariness
Are you truly in myself
or am I your other half

You must believe in me
You must believe in you
It is me in the clouds
that are around you
You're not alone! I'm alone!
You are stolen from me
My heart is stolen by you
I'll never forget about you
You are not alone! I'm alone!

You! The woman embroidering
and writing pain on my core
My silverâ¦  my bladeâ¦
You are to die for
Are you truly in myself
otherwise  I'm your other half

You can't deny
the emptiness in your heart
Temptation in your past
You're made for love by my God
and I am for you!
