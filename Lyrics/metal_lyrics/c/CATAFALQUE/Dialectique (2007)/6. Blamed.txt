From the scars on my forehead
it was understood you had left
From my swollen eyes, my tearsâ¦
Unwanted wait stuck my inside
Only your name is left
it's carved into souls

If the end is being without you
I'm the whipped angel
Oh my ears! Don't hear
My eyes! Don't see

If the end is being without you
And Iâm just a stranger
The end is your loss
And youâre my endless

I fooled no one
My ending is near
I blamed no one
I'm the one to blame!

Complaining is meaningless now
Stand up and go on! Breathe!
What's out there is not air,
though it only smells of vanishing
