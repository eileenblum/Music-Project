You were the only light
in the dark of the night
The only truth inside of me,
the source of lifeâ¦
I embraced loneliness
to stay with you
I defended the darkness
from the mystery of your light

You were the only night in life
The truth in my lifeâ¦
I defended misery
to be able to stay in the light
You were the only night in life
The source in meâ¦
I embraced the black
to be able to be alone with you

My side is not safe anymore
and it could not be after you!
I defended loneliness to stay in the dark
I embraced the light from your mystery

I do not fear disappearance
I do not fear existence
