I wouldn't realize
that this could happen
You abandoned this world
that's full of lies

You left your dreams to me
You left this burden
Was that a punishment to yourself
or just for me?

But now I'm standing
on a desolate hill
and weeping at the damned truth
that I lost you

Why? You're laying down
the place within roses
I believe your innocent soul
has ascended to heaven
There is just one memory
left from you
The crimson dust of your bed
in my hands
Lack of yours and its grief,
hidden in my tears

Ashes to ashes
dust to crimson dust
Your bed turns into red
from your hair
Thousands of stars
on your shadow in the sky
Moonlight  is the blaze of your eyes

But now I'm standing
on a desolate hill
And winds are whispering
your name into my ears
