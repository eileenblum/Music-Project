The world continues to shrink
You are in it or not
I do know
everyone has to feel loneliness
Are we the ones who create this
or am I just swirling in the air
what is already there
together with all the pain

I can steal the pain in your heart
I steal in the running night
I swim in the lakes of tears on your face
Be the only sound in silence
and let me be your voice forever
