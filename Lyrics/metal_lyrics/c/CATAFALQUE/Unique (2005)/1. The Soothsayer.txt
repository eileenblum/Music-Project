Let me tell you the truth of it all
He sees the future of the world
No more lies in his eyes
As pure as new bride

He has strenth in his mind
Enough as destroy all mankind
He has a fate like others
He tries to save us from this life

In the dark temples of evil
Demons wander among us
He saw all of the heathens
Darkness never takes his soul and mind

Soothsayer's staying silent
As the painful scream of moth
Who it gnaws the rotten wood

He had injured nobody else
He should prove who he as
We would learn what he meant
When he came back as the destiny

In the dark temples of evil
Demons wander among us
He saw all of the heathens
Darkness never takes his soul and mind
