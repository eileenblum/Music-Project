I am ancient land
I was your lost dream

This land created own Gods
Where the dreams flashed up
She existed within sins
They obey to their own fears

She was there since many years
She would writhe when her nation weeps
She is still there to see we kill each of us
She would avenge while she will distrust

She would see our bloody battles
She heard the voice of scythes
She would give us the food to satisfy
She took our souls to purify

I had burnt a torch
With your never-ending flame
To our end we approach
We will never be within shame

I am ancient land
I was your lost dream
Hallows you when
Your eyes still bleed

I am ancient land
She's your lost dream
Hallows you when
Your heart is still bleeding
