Darkness breeds in my eyes
While the love becomes, innocence dies
Until you arise to my spirit
I couldn't realise how bright your eyes
(Like me)

Lust I want, blood I drink
Love I feel, they are yours
Hate I hate, love I love
Death I kill, more and more

I waited for you to love me each day I lived
But there was just one way to exit
And to die to reach my pains
I am in a maze within dark reflections

Lust I want, blood I drink
Love I feel, they are yours
Hate I hate, love I love
Death I kill, more and more

Life appears me, as an illusion
My breast was sealed by evil
No more innocence, no temptation
I am in maze, my precious

Lust I want, blood I drink
Love I feel, they are yours
