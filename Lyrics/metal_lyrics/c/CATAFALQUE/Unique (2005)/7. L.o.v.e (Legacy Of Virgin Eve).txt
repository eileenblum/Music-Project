From Adam to still unborns
First for Eve, last for who knows
Most unbelievable thing in the soul
Mother of all sins, starter of pain
Flows from heart to veins
Like the poison in the fang of a snake

In the life or in the death
Enjoy your love at all times
In loneliness or when you fall in love
It never ends even you die

Love like yours and mine
Both of us will shine
In a childhood or in youth
Crying or dying and killing
Suffering or leaving and going away
No-one can hide, no-one ever will

In the life or in the death
Enjoy your love at all times
In loneliness or when you fall in love
It never ends even you die
