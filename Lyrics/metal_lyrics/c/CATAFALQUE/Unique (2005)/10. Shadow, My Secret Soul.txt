Out of the dark
I have another soul, reflecting to the wall
Just my shadow always follows me
From the weak light of candle
Through the cold light of moon

When darkness covered me around
An eternal friend, I found
Onto my head when the light comes
Sorrow ends by Hyde becomes
Won't you ever forsake to follow?
Won't you never hurt my hear?
Don't you ever leave me alone?
Don't you ever forgive me?

Into the light
Following someone's behind
Through to dawn of every morning
Shadows hide, never find
Until the sunlight shining

Over the wall I ever saw you
Behind the curtains of the night
In cascaded darkness I wait for you
Since many years of light

Won't you ever forsake to follow?
Won't you never hurt my hear?
Don't you ever leave me alone?
Don't you ever forgive me?

Out of the dark
I have another soul, reflecting to the wall
Just my shadow always follows me
From the weak light of candle
Through the cold light of moon

Into the light
Following someone's behind
Through to dawn of every morning
Shadows hide, never find
Until the sunlight shining
