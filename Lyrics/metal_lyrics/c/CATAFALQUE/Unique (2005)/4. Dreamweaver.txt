When you close your eyes, my mother said
You can imagine, you can draw your dreams
And also you could see me

Above the clouds I've got a throne
To watch the people on the earth
Plans raising, mercy has gone
Dreams ending, no more

How do you stay alive
Don't you come closer to me
You got a place near me
To reign all eternity

I am the one who starts the life
From the east
I am the one who ends the life
From the west

I am the one who shapes the nature
I am the one who grows the trees
I am the one who creates the rivers
I am the one who reigns the dreams
I am the one who paints the skies blue
I am the dreamweaver
