In the nights swallowed by darkness
You sleep down in your unlit room
Cold tears were running down from your cheek

Remember and never ever forget
Just a little prayer through your ears
That takes our your soul from the deep
When the archangel touched your shoulders

Touch me, it makes me happy
Embrace me, it takes me to the light
Kiss me, it makes me stronger
Save me I know only you could break my chains

I don't sell my soul to those
Who are fed by nightmares
I trust you forever with my prayers
Those are the words coming from my heart

Remember and never ever forget
Just a little prayer through your ears
That takes our your soul from the deep
When the archangel touched your shoulders

Touch me, it makes me happy
Embrace me, it takes me to the light
Kiss me, it makes me stronger
Save me I know only you could break my chains
