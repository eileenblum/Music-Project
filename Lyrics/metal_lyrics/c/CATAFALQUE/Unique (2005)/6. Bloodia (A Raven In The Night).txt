The flame of the night was shinning in your eyes
There on your lips, a bloody smile
Full of fear and you were so scared
You were sitting down, next to the wall

Merciless as a wild wolf
And glamorous as a wild rose
I have the rage and lust in my eyes
Bloodia

A raven flies away through
Never taste the death
In the deepness of the night
Instead of eternal life
Maybe it carries your soul
For ages suffered and tired
To the light of dark fright
Never sleep never leave me alone
In my all dark dreams
Never tell me a lie never and ever
And all screams in my sleep
Nights cries out your name
Your name echoes in my brain
Always

Merciless as a wild wolf
And glamorous as a wild rose
I have the rage and lust in my eyes
Bloodia

Sunlight's gone far away
Hid yourself under wings of the night
Tastes all desires behind black veil
You, always real flame of the night

Blood is the life, blood is water of the flesh
Nights always became cold, will be colder
Empress of the night never likes the sun
Hides into the night before it comes down
