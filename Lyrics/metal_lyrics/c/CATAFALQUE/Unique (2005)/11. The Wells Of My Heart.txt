My tears flowing towards the sea of sadness
God sent us onto the earth
We all began crying, since our birth

I heard too many melodies for a lifetime
And listened the silence of the nights
There was always the sadness in my heart
Overflows by the cries

Eyes are wells of the heart
Every soul is a river
And it ends where it flows through the ocean
Ocean is the eternity made by silver

Every lullaby I heard
Is the messenger of a new born
It cries...
Tears flow from its coral eyes

Secret of the soul appears
When the veil of my mystery opens
Shows me the sadness &amp; the sorrow
Deep inside my heart

Eyes are wells of the heart
Every soul is a river
And it ends where it flows through the ocean
Ocean is the eternity made by silver
