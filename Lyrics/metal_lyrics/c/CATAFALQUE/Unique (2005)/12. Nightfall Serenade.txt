Sun downs, moon shines
Nightfall rises to the skies
Stars shine, night comes down
Black as if bereaved of light

I'm dying there
Whenever you will die
Death will take us together
Over nightfall

I'm dying there
Whenever you will die
Death will take us together
Over nightfall

Life has taken back all my loves
From my heart and my soul
I have never fallen on my knees
I'll never see the nightfall

I was an island in the middle of the ocean
Till the death discovers me
I was the darkness in the sun
Till the moonlit recovers me

I'm dying there
Whenever you will die
Death will take us together
Over nightfall
