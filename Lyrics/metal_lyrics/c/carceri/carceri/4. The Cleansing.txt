I begin the cleansing 
To filter my putrid mind 
No longer can I stand 
The creeping decay 

Lunacy gropes within 

Hacking at my flesh 
The metallic taste of blood 
To regain that which is lost 
Purification through .... PAIN 

I slowly turn the blade 
Push through against the angst 
Inflicting mortal wounds 
Purification through .... PAIN 

I shall pay 

For sins against the inner order 
That I committed - So I betrayed 
The fire within myself 
No remorse for the weak 

Release me 
Will not give in 
Strenght regained 
Scarred and battered 
The will remains 
Breathing stops 
Heartfailure 
Fading light 
I will not mourn 

I begin the cleansing 
To filter my putrid mind 
No longer can I stand 
The creeping decay 
My vision is cleared 
Completely renewed 
I again see the truth 
While hacking away
