The staining all around 
The stench of your presence 
Infecting above and below 
Untill you have it all 

A violence divine 
Your violence - Bred mine 
The remnants - Of torture 
Of unwrath _ And lies 
You prey on - My weakness 
When I've fallen low 
Your friendship and guidance 
For slavery and gold 

The eye of god is upon us 
A silent watcher of hate 
The eye of god is upon us 
As we destroy his name 

A firestorm long waiting 
On the verge of breaking 
A single torch now burning 
The first of the growing hordes 

Clear this twisted landscape 
Deface his impure ground 

Firefrenzied followers 
Of the new church of reason 
Dead bodies stacked up high 
We'll leave only ashes 

The eulogy now sung 
Your eternal reign 
Ends on this holy day 

A violence divine 
Your violence - Bred mine 
The remnants - Of torture 
Of unwrath _ And lies 
You prey on - My weakness 
When I've fallen low 
Your friendship and guidance 
For slavery and gold 

A solemn godshead 
Fragile, demented 
Tears flow from heaven 
For a world that is lost 
It's freedom regained 
Our blood for blood 
The new world order 
For a world you forgot
