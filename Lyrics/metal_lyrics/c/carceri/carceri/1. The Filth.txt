I am alone 
Can't stand the wall of force 
Your forcefed filth 
Pushed smiling through my throat 

Numbing me - Your mental destruction 
Flooding me - Without restraints 
Feverish - Mental rejection 
Killing me - Without restraints 

No release 
It's all around me 
No path for my escape 
Cannot breathe 
The hunt is on 
No place to hide 
There is no peace for me 

I am alone 
Can't stand the wall of force 
Your forcefed filth 
Pushed smiling through my throat 

Flooded by 
Your machinations 
The growing piles 
Stacked far to high 
Erase my feelings 
Replacement of the self 
Marching orders 
Insert the doctrine 
Destruction of the self 

I cannot help 
These divergent thoughts 
I have no choice 
Must stray from the lighted path 
I will revive 
The human soul you've slain 
Your choking filth 
Has lost it's grip on me 

You've lost your grip on me 
No escaping 

Cannot breathe 
The hunt is on 
No place to hide 
There is no peace for me 

I am alone 
Can't stand the wall of force 
Your forcefed filth 
Pushed smiling through my throat 

Flooded by 
Your machinations 
The growing piles 
Stacked far to high 
Erase my feelings 
Replacement of the self 
Marching orders 
Insert the doctrine 
For my destruction
