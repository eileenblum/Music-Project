Founded in biblical times 
Writings to the blind 
For they shall follow as done before 
Color has no place in this 
Reformation blinding all 
Vile destruction, shades of grey 
Leaving one man - Cannibal 

Eating me 
Unable to see 
Cataract 

I will suffer again 
Recreating gods creation 
Leaving in all the failures 

I can not 
I can not see 

Cataract 
Blinding me - Numbing me 
Cataract 
Blinding me - Soothing me 
Giving me atonement 
For he was my failure 

My Failure 

Your extinction 

Founded in biblical times 
Extermination 
For they follow as done before 

Killing me 
Spreading like a plague 
The truth for you a fucking tale 
It's time to purge you of sin 
Destroying your gods 
And you his masterpiece 
Reclamation of the throne 
I will conquer 
I alone 

I will harvest

Vile destruction, shades of grey 
Leaving one man - Alone
