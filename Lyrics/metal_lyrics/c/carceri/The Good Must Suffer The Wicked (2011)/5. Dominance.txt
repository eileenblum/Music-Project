At the next dawn
Search the skies
For the ascent
Of a new morning star

The seventh circle beckons me
As an advertiser they daily weaken me
Comfort in my contempt
Stabbed from within my mind
Simply cannot defend
Disparity and misery

What I do
It is not the good I want to do
It is pure evil
My thought crimes are my mortal sin
Every day
Feed the urge to kill

The second coming is ushered in
By seven thunders who cry aloud
Descend upon the ring of nine
Spirit made flesh
All hail the new prince of this world

You finally gave me reason
Freed me from all my needs
Child of disobedience
Dominate the weak

Beyond good and evil
Catering to all their needs
See them wallowing in their own filth
I am proposing a final solution
There is but one conclusion

You finally gave me reason
Freed me from all my needs
Child of disobedience
Dominate the weak

I must stop the wasting disease
Overflowing narcissism and greed
Bring this world upon its knees

Ãbermensch, Destruction
Theyâre as ape likens man

I must accept that which I am
The opposer at the dusk of man

You finally gave me reason
Freed me from all my needs
Child of disobedience
Dominate the weak
