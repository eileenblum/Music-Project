As one whisky fades into the next
Doubt becomes paranoia and antagonism turns into hate

Look into the mirror
Is this a man before my eyes?
Stare through the dilation
And see black radiates nothing back
I canât stop me from bleeding my life
Grab hold of a sense of myself

Coca eradication is a controversial stratagem
Scream bloody murder of a precious soul
Try to change me
All efforts have failed
A cyclic encounter with the best and the worst
All these years, building tension
Something has to give
A burn is painful
Itâs the greatest pain youâll ever feel
Gasoline ensures a transformation of slow melting
Thatâs most resplendent in vivifying flames

I know it reeks of arrogance
But that does not make it any less true
That I just feel life so much more than you

Bolivian marching powder
Overdose myself on reality
My own white trash hell
Feverish colony where diseased thoughts thrive
I am the enemy
Digging my own grave

Keep burning
The good book says return to ash
Keep burning
Burn this beast of burden down

Congenital failure
From slime weâre all conceived
Honour your parents
Shit in the womb and feel relieved
A hole in the heart
So deep it can never be filled
In nothingness we are as one
