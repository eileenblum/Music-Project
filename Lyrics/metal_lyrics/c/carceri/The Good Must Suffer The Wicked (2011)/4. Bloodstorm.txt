Your life is nothing
You hang on the edge and you cling to existence
Your veins run dry
You must be honest with yourself

The metal connects with pink soft flesh
As you neck snaps Yahweh decides to test you

Suffering starts the questioning of faith
Was it all a waste, precious time now thrown away
Crimson haze, your wifeâs artistic spray
Quite decorative, the slight nuances of brain

A life is nothing
The body is easily broken to pieces
Lord tell me why
No blood no life thatâs certain

All alone in a meditative state
Rising uncertainty, thereâs no answer when you pray
A loving god would disallow this much pain
A prankster god has ways to make it worse
A devotee but your endingâs the same
Donât you know burning ants is just a game?
The quiet, realise
Your child is dead
You wear the grey face of death

As they fight to extend you mortal life
The only life youâll ever have
Bloodstorm
Fade away, leave behind the material plane
From above you look down, see the bloodstains on the ground
No control of your flesh, all fluids want to leave
Vomiting as you grieve

Bloodstorm
Feeding the graves
The end of deception will take you away

Please do drown
You never appreciated your own fragility
No time for regrets
You wear the grey face of death

Slouch in your ooze, honour the dead
In your self-made sordid little
Grief hole of vomit and piss
The afterlife comes down to this

Who would have thought
Youâd weigh your seconds in gold
The gripping cold finally numbs all your pain
No tunnel of light
Turns out we end up the same
Now whoâs insane?
Now whoâs insane?

All alone in a meditative state
Rising uncertainty, thereâs no answer when you pray
A loving god would disallow this much pain
A prankster god has ways to make it worse
A devotee but your endingâs the same
Donât you know burning ants is just a game?
