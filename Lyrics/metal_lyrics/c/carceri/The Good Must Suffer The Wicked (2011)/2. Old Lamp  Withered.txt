He lies in forgetfulness 
The skin old and withered
Recline in uneventfulness
The end is a mockery

Keep reminiscing of chances that passed by
With admirable sternness the body will not die
The allure of heaven was never meant for him
Donât falter, keep your honour
He will never give in

He lies in wickedness
His life ends in torture
Dementia and solitude
Sedate the mind for his own good
Imprisoned in dysfunction
Canât escape the horror
Limping on on borrowed time
Enduring the slow decline

Old hatreds for all these years stay strong
You canât deny the graveâs where you belong
A false internment
The closests have long gone
Die alone
You brought this upon yourself
Yourself

A failed experiment that no one could predict
Failure to procreate is probably for the best

So unsure where we must bury
Weâll see if nature wants him back

The allure of heaven
Was never meant for him
Donât falter keep your honour
He will never give in

He lies in wickedness
His life ends in torture
Dementia and solitude
Sedate the mind for his own good
Imprisoned in dysfunction
Canât escape the horror
Limping on, on borrowed time
Enjoy your slow decline
