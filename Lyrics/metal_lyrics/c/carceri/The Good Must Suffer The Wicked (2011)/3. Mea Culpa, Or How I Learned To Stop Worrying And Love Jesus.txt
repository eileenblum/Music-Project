Transformed into this new persona of elemental energy
In full coronal glory I reawake

They are the antichrist
Their evil proliferates
Hera my plea
Lowering the discourse
Is done with gleeful tenacity
Cultural violence I decree

Of all boons 
To know where you belong is a precious gift
I lay down all independence
Willingfull
Enslavement through ascendance

Exchange my principles
Safety in arrogance
Wrath of the deity
I serve the lord

Look at what you all have become
Shallow versions of what we couldâve been

Solitary defiance
I need a sense of guidance
From the lighted path of normalcy

Forget what we once were
Strong in spirit and mind
Spit on the graves of the elders
Heathen
During the depth of my weakness
I was granted a holy sign
A death to their culture

Kill all the sodomites
And the bloody handed kikes
Burn the muslim for his creed
Punish you for your 
Punish your vagina
Punishing inferiority

For the vanity of an ancient king
Thank me for my deed and forget its manner
During the night I have lain next to him
And tasted of his broken body
I must thank you for your humanity
Even though we both have none
