From the shadows I watch
Like a thief in the night
My prey has just arrived
Followed by his lackeys
Lapdogs each and everyone
Weakness exudes from you
Your bland nonexistence
Lacks any savour

Arrogant egotist, must correct a simple slight
How your genes have survived
To meâs mind numbing
Please continue the motions of
A ritualised posturing
I donât exhibit fear but a burning hunger

Please do believe, we share a common goal
To fulfil our need of senseless suffering
Itâs so disappointing if you now decide
To decline my offer of masticated destruction
Go run and hide

In our erotic embrace
I crave that briny taste
Let me softly lick your face
Can you feel me growing hard against you?
Anticipate your bodyâs subjugation in our meat orgy
Accept your mate

I cannot help these things I do
Theyâre forced upon me everyday
The lamentation of your women
By right of conquest they belong to me

Spreading the word of empty idolatry
A vile act of rape on my person itâs surely
The hunter is hunted, consume the consumer
The meat
I need to eat you

You spread your filth across the earth
You are vermin, not meant to be

Give back to the earth
Begin it anew
Consuming my way through all of creation
Fertilise the soil through swift bowel movement
Spawn new life, become immortal
