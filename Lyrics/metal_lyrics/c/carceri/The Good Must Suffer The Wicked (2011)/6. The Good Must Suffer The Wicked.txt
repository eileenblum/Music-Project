I have chosen the end of this
To finally let go
You conspire against me
The most unlikely enemy

I must leave
Canât go on
This disease must end here

Both despairing in solitude
Till the daylight comes anew
Only I can see there is a
Pretty face under that bruise

Tense a bit when we kiss
Counterfeit apologies

You think that you can fight back
Give me reason

Weâre confined in a life of rejection
Smothering each other with silent rage
Please give me a shot of redemption
It is time to put your dog to sleep

It is hard to accept that
Good things come to an end
Liberate me through sexual release
Not able to conceive
Explain why you would grieve
Ejaculation of the tainted seed

Weâre conjoined in a spiral of loss
Condemned to each other
Condemned to ourselves

How can it be you still believe?
You stand in front of my implosion

Tell me why 
I slowly burn with a hatred for all of your efforts
Pour ethanol on the fire

The more that you try to hold on
The more that I have to break you
Extirpate the cancerous growth
I know it wants to kill you too

Gurgles of a final breath
Colours fade into blue
Your eyes slowly die, die

We did expect a violent ending
It has been said âThe good must suffer the wickedâ
