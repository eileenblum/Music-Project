I am twice your age, but you donât want to see
Height of naivety, as only real young girls can be
Kiss kiss I love you, no I love you more
Begging, pleading me to stop pushing on your gasping throat

A blossoming youthfulness is so arousing to me
Youâre so easy to break
Donât you realize that I wonât stop?
A nose is easy to break

You fulfil my wildest dreams
Now I finally understand the real pride of ownership
I control you from the mouth down

Get on your hands and feet for me
Urinating on the floor and barking like a little dog
I control you from the mouth down

Give me your anus
Feed from my penis

Cute little sobs for help make everything complete
Lesson for today, a lizard has no empathy
Damsel in distress, you certainly fit the part
For you itâs good to know that life sometimes can be,
To cruel, to hard

Pushing though your psyche
Your mother would be so proud
Youâre truly beneath me
Ravaging your psyche
Faecal froth foams from the mouth
I want you to swallow my pee
Cry for me delicately

Looking up inside of me
Mana from my colon
Nauseating romance
Eating chunks from me

Butterfly, youâve become, crawling from your pupa
Not just the girl next door
Now so much more then you were before
A new white human toilet

Come lick my anus
Beg me, Beg me, Beg for me
