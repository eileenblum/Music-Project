Our Bodies Drain And Fortify The Soil Of A Global Concentration Camp
To Escape Is To Live Ostracized
The Breathing Abortion
I Am The Stone
You Are The Stone
The Most Unnatural Self-Erosion
You Will Leave No Imprint Of Life Or Progression
I Will Leave No Imprint Of Life Or Progression
We Are The Barricade
