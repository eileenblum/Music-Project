Evolution Lives Harmonious With Extinction
We Must Die
We Masquerade As Flourishing Flowers But Live As Stagnant Weeds
We Must Die
We Are The Fertilizers Of The Future But We Never Offer Enough For Humanity 
To Ever Take Root
The Soil Is Arid From Ignorance, Injustice, And Contamination
Blue Skies Coil In A Backward Apocalypse
We Must Die
For Life We Must Die
