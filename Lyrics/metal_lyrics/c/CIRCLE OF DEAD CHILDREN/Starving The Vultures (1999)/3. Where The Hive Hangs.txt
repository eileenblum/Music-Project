Engineers Of The Dead
Architects Of Destiny
A Saving Grace, A Gift
Our Lives Are Saved By Incoherence
Tissues Fabricated; Produced By Multimedia
We Have Failed The Test
We Have Failed At Life
The Skin Of The Mother Is Not Your Own
Our Skin Will Become The Ornaments Of Angels
The Curtain Of Humanity Has Been Lowered
The Celebration Is Over
The Queen Bee Is Dead
The Engineer Is The Saving Grace
Fluids Now Run On A Schedule
Precision Is Essential
We Have Failed The Test
We Have Failed At Life
Have Faith Only In Causes And Not In Men
We Will Drink The Hemlock Together
