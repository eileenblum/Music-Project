Who Am I?
Slumber's Spiritual Drifter Wonder Toward The Sewer
My Life; Bounty In The Alley-Cat's Fevered Jaws
Laid My Body On A Hollow Altar
A Spectacle For The Clergy Of The Infected
Wash My Feet {Ablution}
Cleanse My Soul
Complaisant Via Fear
Blessed By The Collar
Held By The Hierology
Led By The Shepherd
Trapped By The Lamb
Murdered By The Father
Absent From Theopathy
Purge My Soul
Pulled The Heart From The Lamb
Fed The Alley-Cat
Drank From The Cloud's Breast And Traced My Shadow In Sunlight
The Figure Of Divinity
Radiant In Simplicity And Traced My Shadow In Sunlight
