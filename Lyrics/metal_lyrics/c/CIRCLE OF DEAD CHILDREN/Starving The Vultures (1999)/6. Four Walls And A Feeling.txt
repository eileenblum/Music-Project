Disfiguring The Memory
So Silent
So Serene
One Eye Shut For The Past
One Eye Opens For Tomorrow's Dream
Mark Her The One
The One Who Will Stand Alone
Pitter-Patter Of Dry-Rotted Love
Plunging, Dropping, Splashing Into Heaven's Eighth Lake
And Casting A Disfigured Reflection Of Life In Its Eight Rings
Dry Flaking Tincture Under One-Inch Fingernails
So Follow Her Home
Follow Her To Reprisal So Sweet
Crying Help To A Barren Room
Barren Walls
Romance In Monotone
She Will Never Miss You
We Will Never Miss You
