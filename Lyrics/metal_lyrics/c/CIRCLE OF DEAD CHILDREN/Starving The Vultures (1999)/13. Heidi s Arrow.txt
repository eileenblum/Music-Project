Why Do Our Children Bleed?
Onto The Floor
Tears And Blood
Onto Their Backs
Riding Punishment
Keeping It Alive
Pierced Down With Heidi's Arrow
Wounds That Imprint The Brain
They'll Bleed Again
They'll Bleed Again
Into The Suckling Mouths Of Another Innocent One I Love
I Throw - Throw The Tears
I Throw - Throw The Blood
Into Your Face
It Breeds A Weapon
A Reoccurrence
So Share The Bruise
Share The Blood
Share Your Hand
Share Your Love That's Within Or They'll Bleed Again
It Breeds A Weapon
A Reoccurrence
So Share The Bruise
Share The Blood
Share Your Hand
Share Your Love That's Within Or They'll Bleed Again
Why Do Our Children Bleed?
Onto The Floor
Tears And Blood
Onto Their Backs
Riding Punishment
Keeping It Alive
Pierced Down With Heidi's Arrow
