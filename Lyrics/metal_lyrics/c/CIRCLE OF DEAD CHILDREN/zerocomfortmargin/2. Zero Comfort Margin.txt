Each slap of the club was life affirming
A dent in my lifetime that made more of an impact
Than anything I could have dealt onto myself
Devils and angels devoured
Guzzled pixie dust insignificance
Confession does not necessitate relief
The guilty are not always forgiven
Witchcraft survived
Slanderous eye of the pig... seared shut in flame
The high pitched squeal settle my heart to ease
Screams won't save but please don't stop now
