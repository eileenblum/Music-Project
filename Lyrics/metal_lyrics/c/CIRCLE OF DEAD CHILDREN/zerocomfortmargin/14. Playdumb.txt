[Hideous Mangleus cover]

Serene, like floating
At the bottom of the sea
So warm, so free
Is this heaven, could it be?

But, for this period of time
I know my peace of mind
Will be coming to an end
When they pull me out again
[Repeat]

Forget your earthly ties
Stay in heaven, no one dies! [x4]

Hanging upside down
Head towards the ground
Naked and cold
Not again will i grow old
[Repeat]

Forget your earthly ties
Stay in heaven, no one dies!!!
