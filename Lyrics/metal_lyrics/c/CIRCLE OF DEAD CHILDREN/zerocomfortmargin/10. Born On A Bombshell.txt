We live in a house of cards where cupidity,
Commodity and conformity are shown to be the ultimate resources
From which to build our life's foundation upon
Wolves gloat from platforms of skull and bone bonded with blood and fraud
All free-will sacrificed for the sake of a suit and tie
Hang yourself in front of the tinted windows of captivity
