Staring toward the mammoth sky
As harpooning light severs through the clouds
To sear my eyes shut from the illustrated world
Beyond sight
A world of leather against rain
Bathed in conflict
Naked in pain
Pressed face against Mother Earth
As her bottomless moans penetrate the soil
To massage my ears deaf from the thunderous world
Beyond sound
A world of velvet and hate
Rinsed in warfare
Denying my fate
