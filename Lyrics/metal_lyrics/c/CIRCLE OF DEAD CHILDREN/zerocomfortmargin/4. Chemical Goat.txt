Somewhere in the sullen caverns of the mind's fluids intercross
Nerves flicker and the most important things in life are lost forever
The caskets are filled with unrecognizable fossils
Just another cerebral collapse in the crowd
An ultra-violent disease
A prostituted cow
Hallowed be their humbled shame
Smooth as silver, the sky bled blue swan tears over and down the valley
Like thighs stretched open, they will wait
