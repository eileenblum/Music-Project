Gape down into these brains as brilliant glistening  mercury
Shoots through each tender twisting channel
May it roll off and sink deep through the soil's pores
To gag every last worm and trigger Mother Earth herself
Into heaving us all out into obliterated space
All cultures truly melted together into one,
And how we should have lived is how we now will die
Squeeze your every muscle and embrace your every bone as the fear of what is to come feeds
With each heartbeat and pumps and pounds
Like hyper-electric nails battered into every last nerve of your body
(You can hold onto your Faith but I'll try to hold back my laughter).
