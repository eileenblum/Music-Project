Like an army of vipers we prepare,
Await and become the obscured hologram of civilian and assassin
This is for black eyes only
This is where poisoning of the roots of machination and deception is all we have left
This is where lions dwell and peace hides its secrets in blackened corners
This is for the kill scene
This is for their heads
