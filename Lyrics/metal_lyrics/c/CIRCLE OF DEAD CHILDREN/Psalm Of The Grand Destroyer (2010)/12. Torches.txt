Torches, go!
Guide the vultures and rats to follow me home.
I found a scrap of you which the pests had left behind.
All for the love of the hammer and the nail.
All for the braids of leather with the skulls of steel.
For the bones that snapped and the blood that spilled.
My hands remain clean.
My guilt forever concealed.
