Burgundy and brown.
Humiliation my sound.
Pompous heart and great anguish squashed between brain and bone.
An inanimate journey through dementia where the ultimate accomplishment is woods earth and lye.
Burgundy and brown.
Hollowness my sound.
Jeopardize the psyche for the taste of eroded embrace as lips moistened with the bile of medicated kiss.
Blue collar.
Red rope.
Succulent and sweet.
Hung me by my switchblade heart.
