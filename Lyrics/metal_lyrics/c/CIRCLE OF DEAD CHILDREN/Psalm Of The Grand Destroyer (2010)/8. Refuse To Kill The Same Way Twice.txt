Green light and skin tight.
Plastic bag hung over your head because it's best to keep the carpet, and walls white.
Kill.
Refuse to kill the same way twice.
If you are going to kill then kill clean and kill often.
Or have we lost the art and right of self-expression?
And if so then I suppose I shall start building my coffin.
