Sky turn to iron and the last words of gravity be inhaled into infinity.
Speak with the energy and spirit of rotting space and abandoned divinity.
Hegelian dialectic.
Thesis and antithesis.
The evolution of mankind reincarnated toward ambivalent hatred.
Intertwined in incestuous embrace with the weaving spiders.
Visceral disgust propels out atmospheric bomb.
Wets the lips of the grand destroyer and prepares his hands for the psalm.
Hatched from the cataclysm egg.
Born into hell.
Days grow ever darker and so we must plug the final holes where light is forced to survive.
So mockingbirds scream into the valley of death.
Deafen all whom can hear and cower from your breath.
