Hammer of propaganda bashed with precision into the eyes of light.
Return me to an era of only pure force and movements.
Vortex of vibrations and purposeful thought.
It has all become just magic now and the authors and guardians of the secrets and solutions have laughed for the final time.
Shown to me as the avatar of innocence but barb-wired with unseen malice and fervor.
Blessed be the powers of disfigurement for they say millions of useless of eaters have become too difficult to handle.
Humanity the legend.
The wails of men from disparate tribes disturb not even a bird in these days.
No white flags to wave.
Survival clock tic harder until the lowest of our bowels struggles with self-defeat.
Roll along, roll along, heads will roll along.
Roll along, roll along, heads will roll along.
Tic harder.
Bowels struggle for self-defeat.
