We who move with the graven worms.
Learning their moves and mimicking their squirms.
Baked dead beneath the sun like psychonauts dreaming of fire.
Below the hunger of the robin and the piercing pains of mans desire.
This is where you will find me during that final glorious days.
Eye to eye with the graven worms within their darkened maze.
This is where you will find me when the planets vanish in space.
Definitions of peace unexplained with the graven worms face to face.
