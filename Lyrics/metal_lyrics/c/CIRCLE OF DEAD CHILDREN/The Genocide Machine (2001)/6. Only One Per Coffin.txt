Fire consume the altar
Gash across the lamb's throat
No one will ever listen
Never again
Your divinity figure with stained red teeth
Aghast with tongue in hand I kneel and vomit at your feet
Gawk at the fallen ascetic
Gawk at the self-deniers
Rise up the choir and sing to me
A forgotten book
A personal scripture
Obstacle diminished
A fresh lamb born
A resurrection
Resurrection of the mind
The mirrored filth
Reflection of the lamb
Blue lips
Crucified
Suicide
