Use my body to spark the fire that will burn all humanity into less than 
black ash
This is the narrator's last wish
Another bleeding poet with shattered fingers and a tendency to go blind upon 
request
The flames stroke the heavens and we see nothing
The flames scald the clouds and we see nothing
The last grain of sand will shatter the hourglass and comfort will only be 
found within our nightmares
The last grain of sand is gripped with shattered fingers
Too blind to see the flames
Too selfish to hold on
