There is a wicked barrier that detaches and discolors our unattainable 
dreams from our inescapable realities
Nothing chafes the ego more than the monstrous realism of eight hours of 
subservience
applied for and anticipated so that the possibility of a less materialistic 
existence could be avoided
Like slowly sucking cold tar through a narrow straw
Vomit upon your dreams
Slowly sucking until you die
