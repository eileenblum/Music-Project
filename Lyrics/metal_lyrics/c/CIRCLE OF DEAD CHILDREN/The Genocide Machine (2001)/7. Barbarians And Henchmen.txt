We idolize and exonerate the statues of barbarians and henchmen
and why and how we must pattern ourselves to be such men
Who is the hero?
Who is the scapegoat?
Hang us high if we dare commit just a fraction of the crimes as our "heroic" 
forefathers have
Two-faced order
Hang us high
With your two-faced order we are ready to die
