I am in the center between sound and body
The middle ground
is where ideas and illusions mingle
and new theories are given birth
Nucleus
Heart
Sterilize both in fire
I am in the center between sound and body
The middle ground
is where humility and embarrassment repel
and old methods are covered with earth
Thalamus
Tachycardia
Suffocate both in fire
