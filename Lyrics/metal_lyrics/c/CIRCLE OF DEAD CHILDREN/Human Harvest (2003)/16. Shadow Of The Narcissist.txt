None of us wish to be our shadow
because we all believe that we are something greater
The figure on the ground
is no less good than what we really are
but more than what we could ever wish to become
Obsessional
Autonomous
Possessive
The abyss of human nature snagged
upon our deficiency upon of self-awareness
Your shadow is selfish and violent
