Bring her a mushroom cloud to garnish the skylines today
Bring her opulent orange and cringing, beautiful white bellows
Give her the gift of eradication, the gift of cleansing
No screams or sounds,
only the resonation of relief colliding with horror
Trepidation blanketed with the reverberation of godlike slaughter
Tumor mankind
Dug from the roots and burned from the marrow outward
Falling forward into complete regeneration
