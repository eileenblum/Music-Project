Let the steel be my Christ Let the blood create the
path Ignored like the dead pigeon gutted by the cat
Impregnated our babies with psychosis and lamb vomit
The clay failed to form the cast All that is left is a
moist clump of animation Pure flat affect and no
chance for grin Retarded by the morning's sunlight and
traded sorrow for silence Sedation in the underlife
Filed in the abyss Sedation in the underlife Through
steel I shall exist The wheelchair pigeon is as clever
as the crow Sedation in the underlife Through steel I
shall exist
