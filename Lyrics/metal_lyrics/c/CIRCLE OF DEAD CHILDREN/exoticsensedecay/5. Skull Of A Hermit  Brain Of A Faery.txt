With one massive breath she was drawn within me
Tunneled through my mouth A soothing delivery to Hell
Dry gasp Impossible to swallow from the head first
Eyes rolled and hands shaped to slaughter Beaten and
erased from the inside out Plague the brain and
disable Plague the blood pump and disable :and then
there was two of her My eyes could only see one shadow
as sunlight dimmed There is an ice pick after the
smile There is an ice pick when I swallow Brain matter
has been frozen The blood pump is an inversion Yet the
body will move on as the heart remains in trance A
skeleton has been frozen There will be no anabiosis I
would rather slit my throat than inhale again
