I am born a highlander,
into battle I ride.
With the sword of my forefathers,
And the clan by my side.

In the glen waits my destiny,
mortal wounds I sustain.
Cold steel inside of me,
but I cannot be slain.

Blessed by immortality,
as time marches on.
Take the head of my enemy,
There can be only one.

The hills have eyes
The hills have eyes
The hills have eyes
The hills have eyes
...Oh Highlander!

Thunder in the mountains,
the final reckoning will come.
At the end of my odyssey,
the prize must be won.

Kraken stands between my quest,
evil old as the sea.
Titans clash in a mighty test,
to taste bloody victory.

Blessed by immortality,
as time marches on.
Take the head of my enemy,
There can be only one.
