Salam o' exalted one,
come share a vision with me.
Back in time,
so it is written,
so it came to pass.
So shall it be

Let the centuries unfold,
like the dance of the seven veils.
Before your very eyes

In a 1001,
1001 night of Arabia
In a 1001,
1001 night of Arabia
A Sultans delight,
gemstones bright
On a flight to Arabia
In a 1001,
1001 night of Arabia

Told by queen Scheherazade,
shackled and sold,
into slavery
To stay alive,
by royal decree
That another day of live,
might go free

Bewitching with tales,
when all else fails,
to curb the wrath of a king
So read on and believe,
who knows what you'll perceive?
What fate Allah may bring

In a 1001,
1001 night of Arabia
In a 1001,
1001 night of Arabia
A Sultans delight,
gemstones bright
On a flight to Arabia
In a 1001,
1001 night of Arabia

In a Persian market place,
slave girls sell their bodies for a price
In the city of sin,
that will pacify,
your every vice

Salam o' exalted one,
Now you've shared a vision with me
Precious sights beyond compare,
magic carpets ride the air
The back of a genie will take you there,
on endless fights
On a 1001 nights of Arabia.
