All alone in you're little room,
Tonight you're not safe in your bed.
You'll find me where the shadows loom
I've a hunger and it must be fed.

Cold blooded mentality,
two-way Gemini.
My dark side gets the better of me,
the evil is rising inside.

Jekyll and Hyde.
Calling Dr Jekyll,
meet Mr Hyde!

Got a split personality
when night begins to fall.
Can't fight this insanity,
the beast within us all.

Transformation changes my face,
visions twist my mind.
They seek a killer,
but in my place,
another stands behind.

Woman child you are the victim,
Of my inner battle for survival.
