Take a trip out of consciousness
across the great divide,
Astral thought projection,
suspended in time.

Flying high through
plasmic oceans,
supernatural skies.
Leave the Earthbound minions,
so very far behind.

As one with the universe,
beyond pleasure and pain.
Die hard retrogression,
being reborn again.

Nightriders on the astral plain
Nightriders on the astral plain
Nightriders on the astral plain
Nightriders on the astral plain

Frontiers of meditation,
the search for inner light.
Take a look through
the minds eye,
on an endless flight.

Between the gates of forever,
void of and hate.
Life and death have no meaning,
in animated state.

A spectrum of fantastic colours,
Incandescent bright.
Vibrating on a timeless wavelength,
a vision of paradise.

We're gonna take you to a place
where the king of terror reigns,
Carnage and mutilation
degredates your burning remains.
