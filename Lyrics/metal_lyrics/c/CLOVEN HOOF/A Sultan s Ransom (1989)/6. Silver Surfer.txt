I blaze across the heavens,
Into the great unknown.
Riding the comets tail
with ease I soar.
I've seen the super nova,
star fields to roam.
Here where the winds of Saturn roar.

Born to roam the starways,
glide on solar winds.
To the point where time ends,
and the void begins.

I am the Silver surfer,
Meteors fly.
I am the silver surfer,
Into the eye of the sky.

I wield the cosmic power,
mine to command.
mysteries of the universe unfold.

But still my heart grows colder
away from my homeland,
light years alone no one to hold.
