I'm a soldier
born and raised to kill,
Nerves of steel
forged by an iron will.
No heart to run away.

Here where the bullets fly,
There's no one left
to hear my battle cry.
Mine is not to reason why?

Forgotten heroes,
the battle has been won.
No more heroes,
but their memory lingers on.
Forgotten heroes,
too late to count the cost,
No more heroes,
the languid and the lost.

Cheating death so many times,
haunted spirits of the front line.
They seem to have died in vain.

Trenches deep in blood,
The stench of corpses
sinking into mud.
Did the sacrifice do any good?

Help me sweet Jesus,
I feel I can't go on.
Our ranks are falling,
reinforcements are gone.

Mortars are pounding,
it seems this is the end.
A case of death or glory,
What honour to defend?

Oh Forgotten Heroes,
Oh Forgotten Heroes,
Oh Forgotten Heroes,
Oh Forgotten Heroes.
