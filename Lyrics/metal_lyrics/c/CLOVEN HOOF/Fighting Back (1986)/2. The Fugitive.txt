The dream of escape made reality,
Renegades fled to the awaiting underground network, perused by tracers.
The imperial guards killer elite, cyborg man hunters scanning the ends of the Earth for the fugitive.

Wild on the run,
wild on the run.
I'm after you.
No walls can hold me,
no bars,
cause I'll slip through.

Convicted of murder,
a case of 1st degree.
They found me guilty,
but I'm innocent,
and now I'm free to...

Go to ground,
hide and seek.
Gonna track you down,
revenge is sweet. Yeah!

[Chorus:]
I'm a fugitive,
running from the law.
Framed,
this was not my own crime.
No penitentiary,
is gonna cage me.
Till vengeance,
and freedom is mine again.

Dragnet is on,
dragnet is on,
droids at my back.
Hunter becomes the hunted,
one step ahead of the pack.

So sleep with one eye open,
I'm never far away.
Keep a' looking,
over your shoulder,
you won't live another day.

Eye for an eye,
tooth for a tooth.
Make ya testify,
before ya die,
you'll tell the truth. Yeah!

[Chorus]
