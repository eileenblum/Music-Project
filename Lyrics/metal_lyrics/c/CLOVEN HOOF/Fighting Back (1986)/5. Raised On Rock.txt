Tune in to the music,
wreck the radio.
I'm all ready to go see a rock n' roll show.

I like it hot n' heavy,
I like it way up high.
The marshalls stacked like towers,
in a neon sky.

Hear the band play loud!
Feel the roar of the crowd!

We are raised on rock,
we were born to rock.
Come on make the mayhem fly.
We are raised on rock,
we were born to rock.
Let the whole world hear our cry!
Eyo-eyo gonna play it till I die,
Eyo-eyo we love it that is why...
We rock!

Hold tight now we're moving,
turning on the heat.
Blazing guitars,
headbanging beat.

This feeling lasts forever,
not just a passing phase.
Reeling through the night,
in a metal daze.

Do ya dance on fire?
Does it take you higher?
