I want you to infect your mind,
neural assimilation.
Gaze into my electric eye,
retinal digitisation complete.

Transmit your data
trapped in the heart
of my mainframe,
drawn into a vast computer game.

Surrender flesh
and let it slip away,
only the strong
shall win on this day.

Your memories now
I shall steal,
Ill drain you till you are unreal,
and when I'm done
all hope is gone.

[Chorus:]
In Cyber world,
In Cyber world,
In Cyber world.

Impulse waves
connect our thoughts,
challenge on man
and machine.

A mighty test
no quarter sought,
pixels fly
inside silicon dream.

implanted wires
hook into your brain,
your life won't ever
be the same.

Heroes quest
of dragons and kings,
an endless flight
on virtual wings.

There's no time
to think it over,
titans clash in a supernova.
raging on
till battles won.

[Chorus]

Surrender flesh
and let it slip away,
only the strong
shall win on this day.

Your memories now
I shall steal,
Ill drain you till you are unreal,
and when I'm done
all hope is gone.

[Chorus]
