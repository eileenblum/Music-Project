My God
why hast thou forsaken me?
Done all that's asked in your name.
Why must my path lead on to Calvary?
How could my death be in vain?

I preached the gospel,
from the highest mountain.
I reached the mighty,
beast of the field.
Who raised the dead?
Walked on water?
Tempted by Satan,
but I would not yield.

[Chorus:]
Golgotha!
Golgotha!
Golgotha, oh!

Golgotha!
Golgotha!
Golgotha, oh!

I healed the leaper,
and freed the harlot.
The lame could walk,
my hands can heal.
I fed the hungry,
banished demons.
The blind see
through me,
but my fate is sealed.

[Chorus]

See how I bleed?
How can it come to this?
Broken betrayed
by a Judas kiss.

Thorns crown my head,
Messiah they call me.
Soon I will be dead,
mortal man from Galilee.

Holy father,
my time has come.
holy ghost,
now receive your son.

[Chorus]
