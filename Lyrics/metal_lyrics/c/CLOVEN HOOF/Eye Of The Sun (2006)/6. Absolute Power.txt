You tell me that we live in democracy?
You tell me that our children are free?

I'm telling you
were getting screwed
every way but loose,
cant you see
we live in heir achy?

Rich man lives his wildest dreams,
fat act licking off the cream.

You gotta fight for the right to live!

[Chorus:]
Slaves and masters
lust for gold,
megalomania
takes control.
How much to sell
your soul?

Absolute Power!
Absolute Power!
Absolute Power!
Corrupts yeah!

Diamond Jim's
living in the lap
of luxury,
Ivory towers
at the top of the tree.

Homeless starve
on the streets,
abandoned refugees
down and out
in cardboard city.

Poor man has to soldier on,
vermin to be spat upon.

Skid row ain't no place to go!

[Chorus]

Nation, of limitation.
Know your station,
sell your mother for a price.

Nation, of limitation.
Know your station,
sell your mother for a price.

[Chorus]

Absolute power
...Corrupts absolutely!
