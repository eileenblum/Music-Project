Don't go messing around
down there,
at devils bayou,
In the midnight hour
ain't no place to be.

Strange things are known
blacker than
swampy water,
Dead men talk
and are walking free.

There's an evil woman
who dwells in sleepy hollow,
Once she gets her hooks onto you
you'll never be free.

Chorus
Eye of the zombie!
Eye of the zombie!
Eye of the zombie,
on me!

Eye of the zombie!
Eye of the zombie!
Eye of the zombie,
on me!

People round these parts
won't never talk to strangers,
Keep the shutters closed
from dusk till dawn.

Be on your guard
the night has
hidden dangers,
or you won't even
live to see another morn.

She's a black magic woman
Baron Sameads daughter,
dance into the fire
and she'll
make you scream.

[Chorus]

Slave until the end of time
She's s the devils daughter,
the living dead cry out
into an endless dream.

[Chorus]
