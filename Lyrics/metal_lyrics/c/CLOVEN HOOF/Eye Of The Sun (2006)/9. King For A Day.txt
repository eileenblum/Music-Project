I roam the plains
got no name,
don't need anybody.
You are in chains
society reigns,
holding everyone.

People say they
cant understand me?
don't you even start to try.
Barren skies in my eyes
gotta be free,
vagabond till I die.

Chorus
Do as I do,
do what I say.
You make the rules
but I don't wanna play.
Know my own mind
go my own way,
doomed to follow,
who made you king for a day?

Who made you?
Who made you?
Who made you?
Who made you?

Who made you king
for a day?
Who made you king
king for a day?

Who made you king
for a day?
Who made you king
king for a day?

They pay for dirt
beneath their feet,
I stray where I want to.
Stay in one place
they spit in your face,
wanderlust grabs you.

People say they
cannot understand me,
don't you even start to try.
Barren skies in my eyes
gotta be free,
vagabond till I die.

[Chorus]
