The stars are our home
Roaming the galaxy
We're free
Raiders from space
Star fighter zeros.

Out of the sun
Engage the enemy
We see
Planets in chains
Hell is for heroes.

We glide in our silver birds
Got to do or die

Soar on solar winds
Rage on high
As fire on silent metal wings
Out where the meteors fly
You and I.

Chorus
Reach for the sky
Reach for the sky
Reach for the sky
Reach for the sky

Trail to blaze
Glory and victory will be
In for the kill
Or wiped out forever.

Life is a dream
And death a reality for me
Star fleet in flames
But never surrender.

Dog fight till the end
Dive for the last time

Soar on solar winds
Rage on high
As fire on silent metal wings
Out where the meteors fly
You and I.

[Chorus]
