Courage in adversity abandoned in the sanctuary of
desolation, forces of liberty re-assembled tattered
armies. Bloodied, bowed but undefeated. Here hung
the last hope of the few... Warriors of the wasteland!

A thousand years the war raged on,
a world in tears the sun has gone.
So cold and lonely in this desert land,
A warrior waits for the last command.
The last command,
the last command... Oh yeah!

Warrior of the wasteland,
tomorrow belongs to me.
Abandoned soldier of fortune,
mutant eyed mercenary.

[Chorus:]
Take no prisoners,
guardian of the plain.
Sole survivor,
till the orders remain.
Warrior of the wasteland!

Outpost scavenger city,
home to rats and debris.
I bring law to the dessert,
I keep the frontier free.

[Chorus]

The war raged on,
the sun has gone.
I'll take your life,
you'll never survive in the Wasteland.
In the Wasteland!
