Against insurmountable odds the Andromedian front line defences crumbled.
Unto Earth came space Invaders!

They came out of the twilight,
pulsating as they go.
Descending across the horizon,
to the enemy below.

Flying in formation,
like some sci-fi dream,
Planetary adversary,
my eyes have seen.

[Chorus:]
The Invaders,
reigning terror,
down from the sky.
Solar raiders,
they live that
worlds may die.

I turned and ran in fear,
screaming into the night.
A claw of steel fell about me,
in solid beams of light.

When the ordeal was over,
my close encounter there.
Helpless bound and tortured,
captive in the lair.

[Chorus]

Creatures of Earth!
you are under martial law,
of the Draconian federation.
All who resist will be...
Exterminated!

Peoples of the universe,
We must now unite.
Make a stand to the last,
fight for what is right.

Mobilise all our forces,
retaliate to win.
Liberate or seal your fate,
never to give in.

Defy the Invaders,
from far away!
Far away!
Far away!
From far away!
