Up on the hill,
looking down at me.
The hoards are waiting,
for the guilty to be.
Sentenced to death.

Blood sport,
feel the thrill of the chaise.
Heart is fit to bursting,
at the deadly pace.
Hard to draw breath.

I am the prey,
it's jungle law.
Fight to survive,
tooth fang and claw.
Wild dogs behind,
see snarling jaws.

Running man,
breaking free.
The hounds of hell,
are after me.
The gibbet waits,
or to take my head.
Will I make it?
Or will I be dead?

I'm the running man,
I'm the running man.
I am yeah.
Running man,
I'm the running man
...Understand?

In for the kill,
sprint for the line.
Can't break my will,
race against time.
Life flashing by.

Hunted the pack
are closing in,
I hear them howling.
Maybe I can't win,
but I've gotta try.

I swore an oath,
dragged to the floor.
My ghost will haunt
this windy moor.
Forever free,
through blood and gore.

Running man,
breaking free.
The hounds of hell,
are after me.
The gibbet waits,
or to take my head.
Will I make it?
Or will I be dead?

Nobody helped me,
nobody even knows my name.
Fighting bravely,
even though I died in vain.
Whoa!

Running man,
breaking free.
The hounds of hell,
are after me.
The gibbet waits,
or to take my head.
Will I make it?
Or will I be dead?

I'm running still.
On this cold and lonely,
wiley windy hill!
