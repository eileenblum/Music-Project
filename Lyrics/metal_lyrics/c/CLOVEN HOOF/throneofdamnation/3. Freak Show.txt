Roll on up take a look at me,
just a side-act novelty.
Circus clown in the public gaze,
nameless horror to be
feared and caged.

Behind this mask of deformity,
there's a son of humanity.
Formed by natures twisted hand,
they call me monster.
But I'm a man!

Everything I touch,
everything I see.
Everything I feel,
crumbles before me.
I am not a dog,
I do all I can.
Can't you understand?
Wanna fit in with the likes of you.

Set me free,
let me go.
Want to belong,
I need to grow.
But you treat me like a
freak show!

Freak show!
I'm nothing but a Freak show.
Freak show!

Mirror your insecurity,
imperfect, scarred,
just leave me be.
Need a place where I can hide,
no one sees the wretch inside.

Stripped of pride and dignity,
mocked by cruel society.
Thought you were my only friend,
now I can see you just pretend.

Everything I knew,
everything I crave.
Everything I do,
brings me closer to my grave.

Too grotesque to live,
but too young to die.
Madness, cruelty reigns,
torment clouds my brain.

Hatred,why is it so?
Need to belong,
someone you should know.
But you treat me like a freak show!

Freak show!
I'm nothing but a Freak show.
Freak show!

What do you want from me?
Cut me do I not bleed?
I'm every bit as good as you.
Out cast,beat down betrayed.
Lost in a world I never made,
I'm insane after all they put me through.

Set me free,
Let me go.
Want to belong,
I need to grow.
Oh they can't even look me,
Right in the face!
...Subhuman!

Let me show you,
the creature I've become.
The evil that torments the soul,
when prejudice is done.

Freak show!
I'm nothing but a Freak show.
Freak show!

Freak!
freak!
freak!
freak!

You treat me like a freak show,
freak show!
I'm nothing but a Freak show,
freak show!

(Voice over)
Roll up roll up,
See the inhuman monstrosities.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you ...FREAKS!
