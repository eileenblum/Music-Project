The seer has a message,
it spells out a warning.
Foretold of evil,
from times early dawning.

Lilith is her name,
she'll drive you insane.
From hell spawn she came,
to find you.

She tells you damnation,
is nothing to fear.
Proclaims revelations,
is already here.

Black are her eyes,
beguiling with lies.
With blood lust she cries,
let the night games begin!

Whore of Babylon!
Whore of Babylon!
Whore of Babylon!
Whore of Babylon!

Daughter of darkness,
banished from Eden.
She is the succubus,
lays down with demons.

Lucifer's child,
restless and wild.
A harlot defiled,
blind fool!

Queen of seduction,
bewitching the priests.
Lust and corruption,
the mark of the beast.

Haunting your dreams,
insidious schemes.
She laughs at your screams,
the nightmare won't end.

Whore of Babylon!
Whore of Babylon!
Whore of Babylon!
Whore of Babylon!

She'll take you to the alter,
like a human sacrifice.
Easy virtue incarnate,
she's a mistress of the night.
Priestess of seduction,
she's all your body needs.
Eat you alive,
fuck you till you bleed!

Whore of Babylon!
Whore of Babylon!
Whore of Babylon!
Whore of Babylon!
