Too bad the boy can't sing,
but kids today'll buy anything.
Sweet meat,
supplying trash on demand,
for a few dollars more.
In the back of a hand.

You'll go far It's true,
every two bit actors
a rock n' roll star.
In the charts on the news,
with millions screaming
all over you.

It's Prime Time!
Media saturation,
corporation war
talent ain't worth a dime.
Doing prime time!
Slave to convention,
overnight sensation
sign the dotted line.
You'll find,
were all doing prime time!

Red hot the kid can play,
but where's the pay off
at the end of the day?
Looses heart,
playing one night stands.
Never got a deal,
soon quit the band.

He was good,
goes to show.
It ain't what you do,
it's who you know.
That's the catch 22,
when the doors are closed,
you'll never break through.

It's Prime Time!
Media saturation,
corporation war
talent ain't worth a dime.
Doing prime time!
Slave to convention,
overnight sensation
sign the dotted line.
You'll find,
were all doing prime time!

It's a fashion reaction,
Pigeon hole philosophy.
The people only get,
what we want them to see.
Gonna sell 'em the illusion,
till it hurts and they'll pay.
A little bit of hype goes a long,
long way.

Foundations of rock,
Have feet of clay,
Gone tomorrow,
but here today.

It's Prime Time!
Media saturation,
corporation war
talent ain't worth a dime.
Doing prime time!
Slave to convention,
overnight sensation
sign the dotted line.
You'll find,
were all doing prime time!

Were all doing Prime time!
Prime time!
Prime time!
Prime time honey.
