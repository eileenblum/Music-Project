We rise as the sun has fallen,
the midnight world I roam.
Life and death has no dominion,
but the grave shall be our home.

Naked alone you are defenceless,
like a body in a tomb.
Haunted in your silent slumber,
as I creep into your room.

You will hear me.
You will heed me.
You will fear me.
You will need me!

[Chorus:]
Children of the darkness feed,
bring the kiss of evil.
Legions of the lost night breed,
taste the kiss of evil.

Love bites,
flying in the night.
We are flying in,
flying in the night.

The darkness of the night!

I am met without resistance,
my gift is bitter sweet.
Senses sharpened Nosferatu,
mortal prey are easy meat.

Joined immortal yet un-living,
once you taste my first attack.
fate is sealed in realms of shadow,
there can be no turning back.

You will hear me.
You will heed me.
You will fear me.
You will need me.

[Chorus]

I want it,
you got it.
I feel hot blood,
in the still of the night.
There ain't no doubt
about it,
you heat me up
till I loose my mind.

Running wild,
in the city.
Your face so god damn pretty.
Your neck,
my eyes of fire.
Food for the love vampire!

[Chorus]
