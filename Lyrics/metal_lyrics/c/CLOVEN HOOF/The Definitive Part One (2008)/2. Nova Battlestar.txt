Star war rage in the heavens
At the heart of Andromeda
Flagship to the armada
The Nova Battlestar

Interstellar commander
Enforcer of empire might
Death star renegade
Travelling at the speed of light

Colonating ... obliterating
Destruction all across the void
Exterminating ... guns blazing
Till the federation are destroyed

Chorus
Nova Battlestar!
Nova Battlestar!

War machines under fire
Retaliation has begun
The vanguard is defeated
Victory is won

Legions yield to conquest
Challengers swept aside
Draconian domination, when rival worlds collide

Colonating ... obliterating
Destruction all across the void
Exterminating ... guns blazing
Till the federation are destroyed

[Chorus]

Invasion will come in a later time
They will raise the mountains
And drain the sea,
Baron skies the bitter prize
Lay waste to the cosmos
For its energy,
Centurions of darkness
Coming today,
Beach head earth
Is already under way.
