Your all gonna Die!

Razor backed,
bringer of pain.
Laser bolts
lance your brain.
Piling on the agony,
mechanoid brutality.

Tearing limbs
and gouging eyes,
sadistic butcher
cleaves and scythes.
Liquidate humanity,
crime is life
let none go free.

Hell is now here
all will fall,
God will not intervene at all.

Searching,
seeking,
destroying.
Mutilator!

Burning,
breaking,
killing.
Mutilator!

Waging pure
and bloody war,
Dreadnaught
settles old scores.
Slaying his
creator screams,
slaughtered as
the blood redeems.

Doomsday monarch
reigns in death,
separate you
from your breath.
Genocide across
the land,
mass extinction
close at hand.

He will spare no one,
steel wheels run.
The body count
goes on and on.

The Earth is cleansed now,
he stands alone.
Cathedral built of cartilage,
shattered skull and bone.

Corpses piled high
to the sky.
New worlds to ravage
and brutalize.

Hell is now here
all will fall,
God will not intervene at all.
