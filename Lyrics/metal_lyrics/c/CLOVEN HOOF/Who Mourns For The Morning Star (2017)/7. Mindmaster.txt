Propaganda blurring all the facts
Lurking in shadows waiting for a contact
Subliminal message invading all your screens
Indoctrinating, I can hear your inner screams

There gonna get to you
Just like they got to me
And when they're through with you
You don't know what to believe?

You'll never learn, you're gonna burn!
You're so blind
Master mind!
Pulling the strings, waiting in wings!
Now you're mine
Master mind!

Mind master... Web of lies!

Subterfuge, slaughter of the innocent
Everyone's guilty, cover up the government
Open your eyes, the writing's on the wall
New order will rise, kingdoms must fall

Watching your every move
They practice to deceive
Facts you'll never prove
Don't know what to believe

You'll never learn, you're gonna burn!
You're so blind
Master mind!
Pulling the strings, waiting in wings!
Now you're mine
Master mind!

Can't you heed the warning?
Can't you see it coming?

Watch the film, your eyes are getting sleepy
You will obey, every word I say

Publicly dissecting you
Steal your name and face
Nothing here is sacred
There gonna put you in your place
Master mind!
They know your thoughts
Master mind!
Inside your head
Master mind!
When you are sought...
Master mind!
...you're gonna wake up ...dead!
