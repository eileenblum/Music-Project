I wasn't there today
But I'll be there tomorrow
Things we didn't say
Don't leave me to my sorrow

You want it all
I'll walk through fire for you
And when you call
I'll run like you want me to

Straight into the jaws of hell
I would risk it all for you
Straight into the jaws of hell
Bring you back the devil his due

The veil took away
The only thing I treasure
I've got to find some way
You must be mine forever

I'll take the fall
You mean just everything
I'd face the wall
Of death and chance anything

Straight into the jaws of hell
Reached the point of no return
Straight into the jaws of hell
Play with fire and then you'll burn

Life's so worth fighting for
Who knows what's in store?

Straight into the jaws of hell
I would risk it all for you
Straight into the jaws of hell
Bring you back the devil his due

Straight into the jaws of hell
Reached the point of no return
Straight into the jaws of hell
Play with fire and then you'll burn

Make a deal with the devil!
Make a deal with the devil!
Make a deal with the devil!
Make a deal with the devil!
