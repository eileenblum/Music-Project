Lazarus! Rise up from your tomb, I compel you!
Or prepare to meet thy doom
Surrender! Corpse come unto me, do my bidding!
And I'll set your spirit free

There are things beyond the skies
Entities that hate and despise
Leave your sleep, accursed arise
Moulder in your graves no more!

I talk to the dead
I can hear them screaming
Words they dread
And they're coming to life

I can hear
Whispering in your graves
Know you fear
Resurrection's near

There's dark magic old as time
Souls at once possessed
Desecrate unholy crime
Disturb them from their rest

I talk to the dead
I can hear them screaming
Words they dread
And they're coming to life

We are from the realm of shadows
And we mourn the chance to return to life!

Necromancy!
Life wasted on the living
Necromancy!
Death is unforgiving

Necromancy!
Ask what comes tomorrow
Necromancy!
The dead know to their sorrow

I hold the power of re-animation
You will all obey my call
No one will weep for your passing
Your only worm food after all

We are the dead!
You will obey!
We are the dead!
You will obey!
We are the dead!
You will obey!
We are the dead!
You will obey!
