One more for the highway!

Dark before the light
I'm a victim of circumstances

Nothing seems quite right
But things can change
I'll take my chances

Back on the road again
True my life ain't got no reason
The pain won't end
Until I find my way to freedom

Gotta aim, I'm gonna make it
Stake a claim ,ain't gonna fake it
Made a vow, see you in hell
Breaking away, like a neon angel

Don't wanna fight
Life's too short and it won't solve nothing
I've got you in my sights
But I've gotta go, 'cause I know something

Way on around the bend
Straight into a new horizon
My soul ascends
The futures bright to feast your eyes on

Gotta aim, I'm gonna make it
Stake a claim, ain't gonna fake it
Made a vow, see you in hell
Breaking away, like a neon angel

I drove a thousand miles for you
But things don't work out like I want 'em to

Neon angels!
Neon angels on the run
Neon angels!
Neon angels got no one
Neon angels!
Neon angels born to lose
Neon angels!
Neon angels 'cause we choose to ride

Ride to live, and live to ride!
Ride to live, and live to ride!

Neon angels!
Neon angels!
