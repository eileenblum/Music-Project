A call to arms, the battle roar
Thunder in the sky
Marching feet through howling winds
Many doomed to die

Warriors with shields and swords
Lion in their heart
Spartans on the road to hell
Conflict about to start

Standard raised proudly the quarry and the kill
A test to find who the gods would slay
Fortune watch over us, Ares not abandon us
The ferryman awaits on this day

Better to die on your feet than to live on your knees
Better to die, than to live on your knees
Better to die on your feet than to live on your knees
Better to die, than to live on your knees

In the fields, the armies stand
Fear hangs in the air
War drums beat, the brave hold true
They go where none may dare

Courage in adversity
Challenger s await
Rally to charge the blood oath sworn
Knives in eyes of hate

I have the malice and I have the might
My will is strong
Hail death or glory, valour be our story
Songs of our deeds will live on

Better to die on your feet than to live on your knees
Better to die, than to live on your knees
Better to die on your feet than to live on your knees
Better to die, than to live on your knees

Our armies mass
At the pass of Thermopylae
We must kill or be killed
Blood spilled, no mercy

Go tell the passer by
That here to their laws we lie
Though arrows darken the skies
Be not afraid... We can fight in the shade!
Ohh!

Standard raised proudly the quarry and the kill
A test to find who the gods would slay
Fortune watch over us, Ares not abandon us
The ferryman awaits on this day

Better to die on your feet than to live on your knees
Better to die, than to live on your knees
Better to die on your feet than to live on your knees
Better to die, than to live on your knees
