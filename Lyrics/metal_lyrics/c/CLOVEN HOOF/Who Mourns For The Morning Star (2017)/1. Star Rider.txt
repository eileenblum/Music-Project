Ever since the dawn of man, he gazed towards the night
Watched and wondered what he saw, strange and eerie sights
Have streaked across the firmament, on the edge of space
Are they gods in chariots, or some alien race?

Reports of some abduction, happen every day
There's got to be some truth in it, no matter what they say

Star rider!
At the speed of light
Star rider!
Take me on a flight
Star rider!
Can't you understand?
Star rider!
Don't wanna see the fall of man

My fate is in your hands, when are you gonna land?

What is there purpose here? And where are they from?
E.T. cloaked in secrecy, the search for them goes on
Why do they experiment, prey on human kind?
Terraforming deities, or made up in the mind?

The truth is out there somewhere, masked to be revealed
Are they cosmic saviours? Or fate forever sealed

Star rider!
At the speed of light
Star rider!
Take me on a flight
Star rider!
Can't you understand?
Star rider!
Don't wanna see the fall of man

My fate is in your hands, what are your secret plans?

Take see to the sky, I wanna join them
Make me fly so high, take me home

Come on star rider, solar glider
Take me home!

Star rider!
At the speed of light
Star rider!
Take me on a flight
Star rider!
Can't you understand?
Star rider!
Don't wanna see the fall of man
