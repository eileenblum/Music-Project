Faster than light burns the fury
The hammer of god pounds this day
Death knell sounds for creation
The angel of death will hold sway

He without sin is not safe from the harvest
Slaughtered like beast of the field
The reaper is grinding his scythe for the carnage
The plague will all force you to yield

On your knees!
The scales of injustice...
On your knees!
...are tipped now in shame
On your knees!
Fate hangs in the balance
On your knees!
...we're found wanting again

Time to burn!
Time to burn!

Falling from grace like in Eden
Temptation corrupts in the play
Oceans they rage like a tempest
Kills everyone in the way

Nothing is sacred the lamb is devoured
The great and the good are all slain
All that is evil the sacrament broken
The covenant smashed and blood stained

On your knees!
With him is the power!
On your knees!
Repent now and pray
On your knees!
Late is the hour!
On your knees!
Too late judgement day

Time to burn!
Time to burn!

Holy retribution
See the monkeys run
There ain't no solution
Every mothers son
Raining blood from heaven
Misery goes on
Horsemen ride
The seven signs
And wonders then they're gone

Babylon, thy kingdom come
Rome has gone, thy will be done
Time to burn!
On your knees!
The scales of injustice...
On your knees!
...are tipped now in shame
On your knees!
Fate hangs in the balance
On your knees!
Were found wanting again
