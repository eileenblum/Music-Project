I am the morning star, the one who fell from grace
No matter who you are, you've heard of me in this accursed place
The angels wept, when they beheld my face

Paradise is lost, no heaven waits for me
In darkness here I dwell, humbled throughout eternity
What will be, forevermore shall be

He'll never know what he has done to me
My crime was vanity, I rule alone
Cruel destiny, my pride has banished me
Stripped of divinity, never atone

Did you say that god is good?
Did you say that god is good?

Did you say that god is good?
Do you think he would condone rough justice?
He without true sin, let him cast the very first stone
Why must I endure?
Evermore the prince of darkness, too long now have I paid
Rule in hell, still enthroned

Everybody needs second chances
Why not me with a soul to sell?
I'm a victim of circumstances
Playing a game that I know so well

Father of light, in dark we prey
Give me some hope, to end this day
To end this day...

I need forgiveness! (whoa!)
I need forgiveness! (whoa!)

Is it really oh so bad?
Wanting just to feel exalted
Host thought me mad
Believing I was the one
Lucifer - I'm the light
Once I was a holy angel
Languishing in my plight
Like Eden freedom is gone

Everybody needs second chances, why not me with a soul to sell?
I'm a victim of circumstances, playing a game that I know so well

How can you say I'm not repentant enough?
I've spent ten thousand years after the fall
Surly that's harsh enough?
Well if I'm damned, god damn you all!

Who will mourn for the morning star?
Who will mourn for the morning star?
Who will mourn for the morning star?
Who will mourn for the morning star?
