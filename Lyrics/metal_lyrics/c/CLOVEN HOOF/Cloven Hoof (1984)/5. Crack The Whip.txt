Gonna ride you hard, hold on fast.
We can last the whole night through.
Take the strain, feel the pleasure and pain, shooting up inside of you.

Give it all you got, make it hot.
Ya really do it to me so right.
Touch it taste it feel it now,
ya know how it fit's so tight.

[Chorus:]
Crack the whip!
You keep me coming, on stronger than ever before.
Light my fire, feed your desire, till it leaves ya burning for more.

Hairs all wet, starting to sweat.
Give ya every inch of my love.
Probing, moving in on your knees, to me standing above.

Penetrating, my bodies breaking.
Heart beating to the rhythm as one.
Take it to the limit now, keep me up till the loving is done.

[Chorus]

Give it all you got, make it hot.
Ya really do it to me so right.
Touch it taste it feel it now,
ya know how it fit's so tight.

[Chorus]

Crack the Whip!
Keep me coming
You know, how to get me high.
Sure know something!
When my finger runs along your thigh.

Give ya every inch of my love.
Crack the whip!
