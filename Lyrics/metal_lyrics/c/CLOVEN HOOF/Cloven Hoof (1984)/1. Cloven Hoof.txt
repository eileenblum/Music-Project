The House of God has been, violated.
Blasphemy here this night.
Cross upturned alter desecrated,
disciples of darkness in unholy light.

In reverence to the dreaded master,
Spill lifeblood unto goat headed shrine.
Praise be the fallen lord of Chaos, disaster.
Cloven Hoof his sacrilegious sign.

Witches Rune

Darksome night and shining moon,
East, then south, then west, then north.
Hearken to the Witches Rune,
here I come to call thee forth.
Earth and Water,
Air and Fire,
by all the power of land and sea.
Work ye unto my desire,
as I do will so mote it be.

Queen of heaven,
Queen of Hell.
Horned hunter of the night,
Lend your power unto my spell
and work your will be magic rite.

EKO EKO ZAMILAK

The rites complete, the room grows cold.
Black candle flames flicker then die.
Summoned a new, terrors centuries old.
The hour of the one is nigh.

Witches Rune

By powers of the Witches blade,
Come ye as the charm is made.
Harken ye unto my word, as it is said, let it be heard.

Chords and cencer sourge and knife,
Waken ye unto life.

I feel the all consuming power unfold,
amongst the chosen relenting to its hold.
Smothering all in heritic rite, taken in sin
To dwell in Hells eternal night!.. Oh no!
