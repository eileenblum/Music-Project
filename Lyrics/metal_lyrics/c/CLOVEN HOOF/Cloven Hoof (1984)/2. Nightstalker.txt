Never pay no heed to those who oppose my lifestyle
Feel no remorse for the wrong that I've done
I constantly abuse all who try to use me
Like a fallen angel banished from the sun

[Chorus:]
Cause I'm the Night Stalker, feel the cold caress of knife
Stealthily advancing to cut out your life
Yeah the Night Stalker, assassin at your back
Skulking in the shadows poised for attack

Prowling these streets at night,
I fight a deadly game of survival
Stealing through the concrete jungle with bloodlust in my brain
All here fear me I'm ruthless as I'm godless
A preditor of the side walk in his alley-way domain

[Chorus]

Society brands me a homicidal madman,
but they cannot cage what they cannot see
When I'm coming you as good as a dead man
Ain't no one alive that can elude me

[Chorus]
