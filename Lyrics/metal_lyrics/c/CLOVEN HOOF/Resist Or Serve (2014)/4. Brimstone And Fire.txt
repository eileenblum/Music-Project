Assassin in a splinter cell,
mind is warped by hate.
Sleeping vipers, at your heart.
You can't negotiate.

Kamikaze waging wars,
attrition from within.
Spreading fear,
divide and conquer.
You will never win.

Want to die a hero?
What god will save you,
with those blood stains
on your hands?

Holy martyr bluff and then strike,
gun now for hire Brimstone and fire!
Twisted killer waits spider like,
fanatic and wired.
Brimstone and fire!

Infiltrate and segregate,
hide and terrorize.
Traitors sneer and burn our flag,
aim destabilize.

Women, children innocents,
in cowardly attack.
Are massacred their easy targets,
unable to fight back.

Have no conscience or honour,
Oh you don't care
who your sending to the grave.

Demon preacher servant of hell,
prophet and liar.
Brimstone and fire!

Ruthless teacher,
In madness you dwell 
delude and conspire. 
Brimstone and fire.
...Brimstone and fire yeah! 

Holy martyr bluff and then strike,
gun now for hire Brimstone and fire!
Twisted killer waits spider like,
fanatic and wired.
Brimstone and fire!

Demon preacher servant of hell,
prophet and liar.
Brimstone and fire!

Brimstone and fire,
your gonna burn.
And you'll learn...not fun.
Your gonna burn,
and you'll learn.
Gone out your mind.
Oh your gonna burn...ooh.
Hey! You wanna die a hero?
You got blood on your hands
â¦ oh!

Brimstone and fire!
