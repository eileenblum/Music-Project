Viking raiders,
scourge of the seven seas.
Men of iron with blade of steel.
Rape and plunder,
marauding Norse men deal.
Death unto he who does not yield.

Fierce fighting rages,
villages set ablaze,
in a baptism of fire.
honour the dead,
in old accustomed ways.
Light the funeral pyre.

'Cause only the brave hear the hammers ring,
kill preach the word of Thor.
Only heroes hear the Valkyrie sing,
axe in hand slain in war.

Are bourne to the Northwind of Valhalla,
Valhalla!

Sail off the edge of the world,
eternal battlefields.
The midnight sun forever rise.
Golden legions,
march with mace and shields.
Across blood stained skies.

See halls of splendour,
stand in the courts of kings.
Claim a warriors reward,
know what glory Lord Odin brings.
To live and die by the sword.

Are bourne to the Northwind of Valhalla,
Valhalla!

Blow wind blow,
now well go,
no more night,
the ends in sight Valhalla!
Valhalla!
Valhalla!
Valhalla!
