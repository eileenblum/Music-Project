Beyond the borders of Tartary,
where the black sun
is forever breaking up.
They guard from here to eternity,
Knights of chaos
are forever watching over us.

See them feast upon the blood of angels,
God nor Demon death they bring.
Unholy order reaps the cursed dark spell,
He ascends now they kill their King.

Helldiver!
Helldiver!
The time's now at hand.

Helldiver!
Helldiver!
Come make your stand.

Helldiver!
Helldiver!
Evil in the land.

Helldiver!
Helldiver!
The sword of Damocles in your hand.

Mailed berserker sworn to slay,
eyes of fire baleful with burning gaze.
Beware the unjust are doomed to pay,
chainsaw tyres mad biker will decimate.

Fell into the dark dimensions,
night ranger sworn to just defy.
Steel sentinel hell spawn fury,
earth burial awaits you die!

Helldiver!
Helldiver!
The time's now at hand.

Helldiver!
Helldiver!
The time's now at hand.
