Everybody needs a plastic Jesus,
somebody give me cross to hold.
Gonna buy me a stairway to heaven,
evangelist wants all your gold.

The road to hell is paved with temptation,
righteousness thou shall not kill.
The innocent on the path to salvation,
babies die by god's own will.

Deliverance, deliver us!
From holy men and power games.
Deliverance, deliver us!
Religion is a sin,
don't die in its name!
Deliverance!

Everyone is so scared of dying,
no one can or will come back.
No good in simply relying,
on a God when it's fade to black.

Blind faith is never the answer,
just live now for today.
Forget about the here in after,
it doesn't matter anyway.

Deliverance, deliver us!
From holy men and power games.
Deliverance, deliver us!
Religion is a sin,
don't die in its name!
Deliverance!

Feel the sun now blinding my eyes,
see me raised on cross held high.
Wounds I bear I pray for you,
for they know not what they do!

Holy father my time has come,
holy ghost now receive your son.
Suffer not I pity them,
people of Jerusalem.

You know not what you do! ...Oh!

Deliverance, deliver us!
From holy men and power games.
Deliverance, deliver us!
Religion is a sin,
don't die in its name!
Deliverance!
