Out of the sea of radiation
he came,
From origin unknown.
No son of humanity,
a refugee from the twilight zone.

His gamma rays
they scatter the masses,
invincible field of force.
Protected while all is shattered,
Utopian dream takes course.

Inter dimensional fall out,
contaminates across the void.
Due to atomic testing,
worlds within worlds are destroyed
...by you!

No one can save us from the,
Anti Matter Man.
Fuck the hell that gave us this,
Anti matter man! 

He plans a chain reaction,
mutation of humanoid life.
Father of his own creation,
cuts through steel like a knife.

Proclaiming with an air
of cold defiance,
an end to the nuclear plan.
You've taken the laws of science,
into barbarian hands.

No one can save us from the,
Anti Matter Man.
Fuck the hell that gave us this,
Anti matter man! 

When his mission is over,
the reign of man will have had it's day.
Oh subhuman submission,
mutants in urban decayâ¦oh! 

Don't say this is the future?

Out of the sea of radiation
he came,
From origin unknown.
No son of humanity,
a refugee from the twilight zone.

No one can save us from the,
Anti Matter Man.
Fuck the hell that gave us this,
Anti matter man!
