With the dawn of the setting sun,
there's a bullet with your name on.
War machines is locked and loaded,
and it kills without hesitation.

Cause on and on the killing wheel turning,
houses, villages and towns are burning. Will the children ever learn to smile again?

Cycle of hate,
conspiracy of lies.
Moderation too late,
hatred inside of you.

Cycle of hate,
megaton surprise.
What is our fate?
Mutual assured destruction
â¦ Mutual assured destruction!

Our defences over run,
in a tide of devastation.
Itchy fingers pull the trigger,
ain't no time for capitulation.

Invading hearts and minds
of every nation,
ignorance an open invitation.
Lust for power,
ever planted in our brains.

Cycle of hate,
conspiracy of lies.
Moderation too late,
hatred inside of you.

Process of elimination,
lethal termination,
mass extermination.
Job well done!

Who cries for the children?
Who cries for anyone at all?

Cycle of hate,
conspiracy of lies.
Moderation too late,
hatred inside of you.
