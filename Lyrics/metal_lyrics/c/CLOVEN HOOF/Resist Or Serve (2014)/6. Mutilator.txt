You're all gonna Die!

Razor backed,
bringer of pain.
Laser bolts,
lance your brain.
Piling on the agony,
mechanoid brutality.

Tearing limbs,
and gouging eyes.
Sadistic butcher,
cleaves and scythes.
Liquidate humanity yeah,
crime is life let none go free.

Hell is now here,
all will fall.
God will not intervene at all.

Searching! Seeking! Destroying! Mutilator!
Burning! Breaking! Killing!
Mutilator!

Waging pure and bloody war, dreadnought settles old scores. Slaying his creator screams, slaughtered as the blood it redeems.

Doomsday reign in death,
separate you from your breath. Genocide across the land,
mass extinction close at hand.

He will spare no one,
steel wheels run.
The body count,
goes on and on.

Searching! Seeking! Destroying! Mutilator!
Burning! Breaking! Killing!
Mutilator!

The Earth is cleansed now,
and he stands alone.
Cathedral built from cartilage, shattered skulls and bone.

Corpses piled high,
up to the sky.
New worlds to rule, ravage,
and brutalize.

Hell is here now,
all will fall.
God will not intervene at all.

[2x]
Searching! Seeking! Destroying! Mutilator!
Burning! Breaking! Killing!
Mutilator!
