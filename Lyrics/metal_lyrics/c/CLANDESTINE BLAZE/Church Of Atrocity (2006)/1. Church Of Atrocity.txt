Dwelling in the chamber
Surrounded by divine images
They invoke the visions of terror
They desecrate all that is good and holy

Lord needs no bowing down for showing obedience
Strength of atrocity possesses those meant to be
To worship the work of cursed of mankind
Like destiny to be fulfilled

Like crowds cheering in front of crucifix
Howling in arenas of blood and bones
Blessed with sight of dark perspective
Blessed with abundance of deeds to worship

Torment / Murder / Destruction
Abuse / Sadism / Terror
Oppression / Hatred / Dominance
Sickness / Disease / Atrocity

Altars of atrocity decorated with grotesque tropies
Shadow of horror can be seen from grainy icons
Created by missionaries of cursed mankind

Servants of Church of Atrocity
Howl the meditative chant
Stare for icons of grotesque beauty
And see lord divine
