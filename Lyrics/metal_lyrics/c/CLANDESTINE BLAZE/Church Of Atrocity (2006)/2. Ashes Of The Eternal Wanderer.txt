Caged in unholy temples where
human life was revaluated
Cursed eternal wanderers who would
find their final earthly destination

Scorned in blazing furnaces of temples
Thrown in open massgraves
Burned till only gray ashes remind of their existence
Ashes of the eternal wanderer,
casting shadow over old continent

No home to be found beyond the temples of atrocity
