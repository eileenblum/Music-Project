Too many nights have passed by
Nothing has been done
Urge for revenge is rising
Total storm of purification

Unbroken seal of unbroken contract
Shattered to pieces with declaration of war

There's nothing final to be achieved
There's nothing final to be won
But inborn urge for destruction of opposite forces
Too strong to be denied
Soldiers of unknown cause
Storm of purification

Unbroken seal of unbroken contract
Shattered to pieces with declaration of war

Insanity is the gift of the torch bearer
... fuel from divine source
Denying the rules of humane certainties
... raging storm of madness

When new dawn rises
and soldiers have returned to caves
Ruin and disaster so unspeakable
Never wish to be seen again
Acts of terror have spoken
with language sheep understand
Warnings can be believed
Or proven again by storm of purification

Unbroken seal of unbroken contract
Shattered to pieces with declaration of war
