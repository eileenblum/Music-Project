in feet of the father
children crying for mercy
taking last breath 
before the eucharist

eat it 
- the blessed flesh
drink it 
- divine fluids from father

children of god
cry for mercy
children of god
pray for salvation

road to heaven is hard
father tests your faith
are you property of father?
are you one of the children of god?
