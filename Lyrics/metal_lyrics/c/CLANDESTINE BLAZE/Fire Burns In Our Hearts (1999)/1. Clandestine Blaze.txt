keep the evil world outside
close the doors, close kids eyes
fundamental religious life
bible truth, false raised youth 

you can't watch them all the time
you'll lose them sooner or later

fire burns in our heart
waiting to be relieved
eyes will be opened
lies will be detected

with all those punishments
for no reason
bible justification
gods hate towards man

slaves of the book of beliefs
live in their lies
they can't see blaze 
in our eyes

we are the ones
who hold the torch
and purge the world
with beautiful flames 

clandestine blaze
