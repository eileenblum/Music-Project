Act Of Ultimate Blasphemy
Hatred, Violence And Retribution
Misanthropic Strike Against holy Symbols Of Life 

Glare Of church Burning In Dark Night 
For Victims No Way Out

Scream Of Fear And Agony

Synagogas And Temples
Church's Buildings
All Set In Fire During the Night
Nothing Is To Be Saved

Stench Of Burning Human Flesh
Prayers For The Deaf Ears
Infernal Flames Destroying The Holy
And Torturing Humans To Death

Night Of The Unholy Fires
Nightmare Of The Believers
Turned Into Ugly Reality
Ultimate Act Of Blasphemy

Ultimate Blasphemy To Celebrate Victory
Victory Of Mans Strenght
Victory of Mans Will
Agains Pathetic Dead christ
