they come to our land
they told what to do
with power of sword
they brought us their lord

native resistance!

they destroyed the cultures
they destroyed the true knowledge
in the name of god
they turned history to the lie
people betrayed their roots
submitted to alienating religion
like poor sheeps
like Christians of today

native resistance!

gather the forces and prepare for revenge
we have been pushed down too long time
hate against forced religion
our war will continue till end

native resistance!

we'll destroy their landmarks
we'll pay back their crimes
power and might of church and organized religion
shall be purged away
