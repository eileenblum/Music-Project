Black shadow of Goat
Follows behind
When walking far away
from herd of human

"As he shall separate them one from another,
as a shephard divideth his sheep from the goats.
And he shall set the sheep on his right,
but the goats on his left"
[matthew 25: 32-33]

Refusal to run
with the flock
Not to be herded
separation, act of own will

doctrine of misanthropy
creative hatred for the herd
goat behavior
not living with the sheep
