There Comes The Day
When The World Falls Down
The World We Know Today
World The Human Rely On

There Comes The Day
When religions Fall Down
Dreams Are Demolished
Last Drops Of Hope Betrays believers

There Comes The Day
When Ideologies Fall Down
Order Turns To Chaos
Man Forgets His Humanity

There comes The Day
When Streets Are Colored With Blood
And Burden Of Humanity
Is Left Behind

New Page Of History Is Turning
In Domination Of Panic And Terror
Brothers And Sisters Killing Each others
Showing Direction Of The New World

Then Comes The Day
When Man Becomes The Beast
Realizes Basic Instincts
Of Survival Through Hostility
