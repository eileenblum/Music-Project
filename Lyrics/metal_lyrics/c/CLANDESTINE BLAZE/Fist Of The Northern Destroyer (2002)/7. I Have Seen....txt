I have seen the god
when world went in decline
When kill of the man
was committed under shadow of the cross

I have heard the god
when cries of child suffering
reached our damned ears
but nobody was to care

I have smelled the god
when victims of gruesome murders
rotted deep in the vast forests
half eaten by beasts

In the mind of weakness
something touches those souls
who crave of power and might
of immortal power

I have touched the god
when pulling out the knife from believer
I have found god in myself
looking for desperation of mankind in amusement
