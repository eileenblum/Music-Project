Endless return to path chosen long ago
Rituals unseen and unheard
From shadows of tragic loss to triumph into highest form
Endurance of Supremacist Ritual
Shadow consuming the deception of Lifeforce
Draining all once taught as necessity
Leaving only Spiritual Skeletal form
To annihilate ego of man
To die in mind of oneself
To leave only possessed spirit.
To rise from the grave of meaninglessness
To Deliver Supremacist Might
Over swarming insects
Endurance of Supremacist Ritual
Shadow consuming the deception of Lifeforce.
