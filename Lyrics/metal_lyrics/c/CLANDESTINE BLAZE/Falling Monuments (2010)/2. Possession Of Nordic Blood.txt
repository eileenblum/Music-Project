Descent of the Nordic bloodline
tied to undefined heritage,reclusive,suffocated,
possessed wind.
Grinning from shadows
Looking the world through possession of the Nordic Blood
Fuelled by nectar of possession
Ready to fight with fury
World calls for submission and change
Nordic blood retreats nowhere
Feed the fury
Call the victory
Nordic blood retreats nowhere.
