Burning will leaves no peace
The call demands response
Role is gift, the way out
From maggoty apathy.
Answer the call to the battlefields
In times of mental emptiness
The Code of the Warrior
Dedication to accepted role.
To seek no reason for losing
To seek no reason for apathy
Legacy of pride!
Triumphant glory running in blood!
End of our times means nothing
Divine quality of creed is curse and blessing
Answers it provides strength it manifests
The end shall make no difference!
