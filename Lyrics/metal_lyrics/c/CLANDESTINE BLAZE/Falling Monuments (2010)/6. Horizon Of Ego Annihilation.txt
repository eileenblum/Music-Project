Seen the annihilation in Horizon.
Been on the edge of cathartic purification
Strife of the worlds colliding - Ripping self apart.
Distracted wreck crawling to directions of blind man
Unable to see victorious path!
Unable to go through transformation!
It awaits, it demands
It commands for the sacrifice.
So little to give so close to go
Horizon of Annihilation ahead
The birth as new life form
Higher than glorified shell
All has been given up
Now nothing stands on the Way!
