Beauty of texture of Blood over tainted surface
Fresh reflections of desperation in the mirrors of soul
Already seen the hopelessness of stepping on other side
Already received taste of awaiting void
Organic structures treated as sculpture for the grotesque needs
Every detail painfully adjusted to serve the purpose of Icon of Worship.
Beauty of texture of blood over tainted surface
Fresh reflections of desperation in the mirror of soul
Already seen the hopelessness of stepping on other side
Already received taste of awaiting void
The grotesque choir is the Gospel for sinister ears
Martyr of the Ritual. Sacrificial Sculpture.
Only the call of funeral bells will set her free
Only being swallowed by cemetery soil will put end for the howls.
