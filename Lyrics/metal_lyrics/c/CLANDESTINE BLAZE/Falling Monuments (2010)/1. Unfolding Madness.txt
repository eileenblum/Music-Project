Experience of the world around,Hazardously cut open by sharp surreal perception
This rotting corpse plagued by disease. So limited, so unreal, so distant
Floating in cold dimensions of possession, Watching the inhabited shell in disbelief
Madness unfolding in mind, seeking ways of blossom in full
Is it path to enlightenment? Or route to final disorder?
Shattering Physical world - Unfolding madness.
Witnessing what sane can't see, Passing the gateways beyond humane
Feeding the damaging current, drowning in the merciless stream.
