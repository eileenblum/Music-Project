Thoughts are obsessing the mind
Like the haunting demons
They never let you
Drown in damnation of common man

Thoughts of homicide
Plans for murder
Everywhere I go
Comes inspiration to kill

Will for this awaken by surroundings
The miserable mankind
Thoughts possessing in silence
Strategies for mass-extermination

Will to kill
Will to eliminate the man
Satisfaction from ending life
Of someone you hate
Someone you deeply despise
And look down in disgust
