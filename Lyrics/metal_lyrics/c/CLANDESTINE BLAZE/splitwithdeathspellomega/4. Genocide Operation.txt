Destroyed, humiliated, killed still while alive
Skeletal bodies, eyes full of emptiness
Stench of death floating over moist soil
Where creatures dig graves for themselves

You lead to the death and creatures will follow
Will and power of mind exists no more
Cut their wrists and command to lie in grave
And their own do the rest

Buried bodies, piled corpses
Burned filthy flesh
Charred remains of the children
Mutilated corpses of women
Mutilated corpses of women
Crushed bodies of men
Altogether, like garbage
Just like they are,
Just like they are...

Lead them to death and they will follow
You command and they submit
No glory, no victory, nothing
Genocide operation, wiping out the worthless
