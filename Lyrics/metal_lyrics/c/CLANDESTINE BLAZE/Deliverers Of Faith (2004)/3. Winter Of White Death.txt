Ancient fears has returned
To minds of folk
In the glare of burning woods
Hiding from biting white death
Fullmoon on the blackness
Glowing in deadly clarity
Frozen worlds
Touching with life-ending spikes
Stiffening corpses
In grip of white death
Burying the weak
Under veil of frost
World has humans collapsed
Ancient fears has returned
Winter of white death...
