Cold flesh in the dark gutter
Bound, gagged, and destroyed
Once again abused in secrecy
Scorned in the insane fire
Fire of ultimate will
Fire of the logic, under command
Houses of lord in blaze of destruction
Charred icons tainted with blood, seed and feces
Blasphemed holy construction
Altar in front of mentally tortured herd
Veil of damnation covers the mind
Beyond the reason
Beyond the explanation
Herd remains speechless in front of devastation
Demanding logic, demanding reason
Never able to see, never able to understand
Insanity of ultimate will
Veil of damnation covers the mind
Beyond the reason
Beyond the explanation
