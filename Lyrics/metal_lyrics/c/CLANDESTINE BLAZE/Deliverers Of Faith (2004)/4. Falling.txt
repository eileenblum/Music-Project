Digged yourself into deepest pits
Suffered with self inflicted diseases
Scorning yourself with depravity
Sinking further into lies and betrayal
Another flame burned
To dark charred remains
Another servant giving up and failing
To demands of purity
Sworn obedience for who you curse in secrecy
In the world of shadows
Darkness grows
Might of Christ is fading
Adversary has won!
Adversary sitting high on his throne
Watching the children of god waging war on themselves
Reflecting of evil watching in your mirror
Shadows growing in your fading light
Burning eye, wide open to see the falling.
