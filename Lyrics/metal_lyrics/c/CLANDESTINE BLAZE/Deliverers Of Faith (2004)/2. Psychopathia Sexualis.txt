So fragile is the earthly domain of human life
Much it wriggles in agony
When shadow of evil will is laid upon it
It's destiny was to be broken to pieces, to be torn by the power of deathlust
It is the clandestine fire, burning inside, feeding the evil will
Burning and scorning until it needs to be manifested
Lust sickness, for evil will
Blood runs among the tears, when flesh is used like...
Carving the manifest in living skin
Clandestine lust, seeking pleasure from suffering humanity
Leaving signs of degraded humanity, to haunt among the herd
There are beasts among you.
