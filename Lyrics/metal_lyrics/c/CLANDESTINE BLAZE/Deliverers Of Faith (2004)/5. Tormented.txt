Once more hunt begins
Lusting for the trophies
Visions and feelings of sheep
Certified in front of their adversary
Pleasures of confusion
Seed of tormenting nightmares
Sparks of uncomfortable fire
Scorching unprepared purity
The tormented and tormentor
Infected and deliver of the disease
Once been hunted
Now forwarding the judgement
