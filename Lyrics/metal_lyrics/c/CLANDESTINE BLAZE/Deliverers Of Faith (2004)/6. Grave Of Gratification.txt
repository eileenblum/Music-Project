Like demonized creatures
Screaming with lunacy inducing voices
Obsessions of possessed mind
Leads to shadows of graveyards
Holy soil lures to be tainted
Purity demands for balance
Stones of remembrance
Invokes wish to pursue carnality
So innocent must have been
The child of God
Who was taken so early
So much pain and depression
She delivered to world
While laying deep in the holy soil
No man is witnessing
moments of joy and degrading
Grave of gratification stands as monument
Of clandestine blasphemy between man and fragile god
