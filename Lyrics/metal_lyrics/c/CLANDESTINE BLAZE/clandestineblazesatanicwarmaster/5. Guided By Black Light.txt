I have chosen the dark side
I have felt the touch of
the mental plague
Consuming all that was
once human

I'm the poison, I'm the disease
darkening your light
infecting you with lethal curse

My light is your darkness
your suffering is my gratification
I'm the disease living in,
consuming in your paradise
