Lit the black candles
Expose the flesh in dim light
In glory of animalistic carnal lust
Desecrate purity in altar of perversion

Pain, pleasure, sadism
Blood, filth, abuse, satisfaction
On altar of perversion
Carnal lust rituals begin

Blasphemous ritual act
Glorifying own darker animal side
Horn of fertility wastes seed of life
Into hole of excrement

Sweat, excrement, humiliation
Saliva, stench, penetration
on altar of perversion
Carnal lust rituals begin

Altar of perversion in grim light
serves as gate to unknown
How much further can man go
What is waiting on the other side of inhibition

In rituals of carnal lust
Slaves baptized in master's semen
To become followers
or remain as abused souls
