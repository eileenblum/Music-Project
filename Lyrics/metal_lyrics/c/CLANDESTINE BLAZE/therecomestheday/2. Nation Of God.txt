They see the biblical promises coming true
You'll see rotten faith filthy zionist conspiracy
Sacred - untouchable, Forbidden - closed form your minds
Sacred is what we spit on, all what is forbidden we reveal
We shall never bow down, in front of culture of gods nation
Illusions of biblical promises vanish, in stench of napalm
This pleases our atrocity fetish, I can see the solution
