Last of the emotions
Have vanished in the dead world
Empathy died in slash of steel
Funeral of humanity
Funeral of humanity
Inside the cold dead minds
Funeral mass without sadness or regret
Funeral of humanity
Tears dried, laughter ended
Cold grin in face of living corpse
Hunt like animal, kills like animal, on the instinct
Funeral of humanity
Values and moral codes
Gone in the void of nihilism
