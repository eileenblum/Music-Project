No god
no religion
no race
no culture

No nation
no state
no collective world
Praise the self

I glorify myself!
I satisfy myself!
I am not lower than your god.
I am setting the rules of this existence

My reasons do not need
to look any more rational than his.
My reasons do not need to be explained
one bit more than His.
