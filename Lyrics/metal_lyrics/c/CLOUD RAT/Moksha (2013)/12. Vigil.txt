Hera,
All we will be left with is cinder and ash.
Let him bravely turn to face his actions.
Penance? Carcasses.
Show an impulse of compassion.
Spirits aspire to the sky; condors.
Don't worry. You will be loosely tied.
Crossing repitition, the march goes on.
Drone. Drone. Drone. Engine eating coal.
Shipped alive, will our species even survive?
Becoming the destroyer of skyscrapers,
Our component parts will be ripped out.
Biological strings of intestines,
Buried deep in the ground.
What part of the genome will survive?
Simply love.
We shouldn't survive.
We shouldn't exist.
All of the sudden, Earth.
My chest feels heaven.
