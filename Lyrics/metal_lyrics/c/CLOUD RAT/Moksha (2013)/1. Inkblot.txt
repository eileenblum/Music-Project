Dresses dancing against a boundless breeze.
Orgasm rolling forth...
Big yellow buses. Big purple bruises.
Breaking nails, dirt hiding under.
You know just where to touch me.
That place, that special gaze.
Nothing compares to touch. Piano fingers, cold and unlaced.
To scare me is to win me. To stain me is to scar me.
Inkblot butterflies dwell in temples.
But itâs for her, not you.
Iâm sorry you feel sick.
Inkblot moisture feeding, feeling.
Inkblot test.
Inkblot bleached right through,
Pouring to the other side.
Pouring.
You...
