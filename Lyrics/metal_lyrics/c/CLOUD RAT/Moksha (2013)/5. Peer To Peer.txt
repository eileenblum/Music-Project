Fucking for all to see.
Puckering lips.
Used and abused; Delete.
Holograms float by like cyber spiderwebs.
Shards of images broken piece by piece.
Look at you, a shadowed complex.
Here we are again without a name.
Hypnotizing a lustful sonnet,
Falling back to close his eyes.
Rows and rows of feeders skillfully cheating you out of your life.
Creeps.
Wait âtil you see the latest format.
