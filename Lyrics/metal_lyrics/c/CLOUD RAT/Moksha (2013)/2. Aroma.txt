...Should have let me choose, shouldnât have you?
Rebellion leading to freedom.
Burned alive.
I smell you, I smell like you.
I am awake and inside out.
âAwful punishment awaits bad people..." Jenny taught me.
And it will be heroic to try and stop me...
Itâs still happening and itâs not changing, so youâre lying lying lying.
My voice is in your throat and it all must burn burn burn.
