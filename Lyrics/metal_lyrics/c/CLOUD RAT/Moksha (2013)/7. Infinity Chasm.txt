I watched you walking outside, picking flowers.
Holding your hand in the park running.
Seeing you grow and come into your own.
If only I could keep time from catching up with us eventually.
Forgive me, I canât save you from that.
Feeling your breath for the last time,
Panic as you close your eyes.
I wish I could carry you with me...
Into the eternal, living in the happiest moments.
