Inside my woes creep.
Entangling this strange black hole I call my heart.
Everything sounds so good to me now:
Hives of honey,
Sweet beaded eyes,
My strange fixation on your hands.
Pulling at my hair, a sea of acid dripping down my oars,
Out to sea; Happy.
But itâs cold like a draft.
Dressed up, tore down.
Twisted bodies fall to the floor,
Like slugs in this circle.
We are one.
