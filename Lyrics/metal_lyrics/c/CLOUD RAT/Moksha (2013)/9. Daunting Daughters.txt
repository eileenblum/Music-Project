This place feels different somehow,
Inside eight walls stretched long.
Discourse of highness - Herbal attraction.
Fell into my hands... Daydreaming things that are sad.
I ask myself why? Who am I questioning? Who?
Thereâs no one in front of me.
Just breathe the breath,
Like a wind I couldnât find.
Like a wind in winterâs time.
Daunting daughters weâre trying to help.
Anya Mama glacial.
Such a sad face...
Sheâs got such a sad face to see when sheâs sleeping.
