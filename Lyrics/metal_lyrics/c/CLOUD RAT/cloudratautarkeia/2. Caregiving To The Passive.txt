[performed by Cloud Rat]I hold my treasure deep within my hand, "Just look, o' sweet one." 
Bite sized with half shut eyes. 
Delicious, I begin to quiver. 
I feel my power, now full as a flooding ocean. 
I see the gaze of the shattered rocks biting at my feet. 
I bend down to console my cut body, as I feel the gloves come at me. 
The sweetness that is so subtle kisses away at my mind. 
This is the sorrow that lurks in my bliss. 
Breathe deep. 
Confusion takes me away. 
Breathe deep.
