[performed by Cloud Rat]You cant you canât you canât
Treat me like this.
Wicked and winged rubbing my eyes.
Thereâs no limit to what a mind can absorb.
A pounding, pulsating anger that is no longer humyn.
Glorified Dawn, I spit in your face.
Come at me, try and eat your most precious host.
Give me the soul of a giver, teacher-preacher.
My roses will bloom where the tide touches the sky.
