[performed by Cloud Rat]The leaves have this curl to them;
Racing past, golden hues like wisps of a horse tail not yet fenced in.
No more stiffening of this black substance.
This is more beautiful than pleasure I read. 
One by one they fall, taking the last year with them. 
Away from me.
Candy apple red; I want my lips to match.
But I can only see the glow around me,
Shedding its skin. 
And full like everything else,
It helps me molt then retreat.
Iâm so fucking sick of being humyn.
