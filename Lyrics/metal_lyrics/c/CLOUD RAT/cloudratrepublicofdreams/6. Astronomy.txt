[performed by Cloud Rat]Dealing. I'm always just dealing.
Strewn about, pulled too thin. 
Thinking about whatâs about to rip.
"I think I know you from a past life."
Being cautious, always watching my back.
Iâve been attracted to you like a fly to a mucus trap.
Iâve always been wrestling your internal pain.
Woke up from dreams, 
Where I undressed you from a priestly gown.
I played with dangerous toys and suffered a catastrophe.
It began with deafness and shut me down, 
Now with dreadful shrieks.
The lights go out. 
The house shakes and implodes on itself.
Concave-mirrored walls, 
My head has bred its very own version of distress.
