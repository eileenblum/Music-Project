[performed by Cloud Rat]I am the worm that moves from page to page,
Reaching for his arm, patched-up stripped sleeve.
Steel spirals shine from their vests.
This is madness. Pure darkness.
Burning death-flies and contorted flesh.
Looking from the line, they mumbled. 
Streams of steam tumble. 
Drifting from our gums...
A wish for the clouds; pure harsh rain.
I am the mixed menace.
I am the half-bred whore.
They didnât ask for anything but our mothers forest floor.
