She spends the day with a smile on her face. 
Pat on the head, the simplest reflection. 
Grant her some satisfaction. 
Everything she is, I want to be. 
Nothing in her mind, no sense to worry. 
All I ever wanted was to be pain free. 
Digging a hole to sleep. 
Curling and twisting to sleep. 
Sweat and hair to sleep. 
Pain free.
