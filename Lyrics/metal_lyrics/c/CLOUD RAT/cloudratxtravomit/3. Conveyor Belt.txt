[performed by Cloud Rat]Isolation; the feeling of an ant mindset. 
Too small, too small. 
Isolation; pretending to be someone I'm not. 
If I would have known I would feel like this, I wouldn't have hid or cared. 
Isolation; I won't leave this room. 
I won't leave. 
I sit in this multi-colored stall, conveyor belt, smoked furnace. 
I'm chained to these words. 
I'm chained to my mind.
