[performed by Cloud Rat]Conceived by wires, my birth was when they built the tower. 
Hidden message fed through everyone's words. 
Wires upon wires stay in flight like snakes, wrap themselves around us. 
Power; energy is the god. 
GLASS MOVING STEEL. 
Obsolete. 
No flesh, no heart, no need. 
Programmed.
