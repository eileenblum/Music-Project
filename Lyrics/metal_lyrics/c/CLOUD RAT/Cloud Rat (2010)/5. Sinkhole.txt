You're upset in a dark world where we all get ignored.
Where I'm subjected, you're rejected, and he doesn't want you around.
My insides are coming out. Our minds are destroying themselves.
The mirror is everything we think we are.
Everything we are not.
I am nothing. I am nothing.
I poison my own body to treat myself.
My body is the battleground where I hate myself.
But there's nothing wrong with me. There's nothing wrong.
I am something. I am. I am.
