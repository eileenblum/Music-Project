Forefather's got a gun.
Forefather love's everyone.
Forefather's got a gun,
Say's he'll save everyone.
Why don't you love me? Why don't you want me?
Forefather, lift us up. Impending doom, breaking crust.
Forefather, save me please. Five years old, I'm on my knees.
She barks like a dog protecting her rats.
I was just thrown outside. Out with the trash.
