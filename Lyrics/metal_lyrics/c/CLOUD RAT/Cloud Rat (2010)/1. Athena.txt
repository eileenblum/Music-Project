I don't need a cloud to tell me I'm alright, with the space in between.
Dead, buried in the ground. That's it, there's nothing else.
I don't need you to tell me I'm going to hell.
Scared eyes, wet little face. Life shoved in my face.
I can't stand you, I don't know you.
I am a monster.
Dead, buried in the ground. That's it, there's nothing else.
