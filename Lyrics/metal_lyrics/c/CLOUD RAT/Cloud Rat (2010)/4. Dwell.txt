You said to me we will float away like the ships you see.
Oh my heart sings to you. But you're poisoned so dark, and the fog is too thick.
Should I lay with you in death? I know I should sail away alone.
I watch like a hawk as you lean and fade. Does it feel good to burn away?
As he filters and pierces through your skin. Sweet relief, the pain is finally gone.
Hand in mouth, you shake me. You know what I'm thinking.
Fuck you for thinking I would be happy.
But I will sit with you and coddle the womb, I won't leave you, I won't. I won't leave you.
They only sedate. They only sedate.
