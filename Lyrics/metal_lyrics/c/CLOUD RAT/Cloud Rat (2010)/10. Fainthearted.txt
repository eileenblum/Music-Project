I hate love. I despise it, actually.
When I wanted it, it would leave me.
I can't stand it, it haunts me.
Oh they all haunted me. They all haunted me.
What a warped sense of mind, to tell me that everything is fine.
A little at a time.
It's the thing that just beats me, it beats me every time.
