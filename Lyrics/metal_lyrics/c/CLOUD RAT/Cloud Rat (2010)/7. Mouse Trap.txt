No hot water to cleanse my skin.
Empty holes we've fallen in.
Please mommy, make me clean. 
Give me something to eat.
This trash and piss just piles up.
My bed smells and I've got no socks.
I was looking to you for guidance. 
You were living on the couch.
This trash and piss just piles up.
You're like a little kid.
If you're so depressed, 
Why do you want to live?
