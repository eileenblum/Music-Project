Why you sent to me,
A thought for all to see.
Can I, God, get outside these lines?
You are the one to design a system too complex to break.
Can't I think?
My life as quick as a blink.
Can't I fucking think?
I, God, can't get outside these lines.
You are the one to design a system too complex to break.
Can't I think?
A system too complex to break.
