Thickness you seem to see, rolling and coarse.
DO you want to live with me, like me?
There's not a chance. Never was a choice.
Cutting black confetti, it's all from my hair.
Disrupting ecosystems. Hauling the art away.
Point your mouth, asphyxiate. Come along, crisis.
Kerosene, wet my mouth. Holy dwelling habitat.
Enemy erection. Stuffed animals. Ashes.
Will we have enough oxygen to sing on our own?
Drainage sucking industrial love. Water well empty.
"Arson is a form of self-expression,
In a place where you can't express yourself."
Elders, to kids, know in their brains:
This whole fucking neighborhood is gonna burn down,
I'm afraid, one day.
