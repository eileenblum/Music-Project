Delaying executions.
Behind a bulletproof wall.
Get on your hind feet you fucking dog.
- These things, regarding the head -
the cops holds a thin sword above the inmate's body.
"Sentences to suffer for those you made suffer."
Cocktail jester/magnifying glass.
Writing, summoning pain. No mercy machine.
This new kind of killer, search party, plastic tray.
Drawn and quartered.
Shaking violently, muscular deterioration.
In the ache of a longing pain.
His back is cold, but he can still feel his whole body burning.
