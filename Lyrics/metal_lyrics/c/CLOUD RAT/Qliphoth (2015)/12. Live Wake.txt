Lick it up.
The fertility differs from person to person.
Slow cascading urination; way of life; unwanted guests.
Will you press the flowers I gave you? In glass?
Are you hovering, or just laying on your back?
Day by day, the mold I smell in this hospital gown...
Spiders weave around my head.
Silk curtains for my bed.
So, would I live this life's brief span?
Roll me. Ween me. Leave me on my side.
Encore medicaid. Loose hair I wrap around.
Vultures swarming, waiting for the bill.
I can see their reflections
Dollar store smell.
