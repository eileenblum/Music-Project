Rising from under a sheet, a corpse that still has skin.
Painted nails, navy blue. "Urine ball little girl."
Take her boots off one by one.
Apa smiles as he runs away. A silent crushed ant.
Let you kick you in the face.
Booze dressed on her every day.
Driving the kids, not to play, but to be the spectacle.
Stolen prizes you cheated to get us,
From a traveling carnival.
I heard you died in your sleep.
The woman you killed was the one to call upon me.
I laid back in the bath... No water, just clothes.
