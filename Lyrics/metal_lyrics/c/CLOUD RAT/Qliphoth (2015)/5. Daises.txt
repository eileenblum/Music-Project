Toppling over, I see you in the window.
Red orange leaves covering your cuts,
Little incisions made just for us.
If you hear something like a wave, come find me.
Keep those eyes shut tight, As you make yourself bleed.
You've closed the window, And now I sing outside.
Hummingbird loose, different guts you collect.
Only stay a month or two.
Internet loves that fuck the love out of you.
Dear girl, I could have their hearts. Deliver them in parts.
I'm outside your window, and I can still see you.
