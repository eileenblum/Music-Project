Don't look at me for answers. Look to the sky.
Swear on your life. So ashamed of your lies.
You won't be forgiven.
Constantly questioning your motives.
Confused by the process of your thoughts.
Sick to death of guessing games.
Tired of your dull-edges blame.
Aren't you ashamed?
Please enlighten me. Do you take yourself seriously?
Your straight-faced explanations never fail to disappoint.
I'm ashamed. So ashamed.
I don't want to see you, no.
I have another face now - that one.
That one that you knew remains forever in your pupils.
You won't be forgiven.
