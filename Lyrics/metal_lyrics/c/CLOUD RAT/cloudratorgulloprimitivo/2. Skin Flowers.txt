Crawling up my cold feet, I sink into the end of the couch. 
Looking at your entrails, I bite my tongue. 
I feel a whisper of dead pleasure swindling away what I stand for. 
You lick my throat as my eyes roll back into my skull. 
Lifted up and rolled over, an invisible rope is strewn across the arm rest. 
Tell me this is how you cracked all your other puppets. 
You smile and wait for me to decide whatâs best. 
Set in stone, my fate was never complex. 
These snakes will leave your heart and fill the whole in my chest.
