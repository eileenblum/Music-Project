70 percent prairie, I care no more for laws. 
Crushed under tongues. 
Can I be a potter? One that can build subterranean tombs, 
Just like the cops? 
Ornamentals of truth, Out of reach of our children. 
Gagged and molested. 
Don't trust the bonds. Flat-faced; replaceable. 
Nations pass. Half day, half night.
