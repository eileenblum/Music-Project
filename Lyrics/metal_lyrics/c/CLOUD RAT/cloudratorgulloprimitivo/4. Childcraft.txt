"I like pulling out your baby teeth." 
Looking down at the twelve-year-old girl, 
String-to-finger. 
Scalping her bones. Shunts in the brain. 
No remorse to the little one. 
Growing. Closing. Losing her sense of wonder. 
Why wander anymore? Itâs safer now. 
Shit-sack of bones in a bow, 
Sets it in front of you. 
I donât want to remember how bad it felt 
To manually turn their heads; 
To walk them to their deaths. 
Burning their iris', I put her to bed. 
Youâre safe now.
