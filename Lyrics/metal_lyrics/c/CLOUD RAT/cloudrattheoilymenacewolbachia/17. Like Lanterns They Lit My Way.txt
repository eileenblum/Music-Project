[performed by Cloud Rat]I turned to look at the oncoming traffic... me and them, is there something I should look for? 
Razorblade backs couldn't sting me enough. 
In this incredible deliverance, headlights; The Way. 
This ticking beetle in my throat made me cough blood. 
Mother time holds her arms so beautifully, welcoming me into her throne. 
Take it away. 
Take me away.
