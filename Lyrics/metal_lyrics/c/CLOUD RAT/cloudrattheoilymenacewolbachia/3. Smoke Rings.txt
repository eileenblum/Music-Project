[performed by Cloud Rat]To give up his body for the good of his species is all he knows. 
To plunder and put him in a submissive hold is why she floats. 
Domination is achieved by aggression; to torture and serve. 
Left unnourished and unwanted, you must work to grow. 
The greatest myth of all: Our workers are created by maternal manipulation. 
The harmonies of nature, the social classes of flowers. 
But the mighty systems are but tiny grains of sand.
