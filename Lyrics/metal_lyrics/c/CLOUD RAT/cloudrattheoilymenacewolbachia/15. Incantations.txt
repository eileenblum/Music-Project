[performed by Cloud Rat]Pissing blood, she smells like her bed. 
She casts little spells all over her body. 
Flicking the syringe, her jewel toned eyes look like a sea serpent's. 
Sedated and screaming, the chemicals in her mind form a perfect toxic cocktail. 
All she does is worry, rocking back and forth. 
Lonely. 
Lonely. 
Lonely. 
"I feel it in me." 
She's like a hole: Dressed in shreds and scared to death. 
Take my blood and see whats wrong.
