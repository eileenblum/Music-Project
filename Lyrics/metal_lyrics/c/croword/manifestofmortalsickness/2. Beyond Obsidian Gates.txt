The path is hidden. Beyond reach it lies 
A blood red sunset stricken with oblivion 
For aeons in silence buried in the shadow 
The arcane found its grave 

Deeply carved in the flesh of the earth 
A passage of time shrouded in myth 
An unspeakable horror ensnared behind 
Beyond the obsidian gates 

Lost in time 
Seals unbroken 
A secret obscure 
Waiting to be unveiled 

At the end of a relentless quest 
Staring through the gaping darkness 
Abomination lurking beyond 
The roaring silence is broken 

Deeply carved in the flesh of the earth 
A passage of time shrouded in myth 
An unspeakable horror ensnared behind 
Beyond the obsidian gates 

Lost in time 
Seals unbroken 
A secret obscure 
Waiting to be unveiled 

Lost in time 
Seals unbroken 
A secret obscure 
Waiting to be unveiledÂ
