the years has carved your skin 
ingrained your strides, burst your heart 
so near but still too far, to reach, 
wooden arms would never feel beauty 

they just turned to gray 
in this longest fall 
leaves you lost 
cloak the path, that divided one heart 

their shells will be our plunder 
fall to break the season 
these are the last steps of our eldered kingdom 
winters cold chains the vital crown of grace 

their marks has turned to dust 
born new and turn the soil to stone 
as centuries forgot our grief 
oath on our lips are the ivy around our neck 

which carries the plague 
and spits it own beauty 
a loss of words 
a dance in motionless 

their shells will be our plunder 
fall to break the season 
these are the last steps of our eldered kingdom 
winters cold chains the vital crown of grace 

see there, the pride is falling 
above from the roarings of the stars 
two shells but one heart 
not envy could cover their love 

there we stand for aeons 
rusted by the autumns sun 
Fall to understand 
the death waits in our groves 

their shells will be our plunder 
fall to break the season 
these are the last steps of our eldered kingdom 
winters cold chains the vital crown of grace
