You`re, the single, a servent in wretchedness, 
shades blinded, by the emperiors sun, 
tarnished into the farthest far 
go! and deliver, deliver the message of the dead 

there it lies - the midest of the world, 
piled high in its sediment 
nothing reaches through this 
least the message of a dead 

barren, he crawls through the innerst palace 
chest crowned by the emperiors sun, 
breaking into the endless strains 
if he would ever reach the gates - nothing will be gained 

there it lies - the midest of the world, 
piled high in its sediment 
nothing reaches through this 
least the message of a dead 

there it lies - the midest of the world, 
piled high in its sediment 
You sit at your window 
and dream when nights burst in
