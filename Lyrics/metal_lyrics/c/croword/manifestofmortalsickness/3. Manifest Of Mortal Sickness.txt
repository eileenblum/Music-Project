My trace lost in dead mountain's land 
There you lie in chains, laid to rest 
Two worlds, but no home 
loneliness of darkness lies in your cry 

Here I am 
You're searchin' for 
Twisted Grin in triumph 
as death crowned your neck 

Flying free 
Into the fortress of nothingness 
Blindness guides your emergence 
A manifest of mortal sickness 

"Leave me!" but nothing waits there 
I'm the one, you are striving for 
gone to kingdom come, you're leaving both 
Damage done as vast yaws embrace me 

Here I am 
You're searchin' for 
Twisted Grin in triumph 
as death crowned your neck 

Flying free 
Into the fortress of nothingness 
Blindness guides your emergence 
A manifest of mortal sickness 

There I stand 
kings of woe cry for flesh 
take me back 
tear a hole in my chest 

lay me in your arms 
so that the void, the void embraces me 
here I lay and sleep, 
there I turned to lie 

veil me in your shades 
so the void, the void can maul me 
a world deseased in innocence 
for a world, sorrowdrawned 

Flying free 
Into the fortress of nothingness 
Blindness guides your emergence 
A manifest of mortal sickness
