[Music: A. Jakobson, O. PÃ¥lsson, Lyrics: A. Jakobson]

Sinister silence
Forced into nothing
Terror commenced
In the contaminated void
Dead freezing cold
Kept in a psychic box
Like a story untold
He was the perverted toy

Growing... The seeds of his death
The silent state is the way to decay
Rotting... With a mind dead and gone
He is likely to die

Soulless statue
Devoid of motion
There's no virtue
In the contaminated void
Mentally carbonized
A cancerous soul
Numb and desensitized
Dead and reborn: Paranoid

Growing... The seeds of his death
The silent state is the way to decay
Rotting... With a mind dead and gone
He is likely to die

Unveiled secrets will haunt them
Public anger rise
Disturbing, sick visions now become clearer
We all despise

Sinister silence
Forced into nothing
Terror commenced
In the contaminated void
Dead freezing cold
Kept in a psychic box
Like a story untold
He was the perverted toy

Growing... The seeds of his death
The silent state is the way to decay
Rotting... With a mind dead and gone
He is likely to die
