[Music: A. Bertilsson, A. Jakobson, O.PÃ¥lsson, Lyrics: A. Bertilsson]

A painful, drawn-out death
Youâll get whatâs coming your way
Merely a fraction of the suffering that you have caused
Youâve led a double life, of torture, rape and murder
Sadistic acts, carried out in bursts of rage

In this world, thereâs no cure for your sickness
Our time, poisoned, plagued by your existence
Death is all you see... in these endless fields of misery!

...When youâre done...
Another life has ended
Are you proud? Do you feel satisfied?
A helpless victim builds a sense of power in you
But that power will soon be ripped to shreds!

In this world, thereâs no cure for your sickness
Every human poisoned, plagued by your existence
Death is all you see... in these endless fields of misery!

[Solo: A. Bertilsson]

They died in vain, enduring sickening pain
Your victims, all slain, to you it is a game
Never felt shame, since media gives you fame
âMurdererâ is your name, and you deserve all blame!

In this world, thereâs no cure for your sickness
Everything... poisoned, plagued by your existence
Death is all you see... in these endless fields of misery!
