[Music: A. Jakobson, Lyrics: A. Jakobson]

In my mind, there is a voice
It tells me to destroy the world
Itâs all right, I love debris
I love to see things fall apart
Rampage, I'm in a rage
I canât wait to tear it down
Watch out, evacuate
Before I kill you by mistake

Scanning the skies for a sign
Waiting for buildings to collapse

In my mind, there is a mess
All tangled up and black as death
Itâs all right, âcause I love death
And the smell of burning things
Annihilate, I cannot wait
My mission is yet not complete
I'm insane, I see that now
I think the voice is really mine

Scanning the skies for a sign
Waiting for buildings to collapse
I want to see the world in ruins, going up in flames
Laughing maliciously
Waiting for buildings to collapse

I am insane, my mind is set to blow
Madness reigns, soon the world will know

Scanning the skies for a sign
Waiting for buildings to collapse
I want to see the world in ruins, going up in flames
Laughing maliciously
Waiting for buildings to collapse
