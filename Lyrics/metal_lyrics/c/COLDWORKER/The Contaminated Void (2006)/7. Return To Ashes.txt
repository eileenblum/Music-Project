[Music: A. Jakobson, A. Alvinzi, Lyrics: J. Fornbrant]

Descending
Iâm lowered into the ground
Returning to ashes and dirt
In the casketâs confines
Oblivion bound
Consumed by the earth

Life-like
Flowers adorn mournerâs hands
A funeral procession in bloom
An ironic parade
Life eternal interred,
Immortalityâs doom

Returning to ashes and dirt
Dreading
