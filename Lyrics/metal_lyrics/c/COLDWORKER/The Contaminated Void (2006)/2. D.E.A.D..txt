[Music: A. Bertilsson, A. Jakobson, A. Alvinzi, Lyrics: A. Bertilsson]

Disconnect from all that is true
Eradicate what used to be you
Annihilate in blind servitude
Demoralize until our demise
Salvation was never the key
Before a lie, we won't fall to our knees
Ravage and burn, it's all by the book
Sermons of old, fits us in the mold, while for answers we look

Predictions of doom
Shrouds the world in gloom

Walk in line, just a servant of the fools
Another burden to bear
Enslaved, restrained by limiting rules
It's a daymare...

Disconnect from all that is true
Eradicate what used to be you
Annihilate in blind servitude
Demoralize until our demise
Convert and conquer â a legacy of hate
Rule and control â the will to dominate
Rotten faith, our hands forever bound
To us there is no holy ground

[Solo: A. Alvinzi]

Walk in line, just a servant of the fools
Another burden to bear
Enslaved, restrained by limiting rules
It's a daymare...
