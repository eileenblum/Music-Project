[Music: A. Jakobson, O. PÃ¥lsson, A. Bertilsson, Lyrics: J. Fornbrant]

Memories fade, all swept away
In floods of poisonous rain
In a futureless land, our time is at hand
The spoils of apocalypse ours

We are cold, we are forlorn
Usurping mankind's throne

Society set ablaze
The world all up in flames
Humanity wasting away, abandoning civilized ways
Generations decay

Brimming with hate, lamenting our fate
Living the curse of survival
Compassion erased, all laid to waste
Chaos the natural order

We are cold, we are forlorn
The bastard sons of war

Society set ablaze
The world all up in flames
Humanity wasting away, abandoning civilized ways
Generations decay

From silence and darkness they were born
To walk the earth broken and worn
Rid of empathy, not knowing peace
The misery will never cease

From radiated lands arise
Forever death walks by their side
Dreams of the future fade and die...
