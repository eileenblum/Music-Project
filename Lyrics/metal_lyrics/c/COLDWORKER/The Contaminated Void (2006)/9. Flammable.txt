[Music: A. Bertilsson, O.PÃ¥lsson, Lyrics: J. Fornbrant]

Soul on fire, death desire, spirit in flames
Violent combustion going off inside my brain

Reacting to an inside fire
Raw emotion burns
Manic urge returns

Spreading to the outside world and raging uncontrolled
Moral insurrection, compassion overthrown

Reacting to an inside fire
Raw emotion burns
Manic urge returns

The state
