[Music: A. Jakobson, O. PÃ¥lsson, Lyrics: O. PÃ¥lsson]

Social decay in me
I strive for inner peace of mind
But yield to sicker needs
Whatâs sane is left behind
My hands are used as tools
Iâm on a random psycho path
Birth-marked confiding fools
Let loose the wrath

Iâm dreading to see your existence erased
Forever chased by insanity
Aggressive measures so unpleasant to face
But death is smiling at me

Infected with a dose of lunacy
Iâm losing grip of reality
A forthcoming fear of what grows within me
Increasing absence of empathy

Inside the circle range
And life was put on hold
Her fate in hands of a mind deranged
Wait and watch as death unfolds
The fury drives me deeper
Exploiting my supremacy
I impersonate the reaper
And the dark sides of humanity

My heart is pounding
A taste of blood in my mouth
Death smiles at me
I feel alive

Demanding to see your existence erased
Forever chased by insanity
Aggressive measures so unpleasant to face
Yet death is smiling with me
