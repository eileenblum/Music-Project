[Music: A. Alvinzi, O. PÃ¥lsson, Lyrics: A. Jakobson]

She sees the darkness
Breeding inside his rotten soul
She fears the sickness
Bleeding black as fear unfolds

Blood splattered wedding dance
This heart shaped violence

Literal masquerade
A dark secret carved in the heart
Must maintain the charade
Until death will do them apart

Saw herself in white
Seduced by the power of love
Kissed the fist goodnight
The white now soiled with her blood

Can't stand the decadence
She prays for the silence

Literal masquerade
A dark secret carved in the heart
Must maintain the charade
Until death will do them apart

A victim of an evil rage
She wants to stay alive
Walking on the razorâs edge
Guarding a dead hive

Drowning in a wave of hate
Slowly erasing her life
Until nothing remains

Marching to her dreadful fate
Slowly twisting the knife
In the stinking remains

She sees the darkness
Breeding inside his rotten soul
She fears the sickness
Bleeding black as fear unfolds

Blood splattered wedding dance
This heart shaped violence

Literal masquerade
A dark secret carved in the heart
Must maintain the charade
Until death will do them apart
