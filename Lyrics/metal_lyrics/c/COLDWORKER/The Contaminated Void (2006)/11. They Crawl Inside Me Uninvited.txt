[Music: A. Alvinzi, Lyrics: A. Jakobson]

Mass indoctrination, I am enslaved
Their sanctuary is my grave
Mind configuration, to fit the mold
Warm blood traded for cold

They crawl inside me uninvited
To feed on me
They crawl inside me uninvited
Like hungry worms

No consideration, their mind is set
Sweep the waters with their net
Effective suffocation, all life is drained
They believe in purity through pain

Altered state, altered mind
They burn my eyes 'til I'm blind
Altered state of my mind
I am raped by the divine

They crawl inside me uninvited
To feed on me
They crawl inside me uninvited
Like hungry worms

Mass indoctrination, I am enslaved
Their sanctuary is my grave
Mind configuration, to fit the mold
Warm blood traded for cold

Altered state, altered mind
They burn my eyes 'til I'm blind
Altered state of my mind
I am raped by the divine
