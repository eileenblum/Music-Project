[Music: A. Alvinzi, Lyrics: O. PÃ¥lsson]

Blinded from the world outside
Restraining my moves
I have got nowhere to hide
I have nothing to prove

Barred reality, feeding hostility

Aligning with suffering, hatred reigns
Blind to the beating, dying in vain
Aligning with suffering, familiar with pain
Desirable meeting on the edge to what I sustain

Theyâre refusing to show
But I am dying to see
This is a custom-made hell
Constructed only for me

[Solo: A. Alvinzi]

Forced and compelled
Limitations exceeding
Incarnations of hell
Leaving me bleeding

[Solo: A. Alvinzi]

Shutting out all thatâs real
Emotional rape
Ungodly abuse
Is now taking shape

Soiled by their disgusting hands
Iâm scraping my skin
A plague that infects the land
The dark secret within

(Aligning with suffering) Hatred reigns
Blind to the beating, dying in vain
Aligning with suffering, familiar with pain
Desirable meeting on the edge to what I sustain
