[Music and lyrics: Anders Bertilsson]

Sit down to contemplate life
Review your past
Opening the doors
That are long since sealed shut
Psychotic dreams
And visions of undying worlds
Your memories
Your theories
Your reasoning
All blank
In this empty space all is deleted
Try to dig in the back of your head
To bring back what was not ever yours

Seeking all-knowing beings
Seeking the chosen one
Looking for the one who has seen
What the rest of the world has not

No all-knowing being
No chosen one
Nothing else than a hollow shell

Welcome to eternal vacuum
Here light, darkness, time,
life and death does not exist
Traveling through aeons of nothing
There is no I, there is no you, there is no we
There is nothing

Rid yourself of imagination
Rid yourself of memories
Prepare and await devastation
Mind destroyed with ease
Rid yourself of imagination
Rid yourself of memories
Prepare and await devastation
In the vacuum fields

Step aboard, the course is set
You will be taken into nothingness
Soulless voyage, final frontier
Hear nothing when you leave the exosphere
Senses fail, breathing fails
In the storm's eternal hail
No memories
No theories
No reasoning
All blank
In this empty space all is deleted
There is nothing left, there never was
There is nothing left, there never was

Seeking allknowing beings
Seeking the chosen one
No light, no life
No reappearing sun
Psychotic dreams and visions
They are your memories
Realize you never were
You're entering the vacuum fields
