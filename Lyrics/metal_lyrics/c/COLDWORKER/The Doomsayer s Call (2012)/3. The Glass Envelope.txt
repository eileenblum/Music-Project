[Music and lyrics: Anders Jakobson]

Inside the glass world
All crystal clear
Behind these invisible walls
There's only fear
Enveloped and exposed
For all to see
Impossible to conceal
Terminated privacy

Panic's rising
Orchestrated
Conform to mass control
A realm of chaos
With open doors
They will see through it all

Vaporous, transparent
Unveiling every secret
Defenseless behind the glass

Brave new glass world
This place is death
Slow suffocation
The last breath

Conform to mass control
They will see through it all

Lost in the glass world
Trapped in a maze
Invisible dead-ends
Self-destructing
Numb in a haze
Infinite dead-ends

Inside the glass world
All crystal clear
Behind these invisible walls
There's only fear
Enveloped and exposed
For all to see
Impossible to conceal
Terminated privacy

Vaporous, transparent
Unveiling every secret
Defenseless behind the glass

Vaporous, transparent
Our lives manipulated
Entombed in a crystal grave
