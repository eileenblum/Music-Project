[Music and lyrics: Joel Fornbrant]

Rotten minds of nuclear hate
Lust for the suffocated state
Iron fist all cries ignore
The prize of power they adore

Dominion through streaming blood
Death's aristocracy
Now nothing can hold back the flood
Just swallow this decree

Pushing on through fields afire
Corpses crushed beneath the mire
Impaled is the dissenterÂ´s head
Lined up and machine-gunned dead

Into the void of ages
Masses break under the strain
Not living, just surviving
Waiting for the nuclear rain
Drink deep the martyr's blood
His sacrifice fuels the war
The word is law
Eradicate what was before

Undying screams of mankind
Crippled and masticated
All perish under ashen skies
Industrialized lifeless

Corroded evolution
Acid saviour arise
Emerging from the rubble
Craving death denying life
Bring on the mental murder
The end of reason soon engaged
Idiots hail regression
Celebrate this new dark age

Monochrome existence

Decaying generations
Rolling into their graves
The mighty sword of Leviathan
Hovering above your head

And tyranny shall prevail
Mind control enslaves
Entities in trepidation
Execution awaits
Lifeblood coagulates
Total annihilation

Dispersed and feeble unbelievers
The chaos engine consumes
Face the slaughtering machinery
Its gears tear at your flesh

And tyranny shall prevail
Mind control enslaves
Entities in trepidation
Execution awaits
Lifeblood coagulates
Total annihilation

Into the void of ages
Masses break under the strain
Not living just surviving
Waiting for the nuclear rain
Bring on the mental murder
The end of reason soon engaged
Idiots hail regression
Celebrate this new dark age

Monochrome existence
