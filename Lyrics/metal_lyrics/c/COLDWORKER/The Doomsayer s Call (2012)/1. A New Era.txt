[Music and lyrics: Anders Bertilsson]

I arrive from a place unbeknownst
To followers of God and Satan
Domain of truth, a land forlorn
Called the bearer of the demon's horn

Hate is strong with the firm believers
Coming at me with chains and stones
Deny the writings and burn the scriptures
Fortifiers of the fraudulence

Fortifiers of the fraudulence

Commanded to hold fast
Forced to stand their ground
Darkness and light alike
To hatred all are bound

An old man, clad in rags
Spouting empty words
Mock his sermons, awake his thirst
Set fire to the tie that binds

Mind emptied, clean slate
Regaining faith in what one sees
Lifting the veil of the past
Redeeming one's own self

An old man, clad in rags
Spouting empty words
Mock his sermons, awake his thirst
Set fire to the tie that binds

A new era begins
A removal of all gods
A cleansing scours the earth
Neutralization of the soil
Kill the written words
Kill demons, kill angels
Liberate, release
Covenants dissolved
Enter into a day and age
Rid of coercive beliefs

Put an end to the fraudulence

[Lead: Anders Bertilsson]

Determined to hold fast
Set to stand our ground.
Lifting the veil of the past
Newborn freedom found
