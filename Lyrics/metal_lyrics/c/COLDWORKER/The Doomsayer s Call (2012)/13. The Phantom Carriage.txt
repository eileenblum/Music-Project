[Music: Oskar PÃ¥lsson]
[Lyrics: Anders Jakobson]

Through the mist a shape appears
A shrieking noise that causes fear
The fate that awaits us all, I must face

A presence uninvited
Shrouded by the veils of the dark
The infernal apparition
With the burning eyes
A visit from the dark side
Watching, waiting for the time to act
I fear this ghastly being
Is Death disguised

The one who waits in the end
Is the watcher in the dark

A blackened hearse waits by his side
All thatâs left is one long ride
A destiny I must abide
My end is here
He points toward the journeyâs end
Beyond a path that will descend
The destination I apprehend
My day of reckoning

Faith failed me
Now I face the end
All hopeâs gone
As Iâve been forsaken

A promise unfulfilled
Shattered by the call from beyond
Judged by the eerie gaze
From his burning eyes
I shiver in the darkness
Panting, breathing, gasping for air
A sudden revelation:
Itâs my demise

The one who waits in the end
Is the watcher in the dark

A blackened hearse waits by his side
All thatâs left is one long ride
A destiny I must abide
My end is here
He points toward the journeyâs end
Beyond a path that will descend
The destination I apprehend
My day of reckoning

I accept that my time here is over
My home is inside the darkness
Into the night the hearse will take me
I cope with fate, letâs take a ride

The Phantom Carriage
Toward the journeyâs end
The Phantom Carriage
Will carry me home
