[Music: Daniel SchrÃ¶der]
[Lyrics: Jakobson]

Cast aside, I found you
So frail and weak
I released you from your pain
I was your savior
Host to a broken soul
I saw right through you
Devoured you
And took you in

Grinning with delight
My need to dominate
Another human life
Is finally satisfied
You will serve me well
A treat for my special taste
My hunger is at ease
I love the sight of flesh

Your nightmare now begins
So brace yourself
Iâll provide unlimited pain
Yet thereâs more to come
Loyal you stand by me
Kept in a carnal leash
I own you
And rule you too

On rotten soil, where angels die
That is where you join my world of flesh
I see the beauty in open sores
Walk with me on the path to death

Among the living, youâre walking dead
To gather more guests to my world of flesh
I pull the strings, you will obey
Brick by brick we build a house of death

Shed your flesh
Pound by pound
Obey your master
My word is your fucking law
Do it right this time
No games, but mine
Look into my eyes
Now shed your fucking flesh

[Lead: Daniel SchrÃ¶der]

But everything will end
And hereâs yours
Iâll release you from my leash
Youâre worthless now
Just skeletal remains
I gnawed you clean
I drained you
Of all thatâs good

Groaning with a thirst
My need to dominate
Another human life
Is never satisfied
You have served me well
But now youâre just dead waste
My hunger never ends
A craving for more flesh
