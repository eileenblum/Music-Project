[Music: Anders Bertilsson]
[Lyrics: Joel Fornbrant]

Caught in between
Hatred and avarice
Violence unseen
Decadence infects corrupt minds
Overpopulation
Collapse is imminent
We wage the war
To weed out the sickness

Guns in our hands
Means to a complete end
A world in upheaval
Spiraling out of control
Homicide, suffering
As chaos spills to the streets
We gaze into the rift
The abyss stares back into us

The streets run red with blood
It's for the public good
The innocent succumb
Exterminate the scum
Pure madness conquers all
Human rights will fall

Sick and medicated, waiting to blow
Suffer in silence from the fucking load
Paranoid compulsive, reality subsides
Dismal thoughts of suicide
Get them out or die

Force of law
Giving in
Feeding the flames
Violent society
Law by force
The only way
Incinerates
Violent society

Paint the city with your blood
And cure the cancer within society
Turn loose the killer in yourself
Lock empathy away
Banish humanity

[Lead: Anders Bertilsson]

The streets run red with blood
It's for the public good
The innocent succumb
Exterminate the scum
Pure madness conquers all
Human rights will fall
