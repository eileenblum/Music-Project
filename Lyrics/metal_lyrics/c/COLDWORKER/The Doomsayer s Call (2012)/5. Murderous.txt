[Music and lyrics: Anders Bertilsson]

Murderous
I never stop
Jacked up a fix, a shot,
a dose - of slaying hell
Blurred eyesight
Won't stop this kill now
Shot down, got up
and did it all over again

Buried
A burial above ground
Scream levels soaring
To me the sweetest sound
Heads are rolling
Skulls crushed in one pound
Fucked up procedure of death
I kill, I murder

[Lead: Anders Bertilsson]

Punished, broken down, battered
We introduce present life to afterlife
Never-ending death, it keeps going
Body count rising, piss and puke flowing
It is the ultimate way to live

Way to live...
So on it goes
My way of ending life
Instant murder by gun or by knife

Next fix in deep
No stopping, no exiting
Ignoring fatigue
Move fast, not silent
Pure killing spree
I am no longer a man
Bodies flash by
Seeing red, seeing dead
You can't see me without your head
At last I am a god

A burial above ground
Scream levels soaring
To me the sweetest sound
Heads are rolling
Skulls crushed in one pound
Fucked up procedure of death
I kill, I murder

Murderers
We'll never stop
There's no pressing escape
Murderers
We'll never stop
Kill, crush, maim, slay
Just fucking die
