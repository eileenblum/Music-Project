[Music: Daniel SchrÃ¶der]
[Lyrics: Joel Fornbrant]

Life is full of pain
Being is despairing
Throes of degradation
Swallow you at last
Dead disharmony
Worsening disorder
Everything that's left
Is anger and hate

You suffer every waking moment

This pain survives
Twisted retribution
Grows on the inside
A life of prostitution
Afflicted years
Perseverance grudging
Narcotic tears
Addicted to the suffering

Time disintegrates
Behind the veil of solitude
Pariah you become
This tribulation is suffered alone

Lacerate your flesh
And let the pain flow
Bleed for the world
That cuts you to the bone

Nothing they can say gives you
Any consolation
Each hand upon your skin
Cold as the fucking grave

[Lead: Daniel SchrÃ¶der]

Schizophrenic state
Weaker every hour
The empathy of others
Used and cast aside
Tearing fits of rage
Shunned by all around you
Going off the edge
Finally this shit is done

You suffer every waking moment

This pain survives
Twisted retribution
Grows on the inside
A life of prostitution
Afflicted years
Perseverance grudging
Narcotic tears
Addicted to the suffering
