[Music and lyrics: Anders Jakobson]

That atrocious smell
Like a shadow in the dark
Always lurking behind me
Ever so rancid and stark
Dark thoughts cloud my mind
I can't escape my fate
Something new is awaiting
Something new is taking shape

That atrocious smell
Piercing through my skin
Poisoning my flesh and blood
Taking over from within
So this is what became of me
Just a pile of stinking meat
Overwhelmed by the notion
Overwhelmed by the noxious reek

Converging through a transformation
To be one with that atrocious smell

My flesh - Liquefying
Iâm falling apart - I'm becoming the stench
My blood - Vaporizing
Life's vicious art - I'm becoming the stench

That atrocious smell
Evidence of mental death
All hope evaporates
With every stinking breath

Prisoner of the carrion kind
The sanity is decomposed
Emotionally dying
Emotionally transposed

My flesh - Liquefying
Iâm falling apart - I'm becoming the stench
My blood - Vaporizing
Life's vicious art - I'm becoming the stench

Mental putrefaction
Horrid chain reaction
Enters every fraction
â¦ transposed

Host to something vile
Terrifying and hostile
My soul has been defiled
I decompose
