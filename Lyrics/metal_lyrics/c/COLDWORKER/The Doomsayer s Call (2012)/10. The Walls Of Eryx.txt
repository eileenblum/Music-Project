[Music: Anders Jakobson]
[Lyrics: Joel Fornbrant]

Dislocated
Clawing at the walls of the void
I will find my way
All I need is your blood
Deterioration spreads
Soon to face insanity
Release from a maniacal reality

Embrace the false
Abide by consoling lies
Within Eryxian walls
Wary I shun the medusa's eyes

Vile deception
Deficit, lack of meaning
No respite
Life of subjugation
Existence at the end of a rope
The world defied

Given to all
To ignore the eternal pain
Deaf to the doomsayer's call
All senses slip away

Obfuscated
Life outside these squalid halls
I pursue my bliss
As the serpents crawl

Vile deception
Deficit, lack of meaning
No respite
Life of subjugation
Existence at the end of a rope
The world defied

Dreaming demise
Vacuos mind
Slipping into atrophy
Petrified
Believe the lie
And peace will rise

Dreaming demise
Sever all ties
In narcoleptic apathy
I testify
Cut out my eyes
All pain denied
