[Music: A. Jakobson, Lyrics: J. Fornbrant]

Recluse of a world within
Here I can let no one in
To your eyes I am unseen
Ostracized perpetually
Silently I lie in wait
Goaded by the games you play
Any day my time will come
Retribution with a gun

Silence broken, darkness falls
Striking from the grey to ascend above you all
Terror risen, death inflicted
Deliverance of the rejected
Suicide, bridges burn
Final destination on a path of no return
Kneel and confess before you die

Morbid fantasies you said
Tried to dig inside my head
Everyday I've felt the pain
The suffering won't stay away
Fueled by nihilistic rage
I'll lay your little world to waste
A legacy you all will fear
After I am gone from here

Silence broken, darkness falls
Striking from the grey to ascend above you all
Terror risen, death inflicted
Deliverance of the rejected
Suicide, bridges burn
Final destination on a path of no return
Kneel and confess before you die

This guise
Vaporous
Reduced, pathetic image
Shapeshifter
Transforming
Becomes the unrelenting

Carnage
Become me
Consume and elevate me
Their lives
Dead, rotten
Their sick vain dreams forgotten

Their sick vain dreams forgotten
