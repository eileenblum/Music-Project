[Music: A. Bertilsson, Lyrics: A. Bertilsson]

Wasted, a lifelong service
Shackled, bound, chained, put to silence, suppressed
Their divine mix, giving a fix
Into a submissive coma you slip

Awareness rejected, denied...
...put on hold for a mind genocide
In silence the masses abide
As all rules are now set aside...

...Now you're cast in a mold
Zombified, weakened, intensely controlled
A circle of war, allegedly pure
Die in conviction of reasons obscure

Awareness rejected, denied...
...put on hold for a mind genocide
In silence the masses abide
As all rules are now set aside

[Lead: Anders Bertilsson]

Chaos - from it they feed
Terror - a craving need
The means are sickening, a holy quickening
Enter the comatose state!

Pestilent, viral, infectious lies
Receive in acceptance, be held in a vice
Wide-open sore, begging for more
Suffer the consequence of this false lore

Awareness rejected, denied...
...put on hold for a mind genocide
In silence the masses abide
As all rules are now set aside
