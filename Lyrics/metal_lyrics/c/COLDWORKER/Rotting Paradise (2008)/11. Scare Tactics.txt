[Music: O. PÃ¥lsson, Lyrics: O. PÃ¥lsson]

Running for shelter, our childhood to waste
Anxiety sweeps through the land
Teaching our kids to take cover and hide
To fear what they can't understand
Predicting the worst, we anticipate war
Showing no signs to disarm
Media is governed by those in control
Working to keep us alarmed

Scare tactics
Make us rust in peace
Ascending panic spreads like a disease
Pull the trigger
Attack is the best defence
Now we will be suffering the consequence

Delusions of grandeur, decisions are made
The arms race continues to reign
Futile resistance, our mouths will be shut
Opinions are being restrained
Facing a threat of immeasurable strength
Our future now stands insecure
We swallow our pride and run for our lives
âcause weâre not in command anymore

[Lead: Anders Bertilsson]

A childlike fascination
It's fear that fuels our lives
Truth has been distorted
Lies displayed before our eyes
Scare tactics deceive us
Injustice tips the scales
Desperation, annihilation
Humanity will fail

[Lead: Anders Bertilsson]

Scare tactics
Make us rust in peace
Ascending panic spreads like a disease
Pull the trigger
Attack is the best defense
Now we will be suffering the consequence
