[Music: A. Bertilsson, D. SchrÃ¶der, Lyrics: O. PÃ¥lsson]

Too weak to resist the opportunity
A daily struggle to remain clean
Watching all wasted possibilities
Reduced to a single human tragedy

Distort and deny
The similarities
Too late to redeem
Shame is suffocating the screams

Viewing this world, strange and absurd
Altered perception
All visions blurred, cry out unheard
Pounding aggression

Afraid to face the harsh reality
Symptom of sickness aggravates
Neglect the outcast of society
This nation is boiling with hate

Evading all
Responsibility
Adjust the lies
Blaming the hands that provide

Viewing this world, strange and absurd
Altered perception
All visions blurred, cry out unheard
Pounding aggression

Pills alleviate the pain
Cast down into hell again
Point out the necessity
Forced into recovery

Stand before an ordeal of fire
Obliged to face the undefeated
Tempting, luring
Deceived into the darkness
Craving, aching
Heading for the rush

Viewing this world, strange and absurd
Altered perception
All visions blurred, cry out unheard
Pounding aggression
