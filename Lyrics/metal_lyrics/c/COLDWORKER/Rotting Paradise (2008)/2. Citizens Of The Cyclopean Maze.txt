[Music: A. Jakobson, Lyrics: J. Fornbrant]

All is quiet here
Now that weâre used to fear
Pitch-black skyline rules
Oppressing walls enfold
Beneath we walk in line
Shadows out of time
Labour the day away
To rest in shallow graves

Citizens of the cyclopean maze
Sterile breed that grace forgot

Lay down my fate
Assimilate
On the horizon the city awaits
Relinquish the last shreds of humanity
Towers of stone
Built on my bones
Carry the weight of indifferent souls
Embraced by the chains of slavery

Artificial light
Is our only guide
Numb we play the parts
Concrete surrounds the heart
Structure mesmerize
Rotting paradise
The will begins to slip
To fight the comas grip

Sewers below awash with our blood
Black bled forth in putrid tides

Lay down my fate
Assimilate
On the horizon the city awaits
Relinquish the last shreds of humanity
Towers of stone
Built on my bones
Carry the weight of indifferent souls
Embraced by the chains of slavery

By our own hands the metropolis thrives
Deciding the fate of us all
Like rats trapped in labyrinthine decay
Our industry precedes our fall

[Lead: Anders Bertilsson]

By our own hands the metropolis thrives
Deciding the fate of us all
Like rats trapped in labyrinthine decay
Our industry precedes our fall

Lay down my fate
Assimilate
On the horizon the city awaits
Relinquish the last shreds of humanity
Towers of stone
Built on my bones
Carry the weight of indifferent souls
Embraced by the chains of slavery
