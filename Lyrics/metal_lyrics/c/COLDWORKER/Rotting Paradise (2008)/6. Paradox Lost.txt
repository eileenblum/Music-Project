[Music: A. Jakobson, Lyrics: A. Jakobson]

In the midst of my last attack
Panic drags me into the black
Weak and frail I leave myself behind
In the darkness I am reborn
Full of queries but all forlorn
This new life will destroy my mind

Passion or possession?
I can't decide
Engulfed by my life's obsession
In questions I will hide
Debating the solutions
Lost and perplexed
I'm stumbling through the confusion
Quandaries so complex

Battle in my head
I look for answers but no one's there to guide me
Battered by the dread
That all my worries will remain inside me

Drowned in desperation
Border is crossed
Heading towards obliteration
In the paradox I am lost
Sanity deteriorates
Broken and torn
Madness rapidly propagates
Waiting to unleash the storm

Battle in my head
I look for answers but no one's there to guide me
Battered by the dread
That all my worries will remain inside me

I'm lost in the paradox
Quandaries so unorthodox
Messing with my head, making me loose my mind
So lost in the paradox
Locked up inside the box
There's a battle in my head, and I'm really loosing my mind...

I'm slowly turning inside out
As I question what it's all about
The desperation feeds on me
A ravenous cancer, tearing me apart

Paroxysmal, evil death
Lost in mind, lack of breath
Paradoxical way to die
So confused, I close my eyes
