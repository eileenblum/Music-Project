[Music: A. Bertilsson, Lyrics: A. Bertilsson]

A massive wound sustained
Patience is lost
Too familiar with pain
No way to regain trust

Emerging from the filth
Rise, one by one
Seeking to destroy this world of shit

A horde of demons unleashed
Upon the streets
Relentless, hunting
Sweeping, cleansing, washing away

Emerging from the filth
Rise, one by one
Seeking to destroy this world of shit

A horde of demons unleashed
Upon the streets
Relentless, hunting
Sweeping, cleansing, washing away

Out of sight
Tucked away
Left behind
It ends this day

The scum becomes the elite
Bringers of death
No cover holds it back
A hunt for flesh
Determined hate platoon
Won't compromise
Negotiations fail
The welfare state now dies

Bringing their man-made hell
Reversed world order
Destroy and desecrate
Everything that was...

Emerging from the filth
Rise, one by one
Seeking to destroy this world of shit

A horde of demons unleashed
Upon the streets
Relentless, hunting
Sweeping, cleansing, washing away

No shelter, no cover, no hiding, nothing
Reversing the order, the nameless made kings
