[Music: A. Jakobson, Lyrics: A. Jakobson]

I am the doorway, access denied
I stand erect where the worlds collide
I am the doorway, the gate of gates
The passage where all lives meet their fate

In my shadow-kingdom
You may rise to stardom
Might seem all so random
Enter, it's your destiny
Possibilities arise
I offer you a paradise
Just a simple sacrifice
Human flesh will serve as key

I am all like the pestilence
So contagious, so immense
Vaporizing your last defence: I lure you in

A doorway, a path towards silent darkness
So pray: Your time has come
I'll force you through the Doorway
No way back, fear the darkness
More prey for my herd
Conform: I own you

Cold-blooded
Cold-blooded misery
My enjoyment
Your demise
Inhuman
Inhuman cruelty
My excitement
Your demise

In my shadow-kingdom
You may rise to stardom
Might seem all so random
Enter, it's your destiny
Possibilities arise
I offer you a paradise
Just a simple sacrifice
Human flesh will serve as key

I am the doorway, so pass through me
I offer sights you would never see
I am the doorway, now you're inside
Eternal damnation, you cannot hide

Seduced by the light
All drained of blood, you are the wicked one
Reduced to a drone, tonight
March with the living dead
Seduced by the light
Fall into line, next to the wicked ones
Abused you without a fight
You are the living dead
