I wipe the blood from my hands
Clear my mind of crimson stains
As the sun ignites the horizon
I am haunted by the ones I have slain

And they will know me by the trail of dead
The truth is hidden among the bones
And they will know me by the trail of red
I'm judged by the dead from their massive thrones

Driven far beyond what is right
It's time for me to face my sins
My anxiety tears me apart
It's a battle that evil always wins

And they will know me by the trail of dead
The truth is hidden among the bones
And they will know me by the trail of red
I'm judged by the dead from their massive thrones

They'll haunt me, harass me and make me bleed
My fear of the dark side will shape my end
They'll catch me, crush me and make me bleed
I'm drawing my last breath as darkness descends
