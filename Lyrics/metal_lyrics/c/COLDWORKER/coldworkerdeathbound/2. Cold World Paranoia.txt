A day without light
Sadness hides deep in the mind
Darkness all around
Lurking fears they spring at me

Old memories creep up
Of love and disgrace
Things sensed within a dream
Elude, self-erase

Cold world void of resonance
Living turned into pretence
High anxiety unfold
Death resides where I go

Words you whispered
Folded arms and bade farewell
Me beside, bloodied hands
As your life ran out that night

Instead of need, distrust
What once was sweet, corrupt
Nervous wreck in my prime
I will subside in time

Paranoid misguided life
Scarred by recollection's strife
Buried suffering returned
To heal these wounds I never learn

Cold world void of resonance
Living turned into pretence
High anxiety unfold
Death resides where I go
