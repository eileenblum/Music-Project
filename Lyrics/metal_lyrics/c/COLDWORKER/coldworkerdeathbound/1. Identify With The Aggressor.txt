Terrorized and traumatized, should have been scarred for life
Reborn - an empty shell, cleanse yourself through regression
Healing in the aftermath, the aggressor idolized
Assume the attributes, imitate the aggression

And this is why you identify with the aggressor:
Submission - developed into love

Memorize and recreate, trace the path, you copycat!
Can't reverberate, can't repeat the past
Failing, falling - no surprise, bubble burst, you fall flat
Naked - all can see, truth revealed at last

Weak
So weak
You're so weak
A non-emotional shadowself

You are so weak and you lack all common sense
Your fascination killed your self-defence
Uncanningly starring beyond the highest fence
A non-emotional shadowself

Subject to introjection, unconscious motivation
A mental transformation, obvious but unbeknownst to you
You cannot change your fate, you're doomed to imitate
Your life now seems to be, a tragedy

Terrorized and traumatized, should have been scarred for life
Reborn - an empty shell, cleanse yourself through regression
Healing in the aftermath, the aggressor idolized
Assume the attributes, imitate the aggression

And this is why you identify with the aggressor:
Submission - developed into love
