Smoke From barrels and rubber
Blazing from state to state
Dusty boots stompin' on the pedal
The engine is fueled by hate
Full speed, the wheels are on fire
Front lights flashing up in the night
Backseat's filled up with hookers
Riding with the Devil tonight
Raven Black Cadillac
Hell has no fury like the
Raven Black Cadillac
The Reaper's at the wheel
Raven Black Cadillac
Hell has no fury like the
Raven Black Cadillac
Nothing left to kill
You've been hunt down and captured
Now you can chug the brew
Hitch hiking girls in the night
This ride will end it for you
The hood is covered in blood stains
Roadkill's piling up in a stew
Give it up little girls
The Cadillac is coming for you, tonight
