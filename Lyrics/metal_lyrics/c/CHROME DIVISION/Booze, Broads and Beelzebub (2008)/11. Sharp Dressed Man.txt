Clean shirt, new shoes
And I don't know where I am going to.
Silk suit, black tie,
I don't need a reason why.
They come running just as fast as they can
Cause every girl crazy bout a sharp dressed man.
Gold watch, diamond ring,
I ain't missing a single thing.
And cufflinks, stick pin,
When I step out I'm gonna do you in.
They come running just as fast as they can
Cause every girl crazy bout a sharp dressed man.
Top coat, top hat,
I don't worry cause my wallets fat.
Black shades, white gloves,
Lookin sharp and lookin for love.
They come running just as fast as they can
Cause every girl grazy bout a sharp dressed man.
