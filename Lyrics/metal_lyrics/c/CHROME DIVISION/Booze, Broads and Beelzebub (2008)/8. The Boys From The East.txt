Well, everybody raise your glass
And Welcome to the show
Let there be no doubt
We got a lot to show
Turn the music up loud
So chicks can move on the floor
If you don't like it
You're at the wrong place for sure
Come a little closer
So I can feel your heat
Now let me see you shake that ass
To that rockin' beat
I hope you don't mind girl
And show me your smile
Well, I know that I'm different
But I'm gonna stay for a while
It ain't easy
Living free
It ain't easy when you're trying
To satisfy me
I'm coming down
You better be prepared
'cause I grew up on the other side of town
You heard the stories,
And you heard the tales
It's time to meet the boys
When we all get together
We sure make a lot of noise
You can either hate us or join our feast
I can't promise any champagne
When you party with
The boys from the east
