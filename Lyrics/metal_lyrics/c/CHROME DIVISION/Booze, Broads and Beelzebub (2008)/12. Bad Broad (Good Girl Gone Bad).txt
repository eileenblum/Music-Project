I opened up and gave you everything
It didn't mean much to you
You were never satisfied
I never knew what to do
Every feeling you ever gave me
Was just a fake
The only thing that you ever wanted
Was to see me break
Oh how you love to watch me crawl
Smile smile with the Devil
Shame shame on you
You ripped it out and ate it all
Smile smile with the Devil
You were never true
It never really bothered you
That you left me in pain
You kept on living hih and mighty
When I was almost insane
And after everything I've done for you
This is how you repay me?
How can you live with yourself?
How can you look at yourself in the mirror?
How can you even face the day?
Bitch!
