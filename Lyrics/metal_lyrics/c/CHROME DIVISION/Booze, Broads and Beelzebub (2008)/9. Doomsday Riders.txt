I got an open road ahead
And there's a warm breeze through my hair
Ain't got no plan of where I'm going to
But I don't really care
Hang on I'm coming fast
I like your soft hands
I'm gonna live to the maximum
'Cause this is my chance
Here I go
Teachin' Preachin'
Doomsday
Rider
Ridin'
Ain't got no place to lay my hat
Or a place that I call home
The only place I do belong
Is the highway that I'm on
I like you too, but don't get involved
'Cause tomorrow I'll be gone
I like your company
Bust mostly, I ride alone
Feel my engine
Hear it roar
Shiftin' down
Hit the floor
Doomsday rider
On parole
Straight out of hell
