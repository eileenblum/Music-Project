Another drink in the bar
Come on over
We've got something that won't
Make you sober
Flaming shots on a line
Come on over
We've got something that won't
Make you sober
Booze, broads and Beelzebub
Take it all it will do you good
Come on over, we've got it all for you
Long Legs and longer hair
Come on over
These ladies know how to do you over
You want it oh so bad
Come on over
These ladies know how to do you over
Fists high in the air
Come on over
Live your life like a Rock 'n' Roll rebel
Tattoos of skulls and bones
Come on over
Live your life like a Rock 'n' Roll rebel
