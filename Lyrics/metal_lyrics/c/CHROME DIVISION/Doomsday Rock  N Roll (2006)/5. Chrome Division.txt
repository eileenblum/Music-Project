We are the ones who make you feel uneasy
We are the ones who turn your wrong to right
We are the ones who make you feel uneasy
We are the ones who just arrived tonight.

See us as we go
Feel us as we come
Know us by our name
Don't turn away in shame
Know this by our sound
Desire slowly awakes
Give us what it takes and here we go again

We are the ones who make you feel uneasy
We are the ones who turn your wrong to right
We are the ones who make you feel uneasy
We are the ones who just arrived tonight.

Come see us Come hear us
We are the Chrome Division
Come see us Come hear us
We are the Chrome Division

You can never change what you feel inside
Your right just turn wrong
It's time to let it go
So long to it all
Doomsday has arrived
Which you knew so well from your deepest
darkest place

You want more? You want more?
Well........

You hear us You see us
We are the Chrome Division
