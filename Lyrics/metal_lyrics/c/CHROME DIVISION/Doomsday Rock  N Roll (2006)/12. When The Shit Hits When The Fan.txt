No more shit, she's finally on her way
Well, she sees no point for her to stay
She stole your car well she's on a roll
And she can't be stopped she's out of control

Know her broken
When the shit hits the fan
Know her broken
Another young girl just skipped town

Filled with hunger with the thrills of life
No more waiting home sweet and nice
She's on her way to the big bad city
With a painted face she sure looks pretty

Know her broken
When the shit hits the fan
Know her broken
Another young girl just skipped town

One, two!

Sick and tired of your lies
No more lonely nights

You should feel bad or can't you see
When she reach the city she will meet me
And I will make her feel so good
Cosy, warm and understood

Know her broken
When the shit hits the fan
Know her broken
Another young girl just skipped town

Now piss off!!!
