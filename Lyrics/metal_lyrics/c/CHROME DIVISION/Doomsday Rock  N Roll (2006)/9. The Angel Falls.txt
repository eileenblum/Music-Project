She's been walking through fire
Well she's seen it all
I knew her long before she even got her call
She used to take me higher
I used to bring her down
Happiness was never too far away
whenever she was around

She's running dry on her goodlook charm
Scared face and tattooed arms
She's been travelling from west to east,
also known as another man's feast
She used to take me higher,
now she's bringing me down
Misery ain't too far away,
whenever she's around

The Angel falls and no one calls
No more lies, no more lies
No more lies tonight, alright
The Angel falls and no one calls
No more lies, no more lies
No more lies!
She's been walking through fire
She's been walking through fire

She's waking up to see what she's got
Can't argue she knows she's a slut
She has a hard time to face the sun
Without a pill or a hand on her gun
She used to take me higher, now it's all gone
She used to fill my heart with desire
No longer feel that strong

The Angel falls and no one calls
No more lies, no more lies
No more lies tonight, alright
The Angel falls and no one calls
No more lies, no more lies
No more lies!
