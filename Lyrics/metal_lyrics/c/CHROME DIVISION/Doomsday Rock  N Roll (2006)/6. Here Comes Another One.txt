''Here Comes Another One''

Everybody let's board this flight
We're gonna rip this shit old town tonight
No more for the wishing well, we're gonna
put 'em all down and send them all to hell
No more talking, well it's time to go
No more walking, let's get it on
Let's hear it all from the other side
Ain't no place in here where you can hide

Pride taken, skull's breaking
I'll hurt you that's for sure
You want it, I need it
Here comes another one
Pride taken, skull's breaking
I hurt you even more
You want it, I need it
Here comes another one

 put 'em up, look me in the eye
Well, I ain't shame to shed a tear
Tonight is your lucky shot
Well, everyone must face their fear
Hit hard, first from the left side
Hit hard, then from the right side
Don't you know it's the ultimate test
Here comes another kick in the chest

Pride taken, skull's breaking
I'll hurt you that's for sure
You want it, I need it
Here comes another one
Pride taken, skull's breaking
I hurt you even more
You want it, I need it
Here comes another one
