It's been a long winter
And finally the evenings are
getting longer and warmer
I guess most of you guys are just like me
You had your share this winter
But something happens
every year at this time....
You want more

And another spring just broken,
here we go again
Short skirts frequently appearing,
I think you know what I mean
Don't worry about a thing,
let's see what it brings
So bite the night, demand your right,
we know you understand

All my life I tried to be a good man
All my life I tried to do good
All my life I tried to be a good man
Oh my god how I misunderstood
Don't you stop, take it all off
I don't mind show me what you've got
More!

And another bottle's opened,
and we 're on our way
You hesitate just for a moment,
you know you wanna stay
Zip it down take it off,
slowly don't go too fast,
I like to watch, I like to taste,
I wanna make this last

Good to see you again
Where you've been for so long
Now take it all off
Let's get it on
And show me everything you've got
I ain't gonna call you no slut
'Cause I know what you wanna be
Won't you go ahead and satisfy me

All my life I wanna do this
-All my life I wanna do this
All my life I wanna do this
-All my life I wanna do this
Don't you stop, now take it all off
-I won't stop, I'll take it all off
I don't mind, show me what you got
-I don't mind, I'll show you what I've got
