Here it comes and I look at you,
and I know we're gonna see it through
And I know what you want inside
it ain't no reason to lie
Everything's gonna be alright
'cause you know I'm gonna spend the night
Too close and I bring it on,
you know what we're gonna do

Till the break of dawn

Another place and another time
where the night just ain't that long
Get close, get hot, don't stop,
'cause we both know this ain't wrong
You feel me here and I feel you there
and I can tell you need it for sure
Eyes closed, mouth wide open,
I know you've done it before

Till the break of dawn

Here it comes and I look at you,
and I know we're gonna see it through
And I know what you want inside
it ain't no reason to lie
Everything's gonna be alright
'cause you know I'm gonna spend the night
Too close and I bring it on,
you know what we're gonna do

Till hate break of dawn
