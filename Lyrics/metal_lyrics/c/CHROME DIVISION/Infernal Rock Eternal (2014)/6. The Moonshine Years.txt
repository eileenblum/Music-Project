Your mother fed your mouth by walking the streets
She went out day and night, it was hell on high heels

A distant memory fading evermore each day
One rarely wants to deal with scars that never heal

Hush little baby sleep now, just close your eyes
Don't mind the noise outside, you're just wasting your tears

Do you remember the moonshine years?
Do you remember going insane?

Through all those wasted times looking through the walls
Far from the others, in the chaos, in the dark
In the chaos, in the dark

So many years have passed now
Where do we go from here?
The moonshine years

Chaos, in the dark
Far from the others
The moonshine years
