She's like a stepping stone
She never leaves home
She tried to waste her life
Oh baby come on home tonight
I got your drinks and money waiting for you here
Just bring your feet to the door and I swear

She rattles my old bones
I'm losing all control
Tonight we're gonna let loose on the dance floor
Let's rock the night away, ready for some more

I will free you from evil, find all the things you have lost
Don't believe it's all over, I'm alive 'cause of you
I will hold you forever, never will I let you go
Take these hands that are reaching, I'm alive 'cause of you

You better quit while you're ahead
No good to me when you're dead
I got your money honey if you want some more
All you have to do is walk on through the door
