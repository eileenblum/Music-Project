Hesitation as I walk through the door
Will she look as beautiful as before

she's become a lady of perpetual sorrow
and as a son I cannot fathom anymore
My kin, my blood, so cold on the floor
to say goodbye now means forever more

lady of perpetual sorrow
I have hope to see your hair again

with your stories in my mind
I could dream all through the night
but when a story is of you
I look death right in the eyes

a never-ending state of mind
not willing to cross the line
to nevermore come home again
I'm resting here hoping to feel fine
