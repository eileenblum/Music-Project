Hell yeah!!
We're our fathers sons
We're gonna take a ride
Wasted we know
But that don't mean
We can't go on
Through the night

Hell yeah!!
We're our fathers sons
We're gonna take a ride
Wasted we know
But that don't mean
We can't go on
Through the night

I guess we'll see you on the other side
Live to ride, born free
Get ready for the endless nights
Doomsday, on my way
I guess we'll see you on the other side
Live to ride, born free

I get up, I reload, I'm alive
Do not believe that I'm gonna hide
Saddle up, crack the mut, clean your boots
Don't be a fool, never leave your pride

Gather up, cross the line
Step aside, we are here to make you choose a side
Fill her up, take them down
Leave no one
Are you alive just because you breath
