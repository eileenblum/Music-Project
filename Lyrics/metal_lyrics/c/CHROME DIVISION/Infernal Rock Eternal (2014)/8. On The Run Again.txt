I'm a backpacking man, met my girl on the go
She stood alongside the road one goes
I put a smile on my face and said: "Let's ride!"
Why don't you come? I'm a man with a dream

Do you know my name?

My mama said: "Don't you leave me alone"
She can't even go to the can on her own
Doing alright in my head by myself
Thanks for your time, I think I better go on

Do you know my name?

Oh!
On the road again
That's where I belong

Oh!
On the run again
Gotta go with the flow

Now back in the days raising hell on my street
The neighborhood screaming: "You gotta go!"
Now I am free breaking all kindsa laws
I'm coming home as a brand new man

You and me on the road again
Seems to be our destiny
You and me on the run again
We're holding on
