We are the children
Of the absinthe voyage
To call us crazy
Would be an understatement
They segregate us
And pray we never speak

We are the children
Of the absinthe voyage
When right is wrong
And our presence
Gives you shivers
Then lock your doors
'Cause we are here to stay

Tensions in the air
People everywhere
Nights are getting cold now
We used to hide down by the like
We swore and took an oath
Never to grow old

They wanted us to praise the holy lord
Not even in your dreams
Keep your righteous ways
Don't push it onto us
We're never gonna fold

Do you ever feel like you wanna go
Somewhere new where paths unfold
If you feel you can't achieve your goal
Break on through
No matter what you do
