Wet 'n wild on the road again
Licking up the pieces of the past
Homeward bound, always on the run
The law is hot on our trail

Cleaning up and leaving no trace
Yeah! Going off the deepest end
Yeah! Car full of cash, and a lot of trash
Yeah! Here we come for you

Crashin' in through the front door
With my beast machine
Up against the wall, damn you all!
You want a piece of me?

Get ready 'cause the Reaper's on the hunt again
On the hunt again!
Get ready 'cause the Reaper's on the hunt for you!

Get ready 'cause the Reaper's on the hunt again
On the hunt again!
Get ready 'cause the Reaper's on the hunt for you!
