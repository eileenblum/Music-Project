Feel my cold, cold hands against your warm skin
See my dark dead eyes penetrate your mind

You better run and hide
My demons by my side
And don't you look at me
You'll never want to see

You're dead now
You're dead now

Feast your eyes upon the eternal flame
Write your name on the wall of shame

You better worship me
I'm your deity
Are you losing your mind?
Well, it belongs to me

You're dead now
You're dead now

How do you feel now that you are dead?
Waking up is not the same as it used to be
You can't touch them no more
Welcome to your final destination

I see where you're coming from my friend
You're better off just roaming through my land
Yesterday you were holding on
Today you should be glad that you're not down here alone

How do you feel now that you are dead?
Waking up is not the same as it used to be
You can't touch them no more
Welcome to your final destination

You're dead
You're dead
You're dead
