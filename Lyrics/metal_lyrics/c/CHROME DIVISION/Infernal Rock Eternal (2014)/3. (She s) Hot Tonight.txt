Yeah! She's so hot tonight
Ooooh! She's got nothin' to lose
She's got somethin' I need
Hey baby...
My tank is full, just jump on board
Wind in your hair

You know I was made for you
And you were always there for me to find
I've never seen such a love machine
You're something else

Hey baby won't you come on down
I got a lot on my mind
It's cruisin' time
My Chevy's hot'n ready for you
Let's pop the roof!

I saw you in a dream I had
You had your laces out and the moves in
Baby looking fine, sippin' wine
Turn the town upside down

Late at night when I think of you
I get a chill inside, and it feels so good
I wanna take you out, rock the night
Till the break of day

Show me how you move your legs
I got a craving now and damn
You turn me on!
I wanna see you smile, feel your touch
Come make my day
