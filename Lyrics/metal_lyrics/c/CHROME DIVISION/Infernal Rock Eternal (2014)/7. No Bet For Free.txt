Put your money on the betting table, we're wasting time no more
Don't you think you can come to Vegas and slowly slip out the door
They've got time to bleed you, when you're in the hole
They are watching you from the bunkers down below

What's it gonna be?
No bet for free!

A dice down the table, a card from the deck
Rolling the sevens and drawing the dead
A drink from the bar on the tab, all in on black, enter red

What's it gonna be?
No bet for free!

Do you want to die? Or do you want to comply?
So what' it gonna be? They told you, no bet for free

Chicks in the sidewalk
Sin City
Beware of the dealer
Sin City

Everybody wants to get laid
Once you work in Vegas
You want to get paid

What's it gonna be?
No bet for free!
What's it gonna be?
No bet for free!
