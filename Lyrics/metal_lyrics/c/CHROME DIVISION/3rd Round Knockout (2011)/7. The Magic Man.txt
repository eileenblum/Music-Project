I was strung out and still high from last night I started to fall
The never ending hell was upon me, and man did I give a damn
I said I choose to live now, cos who knows whatâs to come
But I guess I never knew what hit meâ¦
Till I woke up on the ground
(Yeah that was something. Letâs do that againâ¦)
The third day in a row was coming to an end. And so was I
Watching old tapes from a distant time. Just feelinâ fine
I had a feeling I would live forevermore
But just next to me they had gone to sleep and left me hanging out to dry
I never thought that life could hurt me, there I was the magic man
THE MAGIC MAN
Left me up and carry me, I cannot feel my legs anymore
THE MAGIC MAN
Purgatory here I come, just meet me at the gates of HELL
Good times they will come and go, just allow them to be real
I could show you all the things I did, but you wouldnât wanna see
Donât take it out on me. Livinâ ainât for free
Iâm coming home tonight
So this is the story of my life? What a fool a man can be
I got a pat on my back and they told me: you better behave
I did not know then, but I sure know now
I will never forget the day when the Devil shook my hand
