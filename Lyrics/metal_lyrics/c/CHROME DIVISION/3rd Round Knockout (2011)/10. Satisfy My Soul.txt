18 on my hands so hit me with one more 
I'll turn the card, it's even better than before 
Four wheels rolling, snake eyes on the dice 
I'll take a chance if it'll cover up my loss 

There is something worth living for 
It ain't no worth the ride 
Just bring it all to me and turn off the lights 

Satisfy my soul 
Satisfy it with alcohol 
Satisfy my soul 
I'm all dressed up and ready to roll 

Satisfy my soul 
Satisfy it with alcohol 
Satisfy my soul 
I'm all dressed up and ready to roll 

yeah! 

Make it a double I know how to keep myself 
Need another round I don't care about my health 
My good friend Jack will lead me to the sound 
In the bottom of the bottle the answer is found

There is something worth living for 
It ain't no worth the ride 
Just bring it all to me and turn off the lights 

Satisfy my soul 
Satisfy it with alcohol 
Satisfy my soul 
I'm all dressed up and ready to roll 

Satisfy my soul 
Satisfy it with alcohol 
Satisfy my soul 
I'm all dressed up and ready to roll
