Iâll give you one more shot of my love, then Iâm out of here
Cruisinâ down the road myself, man I have no fear
Pickinâ up a girl walkinâ down the street
Gimme just a minute and youâll feel the heat
Drop what you do and grab my thing
Give it all you got and make it swing
Iâm not satisfied with just hugginâ and kissinâ
Go for it girl, you donât know what youâre missinâ
Thereâs no lie and Iâll tell you whyâ¦
UNHOLY ROLLER THATâS I AM!
 â Drunk driver, drunk driver!
â Hell raiser, hell raiser!
â Cunt hunter, cunt hunter!
Raisin hell, you can find me in a bar or in the jail
Iâll dive in the whiskey-river, when I got time to spare
Iâll knock the bottle in your face, if you donât stop that stare
The jukebox is playinâ MotÃ¶rhead
I love it and you donâtâ¦ SHOVE IT!
