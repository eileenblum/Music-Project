Zombies walk the earth,
So hungry for flesh
Got brains to eat, ghouls to birth
Bats are flying in the night,
Smelling human blood
Fangs are piercing in a BITE YEAH! YEAH! YEAH!
The moon is lighting up the sky
Driving people MAD
Beastsâra moving in the fog
The ground is shaking, tombstones are breaking
The graves open up, through caskets they come
ZOMBIES!
- Slay them down, slay them down!
A bullet to the head, theyâre as good as DEAD
MONSTERS!
- Slay them down, slay them down!
Till them full of lead, theyâre as good as DEAD
Thereâs movement in the shadowsâ¦ Is he really dead???.....
Heâs been killed three times nowâ¦ but can you kill undead???
Heâs coming soon with 1 chainsaw, looking MEAN AS HELL
Thereâs only one thing to doâ¦
TO FUCKING KILL THE ZOMBIES!
- slay them down, slay them down in the night!
