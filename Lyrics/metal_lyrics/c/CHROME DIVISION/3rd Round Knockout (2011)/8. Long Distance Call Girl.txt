When Iâm with you there is nothing else
Girl you are so fine
Morning comes I wake up alone
Itâs you I wanna feel
DAMN YOU for the spell
DAMN YOU for your smile
I blame you for everything
Do you wanna come, do you wanna ride?
Ready or not here we go!
When I saw you, waiting in the line, I knew I had to try
The concert came and the concert went,
And you were on my mind
DAMN YOU for the call
DAMN YOU for the kiss
You keep me up at night
Did you have to go, did you have to charge
Lovinâ you was alright
LONG DISTANT CALL GIRL â
The woman was madness from the start
LONG DISTANT CALL GIRL â
Iâll never forget those brown eyes
LONG DISTANT CALL GIRL â
You rocked the hell out of the boys
LONG DISTANT CALL GIRL â
You drove me all insane
I will be waiting for you, you take your time
I miss your dirty talkinâ in my ear
You had me going good, my one and only girl
Remember when I told I would like to take you home?
You laughed at my face and said: âWhy me?â
Call me when youâre done
