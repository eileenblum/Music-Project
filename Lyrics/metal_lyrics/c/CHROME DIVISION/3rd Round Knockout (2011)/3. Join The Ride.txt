Raise your glass up higher
Weâre the boys who ride with fire
Come on
Raise your glass up higher
Come on
Join the ride if you got desire
Come on
Join the ride with the right desire
Raise your glass up higher

Me and my boys were walking down the street, like we always do
Checking the heat, scoping the sidewalk for some meat
I see this girl I wanna take home
She looks at me with the weirdest look
She fights her inner lust and tries to fool herself
I tell her everything is gonna be alright,
And sweep her off her feet and run into the night

Waiting in a line is not for guys like us
Weâre used to take the backdoor in
Escorted to our seats at a table of our choice
We even have our own latrine

This little girl comes over to me and says she wants to live her life
I say now what can I do? I cannot follow you through
You have to figure this one out
Maybe if you stop trekking the streets
Youâll see a different door wide open
So lay down your gun and dry your treats from your face
Come sit with the boys, youâll never wanna leave
