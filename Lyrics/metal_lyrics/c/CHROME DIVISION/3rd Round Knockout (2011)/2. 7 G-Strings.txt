IÂ´m the DevilÂ´s jack coming for the attack
I know IÂ´m more than ready
You seem so clean, just as long as youÂ´re mean
I know you want me baby

Sweet, Tight, Hot
Give it to me

IÂ´m going down in a blaze of skin and bones
Forever sworn to satisfy your mind
Leave your panties on the floor
The 7-G String will be my legacy

Walk out the door, high heels on the floor
I think you got what you came for
WontÂ´ play your game, you just come for the fame
But sure I like you honey

Sweet, Tight, Hot
Give it to me

IÂ´m going down in a blaze of skin and bones
Forever sworn to satisfy your mind
Leave your panties on the floor
The 7-G String will be my legacy

Night after night, a different town, a different girl
They canÂ´t all be mine
There lies no sympathy in me, only memories remain

I know you want me baby, before the night is over
I would never leave you unsatisfied
Never leave you - Never bleed you
Always going all night long
