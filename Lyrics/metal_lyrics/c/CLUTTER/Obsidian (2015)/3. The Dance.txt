Come on, come on now,
Let out your suicidal intent
Frozen and Lethargic
Show us the hero you are

Underestimate the foe and the chosen one
The darkest music calling me home,

and yet they're reclaiming the throne

This is an invitation
Cast the spell and erase yourself
"Come dance and see"

"Come dance and see" - they said
Oh god why have Thou forsaken me?

To let everything die with me, (for a glance)

To let everything die with me, for a glance
And in a dance weâre laid low
Ask our hope for a last chance
They said go. And that means: No!
To let everything die with me for a glance
And in dance we're laid low
Canât deny one last dance
I said go, and that means: NO!

I can see clearly that there is nothing
to see, I can reach easily
what never existed

Wounded, displaced, rotting, bleeding, dead,
Keep rotting, locked alive, canât die, bleeding more and more

Wounded, displaced, rotting, bleeding, dead,
Keep rotting, locked alive, canât die, bleeding more and more

To let everything die with me

(Die with me)
And in a dance weâre laid low
Ask our hope for a last chance
They said go. And that means: No!

To let everything die with me
And in a dance weâre laid low

Canât deny one last dance
I said go, and that means: NO!
