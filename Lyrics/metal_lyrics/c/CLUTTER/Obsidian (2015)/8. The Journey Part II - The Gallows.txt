I'm hanging on the gallows!
As her face turns pale
The world shifts and splits

into multiple dimensions

Lifting up the soul,
tearing it all down to the ground
to uncover the regrettable way to their hidden truth

Transcend
Believe
Undress the skin of mortality

One step forward
Towards the end of it all
Recover
Past disorder
Relive it forever or
Die for your love

Just turn the pages

until there's neither a man or a lie
I've seen all the possible outcomes

and in all of them you die

Die for your love
before the end of it all
Recover
Past disorder
Relive it forever keep
Moving forward

Hunting the voice inside your head
It's hard to perceive its purpose
Grow higher, touch the knowledge that pours,
comprehend and obliterate

Olha em teu redor e verÃ¡s que sim,
eu sou o estranho que habita em ti
Procuras a verdade mas estamos no princÃ­pio do fim,
se te esqueceste eu tenho a soluÃ§Ã£o pâra ti.

(Look around yourself and you'll see,
I am the stranger that lives in you
You're searching for the truth in the beginning of the end
If you've forgotten, I've got the solution for you)

Olha em teu redor e verÃ¡s que sim,
eu sou o estranho que habita em ti,
procuras a verdade mas estamos no princÃ­pio do fim
Mas eu tenho a soluÃ§Ã£o pâra ti.

(Look around yourself and you'll see,
I am the stranger that lives in you,
You're searching for the truth in the beginning of the end
But I've got the solution for you)

One step forward
Towards the end of it all
Recover

One step forward
Towards the end of it all
Recover
Past disorder
Relive it forever or
Die for your love

Transcend
Believe
Undress the skin of mortality

Fall asleep
Die to live

Die to live
