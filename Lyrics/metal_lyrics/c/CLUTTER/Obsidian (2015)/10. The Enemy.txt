The mists unveil
revealing the shores of a fictional life
I once thought ours

(Concealing my demons)
Now I rewind the tape to complete the cycle,

(complete the cycle)
and burn us all down to the ground

Oh, I'll take you down
I now share your taste for bitter ends
but this time I'll prevail

I'll take you down

With eyes closed, a witness in the scene
where you've become the enemy
Will the anger be
enough to set us free?
A world of pain has grown us two
and so I put my trust in you
Now it weights on me
That I'll never be

Coming in colors,
in peace like a sea of crimson roses
An ocean of lies
soon my revenge will be quietly revealed,
peacefully, mercilessly

I can taste it as I tear the seams of reality itself
You couldn't know that I would know,

I'm coming for you
The earth around me flowers red

as the light returns
You couldn't know that I would go this far without you

With eyes closed, a witness in the scene
where you've become the enemy
Will the anger be
enough to set us free?

A world of pain has grown us two
and so I put my trust in you
Now it weights on me
That I'll never be

Tricked by your fucking schemes again

NO!

The sun returns slowly
to where it has never been
enlightening my way out
into your nightmare

Oh

I'll take you down!

(I'll take you down)

I'll take you down!

I'll fucking take the life out of you!

I'll take you down!
