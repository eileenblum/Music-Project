Open a perfect tomb
Digging an exit wound
Open a perfect tomb

I am a raging sea
The calm before

(Before the flood )
This void within me
Can break through and shatter the world

Settling our uneven score
casting out the illusion
that's been leading me astray
Cut my skin, open a door
To out of this shit hole
Just you wait and see, whatâs coming to you

Open a perfect tomb
Digging an exit wound

Open a perfect tomb

Tearing down these walls of yours
That you have built upon lies

(Lies)
Iâll wash away
Ready for the war
Craving your demise
My anger will shatter the world

Wound
My wound
I hear the call, a voice like Iâve never heard before (wound)
Tear the flesh out, Iâll find my destiny (my wound)

I hear the call, a voice like Iâve never heard before (wound)
Tear the flesh out, I am your destiny

My wound, your tomb

(tear the flesh out now)

Don't move
Don't breath
I'm the calm before the flood

I am the raging sea

Travelling out these tainted shores
I am a part of your world no more
(I am the raging sea)

One step forward
All recovered

All just lies
Lashed by fear of going where there's no return
What's left of myself
Weights on your hand,
So like a grain of sand

(before the end of it all)
(before the end of it all)
(before the end of it all)
(before the end of it all)
(before the end of it all)
(before the end of it all)
