Denying all the details
of an enormous adventure,
You and I

(I keep asking myself why)
We are leaves, lying on the ground
A broken heart spread all over the fabric
that covers your face
Hiding the scares of your disgrace

(hide)

(Never stop bleeding)

I can see now and I finally realize that the world will
never stop bleeding, never stop bleeding
And the truth is in the mirror,

they know that there can be no hero,
and I'll never stop bleeding

Images reflecting, watery skies
All buildings erected upon a sea of lies
No one felt the pain the way I did
Nothing was the way you made believe
There was no truth

(There was no truth)
That was never you

I can see now and I finally realize that the world will
never stop bleeding, never stop bleeding
And the truth is in the mirror,

they know that there can be no hero,
and I'll never stop bleeding

Come see it
and find us
Come see us

I can see now and I finally realize that the world will
never stop bleeding, never stop bleeding

I can see now and I finally realize that the world will
never stop bleeding, never stop bleeding
And the truth is in the mirror,

they know that there can be no hero,
and I'll never stop bleeding

I can see now and I finally realize that the world will
never stop bleeding, never stop bleeding

there can be no hero,

there can be no hero,
and I'll never stop bleeding
