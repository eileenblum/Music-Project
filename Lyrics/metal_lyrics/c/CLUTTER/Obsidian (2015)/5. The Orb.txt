Cold dreams
Disturbed by the warmth of light
Awaken the stone in sweet temptation
A cosmic invite to deny
A stone's complete annihilation
Hope

I withhold the air, I can no longer wait
Now that I know that I'm not insane
for in my pain,
I was given a sign
So bright a light
it has to be mine
(and it's otherworldly glow)
It could carry me
through a life time
of anger and gloom

Oh
Itâs calling and taking me home

(how?)
How could we be dying alone

(now?)

Itâs calling and taking me home, how?

How could we be dying alone, now?

The sight of this broken body
is killing me

The Sun has enough
strength to pry this door open

(Open)
The sight of this broken body
is killing me

(Killing me)

You came in bitter sweet regret to tell me that you cannot stay
I'm just an amusement for you
The flame you brought upon my soul was a passion short lived
And so I fell for you

Hope's just a word to make believe
This world is obscene,
A call to insanity
Love makes it all go hand in hand
with defeat,
And it will take you down

I took the blame and all was taken away from me

Taken away from me
We're not the same and all was taken away from me

I took the blame and all was taken away from me

Taken away from me
We're not the same and all was taken away

Taken away from me
