Now that you are gone

(Now that you are gone )
I know I'm ready to,
to leave all behind

(to leave all behind now, fuck!)

The sun is set
and you're not coming back for us
I'm leaving all behind,
another second spent

in senseless confusion

Fall asleep
Can you see? That this is the moment

I feel like I could fly
fly away from here
Let us make the journey
Please take me nowhere near
I wish that I could see
what's real in this world
Am I the only one living
in my empty home.

Come find yourself and face reality
(always and never)
I felt this energy, in perfect symmetry
In perfect symmetry, time has lost its meaning to me

I walk and walk
in an endless circle
Because I fucking hated that dramatic ending
I fucking hate you, why did you leave me you piece of shit??

There's not a road to follow
but a distant mirror and I remember my face
I wave my hand and make the world flourish
a naked woman in a sea of red
Freedom and solitude
A nourishment too bittersweet for my taste
But I don't recall its flavor, so what do I know?

I walk this world alone
with a body made of stone
Life almost feels once more
like something worth fighting for
I'm back to the front
against the enemy
I grow weary of this hunt
for a fantasy inside a fantasy
