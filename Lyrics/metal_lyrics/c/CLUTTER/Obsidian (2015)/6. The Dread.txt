Burn, burn, burn
The entire world has burn down,
a thousand times.
and rid my heart of your disguise.
Turn, turn, turn
Turn up the volume of the anger
Oh yeah, a thousand times.

I can't believe the scars so deep, a broken heart,
a war that comes to be true
So tired we are
I can't believe the scars so deep, a broken heart,
a war that comes to be true
Unending light

I close my eyes

Rain down on me
Another endless life, flash before my eyes
Burn tilâ we're free
Hunting once again, and so we pretend to be

Burn, burn, burn

I can't believe the scars so deep, a broken heart,
a war that comes to be true

(a war that comes to be true)

Burn, burn, burn

I can't believe the scars so deep, a broken heart,
a war that comes to be true )

(a war that comes to be true)

Travelling through endless dreams,
I promise
I'll search for a reason to all this

(All this)
Revenge surely will be met
Sooner or later

(sooner or later)
you'll be dead
Sooner or later
you will be dead
Sooner or later
you will be dead

Rain down on me
Another endless life, flash before my eyes
Burn until we're free
Hunting once again, and so we pretend to be

I close my eyes
Fall asleep

Burn, burn, burn
Burn it down to the ground

Burn, burn, burn
Burn it down to the ground
Burn, burn, burn
Burn it down to the ground
Burn, burn, burn
Burn it down to the ground
Burn, burn, burn
Burn, burn, burn
Burn, burn
