One step forward (before the end of it all)
All Recover

(Darkness)

Darkness embrace
Darkness unfolds
Unraveling a world of betrayal
In the form of a void
Consuming the notion of reality
(Consuming the life of the innocent)

What is this place?
what keeps me standing on my feet?
I beg for numbness to ease the weight
That leashes me to this deceit
The ages could be passing
There's no sun to light my days
So this is what they do
To let their guilt die with you

All just lies
Lashed by fear of going where there's no return

(Where thereâs no return)
What's left of myself

(Of myself)
Weights on your hand so like a grain of sand

Waiting

I will be waiting

Waiting

I will be waiting for you to come

For you to come and

save me from this dream
Wake me up, take me out, lead me and
love me the way you used to do
I'm tied up, I'm stuck in my own consciousness,
Hope's a mystery,
If a life can be brought down so easily
I don't wanna know what I am

(Face)

'Though you cannot see the way

(My demons)

Beyond the prison I remain
