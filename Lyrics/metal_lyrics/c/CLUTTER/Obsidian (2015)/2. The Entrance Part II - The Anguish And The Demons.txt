Anguish has its way to turn into demons
And their faces look so friendly
All of them smile
As they carry their knives
They congratulate me and stab me a thousand times

'Though you cannot see the way
Life is just ahead
Beyond the prison I remain
Locked from my own death

'Though you cannot see the way
Life is just ahead
Beyond the prison I remain
Locked from my own death

All just lies
Lashed by fear of going where there's no return
What's left of myself
Weights on your hand, so like a grain of sand
