I see a bright Light piercing through my Eyelids
Trying to get a peek I open them briefly
As my distorted Vision slowly starts to fade
Two Suns â ever blinding

Overstimulation of Senses

I feel the scorching Atmosphere flowing through my Lungs
A constant Fear of collapsing
Rags of Skin - burned and black
Dangling from my Body and
The Simoom lashing my diluted Wounds

Overstimulation of Senses

I hear the thunderous Sound approaching
Pure tone deafening - ear drums bursting
With my Hands against my Head covering my Ears
Blood is dripping down my Neck

I taste the carbon black Particals accumulating on my Tongue
This Stench of Sulfur - sickening me
Gastric Acid spilling through my Teeth

Overstimulation of Senses
