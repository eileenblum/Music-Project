The everlasting Black initiates the Restoration
Something is dying inside
Cleansing of Minds - Purification of Souls

Nameless Deity - speak to me
Guide me - for you are the Blackness
Save me from the Light
Show me the Way to the Sky
And let the red Sun shine through me
Let me enter you Realm through Death

"Cast the circle around you
Become free of your Vices
Find Rest inside yourself
Float towards the Core of Life
Implode - burst into Nothingness
Implode - burst into Nothingness "

I am becoming one with the Earth and Waters and Fire
I am dying to be born again and again
