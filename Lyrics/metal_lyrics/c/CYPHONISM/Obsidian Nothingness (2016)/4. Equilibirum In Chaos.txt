A Place that is tearing itself apart
Through Fear and Terror
Where we rise and watch it burn

A Cleansing through Fire
A mass panic to destroy
A mass murder to re-calibrate

In Havoc is where we find the Balance
When everything is dying and falling from the Earth

Our own Mother â devouring the Child that should not be

Mankind is doomed to Failure
And we will cease to exist

Memento Mori â Collecting the Remembrance of the Deceased
Preparing for

A Cleansing through Fire
A mass panic to destroy
A mass murder to re-calibrate
There are no Angels within
Chaos in the Heart of Men
A Lust for Killing
Grown from the Need to survive
All Wisdom has died
All Morality has fallen
There is a Devil within
There is a Devil within us

Mankind is doomed to Failure
And we will cease to exist
