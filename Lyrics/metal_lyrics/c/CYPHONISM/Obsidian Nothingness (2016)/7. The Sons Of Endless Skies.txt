We are the Sons of the endless Skies
We are the Spawn of Conceit
We are the age old Vision of Immortality

Seven billion Lives created
Cast into the seven Seas
Left to drown, die and rot

"Carry this Burden
Mortality shall be your Curse"
"Carry this Burden
Mortality shall be your Curse"

âOne by one - for Centuries I have created
What should have been my unblemished self
I can't stand this imperfect Image
A sickening Likeness cut from my own Flesh
Cut from my own Flesh"

We are the age old Vision of Immortality
