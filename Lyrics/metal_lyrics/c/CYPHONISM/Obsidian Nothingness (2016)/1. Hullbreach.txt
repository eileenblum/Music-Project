Hullbreach!
The Rays of Light shine through the 
debris

System Failure - A chaotic State of Mind
A Consciousness fading - Blackout
I feel this will be my last Sleep
I feel this will be my last Sleep

Awakening from the State of Hibernation
To the overwhelming Pain of Breathing

The Consequence of Imperfection
Stranded on the Coasts of Hell
Always crawling
A Trace of Blood marks my Path
Moving forward
Always crawling

Stuck in those inhuman Surroundings
All Divinity is lost
This is a true Task of Survival

And in the Distance I see
What seems to be another Being
We are the sickness

The Consequence of Imperfection
Stranded on the Coasts of Hell
Moving forward
A Trace of Blood marks my Path
Always crawling
Moving forward
