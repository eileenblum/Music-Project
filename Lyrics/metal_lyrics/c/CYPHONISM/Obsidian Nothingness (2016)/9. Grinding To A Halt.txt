Weâre on a Rampage
On our Way to Victory
We are the only Species trying to kill itself
We are the only ones
Driven by Desire by Greed and Lust
By Greed and Lust

With closed Eyes destroying everything
Until there is nothing left to live for
And then when the Night forever overshadows our Minds
We will die in the Cold

We will be restless

Show me a Sign of Regret
Iâll show a Way to plead
Iâll make you bleed
Feed you to the Ground
The Root of all Evil
The Seeds of the Devil

With closed Eyes destroying everything
Until there is nothing left to live for
And then when the Night forever overshadows our Minds
We will die in the Cold

Our Souls forever roam this World
Are we the Insects?
Are we the Parasite that is infecting the Earth?
Are we the Burden?
Are we the Misery that you have to bear?
That you have to bear â have to bear

We had the Chance to save ourselves
We had the Chance to change us
Never have we been the innocent Bystanders
That we claim to be
