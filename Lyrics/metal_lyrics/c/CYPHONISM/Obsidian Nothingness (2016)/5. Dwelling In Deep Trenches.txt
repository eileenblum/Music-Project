Fear what is dwelling
Fear what you have forsaken

Heavy Steps send Echoes through the Earth
Dwelling in deep Trenches
The Shattering of Wastelands wakes the Beast within
An endless Aeon has come to an End

The restless Wanderer finally begins to breathe
Fear what is dwelling
Fear what you have forsaken

Ten thousand feet deep in the Ground
The Mother was awoken by the Cries of its dying Kin
For all Life will come to an End
The War of Gods and Men has doomed this World

The restless Wanderer finally begins to breathe
Fear what is dwelling
Fear what you have forsaken

Rise and take Your Throne
We shall rule the hundred Skies

Let them falter
Let them perish
Adhering to the Books of false Prophecies
Praying to the fallen God

Let them falter
Let them perish
