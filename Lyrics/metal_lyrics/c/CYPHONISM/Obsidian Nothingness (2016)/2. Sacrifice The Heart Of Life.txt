They feared his Name
An Incarnation of Gods
Casting a barren Earth upon this World
And desiccating the open Sea
They bow in his despotic Dominion
As he is blackening the Skies
Dethroned from the Heavens
To lead the Legions

His presence nourished by Horrors
A new Form of Monstrosity
The black Crown upon his Head
And seven Arms to command his Slaves
Blood is pouring out the Eyes

While he is speaking in Tongues
While he whispers to us all
âSacrifice the Heart of Life
Open the Gates - close the Circle
And call for my Name

And you will never again
Be apparent to Eyes of the Undeserving
I will bring the Night upon this Realm
Your Flesh will become one with the Hazeâ

âPer orbis ad obscuritas!
Ite, missa est!â

"I cast barren Earth upon this Dying world
And desiccate the open Sea
My touch of Death dries out the Land
Civilizations lost - buried in Sand
Now bow down! - Kneel before me!"

While he is speaking in tongues
While he whispers to us all
âSacrifice the Heart of Life
Open the Gates - Close the Circle
And call for my Name

âPer orbis ad obscuritas!
