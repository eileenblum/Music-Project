I will be more than just a God - An eternal Presence

You shall never forget my Face
Forever you shall hear my Voice
A Monument - A Sign of Apotheosis
The Beginning of an endless Reign
As I will disconnect myself from all
Terrestrial Confinements
I rule my Subjects even from the Afterlife

Chronophobia!

Fear the End to come
Pray to the Father of Time

Fear the End to come
Pray to the Father of Time
I am immortal
I am Inheritance
I am immortal
I am Inheritance

We are the Epiphany!
You live in this desperate Fear
Our Prevelence endures Eternety!
You will degenerate into Nothingness
We are the Singularity!
You are mere one amongst the Masses

Chronophobia!

"Unaware he walks on predefined Paths into Damnation
Guided by the alien Overseer"
