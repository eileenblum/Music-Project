The existence is obscure
They mighty reign as they like
Secretly planning
Hidden forces
Who decide
Your destiny
Forces out of darkness decide
Out of the underground
No light shines at their gathering
Muffled speaking, secret plans
Our sympathy is unconcerned
Their influence is growing
Enemies will be annihilated
They increase their wealth
We are led
Bloodstained money
Dead bodies on their way
Unconscious, helpless
We think we are led
We are led
We can't guess their acting
Maliciously unsupposed
Accompanied by a gloomy authority
Our sympathy is unconcerned
Their influence is growing
Enemies be annihilated
They increase their wealth
We are led
