Narcissistic rage
Anger rushes trough my veins
Changes my mind, drives me insane
Desires of panic
Tortured by hate
Get off before itÂ´s too late
Get off before itÂ´s too late
Get the fuck off
Before itÂ´s too late
Out of control
Bitter vengeance
Out of control
Freak out, psych out
Out of control
Give me a knife
Out of control
I will cut your throat
(Narcissistic rage)
Running towards you
Smashing down the door and then
Crushing the table
Destroying everything
Now it's all messed up
Your blood is on the wall and
There you lie you jerk
Donât try to mess with me
