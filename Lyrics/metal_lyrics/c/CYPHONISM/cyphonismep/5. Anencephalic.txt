Shattering diagnosis
Neural tube defect
Missing forebrain, neocortex, skull and scalp
Blind, deaf, unconscious
No cure, no treatment
Blind, deaf, unconscious
No cure, no treatment
Life expectancy - several days
The prognosis for patients is death
Youâre destined to die
Life expectancy - several days
The prognosis for patients is death
Youâre destined to die
Brain convolutions
Stuck out of my head
Nutrition and hydration
Medically futile
Let nature take its course
Squeezing through the gate of birth
Heavy pressure on defect bone
Feelings are gone
Disgusting waves
Pushing forward
No chance to resist
Will I live or will I die?
Damned to be a clump
Life is too senseless
Welcome on earth
Your trip will be short
Welcome on earth
Not stillborn
Welcome on earth
No right to exist
Welcome on earth
Your time runs out
Your time is now
Innerst pain
Rips it apart
Torture agony
Now it's too late
All hope is gone
Deceased is my flesh
Deceased is my blood
