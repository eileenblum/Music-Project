Omniscient power
Blinding the masses
Hiding â devour
Occluding whatÂ´s underlying
Days in haze
Blurred view
Deny my being
Obstruct the light- far from me
Segregated herd
Perfect deception
Constant threat
Authority- not benign
Inherent rights
Orb of illusion
Marching on
Remnants of pain
Disruption
Divergence
Dysfunction
Question the sway
No
Lucid
Interval
Dispose our souls
Destroying the seed
Breaking the will
Drained in lies
Confined - to kill the weak
Split information
Separated minds
Total isolation
Nourish the gods âalmighty
Wretched servant
Breathing in depression
Paralyzed conception
Sub-capsular
Walk this path of
Immortality
Interrupt this flow of
Virtualized reality
Obsessed with oppression
Breading mistrust
Defiled with hatred
Loose of control
Strenuous efforts
Departing virtue
No Deviation
Divide and conquer
Strenuous efforts
Departing virtue
No Deviation
Divide and conquer
