[Cserfalvi]

May the Lord go before you to show you the right path.
May the Lord beside you to embrace and protect you.
May the Lord be behind you to guard you from the treachery of evil men.
May the Lord be below you to catch you when you fall and free you from the net.
May the Lord be in you to console you when you are sad.
May the Lord be around you to defend you when others attack you.
May the Lord be above you to bless you.
May the good Lord bless you.
