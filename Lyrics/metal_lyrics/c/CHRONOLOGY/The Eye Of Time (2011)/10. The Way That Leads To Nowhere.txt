[Cserfalvi / Kiss]

[Son:]
Itâs the land of nowhere
Dark side of the Earth
Strange horizons
Endless desert

I walk on colourless fields
With lifeless stones around
Hopelessness in my heart
Dark thoughts in my mind

God, which way I have to choose
Pleas give me the answer
God, give me something I can use
Just send me a sign

I think of my home
My childhood dreams
Why did I leave them
Now I canât explain

Though I still canât find the way
And I may lose the game
But if I could start again
Then I would do the same

Itâs the land of nowhere
Dark side of the Earth
But the dawn will show me
The end of the desert

Iâm still on colourless fields
But now I can see the light
Hopelessness disappears
As I leave the night behind
