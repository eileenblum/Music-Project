[Boros / Kiss]

[Son:]
Iâm so far from home
The search goes on and on
The old man told me how to get here
Finally I arrived on a stormy night
I had to lie about myself
But they believed me and took me in their lives
But thereâs something they try to hide

Thereâs no time to waste
I must investigate
No one knows my fatherâs name
He has never been in this monastery
The monks turned away when I asked about
The Guardians of Eternity
I feel they lie to me

But a few days ago
I saw a secret room
I want to know

Why didnât they let me inside
I wonder what they try to hide
Shadows int he candle-light
Please, help me to hide away
God, hear me pray

Dark night, pouring rain
Blood boils in my veins
I climbed the wall, I broke the window
And now Iâm here in this hidden place
A scriptorium, itâs full of treasures
Hopefully Iâll find the missing trace

A book behind locked doors
Itâs just like mine
Thatâs what I saw

These two books almost look the same
I became a thief so I must run away
I found a map int he stolen one
It will show the way
God hear me pray
