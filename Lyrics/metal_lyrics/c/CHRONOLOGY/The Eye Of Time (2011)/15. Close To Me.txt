[Boros / Cserfalvi / Kiss]

[The Eye of Time:]
Stay close to me
And youâll see all my secrets
Wait patiently and when the right time comes

Open the door that will lead you to a place
Youâve never seen before
But you know how to name
Forget your fears, donât be so paralyzed
Now everythingâs so clear, just go ahead through me

I know what you feel, I know your reasons
You want to heal this dying universe

Donât care about what the unbelievers say
They donât understand it
They canât follow your way
You see the world
Through so different eyes
Theyâre captured by the limits of their minds

Just chaos all around, youâre almost out of time
The noise is too loud
Oh, can you hear my words?

The end has begun
And you are the One
Menâs only hope
When thereâs nowhere to run

The Gods are waiting
You cannot fight your fate
Use my power
Before itâs too late
