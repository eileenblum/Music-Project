[Cserfalvi / Kiss]

[Son:]
Pictures and strange unknown words
I wonder what they can say
A language that Iâve never heard
But I have to try to solve this mystery

No way I can make it alone
I need someone to help
My mind is cold like a stone
Strange calm that Iâve never felt
My old friend who taught me before
In my childhood years
Together we can open the door
Together we will find the key
Find the key, open the door

[The linguist:]
After two long, sleepless nights
The secret I still canât unfold
There are so many never seen marks
Though Iâm a linguist I canât break the code

Only traces can I give to you
Only some little parts
Use them to find the truth
My mind slowly turns into dark
One piece means nothing at all
Try to collect them now
Itâs a puzzle, make it whole
Iâm so tired I canât help you more
Iâm so tired, I canât help

[Son:]
Pictures and strange unknown words
Where do they try to lead me?
Strange concern between two worlds
I collate the pieces to unfold it

Maybe there is another way
But itâs so insane
The guards didnât just keep the gate
They played a dangerous game
Maybe âGateâ stands for the âEyeâ
And the word âKeepersâ means âGuardiansâ
What if they could rule the time
And use it to travel there and back?
Find the key, open the door
But itâs all so weirdâ¦ Can anyone tell is it real or just imagination?
