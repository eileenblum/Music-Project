[Cserfalvi / Kiss]

[Father Godthart, the First Guardian:]
The time the ages â theyâre waiting for me
Like a book like pages â and I will read them all
Theyâll show the secrets Iâve never seen before
Hesitation and regret are all behind me now

Donât want me to stay away
Iâve got the chance I have to try

Eye of Time - you are mine
Take me where I want to be
Eye of Time - you are mine
Iâve got the key
Eye of Time - you are mine
Show me what I want to see
Eye of Time - you are mine
You own my mind

My thoughts, my feelings theyâre rushing all around
The work that Iâve done at last pays me the price
I found the only path that leads to new dimensions
Maybe thereâs no way back, maybe itâs a one way ride

Donât want me to stay away
Iâve got the chance I have to try

Eye of Time - you are mine
Take me where I want to be
Eye of Time - you are mine
Iâve got the key
Eye of Time - you are mine
Show me what I want to see
Eye of Time - you are mine
You own my mind

My thoughts, my feelings theyâre rushing all around
The work that Iâve done at last pays me the price
I found the only path that leads to new dimensions
But thereâs no way back, maybe its a one way ride
