[Cserfalvi / Kiss]

[Son:]
Set me free I need to go
Where is he? You have to show
The mystery of whirling time
The meaning of his secret life

[The Guardian:]
First we have to get the key
That brings you back to reality
Without this you canât return
Without this you have to turn back

The night is falling down
I think itâs time to leave

Somewhere in the timeless space
Heâs suffering closed in a horrid place
Save him now from the eternal pain
I canât wait to see him again

[Son:]
I left behind my prison cell
Midnight comes I hear the bell
Cold wind blows into my face
I stay in the shadow, I wonât leave a trace

This Guardian, my fatherâs friend
Is the only one who understands
That I believe in his innocence
And I will get the evidence

When night is falling down
The Hall of Doom waits for me

Somewhere in the timeless space
Heâs suffering closed in a horrid place
Iâll free him from the eternal pain
I can make it and Iâm not afraid

The Gate is waiting
For me to get in
The Gate is waiting
Iâm gonna get in

This is now the moment of truth
I walk through the Gate
The Eye of Time opens before me
I reached the point of no return
Thatâs the way of fate
Where does it end? Nobody can foresee

[Aurelius:]
You have to know what really happenedâ¦

After a long, long research,
the First One found the way to
use the power of the Gate.
I tried to keep him away
but he went back in timeâ¦
He made a massive chaos and thatâs
why your mother died.
I tried to save her and make everything right.
But I had to realize there was nothing I could do.
When I came back, his followers
were already waiting for me.
I couldnât tell the truth anyone,
they brought me here and left me
to suffer âtill the end of timeâ¦

[Son:]
Follow me, I know the way
That leads us out of here
We can break the power of frozen time
Iâll be there to prove youâre right
You can count on me
Tell the council what the First had done

Thereâs nothing to fear of now
Though the evil First escaped somehow
Across the Gate he ran away
He realized that he have to pay

My fatherâs honor has been restored
The First Oneâs place was his reward
I stay with him as his right-hand man
Itâs a dream come true I will be one of them

The sun is rising again
A new beginning has come

[Aurelius:]
I forget my mourning and grief
In God we trust, in the future I believe
I broke free of the frozen time
Iâm not alone and I wonât be anymore
