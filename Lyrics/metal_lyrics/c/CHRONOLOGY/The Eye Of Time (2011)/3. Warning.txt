[Cserfalvi / Boros / Kiss]

[Father Aurelius:]
What did you think
When you turned against the nature?
You broke the rules, the law that the Gods created
How can you say
That your science is the savior?
You canât bring back all the things that faded

Donât forget the words.
âEverything is fixed and you canât change itâ

Why do you believe
In a false imagination?
You should know the time is not your servant
Donât be so proud
Of your terrible creation!
Itâs madness to believe that you can rule it

Donât forget the words.
âEverything is fixed and you canât change itâ

Youâre leaving all the world behind
For making real your dream
But Iâm afraid you have to fall
I wish that I could hold you back
But you donât hear my scream
Out there youâll be alone
No one to call â to save you

What did you think
When you turned against the nature?
You broke the rules, the law that the Gods created
Donât be so proud
Of your terrible creation!
Itâs madness to believe that you can rule it

Youâre leaving all the world behind
For making real your dream
But Iâm afraid you have to fall
I wish that I could hold you back
But you donât hear my scream
Out there youâll be alone
No one to call â to save you
