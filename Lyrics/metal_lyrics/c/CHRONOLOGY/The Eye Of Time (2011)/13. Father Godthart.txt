[Boros / Kiss]

[Son:]
Well at last I see much clearer now
But I need someone to tell me how
to carry on my way
Itâs the first scene and Iâm here again
Iâm looking for the librarian
To help me find my way

Hereâs the book I give it back
But you must help to understand
what itâs all about
The Guardians, the Eye Of Time
The solution I still canât find
There are so many doubts

[The librarian:]
I canât see the truth
How could I help you
Youâll must move on
When the time has come

Iâve heard about an order
So far away from here
Iâve heard about their leader
This creature frightens me
His name is Father Godthart
I saw him once before
I felt in him thereâs something evil
Something wrong

I donât think you see much clearer now
Iâm sorry I canât tell you how
To carry on your way
I suggest you stay here for the night
Relax until the morning light
Donât you run in vain
