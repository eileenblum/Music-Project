[Cserfalvi]

Here comes the legend of a mystical place
Hidden away from prying eyes
Faceless, nameless guardians keep
Their dark secret there.

You can never see it, you can never touch it
You can never understand it!
No evidence, there are only
Softly whispered words.

Hall of doom
Ancient gods
The Eye of Time.
