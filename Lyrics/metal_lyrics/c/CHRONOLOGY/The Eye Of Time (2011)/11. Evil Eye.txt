[Cserfalvi / Kiss]

[The archabbot:]
Youâve come to me
And I see it in your eyes
That you need some help
But you want to hear no more lies

So big pressure on you
What youâve been through
No one else could ever do
And now Iâm afraid
That you have to face
The darkness, the most evil place
Oh, you should beware
But you donât care
About all my fears

No, I wonât hold you back
But watch your steps
Itâs a long and dangerous path
And the end of this journey
Yes, it could be
The end of your life

I canât imagine
What awaits you there
When you arrive
I know youâre strong
But you canât be prepared
Fort he Evil Eye

You can find your dreams
Over the hills

A godless horde
In a satanic church
They keep that thing
They keep it from any search
Donât ask me for more
Iâve said it before
I donât know what they use it for

Some call it the Eye
They try to hide
Until the end of time
If you reach their gate
They wonât hesitate
They will take your life

I canât imagine
What awaits you there
When you arrive
I know youâre strong
But you canât be prepared
Fort he Evil Eye

I pray to God to bring you back here
Safe and sound
To keep your soul
When youâre on the devilâs ground
