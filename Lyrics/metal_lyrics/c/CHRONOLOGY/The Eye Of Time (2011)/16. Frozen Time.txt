[Boros / Kiss]

[The Guardian:]
Time has come for me
To pay my dues
Iâve made a wrong decision
Now I can make it right

I know his name
Though weâve never met before

[Son:]
My journey ends
The gate exists
I saw it for myself
But now Iâm caught
In a deep black hole
God! Is there someone to help?

[The Guardian:]
Donât be afraid
I am on your side
I have something
To tell you about the old days

Back in timeâ¦
Eighteen years agoâ¦
Dark timesâ¦
Mourning and grief
The said he lost his mind
He broke the rules
And used the Gate
To bring your mother back to life

I wonder why
There was no trial
The councilâs judgement was too fast
They had no doubt that he belonged
To the prison of unmoving past

So many things
I canât explain
I canât read in their minds
But Iâm sure that he is not that kind
Heâd never commit any crime

No one can imagine that place.
No windows to look out to the world.
The time doesnât exist there.
Caught in a neverending moment,
you  are buried alive forever.

I wish I could
Turn time back
Iâd try to save him someway
I just stood there so helplessly
And watched as they took him away
