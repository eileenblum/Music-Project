[Cserfalvi / Kiss]

[Son of Aurelius:]
Iâve heard too many lies
I donât want to hear them anymore
All those family ties
Just hide from me the truth
Like a big, black wall

Cousin of son:
I tell you now
What I can recall
I saw him with dangerous men
Before he left us all
They stood around
Like holy chosen ones
I asked him who they were?
He said: âThe Guardiansâ

Itâs hard to understand
What happened to him at that time
Try to find a man
I think he was his friend
Maybe heâs alive

I tell you now
What I can recall
Find this man he knows much more
About your fathers fall
Donât be afraid
His place is not so far
But are you sure youâre ready to know?
The truth is so bizarre

Those were so troubled times
He was twisted by hazy ideas
But I saw the fear in his eyes
And one day he went away

[Son of Aurelius:]
I know this road
I follow the trace
Iâll find this man I need to know
What was my fatherâs fate
I donât turn back
And Iâm not afraid
They say itâs a forbidden path
But I donât care
