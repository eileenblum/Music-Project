WE... HAVE... NO... BA... NA... NAS... TO... DAY!

2001...
We're back stronger than pokemons
As most of you have been asking for more...
(For the ones who join us today and want a summary
there were two albums before the one you're holding in your hands
Still you may purchase it by mail order
through Kodiak, Seasons of Mist, Holy Records and Adipocere)

I see you want a lil' bit of salsa
I can see you want a lil' bit of rumba
I see you want a huge part of grind
No disappointment - all this you will find

We've got everything inside our shop
C. in C. 'll make you sweat until you drop
You'll get everything that you want us to play
But sorry... we have no bananas today
No way!

We've got gloomy tunes and funny ditties we would like to spare
And secrets about journalists that we would like to share
As the habits of some famous actors of the French scene
You wouldn't believe the things we've seen, it isn't what it seems
You'll never forget what we're going to say
But yes, we have no bananas today

I see you want a lil' bit of salsa
I can see you want a lil' bit of rumba
I see you want a huge part of grind
No disappointment - all this you will find

We've got everything inside our shop
C. in C. 'll make you sweat until you drop
You'll get everything that you want us to play
But sorry... we have no bananas today
No way!

Won't you taste an orange?
Won't you taste a lemon?
Won't you taste an apple?
Now won't you taste my fist?

We're there to fulfill your needs
Whatever you may like
But don't you bite the hand that feeds
When bananas are hard to find

I see you want a lil' bit of salsa
I can see you want a lil' bit of rumba
I see you want a huge part of grind
