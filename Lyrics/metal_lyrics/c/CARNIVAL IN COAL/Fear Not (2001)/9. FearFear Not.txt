"Quel intrt que de ce monde? J'en aspire plus...Que sommes nous? Pices informes sur un chiquier que nous ne connaissons pas les rgles...Craindre ou pas craindre?"

Fear that little light in the apple of my eye
When I don't understand how you can be so twisted
Fear that little spark in the apple of my eye
When I don't comprehend how you can resist to me

Fear not pain... It will be easy...
Fear not pain... Everything will go fast.

I have never been the one to provoke conflict (I'm such a coward)
I have never been the one to provoke pain (Je suis doudouille)
I have always been the one to provoke anger (I know you're disappointed)
I have always been the one that spoils it all (Why don't you leave me?)

Fear not pain... And things will go on cause shit happens...
Fear not pain... It happens everyday of our lives.
Fear not pain... Fear not pain...

Leave me we're no good together
You deserve something better

Fear not me gone
Fear not me somewhere else
Fear not coldness in my part of the bed
Fear not the lack of my arm around your breasts
Fear not the problems you can't guess
Fear not the problems you can't guess

Fear not me gone
Fear not me somewhere else
And because one day I may leave
Fear not the idea of death
Because one day I may leave
So fear not the idea of death
