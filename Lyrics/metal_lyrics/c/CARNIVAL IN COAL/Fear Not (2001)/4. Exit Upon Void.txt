Forgiven or damned, whispered Scarbo.
With a spiderweb for shroud I'll bury you down below.
And into the crypt where you'll have to die.
Out in the limbo you'll hear the children cry!

Let me have an aspen leave to cradle me across the lake
Unless the trunk of (the) tarentula will suck me down inside my grave.

No way! he laughed.
You'll be the fodder of the beetle hunting it's prey at dusk.
Wrapped in a snakeskin, covered with gold,
Your only escape is a dive in the void.

(A birdsong in the distance invites my look through the trees.)
And when my life is over, remember I taught you how to please me:

Come with me, follow me if you dare
On a strange journey, a trip to nowhere...
I will take you down below
With Charon for guide to visit the unknown.

Your life will be a way for me to pay for all my sins.
I'm sure the shores of hell will find in you a graceful gift.

Forgiven or damned,
Whispered Scarbo...
You'll soon understand
That it don't mean nothing
For those who are blinded by insanity,
Heaven or hell it means nothing to thee...
Means nothing to thee...
It means nothing to thee...
Those who are blinded by insanity...

Come with me, follow me if you dare
On a strange journey, a trip to nowhere...
I will take you down below
With Charon for guide to visit the unknown.

Your life will be a way for me to pay for all my sins.
I'm sure the shores of hell will find in you a graceful gift.

Forgiven or damned, whispered Scarbo.
With a spiderweb for shroud I'll bury you down below.
And into the crypt where you'll have to die.
Out in the limbo you'll hear the children cry!
