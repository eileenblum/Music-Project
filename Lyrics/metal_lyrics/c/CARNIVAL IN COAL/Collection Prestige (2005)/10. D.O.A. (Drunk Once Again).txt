Awaken by a bird song sounding like a steel fork on the bottom of a saucepan,
I yawned and scared myself with the wet dog smell coming from the hole that used to be my mouth
(but for now, there's a sponge inside).

Morning promises, tomorrow's treasons
D.O.A.
Keep on feeding my liquid illusions
D.O.A.
Morning promises, tomorrow's treasons
D.O.A.
Drunk Once Again...

Wine stains, puke smells
If I drink again I'll go to hell
Locked door, I'm too tired
Sitting on my pride, I'll sleep outside

Morning promises, tomorrow's treasons
D.O.A.
Keep on feeding my liquid illusions
D.O.A.
Morning promises, tomorrow's treasons
D.O.A.
Keep on feeding nothing
Nothing
D.O.A.
(I hate myself too when I'm drunk)
