Think that I've become incurable
A stool with a skirt could be possible
Let me proceed I am hot as hell
Don't go away jolie Mademoiselle

Let yourself go
Go down below
You won't have this honour everyday

She walked away, found me laughable
My technique must be improvable
Someone find me a charisma dealer
An easy method of delicate humour

Rotten luck
Lost again
Another night
With Mr. Hand

In the end
Nobody goes unfucked but me
(Fuck me I'm famous)
Everyone gets a ride for free but me
(Fuck me I'm famous)
You can't hurry love no you just have to wait
But waiting for thirty years seems OK
(I'm with the band)
Nobody gets unfucked but me

"Man turns animal for the erotic pleasures of women... and men."

Threatening would be unforgivable
Drugging would be a poor spectacle
Though the beast is howling to be fed
Ain't got many choices to fill my bed

Let yourself go
Go down below
You won't have this honour everyday

This time it seemed to be feasible
She smiled and said I was edible
While undressing she swore she loved our songs
So I showed her all my bass licks all night long

Stuck up bitch
She went away
What's wrong with the girls today?

In the end
Nobody goes unfucked but me
(Fuck me I'm famous)
Everyone gets a ride for free but me
(Fuck me I'm famous)
You can't hurry love no you just have to wait
But waiting for thirty years seems OK
(Where is my share?)
Nobody gets unfucked but me

"The chase is better than the catch."

The chase is better than the catch
But catching nothing gets boring
Everyone gets a ride for free but me
Ain't I Fuckable?
