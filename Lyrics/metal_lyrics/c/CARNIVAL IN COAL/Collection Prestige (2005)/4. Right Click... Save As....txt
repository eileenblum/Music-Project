"Right click... Save target as..."
And the work is done
Easy as ABC, on a golden plate
Free for everyone
A track won't be enough
Get the complete works,
What does it change?
5 hours to swallow
A lifetime creation
Anything strange?

From Elvis to the Doors up to Judas Priest
I've got it all! Browse my folder, fill your disk
From Sinatra to Genesis up to MotÃ¶rhead
The universal knowledge
The masterpieces of all time Art
For free, just add it to your virtual cart
And when a singer gets ruined and ceases to sing
The TV channels will build some new kings

"Right click... Save target as..."
Or fill your wish list
Don't forget anything, it would be a shame
No file is missing
The last one of the folder
You shouldn't neglect
This one's a hit
The artist is glad to show you
His supermarket bills
And his rent receipts

From the Shadows to the Stones up to Napalm Death
I've got it all! Browse my folder, hold your breath
From the Beatles to the Bee-Gees up to Brutal Truth
The universal knowledge
Went to the baker's
Stole some bread
Got arrested
That makes no sense
