We are glad to inform you
That what you see is your life
Thinking forbidden (life)
Buy your illusions (life)
All credit cards are welcome (life)
Thinking forbidden (life)
Buy your illusions (life)
(The camera eye is part of your life)
It's been there since day one
From the cradle to the grave
For entertainment's sake

And so it goes, over and over
There's even more dream in my refrigerator
More wit and humour in a liver slice
Much more excitement in a plate of rice
The TV dictatorship makes me sick
Rather vote by phone for a brainless chick
Than to open your wallet and give a dime
To the local bum so he can buy a bottle of wine

We are glad to inform you
That what you see is your life
Thinking forbidden (life)
Buy your illusions (life)
All credit cards are welcome (life)
Thinking forbidden (life)
Buy your illusions (life)
It's been there since day one
From the cradle to the grave
For entertainment's sake

Sometimes when I can't sleep at night
I must admit I feel guilty
I feel ashamed of human kind
I wish I left it all behind
Sometimes when I can't sleep at night
I must admit that I ain't proud...

So I grab my phone and vote for brainless chicks
And I order dozens of useless shits
And then I close my eyes and I fall asleep
Thinking of how happy I will be

So I grab my phone and vote for brainless chicks
And I order dozens of useless shits
Thinking of how happy I will be
On the delivery day
