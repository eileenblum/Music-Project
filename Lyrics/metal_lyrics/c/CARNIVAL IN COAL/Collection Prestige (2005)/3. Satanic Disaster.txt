On a Saturday morning anywhere on this planet
There's a guy dressed in black renting a camionnette
He's about to leave with a couple of friends
To play a show with their band called RINGLESS WITCHES HANDS
Six hours on the road across half their country
Driving carefully yet possessed by the spirit of the Unholy
How could they've known about the underground curse
(They'd spend) six hours on the road to have the pleasure to rehearse

Every Saturday evening anywhere on this earth
Guys in black plugging amps make the spotlights burst
Try to raise true evil from a bunch of customers
Then negotiate a beer with a close-minded bartender

Underground lives and forever will!
Bring me the head of the guy who's gonna pay the bill
Underground force shall rule forever!
Not tonight for this is a satanic disaster
Underground is something funny
Make a step out of it, be considered as trendy
Underground force shall rule forever
Not tonight for this is a satanic disaster

The power of the Goat nobody can deny
Is unfortunately stuck outside the doors of the bar
Five dark warriors are left with their satanic hits
Invoking forces of darkness before fish and chips

Underground lives and forever will!
Bring me the head of the guy who's gonna pay the bill
Underground force shall rule forever!
Not tonight for this is a satanic disaster
Underground is something funny
Make a step out of it, be considered as trendy
Underground shall rule forever
Not tonight for this is a satanic disaster

66 Euros and 60 cents
At the toll gate of the motorway
As they were waiting for an evil sign
That's exactly what they were asked to pay
Useless to call the Dark Lord as you feel lost
They were out to learn that to their cost
Their empty bellies moaning like living dead
Their heavy bodies waiting for a decent bed
Make up melts with sweat and tears
For Satan's sake, the skin lotion's near
Yet possessed by the hate of Christ
Yet spitting on the book of lies

Every Saturday evening till the end of time
Angry teens will wait in vain for a satanic sign
They will soon cut their hair and lead a normal life
Never again to reverse the perch of Jesus Christ

Underground lives and forever will!
Bring me the head of the guy who's gonna pay the bill
Underground force shall rule forever!
Not tonight for this is a satanic disaster
Underground is something funny
Make a step out of it, be considered as trendy
Underground force shall rule forever
Not tonight for this is a satanic disaster

Underground lives and forever will!
Bring me the head of the guy, bring me the head of the guy
Underground force shall rule forever!
Bring me the head of the guy who's gonna pay the bill
Underground is something funny

"Tels les chiens dans la plaine
Suppurant de sa haine
Transperce la chair
LÃ¨che le sang de la haine"
