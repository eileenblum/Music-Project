[Cinc]

I don't wanna hear your voice anymore
I don't want you around
I don't wanna see you sitting in my favourite armchair
I hope we'll never meet in town
(Relax...)

I don't wanna hear your voice anymore
I don't want you around
And I never wanna see you sitting in my favourite armchair
I hope we'll never meet in town

I wish you knew how I trusted in you
Too bad: you'll probably never know
I trusted in you... I trusted in you...
Too bad: you'll probably never know

Deceiver

You played the part of a well-dressed alter ego
You played the part of a well-dressed alter ego
You were my well-dressed alter ego
You were my well-dressed alter ego

I trusted in you

I don't wanna hear your voice anymore

Well-dressed alter ego

I don't want you around
