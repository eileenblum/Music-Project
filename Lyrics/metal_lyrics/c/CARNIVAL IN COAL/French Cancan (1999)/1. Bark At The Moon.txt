[Ozzy Osbourne]

Screams break the silence
Waking from the dead of night
Vengeance is boiling
He's returned to kill the light
Then when he's found what he's looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Bark at the moon

Years spent in torment
Buried in a nameless grave
Now he has risen
Miracles would have to save
Those that this beast is looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Bark at the moon

They cursed and buried him along with shame
And thought his timeless soul had gone
In empty burning hell - unholy one
Now he's returned to prove them wrong
Oh no, yeah baby

Howling in shadows
Living in a lunar spell
He finds his heaven
Spewing from the mouth of Hell
Then when he's found what he's looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Bark at the moon
