[Gerry Rafferty]

Winding your way down on Baker Street
Light in your head and dead on your feet
Just another crazy day, you'll drink the night away
And forget about everything

This city's dead and makes you feel so cold
It's got so many people but it's got no soul
And it's taken you so long to find out you were wrong
When you thought it held everything

You used to think that it was so easy
You used to say that it was so easy
But you're tryin', you're tryin' now
Another year and then you'd be happy
Just one more year and then you'd be happy
But you're cryin', you're cryin' now

Way down the street there's a light in his place
He opens the door, he's got that look on his face
He asks you where you've been, you tell him what you've seen
And talk about everything

He's got this dream about buyin' some land
He's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands
And then he'll settle down, it's a quiet little town
And forget about everything

But you know he'll always keep movin'
Cause you know he'll never stop movin'
He's a rollin', a rollin' stone
And when you wake up it's a new morning
The sun is shining, it's a new morning
You're going, you're going home
