Les clowns moqueurs, les jongleurs de boules,
Les acrobates, les magiciens, tout le monde danse en liesse.
La frnsie et le dsir virevoltent en une trange sarabande dguise.
Entrez le carnaval! Joignez-vous la fte!

Tear this town to ruins
Today the freaks they got elected
We've taken power by force
And celebrate it in joy
Dance la Carnivala
Much more violent than la Bamba
Sexier than la Lambada
We shall destroy la Discotheka

Enter the carnival
Orgiastic ritual
Enter the carnival

People dancing naked
A giant sexual anarchy
We shall copulate till dawn
And drown the sidewalks into seed
Preachers raping nuns
The homeless fucking the wealthy
Hidden aims are reached by all in this Carnival In Coal

Universal orgy
We shall infringe the laws of good taste
As we reign in fear
With lust in our souls

Bodies bathing in pools of gastric evacuations
Are breathing their lungs off with satisfaction and tiredness
A new reign has come where lust is the law and sex is the money
Where the impotent are thrown to jail
And the frigid are shot in public
VIVALAVIDA DI MIERDA!
