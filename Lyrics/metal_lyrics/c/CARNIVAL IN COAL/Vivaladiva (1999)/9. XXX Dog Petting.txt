Come. Come here. Don't move
Sit down and... sniff in my pants
Don't bite
Lick if you like my smell

How... how sweet this fur
Go on, please
Gentil le chien!
Soon will I come to give you my pride...

(Langue de chien, langue de mdecin)

You are my best friend and will stay so now
Sit on my lap
It is mesmerizing
I can't believe it
I'm so addicted to the way you're lickin'
And no one will tear us apart, never

You are my best friend and will stay so now
Sit on my lap
It is amazing
I can't believe it

And no one will tear us apart, no

Come. Come here. Don't move
Sit down and... sniff in my pants
Don't bite
Lick if you like my smell
