Little boy, thin and small
Never had a friend, always on his own
Other children bite and kick him
Beat and rape him
Cut and slash his face
Scratch his innards with blades
Make him eat his own liver
Even read his mail

Poor creature, sad and lost
Flies lay in his nose when he sleeps at night
Rabid neighbours bite and kick him
Beat and rape him
Pierce his eyes with nails
Throw his ears to the sea
Stick some cheese deep in his ass
Make it eat by a thousand mice

All this for one good reason:
The boy's got something really different
The boy's got something that's not the same
He's got the stuff that makes the difference
And people hate it, it's such a shame

He's dressed like Pazuzu
Not in pink and blue
Dressed like Pazuzu
Pauvre petit chouchou
