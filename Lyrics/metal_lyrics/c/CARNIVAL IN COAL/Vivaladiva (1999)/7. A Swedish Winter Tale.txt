So there was I, alone and lonely
But with a mighty mighty sword
At the very very end of a deep deep forest
In the white white snow

And a happy happy bird
It sang to me this song:
"O warrior
You who hold the sword to fight against forces
Of Good and Evil (and the Ones in Between)
Go to Rahahaaz
Tell the Lord of your country
That we, the People of Nature
Shall rise and win"

So there was I, alone and lonely,
When it sang me this song
