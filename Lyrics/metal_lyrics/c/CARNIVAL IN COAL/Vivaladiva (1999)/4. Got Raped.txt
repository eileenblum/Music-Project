Got raped at the sex-shop
Funny don't you think
A fourty years old mama found pleasure on my prick
Got raped at the cinema by two young girlies
Thought I was DiCaprio, tried to sink my Titanic
Got raped, violently abused, spoiled...
Got raped by a bisexual football team
My buttocks still remind me that it wasn't a dream

Everyone gathers to take advantage of me

Still I pretend not to agree

In the forest, at the mountain
On the beach or at the banks counter
At the swimming pool, in the train
At the flute lesson
At the hospital, at the grocer's
Under the abribus
In my own garden, in my bath
I'm coming across rapers

Everyone gathers to take advantage of me

Take me, beat me, eat me, bite me
Do as if I was a toy and bruise my bones
Force me, suck me, drink me, then leave me
Leave me for dead alone

Got raped, violently abused, spoiled...
Got raped at the sex-shop
Funny don't you think
A fourty years old mama found pleasure on my prick

Everyone gathers to take advantage of me

Where there is consent, there is no pleasure
Can't reach climax without violence
Where there is no pain, there is no gain
Push me onto the floor, slam me down on the door
My screams, my whispers
Ignore it, fuck me in blood and slaver
Force a tissue into my mouth
I'm yours, grab my thighs
Nah nah nah (saying) nananah

Everyone gathers to take advantage of me
