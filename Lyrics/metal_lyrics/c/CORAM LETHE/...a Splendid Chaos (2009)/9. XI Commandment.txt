Fog among buildings, in my veins there's only grey,
fetid constant smell of civilization,
neon lights illuminate my days.
Real light blinds my eyes,
natural chaos overpowers the silences.
Pathetic lives used up, mechanized,
pierced by ignoble indifference!
Diamond sharks on the hunt,
Here you'll find the slaves you're looking for!!!
Real light blinds my eyes,
natural chaos overpowers the silences.
There is only an illusory way out,
the journey into my mind has already begun
Where there is no pain or sadness
beyond this infinite oblivion.
I fly over places beyond colours,
aberration of my spirit!
Transforms living men: fills the land of silences,
fills my voids!
In this place I'm the hostile one,
all I can do is lose myself in time,
but I already remember where I come from!
And I don't have anything to lose,
don't spread my word in vain!
Next stop: the paradise of death.
