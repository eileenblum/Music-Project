I'm looking an old photo of far-off
reflections of life a veil of silence make my tears descend.
In this night, made of glaring lights and thunder,
like at a party: this is my moment, this is my hour,
we'll have fun together playing "craps!"
I should kill you brother before you stop hating me,
hoping that time can, erase the image.
I'll wear my medals, on my breast, your downfall!
Following orders is my innocence.
this is my moment, this is my hour,
a single shot, then eternal rest, "listen to me"!
This is my life, this is my faith,
today paradise is dressed in mourning!
Mother protect us with your big arms
The storm that dances among us is swift
It wants our body, it wants our blood,
I'll be condemned for this!
It wants our body, it wants our blood,
I'll kill myself for this!
So many bodies around me...
Mother make this fear become my strength!
