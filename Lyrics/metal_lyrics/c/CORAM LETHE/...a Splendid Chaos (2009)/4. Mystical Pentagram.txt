Stupidity of man consumes the heart of the earth corrodes, infects, generates chaos and decline.
Colours fade away, morning in black and white,
Hypnotic, unreal, eats dust of total radiation,
Mystical pentagram, everything needs to be done!
Artist of regret, it's late to start again!
Shapeless mutations, unexpressive still with no reason to exist.
Splendid shadows danced on the earth's surface
distant lights, surrounded the stone coast,
the sea attracts all the hidden silence
and suddenly everything becomes CHAOS.
General hallucination, permanent reaction,
reproduces, spreads, eats the heart of the earth
Mystical pentagram, everything needs to be done!
Artist of regret, it's late to start again!
Impatient deformations,
monstrous, brutal, psychosomatic death structures,
nasty silences in a rain of cry.
