I'm waiting through the darkness to discern the terror
it will be the moment when you'll pay for everything
run, run away, stupid bastard,
prepare yourself to live, my show of death...

I'll be light...witness of the event
I'll be fire...which spread live, while from my mouth:
"...Look, look at the flames, this is my hell...
...hear the shouts of the cowards...
they've lived as heroes, they will die as sinners..."

Breathe the dense air of a last premonition
this will be the moment you understand your errors
asking forgiveness among screams and desperation
now it is too late already the lights are on

They are burning, wrapped in my creation!
Burn, burn with me...

You can call me mad, this may seem insane...
All I want is my pain to vanish into the flames,
or don't say anything, you've only a few
seconds to reflect in only one last breath!
