In my sleep convulsive shocks assault my body
I stop and see fragments of a life that doesn't seem mine
In my chest heartbeats rebound like peals of far-away bells
I've tried to forget as if the world might begin today...
...But tomorrow cannot begin over again

Silent ghost surround me and whisper...
All the visions that my mind draws
Desolation and pain
Too tearful eyes that fix on nothing
A cold wind, my flow of tears

My scream echos
In the quiet valley
Among the silent shadows
In my inside

Everything I remember
Every face, every look
Unforgotten suffering
Reminiscence

Disquieting muses, dancing Divinity invites calls me
Continuous images mixed with psychotic cutting confuse me
Ancient seductive sounds reach me shaking my senses
I've tried to forget as if the world might begin today...
...But tomorrow cannot begin over again...

My outline design
In the pouring rain
My bloody hands
My pale face

Millions of voices
Every face, every look
Unforgotten suffering
Reminiscence
