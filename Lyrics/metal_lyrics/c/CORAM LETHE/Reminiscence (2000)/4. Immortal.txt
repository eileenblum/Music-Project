I see my image reflected in you
Why don't you talk to me?
I understand the emptiness in your mind
What are you, my brother?

Reflection of man's fear
For the coming of darkness

There is a dream to realize....
...Immortal...
Created by a race which believe
That the light will shine...
...Immortal...

I want to feel what you feel
I'm afraid I'll see only a shell
You hold me and a tear runs down your face
You're trembling but I can't understand
