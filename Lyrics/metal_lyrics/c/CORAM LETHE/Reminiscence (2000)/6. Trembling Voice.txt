Look around you everything seems calm
Look more deeply be aware of the pain

Powerful hands play every day
With the strings of puppets
Images and words deviate
The empty mind from reason

People follow everyday blindness

Like a sign from within
Trembling voice
Feel the fear but survive the abyss
Different doesn't mean worse
Trembling voice

Behind every corner, behind every door
Evil could be hidden Sometimes we feel its presence, maybe it's too strong
So you choose to go ahead

Like a sign from within
Trembling voice
Feel the fear but survive the abyss
You must follow the only road
Trembling voice
