Wake up soldier and prepare your fight
Take up your weapon to defend your dreams

But your dreams are weapons in hands of others
Ideals incite anger but confound the mind

A normal day of war
Or day of life... what are you living?
Heeding your heroes
What would you do?
Spill blood, kill those like you
But your seated hero, is he true or false?

Raise yourself soldier, it is only a flesh-wround
A small obstacle can't stop your dreams

Every day a war, every day of life
Look, your friends are falling
No longer shines that sun food of dreams
While you fight don't close your eyes
or your sun will arrive at....

...Sunset
