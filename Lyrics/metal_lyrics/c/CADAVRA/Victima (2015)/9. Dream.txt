Well, I'm trying to find my soul in all this mess
Broken pieces of my life lying on the floor
I try to really understand why it's me in the dark

Now all the fears have gone, they left me just a dream

Perverted reasons justify all my pain
Twisted judgment satisfies my ill-concern
I wasted all the useless prayers while I was burning down

Now all the fears have gone, they left me just a dream
