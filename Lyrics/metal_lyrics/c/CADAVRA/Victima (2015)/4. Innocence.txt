Innocence took my hands once
And kept away the cold
Innocence cared about me
And my childish ways

Beauty's design, caught me by surprise in a lonely night

Innocence gave me one day
A chance to burn my fears
Innocence gave me another day
A place to save my tears

Beauty's design, caught me by surprise in a lonely night
Devil's desire, embraced this soul of mine in a lonely night
Beauty's design, caught me by surprise in a lonely night
