I wake up holding a candlestick
Wishing to light up my room
I find the door but my eyes can't see
I walk around mystified

Hope, it's been hidden from me every dawn,
Forbidden for life, in a hole
It's a bloody curse of my soul

There are no clues I can understand
No signal, not even a piece of advice
Rejected, I'm looking forward to feeling
At least some kind of relief

I go to bed holding blame's strong hands
Wishing to wane in my sleep
I find the chains before I can dream
I stay awake for a while

Hope, it's been hidden from me every dawn,
Forbidden for life, in a hole
It's a bloody curse of my soul

I wake up holding a candlestick
Just give me some kind of relief
