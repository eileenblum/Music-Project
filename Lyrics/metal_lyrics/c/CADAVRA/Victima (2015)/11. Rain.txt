Late one night
In the light of my regretful thoughts, I found disgrace
Painted gray

Weary soul
In the middle of the darkest night, my dirty heart
Was dying black

Wait for the rain, it'll wash it away

Scars of time
If your soul seems to be dirty and out of light
Blame it on (the) time

In the dark
You decide to keep the pain away, patterns of suicide
They should be kept aside

Wait for the rain, it'll wash it away
