Angel coming slowly from the ashes of a different fire
Wings for flying, to take you to the land of desire and pain

Angel smiling once again, vicious sequence for you to be burnt
So inviting that you can't endure the touch again

Every word coming from your mouth is poisonous,
Killing me, killing you
I didn't know you were a killer angel

I'm you victim one more time, I feel your fingers dragging me down
I let you take my soul out, I let you give me pain again

And then I'm into one of those shades, confused and feeling out of place
Your halo looks so sacred, your hands asphyxiating

Now I see it was all a lie

Every word coming form your mouth is poisonous,
Killing me, killing you
I didn't know you were a killer angel
