Inside a cage, in flames my heart
Inborn desires, I wish I'd die

This desperate me
I hope tomorrow I can resist
This desperate me
I wish tomorrow you weren't not with me

Infested minds, incautious eyes
Invented lives, indelicate rhymes

This desperate me
I hope tomorrow I can resist
This desperate me
I wish tomorrow you weren't not with me

This desperate me... This desperate me
(Inbuilt regret, inner design Inactive joy, infernal life)
