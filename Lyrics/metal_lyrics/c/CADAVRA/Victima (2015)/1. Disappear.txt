A spirit fades as I walk away, words remain forgotten in the dark
All what you did, every sunset that you lived
Gone into oblivion, forever more
There's no way to solve this, we should've thought before it

Dying voices, disappearâ¦ Forever in the dark

A single view of the world is lost again
As I play this rotten guitar in freezing winter time
Abandoned ways, people left behind, away
No, no coming back, we've destroyed them all

Dying voices, disappearâ¦ Forever in the dark
