[Bonus Track]So there you were
In that black suit-dress
I still can't tell
All the interesting details

And there I was
With my female voice
Moving hips around
Behind that hat, your face

To the corner where you are
I'm rolling as a stripper does
And in my tight vampire garb
I'm moving through, your hat is out

While my eyes meet your eyes
I smell your flesh, your skin so white
My fingers madly undoing clothes
Wrapped slightly in red you go

Undress me, let's melt our hearts
It's your turn, let them burn

So, there you are
Almost naked as I like
Waiting for my final act
I'll teach you the vampire dance

Sharing temptations on stage
Don't feel regretful, it's ok
You said it's love in a higher plane
Slightly wrapped in red again

Undress me, let's melt our hearts
It's your turn, let them burn
