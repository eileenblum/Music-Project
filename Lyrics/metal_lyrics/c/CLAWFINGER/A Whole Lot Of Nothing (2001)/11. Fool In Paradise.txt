They say that the toes that you step on while you're on your way up
may be the same ones that you kiss going down
Whatever it takes is what you're willing to do
but what goes around will come back around
There may be room at the top with the cream of the crop
but you better be prepared for the hunt
becos' the ones you see now at the back of the line where up front,

so tell me, are you prepared to make the sacrifice
are you strong enough to live your life..like a fool in paradise

The things that you say while you're the star of the show
will be remembered when your legacy fades
so think what to say before you say what you think
or learn to live with the mistakes that you've made
The grass is always greener on the other side
that's because it's not the side that you're on
and all the friends you had when you were number one
they're all gone

[Chorus]

Like a fool in paradise.......I'm a fool in paradise
