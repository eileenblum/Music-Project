I'm two steps away from stepping over the edge and getting lost in the great unknown
Because one small step in the wrong direction is enough to shake the cornerstone
Where ever I'm thrown no matter where I end up it can't be any worse than here
If I'm sincere with myself then tell me what else is there really left for me to fear

I'm two steps away from just killing myself because I'm sick and tired of being the prey
but when I'm dead everything that I've said will loose it's meaning and fade to grey
I'm not ready for that I'd rather counterattack Instead of leaving my own song unsung
Because I'm too young to die and I can never justify not breathing air into my lunges

I'll take one more step until somebody stops me
I'll take one more step until somebody stops me
I'll take one more step until somebody stops me
I'll take one more step until somebody stops me

I'm two steps away from making somebody pay for everytime that I've been decieved
How can I believe a single word you say when I know you've got a card up your sleeve
I might be naive but I'm still forced to beleieve that all the best in life is yet to come
That's why I refuse to lose my faith in myself even after all the wrong that you've done

[Chorus]
