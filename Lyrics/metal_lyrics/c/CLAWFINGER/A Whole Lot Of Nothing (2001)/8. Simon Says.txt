You say destiny decided what was meant to be
I say I decide myself what's too become of me
Simon says there's not a chance we'll ever get along
and none of us say anything but we both think he's wrong

You say we can't choose the path of life  we walk upon
I say I already know which path I'm walking on
Simon says to both of us we're not allowed to move
And none of us say anything but we both disapprove

Simon says
Simon says
Simon says
Simon says
Simon says

You say we can't change the world if it can't change itself
I say I can't change the world before I change myself
Simon says we're not allowed to change the world we see
And none of us say anything but we both disagree

[Chorus]
