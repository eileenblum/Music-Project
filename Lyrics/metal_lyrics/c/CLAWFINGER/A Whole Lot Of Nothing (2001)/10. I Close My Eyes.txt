I close my eyes and hope that this is just another dream
Reality can't really be as bad as it seems
I hope for something better but I'm waiting for the worst
And when I open up my eyes I see the bubble burst
All my dreams are broken as the world is torn apart
Was it really meant to be this way right from the start
If this is all we live for then I wish that I was dead
Just so I could stop these thoughts from going through my head

I close my eyes
I close my eyes
I close my eyes
I close my eyes

I close my eyes again and wish that everything was fine
Even though I know that I'm just wasting precious time
I'm loosing my direction life is driving me insane
The more things keep on changing the more they stay the same
So please somebody catch me before I hit the ground
I just can't understand what makes this crazy world go round
The more I look around me the less I seem to know
If this is all there is then I don't know where I can go

I close my eyes
I close my eyes
I close my eyes
I close my eyes

I close my eyes and wish that I could turn back time
I close my eyes and wish that I could press rewind
I close my eyes and wish that I could change my mind
I close my eyes and wish that everything was fine

I close my eyes one final time to make my vision clear
The more I try the more my vision seem to dissappear
The world keeps turning around as I turn my inside out
I'm doing all I can to understand what life's about
But everywhere I seem to look the answer isn't there
Nobody's asking questions cos' nobody seems to care
There has to be some sort of meaning and a reason to exist
If this is all there is there must be something that I missed

I close my eyes
I close my eyes
I close my eyes
I close my eyes

I close my eyes and wish that I could turn back time
I close my eyes and wish that I could press rewind
I close my eyes and wish that I could change my mind
I close my eyes and wish that everything was fine
