You know I never believed you were for real
I don't appreciate you or understand how you feel
everytime no matter what I might find
you give me a feeling that It ain't mine
I don't believe in wasting time
and you give me a sign that you're out of your mind
It's frustrating not knowing the score
but when you walk across the room towards the door,I'm sure
You ain't ever gonna walk my way
Cos' I know that you've never liked me anyway,so don't stay
I wouldn't notice cos' I't ain't no loss
all you ever did was cheat on me and double cross
I won't be satisfied until you're gone
but I still want to know what is going on
You know that I've tried but I'm losing my hope
I can't cope cos' you're tripping and you're slipping like a soap on a rope

I won't break
I won't bend
I'll avenge
I'll get you in the end

The sooner you go the better,goodbye
I won't miss you and I think you know why,
You were never really much of a giver
You took alot away from me but I was always a forgiver and forgetter
But now I know better
so I'm leaving you hanging and you won't be forgiven
till I know that you're not living,anymore
I'm gonna get you like a fly on the wall
I'm gonna pull off your wings
and watch you crawl
then I'm gonna crush your balls
You better believe that I'm gonna make you small
I gotta get whatever I want
I want it all and I want it up front,here we go
I'm willing to bet'cha that I'm going to get'cha
and you're gonna regret that you ever even met me,I know

[Chorus]

All I can think about is getting revenge
and that'll be the day all my misery ends
but until I choose to make me move
I wan't you to think that you've got nothing to lose
but I promise you you'll pay your dues
the one place I wouldn't want to be is in shoes
What can I say I'm gonna make you pay
I'm gonna make you wish you never got in my way
get you back for all the wrong you did
for everything you put me through when I was a kid
I'm gonna neglect you and disrespect you
and then I'll reject you when you least expect me to
and no matter what you do you're screwed
You'll get your rights rejected and they won't be re-newed
I'm gonna throw the first stone this time
hitting you hard when you're off gaurd and the revenge is mine

[Chorus]
