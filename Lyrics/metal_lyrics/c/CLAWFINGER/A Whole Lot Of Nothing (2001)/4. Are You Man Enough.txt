Get a gun to protect yourself from someone else with a gun
Being armed up to the teeth that means you don't have to run
Better safe than being sorry,better alive than being dead
Better him than me you say as you aim your gun at his head
You live your life at gunpoint don't be scared be prepaired
It's peace you say that you fight for but it's war you declare
Take a life to save a life you call that living in peace?
It takes more than a piece of metal for the peace to increase

Are you man enough to hold a gun?
Are you man enough to turn your back and run?
Are you man enough to take a life?
Are you man enough to make one?

with your finger stuck on the trigger you're one hell of a man
but you won't be much of a macho when the blood's on your hands
if you live by the gun you'll die by the gun I promise you that
and you ain't got a godamn thing if all you've got is a gat
History repeats itself but still we don't pull the brakes
What will it take for us to learn to learn from our own mistakes
I'd rather die defending my own right to never bare arms
Than live pretending a gun will keep me safe from bodily harm

[Chorus]

If sacrifice is the price for freedom then tell me what's the use
killing someone to prove that killing is wrong still ain't no excuse
how can you believe that death will make the suffering cease
prepair to sacrifice your life once the bullets released

[Chorus]
