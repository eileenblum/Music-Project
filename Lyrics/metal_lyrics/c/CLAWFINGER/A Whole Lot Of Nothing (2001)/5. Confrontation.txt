You want confrontation without knowing what you're gonna hit
you kick up shit in all directions but no one seems to benefit
You waste your hate on decent people who don't deserve to feel your pain
You keep on breaking your confidence down until you drive yourself insane
You make accusations To justify your own abuse
Instead of just directing your anger where it could come to some use
You turn your back on bigger problems and let them go over your head
and then you turn someone you know into your biggest threat Instead

You want confrontation
You want confrontation
You want confrontation
You want confrontation

Everything you say is bullshit so don't raise your fucking voice
all you ever do is scream just for the sake of making noise

cos' You want confrontation
cos' You want confrontation

What's your motivation when you start to yell and shout
If you don't know when to be patient How can you learn to let it out?
You can't react without all sense of logic That's like beating yourself with
your fist
tell me what you can accomplish If you can't even learn to resist
You make accusations faster than you throw a dart
if you don't where you should aim it how can you turn hate into art
stay focused on the things that annoy or be caught in the same trap you set
becos' no one will need to destroy you if you're chasing your own silhouette

You want confrontation
You want confrontation
You want confrontation
You want confrontation

Everything you say is bullshit so don't raise your fucking voice
all you ever do is scream just for the sake of making noise

cos' You want confrontation I'll give you confrontation
cos' You want confrontation I'll give you confrontation

You want confrontation, well that's what you're gonna get
You want confrontation, You ain't seen nothing yet
You want confrontation, what's the fucking use
You want confrontation, have you got a good excuse
You want confrontation, Is that the best that you can do
You want confrontation, Tell me something new
You want confrontation, Who's confronting who
You want confrontation, Now I'm confronting you
