Hocus pocus bogus bullshit you're so fucking full of it
Commit yourself to jesus christ as long as you can benefit
Profit stealing,money dealing heartless piece of human trash
The only god you follow blindly Is a pocket full of cash

Thank's to god you're rich and healthy but what is that funny smell
I know you've built your church on other peoples misery &amp; hell
God gave you his greatest wisdom but I say your god's a dog
another holy cow to milk,another dead horse you can flog

I say you'll pay
I pray you'll burn in hell
I pray you'll burn in hell

You say Cash is king and God he can't afford to help me yet
then you tell me he'll arrive as soon as I write out a cheque
I don't need religion if you say I have to pay to pray
So I shake my head and turn the other cheek and walk away

I say you'll pay
I pray you'll burn in hell
I pray you'll burn in hell
I pray you'll burn in hell
I pray you'll burn in hell
liar
liar
liar
liar

I can help you see the stars shine  all I'll do is clench my fist
If I need to see the light then I can just turn on the the switch
Bending over's just like kneeling you're fucked over when you pray
If god is all that you believe in then you're being led astray

I say you'll pay
I pray you're gonna burn in hell
I pray you're gonna burn in hell
I pray you're gonna burn in hell
I pray you're gonna burn in hell
Liar
Liar
Liar
