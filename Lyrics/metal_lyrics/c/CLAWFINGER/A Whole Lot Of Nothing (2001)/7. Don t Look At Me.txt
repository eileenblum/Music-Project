Why don't you want to talk to me does it feel easier to pass me by
you read my face like I'm a fucking disgrace and you never look me in the eyes
the truth is always easiest to ignore and that's why you walk the other way
but is it really that hard for you to think of something comforting to say

Don't look at me as If I'm different
Don't look at me as If I wasn't there
Don't look at me as If I'm no good
Don't look at me as If you didn't care,as if I wasn't there!

You walk a little faster like you're trying to say that you really haven't got the time
and when I put my hand out for a coin or two you just pretend that you've gone blind
It seems hard for you to show any compassion for me but it wouldn't hurt for you to try
reality can be painfull but tell me have you ever wondered why?

[Chorus]

You like to keep a safe distance from me to make sure that we never meet
and just in case I might be dangerous you quickly turn and walk across the street
You're so scared of the sight that you see that you decide to never understand

Instead of judging me by the way that I look,accept me for who I am
Instead of judging me by the way that I look,accept me for who I am
Instead of judging me by the way that I look,accept me for who I am
Instead of judging me by the way that I look,accept me for who I am

[Chorus]
