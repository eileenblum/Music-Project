Introspection self perfection
Are you scared of your reflection
Suicide is no solution
Try to make your contribution
Don't believe in resurrection
You won't find the lost connection
Life is only what you make it
So decide if you can take it

There is no easy way out

Do you like the situation
Can you take the penetration
When you've made your reputation
Take care of your own frustration
Life is hard don't make it worse
Don't tell me your life's a curse
You can't regret the choice you've made
If you decide what chords are played

There is no easy way out

Can you feel your own frustration
Can you grip the situation
Do you feel determination
Do you feel the suffocation
Do you feel the sterilization
Do you feel the strangulation
Don't say that you don't want to live your life anyway
Don't say that you can't take another day
Don't say nobody cares about you anyway
Do you know what your friends would say
