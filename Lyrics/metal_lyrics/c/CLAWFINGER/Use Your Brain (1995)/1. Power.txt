You're politically correct no matter what you say
Convincing us all in every single kind of way
Cos you frame the words so that we really believe
That there's a depth in the message that you're trying to achieve
So you twist your tongue to make it all sound true
Making us believe that we haven't got a clue
You tell us all exactly what you think we want to hear
With theatrical tactics to boost your career
Every promise you make is just a promise you break
And you can never admit that you could make a mistake
Because you say one thing and you mean something else
You only care about yourself and your wealth so all I say is

Power to the one who doesn't want it
Do you want it why do you want it

With your military mind you were born a leader
And discipline and order is an everyday procedure
Sp bring out the man in every innocent boy
And teach them how to kill so they can search and destroy
To protect and to serve and to die with honour and pride
You say you're fighting for peace but that's the biggest lie
You're preparing for war and your martial law
But you don't know what it's for any more so all I say is

Power to the one who doesn't want it
Do you want it why do you want it

Power is a sickness power is to blame
Power is a weapon and it's driving me insane
Power is an enemy, power is pain
Power is a war but to you it's just a game
Power is glory, power is gold
Power is chaos and you're out of control
Power isn't freedom, power is a cage
Power is your sin and it feeds my rage

Power to the one who doesn't want it
Do you want it why do you want it
