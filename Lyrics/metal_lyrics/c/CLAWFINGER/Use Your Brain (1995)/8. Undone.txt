Â 
When I was young I was taught to throw sticks and stones
Because sticks and stones they could break your bones
The only way to get ahead that made any kind of sense
Was to enrich myself at other people's expense
I could walk over corpses to make myself a name
I would cheat and I could lie without showing no shame
People tried to stop me but they didn't understand
I wasn't looking for affection or a helping hand

To bad you never really understood the way of time
I never looked into my mind
I always meant to be the element of your crime
And don't ask me why

Why doesn't anybody listen
Why doesn't anybody hear
Why doesn't anybody see me
Why don't you interfere
Don't ask me why

I never told the truth cos I believed all my lies
I believed that if I made my own alibis
I would find a good reason and a better excuse
So I could justify my hate and my self abuse
I would satisfy myself in any way I could
Because I knew that I would always be misunderstood
I did a lot of mean things that are hard to forgive
But all I ever wanted was a life to live

To bad you never really understood the way of time
I never looked into my mind
I got to get yourself back to the sky
Don't ask me why

Why doesn't anybody listen
Why doesn't anybody hear
Why doesn't anybody see me
Why don't you interfere

Why doesn't anybody listen
Why doesn't anybody hear
Why doesn't anybody see me
Why don't you interfere

I just can't disguise your heat
Never need to know your beat
Don't ask me why

Looking back at my life there's a lot I regret
I made a lot of mistakes that I can never forget
But I didn't know better I was insecure
I guess I never took care of my problems before
I feel bad about the people that I pushed around
I feel bad about the people that I let down
I put the blame on myself I can't look the other way
Living with my guilt is the price I have to pay

Why doesn't anybody listen
Why doesn't anybody hear
Why doesn't anybody see me
Why don't you interfere

Why doesn't anybody listen
Why doesn't anybody hear
Why doesn't anybody see me
Why don't you interfere
Don't ask me why

Don't ask me why
