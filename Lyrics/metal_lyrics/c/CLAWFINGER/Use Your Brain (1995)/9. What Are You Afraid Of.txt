What a scam, you see I'm living in a land
Where the present situation is getting out of hand
Racist brutality's an everyday reality
It doesn't take more than a different nationality
Or being in the wrong place at the wrong time
To get abused or accused of committing a crime
If it's a sign of the time then it's time to change your mind
And leave your fucking ignorance way behind
So face the facts cos that shit is played out
You haven't got the slightest clue what you're talking about
Because the problem is you and your racist buddies
Prejudice right wing small time nobodies

What are you afraid of
What's your prejudice made of
What are you afraid of

The only one that's coming with a threat is you
So what the fuck are you afraid of
It's about true the real problem is you
Because you've made up your mind to hate them all
Except you say send them all back to where they're coming from
But it ain't that fun to be living on the run
You wouldn't want to age a gun blow the brains out your head
So try to understand the shit they're going through instead
Because a woman or a man with a different face colour
Is exactly the same as your own sister or brother

So first we let them in and then you want to throw them out
Well I'd really like to know what all this shit is about
Is it you are you afraid of what's new
Are you afraid of everyone that doesn't look like you
It's just a colour and I'm colour blind
The only colour I know is the colour of my mind
There's only one race and that's the human race
And every human being's got the right to feel safe
So stop this insanity and take a look around
Get a hold of yourself and get your feet on the ground
Stop playing around this shit has got to cease
In the name of understanding in the name of peace
