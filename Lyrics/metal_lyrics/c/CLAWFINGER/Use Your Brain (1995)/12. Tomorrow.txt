How many times will it take before we pull the breaks
Will we learn from all the past mistakes
That it's all about give or take
How many times will it take before we start to make
Can we make hope out of hate
Can we set the records straight
Now I want to get the message through to you
How can I make you understand
You've got to give a helping hand
What do we need, is it to achieve and believe
Is it that we've got to be true
Is it just a point of view

Some day there will be a tomorrow
Another day another vice another roll of the dice
Some way there will be a tomorrow tomorrow

Too many times there has been too many different signs
That too many people's minds
In the past have been blind
How much of our time can we spend wasting our time
Even all the biggest crimes
Are coming from inside our minds
It's up to you, will you do what can be done
Will you let the rat race be run
Do you think it can be won
So what's the cause, why do we need so many laws
We don't need another war
We can't win them any more

How many times will it take before we start to make
Can we make hope out of hate
Can we set the records straight
What can we do
What can we say
Is there a way
To get the message through to you
