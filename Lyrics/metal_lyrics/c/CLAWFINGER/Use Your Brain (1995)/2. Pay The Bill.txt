I can't complain I've made myself a name
And all I really want is five minutes of fame
Some material wealth and a life in good health
Cos all I really care about is myself
I don't know a single thing about the situation
But why should I care about the next generation
I've got everything I need but I still want more
I can't understand why you complain cos you're poor
I don't feel sorry for you we've got the same possibilities
It's all about taking your own responsibility
I took mine so I deserve what I got
I've got my name on the wall of fame I'm going straight to the top
It cost me a lot of money but I took my degree
And that's the biggest difference between you and me
There's not a thing in the world that my money can't buy
I can't understand why you didn't even try

So why complain I feel no shame I've used my skill
And the next generation has to pay the bill
So why complain I feel no shame I've used my skill
And the next generation has to pay the bill

You can't blame me because you're underfed
You should be glad that you've got a roof over your head
If you worked for a living you could pay your rent
Instead of begging me for help when all you're money's spent
You won't ever fool me because I know your type
I see you standing on the corner like a parasite
You're a loser and you know it but you don't even care
I can't understand why you say life ain't fair

So why complain I feel no shame I've used my skill
And the next generation has to pay the bill
So why complain I feel no shame I've used my skill
And the next generation has to pay the bill
Pay the bill pay the bill the next generation has to pay the bill
The next generation has to pay pay the bill

Give me one good reason why I shouldn't complain
I've done everything I can but it's still the same
I've got nothing to lose so why should I give a fuck
My life's a piece of shit and that's where I'm stuck
I never got a fair chance to even prove myself
So tell me why should I be nice to anybody else
You say you can't understand why I say life is a bitch
I can't understand how you can be so rich
So what do you mean we've got the same possibilities
I haven't even got your educational abilities
I dropped out of school before I took me degree
Cos the welfare line made more sense to me
I try to work for a living so I can pay all my debts
And I've come to realize this is as good as it gets
I hate my fucking life more than you hate me
I just can't understand why this is how it should be

So I complain it's still the same
We're standing still
while the next generation has to pay the bill
So I complain it's still the same
We're standing still
while the next generation has to pay the bill
Pay the bill pay the bill
the next generation has to pay, pay the bill
