Back to the basics supernaturalistic
Baby put away your make up and your lipstick
High heels tight skirts the rest of all your plastic
I'm telling you it's making you look even more spastic
Hanging at the hot spots looking for attention
Showing off your brand new silicone extension
All the men'll be staring but they only want to slam it
They couldn't give a fuck about your inside damn it
Back to the basics living as you earn
So forget about your money let it burn baby burn
You can't have it all how hard to ever try
No matter what you get there's always more you can buy
So walk it like you talk it forget about your street smart
The friends in your surrounding love you for your real heart
Spending all your money, boy don't waste it
Right about now we're going back to the basics

I know where I want to go
but in case you didn't know
I'm going back to the basics

Don't be ashamed about the way you might look
Because you don't read a person like you read a comic book
There's a whole lot more than meets the eye
And if you hear something else then it's a goddamn lie
The way you're going out is really getting to me
Cos people only see what they want to see
If life ain't more than money and a facelift
Right about now we're going back to the basics

I know where I want to go
but in case you didn't know
we're going back to the basics
