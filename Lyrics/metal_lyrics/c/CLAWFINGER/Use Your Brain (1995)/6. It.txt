I can hear it in your voice I can see it in your eyes
I can smell it in the air I can hear it in your sighs
The way you look at me and the way that you act
The way you make me feel I have to react
Is it beautiful enough to keep you begging for more
It's painful to see I can't take it any more
I know what it is I can see it in my dreams
I know what it's like I know what it means
I can make it go away I can make it disappear
I can make it right I can make it happen here
Feels like I have to do it it has to be done
It's time to get it over with it's useless to run
It could have been something nice you said to me
But I can hear it in your voice you just pity me
You make fun out of me and every word that I say
And I can hear you laugh when I walk away
So don't try to be nice and don't you try to pretend
You don't know who I am I'm not your friend
You don't think I know but I can read between the lines
Don't smile I'm not your clown I can see all the signs
Nobody knows it and nobody can see
I'm not talking to you but you're smiling at me
I know it's gonna happen but I don't know when
But it's happened before and it can happen again
I want to do things to you that you'll never forget
It's not an empty threat you deserve what you get
