It's funny how my title puts me in a position
Where I'm allowed to say I represent the opposition
Like I'm on a mission to overthrow the government
As if my ambition was to try and seem intelligent
I'm not even competent enough to win an argument
Or ignorant enough to be a little disobedient
But I still believe that what I say can make a difference
The problem is I can't hear what I'm sung from a distance

No matter what I say, no matter what I do
No matter what I think, I'm not as good as you

I'm such a hypocrite, I'm so full of it
I'm such a hypocrite, I need another hit

It's funny how I come across as some kind of a teacher
Considering I never even liked my fucking teachers
Now it's reached the point where all the expectations
Are building up a barrier creating limitations
While you're debating if I've got the right to an opinion
Well silly me I thought I was allowed to be civilian
All I ever did was say exactly what I'm feeling
Without filtering my thoughts to make myself appealing

[Chorus]
