You treat me like I'm fucking useless, what makes you think I even care
I think this whole affair is fruitless and it won't lead to anywhere

I never said you had to like me, I never shoved shit down your throat
But you still act like you're above me, with all that heartless crap you wrote

You try to suffocate me, you try to violate me
You try to fill me full with all your dirty lies
You try to ridicule me, but I won't let you fool me
Cos' you're so pitiful and easy to despise

What have you done that might impress me, I can't think of anything at all
Don't even want you to address me, it's not as if you make the calls

You compensate your lack of talent, talentlessly slagging what you hate
How does it feel to kill a debutante, so you can put food on your plate?

[Chorus]

I don't know how to rate a failure, so I got nothing more to say
And I'm so sick of your behaviour, so watch me when I walk away

You try to suffocate me, you try to violate me
You try to fill me full with all your dirty lies
You try to ridicule me, but I won't let you fool me
Cos' you're so pitiful and easy to despise  X 2
