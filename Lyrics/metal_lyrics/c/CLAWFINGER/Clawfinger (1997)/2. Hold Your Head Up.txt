Burn your bridges, bite your tongue
Dig your own grave, what's done is done
What's in your head, what's on your mind
Time will tell don't look behind
What I keep inside my head is stuck right on my mind
And time will tell if I should look behind

Hold your head up, hold your head up high
Hold your head up, hold your head up high
Hold your head up, put up or shut up

Two steps forward and one step back
The time will come when you loose track
Speak your mind or sell your soul
Stand tall or fall down in a hole
I've got to speak my mind before I sell my soul
I've got to stand for what I am before I fall

It's too late I guess what's done is done
I'd rather dig myself a grave than bite my tongue
So I take two steps forward and then one step back
I'm not afraid of loosing faith, I'm scared of loosing track
