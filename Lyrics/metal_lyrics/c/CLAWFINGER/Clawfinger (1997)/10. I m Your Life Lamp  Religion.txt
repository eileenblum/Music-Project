I know the answers to the questions in your mind
I've been to the places that you couldn't even find
I seen all the things you never thought you'd get to see
I've been everyone you couldn't be
I've read all the stories and I know how they end
I've fixed all the broken things that you couldn't mend
I've taken all the chances what you never even took
And I've found the things you overlooked

I'm the answer to your questions, I'm belief when you're in doubt
I'm based on a rumor, I'm spread by word of mouth
there's no proof of my existence I'm the myth that you arouse

I'm your life and religion, your faith and your hope
Your drug and your addiction, your injection of dope

I've meet all the people that you never dared to meet
I've played all the games of life and never once been beat
I've walked upon the water without even getting wet
And there's not a thing that I regret
I've done everything that's wrong and made it right again
I've talked to all my enemies and turned them into friends
I've been crucified and resurrected from the dead
Do you believe a single word I've said?

I'm the answer to your questions, I'm belief when you're in doubt
I'm based on a rumor, I'm spread by word of mouth
there's no proof of my existence I'm the myth that you arouse

I'm your life and religion, your faith and your hope
Your drug and your addiction, your injection of dope

I'm everywhere and nowhere I'm your savior when you sin
I'm your great escape to higher ground when you give in
I'm everybody's scapegoat I'm a glimpse of clarity
Would you sacrifice yourself for me?
