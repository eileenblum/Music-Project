How come all things you say just don't make sense to me
Why do we spend so much time just refusing to agree
If you say you like something you know I'll say I don't
And when you want to do something that's fun you know I won't
Why is it always my turn to take care of this mess
I don't think it's fair to say I'm always doing less
You don't know what I do so I don't think you should moan
And if you're so much better you can do it on your own

Nobody likes me like I do, not even you
Nobody needs me the way I do, not even you
Nobody knows what I'm going through, not even you

You always make me feel like everything I do is wrong
And things would be much easier if we could get along
But every time I criticize you, you over react
Please don't tell me one more time that opposites attract
That has to be the biggest fucking lie I've ever heard
Don't tell me to shout my mouth I haven't said a word
You're the one that started it and you know that I know
So what's the use there's no excuse you know that no means no

Is there really any point in working this all out
All we ever do these days is fight and scream and shout
Maybe we should give it up and just call it a day
I can't think of anything I even want to say
I've done my share of caring and it isn't any good
I'm sick and tired of feeling like I've been misunderstood
So give me one good reason and I'll stay night here with you
I can't take another day I don't know what to do
