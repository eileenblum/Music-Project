Are you satisfied with everything the way it is
Are you stuck in the conformity of minding your own biz
Does a confrontation make you want to turn and run
And do you think about the things you like to have undone
Are you scared of looking back at all the things you've said?
And do you keep the words you'd like to say inside your head
Well nothing changes by itself without some kind of clash
And there's always gonna be some barriers to smash

Are you scared to be, scared of what you see
Are you scared to change, scared to rearrange
There's a chance that you never take the chances you get

If you never move ahead you'll keep on looking back
The only thing you're doing is just filling out the cracks
Another coat of artificial paint won't change a thing
Unless the whole foundation gets a brand new coloring
What is there to lose except some insecurity
That you replace with faith to not be scared of what you see
'cos every little risk you take breaks down another wall
The biggest chance that you can take is just to let it fall

Are you scared to be, scared of what you see
Are you scared to change, scared to rearrange
There's a chance that you never take the chances you get
There's a chance you haven't taken any chances yet
