Lets all pretend that we're stupid and dumb
And that nobody knows where it's all coming from
I've got a whole lot of questions that I'm never gonna ask
I don't want to know what's behind your mask
I've got a life of my own it's hard enough as it's
Without having to listen to your personal biz
If we all keep quiet it could be ideal
'Cos I don't want to know how you feel

Nobody, nobody knows
Nobody shows it if nobody knows it
Nobody, nobody knows
Nobody knows it, until you expose it
Nobody, nobody knows
So don't open your mouth if you don't know how to close it

It's a god damn pity I don't know what the use is
For all of your good for nothing lame excuses
It's complicated makes me frustrated
Brings everything out of me you've always hated
Instead of pretending that we always agree
Why don't you just tell me what you think about me
Because we all want to leave but nobody wants to go
'Cos everybody knows we all know

Everybody knows what I'm talking about
All the little white secrets that never come out
All the things that we do and the things that we say
In this stupid little game called life we play
I don't want to hurt you so I don't want to know
What you're thinking about and where you're going to go
I don't want to stick my nose in anybody's affairs
I don't want to know and who cares
