I thought I knew you, it only goes to show that I was wrong, so wrong
I see right through you, and everything we used to have is gone, it's all
gone
You said you loved me, but did you mean a word of what you said, when you
said
you're thinking of me, I'm sure that someone else was in your bed, getting
head

I'll tell you what, love is just a four letter word
like it or not, love is just a four letter word

You say it's over and treat me like you don't know who I am, who I am
I hope you know girl, that you've turned me into a broken man, yes I am
and then you tell me, tell me that you've found somebody new, well good for
you
but do you really, think I care about the things you do , fuck both of you

I'll tell you what, love is just a four letter word
like it or not, love is just a four letter word

So now you've left me, I bet that you could hardly even wait
I used to love you, now you're just the girl I love to hate
All I can say is, I wish I'd listened to my own advice
I learned the hard way, that you we're cold as ice

so thanx alot, love is just a four letter word
like it or not, love is just a four letter word
