The money, the power, the glory

It's the survival of the fittest, the toughest, the meanest the slickest
When the shit hits the fan then we'll see who's leanest, the quickest
We'll witness the vultures when they begin the fighting &amp; the feasting
there's a piece of a beast in us all that we're afraid of just releasing
there's no rhyme or reason when our instincts are awoken
the borders are broken, suddenly the truth is spoken
Survival of the fittest, the toughest, the meanest the slickest

We're all in it for
THE MONEY THE POWER, THE POWER THE GLORY,
THE GLORY THE FAME, IT'S THE SAME OLD STORY

Break all of the rules neccessary to win the competition
Fake your place in the ratrace and then try to take the pole position
the mission is simply to make sure you that you get all your chances
So make no mistakes and make sure that nobody else advances
make your way to the top by any means necessary
and carry on until your enemies are dead &amp; buried
the greed is what feeds us every time we plant the seed
it's the root of all the evil but we take what we need
Survival of the fittest, the toughest, the meanest the slickest

[Chorus]

We're all looking for the power, the money &amp; the glory
and the story never stops we like to kill for territory
It's better safe than sorry, watch your back this is a war
A sneak attack, a payback, they've got a foot in the door
So be sure to be secure or be sure to draw blood
we're all down in the dirt dragging our names through the mud
what we won't do for love, we do for money and fame
in this game the main aim is to make yourself a name for.....

[Chorus]
