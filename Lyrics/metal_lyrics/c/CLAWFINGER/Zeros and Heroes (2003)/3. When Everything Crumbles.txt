It all happened right in front of my eyes
it took me one second and then I realized
What can I do, at which end do I start
Do I follow my brain or just go with my heart
what can I say without making it worse
should I wait and watch or should I go head first?

what do we do when sanity crumbles
How do we handle the threat
How do we act when dignity stumbles
How do we live with regret

No time to think, either I act or I walk
should I go inbetween or just try to talk
The longer I wait the worse everything gets
and the verbal abuse turns into fysical threats

[Chorus x 2]

It all happened right in front of my eyes
it took me one second and then I realized
if I don't react, next time it might be me
What can I do, at which end do I start
Do I follow my brain or just go with my heart
should I walk on by and pretend that I didn't see?

[Chorus]
