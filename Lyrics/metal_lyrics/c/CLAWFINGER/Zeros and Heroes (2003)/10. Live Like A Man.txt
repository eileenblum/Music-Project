I was raised in the name of the constitution
I believe in Jesus Christ but not in evolution
for my family and country I would go to war
to serve and protect us from the evil that
infects us to the core, that's what I'm fighting for

You've got to live like a man or die like a coward
live like a coward or die like a man x 2

My duty to serve my god and my nation
will guide me on my way to salvataion
I've got my god given right to defend my freedom
better safe than sorry is the slogan when I beat
them to secure, what I'm fighting for

[Chorus]

if maintaining the peace
means fighting the beast
then I'm surely prepared to die
because a man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do and
I know that god's on my side

[Chorus]
