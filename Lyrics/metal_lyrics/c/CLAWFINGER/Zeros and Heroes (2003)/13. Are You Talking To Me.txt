[Bonus track]

Are you talking to me, I didn't hear what you said
Was that a word in your mouth, was that a thought in your head

Are you moving your lips, I can't hear any words
have you got something to say, was that a noise I heard
I still can't hear your voice, do you think I'm all ears
could you talk a little louder, cos' I still can't hear

Are you talking to me [x 3]
There's no one else here you must be talking to me

Don't raise your voice at me, do you think that I'm deaf
there's no reason to scream, why don't you save your breathe
I heard the first time round, it's fucking greek to me
what comes out of your mouth, is like a piss in the sea

[Chorus]

You're just wasting my time, there's nothing good in you
going from bad to worse, is the best you can do
with your head up your ass, you're just a bad excuse
you don't say what you mean, so what's the fucking use?

[Chorus]
