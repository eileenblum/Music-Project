What the hell is wrong with you have you lost your mind
you know we never go out this late
You're making me look stupid and now I'm feeling mad
it must have been something you ate

I used to love you but now I'm not so sure
There's something about your whole attitude
I've got this feeling eatin' straight through my brain
all you ever think about is food

But you're still my bitch

Everytime we go out for a walk in the park
you're always barking up the wrong tree
Now you just want attention from the opposite sex
I know that you're just using me

Sometimes when you get angry you show me your teeth
but I know your bark is worse than your bite
and then when you get hungry it's a whole different deal
you act like everything is alright

But you're still my bitch

You always try to play those tricks with my mind
but bitch I know a trick or two
for everytime you try to make me loosen your leash
you know I'll have to punish you

You look at me and throw yourself at me feet
hoping I might pat you on the back
but I'm not gonna go there, I won't fall for that
not until you cut me some slack

But you're still my bitch
