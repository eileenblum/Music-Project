New crimes come with new treasures
new times call for new measures
new dreams come with new let downs
lost games come with new rebounds

new love comes with new losses
new faith comes with new crosses
new cash comes with new winnings
new life comes with new beginnings

where can we go from here?
where the fuck can we go from here?
where can we go from here?
where the fuck can we go from here?

new signs come with new warnings
new walls come with new morning
new laws come with new leaders
new lies come with new decievers

where can we go from here?
where the fuck can we go from here?
where can we go from here?
where the fuck can we go from here?
where can we go from here?
where the fuck can we go from here?
where can we go from here?

where do we go from here [4x]

it's a part of the game part of the gamble
we go we left this handles
screw you're hand with you're lucky strokes
and the loosing street coming up with stakes
can you reach the P
speak you're mouth co's we are sure what everybodys gonna do
what a dirty work for you
the winning to winning or you choose to loose
when you wanna be just a days news

where can we go from here?
where the fuck can we go from here?

where the fuck can we go from here?
where can we go from here?
where the fuck can we go from here?
where can we go from here?
