I can't say I've been saved after all of my sessions
Despite having dealt with my faults and depressions
A lesson's been learned though it taught me to listen
To all of the thoughts I've been busy dismissin'
I'm still dealing with feelings of under achieving
And I've always had issues when it comes to believing
They say time is healing you forgive and forget
But it just doesn't feel like I've gotten there yet

I'm creeping, I'm crawling
I'm screaming, I'm calling
I'm climbing the walls but I'm falling

I've made mistakes and I've learned a few lessons
And I've come to terms with a few strange obsessions
Cos we all have our issues that we need to take care of
The less appropriate sides we're not always aware of
I crawl back in my shell each time I take a beating
Think positive thoughts is what I keep on repeating
I'm learning to deal with the cards I've been given
Cos my confidence fails me the further I'm driven

I'm creeping, I'm crawling
I'm screaming, I'm calling
I'm climbing the walls but I'm falling
