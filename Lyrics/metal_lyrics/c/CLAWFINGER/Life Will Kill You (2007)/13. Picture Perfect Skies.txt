[Bonus Track]

if you're looking for some kind of answer
if you're searching for some kind of clue
if you're looking for some kind of guidance
well there's nothing i can do for you
you can draw your own conclusions
that's the way you wanna draw the line
i was hoping that you could come up with your own solutions
that would be just as good as mine

ask me no questions
i won't tell you lies
i can't paint picture perfect skies

ask me no questions
and i won't tell you lies
i can't paint picture perfect skies

if you're waiting for my final verdict
and you're working on the masterplan
but you seem to be heading in the wrong direction
well i'm sorry but i'm not your man
so you better make your own judgements
based on everything you believe
and i'm sure that you could come up with an resolution
that will get you what you need

ask me no questions
i won't tell you lies
i can't paint picture perfect skies

ask me no questions
and i won't tell you lies
i can't paint picture perfect skies

there's no happy ending
there's no perfect life
there's no given answer
there's no good advice
you win some and you lose some
just learn to live with it
just roll with all the punches
and deal with your own shit

ask me no questions
i won't tell you lies
i can't paint picture perfect skies

ask me no questions
and i won't tell you lies
i can't paint picture perfect skies
