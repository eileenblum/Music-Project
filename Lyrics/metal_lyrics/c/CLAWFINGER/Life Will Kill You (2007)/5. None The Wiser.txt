you want a piece of the cake it's not yours for the taking,
you make a hen out of a feather with the proof that you're faking,
you play your cards like you're sitting on all of the aces,
but you don't even know what a real poker face is

you take what you can get from what's left on the table,
you make facts out of fiction based on rumours and fables,
you're waiting for a chance to get a share of what they created,
you want a foot in the door when history's in the making

you're chasing waterfalls to make your way upstream,
you're eating sleeping pills to reach your highest dreams,
your mediocracy takes you to new extremes,
you're two times bitter but you're none the wiser

you never participate in the collective agreements,
but take credit where you can for other peoples achievements,
then you break down and cry when all your great expectations,
are pulled from under your feet and turn into desperation

you're chasing waterfalls to make your way upstream,
you're eating sleeping pills to reach your highest dreams,
your mediocracy takes you to new extremes,
you're two times bitter but you're none the wiser

where can you go,
what can you say,
who can you turn to,
to get it into your head ?
