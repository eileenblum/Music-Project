you can't escape life just because you stopped living
but you're dead the same second you decide to just give in
and given the choice between your own life and death
i suggest that you cherish the time you have left
cos time waits for no one and we're all growing older
i've found myself looking more over my shoulder
i like to say fuck it i could be dead tomorrow
and deal with the stress the pain and the sorrow

life will kill you
in the end we're all gonna die
life will kill you
it doesn't matter how hard you try
life will kill you
even if you don't give a damn
what part of your own death that you don't understand

death comes in all sizes all shapes and all colours
but we like to believe that it only happens to others
the closer we get we try to avoid it
we've tampered with nature so much we've destroyed it
it slips through our fingers the more we live
what the fuck are we thinking acting like we control it
it's a cold fact of life but we should try to be brave
how brave can you be with one foot in the grave

life will kill you
in the end we're all gonna die
life will kill you
it doesn't matter who hard you try
life will kill you
even if you don't give a damn
what part of your own death that you don't understand

life will kill you [x5]

it's all a part of the great big plan
life will kill you
even if you're in a rock and roll band
life will kill you
so you might as well enjoy each breath
and now you're three minutes closer to death
