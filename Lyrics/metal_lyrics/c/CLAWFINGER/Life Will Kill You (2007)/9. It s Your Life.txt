It's your life, it's in the making
Grab a slice, it's all for the taking, 'cause it's
Fast fun and it's
Cheap tricks, it all depends on how you get your kicks

[Chorus:]
You want it, you need it, you get it and then
You loose it, you win it, you bin it, you truce it,
You love it, you hate it, you give it and then
You take it, you live it, you leave it and break it.
Steal the moment and enjoy the game of life,
Make the most of where you are right now!
Get your act straight - make priorities in life,
Be here now, piece it together somehow - cause it's your life!

It's your race from the beginning,
Set the pace make sure that you winning, 'cause it's
Be first or it's be nothing, so do what it takes, even if it means bluffing.

[Chorus (2x):]
You want it, you need it, you get it and then
You loose it, you win it, you bin it, you truce it,
You love it, you hate it, you give it and then
You take it, you live it, you leave it and break it.
Steal the moment and enjoy the game of life,
Make the most of where you are right now!
Get your act straight - make priorities in life,
Be here now, piece it together somehow - cause it's your life!
It's your life!!!
