It's the payoff the reward
The release from all the tension
The biggest wise in my life and it adds a new dimension
It's the beauty and the beast
It's my fall and it's my saviour
A good excuse for self abuse the changed my behaviour
I love it and I loath it with a passion that's superior
It fucks with my emotions and it makes me feel interior
It breaks me down and then builds up a wonderful illusion
That brings out my emotions and adds to the confusion
It's not a problem I can do just fine without it
But I wouldn't chance it that's the fucked up thing about it
It pulls me in and spits me out without a secong warning
It puts me right out in the cold
While it's busy warming
It's a hopeless competition and there's no way I can win it
But I never tend to see the signs while I'm stuck right in it
I play the game and lose the game
There's no way to avoid it
Cos I'm too busy fucking up pretending I've I've enjoyed it

The cure and the poison
The loss and the gain
Escaping once again
The cause and solution
The pleasure and pain
All run through my veins

All I need is just one more I promise I'll be fine
It's really just a harmless way for me to kill some time
I'll sit back and lose my track and work hard on a case
It helps me blur out all the sharpest edges in this place
It's always gets the best of me while being etnertaining
But in the end there's not a single ounce of sense remaining
I scrape myself up off the floor and mend the broken pieces
And do it all again the vicious cycle never ceases

The cure and the poison
The loss and the gain
Escaping once again
The cause and solution
The pleasure and pain
All run through my veins
