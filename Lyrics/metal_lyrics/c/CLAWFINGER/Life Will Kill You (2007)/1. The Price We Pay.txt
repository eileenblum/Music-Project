things never seem to go according to plan
so we always end up compromising
we're not smart enough to have a plan B at hand
so we always end up improvising
it's killing us to settle with the cards we get
when we know there's much more at stake
but giving in to pressure is the safest bet
and it's also our biggest mistake

that's the price we pay [x8]

we never asked to be put into this position
we never had high demands
we never claimed to be on some kind of mission
like we had some kind of master plan
it's not as if we know exactly what we came for
so we settle for what comes our way
we're always unprepared for the final encore
what the fuck are we supposed to say

that's the price we pay [x8]

every rule we break every move we fake
that's the price we pay [x3]
