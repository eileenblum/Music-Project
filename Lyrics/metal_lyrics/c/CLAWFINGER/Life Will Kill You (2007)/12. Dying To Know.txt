[Bonus Track]

my own death becomes me
i'm a victim of my device
i haven't got enough clarity
to dwell upon the afterlife
the need to have the patience
and i don't wanna wait in vain
so i set up for the simple logic
that only my bones remain

i'm not dying to know
and you're not living to tell me

i'm not dying to know
and we're not gonna find out
until it's time to go

i can't rely on a theory
so i might as well expect the worst
which is just like questioning
which of the chicken or the egg came first
it doesn't make an difference
and i'll be dead before i find out
for that reason i can't give you
the benefit of the doubt

i'm not dying to know
and you're not living to tell me [x2]

i'm not dying to know
and we're not gonna find out
until it's time to go

if your life's that precious
then what's the fuss about
i don't care what's in store for me
so you can count me out

i'm not dying to know
and you're not living to tell me [x2]

i'm not dying to know
and we're not gonna find out
until it's time to go
