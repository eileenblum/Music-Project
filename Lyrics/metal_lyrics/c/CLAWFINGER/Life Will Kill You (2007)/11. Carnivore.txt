Give me a reason
iÂ´ll give you good advice
Consider all the options
and think it over twice
the perfect execution
has got to be well planned
get yourself the right tools
and wash those dirty hands

fast and painless
sharp and stainless
creatures always have to die
fast and painless
hard and shameless
no remorse make sure they fry
carnivore until i die

don't think it's over
once the work is done
throw away the skin and bones
and wipe away the crumbs
invite you're friends
lay it up and hope that they can't tell
if no one smells the difference
you know that it's done well

fast and painless
sharp and stainless
creatures always have to die
fast and painless
hard and shameless
no remorse make sure they fry
fast and plainless
sharp and stainless
creatures always have to die
carnivore until i die

don't forget to watch the clock
that's a big mistake
the more severe the damage is
the less you can escape
regrets are fucking pointless
once it's overdone
the last advice i give you
is don't tell anyone

fast and painless
sharp and stainless
creatures always have to die
fast and painless
hard and shameless
no remorse make sure they fry
fast and painless
sharp and stainless
creatures always have to die
fast and painless
hard and shameless
no remorse make sure they fry
creatures always have to die
