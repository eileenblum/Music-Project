All my disillusions are filling up my head
And all of my frustrations are lying in your bed
All my explanations just don't make any sense
Leave me be babe can't you see the tensions to immense
You just can't understand me so you drag me to the ground
But I don't hear a single word
You just can't bring me down
So don't you dare to criticize the way I think and live
All you get is what I've got and all I want to give

I love you I hate you I kiss you I rape you
I cheat and deceive you I leave you
I love you I hate you I kiss you I rape you
And I cheat and deceive but I need you
And I cheat and deceive but I need you

You say you really need me and then you close the door
You say you want to leave me and then you beg for more
Well I ain't sentimental so don't try to set a trap
Cos everytime you hug me you stab me in the back
If you want my body then just make love to my mind
And don't you try to hurt me cos I ain't the hurting kind
I told you that I loved you but you didn't care at all
I needed you to touch me but instead you crushed my balls

I love you ....

I know I said I need you but that was just a lie
You asked me if I loved you but you never asked me why
So now you've got your answer and I hope you're satisfied
And don't you dare to tell me that you ever even tried
There's nothing I can give you that you ain't already got
Cos even when you've got it all you say that I forgot
To give you all my loving and to give you all my time
There's ain't enough for the both of us and right now I want mine

I love you ....
