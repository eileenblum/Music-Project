With a numbing illusion of thought,
Immersion into the obscene,
An unyielding pollution of mind,
When perversion is what you believe.

Haunted by the chatter of unceasing triviality.
Human weakness, savage sexuality.
Caught beneath conscience compulsive unconsciousness.
Sensory saturation.

How can we reconcile
The tenets of morality
With spiritual innocence
And gluttonous apathy?

As the dawn rises up from the sea,
The shadow of shame will not cease to be.

Haunted by the chatter of unceasing triviality.
Human weakness, savage sexuality.
Caught beneath conscience compulsive unconsciousness,
Sensory saturationâ¦ and then itâs done.
