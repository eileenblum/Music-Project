Like a sickness it creeps across everything. Devouring devotions and
feelings that bind. A drug that kills slowly not touching the body.
Freedom in your hand where the life is confined.

Give me peace in flames.
Call me by no names.
Bow before my feet.
Your life becomes me.

Like an animal it breathes and sees with eyes deep in shadows and steel.
Gives pleasure to those that deceive it; a love that endures for what is unreal.

Give me peace in flames.
Call me by no names.
Bow before my feet.
Your life becomes me.

The only light is in me. Conquer strength with lustful kill. Invading through
thoughts and dreams. My own blood is dry.
