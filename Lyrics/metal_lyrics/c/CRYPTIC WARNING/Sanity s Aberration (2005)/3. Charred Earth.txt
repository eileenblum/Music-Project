Exterminate the human race
Kill them all, end disgrace
And in the end, before itâs through,
Donât forget to kill me too.

Burn the world âtil all is ash.
Mankind now breathes its final gasp.
Ignorance caused our demise.
Thereâs nothing left. All hope has died.

Charred earth.
Rebirth.
