No. I wonât go.
The abyss is calling me.
What has caused this aberration of my sanity?
Trapped inside this chaotic realm,
My mind is my own torture cell.

My mind is reeling
From the thought
That this blackness spewing
Comes from my heart.

Dehumanized and scorned; twisted by self-abuse;
Is this reality or is this a dream?
Now the darkness beckons me.

My skin is bursting,
An anguished cry
Escapes from my throat,
Doomed to die

As the portal opensâ¦
