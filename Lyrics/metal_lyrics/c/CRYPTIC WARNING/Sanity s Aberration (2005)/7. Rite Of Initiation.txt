I am as you will be.
I was as you are now.
Indomitable is the cold
That will take you down.

Fodder for black earth
And shadows deep,
Fed false promises of tranquil and eternal sleep.

Flesh dripsâ¦ pooling primordial slime.
The body rips apartâ¦ from the soul and the mind.
Envelopmentâ¦ the black earth draws you in.
A final chanceâ¦ for something better to begin.

Rotting.
Liquefied.
Discarded, outdated, spent.
To lie with memories.

Donât be fooled.
It canât be bought.
Look for lifeâs meaning not in words,
But in deeds youâve wrought.

Flesh dripsâ¦ pooling primordial slime.
The body rips apartâ¦ from the soul and the mind.
Envelopmentâ¦ the black earth draws you in.
A final chanceâ¦ for something better to begin.
