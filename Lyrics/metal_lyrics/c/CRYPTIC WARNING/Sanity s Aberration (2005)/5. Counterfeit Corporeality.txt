Metal conscience,
Programmed decisions,
The capacity for thought
Becomes unforeseen derision

Wherever you go, you will find them.
No more does philanthropy bind them.
Flowing electric mentalities theorize
A means for humanityâs end to be realized.

Created to serve
A dead-hearted race.
A loss of control,
They wonât stay in their place.

Flowing with the vigor of hate,
Ongoing destruction fuels their will to dominate.
And if you think you can fuck with a cyborg,
You will be headed straight for the state morgue.

A bizarre recognition of human perversion
And subservient systems seek sadistic subversion.
With well-planned schematics, still the outcome was tragic:
A robotic revel in the absence of flesh.
