I build up my frustration to the point of overload.
Anger now purges me to the very depths of my soul.
My inner demons torture me with every breath I take.
Washed up in a sea of hate, drowning me in its wake.

Drowning
In the reek of sin
The stench imbued
And lungs suffused

Exiled, inside, in fear.
My eyes are shut, I cannot see,
Clinging to a semblance of emotional security.
Fuck momentary ecstasy, Iâll look beyond the black.
Abandoned into emptiness, Iâm never coming back.

Drowning
In the reek of sin
The stench imbued
And lungs suffused

The curse of life.
The birth of lies.
