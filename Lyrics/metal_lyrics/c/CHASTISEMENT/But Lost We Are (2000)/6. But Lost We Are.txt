[Music - Chastisement, Lyrics - Marcus]

Creator what is this / look at me all my dreams are ceased / hopeful dreams 
i have dreamt for you who are here in the mist / in my eyes it is pure 
divinity / set me down oh faithful one / i bow to thee / oh greatful one / 
rise and shine you fairytale / lost in time we end our way / but lost we are 
/ our life is a breeze a tale a dream a drop into a line of time / a minute 
shivers from the rainbow / breaks and fall the dream complete / set me down 
oh faithful one / i bow to thee / oh greatful one / rise and shine you 
fairytale / lost in time we end our way / but lost we are / all my dreams 
are lost are gone are dead / are falling through a flame of fire / rise and 
shine the tale survived / but lost we are forever gone / no longer seen
