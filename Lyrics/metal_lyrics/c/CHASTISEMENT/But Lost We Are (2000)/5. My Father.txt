[Music - Chastisement, Lyrics - Johan]

Instead of inherited stupidity i gained a fresh gasp of humanity / the 
angels they turned on me as i fed my only need / my father spoke to me / he 
told me not to be / as i walked his left-hand path i soon felt his wrath / 
but i as i really don't give a damn / in a world full of love / there could 
be only one / he told me: kneel before me / do not feel!
