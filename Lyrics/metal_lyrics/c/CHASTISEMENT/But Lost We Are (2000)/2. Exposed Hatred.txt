[Music - Tommy, Lyrics - Johan, Per]

What kind of man would do such a terrible thing and for what reason i ask 
myself / my oasis of love transformed into a burning inferno a chaos / 
twittering of birds replaced by vultures frenetic laughter pierces my brain 
/ coals of fire lies beneath my feet / the stench makes my mind go furious 
black / exposed hatred / preventing hatred to fill my eyes i turn my back to 
this madness / walking towards the horizon armed with only faith / i'm 
determined to seek and destroy them who cruelly quenced the source to my 
now! Exposed hatred
