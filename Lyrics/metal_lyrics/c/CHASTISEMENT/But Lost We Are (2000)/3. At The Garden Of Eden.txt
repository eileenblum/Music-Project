[Music - Chastisement, Lyrics - Johan]

The little dark ones / dancing and laughing inside my veins / screaming and 
gasping / from the inside they're chewing my heart / insanity is near / i do 
not dear to cast myself into the flame of neverending fear and pain / i 
could not breathe could not see / could not feel / if i open up i'll see / 
take away take it away / leave me alone / talk to me / if you open up the 
gates to hell you will see nothing by death remains / i will perish alone 
you'll stand / the more you breathe the more you'll choke / you'll be lit / 
a scorching flame surrounding your body surrounding your mind / the worms 
will chew upon your eyes / blinded by hate you'll scream in pain / the worms 
will chew upon your eyes as you'll hear thousands of cries as they all are 
fried
