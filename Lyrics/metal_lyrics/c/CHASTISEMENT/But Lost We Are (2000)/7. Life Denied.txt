[Music - Chastisement, Lyrics - Johan, Marcus]

Portal in sight / the light so bright / a carving on the sign / life denied 
/ truth to be known / no rest until it's found / a neverending sound / life 
denied / my life was a hypocrisy, i was denied to live / i took my life with 
me down to hell / life denied!
