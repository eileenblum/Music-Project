[Music - Chastisement, Lyrics - Marcus]

Walking the remains among the piles of corpses / a chance to get insane as 
you see the torment / you will find the path the one who leads to me / i 
will see you finally die young / come to me among the piles of corpses / 
come to me conclusion pain / walking the remains among the piles of corpses 
/ a chance to get insane and you will find the path
