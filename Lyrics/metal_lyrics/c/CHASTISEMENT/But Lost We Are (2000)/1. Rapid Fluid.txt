[Music - Chastisement, Lyrics - Johan]

Repulsive colors infest my brain / this will surly drive me insane / in a 
world so cruel and dark i really need a change of heart / injection of 
dreams / forgetting to feel / if only for a second / it makes me cope and 
recon / a rush so wild and free turned out to be a quest for me / in the 
passage of life i found my self hide / light or dark devine or dreadful / 
which way to go i really don't know / i chose the light it blinded me / but 
i was fooled by the man in disguise / he rolled me like a six-sided dice 
into a place best described as inner fights
