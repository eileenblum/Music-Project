A humming noice from within.
The masks fall off their faces.
Like thousands and thousands before, they know this is the core.

I will lead you to a new dawn.
Know my world of pain.
I will take away your freedom.
No! Change your way of interpreting life. You'll see the
maladjusted children. 

Parse, dissect my brain, let the sane stay chained.
Listen to this cloud of mine and I'll open your well-shut eyes.

Remoulded megalomania invalidates remorse, 
earth scarred by the progress.
Selfishness.

Take a look in the mirror, 
behold the dark reflection of your supressed desires.
A world where you can be whole, where you can find peace.

I will lead you to a new dawn.
Know my world of pain.
I will take away your freedom.
No! Change your way of interpreting life. You'll see the
maladjusted children.
