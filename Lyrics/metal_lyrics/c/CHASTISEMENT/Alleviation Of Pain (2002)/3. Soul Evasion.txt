Be! Holding myself when I'm hunting them down.
Reading my mind, connection denied.
Forget about those who were slain upon my wrath.

Samples recorded and victims painful angst.

Join me, follow and watch all of the 
restless, painful, hateful and dying.

Bypassed short circuits. Half human, controlled by remote.
Scan the surroundings, search everlastning voluntears.

Connected to a pulse generator.
Half human, half machine, converted to unknown.
Controlled by something so inhuman
Chosen and handpicked as their blood is being spilt.
Connectors attached, sensoring my flesh.
No more humans, killing spree.

Bypassed short circuits. Half human, controlled by remote.
Scan the surroundings, search everlastning voluntears.

You made me believe. What you have done to me erased my soul.

Be! Holding myself when I'm hunting them down.
Reading my mind, connection denied.
Forget about those who were slain upon my wrath.

Samples recorded and victims painful angst.

Join me, follow and watch all of the 
restless, painful, hateful and dying.

Bypassed short circuits. Half human, controlled by remote.
Scan the surroundings, search everlastning voluntears.
