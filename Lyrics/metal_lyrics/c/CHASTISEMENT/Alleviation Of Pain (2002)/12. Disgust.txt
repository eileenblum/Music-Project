I'm the dot that you never notice, bloodshed.
I'm the blade that separates filth from soul.
I'm the knife deep in your back, kneel before me.
I'm the one that cries for attack.
Behold!

The voices are closing in. 
A wall of corpses you create, for shelter, for hope.
You try to run, you try to flee, 
but on your knees you'll be when I correct the flaw of life.

You are a defect, a mistake from above. 
You make me puke, you poison the air. 
An auction of pain, the higest bidder is I.
In complete joy I would leave your remains to rot. 
I control your degree of pain.
Behold!

The voices are closing in. 
A wall of corpses you create, for shelter, for hope.
You try to run, you try to flee, 
but on your knees you'll be when I correct the flaw of life.
An abscess.

House of cards, Chastisement - bad seed

I'm condecending, I'm pain.
I'm the one, it feeds my vain.
I tear your wall, when it fall you will cease.
You are filth, you make me puke.
An abscess.

I'm the cancer that eats you alive, torture.
I'm the blade that slit your fucking veins.

You are filth, you make me puke!

The voices are closing in. 
A wall of corpses you create, for shelter, for hope.
You try to run, you try to flee, 
but on your knees you'll be when I correct the flaw of life.
