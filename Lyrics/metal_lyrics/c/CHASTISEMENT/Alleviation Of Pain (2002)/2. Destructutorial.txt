A silent tear of fear I supress.
I'm aware that high above, 
an assembly of unkown states end is near.
I raise my hands in the air 
and welcome the definite alleviation of pain.

Purify! Annihilation of mankind will occure and I smile to myself.
I look at the crowd, an unaccountable fear of the unkown. 
I can see it in their eyes.

Tear the persistant maze, end the pointless days.

Cornered by darkness a young girl I see,
her plastic friend she hugs so close, I face her and smile.
The end is near, the light is here, no need to be afraid.

Purify! Annihilation of mankind will occure and I smile to myself.

I close her eyes so she will see the point being me. 
We raise our hands together as one 
and welcome holocaust as our friend.
We will meet at the end. When death picks me I wave to the unfree. 

Tear the persistant maze, end the pointless days.
