The drip, drip, drip of blood drains me, I feel cold.
My eyes turn inside out and I can see the inside of my soul. 

My old, torn hand points in the air.
I still feel I'm aiming for you.
Out of reach, I somehow fly above.

Behind my closed eyes I see, I see the world beyond,
where I can feel your pain, where I can taste your pain.

Attack!

The greatest gift, the lie untold, the past calls.
The sign was there, now I know, the lie was I.

Behind my closed eyes I see, I see the world beyond,
where I can feel your pain, where I can taste your pain,
where I take my place in the hall of tortured souls.

My number has been picked. Stand tall and strong.
As I walk through the tormentors mind I leave my hell behind.
Feel world beyond, taste world beyond.
