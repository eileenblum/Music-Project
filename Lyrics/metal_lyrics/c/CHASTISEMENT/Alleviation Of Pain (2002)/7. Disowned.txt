The masses walk towards the oppressive warmth of the fire.
The unholy will burn and so shall I.

The elder spoke of the day and we laughted in their faces.
Now we have to pay the price.

The chapter labeled portrayal of hell has begun 
and everyone will go through sheer hell. 

We live on borrowed time. 
Those who hold the knowledge despise us, 
only flames can clean us all.

Repudiate, repudiate.
Signs, words written in beginning of time.
Repudiate, purification began.
Welcome, inhale feelings that consist of despair.
Spawn of lies spewes out seductive excuses.
Signs, words written in beginning of time.
Repudiate, purification began.
A wave of new fresh meet will swallow you and I 
and we'll pick a piece of the great undefined

We're aiming for the peak of pleasure.
We're moving towards the end and we don't hear the 
doors slam shut behind us.

The elder spoke of the day and we laughted in their faces.
Now we have to pay the price.

Repudiate, repudiate.
Signs, words written in beginning of time.
Repudiate, purification began.
Make them believe, this cure makes you pure.
Make them believe, today we all fall.
Signs, words written in beginning of time.
Repudiate, purification began.
A wave of new fresh meet will swallow you and I 
and we'll pick a piece of the great undefined
