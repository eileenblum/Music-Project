I've got the urge and soul to go
I've got the green for my juice-ride
spent time in sad machines

I've got my kicks on Orleans time
the clock went dead at zero-zero
the crowd went dead at dawn

running with my head

you got a million miles to run, you got a million miles to go
to get a ticket for the freakshow

running with my head
