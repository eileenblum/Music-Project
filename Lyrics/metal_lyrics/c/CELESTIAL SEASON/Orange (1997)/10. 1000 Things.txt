Hey now, I heard that the old song was fooling me
lay down, start throwing gifts for a while
stay down, deep inner heart feeling jealousy
Hey now, life isn't easy she said

was it anything she said?
to the skies above me now
was it anything I've heard?

welcome to the glory
could it be for all
welcome to the glory

hey now, I heard that the old land was calling me
lay down, try to remember those lies
stay down, deep inner soul feeling harmony
it is never gone, when it was something she said

was it anything she said?
to the skies above me now
was it anything I've heard?

welcome to the glory
could it be for all
welcome to the glory
