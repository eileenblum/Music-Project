Even the words came back, but I cannot rely on what they became to me
even the sounds came back, but it's hard to hear the vibes when you away
even the worst will say that I'm free to stay out in my cargo-bay
back on the sheer attack, where it comes and goes around onevery day

turn me on make me wild
come see me down there
you showed me your style there and I said 'wow'
