Here she comes see the shine of her velvet afterglow
feel the flow and the heat of the body generator
one more show through the orb of a million years
one last show another ride into the dustzone

free to run through the fields of the unseen silverbow
now I now live is easy today

if I could control myself I would leave it for tomorrow
