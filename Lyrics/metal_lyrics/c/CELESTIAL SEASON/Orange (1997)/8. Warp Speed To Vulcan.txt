Did you reload your phasers
and wipe out the neutral zone
cause were heading for Zula I
to embrace the silver shining

did you refill your lasers
and break through the cosmic tones
and bring all the stardust home
cause you're the only one and the only son
and that's OK 'cause

it's allright, we've got the sunlight
rocket to vulcan is launched tonight
I'd like to feel the burning chrome
it's allright, we've got the sunlight
rocket to vulcan is launched tonight
I'd like to see you coming home

did you swallow your ego
and rejoined the devils show
if you want it than make it so
but I just wanted you to go, go, go

did you refill your body
and blow up the fuel inside
break through the solar light
'cause your the only one and the only son
and that's OK 'cause

it's allright, we've got the sunlight
rocket to vulcan is launched tonight
I'd like to feel the burning chrome
it's allright, we've got the sunlight
rocket to vulcan is launched tonight
I'd like to see you coming home
