This is it
the last stroke ended up in dust
fear for the next one belongs to the past
I wont go there no more
I will close no more doors

fade out, fade away for good

songs from the inside exhale the lost
of the few good times we had
yet there is still more to come
there is so much more to come

fade out, fade away for good
