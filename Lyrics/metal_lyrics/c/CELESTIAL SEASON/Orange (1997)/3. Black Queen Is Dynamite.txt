Common baby touch the screen
come through the screen of my old black and white TV
I can't taste this
I can't let you

are you walking alone?
is it all in your rigid head?
all this madness you drag

now you're totally grown
but the storm in your weary head
fills the room that is not for two
not for you
not for your eyes boy

are you walking alone?
is it all in your rigid head?
all this madness your drag
