Away from this planet
Onwards to a second earth
The destination of this flight
Or is it a bad trip?

Hiding in the shadows of life
And far away from the light of doom
Passing into surreality
Into a paradise never explored before

A part you are in the chain, the chain of angels
That seek the night, the night sky

Miles, hours, lives away from here

Above azure oceans
Through landscapes of forgotten times
In mountains of mist you fly, you fall

Yeah, my child you'll come back sometime
Oh my precious, you'll come back to me
