[lyrics:Jason Kohnen]

I hear the music
sweet tunes that caress my soul
music begging for music
it woes my soul ...so...

it enchants me...
...feeding my hunger
but I'm hungry for more
...so much more..

food for the poets thought
ink for the thirsty pen
lust like the ravaging whore
bringing on her final encore

show me the notes to the music
show me the words I can't find
write me a poem that touches me
playing this song as you write...
