[by Ultravox]

we walked in the cold air
freezing breath on a window pane,
lying and waiting
the man in the dark in a picture frame,
so mystic and soulful
a voice reaching out in a piercing cry,
it stays with you until

the feeling has gone only you and I
it means nothing to me
this means nothing to me
oh, vienna

the music is weaving
haunting notes, pizzicato strings,
the rhythm is calling
alone in the night as the daylight brings,
a cool empty silence
the warmth of your hand and a cold grey sky,
it fades to the distance

the image has gone only you and I
it means nothing to me
this means nothing to me
oh, vienna

this means nothing to me
this means nothing to me
oh, vienna
