[lyrics: Stefan Ruiters]

remembering the melodies
in a room with glowing stars
with a thousand symphonies, right
I still recall a smile on the wall

not forgetting the beating on the drums
under a blood raining sky
with the roaring of thunder, okay

dancing to a thousand symphonies
my feet are off the ground
dancing to a thousand symphonies
I love transcending sounds
my feet are off the ground
I love these transcending sounds
