[Lyrics: Stefan]

together in solitude
there are no moments of
pleasure...
minds filled with sorrow
not one second of joy
dreams are out of mind
deep gloom has made you blind
dreams are out of sight
I cannot make that right
being alone with your emotions
your howling. who will hear it ?
the agony of love...
pain the ultimate pleasure
is that what he has promised ?
in darkness
you searched for light
paralysed by strangling fright
