[Lyrics: Jason]

caress your breasts so gently
I sink into a paradise of my own
the scales of love tip rapidly
in serenity...I cry
I would carve my devotion
in stone
you disgust me
though you're part of my desire
bleak...this tragedy
I crave for affection
I carve my devotion in stone
two worlds they tear me
for thou my love to be ?
pulsating...my wounded heart
I stare at the aging mirror
to this I be assuaged
with hope as my enemy
