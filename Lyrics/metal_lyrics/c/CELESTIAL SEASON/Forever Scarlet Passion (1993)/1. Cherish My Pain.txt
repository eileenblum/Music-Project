[Lyrics: Stefan]

my unbalanced soul is unleashed
pliable desires become real
in my dreams
I try in vain
to sleep on hopes and conquer
the images of despair
oh...untouched beauty..
undo my anger
cherish my pain..painless one
once my precious...now...
be regretful with my frailty
give me shelter in the darkness
and protect me from innocence
helpless am I ..am I so helpless ?
I am restless...release me...
confusing thoughts
forsaken trust
losing the grasp
falling into insanity
...but don't ignore
your weakness for me...
