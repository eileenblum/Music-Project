[Lyrics: Stefan]

in the field of my soul
i lay down and awake ?
with the knowledge
of the once forgotten
seeking harmony within myself
an afterglow of a vague memory
softly veils my demise
excelling myself in my own
...betrayal
drowned in oceans of vice
virtue is lost
exiled into the barest part
of my own nature
another afterglow of the past
now softly veils my plight
disgracefully I am the beholder
of this tragedy
condemned to be my own...
antagonist
