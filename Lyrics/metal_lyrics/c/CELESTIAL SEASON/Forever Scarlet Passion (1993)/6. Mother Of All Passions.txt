[Lyrics: Jason]

oh...how I dream...dream of you
my past anguish
fills me with temptation
so clear the memories
of our days of youth
the days of comfort in April bloom
wandering with passion
in our hearts
the scent of spring we so adored
spring sun filling souls with anguish
...with tender ripeness
let me roam with the insects
with passion and kisses
this dying dream...it fades from me
between aging roses
this crimson tear scars me face
......sadness......
it fades from me...this dying dream
fading...from...me...
the days of scarlet passion
the days that stay forever
in my heart
forever scarlet passion
the days of sensual delight
