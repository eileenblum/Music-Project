[Lyrics: Stefan]

deliverance of souls
to the eternal woe for love
floating...drifting with fragility
and build a forest of innocence
awareness of painful dreams
suffocation of the hearts
castles of pain and agony
rivers of isolation and fear
sorrow's my feeling for your life
regret my emotion for my strife
destined by reality
blessings upon fatality
extinction of remembrance
opens the fatal chapter
trees of mourning
seek the evening sky
as begging hands...the merciful
the untouchable face of despair
will appear in blistering glory
hear the howling of my thoughts
...hear it...
