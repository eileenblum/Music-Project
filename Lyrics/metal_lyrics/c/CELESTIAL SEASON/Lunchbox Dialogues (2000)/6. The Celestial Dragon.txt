breathe out, wherever she walks
the workers and whores are blinded by love
give in, 'cause when she begins
you will surrender to the precious smile, that she brings

she's open fire and rain
the stars can't complain with her at their side
just by the touch of her hand
broken young man
you will know today is the day

give it up, give it up when she's on your way...
