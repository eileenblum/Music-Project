Sharks and razors in my sleep
body's aching for some peace
how I steal for you, like I steal from you
slowly losing my believe in life

Sharks and razors digging deep
searching for a remedy
how I run for you just to run from you
slowly fading, I can't stand the sight

because I stole from you the last time and I don't want to abuse you
just a minute for your second thoughts and I'll show you I'm through with it
I've been hiding my best side from you and I don't want that anymore
now I tell you for the first time that I don't want to lose you
