long blind kiss from the beauty queen
daddy said I'm dancing on a mine
but if I ruled the world
if I was made king
watch me play for joker all the time

honesty... outshine
it breaks the mass

fear comes through with all it's hell
out here in the dark I play it cool
what do you want from me?
out here in the dark I play the fool

I'm restless in a world where all the eyes are meant to see
I'm restless in a world with all the shiny jewellery
I'm restless in a world where all the lies are meant to be

if I had a chance I would turn the world to blue
if I ruled the world I gave that world to you
