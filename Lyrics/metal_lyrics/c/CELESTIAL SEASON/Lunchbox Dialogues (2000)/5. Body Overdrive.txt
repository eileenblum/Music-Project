I've got a pocketbook for the beats in my mind
I've got a bottle of red and I drink all through the night

I've got gallons of fuel to drive me to where I like
to the north to the west, wherever it feels right

I want to step outside and watch the fire brighten
I want to ride the highway and scream into your face
that it's allright

when the spark hits the bottom
it takes me by surprise
the engine of your foolish heart is the zero train
you can't restrain and that's allright
