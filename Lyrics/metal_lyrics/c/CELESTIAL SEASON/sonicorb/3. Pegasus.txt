I never thought I could lose you
I never thought it could come
I never heard of confusion
head down with a hole in my heart

and now I'm head down, down and out again
calling back again

we had it perfect in our heads
like the feeling never ends
my lines were clearer than today

feels like I'm losing my head
I've got it all but nothing is there

calling back again
