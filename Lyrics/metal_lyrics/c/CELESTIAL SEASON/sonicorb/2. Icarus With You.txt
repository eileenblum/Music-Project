and now I fly closer
a million miles ahead and I keep falling, all over
the day slides like an orange glow in hell
but I can't tell
and you're near now, I want this, near me in my life
but we can't take this for answers and tomorrow

for me and her to say: "We're in heaven now"
we're in heaven now
falling from above, we're in heaven now
my wings will carry you away

together but alone, we're in in heaven now
everything is gone, we're in heaven now
we're in heaven now
golden feathers fade away

we didn't even try, we're gonna stay up late
we didn't even try, before the night gets on it's way

coloured eyes again, we're in heaven now
everything is gone, we're in heaven now
we're in heaven now, golden feathers fade away
