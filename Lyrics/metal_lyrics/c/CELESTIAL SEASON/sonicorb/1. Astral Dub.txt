I can be wrong, I can be wrong but something lies
the astral skies, can't get these pictures off my mind
smoking sunshine, can't get my feet back on the ground
the astral skies, they keep me rolling ... rolling high

I can be right, I can be right but something lies
the astral skies, can't get these pictures off my mind
smoking sunshine, can't get my feet back on the ground
the astral skies, they keep me rolling ... rolling high

they keep me rolling high

like if I smoked a million, we have got a mountain full of
speed
we take another one for his millions, we have got a forest
full of weed
we're smoking anything we can do, we're breathing sound into
the sky
we keep them rolling high

but that's why I keep falling
because I never thought these pictures in broken glass
could ever come again ...And now I burn

I wanna give it to you huney
