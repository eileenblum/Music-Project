I heard you're talking of innocense and self control
and all these reasons you're dying of
fear for an eye and a reach out as falling becomes part of
your day
these cold winter skies at the birth of July
I can see you're visions through this window for all the undo-
ne

I wanna take you to the passion

I can feel you breathing in waves of my own because I had this
first dance alone
and I know that a mirror wall is a hard thing to see through
as your beats are unstable
but this corner of silence, this grey eyeing nothingness
Is the best thing you have after coloured years as you become
me

I wanna take you to the passion

no one speaks at the first day of his life
no one speaks at the moment he dies
a better life in colours
the feeling cares
