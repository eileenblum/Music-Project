Twenty past nine, desires awaken
atracted by the light of your eruption
probably out of illumination
concession blind, reduce this fiction

Shake it up
don't fool me around

Sweatting for a piece of late night mixture
lust for lies under the morning sun
darling you reallly drive me crazy
so burry your pride and dig up mine

Common' and shake it up
don't fool me around
