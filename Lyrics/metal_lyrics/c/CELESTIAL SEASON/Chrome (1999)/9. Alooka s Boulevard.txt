You take it slow
maybe you've got it all under controll
just wait and see
save yourself from the ego in me
you blaim me for
every damn time that I couldn't be yours
you're killing me
now I step back, step back from your heartache

I'll dissapear
and leave you for love on a higher degree
forever free
is'nt that just what we wanted from each other

You've got it all so clear
this is the last time that I came so near
you've got it all so clear
forever tumbling down, tumbling down and running away

run from here into the dawn
