Come to the world where the sane man crawls
and drop a lot of worries there
feel delight
wrong for a while when the wind went dry
it took a minute to deny it's sad song

Come to the world where the good man saw
and grab another bottle man
flush it down
hold up your hands to the intemate crowd
"superior life... let's try it out"

Makes me crazy to agree with the reasoned crap they still proclaim
my son, come to the world where the sane went numb

I traded trust for the wrong kind of answers
made me longing for the dark
but I became one with the sparks of my own fire
and now insanity is moving out of town
ride on, I rest my case
ride on, this sadness will break
I'm living next to the restless
I'm living next door to hate
but I call it out
