Last night I went to Jupiter
and silently I stayed
until I caught the daybreak on the seventh moon
breathing in the juvenile
naked to the bone
sitting on the bottom of my soul

Open up to the sound on Celestials playground

I'm reaching out to willpower
staring at the strobe
I never thought that speed of life could kill my thoughts
trying to come clear now
my engine running slow
falling like a comet heading home

Open up to this sound
let the magic come over
and freak out
