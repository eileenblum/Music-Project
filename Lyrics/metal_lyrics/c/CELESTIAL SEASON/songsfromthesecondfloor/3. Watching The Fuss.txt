Let's get lost again in the summertime
With our heads up in the clouds
As light as a feather floating on the early morning wind
Two little birds as seen from the ground

For seven years you saw the best of me I surely made
A big effort to make you smile
You said we are gifted but born with a skin to few
But I learned to live without

And I got this feeling
That a pretty good season has come
Shake my wintercoat off
In the middle of the right and the wrong
Sitting on the rooftop
With this songs that will never fade
Just watching the fuzz
Funny how you're feelings change
