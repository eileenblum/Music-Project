We got away
Full of our expensive fantasies
We drove for hours
You wanted to dissapear
I wanted to feel some difference
Get rid of my gravity pills

We would never stop and the way you touched
Made me feel so good (no one ever would)
We would never stop and the way you touched
Made me pass out

We were afraid
Afraid that we would make the same mistakes
You're never certain
Whenever I dream of you
Whenever I dream of you today
I'm bloody happy we did

We would never stop and the way we touched
Trying to make it through
We would never stop and we dealt with our fears
But our fears had a deal with our soul
