On the day that I found I was travelling
With words too heavy
Hammering my skull
Was the day that I woke on a train
Looked around in my cabin
Heard the rhythm of the wagon
Repeating, the beating:

There's a morning on the way

When you're locked like a thief
In the poor arms of expectation
Oxygen is thin
In the middle of Spain but you're
Freezing from isolation
Get yourself together and sing:

There's a morning on the way
