Spirits unite heed the call from the call from beyond. Sense the sorrow we feel now 
that you're gone. Over the threshold you've crossed into the night lifelessly numb 
to the tunnel of light. Now we will reach the medium channels a ghost. The seance 
begins a presence enters it's host message revealing such things no one could know. 
Now here at last the closure that you needed so door to the unknown you're not alone 
Open the gate. The door to the unknown. The door is a bridge to things best left unseen.
Not from above or below caught in between. Under the archway it leads to the abyss. 
The final goodbye blessed to receive such a gift 

[Chorus]
Once it was hard to believe but nothing you've felt and nothing you've seen was like 
this unreal nightmarish dream 
[Chorus.]
