Every thing changed. This glorious land shall not be the same
Oh those things that we saw on that on one fateful day 
we stand ready to fight. Liberty guides us we follow her light
and we will carry on the American way. And the drums of the 
brave begin playing their song. The flag is being waved showing 
freedom lives on god bless the Forces of Freedom and those who 
protect God bless the US of A. From the skies we will come then 
we'll take to the ground and do what must be done. To avenge 
those we're lost they did not die in vein. Shining stars in the sky 
well there's one for each hero who gave up their lives. Their 
memories will survive heavy hearts feel the pain. And the drums of 
the brave begin playing their song. The flag is being raised showing 
Freedom lives on god bless the forces of freedom and those who 
protect god bless the U S of  A. God bless the souls of our fallen 
in peace may they rest. We will never forget that September day 
that September day god bless the U S of A.
