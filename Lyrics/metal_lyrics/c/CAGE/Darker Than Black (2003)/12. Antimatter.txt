I'd rather be left alone in you can't confide. You've made your 
intentions know you suffocate my mind. There's nothing to fear 
there's no need to hide cause the pain that I feel keeps on growing 
inside and I'm tired of you wasting my time I'm wasting my life with 
you sick of the sight of you. No feeling no laughter. You wear me 
down with antimatter. And from you I'll carry this scar. It makes me 
sick that you're the martyr that you are. You let me down time and 
time again. You're wasting my time. Within you my faith is hard to 
sustain. You're living a lie I've got to get far away from your constrict 
vice. Mistakes that I made with you will never happen twice I'm closing
you out I'm shutting you down. It's painfully clear I don't want you 
around and I'm tired of you wasting my time. I'm wasting my life with 
you sick of the sight of you

[Pre-chorus - Chorus]
Now you're face to face with your mortality victimized inside by mortality.
Face to face embrace your own mortality.
