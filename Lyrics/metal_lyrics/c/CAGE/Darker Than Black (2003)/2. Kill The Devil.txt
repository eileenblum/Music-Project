The evil one we can defeat him. Our mission make him dead and gone. 
One from each religion assembled to take him on. They would go to the 
ends of the earth and below to end the game and kill the Devil Deception 
our greatest weapon the priest in black has joined the cause hell betray 
his master and then we will strike without pause. Midnight all the power 
of light well fool the master of lies and kill the Devil [repeat]

Kill Kill the devil. The game was on midnight approaching the dark disciple 
made the call. The formless one took shape the sight of him left us in awe 

[Pre-chorus]
Now that we've got you you'll die here today. When hell freezes over you will 
stand in my way. Come hell or high water to rest you will lay. When you deal 
with the devil there will be hell to pay. Blinding light came! The evil is finally 
gone the impossible seemingly done. Still we must save ourselves from the 
evil that comes from below. The darkness still lingers within us all 
You've got to kill the Devil!
