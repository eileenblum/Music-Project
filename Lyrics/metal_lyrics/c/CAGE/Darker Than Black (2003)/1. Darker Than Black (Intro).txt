As we unlock the secrets to our universe. We have 
discovered that an all encompassing substance 
called Dark Matter threatens our very existence is 
this mysterious energy the true source of evil? 
And what small hope have we as black 
holes angrily devour our floating islands of light. 
Theory becomes reality and another cross lines 
the cosmic roadside engulfed by something.... 
DARKER THAN BLACK
