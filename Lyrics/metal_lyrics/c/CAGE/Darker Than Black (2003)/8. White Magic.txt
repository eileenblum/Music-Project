From days of Salem when the craft became alive. The Wicken way has seen
the congregation thrive. The moon and goddess of the earth a solemn face.
But soon they sought such power from a darker place. Beguiled trapped under 
their spell. Repent be tried be sent to hell. Tied to the cross the witches will burn 
alive on this night. White White magic. Turning to black. White magic turning to 
black. The Cauldron curses those the witches do despise. They will fall victim to 
their wretched evil eyes. The coven instigates the Equinoxal fire witness deliverance 
to all that they desire 

[Pre-chorus - Chorus]
They're turning to black 
[Pre-chorus - Chorus]
They're turning to black.
