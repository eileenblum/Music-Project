The world is falling down. But reaping winds reclaim the kingdom that once was a home 
to us all a memory all that remains. As we begin our approach. Their life signs begin to 
fade. Wielding the wickedness that is to come wings of destruction. Seething with anger 
to the inferno we fly. Death from above took the ones that we love now it's up to you and I. 
Legions of angels mercury red glowing eyes. Strike take the night see just how perfectly we 
pulverize. Laceration branding their nation with fire we are disguised from the enemy's eyes 
weapons that science defies incinerator blasting the buildings below burn they will turn targets 
of tyranny we overthrow. Standing mighty and tall with blinding lights and flashing flames we're 
laying waste to it all. Now we control the sky. Seizing the light of the day and ruling the night 
Nothing will stand in our way well make you fall. Strike with vengeance and spite NAIL THEM 
unleashing all of our might SLAY THEM. Let the fire fall wings of destruction well take 'em all 
feet it raining down on you domination calls wings of destructions from these hallowed halls 
we are devastating you. We ride on the wind suicidal delight. Do or die to the end. For the fallen 
we fight 

Nothing is over until that we say it's done. Vapors of death darkly billow below see how they 
blacked the sun. Silence is singing loud as your memory gone. Erased eradicate only our 
victory will carry on 
Pre-chorus chorus 

Oh the wings of the guiding light are crushing the will of them all catastrophic coming to call. 
The wings know what must be done. Our task is securely complete desolate lands of defeat. 
The wings came surgical strike maliciously mocking the slain inflict a poisonous pain.
The wings fly beyond the veil. The Reaper she rides on his back. 
Prepare for another attack.
