Tesla to. They would do what couldn't be done witnessed by few. The laws 
of science are falling. The laws of physics decay Gravity no longer holding

They're made to be broken. They're crossing the line. The rules of the game 
are made to the broken. Aboard the Elbridge they would spin magnetic fire 
to make the ship and crew disappear that was their desire. The switch was 
thrown the engines groaned a warning cry. Something had gone terribly 
wrong there was no reply 

[Pre-chorus / Chorus]
They didn't know just how transparent they would be a fate most cruel was 
suffered by those out there at the sea some bodies burst to flame and 
madness claimed the rest. Others suffered flesh within steel was this 
worth the test  

[Pre-chorus chorus]
Breaking boundaries pushing the limit never relenting where did they go. 
The fabric will tear and into thin air they're far beyond visually cloaked.
