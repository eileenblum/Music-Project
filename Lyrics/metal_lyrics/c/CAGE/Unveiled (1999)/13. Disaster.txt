[Music: Eric Horton]
[Lyrics: Sean Peck]

I ran out the door you screamed "Don't leave me!, Don't leave me!"
I simply haven't got the time there's no more time
The world is caving in soon we'll be greiving greiving
Mother nature's showing us a sign don't you see the signs
Just how very shortly will you find you're...

Caught in a disaster your heart is beating faster
You know we'll never master nature's wicked ways
Earthquakes and titlewaves hurricane or a firey blaze
You know you've seen your final days

She's overcoming such a sickly feeling a feeling
Like a virus we all multiply we multiply
She defends herself with an upheaving upheaving
A ring of fire is nature's battle line a battle line
Just how very shortly will you find you're...

Caught in a disaster your heart is beating faster
You know we'll never master nature's wicked ways
Earthquakes and titlewaves hurricane or a firey blaze
You know you've seen your final days

There was not a word no one heard a sound
Then it came and tore the world in two
There was no escape she was all around,
How I pity you

Caught in a disaster your heart is beating faster
You know we'll never master nature's wicked ways
Earthquakes and titlewaves hurricane or a firey blaze
You know you've seen your final days

You're caught in a disaster, 
You're caught in a disaster
