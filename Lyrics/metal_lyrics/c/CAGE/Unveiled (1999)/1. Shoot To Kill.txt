We ofter education
We're seeking fertile minds
Come and serve your nation

Shoot to kill your victim
Fire at will
Fire at will they say
Shoot to kill
It's a killing system
Blood will spill

You travel Such great distances as diplomats deploy
And in many instances your ordered to destroy

Shoot to kill your victim
Fire at will
Fire at will they say
Shoot to kill
It's a killing system
Blood will spill

You'll sacrifice your life
A germ a bomb or just a knife
You'll battle without fear
Dark intentions led you here
Take the land by force
Objectives just aren't clear of course
They never are in war
A constant ROAR

Shoot to kill
Fire at will
Shoot to kill
Blood will spill

They've programmed your mind so you won't disobey
They tell you it's safe but make you lead the way
Political Idiots blocking your goal
Just push a botton and sieze all control

Shoot to kill your victim
Fire at will
Fire at will they say
Shoot to kill
It's a killing system
Blood will spill
