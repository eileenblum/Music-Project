Come Inside and sit my friend
I know you wonder why I've asked you to come here again
It seems were under siege
Come now and hear my wicked tale
All that I say is true you know we surely must prevail
Here's what you have to do

Borders now are closing in
It happened once before but now it's happening again
You know we have to win
There's only one way out we know here's what I have to show
You finaly have realized I see it in you eyes

No you're never going to find a way
Out alive
No you're never going to get to say goodbye

I know you think we have a choise there is no other way
Now start by lowering your voice
Hear the words I say the time to judge has finaly come
You know what must be done
I see your faith is growing strong I've told you all along

No you're never going to find a way
Out alive
No your never going to get to say goodbye 

It all fades away why does it have to be this way
Time has come to stop the beast
You are the chosen one the one they call the Iron Priest
Disdain for the Middle East has festered in you for so long
Has made your will so strong
A time you've been preparing for another world war

Time is quickly running out I see you have your doubts
It's only natural to find the twists inside your mind
We chose you for your soul is pure you see we are quite sure
Your hesitation will be lost we all must pay the cost

No you're never going to find a way
Out alive
No your never going to get to say goodbye
