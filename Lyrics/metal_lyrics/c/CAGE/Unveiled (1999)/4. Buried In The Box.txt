[Lyrics: Sean Peck]

Well you know one time it was tenn till two
We were drinking wine we were smoking too
We had three young girls they had not one care
Well we pulled them out, you know what it's about
And I asked them where ?
They said it's

Buried in the box don't you try to blame me
Buried in the box
Buried in the box don't you try to shame me
Buried in the box

When we're kicking ass well it's n the stage
When we play real fast you know the people rage
When they hear the sound they don't know how
Cause it's so profound it's hidden underground
Let me show you now

Buried in the box
Buried in the box don't you try to blame me
Buried in the box
Buried in the box don't you try to shame me
Buried in the box

Well they don't know how they can hear the sound
If it's so damn loud we're gonna show all of you
When we hit the road we do it double time
We pack a load and hear our girlfriends whine
We don't compromise you know it's true
World to the wise you better realize
Coming straight for you

Buried in the box
Buried in the box don't you try to blame me
Buried in the box
Buried in the box don't you try to shame me
Buried in the box
