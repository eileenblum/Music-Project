[Music: Eric Horton]
[Lyrics: Sean Peck]

In the Earth's first days they came with high technology
Mutagenic lives would thrive they germinated seeds
They came unto this world with two infants to breed
The grand experiment was called Adam and Eve

Birth of a civilization becoming unveiled
Top secret classification
They cannot let religion fall

As the ages passed so little evidence remained
We turned to mysticism for the unexplained
The modern day has made the skepticism grow
When comes Millenium the world will finaly know

Birth of a civilization becoming unveiled
Top secret classification
They cannot let religion fall

They're coming back to find you you better run away
They're seeking up behind you
They're taking you away
They come down and take you up into the sky
You scream aloud "God help me!" they ask you why
You call out to a god when it's just us up here
The harsh reality consumes you with despair

Birth of a civilization becoming unveiled
Top secret classification
Now you know religion failed
It's coming unveiled
Becoming unveiled
