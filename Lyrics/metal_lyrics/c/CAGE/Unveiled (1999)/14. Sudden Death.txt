[Music: Dave Garcia]
[Lyrics: Sean Peck]

Well right now you found out what life's about
Your friends they might die and you will know why
Right now the time is arising for you to go into hiding

Beware of the path you take
Don't you run and break

They said be all you can be so you joined the army
With no direction you chose the big gun
In two years time you would be in and out you would see
The world and you'd raise the funds to get grades
All of a sudden there came a war

Beware of the path you take
Don't you run and break

We sent troops but needed more Middle Eastern crazy man
You shipped off to a foreign land
You never expected to really fight
Everything changes overnight
Your mind is one big death program
Shoot and kill the foreign man

This conflict you deal with the things you feel
Like killing you fellow man or the death of your commrade
Don't forget to save your own skin
This fight you must win if you don't you will die
The Tears in your eyes
