[Music: Dave Garcia]
[Lyrics: Sean Peck]

I come to you in many ways
I'll make sure my impression stays
See me I am the latest craze
You know my name is violence,
On you I have much influence
You have been changing ever since

Well I can rule your mind
Will you be left behind
Or will you ever find your hidden side

TV the games and headline news
Whichever channel that you choose
I'm everywhere I cannot lose
Your tolerence is getting higher,
So much more that you desire
Inside you there's a burning fire

Well I can rule your mind
Will you be left behind
Or will you ever find your hidden side

I know your mine seen the signs hear me all the time
You don't really know how the fever grows from the seeds I sow

Well I can rule your mind
Will you be left behind
Or will you ever find your hidden side

I'm here and there's no turning back, 
Are you really under attack
A brain of your own is what you lack
You need to decide your own fate
Does it effect your mental state,
No need for them to legislate

Well I can rule your mind
Will you be left behind
Or will you ever find your hidden side

I know your mine seen the signs herar me all the time
You don't really know how the fever grows from the seeds I sow
