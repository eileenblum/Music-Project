[Music: Eric Horton]
[Lyrics: Sean Peck]

The change of an age we're turning the page
We're racing towards a turbulent time
Intensity grows as conflict explodes
But they've got something in mind
The ending is near there's so much to fear
But look at people standing in line
They've gathered in droves some removing clothes
The quickening time

Re-creation of manking devastation
They're dancing around the fire
They're watching the flames get higher

The prophecies tell and some say they sell
But all encompass one common line
One huge event that's so prominent It boggles the mind
The people don't scare they're so well prepared
They're gleaming with a confident smile
They eagerly wait they anticipate a short while

Re-creation of manking, incantations while 
They're dancing around the fire
They're watching the flames get higher
They're dancing around the fire
They're dancing around the fire

I'm feeling what I see
The fire is calling me
Re-creation of mankind alien nation
They're dancing around the fire
They're watching the flames get higher
They're dancing around the fire
Oh God we're dancing around the fire
