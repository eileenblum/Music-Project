[Music: Garcia, Brogden, Peck / Lyrics: Peck]

The metal gods has spoken, with fire and light
You are been chosen, to join us tonight
Be prepared for battle or you will weep
Tonight we wake the dead to blood's deep

Up from the embers we rise, no fear on our faces
Down from the silvery skies we've taking to flight
Burning hot beams from our eyes, they'll never enslave us
Destiny dares us to die in battle tonight

Nightfall has chained the light
Summoned we are saviours
We live to fight, you all will fail
A tyrant with blackened eyes
Standing to engage us, dark battle lines

[Pre-Chorus]
I am a wrecking ball, my roar is deafening
I'll devastate you all, I'll bring a reckoning
A wrecking ball, my roar is deafening
I'll liberate you all and end your suffering

[Lead: Bitterfrost]

Bloodsteel - Bloodsteel - Bloodsteel!
Waiting for it's victim!

Power it flows through our veins like living lightning
The landscape is littered with fire as it falls from the sky
Such venomous violence and rage we are inciting
Mountains are rendered to dust in the blink of an eye

[Pre-Chorus]

[Solo: Dave]

[Chorus]
Bloodsteel - Silver and red!
Bloodsteel - Alive and dead!
Bloodsteel - Off with your head!
Waiting for it's victim!
Bloodsteel - Immortal and wise!
Bloodsteel - Saviour of lives!
Bloodsteel - The perfect device!
Save you from this prison!
Bloodsteel - Bloodsteel - Bloodsteel!
Bloodsteel - Bloodsteel - Bloodsteel!

[Solo: Bitterfrost]

Our tyranny towers forever gleaming like twilight
Oblivion swiftly surrounds the dreams of the damned

Nightfall has chained the light
Summoned we are saviours
We love to fight, you all will fail
A tyrant with blackened eyes
Standing to engage us, dark battle lines

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Bloodsteel - Bloodsteel - Bloodsteel! - Once concealed
Bloodsteel - Bloodsteel - Bloodsteel! - Now revealed
Bloodsteel - Bloodsteel - Bloodsteel! - The fallen kneel
Bloodsteel - Bloodsteel - Bloodsteel!

I am a wrecking ball!
