[Music: Garcia, McGinnis, Peck / Lyrics: Peck]

From the heart of old England
Came a force full of shattering sound
All that were living and breathing
Felt it quaking and breaking new ground
It mastered our minds and lit up our lives
With power to fight all through the night

[Pre-Chorus]
We honor those who have created this sound
We bury them deep in hallowed ground
We gather tonight to raise our fists up high
As long we are here true metal will never die
Will never die... True metal... Will never die...
True metal... Will never die... True metal...
As long we are here heavy metal will never die!

[Chorus]
All hail the supremacy of steel
Fools fail and before us they will knell
With this nail their coffins will be sealed
We're here to reclaim it
The metal empire!

They told me they buried all metal
They said heavy metal had died
We gathered this bold band of rebels
And swore we'd defend with our lives
With damaging drums and grinding guitars
We played every night with leather and spikes

[Repeat Pre-Chorus]

[Repeat Chorus]

[Solo: Steve, Dave]

Seeds of steel have been planted
Now metal stands stronger and proud
The wishes of vikings are granted
All hail the lords of the loud
Onward the spirit of metal survives
Thrashes and thrives for the rest of our lives

[Repeat Pre-Chorus]

[Repeat Chorus]

Grown men play metal!
Heavy metal!
Long live true metal!
Heavy metal!
