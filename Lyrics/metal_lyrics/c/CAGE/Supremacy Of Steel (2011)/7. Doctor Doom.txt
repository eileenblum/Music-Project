[Music: Brogden, Garcia, Peck / Lyrics: Peck]

Under the heels of the Baron
My family was hunted like dogs
My mother was slain by a demon
My father was also to fall
I spent my life with the gypsies
Evading the Baron by stealth
My keen intellect I worked to perfect
While I swindled the rich of their wealth

I went to America, studied the science
And deeply embraced the occult
My darkest desire was to break through the fire
And reach a specific result
My mother was taken her soul sold to Satan
My life for that she would be freed
I built a machine so that she could be seen
This device would be just what I need

[Chorus]
Doctor Doom is the name that strikes fear in all men
Doom will obliterate, Doom will defend
Doom is your destiny, darker than black
Doom is my name and I'm born to attack
Von Doom is the conqueror behind the mask
Kneel before Doom, don't make me ask
Doom is an intellect second to none
The king of the world, there can only be one
Doctor Doom
Doom!

Reed Richards rigged my machine
It exploded and ruined my face
I quickly took flight in the dark of the night
Awash my shame and disgrace
I went to Tibet and discovered a cult
And learned the might of their ways
I assembled my armor and menacing mask
That mirrored my bloodlust and craze

No one has ever laid eyes
Upon this hideous face
There is no one more I despise
Than the one who made me this way
I rule with an iron fist
And I'll crush all those who oppose
Armored in metal and chosen to birth
The Lord of Latveria and soon all the Earth!

[Repeat Chorus]

[Solo: Dave]

Come bring it on, I'll take them all
Defender or Avenger or the Hated Four!

[Solo: Steve, Dave]

My castle soars, my minions roar
I'll make the world my kingdom
I will reign forevermore

[Lead: Dave, Steve]

No one has ever laid eyes
Upon this hideous face
There is no one more I despise
Than the one who made me this way
I rule with an iron fist
And I'll crush all those who oppose
Armored in metal and chosen to birth
The Lord of Latveria and soon all the Earth!

[Chorus]

All hail Doom!
