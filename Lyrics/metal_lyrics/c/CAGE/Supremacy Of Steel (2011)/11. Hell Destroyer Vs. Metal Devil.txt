[Music: Garcia, Brogden, Peck / Lyrics: Peck]

Demons are dining on angels tonight
Our destiny's drowning in sin
Devil of Metal, awake and alive
Commanding the shadows again
Angels descending but losing the fight
He's swatting them out of the sky
This massive monstrosity feeds of their light
Growing five hundred feet high

Hope is but laughter in his eyes
None can stand before him
He's the sorcerer of lies

Fire is falling down from the sky
The Hell Destroyer arrives
Face to face they lock eyes

[Chorus]
Hell Destroyer!
Fight fire with fire
The blinding light
The fallen angel
The armored knight
Hell Destroyer rise!
Fight fire with fire
The blinding light
The fallen angel
The armored knight
Hell Destroyer rise!

And with a scream returned the night
He called it down enveloping this place

Face to face, hand to hand
They battled on across the land
Lightning flash, thunder roared
He amassed an evil horde
The angels that survived they held the line
It's do or die
Darkness dawned, dead of night
Blackness spread, no more light
Power drained to the dead
A place where angels fear to tread
His demons joined the fight
And turned the tide of battle
Has the Hell Destroyer died?

Hell Hell Hell Hell, raise some Hell
Where the Hell Destroyer fell
Hell Hell Hell Hell, break the spell
No more world you love so well

Burn burn burn burn burn, so bright
Flames will bake this world tonight
Hey hey hey something's not right
From above a blinding light!

Bursting with power he rose to his feet
The demons blew back in a flash
He struck the behemoth with all of his might
Buildings were crushed as he crashed
Forcing his scepter to its metal face
Absolving this cyborg of sin
It's life force and memory both were erased
We knew Hell Destroyer would win

Bolts of white lightning filled the skies
Blood stained feathers washed away
Immortals gave their lives
A battlefield of fallen angels
There'll be no afterlife for none of them

Fire is falling down from the sky
The Hell Destroyer survived
The Devil's no longer alive

[Repeat Chorus]

Hell Hell Hell Destroyer
The final destruction of Hell

And from the gleam he appeared there in the sky
For all to see and witness his return

The Metal Devil's heart is beating nevermore
His twisted body lies beneath the angel's heel
The Hell Destroyer rips its heart right from the core
The fate of evil for eternity is sealed

Up from the ground his sign it bursts into the clouds
A vision towering 1000 feet it soars
All of the angels up in Heaven sing aloud
His glory echoing goes on forevermore!
