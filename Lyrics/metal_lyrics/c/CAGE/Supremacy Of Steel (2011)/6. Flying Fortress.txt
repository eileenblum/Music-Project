[Music: McGinnis / Lyrics: Peck]

We took to the skies
And broke through the clouds on that fateful day
Into a formation we never should break
What some called the Flying Fortress
Was wings on a bulletproof cage
With 13 machine guns a crew barely of age

As we fly to enemy spaces
The air is alive with the scream of a deafening hum
Our mission is critical no price is too high to pay
Here they come...

Fighters swarming and blasting guns
From tyrants freedom must be saved
One in five won't come back alive
Glory shines upon the brave

300 Luftwaffe met us with all guns ablaze
They stood right between us
And the Messerschmitt line
Our gunners frantically followed their flight paths
Defending our planes spiralling downward
Good young men died

As the Allies are shot down in flames
Just a few of us made it our target is nearly in sight
Just a few more moments and it's bombs away...
Blasted to dust

[Chorus]
Fighters swarming and blasting guns
From tyrants freedom must be saved
One in five won't come back alive
Glory shines upon the brave
Bombers diving with few surviving
But still we will have victory
Through our sites the ground ignites
Europe finally will be free!

[Solo: Anthony McGinnis, Dave]

Just a few made it back to the base
Some crashed upon landing and others into the sea
Over 70 planes and 650 men lost...
Black Thursday

[Repeat Chorus]

[Lead: Steve]
