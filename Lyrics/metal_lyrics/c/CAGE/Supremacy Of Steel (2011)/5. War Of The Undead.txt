[Music: Garcia, Peck, Brogden / Lyrics: Peck]

The graveyards all have been emptied
The earth lies disturbed from the mist
Humanity caught in the middle
Of a pestilent paradigm shift
Breaking out from their coffins
And pouring out from the morgues
They feast upon entrails and organs
On human brains they engorge

This is a war - War of the undead!
This is a war - War of the undead!

We hid from the horror and terror
Oh how quickly it spread
They resisted all forms
Of our violent attacks
But fell from the loss of their head
As the war waned on
The world was a wasteland
A deluge of dead and decay
Humanity lies on the edge of extinction
The end growing closer each day

[Chorus]
This is a war - War of the undead!
This is a war - War of the undead!
Enlist in the war - War of the undead!
This is a war - War of the undead!

[Solo: Steve]

On the night of the harvest moon
An unnatural total eclipse
The sky rained fire, an unholy desire
A single word rang from his lips
Rise he said, rise and go forth
Take the lifeblood from all in this land
This was the first day the living
Would make its final last stand

[Solo: Dave]

Carcasses littered the streets
Carrion covered in blood
We will never give in to defeat
But how this foe can be withstood?

Oh how many lives have been taken away?
It's so insane
Lord, why have we all been forsaken today
Are we to blame?
Please Lord save us from the madness and the pain
Will we be saved?
Will we see the light of day once again
Or will they reign?
This is a war - War!

[Repeat Chorus]

This is a war!
