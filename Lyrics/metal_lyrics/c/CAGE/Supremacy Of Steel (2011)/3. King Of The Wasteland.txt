[Music: Brogden, Peck / Lyrics: Peck]

Listen to the sound of their final heartbeat
Pleading from the ground as they lie at my feet
Listen to the crowd growing louder, raging on
I walked the path alone that's the way I liked it
I kept a heart of stone just in case they'd knife it
I put the heathen down now the crown's upon my head!

Cast out of shadows and hell
I'm drawn into conflict
Evil falls from the blade of my knife
Nothing worth keeping alive
On this wretched wreck of a world
Darkness dawns on all who survived

[Pre-Chorus]
Bathe them, bathe them in fire
Bathe them in fire
And hail to the gods of twilight
Raze them all who defy us!
Those who oppose us
Will know I am the divine!

[Chorus]
Millions are calling my name
The King of the Wasteland
This tyrant was born out of pain
Sending them falling
The King of the Wasteland
My enemies rot in their graves

A madman with emerald dreams
So he decreed it
Burnt it black, extinguished all life
Out from the caves and the caverns
Only the strong could ever survive
Take it back what's left of mankind

[Repeat Pre-Chorus]

[Repeat Chorus]

[Solo: Dave, Steve]

[Repeat Chorus]

Humanity's sanity is nowhere in sight
Brutal days and hot desert nights
Cloaked and killing with speed
The wrecker's legend lives on
Take the throne, it's my very right!

[Repeat Pre-Chorus]
