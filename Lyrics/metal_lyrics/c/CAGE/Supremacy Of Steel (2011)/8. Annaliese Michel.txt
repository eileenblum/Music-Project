[Music: Garcia / Lyrics: Peck]

Hear a tale part frightening
And half the tale enlightening
A brave little girl's great sacrifice
To hold back the hordes of Hell

I was called upon to see the poor Annaliese
Back in the freezing winter of 1969
She was suffering, complaining of voices
Chains were restraining the girl to her bed
Such menacing messages
I can't believe the things she said
Fiendish faces haunting her mind
Hallucinations of the hideous kind
Her room was empty, but oh the smell from the filth
She told me stories so hard to believe
Wicked possession from six entities

[Chorus]
Why can we save poor Annaliese?
Dear tell us what's wrong
What good is calling on a priest?
Possession too strong
We need to save her from the Beast
Girl help us to fight
She's looking frail and feeling weak
A terrible sight

Doctors claiming it's all in her head
Demons draining, her face turning red
Beyond the twilight I saw the evil in her eyes
Waiting, hiding the devil inside
Changing places, I saw innocence die
Annaliese quit fighting
The entity claiming its prize
Cursing, writhing, the room came alive
Flashing a fleeting last sinister smile

[Repeat Chorus]

[Solo: Steve, Dave]

Accusations, they started to fly
Prosecution, we didn't know why
Such inhumanity I could not believe my own eyes
The exorcism, they just didn't buy
They sent us to prison for taking her life
Unburied secrets were exhumed
They could not hide the truth
They opened her coffin to see what's inside
Her corpse was still perfect
Ten years had passed by
Her body protected by the Holy Divine

[Repeat Chorus]

Her very last words to priest
Right before her release
Were "tell my mother I am not afraid"
From mother's bedroom she can see
Poor little Annaliese
Her tombstone less than 50 feet
From that very house!
