[Elliot: Blaze Bayley / lyrics: Peck]

I knew what I had to do, arming myself as I stared into the
blackness of the catacombs before me

A trail of fluorescent blue residue dimly lit the path the monster
had made. I took one last look back at my wife as she lay there
in a surreal, peaceful rest

I had no choice but to leave her there with Allistar whom I had
just beaten to within an inch of his life. As I took my first step
towards the unknown terrors I thought, truly this be the valley of
the shadow of death, but I shall fear no evil. Christ protect me
