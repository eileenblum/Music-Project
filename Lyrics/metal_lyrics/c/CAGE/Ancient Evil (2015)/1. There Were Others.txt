[Voice: Blaze Bayley / lyrics: Peck]

When will we ever know the truth
Behind the origin of mankind?
Religion sites ancient texts while science
Puts its faith in imperfect twisted theories
Both sides agree that human beings
Were not the first sentient life forms here on Earth
Somehow, from somewhere...there were others...
