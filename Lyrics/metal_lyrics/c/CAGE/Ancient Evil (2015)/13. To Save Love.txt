[Music: Garcia / lyrics: Peck]

Tell me what do I have to do to save love?
Is there anything that I can do to save love?
I would do whatever I have to do
Track down this monster and then run it through
I'd brave any perils for you my dear love

The brain
Bring me its brain
The brain
I must have its brain
Then I can create a serum she can take
On my life this I will stake

It has one weakness, a dark spot on its head
Strike it fast and hard or you will wind up dead
Now go - we don't have much time
Arm yourself to the teeth
We don't have much time
Before it's too late

[All Leads: Garcia]
