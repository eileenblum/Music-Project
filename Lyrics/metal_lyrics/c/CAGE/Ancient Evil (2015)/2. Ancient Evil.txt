[Music: Garcia, Magic, Peck / lyrics: Peck]

My name is Elliot Worthington
My loving wife is ill nothing can be done
To make matters worse
We have a nine month old son
We're leaving the seventh physician
We've seen in London
Crawling out of the shadows
Creeping into our lives
Desperate are the measures
Terrible are the times

An ancient evil can't ever be controlled
Don't make a mistake and invite evil into your life
Ancient evil, ancient evil...an ancient evil

[Lead: Trask]

Azim is my name don't be afraid
Twisted and crippled
I am as I was made
I work for a man by his hand
Annabelle can be saved
But please don't ask me how
I know your wife's name
He handed me a piece of paper
He said to me go there tonight
He slipped away into the alley
It was the year of 1869

An ancient evil can't ever be controlled
Don't make a mistake and invite evil into your life
An ancient evil, don't ever justify
Or your soul will be paying the price
Evil it's on the rise
Ancient evil

[Lead: Garcia]

I took his advice and did just what he said
I've nothing to lose my wife soon would be dead

[Lead: Trask/Garcia]

I've something to show you
That just might save your bride
Bring me a living soul back to my lair
A life for a life it only seems fair
This procedure will take place tomorrow night
I swear by my name Allistar all will be made right
I returned to find my lady kneeling
Passing out onto the floor
Another soul I would be stealing
But Annabelle would be restored

An ancient evil can't ever be controlled
Don't make a mistake and invite evil into your life
An ancient evil, don't ever justify
Or your soul will be paying the price
Evil it's on the rise
Ancient evil

An evil deep in London has arrived!
