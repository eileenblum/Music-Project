[Music: Trask, Garcia, Vozdecki, Peck / lyrics: Peck]

A week or two, that's all we made it through
Bad signs were showing again I just knew
We gave up Cassandra so this would not be
Annabelle was acting so secretly
I had to find out what was behind her strange behaviour
Did she think I was blind?

She'd lock herself into our room
I'd knock and she would not come out
I sense immense impending doom
I had no doubt, our nightmare was about to begin

I was blinded by my rage and seeing red
If he did something to my wife I'll have his head
There must be something that the Arab had not said
I was blinded by my rage and seeing red

Then one day I left early in the rain
I'd spy on my family make sure they're OK
I went to the back, put boxes in a stack
Wiped rain from the window and tried to relax
My view improved, her clothes were removed
I saw baby Jacob and her back was so smooth
She had our son a feeding had begun
She sat so awkwardly something was wrong

I saw what I could not believe, she was kneeling with my son
She held him but her hands were free, how was this being done
What kind of thing had she become?

I was blinded by my rage and seeing red
God only knows what little Jacob had been fed
So very strange the way she held her crooked head
I was blinded by my rage and seeing red

I leapt from the window and ran to the front door
Ramming my shoulder to find it was locked
Firing my pistol, it blasted to splinters
I forced my way into the bedroom and shock

[Lead: Trask]

Inside I found my bride became a monster
Tentacles flailing, they came from her chest
Split open wide from her neck to her navel
Feeding our son something not from her breast

[Lead: Garcia]

Annabelle's eyes were as white as a blizzard
Her jaw was detached with a tongue like a snake
Hissing and rasping a voice like a lizard
All this insanity too much to take

[Lead: Trask]

I made my way with my blade to baby Jacob
Cutting the sinews that now held my son
I recognized just what the hell they were made of
The same blackened tissue from when this begun
