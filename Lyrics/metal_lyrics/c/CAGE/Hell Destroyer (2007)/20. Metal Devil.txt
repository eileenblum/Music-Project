Metal demon! Metal devil! Metal demon! Metal devil!

Light from the darkness, a century since his demise
Up from the ashes the evil machine will arise
Titanium tendons and sinews of steel - this merciless master of metal
666 innocent souls will bring back the devil to life

We see them in the night: the legions are leaving the light
Forever and a day it's taken to make him awake

They kept evil alive, the devil never died, the dark lord will arise
Metal devil - they kept evil alive, the new world won't survive, a sacrilegious sight
Metal devil - uncrucified (metal devil), the lord of lies (metal devil), extinguisher of light
Metal devil!

Deep in the dungeon, all preparations were set
Dark resurrection, years of imbalance reset
Infernal invention to siphon your souls: six hundreds spirits were taken
Sixty-six others were eaten alive, witness the dawn of damnation

We see them in the night: the legions are leaving the light
Forever and a day it's taken to make him awake

They kept evil alive, the devil never died, the dark lord will arise
Metal devil - they kept evil alive, the new world won't survive, a sacrilegious sight
Metal devil - uncrucified (metal devil), the lord of lies (metal devil), extinguisher of light
Metal devil!

Rise master! What is thy bidding dark lord?

Blast through the doorway, into the light of the age
Legions of subjects horribly born to obey
The sound of his circuitry sizzles and cracks this towering titan of terror
He raises his arms to the people below and issues the final command

We see them in the night: the legions are leaving the light
Forever and a day it's taken to make him awake

They kept evil alive, the devil never died, the dark lord will arise
Metal devil - they kept evil alive, the new world won't survive, a sacrilegious sight
Metal devil - uncrucified (metal devil), the lord of lies (metal devil), extinguisher of light
Metal devil!
