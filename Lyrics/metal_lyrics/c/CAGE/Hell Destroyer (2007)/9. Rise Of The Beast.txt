Rise! Rise! Rise! Prepare for the rise of the beast!
Rise! Rise! Rise! Prepare for the rise of the beast!

He's come to bring the end of days
Raised in the arts of black magic ways
A pawn the lords of chaos play
Made to be king bringing doomsday

He will protect you from harm - a lie!
He can do no wrong - another lie!
He is the answer to all of your prayers
The world's falling under his spell

Rise! Rise! Rise! Prepare for the rise of the beast!
Rise! Rise! Rise! Prepare for the rise of the beast!

A silent tyrant on his throne
Tongue like a serpent, heart like a stone
Sovereign nations shall behold
One man to lead them, they'll do what they're told

He will protect you from harm - a lie!
He can do no wrong - another lie!
He is the answer to all of your prayers
The world's falling under his spell

Rise! Rise! Rise! Prepare for the rise of the beast!
Rise! Rise! Rise! Prepare for the rise of the beast!

Come to the line all your children of the night, see the metal shine in the full moonlight
Push the limit farther then you ever had to go until you're out of control
Come to the line all your children of the night, see the metal shine in the full moonlight
Push the limit farther then you ever had to go until you're out of control
Come to the line, see the metal shine, he is the king of tomorrow - death, despair and sorrow!

Nations united in his prayer
His words mesmerize them his hypnotic stare
This new world branded by his sign
All hail his image, all get in line

He will protect you from harm - a lie!
He can do no wrong - another lie!
He is the answer to all of your prayers
The world's falling under his spell

Rise! Rise! Rise! Prepare for the rise of the beast!
Rise! Rise! Rise! Prepare for the rise of the beast!

You're feeling a loss of control - Faster for the master
You're sinking below - faster for the master
None shall be saved - faster for the laster
Ye of little faith - faster for the master
