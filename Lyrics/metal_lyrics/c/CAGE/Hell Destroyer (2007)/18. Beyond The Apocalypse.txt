It's over, the end times have now come and gone
Smoldering cities still burning in the distance - the breaking of dawn
Crawling from wreckage, survivors uniting - we rise with glory and steel
Inside us we're changing, evolving and knowing - a new golden age is here

The fighting is over, the battle is won, the holy war left us in ruin up
From the ashes our new world's begun - a spiritual revolution

We hear the devil say then we turned around and walked the other way
He whispers to your soul
Broken bones, blood on ice, I'm your human sacrifice
Lose your mind, no control, we just want to rock and roll

The lords of the dark are gone forever and all
We stand in victory

Rise up and be counted for those that come tonight
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done alright
We're taking you far beyond the apocalypse (far beyond)
Taking you far beyond the end of the world (far beyond)
We're taking you far beyond the apocalypse (far beyond)
Taking you far beyond the end of the world

Spiraling upwards and touching the sky, new cities of shimmering silver
Into the future our power will fly, creation has been changed forever

We hear the devil say then we turned around and walked the other way
He whispers to your soul
Broken bones, blood on ice, I'm your human sacrifice
Lose your mind, no control, we just want to rock and roll

Utopian nights, cities with luminous lights
Turning the darkness into eternal daylight

What is happening to me?
I feel strange

Rise up and be counted for those that come tonight
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done alright
We're taking you far beyond the apocalypse (far beyond)
Taking you far beyond the end of the world (far beyond)
We're taking you far beyond the apocalypse (far beyond)
Taking you far beyond the end of the world

Where do we go from here now (the end of the world)
That there is nothing more to fear (the end of the world)
Where do we go from here now (the end of the world)
That there is nothing more to fear (the end of the world)
