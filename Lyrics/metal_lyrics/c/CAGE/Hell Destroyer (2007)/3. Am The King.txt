Born into fire, die by the blade - this is the life I have made
Now the war's coming on again
Treacherous dog end this charade - I'm coming to put you away
I put fear in the hearts of men

Legions are gathering deep in the night, prepare for the end of your reign
Might and magic will finally collide, the heavens will tremble and shake

Hail! Hail! Born to be king!
Hail! Hail! Rule everything!
Hail! Hail! Stand by my side as a legend is born tonight!

I've been to hell and back to overtake the throne - I am the king!
This wicked legacy is mine and mine alone - I am the king!
Your twisted treachery, this bloodbath has been settled - I am the king!
Bow down and kiss the ring, I wear the wrown of metal - the king!

Sinew and steel will carry the day - slashing and blasting away
No more you will claim this land
Sick is your sorcery, ill is your mind - no mercy from me you will find
I'll strike you down where you stand

Legions are gathering deep in the night, prepare for the end of your reign
Might and magic will finally collide, the heavens will tremble and shake

Hail! Hail! Born to be king!
Hail! Hail! Rule everything!
Hail! Hail! Stand by my side as a legend is born tonight!

I've been to hell and back to overtake the throne - I am the king!
This wicked legacy is mine and mine alone - I am the king!
Your twisted treachery, this bloodbath has been settled - I am the king!
Bow down and kiss the ring, I wear the wrown of metal - the king!
