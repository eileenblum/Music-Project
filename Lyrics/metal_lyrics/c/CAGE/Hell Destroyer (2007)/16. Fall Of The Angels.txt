I'll make you an offer you cannot refuse
I'm journeying back from the black
Based one my theory when he's weak and weary
Send war angels in to attack

I'll make him appear, I'll have to be there to dignify this deceit
Can you deliver, it's slim as silver our chances to bring his defeat

For the moment I sold him my immortal soul
This deal's gotten worse by the day
For that very reason I'm committing this treason
So I'll be released from their chains

A pentagram lies in my chamber up high, then the candles blew out with a wind
From my incantations, his manifestation - Let the battle begin

Fall of the angels - they'll fall to the earth
Angels from heaven will fall to the earth
Fall of the angels - they'll fall to the earth
Angels from heaven will fall to the earth

The fall of Leviathan will save the world
Without his protection they have no choice but to return

My hopes to escape this without repercussion
Unfortunately is not coming true
I've given my life now you must stop him somehow
The rest is now up to you

One by one they fell from the sky, four of god's angels of rage
A clash of the titans with immortals fighting for control of the age

Fall of the angels - they'll fall to the earth
Angels from heaven will fall to the earth
Fall of the angels - they'll fall to the earth
Angels from heaven will fall to the earth
Angels from heaven falling to the earth
Falling to the earth
Falling to the earth
Falling to the earth
