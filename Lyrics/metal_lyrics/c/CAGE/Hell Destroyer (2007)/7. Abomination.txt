They made him and now they're his slaves and soon all creation will follow
Chosen to rise, irresistible lies
He is the king of tomorrow
Accepting his path and coming of age, abusing political might
Black magic rays for the end of days
The instrument of revelation

He mystifies seductive eyes
He's come to set the world on fire

Abomination - draining the life from us all
Abomination - into the fire

Tyrannically taming the earth, the nations are heeding his call
He promises peace - the lies of the beast
One by one the nations fall

In line the seventh sign will seal a new order

Abomination - draining the life from us all
Abomination - into the fire
Abomination - the voice of an angel will call
Abomination
The circle of light preparing to strike
The circle of light preparing to strike

Sovereign minds all unite and save the world
All are blind by his eyes from desire

I give you all this gift unto the world
Peace forever if you follow me

The devil is pleased with his plan, his minions rejoice in his name
Some cry out loud but few hear the sound
The sound of the reckoning
He's gathered the leaders tonight, the nations unite now as one
They follow in prayer his hypnotic stare
The new age of hell has begun

All rise as freedom dies
Hail the new age messiah

Abomination - draining the life from us all
Abomination - into the fire
Abomination - the voice of an angel will call
Abomination
The circle of light preparing to strike
One last hope for forever
