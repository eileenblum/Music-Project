We came from the valley below and with our naked eyes
We saw the saviour being crucified
His sacrifice was so clear, for all our sins he died
Now you'll see fire falling from the sky
Destruction by fire - from the sky
The wrath of the sire - from the sky
All is forever changing and all of you

Heathens be frightened and know
The winds of change will blow
All will be conquered by...

The christhammer will strike the evil down
He'll rock the earth and shake the ground
Calling! The christhammer will crush the infidels
He will return, send you to hell

Alone I was stricken to be the one with second sight
Chosen to see then lead the circle of light
I hid the hammer away, then the future to me was revealed
I scribed my visions of the broken seals

Four horsemen coming - seven seals
Broken and bloody - fate revealed
A revelation for you all

Heathens be frightened and know
The winds of change will blow
All will be conquered by...

The christhammer will strike the evil down
He'll rock the earth and shake the ground
Calling! The christhammer will crush the infidels
He will return, send you to hell

Surrender yourself
Fall to your knees
Hear my words
Believe what I say

The twenty-first century dawns, the battle still rages for power
All of us know we face our darkest hour
The lords of chaos reveal the wickedness of their plan
They seek to recreate the son of man
Menacing demons - son of man
Angels are screaming - son of man
Time for redeeming and banish you

Heathens be frightened and know
The winds of change will blow
All will be conquered by...

The christhammer will strike the evil down
He'll rock the earth and shake the ground
Calling! The christhammer will crush the infidels
He will return, save you as well

The christhammer calling!
The christhammer calling!
The christhammer calling!
The christhammer calling!

Hammer! Hammer! Hammer!
Christhammer! Hammer! Hammer!
The power of the christhammer
