From the molten sky the angel came
A flash of blinding light in the fiery rain
Absolution for all demons today
I've come down to this place to devastate - all fear the name of the
Hell, hell, hell destroyer - hell, hell, hell destroyer
Hell, hell, hell destroyer - wracking havoc in hell

I'm sentencing hell to a permanent fate
Armies and legions I obliterate
All your cities and towers I render to dust
All of you stand before me - powerless now die by the end of the
Hell, hell, hell destroyer - hell, hell, hell destroyer
Hell, hell, hell destroyer - the annihilation of hell

All fear the hell destroyer! All fear the hell destroyer!

Created from vengeance-and sent down below to slay them with lightning and steel
The blacker, the evil the stronger he grows, no mercy or fear does he feel
Light kills as he violently vanquishes hell
Blood spills as Lucifer's legacy fell

By the fire from my wings I'll melt you all to cinders!

Now the kingdom of lies is rubble and ash
The dreams of devils are forever smashed
I echo a scream and soar to the sky
I leave my mark behind up from the ground - the towering sign of the hell destroyer
Hell, hell, hell destroyer - all hail the new king of hell

All fear the hell destroyer! all fear the hell destroyer!
