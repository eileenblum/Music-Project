Children of devastation, we have hell on the run
We are seizing salvation with the fire and metal from our guns
Slaying remnants of legions, blast them down as they run
Victimized by a treason - megadeath by megatons

One mighty nation under god
It's kill or be killed - so kill them all

Fire and metal will meet - eye for an eye
Vengeance is coming, you better retreat - eye for an eye

The sleeper has awakened now our justice will be done
Rewriting the lines in the sand - revelate them
Striking down the forsaken with unspeakable rage
For our fallen this modern crusade - extermination

One mighty nation under god
It's kill or be killed - so kill them all

Fire and metal will meet - eye for an eye
Vengeance is coming, you better retreat - eye for an eye
Forever will freedom be saved - eye for an eye

By soldiers that fight from the home of the brave - eye for an eye

Fire and metal will meet tonight
Fire and metal we will unite
Fire and metal will meet tonight
Fire and metal they will ignite
Fire and metal will ignite
