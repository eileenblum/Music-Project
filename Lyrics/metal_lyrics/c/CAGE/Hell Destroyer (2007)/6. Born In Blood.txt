Rise almighty dark lord for all that is unholy
Bring your blasphemous reign upon this tormented land
Born from a sea of blood, take power and devour
Rise, oh master, and bring forth revelation

Steal the blood for the beginning, the beginning of the end
We're the ones to do the sinning, we need a leader to ascend
Taken from his bloody image, extract and violate
The shroud of Turin we will pillage for evil incarnate

He'll feel the light upon his face
And fuel the fight as God's erased
Brought to life a duplicate
He'll mastermind man's fall from grace

Stealing the light
Bringer of pain and enveloping black
Follow him blindly, he'll lead us to war
He who both is and is not
Born in the blood bled from the son
We will fight
Nothing will stop us from raping the world
Bow and forever they'll heed and obey
Be this the first act of war
Born in the blood
War has begun!

From a most unholy science we turned the savior to the beast
Ruling with a fist of iron and spreading our disease
Abandon all your hope and courage ye who enter here
For we will usher in a new age of blasphemy and fear

He'll feel the light upon his face
And fuel the fight as God's erased
Brought to life a duplicate
He'll mastermind man's fall from grace

Stealing the light
Bringer of pain and enveloping black
Follow him blindly, he'll lead us to war
He who both is and is not
Born in the blood bled from the son
We will fight
Nothing will stop us from raping the world
Bow and forever they'll heed and obey
Be this the first act of war
Born in the blood
War has begun!

I am reborn but wait, I'm feeling my soul hesitates
They tell me that I am the son of the devil
They bow to me, I am the one

Dreams and schemes are being whispered into our master's ears
Decimating the resistance, their hope will disappear
The spider's web that we are weaving, their presence he will grace
Politicians will be grieving their power is replaced

He'll feel the light upon his face
And fuel the fight as God's erased
Brought to life a duplicate
He'll mastermind man's fall from grace

Stealing the light
Bringer of pain and enveloping black
Follow him blindly, he'll lead us to war
He who both is and is not
Born in the blood bled from the son
We will fight
Nothing will stop us from raping the world
Bow and forever they'll heed and obey
Be this the first act of war
Born in the blood
War has begun!

Born in the blood
Abomination
