The cities still burn
Man will not return
I have no one to turn to
There is no kingdom for me
This is not how I was told it would be
I have but one choice left
One way to go
One last chance to save my soul
Vanquished when the angels fall
The dark will be once and for all

What have I done?
Just what have I done?
What have I done?
I know what must be done
