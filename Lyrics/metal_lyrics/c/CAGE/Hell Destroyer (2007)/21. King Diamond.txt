[European Bonus Track]

Tell you a tale of a soul that was lost, mind had gone over the edge
Painting a picture of musical madness and drilling it into your head
Deep down under the ground a thunderous evil was heard
Shocking and numbing for never before were spoken such blasphemous words

Don't look in his eyes they're black as the night
He'll make you see things in the shadows
Sinister siren of Satan himself
You'll never escape when he bellows

Now say his name!

King Diamond, what have you done, twisted the minds of us all
King Diamond, sinister son of the devil himself
King Diamond, what have you done, twisted the minds of us all
King Diamond, sinister son of the devil himself

Demons and witches will raise the undead, things will go bump in the night
His face is there painted a menacing head, he's bathing himself in the moonlight
Locked in the attic and burning the candle, he'll sing of the family ghost
Missy and grandma will echo his message: never should we break the oath

Don't look in his eyes they're black as the night
He'll make you see things in the shadows
Sinister siren of Satan himself
You'll never escape when he bellows

Now say his name!

King Diamond, what have you done, twisted the minds of us all
King Diamond, sinister son of the devil himself
King Diamond, what have you done, twisted the minds of us all
King Diamond, sinister son of the devil himself

Melissa... Belial... Abigail... Grandma...
Melissa... Belial... Abigail... The princess of hell...

His legend kept growing and quickly it spreads, his evil it flew on the wind
One day he will visit the land of the dead but don't think his haunting will end
Crossing the river he's there next to Charon, making his way cross the Styx
There on his forehead burning and branded his upside down crucifix

Don't look in his eyes they're black as the night
He'll make you see things in the shadows
Sinister siren of Satan himself
You'll never escape when he bellows

Now say his name!

King Diamond, what have you done, twisted the minds of us all
King Diamond, sinister son of the devil himself
King Diamond, what have you done, twisted the minds of us all
King Diamond, sinister son of the devil himself

King Diamond!
King Diamond!
King Diamond!
King Diamond!
