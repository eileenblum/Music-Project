[Music: Garcia / Peck, Lyrics: Peck]

On the horizon I scan the debris
Straight into danger I charge as they flee
My mission is clear now I know why they call
They've sent for the wrecker to vanquish them all
Once I was innocent once I knew love
They took from me everything was enough
There by the fire my red silhouette
Now I'm the mistake they won't live to regret
Born out of anger and strengthened by pain
He kills for the thrill now he's come back again
Don't beg him for mercy just pray for your life
His red shadow hunting for victims tonight
Speed kills violently shaking
Speed kills breaking apart
Speed kills disintegrating
Speed kills pounding your heart

[Lead Garcia]

Immovable object unstoppable force
Violently meeting I show no remorse
My enemies gather they stand in a line
Merciless judgement one life at a time
Under his cloak at the stroke of midnight
His infrared stare glaring laser red sights
Only in whispers they tell of his tale
Many have faced him and many have failed

[Chorus]

Twisted forms that onde had souls
Now dead eyes stare under control
Armed with rage and poisoned minds
They fall before my death design
Racing forth to take my life
Under this sacred moonlit night
With my steel they'll meet their end
To the abyss they all descend
Your power has faced its meeting its end
my silence so deadly no way to defend
This desolate city no longer alive
I'm taking it over now all this is mine

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Fast as a bullet fast as a shark
My killing addiction is deadly and dark
Faster than life faster than death
Faster and faster till nothing is left
Speed kills!
