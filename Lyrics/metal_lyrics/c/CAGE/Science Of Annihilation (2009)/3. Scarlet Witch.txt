[Music: Garcia / Peck, Lyrics: Peck]

I awoke from my sleep
Terror constricting me tight
Something quite wicked
Has come for my spirit tonight
There in the trees a woman was floating on air
Just like bloody crimson
Her billowing dress and her hair
She'll curse you with her evil eye
Into the blackest night she'll fly
Seduction by forbidden sex
You will fall victim to her hex
The Scarlet Witch
She's taking to flight again
The Scarlet Witch
I'm under her spell again
The Scarlet Witch
She's looking for love again
The Scarlet Witch
She sails on the southern wind

[Lead Mcginnis]

Daring to look my eyes were drawn to her face
I was her chosen that is why
She had come to this place
I felt myself losing control
Falling under her spell
The shame of my actions
Are details I can't ever tell

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

With a word and the tail of a rat
By the door her prowling black cat
Chains on my wrists locked to the floor
She used me in unimaginable ways
Sadistic pleasure scratching my back
I served her needs until my bones cracked
The only way she knows how to love
My will has finally begun to succumb

[Lead Garcia / Lead Mcginnis]

Savage seduction poison from venomous lips
Men turned to slaves
Victims from her evil kiss
By the queen of all covens
All of the kings have been cursed
I was the last to resist now completely I'm hers

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Beware the witch burn alive tonight
