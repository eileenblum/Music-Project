[Music: Garcia / Peck, Lyric: Peck]

Slain upon the battlefield somehow I didn't die
I rose to stand upon my feet then soared up to the sky
My mind became injected with the knowledge of all time
Some men call me the spectre beware my watchful eye
Now you will fall before the dread of my might
Pray pray for the dawn of first light a fate worse than death
Science of annihilation
Charge into the breach of the fight Rage raging with no end in sight
No turning back science of annihilation
The spectre of war is looming tonight
I am the injector beware of my sight
The spectre of war all shall obey I am destructor of all I survey
The spectre of war The spectre of war
The spectre of war is looming tonight
They knew me by so many names a pagan god of war
For centuries I roamed the earth now legendary lore
The battle lines have been drawn we may not see the dawn
Chaos and order divide religion and science collide
Atoms and molecules spirits and souls
Master creator meets master control
Fret for your life should the spectre appear
For he's a foreshadowing soothsaying seer

[Lead Mcginnis]

I became immortal with the power of a God
Reborn I did manipulate the scores of kings and pawns
These wars I did facilitate this world was full of sin
Watching men kill other men and kill and kill again
See how they...

[Chorus]

[Post chorus]

[Lead Garcia]

The spectre of war some men call me
The spectre
Beware my watchful eye
