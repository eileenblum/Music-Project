[Music: Mcginnis, Lyrics: Peck]

Rushing to the shore
Splashing metal gates
Oh the time has come
For the bravest of the brave
Overwhelming force
By the thousands we invade
we must prevail and win the longest day
To win the fight
The nations on this day unite
By land and sea the air we breathe
We charge on blindly to the fire
Rise up and face the terror of tyranny
Break out fury will seal their fate
A state of total war
The world wont be the same
The bodies and the bullets fall like rain
Charging to the wall
The sand is bloody stained
Our soldiers die
But our courage still remains

[Chorus]

It's up to us again
Before all is lost
Two hundred thousand men
Will defeat and crush the iron cross

[Lead Mcginnis]

Shattered bone and blood
Battleships and planes
The tyrant's fall
We've broken them again
The pounding heavy guns
We're fearless yet afraid
A heavy price our dead have surely paid
God bless them all and glory to the brave!

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]
