[Music: CAGE]
[Lyrics: Sean Peck]

The clock is ticking for the sickly as they waste away
One day we're here the next we're gone
Our one desire to go higher past the golden age
Now that new day has finally dawned

Imagine life without any end
Now we can start a over again
Such wicked science affecting us all
Out of control!!
Fountain of youth is here

The act of living unforgiving such a slow decay
We watch free-radicals erode
Stem-cell technology is overriding DNA
They reset genetic code

Imagine life without any end
Now we can start a over again
Such wicked science affecting us all
Out of control!!
Fountain of youth is here

It's here!
Do you want to live forever?
We have what it takes
There is a price to pay
What is it?

Bio-ethicists insidious it is they say
Theoogians echo on man's new profanity is vanity is rules the day
Moral consciousness is gone

Imagine life without any end
Now we can start a over again
Such wicked science affecting us all
Out of control!!
Fountain of youth is here

Feel the fountain flowing it's changing all our lives
We're losing who we are
If God created life
How can we destroy death?
We've pushed the line too far
The end is justified by the means that God is life and we should carry on
what will be crucified 
What is the sacrifice?
The fountain seems so... Wrong
