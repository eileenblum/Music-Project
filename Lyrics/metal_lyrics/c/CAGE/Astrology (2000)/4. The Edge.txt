[Music: Eric Horton / Sean Peck]
[Lyrics: Sean Peck]

I have come to show the truth the power and the way

If the tenth dimension far beyond all the things we can see 
Lies a place of power and it holds al that you'll ever be
If you take the journey you will find all the answers you seek
You will fulfill a yearning and oh all the havoc you will wreak

You've got one foot in the grave
Take yourself to the brink
Like the razor blade of a knife
You begin to think
You need to be...
On the Edge
Falling again over the edge
Living your life on the edge

Feeling large and lethal and intoxicatingly cold
All those that will oppose you decimated by your stranglehold
As the Edge engulfs you and it just might envelope us all
Keep your feet beneath you and beware of the distance to fall

You've got one foot in the grave
Take yourself to the brink
Like the razor blade of a knife
You begin to think
You need to be...
On the Edge
Falling again over the edge
Living your life on the edge
