[Music: CAGE]
[Lyrics: Sean Peck]

Oh when it came they thought the safeguards remained oh no!
They knew that others had told them so
Anarchy in the streets begins to grow
The blackness made all our morals melt
Survival instinct is a that is felt
Protect your home and you family
Because GOD has set the monster free

Stand and fight
Organize rebellion
We'll uprise and soon you know that the peace will decay
The trigger effect has wiped the laws away
Will you still obey?
The trigger effect is beginning today

As frustration filled the streets
The politicians stomped their feet
They roled the tanks into the towns to beat our opposition down

Stand and fight
Join us in rebelion
We'll uprise if they break their oath to us peace will decay
The trigger effect has wiped the laws away
Will you still obey?
The trigger effect is beginning today
We are in disarray
Pandora's open mankind will pay

Something is not right
The feeling is all wrong
We are not giving in the people are strong
We are going the distance we will forge a new way
A primal existence is what we all crave

Power has been restored
It's too late the chaos grows exponentially
Was it self fulfilling prophecy
Is this the end of our democracy
Empires fall structure is purged
Revolution removes the scourge
It happens every few centuries
It is time we bring them to their knees!

Stand and fight
Fight with our rebelion
We'll uprise
With a gun in hand oh the peace will decay
The trigger effect has wiped the laws away
Will you still obey?
The trigger effect is beginning today
We are in disarray
Pandora's open mankind will pay

To kill is the way
Surviving the bloodshed there's lives you must take
It's pointing at you
Make no mistake what wil you do?
