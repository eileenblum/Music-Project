[Music: Dave Garcia]
[Lyrics: Sean Peck]

Here we are asking again where is GOD ?
It's breaking us down we're feeling so lost
In solitude why don't you explore a way that is new that shakes you to the core.

A resonating voice from afar
Listen very close to the stars and then never again will you fall.
What does it mean ? 
How does it know?
It's the final solution. 
Just when you think there is no place to go it's the final solution.

Clouded are minds of men
Where is GOD ?
Some say we face diminishing odds
Celestial mechanics will restore
Human destiny will be reborn.

A resonating voice from afar
Listen very close to the stars and then never again will you fall.
What does it mean ? 
How does it know?
It's the final solution.
Just when you think there is no place to go it's the final solution.

The secret of the zodiac lies within. 
Living a life of sin where is GOD ?
Darkest are things before the dawn.
The resurrection of  your spirit is near
Feel its' evolution while you hear...

A resonating voice from afar
Listen very close to the stars and then never again will you fall.
What does it mean ? 
How does it know?
It's the final solution.
Just when you think there is no place to go it's the final solution.
