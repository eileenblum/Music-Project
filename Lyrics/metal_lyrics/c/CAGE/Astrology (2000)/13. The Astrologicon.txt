Hidden from evil the book and its secrets remain
Holding the key to the future and just whant our God's preordained
Protected by priests made of iron containing omnipotent force
Stronger and wise become holy eyes as the union begins with the source

We're all seeking the light
Fallen savior
No! we're all seeking the light
Fallen savior
The book has a name the stories are true there is no end to what it can do

Reading the pages they seemed to be coming
Deciphered in stages revealling the legend of time
More ancient then all other scriptures this coveted relic of signs
Designed to endure enshrined to the pure now the truth will be told this time

We're all seeking the light
Fallen savior
No! we're all seeking the light
Fallen savior
The book has a name the stories are true there is no end to what it can do

Using the Astrologicon and watching the sky the Vatican gained clairvoyance and the power to make other die

We're all seeking the light
Fallen savior
No! we're all seeking the light
Fallen savior

Power corrupting it's too much for one man to hold
Imbalance disrupting the war for the struggle of souls
Existence is no longer secret we're facing a perilous plight
The book has a cost distinction is lost between the dark and the light

We're all seeking the light
Fallen savior
No! we're all seeking the light
Fallen savior
The book has a name the stories are true there is no end to what it can do

The purest intentions are melting away with the coming fight
Evil is beckoning born to betray
Watch the King and the Fallen angel rise
