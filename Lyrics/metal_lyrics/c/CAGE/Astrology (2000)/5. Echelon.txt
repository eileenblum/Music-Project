[Lyrics: Sean Peck]

Someone's listening to everything we say.
Nothing gets by them
Our hands are bound, they take the sounds and powerplay
We can't untie them

A web of networks covering us globally.
Unholy alliance
Echelon was started for our own security.
We just don't but it

Capture the words that you say.
Filtering dictionaries
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide, how will we ever escape?
Our lives they violate
Big brother hearing what you say, encompassing array
There's nowhere anyone can hide secrets or lies
When they scan you with their prying eyes, your words are analyzed
You never really know just
When they're listening in

Victim of a system we unknowingly play, how will it go?
What if there is something they don't want you to say, just when will they know ?
Sprawling operations intercepting our minds and reading our screens.
Appalling indignations they're invading our lives,
Oh what does it mean?

Satellites are beaming information rays defying description
Telecommunication it never will be freed from their encryption

Capture the words that you say.
Filtering dictionaries
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide, how will we ever escape?
Our lives they violate
Big brother hearing what you say, encompassing array
There's nowhere anyone can hide secrets or lies
When they scan you with their prying eyes, your words are analyzed
You never really know just
When they're listening in
