Destiny, that is what I saw in you
I was so mistaken a love that wasn't true
The things you kept inside
Important issues that you hide but why do you still linger in my mind

You're coming
I'll start running
You're far too late to save our love tonight
My feelings that you vandalize
Well there is nothing to say but good bye
My feelings that you vandaize just one too many lies

Bleeding my heart is split in two
Half seft preservation the other is not with you
Ten too many times pain and fate became entwined escape
You're oblivious you're blind

You're coming
I'll start running
You're far too late to save our love tonight
My feelings that you vandalize
Well there is nothing to say but good bye
My feelings that you vandaize just one too many lies

NO NO NO!
You felt it coming and so did you
Apologetic crap that you spew
You tried to mend it I closed the gate
Now I'm teling you not to wait
The time invested was such a waste
Now you left my mouth with a bitter taste

So high is your maintenance
You just don't know what you want I can't be your sustenance
You don't know that you need something that I just can't feed our love is no longer growing
It's slowing slowing slowing!

My feelings that you vandalize
Well there is nothing to say but good bye
My feelings that you vandaize just one too many lies
My feelings feelings
My feeling that you Vandalize
