[Lyrics: Sean Peck]

Something's going wrong
It formulated in Babylon
Today we lie trapped on a cross of gold
How far will we fall
The color red engulfs us all
We're sinking and drowning in their greed

Oh no
Take it away take their power away
The people are running scared
Take their power away
Nobody cares

The Feds who reserve
Their our master as slaves me serve
The ones that Christ called the Pharisees
They've taken control
Because everything in life is tolled
Lincoln said money power preys on peace

Oh no
Take it away
Take their power away of freedom will start to fade
Take their power away this prison they made
The root of all evil you're holding in your hands
The root of all evil we're victims of their plans

Illuminati, the new world order is now
The future looks so dark
Soon they'll ask you to take their mark
To count you and make you do their deeds
The youth of today are seeing through these wicked ways
This system and it's oppression is obsolete

Oh no
Take it away take their power away
Jefferson's warning heard
Take their power away
Nobody's learned
The root of all evil you're holding in your hands
The root of all evil we're victims of their plans
The root of all evil corrosive currency
The root of all evil constant usury
