[Music: Eric Horton]
[Lyrics: Sean Peck]

They come seeking adventure they come from miles around
Practicing discretion they hardly make a sound
You've really got to go there and see it for yourself
For some hedonistic pleasure just be careful of your health
Silence is golden when you visit this place

Dare the darkened hallways and flashing neon lights
&gt;From fantasy to fetish you won't believe your eyes
Al that you desire is there for you to touch
But you've got to know your limits so don't indulge too much

Silence is golden when you visit this place
The secrets your holding don't tell a soul, prevent your disgrace
Broken dreams running through the Red Light District come with men

Many people stay
Others run away you know it can be rough
We just can't get enough

The coffee shops and spacecakes are soothing to your soul
What difference does it make there's no need for control
If just takes fifty gilders and lust and sin are live
It will leave you so bewilclered
I hope you can survive

Silence is golden when you visit this place
The secrets you're holding don't tell a soul, prevent your disgrace
Broken dreams running through the Red Light District come with men
