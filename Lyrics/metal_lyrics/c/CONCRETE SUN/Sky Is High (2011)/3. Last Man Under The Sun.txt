Under all the stones, yeah, ain't no Sun gonna shine
My dreams have been devoured, came crumbling down so fast â should've known better
Castles built in air, torn apart by winds of confine
I'm left to feel that everything is flawed by design

Rising, falling, everlasting cadence of life
I know, cause I've seen it a million times
It's time to break or strike a punch, ooh yeah,
ain't no life on the run..

Hanging by a thread of snakeskin of mine
I'll shed this coat of lies, leave it all to unwind
Clutching at the straws, all alone against my pride
I've never learned to fear, but I'm trying all the time

Rising, falling, everlasting cadence of life
Grab the rudder and steer through the fog
But right now I feel like the last man,
The last man under the Sun

Under all the stones, yeah, ain't no Sun gonna shine
My dreams have been devoured, came crumbling down so fast 
I didn't want to wake, but the winds blew the dust at my eyes
They woke up the last man under the Sun..

I didn't want to believe, that now it's gone, my flood tide 
I lived a dream
Looking through the flames, I'm done

Rising, falling, everlasting cadence of life
To be the master, to pull through the night
A new dawn will bring a hope, I don't wanna be the last man 
Under the Sun...
