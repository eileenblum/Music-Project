Old enough for the shovel
But not yet for a grave
Iâll remain âtill you say goodbye
To your perfect slave
Retreating in front of
My own obsession
To the perfection of a slave

Drowned and nailed me
Under bound ego

Iâm still not giving up
A scar-riddled age
Teens and twenties
That went in a rage
Will you understand
Your perfect slave
You see me dying slowly
But you donât care

Drowned and nailed me
Under bound ego

Like a stone, broken down in pieces
Itâs just a shattered picture
And some pieces put together
Is all thatâs left
