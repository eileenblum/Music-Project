Pullinâ life out of the gutter
Chewinâ memories of you,
You that couldnât get dizzy
By drinking my last blood drop

Now Iâm gonna find myself,
While I try to see the path
Others worshipped God
You killed me, but I worshipped you

Burn my fears, I canât love
You feed my fears, I canât love
Again alone, âtill Iâm down and wasted

Youâll see and youâll regret,
Screaming out my name
Youâll just want me, a new beginning
With me

I collide with the smoke 
that tears the curse apart
While my breath is lost
Donât let me fly so low
Just to kill the shadow

Just to make a new beginning with me
