Hey hey, I see you nearin'
Ain't no drug enough to calm me down   
Hatin', a fight you are fearin' 
Betrayer's breath I smell from a mile
I am the one who won't take it
Cut the bullshit, it's time to straighten out
I'll make sure you regret it
You'll taste the motherfucking ground

You never walked the line
I think you better pray
For every single lie
I will enjoy your pain 

Hey, it's me, remember the old days?
Ain't nobody's gonna save you now
I've been through all the cobwebs
Everything I know will haunt me now
Tearing your skin by a manic gaze
You ain't worth the punch of a man
Sweet revenge, so close but, you know best
Cowards die many times before deat
You wanna try me?
Believe the word I say
I'll make you beg, and you know
You got no nerve man..

Junkyard, the Junkyard dog
Cause that's who we fucking are
