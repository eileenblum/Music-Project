A mass suicide by the fireplace
There is no one brave to rebel
Dead man talking straight to me
And Iâll have to move on,
Investigate

And meet some beasts 
Which were not expected 
Or predicted, no

The smallest forests bury
The darkest ghouls
All alone in the park, searching for the light 
It starts to rain and thunder

And I fell, far far below

And I am maybe mad
But now itâs all grey
No more macabre spawns
Killing the fog of the burning sin

Far far below
Only a hope, no, far far below
Only a hope
