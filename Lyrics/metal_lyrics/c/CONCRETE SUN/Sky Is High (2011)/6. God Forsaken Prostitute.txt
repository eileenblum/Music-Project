Furnace of religion
Always melts the ones left alone
Cancer for some change
Will we ever learn

A wisdom unsurpassed
Weâre crushed and overpowered
My conscience wonât confound
Icons of their idols fade

Wonder if weâll ever learn

So feed the feeling of impending doom
Suck the power from addictive drug
Foreboding feeling of the ending 
Float along the god-forsaken flood

Tears of wounded virgins
Splash against the dead cold hearts
Still Alone
We are broken-armed again, I guess
So why the hell we even try

Litres of courage and no fate
Still, gallons of hate and weâre late again
Again, again and againâ¦
