Green poison is running through our veins
Have we gone too far in our pains
Seventh dizzy morning, paralyzed
Wanna hear the story of my life?

And I say
Know me
Truly
Feel me
I said, live free

Glasses are falling again, 
Glasses are falling again, 
Glasses are falling again, 
Glasses are falling again, around us

Heart of steel, hammered by my mind
shooting the emotions, time after time
If I let my mask die with a sin
would you cry in sorrow after me?

Know me
Truly
Feel me
I said, live free

Faces call me again
Faces call me again
Faces call me again
Faces call me again to the other side

Glasses faling again
Faces calling again to the other side

And that's the story of my life...
