Sky is high, and Iâm high
You left it all behind
Sucked the honey through the pain

Every dayâ¦ 
Do not ask for my soul
Flattered and shattered

A state of hopeless mind decay
No blink of fate, no flame of hate

Can you feel me inside
Feel me feel the fear

Baby I feel so dead
What went so wrong?
We went from prime to grime
All that is left are scars
Maybe my fear of death
Made me so strong
You came from time to time
And what was mine was yours

Can you feel me inside
Feel me, feel the fear
