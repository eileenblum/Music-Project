From a poison pod we rise up
Like snakes we slither
And time is on our side

In a cell we're living like maggots
Collect the unfailing rage
Exhausted life, charging battery of death
They can fuck with us cannot stop the time

Every day we tear the chains, but they renew
Breathe the poison, expiring life
A long way of thorns we walk
Life is going faster in our suffering

With our muse we built and traveled the universe
Sickness, our thoughts built the planets
After old ideas everything breaks down and disappears
Like a virus with no end

And again the maggots are growing up
Tossed from the pain
They're suffering of already provided lane
One of them broke down the membrane
Screams and echo make the peace begin
