Day of Anger
What dread there will when the judge shall come?
To judge all things to judge things strictly
What shall I plead in my anguish?
Who will help me? Give me your councel
Day of Anger
Day of Terror
Will resolve the Earth in ashes
this was David's revelation and the Sybill bear witness
Day of Anger
Day of Terror
Will resolve the Earth in ashes
this was David's revelation and the Sybill bear witness
When departed generation Rise again to answer Judgement
Day of Anger
Day of Terror
Will resolve the Earth in ashes
Trumpets sounding loud as thunder
call the buried dead from the slumber
To the throne of God almighty
Death shall marvel Earth shall wonder
When departed generation Rise again to answer Judgement
Day of Anger
Day of Terror
this was David's revelation
Day of Anger
Day of Terror
Will resolve the Earth in ashes
this was David's revelation and the Sybill bear witness
To the throne of God almighty
Death shall marvel Earth shall wonder
Day of Anger
Day of Terror
