When the cursed all are banished
Doomed to that devouring furnace
Summon me among the blessed. On my knees I fall (before them)
Grant the dead eternal rest perpetual light shine.

Day of bitter Lamentation
When man rises up from ashes
Doomed to Judgement Lost and Guilty
Grant me grace for my atonement
Ere the day I stand

I lament for I and I am (Guilty) and I blush for my wrong doing
I implore Them Saviour spare me

Grant the dead eternal rest perpetual light shine.

I lament for I and I am (Guilty) and I blush for my wrong doing
I implore Them Saviour spare me.
