As I think of you.
With cries that pierce me to the heart
For I own all the beasts
Of the forest beasts in theirs thousands on my hills.
With cries that pierce me
To the heart my enemies
Revile saying all the day
Where is your God?
You love evil more, than good lies more than truth you want
You love the destructive, world you tongue to deceit.
From the land of the living I will snatch you from your tent and uproot you.
For the sins of their mouths for the curses and lies that shall they speak.
Let me dwell in your tent for ever and hide in the shelter of your dreams.
For you hear my prayer grams the heritage of those.
He will search. We searches the mind and knows the depths of the heart.
The end of the earth stand in awe at the sight of your wonders
With cries that pierce me
To the heart my enemies
Revile saying all the day
Where is your God?
As I think of you.
With cries that pierce me to the heart
For I own all the beasts
Of the forest beasts in theirs thousands on my hills.
From my sins. Turn away
Your face and blow out all my guilt
Make me hear rejoin and gladness that the bones you have (crushed may thrill).
