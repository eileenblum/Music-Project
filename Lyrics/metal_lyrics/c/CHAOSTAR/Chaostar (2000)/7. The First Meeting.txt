[Gaia:] "Greetings, my name is Gaia.
I suppose I am looking to the right direction. Excuse me if I am not!"
The tone of her voice was sarcastic and confident.
Once she had a high rank in this society.
She was an expert on the Observation of the planetary rotations.
Until a rare illness ended her ascension on the scientific pyramid,
trapping her in a dark, colorless world. Project Atom Traveller
was an opportunity for her to be back on the field. But of course,
it was also her best chance to retrieve her vision. Cendor had discovered
a revolutionary technique, which made possible the sharing of the same
images and thoughts between two different minds. It was something
never done before in Ahrem, except maybe from Hermites.
There were some strange rumors about this ancient tribe.
They had their own secret rules and practices.
They usually meditated, sitting patiently in front of large rectangular transmission sets.
That's why they were also called "The Receivers".
The rumors suggested that Cendor took the basic idea of project Atom Traveller directly from them.
Yet, there was no solid proof for that, just words. And none could ask The Receivers.
They vanished as mysteriously as they appeared, leaving no trace behind them.

[Cendor:] "I am pleased to meet you Gaia. Without individuals like you science would never
transcend from theory to practice."
[Gaia:] "Yes, thanks. I am crazy enough to risk my life for a stinking experiment!"

She definitely knew how to make someone feel uncomfortable. But he didn't criticize her.
He knew damn well this reaction. It was natural for someone deeply "wounded".
Mayon O was clearly a different case. Although he was an elder he carried the aura of a child.
The impression was enhanced, from the innocent gaze of his wide optic sensors as they examined
everything with childish curiosity. Optimist and calm tempered, he was the perfect candidate.
He would focus the spirit of the team on the right direction.
