[Mayon O:] "I feel no Gravity. We cannot move at all"!

[Gaia:] "Relax, probably this is a temporary condition...
Else we will just have to get use to it! When I lost
my sight I learned to feel the night, depending
on the senses that remained available.
In the beginning, I felt like I was inside a different world,
although I wasn't. But this world of sounds, smells, temperatures
and material objects was not as frightening as I thought."

[Mayon O:] "You never cease to amaze me Gaia.
You have so much strength inside you. I must apologize.
It has been a long time since I did something exciting
in my life and I don't know how to handle it.
In addition it is the first time I experience
this kind of symbiosis and I am a little bit nervous.
So please don't be a harsh judge".

[Gaia:] "Anyway, our symbiosis will not last for long.
Cendor will bring us back to base as soon as we'll pass to phase VI.
Then we will have all the time for discussions. So now let's focus on the mission.
I am sure the people of Ahrem will have a lot of questions to ask us.
I don't think they are going to be happy if we tell them
that we spent all our time communicating instead of exploring".

[Mayon O:] "I have an idea! Let's split our responsibilities assuming specific roles.
It is less complicating to concentrate on one thing a time."

[Gaya:] "You are right! I will leave you in charge of our movement.
I will concentrate on the observation and analysis of the situation.
I am really skilled on this field".
