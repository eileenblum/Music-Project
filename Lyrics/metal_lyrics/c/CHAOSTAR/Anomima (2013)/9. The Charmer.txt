Two horses rest in silence, by the sea.
When a young girl, who came from the dead, approached the scene.

Inside their nostril, she has laid a scent of deed and you may listen
to their neigh in your silent dream.

Charmer, my poor charmer, rest under the olive-tree,
under the olive-tree.

When death loses track of all her charms,
he is always drunk in Morpheus' arms.
Under the silent, the silent olive-tree.

Charmer, my poor charmer!

Two horses are gazing at the sea,
when a young girl approached the scene.
Her name in the shape of fear.
Her shield shiny, as when she lived...

Charmer, my poor charmer, rest under the olive-tree.
Charmer, my poor charmer, rest under the olive-tree.
Under the olive-tree!!
