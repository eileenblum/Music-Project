For a marble, without shape...
For inscriptions, not to obliterate...

Don't cry, for my vain strife...
Death will always thrive where love hides...

Sorrow descending...

Mounting the throne, time rolls.
Sunday ending but Sunday dawns...

For the dice with death, I pray again!

Halo of obedience, your chamber's Kingdom!
Sorrow descending, my soul ascends!

Alas! Long live with the dead!
My soul ascends, my vows were kept.
