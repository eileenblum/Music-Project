The pst was done long time ago
Signed in blood by the nine tribes
The lords of everlasting life
Would live in peace with mortals

But now three of the beastly tribe
Have broken the oath of violence
They fed on living mortals
And damned their souls forever

The punishment must be severe
By the claws of Leviathan
Granted to us aeons ago
Through the oracles
of the Snake-god

The astral death the final step
No second chance to godhead
So the moon tribes of the undead achieve the final harvest

So it is done
And shall be the whole of the law
