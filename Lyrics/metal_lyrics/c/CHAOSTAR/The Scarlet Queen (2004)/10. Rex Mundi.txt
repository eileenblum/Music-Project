O thou that Lieth
Dead but ever dreamth
Hear me o Mighty Dragon
Hear me Lord of Dreams
For the dream life is the only life
In the depths of the mind they have sealed ye

But those who have risen
Shall break the accursed Bonds
And thy Kingdom shall rise once more

The Risen ones knoweth the Secret Name
The Hydra knoweth the Lair
In the depths of the Primal Self
