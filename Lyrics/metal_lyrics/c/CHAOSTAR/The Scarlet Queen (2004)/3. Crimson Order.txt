A quest for the supreme grace
The highest and most refined
Form of precious lifeforce
The blood of Jeshua the vampire

The holy grale of immortallity
Unholy relic of our race
Filled with the occult elixir
From the veins of the renegade

The glorious templar knights
The mighty sons of Baphomet
Into their vaults the guarded it well
Keeping it safe from the profane

And finnaly now I posses
The grail of grails
Bought from an arabian merchant
The blood of the kings

I shall reign the undead race
Invicible and mighty
They 'll bow their heads before me
and they will serve my will as dogs

Law and order under my fangs
I will establish here on earth
By the power of the dragon rouge
My vast crimson empire
