Connected by ancient bonds
In the deepest howling night
I have lived a thousand years
And crossed thousand years

(the) Lust for power
Is a deep desire
So deep as the darkest sin
Which fuels my veins with life

Time and space are all one
Dimensions melt into my blood
Transgression through the gates
Of the sacred Sigurat

Part of a draconian mind
I watch the world
Through infinity
Civilisations come and go
As the scars on my eternal soul
