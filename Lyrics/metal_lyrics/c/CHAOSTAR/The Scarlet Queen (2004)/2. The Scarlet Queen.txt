Buried under the sand she was
Bounden by the seal of Ra
Curse the deserted of the gods
Mistress of the great serpent

For aeons and centuries
Stealing the dreams of mortals
Fueling her astral inmost self
Unlocking the grand secret

She broke the binding spells
Set free her luscious body
The earth became her hunting plain
and blood became her nectar

She ruled the lands with cruelty
An endless blood red orgy
Feeding on lovers, women, slaves
She made the world her playground

Offspring of sin and deviance
Spawned in her immortal womb
She gave birth to a new breed
The breed of the vampire
