They created me as their sword
And clothed me in chaos
So my form may be ever hidden
In the shadows

I am the mask, the will,
The punishment
Of those that were
When time was not
Of those who breath beyond time

I am the priest of the ether
The knight of the astral
The assassin of dimensions
Punisher of the renegades
I am the dweller in the air
I have many faces that non shall

The waves breeze before me
Even my creators dread my call
In men's dream I whisper
On the souls of the rebels I feast
No one knows my form
I am the assassin of gods
