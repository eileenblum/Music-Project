Do you feel my sin
My warm breath upon your skin
Your world is pain
But I am the life
I will seal your fate
(with) Neverending joy

I can wipe away your tears
With one fatal lethal kiss

No words escape my blood red lips
And yet I call to you
I will out your last breath
For you belong to me
Slowly I will drink your soul
The dark engulfs you into my world

My movements make no sound
My touch is swift and soft
On blood is what I thrive

Your skin is white and smooth
Like a snowy desert
With rivers of red
You'll be transformed
And you will rise

You'll roam eternally the night
Under the wings of darkness
You are absolutely mine
