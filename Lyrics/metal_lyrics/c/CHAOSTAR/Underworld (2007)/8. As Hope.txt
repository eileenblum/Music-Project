The book before them
Where all records have been written
When Creation comes in Trial
Then the Gods will sit in Judgement

Canticles as hope

Do not forsake me
Seeking me through vast afflicted
To redeem me, by the passion.

Canticles as hope

This is my prayer to you, like the deer
that yearns for running streams
My soul is yearning
Where can I see the face of you?

Canticles as hope

Do not forsake me
Seeking me through vast afflicted
To redeem me, by the passion.
Let such a labor not to be useless by the Judge.

Canticles as hope
