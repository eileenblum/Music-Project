Our patience has been dried away
since a long time...
And the thirst, the need to unfold desire,
Transforming it into a touchable object.

How bitter was the taste of emptiness
in our illformed mouths
but it was natural as our ideas
was based on wishes younger,
Weed as fruits at first.

[A SCHOLAR:]
"YOUR FATHERS KNEW
THESE WORLDS BY HEART
EVEN THOSE THAT NEVER EVER CROSSED
THE EERIE SIDE."

We came to see the upper world.
Where colours dance and the air moves bright
We came to see...

As a cat with her claws extended
orchestrates a merciless grasp,
weapons move damn swiftly
in an attacking stance,
ready to cut through
and open doors grimson.

[A SCHOLAR:]
"YOUR FATHERS KNEW
THESE WORLDS BY HEART
EVEN THOSE THAT NEVER EVER CROSSED
THE EERIE SIDE."

[DIVINE MOTHER:]
"LET ME HEAL YOUR WOUNDS WITH MINE
NOW THAT YOU HAVE DECEIVED THE NIGHT."

[THE LEADER:]
"REST ASSURED THAT NONE OF US
WILL EVER LOSE THE WAY TO YOU.
THESE STAINS ARE ALSO TRACES
AND THEY CLEAN CONSCIENCE
AS IT IS THEIR DUTY TO DO SO.
THE ORDER WAS STRICT
CONQUER OR BE CONQUERED."

Our patience has been dried away
since a long time...
And the thirst, the need to unfold desire,
Transforming it into a touchable object.

[THE LEADER:]
HOLD NO MORE YOUR HORSES
LET THEM RUN LIKE LAVA
MELTING STONE AND GRANITE
IN HOLLOW CAVES.

Raging victory acts as shepherd
leading the way
