So I came back, one last time, and it was like fate stared me in the eye and told me -
"Itâs your turn to cross that line".
And all the frustration died.
And inside I only found the heartache was true.
And from this we cannot run.
I cannot run, I canât run, I canât run.
I cannot run any more.
And yet I still feel the pull.
Like a moth towards the light.
I still fell to you.
Everyday and every night and every moment you haunted me.
You haunted me.
Now you decorate my life with little reminders that whisper to me -
"Youâll never be the same after this".
Everywhere Iâd go the siren sung me home.
The siren sings me home.
But I came back one last time and it was like fate stared me in the eye and told me - 
"Itâs your turn to cross that line".
And keeping my distance from you was the hardest thing to do.
But we cannot deny, the heartache was true.
I cannot run, I canât run, I canât run.
Iâve crossed that line.
These heartstrings pull me to you.
This time I must fight this.
(And all the frustration died, 
I took the last look and realised,
Just how much has changed since those two years agoâ¦)
And in this moment I made my peace.
