Welcome to the real world.
I remember when life was so simple.
At what point was the blindfold stolen?
Innocence, Stolen,
Welcome to the real worldâ¦
â¦and the sky falls down in pieces,
the shattered remains of a world we used to know.
Wake up.
Everything I love is fading when every step has a price.
Everything you know is changing.
Now youâre on your own.
I feel like the tight-rope walker, keeping the balance - but for how much longer?
I still canât see the other side.
I never thought Iâd find myself like this
I can almost taste the failure on my lips.
Everything I love is fading when every step has a price.
Everything you know is changing.
Now youâre on your own.
Youâre on your fucking own.
Sometimes I feel like giving up,
Let the waters over take us.
And I will be forgotten,
Return to nothingâ¦
â¦but Iâve come too far to let that happen.
Now Iâm the spirit of the lost and the broken.
The constant struggle of this life I have chosen.
No hand to guide me, no light in the darkness,
Scared to death but never hopeless.
Push on.
I must push on.
Weâre the spirits of the lost and the broken,
Scared to death but never hopeless.
Iâve lost count of the days, Iâve lost count of the miles Iâve walked this path unpaved.
How much further until the end?
Iâve lost count of the days, Iâve lost count of the miles.
With the world on my shoulders,
I find my fortitude, my composure,
In the hopes that my dreams may come closer,
I wonât stop until this is over.
Push on, push on.
I wonât stop until this is over.
