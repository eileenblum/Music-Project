No sleep âtil sunrise tonight,
Iâll be out on the town forgetting all about it,
Forgetting everything.
Glass half empty or glass half full,
Youâve got nothing to lose when youâve lost it all.
So hereâs to nothing, bottoms up letâs all get fucked,
'Cause i've got nothing left to lose tonight.
Iâve got nothing left to lose.
No sleep âtil sunrise tonight,
Iâll be out on the town forgetting all about it,
Forgetting everything.
Disaronno lips and sunset eyes, baby letâs dance all night,
'Cause i'm not going home 'til the morning light.
Oh I tried so hard to make this right,
But not even the strongest hands can turn back the clock.
Iâm not saying I didnât care, but itâs too fucked up and you donât give a fuck.
Only when youâve lost everything are you free to do anything.
So fuck it all âcause I donât give a fuck anymore,
Fuck it all âcause I donât give a fuck anymore.
Fuck everything.
Bottoms up, letâs get fucked.
