I watched the sunset behind burning buildings,
blue roses apon her deathbed.
I watched the garden we lay in wither and die.
I felt the hour hand pulling the boy out of me.
Yet still he wonders âangel, who pulled the wings from your back?â.
The messenger comes, holds me and whispers:
"i will show you what you have become.
tonight, i will show you how to live againâ¦ 
for we are not the love you seek, we are merely her ghosts -
and if you stay here you will receive the same fate.
but do not fear, in the fields of elysium we will walk together
like ghosts, in this place weâll stay young forever.
thereâs no saving us. thereâs no saving those who donât want to be saved.
so walk with me tonight and i will show you the way, iâll show you how to live againâ¦ tonight.â
I could ask the same questions a thousand times and still never have any answers.
I could walk this circle forever but it would change nothing.
it would change nothing.
