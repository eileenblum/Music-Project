I canât turn a blind eye to the things I have seen.
A heartless empire built on power and greed.
Money and religion all parts of the same machine.
Oh thereâs a difference between the truth and what weâre led to believe,
I beg of you - look further and see.
The storm is getting closer.
Ignorance will be the death of us all.
Wake the fuck up now, weâre running out of time.
If only we had eyes for the blind, ears for the deaf.
To take off the mask, expose the greatest of thefts.
Oh it makes me sick.
When did freedom become a dictatorship?
Tell us only the secrets you want to be told,
Tell us everything is under control.
perhaps a little too much - enslaving all of us.
It doesnât have to be this way.
There is no messiah, no hero. (stop waiting.)
The answer is in all of us, the answer is in you.
