This is my right, this is my time tonight.
Into the night I will ride.
One Life. One chance to prove.
Decide - no more sacrifice.
I will live my life this way, forever.
Donât look away from me âcause I have the answer.
Open your eyes. See these walls youâve built?
They are not real. They donât exist - so walk away from them.
And iâll show you a life worth living.
The door is open now.
Walk through it with me.
This is your right, this is your time tonight.
Into the night you must ride.
One Life. One chance to prove.
Decide - no more sacrifice.
Youâve kept yourself locked inside,
When all along you had the key.
What are you searching for when you have everything you need?
Years on end youâve let this slip by.
But itâs not too late to sayâ¦
No not this time.
I wonât let this slip by.
This world is mine and this is my time.
And you canât change this.
'Cause i'd rather take my one chance and know I didn't make it than never know anything at all.
I remember everything I lost just to live this moment and it was all worth it.
It was all worth it.
Years on end youâve let this slip you by,
But not this time. Open your eyes.
And tell me - what are you searching for?
'Cause it's now or never.
