Iâve been searching all my life
For the right time, for a reason to leave it all behind.
No, Iâm not afraid to die.
Iâm afraid of never being truly alive.
Of never leaving my mark in time.
Iâve been searching my life.
I am the wanderer, the lost boy
And I want to live forever.
Destiny, talk to me, tell me Iâm on the right path.
Show me the way.
This could be it - this could be everything you ever wanted.
I am the lost boy and Iâve found a way to live forever.
Donât look for me âcause Iâm already gone.
Iâve been searching all my life
But tonight I found you.
Out here on the road.
Out here on the road I found
A reason to leave it all behind.
A reason to do this for the rest of my life.
Donât look for me âcause Iâm already gone,
I was the lost boy but now I am found.
I was the lost boy but now I am found.
