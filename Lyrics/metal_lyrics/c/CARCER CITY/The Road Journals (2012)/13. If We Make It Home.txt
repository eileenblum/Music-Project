They say in this city you'll never walk alone.
A thousand miles away I still hear her call.
Come back. Come back to me and breathe slow again.
A thousand miles away I still hear her call.

Wherever we go she waits for us,
To come back and fill the spaces,
Slip into the shapes we've made and left.
She flows in my blood.
She's the air to my lungs.

On every nameless face,
On every street corner,
I see a part of me,
My entire history.
Every victory and every mistake,
Every smile and every heartbreak,
She was watching over me.

They say in this city you'll never walk alone.
A thousand miles away I still hear her call.
Come back. Come back and breathe again.

How I long for the sound of waves on the shore.
The sight of the crown on the riverside.
Cutting lines in the sky.

(If we make it home tonight,
I think I could cure this, I think I could do this all again.
If we make it home tonight...)

Come back to me, Come back to me.
And breathe slow again.
Come back to me, Come back to me.
And you'll never walk alone.

When I see the birds on the horizon.
Her voice resounds inside my head:
"Welcome Home"
