I awake to the weight of regret leaning on me.
And there's no escaping it this time.
There's nowhere to run and hide.
There's nowhere to run.
There's nowhere to hide.
This battle's on the inside.

Its so fucked up.
'Cause my reflection he looks at me, tells me I'm not the man I ought to be.
Help me now, 'cause every day is a battle.

Yeah, legs can take you anywhere...
Except for far from yourself.
Legs can take you anywhere except for far from your selfishness,
That cost the best of you,
Cuts me clean in two.

The hardest battle I ever fought was with myself.

Come on and show me what you got.

My reflection he looks at me, tells me I'm not the man I ought to be.
Help me now, 'cause every day is a battle.

Fuck it.

This time, there's nowhere to run.
There's nowhere to hide.
No, this time there's nowhere to run.
There's nowhere to hide.
This time.

So this is it. I'm writing off everything.
You know I hate you for what you did.
I wish I could forget what you did.
But only one of us can live.
And the gun is in your hands.
This is death as an act of creation.

So this is it. I'm writing off everything.
I let him die and I don't feel bad about it.
So this is it. I'm writing off everything.
This is death as an act of creation.

These are mistakes I have to live with.
