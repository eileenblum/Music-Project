Please do not question what we tell you,
Do exactly as we say and you will make it through
To live another day in lonely paradise.
Release all control to us, sever all conciousness now.
This is what became of us.
Awake yet sedated, our minds saturated.

No, I'll be fine on my own.
I'd rather watch this place fucking burn
Than be a part of this indoctrination.

Everyday I feel it inside my mind,
Singing me sweet little lies.
"Give into the process and become what you despise"
This life is so easy when you're living a lie.

Now I'm screaming from the deepest depths of my lungs,
Where are the winds of change to sing our song unsung?
Where are you now?

And in the silence whispered the last dying breath of the Earth.
If this is all this life is worth then let my own lack of a voice be heard.

So look me in the eye, tell me you feel alive locked in lonely paradise.
Can't you look me in the eye and tell me you feel alive locked in lonely paradise...

So look me in the eye, tell me you feel alive locked in lonely paradise.
You can read the truth between the lies,
You can take my body but not my mind.

No, I'll be fine on my own.
I'd rather watch this place fucking burn.
Let it burn.
