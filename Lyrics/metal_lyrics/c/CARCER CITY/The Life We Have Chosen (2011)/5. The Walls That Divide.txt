The lock of our bodies,
Holding close through the seasons to become legendary.
The clock wore us away,
Left to a life of misery with these ghosts upon my back,
That whisper your name in the dark.
And it pierces right through me tonight.

Straight through the heart.
Eyes locked to the ceiling.
I play the same motions in my mind,
I cannot tear myself away from these hauntings.
Behind the locking doors, I am writing my escape.

Picking up the pieces this has reduced me to.
Now the line is crossed, sick of living between you and the world,
I need the close (I need to know)is this how you want this?
Are these fingertips outstretched for nothing?
I need the close, I need you.
Or the chance to start anew.

Speak to me,
Bring down the walls that have divided us,
If you believe this is worth saving like I do.
Just a few words to instill the way things used to be.
Like strangers meeting under lanterns,
Like you never knew my face.
If only I could bring you back to me.
If only I could sever the strings.
Bring down the walls that divide forever.
