Through glass eyes I watched the world pass us by,
And in time, these roads became our home.
I watched how the cities grew from the horizon.
Then slowly died away as quickly as they had come.

Together we drew a portrait, untouchable.
Waking up to grey static, looking at you,
Through porcelain, laced in dirt.
I am growing weak, but through all this...
I have found the deepest of gratifications.

A portrait untouchable,
This is the life we have chosen,
And I'd chose this for the rest of my life if I could.
I'd chose this over everything.
