And so on goes the battle - down on the rails;
Hading south to find my way out.
This is how I wanted this - no one involved;
This time its me against the world.
Now I'm not searching for answers, I'm not running away.
I'm just taking my time to let the dust settle.
To find my self - to start again.

And now I run the signals chasing for the new horizon I see in the distance.
10:45 at Euston and I feel you draining out of me.
This is mine for the taking.
