Closed eyes for the last time,
And I was sure I was ready for this.
I was so ready for this, but I was wrong.

Closed eyes for the last time.
And I've seen the best of you
And I've seen the worst of you,
Yet when I wake to find blood in your eyes it brings me to my knees.
When I wake to find blood in your eyes it brings me to my knees (to my knees).

And I was sure I was ready for this;
I was so ready for this.
Frail hands upon white sheets, closed eyes, eternal sleep.
All life lost to the bottle (only a matter of time).
But you were dead long before you died.

Closed eyes for the last time.
You were dead long before you died.
As a child your eyes brought me solace;
Now a man I find the mother I knew has faded.
The mother I knew has faded.
And when she left us it changed us all (this place has lost all colour)
This place has lost all colour.

Upon my shoulders I carried you home.
And when I wake to find blood in your eyes
I brings me to my knees.
This brought me to my knees.
