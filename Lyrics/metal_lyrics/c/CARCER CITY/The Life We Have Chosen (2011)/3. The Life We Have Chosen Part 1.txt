Through glass eyes I watched the world pass us by,
Gathering miles, chasing headlights.
Into the maw, into the fray to make our name.
Until our bodies are wasted.

I want something more, I want something more than this.
With eyes close I trace the familiar contours of your face,
And I cannot stand this distance between us.
I want something more than this circular life.

Tonight, under this foreign sky, I will fight for you.
To break the cycle, to be alive.
I have never felt so alive, right now.
Into the fray to make our name.
Into the maw.
