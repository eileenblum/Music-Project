Its hard to sleep with skeletons under your bed.
This was by my hands, the dagger in your back.
This feeling of regret.
These words so hard to speak,
These words I should have said a long time ago.

Every day I wish I had done this differently,
(I'd take it back given the chance)
Given the chance I'd take it back.
You were loyalty, I was a fucking snake.
A callow minded fool, this is my only regret.

Looking back my only regret is the mistake I made with you,
Losing the chance to make amends,
Looking back, this is my only regret.
I'd take it back, given the chance.
