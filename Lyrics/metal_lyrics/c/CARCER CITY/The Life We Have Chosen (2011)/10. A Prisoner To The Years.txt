Touching pen to paper, each time I feel a little closer to the end.
Between the lines a thousand grains of sand lost to the hourglass.
Inside every page, a time I wish I could relive.
Oh how I wish I could relive this all again! (Come back to me!)

See the look that you gave me,
Feel the pain inside my lungs.
Walk the city that never sleeps, erase these fears in me.
The weight of living now holds me down.
Each day it gets harder to put one foot in front of the other.
The struggle of the years has made these cracks in me.

But its a truth I cannot fight,
The sun will set tonight, and I'll not be able to hold on...
Its a truth I cannot fight.
So I let go of the past, and bare with the weight of living now.

Take this one chance to live,
(And) Know that it is to die for.
This is to die for!
