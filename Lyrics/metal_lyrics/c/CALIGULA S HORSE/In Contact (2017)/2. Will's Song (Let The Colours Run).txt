Find me
I could chase the very sun
There could be something left, a little piece of me

Find me
Out there, cast against the waves
Your seven days of peace, and nothing left of me
Find me

Drown
Face down in the water that's meant for me
Soon
One more
Isn't this everything that you asked for?
Drown
No love for the living and empty lungs
Soon
Sing dead sons
It's lights out, give them something to live for

You best run home boy
Before you wear the weight
You can run your mouth at every light
That marks the way...
You best run far boy
With these old bones
I could fill your lungs with the last of my breath
So boy, you best run far

I am the flame that lit the way
You feed and grow by my will
And time breeds only decay?
Oh please, I am that young man still.

Let the colours run,
Lights out, give them something to live for

Breathe while the waves rise,
Fill my lungs, the sacred water
Down, ever down, dive
Will the weight to drag me under

What I still needed to lead me, to save me
Could have been someone, to the wind, soon
Feed it, it's fading to nothing, to ashes,
Feed the beast! Never! To the wind!
Feel it, it could be another triumph
Giving in, over to the wind, soon
Bring me the poison, to lead me, to save me
Like a child, take me to the wind

You best run home boy
Before you wear the weight
You can run your mouth at every light
That marks the way...
You best run far boy
With these old bones
I could fill your lungs with the last of my breath
So boy, you best run far

I am the flame that lit the way
You feed and grow by my will
And time breeds only decay?
Oh please, I am that young man still

Let the colours run
Lights out, give them something to live for.
