Sleeper, let me stay
Bury me here in your arms
Breathing you
Leave my limbs to the lame
I'd open this wound to the world
And I would if I could

You...

If your heaven could find a place
Your world, your words
Too late
Ever human, the sleeper wakes
Your world, your words
Too late

Heal over soon
Heaven help us, here we lay
Heaven help us if we stay

Fearless, let them see
Let it be us and the void
I see you
Stand as one in the fire
Wearing this love, my honour
And I would if I could

You...

If your heaven could find a place
Your world, your words
Too late
Ever human, the sleeper wakes
Your world, your words
It's you
