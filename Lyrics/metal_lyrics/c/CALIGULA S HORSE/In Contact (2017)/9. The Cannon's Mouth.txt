I had all the pieces that I needed
Saw the places in between
You taught me to breathe it all in

And I stood waiting in your welcome shadow
With nothing but the dark below you
I could believe you were light
Into me

And you were the mortar underneath the keystone
Heir to all who could not breathe
You showed them the love in the lie

But I saw the tragedy of life that lingers
Slipping through the city's fingers
Brother, I waited too long
Into me

Into my waiting arms
Promise to meet me there
Help me to find the start
Help me to fill my heart
Into my waiting arms
Building the dream we shared
If I could find the start
If I could fill my heart

Higher, stone by stone
Hollow hope, empty home
Don't look down, boy
We must be the ones
Ashes by us, and it's done
It's your choice, saint or the best, boy

So give me the lightness of a life with no hope
The sight and sound as one, this new home
Tell me that you hear it too
Into me
I could see the end in each beginning
See enough to make the world sing
We heard the music in you
Into me

Into my waiting arms
Promise to meet me there
Help me to find the start
Help me to fill my heart
Into my waiting arms
Building the dream we shared
If I could find the start
If I could fill my heart

You have the choice, saint or the beast
Prove you can be force fed war and spit peace
