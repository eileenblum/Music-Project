Wait, love
For sight as though I never knew that I was blind
Mercy, patience, promises we left behind
All I can hope for is to wake, love
And trembling hands to stillness find their way
Quiet, I can hold my breath
And to hope to god it stays
The hands are the hardest
Always

And sober never shone quite so bright
Colour me blind, just empty glass on canvas

The hands are the hardest

One more
Stare into the dream the dead are begging for
This is what you wanted, feed me, give me all
Deep in the poison, find the cure

When sober gives me spark
I will stand in the light
When sober gives me eyes

I'll sue for peace
These sweet dreams
Sue for peace
These sweet dreams

Love conquers all, you said
But until then, light be damned
And down that hole I dive again

When sober gives me spark
I will stand in the light
When sober gives me eyes

I'll sue for peace
These sweet dreams
Sue for peace
These sweet dreams

This is what you've always wanted
Seeing in colour now
Look at what you made me do
Make me a martyr
This is where our dreams have brought us
Laying me softly down
Look at what you made me do
All for you
This was for our sons and daughters
All for you
Look at where our dreams have brought us
