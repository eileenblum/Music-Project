Never felt like this before,
Like the window in the water,
Worlds of worthy sacrifice,
But you made me feel alive,
Like the light through dreamer's eyes.
I'm taking what I need,

Can't stop what you've begun,
Like can't drown the morning sun again,
Would it kill to let you die for this...

Give it to me,
Can't stop what you've begun,
Give it to me,
Can't drown the morning sunlight,
Crying out, I'm begging you for this.

Leave us to dream the dead
Sing it loud
Legacy means it's over
Sober
Leave us to dream the dead
Sing it loud
Begging to justify and admire it

Dream what I need
And nothing more, no more
No, dream what I need
And nothing more
Give it to me

You've wasted heaven on saving yourself
So give me your broken shadow
So feed me empty echo
Pay me
Pay me what you owe

Can't stop what you've begun
Like can't drown the morning sunlight
Crying out, I'm begging you for this

Leave us to dream the dead
Sing it loud
Legacy means it's over
Sober
Leave us to dream the dead
Sing it loud
Begging to justify and admire it

Give it to me

To build a world for a moment
You have the might to bring the light to life
And then I stood, overcome
For a moment

Can't stop
Show me that I need you
Dream the dead
Can't stop
And that means
I need you

Dream the dead
But you can't stop
Show me that I need you
Dream the dead
But you can't stop
But it showed me it's all we can hope for

We will remember
The colour and the comfort
We lay to rest
The poison's sweet
Just stand and deliver

We will remember
The sorrow in the swan song
Now laid to rest
The poison's sweet
But nothing lasts forever

We will remember
The colour and the comfort
We lay to rest
The poison's sweet
Just stand and deliver

We will remember
The sorrow in the swan song
Now laid to rest
The poison's sweet
But nothing lasts forever
