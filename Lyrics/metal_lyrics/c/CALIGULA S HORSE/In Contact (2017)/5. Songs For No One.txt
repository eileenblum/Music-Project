We are all turning the world...
Just disconnected light
We're learning how to fly
And falling into all the mistakes we couldn't erase
But build me a garden
By god, I will care for it

Oh, heeding the call...
We are the echo's flight
Our arms into the sky
And falling into all the mistakes we couldn't erase
But build me a garden
By god, I will care for it

So let me be enemy to the rise and the racing heart
Let me be hands to the dragging water
Grip when the current starts
Let there be joy in the journey
A lesson we learned in sound
To disconnect from the shadow
I must leave the ground

So let me be enemy to the noose and the fading will
Let me be open arms
Tell the living world I am grateful still
Let me be music then, let me be the joyful sound
I can disconnect from the shadow
I can hear it now

We reach for the longest shadow
We reach for the hidden hurt
We reach for the night
Like we are old light falling to earth
Bring stones for the welcome water
Bring me home again

There's life in a song for no one
Let me grow

We are all turning the wheel
Together we learn to see, soaring just to keep from
Falling into all of the graves we dig on the way
To land in the garden
Light soft where I buried it

So let me be enemy to the noose and the fading will
Let me be open arms
Tell the living world I am grateful still
Let me be music then, let me be the joyful sound
I can disconnect form the shadow
Hear me now

We sing to the weeping widow
We sing to the dying dirt
We sing to the day
That we are old light falling to earth
Bring stones for the welcome water
Bring me home again

There's life in a song for no one
To grow is the garden's worth
There's joy n the journey
We are old light falling to earth
Bring stones for the welcome water
Bring me home.

As we fall into softest soil

Is this one rose enough for you?
And who would tend to a garden that no one sees?
For no one?

See how the sun over calm ocean sings?
This is who I am, my rose
Safe from prying eyes
This is who we are

We are all one with the world
Reconnect your light, we're leaning how to fly
And falling into all the mistakes we couldn't erase
But build me a garden
By god, I will care for it
Oh, heeding the call
We are the echo's flight
Our arms into the sky
And falling into the all the mistakes we couldn't erase
But build me a garden
By god, I will turn the world

We can turn the world
Old light falls
Old light falls
We are all
