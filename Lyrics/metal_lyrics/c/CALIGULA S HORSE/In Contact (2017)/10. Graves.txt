[I. Faint Heart]

Faint heart
World can wait for the weary hands to learn it's too late
But I'm spit and I'm rough dirt
What do you want from me?
Faint heart
Tip of my tongue
A song like youth: wasted on the young
And it's over and over
What kind of father could I be?

Faint heart
Rain to the spark
At last my light, giving in to dark
And the thought of it crumbling to dust - no, I was not done
Faint heart
I beg she won't see the coward, the cur, maybe this is me
These hands shaped stone
But I'm scared like you wouldn't believe

Faint heart
Only a glimpse
I was wrong, take it back, just let this one live

Then it hits me like ice to the bone
What if I'm just like him?
Good god
Give me the strength that I need not to be
To fight, not to flee
Or succumb to the beast underneath
What if he's just like me?
Naked in the wild
All was reconciled
When I held my child

[II. A Few Peaceful Years]

Quiet mind
Peace... Reach...
Quiet mind
Be at peace... Reach...

We are the fire that whispers our mother's words
Help me, love, help me to finish it
We are the soil that joy gave form
We are the dream, and these are my father's hands
Help me, love, help me to finish it
We are the soil that joy gave form

[III. The Boy and the Broken Wheel]

Rising waves cry, "He'll go first..."
He'll go first
(You know it all, all that's left of your dream)
(You know that it is true)
Is all this nothing to you?
(Hope sings to the dust of you)
Fear...
(What if they were right?)
(He was always the better)
He was always the better
(The thief who shapes the world.)
The thief who shapes the images you dreamed
(Dreamed for nothing)
All unfinished dreams...
For nothing
(The images you dreamed were for nothing...)
(Take back what's yours, don't keep me waiting)
(Take back what's yours, don't keep me waiting)
Just take back what's yours, don't keep me waiting
No more hope, broken pieces in your hands
(In your weary hands)
Waves rushing in
I'm waiting
I wait

He sees me
Waves receding
The child, healing my hurt, one day at a time
I'd feared it
Just like me
The child, healing my hurt, one day at a time
Storm's distant
I'm still closer than ever
I'm healing my hurt
One day I'll repay this kindness
Oh, he sees me whole

Her voice is telling me
To breathe and let it be, the lion
Heed my words

The man arise from earth
The life the lie is worth, the liar
Heed my words, you'll go first

The wound that would not heal
The boy, the broken wheel, the lion
Heed my hurt

The wind that whips the waves
The spit, the second grave, the liar
Heed my hurt, you'll go first

We are the fire that whispers our mother's words
Help me, love, help me to finish it
We are the soil that joy gave form
We are the dream, and these are my father's hands
Help me, love, help me to finish it
We are the soil that joy gave form

Waves receding, and faith is fading like the sun
The work left undone

[IV. Hands Shape Stone]

Greed brought us here
Soon, blood to soil

Now that has been taken from me
Tell me it was all for nothing
Alright
Play the part, the eyes, the witness
That I can touch you deep, can you feel this?
Alright

Breathe and let it be

Carving out the world that you stole
Bite down on it, dig a new hole
O hands
I beg you, break stone beneath me
Knowing that she won't forgive me
Not this time, not again
But she married my anger too

And what am I to stay to my son now?
My work undone...
Hands shape stone
Reconcile
