And two of them stood
Damned with the driftwood
Fed by old fire and father's eyes
To leave the machine
No fear for that figurehead
We could have still been brothers then
I know what I said

If two of them stood
Braced for the burden
The never heard, the never learned
To strike at the heart
You dig for your brother
And concord, that coffin nail, will set it right

Even the words as they flow out like water
Are silently begging to turn this page over
And send me home

The two of them stood
A voice across the chasm
Blaming the distance for the dark
Could I refuse?
They can't see the bridge for the blackness
The spite for the start

And even the words as they flow from the fountain
Just like the sun must be missing the mountain
So give me distance, a sky without tether
But it was the chasm that brought us together
Connect...

If only I could squeeze blood from that stone
Fill my heart...
And let my cup with this peace overflow
Fill my heart...

Brother, send me home
Reach through this fire
Let the blood send me home

Home...

And even the words as they flow from the fountain
Just like the sun must be missing the mountain
So give me distance, a sky without tether
But it was the chasm that brought us together
