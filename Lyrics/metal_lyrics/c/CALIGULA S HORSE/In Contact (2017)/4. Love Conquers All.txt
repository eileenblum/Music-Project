Need some time to make it right
O mountain mine, I lost my fight
O mountain mine, just give me time

The beast that I have become
Could set me free of this
If only I had the time
If only these hands were mine
Without the muse in my lungs
Without her sweet taste on my tongue
I don't need the strength to fight
Only to stand in the light
For a little while...

Need some time to make it right
Please
