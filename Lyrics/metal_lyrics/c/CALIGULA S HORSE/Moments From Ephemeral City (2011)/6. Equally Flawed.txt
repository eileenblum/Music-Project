[Lyrics by Sam Vallen]

His figure benighted
By revelation on his face
Beyond all refutation

And I understand his intentions
But donât say a word

His smile itâs hiding
A purpose veiled
Beyond my comprehension
Subtle condescension
I let him walk inside

Weâre all born equally flawed
Into a world of closed doors
This we accept despite question or reason
To save our souls

But I wonât take your force-fed dogma

I donât want mindless conjectures
On natureâs objectives

My mind wonât adhere to your silence!

You see the world without flaws
Itâs a lie without cause
Insignificant when allâs said and done
But itâs no less inspiring

And I donât care how you say god loves

Laws will remain - and will forever
Until the universe contracts again

He neednât exist for the world to be
