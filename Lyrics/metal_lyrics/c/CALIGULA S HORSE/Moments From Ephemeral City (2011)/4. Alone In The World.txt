[Lyrics by Sam Vallen]

Youâre gone
Youâre lost in a world of your own design
Alone,
Humanityâs long since been left behind

And would you believe that I once felt your pain?
(Although itâs far behind me now)
It seems so strange to me that in pain you still believe

And I see a light ahead
A template for all my ambitions
Life lays bare before
Meaning disinterred
Iâm welcoming my liberation

Moral,
You call me what you will and cast me away
I know
And in the depth of my ignorance Iâm not afraid

And would you believe that I once felt your pain?
It seems so strange to me that in pain you still believe

And I see a light ahead
A template for all my ambitions
As a new day dawns
On an empty world
Iâm welcoming my liberation

Iâm alone in the world
A husk fading petty and destined
And I stay my mind
From futile tries at
Reaching for exoneration

Iâm lost in the stars above
Consumed in my reflection
Distracted from my condemnation
They join me in consciousness

I canât
Remember a time when days flickered
Like their cold light
Care passed like season
And love was free of all reason.

My reason is as trivial as senses pervaded by a final nostalgic scent
I inhale once more
Knowing the dreams I wonât live donât matter

(Leave It Behind)
