[Lyrics by Jim Grey &amp; Sam Vallen]

We wait
Close your eyes
Breathe in deep

Weâve met before
Your empty wall
No proof you ever existed
Paint your shadow if it brings you some small comfort
âI am still hereâ

The man who stood
Above the world
Learnt to fail
Is not to fall
Returns with two feet to the ground to say
âFuck you, Iâve seen you
And you are very smallâ

âBe at peaceâ
He said â Itâs all in your head

We wait
Close your eyes
Breath in deep

Donât be afraid
Everything ends
So sing hallelujah
Weâre all dead anyway
Your perfect worldâs a fake

You are alive
Youâre breathing still
The liars tell you itâs not the end
Theyâre only dreaming
Youâll be joining them soon
But I am still here

You are light
Just bathed in skin
Wait for what the world could give or take my hand
And stand with two feet to the ground and say
âFuck you, Iâve seen you
And now I understandâ

He said
âItâs all in your headâ

We wait
Close your eyes
Breath in deep

Donât be afraid
Everything ends
So back you lay
It was all in your head anyway
Your perfect worldâs a fake
