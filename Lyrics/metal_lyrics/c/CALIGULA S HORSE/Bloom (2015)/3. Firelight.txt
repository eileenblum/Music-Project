The stars will fade, the sun will rise,
But I'll remember you were my firelight.
The lucky ones, we were born,
We will not be here for long.

Been waiting on a sign of life,
An "everything is alright".
Gone with the sun.
Voices as one.
And in the moment we will carry that light on.

This is for the ones who burned so short, and so bright.
I have never been so sure.
You're firelight.
How could this all last,
When we burn so brightly?
Friends, give me your hands,
Raise your voices with me.
We'll escape like spark and shadow,
Knowing that the world will end.
I will say, "The stars will fade,
The sun will rise, but I'll remember you were my firelight."

This is for the ones who burned so short, and so bright.
I have never been so sure.
You're firelight.
How could this all last,
When we burn so brightly?
Friends, give me your hands,
Raise your voices with me.

How could this all last,
When we burn so brightly?
Friends, give me your hands,
And remember with me.
