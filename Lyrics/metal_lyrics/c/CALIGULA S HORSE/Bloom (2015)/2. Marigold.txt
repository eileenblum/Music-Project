Take it all,
I never needed any more than days on days and gentle nights
When nothing could stop me.

Keep it safe,
Taking secrets to the grave.

When I was the king,
Just for that one day,
When nothing could stop me.

Feed my soul.
Force a smile.
Ignore the hole,
Wishing like hell that I was still god,
With nothing above me.

Read my eyes,
Weary lines.
Taking what's mine,
Just soil below and nothing above me.

Feed my soul, marigold.
I'd rather starve than choke what's killing me down...

Give me heresy.
We were never told the truth...
The world that spoke, calm these hands,
Before they can reach your throat.
Give me eyes to see her never growing old.
Good news!
They hope you choke!
Take heart.
It's all fool's gold...
Leave me there.
Pockets full of empty air
Paying my penance, curse this prayer,
Regret never touched me.
She will stay, dressed in choices that I made.
Head like a king, but crown like a gravestone, don't touch me, feed my soul. marigold.

I'd rather starve than choke what's killing me down...

Give me heresy.
We were never told the truth...
The world that spoke, calm these hands,
Before they can reach your throat.
Give me eyes to see her never growing old.
Good news!
They hope you choke!
Take heart.
It's all fool's gold...

With these hands, I could change the world.
More than gold, more that I deserve.
With these hands, I could change the world.
I am a wealthy man, I am loved.
Tell me hope's not lost.
Soon you'll see I can't take it with me.
When to nothing I fade, gone, borne by the choices I made.
Wake up, wake up, and soon you'll see that all hope is not lost.
Not gone.
