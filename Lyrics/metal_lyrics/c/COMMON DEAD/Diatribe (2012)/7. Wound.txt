Silent remorse
True solace absent
Missing dearly
Mourning in daze
I'm stripped of faith
It's a major loss, it's a major wound to bear
The kind that doesn't fade, the kind that doesn't heal
Here I stand with your remains
I always intended to reach out again
I see now I have no control over anything
I'm stripped of faith again
It's a major loss, it's a major wound to bear
Forced to move on without you
Without you
It's a major loss, it's a major wound to bear
The kind that doesn't fade, the kind that doesn't heal
Here I stand with your remains
Rest in peace
