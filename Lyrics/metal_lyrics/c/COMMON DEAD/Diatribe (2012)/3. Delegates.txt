"Kill", everyone says on the defense
Flogging their own kind to death
Losing more than blood and sweat
Ammunition spreads the waste
Gasping for air, the solider said to me
"Take a look around. War is everywhere."
Son carries the flag, carries his gun
Bearing the sins of his father
Everyone will pay the price
But calibration has no cost
The man who says aloud "everyone's the same"
Doesn't life afar, he lives inside of us
He's the one to fear, he's the one to die
Home's a battlefield
War is everywhere
For a moment, there was peace
For a moment, I saw God
We weren't foes, we were friends
What the hell happened?
Some will fight 'til the bitter end
For a moment, there was peace
For a moment, I saw God
Where you feel safe, it may never last
Take a look around
War is everywhere
