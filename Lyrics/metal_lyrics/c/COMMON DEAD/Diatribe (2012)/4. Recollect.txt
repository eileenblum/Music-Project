One more statement
I'm not crazy, yet you think so
You are the same: desperately escaping
My grieving
Life in the now
All the world was fine back then
What a lie I choose to tell
Cherishing memory of a younger me
When fresh air and landmarks mattered the most
A perfect place and time
Only now that life has gone all wrong
Editing history
Rewinding
Salvage the tape
Escaping tormenting
Turn lights off
Travel in time
I realize it's romanticizing the past
I know better, there was always death,
there was always conflict, there was always loss
But I didn't know it yet
Neither did you, so remember that
As you stomp your victim, you are stomping a child
Don't lay this guilt trip on me
I didn't ask for any of this
How would I like it instead? I don't know,
but better than this shit
Maybe what I want only exists in my head
Maybe it does! So pad the goddamn cell!
Leave me to my memories!
One day I'll have to lay myself to rest
Get your hands off
Don't you touch me
Let me stay here
Chasing a ghost
Watching then
Moving on, holding on
Where does it all stop?
One day I'll have to lay myself to rest
Sleep, child
Just sleep
