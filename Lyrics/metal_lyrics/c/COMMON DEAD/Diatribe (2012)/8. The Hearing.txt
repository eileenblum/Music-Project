I've killed everyone in here!
You're deadâ¦ you just don't know it yet!
Ranting inhibitions! Ranting inhibitions!
I've killed everyone in here!
You're deadâ¦ you just don't know it yet!
Poisoned philosophy, a rant and a killing spree
I hate in exchange of the glares from gravely uninformed
Should another to the same, I say he's wrong to
But it's me in my own head, defending my own rage
Poisoned philosophy, a rant and a killing spree
Unfair and biased in a fit to reach the top
When out of victims and drive, I'll do like my father:
Get drunk with some pain pills, and die!
I've killed everyone in here!
You're deadâ¦ you just don't know it yet!
Ranting inhibitions! Ranting inhibitions!
I've killed everyone in here!
You're deadâ¦ you just don't know it!
