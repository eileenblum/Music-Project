Patient, reckless
All in and boundless
I doubt all things
End in my eye now
I choose to live
For what reason, I don't get it
Yet I choose to live
Should I die, don't regret it
A reason hides for everything
My art left behind
A reason hides for everything
Question the meaning
Reprise unheard
Inveigh my passion
Never too late for proliferation
You choose to live
For what reason, you don't get it
Yet you choose to live
Nearing death, don't regret it
A reason hides for everything
Your art's left behind
A reason hides for everything
