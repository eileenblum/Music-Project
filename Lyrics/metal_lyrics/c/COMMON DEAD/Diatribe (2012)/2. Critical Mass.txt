Futile, wasted, fallout
Blasting the decent and thinking you're better
You're no one
Spare us your glaring and judgmental thinking
You know not
One more self-entitled faker
Just a smartass without wit
Fake laughs don't hide all, you know
You don't impress anybody
Who's secure and well aware
Misplaced ego, undeserved
(You are nothing! You are nothing!)
Futile, wasted, fallout
Washed up tweaking failure
Blasting the decent and thinking you're better
You're no one
Spare us your glaring and judgmental thinking
You know not
Nothing completed and hating yourself
Because you're weak
No self-perception, I want nothing more than youâ¦
Burned!
