Thinking too much alone again
Watching all in disgust again
Just enough heart I have to care
Not enough to forgive your crime
I don't need any goddamn statute
I have my own ethos
This is what I've come to believe
You'll get what you have given
I am God, I am Hell
Who has the right to justice?
Popular opinion? Trial and a verdict?
Call of a vigilante
Who has the right to justice?
Voting majority? Trial and a verdict?
Call of a vigilante for all
For the victims, live or deceased
I dedicate passion
For defenseless you have torn
I will tear you to pieces
I am God, I am Hell
("In a mad world, only the mad are sane")
Who has the right to justice?
Popular opinion? Trial and a verdict?
Call of a vigilante
Who has the right to justice?
Voting majority? Trial and a verdict?
Call of a vigilante
For all you've harmed
For those disgraced
For those ignored
No one will think it's fantasy
When the bodies are piling
I'm no hero, not a villain
So what the hell am I?
I'm just one
You're just one
Take 'em down!
