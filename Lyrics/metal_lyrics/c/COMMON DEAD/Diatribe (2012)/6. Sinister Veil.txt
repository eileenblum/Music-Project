Dreams built for kings by those who live nightmares
In a land where liars own the truth
Civil unrest, a rare devotion
And everyone just follows along
Working hard and no reward
Face all that fell as moving towards regret
Those in charge say "be responsible"
Excuses made to steer the blame
And everyone just follows along
Well, someone's always watching you
If you dare: never kill without a plan
Uprise or fail
Sinister veil
Uprise or fail
Now you know what's coming to ya'
Another day, another dollar
Because you're told it's worth it
Uprise or fail
Sinister veil
Uprise or fail
