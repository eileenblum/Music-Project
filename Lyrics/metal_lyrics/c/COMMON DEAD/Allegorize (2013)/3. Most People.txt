I can integrate, but only to a limit
Overpopulate, not enough to go around
Just play along and you'll succeed
Just pay your dues
They're fucking lying to you
I am not the best, but few are ahead of me
Sometimes I'm in check
Other times, an egotist
Make trade, make cash
Fit in at last, just to distract
Just play the song and you'll succeed
Just pay your dues
You're fucking full of shit
I don't need to integrate
I hate the facts, I hate the game
I hate belief, I hate your faith
I hate your face, I'm gone
I fake my soul
I don't mean to hate
I guess it comes naturally
Make trade, make cash
Fit in at last, just to distract
Just pick a side and you'll succeed
Just pay your dues
Fuck you
