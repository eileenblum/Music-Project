If you want, educate alternatives
If you want, we can kill them collect
Make a sound, you have tipped off everyone
Look around, now they're waging a war
If you want, we can take down popular
If you want, we can blind them with facts
Make it sound too loud, they will shut you out
Look around at their ignorance
If you want, educate alternatives
If you want, maybe they'll open their eyes
Make a sound, I gave up on reasoning
Look around, I gave up on hope
If you want, take the torch and carry on
If you want, take and bury the worth
Make it sound, I am leaving everything
Look around, I am killing me
Allegorize all I know, whatever it be
The modern obsolete
Value is contrived
If you want, educate alternatives
If you want, maybe they'll open their eyes
Make it sound, I gave up on reasoning
But you don't dare give up on me
