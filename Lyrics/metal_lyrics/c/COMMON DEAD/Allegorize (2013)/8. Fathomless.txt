None of my answers
Satisfy questions
Everyone's theories
Never could speak for me
Paradoxes never ending
And I'm dead, that's my name
Pain, that's my name
Since the beginning
Shattering slowly
Burning all bridges
Maybe you're better off
To forget me
Keep what I've done
And I'm gone
Hard to find
Free, again, all at once
Anywhere is the same
Time all at once
But hope, hard to find
Why?
