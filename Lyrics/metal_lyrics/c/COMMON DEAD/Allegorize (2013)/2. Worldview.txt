You're only living once
What don't you understand?
Can't change the world in a day
Mortal fears fan the flames
Unconscious energy
Is all you may ever be
Can't change the world in a day
So they choose to throw it all away
My only crime in your eyes
Trade deception, exchange for pride
Praise bigotry on all who sleep, but never I
They want you fucking dead
What don't you understand?
Can't change the world in a day
All belief is just a game
I want you fucking dead
What don't I understand?
Can't change the world in a day
But I'll try to do it anyway
My only crime in your eyes
Trade deception, exchange for pride
Praise treachery on the weak, but never I
I'm a legion, on my own
No one needs me, no one knows
Can't change the world in a day
I don't like it here anyway
