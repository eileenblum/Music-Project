One bleeding, all the others follow
Clueless in the hollow
Too aware, stepping out of line
Forget the claim of crime
Drink poison, slowly through your eyes
Just as they've designed
Those awake maybe know the answer
Never care to tell
Lights, perfect times, out of time
Rage taking me out of mind
Only I can finish this
