It's you I abhor, lost in the fire
Set in the quiet, a cause and effect
Dragged down weight, you always want more
How do you live? Knowing so little and living so glib?
You are the problem
Losing control, urges are rising
I won't remember anything
I would not feel anything
Suffer, as I have
You always want more, lost in the fire
Match? No match, you set it yourself
Dragged down youth
Now you overbreed with curses and killers
How do you live? Knowing so little and living so glib?
You are the problem
Losing control, we must remove them
I won't remember anything
I would not feel anything
Nobody took away anything
That was you!
Knowing so little and living so glib
You are the problem
Now suffer, as I have
