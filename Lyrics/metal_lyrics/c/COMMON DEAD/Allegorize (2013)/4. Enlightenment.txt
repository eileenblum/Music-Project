Winded and failing on a standard of life
Beckoning rivals for war on another day
All of the angels will crumble and see
They are the demons defending tragedy
We are alone, covered in dirt
Begging for reason, logic and might
Picking a faith as a plea for reward
Deeper inside, you know that it doesn't work
Follow equations of matter and space
Trust not a witness, trust what is verified
We are alone, covered in dirt
Bearing our anger, wisdom and dare
Share what you know
This is what I believe in
And it takes no believing
It's a science and changing
While the meek are denying
With the wealth that is flaunted
We could cure all the haunted
Yet the faithful are lying
To preserve all the fear
