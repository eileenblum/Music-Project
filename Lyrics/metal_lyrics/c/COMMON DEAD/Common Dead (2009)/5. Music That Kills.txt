This obsession I cannot hide
Cannot hide misdirected hatred
And I can't help but override
Override considered consciousness
If you stay here, I might kill ya'
I might kill ya
Physically or otherwise, blatant aggression,
I know it's cliche
But just go Take with you what you can
If you don't wanna see yourself thrashed
Take with you what you can
And the fuck right outta' here
I am constantly criticized
Criticized behind my back, I know
Don't you act like you're so surprised
So surprised if I got a bone to pick
Lashing out at everyone
Everyone who's with or without me
Let me play the song, I know it's cliche
But just go
Back down, stay back
Take comfort in the fact there is death
(I will fuck you up! 2, 3, 4)
I love blasting the sound of my raw despise
I could have the world and still have this hate
Give me the music that kills
It's the only thing keeping me
From killing you motherfuckers physically
When all else seems to fail
Give me the music that kills!â¨
