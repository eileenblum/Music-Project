Nothing. No one. No love. Ever.
I tried to communicate
Try to affiliate
No love equals hate
Even amongst rejects, I'm a fucking reject
Grab on to desires
I am an anomaly
Crippling anxiety
Innocently watching all you take for granted
Changes never mattered
Cursed from the start with nothing

No one
No love
Ever
Fuck you!
Chronic, this solitude is chronic!
I torture myself every day and night
Over what I can't have
Insanity
No love
No one
Ever.
