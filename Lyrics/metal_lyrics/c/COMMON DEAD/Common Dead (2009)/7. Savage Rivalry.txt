Oh shit! Bodies rising! Climates clashing!
Everyone is broke!
Watch them all freak out! Leap out windows!
Trained for years to compete for garbage!
I can't wait for the day you see
You've been wasting your time with this pursuit
You think you're so smart but you don't know shit
Only greed, you will get what you deserve
Fine! You wanted to compete?
Well this is me competing
I'm well aware
It's me against the world!
You wanted to compete?
Well this is me competing
I'm well aware
It's me against the
"World's gonna die, world's gonna die, world's gonna die" STOP
"World's gonna die, world's gonna die, world's gonna die"
Fuck this place
I am one of many but I don't have a team
So I scream and make songs by myself
I cannot compete civilly so I freak out
Time to time, maybe bomb a fucking place
There's no difference between them
Bitches lie, assholes cheat, and they all just want a piece
Fuck them, kill them, watch them die, take my life
I don't care, I'm a victim, you're a victim, too!
It's me against the world!
Bring it, bitch!
Same shit, day to day
Man, I hate this fucking place
Lies, fakes, and deceit
It's a savage rivalry
Life? It's a savage rivalry!
