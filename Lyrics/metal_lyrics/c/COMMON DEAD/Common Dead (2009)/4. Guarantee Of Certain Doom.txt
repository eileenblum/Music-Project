No belief in fate, falling further away
Tempting thoughts are surreal
Time erases not all wounds, I'm walking proof
You don't always reap what you sow!

Nothing to see, no one to hold
Can't ever be with you
No one better push me lest you're ready die
And now I'm willing to die
That means you too
Spent my whole life preparing for death
In wastelands of hatred when I am denied
To change the way I think about you
Can't change the way I feel these days
I've changed by guarantee of certain doom
Slay the want to feel, falling further away
Disconnected, I'm cold
Time erases not all wounds, I'm walking proof
You don't always reap what you sow!
Attitudes change, morphing by certitude
Yet people remain the same
Every day they say I ought to be more responsible
Be more responsible?Â 
Well what about you?
Don't test me now
There is no going back
Yeah sure, I'm irresponsible
Not you, right?
