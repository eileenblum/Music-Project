Careless loss of dreams
Dreams that never breathe
Moments in which I obsess

You don't know the things I'm thinking
Glimpses of yesterday
Throw them all away
Distractions that hold me back
You don't know the things I'm thinking
You don't know the things I'm thinking
You haven't got the slightest clue of who I am
You âthinkâ, now hold that thought, think again!
Jealous bitterness
Once whole, now emptiness
Always surrounding me
You don't know the things I'm thinking
Deaf, blind, and dumb they all are
Fill me with righteous moods
Tempted to obliterate
Save your praises for another day
Nothing was achieved today
Victory is overrated
Holding on to memories as they fade
Watch yourself, you're too nostalgic
You might lose your goddamn mind!
I should know... I should know...
You might lose your goddamn mind!
