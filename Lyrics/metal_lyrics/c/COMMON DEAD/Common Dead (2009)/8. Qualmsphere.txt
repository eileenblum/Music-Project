Neurotic psychosis, forging alternatives
My life and failures become your problem
When I embrace calamity
Follow examples of rivals before me
With them I identify
Another of many
Yet nobody's with me
And I'm alone here
Deviating
Within the siren of fear
Burned from lights you never saw
Lost your voice and lost your mind
Bleed
I've made a deal with no one
Bleed
I'm too wise for my own good
Bleed
It's all they want me to do is
Bleed
And now you're going to suffer
Suffer me
No control but still in pain 
Fear exists but not like yours
Scarred for life and never right
Hear the voice I cannot find...
