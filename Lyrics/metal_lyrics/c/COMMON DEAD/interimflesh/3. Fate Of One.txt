Jaded, I've seen it all
What's the reward for pain? 
Analyze
Casualty walking by
In my reality what is God?
Always reaching

For what can't be reached
Begging, pleading
Get me out of here! 
Sentimental
Driving myself insane
I can never settle
My last words: live free or die
I say I'm bleak but I'm not wrong
You, me, dead
Always reaching
For what can't be reached
Begging, pleading
Get me out of here!

Get me off this rock!
Can't you see...
Nothing really dies
Dry your eyes
We are the cosmos
Nothing really dies
I promise you
See you on the other side
I am, I was 
It's all I really know
What I feel
Is better than what I'm told
Talking about my suicide and I'm fine
I'm fine
Nothing in this life
Nothing really dies
We are the cosmos
Nothing really dies
I promise you
See you on the other side
I am, I was
It's all I really know
What I feel
Is better than what I'm told
