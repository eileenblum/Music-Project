No one thinks, no one feels, anymore
Comment if you want to
I was one of the few with respect
And now I've lost my mind
Seek it out, take away what I want
No abide, no one's right
Animal, deep inside, tolerance
I do not have at all (yeah!)
Constant crave, all observe, few complain
Comment if you want to
Total lust, carnal rage, no restraint
Is there any meaning? 
Come on now baby
And scream when you need again
Come on now baby
I scream when I need again
Come on, girl...
