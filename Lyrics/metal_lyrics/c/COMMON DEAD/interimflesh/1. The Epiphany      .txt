I look up to the sky
Regressing in my mind
And time has passed me by
So much was left unsaid
No closure, just regrets
Sometimes it takes my breath

But then I realize
I was who I was
I did the best I could
So say you think you know
I'm burning as a soul
Epiphany here
Apologies where they apply
As I try to disregard "what ifs"
That haunt me every night
And no one understands
But I don't need them to
Just please do not assume
It's all happening at once
I question what is now
The pain may never end
Don't let your eyes deceive you
My strength transcends interim flesh
Apologies where they apply
As I try to disregard "what ifs"
That haunt me every night

I was here
This "nihilist"
Don't let your eyes deceive you
My strength transcends interim flesh
Apologies where they apply
As I try to disregard "what ifs"
That haunt me every night
