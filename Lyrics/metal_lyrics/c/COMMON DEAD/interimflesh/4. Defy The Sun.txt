Cursing reason
Victim of treason
Outnumbered by the mold
Can't live,
can't sleep
Numb hate in one spree
Push me, you get results
And now you
motherfuckers want a piece?
Too bad I'm packing heat
Irate, I devastate 
Everyone I see
All I see are targets
And I got nothin' to lose
Payback's a bitch
And now it's making you mine
You... couldn't get away!
I struggle to see another way
I guess I'm resorting to
Kill against the odds!
Fuck it all!
To take and not give, you better see
That some of us resort to 
Kill against the odds!
Fuck it all!
I defy the sun
Anger defined
Above the wretched kind
Carnage, my last resort
Crossing choices
Silence the voices
That caused the slaughter
And now you motherfuckers want a piece? 
Too bad I'm packing heat
Irate, I devastate
Everyone I see
All I see are targets
And I got nothin' to lose
Fuck you and fuck you
And baby, fuck you too!
You... couldn't get away!
I struggle to see another way
I guess I'm resorting to
Kill against the odds!
Fuck it all!
To take and not give, you better see
That some of us resort to
Kill against the odds! 
Fuck it all!
I defy the sun
You know who you are...
You know who you are...
Naming the names
In blood and vein
The killing urge that pulls me and says: 
You do what you gotta' do
