Why should i suffer from the choices you made
it wasn't the plan that you'll be the person i hate
to sum it up we've never been so close
made up an idea to have something to hold

You are the one to blame
i show no mercy
no tolerance
you are the one to blame
no mercy

swallowing everything that i love
nothing left but anger and strife
as time goes by we are growing older
it seems like I never felt colder
I always thought that isolation is a curse
but with you on my side it could'nt get any worse

stop telling stories of a book you've never read
please don't repeat the words i said
stop stepping in footprints you'll never fit
your mind in chains
