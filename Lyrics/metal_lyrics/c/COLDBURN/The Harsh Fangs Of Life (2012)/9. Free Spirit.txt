a lonely spirit guides me through these troubled times
too late for me to hide from the crap that defines my life
but i do things on my own, follow no one, try to break free
this way helped me grow stronger
and the spirit in which i believe will remain forever strong

free spirit

I use my spirit to numb the pain
to handle fears and overcome
the free spirit to survive in this fight
struggle alone to win i won't fall in line

from my childhoods hour I haven't been as others were
I haven't seen like others saw
I could not get my passion from a common spring
receive my strength from anger and rage
from thunder and storm
in which I'll try to find my home
and all I loved I loved alone

I'm sick of all the hate
I'm sick of all those talking shit
I'm sick off all you backstabbers
I'm sick of all you fair-weather friends

in every move I made
I follow no one, I'll strike hard
in every move I made
I do things on my own
Free Spirit
