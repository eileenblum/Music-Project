You can tell from these scars that life ain't fair
in the night this turns into hell
Your sweet voice, it starts to fade
this love has been replaced by hate
like a bird in a cage, a tiger in a cell
I will never feel alive, I will never feel well

sometimes I wonder why I feel no thrill
my lungs are plagued
life is still ill

and all the pressure that helped me to grow
overwhelms me and drags me down this flow
i can't handle myself, makes my life pass by
too long i've been alone - isolation made me shy
i try to escape till my hands start to vein
forgot the reason that forced me in those chains

sometimes I wonder why I feel no thrill
my lungs are plagued
life is still ill
life gives me the chills

I live a life without a heart
I sold my soul right from the start
life is short - death clock ticks
i've chosen my grave - grim reaper digs
