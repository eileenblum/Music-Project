the lights go out
the city sleeps tonight
the sound of silence, feel walls whispering loud

I admire you when the sun is dreaming quietly
streetlights let the awkward shine bright
shadows running fast, frightened to get punished from the light

I'm not afraid of the sun but i don't like how you change
by the end of the night - with the start of dawn

in the daylight faces look so bright
plastic smile! I do not fit in living a hollow life
sharing this place by day with these judging eyes
dead lanterns bring back to mind -
feeling home in the street lights

i walk relentless through my play
you're the stage: a cold and calm paradise,
my potential escape into the life

cause no one can take away your stories
no one can steal these memories
you talk to me, still by my side
one steady fellow through the night

so i don't even care
your words and hands can't tie me down
I can stand the times of pain
the scars I earn, the names I own
the dirty things I smell foremost
the city writes its stories down
the memories are mine
