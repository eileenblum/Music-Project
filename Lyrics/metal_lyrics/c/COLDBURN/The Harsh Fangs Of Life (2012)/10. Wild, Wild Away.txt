I don't belong here
I wanna run away
run away to find my peace
far away from trouble and worries
find me among wild winds
among the waves, among wild flowers
i belong somewhere i feel free

the weight of your words
the weight of the world
it's all crashing down on me
but I still won't be what you wan't me to be
'cause I'm free

never fit into your world
I gotta run away to fight my war
I run away on search for love
let my heart be my guide
'till now i haven't seen anything
to keep up with me
that belongs to the place where i feel free

the weight of your words
the weight of the world
its all crushing down on me
but I still won't be what you want me to be
'cause I'm free
