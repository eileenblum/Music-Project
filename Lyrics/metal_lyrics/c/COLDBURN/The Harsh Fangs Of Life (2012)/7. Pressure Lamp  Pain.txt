from the beginning to the end
losers lose, winners win
this is real we aint got nothing to pretend
the cold world that we are in
is full of pressure and pain

distances, reachless like a pot of gold
my hard feelings i wished your heart could hold

those secrets that were meant to keep
your words still ring in my ears, keeping me from sleep

breathing is not easy if the truth holds you down
trying to forget you, no inner peace to be found

[in those moments] i feel like my mind is locked
you swallowed my mental key
it's to hard to admit

that signs are fading, pictures are shading, the devil's raiding
