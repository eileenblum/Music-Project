Oh, it hurts that we canât take the easy way out,
So (that) you could just tell me lies
Day by day the horrors grow and our future dies
Oh, it hurts that I can still feel what I canât say
Shed tears put out the blaze that lighted my way
I need this feeling of loss cause when I lose it I wonât feel alive
Go on, call me crazy and brace the walls Iâm in
But I am feeling blessed with my inner strife
How can I stand with both feet safe and sound
when my views are always upside down
Yeah, you keep dragging me deeper and deeper
Into those waters of madness
In which I will drown
While you pointed your gun on the failures youâve found
I took the whole damn ride with my face down on the ground
Your words are nothing but hollow tips through my heart
In the end lifeâs a play in which we both take part
I need this feeling of loss âcause when I lose it I wonât feel alive
Go on, call me crazy and brace the walls Iâm in
But I am feeling blessed with my inner strife
Go on, call me crazy brace the walls Iâm in
Forever stuck in this feeling of loss
Fountain of fantasy, the original sin
