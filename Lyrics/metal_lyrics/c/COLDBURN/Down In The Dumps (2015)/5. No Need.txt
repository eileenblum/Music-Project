You act like you know what tomorrow will bring
while I still wonder how to shut your face
Talking over and over about all the things
(That) happened around us in a sea of snakes
Iâve been there, drunk the water and tasted the poison
For me the reason to leave
I knew it was time to move on
Cutting off the ties, all I want to achieve
I donât wanna say Iâm sorry
Cause thereâs no need to excuse
I permeated the mystery
The hollow coats, mirrors of a world I refuse
I just hope the bridges I burn will be the ones that light me the right way
And that the antidote which reaches my veins wonât paralyse my limbs
The fuse in place, please do not change, you just might be the vital spark
Looking back, I always tried to understand
wrong words thatâve been declared
everyone seemed blind or have I been wrong?
questions to myself, unheard
but to stay there without answers
clarified what I always wanted to see
So Iâll become your fiend,
the gate has closed down for good
I donât wanna say Iâm sorry
Cause thereâs no need to excuse
I permeated the mystery
The hollow coats, mirrors of a world I refuse
