My head is in the dirt so I canât see a light
My thoughts are way too dark to escape the night
how would you feel about painting skulls on our faces
to pretend that somethingâs dead
that never felt alive
that never truly lived
Letâs build a burial ground,
Burn all our answers
to find more questions (to which) we canât reply
'Cause itâs us against the world,
me against you, me against myself
Iâll meet you at the burial ground
Still I keep the devils inside
Force them into these walls of sound
Iâll bury the pain of being nice
'Cause after I raised all those expectations
I found them six feet underground
I used to be afraid of the dark
The fear of losing control
Since darkness has got its hold on me
My worries turned into distant memories
the hell I raised is about to break free
Oh, I waited for that time my friend
Now weâre going down together
Letâs celebrate the end
Letâs build a burial ground,
Burn all our answers
to find more questions (to which) we canât reply
'Cause itâs us against the world,
me against you, me against myself
Iâll meet you at the burial ground
The things that should stay
Are the ones that foolishly fade away
