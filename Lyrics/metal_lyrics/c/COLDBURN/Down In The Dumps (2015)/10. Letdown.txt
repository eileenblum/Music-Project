The arrow is broken I donât know how to follow
directions lost, all safe roads have been shut down
I traveled back and forth just to find my confidence dead
I know I have to move on
So many options to choose from, just a letdown ahead
Oh brother, please tell me whatâs my malfunction
feels like the devil just cut my throat so he cut the junction
my blood is poisoned by a strange disease
I canât change, say Iâm dead, let me find my peace
to improve means to change
to be perfect means to change more often
the desire for weakness is starting to soften
trying to escape became such a routine
by all means these chains are too tight
so what should I do
I was there before I even knew
to improve means to change
to be perfect means to change more often
you might call it cliche
but thatâs the game that people play
so brother, look what Iâve become
follow the tracks of how I came undone
so brother, look what Iâve become
follow tracks of how I came undone
please tell me whats my malfunction
feels like the devil just cut my throat so he cut the junction
my blood is poisoned by a strange disease
I canât change, say Iâm dead, let me find my peace
