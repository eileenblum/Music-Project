The stash â where everything is far from any value
The hole â where nothing is what it seems
The gloom â source of my pain
The torch that lights the fires inside of my head
Iâm talking about that place of silence
The one I picked out from all the bloody islands
Where no one knows your smell
And also the rats donât have nothing to tell
My name goes up in smoke
My death a joke
Even plagues got no more throats to choke
My name goes up in smoke
My death a joke
Even plagues got no more throats to choke
It was a long way to reach this spot
The steps I took by myself, the miles I left behind
The secret place I call my own
You do not understand âcause the walls are made of stone
Nothing will ever bring them down
Call me king, heavy lies the crown
Nothing will ever bring them down
Call me king, heavy lies the crown
The secret place that I canât escape
No one gets in, I will never get out
Nothing will ever bring me down
Call me king, heavy lies the crown
