[feat. Dan from Cold World]Maybe I lost but I played to win
A lot can happen between now and never
so be careful with your ultimacy
untamed youth against stone-still age
both pounding hearts of my biography
if we wouldn't do anything we shouldn't
we wouldn't feel better doing something we should
If you want to have the rainbow than you must have the rain
Maybe I lost but I played to win
throughout this hazardous life
It may be true, you can not lose
if you don't enter the game
but to not play in fear of defeat
means your decay
while you were out winning the battle
you have lost the war
Keeping in mind the difference
wasting time and wasting existence
Life's nothing but the change
between happy and sad phases
we live and we die
then time exterminates us
there's plenty of room at the bottom
if you don't move, scared to break things, you'll soon be rotten
Maybe I lost but I played to win,
throughout this life of sin
