I was never asked if I wanted to grow up
I never wanted anything to make sense
felt alive in the depths of youth
it kept me going all by myself
The lessons that wanted me to behave
were those I dreamed of when I woke up afraid
I see the heavy rain in front of me
and hear the hours ticking so fast
I wanna safe it all before itâs too late
Twentytwo,
breath to die, turn to dust and learn to fly
Twentytwo,
thatâs where I fall apart and where I come to life
Stony paths, they led my way
it felt so good to go astray
blessed ignorance, I call it youth
spent nights of bliss and days of sorrow
the road that never ends is the one to follow
tried so hard to live by the codes of youth
realized my believes will turn to dust
fortune walked away from me
I donât like myself anymore since Iâm twentythree
Twentytwo,
breath to die, turn to dust and learn to fly
Twentytwo,
thatâs where I fall apart and where I come to life
