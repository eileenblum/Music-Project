So letâs sum it up
I donât know nothing
And thatâs the only truth there is
While I was wasting my life
Trying to find the right steps for the dance against time
pretending to take the heavy walk
while living the excuse, the lie and the crime
I was hoping for someone,
someone that would be pleased by my disregard
armed with the meanest coat,
I separated emotions from reason and shattered my smiles apart
I turned around and saw there was nothing at all
My head and self esteem, against the wall
Even the oddest gods only led me astray
took everything I thought I knew and threw it away
I just donât like to be the one who walks the line
Though I became conscious of not knowing nothing
In the presence of the foe, in the presence of truth
I have to admit lifeâs a decline, I lost my spine
The fury I turn on everyone else is a cry for rescue
The cry for company I never wanted
Helplessly I embrace the chaos inside of me
The anger grows and grows and grows, canât set it free
There's somethings wrong
I feel alone
I'm dead and gone
