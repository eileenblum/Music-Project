âHonestly, I canât remember teen dreams
All my (dumb ass) feelings and their meanings
They seem too see-through to be true
All the who's are there but the whys are unclearâ
Thought my steps were clever
too young to know about forever
You say you donât want to lose me, but in fact you wished you never had me
My blurred eyes did not see the lie like it was meant to be
Close your eyes and fall asleep, I feel your cold my dear bride,
You showed me your darkest side, but could you still hold me tonight?
Your company made me feel the way I wanted to feel
But after all I wasnât good enough I didnât appeal
Though it was an illusion, it seemed so real to me
(I) had to burn down my safe spot (to) escape from self-made misery
Came closer to the point where my mind was shed
Now I question the moves I made and the words I said
since itâs no pain no gain thanks for the gift you gave me
showed me the disappointments I'm now able to foresee
you had put me in my place and I didn't know where to stand
still I feel no thrill and I still believe that life is ill
