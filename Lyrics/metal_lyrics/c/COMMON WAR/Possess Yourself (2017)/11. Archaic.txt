Pierce the skin and drain the blood of everything unholy,
Drive the spear between the eyes and let the demons out,
Let the hand of the divine bless and purify you

Ancient practice of deceit keeps the masses on their

Hail the sun, the closest star, accept the sacrifice
Drink the blood and hold the heart highest in the sky
Clergymen will lead the way, oracles of light
Wicked beings and artifice shunned by robes of white

The guilty will burn, the pure will drown
Purified by fire
