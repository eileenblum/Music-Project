I hold no gods before me
I hold no gods before myself
I reject the serpent
I reject the shepherd

Magic abounds, pierces through the air
And lights my path
Conjure thyself

There is no one before me
There are no masters to follow

I am the serpent
I am the shepherd
I am one with the earth
I am balance

The oceans carry the largest beasts
But the earth does hold the gods that be
The oceans carry the largest beasts
But the earth does hold the likes of me

Worship yourself
Put none before you
Eat of the fruit
Be beyond all that is

No god
No light
No hope
Be the serpent
I am the serpent
