I know who I am
I'm kicking your crosses down
I know what I want
To burn this god-damned place to the ground
So light the match

This dark passenger has never left my side
A shadow in the darkness, a monster trapped inside
Festering behind my eyes, feed on my disgust
Wait until the time is right to satisfy this blood lust

I know what you've done
I'll be your cause of dread
I'll come inside your house
And paint your walls red

And if it's justified...

I don't know who I am, I've buried myself

And if it's justified
I don't care
But I want to see your eyes
Want to see them in a death stare

And in the end, you'll reap what you sow
