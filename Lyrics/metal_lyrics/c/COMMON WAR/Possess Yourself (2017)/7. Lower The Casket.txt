Six-sided eternity covered in dirt

There is no future for me
Rot inside this box
There is no future for us
The casket tightly locked

I am ashes, I am dust, I am a shell of what was
Save your flowers, save your coins, there is no lesser cause

Lower the casket
Don't speak a word
Under the ground
Voices go unheard

Requiem Ã¦ternam
Et obscurum perpetua
