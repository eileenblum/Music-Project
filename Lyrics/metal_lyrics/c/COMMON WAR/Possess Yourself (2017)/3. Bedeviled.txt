Death obsessed, insatiable thirst for
Darkness that consumes me
Morbid lust, a ravenous need to be
Covered in the blood of saints
And bathe in the tears of the holy
I'll leave this earth in ruin and shadowed in misery

I came into the world this way
To inflict pain and agony
The meek have tried to convert me
But demons drive me anyway

Desolate and cold
Solitary in my thoughts
I'll let the victims pile up
And watch them as they rot
Decomposing in my mind
Every last one
Until I'm left alone

I won't stop until the last one's dead
