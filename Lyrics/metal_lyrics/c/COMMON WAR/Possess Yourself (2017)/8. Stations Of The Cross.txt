To be condemned to death and forced to carry the cross
Mocked as he fell
Kiss his mother goodbye, it's nothing but a lie
A fable to sell

Stories told to appeal to the servants, slaves, and pawns

To be stripped of his clothes, crucified and die
The lamentation
To be laid in a tomb, and face his foreseen doom
The way of sorrows ends

Stories told to appeal to the servants, slaves, and pawns
To invoke your empathy, this vile death of god

What kind of god would plea for sympathy and leave us all to die alone?
No god of mine, the meek are blind to see, their father's never coming home

What kind of god?
No god of mine
