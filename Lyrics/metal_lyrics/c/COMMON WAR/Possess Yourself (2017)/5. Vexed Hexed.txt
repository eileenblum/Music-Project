I am darkest night, I am void of light
I am the sun blotted out, I am without

I am marble constant, firm as a stone
No swaying intent, the fleeting moon: no planet of mine

Plagues in the sky, plagues from the sea
In the palest stone, all can see me

Pillars of rock hold kingdoms high
Crumble and break, for the end is nigh
Snake of the Nile, painless they say
Now let the venom course through my veins

I am void of light
I am void of life
