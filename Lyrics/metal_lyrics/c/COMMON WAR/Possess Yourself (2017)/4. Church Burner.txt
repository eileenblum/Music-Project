Sanctified
Don't let the word enslave you
Glorified
Worthless age-old fantasy

Separate truth from fabrication
Learn to forget all unworthy idols

Wait in line
To drink the blood of saviors
Sun won't shine
Any brighter for you

Desecrate the place where they betray you
Set ablaze your past indiscretions
Let the flames engulf all that's behind you
There's no grace to fall from

No place for your soul, so end the dream for all
Deny the spirit whole, let the embers fall

Jesus Christ, unworthy son
Savior to none
Sea of flames, thy will be done
Heresy begun
