No heaven, no hell
No others just three
No body, no shell
No time, nothing

Life is opportunity, so be who you are
Follow not the paths of others, but make your own

Freedom is what you do with what's been done to you

Find your authenticity, and be who you are
Wander in your own way
Possess yourself

Freedom is left behind when we trust empty skies

The truth alone won't set you free, but doubt
The beast inside should not be caged, but let out

They may say we'll burn for this
But remain merciless
And we'll keep exposing this
Truth; our truth

I've heard the stories too, of god parting the sea
But I don't wanna hear it, and don't you pray for me

No heaven, no hell
No time, nothing
