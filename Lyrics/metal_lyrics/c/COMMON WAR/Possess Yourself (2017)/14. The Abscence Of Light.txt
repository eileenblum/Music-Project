As a child I was told that I was something more
A follower of glory grace and truth

But I've exposed the lie and watched the band of fools
Congregate and manipulate the destitute in droves

I've come to learn that there is nothing here for me
Beyond what I provide for myself
Don't believe the myth that we are all unique
You're just like everybody else

Don't believe the myth

Upon this pale blue dot is everything you know
Among billions and billions, we are but a grain of sand

Life is fleeting like a passing mist
I can't let my life just be meaningless

This life is my own
My mind is my own
