I was born to kill
This curse upon me
To always shoot straighter
Than my enemy

Iron and wood
Bonded by grace
Forming beauty, causing pain

It's just a sick joke, the duality of man
Raising up a peaceful flag, and killing with the other hand
Kill me quick

The dead only know
One single thing
That it is better to be alive

Live rounds make dead men
(7.62 mm)

In a world of shit, I am alive
And I'm not afraid
Afraid to die
