Found in the woods
No breath of my own
Hung from a branch
Bound to her curse

Pale as death, naked as sin,
Witched

Keep her young
With untainted newborn flesh
Give your soul
For her eternal life on earth

No symbols, no talismans, no cross
No amulets, no charms
Can save you from eternal suffering
As a soulless body, completely lifeless being

Your blood will spill and feed the earth
Like a river from your veins
Your blood will spill
