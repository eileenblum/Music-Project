The table is tilted and this game is rigged
And it's a big club that we are not in
It's a ladder with rungs, but they don't reach the ground
And people keep staring upward
Thinking heaven can help bring it down

The pyramid is stacked high as can see
Built by slave owners that want to be free

Nothing but bullshit we've been sold
Disinformation is a lie
They poison the water everyday
Just fucking drink it and die

Nobody cares at all

And nobody seems to notice, and nobody seems to care
That our thoughts are fucking silent and we shouldn't breathe this air

Keep staring upward, eyes open wide
Keep looking forward, swallow the lie

This is just too good to be true
This is just too hard to believe
In the promise that the dream is real when you're not asleep
