As we roam through the fields of harmony, we find abruptions everywhere we place our feet.
I hope you find what you are looking for.
I hope you find the strength to break down the door.
Everyone is finding out what it means to be alive.
Everything was falling down all around us, but you never even tried.
When winter comes, I'll think of you.
When winter comes I will dream of your return.
When December comes you'll be the one I remember.
When December comes I will dream of your return.
You walked towards the edge to say your final goodbye to the cold December sky.
You walked towards the edge.
I'm watching as you fall of the cliffs of nothingness.
(I watched you fall)
