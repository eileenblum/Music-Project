I will stop at nothing,
To get what I deserve,
But either way,
Someone will always get, hurt.

I have the ability to create madness,
Or make peace within,
I have the ability to destroy my worst intentions, my worst intentions.

I will stop at nothing,
To get what I deserve,
But either way,
Someone will always get, hurt.

We spin the wheel of misfortune
To find a cure,
Face to face, a bright sky turns black
How do we coexist?
Its all just another mess to me
My life has become, Convoluted

I will stop at nothing,
To get what I deserve,
But either way,
Someone will always get, hurt.

Back to back
A white flag turned red.
We both forgot how to coexist.

[x2]
Face to face
A white flag turned red.

We forgot how to coexist, how to coexist
We forgot how to coexist, how to coexist

[x4]
My life has become, Convoluted.
Its just another mess to me
My life has become, Convoluted,
So close yet far away
