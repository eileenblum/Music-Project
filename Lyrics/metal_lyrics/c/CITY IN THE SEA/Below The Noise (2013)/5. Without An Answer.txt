I found myself in the right place at the right time to shed some light on this life.
I cannot explain the way things happen to us, but I can say this twice.
Fuck you, this is the way things are.
Right now, I have completely dissolved this discontent from my heart, from my mind.
I am fine without an answer.
Life goes on.
I found myself in between the lines I said I would never cross.
No longer afraid I am seizing the days ahead.
Right now, I have completely dissolved this discontent from my heart, from my mind.
I am fine without an answer.
Life goes on.
I can't change the world I can only change myself.
Without an answer, life goes on.
