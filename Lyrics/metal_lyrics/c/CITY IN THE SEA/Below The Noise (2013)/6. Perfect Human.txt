We've made our enemies (The perfect human dwells inside us all).
We've make our own mistakes.
Nothing will ever make sense to me.
Perfection can be lost and found so easily.
All I've been through and all I've lost has showed me how to be the real me.
Nothing will ever make sense to me.
Perfection can be lost and found so easily.
We've made our enemies.
We've made our mistakes.
This is the path no one wants to take, but I will.
It'd be so easy, but I return to find meaning in this life.
I know the pain it hurts. It's like a dagger to the throat.
We've made our enemies, we've made our mistakes.
This is the path no one wants to take, but I will.
It'd be so easy, but I return to find meaning.
