[feat. Aaron Matts]I swear my pain can be cured.
I've worked way too hard for this to just let this slip away.
Never. What will remain if they can't cure my pain?
What will remain?
They've found a weakness inside of my soul.
It's buried deep, but within my existence.
There is a secret that I cannot know.
A tear is shed in my name, in my honor.
A decision's been made. (I have strength.)
I have strength, but they're letting it go to waste.
A decisions been made.
I swear, oh I swear my pain can be cured.
I've worked too hard to let this just slip away.
I am strong and they are weak. (They're weak)
They've found a demon that's lurking below.
It's buried deep, it's out of control.
There is a reason why I cannot go, so don't tell me that this has nothing to do with you.
If there's a will then there's a way.
Only the strong will stand with me.
There will be hope and it will reign.
I am strong and they are weak.
