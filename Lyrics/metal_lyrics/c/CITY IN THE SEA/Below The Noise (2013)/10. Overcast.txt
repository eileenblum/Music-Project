[feat. Ben Bruce]Overcast.
Wash away the land when there is no hope left.
It's coming closer.
The storm is coming closer.
It can't wait to take away everything we've put to waste.
Who am I supposed to be?
These questions cover me until these eyes run away from me.
Who am I supposed to be?
What am I supposed to believe in?
I will not let apathy take hold of me.
Rain down compassion and an ocean of fury.
Overcast.
Wash away the land when there is no hope left.
No future, only downpour.
I see no future, only downpour.
The tides are rising in the most violent form.
Can't you see we've been warned.
Overcast.
