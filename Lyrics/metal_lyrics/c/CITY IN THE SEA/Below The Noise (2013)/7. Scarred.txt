Broken.
Our reasons for hope brings the envious scorn.
We will be scarred forever.
This is just the start.
Brace yourself.
This world has a place for you.
Disguise entact.
Reach out, take a chance and see this through.
This hatred leaves an empty soul unrest.
(See this through) What do you want from me?
Disguise intact, I'm wondering who is the enemy.
If you're the enemy, what do you want from me?
I never did anything to make you feel this way.
If you're the enemy, what do you want from me?
You're at a loss for words because your eyes have failed you.
You're too blind to see.
I'm constantly reminded of who I never want to be by your lies, by your life.
Where's your dignity?
Where were you when the truth had been revealed?
Nowhere to be found.
What do you want from me?
We will be scarred forever, but this is just the start. Brace yourself.
