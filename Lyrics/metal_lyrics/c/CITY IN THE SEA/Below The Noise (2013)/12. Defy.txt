One day I will defy gravity.
One day I will defy the world around me.
One day I will defy you.
Blinded by this life of spite, can you see this?
Destiny will be my light, can you feel this?
Guided my these past mistakes, can you hear this?
Destiny will never desert me because I was born to let my voice ring across the earth.
I was born to separate the shield from the sword.
Immensity demands of my name.
The calling of apathy, untouched, will remain untouched.
There is nothing left I beg, make me believe.
Make me believe I can do anything.
Make me believe nothing can stop me.
I'm greater than all.
I'm invincible because I was born to let my voice ring across the earth.
I was born to separate the shield from the shield.
I once was lost along a path where weakness had it grasp around my neck.
It took the fall to bring me back, but now I know where I may stand.
One day I will defy gravity.
One day I will defy the world.
I will defy you.
I will defy the world.
