[feat. Ben Bruce]I'm riding out the storm (Cause I am on my own.)
The waves are crashing down (Fighting the undertow.)
Our sails are ripped and torn (As I swim alone.)
You watch me as I drown (Sinking deep below.)
There's something in the air tonight, I think it might just take me away.
It's okay, don't worry.
I'm discovering oceans, one by one .
Cause I'm caught in the wake of this coming tide
(The waves can't hold me down. You're always in my way (Not today.)
But you will never hold me down (have them carry me home.)
I swear I'll carry you home.
I'm discovering oceans, one by one.
Cause I'm caught in the wake of this coming tide, (The waves can't hold me down.)
You're always in my way (Not today.) 
But you will never hold me down (have them carry me home.)
Cause I'm caught in the wake of this coming tide (have them carry me home.)
(time's been standing still) (lost our way.)
But you will never hold me down (have them carry me home.)
I swear I'll carry you home.
I'm discovering oceans, one by one.
