My innocence beaten to death by these vices that always hold me close and never let me go.
Misfortune found.
The purge is now.
All ties unbound.
The purge is now.
The end of it all approaches.
Has this world changed me for the better or for the worse?
It's so easy to forget when I'm not reminded.
Remind me who I am.
Has this world changed for the better or for the worse?
With no one left, its been decided I cannot find myself.
Misfortune found.
The purge is now.
Their jaws of disbelief forced shut to break the teeth.
I'll bury them underneath and carve into the grave of eternity.
The end of it all approaches.
Wage war between perfection and reality.
The purge is now.
I have no one left.
I hear only silence.
This is no mistake.
I want it all.
Misfortune found.
The purge is now.
