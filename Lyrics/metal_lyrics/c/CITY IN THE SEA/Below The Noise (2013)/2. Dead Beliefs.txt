May restoration fall on these broken wings. These hands remain holding on to what is dead. I can't take them away. My skin is suffering. Each vein is blackening. Now everyone I meet is dying with the past. It's simple room to breathe that I have not recieved. May restoration fall on these broken wings. No time to waste, this healing must take place. Don't let the darkness consume me. Dont let the darkness get the best of me. These hands remain holding on to what is dead. Now everyone I meet is just lying like the rest. Let go of broken wings. Let go of dead beliefs. May restoration fall on those who need it most. There is no time left, we must restore ourselves.
