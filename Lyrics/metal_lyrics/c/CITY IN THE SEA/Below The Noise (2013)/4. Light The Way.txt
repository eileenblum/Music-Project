Come with me.
We will only seek refuge in destiny.
Just take my hand, forget the rest, and take this leap of faith.
"I've heard the shadows are only there to haunt me.
I've heard the darkness is only there to drag me down."
We must light the way.
Just light the way to discover the meaning of life's embrace.
Let's find a way to discover the reasons for this escape.
"I've heard the oceans are only there to drown me.
I've heard the darkness is only there to drag me down."
Just take my hand, forget the rest, and take this leap of faith.
Oh, the leap of faith erases the fear and the hesitance.
Just light the way to discover the meaning of life's embrace.
Let's find a way to discover the reasons for this escape.
We must light the way.
