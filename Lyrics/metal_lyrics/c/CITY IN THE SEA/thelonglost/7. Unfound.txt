Hold your words for when you must use them.
Choose a side before it can choose you
Or obey the rules of humanity
And diminish with your indiscretion.
Greatness and pride is one step below the rest.
Boast yourself until there's no breaths left and
There's no room left to give.
So was it worth it?
To build your life up to nothing.
Was it worth it to build your life up to nothing?
To reach the highest peak for the greatest fall.
Your accomplishments, your enslavement of virtue built
By the greed of man and machine.
And as they walk hand in hand down an aisle of fire,
The flames grow higher as all the life that we know expires
Now all I know is wearing thin and
I need something so much more,
So I can finally find my way back home.
