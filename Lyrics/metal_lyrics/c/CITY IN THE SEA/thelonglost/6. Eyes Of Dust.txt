I'll walk in the wake of war with these weary eyes
Only to find that a line drawn in your mind is better
Than drawn with your hands.
Your empty actions, empty words don't mean a thing.
Your lies won't keep me from breathing.
There's no stopping me.
Your lies won't keep me from breathing.
You try over and over, scream at me in my face,
Yet nothing is changing.
Can't you see this won't change.
Can't you see this will never change.
Did you forget who I am?
Your eyes of dust won't deceive me, as this is the end reign
This is the end of your reign, I promise.
