My friend you're dying inside.
It's hard to see you slip away like this.
Why can't you understand everyone's hurting.
I know this life is overwhelming.
But that's no excuse to give up on everything you've started
Make a stand and make a change.
Lead yourself in the right direction.
We can't live like this any longer,
We must keep our heads above the water.
Clear the demons out of your head.
They'll never go away, but you can fight the battle.
This world is so conforming, don't fall under it's spell
You'll soon realize this is the wrong path.
Show your new footprints to a generation in need.
This is a time of despair which you must choose,
To struggle together, or all alone.
