I've started to ask so many questions in a world
With so few answers.
What can truly change the thought of man
When denial of love has become greater than love itself?
The triumph of hate seems to be the only
Thing keeping us awake.
Open your eyes.
We are the long lost.
The thought of running blind brings no deliverance to me.
Shackles and chains hold us down as one by one,
The long lost find comfort in this security.
It seems like I'm alone, but I feel so alive.
Why do I do this to myself?
Oh God, why do I do this to myself?
With empty hands I'll show I'm ready to begin again,
This new life where the victim is not myself.
Con! The thought of knowing I have found something
With meaning gives me strength to walk away
From the long lost, and set these shackles and chains free.
I've learned in life to never let a single failure
Ever get the best of me. Even when your world falls apart,
For us, this will just be the start.
