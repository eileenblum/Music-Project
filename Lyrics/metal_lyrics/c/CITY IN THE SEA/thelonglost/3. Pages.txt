This is a page of the story that we're left to write upon.
It's become our choice if we should tear out
The one's that don't belong.
It seems like we're afraid to even begin,
But I won't let this story go unread.
So lets show the world what we can become
If we take what we've seen and turn this all around.
But they thicken the plot for everyone to see that
We feed off the lies, the hatred, and the greed.
I never even thought of this happening.
That we feed off lies, hatred, and greed.
But it's become an unfortunate reality,
That we must live and die with because
We can't justify the reasons...
Why we refuse to change ourselves.
