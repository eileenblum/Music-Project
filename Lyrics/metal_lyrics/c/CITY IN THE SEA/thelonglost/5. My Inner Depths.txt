These are things that tear me apart.
These are the things that keep me up at night.
I don't want to live another moment like this.
Close my eyes and breathe in this air.
Realize the fear's taken over me.
Regret is lightning striking me to the ground.
Why do I still stay underneath the mess I've made?
I'm going nowhere, achieving nothing.
Holding back is my inward convulsion.
My heart falls away as my structure is shattered,
And my eyes fixate on the pieces fallen to the ground.
I tell myself I need to put myself back to where I belong.
These are things that tear me apart.
These are the things that keep me up at night.
I don't want to live another moment like this.
