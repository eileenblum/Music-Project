[performed by Coffins]Your moment of ecstasy never come again
You are over
Compensation of your deed
Surrounded by men you slaughtered
Axes of vengeance brought down
Yuur tainted body spatters
Axes of vengeance brought down
Your intorted soul spatters
You stab his eyeballs out
You tear her guts apart
You spit on their body
Now it's time for compensation
Suffer
Cry out
Beg for a forgiveness
And you
And you die
