Second coming on the doomsday
The unlettered masses flock to messiah
From the ruined world to the heaven
The messiah said scorning...
Listen! Zero! There is no heaven!
The heaven is this rotting world!
Heaven doesn't exist from the beginning!
God doesn't exist from the beginning!
The grotesque messiah said scorning...
