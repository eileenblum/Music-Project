Torture! Taste pain
Torture! Appreciate suffering
The heavy responsibility of the crime
which is never forgiven

Torture! Taste pain
Torture! Appreciate suffering
The circle of life masskilling
Scream not ceasing

Darkness covers the world
The beginning of sabbat

Holy cross of the evil
You are crucifixion

Burn to death
Suffocation
Starvation
Drowning
Repent your crime
Receive every torture
Only death waiting for you
