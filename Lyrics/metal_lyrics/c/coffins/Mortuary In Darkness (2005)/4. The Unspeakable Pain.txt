Awake! Ignorant people
Only pain is in this world
It's spoiled by hypocrisy
Lies overflows

Fear
Confusion
Slaughter
Hell on earth

Awake! Ignorant people
Kneel down to God of evil
When serving God of evil
pain changes to pleasure

Wrong is just God
You will recieve punishment
when you don't accept wrong
The Unspeakable Pain
