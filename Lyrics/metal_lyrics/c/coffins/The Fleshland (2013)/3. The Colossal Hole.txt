Cold black storm brings the unholy
Rubble of cathedrals turning into dust

Roaring beasts build towers of
human flesh on cracked earth

The evil is unleashed
The hole was opened
The Darkness is unleashed
The gate was opened

When darkness falls you see them wriggle
The End-Time crawls out of the colossal hole
