Your entrails are eluted from all over your body.
Flow down into black-water and mix with shits.

Your soul is eluted from all over your body.
Everything unnecessary is scooped out.

They gush into the vacant pale vessel and come at flesh and blood.

What once you were is just sludge now.
It's nothing but bubbling, staying in the darkness.

You become naught and they will be born.
