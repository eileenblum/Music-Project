Dawn of the inevitable is the beginning of the end
Bottomless trepidation spreads like epidemic
Put your trembling hand on the useless Bible
Give the last prayer reaches no one

Here comes perdition

A loss of faith makes a pile of abandoned crosses
It will be a monument to pitiful futileness
Put your trembling hand on the useless Bible
Give the last prayer reaches no one

Today is the day
All icons shed tears of blood
This is the beginning of the end

Today is the day
All icons shed tears of blood
Here comes perdition
