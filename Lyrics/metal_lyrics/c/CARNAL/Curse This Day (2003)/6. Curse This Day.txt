Test this day
Last but one sunbeam
Is just falling down on your face

Test this day
The last friend
Has broken the given word
And the sound of your's beloved roice
Doesn't want to ring in your heart anymore

Test this day
It apperas that the path you have chosen
Leads to nowhere

You want come in time to reach
The top of pleasure
In hands which used to caress
The life is missing

You want manage to
Arrange the lost thoughts
Confusion has inraded the silence of dreams
With its renom it has inoculated the treason

Test this day
When love
Dies in your eyes
And curse this day
