When you sing her
The song of love
And bird of doom
Rises its wings to fly away
And the expanse becomes infinity

You will touch her heart and body
That have been dozing on the snowy-white bed
Without aftertaste of sweat
And you will wake her up
And she will open her overslept eyes
You will see its azure
And darkness
And brightness
And flame
And you will be lost

As soon as you sing her
The song of love
