Light I see in your eyes
When I go on paths of life
Oblivitions bitter taste
Returns again
Still to title of your body
To understand the mystery
To find sense and truth
Though for a moment
I always find in you
Warmth of night, moon's glare
That surrounds our hearts
And protects us
With you I can wander
To stream of evil and good
To recognize our souls
What sleeps inside them
I feel your despair
With all my body being in you
I feel your tendemess
With all myself when you leave
Let there be I where you will be
Among the night you'll be found by me
Let the love still light in us
And moon light our way
Let the blackness guest inside us
In our soul and fire them
Look the night comes
Emerges from the depths of evil
&gt;From the abyss I call my friends
I want to feel your taste
Look the darkness surrounds us
Hugh with it's coat
And protects you from influence of lie
To be safe within it
