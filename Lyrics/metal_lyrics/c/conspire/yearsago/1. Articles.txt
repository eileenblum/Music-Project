What can I say?
You're so worth it to me
It's me I hate cause I can't commit
Why, why can't I commit to the things that mean so much to me?
Just want to stray, but stay the same
Need to find a way to not lose or gain anything
Anything
I'm never sure about this (Times like this)
And I know I can't deal with the pressure
I can't commit
No
So many ways to change but that all will stay the same
Still I can't, still I won't
Let me save you
I want this so bad
I want you so bad
I want this so bad
You wield a sword to this life, now take a stab at what you want
