When are things ever meant to be? 
These days that we love 
Will end up, being the days that we hate 
I found meaning 
And I for one refuse to give up 
And I refuse 
To discontinue my direction 
There's more to life, there's more to love, 
There's more to it all 
There was something more 
The nights we stayed up late 
The days were light head shine 
Memories made habits 
Come alive (Come alive) 
No endeavors, no no's and nevers 
Go 
I won't forget 
But I'll push on 
You're full of fear, but so was I 
I've given my all too many times 
I guess I'm to blame 
I won't sleep tonight 
No 
Take me for nothing more but safety 
Take me for anything but never break me 
I never needed you to trust me, 
But just to know I trust myself 
I worried about the future in the eyes of no one else
But myself see less
