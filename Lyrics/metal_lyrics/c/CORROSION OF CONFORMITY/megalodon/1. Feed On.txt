As time accelerates perspectives beyond
Crumbling before the sum where entropy is God
Dangerous fool, Worm-Eaten soul
Scatter in wind, Wither in shadow
Crawled out of your hole

Arrows of scorn your crown adorn
Proud among the thorns
Validation in negation
You feed on Frustration
Feed On

Rule in Subterfuge
Long may you Reign
Rule in Subterfuge
Your Domain is Insane

Arrows of scorn your crown adorn
Proud among the thorns
Validation in negation
You feed on Frustration
Feed On

From below the World
To the Realm Beyond
To Escape this Spiritual Prison
On a Chariot of Light
Frozen in Amber
Waiting on the Puppet Master
Barbelo I'm Coming Home
Barbelo
Frozen in Amber
Waiting on the Puppet Master

Petty Tyrants cannot Yield
To Questions of the Field
Fortress of Lies will Grow
To Smother any Light
