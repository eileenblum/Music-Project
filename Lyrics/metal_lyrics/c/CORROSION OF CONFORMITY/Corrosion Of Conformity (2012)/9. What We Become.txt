What you despise is what you've become. 
How low can you go?
The hospital?
Am I out of my head?
Where is the backbone, you used to own?
Did you sell it to the corporate head?
Sunken so low for the gold.
Another sell out now.
Now I'm out of my head, cause you're out of my head.
Another sell out cause you're out of my head.
And what you despise, is what you become.
Why am I surprised that you're the one?
Cause you're a company man?
How low will go?
To go for the gold?
Two-face Mr. company man. 
Slip and slide and compromise.
Sinking into the house of quicksand.
So close your eyes and live a lie.
Cause you're done you're done.
You took the money and run.
You took the money and run.
You took the money now you're out of my head.
What you despise is what you become.
Living the lie you took the money and run.
Cause you're a company man.
And what you despise is what you become.
You took the money and run.
You took the money now you're out of my head. 
And what you despise is what you become.
Living the lie you took the money and run.
And what you despise is what you become
What you despise is what you become.
