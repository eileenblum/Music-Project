From the pulpit the puppet's mouth is infested with suggestion.
A description unfitting, resonate and predigested.
A transaction of extraction, transference is here.
Stir the pot to see what you've got to appear. 

Psychic vampire, paranoia down the wire.
Psychic vampire goodbye.

Adorn the queen oblivion, as a pawn your life in hawk.
Gilded road to emptiness, feel the chill of time's caress.

Psychic vampire, paranoia down the wire.
Psychic vampire, goodbye.
