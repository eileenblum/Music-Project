Rat city.
You can't out-bleed me you'll never out-bleed me.
Rat city.
Win by numbers survival by cunning.
Rat city.
Keep your friends near your enemies closer.
Rat city.
I've come to make my way.
Try to grow the family.
In a parallel realm.
That's here but unseen.
I might penetrate your grain.
Might be in your labs of pain.
Forever together.
We are one until we're done.
