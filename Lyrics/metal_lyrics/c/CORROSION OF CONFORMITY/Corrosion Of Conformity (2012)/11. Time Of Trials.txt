Visualize the demise of a self inflicted prison.
History doesn't have to win.
Just because the words been written.
Reverse the curse of endless thirst.
Chapter to verse the stake is driven.
Saturated memory the recognition worn.
Been a steep and winding path.
From another epoch born.
Reverse the curse of endless thirst.
Chapter to verse the stake is driven.
To derail the time machine.
And to let the future speak.
In a time of trials.
Dystopia may thrive. 
Let delusion slowly melt away.
Fall away.
What new light brings this unraveling.
