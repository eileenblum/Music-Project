Reckless minds they set the bait, in the grass the serpents wait.
Believe you're blessed when you say yes.
Then you know the trap is set.

That's right, the moneychangers.
Thrown out of the temple, you know it didn't last a day.
Now returned in the clothes of the pious, back to their old ways.
The moneychangers, ah, ah, ah.

Now in the matrix take your place.
They'll tap your labor and your light.
Gain euphoria, from your paranoia.

That's right, the moneychangers.
Well you're thrown from the temple, you know it didn't last a day..
Now returned in the clothes of the pious, back to their old ways.
The moneychangers, ah, ah ah.

Reckless minds they set then bait, in the grass the serpents wait.
Believe you're blessed when you say yes.
