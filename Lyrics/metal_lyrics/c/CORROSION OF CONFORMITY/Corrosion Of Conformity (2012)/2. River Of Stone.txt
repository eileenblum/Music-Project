Those who first see the light are the one extinguishing.
If blood should reign and rivers boil, feel the earth beneath burning.

Where do you look now for knowing that some great fall looms?
Crucible has been cast, this is the way that cannot last. 
Iron snakes they crawl the dirt, caught up in a spider's web.
Rivers turn to stone again and the seas are black and dead.
No shelter for evil, in time you'll find another way.
When you're dealing with those devils. 
To who or what you gonna pray?

Thunder came and struck them down and the wheels kept right on rolling.
Strange beasts are everywhere and the earth they've overrun.

Where do you look now for knowing that some great fall looms?
Time of trials is unleashed, artifice is overcome.
Iron snake they crawl the dirt, caught up in a spider's web.
Rivers turn to stone again, and the seas are black and dead.
No shelter for evil, in time you'll find another way.
When you're dealing with those devils.
To who or what you gonna pray?

In a swarm the crows are clamoring, what's happening?
In a storm that's outside gathering there's hammering
Don't you want to know the sign?
Don't you want to know your time?
Long of tooth the shadows grow.
By the stream where nothing flows.
