On your way back to earth, assigned another birth
On your way back to dawn, the last will now be first
Searching for for what's already your's, already your possession
They have no answers, one is the soul, nothing to offer they have cast all their stones
They have cast all their stones

In primate fear assign the blame that their scarecrows may lead them
In suspicion might have lost their way, trust in those that came to prey
Searching for for what's already your's, already your possession
They have no answers, one is the soul, nothing to offer they have cast all their stones
They have cast all their stones

I you knew at the dawn what was know by night, the same bad cards other side
Twist up another metaphor, unite in fear painted up as bravery
No recollection of connection, come before, return again
Many beginnings from many ends, ripples of disruption
Searching for for what's already your's, already your possession
They have no answers, one is the soul, nothing to offer...
