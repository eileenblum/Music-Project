Darkness shine a light into the black night night of the soul
Into the storm, you have to ride out, you have to ride it out
Beware of deposed gods plotting a return
They long to plunder by thunder in the end don't get burned
Bought the best pedestal, all that money could buy
Put yourself up there and say shine a light, but it's known
In the end lie broken in stone

Symbol of the shadow, symbol of the fall, the name is taken
Denied, violated, profane
See who's eye I spy, been a long time flying by, and I see you looking at me
Look with some disdain, and a touch of pity, because I never found a seat
At the feast of your elite
Looking, I got you looking
