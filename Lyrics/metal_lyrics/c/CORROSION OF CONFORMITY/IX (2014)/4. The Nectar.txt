Guardian angel, devil in wait
Sampled your wares, was a mistake
Darkness within revealed
Spun out on the light that you crave

Recognize what is in sight and what's hidden will come into view
I hear you rail against the competition
What you're selling is the only true elixir
Recognize what is in sight and what's hidden will come into view

Drink of the nectar, you true believer, let reason sleep, drink deep
Worm-holed soul, how to fill the need
Drink of the nectar, drink deep
Recognize what is in sight and what's hidden will come into view
Oh, in the mind, how they plant the seed, and feed the forces, dark forces they've freed
