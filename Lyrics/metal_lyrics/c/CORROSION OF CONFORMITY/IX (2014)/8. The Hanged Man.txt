Oh I put in my time, oh not believing your lines
Oh believe it all works out, hope it all works out in time
I've seen the numbers of the day, It looks like time has up and flown away
I've seen the golden ones stumble and fall, looks like the shine is off them all

You know the night's so strong, dragged in the dawn
Some fools are drawn, fascination, some fools are drawn to the dark ones
I've seen the numbers of the day, It looks like time has up and flown away
I've seen the golden ones stumble and fall, looks like the shine is off them all

You know the night's so strong, dragged in the dawn
Some fools are drawn, vibration, some fools are drawn to the dark ones
So crawl eclipsed, all things run their course, shadow of self gaze up at the water mark
