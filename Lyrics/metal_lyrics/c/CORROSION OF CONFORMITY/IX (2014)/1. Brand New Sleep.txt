In the beginning maybe you were born to follow, singing everybody else's song
Now you want one for your own
Oh the sky comes apart, so you depart
For a new start in the winter's heart

Respond in kind with the other free thinking sheep
Join their refrain and awaken a brand new sleep
Oh the sky comes apart, so you depart
For a new start in the winter's heart
Awaken
Now you have your dream redeemer
Deliver you if you keep believing
