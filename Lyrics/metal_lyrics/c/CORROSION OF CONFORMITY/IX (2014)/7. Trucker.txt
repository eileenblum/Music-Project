Another legend built to stand behind the glass cannot withstand
Flight of resurrection, illuminating the deception
The faces pressed against the glass, shut out of forever
You cannot rewind or reset the eyes

The tunnel at the end of light stole your sight, mutation failed
Failed to climb, suspicion in your ear, reaction's fear
The faces pressed against the glass, shut out of forever
You cannot rewind or reset the eyes

Try to possess what you can't have, obsess upon the reasons why
Defect is definition, if all is one than you are in it
The faces pressed against the glass, shut out of forever
You cannot rewind or reset the eyes

Oh you lead your horses, lead âem to the water
Well the water's muddy, muddy with broken promise
Repeat the mantra, until you swear it's true
Lower the vibration, evolution doomed
