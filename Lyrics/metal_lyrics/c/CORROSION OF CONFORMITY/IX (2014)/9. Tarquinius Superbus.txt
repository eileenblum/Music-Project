In sight - the throne is my right
The Seventh King
Say goodnight - to the past I indite
Now come kiss the ring
Because I know you must - Hide disgust

Tarquinius Superbus
Omnibus Tarquinius Superbus

I fight - this coup my vendetta
The Etruscan Way
Despite no one knew Frank Frazetta
Would glorify the day
Because Tullius - Was too just

Tarquinius Superbus
Thunderous Tarquinius Superbus

It's a position of time
Cyprian Esquiline (vicus sceleratus)
It's the warrior way to betray
Cause the warrior way is to betray
Ignite - the fire usurp the king
Tonight - the rule imperial
Will turn to dust

Thunderous Tarquinius Superbus
Somethin' wicked
Wicked this way comes
Romulus and Remus
Capitoline Wolf
The Sun belongs to no one
And this son belongs to no one
