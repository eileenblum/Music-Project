Long back in another time, when you walked a razor's line
Tuned to frequencies crystalline, and the ride was serpentine
And so you read between the lies, and find what you need to find

Oh, the result is preordained, so blame just who you need to blame
Wear and tear and grind the gears, They don't care and can't quite feel
Apprehension rules the day, when suspicion leads the way

Blame who you need to blame
So, they bide their time and feed the fire, feed the fire
Blame who you need to blame
