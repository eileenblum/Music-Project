Powers is the heroin of the small-minded man
And force, force is the needle - the gun in his hand
He lusts to control all the people and the land
Complete, total destruction - his ultimate end

All love lost will be reborn
Fire will burn
Take your first breath
Breathe your first freedom
Our Fourth world - nearing it's end
Purification - close at hand

Try but you cannot deny the earth is alive
Our rivers, they are dying and smoke kills the sky
Modern man's cities are built on their lies
When cleansing flames burn, no one can hide (from the truth)

All love lost will be reborn
Fire will burn
Take your first breath
Breathe your first freedom

Our Fourth world - nearing it's end
Purification - close at hand

The time it happened all before, the end was a flood
Man became so arrogant and paid with his blood
No lesson was ever learned - our fate stays the same
Profane civilization will perish in flame

All love lost will be reborn
Fire will burn
Take your first breath
Breathe your first freedom

Burn..
