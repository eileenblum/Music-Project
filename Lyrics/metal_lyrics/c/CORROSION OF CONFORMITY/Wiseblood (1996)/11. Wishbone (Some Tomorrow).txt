torn from within disciple until the end
wasting time is how it's always been
kiss the floor steal the key lock the door there's many ways to decline
bonefide crucified in your prime that you left behind...

twighlight explodes in my time of the blind
you can't postpone some tomorrow
just one more wishbone

broken days pumping through your veins
shattered thoughts are gone but the reflection always stays
losing sight losing sight without a fight that once was a war
now you got 1000 scars and nothing to show them for

twighlight explodes in my time of the blind
you can't postpone some tomorrow
just one more wishbone

in between surrender sight unseen
split the seam when no one intervenes
feel the kick from the hearless heretic that once made you shine
now you're grounded down for the last time shut your eyes to the crime

twighlight explodes in my time of the blind
you can't postpone some tomorrow
just one more wishbone

just one more wishbone
