I've got a positive outlook
Won't get stuck
Drowning in my surroundings
Never give in never give up
Don't let them scare you no
matter what
Where are you putting your
energy?
So much hate and jealousy
All hope is caving in
Patience is growing thin

Got to put it in perspective
Got to see your objective
Isn't it what you expected
From something so long neglected
Be calm, be brave
Got to keep yourself alive

As pressure turns to rage
You solder your own cage
That's not for me
Not how I want to be
