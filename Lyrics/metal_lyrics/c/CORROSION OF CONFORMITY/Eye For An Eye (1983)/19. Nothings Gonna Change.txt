Every lyric you disect
What the fuck do you expect
We're just a fucking band
Aren't we generally correct?
Rebellion's not the clothes you
wear
Or the way you style you hair
Or any pitiful design
We don't souls, we need minds

Nothing's gonna change
Because your prophets shout
Nothing's gonna change
Because you thrash about
Nothing's gonna change
Because your music's fast
And nothing's gonna change
While you're sitting on you ass
