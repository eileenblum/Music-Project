Grace, pride, tell me what's your name?
Crippled will with tomorrows pill
And I feel no pain but I can't remember
Whose to blame...
This is not my home
This is not my home
But the source was always known
Migraine
I beg, you steal, do you show me your signs of a sin
Blistered and torn by the pure &amp; reborn
But there re just like us and remember
Man, they cave in...
This is not my home
This is
Migraine
Wicked goddamn bass licks war stone, do you write your name in trust?
Word to the wise my instincts rise
All your heroes are gone and the proud
Ones have turned to dust... Seven dust...
You can kill my pride but my heads still
Flying!
Migraine
Migraine
Migraine
Migraine
