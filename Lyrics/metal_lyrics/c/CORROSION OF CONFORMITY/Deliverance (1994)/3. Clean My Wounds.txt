I see the world through blood shot eyes
Streets filled with blood from distant lies
The dogs of war never compromise,
No time for rearranging

Help me Jesus, help me clean my wounds
He said he cannot heal that kind
Bleeding soul becomes a bitter mind
He said it happens every time...

That's how the story goes
In the land of a 1000 no's
I'm all over you
In time my mind is changing

Knock it down

Black on black gives me a heart attack
And the silence makes it deadly
Some choose to kill with a simple will
I've seen them fall fast and steady

Help me Jesus help me clean my wounds
He said he cannot heal that kind
Bleeding soul bitter mind
He said it happens every time...

Knock it down

That's how the story goes
In the land of a 1000 no's
I'm all over you
In time my mind is changing

Twist of fate won't give me a break
And myself I'm slow and tired
I've got to rise with these blood shot eyes
But I keep falling when I'm higher...

Help me Jesus help me clean my wounds
He said he cannot heal that kind
Bleeding soul bitter mind
He said it happens every time...

Knock it down

That's how the story goes
In the land of a 1000 no's
We are bleeding sins but our
Sins are always fading

Fading
Fading

Knock it down
Knock it down
