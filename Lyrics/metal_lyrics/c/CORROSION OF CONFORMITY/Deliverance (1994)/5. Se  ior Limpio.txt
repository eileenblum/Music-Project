Sleeping on the wing
Busted flat and dusted boy your minds a terrible thing
Said the man with a dirty hand who claimed that he was king
Choking angels from inside trying to make them sing
'Cause your short of breath and close to death from sleeping on the wing
Dirty king, dirty king now you're strapped in for the ride
It's so hard to be a fighter when your hands are always tied.
Mr. Innocent blood says he kills but just for love
Too bad the good ones always have to take the blame
"hey" sharp tongue liar making pay in a bed of fire
Too bad your dreams are always made of losing games
Dirty king, dirty king now you're shrapped in for the ride,
It's so hard to be a fighter when your hands are always tied.
But I want to I want to I want to but my hands were always tied up
But I want to I want to I want to but my hands were always tied
And I wish I had myself a dime for every time I cursed your goddamn name...
Mister clean
Sweating on the line doing 40 wasting time
Ain't it funny how that money rots your brain?
Put your soul on trial 'cause you lost it all to a tiny vial
Look in the mirror when you tell me who's insane
Dirty king dirty king now you're strapped in for the ride,
it so hard to be a fighter when your hands are always tied.
But I want to but my hands are always tied up
But I want to I want to I want to but my hands were always tied up
But I wish I had myself a dime for every time I cursed your
Goddamn name..
Mister clean
