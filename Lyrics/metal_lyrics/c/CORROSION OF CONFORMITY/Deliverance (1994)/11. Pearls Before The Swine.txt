Father forgive me
Mother forsake me
I think they've all become to strong
Brother believe me
Silence is deadly
And its giving me the strength to carry on
Time has come, now I'm blind, deaf &amp; numb
You're killing me, you're killing me
When I look into your eyes I can see it's
The world that you despise
And you're giving me the strength to carry on
Forgive me...
Look for the devils in their eyes,
Laughing, the blood has long been dried.
To hide in your disguise it goes on &amp; on &amp; on...
Wallow, pearls before swine!
If the liar deceives you
Then the sin will appear true
Even if it leads me to the end
Killer accuse me
The devil breathes easy
- give in me the strength to carry on
Time has come, now I'm blind deaf &amp; numb
Your killing me your killing
When I look into your eyes I can see it's
The world that you despise
And your giving me the strength to carry on
Look for the devils in their eyes,
Laughing the blood has long been dried
Tonight in your disguise it goes on&amp; on
Wallow... pearls before swine
No you've blown away the sun
Darkened eyes &amp; bitten tongue
Now you've blown away the son.
