Well I'm feelin' left behind
Lord what a waste of time
They're coming to get you, run on
How can i respect your crime
When all you criminals whine
They bought and sold you
Run on, run on, yeah

Well you can call me crazy
Well you can call me wrong
Cause, see i was born a liar
Albatross, fly on, fly on

My home is kind
Man it pays to be blind, well
I promise to for get you, run on, yea
No swallowed pride, No conspiracy lies
Oh, broken promise of virtue, run on
Lord run on

Well you can call me lazy
But I know where I belong, cause
Cause i was born a liar
Albatross, fly on, fly on

With your trust in love
From your god above
Oh i believe
The albatross is me

Well you can call me crazy
You could call me wrong, cause
Cause i was born a liar
Albatross, fly on, fly on

I should have seen the signs
Now the memories fall behind
It was no big loss
Fly on albatross, yeah
