Beginning of this world selled with mankind
Who built a tool to kill a fool and lead the blind
Invent a rule to keep you down &amp; call it sin
Then stand behind the wall and watch the games begin
Separate by class but keep the middle low
In still the order with a border just for show
Give them weapons and let them have their piece of mind
Then tip them off so they can kill what's not their kind &amp; watch them shake like you
If tales come true when judgements due they'll call us all liars
And put us in their hell and set our souls on fire
Remember sin your only friend he brought you through
Hallucinate with hate and watch them shake like you...
