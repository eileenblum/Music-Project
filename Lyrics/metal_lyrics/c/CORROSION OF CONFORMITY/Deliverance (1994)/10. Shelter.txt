Once in awhile you'd be better listening to the fools for a change
I can see it in your eyes, it's the one who's not like you, you despise
I'm no different than you, it's just that I do whatever I want to
that's what sets us apart, I was free from the start, now you're leaving
tell me whose heart is bleeding
so once in awhile you'd be better listening to the fools for a change
What comes around follows and the truth becomes harder to swallow
so bang bang they shoot you down, no one says a word as your body hits the ground
oh pick her up and put her down the crowd screams aloud she's not breathing
and the only hand that reaches is the one alone you've been cheating my friend
tell me whose heart is bleeding again
so once in awhile you'd be better listening to the fools for a change
once in awhile you'd be better listening to the fools for a change
