Deep in the soul of a man who's seen it all- he stands alone with borrowed
I'm standing with two nothings new but they look at you with broken backs and bleeding minds
And tell you they know even though you fall behind
You'll be the one who walks the line standing tall
They're so fragile, but they always find you when you hide...
'Cause you're a broken man in a broken land
And don't they wish they were blessed like you.
The struggle inside of your mind is a waste of time - purest thoughts evaporate
Dark clouds reveal how you feel in your idle time - your own tail becomes the bait
You don't even know even though your blood flows,
Destroy yourself, you're the one you hate - standing tall
They're so fragile, but they always catch you when you're late...
'Cause you're a broken man in a broken land,
And don't they wish they were blessed like you.
Standing tall they look so small with your world upon their shoulders,
But a broken man on broken land looks far beyond his brothers...
Break for the sun you're the one, the chosen one, your time is up your time is due
Cracked like a whip from the hand of a broken man to find out that he's just like you
But you've seen it all in your mind, you've seen it all you built it up &amp; they made it fall
Because you're killing yourself - you're so fragile, but they cannot crush you if you don't crawl..
No I'm a broken man in a broken land
Now I'm a broken man in a broken land...
And don't they wish they were blessed like you
And don't they wish they were blessed like you
And don't they wish they were blessed like you
And don't they wish they were blessed like you
And don't they wish they were blessed like you
Don't they wished they were
Blessed.
