Sleep, sleep, sleep, oh sleep for me
And rest your soul, just like the roses at your feet
Dream, dream, dream, dream awhile for me
And travel far away 'till the distance is complete

There's 13 Angels standing on display
I think they're gonna take you away
One life time gone and now your soul is dead
The angels just shake their heads

Oh faith, faith, faith, have faith for me
I lost it long ago somewhere I shouldn't be
Heart heart heart, save your heart for me
It's the only place I've been with everything I need

There's 13 Angels standing on display
I think they're gonna throw me away

One life time gone and now my soul is dead
The angels just shake their heads

Oh, Maybe I'm a life time soldier never dying, never gettin' older
Maybe I'm a life time soldier lost along the way....

High, high, high, stay high for me
And let me see the things I never thought I'd be
Wait, wait, wait, please wait for me
I've travelled far and wide without a destiny

There's 13 Angels standing on display
I think they're gonna take you away

One life time gone and now my soul is dead
The angels just shake their heads

Oh, Maybe I'm a life time soldier never dying, never gettin' older
Maybe I'm a life time soldier lost along the way....
