New, the sky is clear, you reappear
And I lost my way a million to one
and you come around when the day is done

And I wonder which one knows ?
And I wonder which one goes ?
I'm doublewide.. I'm doublewide

And I don't have a reason, something's gone wrong
And I still don't remember, I been here too long
Gonna lose my way behind the sun
Then I'll come around when the day is done

And I wonder which one knows ?
And I wonder which one goes ?
I'm doublewide.. I'm doublewide

Over time, on judgement day, overdrawn passion play
If I die before I wake, I think I got an even break

I'm doublewide....
