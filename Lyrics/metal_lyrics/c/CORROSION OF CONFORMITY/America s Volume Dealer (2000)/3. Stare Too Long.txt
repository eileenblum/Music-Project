Oh lord I must be crazy, Settled down and I find nothing new..

Older days, they used to matter but I don't care
Cause I got nothin' to lose

And if I stare too long, I might not see you right
Over time, the heart goes out of sight
And if I stare too long, I might not see you right
Close the door. Where the heart is out of sight

Many a dreams across the river
But it's too strong for a boy like me, yeah....

Now you're gone but I still remember
Better days as they wash into the sea

And if I stare too long, I might not see you right
Over time, the heart goes out of sight
And if I stare too long, I might not see you right
Close the door. Where the heart is out of sight

I've got the time but I got no reason
I'm broken down, waiting patiently
Now the sun don't shine for me and that's a different season
but she comes around one more time for me...

And if I stare too long, I think I might go blind
Over time the heart goes out of sight
And if I live too long, I might not treat you right
Close the door....Now you're shining way too bright...
Shine on......
