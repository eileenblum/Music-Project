There's a boy they call the sleepin' man, he's been asleep for days
There's a girl lyin' next to him, following his ways

Dreaming of a foreign place, where the people always pray
Nowhere else to run to...now
So this is where they stay

That's all she wanted to hear
That's all she wanted to hear
Sleep another year....

I will in time forget the order, wake up the sleepin' martyr
Somethin' don't seem right....In you

A broken will to testify, a thorn on either side
Empty bottles lyin' next to him, keeps him satisfied

Voices on that dead end street, make you feel so fine
Wake up son it's time to go, you're runnin' out of time...

And that's all he wanted to hear
That's all he wanted to hear
Sleep another year...

I will in time forget the order, wake up the sleepin' martyr
Somethin' don't seem right..In you

He dreamed until his heart was still or so the story goes..
Can't remember how he got that way cause he's forgot more than he knows...

Drift into a foreign place, seems like yesterday..
Nowhere else to run to...now, alone he starts to pray

And that's all she wanted to hear
That's all she wanted to hear
Sleep another year...

I will in time forget the order, wake up the sleepin' martyr

Hold tight, hold tight, hold tight
Cause it's gonna' be a long night, anytime, everytime....
Anytime In you...
