Sixty feet out of reach, hammer down every time
And we was gittin' it on, gittin' it on
Don't fuck with the stroker, it's 60 over
And I know that we was gittin' it on, gittin' it on

Power down in the hole,
and you was smokin' on the shoulder
Sucked you up like a leech
and now you're limpin' like a Duster
While we was gittin' it on, gittin' it on

Like a D/Class gasser, 4-speed suicide
We was gittin' it on, gittin' it on

Dominatin' the modified, force-fed power grind
And we was gittin' it on, gittin' it on

Power down in the hole
and you was smokin' on the shoulder
Sucked you up like a leach
and now you're limpin' like a Duster
While we was gittin' it on, gittin' it on..

Gittin' it on, Gittin' it on
Got the heavies, Got the heavies
