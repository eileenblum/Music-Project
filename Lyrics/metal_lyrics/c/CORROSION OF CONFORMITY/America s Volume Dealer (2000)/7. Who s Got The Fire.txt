Oh say man, are you still alive, cause I heard your ship was sinking
Back in town, but there's nothin' around, man, I know the feeling'
I'm talkin' bout it

Who's got the fi-yah?
Who's got the fi-yah?
Who's got the fi-yah?
Leave it for the love, and try to call me a liar.

Hey you. Mr. Highball, too young to walk, to old to crawl
Quittin' time, but is your soul better, never mind, never mind
Quit talkin' bout it

Who's got the fi-yah?
Who's got the fi-yah?
Who's got the fi-yah?
Leave it for the love, put me out

To' up, from the Flo' up, I say Stop...wait a minute now Ho' up
Heat come around to hunt you down
I know you know the feelin'
I'm talkin' bout it

Who's got the fi-yah?
Who's got the fi-yah?
Who's got the fi-yah?
Leave it for the love, put me out
