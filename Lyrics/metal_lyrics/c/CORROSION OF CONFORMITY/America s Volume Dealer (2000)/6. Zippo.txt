Amplified on fire, strapped to take you higher
Queens appear, strapped you made it clear

Is everybody with me, is everybody cool
Is anybody lazy, am I the only fool ?

Hell yeah maybe you a roc n rolla
Hey, hey maybe I should of been colder
Ditch that wish and sell your soul

Is everybody with me is everybody cool
Is anybody lazy am I the only fool ?

That's what makes it so damn hard to find her
I was down beat crazy, lumps to make it hazy
Ride on fear, wings they disappear

Is everybody with me, is everybody cool
Is anybody lazy, am I the only fool ?

Hell yeah maybe you a roc n rolla
Hey hey maybe I should of been colder
Ditch that wish and sell your soul

I was down town freaky, strapped you made it tricky
Heads go under, sho ruff gonna roll you over

Is everybody with me is everybody cool
Is anybody lazy am I the only fool ?

Hell yeah maybe you a roc n rolla
Hey, hey maybe I should of been colder
Ditch that wish and sell your soul

Ditch that wish and sell your soul
Life that touch and make your body rockah
Make yo body rockah...Make yo body rockah...
