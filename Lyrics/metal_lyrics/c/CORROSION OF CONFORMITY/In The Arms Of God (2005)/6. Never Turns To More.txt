Shackled down to wasted days
I think it's time to break these chainS
Planets align from the inside
The bitter truth still mystifies
Where is this king that wears no crown
Driftin' behind because I'm sliding down
Helpless man you can't ignore
Watch your back âcause never turns to more
Just like before
Just like before
Just like before
Just like before
Just like
Wise fool with devil's hands
I broke the rules to understand
Words to say from far away
As distant worlds fade to grey
Where is this queen that holds be down
Drifted away without a sound
Helpless man worse than before
You lost your ways âcause never turned to more
Ever more
Ever more
Ever more
Ever more
Never turns to more
Time has slipped and shut the door
Never turns to more
And we lost the days that we thought were ever more
Never more
Never more
Never more
Out of sight of mind
You took me to a different place, different time
I believed in you
Out of sight mind,
You took me to a different place every time
I believed in you
But the truth is what I never knew
Navigate through skies of blue
Homeward path long over due
The will to live is an oversight
What you give for just one night
Where is this king that wears no crown
I'm driftin' behind and I'm sliding down
Helpless man can't ignore watch your back âcause never turns to more
Just like before
Just like before
Just like before
Just like before
Never turns to more
Time has slipped and shut the door
Never turns to more
And we lost the days that we thought were ever more
