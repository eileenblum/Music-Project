Never bitched never moaned never gave
The king the time
Never lied never cried never gave the queen a dime
Still it seemed to me we were losing all the time
But underneath we can breath and were standing
On our own never known never know
Running while your world's on fire
Back to rob you blind
Blistered sins consume the liar all the time
Never break never crack never turned into a stone
Never crawl never fall never bow beneath the throne
Never could believe because it was never shown
But underneath we can breath and were standing
On our own never known never know
Now your running while your world's on fire
Back to rob you blind
Blistered sins consume the liar all the time
A shattered god once made of stone
Took me a side took me aside and made me whole
I once was blind but now I see
The blistered walls in front of me!
Never breath never sang never call
Never died never flied never fall
Never break never bleed never rest
On our own we control everlast
Running while your world's on fire
Back to rob you blind
Blistered sins consume the liar all the time
