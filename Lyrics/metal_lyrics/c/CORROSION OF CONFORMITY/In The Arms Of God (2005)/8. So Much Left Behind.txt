Rising reveals an angel
My burning heart was over thrown
She came to take away this pain boy
But what I felt was never shown
So much left unknown
I found the road but I can't turn back
Over looked out of time
So much left behind
Drifted away reality follow the heart no better
Future dreams will never be, never means forever
And the path is hard to find, when there's
So much left behind
Beauty flows just like a river
Drowns my soul, purifies
Drift away into forgiveness
Now I'm left to wonder why, No tears to cry
Words to you were long over due
Stormy skies are over head, so much left unsaid
Drifted away reality follow the heat no better
Future dreams will never be, never means forever
And the path is hard to find, when there's
So much left behind
So much left behind
I guess we gotta move on
Gonna keep on rollin'
I guess we gotta move on
Gonna keep on rollin
