Some people know the order,
But they're hard to find
Some people roll you over
And then they blow your mind
Some have the will to occupy
Some people can't remember
But that's nothin' new
Some people kill for lovin'
Including me and you
But I guarantee your time is due
I guarantee your time is due [x2]
Black fire
Illuminate the chosen few
Liars assassinate what's come for you
Distant winds spread salvation
And beat you down with shame
Once redeemed is gone forever
Never be unchained
The future steals what once remained
Some people speak the truth now
When there's no one else to blame
Then they try to beat you down boy
If you don't do the same
Choose me or choose eternal flame
Choose me or choose eternal flame
Black fire
Illuminate the chosen few
Liars assassinate what's come for you
Beware back slider
You need to know
Just why we were
Cause I might be losin' my mind
Deception of your mind
Chasing what was once divine
Onward for the truth absurd
I think we finally know just why we were...
Alone
Nobody knows the answer
They never question why
And blind faith will lead you nowhere
It happens every time
Spirit shines and now it's time to die
Lights dim and you can't remember
You pray you're homeward bound
Kill the dream forget the memories
That were so profound
The revolution dies with out a sound
The revolution dies with out a sound
Black fire
Illuminate the chosen few
Liars assassinate what's come for you
Beware back slider
You need to know, just why we were
Cause soon you'll be losin' your mind
