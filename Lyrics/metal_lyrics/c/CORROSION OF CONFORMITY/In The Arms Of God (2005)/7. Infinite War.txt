Deafening sound
Blackens the sky
Ashes rain down
Puritans die
Infinite war
Infinite war
Infinite war
Overlord, bring decibels of revolt
Two minutes and counting
Kill to remember
This war is a knife
Which will never surrender
Infinite war âdeafening soundâ
Infinite war âdeafening soundâ
Infinite war âdeafening soundâ
Overlord, bring decibels of revolt
Imperial hubris unholy oxy moron
Infinite contradiction
Become the enemy to defeat yourself
Kill switch engaged
Enemy sound
Snake bit nation
Burns to the ground
Infinite war âdeafening soundâ
Infinite war âdeafening soundâ
Infinite war âdeafening soundâ
Overlord, bring decibels of revolt
Infinite repetition
Never lessens a lie
Unless or until
All reason's eclipsed in denial
Infinite war âdeafening soundâ
Infinite war âdeafening soundâ
Infinite war âdeafening soundâ
Infinite
REVOLT!!!
