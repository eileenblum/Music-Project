I remember you seems like yesterday
Do you remember me? I got lost on the way
Wrong muddy road is nothing new
We stand but this river is washing through
River rise from tear drops without warning
Float away while flooding yesterday
I'll be gone I won't be back by morning
So rise river rise wash this place away
Clean my dirty soul so I can save it for judgement day
This place will bring you down
More than you'll ever know
Turn around it s do or die
I think it's time to go
If you feel the same then you can stay
I'll fly I never liked it anyway
(wishper) sun of the morning star
River rise from teardrops without warning
Float away while flooding yesterday
I'll be gone I won't be here in the morning
So rise river rise wash this place away
Clean my dirty should so I can save it for judgement day
Ah! Ah!
River rise from teardrops without warning
Float away while flooding yesterday
I'll be gone I won't be back by morning
So rise river rise wash this place away
Clean my dirty soul so I can save for judgement day
