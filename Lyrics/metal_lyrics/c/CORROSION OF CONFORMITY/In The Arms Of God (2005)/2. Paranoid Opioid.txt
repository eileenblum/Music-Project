Life shuts you down life shuts you down
Suffocate inside when overkill surrounds
Pain kills the time pain kills the time
Depression bends the rules and now you're
Losing your mind!
Close your eyes
Another sunrise over and over!
Burn by the spoon and now you're dying
Too soon!
Paranoid opioid
Paranoid opioid
Got you living in hell got you living in hell
Delusional truth got you under a spell
Death is on your back death is on your back
And you can't survive
When nihilism attacks
Close your eyes another sunrise
Over and over!
Burn by the spoon
And now you're dying too soon!
Paranoid opioid
Paranoid opioid
Sun breaks through useless shade
Fall in love with a endless haze
Hard to find peace of mind
Burn by the spoon
Now you're dying to soon
Have you seen my mother
If the blood that your pumping is heartless
And you can't seem to make up your mind
And your soul is now shrouded in darkness
Just like your dying for the very first time
Just remember what reality taught you
And it wasn't always just for the thrill
You bow down to the one that lost you
And now the devil's going in for the kill
(you're in the arms of god)
Now you're six feet down now your six feet down
Suicidal black and unholy ground
Guess we'll never learn guess we'll never learn
Too slow to live too fast to burn
Close your eyes another sunrise
Burn by the spoon now you're dying too soon!
