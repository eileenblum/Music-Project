Distant wings bring you down like a soldier
Alive inside but your soul getting colder
And there's nothing left nowhere to hide
Nothing left its genocide
You're gonna find out
It is that way becausse it is
It is that way because it is
It is that way because it is
Over now... and I'm going down
Big old wall going fall like reliegion
As you die inside while you pray for redemption
And there's nothing left nowhere to hide
Nothing left its genocide
You're gonna find out
It is that way because it is
It is that way because it is
It is that way because it is
Over now... and I'm going down
Nothing left nowhere to hide
Nothing left its genocide
Your gonna find out
It is that way because it is
It is that way because it is
It is that way because it is
Over now... and I'm going down...
So what do you want me to be
I'm the same old beast you hate to see
Just like the heavens when the light recedes
I'm forever black without a need
And there's nothing left and nothing more
Cause you lost the battle and the war
So what are you standing here for!
