Scorn by your petrified eyes
Reborn with unjustified lies
With no apologies shown
Demonology known
I think we're dying too fast
When the fury exceeds
Only the angles believed
It couldn't last couldn't last
It wouldn't last it can't last
Trial! No denial! Guilty by the hand
Of the power hungry man
You're unholy again
Just ask for stonebreakers [x2]
Yeah!
On high with wicked on the mountain
On high with wicked on the moun tain
Torn by the need to violate
Morn as the pure congregate
There's no need to commit
Just burn the heritic
There's nothing gained once again
It was lies all along
A disguised siren's song
What a sin what a sin what a sin!
Thieves disbelieve guilty by the hand of
The power hungry man
You're unholy again
Just ask for stonebreakers [x2]
Yeah... alright!
I'm on high I'm on high I'm on high
Just like the wicked on the mountain
Torn by the need to violate
Morning as the pure congregate
I'm on high I'm on fire
I'm on holy
Just like the wicked on the mountain!
