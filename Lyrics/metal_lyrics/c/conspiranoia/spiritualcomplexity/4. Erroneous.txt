Rusty cold nail, deep in my vein, encore
Words drowned in tears, absorbing my fears, no more
Bitter blood stains, mind boggling chains, up tore
Torturing gaze, caught in a daze, hardcore

Eradication - my darkest part is dying - mental disease

Anticipation - the flame of treason's burning - erroneous

Bitter blood stains, mind boggling chains, up tore
Torturing gaze, caught in a daze, hardcore

Erroneous, always lost inside the massive amount of insane thoughts.
[Laughing]
No fucking comprehension nothing, absolute zero. so many fucking lies
Man, I can't fucking take it no more...

Lost in the web of faith, reaching my destiny
Forced to become a slave, refusing my tendencies

I'm inside you

Rusty cold nail, deep in my vein, encore
Words drowned in tears, absorbing my fears, no more
Bitter blood stains, mind boggling chains, up tore
Torturing gaze, caught in a daze, hardcore
