All these times their countless lies are breaking through my brain
Paranoia false euphoria, the blade of truth's slaying my dreams, let me out
Hear me out
Crawling sickness in their preachings, I can't take it anymore
Betrayed by their fraud I'm reaching out for signs of hope

Stretching my senses through the peak of fear, isolation
Melting my strength while I'm lacking dishonor, divided

Trying to see myself through the mirror
Who am I, my identity is fading away
Who's to blame, I'm heavily breathing
No emotions, completely loss of feeling, I'm dying again...
Silence... code of silence...

Sick creations deep in to the roots of corruption
Rotting system false messiahs message on my wall of life, total denial
Be blind and follow, this life feels hollow I cant pretend

Stretching my senses through the peak of fear, isolation
Melting my strength while I'm lacking dishonor, divided

Trying to see myself through the mirror
Who am I, my identity is fading away
Who's to blame, I'm heavily breathing
No emotions, completely loss of feeling, I'm dying again...
Silence...
