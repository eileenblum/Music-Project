Disposition of the offence
Punished to the core
Enslaved and bound in chains of fear and darkness
I can breath no more
Broken limits of forgiveness

Endless sorrow

Collapsed desire of my senses

I am the maker of my future
No one to blame for my own fate
The unconditional amusement
No time to feed my own decay

Feed my own decay

The world of subconscious, the bitter, the worst

Hear me out, hear me out

Preparing their decisions
So regretfully upon
The sacrifice the pain the wait the anger
Time to breath once more
I will never deny

No one to hold my hand, I'm on my own again

Collapsed desire of my senses

I am the maker of my future
No one to blame for my own fate
The unconditional amusement
No time to feed my own decay

Feed my own decay

The world of subconscious, the bitter, the worst

Hear me out [reversed], hear me out [reversed]
