Now its time to think what matters and whats real -
Focus on the important before its too late -
Look around you smell the fear,
This is what you gave them... just accept the facts.
It doesn't matter if you win the game...
Everything you've won will go back into the box...
So lets be real and think now...
Ask inside you for the helping hand.
Take your chance, to refuse and to resist... to insist,
To break free from these mind trick chains...
Leave the wealth behind you,
Take the chance to breathe free from all the dirt...

My inner self, my only hope, I'm looking at you through the mirror of my senses...

Turn the page and feel, and realise...
