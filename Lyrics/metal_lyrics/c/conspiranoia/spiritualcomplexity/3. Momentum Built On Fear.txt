Termination deadly infection desperate call
Virus in my brain that I'm trying to heal it on my own
Deep in mental hell made of vortex cell
Seeking light and hope caught in my own thorn
Momentum built on fear,
Its death is coming near

Paranoia, through sacred paths I'm going
Pure dysphoria, cheering for the end

Restrained reason (that) I'm dying for
Enlightened wisdom (that) I'm dreaming of
Trapped into shadows of the insane
Unveiling knowledge that lies below

Rise the torch and burn the sadness deep into my soul
Id rather have a foolish trick to gain the lost control
Diluted into dust my blood is pumping fast
Fading memories ignorance is bliss

Get me out of here
Wipe my last tear

Paranoia, through sacred paths I'm going
Pure dysphoria, cheering for the end

Restrained reason (that) I'm dying for
Enlightened wisdom (that) I'm dreaming of
Trapped into shadows of the insane
Unveiling knowledge that lies below
