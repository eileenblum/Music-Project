In taberna quando sumus, (When we are in the tavern)
non curamus, quid sit humus, (we do not think about mortality)
sed ad ludum properamus, (but get right down to gambling)
cui semper insudamus. (which always raises a sweat)
quid agatur in taberna, (What goes on in the tavern)
ubi nummus est pincerna, (where a penny gets you a drink)
hoc est opus, ut queratur. (if that is what you want to know)
sed quid loquar, audiatur! (then listen to what I tell you)

Bibit hera, bibit herus, (The mistress drinks, so does the master)
bibit miles, bibit clerus, (the soldier drinks, so does the cleric)
bibit ille, bibit illa, (that man drinks, that woman drinks)
bibit seruus cum ancilla. (the servant drinks with the maid)

Quidam ludunt, quidam bibunt, (Some gamble, some drink)
quidam indiscrete uiuunt. (some live without discretion)
sed in ludo qui morantur, (From those who spend their time in gambling)
ex hiis quidam denudantur; (some are stripped bare)
quidam ibi uestiuntur, (some win clothes)
quidam saccis induuntur (some are dressed in sacks)
ibi nullus timet mortem, (there no-one fears death)
sed pro Bacho mittunt sortem. (but for the wine they throw dice)
