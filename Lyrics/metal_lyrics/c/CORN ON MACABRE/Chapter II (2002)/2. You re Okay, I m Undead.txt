Discouraged over things unsaid
Turn the page while you're ahead
Some circumstance would make us friends
How to meet and influence
I wish this chase would never end
Run, Run, Run, I'm still ahead
When you fall, I'll eat your head
I'm on your heels, in the end
You're okay, I'm undead
You're okay, I'm undead
You're okay, I'm undead
You're okay, I'm undead
