Religion, I don't get you, but we'll team up today
I'm mad at science too, from me it took something away
They can clone sheep, why not rebuilt the dead
Make something useful like Orwell's head
Dear religion, I wanna believe in aliens again
Dear religion, I wanna believe in aliens again
Thanks to science now, there are no radar men on mars
What a laser ment to me was not a fax machine
Robots could be serving food and running everything
Instead, we have an extra sheep
Lets all begin to sing
Dear religion, I wanna believe in aliens again
Dear religion, I wanna believe in aliens again
