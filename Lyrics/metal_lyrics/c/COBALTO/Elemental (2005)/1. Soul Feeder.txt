I used to feel I had no soul, just living without a goal
I envied people who could live with a smile on their face
Walking in the cold damp lands
Seeking for an absent someone

I thought I had no place to go, that I was down upon my luck
I took so long to realize that I should face up to my life
Asking for someone's support
I can barely open my eyes

Feed my soul
Gimme the strenght
I trust you

Can you feed my soul with dreams?
Can you guide me all the way
'Cause I'm scared and all alone
Please just feed my soul

So you just came into my life and held my hands so tight
By the time I looked in your eyes I just could feel
You are the one I can trust
I feel so alive by your side

I feel inspiration running inside me
When I realize the purity of your help
I just wanna grasp you and never let you go
