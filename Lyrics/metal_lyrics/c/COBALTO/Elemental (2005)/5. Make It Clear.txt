I cannot make myself clear
I get so damn confused
'Cause it seems I cannot steer
My own ideas out of my mind

What I am seems nonsense
I will not deny myself

Straight words that I try to express
You don't get the sense at all
I know I am not that good at speeches
But you're the best at fooling around

You thought I could just deny
All my goals to please you
I know what kind of person you are:
Whatever you touch it always gets dry

I'll just go on to reach my goals
And I can say I'm proud of myself
Now I trust myself more than I used to
And I'm aware of all the things I can have
