Cast a spell on my hate - Enchant, transform, modify
Kill me, determine my fate - Stop me, I'll uncover your lies

See where your attitudes have led you
Realize what your system has done

Your artificial world cannot challenge me

Biocentric nations will start to rise
No god will absolve or exempt your allies

Achieve perfection, teach me a lesson
Create your army, empower your clones

I will never say what you wanna hear
