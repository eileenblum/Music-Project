Things haven't benn the same since then
A cold feeling embraces me pushing me as deep as it can
Even though it's hurting me, I'm not sure if it's time to stand again

Can you fell it? You just cannot deny
I have always been there supporting you

Sometimes you must live the pain
Getting hurt will make you stronger
'Cause even in deep pain you gain
Learning that life can be unfair

No matter what you feel someone will away dare!

Living day by day, trying to heal the pain
That surrounds you, driving your life away
