Starving people claim for food
You don't take a single look
They are not the fucking guilty
You're just acting like a fool

Can't face all these faces
The are all so sad eyes
It's hard to believe that some peolple keep saying
"I don't care"

Harmless parents keep their battle
To stop the cry of little kids
They can see any salvation
Tied up hands, no reaction

Speechless eyes in your mind
