Sometimes I fade away
Cannot disguise what I'm felling inside
And what is real to me
May drive my mind completely out of control

You can't have a clue how I would fell with your silence
Shut your eyes, open your mind, unspoken words can really hurt
Ignore me, beat me up, it will decrease my pain
I just ask what is wrong, please let me try to live

Sometimes I fade away
Cannot disguise what I'm felling inside
And what is real to me
May drive my mind

Release my mind
I wanna feel I'm alive
I am so sure
About what I feel inside

How could you strike back for something I've never done?
My own fault, I assume, to get involved with you
I wish I've never met someone like you in my life
Can you feel stitching in? But I'm sure I'll get through

Take a look at me and tell me what you see
You cannot get away
No matter as fast as you try, no matter as hard as you try
You cannot push me down!
