I got a feeling I can hardly express
I see a fucking tough journey coming along the air

That can't be avoided and it is useless to walk away of it
'Cause it really doesn't matter when it will surely happen

Falling to the void

Enjoy the party while you're a part of it
Clean up the mess, get the fuck out this shit
Start it over again

An empty land full of people everywhere
Disturbed minds looking angels on TV
Tryin to get the sense of life on the screen
Denying your life for stupid things
