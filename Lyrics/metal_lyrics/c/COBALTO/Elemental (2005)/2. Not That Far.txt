When I close my eyes, all fear is gone
And I feel safe at home
The sun is shining again, no pain remained
But the fog is in the backdoor

I have walked away from this pain
But I cannot feel heat again

My mood sways as time goes by day after day
I look around and cannot find that engaging smile

Brightness has gone, I'm alone
Just can't breathe without the gist of my goal
I'll look ahead, guide my fate
There's no way for me not to be there

Wherever you are, it's not that far

I'll stand by at the right time
To raise my head again and face the brightest eyes
Look before you leap, I will just do the same
