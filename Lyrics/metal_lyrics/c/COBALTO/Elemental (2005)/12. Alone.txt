You feel you're alone
You see no help, you see no one
It seems a fucking dead place
Because there's no one to face

You feel fucking alone
But you can't help!

Shadows moving all around
I don't feel the fucking ground
You start thinking of your fears
Keep whispering to you

You're fucking alone!

You see someone by your side
But you know they're all aside
You start running on the space
Feeling so fuckin' unsafe

I feel so alone...
