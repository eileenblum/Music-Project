Can't live as I desireas if I was a liar
But it's not my fault, I'm just following your fucking stupid rules
It hasn't to do with choice, it's just a matter of voice
They got the power so your voice will always be unheard

Try to speak up!

You're not my goal to die for
Can't be in this forever

My pride is all I have, I won't give up on this
I don't give a shit about your thoughts if you can't respect me
You ruined my life, you fucked me up
You'd better watch out 'cause now I'm back
