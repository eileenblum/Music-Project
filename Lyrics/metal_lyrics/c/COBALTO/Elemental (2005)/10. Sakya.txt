Bright lines are placed in order
To start your sick mind disorder
Close your eyes and fit your noose
Use your lung to pull the trigger

The bullet has taken its way
Destruction is just beginning
But you can't feel the pain
'Cause you disdain the truth

Do you really wanna sniff your life away?
Being alive without living it's a shame!

When it hits you it seems good
Taking all the pain away
Creating a safe and cozy place
But in a flash it's all gone

Back to reallity you feel how much it hurts and destroys
But you can no longer live for real, kill yourself, no big deal
There's no way out to you!
