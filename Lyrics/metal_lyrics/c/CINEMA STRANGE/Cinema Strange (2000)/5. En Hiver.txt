I love to hate you! I am in winter.
Frostbite hath claimed me, I succumb to numbness!

[Chorus]
Freezing men don't laugh at murder!
...Bleeding naked in the bathtub!
Open windows tempt the savory!
Women's heads float just as easily!

Within the confines of crystal, reflected is my loathing!
Under ice and still, chill waters fish bite stiff men and children!

In the fog, in the woods, at midnight, in a land where it's always winter, I cut the thin skin of my ankles and the wind follows me like army.
Lashing like a bullwhip in the arctic, I fling icicles like bee-sting!
Stuck under glass, in the sphere, in the snowstorm, I shut my eyes and sleep in sleet!
