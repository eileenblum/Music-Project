No prey from understanding vats of men...
The victims bite their tails and find no flesh to witness!
Teeth and claws all seeketh out the one to neutralize their standing underneath the promenade where horse and man all bleed the first course...
Understanding...
Flesh to witness...
Bleed the first course...

[Chorus]
I cannot fall when the vats are full!
My eyes are rolling back, the lives that stole themselves shall look for me...
Their fingers neutralized, aroused, know the way to serve the first course.
They bite their tails no longer! And I fall down...

I walk alone, I've walked alone!
To tread as lightly, bring forth detection...
This serial mind, replay the scene...
I'm loath to witness! No end for me! All alone...
Bring forth detection...
Loath to witness...
