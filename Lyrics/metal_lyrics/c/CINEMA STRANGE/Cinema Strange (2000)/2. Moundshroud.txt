Tom skeleton, it's time to have some fun! So grab your trick or treat, the day of the dead has begun!
Carapace and clavicle, Moundshroud takes you there!
Lady Egypt fascinate and gargoyles in the air!

[Chorus]
Tommy-boy, eat your candy skull!
Tommy-boy, eat your candy skull!
Tommy-boy, eat your candy skull!
Tommy-boy, eat your candy skull!
Carapace! Clavicle! Carapace! Clavicle! Carapace! Clavicle! Carapace! Clavicle!

Instantaneous, intravenous fear in the moon-black suit!
You feel the wind and taste the leaves like dead-bone scattered loot!
Crack the best, your whip is the test... flee from Mummy's arms...
Under his knife, beware the scythe and Samhain's other charms!
