Please come near me,
Will you hold me?
I am leaking so very badly!
Will you stop up my holes?
If your answer is,
"No, I'm busy!"
I will follow you out to the garden.
I can smell you from three miles away!
If your answer is,
"Get me dirty!"
You can stop up my holes so nicely!
I won't leak anymore!
But if your answer is,
"No, I'm sleepy!"
I will stare at your face with longing
I will chew on your face
I will chew on your face
I will chew on your face...
And then the night comes like an unfolding, unscented flower
I'll be sent away.
