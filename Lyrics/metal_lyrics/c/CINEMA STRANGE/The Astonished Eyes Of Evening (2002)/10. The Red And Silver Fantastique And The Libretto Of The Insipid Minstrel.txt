"I drag my right arm through the sawdust... he hasn't opened his eyes in months. He was a small dog. He's lost his hat and he never made a very convincing primate. I was painted red and silver. Now I'm filthy, lost my dollar, and my dog, he rots.

"There were children calling my name. They spat upon my paper shoes. I licked their ice cream. I sang through cardboard. I looked at shadows. Don't know who watched... perhaps they hate me. I was painted red and silver. Now I'm ugly, lost my flower, and I'm seeing spots."

Thanks to indie_last for sending track #6 lyrics.
