[1.] She phoned. We rush through milk and mush. We laugh, make swords from old tree-house boards.

[Chorus One]
Outside, there's Fred and his sister, two sets of twins. We've got skinned knees, unusual stones, and lately, him.

[2.] His buttons are coins from faraway archipelagos. He winks; our slingshots hurl screams and tiny things with wings!

[Bridge One]
Hanging dripping shirts and sheets, a washerwoman hears our feet a-stomping by and when we cry, "Midsummer's here!" she blinks each eye. And then we sing the song he taught; we buzz like bees and howl a lot! She withers into five years old; hands on hips, her stance is bold! She joins our marching army, laughing, waves a stick, afraid of nothing!

[Bridge Two]
And he's fun to follow! He points and Mary-Ann's grown a tail! And his eyes are gleaming! And Mr. Tucker, there are hoof-prints on your tiles! And he never tires! He could dig to China hunting worms! And he chats with saplings! They laugh and sway, say he speaks archly!

[3.] Many wars, many battles by noontime we're hungry! Didn't know, under bark, under stones you can eat those! Many fins, many wings. Many bites, many stings! Didn't know; under petals they'll tell tales 'ere the flowers fold!

[Chorus Two]
And on towards night his beard turns white, his eyes are dull and he says, "My voice is a cobweb wisp; we're a toe towards snow but I'll live again."
