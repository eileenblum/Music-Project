Deep down in my cellar hole I craft bulbs that grow, grow, GROW!
No one sees and no one knows. In this I act alone!
Wilting down those wooden stairs I poke and prod at botany!
Exhalations in the yellow light, my fingers creak and I sing out!
Deep down in my cellar hole I go
No one sees a thing so no one knows
