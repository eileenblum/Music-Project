Crack Rock Steady,
Are you ready to stop
The rotten blue menace?
Let's go kill us a cop.
Crack Rock Steady,
Are you ready?
Living above the law!

Po' little lice, the po' little screws,
The whitest gang crew, the hated boys in blue.
Like scabei on the street, they infest the beat,
Fucking my life but I won't admit defeat to them!
Above the law, above the law come now,
No copper will be safe till they are dead and done now.
Let's lay em down low, let's hang em up high,
Let's take all of these piggies, and have them crucified!

Hardcore, rugged and raw,
On the streets of New York, we live above the fucking law.
It don't matter the color of your skin,
As long as you not scandolous, commit no sin to me,
Or my tribe.
Would not be wise.
Time to smell the ganja, open up your fucking eyes.
Kick back, keep your attitude in check,
And give the crack rock steady much respect.

Don't ya know that satan is the man?
So listen very close because we got a little plan:
We're gonna have to execute some rich important people,
Gonna burn down all the churches and topple all the steeples.
See a frown? turn that cross upside down.
Grab a gun or baseball bat, let's go to fuckin town!
Let's kill the police, I'll be saying little more,
But when the cops come to your door,
Don't forget the choice is yours!
