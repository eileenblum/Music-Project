It feels like jesus on the cross.
It's so religious in it's loss:
A graven image in the mud,
Like when I shed my precious blood.

I am a loser,
I am satan,
I am jesus christ,
I'm me.
There are no winnners in this fucked reality. [x2]

Atrophic interludes weave through my life far too often
For me to fight the biggest enemies.
I have no feelings, like love or pain, it makes me go insane
When I see what's happening to me... I say:

I am a loser,
I am satan,
I am jesus christ,
I'm me.
There are no winnners in this fucked reality. [x2]

There are no idols, no heroes in a world of death.
It's all a joke and so are you,
And so am I... think? just look and see...
It's a fucked reality. [x4]
