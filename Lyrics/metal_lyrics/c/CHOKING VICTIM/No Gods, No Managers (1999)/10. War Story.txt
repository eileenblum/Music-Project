You thought uncle sam wanted you
But you were used, you were just abused
I try to tell you time and time again
The only war worth winning is the war thats within

You played right into uncle sams hands
Where is the glory in complying with demands
You were used to defend world dominitation
Where is the honor in being an abomination?

And I dont see the glory in your war stories
It was just your turn to burn and get burned

You thought that you had something to prove
But yer just seeing colors, not red &amp; white just blue
Your whole life has always been the same
First you were tamed then you were ashamed

You played right into uncle sams hands
Where is the glory in complying with demands
You were used to defend world dominitation
Where is the honor in being an abomination?

And I dont see the glory in your war stories
It was just your turn to burn and get burned
