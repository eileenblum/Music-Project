The many burning bridges that I have crossed
Have led me to this plane of all abandonment
The many inner evils that I have stalked
Have left me with too many demons to circumvent

Self created, self induced entrapment
Evolution through the era of detachment
That which arises is no longer me
But that which I have destroyed my soul to be

Much needed, the era of seclusion
Necessity, the separation phase

Wandering one's own mind there is nowhere
Nowhere to turn, nowhere to run and hide
Into this prison I intentionally climb
Severing ties

Self created, soul reduced
Cut free of society's noose
That which arises is no longer me
It's the assimilation of what was, is, and shall be

Much needed, the era of seclusion
Necessity, the separation phase
Much needed, the era of seclusion, era of detachment
Necessity, the separation phase

Leave me be as I mutate
and shed the final faces of this bodily imprisonment
To the creature which I have become

Dismantled and alone, but not lost
With newfound inner strength

Much needed, the era of seclusion
Necessity, separation
In this era of seclusion, era of detachment
Necessity, the separation phase
