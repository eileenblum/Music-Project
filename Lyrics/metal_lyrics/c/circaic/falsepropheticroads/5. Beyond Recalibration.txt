I am prototype, virus, and parasite
I am prototype, broadcasting fright into oneâs own mind

Intercepting reason
Interfere with conceptual design
Growing with hate and treason
Gears turn mechanisms wind

Disconnect from mechanical ties
These lines tangle in my eyes
Remove truth from these programmed lies
Lines bend, fragment, and amend

Battle not demons within
Recalibrate programming on the origins of sin

Sedation, incision
Mechanical reinterpretation
Bandage, recover within
And never oppose he who holds the wires again

Deciphering logic
Rewind to the truth and begin
Internal malfunction
Self destruction, undecipher illusion

Disconnect from mechanical ties
These lines tangle in my eyes
Remove truth from these programmed lies
Lines bend, fragment, and amend

Sedation, incision
Battling not these demons
This hate is never out of season

Save me as I'm pulling back the wires
Unblind me, give me sight
Recalibrate, release me from this lockdown
Open my eyes

Growing with hate and treason
Gears turn, mechanisms wind
Growing through this detachment
Of surgically embedded spine

Deactivate mechanical sheep
Immerse in unending sleep
Unbinding, system to overheat
The evolution of disease

Deciphering logic
Rewind to the truth and begin
Internal malfunction
Self destruction, undecipher illusion

Disconnect from mechanical ties
These lines tangle in my eyes
Remove truth from these programmed lies
Lines bend, fragment, and amend
