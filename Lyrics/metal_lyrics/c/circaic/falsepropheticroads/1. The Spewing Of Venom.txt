Rise, awake

For far too long we have been dormant
For far too long we have been lying in wait
Awaiting our call to arms again
Hibernation, no longer to stay hidden

The time has come for the spewing of venom again
The time is now to spread forth new infection
The venom boiling inside must be released, set free
May the lust of hatred once more take over

Take over

For far too long we have been trapped here
For far too long we have been so far away
Awaiting our call to arms again
Under deception, slithering from shadow to shade

Peering back through treacherous pathways
The trails we have traveled
The blood left in our shadows
For we have been betrayed

The time has come for the spewing of venom again
The time is now to spread new infection
The venom boiling inside must be released, set free
May the lust of hatred take over

Take over, instilling hatred inside

We must arrive with evil and hate
The shackles with which we were banished
We break

For far too long we have been oppressed
For far too long the shadows have been our disguise
Rebirth, reawakening, for far too long we have been awaiting
Awaiting our call, a new time to arise

The time has come for the spewing of venom again
Time is now to spread new infection
The venom boiling inside must be released, set free
May the lust of hatred take over

Take over, instilling hatred inside
