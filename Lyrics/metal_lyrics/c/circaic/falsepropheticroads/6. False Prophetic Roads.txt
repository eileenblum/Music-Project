Isolation, how have I arrived here?
Through many paths I have walked

Quiet serenity, this uneasy peace
Snake like symptom of disease
Devoid of venom, detoxification begins
How long until the waves come crashing again?

Suppressed brutality
The fury raging within me
Suppressed the eternal, internal grind
Which may lay dormant but shall never die

Metamorphosis, leave nothing behind

This internal trembling
Organs decay, vital decomposing
Hidden scars, truth foretelling
From which deceit cannot hide, exposing

My sanity died once I crawled inside this cave
My mind is fuel to self decay 

Death is the only way out of here
Desertion of life, trapped alone with my fears

Onward I travel through endless roads

Fading ruins of trials past are all that still stands
Remnants of memories on now barren land
Onward I travel through endless roads with no end in sight
Devoid of life, my soul in decline

Deterioration of sanity
Mental self treachery
Thought interwoven with rage
Become your own enemy

The past has become shaded in black

With no recollection of how, or where from I've arrived
Illusions of memories

Impossibility to retrace my own tracks
To call upon lifetimes past
Unclear identity
The face peering back through the glass

This internal trembling
Metamorphosis, leave nothing behind
Unknowing the cause, this transformation
Decrepit body, new soul arise, shattered emotions from self-fulfilling lies

Isolation, how have I arrived here?
Through many paths I have walked

I possess the voice of death
Decaying sounds of putrefaction resonate
I possess the word of insanity

This internal trembling
Organs decay, vital decomposing

Death is the only way out of here
Desertion of life, trapped alone
With death, the only way out of here
Desertion of life, trapped alone with my fears
