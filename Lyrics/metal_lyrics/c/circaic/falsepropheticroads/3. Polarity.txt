Blood vessels break
I can barely see through my eyes
Infuriating convulsions tear through me
My fists clench, violently shake
I feel the blood course through my veins
Inducing rage, inducing spite
And appeasing ill intention
Morality obscured by aggression

Carried upon these wings of euphoria
Unreal bliss intoxicates me

Crashing to reality once more
Vile disease, full of disgust
This influx of ill intention
The spasms are all I can take
Intensity of anger, tremors of hate

Carried upon these wings I begin to fly high
Ignoring the impending plummet that I deny

My mind is too well versed in rationalizing
These distant ends of the spectrum
Eons apart yet always intertwining
My mind is torn over which side to take, polarity

Through darkness a light gleams down from the sky

Once more I can see the way
Euphoria flowing through my veins
Darkness to the side
But that I need not deny
Though I know the shadows lurk near
I'm running away from fear
You will never find me here
For on still I deny

Once more the blood surges through my eyes
The fury so great that I can barely stand by
I feel the snap, the last vein to break
Madness intoxicates, as temperatures rise

My mind is too well versed in rationalizing
These distant ends of the spectrum
Eons apart yet always intertwining
My mind is torn over which side to take, polarity

Clawing at my throat again
This rage I can't hide
For I cannot endure
I can no longer harbor this flame

My fears spiraling down
But I am numb, I deny

Leave me be
What's wrong with me?
Why does this convulsing hate
Consume me?

My mind is too well versed in rationalizing
These distant ends of the spectrum
Eons apart yet always intertwining
My mind is torn over which side to take

My fears spiraling down
But I am numb, I deny

Ignoring the impending plummet that I deny

Polarity
Blood vessels break
I can barely see through my face
Infuriate
Convulsing hate
Open my veins and let loose the rage
This ends today
Blood vessels break
