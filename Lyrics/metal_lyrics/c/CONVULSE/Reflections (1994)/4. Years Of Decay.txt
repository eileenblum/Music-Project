My eyes are not blind but still they can't see to the other side
sometimes they're in our minds reminding how it sometimes was
I repent my own existence I want to look back inside embryonic world
My eyes... but still... sometimes they're... reminding...
Years of the decay are back and I'm insane
Strange voices whisper my name calling me to join their game
while I'm in sleep, so deep and sweet the past wakes me up and I've learned to see
