I've seen the rivers flowing into your arms
I've heard the wind gently singing in the trees
I've seen the snow covering the land but why the branch bent down
and broke off to the frozen ground
Touch me and give relief join this drop in your seas
Shall your wind rise from the bones to dust
and shall it reach the place where the flowers
bloom, though my eyes are bathered in mourning
tears, please offer us to your good wishes and may our lives be fulfilled
