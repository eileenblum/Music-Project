We ring your bell or knock on the backdoor
we creep like thieves in the blackest night
even shadows are missing so you can't resist
fast open your door and truth hits like a fist
Just the moment of the sun until my clouds come again and bring the rain
one minute the feeling that everything is bright and then darkness steps in
Pretend to be oblivious but something still gnaws
immortal life sin inherited of my deeds
