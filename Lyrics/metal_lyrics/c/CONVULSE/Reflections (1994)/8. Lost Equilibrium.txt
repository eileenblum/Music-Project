Executioners and tortures run after my body
they reach me and wrap me like a baby in a shell
Guide me out, please, lead me free
Darkness and depression rape my true self
piece by piece my memories come into sight
I wander in wasteland and cannot stay anywhere
and I wonder how long it lasts this way I've been
sent, no one sees these contacts which exhaustingly are
gnawing, blames throw me from equilibrium but truth is forbidden
