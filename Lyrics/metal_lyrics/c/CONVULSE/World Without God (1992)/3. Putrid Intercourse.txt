This cult is older than time itself
Generations have changed, but the ritual is the same
Connect your mind to our chorus of souls
Experience the act of the putrid flesh

Search your place in this carnal abuse
Dig the soul and desecrate the grave
When your bloody nails absorb the lid of the coffin
The time of the gratification is finally reached

I eat your eyes and I kiss your eye sockets
I splatter with your ravaged body
Nothing here on this fuckin' earth
Makes me feel so good

Oh my darling let me come
Deep inside of you
Hear my roar when I eat your ears
Feel my lust when I act to your corpse

Putrid intercourse... makes my satisfaction

Search your place in this carnal abuse
Dig the soul and desecrate the grave
When your bloody nails absorb the lid of the coffin
The time of the gratification is finally reached

Dismembered... corpses lie in the yard
Taste of putrid... is in your mouth
The evil world... is so far away
