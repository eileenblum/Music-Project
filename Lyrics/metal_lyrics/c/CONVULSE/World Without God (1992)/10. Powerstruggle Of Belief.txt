In the beginning of the chronology
There were centuries lasting persecutions
The reason of fear, was that Christians are
Messengers of Satan...

In the middle ages the rescuers
Were burned at the stake
Putrid carcasses are only memories
That are left from their bravery

The auto-dafe death was their
Unwritten destiny
Cadaverous smell inside the coffin
Is their eternal companion

Their lord called God gave directions
Concept and fill the earth
It guarantees the good necessities
For invasion of Satan

Who...
Is right, me or God?
Who...
Can I anymore trust?

In the middle ages the rescuers
Were burned at the stake
Putrid carcasses are only memories
That are left from their bravery

The auto-dafe death was their
Unwritten destiny
Cadaverous smell inside the coffin
Is their eternal companion

In the beginning of the chronology
There were centuries lasting persecutions
The reason of fear, was that Christians are
Messengers of Satan...
