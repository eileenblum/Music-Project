Believe in posthumous life or not
He gives me eternal malediction
But the natural forces make me see
That life will be preserved

My disloyalty has been condemned
To never-ending damnation
But I have crossed the line of death
And seen the end of the devout souls

Morbid suffering buries your hope
It's no use to pray 'cause the paradise is lost

Believe in posthumous life or not
He gives me eternal malediction
But the natural forces make me see
That life will be preserved

My disloyalty has been condemned
To never-ending damnation
But I have crossed the line of death
And seen the end of the devout souls

Infernal end, disastrous lies

Your maggot has burnt in the flames of truth
And your soul wander in the eternal darkness
Pray and beseech help from your godly master
But there is no-one to hear your screams

Infernal flames are licking your flesh
Lamentations accompany you to death

Morbid suffering buries your hope
It's no use to pray 'cause paradise is lost
