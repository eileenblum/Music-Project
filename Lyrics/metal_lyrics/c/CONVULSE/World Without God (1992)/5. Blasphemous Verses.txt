Pray and beseech from your holy bible
Perform the ceremonies from birth to death

You have your own rights
Which deny the blasphemy

But what do I have
Atheist who doesn't believe

Knock on the doors and violate domestic peace
Sell the salvation and I spit against your faces
Why do you have to intrude with your fuckin' Jesus books
It's against my views and injures my soul

Your faith is weak and only a deception
The holy bible proves against itself
Your faith is your opinion about religion
But real believer believes always himself

Your forefathers preached
That evilness is Satan

Knock on the doors and violate domestic peace
Sell the salvation and I spit against your faces
Why do you have to intrude with your fuckin' Jesus books
It's against my views and injures my soul

Your faith is weak and only a deception
The holy bible proves against itself
Your faith is your opinion about religion
But real believer believes always himself

Pray and beseech from your holy bible
Perform the ceremonies from birth to death
