Make a bow and reverence
Give praise to lord, never forget his sacredness

Gather together, harp the hymn
Make the confession and pray salvation

Satan in his temple
Buries your paradise
He leads your paths
To endless eternity

Godless is truth!!!
You will it see...

The death is definitive
It peels your flesh
Crumbles you to dust
Darkling beetles eat you at last...

Your bigot is a disease
Like immortality
The only truth you will see
Is the moment that you live

Life has just begun
It never disappears
If the humanity dies now
Comes another way of life

Satan in his temple
Buries your paradise...

Satan in his temple
Buries...
