Smoke rises from the pipes
When the death train slowly arrives
Ashes darkening the sky

At this endpoint death is specified...
Predetermined

Spotlights - wiping the desperate lines
Underdogs - died before the morbid selection
Right side - you'll be enslaved until you die
Left side - you will be... exterminated

Who are the lucky ones?

Those who are already dead
They can't hear the silent screams in the night
How about the ones who survived?
With a blink of hope in their eyes
Their ties of blood are torn apart

More we forget... the more we kill our kind

End of war - comes closer day by day
Third Reich - empire of evil falls apart
Gunshot - into the head, can't kill 'em all
Deathmarch - starving death, hide the truth
