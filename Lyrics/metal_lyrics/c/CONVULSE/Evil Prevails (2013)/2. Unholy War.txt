CanÂ´t bury the evil - the evilness is deep inside of us
YouÂ´ve tried to burn it by the will of God
Heretics in torture chambers
Screaming out the bloody truth
It is the way you deal with your abomination
Religious corporations - Sacrifice yourself
Inborn repression - Imprisoned forever
Baptized with infection - To your puristic denomination
Heresy - The enemy of God, on the way to your unholy war
Marching to unholy war....
Create an explanation
for every single act of nature
And call it the act of a mighty god
Miscreants have done it before
with honor by their blood
You have lost the ancient roots of this earth
Marching to the unholy war...unholy war
Righteous pigs with religious plague
spread the disease in every thinkable way
In God we trust, with tanks we blast
Every act of dissent that comes in our way
Come, come, come with me
Join to the army of the unholy war
Come, come, join with me
Religious pigs want to rule your world
Refuse, resist...You have the vigor inside yourself
Refuse, resist...you have the vigor...
