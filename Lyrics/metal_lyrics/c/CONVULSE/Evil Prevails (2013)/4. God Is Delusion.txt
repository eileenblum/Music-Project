God is made to rule your world
Christ is imagination
Morbid suffer and damnation
Ushers you burn in hell
Minsters made from blood and pain
To praise his impurity

Why won't you seek the truth
And just open your eyes [2x]

God is delusion, religion is his whore
Killing in the name of the God
(Sinners) will be blasted to dead

Conquer the world with God's sword
Kneel down before the pain
We steal your God and culture
It's just human nature!
