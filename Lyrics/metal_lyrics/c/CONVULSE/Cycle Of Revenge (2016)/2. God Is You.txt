[2x]
Darkness rising
Genesis rising
Who among the gods
God is like you

Blessed one the man who reveals the rage
Expect to love all your enemies
What kind of virtues has a man
Who needs rewards

God is you [2x]

We'll hunt us down from the face of earth
Expect to hate all your enemies
With roaring lions and night wolves
We cut off faith

God is you [2x]

Darkness rising
Genesis rising
Who among the gods
God is like you
