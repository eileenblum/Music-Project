Who is your enemy?
You're seeding life
Invisible deathcloud
Calling precious dead one

You're holding in your arms your dead son
Black flag salvation
Your god today

Cycle of vengeance
You're ready to take it all, take it all

You're holding in your arms the next dead son, dead son

You're holding in your arms the next dead son

The next dead son [6x]
