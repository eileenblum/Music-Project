SHIVER NOW, MY INFERIOR
TAKE A BOW TO YOUR SUPERIOR

IâM CLAIMING ANGUISH AND SPREADING FEAR
WHEN I PASS THESE CROWDED STREETS
I FEEL STRONG, YOU MUST BE WEAK
SINCE YOUR GUN IS OBSOLETE

NEVER REJECT IN ANY WAY
FLAKHEADS PLAY â BORN THIS WAY
NEVER REJECT IN ANY WAY
FUCKING FLAKHEAD

I HATE THOSE EMPATHETIC PEOPLE
THEIR LIFE IS JUST A WASTE
WASTE OF TIME, WASTE OF FIGHTS
PREPARE FOR MY FINAL CHASE

NEVER REJECT IN ANY WAY
FLAKHEADS PLAY â BORN THIS WAY
NEVER REJECT IN ANY WAY
FLAKHEADS PLAY â BORN THIS WAY
NEVER REJECT IN ANY WAY
THIS MIGHTY ARTILLERY
FUCKING FLAKHEAD
