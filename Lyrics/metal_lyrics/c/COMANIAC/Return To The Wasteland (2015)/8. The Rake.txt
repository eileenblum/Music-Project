A MAN ONCE SO HOLLOW
BLINDED BY GREED
NO CHANCE TO ARRIVE
IN THE LAND OF THE FREE

LIVING AND DYING IS SO CLOSE
TELL ME WHATâS YOUR CHOICE
HUMILIATION, YOUR EXPECTATION
STRUGGLING, WEEPING TOY

SITTING THERE, DESTINY SQUARE
SELECTIVE GOD IN HUMAN FLESH
RISING HIS HAND, NOW YOU ARE DAMNED
FADE AWAY, HOPE IS DASHED

KILLING WIRE, BETTER INQUIRE
FOR A SOLUTION OF YOUR LIFE
TRANSFORMATION, YOUR SALVATION
IN A MYSTERIOUS ROOM YOU ARRIVE

ROLL CALL UNDER THE MORNING SUN
DENY YOUR WEAKNESS OR HE SAYS YOUâRE DEAD
STAND STILL OR MAKE YOUR WILL
HOW MUCH PRESSURE BEARS YOUR HEAD?

BETRAYER, SINNER
INTRODUCE YOU TO
DEATH IN HELL
YOU HAVE TO ENDURE
BETRAYER, SINNER
INTRODUCE YOU TO

HEâS DEVIL IN DISGUISE
POST OF HONOUR AND WRATH
HE WILL CUT YOU DOWN TO SIZE
AND STIR YOU WITH WATER TO MUD

EXTERMINATOR, INCINERATOR
PUNGENT SMOKE ARISE
COVER UP CRIME AND ROT
SPREADING PLAYED DOWN LIES

BETRAYER, SINNER
INTRODUCE YOU TO
DEATH IN HELL
YOU HAVE TO ENDURE
BETRAYER, SINNER
INTRODUCE YOU TO THE RAKE
