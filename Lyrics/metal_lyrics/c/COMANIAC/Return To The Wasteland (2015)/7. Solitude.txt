PAIN, ALL I FEEL IS PAIN
MY LIFE GOES DOWN THE DRAIN
AND MY DREAMS BECOME IN VAIN

VOID, THIS ETERNAL VOID
INCITES ME TO DESTROY
AND LETS ME STRAY LIKE A TOY

THIS IS WHY MY SOLITUDE
NOURISH MY DESPAIR
MY TERRIFIC ATTITUDE
MINIMIZE MY WILL TO BEWARE
WHERE MY SOLITUDE
TAKES CONTROL OF ME
MY TERRIFIC ATTITUDE
MINIMIZE MY WILL TO LIVE

IâM HIDING MY INSANITY
TO CONTROL SELF-THERAPY
FORTIFY MY BLEEDING LIGHT
BLOW THIS FUCKING DYNAMITE

TRAPPED, TRAPPED IN MY OWN MIND
I FEEL SO UNDEFINDED
AND LEAVE MYSELF BEHIND

THIS IS WHY MY SOLITUDE
NOURISH MY DESPAIR
MY TERRIFIC ATTITUDE
MINIMIZE MY WILL TO BEWARE
WHERE MY SOLITUDE
TAKES CONTROL OF ME
MY TERRIFIC ATTITUDE
MINIMIZE MY WILL TO LIVE

DEATH, DEATH IS DRAWING NEAR
NO ONE HAD TO SHOW ME
THAT ALL HOPE IS GONE FOR ME

AND AS I SLOWLY ROT
I FEEL MY TIME IS UP
MY BLACKLIST I COMPILE
REGRET MY SUICIDE

WHY MY SOLITUDE
NOURISH MY DESPAIR
MY TERRIFIC ATTITUDE
MINIMIZE MY WILL TO BEWARE
WHERE MY SOLITUDE
TAKES CONTROL OF ME
MY TERRIFIC ATTITUDE
MINIMIZE MY WILL TO LIVE

MY BODY IS SHAPED THROUGH HATE
THAT I ONCE LOVED NOW I KNOW
HATE DOESNâT HEAL MY SOUL
TO REVEAL WHAT I BELIEVE

DO YOU BELIEVE?
YOU BETTER BELIEVE

WORDS OF WISDOM
ONCE PASSED MY INTELLIGENT MIND
NOW I KNOW MY STATE OF MIND
FROM DAY TO DAY TURNS INTO A VOID

DO YOU BELIEVE?
YOU BETTER BELIEVE
