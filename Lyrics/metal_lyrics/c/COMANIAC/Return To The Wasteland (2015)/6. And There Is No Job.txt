HATE AND GROWN REJECTION
FOR YEARS IâM TEMPTING FATE
ALONE FOR ALL MY LIFE NOW
MANKIND RETALIATES

WE ARE CONCEIVING THE ROUTINE

THERE IS NO JOB
ETERNALLY WE ROT

FEAR AND GROWN REJECTION
MY PASSION IS A FAKE
I DONâT HEAR, I DONâT BOW
I LEARN FROM MY MISTAKES

WE ARE CONCEIVING THE ROUTINE

THERE IS NO JOB
ETERNALLY WE ROT

PURSUE THE POLICY
WHICH REJECT MY ID
SO I CAN GO ASTRAY
I DONâT GET WHAT YOU SAY

PURSUE THE POLICY
WHICH REJECT MY ID
SO I CAN GO ASTRAY
I DONâT CARE WHAT YOU SAY

IâM WEIGHED DOWN IN SORROW
YET MY MIND DID NOT REVEAL ANY FAULTS
ILLUSIONS OF HOPE
THE WEAKENED FLESH IS WHAT I CONCEAL

LOVE AND GROWN REJECTION
IâM BEGGING ON MY KNEES
THEREâS NO HOPE, IâM FIRED
STILL MY WORKâS FOR FREE

WE ARE CONCEIVING THE ROUTINE

THERE IS NO JOB
ETERNALLY WE ROT
