I have seen the land turn grey in disease
How the world that I made turned to war
For ages have passed
Since I first came to this land, as their God

I left my mark on them
Created a system of pure sin
The perfect fuel for conflict
Wars are waged for religion

Now! - Take my hand and follow, I am the savior for those with sorrow
Blindly believe in what I proclaim, spread my word and bow to my name
Bring fear to those who deny, for my existence is not a lie
And burn those who disagree, I am the God of love and peace

I've made them my puppets, for my own desires
To see them struggle through life, in the hope of a second one
