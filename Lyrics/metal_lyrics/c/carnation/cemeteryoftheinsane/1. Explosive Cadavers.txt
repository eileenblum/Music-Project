Scalpel incisions through your body parts
Removing your organs, no further need
Injecting the body with chemicals
Surgical perfection, a human bomb

Lifeless corpses walking through the streets
Their blood starts to boil and their flesh rips apart
Explosive cadavers, activated

Burning flesh is flying around, death spreading like madness
New form of brutality, complete fucking insanity
The stench has become unbearable, the decease rate is incredible
True hellish new phobia, a cannibalistic utopia

Massive heaps of human remains
A blitzkrieg of the undead has begun
The goal is to exterminate
Everything under the Sun
