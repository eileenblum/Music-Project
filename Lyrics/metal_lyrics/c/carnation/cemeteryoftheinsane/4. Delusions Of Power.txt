Left for dead, bullet in the head, ambushed by drugged up men
Guerrilla war, fighting for, a tyrant's wish of greed and gold

The killing spree, lead by tyranny, in this realm of death, is a living hell
The foulest deeds, rape and butchery, performed by evil men, in this jungle cell

Madness! - This world has gone insane
Dismember! - The bodies of fellow tribesmen
The need for gold and luxury, are turning this land to slavery
Decapitate! - The head of lady liberty

Now you will bow to me, you were born to serve me
You are truly inferior, my riches make me superior

Yes I! - I am the song of God
Yes I! - The one to recreate Zion

Face down in the river as the fire takes its form
Chaos spreads in this fiery mass, what was once our home
My soul leaves my body as I think of my daughter
My people sent to the slaughter while I sink into the water
