The sickening stretch, reach for the sky 
Devlish squire, onward, bleeding dry 
Heresy in the noble manor 
Demolish, take down and shatter 
Ride, ride, ride, ride with the wicked 
Heresy in the noble manor 
Demolish, take down and shatter 
The sickening stretch, reach for the sky 
Devlish squire, onward, bleeding dry 
Heresy in the noble manor 
Demolish, take down and shatter 
Ride, ride, ride, ride with the wicked 
Heresy in the noble manor 
Demolish, take down and shatter 
Fear the approaching peril 
Ready, lock, stock and barrel 
Twisted 
Ride with the wicked 
And uplifted 
Ride with the wicked
