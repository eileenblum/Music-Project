It is always in the way 
Stinking up another day 
It affects my fuckinâ mood 
When gone, that would be good 
Screaming out loud 
Loathe 
Screaming out loud 
Loathe 
It is always in the way 
Stinking up another day 
It affects my fuckinâ mood 
When gone, that would be good 
Screaming out loud 
Loathe 
Screaming out loud 
Loathe 
The itch one canât scratch 
The thing you canât catch 
It affects my fuckinâ mood 
When gone, that would be good 
It is always in the way 
Stinking up another day 
It affects my fuckinâ mood 
When gone, that would be good 
Screaming out loud 
Loathe 
Screaming out loud 
Loathe
