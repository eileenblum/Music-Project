Wave your flags, ready to collide 
True intentions are embezzled 
The ones behind the curtains prosper 
Clear individual thinking died 
History repeating 
The blackest of hearts, still pulling our strings 
Killing in the name of, the afterlife will give us swings 
72 virgins, a promise made 
Will set us on fire, seems like a fair trade 
Still we havenât learned 
The human idiot 
Following them blindly 
The human idiot 
Human idiot 
Human idiot 
Human idiot 
Human (idiot) 
Fairytales make us kill 
The human idiot 
On and on weâll get burned 
The human idiot 
I PITY US ALL! 
Wave your flags, ready to collide 
True intentions are embezzled 
The ones behind the curtain prosper 
Clear individual thinking died
