Rinse the mouth to spit out the lies 
A prayer for the dying, future six feet under 
All bridges were burned before you could cross 
A hook in the mouth and a shovel to the throat 
Heretic, Heretic 
Neglecting the spirits, for years to come 
Stuck, youâre on the left hand path 
Resident of a moribund kingdom 
Intentions to make amends, went down the drain 
Heretic, Heretic 
Stampede of the blackened flock 
Youâre pushing the lost souls into the void 
No exit, in this ignominious game 
A cesspool of shit, inhabited by nomads 
Heretic, Heretic, Heretic, Heretic 
Heretic 
Draw a parallel between the healthy and sick 
Herectic 
The inevitable ending will go down as epic
