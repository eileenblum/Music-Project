Toss a nuclear bomb on âem 
And blow âem all to kingdom come 
A place where they deserve to go after death 
Toss a nuclear bomb on âem 
And blow âem all to kingdom come 
A place where they deserve to go after death 
No time, for the weak at heart 
And face, reality 
Show some real grit, and leadership 
Before they spread like cancer 
And infest our entire globe 
Toss a nuclear bomb on âem 
And blow âem all to kingdom come 
A place where they deserve to go after death 
Nuke them all 
Nuke them all 
All!
