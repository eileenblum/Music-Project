O, yes we are all related 
Copying behaviour, from bonobo monkeys 
The heat is hot 
The air breathes, a strong desire 
Such a strong desire 
Dual highlights on and on 
Tribbing Mania 
The feeling, so strong 
2 Tribas engage, scissoring legs 
Ground their reproductive, 
Organs together 
Dual highlights on and on 
Tribbing Mania 
The feeling, so strong 
Tribadism, a form of art 
Tribbing Mania 
Never tear them apart 
Clean and shaved 
Humping motions 
Moaning and spasming 
Until theyâre sore 
Clean and shaved 
Humping motions 
Moaning and spasming 
Until theyâre sore 
Tribadism, a form of art 
Tribbing Mania 
Never tear them apart 
Tribbing Mania
