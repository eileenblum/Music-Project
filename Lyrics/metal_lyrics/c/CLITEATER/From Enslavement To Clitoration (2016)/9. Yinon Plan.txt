Through the balkanization of surrounding Arab States 
Into smaller and weaker states 
Weaker states 
Calls, calls, calls, calls 
Calls for a divided Lebanon, Egypt, Syria 
Partitioning of Iran, Turkey, Somalia and Pakistan 
So divide and conquer 
The Zionist strategic thinking 
Enslave them through fragmenting 
All Arab states into smaller units 
Calls, calls, calls ,calls 
Calls for dissolution in North Africa 
Spilling over into Sudan and Libya
