Sharpen snake images, unconditional fate
Inconspicuous, make the move
World is full of abundant people
Kill the ego, execute death sentence

Execute death sentence

Proud the blind uphold their fictive failures
Purify the surface with swift accuracy
Revoke laws of prehistoric times
Take and kill by own will
Characterless figures larded with insipid jokes
Time to cleanse the soil
Disposal of adundance
Proud the blind uphold their fictive failures
Purify the surface with swift accuracy

Erase now, our time is short
Understand, the obvious ways of life
Aim and unfold the act of grim reaper
Disposal of abundance
Disposal of abundance

Leave no rotten soul behind
Disposal of abundance
Kill 'em all prepare
For the final massacre
For the final massacre
Prepare
