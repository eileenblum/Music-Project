Pissing out the seasons
Dragging on, endlessly
Pissing out the seasons
No end to grim reality

Pain is pouring down on and on
Imbalance on baily bases
Clouded wasted days illustrate
The illusion

Imagenery utopic deadline controls
Every move to be made
Indignant towards gloomy fate
Kill the feast of failure

Daylights go and night appear
Awareness of a singular phenomenon appears
Lack of common sense
Pissing out the seasons endlessly
Lack of common sense
Pissing out the seasons endlessly
Endless

Pissing out the seasons
Dragging on, endlessly
Pissing out the seasons
No end to grim reality
