Take the fuckin' pain
Pain

Forlorn my pleasures

Hiding behind walls of steel
Grin and bear my burden
Is out of fucking reach

Take the pain, Take the pain
See my bloodred sunken eyes
Take the pain,
The only way to make it die

Take the fuckin' pain
Pain

Paving through claustrophobic spasms
Floating on streams of time
Stumble, falter, no absolution
Take my pain caught in a rhyme
