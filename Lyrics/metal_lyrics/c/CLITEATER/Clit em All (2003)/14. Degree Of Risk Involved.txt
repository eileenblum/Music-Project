If we stay inarticulate
The techniques of change
Will be applied
A little at a time

Degree of risk involved
Degree of risk involved

But if we see it as a whole
From the start
Our resistance will prove stronger
And techniques will fall under
Undescriminating ban
As result of this might be the

Loss of future generations of things
They would have found of great value
Gain will seem to
Outweight rather vague feelings
Of resistance

Degree of risk involved
Degree of risk involved

In order to focus on our values more sharpy
It seems worth adopting a deliberate
Casualness towards present views
In order to engage in a
Thought experiment

If we stay inarticulate
The techniques of change
Will be applied
A little at a time

Degree of risk involved
Degree of risk involved
