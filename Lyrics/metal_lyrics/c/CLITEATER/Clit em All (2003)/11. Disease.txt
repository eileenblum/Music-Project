Swarming mass of ignorant vermin
Floating along the stream, confessing
Praying
Dumb in their own beliefs

Crucifixion of individuality
Superficial train of thought

Believing there's got to be more to
Life than this
Arrogant, place yourself above all life

Everything ends, so will existence

Religion, reason of worldwide wars
There's no god, no one will be saved
Religion, one always has to cling to
There's no Allah, stop your cult rituals
Religion, Mass murder generator
There's no Buddha, no supreme higher being
Religion, excessive blunt fellatio
There's no Satan, dark childish opposition
THERE'S NOTHING

No Christ, no Mohammed, no after
Accept the finite time in your paradox
Appreciate life given by your bloodline
There's nothing, everything ends, nothing
Nothing, Nothing, Ending, Ending
Ending, everything ends
SO WILL YOU
