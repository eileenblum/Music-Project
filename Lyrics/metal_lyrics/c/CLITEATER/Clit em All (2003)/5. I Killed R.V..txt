Dull, stupid, ignorant face
Smashing it into pieces, a brick never fails
Now I never have to see your grin again

My boots are made for stompin'
And that's just what they do
This day my boots are gonna fucking crush you

Crushing your genitals, beautiful
Snapping sounds
Free sterilization,
Accept my generosity
Incessant torture, you fucking asshole
Is what I got in store
Now you die

Hate, Hate, Hate

I killed R.L.
Wish I could do it over again
I killed R.L.
Trust me, I will piss on your grave

Hate, Hate

Tremendous pain is not enough
This is my indemnity for your deeds
To forgive is of no use in this case
I'll leave you here to rot and die
You'll never find your peace
You'll never find your peace
You'll never find your fuckin' peace
