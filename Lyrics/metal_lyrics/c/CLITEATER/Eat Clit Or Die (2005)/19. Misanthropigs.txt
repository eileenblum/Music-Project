It's never enough
And never will be
All this useless gate, sickens me

Fuckin' misanthropigs putting down every race
Never questioning themselves
Only other people way of life

Misantropigs resent every race
Misantropigs hate every colour
Misantropigs want them all to die
It's time Misantropigs
Ask themselves why?

It's no good, to hate them all
It's a battle, they can't win
It's no good, always being prejudiced
It's time misantropigs
Respect all the earths kind
