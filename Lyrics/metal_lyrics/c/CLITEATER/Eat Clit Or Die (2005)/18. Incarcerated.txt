[Pre Chorus]
Now put away for life
Locked up like a dog
Used and abused
Isolation cuts like sharp knives

[Chorus]
Incarcerated
Couldn't live up to society's standards
Incarcerated
Forever farewell to life as you knew it

[Repeat pre chorus]
[Repeat chorus]

Undescribable torture
Reigns inside these walls of hell
Shining convicts eyes
Now dim forever
Shining convicts eyes
Now dim forever

[Repeat pre chorus]
[Repeat chorus]
