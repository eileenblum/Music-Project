Meet my beating
Meet my beating

Prejudiced bastards ought to know
They are walking on shallow ground
Meet my beating
Meet my beating

[Chorus]
Indigestible rage
Relentless senseless beating
Handicap you for life
Smashing and bashing your skull, bones and genitals
On and on and on and on and on

Suspend animation
I won't fall for that
Keep on punching out the ignorance
Bleed for me twat

Humans oh so fragile
Not worth the air they breathe
Gradually losing conscience
Meet my beating
Meet my beating

[Repeat chorus]
