No ground for pity
Did this to myself

I am in hell

O sweet torment embrace me
I am in hell
This is it, this is all
I am in hell
Suffer equals pleasure
I am in hell
Brings a feeling one can't measury

Equilibrum

[Chorus x2]
Not to be reached
I am in hell
This is where I want to be
I am in hell

Chosen path, to be walked till the end
If you don't follow, leave me alone
Misery tastes sweet
