[Chorus]
No remorse
No regrets
No feeling
Built to kill

Ostrcize consciousness to another dimension
Bloodred let the path be one should lead

Write-off blunt weakness
Smiling at the caused mayhem
Dog eat dog

[Repeat chorus]

Slain shall be the ones who defy
Slaughter the ones who deny
The philosophy of total fuckin' destruction of man
And it's pathetic attempts to everrule all

[Repeat chorus]

Misanthrope, I, built to kill
Misanthrope, you, built to kill
Misanthrope, them, built to kill
Misanthrope, us, built to kill
