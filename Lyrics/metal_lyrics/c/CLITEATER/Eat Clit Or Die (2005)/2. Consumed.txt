Inumerable offers presented by the web
Made two twisted minds choose to take
Their final step
Two psychos, plotting and planning
To shock the world beyond belief

[Chorus]
To be, cooked and boiled
To be, cut and chopped
To be, hacked and slain
To be eaten in sane

Free cannibalism in this free world
It's my body, it's my right

[Repeat chorus x2]

I want to be eaten Eat all my limbs
But don't let me die before
I want to see you consumming me

Grant me my final sick twisted orgasm
I want to scream and bleed
Let me accompany you with eating my phallus
My own dick in my mouth would be a great
Last taste, before I reach my eternal chasm

[Repeat chorus X2]

I want to bleed, and be, CONSUMED
