Father, with cruel intentions
Doesn't want the newborn
To come into this world

So he takes precautions
That can not bear the light of day

[Chorus]
Crash test foetus
Stomp and kick it around
Crash test foetus
Hits the lights
see how far you can go

Mother sliced open
From neck to cunt
Decimated family
They've become
Last screaming sounds
fill the room

Little one with a short lifespan
Meets it's moker to soon
