It's out of reach, a needle in the hay 
And like a leach, it's always here to stay
So make the speech, no one dares to say
But if you preach, the world is in your way, the world is in your way

Still you stare and pray at suns, they'll burn your eyes, red
Picking, pulsing, you're preaching
It's hell to pay, now, now
You're pissing off the world now, you're pissing off the world now

And if I lead, no one's in my way
And I won't bleed for an innocent charade
So take your needs and throw them all away
Cause if you bleed, the world is in your way, the world is in your way

Still you stare and pray at suns, they'll burn your eyes, red
Picking, pulsing, you're preaching
It's hell to pay, now, now
You're pissing off the world now, you're pissing off the world now

Now, now you're pissing off the world now
You're pissing off the world now

The world is in your way
The world is in your way
The world is in your way
The world is in your way
(It's hell to pay, now)
