In his heart he's so serene
Will it show, what's it mean?
In real life he's still in bed
Unaware of the scene

Hey, open up your eyes and awake

Someone then gave up the ghost
Was it you, was it me?
I'll just lay here on the floor
In a daze, as I dream

Hey, open up your eyes and awake

This is where he lost control
So it looks like, so it seems
Now he's off and gone to sleep
Say goodbye to his dreams

You're screaming in your sleep again
