Taking our names, freeze the appraise
We won't die this way
Dig through the dirt
We'll bury your words in the earth

We saw through the flaws, gutted them out
Placing us in tune
We're sick of this shit
So swallow your spit
Go fuck yourselves

Chew them up
Spit them out
Feed them to the wolves

You pulled the trigger in
We hurried up to wave
Oh, oh, trepanning us all

Taking our names, freeze the appraise
We won't die this way
Dig through the dirt
We'll bury your words in the earth

We saw through the flaws
Gutted them out
Placing us in tune
We're sick of this shit
So swallow your spit
Go fuck yourselves

Chew them up
Spit them out
Feed them to the wolves

You pulled the trigger in
We hurried up to wave
Oh, oh, trepanning us all

We're going over the cliff together
This time I'll hold my breath

To the edge of the pit
Till the blood is shed

I will be watching you plunge
to your death
