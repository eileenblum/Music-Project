Knocked me on my head, capturing my child
Then you let me run off into the wild
I thought it was a birthmark, and it looked kinda nice
I didn't know it was your tracking device

If I'm still awake, then shake me back to sleep
It's just a nervous tick, well you won't hear a peep
And so I saw a memory crawling on my brain
I couldn't think it off, so I dreamed it never came

You're made of, you're made of
You're made of something, something undefined
You're made of, you're made of
You're made of something, something I can't find

I know all eyes are on me now
I know all eyes are on me now
So let's make it a show
Let's make it a a show

And so I saw a memory crawling on my brain
I couldn't think it off, so I dreamed it never came

You're made of, you're made of
You're made of something, something undefined
You're made of, you're made of
You're made of something, something I can't find

You're made of, yeah, you're made of
You're made of something, something I can't find
