Tension in the ranks is what I feel
Another 'please' and 'thanks' for you, my dear
So nice to meet you
I'm so sad to see you go

Tension in the ranks is what I see
Trickle through the banks into the sea water
And oh well, it was too bad to see you down

Tension in the ranks is where it ends
Captured by the ones who killed my friends
If you should leave them to release me
Well, you're ...
