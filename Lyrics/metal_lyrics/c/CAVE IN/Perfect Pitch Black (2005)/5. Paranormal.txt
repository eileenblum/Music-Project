Moonlight comes through the shades now 
Moonlight comes through the shades now
Cuts on in through the darkness
I can't say that I like this
Ghosts are free to parade now 
Ghosts are free to parade now 
Only making themselves known to me when I'm all alone

is he as slowly
Lost most of pain
Take all those faces with me

Not since a liar
Paranoid minds
What I only need is sleep

I'll pretend to be dead now
I'll pretend to be dead now 
To myself I'm repeating
"Seeing isn't believing"
Ghosts are free to parade now 
Ghosts are free to parade now 
Only making themselves known to me when I'm all alone

These apparitions
Myriad dreams
Chill in my spine, so cold

Death reeks of ...
Dwelling in sweat
You can't kill something that's already dead
