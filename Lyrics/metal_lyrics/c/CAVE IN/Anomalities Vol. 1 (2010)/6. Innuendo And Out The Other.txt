Write a letter to yourself about yourself:
Boring us with every detail
Someday I'd like to land
- as bitter as I am -
Nothing affects me anymore

There's something when all the efforts
You have made are hiding in your room,
While everyone else,
Continues to stand
Exactly
Where I most belong

Innuendo
And out the other

We cast our lines in to an ocean
Of future cluttering its waters
Calling in more than we can swallow

There's something when all the efforts
You have made are hiding in your room,
While everyone else,
Continues to stand
Exactly
Where I most belong

Innuendo
And out the other
