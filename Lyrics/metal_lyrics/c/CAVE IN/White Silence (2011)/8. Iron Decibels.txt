When it's over we meet downstream
Always honor the code
Wolf assassin the complete
Piled stones shape the road
Life of silence and grave battlefields
Wield unbreakable stroke
Famous for hired beheadings
Resorted death long ago
It shatters the bones
Decibels of iron ton
Meditate to keep the mind clean
Skin blood-soaked to the bone
Whistling wounds can mean nothing
Taught the ancients of old
Laugh with a demon at a meeting
Cashed in all of my ghosts
Don't search for any meaning
Forward into the gold
It shatters the bones
Decibels of iron tone
Heart engraved
Parting word
Spoken, saved
Bound, enslaved
Broken path
Blood has paved
