Scorched by light
Soft laser eyes
hang so high they blur the crystal view
Pirouettes
Spin effortless
Bore a hole in the core of you
Dead rise
Dead rise like
Dead rise like ascending angels
Seamless waves
Barbaric rips
Answer you when you call to it
Heavy strides
And lengthy chords
Ties you downa nd fills the hollow voids
Now we fade
Into the blue again
Still invisible
Mere mortals
