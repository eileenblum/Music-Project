Bring dead skull
Back to life again
Tissue forms
Around the wounded souls
Healing signs
of neon spines draw the lines
My friends
Revival of
Unique bone structure
Defeated frames
Feeling life's embrace
many falls
Harmonic walls
And echo halls
My friends
Reanimation
Of old/new skin
With growing vile
Smile at the world
I'm in
