A lack of oxygen under their skullcaps
Thin is the air they breathe
Summit fever grips all of their climbing souls
Hypoxic delusions upon the descent
Crowns of thunderhead clouds
Summit fever, cause for cut-off time ignored
To understand means trembling
Heart rate has learned
Blood turns to sludge, capillaries die
Hemorrhaging behind frozen eyelid walls
