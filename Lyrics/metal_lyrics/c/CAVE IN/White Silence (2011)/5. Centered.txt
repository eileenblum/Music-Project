Sitting on sound waves demoted to mute
Born into flames like a phoenix
What did the third eye really have in mind?
Tree-shaped temples shred horizons
Cipher your way to the truth
(Center the light inside your bone)
Seek out the god that lurks in you
Contaminated tool
Taken too soon
blinded by crosses with hands crucified
No longer pledging allegiance
Get in the last word sleepwalking confused
Lost in a search for some purpose
Tectonics collide, a ceasing gear grind
Scribed in light inside my skull
Cipher your way to the truth
(Center the light inside your bone)
Seek out the god that lurks in you
Contaminated tool
Taken too soon
Blinded by crosses with hands crucified
No longer pledging allegiance
Cipher your way
Seek out a god
(Cipher your way to the truth. seek out the god that lurks in you)
