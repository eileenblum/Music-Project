Feel shattered glass on a wind
Rob all our eyes of their sight
Cold sonic rush fills the void
Changes the modes of our vice
Sing my loves
Sing sorrows
Sing my enemies
we will all sing together
Rob our eyes of sight
Change the modes of vice
Sing my loves
Sing my enemies
Sing my sorrows
We sill all sing
Sing together
