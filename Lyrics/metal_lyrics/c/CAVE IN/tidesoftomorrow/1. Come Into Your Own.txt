Burning daylight
Speeds up
Midnight
I love
A blessing in disguise
Saw you Crying
Wasn't sure if
You were
Just wringing out your eyes

A spell is cast upon your mode
Listen you will find
A necklace made from beads of sweat
Dripping from your mind
Round and round just like the heads
rolling past your feet
with everything in constant swing
From left to right
from may to might

Come into your own
no, you're not alone

Everything is
out of 
tune when
she's in
perfect harmony
introduce me
to manogamy
shared spring
fever is a bore

A spell is cast upon your mode
Listen you will find
A necklace made from beads of sweat
Dripping from your mind
Round and round just like the heads
rolling past your feet
with everything in constant swing
From left to right
from may to might

Come into your own
Come into your own
and know you're not alone
