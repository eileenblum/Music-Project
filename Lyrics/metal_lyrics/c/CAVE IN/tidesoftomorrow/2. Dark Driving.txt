I know you came in the room
Because everything is out of tune

Dressed in a red devil's suit
You're in some manic pursuit

To try and capture me fast
You want to think of me as

Some kind of killer at large
But I'm only a mirage

The reality check is in the mail [X2]

I could have sworn that I paid you off
I could have sworn that we made amends all squared away
But all I see are knives screaming out of your mouth

I could have sworn that I paid you off
I could have sworn that we made amends all squared away, all squared away

I know you came in the room
Because everything is out of tune

Dressed in a red devil's suit
You're in some manic pursuit

To try and capture me fast
You want to think of me as

Some kind of killer at large
But I'm only a mirage

The reality check is in the mail [X2]

I could have sworn that I paid you off
I could have sworn that we made amends all squared away
But all I see are knives screaming out of your mouth

I could have sworn that we made amends 
But all I see are knives screaming out of your mouth
