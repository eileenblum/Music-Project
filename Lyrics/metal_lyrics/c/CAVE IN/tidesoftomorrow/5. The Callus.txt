I wasn't around when you were talking
But I felt your teeth hit the back of my head
I'll go outside the first day of winter
I'll watch the snow change back over to rain

I've got a blister all the way down
I've got a blister from that sound
And that voice, snow on my shoes
I've got a blister all the way down
I've got a blister from that sound
From that sound

And I tried to shake off all the cold in my hands
I tried to make it out for the rest of my plans
There's a tiny gun pointing at my head
If it doesn't fire
Push it through

Do you need to know now?
Do you need to know now?
Do you need to know now?
Well, I got to know

I've got a blister all the way down
This is the callus this is the callus
I knew my fingers were harder somehow
This is the callus, this is the callus
