Sleepy Sunday morning, afternoons in the sun
Monday is waiting, waiting it's turn
Daylight has wilted, and even though our sky has cleared
Time won't hesitate to burn away

Sleepy Sunday morning on a island far away
Nights spending gazing up at the stars
Tides of tomorrow, will they bring or wash away
Our loved-filled dreams of paradise?

All the world around us is ocean blue
All the world around us
So tell me, dear, oh is it true
The more that you know, the less you believe in?
Tides of tomorrow, how they ebb and they flow!

What a summer day, full of summer ways
It rains so warm in here, I can't believe
Counting constellations in the tropical skies
Chimes likes thousands of wet, teary eyes

Summer comes and goes, and who could ever know
If this, indeed, is our last one together!
Tides of tomorrow, will they bring or wash away
Our love-filled dreams of paradise?

All the world around us is ocean blue
All the world around us
So tell me, dear, oh is it true
The less that you know, the more you believe in?
Tides of tomorrow, how they ebb and they flow!

Tides of tomorrow, tides of tomorrow

Tides of tomorrow, tides of tomorrow
Tides of tomorrow, how they ebb and how they flow!

Tides of tomorrow, tides of tomorrow
Tides of tomorrow, how they ebb and how they flow!

Tides of tomorrow, how they ebb and how they flow!
