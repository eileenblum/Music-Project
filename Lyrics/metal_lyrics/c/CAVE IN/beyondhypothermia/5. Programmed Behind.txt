I think with my eyes cemented
to a flickering screen.
A thirty second segment, fragmented.
Programmed behind the masks...
And what do I absorb?
A question never asked.
And I will never be in control
of this constant intake
of visual attacks.
I cannot take time to process
while these images still bombard me.
Say goodbye to the floor beneath me,
there's no way your rope
could reach me.

Bite the hand that needs you,
smash the screen that feeds you.
Biting the hand, smashing the screen.
And finally I slipped out
Of the sattelite's reach,
To come a long way from
A corrupt program leech.
I think with my eyes opened and closed
At the same time.
