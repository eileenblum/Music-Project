Forbearing truth, we wear denial
Your compassion will be put on trial.
And when stripped of all innocence,
Will your actions still commence?
You won't be losing your awareness
Anytime soon.
Is common sense left in the closet?
A caring mind taking action right away.
Saying "What will influence you is where you stand".

The truth that I have possessed says
"How we stand is what I test,"
Though you feel entitled to
Your ignorant opinions.
Evaluate your concerns:
Stale assumptions that fill an otherwise vacant mind.

And only lies shall open your eyes.
But when will the world awaken,
Before it's taken?
Too late for too much.
