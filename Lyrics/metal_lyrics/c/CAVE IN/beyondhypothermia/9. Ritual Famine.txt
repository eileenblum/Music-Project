Feed.
Kill the needing urge that hangs inside.
Wilted life, a wound in need of nursing.
Self induced hunger.
Forced it down to suppress the gnaw.
Cursed to outlive words
With all their rusting rooted fallacies.
Benign.
Locked in, powerless in resisting
I pray to outlive.
Hollow I swallow.
Bloodless, lifeless, selfless again.
Never fucking again.
Deprived.
Denied.
Destroy.
