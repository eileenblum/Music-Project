To forgive and forget, I live and regret.
Grief speaks its own language;
It forces me to act strong,
But every time I stand up
I'm afraid I'll bump my head.
Eyesight in time.
Things seemed easy,
Only I was building a fence.
And you see in me what I once
Took action against.
Sever my eyes away from
This twenty inch screen.
I've finally got what is tangible.
The more I learn about myself,
The more I see in me to hate.
Your misconception of perception
detains all reasoning.
You're this image of my fears,
Armed with words that shatter my ears.
I am only I but that won't do.
Not for you, you're only you.
Can you see what I've got?
The world is not a tube,
And a brain playing games
With television knobs
Is a steady leak for attention span.
Restore it sooner: unplug the unit.
