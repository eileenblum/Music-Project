Have you strayed from the movement?
You're lost in a lie.
Contradiction is my worst fear,
I cannot see how you can block
The truth from your fucking ears.
Has it turned from a lifestyle
To a fucking trend?

You're too busy feeding your face
To realized what you've caused:
Pain and suffering
To a being as helpless as a baby.
You'll never see it my way
Until you stop giving in to your greed.

Deaf to the truth, blind to reality.
For once, can you take the attention away
From your hunger,
Look outside yourself
And see just what you created?
Pain, and suffering to a being
As helpless as a baby.
