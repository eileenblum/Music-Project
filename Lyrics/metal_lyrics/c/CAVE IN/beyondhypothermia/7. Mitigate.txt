And how will denial mitigate importance
to successful health?
These eyes call it pain,
watching millions of people playing dead
to a crook infested industry.
Body spender, legal tender.
And it's a choice to a certain degree,
to the point where I can still breathe.
No mutually exclusive relations for me.
And if you gave attention to
the one and only body that you'll ever have,
how would denial mitigate?
