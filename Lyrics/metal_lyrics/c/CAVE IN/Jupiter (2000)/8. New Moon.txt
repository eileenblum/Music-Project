So I saw the angel girl hang her wings by the door.
tired from the windy chill, guilt had forced her to land.
'I no longer know,' she said.
'the way to fly myself home.'
may it all become familiar to us all
new moon.

she's so vain, she's dreaming of funerals to come.
it's the part of the movie where you can't help
but close your eyes.
a social butterfly retreats back to its cocoon.
surely this will be familiar to us all.
new moon.
hold my gaze.
new moon.
