Mourning in the confines of your room by yourself.
Reminded by the bulk of every memoir by yourself.
Clearing out your storage spaces all by yourself.
Remembering the way it always was by yourself.

If I could pull my thoughts together
I could then shake the thought
You might be still breathing
Others I haven't seen in months or years
Are here under a dimming light of circumstance

Mourning in the confines of your room by yourself.
Reminded by the bulk of every memoir by yourself.
Clearing out your strange spaces all by yourself.
Remembering the way it always was by yourself.

Do you feel it's true that you're always doomed
With this migraine, my gain will fade

You're against the grain in the pain of a world
You don't speak a sound or walk around in anymore
Full of silent expectations
No one could have known . . .
So how would I?

Trying to find something
Looking for a whole lot of nothing
And then you found me at your door.
Full of silent expectations
No one could have known . . .
So how would I?

No two reasons have good reasons
Why'd you have to die
Relieve a hundred alibis
Cause no one is surprised

Trying to find a whole lot of nothing
And then you found me.
