hey candy cane brain
pouring like the rain
sweeter than any other pain
I'd even dare name
I kinda sorta need a wind to blow me out
and to control the flame
I kinda sorta need a fuse
to light my brain candle- oh yeah
hey candy cane brain
sugared like the stain, sugared like the stain
keeping her a tasty
flavored flowing vein
don't try
I will do it all for you
never ask me
'how's your brain?'
when I'm down
dying here of thirst
for one dose
of my own
medicine, hey...heeey...ey
I couldn't feel it
how could this be your flame?
