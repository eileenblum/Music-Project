And we continue to chase the sun 
Only to burn up both our hands 
And we will find out what's to know... 
In warning winds, the truth will blow 

You might find I'm feeling all the guilt 
Dragging out the hours, all deceived 
Both are harmless and haunting to me 
Now remember your heroes 
As a cancel out zero 
Like you were young again 

A man you haven't seen in years 
Resurrecting your deepest fears 
Returns a favor unto himself... 
By turning us the other cheek

You're just a coat of red in Hell
Tired of turning us away

You might find I'm feeling all the guilt
And now remember your heroes 
As a cancel out zero
You were never the one to break away

Dragging out the hours, all deceived
And now remember your heroes 
As a cancel out zero
You were never the one to break free

You turn your eyes to gray
You turn your eyes away
You

You're another coat of red in Hell
Kill this child to make sure I've raised him well

On a concrete road to recovery 
'Cause I'm knocking over every cone 
In front of me
