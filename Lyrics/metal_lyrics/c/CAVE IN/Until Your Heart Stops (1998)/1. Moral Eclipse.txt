Yellow turns this courage badge
Into a valentinal trash.
These are the crushes meant to crush you.
The contact was dry,
But exasperating like a teething smile.
Pulse by pulse,
I honor wet weather to myself into her hands,
And for an angel even she knew it well
When my drool dropped past her lips.
A dead man floating
Is one in a forgetful moment.
She saw it haunted in my eyes
When finally they opened,
Coughing up blood like throat.
No, lover let go of my neck.
We knew together that every crack in the wall
Is a step towards release of the lascivious waters
I no longer wade through.
