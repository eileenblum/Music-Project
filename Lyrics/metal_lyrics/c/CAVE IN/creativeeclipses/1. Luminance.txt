Magnetic tapes are old bloodstreams
For this recording machine.
We're serving all the jaded hearts
Of those without a place to start.
And washing them of all mistake;
Ill confidence could never fake
The notes and bolts that ring this song:
Expired tales of love gone wrong.

Why do I stay the same?
Why do I hear your name
On every street, on every path?
Luminance.

Why do I hear your name?
Why do I feel the same
In every dream I ever have?
Luminance.

Standing in a freezing place beyond,
Until your heart has stopped its chime.
Branded with an order number,
And washing them of all mistake.
