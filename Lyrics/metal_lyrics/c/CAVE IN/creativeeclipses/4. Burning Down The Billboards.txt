We are here, we were there,
We are nearing people everywhere we go.
People catching in their hands
The ashes of the Marlboro man.

Burn them down, burn them down
With our canteens pouring gasoline;
It's never what they're saying
But why oh why they say it.
Burning down the billboards
To the ground and not a sound
Will touch the ears,
For the sights to be gained
Will everlast us through the years.

Five o'clock rush hour traffic
Gazing upward at our magic.
Calvin Klein went down in flames,
Authorities aren't asking for the names.
Miller Lite was burning bright,
Illuminating our fearless night
And victory was once again
Ours until the very end.

Burn them down, burn them down
With our canteens pouring gasoline;
It's never what they're saying
But why oh why they say it.
Burning down the billboards
To the ground and not a sound
Will touch the ears,
For the sights to be gained
will everlast us through the years.

Burning down the billboards
To the ground and not a sound
Will touch the ears,
For the sights to be gained
Will everlast us through the years.
