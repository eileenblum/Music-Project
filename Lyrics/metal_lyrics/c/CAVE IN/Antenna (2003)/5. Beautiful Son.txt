Nothing in his mind, the rent there is much too high
It doesn't make him want to occupy this life
Hiding all the things he prays the world won't find
Still it makes him run away so paranoid

Beautiful son, without your guns, you'd be someone
Beautiful son, without your guns, you'd be someone

Nothing in his mind but childhood memories
It doesn't make him want to live those years again
Hair is finally growing back over his wounds
Still it makes him want to hurt the ones he loves

Beautiful son, without your guns, you'd be someone
Beautiful son, without your guns, you'd be someone

So the future never came while past is just the same
Though we both know you'll go far when you discover who you are, who you are

Still on a mountain peak of anger, well...
All that he can do is yell
To all of us down far, far below 
But we all know

Beautiful son, without your guns, you'd be someone
Beautiful son, without your guns, you'd be someone
