Dreaming lightly on your own 
I wouldn't mind you being alone
Nothing here has been the same
Ever since this winter came
Seized the engine in my heart
And the cold could break my soul apart
Frozen on my knees I pray
Love will melt this all away
Dreaming lightly on my own
I wouldn't mind to be alone

I'm freezing [X4]
Freezing

Dreaming lightly on your own 
I wouldn't mind you being alone
Thought I may have spoke too soon
Now confusion fogs the moon
Dying for a yes or no
Life is full of maybe so
Anything to break the ice
Love would more than just suffice
Dreaming lightly on my own
I wouldn't mind to be alone

I'm freezing [X7]
Freezing

Dreaming lightly on your own
Dreaming lightly on my own
Dreaming lightly on my own
Dreaming lightly on my own
Dreaming lightly on your own

My own, my own, my own, my own, my own yeah
On your own, On your own
I'm freezing
Freezing
Freezing

Love would more than just suffice
Dreaming lightly on my own
I wouldn't mind to be alone
I'm freezing
I'm freezing
I'm freezing
I'm freezing
