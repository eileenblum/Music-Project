She's rubber and I am glue
She had a lot to say and stuck it to my brain
She is recovered and I am screwed
She had a lot to say and I'll take it to my grave

If I could make all of my words count
I'd ditch numbers altogether for sure
Voice reversed yelling a curse
Towards the way-back of my skull
Over and over and over again

She had a lot to say
Came by to water my flower bed
Oh what a big mistake, it rains here everyday
Damage-needle pinned to red
She had a lot to say and I'll take it to my grave

If I could make all of my words count
I'd ditch numbers altogether for sure
Voice reversed yelling a curse
Towards the way-back of my skull
Over and over and over again

This is more side effect than I expect
That boy is so glum
This is more side effect inside this wreck
That boy is so numb

If I could make all of my words count
I'd ditch numbers altogether for sure
Voice reversed yelling a curse
Towards the way-back of my skull
Over and over and over again

She had a lot to say, to say
She had a lot to say, to say
Say, she had a lot to say
