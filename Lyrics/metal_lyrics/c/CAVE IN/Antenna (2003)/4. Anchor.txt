Whatever makes you tired the resting always fails
'Cos anywhere you lay yourself's a bed of nails
Whatever you exhale I breathe it in the end
You offer me a seat in your electric chair

Are you safe to leave behind
Every anchor in your mind
You know better than I do
So pull me in

Every day you ask yourself, "Why was I born?"
'Cos every migrane feels like wearing a crown of thorns
And all the time I find you crawling on all fours
'Cos any movement sends you falling through trap doors

Are you safe to leave behind
Every anchor in your mind
You know better than I do
So pull me in

Are you safe to leave behind
Every anchor in your mind
You know better than I do
So pull me in

No tongue in cheek
To late it's already days and weeks
Before we can make ends meet
Am I right and you're wrong?
Too late it already takes too long
Too much to be flushed with you
Oh
Too much to be flushed with you

Whatever makes you tired the resting always fails
'Cos anywhere you lay yourself's a bed of nails

Are you safe to leave behind
Every anchor in your mind
You know better than I do
So pull me in

Are you safe to leave behind
Every anchor in your mind
You know better than I do
So pull me in
You know better than I do
So pull me in
You know better than I do
So pull me in
