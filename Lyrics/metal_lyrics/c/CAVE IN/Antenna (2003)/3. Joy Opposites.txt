He loves to hate; she hates to love
And all of the above
His dirty mind; she just stays clean and sober

True romance in joy opposites always is the case
When you only enjoy taking on all the colours that surround you

She's on the fence; he's on the ground
Laid out face down
She takes so long; he's hanging on forever

True romance in joy opposites always is the case
When you only enjoy taking on all the colours that surround you

Any sign of life you might want to share with me tonight?
Any sign of life you might want to share with me tonight?

He's always lost; she knows the way
Softly he'll say "Can you bring me at your pace?"
Bring me at your pace

True romance in joy opposites always is the case
When you only enjoy taking on all the colours that surround you

True romance, true romance, true romance after all
True romance, true romance, true romance after all

True love in joy opposites always is the case
