It's time to tell the truth
To anyone who cares to know
What brought him to this point
Curled up into a ball
They stole the only things that could break his fall

Almost out of air, far beyond repair, doomed
Time is wearing thin, the Technicolor is gone
See it all numb in black and white

So now please it's your last drop of air
So now breathe and take your very first breath of water
Allow yourself just one breath of water
Allow yourself this one last breath

He ran away from home
Leaving a trail so friends could hunt
And find him in the snow
But a scent is not enough
And we're sure he's barely strong enough
To survive the cold

Almost out of air, far beyond repair, doomed
Time is wearing thin, the Technicolor is gone
See it all numb in black and white

So now please it's your last drop of air
So now breathe and take your very first breath of water
Allow yourself just one breath of water
Allow yourself this one last breath

I'd rather spare the truth
From anyone who cares to know
Exactly how we found him
But it's time to share the truth
With anyone who carelessly
Goes out too deep alone

so now

mmm breath of water
allow yourself this one breath of water
allow yourslef this one
allow yourslef this one
allow yourslef this one last breath

water,breath of water
breath of water
water,water,water
breath of water
