Radar, you lost me
An impossible disguise
Men all around are searching hard
Nevermind, he's so long and gone
Boy, he's really hard to find!
And by design you know he won't be found
Otherwise he'll crash into the ground

Lifted away
What a day to be lost in the air!

They won't come across me
Hiding in the sky
Cause' nobody walks without their heads
pointed down at the ground in a daze
Well, it's amazing what you'd find
And by design you know I won't come down
Otherwise I'll crash into the ground

Lifted away
What a day to be lost in the air!
