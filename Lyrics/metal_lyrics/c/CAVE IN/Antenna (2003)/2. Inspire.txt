A vase of wilted flowers
For those of you who've lost their powers
No use in treading water
Where there's no air to breathe in

Help me find a way to move on
Standing in the way of the sun
Help me find you (you you), help you find me
Now who inspires you?

Her moods are so abrasive
The sound is too persuasive
Curve of the earth has gone straight
Shall we go on one last date?

Help me find a way to move on
Standing in the way of the sun
Help me find you (you you), help you find me
Who inspires you?
Who inspires you?
Who inspires you?
Who inspires you?

I'm sorry to inform you
Sometimes love can deform you
No time for hesitating
Her rifle is cocked and waiting, cocked and waiting
Aimed at me

Help me find a way to move on
Standing in the way of the sun
Help me find you (you you), help you find me
Now who inspires you?
Who inspires you?
Who inspires you?
