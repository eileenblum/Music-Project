You wished all the best for me
The best of bad luck that I'll ever need
Keeping money in your shoes so you look really tall
After reading the fine print,
I know why it looks so small
Cashing in day trader, cash in all that you own

The more that you give, the more I can live

I know that I'm very concerned in making sure
my dunce cap fits my head snug
As for public figures, once you figure them out
Everybody's interest seems a little beyond your own
Cashing in day trader, cash in all that you own

The more that you give, the more I can live
