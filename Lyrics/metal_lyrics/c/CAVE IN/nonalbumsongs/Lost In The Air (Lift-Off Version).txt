Radar, you've lost me
An impossible disguise
Men all around are searching hard
Nevermind, he's so long and gone
Boy, he's really hard to find
And by design you know he won't be found

They won't come across me
Hiding in the skies
Cause' nobody walks without their heads
Pointing down at the ground in a daze
Well, it's amazing what you'll find
By design you know I won't come down
Otherwise I'll crash into the ground

Lifted away!
What a day to be lost in the air

Radar, you've lost me
An impossible disguise
Men all around are searching hard
Nevermind, he's so long and gone
Boy, he's really hard to find
And by design you know he won't be found

Somehow disabled,
I plummeted from the sky
I wasn't able to make it down alive
But I saw it first-hand from above
And the view was all I needed
Happiness in flight was all that I'd found
Buried at sea, not underground

Lifted away!
What a day to be lost in the air
