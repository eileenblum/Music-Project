It's time to tell the truth
To anyone who cares to know
What brought him to this point
Curled up into a ball,
They stole the only thing that could break his fall

He ran away from home, leaving a trail
So friends could hunt and find him in the snow
But a scent is not enough,
And we're sure he's barely strong enough
To survive the cold
We put a flame beneath his feet
He's in dire need of heat,
And I still can't feel his pulse
All the blood froze in his brains
We must now thaw out the veins

So now, please,
It's your last drop of air
So now, breathe,
And take your very first breath of water
Allow yourself just one breath of water

It's time to tell the truth
To everyone who cares to know
Exactly how we found him:
Some sick and twisted man put a carrot
Where his nose had been
With a black top hat to match

I learned about the burn, third-degree inside of me
So red that my posture sinks
I learned about the burn, third-degree inside of me
Not fed, my stomach shrinks
I learned about the burn, third-degree inside of me
Wisdom is an ugly leak

It's time to tell the truth
To anyone who carelessly
Goes out too deep alone
