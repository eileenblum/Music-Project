[Verse]
here he lies deceiver
with the whole world in his hands
kill two birds with one stone
it's a half-ass trip
or am i standing still?

[Chorus]
you don't need to bother me
with your electromagnetic guilt
(and)you don't need to bother me
He is all around

[Verse]
what circumstances come to
the cell of burning fields
(oh)what circumstances come to
the hell of burning dreams
or am i standing still?

[Chorus]
you don't need to slaughter me
with your sifting streamline guilt
(and)you don't need to slaughter me
He is lasting sound
