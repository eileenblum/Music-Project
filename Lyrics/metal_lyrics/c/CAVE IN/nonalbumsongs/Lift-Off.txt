Right way down the wrong road
Wrong way down the right road
Hey man, watch where you're going
Hey man, watch where you're going

Lift-off!
We're on our way home
Lady, that's when you'll say to me:
"We'll do what we can..."

We're in orbital mode
We're on our way to the top floor
Hey man, watch where you're going
Hey man, watch where you're going

Lift-off!
We're on our way home
Lady, that's when you'll say to me:
"We'll do what we can...
Anything at all to make you comfortable
Before we re-enter the atmosphere"

If a crash-landing ends our trek
I'll be first to leave the wreck
Hey man, go where I go
Hey man, know what I know

Lift-off!
We're on our way home
Lady, that's when you'll say to me:
"We'll do what we can...
Anything at all to make you comfortable
Before we re-enter the atmosphere"
