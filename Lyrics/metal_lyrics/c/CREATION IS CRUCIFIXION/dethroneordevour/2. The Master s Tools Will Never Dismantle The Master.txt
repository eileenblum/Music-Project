my insides are weak when hands are the voice and minds are destroyed what truth do I know if I know I don't live and my insides aren't there my hands serve a structure and truth I do not know what invention is this that covers my eyes and weakens my insides what creation is this that makes children cry and makes fathers die my hands serve a truth I do not know
