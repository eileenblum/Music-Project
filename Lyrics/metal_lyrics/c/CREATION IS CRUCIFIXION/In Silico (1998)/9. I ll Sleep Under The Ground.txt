stones of red take my heart i don't want to fucking live you can have my heart I give up the struggle I don't want the fight I don't want to fucking live the grounds where I'll sleep tonight watch the serpent bleed as I succumb to the sun a voice turns to screams my ideal life is done where will I sleep when my bed is lost I'll sleep by the tree I'll sleep under the ground watch the serpent bleed slavery conquers the sun a voice turns to screams debord's life is done
