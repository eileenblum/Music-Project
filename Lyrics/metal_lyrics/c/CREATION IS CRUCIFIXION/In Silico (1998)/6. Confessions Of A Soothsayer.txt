perpetual becoming master and slave embraced by a kiss the solemn reply I must only conquer myself opinions mean nothing insignificance dominates I've created this hell when will it end language is lost in the struggle I confess my thoughts I accept my slavery I embrace only death embrace the machine the next step in evolution I'll be glad when we're dead I'm sick of this place can't control my thoughts I'll love the machine only one species must end the next evolution I'll begin it myself I'll embrace the cure I accept my consumption I want to feel numb I'll love the machine until we're dead until we evolve
