it is impossible to resist we are binary I've been devoured and consumed I accept my fate my legs are heavy so the marching will stop the questions will end I have been coded I resist I lied to myself I have been dictated by the program I will run my course then I will succumb it is impossible to resist I accept my code I've lived and now I die by the code silence innocence means little in the eyes of the new lord I resist I resist I resist I tried I can't resist
