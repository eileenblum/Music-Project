1660, a child was born,
who grew up to be a man of greed and scorn
Born a noble, but denied his legacy,
young Adrian began a life of piracy

Possessed with a hunger for gold crowns,
and bloodlust in a heart so cold
All ships that he met went down
to the bottom, released from gold

His dark reputation was growing,
and so did the prize on his head
The streams of blood and gold were flowing,
and most rulers wanted him dead

[Pre Chorus]
Blinded by his greed he made a name in history
Great tall ships and many men met their destiny

Oh, but he could not see
how his end would be,
to hang from a tree
for his piracy

[Chorus]
And so the legend was born
about the king of the seven seas
Adrian Blackwood was his name
And still no one has found
the treasure from the wild plundering
times, when the seven seas were ruled
by gunpowder, blood and gold

His downfall was caused by treason,
with kings gold his crew were bought
Jealousy and greed were the reasons
when Blackwood the Cruel was caught

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Solo Both, Dahl, Both]
[Chorus]
