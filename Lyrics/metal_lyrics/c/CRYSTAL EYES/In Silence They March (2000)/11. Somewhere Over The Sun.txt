See the suffering man with a sword in his hand
He's standing by the grave of the girl he could not save
There's a tear in his eye, and he's wondering why
the father in the sky had let the young girl die

[Pre Chorus]
The lonely man kneels down to pray
while her spirit flies away
But he knows that someday they will meet again

[Chorus]
Somewhere over the sun,
where the sky is the ground,
where the bright angels fly,
where we go when we die

Filled with anger and hate he will search for his fate
In darkness he will walk, to no one he will talk
For revenge he will slay all who'll come in his way,
and with her face in mind he'll leave no life behind

[Pre Chorus]
A river of blood fills his trace
All are damned who see his face
He won't rest 'til that day when they meet again

[Chorus]
[Solo Both, Dahl, Nyberg]

He won't rest 'til that day when they meet again

[Chorus]
