Gazing out my window into a world of shadows
Snow is slowly falling, I feel something calling
Something is wrong in this landscape of ice,
and I can almost sense reality's demise

I rub my eyes, is this a trick of my mind?
But it seems that the world has changed
Confounded I feel a chilling wind,
and I realise there is snow in my room

And I see places I have never been
And I see things I have never seen

[Pre Chorus]
So I press my face closer to the glass
Staring out, oblivious of the time that pass
What was that under the oak over there?
Was there some kind of laughter in the chilly air?

[Chorus]
A journey through ice in the winternight,
a place forever dressed in white
Reality fades in the winternight,
a land of shadows and moonlight

[Solo Dahl]

And that special mood is catching me
And I'm beginning to hear and see

[Pre Chorus]
Faint voices whisper in the dark night
Weird creatures bounce just out of sight
And I see places I have never been
And I see things I have never seen

[Chorus]
