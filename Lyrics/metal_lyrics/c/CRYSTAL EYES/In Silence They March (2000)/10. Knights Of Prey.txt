Like a bolting herd they came from the gates of hell
All baptised in the Devil's name to serve under his bell
In the wind you hear them scream "Time to feed the sword!"
Blood now flows in an endless stream to praise and honour their lord

[Pre Chorus]
You never know when they attack,
until you fall with a sword in your back
Soldiers of death appear in your last breath
And there will be no time to fight
'cause you're already the target in their sight
Now hear them shout!

[Chorus]
We are the great Knights of Prey
We were born to slay and spread terror over the world
See us ride together as one, with mercy to none
'cause we are the great Knights of Prey,
and we are out of control

There's no place where you can hide, there's no use to flee
Through the cities, side by side comes your cruel destiny
Only a few chosen men can defend mankind
Will we ever be free again and get peace in our minds

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The time has come when good faces evil
A war between Heaven and Hell, and no one knows
who will win and who will fall

[Solo Both, Dahl, Nyberg]
[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]
