Born in the sky a million years ago
Raised by the stars. The whole universe I know
Faster than light and brighter than the sun
Blazing up high. I'm a comet on the run

[Pre Chorus]
Gates I burn between dimensions
Nothing is too tough
The speed of light gives me the tension
I can't get enough

The past is hunting me
I have to go. I must be free
The future's calling on me now
So I

[Chorus]
fly to another time,
to another place beyond the gates
I'm a child of the stars
High in the starlit sky
I'm exploding through the galaxies,
and forever I'm riding the universe

Free as a bird I'm shooting on and on
Burning the sky like a roaring firestorm
Flashing through time. The light-years have no chance
Maximum speed. Thunderbolts are as in trance

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Solo Dahl, Both, Dahl]

[Bridge]
Gates I burn between dimensions
Nothing is too tough
The speed of light gives me the tension
I can't get enough
The future's calling on me now
So I

[Chorus]
