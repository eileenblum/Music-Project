Ever since I took that black sword of might
from the hands of a fallen tainted Chaos knight,
a dark presence has grown inside of me
and merged with my soul. I'm no longer me

[Pre Chorus]
Dreams of bloodshed haunt my nights,
I fear what's in me
Dreams of violence in endless fights,
my future I see

The darkness inside is now fully unleashed
My humanity is gone. I've changed into a beast
I now have to leave the kingdoms of Man,
and travel north to the Wastes if I can

[Pre Chorus]
Dreams of bloodshed fill my nights,
so sweet dreams indeed
Dreams of violence in endless fights
will soon change to deeds

[Chorus]
Beyond all hope, I'm cursed and damned
From all mankind I'm forever banned
Well, so be it, I accept my fate
I embrace the dark and submit to my hate

At last I have reached the ever-changing land
where men turn into gods or dust in the sand

[Pre Chorus]
So I tread upon this road
of damnation and sin
that leads to death or might untold
Let slaughter begin!

[Chorus]
[Solo Dahl]
[Chorus]
