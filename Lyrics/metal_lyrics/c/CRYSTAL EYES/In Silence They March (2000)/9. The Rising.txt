A holy man has risen from ashes and dust
A saviour with the mission: to turn fear into trust

[Pre Chorus]
The forgotten land in the ruins of the storm
can now be reborn and new minds can take form
The fallen ones are rising again
to follow the chosen one who will lead them to freedom

[Chorus]
Oh saviour, heed our call
Our lives are in your hands
Forever you'll be our king
You are now in command
You have the might
For you we'll fight,
and you will lead us to the light

He came without a warning, appeared from nowhere
A master of deliverance from death and despair

[Pre Chorus]
The victims of war who had once met their fate
have now been reborn to an army of hate
Led by their king they'll have their revenge
A storm of immortals is now about to destroy mankind

[Chorus]
[Solo Both, Dahl, Nyberg]
[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]
