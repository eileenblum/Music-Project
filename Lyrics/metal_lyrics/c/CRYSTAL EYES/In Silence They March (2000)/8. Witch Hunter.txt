[Intro]
"Halt, brothers.
So this is Waldreik, a town infested by Chaos.
Well, it will soon be cleansed.
Burn the houses and gather the people where I can pass my judgement upon 
them.
Now, move!"

I can smell the stench of Chaos,
there's something rotten about this town
Behind these walls, unholy rapture
But I'll cleanse it, I'll burn it down
I say: "Burn it down to the ground!"

I can see the whores of Chaos,
damned women who practise dark lore
Righteous men they try to capture
Well, they shall burn - witching whores
I say: "Burn them all at the stake!"

[Chorus]
Witches I hunt and warlocks I slay
I cleanse this world from filth and decay
Chaos sinners, they are everywhere
But I hunt them down, no one I spare

I can see the face of Chaos
behind corrupted men's false smiles
They may appear good of nature,
but underneath they are most vile
I say: "Burn them all at the stake!"

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Gods of Law, Order and Light,
bless my eyes so I can see through lies
Gods of Law, Order and Light,
bless my sword against Chaos' hordes

[Solo Both, Dahl]

[Bridge]
I can see the taint of Chaos,
there is not a soul without stains
All are foul Chaos creatures,
and all shall burn in holy flames
I say: "Burn them all at the stake!"

[Chorus]
[Solo Nyberg]
