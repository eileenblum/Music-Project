Strong winds on the sea of the damned
The high waves break the land
Bright sunlight is melting the snow
The winter land starts to flow

Springtime is the season we hail,
the time to set our sails
Shortly we will set our course
and sail to foreign shores

[Pre Chorus]
Odin! give us the force
We're leaving the cost behind us
Oh Thor! bring us the storm
The longboat is in your hands
Let the ravens fly once again

[Chorus]
From the north we come - Great Odin's sons
Glory will come as we sail
From the sea we come - Great Odin's sons
Fearless and strong we'll prevail
We fight, we kill, we die for the Viking Gods

At dawn we are ready to slay,
'cause mayhem is our way
We hunt, rape and slaughter the weak
Destruction is what we seek

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Solo Both, Dahl, Nyberg]
[Chorus]
