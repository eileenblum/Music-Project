You sworn the sacred oath to God
and to the evil beast below,
and then you took place as the Grim Reaper
You were supposed to bring the souls
from all the bodies of the dead
But you had other plans, you stole instead

[Pre Chorus]
Years of lies to collect and build your own paradise,
where you thought you could be safe
But all your plans were crushed when God found out

[Chorus]
Liar! now you shall burn in the Fire
for years of greed and desire
It's time to pay, and you will pay with your life
Sinner! you always thought you're a winner,
but you were just a loser in a Grim Reaper suit
Now, meet your fate in the flames

You played a false and wicked game
You didn't care about the souls
You were possessed of stealing. Oh! you were God
And all the beautiful young girls
that just had died an early death,
became your favourite toys and great lovers

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Solo Both]

[Bridge]
Burn now! Burn for your lies. Burn for your sins
You'll burn in the fire for years of desire and greed
No more stealing and sin, fucking the dead
or playing God on earth
Now it's time to pay for the mess you have caused
and for being faithless to God
The price of your lies is your life
Forever you'll burn for your lust
'Cause all your plans were crushed when God found out

[Chorus]
