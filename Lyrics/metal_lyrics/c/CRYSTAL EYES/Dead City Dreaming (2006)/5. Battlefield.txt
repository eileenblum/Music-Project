Now I stand here alone
watching over shadows
on this field of death
I slowly raise my head

I can't escape or deny
the pain I carry inside
But I will rise again
before the night descends

[Pre Chorus]
Armed to prevail and eager to slay
I can't rest until I get my revenge

[Chorus]
Raise your banners
Raise your banners high
Into battle - Into war we'll ride

Rumbling under the sky
the brave are waiting to fight
Laughing at your gods
I'll crush your filthy hearts

Let the wind of war whine
as the chaos arise
What will be, will be
This is my destiny

[Pre Chorus]
You'll taste my blade in one final breath
I can't rest until you're wiped off this earth

[Chorus]

[Solo Dahl]

[Bridge]
Warriors! Sight your preys
Victory lies ahead
Warriors! Sight your preys
Victory lies ahead

[Chorus]
Raise your banners
Raise your sword and shield
Die with honour on the battlefield
