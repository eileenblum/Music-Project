Behold the eternal loner
escaping his troubled mind
A stranger caught in the wheel of time

The lost traveller is fighting
to hold back the passing days
but there're no breaks on the train of life

[Pre Chorus]
Can I forgive? Can I forget? I don't know
Maybe the wind of death will solve it all

[Chorus]
Somewhere I went astray
in labyrinths of my soul
I try to find my way
walking along endless
roads of loneliness

The eyes of the solitary
are nailed to the empty view
of everlasting uncertainty

How long do I have to struggle
when no battle's to be won?
It's all a perpetual insanity

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Solo Dahl]

[Chorus]
