Buildings of dark crumbling stone
A presence of malice and horrors unknown
Vast endless stairways and halls
From black yawning portals insanity calls

[Pre Chorus]
In ruins aeons old,
beneath the sea,
the Ancients long to be free

[Chorus]
They lie dead and dreaming
at this fallen site,
waiting for their soon coming reign
When their slaves start dreaming,
and the stars are right,
they'll awake again and reclaim
the Earth

Nightmares cause mind-numbing fear
to poets and artists all over the world
Strange visions are haunting their sleep:
A city of madness that lurks in the deep

[Pre Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Solo Dahl]

[Bridge]
Timeless terrors rise
Insanity
awaits for all humanity

[Chorus]

The Great Old Ones shall reign again
