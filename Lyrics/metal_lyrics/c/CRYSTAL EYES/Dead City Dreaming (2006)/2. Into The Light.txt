When the morning has broken
can you see the great open sky,
or are you afraid to enter life?

From your world's obligations
I have struggled to get away,
and now I'm finally free

[Pre Chorus]
From the land of order I'm hiding
In the hand of shelter I roam
There's a light beyond the mountains,
and there's where I go

[Chorus]
When the Maker rock the boat
the unbelievers dive together
Tonight we celebrate our never-ending flight
And together side by side we run into the light

I'm a needle in your eye
I'm the one you can never be
You're a dutiful drudge lost in time

There is no use denying
labour and guilt will always rule
your predictable realm

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Solo Dahl]

[Bridge]
There are preachers among the fools
spinning tales of laws and rules
It's a language spoken in vain
I will never learn to take the blame
