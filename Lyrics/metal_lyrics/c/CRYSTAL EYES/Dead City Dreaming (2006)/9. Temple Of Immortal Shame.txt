Jaws of devastation
breathing fire in my face
Words of oppression bite me with disgust

Eyes of condemnation
piercing my forsaken soul
Another sacrifice has to be done

[Pre Chorus]
In the altar's shadow
I confess my heresy
I'm a perfect sinner,
unbound and free

[Chorus]
All my demons come alive
inside the temple of immortal shame
Lord, have mercy on me now!
I have no other choice but to lie
straight in the face of Death

[Solo Dahl]

Claws of frozen hatred
wrapping tight around my neck
as I'm allowed to answer the foul beast

Can I cheat to be spared
from the hand of slavery
or will my true intentions be revealed?

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Life, only for the brave
Whips and chains, only for the slaves
I am no slave!

[Chorus]
