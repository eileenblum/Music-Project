Anywhere where the word is told
speculations steal the show
Itâs a never ending ignorance

Any rumour they believe
Any secret they reveal
They are blinded by their arrogance

[Pre Chorus]
Vultures of lies stain my dignity
with their eternal insanity

[Chorus]
I stand before the narrow mind
A victim of opinions
All has the right to judge my life
Here in the foolsâ dominion

An invention in the wind
or a guess of what could be
is enough to draw an inference

What is wrong and what is right,
what is black and what is white
Will they ever learn the difference?

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Solo Dahl, Nyberg]

[Chorus]
