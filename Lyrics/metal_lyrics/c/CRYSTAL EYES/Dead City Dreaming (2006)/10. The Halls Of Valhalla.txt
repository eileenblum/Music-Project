Night falls on the battlefield
where the blood of heroes lie
Still dying with sword in hand
I await the northern lights
Borne on the wings of fate they'll come
to grant my final ride

[Chorus]
To the land of the glorious dead, up high
where I shall be given eternal life
With the bravest warriors I'll unite
On the plain of consecration I'll fight
In the home of the slain
there is only room for the chosen ones
Let me die bold and brave
to deserve my place in the Halls of Valhalla

All my life I have been yearning
for this battle to come
Night and day I have been fighting
for my prize to be won

Death calls in the chilling wind
How I yearn to bid farewell
to the Earth and mortality
and the sky I know too well
Borne on the wings of fate they'll come
to grant my final ride

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Odin! Expose your kingdom in the sky
Embrace my soul, now as I die
Nothing remains between me and the stars
So now I'm claiming my reward

Asgard awaits, Asgard awaits
Let me come home
Don't forget me, don't forsake me
Let me come home
Home to my father where I was meant to be

[Chorus]

Valhalla
