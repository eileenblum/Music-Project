In the forest of silver and haze
where the children of yesterday play
We sail away on a river of dreams
bound to carry the night side by side

No tomorrow, no clouds in the sky
Just the echo of time passing by
We hold the moment and glide with the wind
to wherever the stars may decide

[Pre Chorus]
Eyes of thousands are shining in the night
for the power of sound in the neon lights
Smoke and thunder, excitement and delight
The show has begun and the waves on the sea never end

[Chorus]
We all come alive in the land of memories
where our destinies unite in harmony
Shadows of the night, young and old, stranger or not
There's a room for everyone who come to the wall of stars

[Solo Dahl]

See the beauty embracing the beast
to the magic of song in the breeze
In the eye of the storm they are lost
gazing over the field where spirits fly

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]

I recall another day
I recall another place
No matter how far you go
you'll always be heading home
Immortal words in the wind
sung by the stars will guide your way
