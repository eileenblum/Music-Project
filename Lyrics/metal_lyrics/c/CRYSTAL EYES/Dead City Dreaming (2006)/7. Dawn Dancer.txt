Beyond the doors of the living
where imagination fades
The eyes of ancient ages
are gazing over a crimson shade

[Pre Chorus]
The future unfolds with the rising sun
Unspoken words where nothing yet's been done
Where the book of life paints the sky

[Chorus]
Dawn dancer share your mind
Tell me the story of tomorrow
Dawn dancer let me know
the one way I must follow
Dawn dancer turn the page
Where do I go and what is my fate?
Dawn dancer tell me all
Now, before it is too late

A warning from the unknown
A prophecy for the wise
The coming lies before you,
but can you see your own demise?

[Pre Chorus]
A distant sight visualize our doom
Destiny calls and the future looms
Where the book of life paint the sky

[Chorus]

[Solo Dahl]

[Bridge]
I'm ready for the end
Let us find it together
I'm ready for knowledge
I've been waiting forever

[Chorus]
