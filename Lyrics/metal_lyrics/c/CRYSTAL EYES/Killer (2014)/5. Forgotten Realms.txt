On a cold winter night in the valley of nowhere
I was suddenly there. The hourglass of life was now turning for me

Down the memory lane. I was out of oblivion
Slowly drifting away beyond the doors of time to a forgotten realm

[Chorus]
Eternal life, eternal freedom
Where childhood dreams are reality
The empire - The empire
On the other side
The empire - The empire
Where history ends and fantasy comes alive

Could I believe, could I rely on this brave new world
They'd taken my life, taken my breath away
All I'd seen was hate

A child of a lost age arose in the dark
He made me remember, told me tales from the past

[Chorus]

Somewhere in time I'm born again
Caught in the mind of a stranger
I've been here before, I know how it ends
But this time I won't let them carry my fate, no!

[Solo Dahl]

I see them walk, I hear them talk
Through mirrors of reflected yesterdays
I see them walk, I hear them talk
A vision of the lost souls cast away on earth

Over the mountains and far away from the undead
The empire
Far from the crossfire of Heaven and Hell I awake
The empire
All that I've longed for has finally taken me home to where I belong
