Welcome brothers and legion knights!
At my command you will ride
Straight to the heart of battle and chaos
In the hunt of the crown
We've come for the vengeance, the blood and the pride
With Death as our guide

[Chorus]
Hail the fallen - Hail the fallen
Raise the hammer for them all
Hail the fallen - Hail the fallen
Raise the hammer for them all

Unleash your wrath on the enemy
Spare no lives, kill them all
Sworn to avenge, we'll never surrender
To the realm of the Lord
Beyond the shadows of war
Upon the ebony throne
A beast in a castle with blood on his mind
Is waiting to die

[Chorus]
[Solo Dahl]

[Bridge]
In the wind they call from the other side
Words of the brave to lead us on
On a starlit sky we sight the end
Where the final army of the King is gone

Conquer the master with bloody revenge
Fate is now ours to decide
We storm to the battle to honour the ones
Who were lost to the crown

[Chorus]
