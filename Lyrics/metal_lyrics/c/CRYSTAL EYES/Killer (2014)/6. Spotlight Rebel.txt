Cold nights - the silence crawling down the walls
Daylight - from far away you hear them call

[Pre Chorus]
Don't let the sound of freedom fade
Don't let the final curtain fall

[Chorus]
'Cause you're a spotlight rebel
King over thousand leather crowds
'Cause you're a spotlight rebel
You're born to rock. Forever loud

Hold tight - The windy road is all you know
One life is all you get. Don't let it go

[Pre Chorus]
Don't let them down, don't let them wait
Waste no more time, bring on the show

[Chorus]

When the light is out you look a stranger in the eye
From a distant mirror silent crying for another life

[Solo Dahl, Karlsson, Dahl, Karlsson, Dahl]

[Bridge]
Another town, another stage
Another crowd, another encore
The dream goes on without a break
There's no way out, you have to carry on

[Chorus]

You're born to rock
You're born to rock
You're born to rock. Forever loud
You're born to rock
You're born to rock
You're born to rock. Forever loud
