Do you hear it knocking on the door of your demise?
Are you ready for the ending chapter of your life?
Will you rise and stand defiant when the final journey calls?
The sirens in the morning is a welcome to your fall

[Pre Chorus]
All my life is like a never-ending dream
Always hiding from the dying whirl of sin
Itâs killing me but I'll stay alive

[Chorus]
The world is a road I walk on my own
I am a warrior
Alone I will fight alone, I will die
I am a warrior

Can you read the writings on the wall of empty lies?
Do you see the hollow future vanish in the sky?
In the eyes of roaring giants you're an outlaw of the damned
A blinded unbeliever who belongs in no man's land

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Solo Karlsson]

[Bridge]
When the night is falling the shadows come alive
And to the lonely silence Iâm walking on the island of sinners
Oh yeah!
I face the burning demon but never fear the light
Itâs just a great illusion here to fool my tired eyes
