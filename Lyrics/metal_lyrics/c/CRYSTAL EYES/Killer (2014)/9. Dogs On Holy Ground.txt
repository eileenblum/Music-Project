Enter the lights of the Promised Land
Take a ride in Heaven's garden
A treasure island close at hand
All you can imagine lies unguarded

Open the gate to another world
where windows glare of gold and diamonds
Make a fortune undisturbed
by the long arm of the law

[Pre Chorus]
Let it be done. Grab it and run
Like a God of the neon lights
you ride on your greed, reckless and free,
in your wildest dream

[Chorus]
Dogs on holy ground
Playing on the lightnings highway
Dogs on holy ground
Hell bent on a dollar-eyed crusade

Drawn into kleptomania
More and more, you can't restrain it
By obsession you are blind
There's no limit to what can be taken

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Solo Karlsson, Dahl]

[Bridge]
Stay unseen
Waste no time from your hallowed prize
Ask no questions. Leave no trace
You're God. You're holy
You're rushing like a rocket of desire

[Chorus]
