From the abyss of Hell they have come
A reign of darkness awaits
Caught in fire our kingdoms are gone
Damned to burn is our fate

[Pre Chorus]
The time of the mortals
has come to the end
The final destruction
of man now ascends

[Chorus]
Flames of Hades are burning wide
as the age of death arrives
Held in iron hands of doom
we face the Lord of chaos

Clouds of terror have darkened the earth
Only ruin remains
Genocide of the whole human race
We are bound to be slain

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Solo Karlsson, Dahl]

Shadow-demons casting souls
into the fires of Hell
There's no return. Down we go
to burn in torment forever

[Chorus]
