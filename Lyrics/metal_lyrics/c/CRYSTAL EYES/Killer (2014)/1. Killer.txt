Eyes of fire. The streets are alive
Hounds of darkness are calling
From the shadowed side of midnight
I return with no warning

[Pre Chorus]
Killer - Prowler - Hunter
Behind your back
I'm a killer, a prowler
Meant to follow the slide of the blade

[Chorus]
Light my journey through the dark
Time is dawning for a sacrifice
I'm ready for the night

One desire and one way to ride
Desperate hunger to murder
Always waiting at the alley
For a prey to devour

[Pre Chorus]
Killer - Prowler - Hunter
Bound to destroy
I'm a killer, a prowler
At the hour of twilight I reign

[Chorus]
[Solo Karlsson, Dahl]
[Chorus]

I'm ready for the night
I'm ready for the night
I'm ready to offer the blood of my victims tonight
