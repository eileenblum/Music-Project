Life is calling for the chosen ones
Lay down your load and bury your sorrow
Time to spread your wings and fly away
Open your eyes and run for tomorrow

[Pre Chorus]
Into the sun and beyond, then you're out of the shadows
Don't be afraid of the dawn in the future to come

[Chorus]
Soar in the sky of eternal light
The bright eyes of Terra will never leave your sight
No matter how long or far you ride
You'll find your way back home again
My solar mariner

Guided by the morning star you'll find
Halos and glare leading to freedom
Glide unbound across the Universe
Maybe you reach a galactic Eden

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Solo Karlsson, Dahl]

[Bridge]
Sail on, Sail on
Sail on, Sail on
Into the stellar horizon forever and more

[Chorus]
