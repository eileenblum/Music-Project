[Music: Mikael Dahl - Lyrics: Mikael Dahl]

Across a hot and desert land
Against the wind of dust and sand
Reality seems so far away

Under the burning mortal sun
I find myself, the lonely one
A stranger rushing blindly through the day

[Pre Chorus]
Burning Horizon you are calling me
Burning Horizon you will set me free

[Chorus]
Once a hero, now a shade
Chasing dreams that slowly fade
On the endless road to nowhere I ride
Once a proud man, now a ghost
In search of peace from coast to coast
From my dark and empty life I can not hide

Don't know how many years have past,
or how long this journey will last
Tomorrow seems so far far away

I am a madman on the run
Yes, a lost forgotten son
All I know's that I can not stay

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Solo Both, Dahl, Nyberg]

[Bridge]
Memories of pain hunt me everyday
They're driving me insane.
I can't find a way out of this hell
Someone please tell. Why did it all go wrong?
And tell me where, just where do I belong?
Let me find a place to stay

[Chorus]
