[Music: Mikael Dahl - Lyrics: Mikael Dahl]

A wind of hatred is blowing across the field

I am the voice of the Clans
The leader of the Highlands
and we have come here for blood and victory

[Pre Chorus]
Before my army I speak the great words of war...
Brothers, they may take our lives
but they'll never take away our freedom

[Chorus]
Scotland! I hear you call my name,
now as we ride towards our aim
England! I damn you as I cry...
Pay for the blood on the Highlands and die!

You took my father's life
You raped and killed my wife
In God's name I swear I'll get my revenge

The great rebellion I bring
will slay you and your foul king
I am the legend, the brave, the proud, your fate

[Pre Chorus]
The last words are spoken, now hear them roar in the wind...
Brothers, they may take our lives
but they'll never take away our freedom

[Chorus]
[Solo Both, Dahl, Nyberg]

[Bridge]
We may loose the battle 
We may loose some men
But still we have showed the world
that no one can take away our freedom

[Chorus]
