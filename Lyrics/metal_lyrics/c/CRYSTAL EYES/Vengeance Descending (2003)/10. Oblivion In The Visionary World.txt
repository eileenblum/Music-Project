[Music: Mikael Dahl - Lyrics: Mikael Dahl]

When darkness enters my life, 
that's when you arise
Slowly crawling into my mind
from the other side

In a callous realm, I'm captured,
completely paralysed
Through your eyes I see the real world,
where love and hate have died

[Pre Chorus]
I'm terrified, but somehow I have always known
We are nothing but wandering spirits in an endless void

[Chorus]
On the edge of time I face my destiny,
and find myself within a false reality
Was my life a lie inside an evil whirl?
Oblivion reign within the Visionary World,
forever

[Solo Dahl]

[Bridge]
Lifeless, impassive and alone
Dreaming a dream that's not my own
Am I alive or dead?

When did they conquer our kind?
Why did they take control of our minds?
My past is erased and gone

I'm lost in a cage
Created in the age of silence and illusions

[Chorus]
