[Music: Mikael Dahl - Lyrics: Dahl, Gotesson]

I've found a way back to my home at last
A way that has been locked and cloaked until now
It's time to take care of my programmed past,
find the answers, and then finally fulfil my vow

[Pre Chorus]
I've learned from my ship's secret files
that they planned my unwanted exile!
I knew too much about their insane plan
I had to leave, from the Earth I was banned

[Chorus]
For years I have travelled in the dark and endless space,
cast out from the human race
For vengeance I'm yearning now as I'm returning
to make my wrongdoers pay for my lonely days
Revenge!

Imperfect data I got from below,
but I've learned enough from my unknown friend
They sent me away so their empire could grow
On Terra my vengeance shall descend

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Solo Both]

[Bridge]
I'm burning of hatred and rage,
for their lies and my time lost in space
I'll end the Interstellar War,
and disclose their plans of the human race

[Chorus]

Revenge will be mine!
