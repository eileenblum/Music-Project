[Music: Mikael Dahl - Lyrics: Andreas Gotesson]

The look of disbelief is still in your face
as I watch how your eyes begin to glaze
Your broken body lies in a growing pool
of blood... I have betrayed you, you sorry old fool

But to have your Art makes it worth this crime,
and your former knowledge will soon be mine
In my hands I now hold your Grand Grimoire,
the source of your once great might and arcane lore

[Pre Chorus]
How many times have I not cursed these pages?
It feels like I've been reading for ages
But I can not give up, I have to be patient
'cause your book contains the Art of the Ancient

[Chorus]
Soon your magic will lie in my hands
Every spell, powerful and grand,
of the greatest Art are going to be known to me
And then, my friend, I will no longer be...
the wizard's apprentice

[Solo Dahl]

I have found the key. How could I be so blind?
With the right phrase and the right state of mind
the power explodes in me, burning deep inside
The Art engulfs me in a roaring magic tide

[Pre Chorus]
For how many years have I not yearned and craved for this?
It feels like I have reached eternal bliss
And it does not matter much that my soul is stained
by your death, compared to what I have gained

[Chorus]
Now your magic lies in my hands
Every spell, powerful and grand,
of the greatest Art are now finally known to me
And no more, my friend, will I ever be...
the wizard's apprentice

[Solo Both]

[Bridge]
I am divine, pure energy
The Ancient's power flows in me
But it's to much for my mind to sustain
With a sudden burst of pain
all magic's scorched from my brain,
and I realise that all have been in vain
My Art is forever gone!

Solo Nyberg, Dahl

[Chorus]
So now my magic's no more
My Art is gone, my precious lore
has forever been burned away from my very core
And now I am neither the Master Mage nor
the wizard's apprentice

Just a common man
