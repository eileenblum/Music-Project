[Music: Mikael Dahl - Lyrics: Mikael Dahl]

There's a mountain by the northern sea
High and mighty like an endless tower
A tempting and majestic sight
with a treacherous secret

There's a legend 'bout its mystery
and it speaks about a tremendous power
A creation of the Gods
and a gate to Heaven

[Pre Chorus]
At night you see the light that will invite
the fearless to the summit
Climb and you will find yourself behind
the walls of ancient stone

[Chorus]
Lost souls in the mountain's grave
Not dead or alive, just forgotten
Trapped in the adventurers' cave
All condemned to languish in darkness,
silence and madness
Forever paying the price
in the heart of the mountain

In a dream you saw the land of gold,
as the mountain tempted in a vision
Where the angels spread their wings
there's where you'll find your freedom

To the glorious dream your soul was sold
To find the house of God became your mission
So you left your past behind,
and now you're heading for the sky

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Solo Both, Dahl, Nyberg]

By the light at the summit
you are turned to stone

[Chorus]
