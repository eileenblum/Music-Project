[Music: Mikael Dahl - Lyrics: Mikael Dahl]

A little child has changed our world
A light in the dark, a miracle
Forevermore her spirit will illuminate our lives

With open arms and open minds
we make her one of our kind
In unity we now welcome her with our song

[Chorus]
Spread your wings and fly, we will take you high
Child of Rock
You were born and bound to the Heavy sound
Child of Rock
Trust us when we say... Take the Metal way!

[Solo Dahl]

Life is too short to throw away
Don't waste no time, live here and today
There may be tears along the way, but we'll be here for you

There is no right, there is no wrong
What you will need is in our song
The Only Rule is all for one and one for all

[Chorus]
[Solo: Nyberg, Dahl]

[Bridge]
When we're dead and gone
you'll have to carry on
Show them that you're strong
and always remember our song

[Chorus]

Oh, oh, child you were born to rock
Oh, oh, child you were born to rock
Oh, oh, child you were born to rock
Oh, oh, child you were born to rock
We were all born to rock!
