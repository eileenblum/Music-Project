[Music: Mikael Dahl - Lyrics: Mikael Dahl]

Hey Metalhead! It's time to wake the dead
Step out of the shade, and join the great crusade
I'll be your guide on this glory ride,
and you will be my crowd. United, strong and loud

[Pre Chorus]
It's in our hearts, souls and blood forever,
and nobody can change it. No never!
Since the day we where born, we've been bound
to its powerful sound

[Chorus]
Heavy Metal - Is our sound
Heavy Metal - Is our ground
Heavy Metal - Heavy Metal
Come join the Metal Crusade

[Solo Dahl]

Fist in the air, I see them everywhere
Now they have to see what has got to be
Screaming guitars heading for the stars
It's time to let it out, so raise your voice and shout!

[Pre Chorus]

[Chorus]
Heavy Metal - Roars in our brains
Heavy Metal - Runs in our veins
Heavy Metal - Heavy Metal
Come join the Metal Crusade

[Solo Both, Dahl, Both]

It's our religion

[Chorus]
Heavy Metal - The only way
Heavy Metal - Is here to stay
Heavy Metal - Heavy Metal
Always forever

Heavy Metal - Heavy Metal
Heavy Metal - Heavy Metal
Come join the Metal
Metal crusade
