[Music: Mikael Dahl - Lyrics: Andreas Gotesson]

It's the birthday of the Emperor
The cream of the realm is here,
kings and queens with sons and daughters

It's truly a most grandiose ball,
nobles fill the halls
Like sheep, ready for slaughter

[Pre Chorus]
Oh, with rising hate I watch them dance,
I watch them prance
Oh, how I loathe these haughty swine
I'll rid the world of this living grime

[Chorus]
Peasants are saying, oh not without glee,
there's an aristocrat out on a killing spree
A noble, thirsty for royal blood they say
The Beast in Velvet I'm called by my prey

Though my fee is great indeed
I'd do this for free,
'cause I enjoy my work immensely

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Bridge 1]
With wit and grace I charm these fools
who think they're out of harm's way
None here's aware of my sins
But then again, who'd suspect a highborn prince?

[Solo Both, Dahl, Both]

[Bridge 2]
It's been so easy to lure my prey,
so to my Lord I gratefully pray
as my victim dies by my blade
Shape shifting is a useful trick in my dark trade

[Chorus]
