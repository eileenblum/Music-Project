[Music: Mikael Dahl o Lyrics: Andreas Gotesson]

It's the golden age of the human race
The time has come to conquer space
'cause we have learned to navigate
in time and space, through stargates

[Pre-Chorus]
Our starships fill the skies in countless worlds
Our warlords burn the worlds in countless galaxies
Solar Systems we bring to an end
Through war and destruction we will transcend

[Chorus:]
All over universe we are bringing war
to every galaxy we explore
Through windows in warp space
we reach the most distant place
with our mission: Interstellar war!

In every corner of the universe
planets die, explode and burst
Billions of life forms meet their fate,
due to our hunger to dominate

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus:]

The universe is now in our grasp
The last resistance is falling fast
The days of glory are drawning near,
when man shall rulle with pain and fear

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus:]
