[Music: Mikael Dahl o Lyrics: Mikael Dahl]

Living for the day
Life lights their way
They are all forever free
They will never die,
never wonder why
they are all forever free

[Pre-Chorus]
There will always be sun up in the sky
a raimbow standing high
Red horizon lights their way over the seas,
from tears of the trees
Here they always stay

[Chorus]
Ride on your wings
Children of the sky
Fly on forever,
on winds of the free

Beyond reality,
a world in harmony
They are all living in peace

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Solo: Nyberg - Dahl]

[Bridge]
We all will die someday
I hope I'll find the way
to the land of glory, and
yhen I'll fly on the winds of the tree

[Chorus]
