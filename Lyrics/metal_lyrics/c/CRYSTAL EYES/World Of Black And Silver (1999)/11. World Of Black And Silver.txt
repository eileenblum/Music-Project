[Music: Mikael Dahl o Lyrics: Andreas Gotesson]

I think I'm standing in a garden at night
The distant stars provide the only light
Strange flowers grow all around me,
theyr heavy fragance intoxicates me

[Pre-Chorus]
Reality is slowly growing dimmer
and I begin to see a new world shimmer
It's like seeing through a silver haze
into a weird but beautiful place

Filled with dreams I begin to wonder
through this maze of alien wonders
Into glades with ponds of starlight,
ethereal beauty beyond human might

[Pre-Chorus]
And I see statues moving moving as in trance
with slow gestures, in a grotesque dance
to the mystical and haunting tunes
that fills this place like narcotic fumes

[Chorus]
I might be dead: or maybe I am dreaming?
it doesn't matter, it has no meaning
in this world of black and silver

[Solo: Dhal]

[Bridge:]
Then this dream-state takes an evil twist
And all the sudden rises a reeking mist
The air turns foul by the sickening haze
Corruption spreads throughout the maze
Malignant shadows with lurid eyes,
roars with laughter as the beauty dies
Insane whispers and bestial groans,
mingle with my tormented moans

[Chorus]
