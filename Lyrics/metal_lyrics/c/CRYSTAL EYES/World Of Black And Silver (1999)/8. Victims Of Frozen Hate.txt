[Music: Mikael Dhal, Claes Wikander o Lyrics: Mikael Dahl]

They came from far away,
from a land in a frozen time
Through ice and snow they walked
with their broken homes in mind,
they cried!

Without a warning
they ended all lifes in their way
In search for a land
where they could forever stay

[Chorus]
Blood on the snow and cries in the wind
Wictims of hate, they fell to the ground
One by one, they tasted vengeance
No one could fight the soldiers in a frozen time

With tears in their eyes
the ground was painted in red
They searched for revenge,
by tghe frozen hate they were led

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
A battle in tears for the homes they had
lost in the cold
They murdered all those who dared to
come in their way

[Solo: Nyberg - Dahl]

Who where those soldiers
with frozen hate inside
And all poor victims
who had no place to hide

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
...the soldiers in a frozen time they murdered all
those who dared to come in their way
