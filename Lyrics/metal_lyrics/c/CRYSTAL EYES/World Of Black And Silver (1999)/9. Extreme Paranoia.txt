[Music: Mikael Dhal o Lyrics: Andreas Gotesson]

Sweat is running free, trickling down on my brow
Every man that I see is a potential foe
Have to stay down, have to stay low
Can not let them know

[Pre-Chorus]
And if I just can stay alert and keep my senses clear
I know that I can beat them all and maybe kill my fear

[Chorus]
But the man in the mirror is my worst enemy
Everywhere, he is there, always following me
I'm paranoid to the extreme

Agony, panic and fear are surging up inside of me
Hidden dangers are everywhere to see
Malicious lurkers, I have to flee
Oh please let me be

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
