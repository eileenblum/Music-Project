On the waves of war
Far away from mortal eyes
The sign of Jolly Roger flies over the undead

Fire and water on the horizon
Is there a world beyond the sea?
We all remember the ground of the island
where we paid the price of our greed

[Pre Chorus:]
Watching the sun fading from our eyes
When will the wind take us home?

[Chorus:]
On the waves of war
ride her ghost into the night
Condemned to carry on forever
On the waves of war
Far away from mortal eyes
The sign of Jolly Roger flies over the undead

Over the ocean like an illusion
Travel the world for land in sight
Sadly the bones shine under the moonlight
of those neither dead nor alive

[Pre Chorus:]
Day after day trying to lift the curse
Restore the gold and pay the blood

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
No stormy weather in the eyes of the lost
The shadow of tomorrow is so dark
No stormy weather in the eyes of the lost
The journey onto freedom and the quest for life
control their minds

[Solo Paul, Dahl]

Hear the thunder roaring high
Where the everlasting chain of time awaits
One desire in the dead of the night
To the red horizon
Black Pearl sail to find the light

[Chorus]
