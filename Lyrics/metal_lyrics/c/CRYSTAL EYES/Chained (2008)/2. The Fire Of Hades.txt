Long ago I saw tomorrow drift away
like a whirlwind on the ocean
Left alone to walk the island of decay
like a blind man led to nowhere

[Pre Chorus:]
I let it go, I let it go
After all I've found a way
from the hammer of the Gods
to the power of the dark
And the road goes on and on

[Chorus:]
I'm coming for the fire of Hades
My eternal paradise
I'm coming for the fire of Hades
Where the tempter calls my name
I surrender my soul as a final sacrifice

Over mountains roar the sound of yesterday
like a last cry of the mourner
Round and round inside the broken wheel of pain
with no light or destination

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Solo Dahl]

[Bridge:]
I'm coming home sailing on the last rays of the sun
I'm coming home from the empty world beyond
Hear me now I'm coming home
on the wind of silence to the flames
And the road goes on and on
And the road goes on and on and on

[Chorus]
