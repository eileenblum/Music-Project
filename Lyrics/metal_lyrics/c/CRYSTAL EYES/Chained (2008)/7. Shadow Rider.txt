Beyond the rainbow
where the seas are burning
bells of fate and fortune toll
Heed the warning of the shadow rider

On the fields of honour the battle has begun
Men of war are claiming their rights
Fighting under banners to the bitter end
Unaware of my guarding eye

[Chorus:]
I'm the lord of the fallen
The great beholder of Life and Death
I'm the lord of the fallen
The one who follows you night and day
When your time is running out
and the angels call your name
I'll be waiting beyond the grave

Hunting at the border in the name of God
Holy knights with blood on their hands
Blinded by the promise of the afterlife
They are all welcomed to my land

[Chorus]
[Solo Paul, Dahl]

Oooh Oooh I'm the shadow rider
Oooh Oooh I'm the shadow rider
Yeeeeeeah
I'm the shadow rider
and I'm coming for you
