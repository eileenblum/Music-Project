Don't wait for your salvation to arise
The undying winter never leaves the mind
Black is the path I wander
Black are the clouds I'm under
The uncertain future echoes in the dark

[Pre Chorus:]
Welcome to the castle of the damned
Come inside and listen to God's hymn to my life

[Chorus:]
Scarlet blood of the angels are falling down
when my shadow is dancing on the lonely ball of fate
Saddened clouds of oblivion conceal the sun
when my shadow is dancing on the lonely ball of fate

Don't look beyond the border of your life
The enchanting window always fools the eye
Bound to the never changing
sound of the raven's black wings
We all wear the thorny crown until the end

[Pre Chorus:]
Welcome to the final masquerade
Come inside and see the abject symphony play

[Chorus]
[Solo Paul, Dahl]

[Bridge:]
Learning to die from my requiem
I'm learning to die from my requiem
Learning to die from my requiem
I'm learning to die from my requiem

[Chorus]
