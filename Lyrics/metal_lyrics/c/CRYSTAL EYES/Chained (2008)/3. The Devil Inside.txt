Are you ready?

Welcome the night. Put your worries away
Leave the sirens for a while
Enter the quiet and mysterious place
Let the silence roll the dice

[Pre Chorus:]
A shadow never lies
We stand on the edge of the world
The gate is open wide
And out of the dark he crawls
right into your mind

[Chorus:]
Don't wait for the devil tonight
You're a midnight dreamer
Don't wait for the devil tonight
You're a midnight dreamer
The devil inside

Into the eyes of the fire he breathes
Like a whisper of your fate
Ready to strike on the hour of dreams
when the light has gone away

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Solo Dahl]

Don't wait for the devil tonight
You're a midnight dreamer
Don't wait for the devil tonight
You're a midnight dreamer
Don't wait for the devil tonight
You're a midnight dreamer

Don't wait for the devil
Don't wait - Don't wait for the devil
You are the devil inside
