Countdown! The time is right
We got a final war to fight
On the road again
We're blood bound. We're dynamite

Rise up! It's do or die
There's only one way to survive
Ride against the wind
and don't stop for anyone

[Pre Chorus:]
Lightning, thunder
They can't break our storm asunder
Aiming higher, it's here and now

[Chorus:]
Keep on fighting - Never back down or surrender
Keep on fighting - Tell the world you're alive
Keep on fighting - You were born to rock forever
Keep on fighting - There is no compromise

Breakout! It's time to burn
We've heard the call. There's no return
Leave the past behind
and fly straight into the sun

Stand proud and hold your gun
The revolution has begun
There's a world to win
so don't stop until you've won

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Solo Paul, Dahl]

[Bridge:]
All of the time, keeping the fight alive, all of the time
Aaaah Aaaah! Keeping the fight alive until we die

[Chorus]
...there's no compromise
