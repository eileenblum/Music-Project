Welcome to earth,
A circus where the clowns are in control
Welcome to life,
A state of hysteria programmed in your soul

Don't talk, don't think,
Don't feel, stay out of the way
Just be glad and grateful
For your soon ending days

We are all the chosen ones
Dressed up for God's masquerade
Without a stage and audience
We dance the fool's ballet

There's justice for all
Behind the beautiful but false facade
Here women and men,
Young and old are playing the great mortal's charade

Don't talk, don't think,
Don't feel, stay out of the way
Just be glad and grateful
For your soon ending days

We are all the chosen ones
Dressed up for God's masquerade
Without a stage and audience
We dance the fool's ballet

Almighty father, thank you for all
The fun and excitement on your great ball
No matter what you have planned for us
We'll perform until we fall

We are all the chosen ones
Dressed up for God's masquerade
Without a stage and audience
We dance the fool's ballet
