My life is a bloody mess
To my body I have no access
I know what is right, but I'm not in charge
I can't let go of the knife
That I just have raised to end your life
One more awful crime to torture my mind

Let me out. Let me out of here
I just can't take it no longer
Let me go, and leave me alone
Before I go insane

Born to run, and follow the sight
Of despair, chaos and fright
Desperate taking soul after soul
I'm out of control
In panic I am damned to live my life

My actions are not of my will,
But they seem to give my brain a thrill
I can not resist my heinous slaughter
I'm caught in a mad machine
Destruction and death are all I've seen
How can I escape this hellish nightmare?

Let me out. Let me out of here
I just can't take it no longer
Let me go, and leave me alone
Before I go insane

Born to run, and follow the sight
Of despair, chaos and fright
Desperate taking soul after soul
I'm out of control

Born to run, and follow the sight
Of despair, chaos and fright
Desperate taking soul after soul
I'm out of control
In panic I am damned to live my life
