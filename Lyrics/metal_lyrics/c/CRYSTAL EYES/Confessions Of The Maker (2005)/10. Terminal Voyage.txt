A cold and endless void of glimmering bright souls I see
Drifting around our sad and mundane reality

An astral plane filled with strange harmony
Where the dead march on, through infinity
But I don't know where they go
No one's come back to tell me the truth

Have you ever wondered what's beyond
Your terrestrial life and corporal bonds?
Have you ever pondered on what's out there,
When your life is over and finished here?
The greatest mystery of all

On golden rays of light. On shining silvery beams
Ethereal beings float in beautiful glittering streams

Dancing slowly towards the unknown
To a place our Maker has shown?
Well, I don't know where they go
No one's come back to tell me the truth

Have you ever wondered what's beyond
Your terrestrial life and corporal bonds?
Have you ever pondered on what's out there,
When your life is over and finished here?
The greatest mystery of all

All these souls, like a billion fires,
Illuminate the void as life expires
But like grains of sand they are blown astray
On a terminal voyage
On a terminal voyage they sail
On a terminal voyage they sail away
