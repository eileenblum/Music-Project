Another day to fight for my unspoken rights
How can you say it's worth the price
You pay in a cage of lies?

Another chapter in the daily book if sin
Here I'm supposed to walk along
A path which I know is wrong

You may say I aim too high,
But I know what I have to do
I can't see the reason why
The old dream should not come true

Out of the void
Against the wind of madness
Into tomorrow I sail with my hope
No time to waste
I'm heading for the future
I'll carry on till I finally reach
My burning vision

Tired of being the prey and always hearing them say
You can not raise a family
Lost in a fantasy

Detested by the fools who never break a rule
But their eternal jealousy
Won't change my destiny

You may say I aim too high,
But I know what I have to do
I can't see the reason why
The old dream should not come true

Out of the void
Against the wind of madness
Into tomorrow I sail with my hope
No time to waste
I'm heading for the future
I'll carry on till I finally reach
My burning vision

When dreams and memories collide
I'll be leaving for the final ride
Just like the wind I'll travel across the seas
Under skies of glory I will fly, forever free
Laughing at the pain in my past

Out of the void
Against the wind of madness
Into tomorrow I sail with my hope
No time to waste
I'm heading for the future
I'll carry on till I finally reach
My burning vision
