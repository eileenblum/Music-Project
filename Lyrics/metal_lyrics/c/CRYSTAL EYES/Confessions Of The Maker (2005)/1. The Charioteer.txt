From the plains of power
Whine the last stormy winds
For the guardian of Midgard
A final journey begins

By Odin's side
With the aesir gods behind,
A distant voice enters his mind

Lord of the sky, you're running out of time
The serpent will poison your sublime
Thunder and lightning may have dyed your blood
But you can't escape the twilight of the gods

With the hammer you have crushed
All who stood in your way
But strength and deity
Won't help you on the final day

As chaos reigns
And the Valkyries sing,
A warning is sent only for him

Lord of the sky, you're running out of time
The serpent will poison your sublime
Thunder and lightning may have dyed your blood
But you can't escape the twilight of the gods

Lord of the sky, you're running out of time
The serpent will poison your sublime
Thunder and lightning may have dyed your blood
But you can't escape the twilight of the gods

Charioteer - You're a warrior without peer
Charioteer - But your grandeur will end right here
Charioteer - Charioteer - You're a warrior without peer
Charioteer - Charioteer - But your grandeur will end right here
