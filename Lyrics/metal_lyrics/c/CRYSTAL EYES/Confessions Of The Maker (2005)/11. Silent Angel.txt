Lies, empty words in the wind
A tragic melody
Unwise is the one who believe in tomorrow

The shade of a loser never fades away
Until the story ends
But there is a light where I lonely stray
And the light is you my friend

Silent angel from above
Take me on your wings of love
Fly me far away from here
Show me the way to the silence

Free is the one with a name
Carved in a tombstone
Tell me, am I the one to blame for my life?

The pain is eternal when I realise,
All my thoughts were true
There's neither a Heaven nor a paradise
All I can believe is in you

Silent angel from above
Take me on your wings of love
Fly me far away from here
Show me the way to the silence

I see her face in the crowds,
The darkness and the clouds
I'll wait for her until
I find eternal tranquillity

Silent angel from above
Take me on your wings of love
Fly me far away from here
Show me the way to the silence
