Rain - A million tears to the ground
Wind - The unmistakable sound of war

The rebellion has begun
Our freedom must be won
To the castle of tyranny we ride

Tear down the walls
Hunt the King out of his halls
Dethrone the One and we'll be in command

What ever we'll meet,
We won't surrender nor retreat
Freedom we claim to the Shadowland

No more lies. Let the crown of the tyrant fall
It's the final battle of the Shadowland
Glory days and peace are waiting for us all
It's the revolution of the Shadowland

Fight for all the painful years
When all we felt was fear
Drawn by insurrection we will prevail

Closer we come
Now we know what's to be done
The message we have for his majesty
Die tonight!

No more lies. Let the crown of the tyrant fall
It's the final battle of the Shadowland
Glory days and peace are waiting for us all
It's the revolution of the Shadowland

Rebels of the brave
Never loose your faith
Let us end it all tonight
Hold on to your hearts and fight

No more lies. Let the crown of the tyrant fall
It's the final battle of the Shadowland
Glory days and peace are waiting for us all
It's the revolution of the Shadowland

Shadowland
Shadowland
Shadowland
