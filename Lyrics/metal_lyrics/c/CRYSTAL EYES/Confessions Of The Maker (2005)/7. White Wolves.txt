The day of our revenge is dawning with a chilling haze
Like the day we fell from grace
It was a shameful black day when our bravery failed
But today valour shall prevail

Under the rising sun the mist of the morning clears,
Revealing a forest of spears
A loathsome crawling mass of filth, roaring with bloodlust
Well, this time they will be crushed
Charge!

The thunder of pounding hooves below
Heralds the doom of our foes
Like thunder we descend upon our prey
For our shame they will pay

Might and honour
Now we shall restore our tarnished name and pride
Might and valour
Once again the White Company of Wolves rides
Into battle and war

With the sound of horns and the rumbling roll of drums
We attack the tainted scum
Shouting war cries like howling wolves we ride down the slope
Our hearts filled with fierce joy and hope

No more shall we have to feel the infamous bitter pain,
Or bow our heads in shame
By death or victory our honour shall be restored
So, in the name of our Lord
Charge!

The thunder of pounding hooves below
Heralds the doom of our foes
Like thunder we descend upon our prey
For our shame they will pay

Might and honour
Now we shall restore our tarnished name and pride
Might and valour
Once again the White Company of Wolves rides
Into battle and war

With fury singing in our veins
We smite our fallen leader's bane
Our hammers are smashing a gory
Path to redemption and sweet glory

Might and honour
Now we shall restore our tarnished name and pride
Might and valour
Once again the White Company of Wolves rides
Into battle and war

Into battle and war
