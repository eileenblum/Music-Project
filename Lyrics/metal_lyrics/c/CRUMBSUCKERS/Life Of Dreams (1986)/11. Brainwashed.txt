You Jesus freaks are all the same
Cashing in by using his name
So much reform and so many views
Sounds like you're really confused
I think you should all get the axe
For spreading all of your shit
The flame should be extinguished now
Before another candle is lit

Run away from life
Religion's all you've got
I don't really care
If you were born again or not
Born with a belief
Never told I'm right
Don't need brainwashed people
Telling me to see the light

Spend all your life
Awaiting your turn
I was born with a belief
But you had to learn
Or did you believe
Before the book was fed to you
You never knew

Born again, born to see
Blind by faith, your eyes tell me

Spend all your life
Awaiting your turn
Heretic to me
I guess you should burn
Or did you believe
Before the book was fed to you
You never knew

Born again, born to see
Blind by faith, your eyes tell me

Spend all your life
Awaiting your turn
Heretic to me
I guess you should burn
Or did you believe
Before the book was fed to you
You never knew
