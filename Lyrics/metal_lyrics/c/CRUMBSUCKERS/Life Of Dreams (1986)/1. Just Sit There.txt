Sit there
Sit there
Sit there
Sit there

Sit there and let destruction take its course
Sit there and let nothing occupy your mind
But I know that there's something left inside
Yes I know what the future will provide

It's up to us to fight the war
As Ronnie screws up more and more
But he don't care his life is past
It's up to us to make things last

Sit there and let destruction take its course
Sit there and let nothing occupy your mind
But I know that there's something left inside
Yes I know what the future will provide

Brainwashed by hates and fears
Jeopardizing precious years
Fancy cars and diamond rings
For this they live the life of kings

Sit there
