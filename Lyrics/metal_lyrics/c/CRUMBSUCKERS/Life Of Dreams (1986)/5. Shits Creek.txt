Life's going fine till it's time to pay
Then nobody cares about what you say
Borrowing all the time
Now you're in debt
Money's fun to spend
You bet

My arms are short and my pockets deep
And all the money that I have I want to keep
I'll be making my payments over time
That was long ago, now the lender whines

Moving down the river of life
Make your payments grab a wife
Then you try and float upstream
It's much harder than it seems
Finally you make your goal
With no morals and no soul
Had to sell them on the way
So that you could live today

You're up shits creek
Installment due last week
Your bank book is looking bleak
Because you're up shits creek

Travelling without a paddle
For so long it doesn't matter
Now you're in a new tax bracket
Don't forget your life jacket
And if you hit some waves
That's alright money saves
But if your cash flow stops
Will your life crumble and drop

You're up shits creek
Installment due last week
Your bank book is looking bleak
Because you're up shits creek

That's because you're up shits creek

Now your debts are paid
And you can relax
You've got shit in your ears
Or is it wax
I thought I saw your boat capsize
Bobbing in the creek
Getting shit in your eyes
