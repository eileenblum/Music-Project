Woke up today
Where did I find myself
Stuck in a world
With room for no one else

Way, way back when
Not that much was expected from you
Now you ask how
How come society molds you to the shell
Why must I justify
Everything that I do
You aren't through
Until you see me climbing those walls

The world that you're born into
You didn't make
But that's what you're stuck with
And now that's your fate
The urge has surfaced
To crawl back inside
The fetal position
So now you can hide
Nice, warm and dark
Surrounded by flesh
Don't want to come out
The world's such a mess
The urge has surfaced
To crawl back inside
The fetal position
So now you can hide

Turn back time
Return to the womb
Turn back time
Return to the womb

Way, way back when
Not that much was expected from you
Now you ask how
How come society molds you to the shell
Why must I justify
Everything that I do
You aren't through
Until you see me climbing those walls
