Why am I always stuck for words
Pressure's on and I'm all clammed up
Hatred boiling without being heard
You have the balls to tell me shut up

Always act like you're so concerned
Say you care, but I know you don't
I feel it inside
And when we talk we don't say a word
What is this?
A waste of time?

I guess it's true apathy prevails
I don't care, never did and never will
There are times I need something to wail
And other times
It's you I just want to kill

You fucked me up
Now you'll fuck me over
Tactful ways, I barely noticed
And when we talk
We don't say a word
What is this?

Trapped
By your godly divineness
Trapped
And there's no escape
Trapped
Shall I call you your highness
Trapped
And I can't get away

Trapped
By your godly divineness
Trapped
And there's no escape
Trapped
Shall I call you your highness
Trapped
And I can't get away

Why am I always stuck for words
Pressure's on and I'm all clammed up
Hatred boiling without being heard
You have the balls to tell me shut up

Always act like you're so concerned
Say you care, but I know you don't
I feel it inside
And when we talk we don't say a word
Why the fuck did I waste me time?

Trapped
