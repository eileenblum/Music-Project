Election day is coming near
You get to pick the one you fear
Mondale, Hart or Jessie J.
They won't stick to what they say

Sorry Ron it's time to go
Back to acting with Bonzo

Who you pick, it makes no matter
We eat their shit and they get fatter
He gets to live in the White House
With his dog, his cat and spouse

Sorry Ron it's time to go
Back to acting with Bonzo

He'll take chauffeured limos
Go cruising through the ghettos
He'll state his mind with double think
Because his ideas really stink

Election day is coming near
You get to pick the one you fear
Mondale, Hart or Jessie J.
They won't stick to what they say

Sorry Ron it's time to go
Back to acting with Bonzo
