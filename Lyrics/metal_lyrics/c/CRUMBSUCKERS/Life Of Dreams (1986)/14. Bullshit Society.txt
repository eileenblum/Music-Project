This world is full of it
Everywhere from everyone
And even those that should know better
Try to have some bullshit fun
No matter how well you know someone
They will try to burn your head
Who's right, who's wrong
Until your friendship is dead

It's so true
It's a bullshit society
It's so true
It's a bullshit society
It's so true
It's a bullshit society
It's so true

I think the parents are the best
With all their experience
Johnny it won't hurt a bit
As he rams the needle up your ass
The bullshit keeps your ego
So high above the clouds
Your head gets so fuckin' big
You think so highly of yourself

It's so true
It's a bullshit society
It's so true
It's a bullshit society
It's so true
It's a bullshit society
It's so true

This world is full of it
You see it everywhere from everyone
And even those that should know better
Try to have some bullshit fun
No matter how well you know someone
They will try to burn your head
Who's right, who's wrong
Until your fuckin' friendship is dead

It's so true
It's a bullshit society
It's so true
It's a bullshit society
It's so true
It's a bullshit society
It's so true

The bullshit keeps your ego
So high above the clouds
Your head gets so fuckin' big
You think so highly of yourself

It's so true
It's a bullshit society
It's so true
It's a bullshit society
It's so true
It's a bullshit society
It's so true
