Survival of the fittest
Who also have the money
It's hard for us
Who don't have much
To eat when we are hungry

No work to do
Or school to go
Nothing to eat
This life is beat

Could always grub
But not every day
I don't want to have to steal
I know that's not the way

No work to do
Or school to go
Nothing to eat
This life is beat

Tell me get a job
Work until you're dead
These are the ideas they
Drill in your head

Could always grub
But not every day
I don't want to have to steal
I know that's not the way

No work to do
Or school to go
Nothing to eat
This life is beat

Survival of the fittest

Drill in your head

Tell me get a job
Work until you're dead
These are the ideas they
Drill in your head
