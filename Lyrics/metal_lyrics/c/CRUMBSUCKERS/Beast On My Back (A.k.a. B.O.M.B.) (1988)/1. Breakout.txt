Murder, death, pain
Tears of frustration 
Danger lurking everywhere
Destroying our nation
Problems everyday
Generate forever
Anxiety's steady note
Is now a screech of terror 

Child alcoholics
Fathers raping daughters 
Madness in the family
Illness and disorders
Medicine that kills
Food that cuts the throat 
Innocent people murdered
While malicious madmen gloat

Panic invades the safety of our home
Shiver 'neath your covers
You feel you're not alone
Images of fear cause an icy frission
Chilled to the bone by a bloody vision

Panic invades the safety of our home
Shiver 'neath your covers
You feel you're not alone
Images of fear cause an icy frission
Chilled to the bone by a bloody vision

It seems the world has gone mad
Value of life distorted
Murder, death, pain, rape, and drugs
Are the things the papers have reported 

Breakout, breakout
Breakout, hell on earth
Breakout, breakout
Breakout, (from this) hell on earth

Evil abounds but we can surely flee
No need to live under the dread of a sick society
Rebuking what is vile, living in the light
Protection from destruction
We're always in his sight
Protection from destruction
That wasteth at noonday
Man may kill the body
The soul he can't take away
Safety in the refuge
At the right hand we must fall
And those who wage against us
Shall be nothing at all, at all

Breakout!
