House of God burnt to the ground
Many feel it's for the best
Associates of the holy one
Cannot put their lust to rest

Contamination of the pure
People cringe at the sound
Glory turns into shame
Obstructions block the glory bound

Hypocrite, what have you done?
Threaten lives of everyone

Mortal man claims messiah
Saying "I am He"
Wolf in sheep's clothing 
Deadly with deceit

Mortal man claims messiah
Saying "I am He"
Wolf in sheep's clothing 
Deadly with deceit

Why...did I believe?
Ears deafened to the call
False prophet claims the fall

Foolish men prophesize
With visions, visions in their eyes
Wayward child full of lies
Leads the weak to their demise
Foolish men prophesize
With visions, visions in their eyes

Hypocrite, what have you done?
Threaten lives of everyone

Messiah I am He
I'm deadly with deceit
No image to be seen
I am He
