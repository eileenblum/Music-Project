Today's a new day
Time to put the plan to work
Generate the new way
I hope it works
Gotta kick the habit
Put the old man to rest
Worldliness, well I've had it
Think you're getting more
But you're getting less
Got to take your problems
Drop them in the sea
The charges are behind you
You've done the time
And now you're free

People try to bring us down 
We don't need their kind around
Rejuvenation can still be found
Don't need no one to keep you tied
Or keep you bound

Start today, it's not too late
Rejuvenate
Make a change, no time to wait
Rejuvenate 
No big deal, you made a few wrong moves
Try again
Don't give up, things'll start to groove
Try again
Right Now!

Again problems start coming down
Deal with one and another one's found
Back in the ring for another round
You knew it was coming
You knock it down, knock it down

Again problems start coming down
Deal with one and another one's found
Back in the ring for another round
You knew it was coming
You knock it down

Rejuvenation today
Do it now!
