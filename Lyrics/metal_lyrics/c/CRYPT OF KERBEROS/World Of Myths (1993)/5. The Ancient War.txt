As the bells rings
the battle here begins
smoke and blasts
mighty wizards lying in waste.
Crushing for the masters.
Whose names can't be spoken

In these ruins of a dying world
the warriors storms with a coven of Khorne

Into the battle made by war god's.
For these god's I swing my sword.
Into the battle made by war god's
I sacrifice my soul.

In thses ruins of destruction
I bring this world hate and destruction
