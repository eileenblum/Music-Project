God's of storm
on my kness I pray,
spear my life.
Your existence I don't deny

I can see your anger
make the sky crumble,
and mighty bolts strike
followed by thunder

thunder of hatred,
hatred of the stormlords
"upon the altar of war
I sacrifice the enemy to the over lords"

Beyond the cyclone of insanity
a place where wreckage covers the battlefield
God's of storm
on my knees I pray,
spear my life.
Your existence I don't deny

"Upon the altar of war
I sacrifice the enemy..."
