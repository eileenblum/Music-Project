Dropped into the middle of fire,
Don't know where to run, where to hide, where to pray
Drowned in deep fear
When the bullets fly above your head

Afraid of the merciless fight
You can hardly breathe, you feel someone's coming
Forgiving denied
Slaughter's waiting

No one knows if it's the worst nightmare
Or is this the pure reality
When you feel warm blood of your body
Then you have lost your humanity

Staring at the horizon
Your heart is bleeding, you're crying, you can't prevent
"You're men made of iron!!"
These are cheap lies your leader once said

Feeling sick of this senseless fight
You can hardly breathe you feel everything's fading
Death has arrived
Hell is waiting

No one knows if it's the worst nightmare
Or is this the pure reality
When you feel warm blood of your body
Then you have lost your humanity

No one knows if it's the worst nightmare
Or is this the pure reality
When you feel warm blood of your body
Then you have lost your humanity
