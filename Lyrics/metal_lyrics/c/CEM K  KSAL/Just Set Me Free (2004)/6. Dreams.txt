Today I felt I'm living with my fears
Weariness is turning to my tears
Yesterday has gone
I cannot carry more
What if I begin to disappear

Sometimes I feel I was in a cage
Sometimes I feel I could turn that page
I was never on this way
Life changed it someway
But I have to make my dreams come true

What if I can not
My life will be gone with defection away

Dreams!
We have to build more
Dreams!
For what we've been born
Dreams!
We can not let them go
Dreams!
Don't let them been torn

What if I can not
My life will be gone with defection away

Dreams!
We have to build more
Dreams!
For what we've been born
Dreams!
We can not let them go
Dreams!
Don't let them been torn
