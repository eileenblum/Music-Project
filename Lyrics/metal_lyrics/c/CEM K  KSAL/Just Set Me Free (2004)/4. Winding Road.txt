There you stood all night long
You've got a bad temptation
First time you touched and you sealed my heart
Beyond imagination
I thought you were only one
Maybe it's true
I felt you were chosen one
And I tried
And hoped
I've found my way
Having you was what I want to
Deep in my heart
I was scared
I've chosen winding road

You said it was self defence
I know honesty was my fault
There was one single chance
I was sure
It's hard so hard
I thought you were only one
But it's not true
I felt you were chosen one
Because I was so fool
I've lost my way
Loving you was what I had to
Deep in your heart
I was blamed
That's not the love
What I've done has satisfied you
Deep in my heart
I was fair
We've chosen winding road
