The life it seems to be undefined
Possesses you
Holds you down in the dark

The winds of the dawn are still too far
"Life" torments you
Makes you cry in the night

Is there anybody listening?
Or are you alone?

The dream of achievement keeps you alive
Supports you
Pulls you up from the dark

The wings of freedom get you above all
They hold you
'till the sun gets so high

Is there anybody listening?
Or are you alone?
