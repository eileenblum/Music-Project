You are washing dry blood of your hands
You have waited so long for the revenge
At the mirror a blank face
Time to see you will be deranged
Time to see you are going down
Trying to be free
No!
Your wound will never heal

Blood on blood, blood on blood
Don't let the evil be your inspiration
Blood on blood, blood on blood
Don't let him lead you to wrong destination

Blood on blood, blood on blood
Don't let the evil be your inspiration

The cruel hunt will begin again
The vengeance will torture your soul everyday
Hold on tight or you will faint
Time to see you will be dead in the end
Time to see you are going down
Trying to be free
No!
Your wound will never heal

Blood on blood, blood on blood!
Don't let the evil be your inspiration
Blood on blood, blood on blood!
Don't let him lead you to wrong destination
Blood on blood, blood on blood!
Don't let the evil be your inspiration
No!
