Blood soaked on the ground
I hear the thunder sound
Mercy cannot be found
The coliseum roars

This is your scorn
This is your bones tored
This is your blood flows
This is the fall of Rome

I, Barbarian
I, Barbarian

Devils come out to fight
Surrender or survive
Under the black sky
Can you stay alive?

Prepare to meet your maker
Disguised asunder taker
Don't break the final oath
Murder your soul at dawn

I, Barbarian
I, Barbarian

Kill at will...
Will to kill...
Kill to thrill...
Thrill to kill...

Kill...
Kill...
Kill...
Kill...
Kill...
