The crucible...
The crucible...

The tribal begins, hang the witch
Spectral examination, crucial confession
Madness! The floodgates are opened

Salem witch trials 1692
The whole city under voodoo
Witches singing, forest breathing
Slaves chanting and conjuring

Wonders of the invisible world
The devil wash is servant
Indians conversing with demons
The September Executions

Burn the crucible, burn
Burn the crucible, burn

Weird, wild chill in the night
Possessed by evil spirits they rise
Witchcraft signs shows in the sky
Abigail lies, John proctor's deny

With wings of a fallen angel
More than ordinary affliction
Shining city on the hill
Conspiracy machinery in motion

Burn the crucible, burn
Burn the crucible, burn

The crucible...
The crucible...

I won't sing this confession
I will die for my actions
I won't sign this confession
Salem burns... Resurrection

The crucible...
