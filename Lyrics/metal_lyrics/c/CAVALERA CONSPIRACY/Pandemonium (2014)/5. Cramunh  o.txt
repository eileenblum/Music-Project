Crashing the gates, Tartar and Hades
Nothing can stop this fight
Burning the world, burning upon
Maximum destruction, it's time

Born from folklore, pure evil
Darkness in tribal form
Attacking the soul, eating the earth
No one escapes the purge...

CramunhÃ£o
CramunhÃ£o

Selling your soul, your black soul
Doesn't belong to you now
Desecration, interrogation
Under my control now

Hypnotic, mandatory
Blind from the inside
Testimony, purgatory
Now you fall from divine

CramunhÃ£o
CramunhÃ£o

Iron threshold
Guardian removed
Stygian dog
Underworld
Hydra heads
Triple jaws
Hungry howl
Cerberus

This is the purge, the great purge
I watch the blood of my wound
Self-inflikt, inflikted
Pain brought to my doom
Darkness approaches, like an empty void
Creature arising
Black magic voodoo noise!

CramunhÃ£o
CramunhÃ£o
