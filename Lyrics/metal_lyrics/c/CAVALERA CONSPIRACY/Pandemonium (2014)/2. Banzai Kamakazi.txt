Thrash!!!

Emperor
Not for you
I undertake
This suicide
Gazing upwards
Dream is empty
Violence boils
In your stomach

Bonzai Kamikazee
Bonzai suicide

Special attack
Are now falling
Subduer of demons
Evoking evil
My body is a shell
I'm taking it off
Put on the glory
That never wears off

Bonzai kamikazee
Bonzai suicide

Thrash!!!

Blossom the wind
Fallen country
Why did you?
Have to die?
We will bloom again
Into the shrine
Zero fighter
Suicide

Bonzai suicide

Kamikazi suicide
Kamikaze suicide
