Now, I'm losing my mind
I'm losing th grip
I'm burning inside

Now, the edge of the knife
I'm walking the line
They come from behind

Now, face the demons
Fight the demons
Fight 'til I die

Now, I'm selling my soul
I'm out of control
Where will I go?

Not, not losing the edge...
Not, not losing the edge...

Forgive them father for they don't know what they do
Protect me father, but I must go to face this horror alone
This is divine I feel alive, I have a reason to fight
But on the edge do not look down, they're all around

Not, not losing the edge...
Not, not losing the edge...

They come from behind, they coming from behind
Hiding in the dark, they're hiding in the dark
They are all around, they are all around
Rising underground, rising underground
They're everywhere, they aren't prepared
Crawling on the edge, crawling on the edge
Leaning on the ledge, leaning on the ledge
C'mon motherfuckers! I ain't coming back
Never, never, never, never!

Now is the end, the end of the line, the end of all life
The age of distrust corruption is rust, spiral downward in dust
Control your feeling, control your temper, lock them down deep inside
Unleash fear, release the demon, a plague mankind

Not, not losing the edge...
Not, not losing the edge...
