You can be seen the predator's delight
Enjoy the fear in your prey's eyes
Settling to unleash your savage might
As the helpless before you lies

No chance is there for captivity nor fight
For mercy with your heart has no ties
No particular target to apply it
It works either each way you denied it

Apex predator apex
Apex predator apex

Only one response to the carnivore
On wings feathered with holy terror
Down the throat, the only action
Momentary lapse of perception

Apex predator apex
Apex predator apex
