Spreading lies, spreading gossip
From your mouth, only garbage
Propaganda mind control
Your false world will crawl upon

Father of hate
Father of lies

Illusion master, lies spreader
Reality, for you don't matter
You feed on hate, you feed on lies
Your blank face, is your disguise

Father of hate
Father of lies

You are Salieri, against Mozart
From your envy, hatred grows
You're a thief, you're a robber
None of this, was ever yours

Father of hate
Father of lies

Traitor... Judas... Liar... Scum...
