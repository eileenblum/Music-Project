You must kill - another body killed
We must kill - another blood is spilled
You must kill - another soul is ill
We must kill - another life killed
We must kill - another deadly sin
You must kill - another orphan land
We must kill - another atrocity
You must kill - another misery
You must kill - and blood will follow
We must kill - there's no tomorrow
You must kill - death will follow
We must kill - there's no tomorrow
Judgment - torment - execution
You must kill - this is not a drill
We must kill - this is for real
You must kill - another body ill
You must kill - another blood is spilled
Judgment - torment - execution
Um, dois, treis, quatro...
Must kill...
