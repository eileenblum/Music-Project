Loaded with dynamite
I don't give a fuck
'cause everybody die tonight
Call me negative, call me what you want
You are nothing
Never was, never will

My hostility
My sanctuary
My reality
My sanctuary

Underground

Coming with a storm
You wish you never born
Fucked up reality
I'll take your soul and blame my seed

My hostility
My sanctuary
My reality
My sanctuary

Underground

No excuses, no regrets
Everybody die tonight
Everybody die tonight

No division, no solitary
Everybody die tonight
Everybody die tonight

Sanctuary, sanctuary
Everybody die tonight
Everybody die tonight

Sanctuary, sanctuary
Everybody die tonight
Everybody die tonight
