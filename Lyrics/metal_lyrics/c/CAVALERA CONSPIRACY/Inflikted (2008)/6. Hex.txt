Like a hex, you see the bullet
Through the chest, no turning back
Like a hex, you feel the bullet
Don't expect, your life ends fast

Like a hex, like a hex
Mass hypnosis will equal death
Like a hex, a fucking trap
Buffalo soldiers high on crack

Like a hex / the whole population under attack
Like a hex / mass hysteria equals death
Like a hex / the whole population under attack
Like a hex / mass hysteria equals death

Like a hex / your trend is dying fast
Like a hex / you go down like the rest...
Like a hex / your trend is dying fast
Like a hex / you go down like the rest...
