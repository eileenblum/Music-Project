Born
From dust
In the gutters of this earth
Maggots
And leppers
Is this hell or is this heaven?
The cursed
The damned
Spreading hate across the land
No more
Pretending
Destroy your seeds of envy!
Unleash
The wicked
This hate in self-inflikted
Deliver
This torment
Upon your final judgement
Follow
The storm
In the land of no return
It's you
The scum
We'll kill until it's done!

[Chorus (4x):]
Inflikted
Show no mercy
Motherfucking wicked

Fallen
And burning
Execution now is coming
Corruption is the sign
And destruction of your lies

[Chorus (4x):]
Inflikted
Show no mercy
Motherfucking wicked

Nobody moves
Nobody gets hurt
Nobody moves
Nobody gets hurt
Nobody moves
Nobody gets hurt
Nobody moves
Nobody gets hurt
Nobody moves
Nobody gets hurt
Nobody moves
Nobody gets hurt
Nobody moves
Nobody gets hurt
Nobody moves
Nobody gets hurt
IN-FLIK-TED!
IN-FLIK-TED!
