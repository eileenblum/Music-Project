I'll be the end and the beginning
I'll be the soul without fear
I'll be the tower of strength
I'll be the last breath of fate
I'll be the grain of sand
I'll be the soul untamed
I'll be the seeds of your soul
I'll be the sacred lost scrolls
Impaled heads and tortured souls
Under the sign of the black ark
Sacrifice the bastard's sons
Under the sign of the black ark

Whoever the fuck you are
Under the sign of the black ark
Wherever the fuck you come from
Under the sign of the black ark
Here's this new day
When we'll stand up
Fight for our lives
We must go on
Learn from our past
We can forgive
What you have done
We must go on
We're not who you think we are
Under the sign of the black void
Whatever you are, we are against it
Between the sun and the dust
The spirits I call, they come to life now
Feels like the march of doom
Taking me down where our lives end
Like born dead inside the womb
Here's this new day
When we'll stand up
Fight for our lives
We must go on
Learn from our past
We can forgive
What you have done
We must go on
Inside the womb...
You're not who you think you are
Womb....
Hostility...
Between the sun and the dust
Feels like the march of doom
