Rise... From Siberia he rises
Monk... Whose visions of the future will be told

Soon... His fame reaches out to the throne
Aid... To the Czar's son will come down

Revolution â it soon comes
Revolution â red comes down
Stab, poison, shot, drown
Stab, poison, shot, drown

Revolution â The Czar is gone
Revolution â Monarchy's done
Stab, poison, shot, drown
Stab, poison, shot, drown

Curse... He told the Czar about the curse
Plague... It will plague them if undone..

Revolution...
