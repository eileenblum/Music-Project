When I was young they murdered my father
He was betrayed and drank the poison
My mother was raped and killed in the vilage
Destroy into ruins they came to pillage

It is done â born of fire
I've become â warrior son
What's done is done â soul avenger
I've become â the chosen one

I was captured and I became a slave
The old prophet saw me and game my name
'Genhis Khan' he screamed at the sky
He say my future, my vengence will rise

It is done â born of fire
I've become â warrior son
What's done is done â soul avenger
I've become â the chosen one

Kill for kill â his blood I will spill
Kill for kill â I kill for the thrill
Kill for kill â I vengeance the few
Kill for kill â His blood I will feel

In Mongol country I ride with my brothers
I'm getting closer the hour
And now my sword I hold on your throat
Remember my father as I spill your blood

It is done â born of fire
I've become â warrior son
What's done is done â soul avenger
I've become â the chosen one
