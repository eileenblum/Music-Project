I'm hurricane
I've been betrayed
Locked in a cage
And now i speak hate..
It was murder
Done by the orders
Blame on me
And now i learn to hate..

I was a prize fighter
I hit them harder
But this is war
And now i speak hate..
Fighting for my pride
Fighting for my life
Fighting to survive
And now i speak hate..

Hatred, killing
Killing the hate, killing the hate..
hatred, killing
Killing the hate, killing the hate..

I speak hate â do you understand ? I speak hate
I speak hate â do you understand ? I speak hate
I speak hate â can't you understand ? I speak hate
I speak hate â can't you understand ? I speak hate

When I was in prison
I refused to be
Treated like and animal
And now I speak hate
in solitary
They throw my body
Total solitude
And now I speak hate..

I am a monster
Rejected by the world
A menace to society
And now I speak hate..
Fighting for my pride
Fighting for my life
Fighting to survive
And now I speak hate..

Hatred, killing
Killing the hate, killing the hate..
Hatred, killing
Killing the hate, killing the hate..

I speak hate â do you understand ? I speak hate
I speak hate â do you understand ? I speak hate
I speak hate â can't you understand ? I speak hate
I speak hate â can't you understand ? I speak hate

I speak the language of hate
You won't misunderstand me
I speak the language of hate
I'll make you understand me..

Speak.. Hate..
