Thrasher â Master of disaster
Thrasher â faster and faster
Thrasher â in this disaster
Thrasher â forward thrasher

Our legions growing through the world
What we started â you cannot control
We're taking over one and all
United we can never fall

Now it's on â you can't control
Now it's on â against the world
Now it's on â we are the ones
Now it's on â the chosen ones

Thrasher â I'm the aggressor
Thrasher â never say never
Thrasher â the killing weather
Thrasher â against the oppressor

We come to take over your soul
Against the world is blood for blood
No one can tell us where to go
We're everywhere and now it's on

Now it's on â you can't control
Now it's on â against the world
Now it's on â we are the ones
Now it's on â the chosen ones

The chosen ones..

Now it's on â you can't control
Now it's on â against the world
Now it's on â we are the ones
Now it's on â the chosen ones
