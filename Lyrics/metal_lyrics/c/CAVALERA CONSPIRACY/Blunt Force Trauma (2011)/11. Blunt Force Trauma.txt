Blunt force trauma
Find anger we danger
Blow to the head
Destroy the liars

Blunt force trauma
Treatment fall
Bulldozer
Decimate destroy

[Chorus]
Blunt force trauma
[x4]

Chaos lover
Arise the disorder
Destroyer
Kill without order

Blunt force trauma
Violence disorder
Suicide bomber
Now you in a coma

Blunt force trauma
[x4]

Yeah!

Capillaries burst inside your brain
When you feel this pain
You'll go insane
And now you bleed 'till you bleed out
Suffer the pain
As your body drops out
