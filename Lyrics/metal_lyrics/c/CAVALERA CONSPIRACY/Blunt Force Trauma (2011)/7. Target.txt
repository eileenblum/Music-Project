Face...
With all your hate
With all your strength
Look at them down

Stare...
Into their eyes
Inside their mind
A targe you'll find

I'll bring you down â you are target
I'll find you â you are my target
Now you are mine â you are my target
I'll take you down â you are my target

Strength...
Looking for you
Who against who
I'll find you too
Crush...
All the oppenents
All those agains us
Against the wall

I'll bring you down â you are target
I'll find you â you are my target
Now you're minde â you're my target
I'll take you down â you're my target

Who agains, who against
I'm coming now for you
Who against, who against
Exterminating you

Exterminating you
Exterminating you

Exterminating you.. I'll bring you down,
I'll bring you down
Exterminating you.. I'll bring you down,
I'll bring you down
Exterminating you..
