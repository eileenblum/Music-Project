Justice by us, revenge is a bitch
Now's the time to deal with it
Where the system fails we now prevail
Your innocence is my retribution
Eye for an eye, street justice
In my mind
Now's the time to face your lies
You took her life, destroyed her dreams
Her sufffering will be avenged

Vengeance is mine â Lynch mob
Your day has arrived â Lynch mob
Justice is now â Lynch mob
Judgemen is served

Street cleaner is my name
My justice will be my way
I removed the scum of the earth
Intervention is on its way
Now you face your judgement day

Vengeance is mine â Lynch mob
Your day has arrived â Lynch mob
Justice is now â Lynch mob
Judgement is served

The lynch mob arrives- justified
Your sick and criminal mind must be â crucified

Vengeance is mine â Lynch mob
Your day has arrived â Lynch mob
Justice is now â Lynch mob
Judgemen is served
