Down here inside the walls of death nobody can hear your
screams but me who the fuck are you to judge me I am just
killing a bastard that deserves to die For what you did there
is no price and you will pay with your fucking life There is
no excuse for your crimes you will feel the pain equal to a
thousand deaths I knock you out from the face of the earth
I will give you an overdose of my most painful cure Time after
time I see myself die, what a spectacular sight my sweet end of
life You may think I have no conscience, but mine is as clean
as ice, when I strike for the first time you're bound to die
