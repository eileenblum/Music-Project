Smashed my head into the cold concrete I tried to tear myself apart overheated mind,
there's nothing more to gain you revel in my rage, you want to see me insane Let me
throw away the pain, let me bleed to death let my soul burn, you know I never learn
how to reject my inner thoughts So secret, so silent, so confused living my life
without a cause take away my life flame please let me die I tried to stay alive for
too long my furious mind was all set on fire so quiet on the outside, total hell
inside no more rebel, no more fuzz
