We'll meet in hell, you and I wide-open wounds since the last time you want to
be an icon you want to be jesus christ revenge, your blood is mine see yourself
burn to death now look into my eyes of fire endless pain is yet to come Maimed,
your limbs torn apart and still you refuse a lethal-injection you've got a knife
in your throat, and a nail through your spine you'll be a son of god, baptized
in fire You had it coming, now your time is out pure fucking pleasure, as I
remove your face no rush job of torture, just maximum pain totally worn out in
a few days Brought to you by someone below Well, I was born in hell I'm the captor
of your soul you start losing blood, your life decays
