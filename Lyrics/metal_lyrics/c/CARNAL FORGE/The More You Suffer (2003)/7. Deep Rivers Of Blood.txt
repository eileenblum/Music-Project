Your last day on earth, what do you do? you think about all the shit we put you
thru, you say you don't care but I know that's not the deal, out with your rage
I know how you feel Today is the day, your last day on earth Today is the day,
the last day on earth They didn't see it coming, they couldn't read the signs
they refused to hear the sound of doom judgement day is calling, we're all guilty
as charged we will drown, in the deep rivers of blood It's time to act, stab wounds
in their back, eye for an eye, time to die, time to pay they should have stayed
away, denying their great loss, no regrets just one day left
