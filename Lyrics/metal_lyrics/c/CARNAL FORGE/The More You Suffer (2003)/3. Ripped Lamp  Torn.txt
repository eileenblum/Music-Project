Prepare yourself, for a violent day I ride into the unknown
you are drifting away from your soul it's about time to take
you home a thousand crossroads in your life, just a million
different ways to die I've been sick of my life since ages ago
I'm bored to death, it's time to go Welcome all my nightmares
Ripped and torn my life feels so unreal Ripped and torn time
for me to beg for mercy Ripped and torn time for me to get
Ripped and torn Time to meet the man, now dive into the rivers
of sin, let the evil have it's way it's too late, no escape
