Let the final genocide begin evil against evil
nobody wins a higher conciousness does it exist?
business made out of human flesh talking about your
revolution not acting at all, not caring at all
One more broken soul, one more down Hell blood fire,
we burn our victims alive Hell blood fire, I won't resist,
I won't get back Hell blood fire, we burn our victims alive
Hell blood fire, I'll deny my life, suicide!!! I wish I was
dead, but I can't get rid of my dream my body pumped
full with lead, and then I would be your hero I got god
in my heart, I got satan in my mind cruel, cruel world
go away, make them disappear Mass extinction, abomination,
torture and war no relief, no light at all
