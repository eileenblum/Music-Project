Are you scared of yourself? Hiding your feelings, suppressing your hate,
denying your wish to die, locked up mind, so afraid of the fire Paralyzed,
choked on greed, co-existence in war A diehard bloodbath in your heart,
a wounded soul, can't take no more, your life hangs so loose Turn your back
against life, say good-bye and enjoy the light never to come back, never
to return You can feel the pain of the universe, your curse just won't go
away Facing death without dignity, you've been punished for your sins over
and over again
