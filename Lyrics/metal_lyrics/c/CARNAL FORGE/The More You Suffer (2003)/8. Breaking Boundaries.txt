I can't believe what I am hearing you make my ears bleed so bad I can see
right thru your lies I stay and listen to what you are saying: just empty
words, made up stuff from your fantasy worlds, I got eyes, with them I can
see thru just about anything So far, so good, say what? - you're just acting
like a fucking fool So far, so good, say what? - I will deliver, I will
maintain I'm sane enough to make my own decisions, don't need any rules
I have my own, and I break them time after time a mad dog in progress
fulfilling my life I've been on the right track since day one don't need
to change my way of life, not ever gonna stay the same, I will remain
Whatever comes in my way, I embrace it take it with me on my journey thru
life defending yourself with so worn-out cliche's you say you are nothing,
I say you are everything you ever wanted to be You should try to be true
to yourself let your soul and heart guide you don't let your dreams just
be dreams follow the leader: follow your heart Just empty words, made-up
stuff from your fantasy worlds, I've got eyes, with them I can see thru
just about anything don't need to change my way of life, not ever gonna
stay the same, I will remain
