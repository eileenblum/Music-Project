We're marching on to the rhythm of the dead
We're marching on, our hearts pounding with rage
Break those chains,
Kill your fears
Break that curse,
Burn your soul

Crushed by the light,
Slayed by servants of christ
You were left to die by the ones you trust,
Betrayed by life, left to rot
You were left to die by the ones you trust,
Betrayed by life, becoming dust

We're marching on to the rhythm of hate
We're marching on, still beating, killing your fate
We're marching on to the rhythm of the dead
We're marching on, our hearts pounding with rage
Break those chains,
Kill your fears
Break that curse,
Burn your soul

I don't mind the pain or the suffering, just no more life...
You were left to die by the ones you trust,
Betrayed by life, left to rot

They achieved their goals, soon it all will be gone,
Just a burning surface covering the earth
You were left to die by the ones you trust
Betrayed by life, left to rot
You were left to die by the ones you trust
Betrayed by life, becoming dust
