You depend on the power of your soul,
Alone in the darkness turning to trash
The world falls down on you
Everything is black,
Your inner flame no longer burning,
No lust for life, never high,
Your outdated mind out of order since years ago,
You may just die

Watch yourself go dead
Desecrated, forever falling
You'll never be reborn

You used to have a life
But you lost it all,
Your powers are gone
Just like your soul,
You used to trust and care,
Now it's only your pain who is there,
You tried to escape from your life in Hell,
You tried to run away from your fears

Watch yourself go dead
Desecrated, forever falling
You'll never be reborn

I'll be the one to cast the first stone
I'll be the one who releases Hell

You depend on the power of your soul,
Alone in the darkness turning to trash
The world falls down on you
Everything is black,
Your inner flame no longer burning,
No lust for life, never high,
Your outdated mind out of order since years ago,
You may just die

Watch yourself go dead
Desecrated, forever falling
You'll never be reborn
