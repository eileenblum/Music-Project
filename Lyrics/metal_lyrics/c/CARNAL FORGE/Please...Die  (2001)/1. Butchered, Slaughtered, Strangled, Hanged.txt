Heading towards the lungs of Hell,
I'm the spirit and flesh of lucifer
I'm the one who enters your mind,
I'm greater than death, on wings of evil I ride
I steal your soul, I empty your veins, your blood is life,
Your blood is my source

You see my name written in blood,
You see the sign:  No way out!
Get ready to die my friend, butchered, slaughtered, strangled, hanged
Enter the domain between life and death,
Brutal torture lies ahead
First I cut your fucking face off then straight to the acid bath

Midnight, I am turning into the devil...
Midnight, Hell has arrived
Midnight, my skin is melting,
As I am becoming pure evil

When I have released all my demons,
My vengeance is done,
The arrival of the end has come.
Bow for the almighty slayer of doom,
The end of the world is soon

Heading towards the lungs of Hell,
I'm the spirit and flesh of Lucifer

Midnight, I am turning into the devil...

Midnight, my skin is melting,
As I am becoming pure evil

When I have released all my demons,
My vengeance is done,
The arrival of the end has come.
Bow for the almighty slayer of doom,
The end of the world is soon
