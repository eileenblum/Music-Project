Pure steaming terror, five decades of decadence,
The throne has been conquered, divine power unleashed,
With iron and chaos, I turn the land into glory
Victory requires bloodshed, Spawned is the immortal elite

Totalitarian torture so sweet

Welcom to a living nightmare, where your life becomes unreal
Throw away your hopes and dreams, I will feed your needs
The weak and the useless, will be wiped out and forgotten
Obey me or face the reality, enemies will be blown into infinity

I spread fear - I rape, ruin and desecrate,
I spit venom - totalitarian torture so sweet

The masses shall follow their leader, praise the new world order
Disgrace, misery and anguish, a call for the new messiah

Down on your knees and pray, it's time for shotgun salvation
Come forth the brigade of cruelty,
Extinction in the name of the cross

Welcome to a living nightmare, where your life becomes unreal
Throw away your hopes and dreams, I will feed your needs
With iron will and chaos, I turn the land into glory
Take my hand and follow me, and forever dwell in insanity

I spread fear - I rape, ruin and desecrate
I spit venom - totalitarian torture so sweet

The masses shall follow their leader, praise the new world order
Disgrace, misery and anguish, a call for the new messiah,
Down on your knees and pray
