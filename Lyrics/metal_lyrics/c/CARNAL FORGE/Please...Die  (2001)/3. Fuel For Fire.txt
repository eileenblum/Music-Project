Tormented bodies everywhere, awaiting the end of the world
There's nothing here to save, the time is running out, with no mercy

Enter the black dimension, a hole in time and space
No Heaven or Hell awaits you,
Just close your eyes and float away ... (NOW)

Burn me, if i'm too blind to see this scam
Burn me, my sick desire, please turn me into fuel for the fire

Life's a mistake, filled with psychical pain
There's no escape we're leaving today

I'm just fuel for fire

Enter the black dimension, a hole in time and space
No Heaven or Hell awaits you,
Just close your eyes and float away ... (NOW)

Burn me, if i'm too blind to see this scam
Burn me, my sick desire, turn me into fuel for the fire

I'm just fuel for fire
