Faster and faster, still not on time, cash is the fuel for every one
Sice that day we were born 'til the day we die,
We learn how to reject a meaning of life

Victims, we are all fucking slaves

Raping unknown lands, destroying the life of millions,
Corruption is all we know, we are just waiting for the sky to burn

Victims, we are all fucking slaves
Victims, we are all fucking slaves

Cash is the fuel for everyone, cash is the fuel

This is the way it was meant to be, a world so full of hate and greed
I will enjoy watching the earth explode,
Nobody cares that we are living in an open sore
