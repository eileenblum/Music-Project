I'm hunting your shadows,
I fool you with ease,
Can you feel my eyes undressing your mind,
Your soul such an easy prey,
There's nothing that can stop this game
You just wanted a ride,
Now you are blinded by pain...

You can feel me right behind you,
A cold breeze, i'm always there
Your nightmare turns into reality,
I'm back again so hungry for your flesh

Aren't you dead yet?
Please die...
Aren't you dead yet?
So hard to kill

You're facing the eyes of death,
You're heading towards Hell

Your destiny I hold in my hand,
Your future,
What an awful sight
Soon you'll be gone

Your soul such an easy prey,
There's nothing that can stop this game
You just wanted a ride,
Now you are blinded by pain...

Aren't you dead yet?
Please Die...
Aren't you dead yet?
So hard to kill

Please Die...
