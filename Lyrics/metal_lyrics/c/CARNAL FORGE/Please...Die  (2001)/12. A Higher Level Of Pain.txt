The smell of your fear, a fucking decease
Don't be scared I kill you with ease

One cut and you're gone,
I wanna stab, I wanna hear you moan
Your wounds not too deep, just enough to put you into sleep

Your time is out, now you're gonna kiss the goat
The slaughter will succeed, now it's time for you to bleed

One cut and you're gone,
I wanna stab, I wanna hear you moan
Your wounds not too deep, just enough to put you into sleep

Unconscious for days, now it's time to execute the kill
Never ending torture, a higher level of pain
