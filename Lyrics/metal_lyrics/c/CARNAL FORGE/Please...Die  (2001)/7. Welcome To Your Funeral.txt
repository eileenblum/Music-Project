The power of the kingdom of death unleashes its rage upon you
My vengeance soon to be unfold
Your life in torture flashes before my eyes, you will feel my hate,
You will feel my burning rage entering your domain

Death is real,
Life's deceased

Pray your way down to Hell,
The secrets of the bleeding night unveils itself
My wrath i've spawned for centuries, the lust for blood is my call,
You can never make me bleed, i'm above all life

Welcome to your funeral,
Today you'll be buried alive

Feel its nerve, haunting your soul
Feel its rage, dominating your veins
(Feel my rage dominating your veins, you'll be buried alive)

Welcome to the mass, feel your soul, feel it slipping away

Death is real,
Life's deceased
