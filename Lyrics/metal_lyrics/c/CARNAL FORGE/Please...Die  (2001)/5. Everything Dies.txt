All you have left is a wish to die and all you see is black
Your tortured soul cries out for a relief

You can't go on like this, you'll hit the wall, scared to death

I gave you life, I trashed your wall of self-defense
Now you have nothing, only the fear remains

The fear of dying, your long gone disease
Everything dies, rises and fades away again

Sacrifice, you paid your dues with your own blood
Everything dies, you took your life just like you knew I would
Crucified, nailed like christ, no sacrifice, everything dies

All you have left is a wish to die and all you see is black
Your tortured soul cries out for a relief

Now you are hanging in a rope, cold and naked,
A few seconds away from Hell,
Finally your life is gone, at last your spirit is home,
There's nothing you can do
There's nothing left, just black holes

Sacrifice, you paid your dues with your own blood
Everything dies, you took your life just like you knew I would
Crucified, nailed like christ, no sacrifice, everything dies
