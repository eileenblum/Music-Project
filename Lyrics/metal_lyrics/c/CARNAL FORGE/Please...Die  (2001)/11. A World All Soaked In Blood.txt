Casualties, the world turns evil when you lose
Blind, my eyes are filled with blood
Execute, this world of myths we've built
Strangled it, hacked it to pieces, fucking pieces

Destroyed, eaten alive by my own fears
Drained, all my views of life erased

Wounds that will never heal
Tortured, i'm chained inside the crypt
Burning the future an ocean of fire

A world all soaked in blood
