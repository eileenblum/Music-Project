Peel the skin right off my bones
Take me to the other side where I belong
Burn me alive, I do not care
I will stand for my beliefs to the grave
I trust no one, never had no regrets
The evil burns inside my veins
One more victim on my killing spree
Justifies all the insanity

Enormous amounts of blood to be shed
In the sign of evil I rule
Lay his head on the table and watch me attack
Huge skull-crushing hammer against his head

My guilt all washed away
I hear your screams blowing through my bones
You are awake through the whole torture
Some call it life, some call it hell

Praise the arrival of the apocalypse
Blood pouring down from the sky
Hail the Armageddon
The powers of hell will finally reign
You are standing in line just waiting to die
Soon you'll be forgotten 
Mo one will hear your cries of pain

Peel the skin right off my bones
Take me to the other side where I belong
Burn me alive, I do not care
I will stand for my beliefs to the grave
Enormous amounts of blood to be shed
In the sign of evil I rule
Lay his head on the table and watch me attack
Huge skull-crushing hammer against his head

My guilt all washed away
I hear your screams blowing through my bones
You are awake through the whole torture
Some call it life, some call it hell.
Your eyes are popping out, veins explode
Now watch all your fears as they're becoming your reality

Praise the arrival of the apocalypse
Blood pouring down from the sky
Hail the Armageddon
The powers of hell will finally reign
You are standing in line just waiting to die
Soon you'll be forgotten 
No one will hear your cries of pain

Murders in the past seem like nothing in comparison to this slaughter
of the world
You are all sinners, you are lying to your selves, acting like fucking
rulers of the earth

My guilt all washed away
I hear your screams blowing through my bones
You are awake through the whole torture
Some call it life, some call it hell.
Your eyes are popping out, veins explode
Now watch all your fears as they're becoming your reality

Praise the arrival of the apocalypse
Blood pouring down from the sky
Hail the Armageddon
The powers of hell will finally reign
You are standing in line just waiting to die
Soon you'll be forgotten 
No one will hear your cries of pain
