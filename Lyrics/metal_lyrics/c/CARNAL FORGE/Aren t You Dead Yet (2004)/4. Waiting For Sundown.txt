Leave the world domination to me
Whatever you're looking for, look somewhere else
I have to take it all, and killing you is the best way to get there

Always hiding from the daylight, at war with the sun
And you know that I am the fallen one

DESTINY MADE ME IMMORTAL
I'M JUST WAITING FOR THE SUN TO COME DOWN

This warrior will change the world's rituals
Still hung up about what you had and lost
Stay right where you are
You've waited long enough to get that killing blow

Always hiding from the daylight, at war with the sun
And you know that I am the fallen one

DESTINY MADE ME IMMORTAL
I'M JUST WAITING FOR THE SUN TO COME DOWN

It must be tiring on your soul
T know that you'll never find shelter
Where is your fire, where is your anger
You have lost it all

I'm on a path that I can't change, I know it and I accept it
If living is so much better than dying, then show me the way:

Always hiding from the daylight, at war with the sun
And you know that I am the fallen one

DESTINY MADE ME IMMORTAL
I'M JUST WAITING FOR THE SUN TO COME DOWN

Always hiding from the daylight, at war with the sun
And you know that I am the fallen one
