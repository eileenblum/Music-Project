I'm drifting through life without any goals
Blindfolded fool, in my heart there's a hole
I've looked everywhere but I can't find the real me
The righteous one, the one I always wanted to be

In my dreams I'm all covered in blood
Beaten to death, lying in the mud
If I died tonight it would be such a relief
My soul would finally be free

To a blood-filled sky or down below, that's where I belong
For I have lied, and I have sinned and I have killed your dream

Sleepless nights turn into years
Decades of despair
All hope is gone since years ago
Almighty god bring me home

Unconscious for the last time in my life
I hate it! Time to lie down and die
Let the darkness take me home
A beautiful end of my totally wasted life

To a blood-filled sky or down below, that's where I belong
For I have lied, and I have sinned and I have killed your dream

Sleepless nights turn into years
Decades of despair
All hope is gone since years ago
Almighty god bring me home
