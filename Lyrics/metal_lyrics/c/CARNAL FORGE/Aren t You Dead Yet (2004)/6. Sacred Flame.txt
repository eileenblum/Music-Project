I am reaching out for the flames
I want to feel them burn deep within
The fire is out since a long time ago
Bring me down, take me out
Piles of dead bodies everywhere I look
A massive slaughter taking place.
We are all tied up 
Waiting for our last breath
Death lies awake just around the corner

The blood we have taken
The blood we stole was not in vain 
It will kill us all
Thrown into the deepest hole
Where we will burn forever more.

I hope the blizzard will take us soon
We are doomed
A war zone in my heart
Heal the world in a nuclear attack
I hope the blizzard will take us soon
We are doomed
A war zone in my heart
Finally we have been doomed

My whole life I have lived in chains
Never saw the light
Never met god
Never understood the meaning of life
It passed away before my eyes

The blood we have taken
The blood we stole was not in vain 
It will kill us all
Thrown into the deepest hole
Where we will burn forever more.

I hope the blizzard will take us soon
We are doomed
A war zone in my heart
Heal the world in a nuclear attack
I hope the blizzard will take us soon
We are doomed
A war zone in my heart
Finally we have been doomed

The truth, I always left it untold 
To save my own precious skin
Always hated humanity so bad
Just wanted the world to pass away

The blood we have taken
The blood we stole was not in vain 
It will kill us all
Thrown into the deepest hole
Where we will burn forever more.

I hope the blizzard will take us soon
We are doomed
A war zone in my heart
Heal the world in a nuclear attack
I hope the blizzard will take us soon
We are doomed
A war zone in my heart
Finally we have been doomed
