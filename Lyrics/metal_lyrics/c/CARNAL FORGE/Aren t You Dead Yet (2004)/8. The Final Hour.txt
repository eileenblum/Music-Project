Set your mind on zero, refuse the light 
You could be a hero and rule the night
Now your heart is so vulnerable
Your soul is an open wound
So attack the source with power and might

It used to be like a desperate fight 
Just to stay alive
Now you just pray that you have what it takes
To come over to the other side

The final hour in hell

Lead your sacrificial lambs to the horde
You won't feel any guilt as you leave this world
It fades the pain, leaves all the lies unspoken
You will feel no regrets as you enter the final hour

It used to be like a desperate fight 
Just to stay alive
Now you just pray that you have what it takes
To come over to the other side

The final hour in hell

All your sins vanished from the face of the earth
Embrace the darkness that lies ahead
No more nightmares, no more downs
Just sit back and enjoy your last journey in life

It fades the pain, leaves all the lies unspoken
You will feel no regrets as you enter the final hour

It used to be like a desperate fight 
Just to stay alive
Now you just pray that you have what it takes
To come over to the other side

The final hour in hell
