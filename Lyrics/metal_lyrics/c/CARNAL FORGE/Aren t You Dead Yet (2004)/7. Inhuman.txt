All my weakness has disappeared
My spirit now feels so whole
See the stars shining for the world
Hear the wind dying to be heard
Unlock my chains
Set me off to freedom
Let all my sins turn into stone
Let my blood be so pure this time

I will find the source of human life and destroy it
I will put an end to all the lies

Reborn as a master, no longer a slave
Everything's different and I will never be betrayed
I've got an everlasting fire burning for me
It purifies my soul

I will find the source of human life and destroy it
I will put an end to all the lies

I will compute the kill! INHUMAN

All my weakness has disappeared
My spirit now feels so whole
See the stars shining for the world
Hear the wind dying to be heard
Take me to the river where I once drowned
Let my eyes see so clear this time.
Let all my sins turn into stone
Let my blood be pure 

I will find the source of human life and destroy it
I will put an end to all the lies
INHUMAN

I will compute the kill! INHUMAN
