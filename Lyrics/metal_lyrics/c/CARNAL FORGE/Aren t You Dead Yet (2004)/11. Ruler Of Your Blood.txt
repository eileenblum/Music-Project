[Japanese bonus track]

I received a message from the unknown
An invitation from the depths of hell 
I see jaws of steel cutting through me
Leads me into pain, leads me out of the light

Your soul is already dead, born into a prison
Trapped in hell, you've become my main target

You're my slave, I rule your blood
You're my saviour, I am your god
I will never wipe the slate clean with you
I will never set you free

Desires too strong to resist
You're fooling the blind, you'll never fool me
I know what you're up to, bring forth your vicious plans
And I will forever be your worst enemy!

Your soul is already dead, born into a prison
Trapped in hell, you've become my main target

You're my slave, I rule your blood
You're my saviour, I am your god
I will never wipe the slate clean with you
I will never set you free

Crying your tears of blood, now try to stay alive
It's all in vain you'll see, it's time to know enemy
Your end is soon to be and I will never set you free

Your soul is already dead, born into a prison
Trapped in hell, you've become my main target

You're my slave, I rule your blood
You're my saviour, I am your god
I will never wipe the slate clean with you
I will never set you free
