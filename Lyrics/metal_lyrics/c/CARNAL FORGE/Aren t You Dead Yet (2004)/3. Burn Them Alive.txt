So loaded with anger, so filled with rage
Time for revolution 
You are out for blood.
Crush the power
You will never feel free in this slavery system.

We are digging our own graves 
In the gutter we will stay
Until we heed out in war,
Against the global powers we will reign. 

Cut of the power by their knees 
Grab your knives and bring the ropes
Tie them up, shoot their veins full with the shit they are selling
Tear apart their smiling faces and burn them alive. 

Nailed up on crosses
Buried naked and alive
Nailed up on crosses
Hanging high soon all bled dry

They have taken away all your human rights
Giving away your blood, selling your soul and mind to god
They steal your blood and try to bring you down to the place
Where all life ends

Cut of the power by their knees
Grab your knives and bring the ropes
Tie them up, shoot their veins full with the shit they are selling
Tear apart their smiling faces and burn them alive. 

Nailed up on crosses
Buried naked and alive
Nailed up on crosses
Hanging high soon all bled dry

They steal your blood and try to bring you down to the place
Where all life ends

Cut of the power by their knees
Grab your knives and bring the ropes 
Tie them up, shoot their veins full with the shit they are selling
Tear apart their smiling faces and burn them alive. 

Nailed up on crosses
Buried naked and alive
Nailed up on crosses
Hanging high soon all bled dry
