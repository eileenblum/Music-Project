Hate Breeds Hate, And I Like To Watch It Go
Restless Souls Rule The World With Their Bare Hands

I Feel No Fear As I Face The Gun
I Pulled The Trigger, You Lost I Won

How Can You Say It's A Sacrifice
When Your Life's Your Enemy

Slave To Your Own Restraint
The Obsessions Of Carnal Lust 
You Want To Close The Circle
But The Only Way To Get There
Is To Get Out
Die

You Try To Fight It Year After Year
You Know It Was Meant To Be
Your Life Is Your Enemy

Pull The Trigger
Pull The Trigger
Pull The Trigger
Pull The Trigger

Pull The Trigger, Take A Shot Or Two
I Pulled The Trigger Not You
