You Know What I Do With Liars - Your Word Against Me
Fist
The Torture Never Stops - Another Lie, Pain, Pain, 
I'm A Total Disaster But You're Even Worse
I Will Go On Til You Fucking Rot

Give Me The Key To Your Heart
Let Me Tear You Apart

Your Outfit So True, Too Bad It Wasn't You
I'm In Possession Of A Fucking Bullet
Kneel For Your Rotten Soul

Give Me The Key To Your Heart
Let Me Tear You Apart
Give Me The Key To Your Heart
And I'll Give You Hellter Skullter

The Torture Will Never Stop
The Torture Will Never Stop
Your Rolling Head, So Worn Out
Your Maggot-Eaten Body, So Worthless

I Got A Problem With Your Running Mouth
So Easy To Hurt You, And That's What I'll Do
I'm In Possession Of A Fucking Bullet
Kneel For Your Rotten Soul
