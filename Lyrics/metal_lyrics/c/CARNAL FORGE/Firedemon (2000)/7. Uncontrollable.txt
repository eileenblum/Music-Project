You Can Try To Stop Me, Get In My Way
But There's No Way You Can Beat Me
No Use To Even Try

The Fear In Your Eyes Is What Keeps Me Alive

You Look Good In My Distorted Eyes
Your Ripped Up Body, Burned And Out

A Pure And Holy Ripped Apart Soul

This Threat Is Real [x4]

You Tried To Deny Me, You Tried To Control Me
Come A Little Closer, And You're Soon To Be Dead
Your Fear Shines Thru Brighter Then Ever
You Thought You Knew Me, But Now It's Way Too Late

So Now Keep Your Distance, Stay Away From Me
Or I Smash You Into The Fucking Asphalt...
