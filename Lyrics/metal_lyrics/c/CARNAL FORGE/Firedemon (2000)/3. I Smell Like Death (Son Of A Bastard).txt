Brought To Earth With Hell In My Blood
Unreal Powers I Release, I Raise The Flag Of Hate
Just To Let You Know That Your Time Is Gone

Son Of A Bastard, Purgatory Awaits

Pain Is Gonna Come To You
Faster Than A Sweeping Bullet
Your Fear Shines Through So Bright
When You Look Into My Burning Eyes...

I Smell Like Death
I Breathe Destruction
The Power At My Fingers
Will Turn You Into Fucking Dust
