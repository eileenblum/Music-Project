There's No Solution, Only Revolution
There's No Salvation, Crack The Face Of Power

Tear Them Apart 

There's No Surrender, Time To Hate That Fucker
Burst, Burst My Friend, And Things Will Never
Be The Same Again

Wreck It, Slam It, Kill It, Bring It To The Dead
Smash And Burn, A Revel In Violence

Burning Heads In Fusion, Bestial Liars
Tormenting Your Soul, Now It's Your Turn
Just Go 

Smash And Burn [x4]

I Can't See Your Face, It Makes Me See Too Red
I Hate To Hate You, But I Can't Help Myself
I Want Your Head In My Hand

I Wanna See You Ripped In Pieces, Totally Sliced

There's No Solution Only Revolution
There's No Solution, Upside-Down Execution
