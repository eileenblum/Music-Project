You Know I'm Always Hungry For Some Kicks
So You Better Watch Your Back Or I Just Might Slip
My Fists Are Shaking And I Can Smell Your Fear
It Doesn't Matter Who You Are
You'll Bleed, Then You'll Become A Scar 

Let Me Erase Your Mind
Let Me Take Your Soul
Let Me Put Your Life To Rest

If You Take A Look Into My Black Glowing Eyes
And All You Can See Is A Glimpse Of Yourself
Sometimes It's So Hard To Choose, Slow Or Fast
But You'll All Get A Chance To Feel The Pain Of Hell

Let Me Erase Your Mind
Let Me Take Your Soul
Let Me Put Your Life To Rest
Let Me Erase Your Mind
Let Me Revel On Your Soul
Let Me Take You To The Depths Of Hell

There's No End Where There's Nothing At All
But Your Light Is Out, Down To Hell We Go
