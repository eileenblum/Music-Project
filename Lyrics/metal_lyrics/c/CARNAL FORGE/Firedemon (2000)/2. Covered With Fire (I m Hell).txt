You're So Sick But You're Not Too Much
Don't Worry, You Are Not Alone
Now I Got You, We're Ready To Crush
I Can't Slow Down, Fuck Slow Down, Do It!
Cut Yourself Up, Slice Your Arm Into Fucking Pieces
Watch Your Blood Cover The Wall, Do It!
I Command You To Burst Into Pieces

I Want To Cover You In Fire
You're Doomed To Die In Hell, And I'm In Hell

In The Darkest Part Of The Human Brain
You'll Meet Your Creator, 
I Sure Would Like To Join You, But I'm Already Dead

Come On, Don't Be Scared 
But I Do Eat Fear, And I Puke Fire

Now When You're All Covered In Fire
You Can Join Me In This Bastard Feast
But When You're In, You Can Never Get Out
You Have To Obey And I Know You Will
