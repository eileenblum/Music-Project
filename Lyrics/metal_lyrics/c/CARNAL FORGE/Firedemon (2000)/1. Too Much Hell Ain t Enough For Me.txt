Smashed By The Face Of Truth
Obsessed By A Lust To Kill
Cursed By The Unholy Demon
Destined To Rule The Earth

Nothing Slips By Me
Nothing's Gonna Ever Change
I See Right Thru You
And That's One Reason To Go Ahead
And Skin Your Soul

Too Much Hell, Too Much Pain
But Too Much Hell Ain't Enough For Me

You Can Not Create Such A Creature 
That Feeds On Evil Like I Do

Got The Power To Desecrate
To Execute Whatever Comes In My Way
I Got To Fill My Needs
That's Why I Do My Dirty Deeds
Threshold Of Pain Is Not Far Away
So Open Your Eyes If You Dare
And Watch The Beauty Of A Total Slaughter
