Total Destruction Is Coming Your Way
Get Down Get Down No Use To Pray
Just Get The Hell Out Of Here Cause I'm Coming
God Knows That I'm Coming

You've Got A Nail In Your Head And An Axe Thru Your
Face
So Just Let It Burn, Just Let It Burn
Let Me Out, Let Me Burn

Cause I Am The Firedemon

Firedemon [x7]

You're Heading Towards The Throne Of Hate
You're Hitting The Wall In The Nest Of Torture
Your Body Filled With Broken Glass
You're Surrounded By Fire

And Still You're Not Bleeding, Not A Scratch
You've Got The Devil In Your Flesh, You've Got Me
Inside Your Veins
So Just Let It Burn, Just Let It Burn
Let Me Out, Let Me Burn
