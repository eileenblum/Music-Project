Kill Yourself If You Feel Remorse
Kill Yourself If It's Too Hard To Live
But If You're Still Pissed Off And Mean
And If You've Got That True Hate In Your Veins

Come To Me When You Feel It's Time
No One Will Praise You, Only Your Crime
No Ones Gives A Fuck About You, But Your Deeds
Is What You Really Have In You

Someone's Gotta Pay For Your Mistakes
Don't Hold It Back If It's In You

I Made You This Black
I Dig Your Grave
I Made You This Black
I Stab You In Your Back

I Made You This Black [x10]

You See Your Victims Thru Wide-Open Eyes
Their Fear Shines Thru So Bright
But If You're Still Pissed Off And Mean
And If You've Got That True Hate In Your Veins
You Know Just What To Do
