I Feel The Power Of Hell Once Again
I Can't Deny It, I Can't Resist
I Can No Longer Escape From My Past
I'm The Chaos Breeding One

I've Got The Venom, It Will Blow Your Mind
I've Got The Cure, The Only One You'll Ever Need
I've Got The Venom, It Will Blow Your Mind
I've Got The Venom, So Step Aside

The Gates Are Open, Towards The End We Go
We Will Bleed, We Will Burn
But My Infernal Soul Lives On

Can You Feel The Power Of Hell, Like I Do?
I Can See The Rage In Your Eyes
But We're Not The Same
I've Got It In My Blood
It Runs Constantly Through My Veins
True Hate, True Rage
