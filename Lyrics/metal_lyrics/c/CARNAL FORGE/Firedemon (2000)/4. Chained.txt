Unbeatable, No Use To Struggle
Brought To Earth With Hell In My Blood
Chainsaw On, Nitro Cutting Through My Spine
I'm Riding With The Dead
I'm Blessed Again

Chained Back In My Hole
Soon To Be Back
Then I Eat It All
Your Bleeding, Your Burning
It's Not Nearly Enough

Intoxicated Morbid With Scratch
You'll All Be Coming With Me
When It's Too Late
I'm Cutting You Up
I'm Making My Point
You Can't Destroy Me
You Can't Fucking Destroy Me

I Revel In Speed And Gore
I Breed Fire In Your Open Sore

The More You Suffer, The More I Get
The Deeper The Wound, The More You'll Pay
No Way Out From This Cryptic Circle
No Way Out, The Race Is On...
