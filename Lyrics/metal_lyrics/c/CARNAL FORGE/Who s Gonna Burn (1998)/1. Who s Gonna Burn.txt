I compute your mind all the time
Creature of destruction love butcher alive
You play it like a fool
But i got the power
I got the tools

You can try to escape from this pit of power
It's payback time
Got a grip on the wire
You stole my world you fucked it up
Now who's gonna burn?

Who's gonna burn

Who's gonna burn

Time to taste and live the pain
Going inside you again and again
I'm your master i'm your hate
I'm the one who rules your fate

I compute your mind all the time
Creature of destruction love butcher alive
You play it like a fool
But i got the power
I got the tools

Bionic
I'm the one
Bionic
Power beyond control
Bionic
Evilize you all
Bionic
Pulling the wire

Time to taste and live the pain
Going inside you again and again
I'm your master i'm your hate
I'm the one who rules your fate

You can try to escape from this pit of power
It's payback time
Got a grip on the wire
You stole my world you fucked it up
Now who's gonna burn?
