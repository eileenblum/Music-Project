I'm inside the lizard i'm living my hell
A pragmatic life under your spell
Gotta have my kicks i can't stop
I'm ready to detonate

Open up
I can take it
Godzilla is coming thru

Fuck your lies i'm proud to live my hell
Feels good to be psychotic every fucking day
I'm sorry but i don't have any limits
Now i have no brakes and you can't stop me

Open up
I can take it
Godzilla is coming thru

I have been forgotten too many times
Denied
Crushed by your lies
I'm in this to run you over
Come on lets all drown in your lies

I have been forgotten too many times
Denied
Crushed by your lies
I'm in this to run you over
Now i'm riding the lizard and you can't stop me

Open up
I can take it
Godzilla is coming thru

I have been forgotten too many times
Denied
Crushed by your lies
I'm in this to run you over
Now i'm riding the lizard and you can't stop me
