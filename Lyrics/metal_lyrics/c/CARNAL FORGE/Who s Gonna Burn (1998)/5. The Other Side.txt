Broken hopes in a world of lies
It makes me blind as it penetrates my eyes
No escape from their morbid minds
Release me from this pain
Release me from this pain

Now i see the other side
Emptiness and despair
Crushed my head into a wall
In a desperate try to die

In a desperate try to die

Just throw you shit into my face
There's no hope for human race
Deny your lies
Deny the truth
Refuse me existence

Now i see the other side
Emptiness and despair
Crushed my head into a wall
In a desperate try to die

Deny your lies
Deny the truth
Refuse me existence

Just throw you shit into my face
There's no hope for human race
Deny your lies
Deny the truth
Refuse me existence

Now i see the other side
Emptiness and despair
Crushed my head into a wall
In a desperate try to die

In a desperate try to die

Broken hopes in a world of lies
It makes me blind as it penetrates my eyes

Now i see the other side
Emptiness and despair
Crushed my head into a wall
In a desperate try to die

Deny your lies
Deny the truth
Refuse me existence
