I crawl deep within my self
I don't bear out with this pain
Why do i only feel hate
Why did you do this to me

You touched my innocent skin
You said it wasn't wrong
But when i close my eyes to sleep
I wish that you would feel my pain

I kill you in my thought
I strangle you in my dreams
You twisted sick fuck
I wish that you will die

You touched my innocent skin
You said it wasn't wrong
But when i close my eyes to sleep
I wish that you would feel my pain

My memories will never fade
They will always be there
What you did to me
I can never forgive

I crawl deep within my self
I don't bear out with this pain
Why do i only feel hate
Why did you do this to me

You touched my innocent skin
You said it wasn't wrong
But when i close my eyes to sleep
I wish that you would feel my pain

My memories will never fade
They will always be there
What you did to me
I can never forgive
