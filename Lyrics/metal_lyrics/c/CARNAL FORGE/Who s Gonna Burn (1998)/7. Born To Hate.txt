I am the pain you feel
As your soul is ripped to pieces
I am all that you fear
Close your eyes and i'll be there

Insanity rules this world
The face of evil is everywhere
I damn the souls of those who rule
I hope you'll die in pain

War for a religious cause
War for a piece of land
War for a religious cause
I was born to hate

I am the pain you feel
As your soul is ripped to pieces
I am all that you fear
Close your eyes and i'll be there

War for a religious cause
War for a piece of land
War for a religious cause
I was born to hate
