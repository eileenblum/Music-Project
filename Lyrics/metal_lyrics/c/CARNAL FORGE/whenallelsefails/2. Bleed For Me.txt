Tied, Bound, Gagged, You belong to me
Kept as an outlet for all my sick fantasies
you're nothing but a commodity
I will use you in every twisted way I please

I will strip you of every shred of humanity
I will have you bleed for me indefinitely

Nothing's ever gonna change
You're born a slave you'll die the same
Death will set you free
Now bleed for me
Nothing's ever gonna change, born a slave you'll die the same
Death will set you free 
Now bleed for me
You're nothing but a thing to me tied down kept gagged and chained
Death will set you free 
Now bleed for me

Kept in secret, Kept in captivity
My personal possessions I call you "family"
I will tell you you're my only one 
But in reality you're just one of many
Just one of many 

I will strip you of every shred of humanity
I will have you bleed for me indefinitely

Nothing's ever gonna change
You're born a slave you'll die the same
Death will set you free
Now bleed for me
Nothing's ever gonna change, born a slave you'll die the same
Death will set you free 
Now bleed for me
You're nothing but a thing to me tied down kept gagged and chained
Death will set you free 
Now bleed for me

Nothing's ever gonna change, born a slave you'll die the same
Death will set you free 
Now bleed for me
You're nothing but a thing to me tied down kept gagged and chained
Death will set you free 
Now bleed for me
