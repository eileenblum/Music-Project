Clinical mutilation
Hacksaw, pliers, knives and assorted power tools
My workstation: a steel table
My mission: To erase all trace of what once was you
Piece by piece, Bit by bit
I won't rest 'til there's nothing fuckin' left of you

The screams still echo in my mind
The pleading and questioning "Why?"

Just fuckin' DIE!

Chemical disincorporation
Sulfuric acid eats away at flesh and into bone
slowly turning what used to be into a slush of putrid goo
There was no room in the plastic tub so I had to make do
By dividing you by two

The screams still echo in my mind
The pleading and questioning "Why?"

Burn, Suffer, Die!
There's nothing to it
Burn, Suffer, Die!
You just had to fuckin'
Burn, Suffer, Die!
There's nothin' to it
Burn, Suffer, Die!
You just had to fuckin' DIE!

Feeling nothing but peace
Feeling nothing but at last I'm free
