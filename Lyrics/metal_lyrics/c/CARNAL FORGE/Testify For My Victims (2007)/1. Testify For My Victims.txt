At peace, unaware, that mask
It's coming off now
Pretend that you're someone else
One you could never be
One they could never tame

Hounds of the haunting greed
Fake your revolution
Will you prophesy another lie
Testify
worlds end
Testify
worlds end

Testify for my victims
Testify for my victims

A greater despair life's pulled from under me
We will not maintain
They are the victims
Scarred by a world where
we're all dying young

Bliss, Unaware it's 'bout time
You woke up. Now!
Can't pretend that you're someone else
You're just as lost as me

This; A declaration of war
My contribution
Which no one will survive
Testify
worlds end

Testify for my victims
Testify for my victims

A greater despair life's pulled from under me
We will not maintain
They are the victims
Scarred of a world where
We're all dying young

We flag with a warning sign this devastation
Torn from a cradle of broken hope
A war torn bastard nation
We, the disgrace, the crown of evil-ution
Befallen from graces, the greatest lie
We're the fallen ones

A greater despair life's pulled from under me
We will not maintain
They are the victims
Scarred of a world where
We're all dying young

...Worlds end

Testify for my victims
Testify for my victims
Testify for my victims
Testify for my victims
