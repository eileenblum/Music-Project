You're self-caged, trapped in your mortal coil
You're empty and void of own thoughts
Mind-fucked, tied up and gagged
This is what you'll be
Raped and rotting slow
The mother sickness, you're yearning to be buried alive, to die
Last thought before your termination
Life's a lie

We burn the flag of our nation
Questioning why, resisting your lies
Your lie, never ending
You rot to the core
We live to die another day

We're reborn, we are as one
We stand as one, you'll fall alone
We're reborn, we are as one
True power:
Strength in numbers
Lost legion march

Reinstate the rulings of a perfect hate
Enslaved by the passings of time
Retrograde into pagancy
This is what you get
Infamy... ...Dominate
No longer being buried alive, it's time to act
Our part: Resist
all power and with open eyes
We'll bring you down

We burn the flag of our nation
Resisting your lie
Never ending
You rot to the core
We live to die another... (day)
We burn the flag of our nation
Questioning why, resisting your lies
Your lie, never ending
You rot to the core
We live to die another day

We're reborn, we are as one
We stand as one, you'll fall alone
We're reborn, we are as one
True power:
Strength in numbers
Lost legion march

It's hard to stay between the lines
Seek the darkness far beyond
We are eternal, feeding on hate
We are the masters and you are the ones that will fade...

Paid per wound, cut their eyes
See the darkness, as I will return
Termination, Confirmation
Self in time

We burn the flag of our nation
Questioning why, resisting your lies
Your lie, never ending
You rot to the core
We live to die another... ( day )
We burn the flag of our nation
Questioning why, resisting your lies
Your lie, never ending
You rot to the core
We live to die another day

We're reborn, we are as one
We stand as one, you'll fall alone
We're reborn, we are as one
True power:
Strength in numbers
Lost legion march
