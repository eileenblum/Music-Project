The deeper the cuts the more alive we feel
Re-enact the trauma of a world where all lies are alike
Honestly, the war inside has won
As I remember the deeds...
You will remember my name

These lies are forming my nation
This hate's much older than time
These wounds are the start of mankind's last lesson
I'm the last in line to rise

Do you believe?
A lifetime deceived
Do you believe?

(End Game)
So let the end game begin
End of all life form
Wipe that slate clean
So let the culling begin
Genocide, one killing at the time

Watch the rise of the end of all

Humanity will never heal
Recognize the signs of old evil slowly grown
Possibly you could have stopped it all
but like picking on scabs...
all you can do is bleed
(All you can do is to bleed)

These lies are forming my nation
This hate's much older than time
Feeding on your self-loath and tear-filled confessions
I'm the last in line to rise

Do you believe?
A lifetime deceived
Do you believe?

(End Game)
So let the end game begin
End of all life form
Wipe that slate clean
So let the culling begin
Genocide, one killing at the time

Watch the rise of the end of all

Soul destroyer, killer of innocence
I'm the downfall of man
The end of all

Do you believe?
A lifetime deceived
Do you believe?

(End Game)
So let the end game begin
End of all life form
Wipe that slate clean
So let the culling begin
Genocide, one killing at the time
End of all
