I'm lashing out, the rage burns a hole in me
Gone insane from the pain that feeds my anxiety
I'm punching holes in the walls caving in on me
Trapped by time and scared to death of life

The evil lives inside of me
I'm lost, without faith
I won't carry the cross they made for thee
so your suffering seem to have been in vain
The question remains...

Hell or heaven? Time to realize
When you're gone, that's it! There's no paradise

I drift through life
All those days they were totally wasted
Everyday exactly the same
I gotta take my chance and break this vicious circle
Face the lie
Despite of the test of faith that lies before me
I'm gonna hate it
but I gotta break these chains

I search within, digging deeper only to find
absolutely nothing
Erratic, insane, I'm nothing but an empty coil
Void of life but still not dead

Hell or heaven? Time to realize
When you're gone, that's it! There's no paradise
The notion of death taking out it's toll
Biological matter, we're just skull and bones

I drift through life
All those days they were totally wasted
Everyday exactly the same
I gotta take my chance and break this vicious circle
Face the lie
Despite of the test of faith that lies before me
I'm gonna hate it
but I gotta break these chains

So what stops the pain?
I think that you will find
This is as good as it will ever get
No matter how hard you pray...
No matter what they say...
...there is only nothing on the other side

Hell or heaven? Time to realize (Time to realize...)
When you're gone, that's it! There's no paradise (There's no paradise...)
The notion of death taking out its toll (...we're just)
Biological matter, we're just skull and bones

I drift through life
All those days they were totally wasted
Everyday exactly the same
I gotta take my chance and break this vicious circle
Face the lie
Despite of the test of faith that lies before me
I'm gonna hate it
but I gotta break these chains
