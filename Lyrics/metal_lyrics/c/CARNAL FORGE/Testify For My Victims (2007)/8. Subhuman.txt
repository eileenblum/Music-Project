Do you see the light, feel your soul slip away
Time has come for pleasure destruction
Do you feel the knife, life in pain is here to stay
Just a void for life's misconstruction

Enjoy the decadence, (praise the hateful kind)
a vulgar deformation of your twisted minds
Destroy all good life, hail the ungrateful kind
Worms of mass conception now all left behind

Just place yourself in line to die, you can't get away

I am god of all, Come follow
I am god of all, Come follow (Follow me down)
Bleed the weak, leave 'em all behind
Crawling like maggots deaf, dumb and blind
Obey God of it all...
Subhuman

Reborn: The symptoms of horror nations
Live to die. If you want to dream...
Live a lie. The worlds ending declaration;
Let 'em down... we're all fucked, to die!
Ruled by incompetence erase the blissful mind
Corruption of the feeble, blind follow blind
Destroyed by the good life
The ghosts of mass confusion all left behind

Just place yourself in line to die, you can't get away
Just place yourself in line to die, you can't get away

I am god of all, Come follow
I am god of all, Come follow (Follow me down)
Bleed the weak, leave 'em all behind
Crawling like maggots deaf, dumb and blind
Obey God of it all...
Subhuman

Just place yourself in line to die, you can't get away
Resist those in power, fall in line for the total war and march out of time
Just place yourself in line to die, you can't get away...
...Just place yourself in line

I am god of all, Come follow
I am god of all, Come follow (Follow me down)
Bleed the weak, leave 'em all behind
Crawling like maggots deaf, dumb and blind
Obey (Obey...) God of it all...
Subhuman
