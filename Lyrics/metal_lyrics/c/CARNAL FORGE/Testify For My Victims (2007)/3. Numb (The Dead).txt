I'm Alone in the darkness
Now, I don't know what it was I thought I'd find
The cuts are getting deeper but still it won't bleed
I'm lost within this: disbelieve
Confusion...
...still my hatred is clear,
When the pain is gone there will be nothing to fear
Choking on life but still I don't care

I'm a nuclear reaction
of devastation
I'm At war with myself
Ripping the life right out of me

I'm losing my grip
My fear turns into anger
I'm losing my grip
Realize I'm not one of the dead

No use in running away, demolition is here
As everything comes to an end my self hate takes control
From myself, within myself
My demons overtake my soul
Kill me now, let me go
The darkness will follow where ever I will go

I'm losing my grip
My fear turns into anger
I'm losing my grip
Realize I'm not one of the dead

Feel the life force leaving me
Body numb, I cannot feel
(Mortality)
Tear apart my rotting senses
No longer alive

Drowning in quicksand
I have no choice but to swallow and drown
Time is slowing down there is no air to breath
I'm lost within myself
...Confusion:
Nothing's clouding my mind
When the pain is gone there will be nothing to fear
choking on life but still I don't care

I'm self mutilation
A devastation
I'm at war with myself...

I'm losing my grip
My fear turns into anger
I'm losing my grip
Realize I'm not one of the dead
................not one the dead!
