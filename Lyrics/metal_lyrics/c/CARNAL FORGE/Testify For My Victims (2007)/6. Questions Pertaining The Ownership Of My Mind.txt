Gather all my sick deeds
And outrun the perfect madness
All are bound by my orders beggin' me to make it ...stop!

Assigned to create the perfect kill
Assigned to create the perfect chaos
A machine in the art that perfects my dominion

Keep praying for a second flood
I lost my faith on my way down
While you're gettin' fucked by God
This hell will be my own

(when I arise)
I will rise ...again!

I got 'em all chased up in my corner
I'll feed 'em with a bit of me
While laughing at their cries I wonder...
will my mind ever be owned by me again?

So far, so good, so fucking what?
Time to erase it all
It's round one and you're all falling
beggin' me to make it ...stop!

Assigned to create
Assigned to create the kills
A machine in the art of total death

I'll try to bleach your blood
Lead the race all the way down
but I won't give up my call
This hell will be my own

(when I arise)
I will rise ...again!

I got 'em all chased up in my corner
I'll feed 'em with a bit of me
While laughing at their cries I wonder...
will my mind ever be owned by me again
Without me knowing got 'em trapped in the corner
I fed 'em with a bit of me
Still laughing at their cries I wonder...
will my mind ever be owned by me again?

It's time to tear it down, erase it all
and this time for ever
It's time to celebrate
this new wave of chaos (chaos, chaos)

We will arise (arise) ...again!

Without me knowing got 'em trapped in the corner
I fed 'em with a bit of me (a bit of me)
Still laughing at their cries I wonder...
Will my mind ever be owned by me again?
Will my mind ever be owned by me again?
