The sound, self-reflected a bloated form my every reaction
Pissed off, fucked up, gone astray
Outcome: let it be! I'm insane

Christ sold, the heavens shall fall
we've abandoned your direction
the great one saved by our enemy action
worldwide devastation

we're free
we got no lights to follow
we have yet to receive the disgrace
we got no lights to follow
affected as some bitter victim
Burn....
affected as some bitter victim
Burn...
A question of falling

You'll pay, freedom only yours by mutilation
My way, your way
We are the cast in this play
You'll pay, freedom only yours by mutilation
the paint of inner beauty's falling again

Pain...
...A Reason, you have to fall
with a badge of degradation
racing for the fun
we'll all get invitations

we'll burn....
we got no lights to follow
we have yet to receive the disgrace
we got no lights to follow
affected as some bitter victim
Burn....

You'll pay, freedom only yours by mutilation
My way, your way
We are the cast in this play
You'll pay, freedom only yours by mutilation
the paint of inner beauty's falling again
we've gone getting dirty of the lies

You'll pay, freedom only yours by mutilation
My way, your way
We are the cast in this play
You'll pay, freedom only yours by mutilation
the paint of inner beauty's falling again
