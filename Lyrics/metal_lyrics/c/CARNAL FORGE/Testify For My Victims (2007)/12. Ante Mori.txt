Wanting so bad to enjoy life to the full
But it seems fear has grip on my being and there's no air to breathe
Slowly suffocating drowning in sand

I will have died knowing nothing
except that once I'm through that door there'll be no turning back

(Ante mori - Momento mori)
Peel the life away from me
Feeling as my world's come undone
(Ante mori - Momento mori)
Peel the life away from me
Slowly learning: All shall die

As I lie down to rest for that last time
I will take my final breath
knowing only truth in life is pain

There's no turning back
It's true as they say...
There's no turning back
At the end of the day...
There's no turning back
One day older and a step closer to death

(Ante mori - Momento mori)
Peel the life away from me
Feeling as my world's come undone
(Ante mori - Momento mori)
Peel the life away from me
Slowly learning: All shall die

Death is in all that lives and she will always win
offering you her cold hand
Look close in the mirror to see her empty grin
Your hour glass is out of sand

I will have died knowing nothing
except that once I'm through that door there'll be no turning back

(Ante mori - Momento mori)
Peel the life away from me
Feeling as my world's come undone
Ante mori - Momento mori)
Peel the life away from me
Slowly learning: All shall die

There's no turning back
It's true as they say
There's no turning back
At the end of the day
There's no turning back
One day older and a step closer to death

(Ante mori - Momento mori)
Peel the life away from me
Turns into nothing
(Ante mori - Momento mori)
Peel the life away from me
Turn me into nothing

(Ante mori - Momento mori)
Peel the life away from me
Feeling as my world's come undone
(Ante mori - Momento mori)
Peel the life away from me
Slowly learning: All shall die

(Ante mori - Momento mori)
Peel the life away from me
Feeling as my world's come undone - Turns into nothing
(Ante mori - Momento mori)
Peel the life away from me
Slowly learning: All shall die - Turn me into nothing
