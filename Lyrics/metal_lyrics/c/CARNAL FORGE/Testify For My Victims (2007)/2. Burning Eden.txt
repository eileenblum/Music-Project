Don't ever patronize me
Keep your dying God
I rule my faith, I'll rise up to rule my world
I'm not the one you left drowned in suffering

Hunt us down, break our spines
Feed us your lies
Our sins are not to be forgiven
Kill us all, condemn our souls
We were created in vain

...No wounds in me
Embedded in death my future lies

All must come to an end
To be reborn in a different time and place
What comes around, goes around...
Everything happens over and over again
My future is colored by the blood red hands of time
Confess your sins try to save your blackened soul
But you know you'll never learn

You've failed to mesmerise me
Your truth isn't mine
I know your shame, I know what's in your past
I'll never be one of you

Hunt us down, break our spines
Feed us your lies
Our sins are not to be forgiven
Kill us all, condemn our souls
We were created insane

...No life in me
Embedded in death my past resides

All must come to an end
To be reborn in a different time and place
What comes around, goes around...
Everything happens over and over again
My future is colored by the blood red hands of time
Confess your sins try to save your blackened soul
But I guess you'll never learn...
Still the gardens of Eden they burn...
...They burn

All must come to an end
To be reborn in a different time and place
What comes around goes around...
Everything happens over and over again
My future is colored by the blood red hands of time
Confess your sins try to save your blackened soul
But I guess you'll never.... ...learn!
