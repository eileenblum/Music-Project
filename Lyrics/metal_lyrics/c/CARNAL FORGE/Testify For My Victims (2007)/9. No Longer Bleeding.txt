I depend on the powers of my inner self
Alone in the darkness tasting the shame
The world falls down on me
And everything is pain

My, beauty, soul's no longer burning
Despite my lies never harmed
Now on the cross no longer bleeding
It's time for me to go home

I'm losing strength my mind gets weaker
My will to live is blown away
My will to rise instead of being thrown down
Is what scares me most

My, beauty, soul's no longer burning
Despite my lies never harmed
Now on the cross no longer bleeding
It's time for me to go home

They always follow inside me
Just to bring me fear (just to bring me fear)
They scare my weak sense to death
And lead my thoughts to the other side

As my mind is turning to ashes
The preachers hand will lead the way
Just face it life ain't fair
And I'm tired not finding the truth
Will It be forever guilt
That fuels my forever
If so I'll welcome death
And I'll finally be free

My beauty souls no longer burning...
Now on the cross no longer bleeding
It's time for me to go home

They always follow inside me
Just to bring me fear (just to bring me fear)
They scare my weak sense to death
And lead my thoughts to the other side

As my mind is turning to ashes
The preachers hand will lead the way
Just face it life ain't fear
And I'm tired not finding the truth
Will It be forever guilt
That fuels my forever
If so I'll welcome death
And I'll finally be free

As my mind is turning to ashes
The preachers hand will lead the way
Just face it life ain't fear
And I'm tired not finding the truth
Will It be forever guilt
That fuels my forever
If so I'll welcome death
And I'll finally be free
