I'm your... arch enemy
I am your nemesis
I am the lord of lies
I'm your, your false messiah part human, part divine

I am the locust rising and the blood that rains
I'm the part of mankind gone insane
I am the reason
I am the cause

I am... the lust to kill bred from the pain of life
I am your cause of death, reason to live
I am your only friend, the one who bears false witness in the end
Judge, jury and executioner too
And here's something you should know;
I'm the death that lives inside of you

Fabricated from your feeble minds
Incarnated in these evil times
I'm the Morningstar

Dead bodies on crosses hang
Godsend (God's End)
Lead the lambs to their slaughter
Dead bodies on crosses hang
Godsend (God's End)
Bleed the meek

I'm vanity
I am your growing greed
I'm sloth, pride, hate and disease
I'm all your memories lost
I'm gluttony and the wrath of lust
I'm anxiety and suicide too
And here's something you should know...
I really don't give a fuck about you

Fabricated from your feeble minds
Incarnated in these evil times
I'm the Morningstar

Dead bodies on crosses hang
Godsend (God's End)
Lead the lambs to their slaughter
Dead bodies on crosses hang
Godsend
Bleed the meek

Born, out of chance you're given a life
Whatever you say I'll know it's a lie
Kept safe, in the dark but then one day
There's more to life than preparing to die
Torn from the womb you're screaming in pain
Taking back what's mine I'm controlling my life
This is the right time to ...Rise

Dead bodies on crosses hang
Godsend (God's End)
Lead the lambs to their slaughter
Godsend (God's End) Godsend
Bleed the meek
Godsend (God's End)
Dead bodies on crosses hang
Godsend, Bleed the meek
