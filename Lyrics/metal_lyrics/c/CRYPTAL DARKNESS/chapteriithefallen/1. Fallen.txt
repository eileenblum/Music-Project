[Music and Lyrics: Mark Kelson]

I'm lost, I've fallen
into a pain so deep
Mercy is all I need
a hand to save my soul

I'll give you all
if you want it
I'll give you all
if you need it
If you want my pain
If you want my pain

Drowning in a void
am I less of a man to need
I'm stronger to grieve
than to bury it down deep

I've fallen...

I'll give you all
if you want it
I'll give you all
if you need it
If you want my pain
If you want my pain

I turn to you and
I dont know why
needing more than
you can give
not giving as much
as you need
an irony so close to my heart

I've Fallen
again and again...
