[Music and Lyrics: Mark Kelson]

Is this my coldest winter
I've lost my warmth, my soul
so still in your coffin
I want to touch you
a vision of perfection
hear your heart beat
hold you close
in all your splendour
must I travel eternity
without feeling the warmth
of your breath on my skin...

I have fallen from grace
numb is all I feel...

Shall I awaken from
this twisted dream
from this darkened symphony
which is my agony

Our love is
stronger than death
I can feel you
through my veins
like the desire
I once saw in your eyes
you shall come to me
and we shall unite...

I have fallen from grace
numb is all I feel...

Shall I awaken from
this twisted dream
from this darkened symphony
which is my agony
