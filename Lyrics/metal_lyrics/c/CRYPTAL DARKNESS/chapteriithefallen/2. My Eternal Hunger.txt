[Lyrics: Mark Kelson]

My hunger for you grows inside me
like an eternal fire burning inside my soul
I long to taste your flesh
I hunger for your warm blood

Into my darkness you bring light
can I feel love once more
or am I damned into emptiness
where your touch I shall never feel

I am your servant
I would die for you one thousand times
for you no pain is stronger
than the pain that tears at my heart...

You are all things pure, all things of god
I need you for you are my destiny, everything I desire
I bare not feel your warm blood on my cold flesh
you shall not feel my torment ever...

I am your servant
I would die for you one thousand times
for you no pain is stronger
than the pain that tears at my hear...

Words cant describe my emotions
I no longer experience fear
why did it come to this blind in our pain
the events of my life are before me
birth lay the path towards death
the subsistence of my flesh condemned to rot
our souls become one
our pain washed away
in a storm of renewed hope
I feel you inside my mind
together at last for eternity...
