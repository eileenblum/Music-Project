[Music and Lyrics: Mark Kelson]

Your eyes tell of lost love
your tears tell of your pain
I tremble as we kiss
as we embrace our passion

Darkness soothes a hungry soul
and in the twilight I dream
in the darkness we dance
this moment shall never end

I caress your delicate skin
melting into black silhouettes
I embrace thee my beloved
a moment I can not bare to end

In the darkness we dance
as the candles flame dies
our pain fills my heart
the sorrow of our last embrace...

Darkness soothes a hungry soul
and in the twilight I dream
in the darkness we dance
this moment shall never end
