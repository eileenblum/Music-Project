[Music and Lyrics By Mark Kelson]

For centuries I've walked this world alone
immersed in the serenity of the shadows
filled with the blood of life
between your world and mine... help me

They whispered you had risen
your love means more than life itself
your neck burns with uncontrollable pain
that won't cease until you rest in the shadows

The dark air of the night so cold
I can show you truth beyond your dreams
your fiery tears they seared me
as we stared into the candles flame

how do you comprehend a bond of such
intentioned sacrifice I plead with the darkness
your skin is of purest ivory and as you weep
I catch your ebony tears we melt in our hidden desire...
Please submit your soul to me
to become my destiny I beckon to you
through the mist of the everlasting rain
spill your blood stop our pain
be my bride of darkness
you are me and I am you forever...

The pale moon it comes alive in your eyes
I weep why must the sun ever rise
for in this darkness your radiance
consumes me for this I give you life... eternal

They whispered you had risen
your love means more than life itself
your neck burns with uncontrollable pain
that won't cease until you rest in the shadows

The dark air of the night so cold
I can show you truth beyond your dreams
your fiery tears they seared me
as we stared into the candles flame

Death it yields immortality
as the darkened wind cries your name
as you leave your mortal dread
your blood fills me with ecstacy
together at last I now know that I can be free...
