[Music and Lyrics: Oneil Alexander]

Her dying embrace still haunts within
through the blackest shade of nightfall
her enchanting voice it whispers serenades
a dark romance... yet never again
fate so tragic is mine to keep
forever will I miss her last dying kiss

As the sun sets before my very eyes
so lifeless she sleeps never to rise
an erotic dream of a winters kiss
so warm it melts like the snow in my hand

An ebony tear sheds only for you
beyond this sorrow deep within me
a promise we made evermore
I loved you and still I do

"The light of our dying sun
faded so long ago
captured by this immense nightfall
my sweet goddess...
so pale so cold
naked she lay to the virgin snow"

Her dying embrace still haunts within
through the blackest shade of nightfall
her enchanting voice it whispers serenades
a dark romance... yet never again
fate so tragic is mine to keep
forever will I miss her last dying kiss

The time we shared your virgin kiss
and that of mine you took from me
I surrender my everything to you
then you gave your self to me

Under a sunless sky
beyond the midnight hours
to dance in the shadows while the sun sleeps
I held you with affection in my weak arms
I wish I never let you go

As I walk the path of this lonely journey
dreamlike it rains sadness so endlessly
awaiting the dusk to descend
remembrance and my tears for you
shall fall eternal...
