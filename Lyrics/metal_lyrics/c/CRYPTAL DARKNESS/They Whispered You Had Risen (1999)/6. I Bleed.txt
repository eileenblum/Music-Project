[Music and Lyrics: Mark Kelson]

I bleed like no man
I drown in my pain
tear it out take it away
my heart I no longer need

I scream like no man
I cry in vain
tear it out take it away
my soul I no longer need

All because of you...

I'm a fool for you
blinded by your touch
take my eyes take them away
lost in you... forever

I die like no man
all because of you
I bleed...
