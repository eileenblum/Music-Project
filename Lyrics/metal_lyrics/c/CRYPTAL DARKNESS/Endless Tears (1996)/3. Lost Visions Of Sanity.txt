[Lyrics: M. Kelson]

The emptyness and the pain
I live my life in vein
This sorrow I forsake
Lost happiness I take

Alone I face my darkest hour
Alone without my sanity
Shattered memories of my life
Lost love flows a river of blood

My soul lost entangled in a web
Reach for your hand but no one is there
Shadows reflect my emotions
Lost cry like a child tears of pain

You were so fragile
So easy to break
I loved you so
But your life I did take

I ended your life your blood runs like water
For this I eternally suffer in my immortal hell
My soul is lost my hope has died
You were so warm so soft
Now cast into a cold grave

I hear you call to me when you sleep
Your pain fills my soul so deep
Visions of your beauty reach out I feel your touch
But now you are a corpse
And for that I hurt so much

You were so fragile
So easy to break
I loved you so
But your life I did take
