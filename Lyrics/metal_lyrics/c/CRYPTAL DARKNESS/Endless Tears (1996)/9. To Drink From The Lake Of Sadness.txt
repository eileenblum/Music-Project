[Music: O. Alexander]
[Lyrics: O. Alexander]

Forever the snow falls into a pond of tears
As they fall from the sky... descending, sometimes they cry

Sometimes they cry, autumn trees they weep
In sadness suffering, for soon shall I die
Forward to a path of lonliness I walk upon
As the sun fades into the distance

Darkness begins to enshroud above
I am at peace so alone

Harmonious nightfall has arrived
Place of sadness I journey through
A place where no life dwells
In this realm of Isolation

Darkness is closing in on me
I am at peace so alone

Beyond all pain and suffering
A sea of tormented souls wash away my tears
In sufferance I am not healed
For I am in torment
As the wind blows in silence
Darkness be taken to peace
Vultures are singing such sweet songs
Am I to die in this place...

I look into the cold water
The reflection of my face appears
No longer can I cry, I drink in serenity
From the lake of sadness
Winter the frost of december
Mist surrounds the pale moon
At last I rest this endless rest
I am not dead yet I have not life

Sometimes they cry, autumn trees they weep
In sadness suffering, for soon shall I die
Forward to a path of lonliness I walk upon
As the sun fades into the distance

Darkness has surrounded me
At peace, so alone...

Forever the snow falls into a pond of tears
As they fall from the sky... descending, sometimes they cry
