[Lyrics: M. Kelson]

Why do I suffer
Darkness consumes my soul
Trapped in this torment
Emptyness fills this blackness

My blood runs cold
I feel so lifeless so empty
Don't leave me this way
Death overwhelms me

Our love is stronger than death
Even beyond the grave we are together
We are one in eternal damnation
Our love is forever

My cold flesh caress' yours
Your warmth is what I crave
For you I would die your slave

Darkness surrounds I close my eyes
But visions of you are all I see
Suffering brings me to my knees
I scream for redemption but torment overwhelms me

I see you in my sleep your last gaze burnt into my mind
Covered in your warm blood I can?t let this be
My life incomplete for part of me has gone
My heart remains with you as I wander through the mist of dawn

Our love is stronger than death
Even beyond the grave we are together
We are one in eternal damnation
Our love is forever

I want to taste your last dying breath
I need to die a cold morbid death
