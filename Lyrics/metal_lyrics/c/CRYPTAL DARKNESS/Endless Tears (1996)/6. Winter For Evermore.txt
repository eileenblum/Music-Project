[Music: O. Alexander / M. Kelson]
[Lyrics: O. Alexander]

Deep within the evergreen woods
An old gravestone alone it stanto times of the ancient past
Dismal winter gloom surrounds this forest
Chills sweep across octobers path
May this y be darkness...

Everlasting snowfall from this day forth
In winter for evermore

Everlasting snowfall from this day forth
In winter for evermore...
