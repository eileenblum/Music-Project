Heavy breath
Not far from death
Drowned in dreams
Nightmares teems

You will suffocate
Schizophrenia is your fate
Pursued until you die
Constant terrified

No more hope to find
In your deranged mind
There's no therapy
To cure your destiny

Corroding day by day
Until you fade away

Inner persecution
Brings you bad illusions
Inner persecution
A mental demolition

Desperation surrounds you like a veil
To the wall of suffering you're nailed
So in the end you'll die in fear
Because you are mad and no one cares

Splitted personality
Confined in one body
Trying to find some space
In the psychological maze

Some one good and some one bad
Every one of them made you mad

Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia

Heavy breath
Not far from death
Drowned in dreams
Nightmares teems
