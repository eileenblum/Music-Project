A virus brought decay to your chromosomes
Disturbed the DNA you lost your self-control

Material energy has brought you this blur
Psychotherapy your last chance to be cured

The mental atmosphere beyond your universe
Is filled with cosmic fear can you break the curse

As you're lying numbed they're entering your mind
As deep as they can come to see what they can find

The spaceship rotates into the outside
A world of emptiness
Camera obscura
Dark... the dark big void

Approaching the land where it's sunset at dawn
To cure is their mission, a challenge too big
Too big for a human being

Countdown
Take off
Free yourself
You've had enough
Fight against
Be strong
This surgery
Will last long
