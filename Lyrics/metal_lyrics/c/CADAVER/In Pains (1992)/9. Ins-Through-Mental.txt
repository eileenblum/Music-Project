Slowly drifting through the tunnel of light
Away from reality and from all it's spite
From the dreadful day to a safe night

Emotion drain
Through the veins
Feel no pain

Floating in the sky free as a bird
Strange calm sounds that no one ever heard
Reaches the mind like comfortable words

Emotion drain
Through the veins
Feel no pain

Ins-through-mental - Like a traveller
Ins-through-mental - Hypnotised
Inner secrets betray themselves

Closing in on the eternal answer
Exploring the unknown mental galaxy

Beyond the real world and the fatality
It's the end of mess and complexity

Slowly drifting through the tunnel of light
Away from reality and from all it's spite
From the dreadful day to a safe night
