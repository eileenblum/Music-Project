Senses takes off from the world outside
Exposed enough, it's to hide
A life that was confined in a liar
All alone nothing to share

Crisis will no longer exist
In your mind that's full of mist
Relief and heal can sure be gained
Following after the runaway brain

Act no more just lie down still
Do keep warm stay away from the chill
Run away, away from the past
Catch up the time, catch it up fast

Do not step over the line again
Do go as far as your runaway brain
What will happen to our dear old friend?
We assure you all there won't be no happy end

You're growing fast from the past...
You're growing fast from the past...

Senses takes off from the world outside
Exposed enough, it's to hide
A life that was confined in a liar
All alone nothing to share

Crisis will no longer exist
In your mind that's full of mist
Relief and heal can sure be gained
Following after the runaway brain
