You're gasping for breath
Your heart stops to beat
You'd enter your death
And your soul would release

Your death'll have to wait
I choose your fate
You'll find no rest
When your body lies in the chest

I pulverise your dreams
Resurrect you without limbs
No one hears your screams

...Blurred visions
Of a life to be
An existence pain
To last eternally

Your death'll have to wait
I choose your fate
You'll find no rest
When your body lies in the chest

I manipulate your will
And you won't hesitate
When I order you to kill
