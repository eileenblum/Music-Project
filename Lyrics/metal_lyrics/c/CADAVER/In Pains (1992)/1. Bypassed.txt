Nothing inside
Nowhere to hide
They acted blind
Leaving you behind

No hands to hold
No fairy-tales told
No safety belts
No one to help

No space for you in this dreadful world
A distance away from laughter and joy
No love and care or encouraging words
That's no way to live for a helpless little boy

You thought you find help at last
It didn't work out being bypassed

You lived your live in solitude
No values to bear, just lonely and nude
Chasing after a piece of care
It's hard to find in the floods of fear...
