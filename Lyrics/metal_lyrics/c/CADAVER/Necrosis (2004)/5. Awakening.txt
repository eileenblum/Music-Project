[Music: Anders Odden / Carl-Michael Eide, Lyrics: Anders Odden]

Dig your way to misery
Spark eternal hatred
Burn all bridges
Set it free
Your time here has been altered

Awakening
Free your mind
Insanity made you blind
Awakening
Free your soul
Let your cold winds unfold

See the storm on the horizon
One man against it all
Without fear
Mind control
You are ready for your quest

Awakening
Free your mind
Insanity made you blind
Awakening
Free your soul
Let your cold winds unfold

Bloodline from the Stone Age
Primitive and old
Eyes like reptiles let you see
Brain mass blurs the imagery

I cannot hide from life or death
I want to be alone
My eyes canï¿½t see what you can see
I see no flesh or bones

Dig your way to misery
Spark eternal hatred
Burn all bridges
Set it free
Your time here has been altered
