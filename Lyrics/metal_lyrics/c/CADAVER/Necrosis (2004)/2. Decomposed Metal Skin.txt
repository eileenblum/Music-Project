[Music: Anders Odden / Lasse Johansen, Lyrics: Anders Odden / Ole Jï¿½rgen Moe]

DDecomposed metal skin
Decomposed metal skin
Do you know that you are dead?
Scream you fuck
Who is now your king?
Do you know where you belong?

Septic fumes of putrefaction
Massacre
Unholy war
Horded of flesh are to be wasted
Bloodstained sand
Death and gore

Raining flames are falling down
Lightning strikes
Paranoid
Hide behind the metal shields
Live to die for the humanoids
You are dead
Decomposed metal skin

Do you know that you are dead?
Scream you fuck
Who is now your king?
Do you know where you belong?

Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Fists in the air!
I did slay the beast
The martyr is dead
Ea
Ea
Ea
Help carry him now to his maker
God ï¿½ the enslaver of the frightened and weak

Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus is dead!
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus is dead!
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus is dead!
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus is dead!

Raining flames are falling down
Lightning strikes
Paranoid
Hide behind the metal shields
Live to die for the humanoids
You are dead
Decomposed metal skin
