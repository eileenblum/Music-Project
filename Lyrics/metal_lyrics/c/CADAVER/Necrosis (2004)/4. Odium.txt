[Music: Anders Odden, Lyrics: Per Dirge]

Their souls omit from their necks
Hung up our blade carves new beliefs
We ridicule your ancestry
And thoughts of holy union

We condemn and clave
The earth trembles
As our machinery slithers forth
It slithers forth

Pass your religions
Pass your lies
Minerval worshipper of he who dies
Pass your religions
Pass your lies
Eater of all
Bringer of hate
Bringer of hate

Ritual extinguisher
Emperor of deceit (Fuck your god)
In possession
Darkness before light
Jehovah, come to realize Satan is might!

Satan is might
Might!

Submit to the void
Fuck your god

Submit to the void
Carcass anima mundi lover
Posing in rotting flesh
All the human you can be
You can be!

The souls omit from their necks
Hung up our blade carves new beliefs
We ridicule your ancestry
And thoughts of holy union
