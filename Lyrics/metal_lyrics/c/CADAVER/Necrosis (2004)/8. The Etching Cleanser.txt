[Music: Lasse Johansen, Lyrics: Ole Jï¿½rgen Moe]

Waste as the seas flood
The religious soil and
Mankind lays in ruin still
We burn with joy

Heed the call the distorted grin
The enlightened has prevailed
Now face the sewer
Spirits die with the written words
Icons scattered in the sea
... The etching cleanser

Cold
Waiting
Grave

Words end...

So come extinction
The ethnic savior
No lies
Hope
Dies
Terrified
The sickened fall
Fall

The mindless weep polluted tears
Preachers vomit human waste

The shapeless crawl in cancer soil
The melting earth still breaths

Heed the call, the distorted grin
The enlightened has prevailed
Now face the sewer
Spirits die with the written words
Icons scattered in the sea
... The etching cleanser
