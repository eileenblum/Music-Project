Goatfatherï¿½s son
Sacred holy words of loyalty claiming your salvation
When the timing of the rulers of your life is depending that their words
Are truly reviling you from pain you feel when you wait to die...
Your pain

Blinded you sacrifice your mind for their beheading
Of all you are when time is running out
A soldier nothing but a piece in the puzzle
Lead by those you should not have trusted with your life

With violence our life is measured up against the idea of pride
You forget your quest for the new ideas to fill your daily needs
No one lives for anything but earthly matters
No protection is given you if you donï¿½t become a slave...
In time
