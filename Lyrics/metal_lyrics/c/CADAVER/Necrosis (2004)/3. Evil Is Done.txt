[Music: Anders Odden / Carl-Michael Fide, Lyrics: Anders Odden / Ole Jï¿½rgen Moe]

Live to die by the evil oath
Scapegoats of the blind and weak
Recreate
Reform our way of life
Dominate
Our way of death
Signs are written in digital sand
The storm is still just a swift breeze
The unforeseen is yet to be revealed
To be revealed

Omen one ï¿½ is still to come
Omen two ï¿½ is still due
Omen three ï¿½ will let them free
Omen four ï¿½ you fucking whore
Omen five ï¿½ are you still alive?

Live to die by the evil oath
Scapegoats of the blind and weak
Recreate
Reform our way of life
Dominate
Our way of death
Signs are written in digital sand
The storm is still just a swift breeze
The unforeseen is yet to be revealed

Omen six ï¿½ fire on the Styx
Omen seven ï¿½ there is no heaven
Omen eight ï¿½ will choose your faith
Omen nine ï¿½ will hit you blind
Omen ten ï¿½ you are one of them

Evildoers ï¿½ evil is done
Evildoers ï¿½ all earth-life is gone
Evildoers ï¿½ will hit you blind
Evildoers ï¿½ enter the gates

Omen six ï¿½ fire on the Styx
Omen seven ï¿½ there is no heaven
Omen eight ï¿½ will choose your faith
Omen nine ï¿½ will hit you blind
Omen ten ï¿½ you are one of them

You are one of them
You are one of them
You are one of them
You are one of them
You are one of them!
