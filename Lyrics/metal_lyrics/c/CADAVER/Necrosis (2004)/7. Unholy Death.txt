[Music: Anders Odden / Lasse Johansen, Lyrics: Anders Odden]

Gaze into my dying eyes
The light is killing me

Sick
White
Unholy
Death

Stab my sorry lungs to hell
Let them suck m y blood

Feel the stench of blasphemy
As I die
Die
Die
Die

Sick
White
Unholy
Death

Do you feel merciless?
Come on letï¿½s fucking see

Feel the stench of blasphemy
As I die
Die

Life is not precious
Take me to death where I belong
Vile and obnoxious
I cannot hide my joy
Or whatï¿½s to come

Sick
White
Unholy
Death

Do you feel merciless?
Come on letï¿½s fucking see

The solid mass that once was me
Is still a curse
