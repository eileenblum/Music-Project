[lyric by Max]

Day is gone
Became weaken, I fell over
Forest shroud in darkness
Light wind cools me
Ran in search of justice 
Foliage close my eyes
Rain lashed my face
Roots tangle my legs
I fell on the earth like other
who lost hope
Ran in search of faith
Ran through the dense forest
Hesitate arise and fall
Ran in search of myself
I ran through the dense forest
Now I'm dying
It seemed to me
I am autumnal leaf
Hanging on the limb 
On the one thread. Is hope
Wind picks me from life's tree
I fell on the earth like other
who lost hope
