[lyric by Max]

Day is gone, day is gone 
Became weaken, I fell over 
Forest shroud in darkness
Light wind cools me
Drops of blood pour down
From my face like a tears
I ran
Through the dense forest
Ran, in search of truth
Limbs of trees is slow down motion
Scratch my hands
Rends my clothes
Through the dense forest
I ran through the dense forest
Ran, in search of justice
Foliage close my eyes
Rain lashed my face
Roots tangle my legs
Ran in search of faith
Ran through the dense forest
Hesitate arise and fall
Ran in search of myself
