[lyric by Max]

When the last warrior will fall
The moon will rise the raindrops will fall
They will cool our fiery earth
It was the cruel battle 
The clanking of my blade
The battle for ideal
The pain, the scream and death
Please - my God,
Help me-e
The sun and the wind
Help me too
The earth was saturated 
With blood, with human lifes
The snort of horses, hoofbeats
The earth mixed with the blood 
The arrow, pierce my body 
I don't have, strength to fight
It was the, last engagement
For me and, anyone
Please - my God,
Take me-e
The sun and the wind
Take me too
When the last raindrops will fall
The sun will rise, and I will fall
I'll greedily drink the juice of earth 
When the last sunbeam will fall
The silence will fall. I'll fan asleep
And the wind will blow my spirit away
