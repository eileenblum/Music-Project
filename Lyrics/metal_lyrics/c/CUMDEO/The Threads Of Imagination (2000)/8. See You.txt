[lyric bu Alexander]

Last beam of passing day
Brings melancholy
Before the falling dark
I'll see you again 
Again the emptiness
I'm lost, fear close my eyes
Oh, please, give me your hand
And take me from this thoughts
I feel warmth
Your tender skin is beautiful
But I can't
To enjoy her enchantment
Oh, God, why this torments for me?
After all I drain the cup of woe
My, Lord, bless
Don't let us to disappear
Help us to meet again
In your gardens
I'll see you again 
From your heavens.
