[lyric by Max]

Heavy cross on my shoulders
Tears lie wound in the heart
Fall into the abyss of anger and
Break against the stones in the human skin
Someday I will lay
Better way of myself
Someday I will stay
See the light in the end.
What a filth! I'm enslaved by myself
I need a strength in order to awaken
What a flame! The stones see...
I believed in purity of their intentions
Oh, my sweet sunset 
I don't want nothing else
Have opportunity to return
But the fire burns
I would want sprout the kernel of truth
But dry up the living spring
I would want to remain 
But it makes no sense
