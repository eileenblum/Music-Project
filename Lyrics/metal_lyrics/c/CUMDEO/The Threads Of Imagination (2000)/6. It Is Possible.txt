[lyric by Alexander]

I look at this place where you buried.
The end. Is it possible?
Cross rises over your body.
This wait for me. Is it possible?
I remember your hair
That lied long strands
Only rain can pet that.
Is it possible? 
Why are you going in the dark
Carry off a beauty, caress and love
I remember your eyes
Like a two deep lakes
Only earth can pet that
Is it possible?
Why are you going in the dark
Carry off a beauty, caress and love
The dusk comes
I go away nobody no here
Black raven sing a song
And flower cry, at your fate
Are you dreaming about?
I don't want but you?
