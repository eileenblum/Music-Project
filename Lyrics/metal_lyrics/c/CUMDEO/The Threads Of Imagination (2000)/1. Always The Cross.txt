[lyric by Alex Brezgunov]

In the beginning of life you must decide
Be man of misery or be independent
Are you happy in your life?
You said yes, but why you suffer?
You said no, welcome to us
Life is punishment of Jesus Christ
You going along the way of life
But how long you suffer?
Two-three turning-point of fate 
And will falling off the rails
...You come to blend alley... ooh
The way of life, to end of cross
Where anything don't decide,
That to do in future
But you have not how many minds
But you see cross
Always the cross
You have only one road 
Stand at the road of death
Death it is life, life it is death
Easy life for you, only for you
