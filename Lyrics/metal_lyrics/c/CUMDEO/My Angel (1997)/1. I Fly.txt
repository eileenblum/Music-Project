[lyric bu Max, music bu CUMDEO]

I close my eyes
Every other sometime
Fall into the kingdom of dream
I take a walk on wide green area
Light flook of clouds over me
May be it's birds
Bright eye of sun looks at me
His sight dazzle me 
I stumble on the air flow
And falling down 
Suddenly behind my back
Appear a wings
Splendid world open up
Before me
Do not devote my energies
I want. This enough
And I fly
And I fly like a bird
It seems this will eternally
These gardens, fields and cold brooks
Yes this exist
By my imagination
I sleep
I sleep. This enough.
