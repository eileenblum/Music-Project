[lyric by Alexander/Max, music by CUMDEO]

In times when my soul full of sorrow 
And when I can't help to myself
I turn my head to the sunrise 
And I open my mind
And I see angel
I hear his voice
Through from sky scope
I'm feeling frivolity
And I hear
I hear your words
Reach out your hands
You'll feels a wings
Let me dip into you
You'll hear the bird's songs
Lend me your eyes
I'll show universe 
You are my lord 
You are my master 
And when I die
You'll not disaster
