Of turmoil shore, appear she will
Like burning sulfur the sorceress eyes gleam
Reeking of incense, seducing to her willful deeds
Glimpse of a world, mortals can not see.

Tempt and lure, praying, at the threshold of worlds
Drawing me nearer, shimmering, fervently.

Her lustful chant, singing in tongues I don't understand
Trapped in her Incantation, engaging in perverted madness.

Erect phallus piercing the cunt, opening an obscure portal
In raging torment, I dissolve, unchaining from the secular flesh.

From a languid kiss, we drown in lethargy
Into depths tides, liquid insane love
A dreary place where worlds collide and lives end
Unchain and ascend from the secular flesh.

Queen of the night, dancing in perpetual motion
Obsession, a peculiar desire,
Queen of twilight, possessed by the night.
