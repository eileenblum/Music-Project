What is this eerie feeling
Further down, answers I seek
Filth and spite filled the tellurian mind
Rotten like the teeth of the mouth through we breathe.

When the depths embrace with dismal gleam,
Approaches a creature, guised in perversion and filth.

Show me your true form, I plead,
Oh creature of the nigh, what are thy intent with me

...Yet silence, there is no one here...
Who can tell what is imagined, what is real
Since for years it consumed the hearts and minds of men
In every death it takes, awaits liberty.

This is the path we chose, no turning back now
Brothers and sisters, unite in choir
For tonight we'll be set free, proclaiming victory.
