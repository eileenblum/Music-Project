Sickness, my loving god
Was it ever nothing but languishing dream
Or fevering fear
That turned into pestilent climax
Rotting ones are the ones
To whose company I always yearned
And in my voluptuous dreams arrived
Night after night.

When this night was slaughtered
Under its corpse I crawled
With the first rays of death
Deep down blackest of gods caressed me
With ripped lungs
Vapors of infinite pits I've inhaled
Like burning candle I sparked
Consumed through thousand nights
And in the waves of blooming flesh
At the sea of black bones
Among mouldering waves I slept.

Love that's never been so fatal
And delightfully sinister you bathe my flesh
At the rivers of bloody stars
Above this world of decay
And the blood from those rivers rains down
And dry over all people sacrificed people
Despicable company.

In a skeletal glory with a calamitous aura
I disembowel them all and their remains
I turn into majestic dead painting
By my own tingling hands.
