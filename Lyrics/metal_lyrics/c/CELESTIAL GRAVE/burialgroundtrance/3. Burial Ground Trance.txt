With solemn feeling, entering to this deathlike silence
I join to the company of dead ones
I yearn this ceremonial ground
Thousands beds of ancient remains
These timeless hallways draped by nocturnal air.
As my hand cracks, the veil of death
Revealing the past, facing the grand darkness
It warms my body, more than any living flame
Fills me with ecstasy and blazing energy, from the other side..
I breath the putrefaction, of this death cradle
I am one with the ancient ground, at the ultimate center of life and death.
Rootstock remains, rotting limbs and gruesome skull
I raise them to the gloomy lunar light.
Air is filled with ancient horrors, chthonic beasts from my inner chamber
Burial ground trance, CHTHONIC KATHARSIS!
