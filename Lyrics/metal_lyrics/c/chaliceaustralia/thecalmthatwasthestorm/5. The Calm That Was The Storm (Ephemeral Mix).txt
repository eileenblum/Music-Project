It seemed the sky must wither
The seas disperse, galaxies unfurl
My form, insensate, relinquish breath
Amidst noise and shattering earth

But no violence, not even a stir
Merely reflection of flickering light
In your still, unwavering gaze
Marked the hour of goodbye

It was in silence you revealed most
It was in saying nothing you said it all
The silence said it all

Sorry for not mirroring your calm
The inconvenience, the burden of guilt
For feeling the sting within the
Faint praise with which you damned me

I envy you such detachment
Your mute faith that better awaits
The sanguine ease of your stride as,
So quietly, you just walked away

It was in silence you revealed most
It was in saying nothing you said it all
The silence said it all

So say you felt just one regret
Say you shed one drop of brine
Please say one instinct yearned to scream
Into a silence thick with words
I could not bear to hear
