I had to face you again
I had to taste you once more
Alone
I had to hit that wall
With you as my mentor

And watch my wretched flesh rot
Inhaling the stench of regret
Feeling life stripped from my vertebrae
Free in my toxin vortex

Peak hour
Sewer side

I had to face you again
I had to taste you once more
Alone
I had to hit that wall
With you as my mentor

Rising from the bile of today
I refrain from that touch
Knowing I'll still feel you tomorrow
