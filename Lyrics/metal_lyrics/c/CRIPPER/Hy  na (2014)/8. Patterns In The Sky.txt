Beautiful
But what's beautiful?
My life, it ain't worth shit
In this world of monsters
Comfort is what I seek
But look at what I get
Portraying failure
May you be my savior

Say, is it me you see?
Who is it you want me to be?
Under water, hold your breath
Count to ten and and then again
The day they're gonna come and see
Will be the day I let you be
Until then I'm aiming high
I'm seeing patterns in the sky

Violence is everywhere
Then again, what could I fear?
Shaking my hand and pulling me near
Run, I'm ready to follow you

I wanna let myself go
Want it to be alright
But the underlying overplay
Makes me feel so much more alive
I belong to this world
Will die by my own hand
Take it, lover, let me be your guide
Like patterns in the sky

Violence is everywhere
Then again, what could I fear?
Shaking my hand and pulling me near
Run, I'm ready to follow you

Calming down the beast
The inherent burning fire
Seven steps away from perfect
Six away from scum
How much of truth is perception?
How much of truth is trust?
It's time to load my gun
I'm aiming high
I'm seeing patterns in the sky

Violence is everywhere
Then again, what could I fear?
Shaking my hand and pulling me near
Run, I'm ready to follow you
