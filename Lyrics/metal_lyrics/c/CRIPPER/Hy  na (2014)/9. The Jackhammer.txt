Keep a straight face, stand in line
Applause, applause
We're here
We're fine

Freedom comes in 99 flavors

What we take we waste
What we don't take
We throw away
One, two, three, four immolations
Five, six, seven dinner time

And you may think
There is nothing there
You don't see anything
'Cause you don't look at anything

It could have been the father
It should have been the son
It would have been the mother
If she had a gun, yeahhhh

On with the jackhammer!
Humanity under construction
On with the jackhammer!
Hate... manmade

Let's all go out and hang ourselves
As we become what we see
So bored, cared for and overfed

I'm sure it's for the better
I'm pretty sure it's pretty safe
And if it's not
Then nothing is
So let's leave it alone

First there were none
and then one
Then all of a sudden
there were some

Improving me, improving you
Improving faith, improving the truth

Pretend
We pretend
We pretend
We cannot pretend
We don't pretend
We pretend
We pretend
We don't pretend
We cannot pretend
We cannot pretend

We're the bleeding enemy
We're the bleeding enemy
We're the bleeding enemy
We're the bleeding enemy
We're the bleeding enemy
Oh God we're the bleeding enemy
We're the bleeding enemy
We're the bleeding enemy

Life
It's up to you
Or the one you leave it up to
Consequence
There is no consequence

Blind eye
I try to make you understand
But you're a look without a see
In the illusion of democracy
I raise my voice and disagree
