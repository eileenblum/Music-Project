High
Don't move, don't even breathe
It's dangerous
It never was more evident
High
You look like a dog
With a damn rug
Too big for your shadow
Source of information cut

Harbinger
Harbinger

Vibrant
Every dog has its day
But you need the courage
Or at least the stupidity
Vibrant
My eyes can see
Your dirty little secret
Is no longer safe with me

I am the king
To ruin everything
I am the king, only the sky is forever

Sustain
When everything I'm saying
Is all you want to hear
I'm right by your ear
Suspect
A lie is stronger
Than any truth can ever be
Who's gonna break the rules for you now?
