So what I hear
Fate and fear
We're dying all alone
Oh mother, my
I won't die alone
I'm in the Zone

Some are leaders
Some are led
It doesn't matter much to me
Here and now
Our play, our show
I'm alive

People pay
What money buys
Unpack it and decay
How sweet is success
When you hoard it away

Loud is our motor
Unlimited our gasoline
The thing that keeps us going...
There's no cure or medicine

We neither need a credit card
Nor do we pay with cash
A dime for the estasblishment
We party 'til we crash

Underneath the bottom shelf
When the bright lights are out
We gotta live with who we really are
And have but what shines inside

Loud is our motor
Unlimited our gasoline
The thing that keeps us going...
There's no cure or medicine

We neither need a credit card
Nor do we pay with cash
A dime for the estasblishment
We party 'til we crash

We need to come upon the suit that fits
To wear despite the trend
Once you found what gets you there
You never wanna let it slip away

Mindconstructed borders
Keep our dreams
From coming true
So don't sell yourself short
Get up on your feet
The longer you wait...
...the longer you wait

Loud is our motor
Unlimited our gasoline
The thing that keeps us going...
There's no cure or medicine

We neither need a credit card
Nor do we pay with cash
A dime for the estasblishment
We party 'til we crash
