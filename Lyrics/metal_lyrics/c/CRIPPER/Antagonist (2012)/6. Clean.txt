Losing, living, losing grip
Feeling, taking, feel like shit
I came here with nothing
But leaving now means leaving everything behind

I've pushed you farther than you'd go
I'm not your lover
Not your enemy
Why would you push all the buttons, open any door

And what I wish for
Is you wide awake
But you feel like rain in my head
Brainwash me clean

See, hate is no surprise
We fought everything we could
Synchronized our intentions
Until we lost what we had found

I've pushed you farther than you'd go
I'm not your lover
Not your enemy
Why would you push all the buttons, open any door

And what I wish for
Is you wide awake
But you feel like rain in my head
Brainwash me clean

Oh, well
That's good
I'm alright
And it's getting even better now

Remind me why I wanted this job
Because I'm starting to forget
Don't say no, say okay
As if saying so will make it so

I've pushed you farther than you'd go
I'm not your lover
Not your enemy
Why would you push all the buttons, open any door

And what I wish for
Is you wide awake
But you feel like rain in my head
Brainwash me clean

Who wanted those silly flowers in the backyard
And what about this we thing anyway
