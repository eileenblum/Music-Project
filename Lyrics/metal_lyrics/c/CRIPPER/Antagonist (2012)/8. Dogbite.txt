Come on

Under pressure
Under control
Feeding the living
With the limbs of the dead

Long before the dawning
Longing for the fall
Hell, we keep the motor humming
I am humming, running dry

Black, on fire, arrows
Aiming in the sky
Searching for a shelter, home
Hiding from each other's pain

Wake me, take me
Turn around and hate me
I may not be good company
But I can kill your apathy

Bleeding desire, beat inside, outside memory
Burning empire, like a fever turning blood into fire

Near the end of the stay
Near the bottom of the line
We all follow the animal
And escape the pain

Now tell me more about the girl
That I'm supposed to be
Sometimes it seems I've had enough
To make me
Make me walk away

If this is what you want
Then this is what you want
Who would even bother
Say, who wouldn't want it, too

Love controls with silence
As it does with words
You used to say that I have fire
Now you're gonna see me burn

Bleeding desire, beat inside, outside memory
Burning empire, like a fever turning blood into fire

What I fake in my head alone
Bleeds wherever I go

Now is just a matter of time
And we are less than a moment of high tension
Once bitten, twice shy

One is wrong and almost done
One is one plus one plus one
One is one more than just none
Another is just one, another is just one

Bleeding desire, beat inside, outside memory
Burning empire, like a fever turning blood into fire
