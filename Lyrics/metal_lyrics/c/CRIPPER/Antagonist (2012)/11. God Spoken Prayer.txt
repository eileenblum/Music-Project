Water
Surface
Horizon
Sky

And all are looking up to see
The universal remedy
Established phantom of the free
The modern myth security

There is a line
I drew a line
Into the sand
That line is fear

My mouth is bleeding
Like a wound
My mouth a wound
I'm bleeding into you

Whispering down the lane
Gathering, paralyzed
Open-mouth society
I wear you like a suit

Oh, mother earth
Out of the water
Out of sight
I am the devil's crippled hand

Licking drips off lips leaving delicate lies
Where the white rabbit goes, follows mankind
Like a god spoken prayer
They search, I teach 'em to find

Concern
Devotion
Shelter
Sacrifice

A life
To lose
What do you want from me
You make a fool out of yourself
