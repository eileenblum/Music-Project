Staring out the window
Ignoring the signs
Hear the knocking on the door
Let me inside

I'm still beating
I'm alive
Believe me, I am not pretending
I can see us now, ending

Stand up for the god
Who left you alone
The absence of god
Who left you alone

Our reanimated shelf life
Stretched to a breaking point
See, all you need is to breathe
To stay alive

I'm still breathing
I'm alive
In the mirror I see
My reflection staring back at me

Stand up for the god
Who left you alone
The absence of god
Who left you alone

Stand up for the god
Who left you alone
The absence of your chosen god
Has left you
Haunted animal of prey

Stand up for the god
Who left you alone
The absence of god
Left a hole
