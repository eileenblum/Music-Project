Come a little closer
Come near and you will see
You might find the peace I sense
Out there, almost within reach

With the headlights on
With a pocket full of stones
Waiting for the sun
Hoping for gravity

Fear the wrong, them all or nothing
Is it broken or just old
If you don't know, they surely will
Decide first for, then sell to you

Stand, stare
See, understand
If you wanna walk the line
Then there's no room to step aside

So now come clean
Let the healing begin
So now become one
With the beating within
We are not dead yet

A little closer
Yet about to see
The line dividing earth and sky
Is just a shadow in your head

The taste of insecurity, freedom
In a bottle full of rain
Step outside the ordinary
Enjoy
Living
Learning

So now come clean
Let the healing begin
So now become one
With the beating within
We are not dead yet

Breaking the bone of habit
Disturbing the peace of symmetry
Painting the best case scenario
Treasuring pain
Treasuring pain
