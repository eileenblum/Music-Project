Blood
You are a painting in the sky
Superior legions
Run superior plans
Who's gonna change the world for you today
Well, I guess you wouldn't want it any other way

Throwing
You in and out the game
Showing
That this world will still spin when you're gone
Throwing you in and out the game
Showing that this world that we're in, not to sin
Will still spin when you are gone

Red
Who stole the gentleman's hat
Yesterday's matters
Today only letters
We haven't seen you for so long
Now that we see it all seems so wrong

Throwing
You in and out the game
Showing
That this world will still spin when you're gone
Throwing you in and out the game
Showing that this world that we're in
Will still spin when you are gone

Imminence
A proof, a hidden evidence
For no reason
Life is against you
Silent
Conspiracy
Goddamned
Are you the beat
Are you the melody
Hegemony

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the emperor of us all
Bow down, follow the pain
May guilt be thy master
And remorse be thy name
