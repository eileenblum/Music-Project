You said you wanted me to smile
I put one on my face
Inside of me grows emptiness
I fell too far from grace
You wanted me to be someone
I knew I could not be
The defect is so plain to see
I just need to be me

You told me to be silent
I didn't say a word
While I'm screaming on the inside
I'm left alone and hurt
You still want me to be strong
I keep my head up high
Is it easy to be perfect?
I hide my wish to die

[Ref:]
If you can bear the truth you've spoken
If you can dream --
and not make dreams your master
If you can keep your head
When all about you are losing theirs
and blaming it on you

You expect me to stay with you
I reached out for your hand
The misery seems obvious
Cause I decide I can't
You wanted me to tell the truth
And I became a fake
Believe me when I say to you
It's just as hard to take
