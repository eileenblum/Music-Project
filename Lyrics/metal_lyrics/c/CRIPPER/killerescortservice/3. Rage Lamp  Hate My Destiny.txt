Inside my heart -- waking up
Upcoming dreams - linger on
Breathtaking thoughts -- cannot let go
Cutting a nerve -- washes away
A closet of pain -- leaving alone
Poem of hate -- opening out

[Bridge:]
Won't you stop me bleeding?
Can't I help myself?
Can't I help myself
- I need a place to rest and hide
Won't you stop me bleeding?
Can't I help myself?
Can't I help myself
My deepest fear's alone inside

[Ref:]
Where am I and who is me?
Where's the fuckin' place I need to be?
When did I lose my dignity?
Rage and hate my destiny.

Poem of hate -- opening out
Turning my head -- messing up
Mastery waste -- moves on
Multiple choice -- coming along
Decision's lost -- pulling me down
Inside my heart -- no waking up
