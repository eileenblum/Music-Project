[Lyrics: Britta]

I shut my mouth
To lend an ear
Then threw a stone
To break the silence

More than 4
Less than 5
Minutes left to fix your alibis
Stronger is only fear

What a surprise
These words coming to life are mine
Can you hear me?
I can't hear you

More than there
Has been before
This rollin' ball's a burnin' and it's
Way too fast to stop it now

Could it be
That this is not enough for us?
Back for seconds
In a minute

One question
What are you doing for your living?
One question
What are you living for?

Come on, loser, show off!
You're always more than you think
Go ahead and get what you want
Before you get you're wanting something else

Come on, sleeper, wake up!
You're always less than you could be
Go ahead and get what you want
Before you get you're wanting even

More than
You can take
Get rid of this attitude
It's killing you

What you know
What ever you might have seen
Let yourself go (Go on with that)
Don't let it go on that (Where will you go?)

More than
Just for the sake of it
What we have is ours
Hell is other people

What we are
Who we'll be -
We walk on our own
But we never walk alone
