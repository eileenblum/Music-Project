There is more to life than there's to see
It's my self-imposed priority
See the core and how it's thrilling me
Me and lunacy a unity

Upside down
Inside out
Can't you see I'm ready now
To fall into place

Hysteria
Look what hate &amp; anger have done
Hysteria
Look what hate &amp; anger have done

Strong is the one
To reanimate
All the madness I need to survive

Straight in your face
Ask yourself
Why the hell only I can draw you out

Each time my heart missed a beat
Or where it cracked after deceit
I could complete the incomplete
And beg for chances to repeat

See me now?
See my way?
And now tell me once more that you don't know
What I mean

Hear my words and understand
To reunite before we end
Close your eyes, my dearest friend
And welcome all that I've to send

Are you with me?
Are you alike?
