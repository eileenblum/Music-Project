It takes courage to enjoy
And devotion to survive
Blessed who knows
Divine who keeps
Insane who tries to resist

Many have been burnt before
No try-out, no guarantee
Hard to learn
Never to forget
Forever etched into your head

Beauty's found in lost control
One can taste but none can own
Hands off hold
No safety belt
With open eyes accelerate

Elemental everything
An aspect of demand
Twist of fate
Ecstasy
Triumph over compulsion

[Ref:]
Fire -- fire
Walk with me
Fire -- fire
Zero gravity
Fire -- fire
Walk with me
Fire -- fire
There's no guarantee

Something unknown to explore
For a moment out of sight
Waste a thought
To be prepared
Then a shot to understand

Monster-proof the shield of ego
Can't be reached from even ground
Infernal
Provocation
Walking freely but alone
