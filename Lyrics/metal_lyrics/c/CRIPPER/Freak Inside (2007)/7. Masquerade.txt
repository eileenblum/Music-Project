This is it, the game is over
All the stakes are lost
What once was
Forever failure
Keep your fingers crossed

Pretend to honor with each laughter
Wash their stains away
Come on over
Keep it rollin'
Here today

[Ref:]
You hide
No face
You die
Don't dare to live
Masquerade

Do the dance and spend a dime
Don't miss any chance
Fuck your mother
Suck your sister
Tell it to your friends

The hope is lost, the dream is dead
Something I forgot?
Leave a message
See you later
You're out, I'm not

Shave your head and paint it red
Loser lost his mind
Go home
Go alone
Already left behind

In the end your feigning laughter
Ruled your pretty face
Time is over
Sell it out
Nothing left to hate
