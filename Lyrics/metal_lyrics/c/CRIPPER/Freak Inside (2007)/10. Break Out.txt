Disposer
Decomposer
Led astray the role to play

Contender
Propaganda
Lost the soul the price to pay

Believer
Dereceiver
Meaningless and washed away

[Ref:]
In a world -- can't breathe -- break out
In these shoes -- don't fit -- break out
These nights -- can't sleep -- break out
This life -- to die -- you can't break out

[Bridge:]
Underneath this paradise
Grey the ashes, I can see
My face is as dry as yours
So clear our dreams
But bound our souls

Conviction
Contradiction
Open arms, access denied

Explosion
Provocation
Killed the will to run and hide

Frustration
Elimination
Can't control the freak inside
