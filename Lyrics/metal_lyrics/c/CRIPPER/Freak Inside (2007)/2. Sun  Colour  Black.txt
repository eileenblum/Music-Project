An owner of my own
A twisted thought my home
White: the noise
Sun; colour: black
Protagonize
Participate
World on fire, burning me

[Ref:]
A confession: Alone
Opposition: here
An internation: unknown
An indentation: fear

Disturber made of dirt
Each memory can hurt
Eyes: wide open
Mouth; distortion: pain
Freezing
Bleeding
Remain in silence, rest in peace
