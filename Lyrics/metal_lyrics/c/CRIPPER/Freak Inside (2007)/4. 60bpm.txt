Here we are
Front toward enemy
Here we stand
Presenting our arms

Welcome back
Still some jobs to do
Welcome home
Lets get this started now

Open up
Black eyed memories
Open doors
A mouthful of blood

Breaking up
All is well that ends well
Breaking news
First line of defence

We all were supposed
To stay with could-have-been friends
Taken part
In their would-have-been plans

I forgot
I felt free for minute
Let go
Was me for a minute

Face to face
Boogers on parade
Face the facts
No more double cross

Take aback
Sleeper has waken up
Taken apart
Countless apologies

On our own
Back on the advance
On our way
Taking over control

After all
Waste is left behind
Aftermath
For nothing at all
