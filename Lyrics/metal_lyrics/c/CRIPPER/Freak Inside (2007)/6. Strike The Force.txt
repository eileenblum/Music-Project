The misery begins with torture
Suppression, hate and ignorance
What I need
Fight for
I want to
Won't beg for

It's so disgusting, cheap and dirty
Take your hands off of me
Call me weak
Call me pathetic
Yes, I hate
I am against

[Ref:]
Strike the force
Aggressive attack
Attack the aggressor
Strike the force

Witness of a dead rebellion
Betrayal, loss, hypocrisy
Piece of shit
Shut up
Keep clear
I'll rip you up

I close my eyes and concentrate
Let hatred be my trail
Inhale
Exhale
1, 2, 3
And let it out
