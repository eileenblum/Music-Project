Follow me into the fire
Follow me into the fire
Follow me into the fire
Follow me into the fire

Fueling the corporate machine
Everything must stay the same
Collective disbelief
Harvesting horror
While fearing it created it

A nation of frustration
Elected misery
Passively consuming
Headline propaganda
Externalizing pain
Spreaders of hate
Blame upon the blamers
This war is in all of us

Kill
Resurrect
Resuscitate

Declaring the enemy
Throwback history
Our scars of silence
A monument of ignorance
Confessions of fear
The ultimate sacrifice
Carnage or feast
On the edge of sanity

Keep us tight
Keep us small
Make us believe you're 8 ft. tall
Sell us high
Buy us low
According to the protocol

The pulse of a generation (Follow me into the fire)
Attention is an asset (Follow me into the fire)
You critique the mainstream (Into the fire)
You manipulate the mainstream (Into the fire)
And while you're busy keeping your integrity
Society is catching up
And you become the mainstream
You become the mainstream
You become the mainstream
You

Authority through iconography
Authority through ipornography

The pig must fear
What the pig must fear
The blood on your hands
Is none of your business
You're not the soldier
You're the gun

Follow me (kill)
Follow me (kill)
Follow me (kill)
Follow me (kill)
