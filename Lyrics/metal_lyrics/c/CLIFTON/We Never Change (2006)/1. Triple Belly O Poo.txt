I'm standing on air, dreaming I'll reach you,
But these warning winds create the waves.
That drag us farther from the shore.
But these warning winds create the waves.
Mark my soul, bleed me dry.
These blistered lips and parched eyes prove
I'm not afraid to be alone...

False like sunlight, forged by sunset
The way it burns on your skin,
Like the breeze from the cold hearted wind.

Whispered in my ear,
"Watch me sink again"
I'm afraid to be alone
But I won't leave you here.

Watch me sink into my bitter slumber.

Made mistakes and taken wise.
Push the gray and raise the skies.

It helps make it through the night.
Made mistakes and taken wise.

I'm standing on air, dreaming I'll reach you,
But these warning winds create the waves.
That drag us farther from the shore.
But these warning winds create the waves.
Mark my soul, bleed me dry.
These blistered lips and parched eyes prove
I'm not afraid to be alone.
