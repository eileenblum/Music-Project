I want to clear the air,
Because this is haunting me.
But there's no more room, down here.
And its getting harder to breath.

Buried in a basement.
Bound and gagged, bleeding knees.
29 deep and snug, under dirty crawlspaces.

Buried in a basement.
Potassium forming.

Nowhere to run,
Nowhere to hide.
Never coming home.
Don't turn away,
Let's see that face.
Never coming home.

Pogo is here.

Nowhere to run,
Nowhere to hide.
Never coming home.
Don't turn away,
Let's see that face.
Never coming home...

Pogo comes home.

Cover the smell.

In a note to families,
Most sincere apologies,
And if the need comfort,
Pogo the clown is here.

Potassium forming over the eyes.
Mildew clotting maggots to molars.
That's why I sprayed them with lime,
(To cover the smell)
That's why I sprayed them with lime.
Pogo the clown is here.

Gallery of grief.
