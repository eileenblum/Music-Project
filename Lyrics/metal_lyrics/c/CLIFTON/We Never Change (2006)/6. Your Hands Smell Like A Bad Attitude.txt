Did you see her face?
It's not a war.
Or could you taste the tears?
There's so much more.
Or maybe you smelt the fear.
Can you show me how to forgive and let go?

We felt it smash her cheek.
It kissed us through the walls.
Splinters haunting my memory.
Better off alone.

She did it all for you.
So how could you forget,
When you gave us so much to remember?

She did it all for you.
Shatter my dreams for me.
She did everything for you.

Did you see her face?
Or could you taste the tears?
There's so much more.

He waits for me on 5th east.
We can sleep on the floor.
Tried not to crush the leaves,
Like we did the day before.

Two hands, four paws.
Two hands, four paws.
No one can help me
