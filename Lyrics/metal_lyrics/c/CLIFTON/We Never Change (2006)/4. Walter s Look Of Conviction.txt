Paint it splendor gone stale.
Big, bold, black and blue.
Paint it however you can hide it.
Still such an ugly view from here.

Don't lose sight as we grow.
Daylight deceives dim minds.

Fabric grins.
Judging eyes
Tender toes.

Friends like that don't mean a thing to me.
Half empty bottles, broken,
Thrusted deep through my disease.

Anchored between concrete walls.
Separate, separates, for the whole world to see.

Sober son made it through.
And I have so much to show for it too.
And in the morning I know you'll feel it too,
I'm still just as dead as you.
As you...

Fabric grins.
Judging eyes
Tender toes.

Paint it splendor gone stale
Big, bold, black and blue.

Friends like that...
Friends like that...
