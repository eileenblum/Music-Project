Get out and push,
The tires in the mud.
Are you getting any reception?
No? How about now?

Don't lose your heart.
Off beat and out of time.
Have you stumbled upon salvation?
No? How about now?

I'll find you first.
Revenge.
Sunrise.
I'm torn.

Forever.

Boy does time fly by when whores watch the sun rise.

Forever.

Bleed for me.
Bleed for me.
Bleed deep for me.
Bleed forever and ever.

Bloody beggars lost in timid tombs.
Don't lose your heart here.
Just watch the sun rise.
Just watch the sun rise.
Just watch the sun rise.

Don't lose your heart.
Off beat and out of time.
Have you stumbled upon salvation?
No? How about now?

I'll find you first.
Revenge.
Sunrise.
Reborn.
Forever.
