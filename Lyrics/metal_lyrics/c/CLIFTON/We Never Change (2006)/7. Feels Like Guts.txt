Walking away from the fear in my boots, again.
Maybe we've found ourselves, or someone else.

And every night I wake from shaking knees, again.
Maybe we've found ourselves, or someone else.

But wait, there's more.
Because it feels too good to let go.
And time has not been a friend of mine.

Over the years we spent,
What makes us break like this?
And I'm closer now.
Would you still care for me?

Walking away from the fear in my boots, again.
Maybe we've found ourselves, or someone else.

Gaze the glided gear.
What's with the fear down here?
Gazed and mesmerize.
What's with the fear down here?

Carl, would you still care?
For me?

Gaze the glided gear.

Gaze the glided gear.
What's with the fear down here?
Gazed and mesmerize.
What's with the fear down here?

Mark.
