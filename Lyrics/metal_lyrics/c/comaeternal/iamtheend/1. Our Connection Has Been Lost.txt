This is failed poetry.
Words rising like smoke from fire, rising into the air to be dissolved and forgotten.
Broken thoughts from silent lips, all these days we've been starving for the answers.
Broken thoughts from silent lips, your eyes are as hollow as what lies behind.
Scraping our teeth against the wall, grinding bone to dust, and raking our fingernails across our chests to tear out the heart that never served us well.
You know nothing beyond what you're forced to and cringe at the thought of living for something.
We're dreaming of words that last forever.
Seeing fire in the eyes of creation and letting it burn in ourselves.
I take no blame for you.
Interpret word for word.
Examine every breath, more full of meaning than you will ever know, until they rise across every cell of your body to meet your throat.
Out of your mouth and gone with the wind.
These satellites are failing, our lines detaching.
We share nothing now but embedded ghosts of the past.
Lips scathed with lies, emotions abandoned with memories.
Our ghost ships passing under disengaged satellites, our connection has been lost.
Still those eyes turn up blue every single time.
Scratched and faded words fall on deaf ears.
Be my hope for humanity.
These are secrets that should have been whispered in your ear by candlelight or screamed in your face at just the right moment.
I wish this could have meant so much more.
