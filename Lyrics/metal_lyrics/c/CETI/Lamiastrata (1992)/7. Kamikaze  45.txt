Yes, I remember this year
When we re flying on Mitshubishi Zero
Yes, I remember this time In 1945 we fought.
Say, say hello to the sun
And don't wait for the answer, the answer is - die
So, you must know, I'll return
Only in tears and that sad memories

[Chorus: ]
Oh! Don't give up, bring me victory
Right now!
Say, say good bye to your wife
And don't tell your children, that now you must fight
Say, say good bye to your live
Kamikadze was born to die in the clouds.

[Chorus:]
Oh! Don't...
Yes, you remember this year
when you're flying on Mitshubishi Zero
Yes, you remember this time
In the 1945 you fought
