In the broken light
The day against the night
The angry streets
The kids in black
Try to forget
They're human beings
Light on the empty street
That no one wants to meet
Because it's deathly shit
Fire Angels
They want to kill you now
Stoned faces in the car
The rape is their desire
Fire Angels
Now You'll better run and hide away
The police and government
Don't wane to hear
About this damned men
Fire Angels
You'll better stay in home
Because nobody can
Give you a helping hand
Fire Angels
[Chorus:]
Now' You'll better run and hide away
So, you'll better run, yeah!
This is the future of our town
The movies and the funs
Where violence dance
Make him stronger
Fire Angels
And parents learn to kill
Because this way is still
One way to surviving
Fire Angels
