Show me the new fashion way
I don't believe when they pray
One breath of truth give me now
I know you can do it somehow.
Oh, Lord can't you see
what your priests can do
with the poor sheep right now?
Oh, Lord can't you hear
What your priests can say
To the poor people there?
Hey, men do you thing it's all right
That you must live on your knees
I have my credo in my heart
Cry to go with bright face.
I'm sure you live in the dark
You must be completely blind
So look at this with my eyes.
Blood, gold and tears mixed up in this world
How can I live when they say it's right
Picture what will be later
If you don't want to fight.
