See the streets in the misty dawn
See that man and woman they walk around.
Let's ride out of here so fast as we can do.
Factories and crossroads lights
Want to stop us when we ride
Let's go out of here so fast as we can do.
Hear me singing you understand
Hands on the wheel it's our chance
Let's ride out of here so fast as we can do.
It's our home it's our room
But people want to put you down and they do it
Let's ride out of here so fast as we can do
That big crowd on the promenade
Do you think, that we are the same?
Let's ride out of here so fast as we can do
Back from the window neighbours  laugh
Yes I hate you shut up you mouth!
Let's ride out of here so fast as we can do.

[Chorus:]
Don't give up don't hang around
Catch the wheel and say "goodbye"
I want to take you to that place
Where we can make love and nothing more
Let's ride out of here so fast as we can do...
I want to take you to this house
Where we can tell the true and never lies
Let's ride out of here so fast as we can do...
