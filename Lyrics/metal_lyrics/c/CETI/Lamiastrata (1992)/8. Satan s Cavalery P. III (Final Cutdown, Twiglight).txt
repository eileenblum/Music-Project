Now, in the 24th century, after the 5th World War,
after the total destruction of atmosphere, earth and mankind
Jesus Christ came back, as he had promised...
But in that time religion and God were only ancient legends
that no one could remember... Amen
People are living under the ground
The hell is now behind the clouds
Only in the caverns they way survive
The burning' air makes only fear and starts to kill
The deadly fear.
How can I save my little child?
What can I tell him about the sun?
The only true answer is when 1 say
Sun is the killer, and run away, run away...
Hear me baby...
And when my woman is close to me
I hear her breath and see her tears
The breath is heavy and tears are red
Baby, baby I'm scared...
Hear me baby
There is nothing on the other side
Hear me baby
But we must be live 'cause
Jesus doesen't forget about us.
Oh, Lord will you find us here
Take a step under the ground
welcome in the Hell. don't hang around...
We are living and watching you
We wonder what you can do
What about Heaven, what about Prise
What is the sense to crucify?
Jesus stopped and looked at me
The empty hands and mistery
What can I do? How can I save?
Yes, I know - it's too late.
It's too late...
