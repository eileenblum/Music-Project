Take me for a ride
If you're riding fast
I just want to feel now
That cool touch of death
I want to be more, crazy
Than liquid silver
And maybe we're changing
The wheels into, the wings
[Chorus:]
Oooooh,
Make me feel, like a Harley's soul.
Take me for a ride
if you're riding fast
Treat this dusty highway
Like a woman in your be
Like a girl who wants to fly
Make it with her now
And maybe you're changing
Her body into the flame
