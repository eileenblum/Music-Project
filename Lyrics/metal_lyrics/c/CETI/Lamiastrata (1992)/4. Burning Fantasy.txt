High in the sky, and deep in the ground
There are some things that no one can found
Cause man thinks - it must be one real thing.
Time after time men looking for that
Ancient ghosts are ready to fight
Cause they know - that would be deadly for a man.
Moving on dangerous place
Seeking for somebody else
Who will be teacher of mine
And give me important sign
Burning wheels and red bloody knifes
Stands on the way to last Gate of Rights
Cutting your mind - and you must feel like a dust
Much time and more human lives
Dying with cry and crying with fear
And they've known - that it was deadly for a man
[Chorus]
It's only history Burning in fantasy Present in mystery Of live.
