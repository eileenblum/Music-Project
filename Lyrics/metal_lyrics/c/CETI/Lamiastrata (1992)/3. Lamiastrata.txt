High
In the mountains
The castle
In the clouds
I'm a little boy
Who want's to be yours
Look up
A t me
Look up
I'm a servant of your soul.
I'm sleeping
In your dreams
I'm freezing
In your arms
If you want me
I'll please you
If you want
I'll die
Look up
At me
Look up
I'm a servant of your soul.
Time has passed
And I wonder
How to meet you again
High in the clouds
I don't see that
Castle,
Castle in the clouds.
You are gone
My love
You're gone forever
I'm a servant of your soul
Lost forever.
