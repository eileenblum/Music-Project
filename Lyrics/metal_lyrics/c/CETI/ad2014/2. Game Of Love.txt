Now star of the heaven
Spiders trap of the night
You're the power and I see
Cobra's body you give me
Creeping through my dreams

I try again
Deep inside we need

Oh, you must know inside I'm burning
Ecstasy shows us, shows us the ways
You know it's turning
Keep going on, make me a stranger
Ecstasy shows us, shows the ways
Shows us the ways

Leave me now, you're hungry
I'll feed you with meat
Let me drink the night
We believe in heat
All we need is our bodies

All I know I'm sure
Fight the fear and lies
Wisdom of our hears

Oh, you must know inside I'm burning
Ecstasy shows us, shows us the ways
You know it's turning
Keep going on, make me a stranger
Ecstasy shows us, shows the ways
Shows us the ways

Now star of the heaven
Spiders trap of the night
You're power and I see
Cobra's body you give me
Creeping through my dreams

I try again
Deep inside we need

Oh, you must know inside I'm burning
Ecstasy shows us, shows us the ways
You know it's turning
Keep going on, make me a stranger
Ecstasy shows us, shows the ways
Shows us the ways
