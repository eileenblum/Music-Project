Yesterday came the end
Of my crusade
When I was at her place
Someone was watching me from far away
She was to be my last victim
He called "Hey, what are you doing?"
Now my days are passing slow
Behind iron prison door
I can't hear the hum of the street

That guy was a policeman
He saw that I wanted to kill her
And he called "Hey, what are you doing?"
All the other girls I stabbed with a knife

You may say "A psycho, a murder!"
But what will you say of Bush, Reagan, Hussein
And other rules of this world
You will say "How is that? You are sick!"
Those girls should not have been born
They were whores
Their fate was predestined
They were wasted of human civilization

He shouted "Hey, what are you doing?"
And aimed the barrel of his gun
Straight at my head
He was determined
It would be IN THE NAME OF LAW again
The open eyes of the jury
I see in them the image of electric chair
The end of my crusade
God calls to me "Hey, you come here!"
