Moon behind the clouds they know
It's gonna be the same
Live for every hour breath
Run someplace else

Destiny of dull exiles - all the time
Cry the song of march they have step
Up through the night

Look for ghost of wood, yeah
Shadow over sky
Take away the fright now
Like the other nights

Still and lust for food they fight go
See they know the time will come
Choice is done, so run

Here it is another spell
Time to get need again
Don't look back for what's been done
Kill for life, die in vain
Leave it all it's hard to try anyway
Deep inside we all need ride
So now let 'em run

Beware it's not the choice
OOOOOOO
Surely not desire

Cross a way long time ago
Shall we then
Stop this show for dreams
Hazy waves
Long for life without this whole
Insanity
Hope to hear from it again,
There's the place they come

The place they come 
OOOOOOO
Surely not desire

Here it is another spell
Time to get we need a gain
Don't look back for what's been done
Like the other nights

Cry the song of march they have step
Up through the night
Hope to hear from it again,
There's the place they come

Destiny of dull exiles
All the time
Shadow over sky
Get away
