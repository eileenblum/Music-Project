Madness in your eyes
See your velvet lies
All you need is dirty heart

Living in a world
Here it comes to fall
Day is done and see they come

See they come

Saw the sight of land
Lady and a map
They can't go away or turn

Sign of morning sun
New day just began
Everybody calls beware

Calls beware
In the land of hope
Calls you can't
In the land of hope

Look for every night
Saw the brighter light
Mother love and falling lines

Feel the way you shine
Way you shine
In the land of hope

Way you die
In the land of hope
Way you die
In the land of hope

Life you found and tears you cried
They're always by your side now
Holy fight's breaking all our life
We're empty and cold like knife

Brightest light and the darkest night
Will always out of sight
See now the time for us call them to blame
Take it now the will of hidden gods

Life you found and tears you cried
They're always by your side now

Holy fight's breaking all our life
We're empty and cold like knife

Brightest light and the darkest night
Will always out of sight

We all lived for hazy truth we need
It's certain game that's enough
Now we must wake to start
