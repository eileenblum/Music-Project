Forever and ever
I'm gonna live in you
And days we never knew

Forever and ever
The light in you I've got
The love we cannot fight

You came along and stay
We share the night and day
Forever!

Forever and ever
Do like the night before
I'll meet you then once more

Forever and ever
Let's see it in the sky
We don't say our goodbyes

You came along, and stay
We share the night and day
Forever!
The years are passing by
Should we decide to try
Forever!

Forever and ever
Do like the night before
I'll meet you then once more

Forever and ever
Let's see it in the sky
We don't say our goodbyes

We're children of the night
Bright shadows in your eyes
Forever
The years are passing by
Should we decide to try
Forever!
Forever!
