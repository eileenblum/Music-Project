Through the eyes of the lost
You can see the face
Leave the world now
All you knows away

Something shoves you
Must go this way
Now you hear it
You can see the days

Your mind is dazed oh
The time is through now
And all you want is take a breath

And it's near you feel
It's going to be done
They remain,
Hold on, they don't smile

Go ahead yeah
Far away that's a task
From the darkest and
Brightest Human sky

You will see the place that's over
And there's the hidden over
Awaits for you
In crimson fire

You'll recall the tales of wisemen
Words you know are dyin'
In the end they
Are the speech of liars

You will see the place that's over...

Your mind is dazed oh
The time is through now
And all you want is take a breath
