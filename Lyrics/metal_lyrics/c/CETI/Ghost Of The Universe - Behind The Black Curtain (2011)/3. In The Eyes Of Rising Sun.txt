In the eyes of the rising sun
See the while when it's all begun
Turn to stone we can only see
Till the end when must agree

In the eyes of the rising moon
Hear the sound the unspoken croon
Deep in well of the trust we fell
Smell the rot, oh smell black rain

Long ago there it was the crime
They want god, now they have to hide
Pray to know what now we can do
Lookin' for yes blackened truth

Ridin'
To the soulshine
Gonna grab it
Have to take it

Searching for solution
There's the way now
Need to have it

In the eye of the rising sun
Fools awake with the bloody guns
Full of dreams we can only watch
Live for ghosts, yeah, hazy ghosts
