This lousy screaming again
It hurts like thousands before
They say it's nice
I know the score

This is spell of mine
Another brick in wall
Another dream that must die
This is my private war

Justice

Now I'm mighty 'n' high incredible
So far I can do anything
Let me know sweet and lovely god
What's wrong with that bloody stuff

Saw black sun with its dirty light
Try go on, stoned unholy knight
Shining on now see me fly
Yes, I'm sure we're afraid of fight

I guess we all have time to call insanity
Leave me now to break the spell of trying
Drown my thoughts in wine of joy and sanity
Show me what you need look out

Take me there, it's in your eyes
Running free I'm out of rights that's all
Watch me out beware of lies
Liars know you can never walk without
Their gloomy hope
This is the spell of mine
Another brick in wall
Another dream must die know that you
Are right
Saw black sun with its light
Try go on unholy knight

I guess we all have time
Leave me now to break the spell
