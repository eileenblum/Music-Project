Well, my life the road of dreamer
Child of the moon with bright eyes
Too late for waiting
Have no time

Head for days if they gonna come
Tried all the ways
But my whole wisdom fades
Anywhere

Lord I know you're patient
Was something wrong
I have no words for you
I have no prayer

Had those wasted nights
It's always the same
The shadow over oh Lord
Anywhere

The night is come
Another road
Though all the ways I know I'm lost

I cannot scream
You know the cost
Of life that always finds a mock

Diamond star can you hear me
Do I have to cope with all the load

Trace of love let me find you
I can't help the way we're gonna fall

Beware of place
Unholy voice
The spell of lonely one that leaves
No choice

The fate of mine
Is crazy deal
I know there are the things you cannot heal

Breathed the air running wildly
Feel the heat around me
Feel its soul

Going down like a chaser
I don't feel like wasting it
Have to go

I have to go
