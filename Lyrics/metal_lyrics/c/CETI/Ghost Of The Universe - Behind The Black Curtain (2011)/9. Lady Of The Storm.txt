See her fly
Wonder why 
Mighty storm
Coming down

From the night
Purple sight
In the power
Soon we'll know
Sure we soon will know

Walk the line
Crime for crime
Count the lost
That's her toast

Said: you see
Deep in me
Lady luck
Hit the smack

Lady of the storm

Strong as tide
Sharp and wide
Look at her
Saw you there

On the rocks
Shakin' guts
Has to come
She goes, goes

Lady of the storm

What you want to do
Doesn't matter now for you
Bloody prayers sad and fair
So she's here such a fear

Lady of the storm

See her fly
Wonder why
Mighty storm
Coming down

From the night
Purple sight
In the power
Soon we'll know

Lady of the storm
