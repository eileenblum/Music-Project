Time,
Which lives in us
Change the way of life,
Change the body and blood

Run,
Through thousand years
To touch you
Be close
To your mouth.

Only, night
Living in my heart
And hurts every day
Makes the tears dry

Ice,
Around only wind
I hear silent voice
I'm alone...

[Ref:]
I'm dying alive
To hear you, between my thoughts
I'm giving all my days, to kiss you -
All my days...

Time,
Close the doors
I don't know anything
Don't know anything

Ice,
Around only wind
I hear silent voice
I'm alone...

[Ref:]
I'm dying alive
