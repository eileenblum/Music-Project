Suddenly I became alone, 
In the house, full of wounds, 
When it's raining in my heart 
The tears are fillers of my time

Beautifull was around,
the warm wind, the warm sun 
And your lips are so close, 
Like a dream, like voice
Suddenly I became alone 

Around emptiness, wind blows, 
You're not here, awaiting grows
You left me, I don't want to live 
Only nothing - how to live?

Now when I'm sitting alone, 
Empty house,
full of wounds, 
The tears are fillers of my time
Only nothing - should I die?

Now sad dream is over,
Only letter,
You will read...
I know...
Maybe fear will rule the dream,
Will you say something about me...?
Dream...
