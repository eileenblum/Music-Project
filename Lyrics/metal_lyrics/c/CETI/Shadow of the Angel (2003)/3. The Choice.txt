Walking down the street,
With an empty heart,
Looking for love,
To live, to belive
You have your nest,
Where you're cover up,
Your love is secretive,
But you want it!

[Ref: ]
Do you want it??
Do you want it??

You're sitting alone,
In the place wet of tears,
Awaiting in silence,
When this day will come?!

"Nothing" don't exist,
Always, something have to be,
What's worth to believe,
What you're missing every night.

[Ref:]
Do you want it??
Do you want it??

The sun rise again,
With him, the new day,
Full of hope,
But you're scarred anyway.

Looking for yourself,
You're breaking last thread,
You can keep on fighting,
You can die... or live!!!
