You're looking forward, and you see your last day.
You think about the life, but you life like a stone!
No strenght - you break them.
Silence in fear - hidden pain,
You're going to the end,
Will there still, anyone wait?

[Ref.:]
Life, Life, Life and the throne.

Like an angel's shadow, which you can't touch,
Like a passing day, which you can't defeat,
Like a furrows on the face,
Reminds, that your time has passed away,
You're going forward, into the bright space,
Angels' shadows are waiting still - yeahh!!!.

[Ref.:]
Life, Life, Life and the throne.
