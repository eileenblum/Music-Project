When I see my face,
In the mirror again,
I see the days...
Around me almost
Nothing
It was just mistake...

My thoughts are lost somewhere
Too far
I know it's the end,
What to say,
Or to affraid?
Sleep in peace, time will come.

I see the world,
Around me,
Which makes me fear,
Only one word in my mind:
TREASON !!!

I live to fear,
To be lost
Maybe I will save...
Maybe I will save just you

[Ref.1:]
Living and running,
Live against the wind,
Don't believe in other place,
Because you're away,
You are away.

Stand up and shout,
You need to stand up,
Not everything is lost
Wanna live in fear!?
Time has come.

Some voice is calling you,
Start to walk forward,
Believe in your destiny,
Save your self,
Save your self...

[Ref.2:]
Living and running,
Live against the wind,
Don't believe in other place,
Because you're away,
Remember your name
Look behind
Live in peace...

You don't know what to say,
While standing face to face,
With the non understood -
You feel the fear,
You feel the fear...

Take your chance,
Take the days,
Take the moment,
Run into your dreams.

[Ref.2]
