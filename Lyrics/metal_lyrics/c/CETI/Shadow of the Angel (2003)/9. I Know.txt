Yes
When the night comes down,
They wake up on your dreams,
The strange shadows...

Sadness again,
When like a butterfly,
Like a wind,
You sail far away...

Now.
Now the fog wraps you up,
Far away from the day,
You see someone...

Is he this one,
He, who every night,
Left his home away,
And you gave him lips...

I see in my dreams,
Like you see me,
Your body and shadow,
I want to kiss...

Hand,
I draw and you,
Don't see me, and tears,
Will sail to me...

[REF:]
Yes, you can,
Touch the dreams,
Touch the lips

Today,
When I dream about you again,
When I see you on my dreams,
I don't know why?
Flash, and opened doors,
I draw my hand,
And you,
Don't see me...
