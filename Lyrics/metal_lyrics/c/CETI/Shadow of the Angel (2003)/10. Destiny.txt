You raise
Like a bird
Above the clouds
Above the fear

Above the world
Of "wild dogs"
To escape
Like a wolf

Dense fogs
Of humans' lie
Your faith
Is your treasure

Can't find yourself
Looking for a day,
Fighting.
You can pay

[REF.:]
You're finding own way
You're dreaming about the end

Day's bright,
Golden glare,
Our fate
Not too late

Raising
Like a bird
Fighting
You can fall!!!

[REF.:]
You're finding own way
You're dreaming about the end

Alone - taking your prize
Alone - when the end will come

Day's bright,
Golden glare,
Our fate
Is living in us

Raising
Like a bird
Fighting
You can fall!!!!!!!
