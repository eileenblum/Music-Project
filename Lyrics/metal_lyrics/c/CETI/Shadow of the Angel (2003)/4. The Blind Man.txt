Live's flying away -
Fly away the sense
Looking for silence,
The way through fear,
I'm looking for stars,
I'm swimming like a blind man,

Time's like a river,
While swimming through dreams,
Suddenly I see,
In my live,
Someone's tears.

[REF.:]
Time to die
Time to fly
I'm blind man
Time to die
Time to fly
I'm blind man

What do I have?
What do I want?
To which people gave myself?
Every day,
Every pain -
- I lost the next role again.
What is the time?
What is a lie?
What a lie do love me now?!

[REF:]
Time to die...
