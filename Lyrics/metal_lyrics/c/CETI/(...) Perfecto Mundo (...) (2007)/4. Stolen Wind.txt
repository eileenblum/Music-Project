I â€˜d like to stop time,Only for usHold your hand, touch your face, you and me yeeaahhh!!!! Like dust in the windor a stolen angel's wingLike mist in the air, and to be like the wind! No pain in my heart, I forgive youIn your love I will fallI believe youNo cold painful heart - in your soul I want to liveAnytimeBe with youTo the endOf time Chorus:Is this world like a beast?Like a dead rose, and cold human tearsWhy do they want to stop us?Do you know?There was fear in my heart No fear in my soul, I belive you'cause your love's everything!Yes, I tell you!I would likeTo stop timeBe with youTo the end of my time...
