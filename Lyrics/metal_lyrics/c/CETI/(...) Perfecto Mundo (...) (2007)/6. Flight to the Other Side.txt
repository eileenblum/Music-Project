You're afraidOpens the door to the unknownOnly longing for past past Fear againHugs you like a friendPuts a mask on your face Darkness around - again You dive into the well of dreamsCollect your thoughts Lose your days Slowly daylight vanishesYou're left alone, can't see the endAnd now you understand Time to dieAn unreal, silent scene Silent sigh of dead lungs Candlelight is fading nowYou can feel a freezingÂ  breezeCarring you into the dreams Sunken in daylightLike a dazzled bird You put a mask on your face The whole world around youFull of shades of people's livesFull of truth to the endAnd unreal to the tearsAs distant as the landThat cannot be seenWhere the end has its limitsWhere the limits of the end
