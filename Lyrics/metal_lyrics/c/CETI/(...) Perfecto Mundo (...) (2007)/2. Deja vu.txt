You and me, we run together through the skiesWe can see the chaos in their sad eyesÂ Â  When we're here - all is calm There! We can see our home! Hurricanes are raging, but our lives find us together Sometimes I really feel, like weCan't understand our whole lifeWhat's going on out there, down on the seaWhen on the angels' wings, we fly  So high, above the wind and clouds Did our lives lose their sense, (and) their light? Do you feel it , can you see, that was just a momentAs they say, it will soon be backAgain people, they will return Everyone has their way of lifeA mission that must be complete And now when you take my handYou give me your smile, do you feel it, can you see...Do you feel it, can you see , that was just a moment Can you feel it, do you see, that was just a momentSometimes I really feel, like weCan't understand our whole lifeÂ  What's going on out there, down on the seaWhen on the angels' wings we flySo high, above the wind and cloudsÂ  Did our lives lose their sense, and their light?Â Â  Do you feel it, can you see, that it was just a momentI am safe now, because I know, It was just a dream of my wild heartSomewhere in my mind, I still remember, human lives and theirÂ  pain Love can be like (a) deadly poisonBut they will tell you, it so sweet
