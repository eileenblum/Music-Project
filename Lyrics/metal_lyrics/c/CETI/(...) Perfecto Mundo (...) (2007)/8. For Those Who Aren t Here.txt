I remember the lost days, when my time like falling rain, like falling rain.Time's closed eyes cryingÂ Â  Father, so far away... So far away... Every second like a dreamÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â  Wonderful was everythingEverything We used to catch the days, and the wind... Now lost days?All those days?Â  Â  My whole life, like (a) sparkling rainbowÂ  Or like flaming holy skiesCan you see what's in my soul?Â Â Â  Can you see what's in my heart? It was so different to meÂ Â  The world so full of loveÂ  I didn't feel the pain nor the wounds And the fear couldn't come to meNo evil wind that I could feelÂ Â Â  No way someone could leave me  My whole life, like (a) sparkling rainbowÂ  Or like flaming holy skiesCan you see what's in my soul?Can you see what's in my heart? I remember the old days, when my time was burning bright like aflameÂ Â Â  And their time came to an endÂ Â  They all left me, passed away  I'm standing on the crossroads - and I will touch the skyHow many words will make my tears dry, and will give me time?  And I am all alone, the sorrow burns my faceI don't know, what will happen - do I have some more days?  What is sad will pass awayOnly clouds will stay All the grief that froze my heart Will go awayNo more sorrow in my face And will come the new days My heart will be calm at lastÂ Â  And I will be calmÂ Â Â Â Â
