I can't find my peaceThere is something missing from my lifeNo wishful dreamsNot even lies Day after dayI see people, places all the sameThey all drive meinsine Thinking of youHave you ever been in my life?Now you've forgottenour time Looking for you again And I realise that I won't find such lips Such my eyes I can't touch my dreams Can't hold in my arms I can't shed any tears shed any tears I'm too weak, I give upThe world beforeWas my paradise lostI'd have never let you go Never let go At any cost  (I) can't believe it's gone you are no longer mine but still hope to meet you Some other time Some other life
