Can you see her, slender and pale?
But so graceful she walks down the stairs
A perception of musk fills the air
The kiss of darkness, the baron's own heir

In the tower...shadows lurk
Full moon power...the Baroness' noble sleep
The daily escape...nature's mistake
Soon awake...ready for her nightly slay

She's so ruthless...evil, grotesque
In her glory...the Baroness...godless
Blood is precious...so delicious
Vampire white...ferociously vicious breed

Her heart is bleeding, time is fleeing
She's barely breathing, Baroness...you're an ancient rest
Now in shock, surprise in stock...
You can't stop the clock...soon extinct like the pest

The Bleeding Baroness
Hours of slumber
Just before she will take you and make you wish that you've never been born

The Bleeding Baroness
Crimes of passion
She needs you and feeds you and bleeds you with the rise of the moon

The Bleeding Baroness
Hours of slumber
The spell I'm under

Can you see her, slender and pale?
But so graceful she walks down the stairs
A perception of musk fills the air
The kiss of darkness, the baron's own heir

The white queen smiles, the creature's alive
Thirsty forever, thirsty and proud
Her teeth drip of red, slowly...down her chest
Blood is life, blood is death

What is the price for your beauty?
Who dies when you shoe all the jewels?
The morning comes like the tide
You wish you could turn back the time
There is no love in the chamber of blood
