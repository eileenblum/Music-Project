In the evening rain, I was standing outside...the hell opera
I've been there before, a while ago...with Nosferatu
Saw the execution of my tomorrow...saw it and bowed
In the theater, of hellfire...the inferno is now!

I am lost again, I lean against...the purgatory gates
To ease my suffering, you're offering...to unlock my fate
The black rhapsody, I cannot breathe...inside my tomb
The devil's centurion, my world goes boom...The Hammer of Doom

The Hammer of Doom

Ain't no sunshine where I go
I stand where no roses grow
Desperate in the Typhoon
Swinging the Hammer of Doom
