If I ever die, I'm begging you, please come with me
We're gonna groove into the blue
All the parasites,
Oh, just leave them, pigs can't fly
There's no tomorrow, no regrets, no goodbyes

I will fly into the sunset,
Way up high
Don't be sorry, nothing good I leave behind
You don't worry, evil lasts a 100 lifetimes
It won't happen to me
I'm immortal, I cannot die

Rivers will dry
Pillars will break
Hell feels like ice
The mountains will shake

If I ever die

The stars will drop from the sky
The gods will mourn me and cry
If I ever die

If I ever die

If I ever die
I wanna know when and why
