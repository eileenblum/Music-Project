[6:38]

I'm standing here in silence
This graceful place of peace
Watching the shadows come closer
The birds they sing no longer
The winds they blow no more
With fear of death
I'm waiting for the night to fall

The sun will set forever
One after one the stars they die
The rainbow has turned to black
Darkness has fallen in paradise

Love is lost in memories
All beauty and all light
Have vanished from the
Garden of delight
The Devil and his gift
The heart he stole away
But innocence was lost long ago

The morning will come no more
Our dreams are all gone
Midnight has come to stay
Darkness has fallen in paradise

Oh father please forgive us
Forgive us all our sins
Please bring your light
Again to lead our way
But my prayers are not answered
They fade out to die
And so does the last gleam of hope

The morning will come no more
Our dreams are all gone
Midnight has come to stay
Darkness has fallen in paradise

I know my death is near
Far beyond my dreams
My fate is waiting
To show me the light... I believe

...TO BE CONTINUED...
