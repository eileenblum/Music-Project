[7:47]

"Edge of time, the dawn of our heaven
All is black the return of the fallen angel
Amongst us, a devil is disguise
The preacher of the wicked
Establishing his kingdom"

A million souls so lost and damned
Alive but not so well
And the devil raised his hand
And sent them down to hell

Just like your father held your hand
He's watching over his creed
Damnation and death, they'll burn in flames
No matter how they plead

To you, coming for your soul

Just like a shepherd assembling his flock
This one rules hell's domain
Satanic force, Lucifer's power
Attack, and he will reign

To you, coming for your soul

Into the night we will go
Into the night we will go

Out from the night he comes
Saviour but black
"Won't you come, come and join us"?
You had better!
There's no time to beg for mercy
The devil says no, no
You'll be his faithful servant
This time on earth

Black is the devil, Antichrist
The Tempter damned your birth

Listen to the wicked, sell your soul
Forever hell awaits

Into the night we will go
