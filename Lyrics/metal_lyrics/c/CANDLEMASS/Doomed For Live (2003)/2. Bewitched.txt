Can't you see, the devil in me
Just take a look in my eyes
I will play for you, this wicked melody
It's magic will reach for your soul
It burns inside, no place to hide
This strange tune possesses your mind
It comes over you, and the nightmare is true
You'll enter the realm of the dark

You are bewitched... [x2]

Bewitched be delight, you'll reach the night
Dancing and singing to my fiddle
So take my hand, and understand
That no-one will see you again

You are bewitched... [x2]

I am the master of the enchanted tune
I'll play for your joy, for your soul, for you doom
My fingers they dance upon the strings like fire
Weaving a spell of my burning desire
Sing with me, meet your destiny
Set yourself free to the magic
So come with me, my kingdom to see
Believe me you're captured my friend

You are bewitched... [x4]
