In the winter cold I see the blood
Clotting slowly in the snow
Unsung heroes cry in the night
May they die before dawn

Broken banners mourn fallen crowns
Grieving swords lay all around
As the swan song touches the mountainside
Unseeing eyes look at you

Can't you hear it
Hear the sorrows wail
Oh, you can't see it
The newborn day

Impaled hearts welcome the end of pain
Black blood releasing warrior souls
Vultures circle around the fields of grief
Another graveyard, another tale
