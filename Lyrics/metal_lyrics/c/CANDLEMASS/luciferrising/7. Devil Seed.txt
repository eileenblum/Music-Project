100 devils, follow me 'round
From the craters of chaos to the promised land
Thick black choirs, voices to guide me
Demon heralds sitting beside me

A little seed planted eats through your soul
You're not worthy when you're afraid and alone
Without warning it stars to grow
Spreading sickness inside your bones

I am freezing, and I shake
How much more of this shit can I take
Yes I'm crazy, with flies in my mind
Hellish dreams, espace I must find

The devil's round the bend
Churns me down with fire
And I kill a friend

Sorrow, devastation
My glasshouse cracks in two
Panic, desperation
I die for you

Devil seed

The evil seed is growing
The cancer stream is flowing
The evil heart is granted
Satans will is planted

Still around facing the hopeless
Too much pain, and no way out
Once again doing the pointless
All these voices continue to shout
