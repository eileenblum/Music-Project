[1st Verse:]
One day I saw a man
Dressed in rags, with a staff in his hand
Begging for a penny to survive

[2nd Verse:]
How poor a man can be
I gave him hospitality
A room, a bed and lots of food to eat

Still I hear his last few words
"I can never return what you've done
Heaven will remember and repay"

Fifty years had gone since I saw him
I was dying and I'd soon be dead
Three angels stood in front of me bed
The first one she said to me, don't be afraid

I will give you immortality, and grace for your soul
The second had eyes of gold, she gave me my wings
The third gave all wisdom, and angel could give
...to me

[Repeat 1st Verse]
[Repeat 2nd Verse]

I joined with my destiny, eternally
I knew I was born again, an angel to be
A vision beyond my dreams, called me by name
So in devotion I spread my wings, to heaven I had came
...to stay
