In the dunes of Egyptian sand
In the cities and small towns
The word goes from land to land
The dawn of enlightenment is here

Oh blessed the children of doom
As they dance on the meadows
Oh poet and merchant and witch
You know the master is here

Lucifer, Lucifer, Lucifer Rising

The caravan reaches the port
And they sail down the river
To praise and witness the birth
of the king the one that will come

Black worship in church and home
Seek their way to power
And free them from chains of Rome
To Shout the name of The Lord

Lucifer, Lucifer, Lucifer Rising

In the dunes of Egyptian sand
In the cities and small towns
The word goes from land to land
The dawn of enlightenment is here

Oh blessed the children of doom
As they dance on the meadows
Oh poet and merchant and witch
You know the master is here

Lucifer, Lucifer, Lucifer Rising
