"Beyond all nightmares I met my fate
An ancient passage surrounded by hate
Scared I was with my hand on my cross
I went into the demon's gate"

Across the Styx among the mists of Hades
A gate of stones marks the path
To soul's damnation and hell's wrath

Ancient evil is awaiting there, at the doorstep to hell
Within its darkness the demons dwell

From the dark age the passage hail,
Created by witchcraft and hate
Where every sinner will meet his fate
The place is cursed by the hands of doom
Unholy powers in reign
The devil's paradise of pain

Approach!
The Eibon opens for you
The choirs of damnation, call you on through
The twilight possesses, the heart of your soul
The starlight is fading to black,
Into the demon's gate
