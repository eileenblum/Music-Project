...Deep was my anguish and for these words
They froze my blood and changed my soul
The master has spoken the truth, not any lies
The Devil gives and evil takes
The thing in life that man forsakes
A throne in hell, a price or a sacrifice?

Still the wind was blowing soft
And gentle here under the oak
Which gave me shelter and rest in for my trial
I'm not strong, weak is my mind
A new beginning, where to find?
I'm the last one on earth, please forgive us our crime

It was a time, when love was mine
Now it's time to sacrifice

My heart, bleeding for my race
The traces of mankind sweeped out by the hand of our Lord
I cried for the ones I have lost
Midnight in paradise, grief, away goes my hope

I cried for the ones I lost

Hear my prayers, climbing on the clouds above
Silent cry, reach the inner halls of truth
Give me a sign!
Sign!

A crimson sky, bless my eyes
Up goes the sun, my time has come
