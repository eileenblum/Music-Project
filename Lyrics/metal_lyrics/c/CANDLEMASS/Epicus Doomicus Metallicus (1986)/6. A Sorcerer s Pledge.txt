[Part I]

Time...
Time stands still in these ancient halls
Only the castle itself can tell what it keeps
Dark are the secrets between these walls
Hidden in shadows of death, while the sorcerer sleeps

Where is the morning, where is the sun
Thousand years of midnight, the sunrise is gone

An old man marked by a life so long is
Sleeping so sweet while his magic is growing so strong
Waiting still for new times to come
A thousands years to see if he has won

Where is the morning, where is the sun
A thousand years of midnight, the sunrise is gone

What has he done?
Why is he sleeping so long?
He wants to live for evermore
Soon is he young
n will he open his eyes?
When he is strong enough to rule

Back in the time goes the legend
of a sorcerer so old
He drank the blood of the virgin to be reborn
"Soon a tyrant will conquer"
So spoke the wise
Of the day when the sorcerer will rise
...rise

Blood is his wine
The sorcerer is cheating time
And he'll be stronger than before
Cursed be the sun
The women will weep for his fun
In the name of his magic so strong

Back in the time goes the legend
Of a sorcerer so old
He drank the blood of a virgin to be reborn
"Soon a tyrant will conquer"
So spoke the wise
Of the day when the sorcerer will rise
... Rise

[Part II]

A thousand years have gone
Armageddon hasn't come
Only the cry of a child echoes in the dark
Backward goes time
As the stars are passing by
And nothing remains of this foolish man except his fate
