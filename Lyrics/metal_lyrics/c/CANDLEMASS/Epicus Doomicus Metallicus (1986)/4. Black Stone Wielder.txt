The rain kept on falling and darkened the sky
The dawn was to come with the sunrise
Revealing the shadows that passed through the mist
The torchlight was flickering,
The storm was chasing them on

A procession of dark coats followed the star
Foretold to come since ages
In silence they walked on crossing the lands
On their way to Bethlehem,
To break the chains of the spell

Stone, they worshipped the stone
In generation from father to son
A star, a star is to come
To light them way to the one who is born

The leader he knelt there to greet the newborn
Holding his pendant before him
Teardrops were falling from his eyes as he said:
"Take this stone and use it well, don't do as I did long ago"

Into the sundown he returned
The moon was rising and heaven burned
Like shadows disappeared the men
And the black stone wielders were never seen again

Stone, they wielded the stone
In generation from father to son
A star, a star is to come
And light them the way to the one who is born

They came across the western sea
With powers greater than needed
The wizards commanded the lightning
Every creature knelt in for their will
But they wielded the black stone with evil
And their evil was cast back on them
Damned to praise god forever
'til his son was born to deliver

Stone, they wielded the stone
In generation from father to son
A star, a star is to come
And light them the way to the one who is born
