Black heart, your soul is mine (...mine, mine)
Gaze into and the secrets you'll find (...find, find)
Just read the signs

Gaze into the crystal, see what it tells
It can bring you all fortune, do you so well
Visions and dreams you can see in the Crystal ball

I saw the rainbows end
I am raptured, I cannot pretend
I've found Atlantis
The talisman of Seth

Gaze into the crystal, see what it tells
It can bring you all fortune, do you so well
Visions and dreams you can see in the Crystal ball

The Crystal ball
In the Crystal ball

I've seen it all, gazed into the crystal ball
Tell me more, I want to know
Please hear my call

Gaze into the crystal, see what it tells
It can bring you all fortune, do you so well
Visions and dreams you can see in the Crystal ball

The Crystal ball
The Crystal ball

... Crystal ball
