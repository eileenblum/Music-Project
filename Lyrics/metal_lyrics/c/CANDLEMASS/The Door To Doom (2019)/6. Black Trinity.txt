Agents of abomination
Trinity of the damned
One devil that kills, one that takes
One that calls me his son

The wave will hit you soon
The ambassadors of doom

Black trinity - tidal wave
Black trinity - until we close our days
Black trinity - set me free
Black trinity - imagery or reality

Hell's disciples, lords of disaster
From the pits they're marching faster
Flaming angels on burning thrones
In Sheol's golden semi dome

The wave will hit you soon
The ambassadors of doom

Black trinity - tidal wave
Black trinity - until we close our days
Black trinity - set me free
Black trinity - imagery or reality

Tyrants of hurt, nails in the spine
Walking the earth, the dirty divine
Gothic idols in human guise
They keep on truckin' 'til the sparkle dies

Black trinity
Black trinity
