Behind the droll
The ocean flow
Beneath the eye will surface
There's a hole

The deadly climb
An endless line
And there you are
Night after night

[?]
Cemetery waters
Just like lemmings, glowing spirits
The day of the weak now
Never fucking tolerate
Echoes be gone
Lift the garden off my mind

The dead shall walk
Out from the lifeless dark

[?]
Ghost of silence, hands holding fire
Debt collector, reparations in the morning
[?] ocean, no one said you were coming

The dead shall walk
Out from the lifeless dark
From under my skin
The ocean will end

Lie drunk and sway
From the salty grave
Sixty thousand slaves under rain
Stars align
Clouds sweep by
Soon the bleak and forgotten will arrive

Debt collector, reparations in the morning
Just like lemmings, glowing spirits
The day of the weak now
Watch all the falling rain
Echoes be gone
Lift the garden off my mind

The dead shall walk
Out from the lifeless dark
From under my skin
The ocean will end
The ocean will end
The ocean will end
