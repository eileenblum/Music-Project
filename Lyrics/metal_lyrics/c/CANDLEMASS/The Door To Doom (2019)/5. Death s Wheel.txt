In the absence of bible and king
I close my gaze, 'fore one last good spin
Resurrection, sermon, or prey
I'm a Jonah in the throat of the whale

Charon waves, grins from his oar
I am snow-blind, the frost of the north
Tomorrow's sun falls to the sea
As the reaper's got his hand on the wheel

Come come closer
The wheel is spinning round and round
I'm so alive
Tonight the palace bleeds
Heaven or hell
Right or left, life or death
Come come closer
The wheel is spinning round and round

Crucified in the gallery of screams
Another fool on the carousel of dreams
I licked the stars as an enemy of time
Now I'm here, and every second is mine

Come come closer
The wheel is spinning round and round
I'm so alive
Tonight the palace bleeds
Heaven or hell
Right or left, life or death
Come come closer
The wheel is spinning round and round

In the absence of bible and king
You live and die for one last good spin
Resurrection, sermon, or prey
I'm a Jonah in the throat of the whale

Come come closer
The wheel is spinning round and round
I'm so alive
Tonight the palace bleeds
Heaven or hell
Right or left, life or death
Come come closer
The wheel is spinning round and round
