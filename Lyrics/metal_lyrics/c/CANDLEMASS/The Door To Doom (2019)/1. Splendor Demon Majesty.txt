Good morning, demon majesty
You shine like a diamond, you are
One of the three, the epiphany
The father, the rising star

You give the satanic symphony
I know that you're titanic and black
I feel your love, the affinity
I'm glad your highness is back

I know your venom is winning
Master of shade and shame
Will you give us a new beginning
Or just orchestrate the end?

Open the gates
Splendor demon majesty
Hear the doomsday bell
A grand wonderful fantasy
Oh, you wear the pall
Splendor demon majesty
You, you are my all
A celebration of sin
You are

Good morning, demon majesty
The king of kings you are
Lead us into seduction
Bringer of truth and shock

In the light of the tortured horizon
Doom's in your eyes
There you stand at the devil station
Death draws nigh

Open the gates
Splendor demon majesty
Hear the doomsday bell
A grand wonderful fantasy
You, you wear the pall
Splendor demon majesty
You are my all
A celebration of sin
You are

Splendor demon majesty
A grand wonderful fantasy
I sold my soul
I sold my soul
To the sound of 666
