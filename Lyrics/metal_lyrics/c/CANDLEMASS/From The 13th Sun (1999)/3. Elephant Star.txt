Drifting from the prison planet
I fell inte the 13:th sun
Way beyond all superscience known
Surfing through space and mantra
God of time and mercury
Our love will live inside the elephant star
They took me to the titan mother
A dream away from yesterday
Tomorrows world I slip into today
Centuries in firelight
I die with every winter tsar
Our love will live inside the elephant star
Paralysed and hypnotized
The big dog in the sky
Mystified, majestified I fly
I hide behind the silver fallos
The beacon to my instant doom
Our love will live inside the elephant moon
