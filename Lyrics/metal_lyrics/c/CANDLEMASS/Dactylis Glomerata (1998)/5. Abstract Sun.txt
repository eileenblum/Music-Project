Abstract sun, you're the Sanskrit in my book
Dominion, innocence and pride you took
As a god, I drink the beauty with my eyes
As a man, I do become what I despise
The first time I tried, I bled and I died
Out of the jar to this flamboyant star
Drawn like a moth, clutching because
The idol was there, I approached struck with fear
Locust sun, you're the apple and the pie
Appolyon, wrapped in ash and so am I
And I ask, do men cry or am I wrong?
Gone too far will I live to end this song?
Again now I crept, I saw and I wept
So near, still so far, I'm nothing at all
The last time was right, I gave you my life
The purpose I found and now I am gone
Into the Abstract Sun
