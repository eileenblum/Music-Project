Thunder and lighting, action, come fire, come rain
The wizard is playing god in his armchair again
Cyberlike snake eyes they burn
The man with the black cat will show us what tricks he has learned
Abraxas, Abraxas, he's building cathedrals of air
Climbing the skies like a madman because they are there
Magic master control
He's hiding in a secret black hole
Man of Miracles, who are you and what you can do?
Will you live forever in your den feeling so blue?
Magic master control
He's hiding in a secret deep black hole
