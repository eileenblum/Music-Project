The monumental sleep
With the sunrise at my feet
Where's the altar of the gods,
The wrath and the floods?

All is in vain

Of stars and of smoke I am
Of shade and of light
With dragons in every hand
I'm wading through life

From nothing I came before,
To nothing I go
I heard that wise man said:
"From presence to silence...we flow"

The rainbows in the sky
Soon their colours die
I see the birds of prey
They've been circling here all day

It's always the same

We live the eternal dream
The big and cosmic scheme
A part that we all play
To stand the last of days

It's all just a game

Of stars and of smoke I am
Of shade and of light
With dragons in every hand
I'm wading through life

From nothing I came before,
To nothing I go
I heard that the wise man said:
"From presence to silence...we flow"
