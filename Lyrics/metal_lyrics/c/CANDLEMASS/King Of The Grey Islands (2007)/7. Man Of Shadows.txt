2 âo clock, the basement doom shift
Afternoon and you dig in the black ditch
Comatose, turned offâs the light switch
Collector of grief, full scale deathwish

Everyday, a grey and sad day
I dip my love in soul pain
And still looking for things to detest
Beware of the love that youâll regret

And Iâm sitting here with my arms around me, arms around me
Iâm a bit surprised that you havenât found me, havenât found me

On top of mount failure, damned and ignored
I nurse the depressionsâ¦.... I know what Iâve lost
Anti-social process, with razors in the closet
On a suicidal mission, whatever the cost

The Lord of grief, â¦....no relief
The Lord of griefâ¦â¦.no relief

Man of shadows
The clouds bear your name
And your thought fade to greyâ¦. With
Days in shadow
The dark is the same
Butâs a whole different day for theâ¦..
