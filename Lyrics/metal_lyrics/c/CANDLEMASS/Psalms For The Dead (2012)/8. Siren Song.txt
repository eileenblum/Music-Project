I can hear the siren wail begin
Lovechants that'll bring me everything
Step out to the woods or let them in
The world goes numb when the sirens sing

I see the light high upon the hill
I'm drawn towards, I feel the sirens will
Have I becomea victim of the wild?
I wish I could sleep on like a child

At the gallows pole
Oh, you're swallowed whole
THE SIRENS WILL SUCK ON YOUR SOUL

The siren pack will feast upon my soul
Lick me dry and step over my bones
I can't resist, can't refuse no more
The sirens they will sing for evermore!

Where do the voices of angels come from?
deep down below or above?
Carols of crystal
Serenades of blood
Promising ETERNAL LOVE
