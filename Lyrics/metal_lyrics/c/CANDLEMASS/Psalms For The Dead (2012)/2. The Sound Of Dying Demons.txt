The fires... are fading... believe me.. it's so quiet...
But the darkness... is breathing... the horde's here... to steal the light!
the legions... are marching... they tell me... that you hear

Just when you thought that you were safe
A nice life...family..friends
The demons are gone without a trace
But HELL will speak to you AGAIN... AND AGAIN!!

THE SOUND OF DYING DEMONS
THE SOUND OF DYING DEMONS

So loud you can't take it no more
SATAN is standing outside your door
EVIL's been waiting for so long
The preachers of HELL were right and you were wrong!!

You thought the voices were dead
...you didn't listen...

THE SOUND OF DYING DEMONS
Here to touch your world
THE SOUND OF DYING DEMONS
Alive... will crush your world
