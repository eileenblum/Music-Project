Genocide destination
A scientific race
Symptoms of the evolution?
We're fresh out of the caves!

Bow and arrow, fangs and fur
Neanderthals and cars
We burned the flame and tamed the earth
Looked up to the stars

The dogs, the apes... the buffalo
The fire and the wheel
From Trojan wars to World War II
THE INVENTION OF STEEL!

There's time for sin, there's time for laughter
Wonders in the lab
Babylon is still a whore
But the best time that we had!

Who stoppped the clock?
Who threw the rock
THE KILLING OF THE SUN!

We see atom, the crates of Jupiter
A cure for cancer, science is the word
What is progress when the streets of London burn
Who are we fooling? the dance of LUCIFER!!!
