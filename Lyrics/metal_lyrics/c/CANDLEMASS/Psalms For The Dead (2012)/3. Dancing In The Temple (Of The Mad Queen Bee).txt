Dancing in the temple of the mad queen bee
Deep in the cinnamon forest
She offers me crickets, she offers me tea
In the court of her enchanted palace

Asks me if I wanna stay
Sing with the trolls and the fays
Swim in her emerald lake
I'm dancing in the temple of the mad queen bee

The jesters are weeping, the cyclops are gone
She sits on a throne made of bees
She's weaving at night, she's knits all day long
Her children made out of fleas

And there, in a state of trance
She sees me and gives me her hand
I see the ogre polish the rainbow
As i'm dancing in the temple of the mad queen bee

A sip from the well
I am locked in a spell
Trapped in a grim fairytale
Endless the fun
I wish I had a gun
But I'm dancing forever... from room to room...

We dance the fandango,
We do menuet
Waltz in her shadow palais
Listen to the strings of a goblin quartet
See the magic ballet

Asks me if I wanna stay
Sing with the trolls and the fays
Swim in her emerald lake
I'm dancing in the temple of the mad queen bee

A sip from the well
I am locked in a spell
Trapped in a grim fairytale
Endless the fun
I wish I had a gun
I'm dancing in the temple of the mad queen bee
