I built a virgin tower, I'm taking to the stars
I dream of ancient power, glimmers in my eyes
Four devils guide my steps and seven clears the day
To greatness, feast, excess, back to immortal days

I travel with the dragon to learn and tame the beast
I rule the pyramids, there's magic in the east

To fly and scheme, and harvest all the dreams
That leads to love and holy wars
There's evil... evil... EVIL IN MY MIND

I turn the secret page, I cross the sands of time
I see the kings of Thebe, got richness on my plate
The great and fabulous will kneel before my throne
I am the son of god, MY MADNESS IS MY OWN
