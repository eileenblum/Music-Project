Autumn wind... summers end
Leaves and grass is ageing,
as the water is as still and dark... as her eyes...

Lifeless pond... love is gone
Rains and cracks... the church is black
Ringing the hollow bells.. time after time...

WATERWITCH... WATERWITCH... WATERWITCH... 

Beauty wild... fathers weep
Little child is trapped in witches keep

Children play... Sean and Faye
All that's good is forgotten 
Angels tears can't save... the witches prey..

Oh... time is standing still
She is coming for the kill
Don't be fooled by her charms
The witch means death and she means harm


WATERWITCH... WATERWITCH... WATERWITCH...
