Time is short... time is endless
Time is linear but also a relative factor that
moves rather unnoticed from point A to B.
Time is a force not to be taken lightly....

Because time never forgets
Time heals nothing...
Time is a black hole that consumes energy,
ambition and love...
Time is dangerous!
Time... quite frankly... doesn't give a shit!
And above all... time is BLACK
It is your ENEMY!
Time is decline and decay... time is DEATH!

It follow you everywhere you go until it inexorably
leaves you behind
Time counts your every step... every year, month,
week and minute... tick tock tick tock...
And when the reaper breathes you in the neck...
it is there... stealing the very limited precious
shares of TIME that are left...

Slowly and almost unnoticed... second by second...
tick tock tick tock
tick tock... it continues the countdown closer to
your grave... until it finally STOPS!!

TIME IS BLACK!!

She's the truth, o hail the Queen
The universal binding seem
Life and death, every second
Kneel, thy majesty is present

Time will lead me to my grave
It never sleep...never saves
The queen of time rules, will see us fall

TIME IS BLACK... BLACK AS THE SUN
TIME IS BLACK... BLACK AS WINE

BLACK AS TIME
BLACK AS TIME
