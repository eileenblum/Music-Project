A secret basement hidden away from the world
She said I'm chasing what I can't have or what I can't do

The fortune, the fortune, the fortuneteller [2x]

The cards have spoken
I must go where no angels go
My will is broken
I'm the one that I don't wanna know

The fortune, the fortune, the fortuneteller [2x]

I saw the future, with a fateful gesture of the hand
I think it's really evil, make me do what you can't understand

The fortune, the fortune, the fortuneteller [2x]

The fortune, the fortune, the fortuneteller [2x]

And one last question:
Why is happiness just smoke in the blue?
Oh, fortuneteller, please tell me the bloody truth
