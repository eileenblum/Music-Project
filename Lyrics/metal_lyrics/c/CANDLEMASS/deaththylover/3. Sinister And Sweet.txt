Claws and little tail
Horns that points my way
Can evil be so innocent, frail?

Blessing in disguise
A shattering surprise
Do you know, you're the devil's own child?

Will you cross the sacred line?
Would you kill a butterfly?
Will you be a sign of our time?

When you leave the little cage
Don't believe you are safe
Where there's beauty, there will always be pain

I see the look on your face
I see the night in your gaze
Starless and discreetâ¦
So sinister and sweet

Hide the fear in your eyes
Morning light comes and dies
You're dangerous and neat
Sinister and sweet
