Buried deep under miles of ice
The sleeping giant frozen lies
Covered in frost since dogs could fly
Icy tear in star-drenched eye

Mountains die and mountains form
You see no light, no polar storm
His hammer smashed whole worlds to dust
The legend that was colossus

A god among the ants he was
But the people were afraid of course
He was the thing that should not be
A freak of nature, unhuman being

Solar raysâ¦ electric clouds
Thunder boltsâ¦ don't wake him up

Sleeping sleeping giant
Once you were a king
The lord of everything
Sleeping sleeping giant
You fell from silent skyes [sic]
Soon the sun will melt the ice

Sleeping sleeping giant
Chained under the earthâ¦
One day you will returnâ¦ yeah
