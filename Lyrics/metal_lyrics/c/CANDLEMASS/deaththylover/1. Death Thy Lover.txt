Death, he loves you more than anything
Walks behind you with black halo thing
In the dying hour, let the endless in
Face of immortal beauty, angel's wings

Death thy lover in the hollow, there's no other
He's your only friend and he's watching over you
Death thy lover... an adventure to discover
When you reconcile, he's a long cold kiss

Death is your life companion, mirror soul
And when your featherless wither, there's an oath
One last caress, a whisper, the wind that leaves its home
And there he is, your shadow. Fear no more.

In harmony, in tragedy,
I tried to run, but you won't leave
A superstar, a passenger dark
I am safe here in your arms

Death thy lover, in the hollowâ¦ there's no other
He's your only friend, and he's watching over you
Death thy loverâ¦ an adventureâ¦ to discover
When you reconcileâ¦ he is a long cold kiss
