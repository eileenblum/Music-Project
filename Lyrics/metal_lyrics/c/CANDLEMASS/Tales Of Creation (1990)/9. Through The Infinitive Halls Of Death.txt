I know that my old life is ending
very soon I'll lose my breath
But raise up high or slow descending
(is the question after death)
Death is a forecourt to hell,
where the lost of humanity dwell [x 2]

In the realm of the other side
I saw some spirits a force of might
Black and white and side by side
they will take me beyond the light

Death is a forecourt to hell,
where the lost of humanity dwell [x 2]

Through the shadows of my soul
walking in an endless cave
searching for a deep black hole

to find my destiny or grave
Death is a forecourt to hell,
where the lost of humanity dwell [x 2]
Doomed to hell
Misery and death, pain and sorrow
The air was poisoned by the smell of burning flesh
I saw the beast
A great shadow surrounded by black demons
Satan he laughed as he saw me burn
