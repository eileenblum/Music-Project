Someone stole the starlight from the backside of your hand
Weak without the magic you lay passed out in the sand
With controls set for night flights when witches ruled the world
In a twinkling moment you see cockroaches and crows

Go behind the great clouds if you want to stay the same
In nothing land you'll perish when they whisper aloud your name
A window full of trauma stares you in the face
You know it's time to scream now and leave this fucking place

So drunk and misled, face down in the mindless gutter
You puked and you bled, the lifeblood of the holy mother
Lame and astray, bloated in the crimson river
Needless to say, we are here to burn and wither

Come with me, walk with me
The voice of doom and new adventures
Love with me, love with you
The endless trip is what you're after
Blinding light, burning light
From excess to bitter laughter
Happiness, loneliness
Kneel before the disaster master

The night is almost over and still there you are
Half dead, numb and shipwrecked like a shooting star
Surrounded by black witches, you don't know what to do

Weak without the magic, the madness is killing you
