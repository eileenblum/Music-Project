[Bonus track]

Gasping, groaning,
Alone, I fell to the Earth,
But did the red moon?
I know it happened too soon.

Circling sun, life goes on.
I'm alive and I still want more.
Mars at war, Venus whore,
Take me now to the electric shore.

Last night kissing bullets,
It hurts, oh God, so it hurts.
I bargained with the Devil
Before I met with the storm.

Circling sun, life goes on.
I'm alive and I still want more.
Mars at war, Venus whore,
take me now to the electric shore.

Trumpets roaring the dead hails,
and a jackyl invades my bed.
Black deaths under the night sun,
I take all the Valium I find.

Circling sun, life goes on.
I'm alive and I still want more.
Mars at war, Venus whore,
Take me now to the electric shore.
