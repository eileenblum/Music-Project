You're hiding in your hall, alone with your hunger
Can't break through the wall, of the prison within
No reason to be proud, don't go so near it
You bow your head in shame, afraid you will fear it

Open up your dreams
Seven silver keys
To open up your dreams
You need seven silver keys

A war against yourself, you win or you lose here
Something new to fear or nothing to do
Paradise hotel, bombs in your cellar
Mr clean'n'safe, your guvenor of hell

Open up your dreams
Seven silver keys
To open up your dreams
You need seven silver keys

The vultures of the mind, the vampire guerilla
Invite the underground, give in to your self
Let loose the hounds of Hades, that means you can kill her
Unlock the secret wells, your life can begin
