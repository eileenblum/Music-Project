Mask of shadow's sole, liebst the night he owns
The grace of the beast, the solace of the sleet
A sea of colder rain, gives him life again
To hunt mortality, precious pearls of grief

Murder draped in dusk, the thief's not one of us
Came here with the shrouds, sweet talks, charms and bows
Feeds on your sorrow, drawn to the horror

Welcome... Assassin of light
How did you know, I didn't know
Save me, prince of the night
You kill and go, you steal the show
Blackout
Lights out

Out of blue thin air
He is in my lair
Say that I'm the one
Provides me with a gun
Soft like the willow
Leaves no trace
Hands me a pillow
Over my face

I'm excited so, the secret guest just showed
Felt that I was sad, the little wish I had
He stood behind the door, the hands of evermore
Lord of the weeping shadow, helped me see green meadows
