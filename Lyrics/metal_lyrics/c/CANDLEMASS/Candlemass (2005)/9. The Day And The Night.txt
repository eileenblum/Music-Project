I woke up with a scream in my throat
Something evil I saw then I choked
Never thought I would dream of LaVey
And never see the light of day

Then the dawn reeked of swine like a slut
I'm in bed as the light goes so dim
And the globe of ascent turned to sut
A new night came rolling in

When you come I greet you
We are the same
And we make love
In the dark

You can hide, I see you
The night's alive, I know
To survive, I need you
And you need me

You're cruel and corrupt
Please make it stop
I should be fast asleep but I'm still up
Nowhere to run
I know it has begun
I'm not sure I'll see tomorrow's sun

I ride the mare
To hell and back
In this madness
I sweat and burn

Every night I'm sleepless
Every hour a spell
Every minute a lost life
A year in hell

Yes, the day is the czar of the night
And the moon is the sun's other side
So the night is the scar of the day
And the shit won't go away

Sometimes long and wonderful
Sometimes cool and full of soul
Sometimes crude and grim and foul
The day is warm, the night is cold so cold

Lost in the dark
I'm lost in the dark
