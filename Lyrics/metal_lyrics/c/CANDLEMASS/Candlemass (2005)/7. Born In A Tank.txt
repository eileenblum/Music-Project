They buried me here in the winter
To an iron box I checked in
I've never heard birds or seen daylight
And nothing will ever come in
I'm happy to lie here in darkness
Naked safe, undisturbed
Floating blind in water
In my little world of dirt

I live underground, born in a tank, on a day I remember
Buried alive, like a dog, late December

I think there was a sound from a battle
And once I heard somebody scream
Today a knock on the door
It was just another bad dream
They want to keep me secure here
From a world in chaos I'm safe
I'm better off down in my small crate
Protected by maggots and rats

I live underground, born in a tank, on a day I remember
Buried alive, like a dog, late December
I live underground, born in a tank, in the midst of nowhere
Buried alive, like a dog, I was dumped and left there
