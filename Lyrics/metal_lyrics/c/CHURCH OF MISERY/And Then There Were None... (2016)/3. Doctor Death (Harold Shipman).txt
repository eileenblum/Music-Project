Outside death's door you wait
Entrance delayed - a cruel, sadistic fate
No absolution, no love from god
Slow suffocation, a mind eroding fog

Never ending agony
Incessant torment, no reprieve
I'm the master of your misery
Prescribing murder, merciful sleep

Massive morphine injection
Commiseration drips into your veins
As I release you from your affliction
I stare down upon you as you slowly fade

Never ending agony
Incessant torment, no reprieve
I'm the emperor of your pain
A gift of death shot into your veins

On the gurney waiting out your time
Death's reflection in your tired eyes
I push the needle in you start to slide
Into death's slumber, running toward the light

Incapacitated, stuck by fear
Waiting for death's angel to appear
Senseless suffering you pray to die
And cross the river to the other side

Close your eyes and all you see is red
Eroded sanity, in pools of sweat
Your body's withered, there ain't nothing left
I'll end your suffering I'm Doctor Death!
