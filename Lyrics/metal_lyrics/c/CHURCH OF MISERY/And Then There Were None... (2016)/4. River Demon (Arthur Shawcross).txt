Jungle nightmare defiled my soul
The things I've seen would make your blood go still
A wild beast, my heart is cold
Homicidal lust, a need to kill

Paranoid, war fantasy
Hunting down the enemy
Nefarious and serpentine
River Demon running free

There is no peace in my damaged mind
Powerless to quell my fatal urge
My murderlust has crossed the line
My violent tendencies begin to surge

Paranoid, war fantasy
Hunting down the enemy
Nefarious and serpentine
River Demon running free

Possession of my mind and soul
Ariemes takes control
I am her demonic thrall
Butcher, rapist, cannibal!
