All alone, abandoned, forsaken
Love and hope are only lies
In solitude, enduring my affliction
Disdain, abhorrence and despise
Left to die by my mother
She'll take her sorrow to her tomb
I filled her heart with revulsion
The day I clambered from the womb
Agony, bitterness and anguish
Compulsion growing day by day
Endless pain, misery and sickness
Disintegrating into rage!

Enslaved by lust - I want to watch you bleed!
I need to kill - I'm a murderfreak!

Abomination, I never should have been
My earthly presence is a sin
Desolated by my own flesh and blood
Left twisting in the wind

Emotionless, I turn to murder
Straight of face, indifferent
Stoney-eyed, dispense destruction
Unbridled butchery begins
Now I don't think about tomorrow
Cross my path, you've sealed your fate
Vagabond, coast to coast, I wander
A trail of corpses in my wake!

I search for thrills - death is what I seek!
Your screams, my dream - I'm a murderfreak

Perverted morality, dangerous mind
Dispensing the pain, suffocating all life
Smiling intently, I snuff out your lights
I take comfort in watching you die!
