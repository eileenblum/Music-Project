A curse from the gypsy, dark fortune told
"You're children all will die, before they're old"
Paranoiac mother, must defend their lives
Protect her babies, through human sacrifice

Now step inside and drink the wine

(My confession!)

You've come seeking fortune, within these tarot cards
Now take my sage advice - you won't get far, darling
My eldest son, sent to die at war
Black task upon these hands, (I must) even the score

You're put in a trance, I swing down the axe

(My confession!)

With deep, dark eyes and unblinking stare
An unrepentant, evil glare
With mad, barbaric inner pride
I recount the horrid ways they died!

Hacked up with a rusty axe
Boiled 'em down, skimmed off the fat
As Satan's child I paid the price
Consumed the blood of sacrifice!
