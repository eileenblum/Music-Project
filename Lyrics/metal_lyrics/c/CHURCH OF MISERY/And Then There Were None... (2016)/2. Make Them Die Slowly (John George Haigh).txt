Hulsting, gtifting, trickery, double-dealing and deceit
I did what I could to survive on these desolate streets
In cold-blood spite I murder, life just an abject game
I bludgeon you down if you have anything I can take

I'll hang you high and drain your blood
Sip on the nectar while your bones reduce to sludge
Submerge your carcass in the drum
Sulfuric acid bath, without a trace you're gone

Psychopath, vampire lunatic,
decadence burns in my brain
With no penitence,
I smile as I bring you pain
Enter my house of perversion,
a workshop of torment and death
Adrenaline pumps in my veins
as you draw your last breath

I'll hang you high and drain your blood
Sip on the nectar while your bones reduce to sludge
Submerge your carcass in the drum
Sulfuric acid bath, without a trace you're gone

I'll haunt your every sleepless night
And every time you close your eyes
Sick and depraved, defective mind
Everything I touch, dies! (in acid)

Make Em Die!
Make Em Die!
Make Em Die!
Slowly!

Make Em Die!
Make Em Die!
Make Em Die!
Slowly!
