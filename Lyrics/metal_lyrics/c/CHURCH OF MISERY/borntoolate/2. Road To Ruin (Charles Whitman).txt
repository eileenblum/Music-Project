[Songs by Tomohiro Nishimura &amp; lyrics by Tatsu Mikami]

Under cruel sunshine on 1966
Take a look to clear blue sky
My sanity has gone
I killed my mother at midnight
Then stab my wife to death
Ready for a final solution
Now I got a gun

My final day of summer
With my rifle, up to the tower
Take a look down to the ground
To searching for my target
15 people had died
Here, there and everywhere
No reason to kill someone
I just pull the trigger

Life's not worth living
If there's a hell you'll see me there
Hear my cry
Feel my fear
Still I'm in pain &amp; misery
