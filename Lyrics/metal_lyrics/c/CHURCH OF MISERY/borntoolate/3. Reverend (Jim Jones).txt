[songs &amp; lyrics by Tatsu Mikami]

Obey me people of sorrow
Insanity leading blind servant
No place to hide yourself
Welcome to my home "jones town"

You die, don't ask me why
Temple is the place where dead angels lies
Don't pray for your tomorrow
Suicide is the way to escape from your pain

I'm your farther and lead you to death
