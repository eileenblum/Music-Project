[Songs &amp; lyrics by Tatsu Mikami]

Revolution for new generation
Sex, drug &amp; murder
I'll show you the way to kill, my children

Demolition for new creation
Peace, love &amp; terror
Pigs must be killed, my children

So this is the end of time
I'll give you peace of mind
Judgement day has coming
Now you gonna pay the price
Victory is on my side, my children

Operation for new domination
Blind family's power
Stab them to death, my children

Sensation for new situation
We've will to devour
Go for work to be done, my children

Now is the time for "revolution"
Are you prepare for "destruction"?
Now is the time to "creepy crawl"
"helter skelter" is comin' down fast!

Rise! death to pigs! helter skelter!
