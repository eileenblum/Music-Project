 BY TATSU MIKAMI]

YOU CAN SMELL SOMEONE'S ROTTING
DEATH COMES BEHIND YOU
THERE'S NOWHERE TO RUN
DISMEMBERED YOUR REMAINS AND NOBODY CARES
FACTORY OF MURDER IS THIS ROOM 213

YOU CAN SEE SOMEONE'S SKULL THAT BOILED
CASKET AROUND YOU AND NOBODY KNOWS
RUPTURED YOUR MEMORY, HOLD YOUR BREATH
FACTORY OF MURDER IS THIS ROOM 213

WELCOME TO MY SLAUGHTER HOUSE
WHERE THE BLOOD FEAST HAS BEGUN
