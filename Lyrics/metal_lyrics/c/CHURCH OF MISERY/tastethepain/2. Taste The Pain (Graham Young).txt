 BY TATSU MIKAMI]

DECAY IMMENSELY
DEEP INSIDE OF YOU
I PROVED MY THEORY BY MY HUMAN TEST

I PRAY FOR THE END OF YOUR NIGHTMARE
I'LL GIVE YOU DEATH'S RESPITE
RESPECT MY POISON
AM I CHEMIST OR KILLER ?

MY MIND'S DISTURBANCE
UNEXPECTED CHILD
RISKY CREATION
MENACE TO MANKIND

PRAY FOR THE END OF YOUR NIGHTMARE
I'LL GIVE YOU DEATH'S RESPITE
CHEMICAL EXPERIMENT
SLOWLY BUT SURELY
TASTE THE PAIN MY SLAVE
ONLY DEATH IS REAL
