 BY TATSU MIKAMI]

YOUR MISSING CHILDREN
I KNOW THE PLACE WHERE THEY SLEEP
BRING 'EM TO A TOTURE
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
TWO FACES OF MY MIND
YOU CAN SEE THE GOOD &amp; THE EVIL
I CAN SHOW YOU THE WAY TO DIE
I WANNA HEAR YOUR CRY

AND I BURY YOU UNDER MY FEET
BLOOD TURNING TO BLACK 
BENEATH MY SKIN

YOU CAN SMELL OF BLOOD RED
YOU CAN'T HEAR THEIR CRY
YOU CAN SEE THE BODIES
HARMLESS VICTIM

RECORDED AT LOS ANGELES CLUB STUDIO, TOKYO APRIL - MAY BY O-MI
