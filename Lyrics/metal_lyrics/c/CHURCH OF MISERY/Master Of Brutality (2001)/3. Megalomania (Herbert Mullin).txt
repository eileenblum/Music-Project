 BY TATSU MIKAMI]

I'M SAVER OF THIS EARTH - TOTAL CALAMITY
WE NEED A SACRIFICE - ORDER FROM ABOVE
GO OUT AND KILL ALL BASTARDS
I WANNA SEE YOUR FACE OF DESPAIR
YEAH, ALL RIGHT NOW

NOW'S THE TIME TO DO MY MISSION
STABBING YOUR CHEST WITH MY KNIFE
BLOWING YOUR HEAD WITH MY GUN
I WANNA HEAR YOUR CRY OF DEATH
YEAH, WON'T YOU LISTEN

EARTHQUAKE WILL COME HERE " CALIFORNIA "
NO ONE CAN STOP DISASTER
BUT I'M THE ONLY ONE
