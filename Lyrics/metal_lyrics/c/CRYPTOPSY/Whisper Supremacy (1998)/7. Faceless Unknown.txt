Travelling through the veins of prior existance
Only to realize you've lost your bearings
Dragged beyond human receptiveness
Surrounded, reach for the portal of answers

Release the demon
Soar to far away wavelengths
Out of body, out of your mind
Free the subconscious and enter the light

Tightrope walk alone
Faceless unknown

Difficulties and discoveries
Incorporated to build as one
A basin of washed away memories
Forever filled

Wrath of identities
Nailed to your forehead
Pick and choose the faces
That will have no features

Disguised but slowly unveiled
Wearing down
This subliminal frown
To probe the recesses
Of a once benign mind
Tainted in malignancy

Everlasting search for resolve
Inner conflict inflict the afflicted

Interplantary secrets
Mesmerized, answers lost
To the wind

Intoxicated with fury
Subside and dissolve
Over time
Endless time
