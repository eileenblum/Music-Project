Apprenticeship to my duty
Learner of a higher magnitude
A scholar at producing pain
Don't forget to include
A masters in brutality
Enjoy to be, my next fatality

Some call me a fiend
A ghoul of gore
I'm gonna settle the score
You lecherous, squabbling mongrel

Have you suffered enough?
Bled all over yourself?
It's a shame to see you spill
All that rotting swill
Seemed as though you've delved
Into an unwelcoming predicament
Enough to wipe that smile
Off your shitgrin face

Beaten down dog
Pungent urine stench
Streams of disgust
Puddles spread to lakes
Boot to face intakes

I loathe, I loathe you
You're sickening

How I laugh at your discomfort
Are your teeth settling down the throat alright?
I'll squeeze it tight
No room for air
Down there

Redesigning the blueprints to madness
Slab of meat bruised and bloodless
Feel my wrath, feel my wrath
You're wiped away
I pity you not
You cease to exist
Pointless to resist
Your medicine
