Out of focus
Need to get a grip
So you don't slip
Into the realm
Of lifelessness
As you crawl through
The debris of the past

Feebly arise to one knee
Inhaling the treachery
Bearing witness to the actions you've chosen
Closed mouth, unspoken
The fallen one

Sometimes you hate yourself
And everyone else
Go ahead and hate yourself
For not awakening your dreams
And nightmares

Screams to an immortal one
Supposed only son
Never sees the tears in your eyes
Never hears the ungodly cries
Behind the mask that you've worn
Bitter and scorned

Hourglass and mournful stillness
A tribute to sorrows passing
As time drips in endless
Melancholy and gruesome recollections

Through depths you've fallen
Unsurmountable odds of ascension
Succumbed by fathoms
Washed adrift, suspended in grief
Never to lift your filthy spirit

Soul cleanse, blank the imagery
It must be nice to have
The burden of thought
Whisked away
And let astray
