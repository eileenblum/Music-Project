[Lyrics by Lord Worm]

Something's come over me... I can't bear to see you live
Between lies, between sins that bespeak iniquity

I just want to hold your pretty hand
The rest of you can be dissolved in acid
I just want to hold your pretty hand

Purified of their sins, fornicators will be purged
Breath of god: wind of change
I ride, (and) you will meet your death... whore

I just want to hold your pretty hand
The rest of you can be dissolved in acid
You've payed for this death with all your sin. Die.
