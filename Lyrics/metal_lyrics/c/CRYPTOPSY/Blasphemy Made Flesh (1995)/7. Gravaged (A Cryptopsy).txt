[Lyrics by Lord Worm]

Ungentle exhumation
Must be thorough, remove it all
Catalogue every part,
Then rape them and eat them

How dare them bury
what should be mine
My dead companions
on which I dine

Penetrate the dead hole
Please, O lord, just let it smell
and let mankind's puniverse
be befouled just for me

My graveside manner
lacks no finesse
These ravaged bodies
betray no distress

As I tear apart the dead things
I annoint them with my seed
and gain new insights into death
with their consumption
Yet I wonder,
What if I were something dead?

Somewhere there's a graveyard of ghouls
with a massive headstone
that waits just for me;
Maybe someday
Someone will come
