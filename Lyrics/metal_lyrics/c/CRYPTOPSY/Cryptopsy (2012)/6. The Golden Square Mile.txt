Prominent local aristocrats
Painted red throughout history
A fortune born out of sugar
Led the family to the social summit
The daughter of Montreal's fourth mayor
Laid silently at rest in her bed
As her son of twenty four years
Studied mercilessly in the adjacent room

As night settled darkness fell upon the Square Mile Mansion
Delirious thanks to her pain medication

Ada Maria Mill Repath
Unlocked the top drawer of her nightstand
And removed from it a fevered solution
But her flimsy faint grip allowed it to fall

Clattering to the floor

Once Clifford's focus was interrupted
He headed out in search of the racket
But when he entered his Mother's room
It was already splattered with her blood brains and bones

The aspiring med student resolved to seal his own fortune as well
The pressures of life had completely crippled him

Three days later they were already both six feet below
Rotting slowly as the populous' interest
Took flight as the rumours grew so did the mystery of it all

Sadly Sherbrooke Street was never quite the same
The Golden Square Mile was forever tainted
The gloom that engulfed their mansion
Still remains present today
