She moved slowly in order not to wake him
I reassured her this was the right decision

She tenderly slipped her hand
Underneath his sleeping head
But when she withdrew his weapon
He began to stir

Which caused her to recede

I lied down on the floor next to him

Nodded approvingly
For her to end this nightmare

The gun went off and chunks of skull splattered
Onto my face and all over her night gown
A frenzy broke out overhead

The media overran our tiny town
Wondering what would drive a youth to kill
He was a horrible man
He beat me bloody and tore us down
Tormented us with his presence
Controlling us every single moment

This had been going on for far too long
We tried to escape but he soon found us
And dragged us back to where we belonged

These are the laws of the flesh

The consequences of our crime
Brought to light our suffering
Our tiny home was a war zone
Where pain flourished
