[2012 "The Best of Us Bleed" Compilation]Could you please pass a little more of her thigh

The most pathetic spoils evade us still such constant constraints
Have captured us without conviction there is no upheaval

The shattered remnants lay in the corner
Backs turned to avoid their piercing gaze
Memories flutter into our spectres
Wretched visions bind ourselves within our minds

This worthless cause is lacking face
Narrowed and voided weâve been trapped in space
Harrowed and forgotten weâve been left here to die
Hallowed and silenced

As they wept we made a decision
How many die tonight so that more can struggle tomorrow

Tiny limbs can no longer support us
Shortest straw lay still within the clenched fist over the spit

Winter approaches and we watch our numbers drop
The naked snowdrifts mask the hell within

A burial ground surrounds our home
The unmarked graves are filled with polished bones.
The ingested fates of all the damned 
Is housed by the earth on which we stand

The empty carcass we separate
Hardly contain enough flesh to substantially support a human being
Animals thatâs what weâve become struggling to survive in an obsolete life
