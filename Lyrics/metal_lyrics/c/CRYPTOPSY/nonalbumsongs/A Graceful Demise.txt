[2012 "The Best of Us Bleed" Compilation]The dampened earth clogged my nostrils and filled my mouth
Immobilized I was forced to watch

As you inched your way inside and spat your repugnant waste
Cackling and mewling you gladly regaled within their distress

I crawled towards them
The blinding sight reaped havoc on my staggered beliefs
My entire sanctity had been deconstructed
Life became a foreign task

I had to self medicate
Disintegrate these vacant aspects refuelling me
Reintegrate pain through ancient methods

Their final screams still invade my sleep
Luring me towards insanity
The simplest solution is the only one I can bear
Let us end this now

Remember the past born on a darkened night
The time has come for it to come to fruition
Now grip your blade as I unsheathe mine
Back in a final moment of grief realizing now there is nothing left to fear

The metallic scent permeates a primal stench
Blending time and altering notions
Suffocating the impiety I orchestrated through my banality

As the light slowly faded from my eyes
Their deceptive glance no longer holds ground
The remorse I enclosed within myself cocooned my cowardly rage
The reflection in your eyes mark my hatred for myself
Release myself within
The field of agony I frolic freely now the tiny specs
Flatter at the edges
I am reborn
