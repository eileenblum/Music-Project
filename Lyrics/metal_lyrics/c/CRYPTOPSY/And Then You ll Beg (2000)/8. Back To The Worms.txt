imagine every living thing
forever accompanied
by an alter dimensional being
phantom pain brought on by
the wounding of each individual's
extracorporeal entity

in this violent day and age
we greatly fear their coming rage
what technology has done
forced apart what once was one

electropsychic and highly psychotic
as, unlike an aura, it thinks for itself
inseparable in schizoid existence
once inexorably linked with our own

relationship of symbiotic nature
unbeknownst to human half of dual creature
as the phantom empaths whose pain is intense
learn from the cold voice of experience

mass exodus in an invisible flood
externalization spills torrents of a blood
man has ended his three-dimensional term
they came from the worms
let them go back to the worms
