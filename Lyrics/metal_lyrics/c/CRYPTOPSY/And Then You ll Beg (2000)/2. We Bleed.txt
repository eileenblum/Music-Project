First the climb 
Become the status 
Regained sight 
Undercontrolled 
On a directionless path 

One should be 
The quiet one who would not see 
Resemblance in self 
And all those spawned 

All in the same 
Suffering sadness 
Incredible truth 
Justice to this madness 

Remember, forget who you are 
Negative and bored 
And have given a little too much thought 
Here today, long gone yesterday 
Saw a million zombies like me 
Some of whom have entered the fray 

A man with nothing to lose 
Will kill quicker than a wolf 
Will tear your flesh 
And a man with all to gain 
He will do the same 
Now has easily passed the threshold 

We bleed
Like the rest of you pigs
We breed
Fuck like the rest of you parasites

We plead
For an end
The need
For selfishness
We bleed
Ourselves instead

Tortured
Wondering whether
The process of thinking
Duplicates itself
Mirrored by maniacal malicious intentions
Carried out with ease
We bleed

A man with nothing to lose
Has struck swifter than a snake
Displays cold survival
And a man with all to gain
He has done the same
But has never crossed the threshold

Leap across the line
Teeter back and forth
On the brink
Decide which path
You take every hour
