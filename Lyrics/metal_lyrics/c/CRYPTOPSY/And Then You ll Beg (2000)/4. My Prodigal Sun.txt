Reach at the unreachable
Futile attempts
It's succumbed to its own laws

Rise and falls
Like building blocks
Pick 'em up
Knock 'em down
Another day
A different season

Hate eternal overshadows
Dispersed in clouds
My prodigal son
Returns for the sun dogs
To embelish in angelic rays
Raise our hands in anticipation
Conquest procession participation

When sweat lies and burns the eyes
Fry the river dries
Sunburn-orama drama
Accepted with open arms

Cult of fire
Sect inferno
Desperately
Long awaited arrival
