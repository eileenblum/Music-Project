[Lyrics by Mike DiSalvo]

Savagely beguiled of courage
Not equipped for determination
Needed for your journey 
Not sure if you were 
Thrown in or shit out 
The way you see it is the way it is

Maybe not the way it's supposed to be 
A beginning for other solutions 
Led to the same place to find 
The bad in the bad 
And the bad in the good

Either way
Whatever could go wrong does go wrong 
Ending up right back 
Where you began 

The great escape
Houdini mystique 
Sensory multiload 
Overstate the obvious 
That your situations 
Remain in focus never to vanish

Soar and envision sore vision 

Trippin' at the helm 
The illusion of utopia 
Wanting more and more 
And then you'll beg 

Soar and envision sore vision
