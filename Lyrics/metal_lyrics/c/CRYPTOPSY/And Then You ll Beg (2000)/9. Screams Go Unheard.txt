[Lyrics by Mike DiSalvo and Gen Guay DiSalvo]

Seeing that this blood sequence
Is most unfortunate
Hallowed be thy immortal
Free from constrictions
And that ridiculous boundry
Called life
Fly my pretty
However, stay close to me

Omen bearer, ecstatic shiver
Like a woman just crossed my grave
Almost blind sight for sour eyes
And tickled my fancy
Delicate. Pure. Mine.
Simply soulmated 
The heaven's serene selection 
God's reflection 
Something tells me 
You might not know me now 
You will soon

First fucking things first 
Would bet on you a smile 
That this other fella? 
Will disapear for a while 

No mind to a constant observant
I watch
Two is a show but three is a crowd
Pardon me, may i have this dance
As for you sir
Your services have been rendered useless
And are no longer needed
Sleep that deep slumber 

Cleverly infiltrate the daily procedures 
Enjoy this moment 
Perfect timing, perfect beauty 
Thank you for inviting 
I'll drop by for a minute (or two) 
Upon my ringing, you're cordially obliged 
Couldn't have been better 
If I'd been asked for dinner 
Lept that step 
Beyond a casual notice 
Full fledged admiration 

Might be deemed a social misfit 
Never asked, never cared 
Never spared a worthless existence
The big splash, your life in a flash
Of tornados forming, frenzied whirlwind
Of times and places, people and faces
Fear has a scent that's unmistakable
It's growing, building, mutating, ascending
You've created a lover, well respected
Undeniably desired 

Popculture idolatry, root vulture misery
In the wake of my own hero parade
An army of one,
Haven't had this much fun
As a couple deeply in obsession
Screams go unheard
