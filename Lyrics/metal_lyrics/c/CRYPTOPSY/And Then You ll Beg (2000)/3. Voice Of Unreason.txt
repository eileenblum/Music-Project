ossuary for the misinformed
you'd end up being amazed
of what you'd see inside
the whisps of knowledge denied
and to think that someone's impired
it's a better place to reside

take that voice of unreason
asked that question
about the chaos
that lies dormant within

have pondered through a pond
of useless information
fooled tricked
but I'm slowly coming around

fell for it once never again
ignorance is bliss
for the miner of fool's qold
can't teach a dog that's too old
the motherfucker'll take a bite of the poison
indoctrinate unfiltered lore
teaching
teaching
absolutely nothing

intravenously force fed
a slave state of intelligence
meant to break these bonds of some point
howsabout now

the bottom line
I've saved you the time
wasted on a lost cause
no longer
