We are...
We are aware that we are:
We are breathing...
This is our present exhalation
(and) then comes inspiration
...wait for it...

For thee, mortals, a cataclysm
Wherein all (that) thou knowest shall die
For in this kingdom where everything dies
Where even the sky is mortal
What is not and has always been
For thee, must never be

Thine ancient gods in their pantheons
Will cease to be utterly
And the stars in thy firmament:
All will die;
and thy Prayers for Deliverance;
all will die,
And be one in a nucleon
...Reductio ad Absurdum...

Momentum
Continuum
Sacramentum
Sacrilegium
...Fires mortal Terra...
One final perfect day
From all to absence in one breath

It is all one single grain:
It is all one
And nevermore is a new beginning...
