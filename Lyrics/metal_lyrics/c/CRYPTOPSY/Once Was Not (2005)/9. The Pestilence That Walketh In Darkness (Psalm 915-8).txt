Â«Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night
For the arrow that flieth by day
For the pestilence that walketh in darkness
For the destruction that wasteth at noonday
A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand
At thy right hand: but it shall not come nigh thee
Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold
And see the reward of the wicked.Â»

One last
Perfect night of life on earth
I saw a pestilence descend on wings
Plague black
As it rode the ancient star wind
There are
Things more horrible than death
