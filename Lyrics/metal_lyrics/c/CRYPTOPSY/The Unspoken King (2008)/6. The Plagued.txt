Save, me from, this pain, which you,
Have crafted, throughout years of hate.

Your endless greed, is astonishing.

It swallowed, your life, and your goals,
It tampered with, your entire soul.
You have sacrificed, the benefits of what's been sewn,
Just to be able, to stand toe to toe.

Your voracity, is astounding.

Guilt does not affect, your incestuous,
Need, for, such, controversy.

Today, I hope you realize that we have,
Released, the voice of a nation.

Try to, see the light,
Open up your, mind to the sight,
And then you'll realize.

Your eyes, darkened and weak,
Now silent, beneath this plastic sheet.

Regret, and forget.

When will you regret, your lack of empathy.
Soon you will forget, the taste of greed.

This world, cannot forgive, this is a consequence,
(With which we all must live) [x2]

The consequences, of your relentless, greed, pain, hate, lies,
Have overcome you, without remorse or disdain.
Without exemptions, your hands are stained with, innocent blood.
Within their shadows, our world is still weeping.

I can't, believe to which extent,
We have let our world, decay.
Breathe, disciple, breathe, enemy,
For as long as you are, we will never be free.

Your gluttony, is never-ending.

Try to, see the light, open up your, mind to the sight,
And then you'll realize, that you, have destroyed,
Our chances of, an unsoiled life.
