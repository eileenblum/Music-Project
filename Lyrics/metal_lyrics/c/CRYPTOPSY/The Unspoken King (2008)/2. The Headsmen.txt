Eradicate them all now.
We, we have been far too lenient,
But your torment must suffice,
Worthless years of achievements,
Have lead us to this sacrifice.

Annihilate the chosen and so without remorse or sorrow.
Anecdotes are for fools you must be abdicate
Your grief throughout,
This viral process.
We have been far too lenient,
But your torment must suffice,
Worthless years of achievements,
Have lead us to this sacrifice.

Once we have come of age,
We shall be lead to the slaughter.
This is done without question,
For it is simply a matter of evolution.
Silence your consciences,
For this is irreplaceable.
Embrace our impermanence, for we all are perishable.
Throughout the celebration we recite the
Arguments in our favour.
Silence your consciences,
For this is irreplaceable.
Embrace our impermanence, for we all are perishable.

Throughout the ceremony we recite the arguments in our favour.
Leading us to decide termination must be designed.
Declined.
We, we have been far too lenient,
But your torment must suffice,
Worthless years of achievements,
Have lead us to this sacrifice.

We will not, redefine, nor we will reinstate.

Neglect and abandonment will not suffice,
Exasperating circumstances, have lead us straight,
Through the underbelly of this place.
Silence your consciences,
For this is irreplaceable.
Embrace our impermanence, for we all are perishable.
Idleness, ignorance, innocent, venial, demented,
Slanderous, credulous, insolent.

When will you see that we have done what must be in order to live.
