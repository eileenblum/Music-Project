Plead
To be released in your void,
Which has consumed
Us far too many times before.
We promised ourselves
That we wouldn't succumb
To the dissonance.
This fractured state, has
Engulfed, our, sense of,
Worth
Beg
So polished,you're
Gleaming with light.
Too tempting,
Resisting with all our might.
Blinded soul
On a misguided flight.
Silence the, demons lethal appetite.
Seeking refuge from this
Burden which has all but,
Torn and worn us to shreds.
This blinding conclusion,
Has diverted the inevitable.
Guiding us back to you.
Focus on the pain,
Our only fragment of reality.
Wade through this disdain,
The only sanctity we've ever contained.
Worship your demons,let
Them mold and guide you.
Worship your demons, but
Do not let them inside you.
Worship your demons,let
Them mold and calm you.
Worship your demons but,
Do not let them control you.
This fractured state, has
Engulfed, our, sens of,
Worth
BEG
