I can still see the light,
I can still feel its presence,
While you, withdraw it from me.

Within, this casket, I lie in wait, to be unleashed.
Disposed of, and left to rot, I am now, your "center piece."
Lies, have lead me down this road in the dark of night.
Truth, will unhinge these doors and lead blinded men to sight.

Through this conformity,
We have formed a society,
Seizing all liability,
From our identities.

Locked silent in this state, buried within the overgrowth.
We are all confined, with nothing left to show.

"I find myself" [x2]
Buried within
I find myself

Awoke in a cold sweat, all disoriented.
Take in your surroundings, and realize your fate.

"You find yourself" [x2]
Tormented within
You'll find yourself

The air I breathe, does not constrain me.
It lifts me up, and leads me from this fate.
Beneath the seeds, there is a dream,
Which has lead us all astray.

All I see is fading, away,
And everything I see, is fading.

Read between the lines, and live.

"I find myself" rising above these obstacles, and unleashing the tyrant.
"I find myself" unearthing the torment, this icon represents.

I can still see the light,
Through this conformity,
We have formed a society,
Seizing all liabilities.

All I see is fading, away,
(Everything is fading away),
And everything I see, is fading.
