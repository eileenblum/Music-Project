Within these words, I'll hide the contempt for the purpose I serve.
Silently, I withhold my resolve, and pursue, while my dignity dissolves,
A bit more everyday...

I'll hold on to the end, and fight my resentment.
You see, I have succumbed, in order to complete, what must be done.

Stand tall, to keep faith and fight.
Take up arms, and prepare, for the, onslaught.

Prepare yourself.

Concealed in shadows, there are weaknesses.
I have uncloaked them, to reveal their impurities.

I lay, concealed, awake, in hopes of finding safety from their,
Unrelenting, beatings, which they have organized in spite
Of all, your own, actions, which we have followed to a "T"
But we, have been, displaced, we have been driven from our course.

The battle rages on, as my mind begins to sway.
I am redeemed through consequence, but my guilt is still in play.

But the fact of the matter is, is that I've sacrificed,
Everything I am, while I was standing here for you.

Prepare yourself, just save yourself.

There is no escaping, we must strive to alter fate,
In order to recover, from this faltered state.

Within these words, I hid the contempt for the purpose I served silently.
I withheld my resolve, and pursued, while my dignity dissolved.
