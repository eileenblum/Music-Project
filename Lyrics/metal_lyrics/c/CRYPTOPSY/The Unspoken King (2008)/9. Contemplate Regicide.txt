Waiting, within this sullen twilight,
We shiver, anticipation clouding our sight.
We contrived this lesson in order to reconcile.
We've compiled these actions in order to retaliate.

The time has now come, to swallow your lost, pride.
Between your alluring pleads, and all your foul excuses.
We've learned to see through your deceiving, eyes.

Within a moment,
The dissection begins,
Leaving you breathless.

The time has now come, to swallow your lost, pride.

Sever, and bask within the impiety.
Perish, while relishing the irony.
Our anticipation rises as your heart rate begins to fall.
We're liberated as you slowly dissipate.

The time has now come, to swallow your lost, pride.
Between your alluring pleads, and all your foul excuses.
We've learned to see through your deceiving, eyes.

Our fates, were once, intertwined,
But now, we have, cleansed this place.
We have, left it all, behind.
We have, left it all, for you.

We're standing on our own, we're standing on our own.
We've taken, we've taken, we've taken control.
We're standing on our own, we're standing on our own.
We've taken, we've taken, we've taken control, of our lives.

The time has now come, to swallow your lost, pride.
Between your alluring pleads, and all your foul excuses.
We've learned to see through your deceiving, eyes.
