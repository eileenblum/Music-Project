Idolize the compromised lifestyle we
Have depicted for ourselves.
Organized to sanctify the resistance
We're consistently served.

Strive, strive, to rectify.

Throughout the ages we have confined
Ourselves within these brainwashed lies
We've broken, through this severed wound, which has been.

Burnt, burnt, and restructured.

Silence, the tyrants, before they condemn us all.
Silence, the tyrants, in order, to sanctify.
Silence, the tyrants,
I will not, be able to swallow,
Your predetermined guilt.
You seem, so hollow, as your senses begin to slip.
Beaten, and paralyzed, tormented, and left to die.

You've been born into this, so there's no use to resist.
We now have a common goal, which is to unleash your soul.

Each passing hour, allows you to dive deeper.
Your consciousness is fading, as the light begins to regress.

I see, all your efforts, failing.
All your pain, has been endured for nothing.
Beneath your screams you're whimpering.
To be relieved of this burden you are
Wearing, which you are holding.

You've sacrificed for what...

Beaten, and paralyzed, tormented, and left to die.
Beaten, and paralyzed, tormented, and left alone to die.

Silence, the tyrants,
Before they condemn us all.
Silence, the tyrants, in order,
To cleanse, ourselves, from our filthy world.
