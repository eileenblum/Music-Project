Distorted visions of life
Disguised in your lies

Deviation, desecration,
Malediction, from your mind
Take your words, Hypocrisy,
To our eyes, to glorify

Speak of things that cannot be
Live your life in mockery
Your life is but a lie
A broken mind intensifies
Distorted words... Bred in your mind
Mystify - Speak your words to glorify
Bred in your mind

Divination, Hallucination,
Fabrication, from your mind
Take your words to our eyes
To glorify

Your mind has died
