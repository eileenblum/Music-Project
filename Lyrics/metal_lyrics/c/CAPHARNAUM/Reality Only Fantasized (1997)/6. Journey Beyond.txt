Your thoughts are flooded by
Visions of pain
Deception holds you down to
The bitter end

A false hope subsides in you -
The growing addiction from
The journey beyond
Deny the hurt that grows
Inside of you - The rising
Affliction from the journey beyond

Search now through your
Shattered soul for a glimmer of peace
Swallowed whole by diffidence
The journey begins
