Unforeseen malevolence
Within a shattered thought
A broken dream from the
Chamber of memories lost
The insight of a chaotic
Existence past
Forsaken fate - A toll of an
Abusive past

Escape yourself through synthetic peace
Prevent the pain from being unleashed
Enter the plane of time and reality
A dream of your life you cannot live

Silent cries as a dark misery arrives
A mirror of your life you can't deny
Forever gone you shall remain
Your life fades in your eyes

Time closes in on this deluded dream
Your false reality will start to cease
The haunting truth is now here
Face the pain you can't bear
Your sightless mind is blind to the fear
Hope will arise dissolve your fear
