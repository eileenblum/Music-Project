Blinded by thoughts so
Macabre, I see thing I
Thought would never be
This new harsh reality
I wish would cease

As I sleep, my dreams turn to nightmares
Phantoms of chaos enter my mind
Stealing my precious memories
Raping my mind in the night

Sinister perceptions cause my Fall
Never ending pain to the end
A sentence of anguish never
Thought before
A sentence of anguish
I am reborn
