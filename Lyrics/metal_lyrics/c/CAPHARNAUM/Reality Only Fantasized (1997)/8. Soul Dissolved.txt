Submerged inside of devious thought
Fighting the internal Nemesis which is yourself
Unmendable consequences - this web you weave
Escaping to deception - This path you lead

A recurrent dream of your foul disgrace
A nightmare of thoughts you just cannot face
Denial of truth by subduing your hate
To a shallow grave painstakingly made

Take a step back
Look into yourself
Bear witness of your own
Deception
Disposition devoid
Your hatred takes form
