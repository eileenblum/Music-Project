Awaiting the arrival
Of serenity lost
Self pushed far away
Existence bleak if not

This bleak eternity
Has you in its hold
Now you break away
All you see is black

Disturbing flashbacks of life
Stare into your eyes
A shadow of your former self
Reality only fantasized

Attempt to break away from
This harsh void
Trapped in a world of pain
Misery at every turn
Absorbed into throes of bitterness
Pulled down into this eternal decent
