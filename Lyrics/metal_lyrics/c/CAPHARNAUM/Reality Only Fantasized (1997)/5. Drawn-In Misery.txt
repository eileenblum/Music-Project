Deep within your mind
Repressed memories lost
Eternally haunting
Your normal life is paused

Now your mind will never break free
You suffer in dormant hypocrisy
Deep within your mind - perverted memories
Snap right back at you - drawn-in misery

Fantasy - A daydream far away
Fermented - Memories will always stay
Fantasy, dreaming, restless,
Screaming, mind lock, trapped
In, forbidden to give in
