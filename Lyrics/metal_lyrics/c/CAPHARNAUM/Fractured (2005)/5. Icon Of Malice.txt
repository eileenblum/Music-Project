I am what you crave,
When others turn their back,
In your darkest moment of shame,
With the hate you seem to lack
The hate that you lack
Iâll take your to a world where hate
And contempt dwell,
Iâm conjuring the spells that
Pours my hate into your heart

Come to me for your salvation,
I will feed on your resentment,
Making you a willing slave, to this hatred
Icon of malice.
Youâll see my way or shed your blood,
Either way my hate has won
Pull back the vail to see my face,
To your surprise itâs your own
