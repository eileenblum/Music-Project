In resurrection it may be the time
To grab humanity by the reigns
In times of ruling itâs the pyre
That bring the enslaved to their knees
Itâs me, the chaos sphere that rules this land
Itâs me, the chaos sphere heed my command
Through fire, I will bring this land
Through war a blazing inferno
Hatred feeds me quenches the thirst
To see war amongst humans
I taste rage in the bodies to murder
No mercy no sympathy just torment
In resurrection it may be the time
To grab humanity by the reigns
In times of ruling itâs the pyre
That bring the enslaved to their knees
