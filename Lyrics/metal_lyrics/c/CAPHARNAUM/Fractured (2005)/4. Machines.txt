To bring us power, intelligence
Machines are running in our mind
When we dissect the natural elements
We see what left behind
Calibrate â to attack empower me â as they kill
In my dreams, I see the end,
My fear prevails, I see machines

[solo â Suecof]

We will pay with our lives, back to the beginning
We are machines, breeding
