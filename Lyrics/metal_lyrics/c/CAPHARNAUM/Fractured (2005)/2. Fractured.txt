What of this world a thing in which I canât be
To taste for first time
Grim destruction bitter end
My skeletal self is melting
In separation of my mind and body
I realize that my cries jeopardize mortality
Amputation from the system
Lobotomize the soul
To destroy
The structural
Integrity
As a crust forms on the implants
A rotting up of the soil
Of all your inner abortions
Insanity takes its control
Dragging through the abyss
Deserted in amiss
Separation from life
Fractured me in the strife
In the separation of my body
A silent scream prevails me
Takes me
