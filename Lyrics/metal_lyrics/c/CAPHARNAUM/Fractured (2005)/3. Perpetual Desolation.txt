Insanity will be my captor
Taking its toll on my comprehension
Ecstasy
Derangement
It will be everlasting
A cage tormented catatonic
I feel lunacy in me
Its psychosis taking me over
Autopsy is my only birth-rite
Still beating necropsy for me
Dissection is my savior
I only hope that the blood loss kills me
Torch my body set me free
To roam the land of the dead
