Leeching off the blood of old
Lasting gaze turned heart of tone
Tear the heart out beating cold
Skinned pulled apart then drip the bone
Conceived in blood
Is the untruth
Occultist ritualistic birth of a new god
Abhor the pure who lay in light
Clawing at night
Behold masterful unload
Tear me from this life I once knew
Carnivorous perversion
Spiral down into dementia
I refuse the possessed

[solo â Suecof]

Carnivorous perversion
I refuse the possessed

[solo â Suecof]
[solo â Mongrain]
[solo â Suecof]
