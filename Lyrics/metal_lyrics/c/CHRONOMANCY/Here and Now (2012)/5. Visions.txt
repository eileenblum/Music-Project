The tides of time are coming now prepare your ground
An era of upheaval chaos and despair
The roots of our societyâs crisis are so deep
And hijacked by our instincts we will burn the earth

They spoke of Armageddon
But mankind will not stop to exist
Itâs just that the allegiance of humanity
Is covered with sin

Visions [4x]
A brand new world now opens up ahead
A world of chances and everything to learn
Remain a human and keep a calm clear head
Watch as the old world is coming to an end

The recipe is old, first we think then we do
Envision and then build a new and better world
It wonât be easy but weâll do it step by step
And nothing better nourishes a human soul

Visions [4x]
A brand new world now opens up ahead
A world of chances and everything to learn
Remain a human and keep a calm clear head
Watch as the old world is coming to an end
