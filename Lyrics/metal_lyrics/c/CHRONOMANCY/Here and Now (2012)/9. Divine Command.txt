Eyes made from The Light
Decide to join us back in Earth
While mankind is passing
Through the Valley of Death

Immortal souls arrive
To guide us off this foul life
Lead us into glory
For centuries ahead

Rising with his own sword
An unyielding warrior
He will see all of us
Through spiritual squalor

In his mind Ideals
His heart a live fire
With a crashing thunder
He receives his mission

He stands high holding a flag
With a strong red hand

Fate plays strange games
To test a mysticâs inner light
But he who makes us proud
Has defeated his self

Heâs not like the others
Who all are mad for power
Power is nothing
If youâre working for yourself

Fighting with the old world
In unequal struggle
But true leaders can make
The unlikely happen

He knows thatâs his mission
To upgrade all mankind
And if itâs war it takes
Flesh and bone we will grind

You have seen immortals
Changing life for mankind
And if there is still hope
Itâs because of all them

Now you have your mission
Read their words and follow
Do it and youâll prosper
Or remain a dead man

He stands high holding a flag
With a strong red hand
Through war values will shine
Here, now, we conquer!

The whole world United
An Eagle flies in the Sun!
