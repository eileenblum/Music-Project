Once so long ago
In a land where virtue unfolds
Fought the Princes of Doom
And their blood enlightened the world

Fight, kill, die for your oath
Your blood make divine

Spartan warriors into Sacred Time
Marching
Blood-red cloaks beneath the starlit sky
Guardians
To the gods who make their weapons shine
Duty
Who of them would be afraid to die
Glory

Training themselves so hard
To a goal unknown by all
Seek to overcome fear
And unchain your eternal soul

Gods smile upon the brave
Their blood is divine

Spartan warriors into Sacred Time
Marching
Blood-red cloaks beneath the starlit sky
Guardians
To the gods who make their weapons shine
Duty
Who of them would be afraid to die
Glory

For the virtue of Ares

Spartan warriors into Sacred Time
Marching
Blood-red cloaks beneath the starlit sky
Guardians
To the gods who make their weapons shine
Duty
Who of them would be afraid to die
Glory
