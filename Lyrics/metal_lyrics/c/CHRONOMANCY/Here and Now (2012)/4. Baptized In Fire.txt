My heart is on fire
Soon Iâll ride into the fray
Hate will fly toward me
But I will smile and sustain

Father give me strength
I am not yet dead
I was born to make the change

Glory in Thy name
Father give me strength
Oh oh ohâ¦

Baptized in the Fire
Burning hearts into the night
Baptized in the Fire
With the power to turn wrong to right

Chaos is around us
But thereâs order in our hearts
The solar windâs blowing
And begins the righteous march

Baptized in the Fire
Burning hearts into the night
Baptized in the Fire
â¦â¦â¦â¦with the power to save us
Baptized in the Fire
Burning hearts into the night
Baptized in the Fire
With the power to turn wrong to right
