How many times have you wondered if thereâs
Meaning in life or weâre just heading to death
Is there a point to all the things we do
Or would our life be just a meaningless clue

Some day youâll be reborn
In lifeâs dream
You wonât remember
What you now see

Isnât it so weird that
Some of us like different
Things or countries of the
Long forgotten past
In this life we have not
Lived in those realities
Yet there is something strong
That connects us to them

Live your life for one more time
It will not be your last
Carefully choose how you act
For its you who creates the past

All of the teachers of our mankind
Have taught this truth yet we are living a lie
Because our western society
Went through a church that did not want us free

Some day youâll be reborn
In lifeâs dream
You wonât remember
What you now see

All things in nature appear in circles
How can our spirit follow another law?
How could mankind evolve through experience and knowledge
If our life was just one, where do prodigies come from?

Live your life for one more time
It will not be your last
Carefully choose how you act
For its you who creates the past

Live your life for one more time
It will not be your last
Carefully choose how you act
For its you who creates the past
