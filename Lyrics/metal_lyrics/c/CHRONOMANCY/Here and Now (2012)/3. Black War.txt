The world is not enough without philosophy
Old heroes shine deep in my mind
A journey I must make to places none has seen
To lands that exist deep inside

Those lands are conquered by an ancient darkness
That plagues mankind since dawn of time
Only the warriors who are stronger than themselves
Ever defeated hosts of Time

A black war is raging inside me
Men pull gods from their throne
A black war is raging inside me
Savage killing the dawn
A black war is raging inside me
Darkness filling the heart
A black war is raging inside me
Feeling all hope is gone

You see a land oppressed in chaos and in ruins
Thatâs crying for your freeing hand
No mercy you shall meet from those grim enemies
And you must fight with all your heart

A black war is raging inside me
Men pull gods from their throne
A black war is raging inside me
Savage killing the dawn
A black war is raging inside me
Darkness filling the heart
A black war is raging inside me
Feeling all hope is gone

But you have to win the black war
Before you can fight for the light
You must reach the heart that only
Heroes can hold

Humility makes you try hard
And pride kills your celestial soul
Youâre aiming too high, beware
You swim in the Law!

Now get yourself a broom and clean the floor
While you also clean your heart and mind
Then offer to the others the best you got
Strengthâs from good work and itâs divine
