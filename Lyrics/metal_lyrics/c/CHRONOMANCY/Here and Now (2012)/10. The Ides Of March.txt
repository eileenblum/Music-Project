The time has now come, the full moon is shining up on the starlit sky
Feeling the warriorâs spirit inside you released from the chains at once

Under a thousand suns in the darkness the priest-king will sacrifice
Our spirits one with the silent night-light, beginning our magic march

To battle side by side, death will strike and none shall find
Knights of poetry and blood like a wind weâll sweep this land

Our quest honour-bound the worldâs fate is in our hands
Kill with one fateful blow, thwart the black wizardâs plans

Living adventure we cleanse this land
From stinking evil, and false commands

Once so many years ago on the Ides of March we all swore the ancient oath
To restore whatâs good and right, heal this land from the plague of leaders dark

Our quest honour-bound the worldâs fate is in our hands
Kill with one fateful blow, thwart the black wizardâs plans

Under a thousand suns in the darkness the deed will be always done
Weâll never fall slaves to corruption, weâre Knights of the Rising Sun

Under the veil of night blades will flash with killing light
Let us hope to one day see the Philosopher be King!
