On the Mountain of Death
In the night and cold
I seek the sacred spear
Of the God of War

The candle is burning
Incense swirls and curls
Winds of long past errors
Blow to bring a curse

What have I done till now
So much time in vain
Never paid attention
To the path I take

Seeking skills not virtues
Made me into a beast
Full of egoistic
Habits, wants and needs

My spirit cannot die
Thunder is my kind
Itâs the sign of my God
Who reigns up in the sky
Itâs decided by God
To cross this bridge tonight
Cross this bridge tonight

Inside our self full of flaws lives a soul thatâs eternal and never can die
from the dawn of time on this earth we reincarnate, we live and evolve
till we overcome the human state and become
What we call gods

My spirit cannot die
Thunder is my kind
Itâs the sign of my God
Who reigns up in the sky
Itâs decided by God
To cross this bridge tonight
Cross this bridge tonight

Follow the voice deep inside you that comes from above, clearly see through
the voices of the lower ego, this is who is You, who has to live through friction with
this world of flesh, towards destiny

On the Mountain of Death
I am myself dead
And a strong willpower
Drives my wretched self

Not a slave to ego
Never anymore
Now I know Iâm spirit
And a spirit strong

Back to my old body
Of material flesh
Now I know my mission
Live in conscience!

We have come to this world
Our own self to best
Come to play the game well
Pass the holy test

My spirit cannot die
Thunder is my kind
Itâs the sign of my God
Who reigns up in the sky

Itâs decided by God
To cross this bridge tonight
Cross this bridge tonight

There is no point in trying to become better than anyone else but your self,
All of us here share the same spiritual goal, and we must triumph over our instincts and fears
Towards our True Self!
