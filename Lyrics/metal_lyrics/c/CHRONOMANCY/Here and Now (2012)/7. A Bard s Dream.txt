Immense is the sky as is the galaxy
Those glittering lights are a whole new world each
The grandeur of nature, lifeâs sweet mystery
And its greatest wonder is that we can dream
With the stars as our guide

A tavern of people, a soft summer wind
A song that will be sung from west to the east
Unlimited goodness wherever I go
In the dark of the night human hearts carry light

Magical forests, adventurous fields
Ancient mountains and melodic streams
This world is so rich in possibilities
Its treasures are hidden where children can see
And search for invisible virtues and dreams
A life full of music and wisdom and deed
Its treasures are sung inside the silent wind
So now let the story beginâ¦

A tavern of people, a soft summer wind
A song that will be sung from west to the east
Unlimited goodness wherever I go
In the dark of the night human hearts carry light
In the dark of the night ohhhâ¦
