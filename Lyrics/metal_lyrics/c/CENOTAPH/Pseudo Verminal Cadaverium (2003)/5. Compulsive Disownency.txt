Mindless confusions spiritual depressions
Sophisticated mental detestation
Through the secret diary of inhuman mind
Blasted lust visions of perverse urge
Erased, forgotten, lifeless
Compulsive memories of internal disownency
Thinking of the falling one circle of broken ecstasy
Vanished feelings controls me, senseless decapitation
Dusk to illusions suspended perspective of morbid life
Pathetic solutions devoured and shapeless
Suffer through the filthy ecstasy of repulsive despondency
Dissointed mass of decomposed inner decease
