Full of scares all my eyes, pessimism with emptiness
Occation to vomit my humanity
Initial obligation drags my brain
Innocent faces unknown bodies
And my disgraced soul collobrate
And decide that your suggestion will be cause for your suffocation
That time I'll be succeeded
In satisfying my psychological pervertation by suffering from your eyes
And going on piercing your body parts
And parts and noticing the guttural voices
Coming from your shredded neck
After a while condonation stops, aspersion begins
Cadaverous aghasted agorophobics become anxious, ablazed abominable testis has an abstruse conceit
Tastles me creates confusion
Unattainable end which is abstained the taste of the venom verdict they say
Sterilizing your mackut
Straddling an a rampart
The priority is pouring blood and laughing with proud
