Animal kingdoms true lowlifes
Feed of living hosts
Causing a range of horrible disease
Infecting undetected for years
Eat us humans from the inside out
Producing fertile eggs
Enter the human body through mouth,anus and skin
Species attaching themselves to the intestinal tract
Presence of digestive enzymes egg shells are dissolved
Releasing a brand new worm
Producing a protective keratin layer to survive inside body
Rotting lymphatic system from the inside
By excreting toxins after feeding flesh
Deformed human gastrointestinal tract
Intestinal helminth infection
Intestinal obstruction, insomnia, vomiting weakness
Unable to medical help
Infected embryo during pregnancy
Worms infested the unborn fetus
Eating the cranial from inside out
Headless dead born mutation
