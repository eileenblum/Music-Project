repulsive infection of mortality shapeless
unconscious existence ethereal trance of bodily formation lurid alienation to organic
substances subconscious experience in uteral void vacuum of existential volition 
psychotic process of humane transmutation visions of absurdity doomed with
organismal embodiment floating mass of bounded flesh desperate creation of life,
nauseating repetition deplorable existence defeaced from the womb within excremental mess
to be consumed by putrefaction in the sickening cycle morbid grotesquery,
carved with disfigurement writhing in nihility lost in mental estrangement
