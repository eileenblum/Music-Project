Ä±nto the obscure swamps of womb
multiple embryos are created at impregnation
still breathing the new born
motivated by unhuman nature
consuming all parts of carnivorous species
cannibalism continues throughout embryonic fetal development
transform in deadly metamorphosis
strangulated within the putrid bowels
stillborn embryos eaten alive
hunger instincts to dead borned 
true evidence of existance
consumed in gluttony
cannibalizing another for food in utero
