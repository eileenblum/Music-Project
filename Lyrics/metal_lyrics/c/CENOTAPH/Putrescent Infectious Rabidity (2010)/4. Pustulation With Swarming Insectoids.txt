The act of decomposition started under intense offensive stech of slow decay
delicious necrotic tissiues of mutilated body parts
maggot infestation begin their life cycle
worms emerging from the eggs 8 hours after the gruesome murder
warm temperature shorten the decay process
ingested putrid mass of dead flesh
comsuming the dead tissiues of unrecognized rotten face
devouring the foreskin 
breathing anterior spiracles allows the colony 24 hour feeding the dead mass
segmented body, large salivary glands and endless urge to kill
secreting digestive enzymes and spreading putrefying bacteria
decomposition of the body and the recycling of nutrients
through the oxidation of elements
breaking down complex molecules into their constituent elements through
respiration or fermentation
maggot masses
