into the darkened realms of cannibal tribes 
walls with deformed dead bodies and lifeless souls 
brutally massacred existence, senselesly spreading on the ground 
meathooks holding tight the rotting female torsos, half eaten and supending upside down 
the bloodshed is beyond description, uncognizable inhuman bestiality 
strangulated sluts chopped in half, yellow pus leaking from half opened crushed cranium 
grusome old methods of bizarre death 
victims suffering with open eyes living this hell, 
mass destruction with impalement, savage bleeding 
sadist creatures on duty with an entirely oxidised huge butcher knife 
a faultless tool for pouring out internal organs, organs carefully
dismantled from bodies for the imminent consumption
cold icy meat hooks holding the heavy torsos 
scrumptious odour of repulsive bowels, huge appetite for fresh human flesh
cannibal tribe feasting and enjoying the taste of raw female flesh, fully consumed inclusive bones 
morbid circle of cannibalistic tribe, continues devouring dead cadavers
with an animalistic killer instict.
