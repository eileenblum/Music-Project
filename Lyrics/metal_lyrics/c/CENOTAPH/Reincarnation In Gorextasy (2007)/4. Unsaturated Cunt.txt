Your goddamn existence is making me sick and driving me insane 
boiling anger in my veins 
you are just a worthless putrid mass of flesh 
your weak body cant resist at all 
I ll chop you into little pieces and hacked up for dinner 
my passion of rage and enticing urge to stab 
in disrespect to human mankind, you are just a piece of shit 
look into my cold eyes, feel my cold knife 
senseless stabbing, murdered, cruel dead 
all organs ripped out. 
I stabbed deeper and deeper 
ferocious killing 
hear your last breath 
billions of worms are lingering to eat you 
your skin is melting, unrecognizable identity on face 
thirteen days later your body will start to decay 
tale of horrid gore 
intense stench of the dead 
I sent you to heaven that you dreamed of 
the stench of the decomposing body, I feel better today
