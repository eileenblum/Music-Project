this is my concept, this is my excuse, my dirt, my blood, and my addiction. and goddamn if your goddamn gods are too afraid to live. but i was born to fuck up and all i know is what i love. i am going to bleed till i get more, cause i want more and i'll lose sleep and i'll be tired until my lungs collapse. just like i'd give it all up for reno, i'd trade the world to watch you grin, so more embrace, fugazi and rites of spring, and less of everything else. so lets just kiss until forever, we'll fight to keep it interesting. call me a trainwreck and i'll call you tomorrow. let's play for keeps and forget about borrows. i miss you.
