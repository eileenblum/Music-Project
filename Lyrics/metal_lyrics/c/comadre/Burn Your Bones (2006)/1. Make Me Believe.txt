A call to arms across this golden land. 
The hearts of the future are pulsing in your hands.
And it's on me to heal them, and it's on them to need it, 
and it's on you to make me believe we stand a chance.
'Cause we are living in a fucking dream, 
now let's make this dream a reality.
Make me believe in these fading lights as they dim before me.
Make me believe that this will never end.
