There's a smile 
hidden in everyone's step 
and for every step taken 
a piece of us begs to stay together.  
Maybe everything I know 
is just made up, but I won't give up anytime soon.  
Yes, I know my legs are tired and they would kill for some rest, 
but my muscles are working to find a perfect cure...
