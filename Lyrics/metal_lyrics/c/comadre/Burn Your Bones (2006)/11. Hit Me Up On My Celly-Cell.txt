our heads are a couple of cases 
and i am everything and miserable without you. 
three thousand miles can hold so much. 
these miles of land. 
the land is separation. 

how much desperation in between? 

like a phone call with no reception,
our heads are a couple of cases 
and we're so miserable without each other. 
can't wait till we 
can see the same sunset 
at the same time 
can't wait till a phone call doesn't mean 
three thousand miles. 
i think our heads 
are a couple of cases. 
hit me up, boy, on my celly-cell. 

i think our heads 
are a couple of cases. 
we are the doctors 
with all the prescriptions.
can't wait till our appointment comes. 
it's the only medication.
