Built to walk the plank,
No wagons this time,
Just sails ships and hearts,
We've crossed the maps of punk rock,
And taken all we mock,
And tied it up with ropes around our hands,
We're going to take this to our graves,
(To our sea graves),
The Pacific Ocean is a lot warmer,
Where the anchors sleep sound,
Our religion is better,
Where we can't preach and hound,
Down here the tombstones are so beautiful,
With such perfect quotes,
Died trying to save this ship,
"Died trying to save the saviors,
Who were out to save the world."
