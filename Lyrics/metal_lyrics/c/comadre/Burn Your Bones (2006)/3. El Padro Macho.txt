dear holy father i have sinned against you 
and all around your bloody name. 
so you can tear me to shreds 
and i can beg for the forgiveness that is so popular now. 
i love your name in lights, 
so you can tear me to shreds 
and the saints can hold me down as i course out loud. 
"i can't believe in something i can give up on"
