give me hell. count my bones. break thishex. 
let me have this satisfaction tonight and we can share a pulse. 
just keep in mind that this could all fall apart 
tomorrow and the nights can change our hearts. 
but don't blame me for looking forward to running our lives as one. 
i've accepted the fact that someday i am going to lose. 
the colors on my insides will fade from gold to bronze to rust. 
so come on and give me hell. 
these nightmares will always keep the real dreams alive. 
i've let everything hold me back from nothing 
and nothing will always be my everything. 
still, we will rebuild and rule the night. 
and i am sorry that this heart was born to fight
