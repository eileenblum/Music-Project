And how bad luck is my favorite game and how I am better off with stolen smiles, it's ok, you're to blame and I am on fire next to you. Everytime you open your mouth, my throat gets dry and everyone goes numb. I am just waiting to find a face that I can call home, a place to replace birthdays with new days, where no one gets born and these are my friends some pockets full of notes with secrets that could make a bad man worse.
