The last time we spoke, we ended up no where
and it seems like my words
aren't any better than your quotes, 
our speeches were reversed
just like the movements of our hands, 
with every sentence I became more afraid
I remember every sentence and I remember every word,
because through this mirror
I thought my words would come out backwards
and your mouth is just a reflection of what I can't swallow.
