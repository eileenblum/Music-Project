I don't remember the good ones from the bad, 
But it's too late because 
I can't hold back from the bucket of bruises.
Brothers and sisters, our lease is way expired now. 
Drink the youth.
Drink the youth.
The stomach holds heavy circulations, 
Our scariest secrets and pleasures
Fuck us front to back,
Save our teeth and maybe our copies won't melt under the light
