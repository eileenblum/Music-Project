If I could better myself, I swear I would,
I swear to god I'd fucking change myself 
but the five billion hands of the world are pulling me down.
My veins are turning a dark blue,
I feel like dying, how about you?
Take the coins out from under your tongue
unsew the pockets because I am holding on to nothing.
Drown, drown, I'd fucking drown without you.
If I said you were the only one
who could pull me out of this one
would you think it was fiction?
