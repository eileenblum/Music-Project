They said we might not come back from this one,
but who fuckin' cares,
at least it will make us into humans.
Shape my legs until they walk on order,
shape my eyes so they wont tear up on command,
shape this heart and make it harder than forever, 
but remind me never to stick my hand out the window, 
because its worth more than your breath.
