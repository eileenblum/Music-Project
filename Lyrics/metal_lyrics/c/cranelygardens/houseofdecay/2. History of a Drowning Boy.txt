[feat. Will Ramos]This is the history of a drowning boy a lonely boy
Who grew into a man with a darkness rising

That passenger he took hold and gave birth to horror and apathy
All these events can be traced to that one unique moment when my eyes first gazed upon that old man's face

On that day my life had changed I needed to find a way to translate my obsession
So I traveled in search of an antidote which I found in the name of silence

In that vision I assimilated death I absorbed and became fear I transcended human form
My anatomy has become an engine of decease

I am drowning in the ecstasy watching their skin turn pale and gray
Lifeless eyes stare back at me
My blood is racing heart is pounding hands and fingers shake

My blood is racing my hands and fingers shake

All I ever wanted was some company
I became the author of tragedy

All I ever wanted was some company
So I led them by the hand into eternity
I became the author of tragedy
In ecstasy asphyxiate
All I ever wanted was some company
In a tomb of wood beneath me they stay
I became the author of tragedy
The world of man will never see the beauty in decay

Beneath these floorboards they lay
My friends

I am drowning in the ecstasy watching their skin turn pale and gray
Lifeless eyes stare back at me
My blood is racing heart is pounding hands and fingers shake

Their fate was sealed the moment they crossed into the house of decay
Their lives become my legacy
As their flesh gives way to time their surrogate tomb awaits

No headstones
No graves
No prayers
No tears

No eulogy for the damned
No roses by their names

I have become timeless I have become infinite
I am tied into eternity through selfish acts of malice

You will remember my name carved into the walls in the house of decay

In the house of decay
