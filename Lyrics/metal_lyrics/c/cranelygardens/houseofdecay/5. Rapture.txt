[feat. Josh Frazier]Carry us home

As the days bleed into night we face a darkness we can't escape
We are the lost
Give us a sign
Help us find our way

Further into the abyss we all fall
We're gasping for air
We're grasping for hope

Carry us home
Give us a sign

A beacon on the horizon promises to be our guide but if the embers fade will our hearts burn bright enough to show us the way

Nowhere to run nowhere to hide
Amidst the chaos before our eyes
We stand at the edge of the world face to face with oblivion

Have we gone too far
Was this all for nothing
Was this for nothing at all
As these days collapse we keep looking back with one thought in mind
Have we gone too far to find our way home

We'll leave behind a trail of our blood
To find our way out of here

Find our way out

A beacon on the horizon promises to be our guide but if the embers fade will our hearts burn bright enough to show us the way

Give us a sign
Show us the way

Nowhere to run nowhere to hide
Amidst the chaos before our eyes
We stand at the edge of the world face to face with oblivion
We'll lock our eyes on the sunset and try to chase the light

Have we gone too far
Was this all for nothing
Was this for nothing at all
As these days collapse we keep looking back with one thought in mind
Have we gone too far to find our way home
