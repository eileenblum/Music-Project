[feat. Dan Watson &amp; Sims Cashion]In the coming days there will be war
In the coming days there will be war
We are blinded by our ignorance
In the coming days there will be war

As the bells of freedom ring
They cry out for tolerance
In the shadow of hypocrisy
Is the illusion of humanity

A cloud of black smoke rises as we dredge up the past
The vision lost but the burden remains
We bite our nose off just to spite our own face

We can't change we can't grow we don't know we are the prey and we are the predator
We fill the streets with arrogance and gasoline and we devour everything that's on the fucking screen
We turn a blind eye to violence when it's their kind
Is this who we are

We will all suffer

When it all comes to surface we will see who is worthless
When it all comes out now

Welcome to the new reign where animals and men behave the same
Welcome to the new reign where the law of the land is hypocrisy

Black smoke swallows the sky as the blind lead the blind in circles
Black smoke swallows the sky the worst in us comes to surface

We are no better than the ones before us if we behave like savages
We are no better and we never will be
We are no better we never will be

Through a narrow lens of common vision is an image of desperation
We remain tethered to the past while we revel in our ignorance
We planted the seeds for progress but we reaped a fruitless harvest
With the new reign upon us the sun sets on the hope for tomorrow

Primordial creatures wallowing in the filth of their own demise
The only thing holding them together is belief in a blatant lie
Devouring flesh of their own
They will inevitably reap what they have sown
