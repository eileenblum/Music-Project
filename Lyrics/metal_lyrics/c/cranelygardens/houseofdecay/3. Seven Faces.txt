[feat. Chad Ruhlig]We are the keepers of war we are the takers of peace
We are the architects of history and the world that you know
We prey upon the weak and feast upon the dead
We sink our teeth into the hearts of men and tear them apart

Into the hearts of men we will sink our teeth

A species in kind from the cradle we climbed
Born from the absence and brought into reality
In fields of human skin gardens of ignorance
In shallow souls of men our names will be heard

In this industry we manufacture greed
In this realm morality has become obsolete

In this realm a never ending cycle is formed in the shadows only to enslave in the name of profit

And when we have it all it will not be enough
Our avarice demands more and more and more

In the furnace of endless obsession we burn the dream of the American nation
And with the ashes of the dream in our hands a new order of the ages will come

The eye of providence shines

Our hunger knows no end we feast on the flesh of the dead
Our thirst cannot be quenched without the blood of man

There is a new age coming
When the kingdom falls
Then the world will know
We are forever tyrants
