To the first and the last I ask why did you bring us here

Would you set fire to your own home just to burn the flesh of your children
Will I be damned by a god that I don't know while I spend my life searching for you

"Lest you perish in the way..."

(Through him with him in him the earth will be devoured by his jealousy)

(Make ready to slaughter the sons born after the flood
For the guilt of their fathers there will be no pity no mercy)

Because we ate the fruit just to learn the truth
He will lay his vengeance upon us

White
Red
Black and pale

Until the world burns
Until the flames rise
Until the seventh seal breaks and the trumpet sounds

Until the trumpet sounds

To the first and the last I ask why did you bring us here

Would you set fire to your own home just to burn the flesh of your children
Will I be damned by a god that I don't know while I spend my life searching for you

A jealous god above
A jealous god below
The fire and the flood
The venom and the sword
Bone of bone
Blood of blood
From father down to sun
Ash to ash
Dust to dust
These sins came unto us
Is this the word of god or the will of man

I look out at the world from atop this man made mountain
And my heart grows weary from the site
But with another deep breath I pull this from the inside
Creator watcher mover are you listening to me
I will scream these words with the fear of my sins
I challenge you to save your world without destroying what you've made

Would you set fire to your own home just to burn the flesh of your children
Will I be damned by a god I don't know
Will I waste my life searching for you?
