As we revolve around the sun I'm burdened with the end before me
As we revolve around the sun I'm searching for clarity

I've spent my whole life dragging my feet
Welding these chains that bind this weight to me
A heart of broken hope a mind of uncertainty

When the pain comes the fears exposed and a fragile man is left of me
When my eyes close will I exhale my last breath in agony

Underneath the weight of the end I feel the panic again
Underneath the weight of the end I bury my head in my hands

When the tide falls and the currents pull and wash me away
When the worms come and nothings left of me what will remain

Underneath the weight of the end I feel the panic again
Underneath the weight of the end I bury my head in my hands

When I woke from that dream short of breath and overcome with fear
As the innocence died the truth became clear
That night I felt the pressure of the burden
That night everything became real
Brought to my knees under the weight of the reality
Crushed by the chains that bind the world to my heartbeat

Searching for something more before time abandons me

So I carry the earth on my back
So I carry the earth on my back
I will carry the earth on my back
Until I reach the gates or I burn eternally
