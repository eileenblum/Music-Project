Everyone lives the life that's given to them, presented on a silver platter free of sin
We all get a choice given keys to the world. Roll the dice of fate. The path unfolds
You took a chance when you put it in your vein, your life is lost again
Leaving trails down the road that you paved in, this night air won't fade away. The broken one is you, so take that grin and run
Run far away from this life that you have betrayed. You lost control of yourself. Run far away. You have betrayed. You are a plague
As your choices fade the sunsets, free yourself of this habit.
Pointing fingers to the ones that were always on your side will only cut the ties leaving you further behind.
Addiction won this round, you are weak again. To our dismay you have failed our friend
Just know our words won't suffocate you now
You looked at us and in a blur saw what you've done. Next time think twice, it was more than a pill
Lying on your back as your face turns pale, was this fix worth more than the friends who were there?
Was it?
You are a fucking plague on all life. Just like a leech, just like a parasite
You are a slave to the pain. We brought you up, you gave in again
You are a plague
You are a slave
You're a fucking plague
