Simple words of elegance can't substitute atonement
Softly spoken contradictions infiltrate my ears
Like the figure in the mirror only knows the opposite
How could you be so heartless, is this who you've become
How could I be so careless. Is this what I've become
The air drains from my lungs, the strength vacates my heart
Her eyes are my heroin, they'll take me to heaven, then drag me through hell
How could you be so heartless, you've brought this upon yourself
How could I be so careless, I've brought this upon myself
Piece by piece we tore ourselves apart
Stitch me up but you can't hide the scars
All the things I've seen and all the things I've done, those things tore me apart, I tore myself apart
The air drains from my lungs, the strength vacates my heart
The volume of my actions made you deaf to all these words
This is how it has to be
I will grab my eyelids and I'll tear them off my face if that is what it takes for me to finally see the truth
See the truth from the lies
My mind drifts upon memories. My eyes are focused on this vision of the past which only seems to be nothing but a perfect silhouette of a dream
Of a dream
As I was wadding through the waters of the deepest green, I took a gasp of air and dove under the wake
Beneath the willow it all began, and side by side it came to an end
Amidst reflecting on the bonds that we have broken, there is an echo of the promise that I made
Even after we fall apart, do you remember that's what I said
Even after we fall apart
Those words are ringing inside my head
Even after we fall apart
Even after we're finally dead
