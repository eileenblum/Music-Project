Don't run for the exits
We're all trapped inside
We set this world on fire
We'll be burned alive
Just like a slaughter house
We're marching single file down a rode
paved with the sins of the past
There is no coming back
We tore this world apart
We dug our own graves
In the end of days, there will be no season
Go ahead and pray for your salvation.
It's the end of days. Listen, heed this warning, "Don't try to pray, nothing can save you"
We tore this world apart
And our time is running out
In the valley of locust there will be no God
In the face of true horror you will see that it holds no love
In a world of shadows covered in darkness, you will find no hope
In the valley of locust there will be no God
No God to save you
Ignorance breeds ignorants
They say we're moving forward, but it all seems the same.
Are we moving in circles?
We must, we must wake up
Will we, will we survive?
We are the composition of all mankind's bad decisions
We are the cancer of the earth
In the valley of locust there will be no God
In the face of true horror you will see that it holds no love
In a world of shadows covered in darkness, you will find no hope
In the valley of locust there will be no God
No God to save you
In the end of days there will be no season, all of your prayers fall on deaf ears
It's the end of days, and you ask how we got here, look in the mirror for your answer
If you still question that
Are you blind, or did you close your eyes?
In the valley of locust there will be no God
In the face of true horror you will see that it holds no love
In a world of shadows covered in darkness, you will find no hope
In the valley of locust there will be no God
No God to save us all
From the mouth of hell they rise with the knowledge in their hands of what we've done. This world will end in the blink of an eye as we all pass through the gates of hell
From the mouth of hell they rise
The pain and torment that we all shall face will be unbearable, if the people of this world can't learn to love
