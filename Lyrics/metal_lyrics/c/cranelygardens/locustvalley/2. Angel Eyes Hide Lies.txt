You never said a word
Within a single moment, everything became transparent. Somewhere between hatred and disgust honesty was born
Within a single moment your skeletons were freed. The truth has come to surface, now you can barely breathe
Within a single moment your skin became impure. You watch them turn their heads over, over again
You hide behind a wall of lies. No words can save you. No angel's eyes
The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
And now you lie in the bed you've made, do you sleep well?
You're not a man you're a coward
You hide behind walls of lies
You're such a fucking coward
Devil with the angel eyes
You are the devil with the angel eyes
Drowning in lies, swallowed by eyes. You can't run, you can't hide
If it was me, if I was alive, I'd be the devil with the angel eyes
The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
And now you lie in the bed you've made, do you sleep well?
You're not a man you're a coward
You hide behind walls of lies
You're such a fucking coward
Devil with the angel eyes
You're reaping what you've sown
