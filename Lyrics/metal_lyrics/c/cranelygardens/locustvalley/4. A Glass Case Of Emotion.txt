As we marched toward autumn the carousel begins
Riding on butterflies wings our structure rose
We climbed reaching the sky, higher and higher
And when the world tested strength, something was missing
In the face of collapse, we breathe the end
On the precipice of change
Change and regression
We are left with nothing, with nothing more
As we follow, life is hollow
Moving backwards, downward spiral
Open me up, tongue my weakness
Water boils, blackness swallows
Forget your name, forget your face, forget your eyes, forget your taste
Another life, another day, another chance to walk away
We'll cut the chord and separate, we'll close the door and say goodbye
As the promises washed away
I let it get the best of me now there's nothing left
The time has come to say goodbye
The time has come
Backs to the wall
Our frailty becomes our history
In the face of collapse, we breathe the end
On the precipice of change
Change and regression
We are left with nothing, with nothing more
As we follow, life is hollow
Moving backwards, downward spiral
Open me up, tongue my weakness
Water boils, blackness swallows
Now the time has come for me to let it all go
Forget your name, forget your face, forget your eyes, forget your taste
Another life, another day, another chance to walk away
We'll cut the chord and separate, we'll close the door and say goodbye
A sunny day, a rainy sky, when I walked away, I learned to fly
