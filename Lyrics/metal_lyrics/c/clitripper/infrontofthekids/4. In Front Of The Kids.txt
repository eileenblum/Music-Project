[Ian]

Abduct the slut
What I see for her
Pornographic infamy
Mutilate the weak,
The young
Too innocent to know fear
Come here

Broadcast her screams
On T.V.
But you can't see her eyes
Bleed from the pain
She experiences

[Chorus:]
Let them see
Do not turn away
What I have done
Watch them turn away
A warning to them
Crush their bones
The T.V. glows
In front of the kids

Fearing the worst
She tries and runs away
From pornographic infamy
Cocks down her throat,
Choke
Fist through her belly
To her spine,
You die

[Chorus]
